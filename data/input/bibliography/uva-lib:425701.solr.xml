      <field name="heading_text">Problems in the Making of Computer Concordances by S. M. Parrish *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Most of us have read with private delight Yeats's withering verses about scholars, those "old, learned, respectable bald heads," who "edit and annotate the lines / That young men, tossing on their beds, / Rhymed out in love's despair." Perhaps because we all feel uncomfortably vulnerable to the indictment, we can share a macabre enjoyment at wondering what Yeats would have thought about the electronic computer, the lightning-rapid, passionless, remorseless, soul-less editor and annotator that cannot cough — in ink, or anything else — and wears no shoes to wear the carpet with. What magnificent wrath and scorn would Yeats have let fall upon us for invading his world of symbol and Irish legend to count "gyres" and index the varieties of "love" on an IBM machine! In thoughts like these, and the fears they represent, lies the first great problem of making computer concordances. For every good humanist feels ambivalent about the intrusion of technology into his domain. While we may, with one part of our minds, accept the fact that electro-mechanical devices must inevitably take over the routine chores of scholarship — collation of texts, for example, and enumerative bibliography — with another part of our minds we warmly commend the Dante Society of America for resisting the help of a computer to complete its monumental, new Dante Concordance now in progress. Members of the Society, it turns out, scattered through the nation, working alone by hand on their assigned blocks of pages, value too highly the sense of community that seals them into one tribe to wish to sacrifice it for the advantages of speed. (What is five years — or twenty-five — in the timeless world of Dante studies?) Here, we like to think, is the embattled humanist courageously holding out against automation, and deserving of our whole-hearted support. Our psychological resistance to automation in the Humanities is likely to be stiffened by our superb innocence. Delightedly, we indulge ourselves with terrors that are meaningless to people who know anything about computers. If electronic brains can index and edit poetry, we inquire fearfully, how long will it be before they begin to compose poetry? But we rarely stay for an answer, so ardently do we cherish our fancies. We cannot, I suppose, be expected to welcome the arrival of a computer-poet, though it might be extremely interesting to have some of his productions on which to test our critical principles. (Would it be committing the biographical heresy to identify the poet as a computer? If we refuse to take any account of the poet, the better to scrutinize the internal order of the poem, which would prove the more stimulating exercise — the search for irony, or the discrimination of a persona ?) It is hardly to our credit, however, that we find "sinister" implications in every technological advance, unshakable in our conviction that literature and technology don't mix — a conviction probably held by the monk in his scriptorium, gloomily contemplating the first moveable type. Could we not be expected to show at least as much maturity and vision as the mathematicians, who see no threat to their own supremacy in the arrival of machines that make thousands of calculations every second? "We can always think of more things to ask the machine to do than it can ever learn to do," they will say confidently, and get on with the business of developing the sensitivity and power of their marvellous tools, knowing that every advance yields them more freedom from drudgery, more opportunity for creative research. We might wonder whether it is these people or the Humanists who are the more dedicated to the human use of human beings. But our innocence is not the only problem. For even those of us who try to come to terms with automation are likely to be frustrated, owing to our inability to communicate with computer scientists in their own language. When the computer programmer talks of a "word," he means "thirty-six bits," and by "thirty-six bits" he means six "six-bit" elements of the binary number system in which the machine counts. The basic number of bits (an abbreviation of "binary digits") happens to be six not, as a learned humanist friend of mine conjectured, because certain tribes of American Indians developed an effective number system on a base of six, but because six is the smallest number of binary digits that will accommodate the 47 characters on an IBM print wheel. These, of course, are misunderstandings of the simplest kind, involving the transfer of metaphors from one discipline to another. Far more complex and disturbing are the misunderstandings that result when we attempt to parse a technical paper dealing with computer processes. Though the words are clearly English, and often familiar, we are likely to find the concepts beyond our grasp, and the language, somehow, impenetrable. As a result of our inability to speak the language of computer science, the computer people are obliged to communicate with us in our language, and they have a way of telling us the things we seem so delighted to hear. "This machine," they will say reassuringly, speaking of a new computer, "is fairly stupid. It has only about a second-grade intelligence." "Of course," they add, after a carefully timed pause, "the last machine we had was only in the first grade. . . ." And they will go on thoughtfully to tell us about the "compiler," a new device by means of which the machine can be taught to learn from its own mistakes, and thus in a sense to program itself. The question that immediately rises to haunt our minds — "who confesses the compiler?" or something of the sort — has little meaning for the programmer because he has been using words and metaphors drawn from our world, not his own, and ours is so obviously remote from reality as to be almost a fairy-land. These two worlds represent, of course, the two cultures so brilliantly portrayed by Sir Charles Snow in his memorable Rede Lecture of 1959, The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution . The separation between them is, as Sir Charles declared, one of the critical problems of our age. Its magnitude becomes distressingly clear to anyone who endeavors to apply the processes of computer technology to research in the Humanities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II But it is time to move to more immediately relevant problems. When we began at Cornell in the spring of 1957 to develop a concordance technique on the IBM 704 computer, we had no models to imitate. Neither the Revised Standard Bible concordance (made on a Remington Rand Univac) 1 nor any papers describing electronic indexing of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the works of Thomas Aquinas 2 had yet appeared — nor had the word-index to Dryden, which was made by hand 3 (it took some twenty years) then checked and printed by means of IBM accounting-machines. As we surveyed the problem, it seemed to us that the indexing process should remain rigidly under computer control to ensure speed and accuracy, yet that correction of errors must somehow be provided for; we felt, moreover, that for economy the computer should be induced to give us a finished page print that might be photographed for publication. As we ultimately worked out our technique for a pilot run on the poems of Matthew Arnold, the process went roughly like this. The lines of Arnold's verse were punched on IBM cards, one line per card. We used the standard edition of Arnold, edited by Tinker and Lowry, adding to each line card, by an automatic process, the line number and page number shown in that volume. Variant lines, made up from the Tinker and Lowry collations were also punched (each with an identifying "V") then grouped at the end of each poem; a separate title card was punched and inserted before each poem. The entire deck of cards (some 17,000) was now "listed" by an IBM printer and proofread. At this stage errors could be corrected by simply pulling and replacing cards. When we were satisfied that the deck was accurately punched, we fed the cards into an IBM Card Reader, which transferred the data on them to magnetic tape. At this juncture the 704 computer came into play. Since alphabetical sorting is not one of the operations which the 704 was designed to perform, the computer program had to be an innovative piece of research, involving much trial and error. Thanks to the creative ingenuity of our programmer, Mr. James A. Painter of the IBM Corporation, we were ultimately provided with a program that perfectly suited our needs. The program had three distinct steps. In the first, Arnold's words were picked out of his lines of verse and collected on a separate tape; in the second, the words were sorted alphabetically; in the third, they were re-united with their lines (to which titles had now been attached) and prepared for "listing." Before beginning the first step, the machine assigned to each line of verse an arbitrary serial number, thus making what we have called a "line dictionary." The machine then scanned each line word by word, reading from the beginning to the first space, then on to the next space, and so on. As each word was picked up by the computer it was automatically checked against a list of some 150 common, "non-significant" words (that is, words not to be indexed) previously stored in the computer's "memory." If the word proved to be on the list, it was dropped, and the next word on the line picked up; if the word was not on the list, the computer transferred it, along with the serial number of its source line, to another tape for sorting. The second stage of the program began when all "significant" words had been collected. The sorting procedure is too intricate to be described in detail, but briefly it involves a lengthy series of comparisons. As each letter — and of course each word — goes onto magnetic tape from the punch card, it is coded as a series of binary digits on which any of the operations of binary arithmetic can be performed. When two different words are compared, therefore, the one which proves to be the "smaller" is sorted first alphabetically. Since Arnold wrote about 64,000 "significant" words, the number of comparisons required was very large, in spite of some ingenious short-cuts devised by Mr. Painter; although the computer is capable of making approximately 2500 comparisons per second, the sorting took 25 hours. It is fair to add that much of this time was consumed by auxiliary machine operations, including an elaborate checking routine written into the program. While the 704 is an exceptionally reliable machine — which is to say that its error rate is very low — long runs increase the probability of error. To ensure absolute accuracy a sum-check on the numeric operations of the machine was performed automatically about every ten minutes of the Arnold run; if the check failed to clear, the program was rolled back to the last successful check and re-started. One ought further to add that recent refinements of the sorting routine have reduced the time to less than ten hours. At the end of the second stage of the program we had a tape on which all significant words in Arnold's text were arrayed in alphabetical order, each accompanied by the serial number of the line in which it occurred. All that remained, in the third stage of the program, was to recover the lines of verse themselves from the line-dictionary tape (by means of their serial numbers) and prepare them for listing. Once recovered, the lines were arranged on another tape, divided into pages 90 deep, and indented beneath the index words. The order in which the lines fell under each index word was determined by the order in which the cards had been fed onto the line-dictionary tape; in this case, it was page- and line-order in the Tinker and Lowry edition. On the page tape the identifying information was attached to each line, dots were supplied to fill out short lines, long lines were doubled back where necessary, and the word "CONTINUED" was supplied wherever an entry ran past a page break. The final listing was made directly from this page tape by an IBM Printer running "off-line," that is, not involving the computer at all. The resulting pages were reproduced by an offset process, and the Arnold volume was published in 1959, the first in a series to be known as the Cornell Concordances. 4 I present these details in order to give some sense of the way in which an electronic calculator operates, and I have, of course, passed over a number of textual and programming difficulties. 5 Perhaps a single example will suffice to show how some understanding of the machine's operation is necessary to deal intelligently with editorial problems. There was, for instance, the matter of punctuation. The standard IBM print wheel is equipped with some but not all punctuation symbols. For the pilot run it therefore seemed wisest to dispense with punctuation. Some lines were thus rendered mysterious, or ludicrous; some, especially those stripped of apostrophes, became misleading (without the apostrophe possessives usually become indistinguishable from plurals; moreover, we'd becomes WED, I'll ILL, she'll SHELL, I'd ID, and he'll HELL). But we were pleased to see how little the appearance of most lines was changed for the worse. Now, we did preserve the hyphen, which made it unnecessary to join or separate words artificially, but which also led us into a dilemma. If we instructed the machine to treat the hyphen as a letter, all hyphenated compounds would show up as index words, but the second portions of the compounds would not. Arnold's liking for compounds made this result seem undesirable (calling my humanist instincts into play, I once counted, by hand, more than 40 compounds in the "Scholar-Gipsy" alone — "green-muffled," "frail-leaf'd," "black-wing'd," "red-fruited," "close-lipp'd," and so on). We took the only alternative open to us and instructed the machine to treat the hyphen as a space. By this means we saved the second half of each compound but lost the whole as an index entry. Somewhat disturbing was the realization that we were causing compounds with both halves on the list of omitted words to vanish entirely. (If Arnold ever used the hyphenated noun "TO-DO," I am afraid we know nothing about it). As a way out of this dilemma, available for forthcoming concordances, we have incorporated a cross-indexing feature in the computer program. The machine is now directed to treat the hyphen as a letter and thus to print the entire compound as an index entry; it is further directed to list as a separate index entry the second portion of every hyphenated word, followed by the word "SEE" and the whole compound (it was not thought necessary to cross-reference the first portion). Naturally, the lines of verse containing the compound are to be listed under the whole compound, not under the cross-reference. This innovation has one drawback: it lengthens and complicates the sorting routines. For the program has to be expanded to accommodate the longest known word in the text. We felt safe in setting this limit for Arnold at 21. We failed to ask the machine to produce for us a list of index words in order of length — a chore it could readily have performed — so I cannot say how close we came to this limit. I can only offer "inextinguishable," with 16 letters, again discovered by an old-fashioned process. But with hyphenated words to be taken care of we felt obliged to run the allowance up to 30 letters, including the hyphen, and even this may not be enough for Old English texts, or for some of Yeats's remarkable compounds. I have not even yet finished with the simple matter of punctuation. Desiring to add sophistication — not to speak of intelligibility — to forthcoming concordances, we resolved to acquire a special set of print wheels bearing punctuation. But the design of these wheels was not easy to fix. The 47 positions on the standard wheel provide for 26 letters, 10 digits, and only 11 "special characters," whereas the ordinary typewriter keyboard has, besides letters and digits, some 18 symbols. We had either to sacrifice such useful symbols as brackets, dash, ampersand (which abounds in Blake), asterisk, and the like, or to displace letters or digits on certain of the wheels. Since we wanted to include among the new characters three Old-English letters, we took the latter alternative. We ordered a 120-wide bank of print wheels made up of two designs: the left-hand 80 wheels, to be used for printing index words and lines of text, are of our new design, with full punctuation but no digits; the right-hand 40 wheels, to be used for printing page and line numbers and title abbreviations, are of a standard design, with all the digits but only minimal punctuation. This complex, but work-able, compromise imposes limitations that must be taken account of editorially. No title abbreviation can contain any special characters (such as thorn) because these are present only on the text wheels. Similarly, where digits occur in the text (as they occasionally do, for example, in Blake), they must be spelled out before punching, or spaces must be left for paste-overs on the final print. Unfortunately, the absence of digits on the left side and center of the page prevents us from having the machine print page numbers at the bottom of the finished sheets, as we had once hoped it might do (regretfully, we turned down our programmer's offer to spell the numbers out). I hope this one example will suggest how complicated even the simplest editorial problem can become. A number of other minor misadventures occurred during completion of the Arnold concordance, some of them exasperating, some amusing. For instance, my unaccountable failure to list "IT" among the words to be omitted required the removal of ten and a half pages of IT from the final print. And when the first full-scale test of the intricate sorting routine produced as the first two items in Arnold's vocabulary AAR and AARAU, our distracted programmer was driven back to his drawing board — until we convinced him that they were perfectly good Swiss place names. But tempting as it is to share these griefs I shall pass them over in order to get to a more important, indeed an over-riding, problem, one that arose with the Arnold but remains to be faced whenever verbal text is processed by mechanical means. No machine at the present stage of its development, not even the most advanced electronic computer, is able to recognize anything but the physical characteristics of a word. This means that homographs are indiscriminately thrown together in a concordance. Now in some instances this result is unobjectionable. Most of the hand-made concordances show under a single entry all the occurrences of such mixed items as "rose," "left," "long," and the like. But difficulty arises with certain common words like "art" and "will," which have one important meaning submerged among the occurrences of another, high-frequency but unimportant meaning. In the Arnold program we had no choice but to include all occurrences of these words, leaving it to the reader to find the important meanings. Yet this is wasteful, and it would clearly be desirable to exclude "art" and "will" where they occur as verbs and keep them where they are nouns. Moreover, in concordances which are likely to be used in linguistic or philological research, such as the Old English, users may expect to find homographs discriminated. What we have had to face, therefore, is the general problem of devising means by which discriminations made by the editor can be incorporated economically into a machine program. I am not sure that we have solved this problem to our entire satisfaction, but we have made two tentative solutions, both now being employed in our work in progress on Yeats, Blake, Ben Jonson, Emily Dickinson, and the Old English poetic remains. The first allows for editorial discrimination of homographs before punching. A homograph discriminant is marked by the editor on the copy and punched into the line card immediately following the appropriate word; the discriminant, which consists of an arbitrary symbol followed by a letter, with different letters signifying different meanings of the word, is used in indexing but suppressed from the print. To employ this technique, the editor must, of course, know where the homographs are in his text and decide before the punch begins which of them are worth his attention. With the second technique, however, discriminations can be made after indexing has been completed and variant meanings have been drawn together under a single index word. This technique involves listing all lines as they are to occur in the finished print but with no page spacing; each line is given an arbitrary serial number. Working with this unpaged list the editor can punch instructions into cards and feed them onto a separate tape, which is played against the main tape to produce the final paged print. The instructions may be of two sorts: (1) delete line X (2) between lines X and Y insert the following line. By combining deletions and insertions the editor can thus either drop all non-significant meanings from an index entry or separate the lines representing one entry into two entries, each with its own index word. If desired, the index words can be followed with grammatical identifications: ROSE (NOUN), and ROSE (VERB). The counterpart of the homograph problem, again originating in the machine's incapacity to deal with anything but physical measurements, is what might be called the general problem of variants. Here we are concerned not to separate forms that the machine has undiscriminatingly mixed, but to bring together forms that the machine, blindly following its mechanical routines, has failed to recognize as related. Again, the need for a solution to the problem is frequently slight. Few of the hand-made concordances have attempted to group grammatical variants under a single entry, and when the text being indexed belongs to the 19th or 20th century, or has been modernized, no significant variants of any other sort exist. It is, of course, old-spelling texts that present the challenge here. In an effort to meet it we have begun work at Cornell on a concordance to the poems of Ben Jonson, based on the Herford and Simpson edition. Some of the thinking we have done, and some of our provisional procedures may be of general interest. To begin at the most elementary level of this problem, one might observe that there are three possible forms which a concordance of a pre-nineteenth-century text might take. First, both index words and quoted lines of context can be modernized, as in Bartlett's Shakespeare concordance. Second, both index words and text lines can be given in old-spelling. Both these types of concordance could be produced on a computer, but neither type is wholly satisfactory. The first involves all the risks and difficulties of modernizing, sufficiently well-known to need no rehearsing here. The second requires a very considerable crossreference apparatus to lead the user to all the various spellings of the word he is interested in. Clearly, the optimum concordance to an early text is of a third type, in which the lines of verse are given in their original form but index words are modernized, exactly as in the Spenser concordance, for one example, where, to look up a word, as the editor remarks, "the reader has only to recall its modern spelling." It is true that this third type of concordance, no less than the first type, would oblige us at one point or another to modernize every "significant" word in the text. But there is a difference. Here we would not be altering the text but only setting down as index words some arbitrary equivalents as a means of locating particular forms. We have here a chance, in other words, to avoid making commitments and to hedge those we do make. In view of the jungle of textual problems that surrounds the act of modernizing, this is surely an advantage. But the important advantage over a modernized concordance lies, quite simply, in the fact that studies of old-spelling forms — grammatical, linguistic, or textual — become possible when the concordance preserves these forms. The scholar interested in comparing Shakespeare's use of "virtue" to Arnold's is satisfied with a modernized text. But the scholar interested in comparing compositors' habits or in tracing dialectal survivals finds no use at all for modernized forms. It may be worth adding that our practice at Cornell will be to keep on file the line tapes of finished concordances. Within 20 or 30 minutes, the computer can, upon demand, search an average tape and produce all occurrences of any specified word, whether on the omitted list or not. If the words are stored on tape in old spelling, it will be possible to look up "nonsignificant" forms which for one reason or another become a matter of interest, whereas if the words are modernized, these forms are irretrievably lost. Our decision, therefore, has been to produce a Jonson concordance with modernized index words and old-spelling text. The difficulties of producing such a concordance by mechanical means should be obvious. Even before old-spelling text can be punched, a good deal of pre-editing has to be done, for elided words and contractions, if punched as they stand, would grievously foul the index. In later stages a fairly sophisticated computer program will be required. For at some point in the process we shall have to replace old-spelling index words with modernized forms, at the same time rearranging lines so as to bring together under the modern form all the scattered variant spellings. The substitution of index words will have to be carried out by means of a separate tape on which each old-spelling index word is associated with its modern equivalent; this tape will be used to control the necessary resorting of lines. Where scattered lines show up under the wrong modern entry, owing to ambiguity in the old-spelling form, we expect to re-sort them by means of the technique I have described for handling homographs on the final unpaged listing. Since the Jonson project is still in an experimental stage, I shall not commit myself to any more detailed specification of its routines, for they may yet change substantially. If I have already gone into closer detail than the ordinary humanist sensibility can bear without anguish, my purpose has been a wholesome one — to reassure the reader that we have not yet been able to reduce all our techniques to automatic routines. Man is still master of the machine. The impatient hopes with which we embarked on the making of concordances have been pretty well checked, as we have learned that special problems are likely for some time yet to multiply, instead of vanishing. The creation of a standard program into which we can pour lines of verse and out of which a finished concordance emerges is still, alas, some way in the future. Before it can come into being we may even have to see the creation of a new breed of editor and critic, one as well versed in binary arithmetic and computer programming as in literary history and the principles of textual criticism. But machines are easier to program than men, and we must not become visionary. Let us look forward, instead, to consider, finally, one or two of the particular ways in which electronic computers are becoming useful to scholars in the Humanities, and especially to editors and textual critics of the breed that now exists.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III One of the Cornell projects now well under way is a concordance to the complete writings of William Blake, edited by David Erdman of the New York Public Library. This concordance is based upon the variorum edition by Sir Geoffrey Keynes, but it will incorporate hundreds of corrected or added readings derived from a fresh collation of all Blake texts carried out over the past year by Dr. Erdman and his world-wide team of devoted Blakeians. The concordance will be, in effect, a new edition of Blake, albeit in somewhat scrambled order. All lines which differ in any significant way from their counterparts in Keynes will be "flagged" in the concordance index and printed up separately as an Appendix to the volume. Since we are establishing as well as indexing a text, it is reasonable to suppose that a study of the concordance in its unpaged form (where changes are still possible) will help us in making final editorial decisions. Conjectural readings, for example, which we have arranged to accommodate, may be materially strengthened, or weakened, by evidence that turns up elsewhere in the text. This integration of editorial and indexing routines is, I think, an important development, especially in a form which it might take in connection with any edition in progress. If an editor can arrange to finish his collations and read proof on the text before proceeding to the rest of his task, he can be provided with a concordance made from his own text to assist him in composing textual and critical notes, and the introduction to his volume. (Any editor will understand how valuable this assistance might be). The concordance could then be published at about the same time as the text itself, perhaps even as a companion volume. There is no reason why this procedure could not become entirely conventional. When it does, the punching of text on IBM cards, fast and simple as it is, will probably become obsolete. It is already possible to feed text into the computer directly from the perforated tapes produced by an ordinary monotype machine; it may soon be possible to scan print photoelectrically and transfer it directly to magnetic tape for computer processing. This is one of the directions that computer work will inevitably take within a few years. To illustrate another I shall again present a single example in the hope that wider inferences may be drawn from it. In the field of stylistic analysis a whole new world of possibilities seems about to open up, the shape of it already discernible. A unique feature of the Arnold concordance (and one which we expect to furnish on all the Cornell concordances) is a list of index words in order of frequency, produced for us by the computer. But counting frequencies is only one of many operations a computer might be expected to do by way of analyzing characteristics of a literary text. The computer's insensitivity to anything but physical characteristics is a smaller handicap than one would imagine, for it can still do something like the things we do ourselves when we identify style. Where we may observe that Samuel Johnson wrote in rotund oratorical sentences and used a Latinate vocabulary, the computer would measure the unusually long intervals between spaces and between periods, and would record the high frequency of commas and of letter patterns like "MENT," "TION," "ATE," "PRE," and the like. Where we might notice, and mark as characteristic, certain conceptual relationships in Johnson's thinking, the computer, with its infallible memory, might accumulate definitive evidence of a kind to which we are normally insensitive, such as keyword clusters, syllable frequencies, trigraph patterns, verb-noun ratios, and other concrete properties which every concept takes on when it is given literary form. When the computer is dealing with an unknown text, the properties it measures might be matched against analogous properties of known texts, and a series of weighted scores assigned to show the degree of correspondence. Thus — to become wholly fanciful for a moment — a newspaper sonnet of unknown authorship might yield a score of, say, 35 as Coleridge, 39 as Wordsworth, 28 as William Lisle Bowles, or Charles Lloyd, or Mrs. Mary Robinson, but a score of, say, 71 as Southey. On grounds like these, provided that there is no external evidence that is contradictory, we would be tempted to attribute the sonnet to Southey. Now the critical imagination may shudder at the thought of running enough tests on the sonnets of Bowles, or Charles Lloyd, or Mrs. Robinson to build up the necessary bank of scores. But there is likely to be a far more serious objection to the procedure I have fanci-fully outlined — even if the results could be made to turn out cleanly. Some readers will perhaps recognize that what I have described resembles a cryptanalytic attack on a piece of cipher text, and will be properly skeptical of its validity as applied to literary text. For as Colonel and Mrs. William Friedman have recently reminded us, in their brilliant and amusing account of the search for cipher in Shakespeare, 6 a cryptanalytic attack is valid only if an underlying system does in fact exist in the text. And who will declare that a system exists in a man's literary style? When we measure the properties of style we measure the man himself, his reason, his logos . Surely what I have proposed is a more terrible thing even than any possible menace to our human supremacy exerted by electronic brains! Yet I am prepared, I think, to press the idea. When one considers soberly the progress we have made during the last half-century in measuring attributes of the mind, we would be incautious indeed to conclude that we have reached the end of this investigation. More probably, we have only begun. But to put the matter in these terms at all is less realistic, I suggest, than to regard the computer technique as simply an extension of the kind of stylistic analysis now being practiced. If the computer does most of the things we do ourselves when we analyze style, the crucial difference is that the powers of this sort of analysis can be fantastically multiplied by electronic application, even with machines now available. And we must understand that we are just entering the age of computer technology. Today, hardly more than 15 years from the opening of this age, computers regularly become obsolete as rapidly as they can be built. I have already mentioned input devices that are learning to read photoelectrically; operating speeds are rising astronomically as tubes give way to transistors, and transistors to lowtemperature crystals (the new IBM 7074 is twenty times as fast as the 7070, itself a transistorized machine and some three times as fast as our lumbering old 704); computer memories are expanding to accommodate hundreds of thousands of words; programs are becoming sophisticated enough to perform accurate and grammatical translation. All these developments, and others equally breath-taking, suggest that it cannot be long before computers will undertake successfully the most delicate and complex programs of stylistic analysis. Nor can it be long, I trust, before the research scholar in the Humanities will recognize these developments and learn to turn them to his advantage — to venture more freely across the boundary that, lamentably, separates his culture from that of the scientist. I am not suggesting that we should celebrate the coming of a new god ( ex machina , naturally) as Yeats might have done, had he lived into the age of cybernetics and "information theory" — perhaps seeing the electronic brain as a great smooth beast, with "gaze blank and pitiless," rolling evenly towards New York to be born. I am only suggesting that the "scientific revolution," which is being created without much help from us, is probably the greatest single fact of our century; that it will go on expanding whether we recognize it or not; that we have nothing to fear and everything to gain from coming to terms with it; and that if we learn to exploit its potentialities we shall be serving the cause of the Humanities in the best possible way.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Electronic Computers and Elizabethan Texts by Ephim G. Fogel</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Librarians, archivists, linguists, and students of literature are rapidly coming to realize that electronic computers, or, better, data-processing machines, can help to solve problems in fields ordinarily regarded as remote from the world of advanced technology. 1 Already there is a formidable bibliography of books and articles discussing automation in the library, automatic search, indexing, and abstracting of documents, automatic linguistic analysis, and automatic translation. 2 So far as I know, however, no papers have been published on the application of electronic aids to the solution of problems in Elizabethan scholarship. The chief purpose of the present essay is to stimulate wider discussion of such applications. I shall concentrate mainly on the possible uses of computer-prepared concordances to and magnetic tape files of Elizabethan texts. 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I It has long been recognized that concordances are essential tools in the critical, historical, and philological analysis of literary texts. Until very recently, it was also apparent that anyone who agreed to compile a concordance had assumed an appalling task. "An exhaustive concordance to the Bible, such as that of James Strong," John W. Ellison estimates, "takes about a quarter of a century of careful, tedious work to guarantee accuracy." 4 When in February, 1911, Professor Lane Cooper of Cornell University, with the aid of sixty-seven workers, saw the Wordsworth concordance through the press only two years and three months after excerpting of the Hutchinson edition had begun, his achievement was quite properly regarded as remarkable. After tens of thousands of man-hours had been spent in excerpting, alphabetizing, and checking, a concordance-editor was usually compelled to search far and wide for a publisher (the Wordsworth was delayed about nine months until a suitable one could be found) and, often, a handsome subvention. As printing costs soared, large concordances became more and more rare. The only conventionally-produced large concordance to an English or American poet which has appeared since the end of 1941 seems to be Professor Eby's concordance to Whitman's Leaves of Grass and selected prose. This work of 980 pages lists at $25. That concordance-makers should turn to electro-mechanical and electronic aids was only to be expected. After World War II, there were efforts to compile indexes by the use of punched-card systems. But the limited capacity and sorting speeds of electro-mechanical equipment made the automatic production of very large concordances impractical. In the last few years, therefore, researchers have turned to large-scale electronic data-processing machines such as those marketed by Remington Rand and IBM. 5 The year 1957 witnessed three independent developments: Paul Tasman, with the collaboration of Rev. Roberto Busa, S. J., worked out a program for indexing the words in the Dead Sea Scrolls on the IBM 705; 6 John W. Ellison brought out Nelson's Complete Concordance to the Revised Standard Version Bible , automatically indexed by the Remington Rand Univac I; and Cornell University launched a program for a computer-produced series of concordances, with Stephen M. Parrish as General Editor. In the same year, the University of California published the late Guy Montgomery's concordance to Dryden's poetry. Since this cumbersome oddity has given many of its users an erroneous impression of what a machine-prepared concordance looks like, it deserves some mention here. One must emphasize that it is not at all an electronically produced work and indeed only in small part an electro-mechanically produced one. When Professor Montgomery died in 1951, he left 240,000 manually indexed cards based on Noyes's edition of Dryden's complete poetical works. Out of the decision to use accounting machines to help in checking these cards grew the decision to print by offset from IBM sheets a list of index-words with abbreviated references to the places where they occurred, but without any context whatsoever. A sample entry from page 1 of the resulting concordance will indicate the difficulties that confront the user: ABIDE     HAP 1928 For each such entry under ABIDE, the reader must consult the prefatory list of full titles geared to the cryptic symbols. He will then learn that HAP stands for "The Hind and the Panther" and that the poem begins on page 218 of Noyes. He must next turn to that page and move forward until he locates line 1928, "No Martin there in winter shall abide," in column B of page 243. But his work is just beginning. In order to ascertain Dryden's various uses of ABIDE (eighteen instances), he must either write out each line as he locates it or else jot down all the page and line numbers of Noyes in which ABIDE occurs and riffle the pages back and forth as he tries to compare instances. One doesn't like to think of the agonies of a reader who wishes to locate and analyze occurrences of the fifty-seven words in "Dryden's major vocabulary" which, according to the preface, occur "from 400 to 1,100 times apiece." Professor Parrish's Concordance to the Poems of Matthew Arnold (Ithaca, 1959) shows that a concordance compiled and printed by electronic data-processing machines (in this case the IBM 704) can give as complete a verse-context and an array of identifying data as the manually compiled type. The first three entries under ABIDE will indicate the advantages of the Arnold: OTHERS ABIDE OUR QUESTION THOU ART FREE . . 2 SHAKESPEARE 1 HE ESCAPES THENCE BUT WE ABIDE . . . . . . . . . 58 RESIGNATION 213 THE LAW IS PLANTED TO ABIDE . . . . . . . . . . . . . 94 SICK KING BOKH 208 Here the concordance provides a full line of context for each instance of the index-word and prints the instances in the order of their occurrence in Tinker and Lowry's edition of Arnold's Poetical Works . The identifying information to the right gives the page of Tinker and Lowry on which the line appears, then the title of the poem in which it occurs, or a rather full and readily understood abbreviation, and lastly the line number. In most cases, the reader will probably be able to determine the different uses of the index-word from the entries themselves, but if he should wish to consult an even fuller context, he can immediately turn to the indicated page of Tinker and Lowry. An appendix gives a helpful index of words in order of their frequency in Arnold's text. The production of this volume of 965 pages required some two hundred hours of card-punching, tape-recording, data-processing, and listing. 7 The IBM sheets were then reproduced by offset and bound in an attractive volume which is priced at $10. Cornell concordances to follow the Arnold will incorporate refinements as rapidly as they are developed. Special print-wheels will provide a full array of punctuation marks and of characters such as the thorn and the ligatures (the Arnold has only the hyphen). Presently available techniques can instruct computers to discriminate between homographs and print them under separate headings, to cross-index hyphenated words, and, for earlier poets, to collect the old-spelling variants of a single word under their modern-spelling equivalent, as in Osgood's Spenser or Tatlock and Kennedy's Chaucer. New possibilities in concordance-making and in other kinds of literary data-processing will doubtless emerge as computers rapidly become more and more complex, swift, and powerful. "The latest [computers]," writes Ritchie Calder, "are a thousand times faster than those of three years ago and a million times faster than those of ten years ago," and he reports that in June, 1959, in Paris, at an International Conference on Information Processing, scientists seriously discussed "machines which would memorize all the knowledge in the world." 8 One's mind reels and retreats to somewhat less staggering fantasies in which the C. W. Wallaces and Leslie Hotsons of the twenty-first century, working in American repositories, ask computers to search magnetic tapes of British archives for all occurrences of names with, say, the components Sh, k, sp, r or M, r, l. A daydream high fantastical, perhaps; yet the photoduplication during World War II of a vast number of British documents, now available at the Library of Congress on microfilm, provides a notable precedent for the internationalization of archives. 9 But consideration of what can be done now is likely to be more fruitful than heady speculations about the future. Literary scholars should give earnest thought to making use of the machines available to them on their campuses: much can be done even with small-scale computers or punch-card and perforated-tape equipment. 10 Efforts should be coordinated in order to determine important needs in different specialties, to prevent duplication of work at different universities, and to disseminate information about new developments in the processing of literary texts. In this connection I am authorized to state that the Department of English at Cornell University will be glad to share its experience in preparing concordances by computer, and its knowledge of work being done at other centers, with those who may be ready to embark on projects of their own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The scholar is the key person in the development of specific programs to process literary data. It is he who must define goals for research and arrive at the most rational procedures for achieving these goals. His indispensable colleague, the computer-engineer, cannot move forward until the scholar himself knows what he wants to do. On the other hand, the scholar must have some awareness of how a literary text is prepared for computer-processing. I shall limit myself here to a simplified, non-technical outline of the steps required to record a text on magnetic tape. i. Having selected a base-text, the scholar edits it for punching. ii. Working at a machine with a conventional typewriter keyboard, an operator punches the text on cards. Each card contains a line of poetry or a similar amount of prose; the punched text is automatically recorded in print at the top of the card. iii. The cards are verified to insure accuracy of transcription. In this process, a second operator punches the same text on the already punched cards. A light flashes if there is any discrepancy between her punch and that of the first operator; she then pulls the card in question, checks the print for errors, and punches the line correctly. iv. Identifying data (page of base-edition and line of poem) are automatically punched onto each card in the set; title cards separately punched for each poem are introduced into the set. v. The information on each card is transferred seriatim onto a magnetic master-tape and can then be processed on a computer according to a previously designed program. When the computer-run is finished, the master-tape can be stored indefinitely, or processed again as required. Through the use of other tapes, the recorded data can be altered so that a fresh master-tape is produced. It will be apparent that the master-tape is in many ways more important than any single list of analyzed data which can be automatically printed from it. The tape is a compact, permanent record. It gives the editor of a computer-prepared concordance, for example, much greater flexibility than the editor of a manually prepared work can enjoy. If he decides at the last moment to include five "common" words that he had originally planned not to print, he need only instruct the computer to add those words to its processing list. And long after his concordance is published, he can quickly retrieve from the tape any verbal data excluded from the book: "the [IBM 704] computer can locate all occurrences of even a high-frequency word in about 20 minutes." 11 So far as data-processing equipment is concerned, then, the tasks of Elizabethan scholarship in the coming years may be defined as the recording on master-tapes of the widest possible array of literary works in their most authoritative and most usable textual form; the duplication and depositing of such tapes in key centers of scholarship; the searching of the tapes on request to provide individual scholars with information that will increase the comprehensiveness and validity of their conclusions; and the selective publishing of machine-prints made from these tapes (concordances, lexicons, frequency lists, textual collations, etc.) so as to serve the needs of the profession as a whole. It will of course be necessary for appropriate groups of scholars to rationalize and allocate these labors. For the rest of this paper, I should like to suggest the kinds of aid that philology, textual criticism, concordance-making, enumerative bibliography, and canonical studies can expect from data-processing machines. I am obviously taking on more than can be handled by any man, unless there exists somewhere a Hercules who is both a computerengineer and a master of the immense domain of Elizabethan scholarship. It will be understood, then, that the following remarks, whether they assume an imperative or interrogative form, are provisional. They are meant rather to raise questions for discussion than to try to supply definitive answers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philology The philological and linguistic applications of computers have been much discussed. Various classes of documents from different historical periods and linguistic communities can be recorded on tapes which computers can then process to produce indexes of graphic and graphicsemantic forms, with accompanying context. As a result, philological studies can be more comprehensive and exact than in the past. Anyone who has come upon instances of a usage earlier than those recorded by the monumental Oxford English Dictionary , and upon other usages that are not recorded at all, can testify to the need for a complete and accurate dictionary of Elizabethan English. Computers could speed the publication of such a dictionary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Textual Criticism An editor preparing a critical old-spelling edition of an Elizabethan poet or dramatist must process an enormous amount of literary data. Collation of early printed editions can be facilitated by machines, as Professor Charlton J. K. Hinman has demonstrated in his collation of dozens of copies of the First Folio. Future editors will also wish to explore the possibilities of computer collation. The more complicated the textual tradition, the more the scholar will appreciate electronic aid in reconstructing a stemma. 12 Again, every editor has to analyze such matters as characteristic locutions and linguistic preferences through all of his author's extant writings, as well as the spelling of any surviving holographs, so that he can decide to what extent a base-text which is not a holograph, and perhaps was not transcribed or printed from a holograph, represents his author's idioms and orthography. In the past, an editor has had to depend upon his memory, at best an incomplete and unreliable guide, or to compile by hand a private concordance, as it were, an index of his author's graphic-semantic patterns. Computers can relieve him of this labor, which adds far too much to his already heavy burdens. Accurate and complete counts of an author's particular word-sequences can also help to detect contaminations. On the basis of such analyses, computers can automatically fill in lacunae or offer conjectural emendations of corrupt or suspect passages; 13 these reconstructions may then serve as a check on the editor's conjectures, or they may stimulate further insights. It is not, of course, a question of a machine's replacing the judgments of a Greg or a Grierson, but of freeing future Gregs and Griersons from the mechanical drudgery that must precede final editorial judgment. Since a concordance is valuable for textual criticism, we may expect that editors of Elizabethan dramatists and poets will also edit concordances to their authors. A preliminary tape that will help the editor to establish his text can be corrected to embody final editorial decisions and a concordance can then be published by offset from machine-prints.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Concordance-Making Here I should like to pose a series of questions. Some of the answers given below have been worked out during preliminary preparations for a concordance to the poems of Ben Jonson, to be edited by Professor Parrish and myself. None of the answers, however, are necessarily final, and I should appreciate comments and suggestions. 1. What kind of base-text should one use? A concordance will have the greatest value for philologists, editors, and canonical scholars if it is based on a definitive edition, preferably in old spelling. The concordance can then refer to the page and line numbers of a readily available standard work and can include editorial emendations as well as authorial variants. If there is no definitive edition, it might be possible to compile a concordance from an early printed text, provided that an acceptable photoduplicate of that text has been published. 14 In that case, the concordance-maker can identify citations by referring to signature and line number of page or column, in the manner of Professor Hinman's references to lines in the Shakespeare First Folio. But reference to authorial variants in other early texts (one thinks of Daniel's and Drayton's frequent revisions) and to modern emendations will perhaps pose a problem. If an acceptable photoduplicate or a definitive edition is unavailable, the concordance-maker should probably pass on to another author. To provide the general reader with references to a virtually inaccessible text is of little use, and to base a concordance on an inadequate edition is unwise. If there were a Jonson concordance based on the Gifford text, it would of course be helpful, but it would have to be redone now that the Herford and Simpson text is available, even as Bartlett's Shakespeare will probably have to be redone when a critical old-spelling edition appears. 2. To what extent should one normalize the text? It seems to serve no useful purpose and is in some cases impossible to retain scribal abbreviations. On the other hand, to normalize i-j and u-v according to modern usage, if the base-edition has not done so, seems to require excessive intervention extending to many lines in every poem or passage of dialogue. The automatic collection of variant spellings under a single head-word will assure that such forms as IELOSIE and IOYND will be conveniently indexed under their modern equivalents. 3. What about textual variants and emendations? As has been indicated, one should include authorial variants. Both a textual crux and the emendation adopted by the editor of the base-text should be indexed. Variants and emendations should be labeled as such (in Professor Parrish's Arnold, a "V" for "variant" precedes the line number). The concordance-maker is not the editor of a critical edition, but he should correct obvious misprints in his base-text and include variants unavailable to or perhaps overlooked by the editor. Sometimes he may have to display the courage of an editor's convictions. The Herford and Simpson text, for example, reproduces in square brackets "a letter or word wrongly inserted in the original." There is no point in indexing such a word; in our Jonson concordance, we have substituted the reading which Herford and Simpson indicate as correct. 4. Should stage directions be indexed? By all means. Stage directions are important elements in plays, masques, pageants, and entertainments. But Ariel's making the banquet vanish with a quaint device and Jack Cade's striking his staff on London stone cannot be located in Bartlett's concordance, which omits all stage directions, as do Crawford's Kyd and Marlowe. Lists of dramatis personae in the early prints should also be included; that such lists call Shakespeare's Lucio "a fantastique" and his Apemantus "a Churlish Philosopher" is surely worthy of alphabetized record. Whether one should include in the same index with the dialogue and the stage directions the copious marginalia which edify the reader of Jonson's masques seems rather more doubtful. 5. How comprehensive should the index be? This is one of the most difficult questions confronting the concordance-maker. Every concordance leaves out all or most of the instances of many common words such as prepositions, articles, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs. In general, computer-prepared concordances will have to follow suit: common words make up more than half of the individual words of any text; a decision to index all of them may push some computers beyond their capacity, will in any case materially increase the running time of a very busy and very expensive machine, and will swell the printed version of, say, a Shakespeare or Jonson or Bible concordance to grotesque proportions. According to John W. Ellison, 131 common words "account for approximately 59% of the text of the Bible," and the large Nelson Bible Concordance would have been "two and a half times its present size" if these words had been indexed (Preface). Yet who is to say that even the commonest word is without poetic or dramatic significance? LIKE, THAN, AS, and SO can lead us directly to the poet's similes; I and related forms to his use of an autobiographical mask and his personifications ("I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers"); O and THOU to his apostrophes ("O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being"); ME, THEE, and HIM to striking inversions of word order ("Him the Almighty Power/ Hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky"). Philological interests also press their claims. Tatlock and Kennedy index all instances of SHALL and WILL "owing to the importance of these words for the history of the future tense" (preface to the Chaucer, p. viii). The Elizabethan philologist may point out, further, that complete omission of the following common words will deprive him of an opportunity for rapid location of the special meanings indicated parenthetically: A (he), AN, AND (if), FROM (at variance with, alien to), ON (of), SHE (woman), WHETHER (which of the two). A canonical scholar may object that failure to list a dramatist's common contractions or his uses of YOU and YE will compel him to duplicate the arduous labors of Cyrus Hoy in compiling tables of linguistic preferences so as to discriminate between different authors in collaborate plays. 15 All true enough. But a concordance to a prolific dramatist will nevertheless have to exclude some of these words and list others only in part. Consider the ubiquitous I. In the 17,500 lines of Arnold's poetry there are more than a thousand I's, and their listing takes up almost twelve pages. In the more than 100,000 lines of Shakespeare's plays, there are probably many times that number. Will the reproduction of all these instances yield advantages proportional to the space required? The concordance-maker will have to answer many such painful questions. At least he can assure fellow scholars that omitted index-words can be retrieved from the master-tape at some later time. I should like to plead, however, for the routine printing in all drama concordances of such common words as ALL, ANY, NEVER, NONE. These terse counters can contribute greatly to dramatic magnitude and intensity. Moreover, in drama as in life, the extent to which a person makes categorical statements is an important clue to the quality of his mind. I have the impression, for example, that Hamlet makes more all-or-nothing assertions ("Thus conscience does make cowards of us all." "We are arrant knaves all; believe none of us.") than does any other Shakespearean character. But I cannot verify my impression in Bartlett, since it entirely omits ALL and gives only a partial listing of NONE. 16 It is doubtless a weakness on my part, but I have thus far been unwilling to make up the deficiencies in the available concordances by tracking all instances of these words through thirty-six plays. 6. Should a writer's dramas and poems be indexed separately? Bartlett's Shakespeare separates drama and poetry; Crawford's Marlowe combines them. Combination seems appropriate for a moderately productive writer. Separation seems desirable when a writer is prolific in one of the genres and almost inevitable when he is prolific in both (cf. Dryden). Separation facilitates study of the verbal artistry appropriate to each genre and enables the compiler to make separate decisions about comprehensiveness (e.g., to omit I from the drama but include it in the poetry concordance). 7. To what extent should disputes about authorship determine the design of the concordance? Crawford's Kyd and Marlowe concordances are both "designed to be helpful to students who wish to study" questions of authorship (Marlowe, p. vii). In the Kyd proper, Crawford includes Arden of Feversham , which he believes is Kyd's; in an appendix he indexes the first two quartos and the folio version of Hamlet in order to lighten "the labour of those who are interested in investigating the claim of Kyd to the Ur-Hamlet ." In the Marlowe proper, he includes the three parts of Henry VI , Edward III , Selimus , and Locrine , which last, he believes, is certainly not Marlowe's but has borrowed heavily from his work. These procedures are indefensible. It is not the concordancemaker's office to argue for or against a disputed attribution. "That task," as Sister Eugenia Logan rightly observes in her Coleridge concordance (p. ix), "belongs in another field of scholarship." Where an attribution has in its favor evidence approaching certainty, the concordance-maker should include the attributed work. Where the evidence is weak, he should exclude the work. Where the evidence is highly probable but not certain, he should index the work and indicate its status, perhaps by an appropriate symbol. Apparently distinguishable portions of collaborate plays should be analyzed not in separate concordances, but in a single concordance bearing the names of the collaborators. 17 Anonymous plays and plays whose authorship is in serious dispute should be left for the last, and should be grouped in concordances of convenient size according to chronology of composition, as nearly as that can be determined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enumerative Bibliography The concordance principle has been successfully applied to the production of fully analyzed enumerative bibliographies in the fields of chemistry and physics. 18 A new publication called Chemical Titles indexes the key words of titles of articles in 550 journals so that each key word appears in context in a concordance of key words. The bibliography in each issue consists of two parts: a list of articles alphabetized according to author, with full titles and publication data, and a concordance of key title-words in context, with an easily interpreted identifying code that provides a cross-reference to the first part. On the average, there are 5.3 concordance-entries per title. The indexing of key words is entirely automatic. As soon as the journals are received, the titles of articles are transcribed into machine-readable form by punch-card operators. When the file of punch-cards is complete, it is transferred to magnetic tape, which is then processed by an IBM 704. Omitting non-distinctive words such as OF, ON, AND, EFFECTS, ANALYSIS, CHEMISTRY by referring to a dictionary of excluded terms stored in its core memory, the computer edits the materials on the tape in 12 minutes; auxiliary equipment arranges and prints the bibliography in 18 to 20 hours; altogether no more than 21 days elapse between the time the journals are received and the time Chemical Titles is published. Leading scholarly organizations should seriously consider the production of bibliographies by computer. Apart from the rapidity of its appearance in print and its comprehensiveness, a computer-produced bibliography in the field of English literature will satisfy the criterion of full analysis more completely than any of the presently available bibliographies. Each item will appear under various subject-headings, so that a scholar interested in a subject covered only in part in a given book, chapter, or article will find a reference to that source under the subject-heading of his interest. A title such as " Hamlet , Antonio's Revenge , and the Ur-Hamlet " 19 ought rightly to appear not only under "Shakespeare" but also under "Marston" and under the key word "Revenge," so that the article will be brought to the attention of anyone interested in the theme of revenge in Elizabethan literature. In the latest PMLA bibliography, the title seems to appear only under "Shakespeare." 20 I am not, of course, singling out the PMLA bibliographies for special criticism. Within the limits of their chosen form, they are admirably comprehensive, and they offer many cross-references; the instance just mentioned is doubtless atypical. My point, rather, is that all of the present bibliographies are subject to human error which can be much reduced by computer techniques and that none of them meet the criterion of full analysis, which computers can easily satisfy. A certain amount of processing will probably be necessary before one can be certain that a reference will appear under all appropriate rubrics. If "Shakespeare" and "Marston" were inserted in square brackets in the title cited above, the article would be automatically indexed under those names. For purposes of subject-analysis, it would help if scholars curbed their metaphorical propensities and made their titles as nearly descriptive as possible. But even such titles as The Unicorn and the Crocodile can be made to yield their literal contents, sometimes by reference to the descriptive subtitle ( A Study of Allegorical Motifs in Medieval and Renaissance Painting and Literature ), sometimes by a little effort on the part of the scholars who will review the titles before passing them on to punch-card operators. May one take this opportunity to plead for a coordinated effort to satisfy still another criterion of enumerative bibliography, the criterion of efficiency or non-duplication? As printed materials in active fields of research increase exponentially, it becomes increasingly wasteful for independent groups of workers to prepare largely identical bibliographies. The devotion of scholars who spend long hours compiling indexes of current research is impressive, but it is disheartening to think of the extravagant repetition of routine tasks. Does it really serve the needs of our profession to produce half a dozen annual bibliographies of Shakespearean scholarship? Would not one bibliography — complete, fully analyzed, and swiftly produced by data-processing machines — suffice? A bibliography becomes even more useful when it provides a brief summary of the contents of a work. Since the beginning of 1958, English Abstracts has been filling a serious gap in research resources. But this excellent publication may some day be confronted by grave problems. Its coverage has been growing constantly and gives every promise of continuing to do so. In January, 1958, the journal listed 32 abstractors on its cover; in December, 1960, it listed 122, an increase of almost 400 per cent. To be sure, the number of items abstracted did not increase by so large a factor. But it did increase very considerably. The first three issues of 1958 printed 426 abstracts on 79 pages; the last three issues of 1960 printed 678 abstracts on 144 pages — an increase, in less than three years, of about 35 per cent in the number of items and 80 per cent in the number of pages. In the not so distant future, English Abstracts , like its kindred services in scientific fields, may be forced to seek machine aid to avoid being engulfed by a tidal wave of publications. Should such a need arise, there is a good chance that data-processing machines will be able to meet it. H. P. Luhn, the IBM engineer whose research made possible the concordance-index of Chemical Titles , has already conducted successful experiments in automatic abstracting. 21 Before very many years pass, text-reading machines may be scanning printed articles, encoding them on magnetic tape, and producing a rapid succession of automatic abstracts — in translation, where necessary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Studies in Attribution Concordances and magnetic tape files will obviously facilitate the gathering of internal evidence for the solution of canonical problems. They will enable one to find parallels more rapidly and to make various special checks. Professor R. C. Bald, for example, observes that Hand D in The Booke of Sir Thomas More makes likely a "graphic confusion between x and y " and that such a confusion seems to have occurred in Troilus and Cressida v.i.16, where "the Quarto reads 'box' [and] the Folio corrects to 'boy.'" 22 J. Dover Wilson has collected similar examples of misreadings which could easily have resulted if a good quarto was printed from copy in a hand such as D's. 23 If all of the Shakespeare quartos and the First Folio were recorded on magnetic tape, one could ask a computer to sort out all words that ended in x and y and other easily confused characters. Or one could ask it to search tapes of other Elizabethan dramatists for complete lists of linguistic preferences such as Professor Hoy used to determine the shares of various collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher canon. Freed from the tedium of amassing examples, scholars could devote their higher energies to the interpretation of evidence retrieved and classified by machines. 24 Again, the more concordances there are, the easier it will be to make negative checks — to show that a seemingly unusual parallel occurs in many writers and is not therefore probative of a particular author's claim to an anonymous work. One hopes that the use of parallels, whether for purposes of proof or disproof, will cease to be fragmentary and unsystematic. If we had reliable information about the average frequencies of certain locutions in the vocabularies of educated men using certain forms of discourse at a certain time, the coincidence of many above- or below-average occurrences of even common phrases might become probative of authorship. Perhaps the accumulation of linguistic frequencies by computers will encourage mathematicians with an interest in literature or literary scholars with a flair for mathematics to push onward in the directions indicated by G. Udny Yule's The Statistical Study of Literary Vocabulary . 25 Unfortunately, however, electronic computers and their printed products will probably fail to discourage some scholars from playing the game of parallels badly. Those who in the past have been intent on parading insignificant agreements between two texts as strong arguments for common authorship have seldom taken the trouble to make negative checks in available concordances. Will a special pleader in a hurry pause to reflect merely because aids to reflection are more abundant? "It is the peculiar and perpetual error of the human intellect," Francis Bacon warns us ( Novum Organum , I, xlvi), "to be more moved and excited by affirmatives than by negatives; whereas it ought properly to hold itself indifferently disposed towards both alike." "Indeed," he adds, "in the establishment of any true axiom, the negative instance is the more forcible of the two." Computers will not do away with the Idols of the Tribe; to guard against such illusions is the province of education in the spirit of scholarly and scientific argument. With the spread of that spirit, one may hope with Bacon (I, cxxx) "that the art of discovery may advance as discoveries advance." Meanwhile, one trusts that more and more scholars will find ways to advance Elizabethan studies by enlisting the aid of electronic dataprocessing machines. The chief barrier to such an effort is likely to be a lingering suspicion that these machines are somehow baleful, that they somehow constitute a threat to the humanist's distinctive values. But such fears are groundless; they can only be damaging to the progress of Elizabethan and indeed of all humane studies. It is surely inhumane to scorn mechanical aids which by releasing from soul-killing drudgery that most remarkable of all instruments, the brain, free it for its proper function — the enlargement of man's intellectual and spiritual realms through the use of creative intelligence. It may be appropriate to conclude with a striking Elizabethan example of humanist initiative and persistence in making available a novel means for the achievement of a noble end. 26 On March 16, 1542/3, the musician John Marbeck, organist at St. George's Chapel, Windsor, was arrested for possessing heretical writings, among which were materials for a concordance to the English Bible. On July 26, 1544, Marbeck was found guilty of heresy and was sentenced to die at the stake the following day. Fortunately for music and scholarship, however, he was pardoned by Henry VIII and was released from prison. When the accession of Edward VI created a friendlier climate for innovation, Marbeck again took up his suppressed project. In July of 1550 he at long last published A Concordāce, that is to saie a worke wherein by the ordre of the letters of the A. B. C. ye maie redely finde any word conteigned in the whole Bible , so often as it is there expressed or mencioned . Elizabethan scholars may well take inspiration from this Elizabethan precedent.</field>

Cf. also the useful mimeographed Reports of the Groth Institute, founded by Professor Ray Pepinsky at the Pennsylvania State University. With the aim of preparing a revised edition of Paul von Groth's encyclopedia of crystallography "in perhaps a hundred volumes," Professor Pepinsky and his co-workers have developed effective techniques of indexing and informationretrieval using inexpensive electro-mechanical equipment: see esp. Reports Nos. 40, 41, 44-48, 53. 11 Parrish preface to the Arnold p. xiii, n. 1. 12 John W. Ellison, for example, is planning to collate electronically 800 versions of the Greek text of the Bible. 13 Tasman, p. 256, mentions reconstructions of lacunae in the Dead Sea Scrolls. "Up to five consecutive words," he reports, "have been 're-written' by the data processing machine in experimental tests where the words were intentionally left out of the text and blank spots indicated." 14 I am indebted to Professor Fredson Bowers for this suggestion. 15 See Hoy's "The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon," SB , VIII (1956), 129-146, IX (1957), 143-162, XI (1958), 85-106, XII (1959), 91-116, and XIII (1960), 77-108. 16 Neither word is indexed in Mrs. Cowden Clarke's concordance; except for a few inadvertent omissions, all occurrences in Hamlet only are listed in the Appendix to Crawford's Kyd concordance. 17 Here as elsewhere, procedure will have to be flexible. It would probably be advisable to include all the plays in the "Beaumont and Fletcher" canon in one concordance. Again, if a successor to Bartlett believes that hands other than Shakespeare's are present in Henry VIII and Pericles , he should nevertheless include these two plays in his concordance and content himself with stating his views in the preface. 18 See "Chemical Literature Gets a Quicker Index," Chemical and Engineering News , XXXVIII (April 4, 1960), 27-28. 19 John Harrington Smith et al. , SQ , IX (1958), 493-498. 20 LXXV, No. 2 (May, 1960), 203. 21 See Luhn's "Auto-Encoding of Documents for Information Retrieval Systems," in Boaz, Trends in Documentation , pp. 45-58. 22 " The Booke of Sir Thomas More and its Problems," Shakespeare Survey , II (1949), 58. 23 "Bibliographical Links Between the Three Pages and the Good Quartos," in A. W. Pollard et al. , Shakespeare's Hand in "Sir Thomas More " (1923), pp. 113-141. 24 The kinds of evidence bearing on attribution are more various than can be discussed here. By counting distances between punctuation marks, a computer can gather statistics about sentence-length and sentence-segmentation. By collecting all words with certain medial or terminal letters, it can help one to establish authorial or compositorial spellings. By retrieving blank-verse lines with two- or three-letter final words, it can provide information about weak endings. The scholar armed with knowledge of a computer's capabilities will readily think of ways of exploiting them. 25 Since I wrote these remarks, I have learned that Professors Frederick Mosteller and David L. Wallace, using computers, have applied statistical methods to the determination of the authorship of the disputed Federalist papers. A report on their work will appear shortly in a book on the Harvard Computer Symposium. 26 I am indebted to Professor J. B. Bessinger, Jr., editor of the forthcoming Cornell Concordance to Old English poetry, for calling my attention to Marbeck's concordance.

      <field name="heading_text">Printing Methods and Textual Problems in A Midsummer Night's Dream Q1 by Robert K. Turner, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I A Midsummer Night's Dream Q1, printed "probably by Richard Bradock" 1 for Thomas Fisher in 1600, is a book of thirty-two unnumbered leaves. It collates A-H 4 . A1 is the title page, A1 v is a blank; A2 bears the head title. The text, commencing on A2, is completed fourteen lines down on H4 v , the remaining white space on that page being partially filled by a circular ornament. All leaves are signed with the conventional roman cap and arabic numeral, except F2 where an italic cap and H4 where a small cap are used. The speech-prefixes, which are indented, are set in italic caps and lower case, with some substitutions of small caps, and the stage-directions in italics with personae usually, but not always, in roman. Entrance directions are usually centered (exceptions occur on D2 v , F1 v , and H1 v ) and exit and other subordinate directions are placed in the margin unless they are fairly elaborate as they are on F4 v and H1. There is nothing very striking about the typography; on cursory examination the book seems to be a run-of-the-mine Elizabethan dramatic quarto. Neither variations in spelling nor typographical abnornalities indicate that it was set up by more than one compositor. A close look at the running-titles, however, gives us our first hint that the procedure adopted for printing was not so straightforward as may at first appear. Separately signed preliminaries, we have long known, were often printed after the text, 2 but when the preliminaries and the beginning of the text share sheet A we have some right to expect that sheet to have been set up and machined before the rest of the text. The running-titles, however, show us that sheet A of MND Q1 was the last sheet to go through the press. The book was worked in two skeleton-formes, one regularly imposing the inner and the other the outer formes. 3 The running-titles read on both recto and verso "A Midsommer nightes dreame." except on H3 v where we find "A Midsommer nights dreame." Significant changes were made in two titles during the course of printing: (1) The "g" appearing in the title used on B3 and C3 (IV in the diagram below) was replaced at D4 v , and the new type appears on E4 v , F4 v , G4 v , H3, and A4 v . (2) The title used on B4 v and C4 v (VII) is characterized by a broken "r" and a defective "e" in "dreame." At D3 a break in the "M" also appears, and the three defects are found together on E2 v and F3 (where the two "e's" of "dreame" were exchanged in position). At G2 v the "r" seems to have been replaced, and the "e" prints somewhat better than usual. When the title appears on H1, only the break in the "M" and the new "r" are evident, and only these two characteristics can be observed in the title as it appears on A3 v . It is then clear that sheet A was printed after sheet H, and with the aid of the following diagram, in which the running-titles are represented by roman numerals, we can understand why running-title IV, which is normally found in the same forme with VII and VIII, happened to be dissociated from them in sheet A: 4 H(o), which, as I shall show below, must have been the first-printed forme of its sheet, evidently came from the press about the time the type pages of A(i) were ready for imposition, and it was thus convenient to impose A(i) in the H(o) skeleton. However, because A(i) contained a blank (A1 v ) and the head-title (A2), two of the H(o) running-titles, IV and V, were displaced. When the skeleton for A(o) was later made up, running-title IV, being available, was used together with two running-titles from the H(i) skeleton, that forme having been machined and its skeleton freed. Knowing that H(o) was sent to press before H(i) and that earlier in the book all the outer formes were imposed in the same skeleton used for H(o), and all the inner formes in the same one used for H(i), we can infer that outer formes of all sheets but A regularly preceded inner formes through the press. An examination of the reappearances in various parts of the book of certain recognizable types shows that composition was by formes. 5 Let us first consider the implications of type reappearances in the first two sheets to be set. Type from B(o) is found in both formes of sheet C: d B1,18-C1 v ,8 F B1,27-C1 v ,34 k B2 v ,1-C1,8(?) b B2 v ,23-C4,26(?) f B2 v ,33-C3,33 y B3,7-C2 v , 7 h B3,10-C1,1 ſt B3,10-C2 v ,15 B B3,sig.-C1 v -23 N B4 v ,7-C3,16 ſſ B4 v ,24-C1 v ,5 whereas in C type from B(i) is found only in part of C(i): d B2,2-C3 v ,7 f B2,14-C3 v ,16 h B2,25-C3 v ,11 y B2,27-C3 v ,34 W B4,8-C4,7 Similarly, type from C(o) is found in both formes of D: d C1,7-D3,24 g C1,9-D3,24 d C1,28-D2 v ,31 p C1,29-D4 v ,23 y C2 v ,7-D4 v ,22 y C2 v ,18-D3,17 w C2 v ,24-D2 v ,30 m C3,5-D2,14 m C3,6-D2,14 N C3,16-D1 v ,5 u C4 v ,12-D1 v ,32 k C4 v ,30-D1 v ,20 u C4 v ,32-D1 v ,24 and type from C(i) in D only in D(i): ſſ C1 v ,5-D3 v ,23 d C1 v ,7-D4,4 n C1 v ,33-D4,28 A C2,21-D3 v ,4 n C2,24-D3 v ,3 d C2,31-D4,10 When type reappears in this manner, composition cannot have been seriatim . Had it been so, B(o), to consider the forme which must have been distributed before the composition of sheet C had got very far along, could not have been made ready for the press until B4 v had been set. The workman would then have started on sheet C, but we have evidence that B(o) had been worked off and distributed before he reached line 5 of C1 v , that is, after he had set only a page of the new forme. Presumably B(i) would then have perfected its sheet, but this forme too was distributed during the setting of sheet C. The press, then, would have been delayed for at least the length of time required to set C3 v and C4 before the first forme of C could have been imposed. We know, of course, that press delays sometimes occurred, but, if we examine the reappearances of sheet C type in sheet D, we will find that there too a delay would have resulted from seriatim setting and so through the rest of the book. It seems clear, then, that B(o) was completely set and sent to the press before B(i), that it was machined and ready for distribution before the composition of C(o) was begun, that B(i) was off the press and distributed during the setting of C(i) — in short, that the book generally was set by formes. But, as we shall see when we examine the type shortage evidence, this is not the whole story. The same pattern of reappearances can be seen in most of the subsequent sheets. D(o) type is found in both formes of E: m D1,13-E3 v ,8(?) k D1,14-E4 v ,24 k D1,21-E4 v ,23 I D1,23-E4,10 r D2 v ,12-E4,27 W D2 v ,14-E1 v ,31 k D2 v ,17-E1 v ,24 m D4 v ,1-E2,13(?) and D(i) type in E only in E(i): N D1 v ,5-E1 v ,35(?) k D1 v ,20-E2,8 u D1 v ,24-E3 v ,23 ſt D1 v ,25-E3 v ,31 m D2,14-E3 v ,24 y D2,27-E2,1 B D2,32-E1 v ,7 S D4,27-E4,30 E(o) type in both formes of F: d E1,5-F1 v ,27 o E1,18-F2,14 n E1,29-F2,26 B E1,31-F1 v ,29 d E2 v ,32-F2,10 y E3,12-F4 v ,33 m E3,17-F4 v ,23 u E3,26-F4 v ,3 b E3,29-F4 v ,21 ſh E4 v ,25-F1 v ,7 and E(i) type in part of F(i): B E1 v ,7-F3 v ,26 f E1 v ,13-F3 v ,16 k E1 v ,24-F3 v ,25 W E1 v ,31-F4,33 F(o) type in both formes of G: I F1,7-G1 v ,27 M F1,13-G4 v ,9(?) ſh F1,18-G4 v ,10 m F2 v ,5-G2,13(?) d F2 v ,28-G2,29 b F3,6-G2,3 W F3,7-G4 v ,8 ſſ F3,16,G1 v ,29 u F4 v ,3-G2,11 M F4 v ,17-G1 v ,29 and F(i) type in G(i) [and also in H (o); see fn.11]: W F1 v ,2-G3 v ,3 d F1 v ,27-G3 v ,5 B F1 v ,29-G3 v ,21 g F2,8-G3 v ,5 d F2,10-G4,30 G(o) type, however, is found only in H(i) rather than in both formes of that sheet: u G1,5-H3 v ,8 h G1,11-H1 v ,18 ſt G1,12-H1 v ,32 m G1,14-H2,3 m G1,16-H2,1 r G2 v ,19-H2,28 ſi G2 v ,26-H2,15 ſt G3,11-H4,14(?) m G4 v ,24-H4,22 A G4 v ,26-H1 v ,13 L G4 v ,27-H1 v ,31 y G4 v ,31-H2,32 and G(i) type does not reappear before sheet A: y G1 v ,17-A2,13 S G1 v ,26-A2 v ,5(?)

H(o) type reappears in A(o), but I find no H(i) type in sheet A: k H1,1-A2 v ,17(?) f H1,5-A4 v ,8 y H2 v ,17-A2 v ,20(?) y H2 v ,18-A2 v ,6 h H2 v ,24-A3,21 k H3,21-A2 v ,34 L H3,31-A2 v ,5(?) We can confirm, on this evidence, the inference drawn from our examination of the running-titles. It appears that B(o) was first composed and was machined while composition continued on B(i). The reappearance of B(o) type in both formes of C shows that B(o) was distributed before the composition of C(o) had gotten very far along; if we trust the identification of the "y" at C2 v ,7, we can say that it must have been distributed before that line was set. B(i), it is seen, was distributed after C(o) was completed but before the compositor had gotten more than half way through C(i). This relationship between composition, presswork, and distribution seems to hold good throughout most of the book, but at sheet G certain abnormalities begin to appear: G(o), which should have been distributed before or early in the compostion of H (o), was apparently not distributed until the setting of that forme was completed, G(i) until after H(i) was composed, 6 and H(o) until after G(i) was completed. We thus have evidence that during the composition of sheet G the time relationship which had existed between the compositor and the press was disturbed, but we cannot without further examination tell what the cause of this disturbance was. Of the evidence examined so far, two completely different interpretations seem possible. The compositor may have finished the setting of the material cast off for G and H(o) so fast that he was able to impose H(o) before the press had worked off G(o). On the other hand, he may have been so delayed in setting that, although G(o) was returned from the press and available for distribution at the proper time, he deliberately put off its distribution until he could get a new forme, H(o), ready for imposition, thus avoiding or reducing a press delay. Sheet G does contain a little less material than other sheets; throughout the book the usual line count per page is thirty-five, and so it is in G except for G1, G1 v , and G2 v , which contain thirty-four lines and G2, which contains only thirty-two. The sheet as a whole contains six fewer lines than others, but this reduction, it seems to me, is more than balanced by prose passages on G1 v , G2, and G2 v . Thus we cannot account for an increase in the speed of composition on the grounds that the material in sheet G would have been easier to set than that in the earlier sheets. To this point I have suggested that there were only two methods of composition— seriatim and by formes—available to the workman who set the type, and I have argued that the latter method was employed in MND Q1. Yet we must realize that when a compositor set a quarto by formes he did not necessarily have to set the type-pages in numerical sequence within the formes, although it is my distinct impression that this order was usually adopted. Nor did the compositor necessarily have to set either by formes or seriatim ; he could, if he chose, combine the two methods. Although we can be reasonably sure that MND Q1 was in general set outer forme first, we might now see what we can tell about the order in which the pages of each forme were composed and whether the compositor ever deviated from strict adherence to the method which he generally followed. In order to do this we must use type-shortage evidence in combination with the evidence of type reappearances. By itself the testimony of shortages is, I believe, less reliable than that of any other bibliographical technique. We generally assume that when a compositor ran short of type of a certain kind, say roman capital A, he substituted for it another appropriate kind of type, say italic capital A or small capital a, and that he continued his deliberate use of wrong-font letters until his supply of proper types was replenished by distribution. There is no doubt that compositors substituted in this manner: we can in some instances determine exactly how many types of a particular kind were in the case; we can see these types being used up, substitutions for them being made, the original supply being reused after distribution, and then the cycle repeating itself. 7 What sometimes complicates matters is that compositors apparently did not always wait until the supply of regular type was completely exhausted before they began to substitute, and then when distributing they did not always separate the substituted from the regular type but evidently distributed both into the same box in such a way that the two sorts later appear in a more-or-less random mixture. Even when attempts seem to have been made to keep the two sorts separated, once substituting began compositors seem occasionally to have substituted when they had plenty of the regular type on hand, probably because the supply of regular type became fouled during distribution. However, the reliability of type shortage evidence can be increased when we evaluate it in the light of type reappearances, but even here we can be forced away from the most desirable position by occasionally having to take into account the evidence of only one or two reappearing types and sometimes having to argue from the non-reappearance of type. Both are bad policies because mistakes in individual type identifications are easy to make and reappearances are easy to miss. With these precautions in mind, let us examine the type substitution in MND Q1. In sheet B we find that a shortage of roman capital A was made good by the substitution of small capital A, as follows (here and subsequently, numbers to the left of the stroke represent types of the proper kind and those to the right substituted types): 8 B(o) B(i) 1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 A/a 5/0 2/0 5/0 10/0 6/0 8/1 8/5 4/1 Here it seems evident that in order to stretch a dwindling supply of A's the workman began to substitute occasionally on B2 and continued to do so through the rest of the sheet. The pattern is consistent with our earlier conclusion that B(o) was first completed, and we can say that B2, B3 v , and B4 of B(i) were probably composed after the rest of the type-pages in the sheet. It is a safe guess that all of B(o) was set before work began on B(i), but we cannot absolutely rule out such an order as B1-B1 v -B2 v -B3-B4 v -B2, etc. If this seems a borrowing of trouble, we might look at the next sheet, where once again the A's run short: C(o) C(i) 1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 A/a 10/0 0/4 0/2 0/4 9/0 6/0 4/0 2/0 Type reappearances tell us that B(o) was almost certainly distributed by the time C2 v was set and possibly before much of C1 was set (on the dubious evidence of the "k" at C1,8). The type substitution pattern indicates that the earlier point is the correct one. But B(o) contained twenty-two A's. Why, then, did the compositor begin to substitute on C2 v when he should have had twelve A's available even if he had completely exhausted his supply in completing B(i)? Evidently he did not set in the sequence indicated above, but as follows: C 1 1 v 2 2 v 3 4 v 3 v 4 A/a 10/0 9/0 6/0 0/4 0/2 0/4 4/0 2/0 Here twenty-five A's are used before substitution begins at C2 v , a reasonable number if twenty-two came from B(o) and a few remained after B(i) was completed. Moreover, we found no B(i) types in any pages of C(o) or on C1 v or C2. Apparently the compositor's intention was to set the sheet seriatim , but, upon completing C3 and realizing that he could not get the inner forme completed in time to avoid a press delay, he set C4 v , thus completing the outer forme first. The supply of A's was replenished by the distribution of B(i) after C4 v was set and before work started on C3 v . The evidence in sheet D is weaker, but the best indications are that the compositor did not try to revert to seriatim setting: D(o) D(i) 1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 A/a 7/0 5/0 8/0 5/0 -- 6/1 5/0 7/0 Twenty-six A's were returned to the case with the distribution of B(i); six were required for C3 v and C4 and seven for D1, at which point, according to the type reappearances, C(o), containing ten A's, was distributed. There were, then, at least twenty-three A's in the case when work started on D2 v . By the time the single A was introduced on the next-to-last line of D2, twenty-four A's had been used, a close enough tally. As type reappearances indicate, C(i) was distributed at this point. We can thus be reasonably sure that, since D2, D3 v , and D4 were set after the other pages of the sheet, the order shown is correct. In sheet E two new shortages are found: E(o) E(i) 1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 A/a 7/6 0/2 3/2 4/0 3/0 5/0 2/0 6/0 H/h 1/1 2/1 0/3 1/1 3/0 1/0 1/0 2/3 H /h 3/0 9/0 4/0 11/0 4/0 7/1 3/6 0/7 Type reappearances tell us that D(o) was distributed before or during the setting of E4 v : as we have noted above, one D(o) type appears at E4 v ,23 and another at E4 v ,24. Since the first A on that page occurs at line 14 and since the small cap H for roman capital H occurs at line 11 and the one roman capital H (used incorrectly for an H ) at line 24, we can probably believe that the compositor stopped work temporarily at line 12 or 13 to distribute D(o). The number of types used is close to the number that we can estimate to have been available. The distribution of C(i) had returned twenty-one A's and nine H's to the case, and we have reason to think that the supply of A's, at least, was low at the time of distribution. Nineteen A's were used on D3 v , D4, and E1, where the substitution commences, and three more on E3, just before the next distribution. Seven H's were consumed in D3 v and D4 and four more used before the supply was replenished. Type reappearances also indicate that D(i) was distributed very shortly after D(o), the first type from this forme reappearing on E1 v . Before the composition of E started, the case was resupplied with eighteen A's, enough to finish out the forme with no substitutions, but only eight H's and no H 's. Thus small-cap h's were introduced in place of both these letters late in the forme. Once again it looks as though composition must have gone in normal sequential order within the formes. The situation in sheet F is not quite so clear. Here another series of substitution begins: F(o) F(i) 1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 A/a 7/0 5/0 3/0 2/0 8/0 4/0 5/1 0/5 H/h 1/0 3/0 2/0 1/0 2/0 1/2 2/0 1/0 H /h 0/4 0/1 -- 4/1 -- 1/0 -- 0/1 T /t -- -- 4/0 6/1 -- -- 2/1 3/4 Type reappearances tell us that E(o) was distributed between the setting of F3 and F4 v , testimony that is confirmed by the reappearance of H 's on that page. The substitution for T after F3 is to be expected because E(o) had contained but one piece of this type. Yet, twenty-seven H 's would have been returned from E(o) and there should have been no substitution for this letter on F4 v or F4. The h on F4 v , however, is found in line 1 and may have been set before the distribution was made, and that on F4 is found in the catchword, a fact which may somehow make a difference. These two aberrant substitutions we may be able to accept, but the presence of H's on F1, F2 v , and F3 also creates a problem, since substitutions for this letter had begun on E4 v and the resumption of the exclusive use of H suggests that the distribution may have occurred at F1. The whole affair is rather unsatisfactory, but I would rather believe that the compositor, perhaps influenced by the genuine shortage of H 's, unnecessarily set a few h's for H on E4 (he had, after all, at least thirteen H's in the case when he began E (i)—six from D(o) and eight from D(i) less one used on E4 v ) than that, if E(o) had been distributed before F1, he would continue to substitute unnecessarily for H through two pages and that no recognizable types from E(o) could be found until F4 v . I believe, then, that the order shown for F(o) is probably correct. 9 Upon the completion of this forme, the workman seems to have gone ahead with F(i), setting F1 v , F2, and perhaps part of F3 v , and then suspending composition to distribute E1 v , as type reappearances suggest. From this single type page only three A's, three H's, and no T 's were returned to the case, thus necessitating substitution for the A's and T 's required by F3 v and F4. The rest of the standing type seems to have been distributed after F(i) was imposed. 10 Sheet G too seems to have been set in regular order within the formes: G(o) G(i) 1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 A/a 4/0 5/0 4/0 8/0 7/0 1/0 7/0 4/2 H/h 2/0 1/0 2/4 1/3 1/0 3/0 2/0 1/0 H /h 4/1 1/1 1/1 1/0 6/0 -- -- 2/0 T /t -- 2/1 1/4 3/4 -- 4/0 3/3 0/3 When E2, E3 v , and E4 were distributed just before the setting of G1 began, the supply of A's, H's, and T 's seems to have been nearly exhausted. The distribution returned to the case thirteen A's, four H's, ten H 's, and two T 's. Type reappearances indicate that at least two pages of F(o)—F1 and F3—were distributed between the setting of G3 and G4 v . In the composition of the first three pages of G(o), exactly thirteen A's were used, but the newly provided H's and T 's were inadequate and substitutions were required for both letters. The occasional use of h's for H 's throughout G1, G2 v , and G3 was unnecessary since there were about thirty-six of the italic pieces in the case when the composition of G(o) began, and I can account for their appearance only on the supposition that some small caps had accidentally been mixed with the italic. Because the distribution of F1 and F3 provided ten A's but only three H's and four T 's, we find no substitution on F4 v in the A's but continued substitution in the H's and T 's. The distribution of the other two pages of F(o) apparently took place after G(o) was imposed and brought in seven A's, four H's, four H 's, and six T 's, which type supplied the demands of the pages of G(i) until, as type reappearances suggest, F1 v and F2 were distributed between the setting of G2 and G3 v . These two pages of F(i) returned to the case twelve A's, of which eleven were consumed before a's were introduced near the bottom of G4; three H's and one H , enough to hold good through the rest of the sheet; but no T 's, thus causing substitution for this letter to begin on G3 v . The remaining pages of F(i) were distributed after the imposition of G(i). 11 In the two remaining sheets, H and A, I can see no indication that the type pages were not set in sequential order within the formes, although the type-shortage evidence is not so clear as it might be. It would seem that by this time all of the regular boxes were becoming fouled with the small caps and that substitutions were sometimes made accidentally. In sheet H a new shortage appears: H(o) H(i) 1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 A/a 4/0 3/0 2/6 1/2 5/0 4/0 4/0 5/0 H/h 2/0 -- 2/1 -- 1/0 5/0 -- 1/2 H /h -- -- -- -- 1/0 1/0 1/0 -- T /t 7/1 0/2 0/4 -- 1/8 1/1 1/0 0/1 P /p 3/0 4/0 1/2 -- 2/6 -- 2/0 -- A(i) A(o) 1 v 2 3 v 4 1 2 v 3 4 v A/a -- 6/0 5/3 2/3 -- 5/1 1/0 4/0 H/h -- 4/0 -- 1/1 -- -- -- 1/0 H /h -- 2/1 6/0 6/0 -- 2/2 4/0 6/2 T /t -- 1/2 0/1 -- 1/0 1/1 3/0 1/0 P /p -- 1/0 -- -- -- -- -- -- Type reappearances testify that F3 v and F4 (containing five A's, three H's, no H 's, five T 's, and one P ) were distributed at H1, G(o) (twenty-one A's, six H's, seven H 's, six T 's, and six P 's) at H1 v , G(i) (nineteen A's, seven H's, eight H 's, seven T 's, and fourteen P 's) at A2, and H(o) (ten A's, four H's, no H 's, and seven T 's) at A1 or A2 v . The substitutions throughout H(o) bear out the time of distribution of G(o), but after this the substitutions seem to occur rather erratically. It is possible that some pages within the formes may have been set out of order (e.g., A3-A4 v -A2 v -A1), but I can see no evidence strong enough to determine the matter. The occasional substitution in the text of t for T on H3, H4 v , H2, H3 v , H4, and A3 suggests that these pages may have been the last set within their respective formes. With the information we have thus gained, we can with some confidence chart the progress of composition as follows: From this we can draw several inferences. It seems likely that the compositor, working on the assumption that composition and presswork could stay more-or-less in balance, originally intended to follow the conventional procedure for setting by formes—to compose two formes, distribute the first, set the third, distribute the second, and so on. That B(o) was machined in the time required to set the four type pages of B(i) or perhaps even a little less time is indicated by its distribution before the composition of C began. Thus the speed of the press, which barring accidents would have remained fairly constant, is established as the rate at which about four type pages could be composed. The compositor could alter this time relationship in his own favor by increasing his normal rate of work or by setting quick pages—pages with short lines or plenty of white space—but I doubt that in setting normal material he could gain more than a page in a forme, if that much. His attempt to shift to seriatim setting in sheet C caused him to delay the distribution of B(i) until he could get B(o) ready for the press, for that forme was probably returned to him while he was setting C2 v or C3. The distribution of C(o) only three type-pages after B(i) is a further indication that the press was working at something like its original rate and that the compositor deliberately delayed the distribution of B(i). Thus we have reason to believe that throughout the book certain formes may have been distributed later than they should have been, not because the compositor had gained on the press, but because he wanted to get a new forme imposed or get within a page or so of imposition before he temporarily stopped composing to distribute. Further, we can understand the nearly simultaneous distribution of the two formes of D; the piecemeal distribution of E(i), F(o), and F(i), attempts to get some type on hand during the composition of a forme without using any more time than necessary; and the distribution of G(o), H(o), and G(i) four type pages late in each instance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Some years ago Professor J. Dover Wilson edited the New Cambridge MND on the theory that an original of 1592 was revised in 1594 and again in 1598, perhaps then for the marriage of the Earl of Southampton to Elizabeth Vernon. 12 The copy for Q1, he believed, was the prompt book, which was written in Shakespeare's autograph and which contained manuscript pages from all three periods of composition. Wilson's theory has not won acceptance in its entirety; Sir Walter Greg, for example, found difficulty with Wilson's notion of multi-level revisions in which there are perceptible (and dateable) stylistic differences and suggested that the Q1 copy was probably foul papers. 13 If so, however, there could easily have been revised passages present, even though they may not have been composed in accordance with Wilson's scheme. As Greg said, A brilliant contribution was [Wilson's] demonstration of revision at the beginning of Act V. Here in the first 84 lines there are eight passages of varying length in which the line-division is disturbed. Omit these passages and a perfectly consecutive text remains. There is no escaping the conclusion that in this we have the original writing supplemented by fresh lines crowded into the margin so that their metrical structure was obscured. 14 Greg does not comment on Wilson's contention that other parts of the text were also revised or added to, but if the copy was foul papers with occasional marginal additions, we could explain the compositor's difficulties as resulting from his being slowed down by patches of difficult material. If the quarto is in part mislined, there is reason to think that the copy may have been similarly mislined, and an important part of Wilson's argument for revision is based on inference from quarto back to MS mislineation. Yet, as the quarto was almost completely set by formes, the compositor may sometimes have tampered with the MS lineation, deliberately compressing or expanding the text in order to make it conform with the space limits established by casting-off. Since we have some idea of how each sheet was set, however, we should be able to tell to what extent the compositor was likely to alter MS lineation as he dealt with mechanical problems created by his method of composing. In B(o), the first forme composed, there are two minor instances of mislineation. The first occurs in the first eight lines of the fairy's speech (B3,14-17;II.i.2-9), which appear in the quarto as follows (correct verse line endings are indicated by a stroke): Fa . Ouer hill, ouer dale,/ thorough bush, thorough brier,/ Ouer parke, ouer pale,/ thorough flood, thorough fire:/ I do wander euery where; swifter than the Moons sphere:/ And I serue the Fairy Queene,/ to dew her orbs vpon the (greene./ The second is found on the last page of the forme (B4 v ,20-21; II.i.115-116): And this same progeny of euils, Comes / from our debate, from our dissention: About the first of these one cannot be positive, but it looks as though the lines probably stood in the MS as they do in the quarto, the quatrain being lined as a couplet and the couplets as single lines of verse. If this is true, the couplets of which the rest of the speech is composed, so lined in the quarto, probably were written in single lines in the MS, but were divided by the compositor who, having had to turn over the last word of B3,17, decided that the MS lines were going to be too long for his measure. The compositor could, of course, do about as he chose with this material since he was working on the first forme of the sheet. In the second case, the mislineation may have resulted from the compositor's carelessness; but later in the play (at F3,26; G1,22; G3 v ,10; and G3 v ,18) we find other examples of very much the same thing, which just possibly suggests that the MS rather than the workman was at fault. When B(o) was completed, the limits of B1 v ,2 and B3 v ,4 had been established; thus we have more reason to think that the compositor might juggle the text of the inner forme to make it get in these limits. Almost certainly he was doing just this when he set a short speech of Bottom's and one of Peter Quince's in a single line of type at the foot of B2 (B2,33; I.ii.52-53). But it appears that Bottom's Ercles speech (B2,15-18; I.ii.27-34) which is printed as prose was probably written as prose in the copy, since no provision was made in the casting-off for it to be set as verse. One further mislineation occurs in B(i): in the middle of B3 v (l. 16; II.i.42-43), we find the beginning of one of Puck's couplet speeches in this arrangement: Rob . Thou speakest aright;/ I am that merry wanderer of (the night, As the speech goes on for fifteen correct lines, the compositor must have planned to set it in couplets and allowed space for them when he established the place in the text at which to begin B4 v even though, by analogy with the fairy's speech on B3, the couplets were written in single lines in the MS. In this instance, however, he apparently thought that he could squeeze the first complete verse line into the same line of type with the half-line of verse which begins the speech, a calculation which, as the turn-over shows, was none too accurate. Since, as we have seen, the compositor seems to have had to adjust the MS lineation in sheet B, we can better understand his decision to shift to seriatim setting in sheet C even though in doing so he penalized himself in his time relationship with the press. C4 v was set out of seriatim order, but no serious problems seem to have arisen. The only instance of mislineation is found at C1 v ,12 (II.i.175-176) where the compositor chose to set a line and a half of verse in one line of type. It is in this part of the text, however, that Wilson thinks heavy revision to have been made—II.i.1-147 belonging to one level of composition, ll. 148-187 to a second, ll. 188-246 to a third, and ll. 247-268 (end of scene) and II.ii.1-42 to the second again. As C1 begins at II.i.130 and C3 ends at II.ii.38, the seriatim setting of the first five pages of the sheet may indeed suggest that the workman was confronted here with a particularly nightmarish piece of composite copy. In D(o) we find two more minor instances of mislining—a prose speech of Peter Quince's at D2 v ,8-9 (III.i.93-94) set in part as verse, doubtless under the influence of Thisbe's immediately preceding verse speech, and at D4 v ,17 (III.ii.48-49) a line and a half of verse set in one line of type. The textual material included in this sheet runs as follows: D1 II.ii.141-III.i.11 D1 v III.i.11-III.i.47 D2 v III.i.85-III.i.120 D2 III.i.48-III.i.84 D3 III.i.121-III.i.153 D3 v III.i.154-III.i.190 D4 v III.ii.33-III.ii.67 D4 III.i.191-III.ii.32 It is interesting that all the material in D(i), the later forme, is perfectly lined, although it is set solid and includes on D1 v and D2 much more prose than verse. According to Wilson, all of III.i and the first forty lines of III.ii belong to the same stratum of composition and underwent small, if any, revision. 15 The exact fitting of the material in the quarto suggests that the manuscript at this point was regular enough to permit quite accurate casting-off. Wilson also believes the half-line at D4 v ,17 to mark an abridgement, but this is a matter upon which our analysis provides no additional information. However, the piecemeal distribution of E(i), beginning with E1 v after the setting of F2 or part of F3 v , suggests that work on F(o) and the first two pages of F(i) went slowly; and this is another part of the text (III.ii, ending near the foot of F2 v ) which Wilson thinks to have been considerably worked over. He sees the irregular lining at E1,13-14 (III.ii.80-81), a shift from couplets to blank verse at E1 v ,27 (III.ii.127), and a short line at E3 v ,19 (III.ii.256) as indications of abridgement, addition, and cancellation. The first is the only mislined passage in the sheet, and, since it occurs on the first page of the forme and does not affect the total number of lines in the page, it seems virtually impossible for the passage to have been deliberately mislined for mechanical reasons. Nor does there seem to be any likelihood that the two subsequent aberrations in the text, even though they are found in the inner forme, arose from the compositor's tampering. At F1 v ,31-32 (III.ii.396-399) we find Puck's four-line speech set in two lines of type, an indication, according to Wilson (pp. 125,130) that they were squeezed in at the foot of a page of revised MS. As two lines only must have been allowed for this speech in the casting-off, the rest of F1 v and F2 being set solid, they were doubtless written in two lines in the manuscript, but it seems much less certain that they were written so as to crowd them on an MS page when we remember that the fairy's speech on B3, which is in the same meter, seems to have been similarly lined in the MS. IV.i begins near the bottom of F2 v and ends seven lines down on G2. About this scene Wilson says in part: Probably most of the scene was composed in 1594 though certain parts look like first draft material recopied, e.g. the prose lining of Titania's speeches 11. 27, 34-35 . . . . 16 The first of these speeches is at F3, 18-19; it appears as follows: Tita . What, wilt thou heare some musique, my sweete loue? The second is at F3, 26-27: (hoord, Ty . I haue a venturous Fairy, that shall seeke the Squirils And fetch thee newe nuts. Because he did not turn "loue" over, his usual practice when a verse line was too long for the measure, the compositor probably thought the first of these speeches to be prose. We have seen him at D2 v ,8-9 line prose as verse, and it does not seem unlikely that here, under the influence of Bottom's immediately preceding prose speech, he would have mistaken verse for prose, especially since the line was probably written in one line in the MS. In the second case, however, the turning-over of "hoord" and the capitalization of "And" make it clear that the compositor knew he was dealing with verse, although he handled it incorrectly. We have here a case very like that previously observed at B4 v ,20, only in this instance I think it would have been very difficult for the compositor to have lined in this manner as the result of carelessness. The lines probably stood in the MS as they do in the quarto, but neither this mislineation nor that at F3,18 provides much evidence for the recopying of an earlier draft. However, the material in F3 v and F4 (IV.i.44-IV.i.110), all verse, is perfectly lined and set solid, an indication that the MS, recopied or not, was regular enough for an accurate line count. Sheet G includes the following textual material: G1 IV.i.144-IV.i.177 G1 v IV.i.178-IV.i.212 G2 v IV.ii.22-V.i.15 G2 IV.i.212-IV.ii.22 G3 V.i.15-V.i.48 G3 v V.i.49-V.i.83 G4 v V.i.118-V.i.150 G4 V.i.84-V.i.117 In this section of the text the most serious mislining occurs, and, as we have noted earlier, on this evidence Wilson argues most strongly for revision in the copy which underlay the quarto. From the point of view of printing mechanics, the sheet has another feature (in addition to the mislining) which is distinctly odd: the number of lines of type per page, earlier a consistent thirty-five, was reduced to thirty-four on G1, G1 v , and G2 v and to thirty-two on G2. Because the mislining is present on G3 v (which contains thirty-five lines of type), it is clear that there is no absolute relationship between the incorrect lineation and the reduction of the number of lines of type per page in the first four pages of the sheet—that is, the lines of type per page were not reduced simply because the compositor compressed material that would have occupied more space if it had been lined correctly. Let us look more closely at the passages in question. At G1,21-23 (IV.i.164-166) we find: (But by some power it is) my loue, To Hermia / (melted as the snowe) Seemes to me now / as the remembrance of an idle gaude,/ Here, as at B4 v ,20 and F3,26, the compositor had nothing to gain by altering the lineation since his version occupies just the same number of lines as the correct version, nor does it seem very likely that his error resulted from a failure of memory after he had seen correct lineation in the MS. Wilson suggests (p. 135) that the lines were written in the margin of the manuscript "to take the place of a longer cancelled passage." Certainly the indications are that the quarto lining reflects the lining of the copy. On G2 v and G3, where there are two lengthier mislined passages, the effect of the mislining is different. The first is found at G2 v ,26-G3,3 (V.i.5-18); asterisks indicate lines which Wilson (pp. 80-81) thinks to have belonged to the earlier layer of composition: *Louers, and mad men haue such seething braines,/ [l. 25] Such shaping phantasies, that apprehend/more, Then coole reason euer comprehends./The lunatick, The louer, and the Poet / are of imagination all compact./ *One sees more diuels, then vast hell can holde:/ *That is the mad man. The louer, all as frantick,/ *Sees Helens beauty in a brow of Ægypt ./ The Poets eye, in a fine frenzy, rolling,/ doth glance From heauen to earth, from earth to heauen./ And as Imagination bodies forth / the formes of things [G3] Vnknowne: the Poets penne / turnes them to shapes, And giues to ayery nothing,/ a locall habitation, And a name./*Such trickes hath strong imagination,/ That if it would but apprehend some ioy . . . . [l. 4] The second is at G3,16-24 (V.i.29-38): Ioy, gentle friends, ioy and fresh daies Of loue / accompany your hearts. Lys . More then to vs,/ waite in your royall walkes, your boorde, your bedde./ (haue,/ The . Come now: what maskes, what daunces shall wee To weare away this long age of three hours,/ betweene Or after supper, &amp; bed-time?/ Where is our usuall manager Of mirth?/ What Reuels are in hand? Is there no play,/ To ease the anguish of a torturing hower?/ Call Philostrate ./ In both instances the text is compressed, a total of twenty-five lines of verse (according to the quarto's standard of lineation) being set in twenty-one lines of type. Neverthless, as was true on G1, there seems to be no mechanical reason here for the mislineation, since the compositor was setting the first forme. Once more it seems likely that the lineation of the quarto reflects the lineation of the copy: there is no mechanical reason why the lines should not have been, as Wilson believes (p. 85), "written on the margin of the MS, in such space as could be found." In G(i) there are further instances of mislineation. At G1 v ,7 (IV.i. 184-185) a short verse line is set in the same line of type with a complete verse line, in just the way we have seen earlier at B3 v ,16 and C1 v ,12. There is no evidence to tell us positively whether the copy stood this way—the compositor may either have been setting what he saw or hedging against faulty casting off—but the occurrence of the same kind of mislineation on C1 v , which was set seriatim , creates a presumption that the copy was so lined. Similarly, we find at G1 v ,22-23 (IV.i.197-198) that there are two lines of verse set as prose (cf. F3,18-19), probably under the influence of Bottom's immediately following prose speech; no space is saved by the mislineation. G3 v contains four mislined passages, the first at G3 v ,10-12 (V.i.58-60): Merry, and tragicall? Tedious, and brief?/ That is hot Ise, And wõdrous strange snow./ How shall we find the cõcord Of this discord? the second at G3 v ,18-22 (V.i.66-70): And tragicall, my noble Lord, it is. For Pyramus , Therein, doth kill himselfe./ Which when I saw Rehearst, I must confesse,/ made mine eyes water: But more merry teares/ the passion of loud laughter Neuer shed. the third at G3 v ,29-30 (V.i.76-78): Phi . No, my noble Lord,/ it is not for you. I haue heard It ouer,/ and it is nothing, nothing in the world; and the fourth at G3 v ,34-35 (V.i.81-83): The . I will heare that play./ For neuer any thing Can be amisse,/ when simplenesse and duety tender it. Since we have seen this sort of mislining in the outer forme, we are probably safe in thinking that here too the mislineation arose from the copy and not from the compositor's efforts to compress his material into a fixed space. Had the workman been making adjustments for purely mechanical reasons, he probably would have done so on G4 as well as G3 v , but the text on G4 is correctly lined. Although detailed reconstruction of a compositor's procedures must be in part speculative, I believe we can see about what happened if we try to follow our man step-by-step through his work on the sheet. We know that he set G(o) first and that he was probably having to work as quickly as he could to keep up with the press. Before beginning G1 he must have cast off the whole sheet, counting out thirty-five lines for each page and marking page-endings in the copy. Had he been under less pressure, he probably could have worked out the correct lineation of the mislined passages (we saw him making correct adjustments in the lineation of his copy in sheet B) which, as Wilson has noticed, were probably marginal additions; but as it was he counted them as they were lined in the MS. If this was his procedure, however, he evidently counted in some material that he later did not set, and it does not seem unlikely, if he was working hastily, that he may have failed to notice that some lines here and there were supposed to be cancelled. Wilson detects abridgements in the text at G1, 22-23 (IV.i.165-166) in the outer forme and at G1 v ,22-23 (IV.i.197-198) in the inner. It seems quite possible, then, that the compositor discovered during the course of setting G1 that he had in his casting-off included a cancelled line. He thus reduced the number of lines of type on that page by one, preferring to set the page short than to readjust the subsequent pageendings already marked. I take it that the lack of one line of type on G2 v arises from similar causes, although there the miscalculation probably sprang from a failure to count out the marginal material correctly; and that on G1 v a cancelled passage of about four lines was provided for in the estimate of space but was not set up, thus requiring the omission of one line of type on G1 v and the opening up of the material on G2. An incomplete prose line at the foot of G2 (l. 31) indicates that the workman had to strain a little to marry that page with G2 v , which had already been composed. The instances of mislineation in sheets H and A (with one exception) are so like those we have already examined that we may summarize them: H1,33-H1 v ,1 (V.i.182-185): Prose mistaken for verse. H1 v ,7 (V.i.193): Two lines of verse in one line of type; probably MS lineation. H2,35 (V.i.262): Two lines of verse in one line of type; probably compositor's lineation (cf. B2,33). H4,7 (V.i.394): Couplet set in one line of type; probably MS lineation. A2 v ,33) (I.i.53): Two short lines in one line of type; responsibility doubtful. At A2 v ,2 and 5 (I.i.24 and 26) Stand forth Demetrius and Stand forth Lisander are centered rather than printed as part of the text as meter requires. Since he set the proper names in italics rather than in roman, the compositor evidently did not take these phrases as stage directions, but lined them about as they were lined in the copy. Wilson (p. 105) notes that "they were probably written as separate half-lines in the original MS, to denote deliberate utterance . . ." or, we may add, to cue obvious stage business. We have seen that the quarto was set largely by formes under adverse conditions probably caused by sections of difficult copy. In only two places (B2,33 and H2,35) does there seem to be any likelihood that the compositor juggled the lineation of the text in order to fit copy to a predetermined space. 17 The bibliographical evidence seems to me to point toward the kind of heavily revised manuscript described by Professor Wilson as copy for the quarto, although it does not, of course, in itself lend any support to his distinction of different levels of style in the revisions. There is, as Sir Walter Greg has noted, no indication that the manuscript ever served as a prompt book, and the presence of revision may lead one to think of late-stage foul papers as copy.</field>

As far as I have been able to determine, nothing is known of Bradock which would be of significant value to us in our examination of MND Q1. He was admitted to the Livery on 1 July 1598 and for a time was actively engaged in the trade. Around the turn of the century, he probably printed several play quartos: in 1598 Edward II Q2; in 1600 Every Man out of his Humor ; in 1601 The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington ; and in 1602 Antonio and Mellida, Antonio's Revenge , and Poetaster (see Greg, Bibliography , I, s.v.). The Stationers' Registers occasionally record his misadventures as well as his normal business transactions, but none of these seem to have any immediate bearing on the matter at hand (see Edward Arber [ed.], A Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers . . . ., passim, and R. B. McKerrow [ed.], A Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers . . . 1557-1640 [1910], pp. 46-47). 2 See Ronald B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1928 [1951 reprint]), pp. 158-159. 3 As the skeletons were transferred, there was some shifting of the positions of the running-titles within their own formes: the running-title of C1, for example, goes to D2 v and not, as we might expect, to D1 or, if the skeleton were turned, to D3. I see no significance in this. 4 RT IX, distinguished from the others by the spelling "nights", replaced VI at H3 v probably because VI had pied. All of the other RTs were in use from sheet B on. 5 As I have noted elsewhere ("Notes on the Text of Thierry and Theodoret Q1," SB , XIV [1961], 221), reapppearing types are sometimes hard to identify and mistakes are easy to make. I think that as a general rule one should have a cluster, perhaps four or five, identifications which he regards as positive before he concludes that a distribution has been made. In what follows, the identifications which seem to me less than positive I have indicated with a query. I worked with photostats of the Huntington Library copy of MND Q1. 6 If, as the running-titles indicate, A(i) was composed before A(o) and we find G(i) type in A(i), we ought to find G(i) type in A(o) also unless it was set from another case. I am pretty confident of the identification of the 'k' at A3.26 but rather dubious about the other identifications in A(o). Since a good many A(o) types were used earlier in the book, the possibility of A(o)'s composition from a different case, and thus by a different workman, is ruled out, but I am not altogether happy about the evidence as it now stands. 7 See, for example, George Walton Williams, "Setting by Formes in Quarto Printing," SB , XI (1958), 39-53. 8 I exclude from consideration what seem to be accidental wrong-fonts (e.g., ital for rom S, D4; ital for rom I, D4 v ; rom for ital S, F4 v ; sc for ital C, G3; sc for rom P, H3 v ); VV for W, an occasional substitution which sometimes confirms the testimony of others but which often does not, I suppose because the compositor did not make a very strong differentiation between the two characters; and a small roman capital I which is sometimes used for the I's of the regular supply. As far as the last is concerned, it is possible that valid evidence could be drawn from the appearance of the smaller type, but there were at least two sizes of I's in the case when composition started (as there were of A's, H's, and P's), and I am unable always to distinguish between these and the third, smaller, size which I think was introduced later. 9 That F3 and F4 v were set after F1 and F2 v is further indicated by the appearance on these pages of a small "k" employed evidently to eke out k's of the regular size. Since these types do not appear in F(i), they were probably not added to the box but set from their own case. 10 Type from E2 and E3 v reappears on G1: m E2,13-G1,16 p E3 v ,13-G1,9 m E3 v ,24-G1,14 w E3 v ,34-G1,12 b E3 v ,35-G1,15 11 w F3 v ,12-H1,25 f F3 v ,16-H1,5 k F3 v ,25-H1,1 B F3 v ,26-H1,28 T F4,19-H1,11 12 A Midsummer-Night's Dream (1924), pp. 77-100 et passim. Line references are to this edition. 13 The Shakespeare First Folio (1955), pp. 240-243. 14 Ibid. , pp. 241-242. 15 Throughout this section of the text, the speech prefix for Puck is Robin , yet at III.i.83 a speech that doubtless belongs to Puck is assigned to Quince. Wilson (p. 122) suggests that in the MS the speech was tagged "pu", and that this was misread as "qu" by the compositor. If so, revision would be indicated since the designation "Puck" belongs to a different level of composition but, Wilson thinks, the revision was very minor. 16 Op. cit. , p. 131. Wilson later notes (p. 132), "Q prints both these speeches as prose. The first might be accidental; the second we must attribute to prose arrangement in the 'copy.'" 17 In a paper entitled "On the Editing of Elizabethan Drama: Or a Note on the Bowers of Light and Darkness" read before the Renaissance Drama Conference of the MLA in December, 1959, Professor Leo Kirschbaum said: "You remember that the manuscript behind the quarto of MND is considered to be Shakespeare's own papers largely because of hypothetical marginal additions which led the compositor to set up incorrectly lined verse. It now appears that whoever marked off the manuscript [for setting by formes] put down too much for certain pages, with the result that the compositor was forced to relinquish correct lining in order to get all the designated material on the page. So much then for the main evidence that the quarto of MND goes directly back to Shakespeare's pen." If my analysis is correct, Professor Kirschbaum is right about the book having been set by formes, but wrong in the inference drawn from that fact.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of John Webster's Plays (III): The Duchess of Malfi by John Russell Brown</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The examples that have been presented in this paper have demonstrated the utility of this particular sort of investigation in shedding light on mechanical and on compositorial practices that offer problems to the bibliographer'—so wrote George Walton Williams in his 'Setting by Formes in Quarto Printing' in Studies in Bibliography , XI (1958). His thesis was forcefully presented, and other bibliographers who study quarto editions of dramatic texts of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries have followed his lead in observing type-shortages in relation to compositors' habits. And now, in proper sequence, a responsible editor of such texts must discover how his task can be aided by this knowledge. He has a new duty: he must determine the order in which the pages of his copy-text were set and then enquire whether this order has influenced each individual compositor's presentation of his copy. In this way he may be able to discover means for presenting a text closer to his author's intentions or the printer's copy. He may be able to do this. So far few have tried, and, until those few have shown their gains clearly, other editors with pressing commitments may be unable to decide whether they should spare the time for this further research. It is in this situation that some processes used for editing John Webster's Duchess of Malfi in the light of knowledge concerning its original printing by Nicholas Okes in 1623 are set out in considerable detail in the following note. From papers which have been published already many relevant facts are known about the kind of copy used by Okes for this play, about the two compositors who set it, and about other quarto plays from Okes' shop within a few years of 1623. 1 We know that The Duchess was set from a scribal transcript, probably in the hand of Ralph Crane, and that the work was divided between two compositors in this manner: Compositor A A1-4 v B3-C2 v D3-E2 v F3-G2 v H3-I2 v K3-L2 v M3-N2 v Compositor B B1-2 v C3-D2 v E3-F2 v G3-H2 v I3-K2 v L3-M2 v N3-4. We also know that some sheets of the second quarto of The Insatiate Countess , printed by Nicholas Okes in 1616, were divided between two compositors in the same way, and that those sheets were set by formes, the inner first, with the compositors working simultaneously; two of the four sheets were set in this order: Compositor X 1 v 2 1 2 v Compositor Y 3 v 4 3 4 v If the copy for The Duchess of Malfi was written as clearly and regularly as other manuscripts known to have been the work of Ralph Crane, this play might have been 'cast off' for setting by formes almost as easily as the printed copy for The Insatiate Countess . The same procedure of composition may have been used. New evidence suggests that this guess is correct. In setting The Duchess there was a shortage of roman, capital T, which was made good by the use of italic; a shortage of italic, capital B, made good by roman; and a shortage of roman, capital W, made good by using two Vs; and these shortages occur in ways that suggest, though not with equal clarity, the same order of composition. The shortage of T is most useful. Compositor A first encountered the lack while setting his half of Sheet H. The following table shows the number of Ts and T s on each page in the order in which they were used; X stands for a T used incorrectly for a T, and the superscript numeral for the number of times the particular letter occurs consecutively. 1 v or 3 v 2 or 4 1 or 3 2 v or 4 v H3-4 v T 9 T 6 ,X 2 T 7 ,X 3 T,X 3 I1-2 v T 3 T 10 T 5 T 4 ,X 3 K3-4 v T 11 T 8 T 2 ,X,T 2 ,X, T,X,T T 3 ,X 9 L1-2 v T 9 T 5 ,X X,T,X,T 7 X,T,X 5 M3-4 v T 6 T 5 T 2 ,X 8 T 7 N1-2 v T 11 T,X 5 T 3 ,X 3 T 6 ,X,T The shortages of T in H3-4 v , K3-4 v L1-2 v and N1-2 v all suggest that the inner-forme pages were set first; and those on L1-2 v , in particular, that page 1 (or 3) was set before 2 v (or 4 v ). It appears that each of these half-sheets was started with some supply of Ts, and that the shortage once felt usually continued with only slight alleviation until the end of the half-sheet. M4 v may have been set before M3, but occurrences of T s in N1-2 v suggest that when a shortage was felt on N2 it continued with only slight relief on N1 and a considerable new supply was not obtained until the commencement of N2 v ; a new supply after M3 and before M4 v would also account for M3-4 v . Shortages of B (chiefly used in prefixes for Bosola's speeches) again suggest that the inner-forme pages were set first. The incorrect Bs first appear on A's pages of Sheet E, and again on his halves of G and K; on B's pages they occur in sheets H,K,L and M. The following table shows incorrect Bs as X; it is arranged as before. 1 v or 3 v 2 or 4 1 or 3 2 v or 4 v E1-2 v B 9 ,X X 5 B 2 -- G1-2 v B 4 X, B -- B 2 H1-2 v B ,X B B 2 B K1-2 v B ,X 3 , B ,X 3 X 4 B ,X, B 5 B 3 K3-4 v B 5 B 6 B 8 B ,X L3-4 v B ,X X 3 , B 3 B X 7 M1-2 v -- B 3 X, B 5 B 4 ,X, B 4 Here the evidence is clearest on K1-2 v , where a shortage was felt almost at once but was relieved after beginning 1; on K3-4 v , where the shortage is apparent only on the last page (Ts were lacking for the last two pages); and on L3-4 v , where the shortage began to be felt on the first page and lasted half-way through the second where it was relieved with four B s which were sufficient through the third page but not for the last. The use of VV for W gives only the slightest evidence. But for C3-4 v and E3-4 v it again suggests that setting started with a supply and that the inner-forme pages came first, and for F1-2 v it suggests that 1 preceded 2 v , and that some replenishment was made before completing F1. X stands for VV in the table. 1 v or 3 v 2 or 4 1 or 3 2 v or 4 v C3-4 v W 6 W 4 X 3 ,W 3 ,X W,X,W E3-4 v W 3 W 4 W 3 ,X,W W 5 ,X F1-2 v W W 4 X 3 ,W W 2 M1-2 v W 5 W,X W 5 W 3 ,X These tables provide no evidence about some half-sheets in the book. But the completely regular alternation of the compositors' 'takes' encourages the belief that a regular sequence of composition was followed: that is, the copy cast off in advance and inner forme pages of each half-sheet set first. And this is further supported by editorial investigations. A recurring problem for an editor of Webster is how to arrange the text as verse. In Okes' quarto of The Duchess numerous lines are obviously bungled, but more are possibly so. For Webster's versification is not always the kind that can be verified by a simple count: it ranges from the easily formal, to the slack, strained, subtle, or hesitant. Moreover he used incomplete verse-lines to point dramatic pauses between speeches and within them, and introduced very short passages of prose in scenes otherwise in verse. 2 Editors often differ about the correct presentation, and their disagreement can be of moment. Literary critics are particularly apt to find importance or beauty in Webster's pauses or metrical subtleties. Una Ellis-Fermor may speak for many: Imagery, therefore, and reflective comment, Webster's usual means of suggesting the existence of this inner form throughout the play, now fall into subsidiary relation to this dominating factor of verbal music, which thus becomes the final and most significant mode of expression. 3 She has noted lines which are 'impetuous, half-hushed now in horror' or 'slow, almost inaudible beginnings', and a 'rhythm' which 'gives no choice' of interpretation of character and meaning. George Rylands, Clifford Leech, Muriel Bradbrook are among other critics who have valued a subtle 'naturalism', a special emphasis, a dramatic tension, many fine and strong effects in the metrical arrangements of Webster's lines. An editor of The Duchess of Malfi must be especially scrupulous in these matters, and here he may find that enquiries into the order of composition of the quarto can help him. If an editor believes that The Duchess was originally set in the order in which it is read, he will probably judge that its obvious mislineation occurs fortuitously. But once he supposes that the copy was cast off before composition and the two inner-forme pages of each half-sheet set first, he will suspect that mislineation is often due to inaccurate casting off and the compositors' attempts to keep in step. In each sheet Signatures 1 v -2 and 3 v -4 would be set consecutively, so that the first page of each of these pairs would be unlikely to have this kind of mislineation; any error could be carried over to its fellow, with the chance that it might be cancelled out by the opposite kind of error in casting off. With added notation on the copy, it might be possible to carry over accumulated error from Signature 2 to 2 v and 4 to 4 v , and, if the two compositors worked perfectly in time with each other and cast off sheet by sheet as they worked through the copy, then some accumulated error from 4 v might be accommodated on the following sheet. But miscalculation on Signatures 1, 2 v and 3 would always have to be remedied on those pages; and, once one compositor lagged behind, miscalculation on Signature 4 v would have to be dealt with on that page. With such considerations in mind, the places where the most responsible editors of The Duchess , F. L. Lucas (1927) and A. K. McIlwraith (1953), saw fit to change the lining of the quarto in ways that altered the number of lines of type to be set are shown in a table. An underlined numeral indicates how often, on the page of the quarto indicated, both editors reduced the number of lines of type—that is, when we may suppose that the compositor added a line to the number in his copy; ordinary type numerals show how often we may suppose that he saved a line. Numerals in brackets show, in the same manner, the occasions when only one of the two editors changed the lineation of the quarto. 1 v 2 1 2 v 3 v 4 3 4 v B -- -- -- 2 -- -- -- -- C -- -- -- 1 -- -- -- -- D -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- E -- 2 -- 1 -- -- -- 1 F -- -- -- -- (1) 1(1) -- -- G -- -- -- -- -- -- 1 (1) H -- -- (4,1) -- -- 1(1) 1 -- I -- -- -- 1 -- -- -- -- K -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1 L -- -- -- 1 -- -- -- 1(2) M (2) 1 1 1 -- -- (1) -- N -- 2 -- (1,1) -- -- 1 This table at once confirms the accuracy of the hypothesis concerning the order of composition and helps the editor when he is uncertain how to present Webster's verse-lines. The following facts confirm the order of composition. 21 times both editors modified the number of lines of type. 7 are on Signature 2 v 7 . . . . Signatures 2 or 4 4 . . . . . . 1 or 3 3 . . . . Signature 4 v 0 . . . . Signatures 1 v or 3 v 3 pages have 2 obvious mislineations; on each page both imply that the compositor added lines of type, or both that he saved. Compositor B was responsible for fewer obvious mislineations than A (9 to 12), but he more frequently varied the number of lines on a page: E3 v , I3 v , K1 and K1 v have 38 instead of 37; F2 v , G3 v and N3 v have 36. It is noteworthy that none of these pages contains certain mislineation. Compositor A only varied from the standard on four occasions, setting 38 lines on D4 v and G1 v (where he made no mislineation), and on H3 (where he did save one line), and setting only 36 on N2 v (where he made no certain mislineation). These variations demonstrate the results of inaccurate casting-off where the compositors were less careful about the precise balance of the printed pages. The first way that the editor is helped by this new knowledge of the order of composition is in assessing the authority of the printer's copy: he may be virtually certain that this kind of mislineation is due to the printing of the play, not to its transcription by the scribe. Understanding where and how mislineation is likely to occur, he will be more reluctant to alter the line-arrangement of his copy-text elsewhere. Secondly the editor is helped in particular readings where it had previously been difficult to decide on the correct line-arrangement. Both the changes suggested, without support, for N2 v can hardly be correct, for they cancel each other out in altering the number of lines of type; the editor should choose one or the other, or neither. And since A set a line short on that page against his usual custom, the suggested mislineation which would imply that he had added a line to those in his copy is the more likely to be correct. The change on H1 which implies that Compositor B added a line is unlikely to be right, if any of the other suggested changes are: and before accepting the large number of these, the editor would wish to find some special reason for the unprecedented inaccuracy. He will view the unconfirmed changes on F4, H4 and L4 v particularly favourably, because they would alter the number of lines of type in accordance with the necessary re-arrangements. Occasionally the editor will be able to propose a change where neither of his predecessors altered their copy-text. An example of this is on B4 v , where the quarto has: Without thunderbolts i'th taile of them;) whose throat must I cut? as one line, and 'must I cut?' is slightly out of alignment with the rest of the type and outside the width of the composing stick used for this page (marked clearly by the turnover of its second line). The typesetting suggests a special effort to accommodate a long line, and it occurs only three lines from the foot of the last page of the outer forme in a half-sheet. The editor would have bibliographical justification for re-arranging and for removing two elisions, printing the passage: Bos . So: What followes? (Neuer raind such showres as these Without thunderbolts in the taile of them;) Whose throat must I cut? Ferd . Your inclination to shed blood, rides post Before my occasion to vse you: . . . . (Lucas, I.i.264ff.) The emphasis is different and a pause has been added; in performance, the two characters will seem the more deliberately to take stock of each other. Or again, on I2 v (the page most prone to mislineation in any sheet, and here one on which both earlier editors have re-arranged the verse-lining once) another change may be introduced. It involves the same kind of alteration to the number of lines of type as the change generally accepted. The quarto has: Oh, but you must remember, my curse hath a great way to goe: as one line, using a turnover for the last word. Lucas and McIlwraith both retain this, the latter showing it in context as: Duch . I could curse the stars. Bos . Oh, fearful! Duch . And those three smiling seasons of the year Into a Russian winter: nay, the world To its first chaos. Bos . Look you, the stars shine still. Duch . Oh, but you must remember, my curse hath a great way to go.— Plagues, that make lanes through largest families, Consume them! . . . . . (Lucas, IV.i.115ff.) But the editor who knows the likelihood of the compositor trying to save a line on this, the last page of the outer forme in the first half of a sheet, will be encouraged to print: . . .nay the world To its first Chaos. Bos . Looke you, the Starres shine still: Duch . Oh, but you must Remember, my curse hath a great way to goe: In performance, there will be an impressive pause on 'chaos'; it will seem the end of the duchess' curse. And perhaps 'Remember' will sound more deliberate in its new position: certainly, the colon after Bosola's 'still', followed by the duchess completing his half-line, and the greater opportunity for deliberation in the metrical arrangement of the reply, will give a dramatically exciting impression of the duchess' composure even in the middle of her curses; by such changes of rhythm and 'transitions' of mood, the impression of great resources in a character's mind and spirit is often given in the theatre. By common consent we know that Webster delighted to use these devices, and so it behoves an editor of his plays to study every clue that will help to restore the original line-arrangement. Here a study of composition is well repaid. Another reason for an editor undertaking this research is the likelihood, attested in many kinds of investigation, that the solution of one bibliographical problem will set others in a new and clearer perspective. The editing of The Duchess of Malfi does benefit in this way. One of its problems is the authority of its stage-directions. There are comparatively few of them, as in some other plays with massed entries at the head of each scene. But one, ' A Coffin, Cords, and a Bell ' (K1 v ; Lucas, IV.ii.164-166) might derive from a prompt-book, while two others, 'Ferdinand giues her a ponyard ' (F4; III.ii.79-80) and ' Enter Bosola with a Guard ' (H4; III.v.110) were added during presscorrection, after some sheets had been printed, and might have been supplied by the author himself together with the corrections to dialogue and a marginal note which more surely indicate his responsibility. 4 Here the editor's new belief in the accuracy of the verse-lining of the printer's copy and his knowledge of the sequence of composition will encourage a reappraisal. He will notice that while both compositors were prepared to alter the verse-lining of their copy to accommodate the text cast off for a particular page, they set most of the book, like dramatic manuscripts in Ralph Crane's hand, with each new speech beginning a new line of type. Many times they could have countered inaccurate casting-off by starting a new speech in the same line as the conclusion of the previous one. But this they did not do until Sheet I. Clearly a firm printing-house decision was reversed at this point. The following table shows how both compositors availed themselves of this means of adjustment on pages after Il v . The numerals stand for the number of times, on the page indicated, a new speech begins in the same line of type as the last line, or part-line, of the previous speech. 1 v 2 1 2 v 3 v 4 3 4 v I 2 -- -- -- 6 -- 1 -- K -- -- 1 4 4 4 3 -- L 4 2 4 5 -- 2 1 3 M 5 4 1 2 -- -- -- -- Once introduced, this kind of space-saving was used repeatedly. For a few sheets casting-off was probably modified in order to take advantage of it; but when, half-way through sheet M, it became obvious that the text could be accommodated comfortably within one more sheet, the early rule of starting each speech with a new line seems to have been re-inforced. If continuous printing occurred only in the last five or six formes, it would seem that the procedure was modified in order to avoid using a further sheet or half-sheet; but the new arrangement was started uncertainly, and was used consistently in only three or four half-sheets immediately following the tentative change. These facts are relevant to a re-consideration of the authority of the stage-directions because the first four formes with continuous printing contain three directions, each beginning (as no others in the play) with the word ' Here . . .'. The setting of these directions suggest that they were added, like those found among the variants due to presscorrection, after the type had been set up. On I1 v the direction is printed: A dead-mans hand here? --- Here is discouer'd , ( behind a Trauers ;) the artificiall figures of Antonio, and his children; appearing as if they were dead . If this were added after composition of the text of the dialogue, two lines would have to be saved to accommodate it: and on this page two speeches are printed continuously (probably for the first time), saving two lines. On K1 the direction is printed: Soape-boyler costiue, it was my master-peece: --- Here the Daunce consisting of 8. Mad-men, with musicke answerable thereunto, after which , Bosola ( like an old man ) enters . Again if this were a late addition two lines would have to be saved: and on this page one speech is printed continuously, and there are 38 instead of 37 lines of type. (The last part-line, the signature and the catchword are all, quite exceptionally, set in one line of type.) On I4, the direction: Here ( by a Mad-men ) this song is sung, to a dismall kind of Musique . is centered, with a line's space each side, and is followed by the Madman's song, also in italic and running to within a one-line space of the full text-space for 37 lines. If the direction were added after the page was set up and if the compositor thought he should space it out to avoid confusion with the italicized song, four lines would have to be saved. In fact six lines are saved by continuous printing on the preceding page of 38 lines which, as we have seen, would have been set with I4. 5 It seems probable that the directions on I1 v and K1 were added after the text had been set up from the printer's copy, and possibly that on I4. There are no features in the setting of I3 or K2 v -4 which can suggest a reason for the tentative change from the procedure fixed from the start of the work. Besides massed entries at the head of scenes, a dumb-show and simple marks for exits, there are only 16 stage-directions in the quarto and, as we have seen, two of these are among the press-variants for which Webster was probably responsible, and three appear to be late additions. The other eleven may now be scrutinized afresh for signs that they too were additions to the first type-setting. The directions are: i. he kneeles (C3 v ; I.i.477) ii. Enter Antonio with a Pistoll . (G1 v ; III.ii.166) iii. she shewes the poniard . (G1 v ; III.ii.177-178) iv. giues her a dead mans hand . (I1 v ; IV.i.50-54) v. A Coffin, Cords, and a Bell . (K1 v ; IV.ii.164-166) vi. They strangle her . (K2 v ; IV.ii.243-244) vii. Shewes the children strangled . (K3; IV.ii.272-273) viii. she dies , (K4 v ; IV.ii.381) ix. He kills the Seruant . (N2 v ; V.v.46) x. He wounds the Cardinall, and ( in the scuffle ) giues Bosola his death wound . (N3; V.v.70-72) xi. He kills Ferdinand . (N3; V.v.83) None of these directions is in the formes (F inner, G outer and H inner) which have the 'Websterian' press-variants; but all except i are subsequent to F inner where Webster's attendance at the press has first been suspected. The one nearest to F inner is also remarkable for being the only one set on a line of type by itself, interrupting the dialogue. And it is on one of the three pages where Compositor A set 38 instead of 37 lines of type: like the three directions beginning ' Here . . .', this one could have been added after the page was set up but before any sheets were printed, being accommodated by using more than the usual text-space. Direction iv is placed, like others, to the right of the dialogue, but unlike them (and like the small type of the author's note added during press-correction on H2) it is not aligned with the rest of the type on the page: this direction could not have been set at the same time as the dialogue on which it comments; perhaps it also was added after the rest of the type had been set up, at the same time as the direction ' Here is discouer'd . . . .' which is on the same page. There is another kind of evidence for thinking that direction v was set in the same way. It occurs on a page where italic, capital B s were in short supply. One was available for the first prefix ' Bos. ', but by the 19th line, to the right of which the direction begins, three roman Bs had already been used and no more italic; after line 19, three more italic B s were called for by the copy but the compositor had to be content with roman, and on the next page set the roman exclusively. Yet in ' Bell ' of this stage-direction an italic B was used. It may have been set after the shortage of B s had been relieved, that is after the two pages of the inner forme in its half-sheet had been set up. Before investigations into type-shortages and the order of composition were undertaken, it was known that two stage-directions had been added after composition: now evidence has been found for believing that six more were similarly added, but before any surviving sheets had been printed off. These eight occur in the work of both compositors, so some source other than their copy must surely be posited. They might have been added because some printing-house corrector reversed a decision to omit some of the stage-directions found in the copy; but it is hard to believe that such crossed purposes would remain so long without being disentangled. Because we already believe that Webster visited the press to correct the printing of some formes, it is tempting to think that he was personally responsible for adding these stage-directions. There is nothing in the position or type-setting of the remaining eight directions which argues against the same origin and procedures for them, save only that ' he kneeles ' on C3 v would be a very isolated addition. If all sixteen were added in the same way, from the same source, only 9 formes would be involved out of 24. One further aid to the editor that can come from a close study of the type-setting of The Duchess of Malfi concerns punctuation. We know that, like Crane manuscripts and unlike other plays from Okes' printing-house at the same time, the quarto has more than usual numbers of colons and semi-colons, brackets and hyphens. A table showing the page-by-page fluctuations in the number of colons set, 6 especially if the pages of each half-sheet are arranged by formes, suggests that on certain pages the punctuation was influenced by type-shortages, and in some cases these apparent shortages coincide with those already noticed from less equivocal evidence. On L1-2 v , for example, the appearance of italic T on L2 and L1 suggests that a distribution of type was made on L1 after L1 v and L2 had been set, and the number of colons on individual pages varies in accordance with such a procedure. Compositor A usually set more than a dozen on each page, but here the figures are: L1 v L2 L1 L2 v 16 9 5 21 All but one of the colons on L1 occur after the second of the two incorrect T s. Sometimes an apparent shortage of colons is found on pages which also have fewer brackets or hyphens than most. L1 and 1 v , for example, have no hyphens at all, and L2 has 3; L2 v has 4. On M2 v both B s and Ws were in short supply, and on this page there are only two pairs of brackets (there are none on the preceding M1) and two hyphens, and no colons at all — it is the only page in the whole book without one. Type-shortages are indicated on K4 v by one roman B in a prefix and nine italic T s, and this suggests that the presence of only two pairs of brackets within the first 8 lines (there are none on the preceding K3) and no hyphen (there are only 2 at the top K3) are also due to type-shortage and not the printer's copy. There are 7 consecutive roman Bs in prefixes on L4 v and on this page there is a drop in the number of colons and no brackets (there are only one and a half pairs on L3 and none on L4). Such matters must be judged after long familiarity with the text, for the frequency of any mark of punctuation will vary according to the syntactical, rhetorical, metrical and dramatic qualities of the dialogue and to unknown variations in the scribe's, compositors' and, perhaps, author's techniques. But the editor of The Duchess of Malfi , bearing in mind the copy's heavy demand on type for certain marks of punctuation, may believe, on some exactly limited occasions, that if he is to punctuate his text responsibly he must consider the influence of typeshortage. A study of the printing of the play can influence his work in such minute and finely-judged details as these.</field>

It is just possible that the whole madman's song as it is printed in the quarto was an addition to the printer's copy, replacing four or five lines of dialogue or stage-direction on both pages. This hypothesis gains some support by: 1.) 7 lines are saved on I3 v and only four used on I4; 2.) on H2 a 'ditty' is printed where the printer's copy had announced 'The Hymne' and the author added an apologetic note after some sheets had been printed; the printer's copy may have been deficient in its songs as some dramatic texts of the period are; and 3.) the disconnected talk of the madmen might easily be cut without leaving traces. 6 One is printed in SB, VIII (1956), 127.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (VII) by Cyrus Hoy *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This monograph concludes with an account of Fletcher's presumptive collaborations with Shakespeare, only one of which has a place in the standard Beaumont and Fletcher canon. About Fletcher's share in The Two Noble Kinsmen , there is no real difficulty. The linguistic evidence is sufficient to point with reasonable clarity to the specific scenes of his authorship. Shakespeare's presence in the play will have to be proved on other than linguistic grounds. All that can be said is that the linguistic pattern displayed in the non-Fletcherian scenes that are generally attributed to him is not inconsistent with the pattern of linguistic preferences—in so far as there is one—exhibited in the acknowledged work of his last period. Since the case for Fletcher's presence in Henry VIII is, in large part, based on the widespread use of ye in the text of the 1623 Shakespeare folio, it has been deemed proper to close the present study of Fletcher's work in collaboration with an examination of the evidence—linguistic and other—for his share in that play: a share which, were it ever to be finally allowed, would constitute not the least of his latter-day claims to fame. The Two Noble Kinsmen Fletcher: II,2-6; III,3-6; IV; V,1a (to exit of Palamon and Knights), 2. Shakespeare: I; II,1; III,1-2; V,1b (from exit of Palamon and Knights to end), 3-4. The play was first published in quarto in 1634 with a title-page ascription to Shakespeare and Fletcher. There is linguistic evidence of a sort for the presence of Fletcher in the 37 ye 's sprinkled over seven scenes, which the quarto text displays. The attribution to Shakespeare of the non-Fletcherian scenes in The Two Noble Kinsmen has often been argued on the evidence of metrical tests and, more recently, of image clusters. 1 The case, based solely on stylistic grounds, is a strong one, and I think it abundantly supports the claim of the quarto titlepage that Shakespeare is a partial author of the play. I am assuming, at any rate, that he is. Some such assumption is necessary, for as will shortly appear, his presence in this or in any play of uncertain authorship must be determined on other than linguistic grounds. Shakespeare uses no language forms which, either in themselves or by virtue of their rate of occurrence, can serve to point immediately and unmistakably to his presence in a play of doubtful authorship. In the following analysis of the linguistic evidence to be derived from his unaided plays, I will proceed on the assumption that he is in fact Fletcher's collaborator in The Two Noble Kinsmen , and will confine myself to considering the extent to which the language practices displayed in his unaided work contrast with those displayed in the unaided work of Fletcher. This in turn will enable us to determine to what extent the shares of the two dramatists can be differentiated in a collaborated play, and thereby put us in a position to evaluate such evidence for the respective shares of their authorship as the quarto edition of The Two Noble Kinsmen contains. Linguistic evidence for nine of Shakespeare's plays is given in tabular form at the end of this section of the present study. The Tempest, The Winter's Tale, Cymbeline, Timon, Coriolanus , and Antony and Cleopatra are his last six plays, excluding the questionable Pericles , prior to 1613, the date of both the plays— The Two Noblc Kinsmen and Henry VIII —of which Shakespeare and Fletcher have been said to be joint authors. The remaining three Shakespearean plays that I have examined ( Troilus and Cressida, All's Well , and Measure for Measure ) represent his work at a slightly earlier period ( c. 1602-1604). 2 The problem of Shakespeare's linguistic practices is a vast one, necessarily involving as it does a complex of questions concerning the nature of the manuscript behind any one of the sundry printed texts of his plays, scribal influences where that manuscript is not an author's holograph, and compositorial habits reflected in the printed editions. Even when certain control factors are present, the resultant evidence is not always consistent. Antony and Cleopatra (1607) and Timon of Athens (1608) date from the same period of Shakespeare's career; each play was first printed in the 1623 Folio, where the copy for each is said to have been Shakespeare's foul papers (Greg, The First Folio , pp. 398-403, 408-411). The Folio text of each play was set in its entirety by Compositor B. 3 Yet we find the contraction ' em occurring a scant 3 times in Antony , and 20 times in Timon , while the contraction i'th' occurs but 3 times in Timon and 25 times in Antony . Sometimes Shakespeare's language practices contrast with Fletcher's, and sometimes they do not. When ' em is found occurring most frequently in a play of Shakespeare's, as in Timon (20 times) or The Tempest (17 times), there is little to distinguish the rate of its usage there from its occurrence in those plays of Fletcher's— Women Pleased (23 times), The Mad Lover (25 times) —in which ' em is found least frequently. The 42 occurrences of i'th' in Coriolanus markedly exceed the greatest number of occurrences of the same form in any one of Fletcher's unaided plays (28 in The Humourous Lieutenant ). Its occurrence in certain of Shakespeare's plays (e.g., The Winter's Tale and Cymbeline [20 times each], All's Well [14 times]) matches the use to which Fletcher puts it in certain of his (e.g., Rule a Wife [20 times], Bonduca and The Woman's Prize [14 times each]). And at the other end of the scale of usage, the practices of the two dramatists coincide as well (the 3 occurrences of i'th' in Timon have their parallel in the 4 i'th 's of Fletcher's A Wife for a Month ). Shakespeare's use of o'th' (which often occurs as a'th' ) 4 ranges, in the plays that I have examined, from the 2 o'th 's of Measure for Measure , to the 45 occurrences of both forms (29 a'th 's, 16 o'th 's) in Coriolanus . Here again, at the lower extremity, we find a coincidence with Fletcherian practice ( o'th' occurs but once in A Wife for a Month ); when a'th'/o'th' occur most frequently in the Shakespearean plays that I have examined—as in The Tempest ( o'th' 21 times), The Winter's Tale ( o'th' 23 times), Cymbeline ( o'th' 37 times), Coriolanus, antony ( a'th' once, o'th' 22 times) —the level of usage there equals or exceeds that revealed in Fletcher's unaided plays, where both forms occur no more than a combined total of 21 times (in the Lambarde manuscript of The Woman's Prize ). The upshot of all this is, simply, that (1) Shakespeare's use of 'em never exceeds Fletcher's, though in two plays ( The Tempest and Timon ) it comes close; (2) Shakespeare's use of i'th' in one play ( Coriolanus ) markedly exceeds Fletcher's, and in a number of other plays equals his; (3) Shakespeare's use of a'th' / o'th' in five plays ( The Tempest, The Winter's Tale, Cymbeline, Coriolanus, Antony ) equals or exceeds Fletcher's. But the most effective linguistic evidence for distinguishing the work of Shakespeare and Fletcher consists in Shakespeare's use of the third person singular verb forms hath and doth , and his general avoidance of pronominal ye. Doth is found but 3 times in a single one of Fletcher's unaided plays (in the Lambarde manuscript of The Woman's Prize ); it appears in all the plays of Shakespeare that I have examined, from the 5 occurrences of doth in Antony to the 36 occurrences of the form in the quarto text of Troilus . Fletcher uses hath no more than 6 times in a single play, and in two of his unaided works it does not occur at all. Hath occurs in all the Shakespearean plays that I have examined, and it is used with great frequency, from 26 times in The Tempest to 80 times in Cymbeline . Shakespeare uses ye in all nine of the plays considered below, but he uses it sparingly; it occurs no more than 8 times in a single play ( Coriolanus ); Timon , and the quarto text of Troilus exhibit 6 occurrences each; from there the occurrences of ye dwindle to the single instance of the form in Measure for Measure . When we turn to the linguistic evidence displayed in the non-Fletcherian scenes of the quarto text of The Two Noble Kinsmen , we find that, while it is certainly not sufficient in itself to establish Shakespeare's presence in the play, it accords very closely with the pattern of linguistic practices to be derived from the tables for his last plays given below. And, I would maintain, it contrasts with the linguistic pattern of Fletcher, which exists side by side with it in The Two Noble Kinsmen , in precisely the manner that Shakespeare's language practices, viewed as a whole in his last plays, contrast with the practices exhibited in the unaided plays of Fletcher. All of the quarto's 37 ye 's are Fletcher's; none occur in scenes that do not otherwise bear the signs of his stylistic manner. Hath is used 3 times in Fletcher's scenes, 13 times in non-Fletcherian ones. The 16 occurrences of ' em in the non-Fletcherian scenes fall below the 39 occurrences of the form in Fletcher's share of the play; the 10 occurrences of i'th' in the presumably Shakespearean scenes nearly approximate the 12 occurrences of the form in Fletcher's scenes; the 21 occurrences of o'th' in the non-Fletcherian portion of the play markedly exceed the 8 occurrences of the form in the Fletcherian portion. This is surely worth noting: that the use of 'em, i'th' , and o'th' in the two shares of The Two Noble Kinsmen —where the occurrence of 'em in the non-Fletcherian portion falls below the Fletcherian usage, i'th' nearly equals it, and o'th' exceeds it—is exactly comparable to the use of these forms demonstrated above in, respectively, the unaided work of Shakespeare and Fletcher. The contrasting practices of Shakespeare and Fletcher in the use of hath and ye complete the linguistic evidence for differentiating their shares in a play of their joint authorship. A word should be said regarding the low incidence of ye in the quarto text. It was the opinion of Greg ( The First Folio , p. 98) that the 1634 quarto of The Two Noble Kinsmen was "evidently printed from a prompt-copy written or at least annotated by Edward Knight." In a previous section of the present study ( SB , VIII, 139), I have drawn attention to the drastic reduction which the Fletcherian ye has undergone in Knight's transcript of Bonduca . If it could be assumed that he did, indeed, prepare the manuscript behind the quarto of The Two Noble Kinsmen , then an explanation for the low occurrence of ye in Fletcher's scenes would be readily at hand. Recently, however, in a previous volume of these Studies (XI, 61-84), Dr. F. O. Waller has suggested annotated foul papers as the copy for the quarto text. That the foul papers, if such they were, were annotated for use in the playhouse, is evident from a number of stage directions of distinctly theatrical origin that survive in the quarto print. Dr. Waller is aware of the obstacle that the diminished number of ye 's in Fletcher's scenes puts in the way of a theory of foul papers as quarto copy. The alternatives that he suggests by way of overcoming this are: (1) an hypothesis of mixed copy, consisting of the foul papers of Fletcher's collaborator, and a transcript of Fletcher's own scenes; and (2) an annotated intermediate scribal transcript. Any theory of foul papers as the immediate source of the quarto text is, I think, altogether untenable; the linguistic evidence will not support any such conjecture. And I am frankly dubious about Dr. Waller's statement ( SB , XI, 84) that "Fletcher seems to have given the text a final reworking." If he did give the text a final reworking—even such an "haphazard and incomplete" one as Dr. Waller has in mind—it seems odd that there are no ye 's in the non-Fletcherian scenes, and that the ye 's in Fletcher's own are so few. I think Dr. Waller's other alternative, an intermediate scribal transcript of the sort posited by Fredson Bowers ( On Editing Shakespeare and the Elizabethan Dramatists [1955], pp. 21-22), meets the conditions demanded by the linguistic facts of the case more satisfactorily than any other theory about the nature of the printer's copy for the quarto edition of the play. Henry VIII Fletcher: I,3-4; III,1; V,2-4. Shakespeare: I,1-2; II,3-4; III,2a (to exit of King); V,1. Fletcher and Shakespeare: II,1-2; III,2b (from exit of King to end); IV,1-2. Henry VIII has its place—and it remains secure when the disintegrators of Shakespeare have done their worst—in a greater canon than the Beaumont and Fletcher one, and it will perhaps seem gratuitous to introduce the question of its authorship here, at the end of the present study. But the question of Fletcher's share in the play is a perennially interesting one; and since the problem of his collaboration with Shakespeare has already been raised in connection with The Two Noble Kinsmen , it has seemed proper to proceed to an account of the second—and more famous—of the two plays in which the collaboration of the two dramatists has been presumed. Further, there is the fact that the evidence on which Fletcher's claim to a share in the authorship of Henry VIII must come finally to rest is, precisely, the very linguistic evidence on which the present effort to distinguish his work in collaboration with dramatists other than Shakespeare has been based. Even Mr. R. A. Foakes, the play's most recent editor, who is disinclined to accept Fletcher's presence in Henry VIII , admits so much ( Henry VIII , revised Arden Shakespeare [1957], pp. xix-xx). Mr. Foakes thinks that Heminge and Condell would not have included Henry VIII in the First Folio of 1623 had they not believed it to be entirely his; and Mr. Foakes finds further evidence for single authorship in the use of the chronicle materials that provide the play's sources; in the "unified, if special, conception and spirit" which the play exhibits; and in the play's "structure of imagery, which . . . cuts across the proposed authorship division and suggests a single mind at work" (pp. xxiii-xiv). To the arguments from the play's inclusion in the 1623 Folio, Prof. R. A. Law has made what must be the only effective reply. "Who," he says, "is ready to accredit the Bard with the Hecate lines in Macbeth ?" ("The Double Authorship of Henry VIII," Studies in Philology , LVI [1959], 487.) Prof. Law further counters Mr. Foakes's arguments for single authorship by invoking the authority of Lamb regarding Shakespeare and Fletcher's very different methods of handling imagery, and illustrating the practice with pertinent passages from Henry VIII ; he finds the source-material put to very different use in the two shares of the play; and he ends by quoting Ribner (who happens to hold with the theory of Shakespeare's sole authorship) to the effect that Henry VIII , far from exhibiting any particular structural unity, is in fact "a poorly-connected series of episodes." Two more opposite conclusions can hardly be reached from a single body of literary evidence, and one returns with something like relief to the statistical security of linguistic evidence. The linguistic evidence for authorship which the play affords has been examined in detail by A. C. Partridge ( The Problem of "Henry VIII" Reopened [1949], pp. 15-26). Suffice it to say at this point that the text of the play in the 1623 Shakespeare Folio reveals two distinct linguistic patterns: one marked by the occurrence of ye in eleven of the play's sixteen scenes, to a total of 71 times, 5 and a distinct preference for the contraction 'em to the expanded pronominal form them ; the second pattern is marked by the absence of ye , a preference for them to 'em , and the frequent use of hath which, with one exception (I.1) is never found in a scene containing ye . Since, as the linguistic tables given below for Shakespeare's last plays make very clear, ye is a form which he seldom employs, the great question is: how to account for the unparallel occurrence of ye in the Folio text of Henry VIII . It is not compositorial. The play, we now know from the forthcoming investigations of Dr. Charlton Hinman, was set by Compositor B and another compositor, who was not A but whom Dr. Hinman will identify. However, it is agreed that the distribution of ye in the Folio text accords not at all with the bibliographical units of the printed edition. 6 The form obviously stood in the manuscript from which the Folio text was printed, and so the question: what was the nature of the printer's copy for the Folio edition of Henry VIII . Greg ( First Folio , p. 425) said it "was clearly a carefully prepared manuscript, in whose hand or hands there is no evidence to show." Foakes ( SB , XI, 60) conjectures that the carefully prepared manuscript was "probably in a single hand," and finds evidence from variations in speech-headings that the manuscript "was based on foul papers." If the manuscript were in a single hand, was it a scribal transcript, or an author's fair copy? If one holds to the theory of single authorship, and posits a transcript, then the ye 's of the Folio print might perhaps be supposed to have entered the text through the offices of the scribe who prepared the copy. If one holds to the theory of single authorship, and posits an author's fair copy, then one must account for the Folio's ye 's by supposing either that (1) Shakespeare at the end of his career began frequently to employ a pronominal form that he had never displayed any fondness for in the past, or (2) that he had employed it in the past, but that elsewhere in the Folio Compositors B and his partner X who set the text of Henry VIII never managed to reproduce it on anything approaching the scale on which it appears in that play. If one holds to the theory of dual authorship, then of course the presence of the ye 's in the Folio text of Henry VIII poses no problem; they are there because they stood in the manuscript from which the Folio text of the play was printed, and they stood in that manuscript because one of the authors—who in such a theory would be Fletcher—put them there. There would be no way of proving that a scribe did not put them there were no additional evidence available to point in the direction of Fletcher; but as I will presently show, there is. For the moment we will consider Mr. Foakes's argument ( Henry VIII , p. xx) that the case for Fletcher's presence in the play, based on linguistic evidence, is weak because the pattern of usages displayed in the play is not "Fletcherian enough." He cites the low proportion of ye 's to you 's in the scenes claimed for Fletcher, and observes, rightly, that the incidence of ye falls suspiciously below normal Fletcherian practice. Driven to extremity, one could always posit the inevitable Knight transcript to account for this falling-off; but if the Folio copy was, as Greg would have it, "a carefully prepared manuscript," then Knight had nothing to do with it. In any case, another explanation is at hand; the occurrence of ye in the Folio text of the play seems clearly to have been affected by compositorial practice. This was demonstrated by the late Philip Williams in a previous volume of these Studies (VIII, 3-14). On the pages of Henry VIII set by Compositor B, Williams found a ratio of 208 you 's to 25 ye 's, or eight to one, while on the pages set by Compositor X (B's partner) he found a ratio of 191 you 's to 48 ye 's, or four to one. Williams identified the share of Compositor X as the work of Compositor A, as it had become traditional to do before Hinman; but since the division of the play between two compositors remains unchanged in the light of Hinman's findings, and since of the two it is the practice of Compositor B (whose share in setting the play Hinman confirms) that is in question, Williams' conclusions remain valid. He observed that "the ratio between you and ye is almost exactly twice as great on A [i.e., X] pages as it is on B pages" ( SB , VIII, 10). By the same token, Williams noted "that of the sixty-six 'em 's found in the text, fifty-five appear on pages set by Compositor A [i.e., X], and only eleven on pages set by Compositor B." 7 Mr. Foakes is aware ( Henry VIII , p. xxi) that Compositor B altered ye to you in Troilus and Cressida ; he does not seem to be aware of the extent to which Compositor B did so in Henry VIII , for he can say (p. xxii), by way of dismissing the argument "that the peculiarities assigned to different authors existed in the copy on which the Folio text is based": "However, we do not know how far, or in what differing degrees these compositors altered their copy for this particular play, or who was responsible for that copy." In view of Williams's statistics, I would suggest that only the last part of this statement is entirely true. What Mr. Foakes failed to realize is that Compositor B's known tendency to alter ye 's to you 's serves, by providing an explanation for the relatively low occurrence of ye in Henry VIII , to remove his own objection that the purportedly Fletcherian language usages in the play "are not Fletcherian enough." If Compositor B, or any other compositor in the Shakespeare Folio, were ever found changing you 's to ye 's, then the principal linguistic argument for Fletcher's share in the play would go up in smoke. Given Compositor B's known habit regarding ye , one can hardly expect the chief feature of Fletcherian linguistic usage to appear in undiminished abundance in the printed text of any play on which he worked. I think that the truth about Fletcher's share in Henry VIII is to be found where truth generally is: midway between the extreme views that have traditionally been held regarding it. Those who would deny his presence in the play altogether are wrong to do so, for he is assuredly there. Those who award him ten and one-half of the play's sixteen scenes (the usual ascription) claim too much. In a number of these (e.g., II,1-2; IV,1-2), I am convinced that Fletcher has done nothing more than touch up a Shakespearean passage, or insert a passage of his own in a Shakespearean context. If the occurrence of ye in the opening line of the play means anything, he might be observed doing just this at the outset of I,1, a scene that has never been claimed for him. I,3 and I,4 have been claimed for Fletcher. I,3 contains no ye 's, but since you occurs but twice in the course of the scene, the absence of ye is hardly significant. There are 4 ye 's evenly distributed throughout I,4, a surprisingly low number in view of that scene's 23 you 's. Both scenes were set by Compositor X, who seems to have reproduced the Fletcherian 'em accurately enough: 7 times in I,3, where them does not occur; 12 times in I,4, where them is used once. How to account for the low proportion of ye 's to you 's in I,4, I do not know. I only know that, because they are distributed throughout the scene (at lines 2, 50, 63, and 86 of Alexander's edition) they provide better evidence for regarding that scene as wholly Fletcher's than do the 4 ye 's of the following II,1, found at lines 1, 130, 131, and 132 of Alexander's edition. So with the 3 ye 's of II,2, which occur at lines 68, 69, and 137. In both scenes, we are again dealing entirely with the work of Compositor X, and there is no reason to suppose that there were more ye 's in his copy than those he set in print. I think that the ye 's of II,1-2 represent Fletcher, but I regard them as Fletcherian interpolations in scenes that in all other respects are Shakespeare's. III,1 provides the strongest linguistic evidence of Fletcher's presence to this point in the play. It also provides a striking example of differences in the practice of two compositors. The scene in the Folio occupies sigs. v3 v and v4 r . Sig. v3 v was set by Compositor X. It contains 13 ye 's, 14 you 's. Sig. v4 r was set by Compositor B. It contains 7 ye 's, 16 you 's. The first 203 lines of III,2 (to the exit of the King) are universally regarded as Shakespeare's; the last half of the scene is often attributed to Fletcher. In it ye , which has not appeared in the Shakespearean portion, occurs 6 times. The occurrence is suspiciously low in proportion to the 37 you 's found in this presumably Fletcherian half of the scene. Since we are here dealing with the work of Compositor B, there is of course the strong possibility that a number of Fletcher's ye 's have been changed to you 's. Still, I find the distribution of such occurrences of ye as are present suspicious; it is too reminiscent of the distribution of ye in II,1-2. The 6 instances of the form appear at lines 239, 240, 241, 242, 278, and 365, and that being so, I am not at all sure that one is justified in attributing to Fletcher the superb speeches made by Wolsey after his fall. I think that what we are dealing with is, once again, Fletcherian interpolations in a scene that is essentially Shakespeare's. The work of Compositor B continues throughout Act IV, which is generally assigned in its entirety to Fletcher. I seriously doubt that he has much claim to it. It is not simply that the act, as a whole, contains only 8 ye 's as against 33 you 's; the presence of Compositor B could provide a sufficient explanation for that. It is the manner in which the ye 's of the act fall into little clusters which convinces me that here, as elsewhere in the play, we are dealing with Fletcher the interpolator and not Fletcher the original author. The 3 ye 's of IV,1 occur in a clump in the last four lines (114,115,117) of the scene. Of the 5 ye 's of IV,2, one occurs at line 22, the remaining four are found together at lines 83 (which contains two of them), 84, and 86. The distinction to be noted between the occurrence of ye in single isolated clusters within a scene, and its periodic occurrence throughout the whole of a scene, is I think of considerable importance for the authorial evidence that attaches to the form. The distinction is particularly important in the case of the present play where the tendency in the past too often has been to attribute to Shakespeare's collaborator whole scenes of Shakespeare's own in which the collaborator has done little more than interpolate a handful of lines of his own, or touch up after his own fashion occasional passages of the original author's. Perhaps we can best appreciate this distinction when we move from Act IV of Henry VIII , where I am convinced the traces of Fletcher that are discernible are mere interpolations, to the last three scenes of Act V, of which I am equally convinced he is the sole author. These, together with III,1, constitute his strongest claim to a share in the play. With V,2-4 we are back in the presence of Compositor X once more, and the traces of ye become much stronger: 12 in V,2 (as against 42 you 's), 7 in V,3 (13 you 's), 6 in V,4 (3 you 's). The weakness in my theory of Fletcher as an interpolator in certain scenes of Henry VIII , and as the sole author of others, is that so many of the scenes (III,2b; IV,1-2) wherein the linguistic evidence points, in my opinion, to mere Fletcherian interpolation were set by Compositor B. It might be argued that the small clusters of ye 's in these scenes are all that Compositor B has preserved of a more pervasive Fletcherian linguistic pattern. If all the scenes which have been claimed for Fletcher alone in the past, but which I would write-off as containing Fletcherian interpolations merely, were set in print by Compositor B, I would be properly hesitant about urging any such theory regarding his presence in the play. But at least two scenes (II,1-2) set by Compositor X contain just such odd clusters of ye 's as are to be found in Compositor B's IV,1-2; and there is no reason to suppose that Compositor X tampered with the ye 's that stood in his copy. He seems not to have done so, at any rate, in the section of III,1 that he set, nor has he done so throughout V,2-4. Finally, the best non-linguistic evidence for Fletcher's presence in Henry VIII (evidence which makes it possible, I think, to view the ye 's of the Folio text as valid signs of his presence) is all contained in the six scenes (I,3-4; III,1; V,2-4) which, as the linguistic evidence implies, are wholly his. There are no convincing traces of Fletcher's syntactic or rhetorical practices in the scenes in which the linguistic evidence suggests mere Fletcherian interpolation. Some examples of these practices had best be cited by scene. (a) This night he makes a supper, and a great one, (I,3,52). The Fletcherian structure of such a line as this has been noted in a previous section of the present study ( SB , XIII, 96, where some examples are cited from Fletcher's unaided plays). (b) O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too. (I,4,28) The repetition with different modifiers, and the use of "too," is typically Fletcherian. Compare the following from his unaided work: "This worme that crept into ye has abus'd ye, / Abus'd your fathers care, abus'd his faith too" ( The Loyal Subject , II,5); "tis a Ring: a pretty Ring, a right one: / A ring I know too! the very same Ring" ( The Pilgrim , IV,1); "modest to the world too, wondrous modest" ( A Wife for a Month , IV,1). (c) Noble lady, I am sorry my integrity should breed, And service to his Majesty and you, So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant. (III,1,50-53) These lines of Wolsey's to Katharine seem to have given trouble to past editors. Foakes, in his note on the passage in the New Arden edition, observes that Singer transposed lines 52-53, thereby "giving a smooth flow to the sense." But in Foakes's opinion, "they seem to indicate a dramatic intention—Wolsey thinks first of his own selfimportance, his intrinsic worth, then mentions, as a second thought, and in parenthesis, his service to others." The fact is, the construction— wherein the elements of a compound subject ("integrity," "And service") are separated by an intervening verb phrase ("should breed") — is distinctly Fletcherian, and I would submit that there is no stronger evidence for Fletcher's presence in Henry VIII than the occurrence in the play of this particular syntactic arrangement. In the passage in question, it makes for an extreme parenthetical inversion, but so it often does in Fletcher's unaided plays. Compare the following: I still weeping till old time had turn'd me, And pitying powers above into pure christall ( A Wife for a Month , IV,1) These noble thoughts sir, have intic'd us forward, And minds unapt for ease to see these miracles, ( The Island Princess , I,1) those great deserts The King hath layd up of ye, and the people, ( The Mad Lover , I,1) there is nothing now but truth to save me, And your forgivenesse ( Valentinian , IV,4). The verb phrase of the passages above may become but a single finite verb, as in the following: Thou point to which my life turnes, and my fortune, ( Women Pleased , I,1) All heavens care [be] upon yee, and my prayers ( The Chances , III,1). (d) Take heed, for heaven's sake take heed, lest at once The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye. (III,1,110-111) The admonition, twice repeated (sometimes oftener), is frequent in Fletcher. Compare the following: "Take heed, take heed young Ladies: still take heed" ( The Loyal Subject , IV,3); "Take heed for honours sake take heed" ( The Mad Lover , IV,1); "Take heed, by all our love take heed" ( Valentinian , III,3). (e) Would you have me— If you have any justice, any pity, If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits— Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me? Alas! has banish'd me his bed already, His love too long ago! (III,1,115-120) Have I liv'd thus long—let me speak myself, Since virtue finds no friends—a wife, a true one? A woman, I dare say without vain-glory, Never yet branded with suspicion? Have I with all my full affections Still met the King, lov'd him next heav'n, obey'd him, Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him, Almost forgot my prayers to content him, And am I thus rewarded? (III,1,125-133) Was it discretion, lords, to let this man, This good man—few of you deserve that title— This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy At chamber door? and one as great as you are? (V,3,137-140) All princely graces That mould up such a mighty piece as this is, With all the virtues that attend the good, Shall still be doubled on her. Truth shall nurse her, Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her; She shall be lov'd and fear'd. Her own shall bless her: Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn, And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her; In her days every man shall eat in safety Under his own vine what he plants, and sing The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours. (V,5,25-35) Katharine is the speaker in the first two of these passages, Henry in the third, Cranmer in the last. Anyone who is familiar with Fletcher's rhetorical cascades cannot fail to recognize his manner in all of them. The manner consists in a number of separate devices, all evident here: the highly compressed syntax (n.b. III,1,118-120 and 129-132); the towering spiral of appositives, each dilating in its small way on the subject at hand (e.g., III,1,125-128; V,3,137-139); the parenthetical insertions in the first three passages; the use of what Puttenham would term "Antistrophe" ("when ye make one word finish many verses in sute, and . . . to finish many clauses in the middest of your verses" 8 ) at III,1,130-132, and regularly throughout Cranmer's christening speech. The use of "too" at III,1,120 is comparable to its use at I,4,28, discussed above. The verbal sequence at the end of III,1,126 ("a wife, a true one") is similar to the rhetorical formula noted in Fletcher's unaided work in a previous section of the present study ( SB , XIII, 101). The passages just discussed provide a fair measure of the Fletcherian quality of the verse in those scenes of Henry VIII which I regard as solely his. The syntactic and rhetorical practices which they display, taken together with the linguistic evidence of the Folio text, establish his claim to a share in the play's authorship. This will never be granted by those who are bent on viewing Henry VIII as entirely Shakespeare's, but the burden of proof is on those who would deny Fletcher's presence there. They will have to explain two things. (1) how it is that, at the end of his career, the quality of Shakespeare's verse becomes at times, as any one of the passages cited above will prove, so distinctly Fletcherian as to have, demonstrably, more in common with the verse of The Loyal Subject than with that of The Tempest ; and (2) how it is that, at the end of his career, the quality of Shakespeare's language practices becomes at times, as the linguistic evidence for Henry VIII will prove, so distinctly Fletcherian that the Bard is found spelling you , ye , à la Fletcher, to an extent that he had never, apparently, done before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ii Now that all the linguistic evidence is in, we may proceed to tabulate our findings by way of conclusion. The shares of Fletcher and his collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher canon stand as follows. Fletcher alone (15 plays): Bonduca , The Chances , The Island Princess , The Humourous Lieutenant , The Loyal Subject , The Mad Lover , Monsieur Thomas , The Pilgrim , Rule a Wife and Have a Wife , Valentinian , A Wife for a Month, Women Pleased, The Wild Goose Chase , The Woman's Prize (plus The Faithful Shepherdess , not included in the present study for reasons stated in SB , VIII, p. 142). Fletcher and Massinger (11 plays): Barnavelt , The Custom of the Country , The Double Marriage , The Elder Brother , The False One , The Little French Lawyer , The Lovers' Progress , The Prophetess , The Sea Voyage , The Spanish Curate , A Very Woman . Fletcher and Beaumont (9 plays): The Captain , The Coxcomb , Cupid's Revenge , A King and no King, The Maid's Tragedy, The Noble Gentleman, Philaster, The Scornful Lady , The Woman Hater . Fletcher, Beaumont, and Massinger (3 plays): Beggars' Bush, Love's Cure , Thierry and Theodoret . Fletcher, Beaumont, and Jonson (1 play): Love's Pilgrimage . Fletcher, Massinger, Jonson, and Chapman (1 play): Rollo , Duke of Normandy . Fletcher and Field (1 play): Four Plays , or Moral Representations , in One . Fletcher, Field, and Massinger (3 plays): The Honest Man's Fortune , The Knight of Malta , The Queen of Corinth . Fletcher and Shirley (1 play): The Night Walker . Fletcher, plus an unidentified reviser (1 play): Wit Without Money . Fletcher and Rowley (1 play): The Maid in the Mill . Fletcher and Middleton (1 play): The Nice Valour . Fletcher, Massinger, Webster, and Ford (1 play): The Fair Maid of the Inn . Fletcher and Shakespeare (2 plays): The Two Noble Kinsmen , Henry VIII . Fletcher is wholly absent from three plays in the corpus: Beaumont's The Knight of the Burning Pestle , Wit at Several Weapons (attributed to Middleton and Rowley), The Laws of Candy (attributed to Ford). Of the fifty-four plays considered in the course of this study, Fletcher then is the sole or partial author of fifty-one. Massinger, whose share in the corpus is second only to Fletcher's, as Sir Aston Cockaine pointed out long ago, is present as reviser or collaborator in nineteen plays. Beaumont is the sole or partial author of fourteen, Field the partial author of four. Jonson, Middleton, Rowley, and Ford are each present in two plays; Shirley and Webster are each present in one. Shakespeare is present in one of the plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher canon, and Fletcher is present in one of the plays of the Shake-speare canon. Chambers, surveying the authorship of the Beaumont and Fletcher canon in 1923, thus adjudged previous efforts at dealing with the problem: "the process of metrical analysis initiated by Fleay and Boyle may be regarded as fairly successful in fixing the characteristics of the very marked style of Fletcher, although it certainly raises more questions than it solves as to the possible shares not only of Massinger, but of Jonson, Field, Tourneur, Daborne, Middleton, Rowley, and Shirley, as collaborators or revisers, in the plays as they have come down to us" ( The Elizabethan Stage , III, 216). For all that the linguistic evidence can accomplish, the shares of certain of the dramatists that Chambers named must remain problematic. Linguistic evidence cannot establish Jonson's presence in Rollo , or Middleton's in The Nice Valour . But it can, at the very least, confirm or deny assumptions based on other evidence regarding a given dramatist's share in a play of uncertain authorship. Thus linguistic evidence can confirm the assumption, based on non-linguistic evidence, that Jonson is a partial author of Rollo , that Middleton is the principal author of The Nice Valour , that Shakespeare is present in The Two Noble Kinsmen . It can rid us of the assumption, based on non-linguistic evidence, that either Tourneur or Webster is present in The Honest Man's Fortune , or that Daborne has a share in any play of the canon (the latter dramatist has not been included in this study because an analysis of the linguistic pattern displayed in The Poor Man's Comfort and A Christian Turned Turk makes it clear that he cannot be present in any play of the corpus, the authorship of which is in question). With linguistic evidence it is all, finally, a matter of more or less, as this essay in evaluating it, and applying it to the authorial problem which the Beaumont and Fletcher canon poses, will have abundantly indicated. There is linguistic evidence of a modest sort for attributing Wit at Several Weapons to Middleton and Rowley; there is linguistic evidence of a more decisive sort for tracing Shirley's revising hand in The Night Walker ; there is linguistic evidence of the most decisive sort of all for determining the work of Fletcher in virtually all the plays where he is taken as being present. And having reached a decisive means of determining the work of Fletcher, we are in a position to determine with equal decisiveness the collaborated work of Massinger, because his language practices are so thoroughly at variance with Fletcher's, and because very nearly all of his work in collaboration was done with Fletcher. It remained for linguistic evidence to show what metrical evidence never showed: that it is possible to distinguish the work of Fletcher and Massinger on the basis of fundamentally different language practices. To demonstrate just how fundamental this difference is, and how decisively it will serve to differentiate their work in collaboration, has been the most signal achievement of this study. On the basis of it, I will venture to make a large claim. There is no longer any mystery about Massinger's share in the plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher canon. That beng so, it will no longer be excusable for the author of a book on Massinger to decline to consider his work in collaboration on the plea that, Massinger being "deeply involved in the tangled undergrowth of collaboration which surrounds the Beaumont-Fletcher corpus ," to do so would call "for a preliminary volume quite away from [the author's] purposes," and would only end by "confus[ing] the reader and obscur[ing] the object of [the] study, Massinger himself." 9 Massinger is present in nineteen plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher corpus. Their titles are given in the tabulation above, and his share in each of them is shown with all the clarity that numbers can yield in the several sections of this monograph. 10 Linguistic Tables for Unaided Plays by Shakespeare * ye y' hath doth 'em them i'th' i'the a'th' o'th' o'the h'as 's his ha' t' Temp. 5 26 13 17 42 16 21 1 4 WT 3 1 42 7 6 61 20 23 1 8 3 Cym. 4 1 80 20 2 70 20 37 14 1 Tim. 6 6 29 9 20 66 3 2 10 5 2 4 Cor. 8 5 51 9 14 128 42 29 16 3 14 3 3 Ant. 4 4 43 5 3 53 25 1 22 3 4 2 Tro. 6 60 36 43 11 5 1 3 1 1 Meas. 1 2 71 24 41 7 1 2 1 2 AWEW 4 4 52 6 5 50 14 9 3 8 1 The Two Noble Kinsmen — Q 1634 ye y' you hath doth 'em them i'th' o'th' h'as 's his t' I,i: 35 2 1 2 5 1 5 1 -,ii: 6 3 1 1 3 3 -,iii: 1 9 1 1 2 1 1 1 -,iv: 2 1 5 3 -,v: 1 TOTAL: I 1 53 7 1 9 11 5 9 1 1 II,i: 6 3 3 2 --,ii: 7 30 1 10 --,iii: 2 7 1 3 1 1 --,iv: --,v: 4 34 --,vi: 1 TOTAL: II 9 4 78 1 14 3 5 1 1 III,i: 1 24 1 2 1 4 ---,ii: 1 1 1 ---,iii: 20 1 1 ---,iv: 1 1 1 ---,v: 8 1 18 1 2 3 ---,vi: 11 60 10 1 1 TOTAL: III 19 3 123 2 11 5 3 11 IV,i: 2 1 26 4 2 --,ii: 8 11 3 1 --,iii: 10 2 1 1 1 TOTAL: IV 2 1 44 2 15 6 1 2 V,i (a): 3 6 2 1 -,i (b): 3 2 2 -ii: 4 1 39 5 1 1 -,iii: 16 2 4 2 3 -,iv: 18 4 2 2 TOTAL: V 7 1 82 4 6 6 8 8 1 TOTAL: 37 10 380 16 1 55 31 22 29 5 1 Henry VIII — F (Shakespeare) 1623 ye y' you hath doth 'em them i'th' o'th' h'as 's his t' ha' I,i: 1 22 5 2 5 1 5 1 2 -,ii: 24 3 1 2 5 1 3 3 -,iii: 2 7 1 1 -,iv: 4 4 23 12 1 1 TOTAL: I 5 4 71 8 1 23 11 3 9 1 4 2 II,i: 4 20 4 --,ii: 3 12 1 2 1 --,iii: 1 25 1 2 --,iv: 2 50 3 2 4 3 1 TOTAL: II 7 3 107 5 6 3 4 3 3 III,i: 20 30 5 ---,ii (a): 38 7 1 1 3 4 4 4 ---,ii (b): 6 37 1 2 1 1 1 TOTAL: III 26 105 8 1 8 4 5 4 5 IV,i: 3 1 13 3 1 1 1 --,ii: 5 20 3 2 1 TOTAL: IV 8 1 33 6 3 2 1 V,i: 1 41 3 4 2 4 1 1 -,ii: 12 1 42 6 1 1 -,iii: 7 2 13 13 1 3 1 -,iv: 6 1 3 1 1 TOTAL: V 25 5 99 3 20 4 4 8 1 1 1 1 TOTAL: 71 13 415 24 2 63 25 18 25 2 10 6 1</field>

See Greg ( First Folio , pp. 342, 353, 403, 411, 407). Regarding the copy for the quarto text of Troilus , however, see Walker ( Textual Problems , p. 82). 5 My figures and Prof. Partridge's do not always agree, in part because he has included the Prologue and Epilogue in his count, while I have regularly omitted these from my tabulations in the present study. 6 R. A. Foakes, "On the First Folio Text of Henry VIII ," Studies in Bibliography , XI (1958), 57. The shares of the two compositors as set forth in Foakes's table (p. 55) are confirmed by Hinman, whose findings affect only the identity of the compositor wrongly identified by Foakes as Compositor A. Sigs. x4 r and x4 v (the last leaf of the play), unaccounted for in Foakes's table, according to Hinman were set by this compositor. 7 Everyone who has counted the 'em 's in the play has arrived at a different total.

      <field name="heading_text">National Library of Scotland and Edinburgh University Library Copies of Plays in Greg's Bibliography of the English Printed Drama by Marion Linton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The following list is intended as an appendix to Greg's Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration , showing the plays to be found in two Scottish libraries, the National Library of Scotland and Edinburgh University Library. Many of the National Library plays were acquired as recently as 1956 as part of the Bute Collection, of which the Shakespearean Quartos are described in the Bartlett and Pollard Census under the designation of Crichton Stuart. There were already, however, a considerable number of early plays in the library's general collections, many of them the gift of a member of Faculty, John Maitland Thomson, in 1912, when the National Library was still the Library of the Faculty of Advocates. Many of the University Library plays belong to the Shakespearean collection presented by J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps in the seventies of last century, but some of the most interesting come from the library of the poet William Drummond of Hawthornden. The information given in each entry is in six parts. 1. The Greg number with, where necessary, letters, numbers and symbols showing edition, issue and variant state, but omitting A (which indicates a single edition) except where it is followed by a number or symbol. 2. The author's last name. Double authorship is shown by the two surnames linked by a hyphen, and this form is used also for author and translator. Plays written in collaboration by more than two authors are entered under the name of the first author with etc. For a play published anonymously or under initials, the author has been supplied when possible, the name being followed by a question mark when the attribution is doubtful. Otherwise the play is entered under the title or initial. 3. The short title in the form used by Greg. Plays with alternative titles are under the title of the edition concerned. 4. The date of the edition described. 5. The location of the copies. NLS indicates the general collections of the National Library, NLSB the Bute Collection, and EU the Edinburgh University Library. 6. A brief description, where necessary, of the condition of the copy, immediately following its location. All missing leaves are noted, including blank leaves, and all serious imperfections. Cropping has not been mentioned, except when it affects the text throughout; where only one or two leaves are cropped, they are noted as defective. Mounted leaves and inlaid copies have been mentioned. Leaves supplied in facsimile have been indicated by the abbreviation ' facs. ' which should be understood as applying to all the missing leaves listed before it. The minus sign has been used for missing blank leaves, and 'wants' for all other missing leaves. The presence of blank leaves is noted, by the plus sign, only for blanks not in copies examined by Greg. Aberrations in binding are not invariably noted, but have been mentioned sometimes, when they seemed of special interest. When there are two copies in one collection, they have been shown as '1-2', unless they require different descriptions, when Greg has been followed in the use of a vertical dividing line, e.g. NLS (1,—A1|2, wants B4). The same principle has been followed for more than two copies. The abbreviations used are mostly as in Greg. The following are the most common. def. = defective facs. = supplied in facsimile impt. = imprint mtd. = mounted s.-n. = side-notes I am grateful to the authorities of the Edinburgh University Library for giving me every facility to examine the plays there, and in particular to Dr. Robert Donaldson (now of Glasgow University Library) for his very generous co-operation, but for any errors and omissions in the descriptions of the Edinburgh Library plays, as in the National Library copies, I am solely responsible. 66a* Churchyard, Entertainment in the City of Bristow , 1575.

(110e) This copy confirms Greg's suggestion that in the copy in the Huntington Library, the only one he had seen, the title has been supplied from the previous edition. The transcription of the title of this copy is as follows:— THE | Spanish Tragedie: | Contayning the lamen- | table end of Don Horatio , and Bel-imperia : | with the pittifull death of olde | Hieronimo . | Newly corrected, amended, and enlarged with new | additions of the Painters part, and others: as it | hath of late been diuers times acted. | [device] | Imprinted at London by W.W. for | T. Pauier , and are to be solde at his | shoppe at the entrance | into the Exchange. | 1603. The verso is blank and the title is conjugate. Note 2. (204b) This copy is described by Greg in volume IV of the Bibliography, p.1647. Note 3. The general title has been prefixed to a collection of separate editions of seven of Ford's plays, namely The Lover's Melancholy , 1629, [420A*], ' Tis Pity She's a Whore , 1633 [486A1], The Broken Heart , 1633 [480], Love's Sacrifice , 1633 [478], Perkin Warbeck , 1634 [491A*], The Fancies , 1638 [532] and The Lady's Trial , 1639 [555]. These are entered in the list of separate plays. There seems little doubt that this is a companion volume to the nonce collections of Marston and Chapman described by Greg and in the Pforzheimer Catalogue. The wording of the title corresponds exactly except for the author's name. The volume probably came to the Advocates' Library (as the National Library of Scotland then was) about the end of the 18th century, and it may be the volume sold at the Richard Wright Sale of 23rd April 1787. The contents correspond with those of a volume of Ford's plays described in the Wright sale catalogue, though the catalogue entry does not mention a general title. The only known copies of the Marston and Chapman collections, now broken up, are known to have been in the Wright sale. The Ford collection is in a brown leather binding, and has a coat of arms stamped in gold on the front and back covers. The arms, and the signature on the last page of Love's Sacrifice , are those of the 17th century antiquary Walter Chetwynd of Ingestre in Stafford-shire, and are perhaps a clue to the identity of the collector for whom all three volumes were bound.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Scottish Printers and Booksellers 1668-1775: A Second Supplement (II) by Robert Hay Carnie *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHNSTON (GEORGE), running stationer in Edinburgh, 1754. It was stated in the John Fraser entry that George Johnston was tried for hamesucken on 9th. December, 1754. He was sentenced to be whipped through the city of Edinburgh. (S.M., Dec., 1754, p. 592.) JOHNSTON (W.), bookseller in Linton, 1749. Johnston is one of the many booksellers whose name appears in the imprint of a work entitled A Short Essay to answer the Arguments moved to promote carrying a Separation from the True Associate Synod . This work was printed by William Gray of Edinburgh. (St. A.U.L.) KEITH (CHARLES), merchant and bookseller in Montrose, 1775. Keith seems to have commenced in business in 1775. He sold, in January of that year, a work entitled A Scots Poem to the Memory of a Horsedealer . The book was also sold by J. Chalmers &amp; Company, Aberdeen. (A.J., Jan. 16, 1775.) KELLOCH (MATHEW), merchant and bookseller in the Parish of Greenock, 1739. In August, 1739, there is an advertisement in The Caledonian Mercury for A new and correct Edition of the Decerpta of Ovid's Metamorphoses . . . . Designed for the Use of Schools . This work was to be sold by John Traill and William Hamilton, Booksellers in Edinburgh, Andrew Stalker and John Barry, Booksellers in Glasgow, and Mathew Kelloch, Merchant in Crawford's Dike in the Parish of Greenock. (C.M., Aug. 30, 1739.) KER (ANDREW), bookseller in Kelso, 1745. Ker had printed for him in Edinburgh The Triple Testimony to the Truth of Christianity. A Sermon by Thomas Boston . This work was sold by Ker in Kelso. (C.M., May 13, 1745.) KER (COLIN), inkmaker and stationer in Edinburgh, 1750. Ker's shop was called 'The Hand and Pen', and was situated below the foot of Blackfriar's Wynd, in the Cowgate, Edinburgh. (C.M., June 21, 1750; Nov. 1, 1750.) KER (J.), bookseller in Selkirk, 1747. This Ker was one of the many provincial booksellers who sold The Acts and Proceedings of the Associate Synod . (St. A.U.L.; A.U.L.) LEECHMAN (G.), bookseller in Irvine, 1749. Both The Aberdeen Journal and The Caledonian Mercury advertised the proposals for printing in six volumes by subscription The Works of Flavius Josephus . Subscriptions were taken in by Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Perth and Dundee booksellers; by Grierson at Dumfries and by Leechman at Irvine. (C.M., Oct. 5, 1749; A.J., Oct. 24, 1749.) LEGAT (ALEXANDER), merchant and bookbinder in Glasgow, 1773. Legat was made Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow as younger lawful son to the deceased Alexander Legat, barber in Glasgow. (B. &amp; G.B. 1751-1846, p. 81.) LEIGHTON (-----), bookseller in Dundee, 1768. Leighton is listed in The Scots Magazine as selling the first two numbers of The Works of that eminent servant of Christ, Mr John Bunyan . . . in Six Volumes . This work was printed for David Ogilvy, bookseller in Dundee, by Sands, Murray and Cochran in 1769. (Copy in E.U.L.; S.M., Jan., 1768.) LITHGOW (JAMES), papermaker at Upper Spylaw, Colinton, 1682. Waterston tells us that James Lithgow was accused of enticing a workman away from the paper mill of Alexander Daes, and having clandestinely obtained a license to make playing cards in 1682. (Waterston O.E.C. XXVII, 42-43.) LITHGOW (NICOL), papermaker at Bogsmill, 1717-1756. The Bogsmill paper mill was situated on the Water of Leith, a mile below Colinton. Nicol Lithgow converted the existing corn mill into a paper mill. In 1735 the notes for the Bank of Scotland were made there. The lease was acquired by Gavin Hamilton, the bookseller, in 1756. (Cf. Bushnell, p. 317.) (Waterston O.E.C., XXV, 70; XXVII, 50-51.) LOW (ALEXANDER), bookseller in Ayr, 1771. Joseph Galbraith published in The Caledonian Mercury proposals dated Glasgow, May 9, 1771, for an elaborate edition of The Holy Bible to be published in three-weekly numbers. Subscriptions were taken in by, among others, Alexander Low, bookseller in Ayr. (C.M., June 5, 1771.) LUNDIN (T.), bookseller in Glasgow, 1747. This Glasgow bookseller is the only Glasgow name to be found in the imprint of The Acts and Proceedings of the Associate Synod which was printed in Edinburgh by William Gray in 1747. (St. A.U.L.; A.U.L.) LYALL (-----), bookseller in Montrose, 1762. The enterprising Kilmarnock bookseller and publisher, James Meuros, put out proposals dated Dec. 1, 1762, for printing by subscription Stackhouse's New History of the Holy Bible in six volumes. Amongst the people taking subscriptions for this work 'Mr Lyall, Bookseller in Montrose.' (A.J., June 27, 1763.) McBRAIN (COLIN), papermaker in Cathcart, Glasgow, previous to 1760. John Downie, a founder in Gorbals, was made a Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow on 26 Sept., 1760, by right of his marriage to Helen, lawful daughter to the deceased Colin McBrain, papermaker in Cathcart, who had neglected to enter in his own lifetime. (B. &amp; G.B., 1751-1846, p. 37.) McCULLOCH (ALEXANDER), bookbinder in St. Andrews, 1723-1744. McCulloch, who was Archbeadle to St. Andrews University, was binding books for them from 1723. On 20 Jan., 1731, he was made a freeman of the Hammerman Craft as a bookbinder. McCulloch died in 1744. (Hammerman Book; Library—Quaestor Accounts, St. A.U.L.) McDONALD (ALEXANDER), bookseller in Aberdeen, 1740-1753. McDonald sold books in conjunction with William Murray in 1740. In Jan., 1745, he sold a pamphlet called An Instructive Historical Account of the Settlement of the Episcopal Congregation in Dundee, 1727 . In 1753 he sold A Letter from a Merchant . . . to a Member of Parliament . (E.E.C., Sept. 30, 1740; C.M., Jan. 31, 1745; A.J., Dec. 4, 1775.) McEUEN (JAMES), bookseller in Glasgow, 1723. An edition of Allan Ramsay's Poems was printed in Edinburgh by Thomas Ruddiman, and was sold by McEuen in Glasgow. This may possibly be the bookseller of the same name who flourished in Edinburgh and London. (Cf. Bushnell, p. 327. Copy of Poems , A.U.L.) MACGHIE (MRS), widow of Alexander Macghie in Edinburgh, 1723. Mrs Macghie was probably not a professional bookseller though she did sell from a shop 'a little above Black Fryer Wynd' her late husband's treatise on Bookkeeping. The book was also sold by George Stuart, bookseller in the Parliament Close. (C.M., Nov. 5, 1723.) MACINTOSH (-----), bookseller in Kirkcaldy, 1749. This Macintosh is described as 'Mr. Macintosh, bookseller' in an advertisement in The Caledonian Mercury in Feb., 1749, as one of the Scottish sellers of The Newcastle General Magazine . (C.M., Feb. 14, 1749.) McLAREN (JAMES), glazier and bookbinder in Perth, 1770-1773. McLaren was admitted freeman to the Wright calling as a glazier and bookbinder on 10 April, 1770. He had served his apprenticeship with Alexander Mitchell of Perth. He is known to have employed two apprentices in the period 1770-1773. (Bibliotheck, I, no. 4, p. 34.) MACLAUCHLAN (A.), bookseller in Dumfries, 1768-1773. A work entitled The Soul's Perpetual Progress towards Perfection through all Eternity . . ., by William Crombie, was sold by Maclauchlan in 1768. He was apparently in partnership with another Dumfries bookseller called Chalmers in 1772 and 1773 and they bought sets of Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine . In April, 1773, an advertisement in The Caledonian Mercury reveals that Maclauchlan sold Patrick Anderson's Scots Pills. A Robert Maclauchlan, bookseller in Dumfries, was named a bankrupt on July 9, 1791. This was probably a relative. (S.M., 1768, p. 316; 1771, p. 364; C.M., April 28, 1773; La. III, 752.) McLEAN (ARCHIBALD), junior?, printer in Glasgow and Edinburgh, 1763-1786?. There seems to be a possibility of confusion between two Archibald McLeans in Bushnell's single entry (pp. 328-329.) Ewing gives an Archibald McLean, junior, as printing in association with James Duncan, junior, of Glasgow in 1763. An Archibald McLean (the senior?) was made a Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow on 18 July, 1757, by right of his father, James McLean, bookbinder. Another Archibald McLean (junior?) was a printer in Edinburgh and was made a Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow by right of having married Isobel, daughter to the deceased William Muir, Merchant, on 21 April, 1786. (B. &amp; G.B. 1741-1846, p. 23; ibid. , p.146.) McLEAN (C.), stationer and print seller in Edinburgh, 1775. McLean's business address was 'the middle of Niddry's Wynd, Edinburgh', and he advertised from this address. (C.M., June 24, 1775.) MACMICHAEL (R.), stationer in Perth, 1766. 'A New Stationery-Ware shop, a little above the Town Guard in the High Street of Perth, where a neat assortment of stationery articles may be had', was advertised by Macmichael in July, 1766. Macmichael was not a member of the Wright calling in Perth to which some stationers were affiliated. (C.M., July 2, 1766.) McPHERSON (SAWNEY), printer in Glasgow, 1756. Ewing lists this man as having printed in Glasgow in 1756. I have not personally examined any volume with his name in the imprint. MAIR (PATRICK), bookseller in Falkirk, 1770-1771. Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine was bought in sets by Mair in the years 1770 and 1771. The last date attached to his name in the account book is Sept. 27, 1771. (La. III, 752.) MAIR (PATRICK), printer in Glasgow, 1764. Ewing gives this Mair as having printed in Glasgow in 1764. I have not come across any books carrying his name in the imprint. He may be the same man as the Patrick Mair, bookseller in Falkirk, 1770. MANES (DENIS), papermaker at Yester and Braid, c . 1695. Manes was a partner with Nicholas Dupyne in his papermaking enterprises. His name is found in a deed dated 16 August, 1695, concerning the building of two paper-mills; one being at Yester and the other at Braid. Manes was also the signatory of a bond dated 18 August, 1697. (Waterston O.E.C., XXV, 62-65.) MARSHALL (JOHN), bookbinder in Glasgow, 1763. John Marshall was made Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow by right of having served an apprenticeship as bookbinder with William Marshall, bookbinder and bookseller, on 27 Nov., 1763. The two men were probably related. (B. &amp; G.B. 1751-1846, p. 48.) MARTIN (ARCHIBALD), printer and bookseller in Edinburgh, 1762. Martin printed an edition of a very well-known Scottish book: The History of the State and Sufferings of the Church of Scotland, from the Restoration to the Revolution. . . . By William Crookshank, A.M. . . . In Two Volumes. Edinburgh: Printed and sold by Archibald Martin, at his Printing-house, opposite to the Foot of Forrester's Wynd, Cowgate MDCCLXII . The work has an unusually attractive engraved title-page. (Copy A.U.L.) MASSON (ALEXANDER), bookseller? in Edinburgh, 1766. The evidence suggests that Alexander Masson was not truly a bookseller, but he did sell copies of his brother's works 'at his house in the Old Assembly Close'. His brother, Arthur Masson, was a prominent teacher of foreign languages in Edinburgh and published volumes of selections. (C.M., Aug. 13, 1766; A.J., Sept. 8, 1766.) MEGGET (JAMES), bookseller in Dalkeith, 1771-1773. Megget bought sets of Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine from June, 1771 to January, 1773. (La. III, 752.) MEIN (WILLIAM), bookseller in Dumfries, 1733-1749. An advertisement in The Caledonian Mercury in December, 1733, named Mein as a bookseller stocking A Sermon, intituled, The Wisdom of the Apostle Paul's Preaching , by G. Gartshore. In 1749 he stocked The Newcastle General Magazine , and in February, 1743, he is listed as one of those willing to take in cloth for a Kelso bleachfield. (C.M., Dec. 18, 1733; April 29, 1742; Feb. 14, 1749.) MENZIES (JOHN), bookseller in Port Glasgow, 1771-1773. Menzies bought sets of Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine from June, 1771 to 1773. The last date opposite to his name in the account book is March 25, 1773. (La. III, 752.) MILL (JAMES), paper-maker in Lasswade, 1774-1775. It is clear from the advertisements made by Dalhousie Bleachfield that James Mill, papermaker in Lasswade, took in cloth for them at his paper mill in February, 1774, and February, 1775. (C.M., Feb. 19, 1774; Feb. 11, 1775.) MITCHELL (J.), bookseller in Edinburgh, 1751- c .1764. Mitchell sold in August, 1751, an edition of Cocker's Arithmetic, revised and corrected by John Mair , which had been printed in Edinburgh for A. Mitchell and R. Morison, Perth. His name also appears on Peter Williamson's A Brief Account, c. 1764. This may possibly be the same man as John Mitchell, bookbinder in Edinburgh, 1744. (Cf. Bushnell, p. 334.) (C.M., Aug. 20, 1751; A.U.L.) MITCHELL (WILLIAM), printer and bookseller in Glasgow, 1750-1751. According to Ewing, James Knox was in partnership with one William Mitchell in 1750-1751. In 1750 they published a two-volume edition of Gulliver's Travels which was advertised in The Scots Magazine . (S.M., July, 1750, p. 352.) MUDIE (ROBERT), bookseller in Brechin, 1771. Mudie was another of the small-town booksellers who bought sets of Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine , and presumably sold them. His purchases were for the year 1771. (La. III, 752.) MURRAY (-----), bookseller in Inverness, 1760. Murray is one of the long list of Scottish provincial booksellers named in The Caledonian Mercury as stocking The British Magazine . (C.M., Jan. 9, 1760.) MURRAY (JAMES), bookseller in Kirkcudbright, 1772-1773. Murray is described as a bookseller in the account-book for Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine . He bought sets in 1772, the last date attached to his name being March 30, 1773. (La. III, 752.) MURRAY (ROBERT), bookseller in Edinburgh, 1772-1782. In the account book for Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine there is a note to Ruddiman from one Robert Murray concerning a publication to be sent to Mr Gordon, bookseller. This note is dated 18 August, 1773. This is presumably the same Robert Murray who was prepared 'to execute commissions for such as cannot attend' an auction sale of books in Edinburgh, December, 1772. The advertisement also states that 'catalogues are to be had of R. Murray, at Mr Gordon's, bookseller, Parliament Close'. It is obvious that in 1772 to 1773 Murray was an employee of Gordon. The death of one Robert Murray, bookseller, on 14 March, 1782, was reported in The Scots Magazine . (La. III, 752; C.M., Dec. 5, 1772; S.M., March, 1782, p. 166.) MUSHET (DAVID), bookseller in Stirling, 1771-1773. Mushet bought both copies and sets of Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine in the years 1771-1773. The last date attached to his name in the account book is Feb. 9, 1773. (La. III, 752.) NEILL (ARCHIBALD), bookseller in Haddington, 1771-1774. Neill appears in several advertisements in The Caledonian Mercury as a retail bookseller. In June, 1772, he sold The Present State of the Game Laws . From June, 1771, to March, 1773, he bought sets of Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine ; and in Jan., 1773, he is advertised as selling the periodical, The Scots Farmer . In March, 1773, and in March, 1774, Archibald Neill, bookseller in Haddington, is listed amongst those authorized to take in cloth for Ormiston Bleachfield. (La.

She produced, over a long period of time, many works in Gaelic as her husband had also done. These included versions of The Psalms of David and of The Shorter Catechism . (C.M., May 21, 1774; Reid's Bibliotheca Scoto-Celtica , 1832, passim .) PALMER (JAMES), merchant and bookseller in Keith, 1774.

The Caledonian Mercury tells us in January, 1746, that one David Randy, bookseller in Haddington, sold A Sermon on Romans IX, 3 . . ., by W. Halyburton.

      <field name="heading_text">Early Editions of The Tatler by William B. Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The earliest printings of The Tatler , in folio, octavo, and duodecimo, all exhibit numerous undifferentiated editions and, in the course of issue, various textual alterations. Of the original 1709-1711 editions in folio, chance observation has already elicited some comment, one writer noting Steele's own reference to printing on different presses, another remarking two or more variant settings in at least 82 numbers, a third reporting variation after the 117th number. 1 Further examination, here extending to eighteen copies, 2 discloses a situation more remarkable than any yet envisaged, but still amenable to bibliographical analysis. Altogether, as we now may demonstrate, the 271 folio issues reveal three orders of presswork. Numbers Settings Range Total Each no. Total Printing (1) 1-32 32 2-4 76 Successive, in one shop (2) 33-117 85 1 85 Single, in one shop (3) 118-271 154 2 308 Simultaneous, in two shops The several variants of folio numbers 1-32 occur in definite patterns of a kind never encountered in simultaneous, but always appearing in successive issues. 3 Obviously with The Tatler , as with other literary periodicals, the demands of later subscribers required later settings, here represented, exclusively, in collections lately assembled. Certain of these subsequent editions may be identified by an advertisement entered intermittently from 14 to 114 and announcing "A New Set of CUTS for the Common Prayer." Though essentially of an identical setting throughout, this notice in issues of a single edition displays in the first line, from 33 to 54 a pointing hand and the reading "CUTS", from 59 to 114 triple stars and the reading "Cuts". Among earlier numbers 1-32 in variant settings the hand is exhibited in 14, 16, 20 of all printings, in 22, 27, 29, 32 only of one. Thus, we may conclude, numbers 22-32 with the starred variant must be of a second (or third) setting printed after 54, the last number of an invariant setting to display the hand. Collections of this later order are the ones identified in Table I as d, m, r, e, i , all with stars, the first two in 29 only, the third in 22 only, the last two in all four numbers. The three series r, e, i also share in numbers 6, 11, and 18 a common third setting with f , an uncut presentation copy collated and bound only after completion of issue, and in numbers 1-2 a common fourth setting not only with this same f but with various other copies. Hence all of these, in more or less degree, appear to have been collected at some time after original issue, and to contain, at least in five of these collections, the latest of several printings. Once the latest settings are identified all others fall into an inalterable sequence, the earliest A with certain typographical features successively modified to the state represented by later editions B, C, D . Table II illustrates several peculiarities evident in the first four numbers, where in 1-3 a preliminary italic notice on recto occurs in three successive settings, all interrelated with 1-4 imprints on verso in seven different impositions or arrangements of type. The sequence there defined is confirmed and, on the evidence of heading rules, extended in this same Table beyond 32 to invariant settings. From the rules, all of one arrangement until superseded by another, it may be deduced that 1-3 of B edition are coeval with 2-18 of A , 1-3 C with 19-29 A , and 1-3 D with 36-38 or later numbers of the single printing. How much later can be determined, for some editions, again by reference to the hand-star variants previously described, all of which are affiliated with certain others not bearing the advertisement. These affiliations, also noted in Table II, indicate that thirteen of the B editions 15-32, the five C editions 4-18, C edition 32, and D editions 2-3 were issued after number 54, dated 13 August 1709. The chronology as established for 1-32 is specified in Table III along with a summary record of the points which most easily distinguish the editions. Of first priority, it will be noted, is an original number not in any sequence: an odd circumstance, but one not without precedent, and not unexpected here since the earlier papers were distributed gratis and—among these eighteen subscribers, at any rate—before anyone had decided to collect the issues. 4 Also to be noted, though not readily apparent in the Table, are unmistakable signs of revision, all again substantiating the order adduced from typographical evidence and waiting to bedevil any future editor of The Tatler . A few specimens from number 2 will suffice, at this time, to exemplify the complexities in these 76 settings—and in the book editions yet to be considered.

With an ever-increasing circulation, however, he finally realized that, even with a two-day interval between numbers, the press could no longer meet the demand. Thus from 118 to 271 two settings appear, both of simultaneous issue and therefore mixed indiscriminately in all collected series. Since there is no priority of issue (and, as we may determine, no certain order of impression) it will be convenient in Table IV to label as edition A the one typographically equivalent to those earlier printed for Morphew, 5 and as B the alternate setting composed at his direction in another office. Whatever the order of printing, there can be little doubt that the editions come from separate establishments, since all type-matter, even including advertisements at end of text, is invariably of two different settings and never interchanged between A and B . It is also evident that, despite the highly variable distribution, the editions were of equal size, for the 924 specimens cited in the Table are almost evenly divided, 466 being of the A type and 458 of the B . It further appears that one setting was composed from an early run (or proof-sheet) of the other, since the lineation in both is, normally, identical. In certain numbers, however, the shift of a word may displace subsequent lines; and by means of this variation we may ascertain that Steele examined setting A of numbers 120, 153, 157, 164, and 226, because the line references in the errata later supplied for these are occasionally inapplicable to setting B . Conversely, and to the despair of anyone speculating upon this circumstance, similar variation in other numbers indicates that Steele was reading edition B of 139, 148, 151, 227, 242, and 259, all with referents at times inapplicable to A . From this conflicting evidence the only deduction is that the author, like his readers, received some numbers of one setting, some of the other. Of greater interest, and possibly of greater significance, are those numbers where Steele was allowed copy in time to amend in the later certain misprints occurring in the earlier setting. Twice in errata accounts the author notes that the errors then cited will be found only in the "faulty impression" (or first edition), a setting easily identified as B of 154 and A of 254. At another time, however, he fails to indicate that the correction pertains only to one setting, in this case to B of 166. And on numerous other occasions he neglects to supply errata notices of any kind, though alterations have again been entered only in one of the two settings. Instances of this silent correction appeared immediately in a random collation of two consecutive numbers, both of which, as it happens, also illustrate the variable order of editions.

Whether that copy is of the original impression A or B with the author's own MS corrections, or of the second setting B or A in amended form, is a question which a future editor must decide on the evidence of all the 154 numbers so affected. Any evasion of the problem will leave him with two alternatives, either to designate folio A as standard copy (since this preserves, at least in accidentals, the "house style" of the earlier single edition) or to adopt octavo or duodecimo as basic text. The latter expedient, though always followed in times past, is particularly unwise because, as we now discover, both of these formats also exist in variable settings, all with different readings, and none with text in definitive state. The original book edition A doubtless is the 12° with errata lists in all four volumes and bearing a text, as the title declares, "Revised and Corrected by the Author." Most of the errata are corrected in later printings 8° and 12°, and the text further revised, with each edition set from copy of the same format yet incorporating, with some exceptions, amendments in a subsequent setting of another size. From the original printing A derives the octavo "subscription" edition of royal and medium paper issue B1 ,2: a text which in earliest numbers volumes I-II adopts or further improves 26 readings first introduced in 12° (Table V, order 1222, 1232, 1234), supplies 13 additional readings (1121, 1122, 1123), but fails to transmit 6 others revised in 12° (1211, 1212). These others, all rather insignificant, may represent entries in a 12° proof later than the one used as copy for subsequent editions, or readings entered in good time but deliberately rejected upon second printing and any copy dependent upon this. From the original printing also derives another 12° C , a supplementary issue presenting a text which, among the readings now under inspection, adopts or improves upon 30 entries in 12° A , including 6 not accumulated in 8° B (1222, 1121, 1123, 1212, 1232), incorporates 14 others first entered or reinserted in B (1122, 1211), and further amends a new reading first cited there (1234). Still another supplementary issue D , identical with C except for a resetting of volume I sheets B-F, occasionally in this resetting improves upon accidentals, e.g. , at page 2, line 36, in the alteration of " dated from my own Apartment" to " dated , From my own Apartment". Supplementary to 8° B — and of all printings the only ones seemingly unattended by the author 6 —are two later issues each also of two impressions, one with an undifferentiated resetting of volume II and volume I dated 1713 ( E1,2 ), the other with volume II reissued under title also dated 1713 ( F1,2 ). Points distinguishing the several issues are given, for 12° in Table VI, for 8° in Table VII. Order of publication, as determined from advertisements in the folio Tatlers , confirms the textual relationship just described. Preceding any of the legitimate issues is a pirated two-volume 12° edition, 7 cited on 4 July 1710 in the same notice announcing as of "Monday next," or the 10th, the simultaneous issue of the authentic 12° and 8° ( A,B ). But where two 8° volumes had been proposed on 31 January, it is now admitted that only the first would appear, the second—according to an announcement of 6 July—"being necessarily defer'd for Want of Paper, which is just come by the Fleet now arriv'd from Holland." This volume B , then promised "in about a Fortnight," actually was delayed until 1 September, and thus follows the second 12° volume A , on ordinary paper, by seven weeks. Though the 12° goes unmentioned in later advertisements, it may be presumed that volumes III and IV in this format were issued, according to original intention, simultaneously with the 8° edition, III of this being announced (in final Tatler number 271) on 2 January 1711, and IV (in Harrison Tatler 316) 17 April 1711. The price of each volume of these several impressions is cited (in Tatler 196) as 2 s. 6 d. for the 12° and (in Spectator 227) as 21 s for 8° royal paper, 10 s. 6 d. for 8° medium paper. With all issues on record, it may be conceded that a definitive edition of The Tatler should take into account every printing except, perhaps, E and F of the collected series, and offer from a conflation of these an eclectic text. A full accounting, as calculated in this final summary, will range for any one number to as many as eight editions, for all numbers to some 1162 settings.

All of these occurrences perhaps indicate an alternate setting of heading and/or imprint used when regular type was already at press for another number. Table III.

Among early numbers of the Gentleman's Magazine , also at first 'Printed for the Author', the original issue of March 1731 occurs only in five of the 36 sets I have inspected, the issue for February only in one, the issue for January not at all. 5 On 2 May 1710 John Nutt, the first printer, entered in the Stationers' Register his copyright to all issues, folio, octavo, and duodecimo. This notice, supplied over a year after original issue of number 1, doubtless was prompted either by the folio reprinting begun in Edinburgh 13 February, or by the pending book edition which Hills issued before 4 July. 6 Through the first number the later 8° exactly reprints B except for the accidental omission at 7.12 of the "s" in "Preparations". 7 This uncommon edition, issued by Henry Hills, reprints folios 1-100.

      <field name="heading_text">Samuel Richardson's London Houses by T. C. Duncan Eaves and Ben D. Kimpel *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has long been known that Samuel Richardson at least as early as the end of 1723 had his dwelling and his printing office just off Fleet Street, in the Parish of St. Bride's, in the neighborhood of Salisbury Court. 1 He later also rented country houses near London, which will not be considered in this article, but from that date his home and his business were always in the Salisbury Court neighborhood. The various houses he occupied, and the periods during which he occupied them, have not, however, been made entirely clear. Professor Alan Dugald McKillop says (pp. 288, 291) that "according to his biographer in the Universal Magazine " Richardson "set up for himself in 1718 or 1719 in 'a court in Fleet Street'" and that the entry of Richardson's marriage in the Charterhouse Chapel, November 23, 1721, describes him "as of St. Bride's Parish"—"the first known record of his lifelong association with the Fleet Street neighborhood." He also cites rate books of St. Bride's Parish for 1724-1727 (GH MS 78), 2 which show that by 1724 Richardson occupied a house in Blue Ball Court at the southeast corner of Salisbury Square. Professor William Merritt Sale, Jr., citing the same records, says that he moved to Blue Ball Court "in 1719 or a little later," and that he brought his first wife, Martha Wilde, there in 1721 and lived in the same house in which he set up his presses. 3 Both Sale and McKillop correctly locate the dwelling and printing plant which Richardson was renting in the early 1720's. But Sale's conjecture as to when Richardson "set up in business for himself" in the Salisbury Court area is not confirmed by the parish records. The date 1718 or 1719 apparently rests on two sources: Richardson's well-known letter to Johannes Stinstra of June 2, 1753, and the memoirs of Richardson in the Universal Magazine for January, 1786, written, if not by Richardson's son-in-law Edward Bridgen, at least with his and Anne Richardson's approval. 4 In his letter to Stinstra, Richardson writes: I continued Five or Six Years after the Expiration of my Apprenticeship (Part of the Time, as an Overseer of a Printing-House) working as a Compositor, and correcting the Press: As I hinted, in a better Expectation. But that failing, I began for myself, married, and pursued Business with an Assiduity that, perhaps, has few Examples. . .. 5 The account of this period of Richardson's career given in the Universal Magazine (LXXVIII, 18) is as follows: At the expiration of his apprenticeship, Mr. Richardson became Overseer and Corrector of a Printing-office; in which employment he continued five or six years. He took up his freedom on the 13th of June, 1715; and first set up for hìmself in a court in Fleet-street; from whence, as his business grew more extensive, he removed into Salisbury-court. The correspondence of Anne Richardson and her sister Martha Bridgen during the early 1780's clearly shows that they knew little, if anything, more of their father's early career than what he himself had written in his letter to Stinstra, 6 and this letter doubtless formed the basis of the assertions of the writer of the article in the Universal Magazine . The letter to Stinstra, then, is actually the only authority for the date on which Richardson "began for" himself. The only detail that the Universal Magazine account adds is that the beginning was "in a court in Fleet-street." This address is probably based on the fact that Richardson's daughters had heard about the Blue Ball Court house; unless (as seems unlikely) Richardson had an earlier business in some other court near Fleet Street or in some other place of which his daughters had never heard, the Blue Ball Court house must have been the site of his first printing plant. Since Richardson was apprenticed to John Wilde on July 1, 1706, his seven-year apprenticeship would have expired in 1713. 7 But the parish records for St. Bride's, which are very full for this period and for the rest of Richardson's life, do not list him as a householder in 1718, 1719, or 1720. If Richardson started business for himself in the house in Blue Ball Court, the discrepancy between his assertion that he "began for" himself "Five or Six Years" after the expiration of his apprenticeship and the fact that, as we shall show below, the Blue Ball Court house is first listed in his name in 1721 can be explained in several ways. It may be that Richardson had forgotten exactly how many years he did service in other men's presses. It may be that in writing to Stinstra Richardson was thinking not of the actual expiration of his apprenticeship, but of the date he took up his freedom, on June 13, 1715. 8 Or it may be that Richardson's association with the printing business of John, Elizabeth, and James Leake, which he later took over, was of such a nature that, in looking back more than thirty years later, he thought of his first association with that business as the date on which he "began for" himself. We believe that the information we present in this article suggests that the third alternative is not unlikely. The Blue Ball Court house which Richardson occupied in the early 1720's is easy to identify in the records: Dorset Street ran south from the southeast corner of Salisbury Court or Square, and just at the corner was a small court running east called Blue Ball Court; a short distance south of this court another small court, called Half Paved Court, ran east off Dorset Street; the St. Bride's records list first the houses on Half Paved Court, then four houses on "Street," and then the houses on Blue Ball Court. The fourth of the houses on "Street" is the one listed in Richardson's name. In a few records there are only three houses on "Street" between the two courts, in which case the Richardson house is listed as the first house in Blue Ball Court. In 1719 this house was occupied by a James Tomlin. 9 A Land Tax Ledger for 1720 (GH MS 3424/9), assessed September 8, 1720, first lists it as "Empty": this is struck through and "Mr. James Leake" is written in. The records of St. Bride's for 1719 do not mention Leake as a householder in that parish. At that time he was presumably living in the Parish of St. Martin's Ludgate, since between November 28, 1719, and May 5, 1720, he was advertising as a bookseller in Stationers Court. 10 During this same period his parents were carrying on a printing business in the Parish of St. Vedast. When his father, John Leake, bound an apprentice on April 6, 1719, he gave his address as Old Change, and when his will was proved on February 29, 1719/20, it was noted on the will that he died in the Parish of St. Vedast. On August 1, 1720, James Leake's mother, Elizabeth, bound an apprentice, giving her address as Old Change. But when James Leake bound an apprentice on October 3, 1720, he gave his address as Salisbury Court. 11 In April, 1721, Elizabeth Leake died. Her husband had left two-thirds of his estate to her and one-third to their children. In her will, dated April 4, 1721, and proved April 13, 1721, she states that she is of the Parish of St. Bride's, and her estate, including "my Printing Presses and Letter Utensils of trade," is bequeathed half to her son James and half to her daughters Mary and Elizabeth. Among other legacies is one of £5 to "Mr. Samuel Richardson of the said Parish of S t Brides London," and Richardson is also named co-executor, with James Leake, of the will. 12 Her burial is recorded at St. Bride's with "certificate," although it is also recorded at St. Vedast's. 13 In a return of Inhabitants for St. Bride's for Jury Duty, November 27, 1721 (Corporation of London MS 83.3), "M r James Leake, Printer," is listed as renting the Blue Ball Court house. He is also so listed in the assessment for the Second Poor Rate for 1721, assessed March 14, 1720/21 (GH MS 3435/R51). In four assessments (listed together) for 1721 (Scavenger's, July 18; Workhouse, April; Orphans, June 24; Poor, August 24) his name is struck through and Samuel Richardson's is written in (GH MS 3435/R48). A Land Tax Ledger, assessed February, 1721/22 (GH MS 3424/11), also has "James Leake" struck through and "S Richardson" written in. It is not clear when the names were altered, but presumably it would have been done between the date of first assessment and the date of payment, that is late in 1721 or early in 1722, and at around this time Richardson must have taken over Leake's former house. On April 23, 1721, when James Leake married Hannah Hammond, he stated that he was of St. Martin's Ludgate. 14 It therefore appears that although he had rented the house in St. Bride's he kept his older establishment. The implication seems to be that James Leake continued as a bookseller in Stationers Court, while his mother moved, with the printing business, to Blue Ball Court. Elizabeth Leake's legacy to Samuel Richardson (as large as the legacies to her sisters Mary Antrobus and Anne Ladyman) and especially the fact that he was made co-executor indicate a close association, and the possibility suggests itself that James Leake, already a bookseller, was not interested in his father's printing business (which, in any case, he soon abandoned) and that Elizabeth Leake therefore took Richardson as manager of the business. Perhaps he had already been serving as such during John Leake's lifetime. Richardson's being of St. Bride's in April, 1721, before he was a householder, may well mean that he already lived in the Leake house in Blue Ball Court. He is also said to be of St. Bride's in his marriage license allegation, November 22, 1721, and in the record of his marriage at the Charterhouse Chapel, November 23, 15 but by this date he may have been renting a house of his own there. McKillop has conjectured that Richardson was early connected with the Leake family, citing the fact that on August 6, 1722, he took over the three apprentices that had been bound respectively to John Leake, Elizabeth Leake, and James Leake in 1719-1720, and guessing that he also took over at least part of the Leake family business. 16 Sale also points out (pp. 15, 288) that Richardson used a printers' ornament that John Leake had probably used earlier, The fact that Richardson took over Leake's house further strengthens McKillop's conjecture. It is not, however, certain that, as McKillop says, Richardson "already had his own business, of course." The only evidence for this, the letter to Stinstra, has already been discussed. The first book known to have been printed by Richardson is the Reverend Jonathan Smedley's Poems on Several Occasions , dated 1721. 17 Richardson was admitted to the livery of the Stationers' Company on March 5, 1721/2. 18 By this time, according to McKillop, James Leake had moved his bookselling business to Bath. 19 The evidence is not conclusive, but it seems highly probable that Richardson took over the Leake business, for which he had earlier been working, when he took over the house; there is no evidence except the letter to Stinstra that he had had a business of his own earlier, and his connections with the Leake business and residence in St. Bride's before he became a householder there are hard to reconcile with the idea that he was in business for himself earlier than late in 1721, although he may well have been running the printing-shop from the time of Elizabeth Leake's death and his position even during her lifetime may have been such that he already contemplated acquiring the business and later considered that he had begun for himself some time before the building in which the shop was located was registered in his name. At any rate, Richardson continued to occupy the Blue Ball Court house for a number of years, and is constantly listed as in this house in the St. Bride's records between 1722 and 1735. 20 The rent for the house is given as £26. In 1728 Richardson rented a second house in Blue Ball Court. This house was evidently across the street from the first, since it is the last house listed as on Blue Ball Court before the rate books again list under "Street"; nine houses are listed between the two houses under Richardson's name. In the Tithes Register for 1727-1728 (GH MS 3437/6) it is first listed (for the half year due at Michelmas, 1727) as rented by a Mr. Badger, with "Clark en t Mids[umm]e[r]" written above the name; for the half year due at Lady Day, 1728, the name Samuel Richardson is written above Clark's; the rent is given as £16. In another Tithes register (GH MS 3437/7) it is listed as empty until Michelmas, 1728, and under Richardson's name from Michelmas, 1728, until Lady Day, 1729. In all of the St. Bride's records mentioned in note 20 from 1729 on, it is listed as Richardson's, and is still so listed in the first part of 1736 (GH MS 3437/13: Tithes, 1735-1736); in the Tithes for 1736-1737 (GH MS 3437/14) it is listed under the name Thomas Brown. In the First and Second Poor Rates for 1734 (GH MS 3435/R117) and the Tithes for 1734-1735 (GH MS 3437/12) a third house in Blue Ball Court, three doors down from the first, is listed as Richardson's. The rent is £14. In 1733-1734 it was rented by William Rennolds (GH MS 3437/11: Tithes). The Tithes record for 1735-1736 (GH MS 3437/13) describes it as "Sam ll Richardson's workho." It continues to be listed under Richardson's name into early 1740. 21 In the Second Poor Rate for that year (GH MS 3435/R137) it is listed as empty, and in the Scavenger's Ledger for Christmas, 1740-Christmas, 1741 (GH MS 3429/9), is the entry "M r Richardson. Work ho: is now Dan ll Brown"; in a Constable's-Scavenger's Ledger for the same period (GH MS 3430/7) Daniel Brown's name is written above Richardson's. It is almost certain that these two houses were used by Richardson for business purposes and that he continued to reside in the first Blue Ball Court house. Sale says that it cannot be determined when he left this house for the western side of Salisbury Court, but that all evidence suggests the 1730's, perhaps when he married Elizabeth Leake in 1732 (actually Richardson was married in 1733). 22 The Salisbury Court house is the "House of a very grand outward Appearance" which Lætitia Pilkington saw inthe 1740's. 23 In the Tithes from Michelmas, 1735, to Lady Day, 1736 (GH MS 3437/13), the house at the corner of Blue Ball Court and Dorset Street is listed as Mary Badsey's, a widow, "En: Ladyday 1736"; in the same record the Salisbury Court house is first listed under Richardson's name, with the notation "En t Xmas 19 th "—presumably the nineteenth day of the Christmas Term. Richardson is listed as paying £65 rent, but in the Tithes for 1736-1737 (GH MS 3437/14) the rent is changed from £65 to £57. This house had been occupied by William Ventris through the Poor Rate due Lady Day 1732 (GH MS 3435/R104), and was afterwards listed as empty. 24 The Salisbury Court house is listed under Richardson's name in all of the rate books from 1736 through 1755. 25 In the First Poor Rate for 1756 (GH MS 3435/R305) it is listed as empty. In the Constable's and Scavenger's Ledger from Christmas, 1740, to Christmas, 1741 (GH MS 3430/7), after the entry for Richardson in Salisbury Court there is added in a different hand "and two backhouses." These houses are also listed as Richardson's in the First Poor Rate for 1741 (GH MS 3435/14) and are listed as his in the subsequent records cited in note 25. They were evidently rented about the time he gave up the third Blue Ball Court house, and were located on Hanging Sword Alley, which ran south of Fleet Street to the west of Dorset Street. Since they are referred to as "backhouses," they must have been directly behind the Salisbury Court house. The rent is occasionally given as £10 for the two. Under Salisbury Court there frequently appears an entry such as "Sam 1 Richardson &amp; 2 Ba: ho" (GH MS 3435/R146: Poor, 1741) or "Samuel Richardson 2 ho s " (GH MS 3437/19: Tithes, 1746-1747). He is paying a total rent of £72 for his house and the backhouses. The backhouses are still in Richardson's name in 1756 and 1757, 26 but are not listed as his in the Poor Rate for the first quarter of 1758 (GH MS 3435/R332). The fact that these houses are referred to as "backhouses" is the clearest indication that Richardson's first Salisbury Court house was on the west side of the square: Hanging Sword Alley ran due west of the square. Richardson's second Salisbury Court house (see below) was located on the north side of the northwest corner of the square and was two doors from the first; it is listed before the first Salisbury Court house in the rate books. These rate books first list houses on White Lyon Court, then houses on "Street" (presumably Fleet Street), and then houses on Salisbury Court: it appears then that the Salisbury Court entries ran down the street which connected Fleet Street and Salisbury Square and then around the square, beginning with the north side and continuing with the west. If this is actually the order of listing, it is a further indication that Richardson's first Salisbury Court house was on the west side. Richardson's neighbor "Miss P." describes his house as in the center of the square. 27 In 1752 Richardson rented a second house in Salisbury Court. From 1739 until sometime between Michelmas, 1751, and Lady Day, 1752, this house is listed as empty. 28 In the Tithes for the second half year due at Lady Day, 1752 (GH MS 3437/21), the house is first listed as "E" with a rent of £26; then the entry has been altered in pencil to "Sam Richardson" with a rent of £10. It is listed under Richardson's name in the First Poor Rate for 1752 (GH MS 3435/R250). It was two doors from his first Salisbury Court house, on the north side of the square, at the northwest corner. 29 The one intervening house, in the late 1740's and early 1750's, was occupied by the Sons of the Clergy. Richardson's second Salisbury Court house is listed under his name from 1752 through 1761. 30 In the Tithes for the last quarter of 1761 (GH MS 3437/32d), Richardson's name is struck through and "W m Richardson &amp; Sam 1 Clarke" is written in. Richardson's last change of residence, in 1755, is fully described in his correspondence. His former dwelling, he wrote to Lady Echlin, had "stood near its Time," and the "very great Printing Weights at the Top of it, have made it too hazardous for me to renew an expiring Lease." He therefore rented "a Court of Houses, Eight in Number, which were ready to fall, . . . pulled them down, and on new Foundations, . . . built a most commodious Printing-Office; and fitted up an adjoining House which I before used as a Warehouse for the Dwelling-House." 31 To Lady Bradshaigh he wrote, "It is the Printing Office only that is new-built; That is distinct from, tho' adjoining to, the Dwelling-Part, which two Families of my Workmen occupied, for a few Years past, one on one Floor, the other on another, while I made use of the rest in my Business." 32 "The Dwelling-Part" evidently refers to the house which Richardson had rented in 1752. The new business premises ran along two sides of a paved court, "97 Feet long one Range, 60 Feet the other, joined together by a kind of Bridge thrown over a tolerably paved Passage of about 12 Feet wide." The new house was "less handsome and less roomy [than the old]; but infinitely more convenient, it adjoining to, and as I have managed it, opening into, the paved Court that separates my double-winged Building, and, at the same Time, giving me a very convenient Passage into Fleet-street; as I have another into Salisbury Court, next Door but one (tho' in a Corner) to the House I am to quit. . . . I have a sixty years Lease of the Ground I have built upon, at an easy Ground Rent. . . . Parson's-Green must supply to my Wife and Girls the Difference, as to Appearance, between the two Dwelling-houses. Yet the new one will be a comfortable Dwelling; and as it will, tho' connected with the Business Part, be intirely separate from it, and no Part of the Business done in it, my Family will have more Convenience, than it had before; because a great Part of the other larger House (and yet the new one is 45 feet deep) was taken up in the Business. Every-body is more pleased with what I have done than my Wife: But that, I flatter myself, is because she has not seen either the Offices or the House she is to live in, since the former were little better than a Heap of Rubbish (8 Houses being demolished to make Room for them) and the latter was a dirty Warehouse." 33 The new business premises were on White Lyon Court, which ran south off Fleet Street towards the northwest corner of Salisbury Court. His lease on the ground on which they were built must have been taken before he began building in the summer of 1755, but the entry "Samuel Richardson's Workshops" first appears under White Lyon Court in the Poor Rate for the fourth quarter of that year (GH MS 3435/R291). 34 By July, 1755, Richardson had begun reconstruction, 35 and he continued to devote most of his time to it during the summer and fall: "My Imagination . . . seems entirely quenched. Bricks, Mortar, and Works of Wood seem utterly to have extinguished what little I had of it!" 36 By December it was completed, and his printing materials were in the reconstructed building. 37 Reconstruction and removal to the new house cost over £1400, although at one time he had hoped to do the reconstruction for as little as £500. 38 He was not, however, able to move so soon into the new dwelling house: because of his wife's opposition he remained "like a Man setting out on a needful Journey, &amp; arrested when he had got within Sight of y e End of it." 39 Mrs. Richardson proved so fond of the old house and so averse to change that it was late March before he was able to move. He would have preferred to move dwelling and business at the same time, but was "weakly prevented . . . doing the Whole at once," and waited until he had gotten his wife and family to Parson's Green. "I have a very good Wife. I am sure you think I have: But the Man who has passed all his Days single, is not always and in every thing, a Loser." 40 By April 4 he had moved, and his wife and girls "threatened to return to Town next Thursday." Mrs. Richardson was still not satisfied: "She must stay till the new one becomes an old one; and then she will—Such is the Force of Constancy with her. . . . She intends not now, she says, to be perverse. I believe not, I tell her: But must conclude in her Favour, that it is natural to—and she can't help it." 41 By late April Mrs. Richardson was less dissatisfied: "My Wife says, she begins to be reconciled to her new Habitation. I think, if she hasten not her entire Reconciliation I have a Way to effect it. It is but hinting to her, that we must probably leave it in a very little Time for some other [My Tenure is precarious, as to the Dwelling-Part I mean,] she will then see all its Conveniencies at once. . .." 42</field>

This advertisement was first noted by Burns Martin, "Richardson's Removal to Salisbury Court," MLN , XLV (1930), 469, but does not, as Martin thought, support the statement of earlier biographers that in 1723 or 1724 Richardson moved from his first house near Fleet Street to his later Salisbury Court house—Blue Ball Court was just off Salisbury Court and Richardson's house on the corner (see below) could well have been described as in Salisbury Court. 2 This is a Constable's Ledger for 1724-1725 and 1725-1726; Poor Ledger for 1727; and Scavenger's Ledger for 1727.

The only evidence given by Sale (pp. 180-181, 229, 288) that Richardson printed six books in 1719 or 1720 is that some of these books contain Sale's ornaments 46 (the ornament previously used by J. L[eake?]) and 41. Since the Leakes were in business into 1721, there is no reason to think they would have turned over ornament 46 to Richardson in 1719 or 1720. Three books printed in 1719 or 1720 (Sale's numbers 1, 2, and 5) contain both ornament 46 and ornament 41, which seems to indicate that the latter ornament was also acquired from the Leakes. Richardson could, of course, have borrowed ornament 46, but ornament 41 alone is not sufficient evidence to say that Richardson was printing before 1721. 18 "Court Book H," p. 109; cited by McKillop, Samuel Richardson , p. 289, and Sale, pp. 14, 360. 19 Samuel Richardson , p. 289n. 20 GH MS 78 (Constable's, 1724-1725 and 1725-1726; Poor, 1727; Scavenger's, 1727—these records are mentioned by McKillop, Samuel Richardson , p. 291, and Sale, p. 359).

Perhaps only one backhouse was kept this long: the Poor Rates continue to mention backhouses, but from 1752 the Tithes list only one backhouse at £5, and the Watch Rate for 1755 (GH MS 3430/8) lists one backhouse at £5 and the second as "E." 27 Anna Lætitia Barbauld, ed. The Correspondence of Samuel Richardson (London, 1804), I, clxxxiii. Sale (p. 9) says that Richardson's house was on the western side of the square, citing this statement by "Miss P." as evidence. "Miss P." also states that she "lived nearly opposite" Richardson's house. It seems highly likely, as Sale suggests (p. 359), that she was Richardson's friend Miss Poole. On January 22, 1742, John Poole was married to Mary Dutton (MS Register of St. Margaret's, Westminster), the daughter of Richardson's friend Thomas Dutton, and in that year he took over the house on Dorset Street between Half Paved Court and Blue Ball Court which had previously been listed in Dutton's name or that of his widow, Mary (GH MS 3435/R150: Poor, 1742). Of the children of John and Mary Poole two daughters were alive on May 28, 1771, when he wrote his will (Prerogative Court of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Alexander 388, proved October 20, 1775): Elizabeth Poole and Mary, the wife of John Way. Mary was baptized on November 17, 1743, and Elizabeth on October 25, 1749 ("St. Bride's Register of Baptisms: 1736/7-1812" [GH MS 6541/1]. Elizabeth appears to have been too young to have gone to bed by herself, putting out her own candle, in 1753, or to have visited Richardson at North End without her mother (Barbauld, I, clxxxiv-clxxxv); so the "lady" who communicated the letter to Mrs. Barbauld was Mary Poole Way. The member of her family with whom Richardson seems to have been most closely associated was her aunt, Margaret Dutton, who in December, 1756, died in Richardson's house (see Barbauld, II, 102-103; Forster MS (Victoria and Albert Museum), XIV, 2, ff. 2, 72; Richardson to Mrs. Sheridan, December 19, 1756, original owned by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania). Since the Dutton-Poole house was located on Dorset Street between Half Paved Court and Blue Ball Court and was thus just off the southeast corner of the square, Mrs. Way's remark that she "lived nearly opposite" Richardson's house is insufficient evidence for locating it on either the north or the west side of the square. 28 GH MS 3437/17-21 (Tithes, 1739-1740, 1743-1747, 1750-1752); GH MS 3435/R136-137, 144-146, 150-152, 169-172, 178-180, 189-192, 201-203, 212-215, 224-228 (Poor, 1740-1750); GH MS 3429/9 (Scavenger's, 1740-1741). McKillop says ( Samuel Richardson , p. 291) that Richardson rented this second Salisbury Court house by 1748-1749 and Sale states (p. 12) that he rented it "soon" after the first Salisbury Court house. Both seem to have been misled by the wording of the entry in GH MS 79 (Tithes, 1748-1749), which lists under Salisbury Court "Saml Richardson, 2 ho s " The "2 ho s " are certainly the two backhouses, and this entry is similar to many others in the rate books. The house Richardson later occupied is listed in GH MS 79 as empty. 29 The Builder , LXXI (July 18, 1896), 48, prints a picture of No. 11 Salisbury Square, described as the house "set back in the north-west corner, which, together with offices and a warehouse adjoining, with an entrance from Fleet-street," Richardson built in 1754. Eighteenth-century maps make it clear that there was a setback on the north side of the corner, towards White Lyon Court, and the picture shows walls jutting forward on each side of No. 11 in a way possible only if its facade ran the length of the setback. 30 GH MS 3437/22-32c (Tithes, 1752-1761); GH MS 3435/R251-252, 261-264, 274-277, 288-291, 305-308, 319-322, 332-335, 344-347, 354-356, 364-366 (Poor, 1752-1761); GH MS 3430/8 (Watch Rate, 1755), 9 (Watch and Scavenger's, 1755-1756). 31 December 15, 1755.

They are here described as eight houses with a rent of £89, but this seems to have been the rent before Richardson rebuilt them, since under Salisbury Court is listed "50/60 Sam l Richardson &amp; Workshops," and in subsequent tithes records the rent is given as £50. The White Lyon Court houses are listed as Richardson's in all records cited in note 30 which are subsequent to the first quarter of 1756. 35 Richardson to Thomas Edwards, July 14, 1755, Forster MS, XII, 1, f. 144. 36 Richardson to Lady Bradshaigh, October 21, 1755, Forster MS, XI, f. 161.

      <field name="heading_text">Wordsworth's Poetry and Stuart's Newspapers: 1797-1803 by R. S. Woof</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE CHIEF END HERE IS TO ANNOTATE AND PRESENT A CHECK LIST of those poems of Wordsworth that appeared in Daniel Stuart's papers, the Morning Post and the Courier , during the six years, December 1797 to December 1803. 1 I have found that the list of appearances can be extended to well over 40. Although some 20 poems (all from the Morning Post ) are noted in the Oxford Wordsworth , over a dozen of these need correction in either date or collation. Several poems, moreover, poems which are not simply reprints, are outside the main corpus of Wordsworth's work, and they were therefore presented in the Oxford Edition with little textual apparatus. Thus, it is from the manuscripts as well as from newspapers that I am able to supplement that distinguished work. It is convenient that all newspapers known to contain Wordsworth poems are to be found in the British Museum files (with the exception of the Morning Post for April 2, 1802, which is in the Newberry Library, Chicago). However, after checking libraries in England and North America, I find that the following issues of the Morning Post are missing: January 3, April 5, May 15, and December 8, 1798; the first three of these might well contain Wordsworth (or Coleridge) items. The missing copies of the Courier cause less concern, for Mr. D. V. Erdman, after searching the files from 1797 to 1803, tells me that there are gaps in only the first two of these years. 2 It is unlikely that these conceal anything, since the Courier did not belong to Stuart at that time, and no Wordsworth or Coleridge poem has been recorded in that paper before April, 1800. As a necessary introduction to the annotated check list, I comment on the varied nature of Wordsworth's contact with the newspapers, and attempt an explanation of some poetic pseudonyms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Introduction The story of Wordsworth's connexion with the Morning Post has generally been seen as part of Coleridge's, and, indeed, so the story begins. With possibly one exception, all the verse of Wordsworth's to be printed in Stuart's newspapers before February, 1802, seems to have been included amongst Coleridge's own contributions. After this date, however, Wordsworth sends material on his own account and on one occasion at least the motive was to pay off a debt to Stuart. There was no question of Wordsworth's being the journalist that Coleridge had become, nor of his prostituting his poetry for a newspaper as Coleridge and Southey had done. He generally made the paper serve his purpose, allowing it to publish translations which he took seriously but considered of no great importance, using it for political sonnets, his moral hortatives to the country in a time of peril. His memory of this early activity seems to have become faint, but we have no need to feel that Wordsworth was being devious when forty years later, on May 17, 1838, he wrote to Stuart: Now, for my own part, I am quite certain that nothing of mine ever appeared in the Morng Post, except a very, very, few sonnets upon political subjects, and one Poem called the 'Farmer of Tillsbury Vale,' but whether this appeared in the Morng Post or the Courier, I do not remember. . . . The Sonnets and the Pamphlet [ The Convention of Cintra ] were written by me without the slightest view to any emolument whatever; nor have I, nor my Wife or Sister, any recollection of any money being received for them, either directly from yourself (as E. and P. of those Papers), or mediately through C.; and I wish to know from you, if you have any remembrance or evidence to the contrary. But certain I am, that the last thing that could have found its way into my thoughts would have been to enter into an engagement to write for any newspaper—and that I never did so. 3 Wordsworth forgets here that with his poetry he paid off both moral and financial debts. Yet though his statement needs correction, its general truth is indisputable: he never wrote poetry for Stuart's hire, he was not paid by the column and thus he could be concerned with the quality rather than the length of his newspaper poems. But it is clear from the lists that follow that half the new appearances noted were sent by neither poet; they were reprintings from the Lyrical Ballads inserted presumably on Stuart's initiative. Naturally, there are no significant textual variants but the numerous misprints here serve to warn us that many minor variants discovered in other newspaper texts may equally have little authority. The misprints further prove what a comparison of dates would suggest, that the reprintings of Wordsworth's poems in the influential Lady's Magazine (with a circulation of at least 10,000) 4 in 1798, 1800, 1801 are themselves based upon Stuart's reprinting in the newspaper. Stuart seems to have begun his campaign on Wordsworth's behalf on April 2, 1800, with the reprinting in the Morning Post of "The Mad Mother" and he introduced the poem with the following note: It has been the habit of our Paper to present our Readers with none but Original Poetry; but we have been so captivated with the following beautiful Piece, which appears in a small volume entitled Lyrical Ballads , that we are tempted to transgress the rule we laid down for ourselves. Indeed the whole Collection, with the exception of the first Piece, which appears manifestly to have been written by a different hand, is a tribute to genuine nature. This could have been from Coleridge's pen before he left for the North of England at the end of March, but just as likely it was one of Stuart's many attempts to express ideas taken from Coleridge's conversation. In the Courier , accompanied by suitable puffs, three other poems appeared in April, and one of these ("The Female Vagrant") was 30 stanzas long and occupied three columns. None of this activity was missed in Grasmere, and hence we have Coleridge writing to Stuart on July 15: Wordsworth requests me to be very express in the communication of his sincere thanks to you, for the interest which you have been so kind to take in his poems. We are convinced you have been of great service to the sale. That Wordsworth had been able to report to his brother, Richard, on June 8: "the first edition of the Lyrical Ballads is sold off, and another is called for by the Booksellers" is some proof of the success of Stuart's advertisement. Indeed, Longman's attitude changed most probably as a result of the public notices. Cottle relates that Longman had not been interested in the copyright of the Lyrical Ballads at the end of 1799 and that thus he had been able to recover it for Wordsworth. Yet only six months later Longman and Rees were prepared to reprint the first edition and to publish a second volume. Stuart perhaps was not entirely disinterested. To support this volume was to support not only Wordsworth's work but that of his difficult and admired contributor, Coleridge. Further, Stuart must have entertained hopes of persuading Wordsworth to write regularly for the paper. By the middle of 1800 he must have been in real need of more poetry. Two years earlier, on April 17, 1798, he had been able to make some claim for the paper's literary pretensions: The POETRY of the Morning Post will in future be critically select. None but first rate compositions will be admitted to our columns; and we are promised the aid of several of the most distinguished writers of the present day. Thus powerfully supported, we request the attention of the Literati to this department of our Paper; where the enlightened mind will not fail to receive ample gratification. To the end of 1799 the claim was in some way justified, for Southey and Mary Robinson were employed as principal contributors of poetry; Southey submitted on an average one or two poems a week, and, except for the winter of 1798-99, Mrs. Robinson's industry was equal to this. Stuart no doubt expected like things of Coleridge, especially when, at the end of 1799 Southey ceased to contribute and Coleridge became one of Stuart's London staff. Coleridge began with a spurt of poetic activity in December, 1799, but submitted only two epigrams for the first three months of 1800. (There were, however, some 40 items of prose.) Mrs. Robinson fortunately surpassed herself and supplied over 45 poems in the first eighteen weeks of the new year. Yet Stuart must have been well aware of the precariousness of her health—she died in December of that year. He was aware too that a "literary" paper required more than one poet, even though she should use some dozen signatures, 5 and thus, early in July, he apparently asked Coleridge if Wordsworth would care to contribute poetry. He may even have asked for prose. Coleridge returned him, however, a discouraging reply; in a letter of July 15, he wrote : "Wordsworth's state of Health at the present time is such as to preclude all possibility of writing for a paper." Yet strangely enough in less than one week Wordsworth's "Farmer of Tilsbury Vale" made its appearance in the Morning Post . In 1835, as we saw from the letter quoted above, this was the only poem, besides the political sonnets of 1803, whose newspaper appearance Wordsworth acknowledged; such acknowledgement does not mean that Wordsworth was responsible for submitting the poem, and indeed a sentence in Coleridge's letter of July 15, 1800, suggests that it was Coleridge who sent it : "On Thursday I will set to, &amp; will not leave off, on my word &amp; honor, till I have done a second part of Pitt, &amp; Buonaparte—." But no such essay appeared in the following weeks (nor to Stuart's disappointment in the following years); instead, Coleridge seems to have substituted the Wordsworth poem. It is proper to warn here against a second explanation which might be suggested by the conclusion of Coleridge's letter to Stuart. "We have never," he complained, "had the newspaper with the verses I sent you from Bristol." It is improbable that these verses were Wordsworth's, for although, as we know from Wordsworth's letter to Davy of July 28, Coleridge did have a manuscript copy of Wordsworth's poems with him in Bristol, he would hardly send any of these to Stuart before the two poets had compiled the second volume of Lyrical Ballads . More likely the verses were Coleridge's own, the same that appeared in the Courier for June 21 ("I ask'd my fair, one happy day") and August 22 ("Last Monday all the Papers said"). These two poems had already been printed in the Morning Post on August 27 and September 18 of the previous year, and as the 1800 texts were somewhat different, it was clearly Coleridge who was responsible for submitting them again. Stuart presumably felt they could best be used in his second paper, the Courier , and thus they were not noticed in the lake district, for Stuart seems to have sent only the Morning Post to his friends there. Not until early 1802 can we feel certain that Wordsworth himself sent poems to Stuart. The three Wordsworth poems that appeared in October and November 1800 were probably, as the notes below will show, submitted by Coleridge. Two of them were turned into compliments to Mrs. Robinson ("The Solitude of Binnorie" by means of a long introductory note, and "Alcæus to Sappho" by the coining of the title); this surely was the act of her friend, Coleridge The full existence and problem of the 1802 Wordsworth poems in the Morning Post has not hitherto been conclusively explored. It would seem from Coleridge's correspondence that he positively intended to supply Stuart plentifully at the start of 1802, but it has been thought that he failed in his promises and that he sent little or nothing to the Morning Post between December 26, 1801 (paltry epigrams) and September 6, 1802 ("The Picture"). Some of Coleridge's honour has recently been retrieved by the discovery of two essays by him on the subject of Mr. Addington's Administration 6 and as we know, from announcements in the paper, that Stuart had these essays by February 15 and February 24, it would not be impossible for the Wordsworth poems of February 2, 12, 13, and perhaps March 9 to make up the remainder of Coleridge's promised contribution. It was not so, however. The poems are without signatures and this fact alone suggests they were not borrowed by Coleridge. Secondly, Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal points to Wordsworth's responsibility. She writes on January 27, 1802: ". . . Wm. wrote to Stuart. I copied out sonnets for him". Two of the February poems are sonnets and the doubtful item in March is a quinzain. Wordsworth's reason for writing to Stuart is found in an earlier letter of December 21, 1801, presumably the first direct communication between the two men. Wordsworth had found himself in need of £10 and, as Coleridge had precipitately left London for Nether Stowey that Christmas, he had applied instead to Stuart: I have therefore taken the Liberty of requesting you would send it to me down here, and consider him [Coleridge] your Debtor to that amount, or, as you like it best, look to me for the immediate repayment of the sum, or if you have no objection, for articles for your paper in value to that amount. Wordsworth was obviously well aware that Stuart was prepared to value him as a contributor. He no doubt remembered Stuart's request for work in 1800 and he must have known of Coleridge's suggestion to Stuart of September 19, 1801—that free copies of the Morning Post should be sent to Sara Hutchinson: Would you send a paper for this next quarter to her? Wordsworth will feel himself excited by his affections to do something — &amp; whatever he does I shall conscientiously add &amp; not substitute, as a sort of acknowledgement for this new debt. Yet if, as seems probable, the £10 debt was to be paid off by means of "articles . . . in value to that amount", it is questionable whether the three or four short poems so far discovered were sufficient to do this. If ever there was a time when one might expect an early Wordsworth prose contribution in the Morning Post , the first quarter of 1802 would be it. 7 By the end of 1802 Wordsworth's contact with Stuart had become very much stronger and in 1803 we find him using the Morning Post quite extensively. The sonnet "I griev'd for Bonaparte", published in the newspaper on Thursday, September 16, 1802, was probably handed to Stuart directly. In a letter begun on September 20 and finished three days afterwards, Stuart wrote to Coleridge: "Wordsworth dined with me last week. I don't know if he has left town not having seen him since." 8 This meeting perhaps led Wordsworth to think more seriously of the newspaper. Dorothy remarks twice on the Wordsworths' activity for Stuart. In a letter to John on December 25, she writes: "William has written some more Sonnets—Perhaps you may see them in the Morning Post—If they do not appear there we will send them to you." On January 11, 1803, she comments in her Journal: "Since tea Mary has been down stairs copying out Italian poems for Stuart." The sonnets we will deal with first. Now, we can be fairly positive, Coleridge had nothing to do with Wordsworth's communication with Stuart; even the introductory notes accompanying the sonnets indicate in their plainness Stuart rather than Coleridge. The first of those halfpromised by Dorothy in her letter to John appeared on January 13, 1803, and on January 29 this sonnet, "Is it a reed that's shaken by the wind", was republished together with that of the previous September, "I griev'd for Bonaparte". The two poems were now signed "W. L. D." and were the beginning of a formal plan which Stuart ushered in with the following announcement: We have been favoured with a dozen Sonnets of a Political nature, which are not only written by one of the first Poets of the age, but are among his best productions. Each forms a little Political Essay, on some recent proceeding. As we wish to publish them in connection with each other we now Reprint No. I. and No. II. the first from the Paper of September last; the second from our Paper of the present month. The other Numbers shall follow in succession. The five sonnets that followed were also signed "W. L. D.", but there were no more than five. Only seven of the promised dozen appeared. There is first, then, the problem of the missing poems. Perhaps the answer is simply that Wordsworth had written no more sonnets that were really suitable. At first glance it might seem that he had plenty of such sonnets available. Mrs. Moorman has counted six ( William Wordsworth I, 572), but there are, in fact, ten in the same category, sonnets which were later classified under poems "Dedicated to National Independence and Liberty", and which could have been written by January, 1803. These are listed below with the information furnished by the Oxford Wordsworth (Volume III); I append an "M" if the sonnet is among Mrs. Moorman's six. 1. Composed by the sea-side, near Calais, August, 1802 . "Fair Star of evening, Splendour of the West" (Composed August, 1802.) M. 2. Composed near Calais, on the road leading to Ardres, August 7, 1802 . "Jones! as from Calais southward you and I" (Composed August, 1802.) 3. On the extinction of the Venetian Republic . "Once did She hold the gorgeous east in fee" (Composed probably August, 1802.) M. 4. The King of Sweden . "The voice of song from distant lands shall call" (Composed probably August, 1802.) 5. Composed in the valley near Dover, on the day of landing . "Here, on our native soil, we breathe once more" (Composed August 30, 1802.) 6. September, 1802. Near Dover . "Inland, within a hollow vale, I stood" (Composed September, 1802.) 7. Written in London, September, 1802 . "O Friend! I know not which way I must look" (Composed September, 1802.) M. 8. London, 1802 . "Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour" (Composed September, 1802.) M. 9. "Great men have been among us; hands that penned" (Composed probably 1802.) M. 10. "England! the time is come when thou should'st wean" (Composed probably 1803.) M. I assume Mrs. Moorman has extra information which allows her to include this poem amongst those written probably before 1803. But, despite such a spacious list of sonnets, we have no certainty that these were available to Wordsworth for the newspaper. First, numbers 3, 4, 9 and 10 are not certainly written by January, 1803, and others of the list are patently not fitting for the mood of 1803. Some are not topical or general enough; others, perhaps, are too harshly critical of England. Thus the failure to make up the sonnets of a political nature to the promised dozen can possibly be attributed to Wordsworth, either to his mood or to his inactivity. Stuart did little to help; delay cannot have been encouraging to Wordsworth. Sonnet VI was published on April 16, and Sonnet VII not until September 17. Undoubtedly Stuart had had Sonnet VII for some time, possibly even from January, and surely from before August 14 when Wordsworth set out on his tour of Scotland. And this was not the only delay. The Italian poems that Mary copied out for Stuart on January 11 (see above) are most probably those that did make an appearance in the Morning Post from October to December, 1803. It is not difficult to account for such delays. In the summer of 1803 the national fear was of invasion from France, and a newspaper's best response obviously was patriotic fervour. Whatever Stuart might say about the literary quality of his paper, public needs and an extensive circulation dominated his policy. This had always been true. He explained his attitude clearly enough in 1798 when he rejected (on second thoughts) an essay by Rusticus (Thomas Poole), which attacked the fashion for men servants: I admire the Essay of Rusticus very much. It is full of truth and simple elegant writing. But I must sacrifice opinion to policy. The Livery servants are a numerous body and very powerful among the purchasers of the Morning Post. Very few families purchase a Newspaper which is not first read by the Servants and their influence is great with respect to the circulation of Papers; at least their hostility might be very dangerous. For as they are low and narrow minded their rancour would be bitter. 9 Stuart's concern had not changed in 1803; he gave space to an increasing number of advertisers who took advantage of the Morning Post's high circulation; he printed more news and less verse, and even had difficulty in fitting in the patriotic verse he desired. An announcement on July 16 indicates his dilemma (the dates inserted in brackets are those of eventual publication): The following Songs and Poems were intended for insertion as soon as possible. The Corsican Fairy. Albion's Song. The Extract from Douglas. C.T.'s Song. Pat's Hint to Bonaparte. [August 10.] An Acrostical Note. L'Invasion de L'Angleterre. Philo Patrie's Song. [July 20.] Bonaparte's Answer to John Bull's Invitation. ["John Bull's Invitation" had appeared July 5; this appeared August 13.] Harlequin's Invasion. [August 9.] Even Wordsworth's Sonnet VII, "When I have borne in memory what has tamed / Great nations", could scarcely compete with such enthusiasm. It survived the paper's change of ownership in late August, and made its appearance on September 17. The Italian translations had to wait till October. Wordsworth did, however, make one fulsome response to the public mood, and this was his sonnet, "Anticipation", which was published in the Courier on October 28. Unrestrained patriotism was here at last, and significantly enough, this sonnet (though apparently not submitted by Wordsworth himself) found immediate publication.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Note on Pseudonyms The signatures appended to Wordsworth's newspaper poems have perhaps more than a chance significance. A discernible pattern emerges. Poems published on Stuart's initiative generally carried either Wordsworth's name or a reference to Lyrical Ballads ; poems submitted by Wordsworth himself appeared unsigned (except for the political sonnets of 1803, signed "W. L. D."); poems sent under Coleridge's auspices were sometimes decorated with a pseudonym of some point or wit. It is these last signatures that need comment. The first Wordsworth poem to make an appearance in the paper is "The Convict", and it is signed "MORTIMER". It has been thought that this combination of pseudonym and poem indicated Wordsworth's depressed response to the rejection of The Borderers at Covent Garden. But there is another and more probable inference to be drawn. In the spring of 1798 two more poems were signed "MORTIMER"; on December 7, a week before "The Convict" was published Coleridge's own first contribution to the Morning Post appeared under the signature "ALBERT"; in January and February 1798, Southey began his association with the newspaper with five poems signed "WALTER". 10 Surely this use of the names of the heroes of their plays was no accident. It was perhaps a means of letting a few interested people know who the real authors were; Southey's "Walter" could not have been widely recognized, but "Mortimer" and "Albert" must have meant something to readers like Lamb, Poole, Thelwall, Cottle, Lloyd, Bowles, Tom Wedgwood, Sheridan, perhaps Wrangham, Southey of course, and no doubt, others. 11 The signatures of the Wordsworth poems own possibly further refinements; they perhaps indicate whether or not Coleridge had made any radical alterations to poems he had obtained from Wordsworth. The text of "The Convict", for instance, is altered for the Morning Post , and though this may be Coleridge's work, one cannot with any certainty make that assumption, for on the two other occasions when the signature "Mortimer" is used, we have full manuscript evidence that the texts are wholly Wordsworth's. The signature "Nicias Erythræus" suggests something very different, however. The two poems with this pseudonym, "The Old Man of the Alps" and "Lewti", are perhaps in similar ways the result of joint authorship; "Lewti" is an early poem of Wordsworth's completely rewritten by Coleridge, and similarly "The Old Man of the Alps", though it probably owes something of its origin to Wordsworth, may have become Coleridge's. Significantly, the full signature here should read " Janus Nicias Erythræus". 12 Again, on February 13, 1798, the signatures "Publicosa" and "W. W." appear beneath poems that are originally Wordsworth's, and, after considering the textual histories of these poems, I take the difference in signature to indicate that the textual revisions of the first are Coleridge's, and of the second, Wordsworth's. I do indeed suspect that there is more than the accidental in the choice of signatures for the newspaper poems; even if some of them had meaning only for Wordsworth, may this not have been Coleridge's device for indicating his varying shades of indebtedness? 13 Table of Abbreviations, Etc.

The Brown Quarto Notebook, DCP. MS.4, contains the several MS. versions of the poem. It is drafted on pp. 6,11,13-17,20, and on pp. 21-23 is in part, perhaps entirely, a fair copy with later inserted revisions. All is in Wordsworth's hand. De Selincourt ( WPW . I, 312-14) obtained his variant text from the fair copy but omitted the revised readings there and thus obscured the fact that in many places the MP. version is not unlike the revised text in MS.4. In one respect, however, the two versions are quite unlike: the early anti-religious feeling has been removed for the MP. publication. Page 21 of MS.4 contains a draft of lines 1-16 and includes after line 16 an entire verse suppressed in the newspaper version. Only a stub remains of the next page, p.21/22. On the recto of this stub there is clearly space for five stanzas. The initial letters indicate that the two bottommost stanzas were lines 33-40. Of the twelve lines above these only the seventh and eighth lines have clear initial letters; each begins with A. This suggests lines 27 and 28. One might assume, therefore, that lines 5-12 of p.21/22 were lines 25-32 of the WPW. text. What then were the first four lines? Possibly they were one of the two stanzas, lines 17-24. Neither of these stanzas, however, exists in draft form in MS.4, whereas all other stanzas do. So we have no help here. Presumably one of these stanzas did appear at the top of p. 21/22 recto, while the other was written to take the place of the rejected anti-religious stanza (lines 16/17) which appears at the bottom of p. 21 of MS. 4. It is at least possible that this change from an anti-religious to a somewhat pietistic sentiment is Wordsworth's and not Coleridge's as it was not removed when the text was prepared for the Lyrical Ballads . The various versions in the MS. are collated below against the MP. text: 1-4. The Sun was dilating his orb in the West; And the still Season's mellowing charm, Diffus'd thro' all Nature, was felt in the breast, And the breast became kindly and warm. MP. When extending his beams the mild sun[[in]]&lt;from&gt; the west Diffuses that [[exquisite]] &lt;soft mellowing&gt; charm Which [[mellows each thought and]] &lt;felt through all nature&gt; illumines the breast With tender benevolence warm MS.4,p.21. There are two drafts of this stanza on p.15; one is identical with the uncorrected version on p. 21 (above), the other and first version is as follows: When extending his radiance the sun from the west Diffuses thought [sic] tenderest charm And the labourer [space in MS.] but an hour from his rest Lifts his mattock with [space in MS.] arm MS.4,p.15 5-8 And must I then part from these objects so fair? In the pain of my spirit I said: But, subduing the thought, I made haste to repair To the Cell where the CONVICT is laid. MP. &lt;And must we then part from these objects so fair&gt; [[When the labourer just ending the task of the day]] &lt;In the pain of my spirit I said&gt; More chearily presses his spade &lt;Nor impelled by the thought was I slow to repair&gt; Then feeling the price of existence I stray To the cell where the convict is laid MS.4,p.21. On p. 15 there is an alternative draft for line 5: "Then quitting the pleasure that [. . .] in [. . .]"; this is crossed through. 9-12 The thick-ribbed walls that o'ershadow the gate Resound—and the dungeons unfold: I pause; and at length, through the glimmering grate That outcast of pity behold. MP. Only one line is thoroughly reworked: line 11 on p. 16, MS.4, first read: I[[stand]] &lt;pause&gt; my sight clears&gt; And my eyeballs expanding at length [?the] grate On p. 21 the line becomes: I pause — my sight clears — and at length through the grate Otherwise line 12 has "beholds" for "behold" on p. 21 and "[[pity]] behold &lt;hope can behold&gt;" on p. 16. 13-16 His black matted hair on his shoulder is bent, And deep is the sigh of his breath; While with stedfast dejection his eye is intent On the fetters that link him to death! MP . Lines 13 and 14 differ little from MP. in MS. versions: p. 21 has "bosom" for "shoulder", and in the draft on p. 13 the convict is addressed directly: "Thy black matted head . . ." etc. On p. 13, line 15 first read: "While thou countest the slow-pacing moments intent". On p. 21, it becomes: "While he numbers the slow-pacing minutes, intent". Line 16 has the variant "linked thee" instead of "link him" on p. 13. 17-24 'Tis sorrow enough on that visage to gaze, That body dismiss'd from his care; But my fancy has pierc'd to his heart, and pourtrays More terrible images there. His bones are consum'd, and his life blood is dried In wishes the past to undo; And his crime, thro' the pains that o'erwhelm him, descried, Still blackens and grows on his view. MP. It is worth noting that de Selincourt has omitted two variants here: 19 But] Yet Lyrical Ballads ; 22 In ] With Lyrical Ballads . These two stanzas do not appear in the MS. in either fair copy or draft form. Nor are they traceable on the stubs. Possibly they were written specially for the MP. and replace the following MS. stanza which is not found in any printed version: From the mighty destroyers the plagues of their kind What corner of earth is at rest While Fame with great joy blows her trumpet behind And the work by Religion is blest MS.4,p.21 This is identical with the draft version on p. 11 except that "at" is omitted from "at rest". 25-28 When from the dark Synod, or blood-reeking field, To his chamber the MONARCH is led, All soothers of sense their soft virtue shall yield, And silent attention shall pillow his head. MP. De Selincourt has omitted a variant here: 28 "And quietness pillow his head." Lyrical Ballads . The stub of MS.4, p. 21/22 suggests but does not establish that this stanza was copied there. The draft versions on pp. 13 and 17 are identical with the MP. version; p. 13, line 25, "black" has been written over to become "dark". A single line, a draft of 28, exists on p. 14: "And Silent Attention must pillow their head". 29-32. If the less guilty CONVICT a moment would doze, And oblivion his tortures appease, On the iron that galls him his limbs must repose In the damp-dripping vault of disease. MP. There are no initial letters remaining on the stub of p. 21/22 which can clearly belong to this stanza. Two incomplete lines are drafted on p. 20: When Nature herself a short respite might sign And grief self-exhausted might 33-36 When full fain he would sleep, and has patiently tried No longer his body to turn, And the iron that enters so deep in his side Has enter'd too deep to be borne; MP. De Selincourt prints "had" for MP. "has" in line 33. Initial letters remaining on the stub of p. 21/22 suggest that the fair copy of this stanza had been on this missing page. The same initial letters appear in a draft of the stanza on p. 13: When fixed resolution to slumber applied Forbids thee thy body to turn And the iron that enters so deep in thy side At length can no longer be born An earlier working appears on p. 13 also: But th[[ou]]&lt;ee&gt; forced by hunger one moment to swerve [[Deep [. . .] thy]] [space in MS.] fetters must bear The bloodhounds of [?conscience] must bear Which the tossings of anguish can hardly preserve From the rust of the tears of Despair The last two lines of this draft are repeated on p. 22 and are written out again on p. 13 with only a slight variant: can hardly preserve] are all that preserve p. 13. 37-40 While the jail-mastiff howls at the dull-clanking chain, From the roots of his hair there shall start A thousand sharp punctures of cold-sweating pain, And terror shall leap at his heart! MP. The final initial letters on the stub of p. 21/22 again suggest that the stanza was originally copied there. There are slight variants in the draft on p. 13: 37 jail mastiff ] [[loud]] &lt;jail&gt; mastiff; 38 his ] thy; 40 his ] thy. The earlier working on p. 11 is identical with the uncorrected version on p. 13 except for: 37 dull-clanking chain ] clink of thy chain 41-44 But now he half-raises his deep-sunken eye, And the motion unsettles a tear! It seems the low voice of despair to supply And asks of me, why I am here? MP. There is no early draft of this stanza. The version on p.22 of MS.4 varies only slightly from the MP. text; line 43 reads in the fair copy: That seems the mute voice of despair to supply p. 22. 45-48 Poor victim! no idle intruder has stood With o'er weening complacence our states to compare; But one whose first wish is the wish to be good, Is come as a brother thy sorrows to share. MP. The last three lines of this stanza are on p. 22 of MS.4. The only variant is "state" for "states", 46. 49-52 At thy name, though compassion her nature resign, Tho' in virtue's proud mouth thy report be a stain My care, if the arm of the mighty were mine, Would plant thee where yet thou might'st blossom again. MP. Except for the mis-spelling of "arm" as "army" (51) the version of this stanza on p. 22 of MS.4 is identical with that of MP. 53-56 Vain wish! yet misdeem not that vainly I grieve — When vengeance has quitted her grasp on thy frame, My pity thy children and wife shall reprieve From the dangers that wait round the dwellings of shame. MP. This stanza was omitted from the Lyrical Ballads . The version of this stanza on p. 22 of MS. 4 shows one variant reading, line 54: &lt;[[thy]] vengeance has lost hold &lt;grasp&gt; on thy frame&gt; When [[thy soul]] shall repose from that heartgnawing flame p. 22 There are a further two stanzas in MS.4 which were never printed by Wordsworth: 57-60 &lt;And Mercy forbid&gt; [[Farewell! and Heaven grant]] that the voice of a friend Be [[not]] lost in this season of uttermost woe &lt;For [?he] to the grave where his terrors must end&gt; To the grave where thy terrors [[must soon have]] an end Not entirely rejected of men dost thou go. MS.4,p.23. The draft on p. 20 is identical with the uncorrected version above except for "moment" instead of "season" in line 58. 61-64 For us who remain — is there one but may die By the murders which men to their fellows allow Or one who self-questioned can inly reply That he is more worthy of being than thou? MS.4,p.23. There are no other versions of this stanza. 1798 * February 13, MP. Translation of a Celebrated Greek Song . Signed "PUBLICOSA." There are two MS. versions of this poem, both in DCP. The earlier is in the Windy Brow notebook (pages 34 and 36) and is printed by de Selincourt ( WPW. I, 299-300). The second is a formal autograph copy on a single sheet and it was printed by Knight ("A Lost Wordsworth Fragment", The Classical Review , XV [1901], 82). This manuscript came to Knight from Mary Carr who found it among the papers of the Quaker, Thomas Wilkinson. Wilkinson was in the habit of giving his poems to Wordsworth (I know of three), and this translation must have been a reciprocal gesture. This formal copy — the Wilkinson MS. — cannot be dated before the very end of 1799, when Wordsworth came to Grasmere and presumably soon got to know Wilkinson. This must account for Knight's date of 1800. The MS. versions are collated below against the MP. text and it becomes clear that the Wilkinson MS. (c. 1800) is closer to the Windy Brow text (c. 1795) than it is to that of the MP. Probably, then, Coleridge revised and sent the poem to the newspaper. That he had an interest in this "celebrated Greek Song" is undeniable. In a copy of Ritson's A Select Collection of English Songs (1783), I, x, Coleridge has noted in the margin against another translation of this same poem: O the / Crush of / Dullness! / The substan/tial Flatness ,/ of this version! / It reminds /me of Southey's/ remark/ on two/ versions of/ Milton,/ that M./ had been/ overset / ("overgeset") / into Dutch/ and /traduced/ (traduit) / in French./ S.T.C. (Quoted by kind permission of Mrs. Dickson, The Stepping Stones, Ambleside.) The revisions made for the MP. text seem to suggest Coleridge and the demands of the newspaper: the poem is put into regular and presentable stanza form (at the expense of the accuracy of the translation); Wordsworth's consistent spelling "Aristogiton" becomes "Aristogeiton", i.e. the Greek and not the Latin spelling is used; finally, the signature "PUBLICOSA" perhaps implies that the poem is not wholly Wordsworth's, for, as we noted earlier, poems entirely Wordsworth's seem to have been signed "W. W." or "MORTIMER". Neither Wordsworth's nor Coleridge's interest in the poem can be dated with accuracy. Even Coleridge's marginalia in Ritson is undated but probably both poets knew the poem from schooldays. It appeared in Greek and Latin versions in school text books (see, for example, Poetae Graeci: sive Selecta ex Homeri Odyss. etc. 1814, which was in use at Eton). It is incidentally worth remembering that the poem is no evidence of Wordsworth's knowledge of Greek, for the translation might just as easily be "From the Latin". De Selincourt's date of 1794 is undoubtedly too late. It is, of course, likely that the poem was copied into the Windy Brow notebook at this date, but it belongs probably to Wordsworth's schoolboy translations. Indeed, in the Prelude (X, 159-176) he mentions Harmodius and Aristogiton in connexion with truths that are "the commonplaces of the Schools, A theme for boys." The Windy Brow and Wilkinson MSS. are collated against the MP. text which appears below: TRANSLATION OF A CELEBRATED GREEK SONG. 1 I will bear my vengeful blade, With the myrtle boughs array'd, As Harmodius before, As Aristogetion bore: 5 When the tyrants' breast they gor'd With the myrtle-braided sword; Gave to triumph freedom's cause, Gave to Athens equal laws. 9 Where, Harmodius! art thou fled? We deem thee not among the dead. Dear son of fame! 'tis thine to rest In the islands of the blest; 13 Where old Mœonides reclin'd, Still pours in song his mighty mind; While Achilles list'ning nigh, Nods his helmed head for joy. 17 I will bear my vengeful blade, With the myrtle boughs array'd, As Harmodius did before, As Aristogeiton bore! 21 Let thy name, Harmodius dear!

"If grief dismiss me not to them that rest". Signed "W.W." A full manuscript of this poem exists in the Racedown notebook (DCP.). De Selincourt mentions also "another MS."; he does not describe the MS. and my own search has not brought it to light. His readings of this MS. then ( WPW. I, 308), are simply quoted in the collation below. There is a draft of the whole sonnet on f.32 v of the Racedown notebook and on f.33 the first six lines are copied in what is clearly their more final version. De Selincourt has printed these first six lines and completed the sonnet with the version on f.32 v . Corrected readings are presented in the collation. The sonnet was republished with some further variants in MP. for February 2, 1802 with the following title, in which Wordsworth acknowledges his source: FROM PETRARCH. Si la mia vita de l'aspro tormento, &amp;c. De Selincourt did not note this second MP. text. The translation probably belongs to Wordsworth's Cambridge period. His familiarity with Petrarch is clear from Descriptive Sketches (1793); lines 165-66 are an acknowledged translation from a Petrarchan sonnet. The MP. (1798) text is as follows. Other versions are collated against this. If grief dismiss me not to them that rest 'Till age, thou lovely maid! those starry fires Unwatch'd extinguish, and the young desires Forget those vermil lips, that rising breast, And those bright locks, that on thy shoulders play At will; and from thy forehead time displace The vernal garland, with'ring ev'ry grace Which bids concealment on my spirit prey Haply my bolder tongue may then reveal The prison annals of a life of tears! And if the chill time on the softer joys Smile not, a broken heart perchance may feel Sad solace from the unforbidden sighs, Heav'd for the fruitless lapse of vernal years. 2 'Till age, thou lovely maid! ] Till the gray morn of age Racedown MS.ff.32 v and 33. lovely ] beauteous MP.

It is interesting that the revised 1802 version is closer to the original Italian. [March 8, MP. The Old Man of the Alps . Signed "NICIAS ERYTHRÆUS." In her article, "Coleridge's Use of Wordsworth's Juvenilia" ( PMLA , LXV [1950], 422), Professor Smyser tentatively questions on grounds of internal evidence whether this poem is not Wordsworth's rather than Coleridge's. Indeed, the evidence of signature (see note on pseudonymns above) points to possible Wordsworth elements, even origins, but the poem essentially, like "Lewti", is the work of Coleridge. Those elements that are apparently Wordsworth's cannot be adduced as clear evidence of his authorship since they anticipate rather than echo other Wordsworth poems ("The Thorn", "Her eyes were wild"). Nor can a concordance test help since so much mutual borrowing existed between Wordsworth and Coleridge, 1797-98. But the poem, undoubtedly, is mainly Coleridge's and certainly in a letter to his wife of November [23], 1802, he mentions it in a possessive enough way: "If I want the Old Man of the Alps, I will write for it." He is referring most probably to a copy of the poem (now in Dove Cottage Library) sent him in a letter from Francis Wrangham dated April 5, 1802. This copy is identical with the MP. text. Wrangham has written his letter so that the copy of the poem can be detached from his private letter to Coleridge. He writes: "I have left this part blank, that you might be able to disjoin the verses from the letter, if you think your printer can read my MS. &amp; wish to spare yourself the trouble of a transcript." Wrangham had probably seen Coleridge during the latter's visit to Gallow Hill early in March and had learnt of Coleridge's plan to publish a third edition of Poems ; at the same time he seems to have extracted from Coleridge a promise to send him "some account of what [he] had read or meditated upon the Middle State." He had clearly hoped for an early response and he continues in his letter: Anxious however as I am for the result of your studies or thoughts upon that or any other subject, I did not mean that you should explore it personally for my satisfaction; and therefore, if you would oblige me, let all you say be theory only, and defer actual and experimental statement as long as you can. Your speculations I shall consider as highly valuable, and as a bribe enclose you some good English verses called "The old Man of the Alps". Presumably Wrangham was one of those who had known of Coleridge's newspaper contributions in 1798 and had either taken the Morning Post or had had copies of Coleridge's poems sent him by some mutual friend. In any event, his letter does much to establish Coleridge's authorship. Mr. Erdman justly suggests that Southey's letter to Coleridge of December 15, 1799 (published by I. Ehrenpreis, Notes and Queries , March 18, 1950, p.125) supports my thesis. This letter is not without its difficulties. Southey wrote, "If you can procure me the conclusion of Francini &amp; the Hermit of the Alps, by referring to the filed papers—why I should be glad of them in the volume." On December 19, Coleridge replied, "I do not know how to get the conclusion of Mrs Robinson's poem for you—perhaps it were better omitted." Mrs. Robinson's "The Hermit of the Alps" might at first glance appear to be the Hermit poem alluded to, but since both Southey's and Coleridge's remarks are in the context of a discussion of Coleridge's own contributions to the second volume of the Annual Anthology , this is unlikely. "Mrs Robinson's poem" must refer to Coleridge's complimentary verses to Mrs. Robinson, "The Apotheosis, or the Snowdrop", signed "Francini" and published in MP , January 3, 1798 (Erdman, Werkmeister and Woof, "Unrecorded Coleridge Variants", Studies in Bibliography XIV, 241). Southey himself was clearly referring to this poem in his reply to Coleridge on December 24: "The Francini piece I thought Stuart might supply—does he not file the papers?" (from a transcript in Victoria College Library, Toronto). Unless it appeared in one of the four missing issues of 1798, Mrs. Robinson's "Hermit of the Alps" was never published in MP ; this strengthens the view that Southey's use of that title referred not to her poem, but to Coleridge's "Old Man of the Alps".] †April 11, MP. Lines imitated from Catullus . Signed "MORTIMER." The earliest MS of this poem is a two-line fragment, lines 17-18, on page 8 of DCP.MS.4. The handwriting here is that elaborate copper-plate that Wordsworth used as a schoolboy for making fair copies of his poems. "To Lesbia" then can be dated prior to Wordsworth's departure for Cambridge in 1787, some seven years before de Selincourt's suggested date. The whole poem probably, was originally copied into MS.4 since, from the evidence of the stubs, at least three leaves have been torn out between page 7 and the last two lines of the poem at the top of page 8. There is a full MS of the poem in the Racedown notebook, folios 17 v and 19 (should be 18, but the pages are wrongly numbered), and it is this version that de Selincourt used for his text ( WPW. I, 306). The copy contains some slight revisions (lines 3,4, 5/6,14) and it was perhaps for this reason that de Selincourt ascribed the translation to 1795-97. The third MS (which seems to be in Dorothy Wordsworth's hand) is in BM. Add.MS.27,902. This text was possibly taken from the Racedown notebook sometime between December, 1797 and March,1798 (i.e. after Coleridge had accepted the offer to write for MP. ). The largely destroyed fair copy in MS.4 can throw no light on the British Museum text; as the latter repeats the Racedown space in line 3, it must have been made from either the Racedown text or a common original (which might have been in MS.4). Hitherto the version in BM.Add. MS.27, 902 has been thought by all editors to be in Coleridge's hand and thus it has been the basis for two independent printings: that of MP. and that of H.N.Coleridge in Literary Remains (1836), I, 274. In CPW. I, 60-61, E. H. Coleridge (after J. D. Campbell) reprints without explanation the text as it is given in Literary Remains ; he makes three corrections, two from Add. MS.27,902 and one from MP. , and he adds a new title — "To Lesbia". The collation of the MSS, MP. and Literary Remains ( LR. ) texts is presented below against the version printed by de Selincourt. There is not title or epigraph in any MS; MP. has title given above; LR. adds epigraph: " Lugete, O Veneres, Cupidinesque . CATULLUS." 1 love and live ] love &amp; love 27,902. 3 When first transcribed into the Racedown notebook, line 3 was incomplete — a space was left at the beginning. Wordsworth inserted a reading, crossed it out, making it almost illegible, and then wrote in the published phrase: [[?yon [. . .] ?cold]]&lt;Each cold restraint each&gt;every boding fear 4 her ] his MP. ] its LR. 4/5 In Racedown MS. a fragmentary line, largely illegible, begins: And thought [. . .] 5 Yon sun ] The Sun MP. 7 our [space in Racedown MS.] light ] our mortal light MP. ] our little light LR. 9 I live ] I'll live LR. 13/14 In the Racedown MS.

The 36-line fragment found on pages 10,12, 14,16 of DCP.MS.4 and presented (without variants) in WPW. I, 263-64 has been recognized since 1941 as the source of Coleridge's "Lewti", a poem which little resembles its Wordsworth original and in MP. was even three times its length. There are three other MSS of the poem: one in BM.Add. MS.27,902, hitherto thought to be in Coleridge's hand, but apparently in Dorothy Wordsworth's; two later ones in BM. Add.MS.35,343, ff.2 and 3, both in Coleridge's hand. These three MSS are presented by E.H. Coleridge ( CPW. II,1049-52). De Selincourt's reading of MS.4 is incomplete; precise readings of MS.4 are given below and any changes between MS.4 and MS. 27,902 are indicated. 2 [[To wander from the form I lov'd x ]] To forget the form I loved 27,902.

The asterisks may indicate that lines have been omitted (the poem is headed "Fragment"), or may be simply decorative. There is no dependence between the punctuation of MS.4 and that of Add.MS.27,902; perhaps Dorothy took down the copy at the dictation of either Wordsworth or Coleridge.] †May 10, MP. "The hour-bell sounds, and I must go". Signed "MORTIMER." Few poems have been so consistently misrepresented. The two earliest MSS of the poem are in DCP.MS.4; there are drafts on pages 112-113 and a fair copy on page 87. Both are in Wordsworth's hand. Except for a reduction in punctuation and the variant in line 9, the fair copy is reproduced apparently in Dorothy Wordsworth's hand in BM.Add.MS.27,902, folio 2, and this, except for the addition of a note, one misprint and some punctuation, is the text published in MP . Add.MS.27,902 is the basis of the text given by H. N. Coleridge in Literary Remains (1836), I,275-76 under the added title, "Moriens Superstiti"; unfortunately, H. N. Coleridge also gave the title, "Morienti Superstes", to another fragment in Add.MS.27,902, "Yet thou art happier far than she". He thus suggested a connexion between the two which they simply do not have; the fragment, "Yet thou art happier far than she", is on page 6 of MS.4, some eighty pages from "The hour-bell sounds . . ." De Selincourt's suggestion that the former fragment is a conclusion to Wordsworth's "Death of a Starling" ( WPW .I,263) is most likely, particularly if we realize that that poem was probably meant to be an imitation rather than an exact translation of Catullus. The titles introduced into Literary Remains have not been without result, one consequence being E. H. Coleridge's presentation of the two poems as one ( CPW. I,61-62), and his apparent assumption that they had appeared together in the Morning Post . Accepting this information at its face value, Professor Jane Worthington Smyser ("Coleridge's Use of Words-worth's Juvenilia" PMLA , LXV [1950], 422-25) proves on the basis of the two poems' appearance in MP. that both were by Wordsworth (which is of course true), that they had an essential relation with each other, and finally that de Selincourt's association of "Yet thou art happier far . . ." with "Death of a Starling" was wrong. For corroborating evidence Professor Smyser naturally cites Add.MS.27,902. The wheel thus comes full circle, for it was this manuscript that first suggested a connexion between the two poems to H. N. Coleridge. Professor Smyser has prolonged the first error, and simply shifted it from Coleridge to Wordsworth. Thus, the note to entry 376 in the Coleridge Notebooks I, and a note on page 375 of "Addenda to the Second Edition", WPW. I, need correction. For some reason "The hour-bell sounds . . ." is not given in WPW. and I present the text below as it appeared in MP. It was preceded by a note: The two following Verses from the French, never before published, were written by a French Prisoner, as he was preparing to go to the Guillotine. 1 The hour-bell sounds, and I must go: Death waits! — again I hear him calling.

An Ode, in Mrs. Ratcliff's Manner . Signed "CASSIANI jun." Never collected or acknowledged by Coleridge. It was attributed to him because of its appearance with his signature in The Wild Wreath (1804), edited by M. E. Robinson. For the text see CPW. I, 347-49. We have no certain evidence of the authorship. The curious resemblance of the second stanza of this poem to the first stanza of Wordsworth's Intimations Ode, and of the whole poem to Wordsworth's "'Tis said that some have died for love" has been extensively and ingeniously discussed by S. M. Parrish and D. V. Erdman ("Who Wrote The Mad Monk ? A Debate", Bulletin of The New York Public Library , LXIV [1960], 209-237). Mr. Parrish concludes that the poem is by Wordsworth, Mr. Erdman that it is a parody of Wordsworth by Coleridge. Of their many speculations two require comment here: first, the resemblance to "'Tis said that some have died for love" needs not imply parody, but rather a lazy borrowing in what is presumably a hasty composition; second, the suggestion that the Intimations Ode was begun in 1800, while not impossible, is not more plausible than de Selincourt's view that it belongs to 1802 ( WPW. IV, 465; incidentally, in his note de Selincourt wrongly dates "The Mad Monk" 1801). The only known facts about "The Mad Monk", besides the resemblances, are that it appeared in 1800 and again in 1804 with some minor changes. The rest is hypothesis. I suggest Coleridge wrote "The Mad Monk" with parody in mind perhaps, though not of Wordsworth; the title itself points to Mrs. Radcliffe (there is perhaps some faint abuse in the mis-spelt name), but the poem generally seems to be an imitation of the kind of writing that Wordsworth and Coleridge attacked, "the frantic novels, sickly and stupid German tragedies . . . idle and extravagant stories in verse", where feeling "gives importance to the action and situation, and not the action and situation to the feeling" ( Preface , 1800). The poem seems to be directed chiefly at Mrs. Radcliffe, but it recalls Mrs. Robinson too and even hints, perhaps, at Joseph Cottle. In Mrs. Radcliffe's Italian (1797,III,222-34) there is a situation where a monk, "nearly frantic", confesses to the murder of his beloved when jealousy came and lit his "passions into madness". Coleridge's amused interest in Mrs. Radcliffe continues as late as October, 1810, when he writes to Words-worth about the monotony of her recipe for romance. In Mrs. Robinson's work there are similarly Gothic situations and she has too that more gentle elegiac note which pervades "The Mad Monk" and runs alongside the drama. One must not underestimate the similarity between "The Mad Monk" and Mrs. Robinson's "Anselmo, The Hermit of the Alps". A third modern writer is perhaps mockingly alluded to in the phrase, "The Mad Monk". Coleridge had remembered some remarks of Lamb's about Joseph Cottle's Alfred . Lamb wrote to Coleridge on August 26: Now I am touching so deeply upon poetry, can I forget that I have just received from Cottle a magnificent copy of his Guinea Epic. Four-and-twenty Books to read in the dog-days! I got as far as the Mad Monk the first day, &amp; fainted. Mr. Cottle's genius strongly points him to the Pastoral , but his inclinations divert him perpetually from his calling. It is not clear which character Lamb is referring to as Cottle's "Mad Monk", but it is clear that Coleridge enjoyed Lamb's remarks; indeed, on November 1, he quoted them almost verbatim to Josiah Wedgewood and they were perhaps in his mind when he wrote the poem. Some of his friends, at least, might have recognized in the title an oblique allusion to one of the most preposterous of modern compositions. The idea of writing a poem that mingled elements imitated from other writers could have come to Coleridge from the pages of the Morning Post itself : Mrs. Robinson had published on September 11 a poem "in the manner of the Antient English Poets", an enigmatic "H" had published on October 2 a poem entitled "Imitation of Modern Poetry, An attempt at the simple". 14 In a letter to Stuart of October 7, Coleridge comments on this last poem, asks for the name of the author, and continues, "It was very droll — the only fault . . . and mingled the vices of other kinds of poetry . . .". The letter is unfortunately fragmentary, but it is clear that Coleridge could not entirely approve "H's" imitation. In "The Mad Monk" perhaps we have an indication of his own notion of how to imitate the Moderns. This is not so bold a conjecture when we realize that the fragmentary letter to Stuart probably contained the text of "The Mad Monk" for the newspaper. The imitation of October 2 is merely a crude burlesque; Coleridge's poem is more. Besides the element of parody there is some genuine poetry and I suggest, leaving aside the 1804 signature and the general interests outlined above, that the poetry is Coleridge's, not Wordsworth's. There is nowhere in it that characteristic near awkwardness that comes from Wordsworth's insistence on expressing the precise detail of his observation or vision. Phrases like "the forest's dark recess", "the smooth green turf", "the margin of the flood" are generalized, expected; their effect is cumulative, not single and clear as Wordsworth's so often is. Coleridge's poem, in his own and others' manner, is far from being a success but it is more than an imitation. Wordsworth himself had shown in "The Idiot Boy" how it was possible to make fun of a literary style (Burger's) without abandoning an interest in the passions of man. In "The Mad Monk" Coleridge underlines some literary habits and at the same time creates what one might call a gothic pastoral elegy. His imitation reveals without destroying and it may be that he sent a copy to Mrs. Robinson and had no need to feel any qualm of conscience. In this way, perhaps, "The Mad Monk" came into the Wild Wreath under Coleridge's signature. The newspaper signature, "CASSIANI jun.", can, I suspect, mean many things to many critics but the explanation most in tune with Coleridge's critical assessment of what he imitated comes from the note in Bayle's Dictionary on Cassius Longinus (Lucius): "It is from the judical severity of this Cassius, that very rigid Judges have been called Cassiani ." (See A General Dictionary, Historical and Critical . . . of Mr. Bayle , Translated, London, 1739, IV, 166.) There is a parallel to the "jun." in this signature in Coleridge's later "Job junior, circumbendiborum patientissimus"; significantly, this signs a light-hearted verse (see his letter to Poole, September, 1807). * October 14, MP.

Preceded by the following note which is signed "M.H.": Sir, It would be unpardonable in the author of the following lines, if he omitted to acknowledge that the metre (with the exception of the burthen) is borrowed from "The Haunted Beach of Mrs. ROBINSON;" a most exquisite Poem, first given to the public, if I recollect, aright, in your paper, and since then republished in the second volume of Mr. SOUTHEY'S Annual Anthology. This acknowledgement will not appear superfluous to those who have felt the bewitching effect of that absolutely original stanza in the original Poem, and who call to mind that the invention of a metre has so widely diffused the name of Sappho, and almost constitutes the present celebrity of Alcæus. The author of this paragraph is presumably Coleridge. He seems to be acknowledging here both his own admiration and friendship for Mrs. Robinson and Wordsworth's metrical debt to her in the poem. Both Wordsworth and Coleridge were likely to have an interest in "The Haunted Beach" since, by its allusions to "The Ancient Mariner," it brought a compliment to Coleridge, but primarily because it was metrically new and interesting. Coleridge had shown his enthusiasm immediately; he wrote to Southey on February 28, 1800: In the Morning Post was a poem of fascinating Metre by Mary Robinson — 'twas on Wednesday, Feb. 26. — &amp; entitled the Haunted Beach. I was so struck with it that I sent to her to desire that [it] might be preserved in the Anthology — She was extremely flattered by the Idea of it's being there, as she idolizes you &amp; your Doings. So if it be not too late, I pray you, let it be in — if you should not have received that Day's paper, write immediately that I may transcribe it — it falls off sadly to the last — wants Tale — &amp; Interest; but the Images are new &amp; very distinct — that 'silvery carpet' is so just , that it is unfortunate it should seem so bad — for it is really good — but the Metre — ay! that Woman has an Ear. Perhaps Coleridge had suggested the experiment to Wordsworth. "The Solitude of Binnorie" in fact is an exercise in two ways: first, it is an adaptation of Frederica Brun's "Die Sieben Hügel", as Wordsworth himself acknowledged; second, in its metrical intricacy, it is based on Mrs. Robinson's "Haunted Beach". Wordsworth still had that interest in versification that he had shown in Lyrical Ballads (1798), and in 1800 he turned it towards the imitation of the complex, even unsuitable metres of others. Such a technical interest is revealed in "Ellen Irwin", written perhaps a little earlier than "The Solitude of Binnorie"; the somewhat unfortunate stanza there is fundamentally that of Bürger's Leonora . In "The Solitude of Binnorie" Wordsworth follows Mrs. Robinson closely, keeping strictly to the line stresses, the intricate end rhymes, and the internal rhyme, but where she has nine lines, Wordsworth has eleven. Mrs. Robinson's ninth line is always a variant of "Where the green billows play'd", a kind of loose refrain; Wordsworth's two extra lines are used for his refrain: "Sing mournfully, oh! mournfully,/ The solitude of Binnorie!" Here he imitates the refrain of Frederica Brun's poem: "Singt: Leide! Leide! Leide!" and borrows his phrasing from the Scottish ballad, "The Twa Sisters". For a further discussion of the relation of Wordsworth's and Frederica Brun's poems, see, Theodor Zeiger, "Wordsworths Stellung zur deutschen Litteratur", Studien zur vergleichenden Litteraturgeschichte I,273-290. Berlin,1901. Wordsworth finished writing "The Solitude of Binnorie" on August 17, 1800 (see Dorothy's Journal , I,55). Perhaps it was because the poem was so patently an exercise of metre and adaptation that he excluded it from the forthcoming second volume of Lyrical Ballads . When Coleridge was at Grasmere, October 5-7, Wordsworth had already sent to Bristol on September 15, a group of poems for Lyrical Ballads . As Dorothy's Journal shows (I, 64), Coleridge was expressing his distress at having to write for Stuart, and perhaps it was in this October visit that Wordsworth gave Coleridge not only "The Solitude of Binnorie" but also two other poems which he had decided not to publish in Lyrical Ballads (see below, October 21 and November 24). Thus, when Coleridge arrived back in Keswick, he wrote to Stuart, possibly about his contributions. Unfortunately the letter is now only a fragment; it is dated October 7, 1800, and includes this remark: "I shall fill these Blanks with a few Poems—. It grieves me to hear of poor Mrs. Robinson's illness." "The Solitude of Binnorie" must have been sent to Stuart at this time, or along with the essays that Coleridge sent him on the following day. The poem was reprinted by Wordsworth in his Poems (1807) only at the request of Sir Walter Scott (see Wordsworth Letters, Middle Years , I,71 and I,105). For the text, see WPW. II, 146-48; de Selincourt has not noted the MP. publication and there are several interesting variants: Title. This was changed to: THE SEVEN SISTERS OR THE SOLITUDE OF BINNORIE. 3 You ] I MP. 5-8 A garland of seven lilies wrought! Seven Sisters that together dwell; But he, bold Knight as ever fought, Their Father, took of them no thought. WPW.

It is interesting that lines 51, 52 are very similar to the MS. version quoted by de Selincourt: The sisters ran like Mountain Sheep, And in together did they leap 57-58 As through the glen it rambles, Repeats a moan WPW. As down the rock it ambles, Doth make a moan MP. 60-61 Seven little Islands, green and bare, Have risen from out the deep: WPW.

De Selincourt does not note this 1807 variant. †October 21, MP. Inscription for a Seat by a Road Side , Half Way up a Steep Hill, Facing the South . Signed "VENTIFRONS." This poem was never republished by either Wordsworth or Coleridge. E. H. Coleridge printed the MP. text and attributed the poem to Coleridge (see CPW. I, 349-50). There are two misreadings in the CPW. text: line 19 "on those" should read "on them"; line 27 " thy motions high" should read "thy motions light". De Selincourt discovered the poem in the Racedown notebook, rightly attributed it to Wordsworth and printed from the fair copy in the MS. (see WPW. I, 301-302). There are misreadings and omissions in de Selincourt's text and his collation of the MS. with the MP. text is imperfect. A full collation is given below. There are drafts of the poem on folios 11 v , 12, 19, 19 v , and 20 of the Racedown notebook. The drafts reveal how thoroughly Wordsworth applied himself to the composition of this poem but they do not differ significantly from the fair copy on folios 22-24 and so the slight variants and repetitions of the drafts are not indicated in the following collation. The fair copy contains some revisions not noted by de Selincourt and these are now presented. The poem cannot be dated with any certainty; de Selincourt dates it 1797 on the grounds that he detects the hand of Mary Hutchinson. It must at least belong to sometime after May, 1794, when Wordsworth was staying at Windy Brow ("Ventifrons") and wrote an octosyllabic poem on the same subject (see WPW. I, 300). Whenever this latter poem was revised, it was perhaps not immediately turned into blank verse. There is in one of the Racedown drafts a beginning in heroic couplets. This clearly was soon discarded and Wordsworth concentrates on blank verse. Lines 1 and 2 of the three stages are as follows: Ye, who with buoyant spirits blessed And rich in vigour need not rest, 1794 poem. Thou who with [[store of]] youthful vigour [[blest]] &lt;rich and light&gt; [[And light]] with youthful thoughts dost need no rest MS.f.22 Thou who with youthful vigour rich and light With youthful thoughts dost need no rest — MS.f.22 v The revisions for the MP. publication are more sweeping and we do not know whether they are the work of Wordsworth or Coleridge. The Racedown MS. is collated below against the MP. text ( CPW. I, 349-50). The poem has no title in the MS. 2-5 O thou, To whom alike the valley and the hill Present a path of ease! Should e'er thine eye Glance on this sod, and this rude tablet, stop!

MP. of years and pain, that balm Which mid a tossing world shall soothe thy heart, Even till thou sink beneath the waves to Peace. MS. November 24, MP. Alcæus to Sappho . Unsigned. The only manuscript of this poem is in a letter from Coleridge to Stuart, October 7, 1800 (Coleridge Letters , I, 629), and hence Coleridge was thought to be the author ( CPW. I, 353). However, Wordsworth's authorship was proved by a letter to Coleridge of February, 1799 ( Early Letters , 222), in which he expresses a poor opinion of his poem but unfortunately quotes only the first line. Thus we do not know if and how far Coleridge revised the text; he obviously revised the title for MP. , turning the poem into a compliment to Mrs. Robinson. See also WPW.

To a Beautiful Young Lady, who had been harshly spoken of on account of her fondness for taking long walks in the country . Unsigned. For the text see WPW. II,287-88. De Selincourt states incorrectly that the poem appeared on February 11, 1802, omits the original title sentence and does not note that the 1802 text is identical with that in Poems (1807). †February 13, MP. Sonnet. Written at Evening . "Calm is all nature as a resting wheel". Unsigned. See WPW. I,3. Wordsworth thought of this sonnet as a schoolboy poem and in 1836 dated it 1786. There may be more truth in this dating than de Selincourt allows; the Racedown notebook, which contains, on folio 34, an almost complete MS. of the poem, tends to support Wordsworth's claim. The first 9½ lines appear there in what seems to be a fair copy, presumably entered 1795-97; there is then a space and the poem continues with the second half of line 11, drafted in a very rough hand. These last lines are: oh my friends restrain 12 Those busy cares that must renew my pain 13 Go near the [space in MS.] plant quick shall it feel 14 The fond officious touch and droop again De Selincourt completely omits line 13 in his presentation of the MS. Line 13, interestingly enough, is the one scrap of the poem that exists in MS.4. It appears at the top of page 88 and is possibly a later version of line 13 than that in the Racedown notebook, since it specifically brings in "mimosa" in place of "plant": Go [n/r?]ear the shrunk mimosa it shall feel The fond The mimosa appears again in MP. text. There was perhaps a copy of the entire poem on the page before 88, for it is clear from the stubs and watermarks that a page has been torn out between pages 87 and 88. Perhaps this copy was a revision of the Racedown text. De Selincourt notes MP. publication but does not collate it against the accepted 1807 text. Except for line 13, he presents the Racedown text and this is not included in the collation below. 2-7 The kine are couched upon the dewy grass; The horse alone, seen dimly as I pass, Is cropping audibly his later meal: Dark is the ground; a slumber seems to steal O'er vale, and mountain, and the starless sky.

MP. [†March 9, MP. Written in a Grotto . Unsigned. The poem was followed by a not insignificant note which has hitherto been overlooked: The shepherds of Smyrna shew a cave, where, as they say, LUNA descended to ENDYMION, and a bed under a large oak, which was the scene of their loves. — See CHANDLER'S Travels into Asia Minor. The poem has been conjecturally assigned to Wordsworth, though de Selincourt remarks that the "evidence is of the flimsiest" ( WPW. III,413-14 and note). De Selincourt wrongly dates MP. appearance as February 9 and the evidence becomes even more flimsy with the correct March 9 date as the poem is separated by a month from a group of three Wordsworth items in February. The note below the poem indicates Southey perhaps rather than Wordsworth or Coleridge, as, in 1801, in Thalaba , Southey had made specific reference to Chandler's Travels .] †September 16, MP. Sonnet . "I griev'd for Bonaparte . . ." Unsigned. Composed May 21, 1802 (see Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal for that date). Wordsworth probably handed this sonnet to Stuart directly, as we know that he dined with Stuart in the previous week (see introduction). It appeared again in MP. on January 29, 1803. For the text see WPW. III,110-111. De Selincourt wrongly dates the first MP. publication as September 6, 1802. Mrs. Moorman accepts this dating and adds incorrectly that the signature "W.L.D." was affixed to the poem ( William Wordsworth , I,570-71). October 9, MP. A notice appeared concerned with both Wordsworth and Coleridge: Monday last, W. WORDSWORTH, Esq. was married to Miss HUTCHINSON, of Wykeham, near Scarborough, and proceeded immediately, with his wife and his sister, for his charming cottage in the little Paradise — vale of Grasmere. His neighbour, Mr. COLERIDGE, resides in the vale of Keswick, 13 miles from Grasmere. His house (situated on a low hill at the foot of Skiddaw, with the Derwent Lake in front, and the romantic River Greta windidg [sic] round the hill) commands, perhaps, the most various and interesting prospects of any house in the island. It is a perfect panorama of that wonderful vale, with its two lakes, and its complete circle, or rather ellipse, of mountains. De Quincey, and Mrs. Moorman after him ( William Wordsworth ,I,575), "understood that the whole affair [above notice in MP. ] was an unseasonable jest of Coleridge's or Lamb's." But De Quincey's account reads like an imperfect recollection of a conversation: I have heard that there was a paragraph inserted on this occasion in the Morning Post or Courier — and I have an indistinct remembrance of having once seen it myself — which described this event of the poet's marriage in the most ludicrous terms of silly pastoral sentimentality; the cottage being described as "the abode of content and all the virtues," the vale itself in the same puerile slang, and the whole event in the style of allegorical trifling about the Muses, &amp;c. ( Recollections of the Lake Poets , ed. E.Sackville-West,1948, p.163.) Dorothy Wordsworth, however, put the blame on Stuart, for when, on Coleridge's expected return from Malta, a similar notice appeared in the Morning Post , she wrote to Lady Beaumont: "You must know that this is one way that Stuart adopts of obliging his Friends. Upon my Brother's marriage he inserted in the Morning Post the most ridiculous paragraph that ever was penned." ( Early Letters , 515, August 7,1805.) 1803 * January 13, MP.

This translation is now first attributed to Wordsworth. The text is as follows: LAURA, farewell my LAURA! 'Tis come, that hour distressing; How shall I live, my blessing, So far from thee? Sorrows will still pursue me, No good will e'er come to me; And thou, who knowst if ever Thou wilt remember me? Let, at least, in the footing Of my peace that is departed, Some thoughts heavy-hearted Thy pursuivants be: Though far off, still in union, I will be thy companion; And thou, who knowst if ever Thou wilt remember me! Although there is no MS. extant of this poem, it can safely be included among Wordsworth's Italian translations of the end of 1802 (see Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal , I, 185, 188). Of five other translations from Metastasio, four are published in the MP. The Italian of this cantata is not included in Agostino Isola's collection from which Wordsworth translated the other five poems, but we know that it was one of the most popular of Metastasio's short poems (see J.C. Fucilla, "The European and American Vogue of Metastasio's Shorter Poems", Studies and Notes , Naples-Rome [1953], 335-36). In addition, coincidence and similarity of style imply Wordsworth's authorship; there are references to Laura, for example, both in this translation and in the next (appearing in MP. October 22) as it appears in an unpublished MS. now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. There is no reference to Laura in either of the Italian texts. The poem is a translation of the first two stanzas of Metastasio's "Canzonetta V, — La Partenza. Composta dall' autore in Vienna l'anno 1746." Opere , Milan (1815), V,366-67. The text of the Italian is not printed in MP. and is as follows: Ecco quel fiero istante; Nice, mia Nice, addio, Come vivrò, ben mio, Così lontan da te? Io vivrò sempre in pene, Io non avrò più bene; E tu chi sa se mai Ti sovverrai di me! Soffri che in traccia almeno Di mia perduta pace Venga il pensier seguace Su l'orme del tuo piè Sempre nel tuo cammino, Sempre m'avrai vicino; E tu chi sa se mai Ti sovverrai di me! *October 22, MP. Cantata del Metastasio . Alla silva, al prato, al fonte Io n'andrò col gregge amato, E alla silva, al fonte, al prato L'idol mio con me verrà, In quel rozzo augusto tetto, Che ricetto a noi darà, Con la gioia, e col diletto L'innocenza albergherà. Translation from the above . "To the grove, the meadow, the well". Unsigned. Wordsworth's translation is written in the margin of pages 10-11 of Agostino Isola's collection. (All quotations from this manuscript are reproduced from a microfilm and by permission of the Syndics of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.) This translation is printed by the Oxford editors ( WPW. IV,369), though the punctuation of the Italian text is generally followed rather than that of the English version in Wordsworth's hand. The emendation of line 4 is omitted and the MP. publication of the poem is not noted. Line 4 in the MS. reads: "[[My Goddess]] &lt;Laura&gt; will find with me". "My Goddess" only appears in WPW. ; the MP. text reads "Laura". Other MP. variants are: 3 By the Well ] At the well MP. 6 a cover be ] a covert be MP. The cantata is from Metastasio's "Il Re Pastore", I,1. Opere , VII,92. In lines 1 and 3 MP. has "silva", misprinted for "selva". *October 28, C. Anticipation. — A Sonnet. By Wm. Wordsworth, Esq . Wordsworth sent a copy of this sonnet and another to Sir George Beaumont on October 14, 1803 with the note: . . . if you think, either you or Lady Beaumont, that these last two Sonnets are worth publication, would you have the goodness to circulate them in any way you like? ( Early Letters , 342,note). Beaumont replied full of enthusiasm on October 24: I am delighted with your patriotic lines they are animated to a degree &amp; as I have your permission I shall send them to the papers, which I think will be the best mode of making them generally known — (MS in DCP.) Beaumont presumably sent the sonnets to the newspaper, although a slight textual variant casts some doubt on the matter. In Wordsworth's letter, line 12 of "Anticipation" reads: "The loss and [[remembrances]] sore prospect&gt; of the Slain"; in C. the line is : "The loss and e'en the prospect of the slain". Line 13 of this sonnet in the letter has an interesting emendation; Wordsworth deleted "approves" and replaced it by "enjoys". Thus the rhyme scheme is completed but some of the original sense is lost. For C. text of "Anticipation" see WPW. III,122, using the variants for the Poetical Register , 1803 (1805), and, line 9 : "Grandams'". The other sonnet sent to Beaumont, "Vanguard of Liberty", has not so far been discovered in any newspaper. *November 2, MP. Cantata del Metastasio . Rondinello, a cui rapita fu la dolce sua conpagna, vola incerta, va smarrita dalla selva alla campagna, e si lagna intorno al nido dell'infido cacciator; chiare fonti, apriche rive più non cerca, al dì s'invola; sempre sola, e finche vive si rammenta il primo amor. Imitated from the Above . "The Swallow, that hath lost". Unsigned. The manuscript of this poem is in Dorothy's hand on page 26 of Agostino Isola's collection. It is printed WPW. IV,369-70 but two MS variants are not mentioned: line 5 has an illegible crossed out variant for "Nor finds rest"; line 6 "Pastime in heaven" originally read "A home in heaven". The MP. publication is identical with the MS except for punctuation. The newspaper Italian text prints "finche" for "sinchè" in line 9, probably because the Isola volume uses the long printed "s".

The MS on pages 80-81 in Isola is in Wordsworth's hand and is printed WPW. IV,370. There are no MS changes and no textual variants. There are the following misprints in the MP. Italian text: 6 "mait incontri" should read "mai t'incontri"; 7 "Delle" should read "Dille"; 9 "Luscer" should be "Crescer", and "fe" should be "fè". The cantata is from the end of "Amor Timido", Opere , VIII,328-29. *December 12, MP. Cantata del Metastasio . Quanto mai felici siete, Innocenti pastorelle, Che in amor non conoscete Altra legge, che l'amor. Ancor io sarei felice, Se potessi all' idol mio, Palesar come a voi lice, Il desio Di questo cor. Translation from the above . "Oh! bless'd all bliss above". Unsigned. There are two MS versions of this in Agostino Isola, pages 52-53, and both are in Wordsworth's hand. The Oxford editors print the version on page 53, WPW. , IV, 370, and this text is identical with that printed in MP. The text on page 52 is probably an earlier version, and has variants which seem to imply that Wordsworth was not quite certain of the sex of the speaker: Oh bless'd all bliss above Innocent shepherdesses Whom [[in love]] no thing &lt;in law&gt; distresses Who have no law but love. Could I as ye may do To my goddess make part Of the thought of my heart Bless'd were it too, all bliss above. The cantata is from Metastasio, "Ezio", I, 7. Opere , II, 192. Wordsworth later uses a phrase surely recalling this translation; see "A Complaint", line 8: "Bless'd was I then all bliss above!" WPW. II, 34. 1809 November 18, C.

R. MacGillivray who has generously helped my attempts to read and understand many Wordsworth manuscripts; to Dr. D. V. Erdman who allowed me the use of his list of Wordsworth poems in the Courier , checked files of that newspaper not available to me and made most helpful suggestions; to Professor Beatrice Corrigan who discussed with me Wordsworth's Italian translations. 2 The missing copies are for: Feb. 27, March 16, May 19, June 1, August 15, Sept. 12, 13, 14, 1797; Oct. 20, Nov. 7, 23, Dec. 7, 1798. 3 In the same letter Wordsworth goes on to say: "By the bye, I ought to except two sonnets and a light Poem, not connected with my works, which were printed in some Provincial Journal." Presumably the "light Poem" is "Address to the Ocean", published in the Weekly Entertainer , November 21, 1796, discovered by J. R. Mac-Gillivray (see "An Early Poem and Letter by Wordsworth", Review of English Studies , V [1954], 62-66). The two sonnets are not known. 4 See Robert Mayo, "The Contemporaneity of the Lyrical Ballads", PMLA , LXIX [1954], 519. 5 Besides her own name her signatures included: "M.R.", "Tabitha Bramble", "Tabitha", "T.B.", "T.", "Laura Maria", "L.M.", "Sappho", "Bridget", "Oberon", "Julia", "Lesbia". Seven sections from the long blank verse poem, "The Progress of Liberty", appeared anonymously between April 7 and August 2, 1798. Some dozen fictitious letters under the heading, "The Sylphid", (Mrs. Robinson's only known prose contributions) were published between October, 1799 and February, 1800. Mrs. Robinson revised these before her death and they were reprinted with her Memoirs in 1801. 6 Published February 23 and March 22. Mr. D. V. Erdman has discussed these essays in his article: "The Signature of Style", Bulletin of the New York Public Library , LXIII [1959], 104-109. 7 Stuart, in an article superscribed "May 4", but published in the Gentleman's Magazine for June, 1838 (p. 577), entitled "The Newspaper Writings of the Poet Coleridge", made the following statement: "Wordsworth contributed some political sonnets, without pecuniary reward; but he never wrote a line of prose for the Morning Post." Almost certainly this was added by Stuart after he had received Wordsworth's letter of May 17 (see above). 8 From a MS, in the Langlais Collection of the Pierpont Morgan Library and quoted by kind permission of the Trustees. 9 From BM. Add.MS. 35,344 ff.196-97. 10 Southey's newspaper contributions were generally unsigned; "Walter" was used only on Jan. 16, Feb. 12 (incidentally against a poem called "Inscription for a column in Smithfield where Wat Tyler was killed"), Feb. 20, Feb. 22, Feb. 27; in the second half of 1799, on Sept. 13, Oct. 2, 7, Nov. 7, Southey signed himself "Abel Shufflebottom". He had determined on "Walter" as early as July 16, 1797 when he wrote to his brother Tom : "Unluckily, now my name is established, I must have done with it; for to publish whilst studying law would materially injure me. So I assume the name of Walter Tyler, in honour of my good old uncle, an ancestor of whom I am very proud, and with reason." ( Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey , ed. J. W. Warter, I, 39-40.) 11 These men knew either Osorio or The Borderers (often both), and most of them probably knew MP .: Thelwall, Lloyd, Sheridan and Poole had each sent in a contribution in 1798; Wrangham presumably read the newspaper (see entry for March 8, 1798). 12 Perhaps in this signature Coleridge also remembered Sterne's delicious footnote to Book VI, Chapter II of Tristram Shandy , and thus suggested that the poem was originally a piece of juvenilia (presumably Wordsworth's). 13 Some signatures seem to introduce a deliberate note of confusion. "W. L. D.", for instance, habitually associated with Wordsworth's political sonnets of 1803, and interpreted by Hutchinson, "Wordsworth Libertati Dedicavit", appears in The Weekly Entertainer for December 21, 1795, with the one-time Wordsworthian address, "St. John's College", and a very unWordsworthian poem entitled "On Classick Learning". "Mortimer" signed "A Letter on Agriculture" in the Monthly Magazine , October, 1796 (p.691). "M. H.", the signature of the introductory puff to "The Solitude of Binnorie" ( MP. , October 14,1800), had frequently initialled Mary Hay's articles in the Monthly Magazine , 1797; indeed, on one occasion (February), it had appeared beneath a puff introducing five poems by the "late Mr. Brooke". One wonders whether some confusion was intended. It is worth remembering that "W. W." was used other than by Wordsworth and that "Rusticus" did not always mean Poole. 14 The enigmatic "H" proves to be William Jerdan (see, The Autobiography of William Jerdan , (1852) Vol. II, 291-94, where the "Imitation" is reprinted).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Some Observations on the Text of Dubliners : "The Dead" by Robert E. Scholes *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Complaints about the texts of standard editions of James Joyce's works are fairly common, but they are usually directed at Ulysses and Finnegans Wake rather than at Joyce's earlier works. Yet the standard American Editions of Dubliners , from the first edition of B. W. Huebsch to the Modern Library, and the standard English editions, from the first edition of Grant Richards to Jonathan Cape, are among the most unJoycean texts of all Joyce's printed works — for reasons which become apparent when the prepublication printing history of the book is considered. The present study is based primarily on a detailed examination of the manuscript and printing history of "The Dead." This story has been selected because of its length and importance in Dubliners and because the manuscript and printed versions available for its textual study are more complete than those available for the consideration of the other stories in Dubliners . Examinations of the textual histories of other stories in the collection indicate, however, that what is true of "The Dead" is also true of them, and that generalizations made on the basis of a study of "The Dead" will be valid for Dubliners as a whole. The main outlines of the printing history of Dubliners have been recounted by Gorman and Ellmann in their biographies of Joyce and in the bibliography of Slocum and Cahoon. 1 In 1905 Joyce offered a manuscript of twelve stories to Grant Richards. In February 1906 Richards accepted the book for publication, and Joyce sent him a thirteenth story, "Two Gallants." In April the book went to the printer. When the printer objected to certain words and passages in the stories as indecent, a long controversy ensued between Richards and Joyce, with the result that Richards declined to publish the book and returned Joyce's manuscript. Probably the whole book was never set up in type for this impression. Two printed pages of proof survive, in the Houghton Library at Harvard, and they exhibit some peculiarities which make one suspect that no honest attempt to set up the whole edition was ever made. The two pages are from the beginning of "Two Gallants," the story which Joyce added to the collection after the manuscript was in Richards' hands. Joyce's instructions were that this story should be inserted between "After the Race" and "The Boarding House," where it now stands as the sixth story in all modern editions (Letter: Joyce to Richards, 22 Feb. 1906, at Harvard). But the surviving proofs of the story are numbered 12 and 13, indicating that it was certainly not the sixth story printed, and they do not follow consecutively — there is a gap of approximately one page in the text between the first page (numbered 12) and the second (numbered 13). 2 In the margin of p. 13 is the notation "we cannot print this," the printer's initials, and the date — 17 April 1906. Joyce himself commented on the peculiarity of beginning the process of printing his book with the sixth story (Letter: Joyce to Richards, 16 June 1906, at Harvard). Whatever mysterious machinations went on, it is most unlikely that any more than a few pages of proof were ever typeset in this first attempt at Dubliners . By the time Joyce's negotiations with Richards had reached a dead end in October 1906, the manuscript had been expanded to fourteen stories by the inclusion of "A Little Cloud" (Letter: Joyce to Richards, 9 July 1906, at Harvard). In the next year Joyce wrote the final story, "The Dead," 3 but it was not until April 1909 that he succeeded in interesting another publisher in Dubliners . Joseph Hone of Maunsel and Co., Dublin, agreed to look at the manuscript (Letter: Hone to Joyce, 18 April 1909, at Cornell) and in September 1909 Joyce was writing to Richards that Messrs. Maunsel hoped to bring out his book early in the coming Spring (Letter: Joyce to Richards, 4 Sept. 1909, at Cornell). The book was announced by Maunsel for the Spring of 1910 and Joyce received and corrected proofs in June of that year. 4 But even as the proofs were being corrected the now-familiar pattern of attempted censorship began again. Messrs. Maunsel objected to passages in "Ivy Day in the Committee Room"; Joyce did not make the requested changes in proof; and publication of the stories was delayed (Letters: Roberts to Joyce, 7 June 1910 and 9 Feb. 1911, at Cornell). Some time before the final collapse of negotiations on Joyce's visit to Dublin in September 1912, an edition of one thousand copies is believed to have been run off — probably in July of 1912. 5 But when Maunsel finally refused to publish the book and Joyce tried to purchase the sheets from John Falconer, the printer (so that he could publish them himself under the imprint of the Liffey Press), the sheets were reported destroyed by the printer. 6 Joyce always said that his book was "burned" (See Gas From a Burner , for example) but if one thousand copies of the sheets of Dubliners were actually destroyed, the deed was undoubtedly accomplished by the easier and less wasteful process of guillotining. Despite the destruction of the edition, this Dublin setting of Dubliners is of considerable importance to those interested in Joyce's text, for Joyce obtained — "by a ruse," he said 7 — a set of proofs from this edition, which subsequently became the printer's copy for the first published edition of his book. (See Slocum A8 and Joyce's letters to Richards of 24 Jan. and 4 March 1914, at Harvard). Joyce's difficulties in finding a publisher continued until November 1913, when he again approached Grant Richards. Richards accepted the book for the second time late in January of 1914 (Letter: Joyce to Richards 27 Feb. 1914, at Cornell; the contract is at Yale) offering Joyce the same royalty agreement as in 1906; and Joyce accepted the contract (later referred to by J. B. Pinker as a "terrible document," see letter: Pinker to Joyce, 7 May 1915, at Cornell). In April of 1914 Joyce read proof on the Richards edition, (Letter: Joyce to Richards, 8 May 1914, at Harvard) expecting to have a chance to read revised copy before publication. In May he learned that he was not going to have a second chance at the proofs, and he sent Richards a list of corrections to be forwarded to the printer (Letter: Joyce to Richards, 14 May 1914, at Harvard). Most of these corrections have never been made to this date in any edition. (Joyce's list is printed as an appendix to this study.) In June of 1914 Dubliners was finally published. A detailed study of the textual history of "The Dead" must rest on six documents: A. Fragments of a holograph manuscript with printer's notations in the Slocum collection at Yale. B. A complete manuscript — partly typed but completed in the hand of an amanuensis — in the Cornell Collection. C. An almost complete set of galley sheets from the Dublin printing, in the Slocum Collection. D. An almost complete copy of a late stage of the destroyed Dublin edition — sewn but not bound — in the Slocum Collection. E. A complete set of page proofs of the Grant Richards edition, 1914, in the Slocum Collection. F. The first edition itself (copy used for this study is in the Slocum Collection). The interrelationships of these six documents are fairly complex but they can be traced with considerable certainty. Document A bears the notations of the Irish printer and was the copy text for the Maunsel (Dublin) printing. 8 If it were complete there would be no need to consult document B at all. But since A is fragmentary its relationship to B must be established in the hope that B can tell us something reliable about the missing parts of A. Fortunately the relationship is not difficult to work out. B is undoubtedly a faithful (though inexact in a few instances) copy of A. The occasional misreadings of the typist, like " Malius " for " Malins " and " wooed " for " waved " can be directly related to misleading handwriting in the holograph MS. Some of the typist's and amanuensis' mistakes, such as " parent " for " gaunt " and various omissions of letters and words, have been corrected in Joyce's hand to conform (in places where this is verifiable) to the holograph MS. 9 But apparently changes were made in the holograph MS after copy B was taken from it, since various alterations, written in red ink on the holograph, are not reflected in the copy. For example, Joyce changed the name of Gretta Conroy's first love from " Fury " to " Furey " in the extant pages of the holograph, but allowed " Fury " to stand throughout B. We must infer that the red-ink changes post-date the copy and that some of the other changes which were apparently made before the Dublin galleys were printed would probably show up as redink changes if the missing pages of the holograph could be located. Thus Joyce undoubtedly corrected the words of the song, "The Lass of Aughrim," in this manner, after learning the true version from Nora Barnacle's mother, who sang it to him on his trip to Galway in August, 1909 (Letters: James to Nora Joyce, 26 and 31 Aug. 1909, at Cornell). The corrected holograph manuscript, document A, became the printer's text for the Dublin (Maunsel) edition (see fn. 8 above). The relationships among the various texts can be illustrated most clearly by tracing one passage through all its stages. This passage (pp. 255, 256 of the Modern Library Edition; p. 227 of Jonathan Cape, 1954) is unfortunately among the missing parts of document A, but it was corrected by Joyce in document B, 10 and apparently no red-ink changes were made in A after B was copied. The passages are designated here by lower-case letters corresponding to the upper-case designations (above) of the documents from which they are taken. The variants among these will be discussed later. b-1 (MS in hand of amanuensis, corrected by Joyce, pp. 20-21) Nobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back to the legitimate opera. One of her pupils had given her a pass for Mignon . Of course, it was very fine, she said, but it made her think of poor Georgina Burns. Mr Browne could go back farther still to the old Italian companies that used to come to Dublin, Tietjens, Trebelli Ilma de Murzka, Campanini, the great Giuglini, Revelli, Aramburo. Those were the days, he said, when there was something like singing to be heard in Dublin. He told too of how the top gallery of the Old Royal used to be packed night after night, of how one night an Italian tenor had sung five encores to Let me like a soldier fall , introducing a high C every time, and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her themselves through the streets to the hotel. Why did they never play the grand old operas now, he asked, Norma, Lucrezia Borgia ? Because they could not get the voices to sing them: that was why. —O, well, said Mr Bartell D'Arcy, I presume there are as good singers to day as there were then— —Where are they? asked Mr Browne defiantly— —In London, Paris, Berlin, said Mr Bartell D'Arcy warmly.

One of her pupils had given her a pass for Mignon . Of course it was very fine, she said, but it made her think of poor Georgina Burns. Mr Browne could go back farther still, to the old Italian companies that used to come to Dublin—Tietjens, Ilma de Murzka, Campanini, the great Trebelli Giuglini, Ravelli, Aramburo. Those were the days, he said, when there was something like singing to be heard in Dublin. He told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be packed night after night, of how one night an Italian tenor had sung five encores to Let me like a Soldier fall , introducing a high C every time, and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her themselves through the streets to her hotel.

'O, well,' said Mr Bartell D'Arcy, 'I presume there are as good singers to-day as there were then.' 'Where are they?' asked Mr Browne defiantly. 'In London, Paris, Milan,' said Mr Bartell D'Arcy warmly. 'I suppose Caruso, for example, is quite as good, if not better than any of the men you have mentioned.' Some of the differences between b-1 and c-1 are of indeterminable significance. The change from "the hotel" to "her hotel," for example, may be due to a mistake made in the preparation of B, a red-ink change in A, or a compositor's change in the preparation of C. But other differences allow us to make inferences with almost absolute certainty. The various changes in the spelling of proper names are undoubtedly due to the compositor's inability to read Joyce's holograph accurately in those instances where he could not guess at the correct spelling on the basis of his own knowledge. We have seen how the typist of document B had trouble with the proper name "Malins," reading a u for the n . The compositor of C had the same trouble here (and also earlier when he misread the Irish phrase " Beannacht libh " as " Beaunacht libh "—as it appears in galley 7). In this case he has read "Tietjeus" for "Tietjens", "Trebell's" for "Trebelli", and "Gingliui" for "Giuglini". Passage d-1, from the final Maunsel printing includes the correction of all these misspellings and some other changes of the sort which would have been made only by Joyce. "Berlin" in b and c (and presumably in the missing part of a) becomes "Vienna" in d, and "Old Royal" becomes "old Royal". Texts C and D are impressed from the same setting of type, 11 though C is in the form of unpaged slip galleys and D is in the form of numbered pages, apparently in the last stage of preparation before sewing and binding. 12 We cannot now tell how many states of this impression existed between the galleys and the final printing, but numerous corrections were made and incorporated into state D. In "The Dead" alone three hundred commas were removed between C and D; over thirty hyphens were removed, the hyphenated constructions being modified to either one or two words; and a substantial number of textual changes were made. (The most important of these will be considered below.) When the Dublin impression of Dubliners was destroyed by Manusel's printer, Joyce, as we know, obtained a set of proofs which became the copy-text for Grant Richards' printer. The normal assumption would be that Joyce would take the last and most correct text, in this case text D. But this was not a normal situation. The text he was able to get, he got "by a ruse"; and it was certainly not text D. A glance at passages c-1, d-1, and e-1 will show that e contains the same absurd mis-spellings which we found in c, and that the third on the list of operatic cities is once again Berlin. This can mean only that the printer's copy for E must have been much closer to C than to D. There are several reasons why we must be satisfied with saying that the printer's text in this case is close to C rather than simply inferring that C was the copy-text. Joyce and Richards in their correspondence unmistakably refer to pages rather than galley sheets; 13 and a few parts of E seem closer to D than to C (as when Mr. Browne's skin, "dark yellow" in galley 3 of C, becomes "swarthy" on p. 268 of D and remains so on p. 225 of E). In these cases we cannot be sure whether the corrections to C have been incorporated in some other set of page-proofs—a hypothetical, partially corrected C1—or whether Joyce has introduced corrections by hand in a set essentially the same as C but in pages rather than galleys. We can note, however, that wherever substantive changes occur between C and E, they are marked by a culling out of commas in the surrounding passages; and wherever D indicates that corrections should have been made in C which were not, in fact, made before E was printed, the surrounding area remains heavily punctuated in E (as in C), and the commas are finally culled out in the First Edition itself, state F. The whole problem of punctuation in the text of Dubliners is an important and interesting one. This problem can be divided into two main aspects—the punctuation of direct discourse and the use of the comma. Joyce was habitually a light punctuator. The textual history of Dubliners indicates that he was twice forced to go through his text, once in the Irish printing and again in the English, removing what he considered an excess of editorial or compositorial punctuation, culling out more than three hundred commas from "The Dead" between C and D, and over two hundred and twenty-five between E and F, after having eliminated more than fifty between C and E. He preferred not to use a comma before the conjunctions and, but , and for . This practice has occasionally resulted in confusion. Compare, for example, the following sentences from the six texts: a-2 (p. 18) Probably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had been taught for one year his mother had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat. . . . b-2 (p. 10) same as a-2 c-2 (galley 4) Probably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had been taught for one year; his mother had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat. . . . d-2 (p. 273) same as a-2 and b-2 e-2 (p. 230) same as c-2 f-2 (p. 230) Probably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had been taught for one year. His mother had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat. . . . Here, Joyce in his manuscript avoided using the standard comma before the phrase "for one year" which would have made it clear that "for" in that case was a conjunction and not a preposition. An officious compositor in setting text C changed Joyce's sentence, wrongly breaking it after "for one year" instead of before it. Joyce corrected this change so that D reads as A and B do in this passage, but E naturally follows C. Finally the reading was emended even further in the wrong direction in F (by a compositor or editor) and so it stands in our modern editions —Modern Library, p. 238; Jonathan Cape 1954, p. 212. This is one of the corrections Joyce sent Richards in lieu of a second proof-reading, apparently having missed it—as he missed many others in his haste—on the first reading. (See Appendix.) Joyce's views on the subject of the punctuation of direct discourse were even less orthodox than his views on the comma. He strongly objected to the use of the inverted comma or quotation marks, and expressed these views to Grant Richards in February 1906 and again in March of 1914. As Joyce's views on the subject are very strong, and since the published volume of his letters prints this passage in a somewhat garbled form, the passage is reprinted here in the notes. 14 In the Irish printing of Dubliners Joyce nearly succeeded in having his usage in the matter of quotations followed accurately. Passage b-1 above illustrates Joyce's habitual method of punctuating quotations in the Dubliners manuscripts. A dash introduces every paragraph which is either in part or wholly direct discourse, and another dash concludes each such paragraph. (In his later works he dropped the concluding dash.) But c-1 (above) shows that the Irish compositors did not follow Joyce entirely. They used the dash as if it were a quotation mark, trying to surround every directly quoted speech with dashes which exclude the narrator's statements: "—O, well,—said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, —I presume . . ." etc. This peculiar blend of Joycean and normal usage is not a strictly Irish development. One finds, for example, both techniques combined rather confusingly in the fifth chapter of the Modern Library edition of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . At any rate, the heavy use of dashes in C remains unchanged in the final Irish text D. Either Joyce was satisfied or the compositor stood firm. Grant Richards, however, insisted on normal English usage; thus in text E the dashes are replaced by inverted commas. We can even note in e-1 (above) how, at the end of the long first paragraph, the English compositor clumsily converted indirect into direct discourse through mistaking the dash used as colon in c-1 for a dash introducing a quotation. This stands as direct discourse in the modern English text (Cape, 1954) even though the use of the conditional past tense is clearly an indirect mode of rendering what would be present tense in direct discourse; but the modern American text (Modern Library) even more confusingly closes with quotation marks which have no mate opening the quotation anywhere in the paragraph. The main point of all this interest in the method of presenting direct discourse is that no edition of Dubliners has ever been printed which follows the usage desired by Joyce, though he was able to enforce his views on these matters in the books which followed Dubliners . Passage f-1 (above) indicates the way in which Joyce corrected text E and also it reveals that his correction was not perfect. He rearranged the operatic passage and corrected the spelling; Berlin he again replaced, this time by Milan instead of Vienna as in d-1; and for Norma he substituted the more recondite Dinorah ; but he missed the erratic capitalization of Let me like a Soldier fall and the introduction of the awkward direct discourse at the end of the first paragraph. That he did not pick up all the mistakes is not surprising. He had promised Grant Richards to return corrected proof two days after receipt (Joyce was still in Trieste at the time) and he expected to have a chance to correct revised copy. (Letters: Joyce to Richards, 8 and 14 May 1914, at Harvard). Also, by this time he had corrected Dubliners countless times and the human law of diminishing returns had undoubtedly begun to affect him. The more one reads over the same work, the less one sees of what is actually on the page. And, finally, he must have been mainly preoccupied with his new work, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , which he was engaged in completing for the Egoist , the London periodical which had started publishing the novel in February 1914 (see Ellmann, p. 364). All these factors combined, readily account for the lack of thoroughness of Joyce's corrections of text E for the Grant Richards First Edition of Dubliners in 1914. Now we may turn to ten of the improvements which Joyce had made in the Irish text of "The Dead" between C and D which he never reintroduced in the English edition, and which consequently have been omitted in all modern printings of the book. These improvements were made only in proof; and, therefore, when Joyce was unable to obtain a late state of the Irish printing he had no record of these changes. In all cases cited below, Text F substantially follows C and E, the modifications made in D having been lost when C1 became printer's text for E. Change 1: Text F. 'Well, I'm ashamed of you,' said Miss Ivors frankly. 'To say you'd write for a paper like that . . .' Text D. "paper" changed to "rag" (CF. Modern Library p. 240; Jonathan Cape, 1954, p. 214) Change 2: Text F. 'The fact is,' said Gabriel, 'I have just arranged to go—' Text D. "just" changed to "already" (ML 242/JC 215) Note that changes 1 and 2 serve to make Miss Ivors a bit more outspoken in her attack and to make Gabriel's refusal of her request that he join in a trip to the west of Ireland seem a bit less impromptu. Change 3: Text F. '. . . What row had you with Molly Ivors?' 'No row. Why? Did she say so?' 'Something like that. . . .' 'There was no row,' said Gabriel moodily. . . . Text D. "row" changed to "words" in all instances and "was" changed to "were" (ML 245/JC 217-218) Change 4: Text F. Her son-in-law was a splendid fisher. One day he caught a beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner. Text D. Her son-in-law was a splendid fisher. One day he caught a fish, a beautiful big big fish: and the man in the hotel boiled it for their dinner. (ML 245/JC 218) In change 4 Mrs. Malin's personality is rendered more vividly; the mode of preparation of the fish made more specific. Change 5: Text F. 'And do you mean to say,' asked Mr Browne incredulously, 'that a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything?' Text D. —And do you mean to say,—asked Mr Browne incredulously, —that a fellow can go down there and put up there as it if were a hotel and then come away without paying a farthing?—(ML 258/JC 229) In Change 5, Text D, "anything" becomes "farthing". But note that "chap" in text F is not a relapse after a change to "fellow" in D, but a new change introduced between E and F, probably for the same reason that "farthing" was introduced between C and D—to make Browne's speech more concrete and Browne, therefore, more vivid. Change 6: Text F. The table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion. Text D. "allusion" changed to "sally" (ML 262/JC 233) Change 7: Text F. 'Someone is fooling at the piano, anyhow,' said Gabriel. Text D. "fooling" changed to "strumming" (ML 266/JC 236) Both 6 and 7 seem to be attempts to find words more in keeping with the mood or tone of the passages they are in. Change 8: Text F. 'Yes, sir,' said the cabman. 'Make like a bird for Trinity College.' 'Right, sir,' said the cabman. Text D. In the cabman's second speech "said" is changed to "cried". (ML 269/JC 239) Another change in the interest of vividness, "cried" expresses the cabman's relief at finally getting a direction he understands. Change 9: Text F. A ghastly light from the streetlamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door. Text D. "ghastly" changed to "ghostly" (ML 278/JC 247) This is a most important correction. Text B reads "ghostly", C "ghastly", probably due to a misreading of A by the compositor of C. Joyce made the correction in D but did not pick it up again in his proof-reading of E. The slightly eerie connotations of "ghostly" with its suggestion of Ibsen's play Ghosts (a spiritual ancestor of Joyce's story) are much more appropriate for this scene than the more horrible connotations of "ghastly". Change 10: Text F. '. . . He gave me back that sovereign I lent him and I didn't expect it really. It's a pity he wouldn't keep away from that Browne because he's not a bad fellow really.' Text D. the second "really" changed to "at heart" (ML 279/JC 248) These ten changes represent only the obvious substantive changes made in the text of "The Dead" by Joyce and subsequently lost. Texts D and F also vary through compositorial errors introduced in E which passed unnoticed into F and thence into modern texts. The simply ungrammatical "The peals of laughter which followed Gabriel's imitation of the incident was interrupted. . . ." (ML 268/JC 238, my italics ) is just an error—B, C, and D all reading "were". And there are other similar problems. A study I have now in progress of the other stories in Dubliners indicates that many other substantive changes have been lost from the text. But a textual study of "The Dead" alone is enough to establish the fact that we are reading one of our most precise and careful writers in editions which can be greatly improved, which can be made both more correct and more Joycean.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix When Joyce learned that he was not going to have a second opportunity to read proof on the first edition of Dubliners , he prepared the following list of corrections and sent them to Grant Richards for action. Unfortunately, the corrections were not made. Some of the more obvious errors in punctuation and grammar have been detected and eliminated in later editions, but over twenty of these corrections have never been made in a printed text of Dubliners . In addition to matters of correctness, matters of tone and pace are attended to in this list. The most important correction noted here is undoubtedly that for p. 265, which transfers back to Gretta Conroy a speech mistakenly given to her husband by the compositor of the Grant Richards edition. This list of unmade corrections plus the as yet untotaled number of lost improvements (such as those for "The Dead" discussed above) should certainly be taken into account when a new edition of Dubliners is prepared. The list which follows is exactly as Joyce made it, with page and line references to the First Edition. Page and line references to current American and English editions have been added in parentheses after Joyce's corrections, ML referring to Modern Library, JC to Jonathan Cape, 1954. Whenever the correction has been made in the modern editions, this fact is noted in the parenthesis. DUBLINERS Misprints page 11: line 26: for imbecile!' read imbecile!

      <field name="fulltext">Notes * I wish to express my gratitude to the Houghton Library of Harvard University and the Cornell University Library for allowing me to make use of their important unpublished Joyce materials in preparing this study, and especially to the Yale University Library for giving me complete freedom to quote from the invaluable manuscripts and proofs of Dubliners at Yale. I am also grateful to the Committee on Research Grants of the University of Virginia and the Richmond Area Fund for financial assistance with this project. 1 Herbert Gorman, James Joyce (London, 1949), pp. 145-158, 169-176, 195, 211-217, 219-221; Richard Ellmann, James Joyce (1959), see index; Slocum and Cahoon, A Bibliography of James Joyce (1953), A8. 2 Slocum and Cahoon (A8) suggest that the story was "expanded" in the 1914 edition, but it seems more likely that it was abbreviated by the printer in 1906. The two pages do not blend coherently; the speakers' roles become interchanged in the second page of this 1906 page-proof, indicating omission of a page. In all other respects the text is substantially that of the later editions. 3 See Ellmann, Ch. 15, for the genesis and background of this story. 4 The galley-proofs of "The Dead" (at Yale) are dated by the printer "June 19/ 10". Roberts' letters to Joyce of 30 April and 7 June 1910 (at Cornell) indicate that the first set of proofs was mailed to Joyce on 7 June. See also Slocum A8. 5 Slocum and Cahoon find no reason to doubt that 1000 copies were actually printed and they are probably correct. In a letter of 9 Aug. 1912 (at Cornell) Roberts suggested that Joyce try to get Grant Richards to take over the sheets printed by Falconer of Dublin. 6 The end of Dubliners is told simply and graphically by Charles Joyce in a letter to Stanislaus Joyce, 11 Sept. 1912 (at Cornell). Less than a week before, his letter of 6 Sept. had been full of hope for the prospects of Dubliners being published by himself and his brother as the Liffey Press. 7 Letter: James to Stanislaus Joyce, 2 Sept. 1912 (at Cornell). I have speculated on the nature of the ruse in the forthcoming Joyce Miscellany No. 3, in an essay on Joyce's broadsides. 8 Since "The Dead" had not been written when Richards first had Dubliners partially printed in 1906, and since the 1914 edition was set from proofs rather than MSS, the only printer who could have made notations on the Yale MS of "The Dead" is the Irish printer. 9 See Cornell MS (typed and hand written by amanuensis), pp. 2, 9; Yale MS pp. 3, 16. Corrections in Joyce's hand in the Cornell TS-MS are on pp. 1, 20, 21, 35, 38, 39, 42, 44, 45, 48, 49, 55, and 56. 10 The passage contains a word missed by the amanuensis in copying (apparently) and supplied by Joyce—p. 21. 11 The two impressions have been compared on the Hinman collating machine at the University of Virginia.. 12 The pages have neat, uniform margins; the leaves have been hand sewn. This text is probably the only survivor of the 1000-copy Irish edition. 13 Richards in his letter of 23 March 1914 (at Cornell) informed Joyce that pages 3-4 and 13-14 of "The Sisters" had been lost and Joyce in his letter of 26 March (at Harvard) replied that he was supplying typed copies of the missing pages. In the same letter Joyce asked Richards to return the title page of the Dublin edition. 14 Letter: Joyce to Richards, 4 March 1914, at Harvard. "As regards the inverted commas the Irish compositors are not to blame. I myself insisted on their abolition: to me they are an eyesore. I think the page reads much better with the dialogue between dashes. But if you are persuaded of the contrary I agree to waive the point and let the inverted commas replace the dashes. But I think you ought not to reject my suggestion at once. I think the commas used in English dialogue are most unsightly and give an impression of unreality."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The English Editions of James Gould Cozzens by James B. Meriwether *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That the twentieth-century American novel presents a very fruitful field for research in textual bibliography has been amply demonstrated in recent studies by Bowers, Harkness, and Bruccoli. 1 They have shown that the greatest care must be used in selecting the text to be quoted, of Lewis, Cabell, Fitzgerald, and others, because of the extent to which both errors and revisions may be present in different domestic editions, and even, through plate changes, in different impressions of the same edition. However, I am not aware of any studies yet made which indicate that English editions of contemporary American novelists should be taken into consideration when deciding upon the best available text. (On the other hand, many examples have been supplied which point out the dangers of using the American editions of English writers.) Yet a relatively brief examination of the English editions of James Gould Cozzens provides evidence that unless his case is unique, a new caveat may have to be added to the existing list of warnings about texts for the editor, bibliographer, and careful critic of that part of twentieth-century American fiction which also saw publication in England. Ten of James Gould Cozzens' twelve novels have been published in England. 2 (The exceptions are two early ones, Confusion and Cock Pit .) American scholars, collectors, and libraries have joined in ignoring the English versions, and no library or private collection known to me on this side of the Atlantic has anything like a complete set of the ten. 3 They are seldom listed in the catalogues of the English dealers, even those who specialize in modern fiction, and though six of them are currently available in reprints (five in a "Uniform Edition"), the other four are difficult to obtain. Yet the importance of the English versions is attested in the strongest terms by Cozzens himself in a recent letter in which he stated that "All the English editions have a certain number of changes. They were always published later and in English proof I had a chance to change things I'd come to wish I'd changed in the American proof, so in general the English text if [ sic ] the one I prefer." 4 The full collation of the two texts of one novel, S. S. San Pedro , and spot-checking of sample passages in two others, Castaway and Michael Scarlett , confirm the importance Cozzens ascribes to the English versions, though it is obvious even from these few examples that he was right to qualify his statement that the English text was to be preferred, and that in some cases at least the situation is a more complicated one than that a later publication date permitted afterthoughts which could be embodied in changes in the proofs. The simplest and most clear-cut of the cases examined may be cited first. A spot check of a number of passages in the two versions of Michael Scarlett , an Elizabethan romance which was Cozzens' second published book, reveals many minor changes, mostly stylistic, and in most cases obviously authorial rather than editorial in origin. One example will suffice. In Chapter VIII Southampton has occasion to mention the publication of a play by Shakespeare. In the American text he refers to it as a "new comedy, called a 'Winter's Tale,' which, I do confess, doth clearly take the argument from Mr. Greene's 'Pandosto' . . . ." The English text is revised: "new comedy, not produced yet, nor is it like to be soon now. It doth clearly take the argument from Mr. Greene's 'Pandosto' . . . ." 5 Acknowledging the changes as his, Cozzens (in the letter cited earlier) recalled, more than thirty years after making them, that he could "still remember one change I made in a hurry. It was pointed out to me that in . . . [the American text] Shakespeare was caused to praise highly some verses of which I was the actual author. Pretty thick, I had to admit." The English version of Michael Scarlett was published in 1927, two years after the American, and neither has ever been reprinted. There can be no doubt, then, that in this case the English text has been revised from the American, and is to be preferred, as Cozzens has stated, where it differs. But what of Castaway , which was published in England about six weeks earlier than in America? This short novel presents the last days of a lone man, Mr. Lecky, who is trapped in an immense department store. The question of why he is alone in the store, and what has happened to the world outside, is never explained, and the book is a thoroughgoing tour-de-force , an ironic allegory of a present-day Robinson Crusoe in reverse, who perishes amid plenty because of his lack of inner resources. At least a partial explanation of his plight, however, occurs as an introductory note to the English edition. Opposite the first page of the text itself this information is supplied: Alone in a vast Department Store, the sole survivor of a catastrophe that has destroyed New York, Mr. Lecky finds himself a commonplace little Robinson Crusoe, cut off from his kind amidst the fantastic plenty of the twentieth century. There is everything to sustain life in abundance, and nothing to fear — except . . . . . The position of this note, outside the text itself, might lead the reader to suspect its authority. It sounds like dust-jacket copy. And in the American edition there is no such note, and no reference in the text itself to Mr. Lecky's city being New York, nor to a disaster having overtaken it. But the last chapter of the English edition contains a paragraph that is lacking in the American, and which supplies confirmation for the introductory note. The paragraph reads in part: Coming to consciousness he was afflicted by an immense, intolerable misery of pain and sickness . . . . there was a gloom of day, sullen, without sun. His distress hardly let him think, but such dreariness might mean rain outdoors. Rain in its desolation would be pouring down all over the city, augmenting the catastrophe. That catastrophe it was, Mr. Lecky had never doubted, though he had wondered so little . . . . He might suppose he had lived like those fish he had tried to feed . . . , a little longer than the world. 6 If we accept Cozzens' statement, quoted above, that the English editions were all revised in proof and represented the later and preferred state of the text, we would have to assume, in the case of Castaway , a decision on his part to clear up some of the mystery that surrounds Mr. Lecky's circumstances. The six weeks' earlier publication date of the English edition is not an insuperable objection, for delays in publication schedules might quite easily result in the prior publication of an edition which had actually been later set in type. Neither the English nor the American edition went into a second impression, so far as I am able to tell, and though the 1956 Modern Library Paperback edition follows the American text, not the English, it might well have happened that either the author had by that time forgotten changes he had made in the text, or that he had no opportunity to make such changes in this new American edition. If some future editor of a scholarly edition of the novels of James Gould Cozzens had only this much evidence to go on, he could hardly avoid including in a definitive, eclectic text the additional paragraph in the final chapter of the English edition, and he might well include the prefatory note. And yet in Castaway the American edition actually presents the later, revised text, and the English is the earlier version. Concerning the prefatory note, Cozzens has stated (in the letter cited above) that it is not his; the English editor of the book "seemed to feel something of the kind was necessary. I didn't; it wasn't the kind of book you could 'explain'. Those who could take it wouldn't need any explanation; those who couldn't weren't likely to be helped; but I told him to go ahead if he wanted to." The editor went ahead, basing his note on the passage in the final chapter which is absent from the American edition. This absence is explained not by the fact that it was an addition to the English proofs, but a subtraction from the text of the Random House edition. In a letter to his English editor in 1934, before publication of either edition, Cozzens gave his consent to the publication of the prefatory note, but added that "In the copy for Random House I'm striking out the sentences from the last chapter which give the hint you mention, for reflection convinced me that it was then late in the day to attempt an explanation, especially one so vague and half-hearted; but that refers only to the text itself." 7 The conclusions to be drawn from the differences between the English and American texts of Michael Scarlett and Castaway are necessarily tentative, as they are based only upon the comparison of random passages. Nevertheless, it is obvious that very interesting results can be obtained by such random sampling. As an example of what further results can be obtained by a full collation, the texts of the first English and American editions of Cozzens' short novel S. S. San Pedro were compared throughout. The English edition, which was published two weeks after the American, showed what could be considered a normal number of the minor textual variations we expect to encounter in any English settng of an American text: thirteen differences in hyphenation (most of them hyphens added to American compounds), twenty-eight differences in punctuation, and twenty-eight in spelling. The punctuation variants are mostly inconsequential; either reading is acceptable. Two-thirds of the spelling variants are Anglicizations (clamour, endeavoured), the others attributable to differences in styling and usage that may depend upon publisher rather than country, or may simply reflect underlying characteristics of the copy. 8 There are two differences in paragraphing. And inevitably, the close reading of the text required by the collation turned up printer's errors in both editions, four in the American and seventeen in the English; each time the error was minor, and the reading was correct in the other edition. 9 In four categories, then — spelling, punctuation, hyphenation, and paragraphing — there are obvious but unimportant variations in the two texts. But a fifth category demands our attention, for in the American edition there are nineteen cases of clear-cut authorial revision. Some of the differences noted above in punctuation, spelling, even in hyphenation, may represent the author's work, of course, but they are indistinguishable from such changes commonly made by printers (either accidentally or intentionally) and by editors and proofreaders. And the two changes in paragraphing presumably were made by Cozzens. But the list below includes all variations in the text which were noted that can with reasonable certainty be attributed to the author and to no one else. Revisions in the American Text of S.S.

Believe When examined in context, most of these revisions are quite clearly improvements in the American over the English edition. Six of them, for example (3, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15), concern the wireless operator Morris, and in every case something has been added to what is the English text in order to emphasize his sardonic, mocking character and distinguish it more sharply from that of Smith, the other operator. It would be conceivable, of course, but unreasonable, to assume that the English text represented the revised version, and that Cozzens had gone through the book removing most of the touches that individualize Morris. But all except two of the other changes argue the same conclusion as do the six that concern Morris. Three of them (17, 18, 19) occur in MacGillivray's final outburst against the stupidity of Bradell and the captain, and together they increase the power of his words to convey his anger convincingly and easily. (Number 17, for instance, replaces what is an effective line, but one which slows the reader down and makes him grope momentarily for the syntax.) Three others are of only one word each but are unmistakably improvements in the American edition: number 7 eliminates a redundant adverb, 11 replaces a landsman's term in a sailor's mouth with a nautical one, and 12 avoids, in good Cozzens fashion, the incorrect assumption that might be made from the inexact expression "this time" by replacing it with "now". Number 16 expands a passage in the English version; again, it could be argued that the author, in this terse and tightly constructed narrative, had cut the passage in the English text, instead, but the expanded version accomplishes so much more effectively the transition from the open-air chaos of the deck to the nightmare situation in the engineroom that the idea is a difficult one to entertain. Finally, two changes (4, 5), though neither adding to nor subtracting from the sense of the passages in which they appear, contribute noticeably to their verbal felicity. In sum, these fifteen of the nineteen changes constitute an overwhelmingly convincing argument that neither the later date of publication nor Cozzens' general statement about the presence of revisions in the English editions can be taken, in the case of S. S. San Pedro , as an indication that the differences in the two texts arise from revisions in the English version. But such evidence, no matter how subjectively convincing on critical grounds, is no proof, and at this point it is useful to bring into consideration the supporting evidence of another text of the book. The first printing of this narrative was in the August 1930 issue of Scribner's Magazine , in which it was featured as the first entry to be published in a contest for short novels. Collation of spot passages reveals many instances where the text underwent minor revision for the book publication a year later in America and England, 10 but in only two instances does the magazine version differ from the book version where the two editions of the book differ from each other. In every one of the fifteen cases just discussed of revision between the two editions of the book, the Scribner's text is identical with the English version. In short, the supporting evidence of the magazine text makes it clear that for these fifteen passages we must assume a process whereby the original version in Scribner's was followed for the English book publication, and the American book was revised from them. Two other changes (6, 8) between the English and American editions clarify still further the process of the transmission of the text. In these two changes we have a difference not only between the two book versions, but also between both of them and the magazine text. In the Scribner's version of the watch officer's announcement to his relief of the ship's course (6), he gives a different course from that in the two book versions: "'south twenty-two degrees west,' he said formally." Though the course differs from that in both editions of the book, the form of the sentence in which it is given is the same for the magazine version and the English edition, but different for the American. The other case (8) of differences among all three versions also involves a progressive revision that obviously began with the magazine text, continued in the English, and ended with the American. Here the cutting from the American text of three sentences in the English follows a process begun in the English, which cut several sentences or parts of sentences from the passage in Scribner's . 11 So far, examination of seventeen of the nineteen revisions in the text of the English and American editions of S. S. San Pedro shows conclusively that the American text is the later, revised one. Unfortunately, the picture is somewhat clouded by the other two revisions. Both of them (1, 2) are minor; both of them appear to be better in the English than in the American version; both of them are identical in the Scribner's and the American edition. The relatively close publication date of the two book versions presumably accounts for this unexpected complication. At some point in the process of correcting proofs, Cozzens may have neglected to incorporate in the American text these two changes which he had already made in the English. Or the revision may have been made in a typescript, or a paste-up from the Scribner's publication, prepared for the English publisher, and not carried over into the copy prepared for the American. There are several possibilities which might account for the discrepancy; the important point is that although the American text in general represents the revised and final version, the English edition incorporated two changes which appear to be authorial revisions, and which would certainly demand editorial consideration in a carefully prepared edition of Cozzens' novels. Although the evidence given here from these three novels, Michael Scarlett, Castaway , and S. S. San Pedro , represents only a random sampling, it is clear that for James Gould Cozzens the English editions are far more important than the present lack of interest in them in this country would indicate. It is evident, too, that in order to resolve some of the problems which this English text presents, it is necessary to draw upon the memories and correspondence of the author. The final solution of such textual (or editorial) problems often requires all possible information from the correspondence, records, and memories of author, agent, and publisher. It may well be that few modern American novelists have taken an interest such as Cozzens' in the English publication of their books, but it is obvious that the question must be raised before any sort of final decision can be made about selecting the best possible text. In turn, it is also obvious that our major research libraries have the obligation of providing the facilities for answering that question, when it is asked, at least about our more important novelists. And if our libraries need to give more attention to the problem of building up complete sets of the English editions of American authors, our critics need to be on the alert for such textual differences as this article has pointed out. It will be a long time before adequate bibliographies for even our major novelists will be compiled, but in the meantime, it is often easy to turn up evidence that some important textual problem needs investigation. Not only is there an opportunity during the lifetime of an author to answer certain kinds of textual questions which cannot later be settled with the same finality, and not only are publishers' and agents' records often dispersed and destroyed with the passage of time, but also authors' memories and publishers' records need to be supplemented by the memories of officials and workmen of publishing and printing companies. In the case of English editions, this last factor is of particular importance today, because of the loss of so many publishers' records during the blitz of World War II. As memories fade, so will our opportunities for solving these textual problems.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Publication Dates of the Novels For the purpose of establishing the relationship of two editions of a book, their respective publication dates constitute evidence of only limited usefulness, and the closer the dates are, the less useful is the evidence. What is really needed are the dates when copy was first received by the publisher, when it was sent to the printer, when galley and page proofs were pulled, when the sheets were printed, and when finished books were delivered by the binder. But such information is generally very difficult to obtain, and in its absence, publication dates must be used as a rough indication of a possible priority. The dates given in the list below have been supplied by the individual publishers concerned, with the exception of Michael Scarlett , where the source was the published records of the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress and the 1927 volume of the English Catalogue of Books , respectively. Since the two versions of this novel appeared two calendar years apart, the date of publication within the year is unimportant for establishing precedence, but it should be pointed out that the records of the Copyright Office are often unreliable for publication dates. These dates, as recorded in the Copyright Office, are in effect the publishers' predicted date of publication, generally at the time when an advance copy was ready for deposit, and such a date may be changed more than once as a result of difficulties of production, unexpected pre-publication demand, or other causes. Again with the exception of Michael Scarlett , all the American publication dates have been checked with the generally reliable advertised dates in the Publisher's Weekly . [ Confusion .

Not all the English versions represent separate editions; at least one ( The Son of Perdition ) is merely a different issue, from imported sheets. 3 The largest available collection is that in the Rare Books Division of the Princeton University Library, which has six of the ten, although not all are first impressions. 4 James Gould Cozzens to James B. Meriwether, 10 September 1958. This letter is now in the Cozzens Collection at Princeton. I am grateful to Mr. Cozzens for permitting quotation in this article from unpublished letters, and from Michael Scarlett , the copyright of which has reverted to the author. 5 P. 176, both versions. 6 Pp. 174-175 of the English edition. Cf. p. 175, second paragraph, of the American edition. 7 James Gould Cozzens to Milton Waldman, 17 July 1934. Quoted from the carbon in the files of Cozzens' correspondence in the Princeton University Library. Although these files are not at the present time open for inspection, Mr. Cozzens very kindly permitted reference to this letter in order to settle the problem of this passage in Castaway . 8 Examples are the variation S.O.S. in the English edition from SOS in the American, and the several cases of double or single l's: shovelling, panelled, stencilled, pencilled, in the English edition; shoveling, paneled, and so on, in the American. That Anglicization cannot be blamed for them all is indicated by a comparison with the first published text of the novel, in Scribner's Magazine, LXXXVIII (August 1930), where the readings, in the case of the S.O.S. and the double l's, are the same as those of the English edition, although the magazine is American. 9 The American misprints may be worth noting here: P. 17, line 9, semicolon should be omitted or replaced by comma; 43.22, quotation marks lacking; 64.18, pork for port; 132.7, period should be comma. 10 Two examples, more significant than most, occur at the end of Chapter One, where the deathly figure of Doctor Percival warns Anthony Bradell, the second officer, that the captain is in ill health, and then goes ashore. In the Scribner's version, the description of Doctor Percival's departure is a brief one: "He turned simply and walked away. Anthony had one glimpse of his black figure moving slowly on the gangplank." In the book version (p. 25, American edition) the description is expanded, emphasizing Doctor Percival's portentous appearance: "He had not halted a moment while he was speaking. Now his unhurried progress simply bore him on, leaving Anthony behind. The sun, slanting almost perpendicular between the edge of the wharf roof and the San Pedro's side, lay hot on the slope of the gangplank. Doctor Percival's black figure moved there, passed on; was lost in deep shadows ashore." The expanded version is considerably the more effective. However, four paragraphs earlier (p. 25, American edition) the book version omits several sentences spoken by Doctor Percival to Bradell concerning the captain: "'No, I do not mean to say he is incapacitated, or even, at the moment, dangerously ill. I am, no doubt, nearer death than he is.' He paused a moment and breathed heavily. 'It is usual for me to be,' he added. 'Clendening has always been a strong man—'" The omission of these five sentences from the book version serves the same function as do the additions to the description of Doctor Percival's departure, increasing the atmosphere of mystery. Cozzens apparently felt, on further consideration, that he was making Doctor Percival a little too obvious a death symbol here. 11 The process of cutting here is related to that noted in the preceding footnote. Again the passage deals with Doctor Percival, and the depiction of the girl's instinctive dread of him is tightened progressively from the Scribner's to the English to the American book version. * Reissued in 1958 by Longmans, Green, in their "Uniform Edition" of Cozzens.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Errata Lists in the First Aldine Editions of Caro's Rime and of the Due Orationi of St. Gregorius Nazianzenus by Curt F. Bühler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among his publications for the year 1569, 1 Aldus Manutius the Younger issued the first editions of Annibale Caro's Rime and the same author's Italian rendering of the Due orationi of St. Gregory of Nazianzus. 2 Both works were (posthumously) edited by Giovanni Battista Caro, a nephew of the author (who had died on 21 November 1566). 3 The editor also supplied each edition with a dedicatory preface, dated 1 May 1568, that to the Rime being addressed to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, the other to the latter's uncle, the Cardinal Alexander Farnese. Each work received a privilege for twenty years, which was granted by the Venetian Signoria ("in Pregadi") on 19 July 1568. In commenting on the Orations, 4 Renouard has remarked: "Ce volume est presque toujours relié avec le Rime ." The "almost always" may be a slight exaggeration, but it is unquestionably true that the two works are often found bound together. To his description of the Rime , 5 Renouard adds the comment: "Au verso de la page 103 est un errata de treize lignes, qui n'est pas imprimé dans tous les exemplaires. Je l'ai vu aussi imprimé à part, sur un feuillet blanc, ayant au bas: 'Humilissimo et Devotissimo Servitore, Gio. Battista Caro.' C'étoit peut-être l'exemplaire de dédicace." In the case of the Due orationi , 6 Renouard observes: "à la fin un [feuillet] d' errata qui, ainsi que le précédent dans les Rime , n'est pas dans tous les exemplaires, et laisse blanc ce dernier feuillet." This information, though correct in itself, does not supply a full account of what happened in the printing office. Apparently the sequence of events was this: Aldus Manutius Jr. intended to print the two works by Annibale Caro in such fashion that they could be sold either together or singly. After the machining of the two editions had been completed, the editor (or, possibly, the printer) became aware of certain misprints and decided to ameliorate these slips by providing a list of errata. The printer proceeded to apply this remedy in three different ways. Since the printing of both works had been completed, Aldus was able to insert the errata in those copies still in sheets (unbound) by printing the list on the blank verso of signature O4 of the Rime 7 and on the similar page (T6 recto) of the Due orationi 8 on a second trip through the press. 9 Both these lists have the simple heading "Errori de la stampa" and neither is signed with the name of the editor. 10 For the copies already disposed of or bound up, he printed a single leaf of errata for each work (or perhaps a broadside sheet which he then cut in half), which could be inserted into the separately-bound works. 11 These leaves have the headings "NELLE RIME. || Errori de la stampa." and "NELLE ORATIONI. || Errori de la stampa." respectively. Lastly, for those copies which he still planned to sell as a two-volume unit, Manutius issued a single sheet, on the outer forme of which he printed both sets of errata, with the fuller headings as given above. 12 All three sets of errata, in both instances, are printed from different settings of type. Many copies lack the errata lists in any form. 13 The problems that now arise are: What is the form of the "ideal copy," according to the principles as set forth by Professor Fredson Bowers, 14 and how will the collational formulae run for those copies where a leaf, or a sheet, has been inserted? But before we turn to these matters of central importance, it may be advisable to establish that all three printings, in both cases, undoubtedly represent different settings of type. It may be remarked, first of all, that this fact is perfectly self-evident to anyone who has the three sets of errata before him, being quite apparent from the differing alignment and spacings in the text. However, it is very difficult to set forth such details in print. It is much simpler to note evidences for the different settings in the case of the errata for the Orations than it is for the Rhymes, due to the very short list found in the latter work. Taking the Orations of St. Gregory first, one may note that the first line of errata reads "a faccie 1 a uersi 6" in the sheet and in the text printed on T6. This is correct, but in the single leaf , the text incorrectly reads "a faccie 3 a uersi 6." The last words of line 6 are "come se pensasse" in both inserted versions, but "come se pensassero" in the errata printed on T6. In the last line, the leaf and the printed-in text have "figlie," whereas the sheet provides "filie." This data should sufficiently identify the three settings of errata in the Due orationi . As for the Rime , we have already seen that the text in both the sheet and the leaf of errata is headed "NELLE RIME"; 15 this, together with the signature of the nephew Caro, is unnecessary for (and is consequently omitted from) the errata when printed on O4 v . After the signature of Caro, the leaf has a semi-colon, where the sheet provides a full-stop. The other differences are purely visual, but the points here given will serve to distinguish the three settings. It is patently evident, of course, that the inclusion of the errata was decided upon after all the sheets of the Rime and of the Due orationi had been printed off. Therefore, those copies with the errata printed in signatures O and T represent the latest state of these editions — and those without this feature, an earlier one. On the other hand, the inserted leaves could be bound in at various places, though they are normally found after P4 of the Rime 16 and after * 4 of the Due orationi . 17 This possibility seems to make an invariable collational formula a matter of speculation rather than of certainty. 18 Finally, the sheet which supplies the errata for both volumes presents (so far as the writer can see) a major problem for the descriptive bibliographer. In my copy, the sheet is bound between the two works, the errata for the Rime facing the last printed page of that work (P4 v ), while the corrections for the Due orationi face the title-page of this book. Should the sheet be listed at the end of the collational formula for the first work — or at the beginning of that of the second? Or does it properly belong to neither — being, actually, a separate (broadside) printing in its own right? Manifestly, since the two leaves are indubitably conjugates, they cannot be (mentally) cut asunder; it is, thus, impossible to assign one leaf to each book. And it would seem to make no sense at all arbitrarily to append the errata leaves for both volumes to the collational formula of either one of them. Lastly, if the sheet is considered to be a separate publication, then the "ideal copy" ought not to include this "extraneous" publication. The ideal copy would then be one without the errata, which would leave us with a prime absurdity, since the errata was created in order to perfect the text. Having unsuccessfully pondered this "pons asinorum" for more than four years, I will be happy to let some one else supply the solution for this quandary. 19</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I should like to take this opportunity to thank Professor Fredson Bowers for his kindness in reading an earlier draft of this paper and for giving me the benefit of his invaluable criticism and suggestions. 2 The imprint in both works reads: "IN VENETIA. || Appresso ALDO MANVTIO. || M D LXIX." and the books are assigned to Aldus Jr. by the Short-Title Catalogue of Books Printed in Italy and of Italian Books Printed in other Countries from 1465 to 1600 now in the British Museum (1958), p. 882. In Antoine Augustin Renouard, Annales de l'imprimerie des Alde (Paris, 1834), p. 206, they are listed under Paul Manuce. 3 For a short biographical sketch, see the Enciclopedia Italiana (Rome, 1929-39), IX, 109-110. 4 Renouard, p. 206. 5 In the University of Pennsylvania copy *46-1585, page 75 is signed N3 instead of L2, while other copies (e. g., Yale, Paris) are signed L3. Apparently the printer wished to correct the wrong signature mark L3 but mistakenly altered it to N3 rather than to the correct L2. 6 The University of Pennsylvania copy 858 C22 R has page 59 misnumbered 58, and there is an indentation at line 16. Other copies (thus the two in the British Museum and the four in the Bibliothèque Nationale) have the correct pagination and no indentation, apparently the result of stop-press emendation. The misprint on this page noted in the errata, however, is not corrected in either state. 7 For example, in the copies: Bodleian Library, Toynbee 702; John Carter Brown Library; Princeton University Library. 8 Thus in the following copies: Bodleian Library, Auct. R. 1. 5. 18; Trinity College Cambridge, N. 3. 41; Harvard College Library; Bibliothèque Nationale, Rés. C. 1418 (3), Rés. C. 1482, and C. 1483. 9 This is made evident by the fact that, in the Rime , the errata printed on signature O4 v [p. 104] includes the correction of a misprint on page 101 (O3 recto). Thus, both the mistake and the correction are printed in the outer forme of the same signature. If O3 had not already been printed, the printer could not have been aware of the misprint — or, if he had been aware of the error through page-proof or the like, he could have corrected the slip at the proper place without further comment. In the Orationi , the errata printed on T6 corrects a misprint on p. 137 (T1), the conjugate leaf. In short (and for the same reason as given above), the errata in the inner forme could only have been compiled after the outer forme had been printed, though normally the inner one was printed first. Water-marks appear on the two inner sheets, proving that the innermost pair form the odd half-sheet in this quire. 10 Copy *46-1586 (Pennsylvania) presents a problem. A single leaf, with the simple heading "Errori de la stampa," is inserted between T5 and T6. T1 and T6 are certainly conjugates, and T6 has an obvious offset from T5 v , proving that the errata leaf is inserted and is not the original T6. This might suggest that there was a fourth set of errata, one printed as an insert but with the shorter heading. To the writer, however, it seems more probable that this insert was the original T6 of some other copy and that it was added to the present copy long after the offsetting had occurred. 11 Thus in copies Pennsylvania 858 C22 R (Caro and Gregory) and Bodleian Toynbee 1116 ( Rime only). 12 The only such copy that I have seen is in my own library. 13 The errata is wanting in the following copies of the Rime : Trinity College Cambridge, N. 3. 40; British Museum, G 11117 and 85. c. 2; Pennsylvania *46-1585; Bodley, Auct. 2. R. III. 34; Bibliothèque Nationale, Rés. Yd 667; Harvard College Library (not bound with Gregory); Yale University and University of Illinois Libraries. These copies of the Due orationi lack the errata: British Museum, 1412. h. 17 and 85. c. 2; Yale and Illinois (both bound with Rime ); New York Public Library; and Bibliothèque Nationale, C. 1481. 14 In his Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949). 15 In the Due orationi too, of course, the printed version differs from the inserted ones, which alone have the heading "NELLE ORATIONI." 16 It could also, for example, be inserted after O4. The collation for the Rime is: Quarto; *4 B-P 4 . Quire P contains only the "Tavola" for Caro's verse. 17 As we have seen, it is bound between T5 and T6 in one copy. The collation for the Due orationi is: Quarto; *4 B-S 4 T6. 18 One may also debate as to whether the ideal copy is one with the errata printed in it or one with an inserted leaf (or sheet). If both forms are "ideal copies," then the collational formula would exist in four (possibly five) varying forms (singly, with and without extra leaf; together, with and without inserted sheet or leaves). In any case, the inclusion of the errata was not envisaged when publication was begun — and it is possible (though not very likely) that a considerable length of time elapsed before the errata was produced. However, so large a percentage of copies without errata is noted here that it seems equally unlikely that the addition of the errata was determined upon immediately after original publication of the two books. This possible time interval may raise the problem as to whether we are here dealing with states or issues. 19 Professor Bowers has suggested to me that this would present no problem, if one argues that the two works together form a collected edition, and that the sheet exists solely as a supplement to the two-work unit. In that case, the ideal formula would simply be a variant, consisting of the formulae for the two works with the sheet χ 2 between them. Nevertheless, one must face the possibility that the survival of the double errata as conjugate leaves may be purely accidental and not by the will of the printer. Under these circumstances, we do not actually know what the printer had in mind — and how he wished the "ideal copy" to appear (if, indeed, he had the slightest interest in the matter). In any case, I cannot find any simple explanation as to why different settings were needed — or used — to supply the errata.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">On the Tercera Parte of Calderon — 1664 by Edward M. Wilson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are two distinct editions of the Tercera parte of Calderón dated 1664. 1 The problems of the two editions of the Segunda parte dated 1637 led H. C. Heaton in 1937 to suggest that what he found in the earlier parte might also be true of this later one. 2 I wish to re-examine this suggestion. The ordinary edition of the Tercera parte may be found in the following libraries: there are two copies in the Vatican (Barb. KKK. vii. 23 and R. G. Lett. Est. IV. 261), one each in the Biblioteca Nacional Madrid (R / 10637), in the Ticknor collection in the Boston (Mass.) Public Library (D. 140. b. 40), in the Bibliothèque Nationale Paris (Yg. 223), in the private collection of Arturo Sedó (formerly in that of Emilio Cotarelo), in the British Museum (C. 57. c. 40), in the University Library Cambridge (Hisp. 5. 64. 3) and in my own collection. 3 The U.L.C. copy formerly belonged to Norman Maccoll, who also owned a different edition with a similar but varying title-page; this book also is in the U.L.C. (Hisp. 5. 68. 12), 4 and I know of no other copies of it. It was mentioned by Heaton in his article on the Segunda parte , and it has also been referred to by Professor E. W. Hesse. 5 I shall adopt their nomenclature for the two editions. That which I have called the "ordinary edition" has in the title-page dedication to a Spanish nobleman the abbreviation Excel mo , whereas in the other the word Excelentissimo is fully spelled out. Excelmo and Excelentissimo will make convenient names for the purposes of this enquiry. I have based the following description of the Excelmo edition on the copies in the British Museum, the University Library, the Biblioteca Nacional and my own collection. Title page: see plate 1.

In fact one edition is—except for a short gap on fols. 241-246—a page-for-page reprint of the other. Professor Hesse asserts that Excelmo is the earlier edition, 7 but he does not give reasons for his statement. The dates of the various documents in the preliminaries are identical, but there are a few differences in wording in them. The Licencia of Excelmo refers to "vn Libro de Tercera Parte de diferentes Comedias ", whereas that of Excelentissimo describes it as "vn Libro de diuersas Comedias ". As neither adjective occurs on either title page, the difference proves nothing. More important, perhaps, is the fact that Excelmo lists ten errata in its Fee , whereas Excelentissimo gives none at all. This would be significant if the errata in Excelmo were all corrected in Excelentissimo . Before this question can be decided the errata themselves must be examined in Excelmo . The Licentiate Carlos Murcia de la Llana badly bungled his job with this volume. Of the ten errata listed, six are given wrong line-references. Other misprints are so obvious that no compositor who took Excelmo for his copy could fail to correct them. 8 Four of them are miscorrections: the corrector is altering what the author intended to say. Three do not appear in the text of any of the four copies of Excelmo examined. The following examples may show how unreliable official corrections could be: for, for one play in this volume— En esta vida todo es verdad y todo mentira —we fortunately can consult the author's autograph manuscript. 9 It seems to prove conclusively that the corrector never saw the original used by the printer. Here are three instances: (a) "Fol. 19. pag. 2. col. 1. lin. 12. mosicos, di musicos." The reference is to line 13. Cintia and Libia have sung a song. Leonido and the clown Luquete come on to the stage, drawn by the sound of their music. Leon . Siempre la musica fue el iman de mis sentidos. Luq . Buena la musica ha sido, si no tuuiera mosicos. ( Excelmo ) What Calderón wrote was: Leo . Siempre la musica fue el yman demis sentidos. Luq . Buena la mosica fuera si no tubiera mosicos. MS. fol. 44v.) Leonido is talking about the music; the clown Luquete misunderstands him (or pretends to) and makes música into mocica —a young girl. Leonido says: "Music was always the loadstone of my senses." Luquete replies: "The girl would be good if she had no young men about the place." The Excelmo text obscures Calderón's joke; the corrector's emendation altogether destroys it. (b) "Fol. 23. pag. 1. col. 2. lin 15. delatando, di declarando." Calderón wrote "delatando"; Excelmo and Excelentissimo both followed it. (c) "Fol. 120. pag. 2. col. 24. moger, di muger." There is only one column on the part of the page in which the supposed erratum occurs. Again a clown is speaking. The form "moger" occurs also in a clown's speech in La púrpura de la rosa ( Excelmo , fol. 209, wrongly numbered 219, col. 2. line 27). Clearly this too is a deliberate rusticism of Calderón's which the corrector has misunderstood. Here Excelentissimo (fol. 120v) follows the corrector. No reliance can be placed on the errata of the two editions, but there is nothing here to contradict Professor Hesse's theory of the priority of Excelmo . Example (c) might seem to support it. There are many textual differences between the editions. I have examined some passages that occur above the catch-words on some pages, and whenever there is a significant divergence, Excelmo gives the better reading. At the foot of 53 recto a line which occurs in Excelmo does not occur in Excelentissimo ; at the foot of 87 recto the "viua" of Excelmo makes sense, whereas the "vida" of the other edition makes none; at the foot of 120 recto Excelmo reads "no quedes oy" which makes sense, whereas the "no quedes yo" of Excelentissimo makes neither sense nor grammar. Similar instances can be found in comparing the readings at the right-hand bottom corners of fols. 137r, 207r 10 and 231 verso. It seems unlikely that Excelmo could have been set up from the other edition, even if it had been corrected by an intelligent reviser for that purpose. Almost certainly, then, Excelmo was the earlier. The autograph manuscript of En esta vida provides the definite proof of Excelmo 's priority. At one point in the second act of this play the two clowns Luquete and Sabañón are asked whom they are waiting for by the two young men Eraclio and Leonido. They ought to reply "Cintia, Queen of Trinacria", but as they are clowns Calderón intended them to make nonsense of their answer. Here is the dialogue according to the manuscript: Leo . quien es la que aguardan Era . quien es la que esperan Los dos Doña Cinta Reyna de triaca (fol. 41r) Instead of the queen's name they say "ribbon", instead of Trinacria an "antidote". The Excelmo printer again made nonsense of the joke: Leo . Quien es la q~ aguarda? Eracl . Quien es la que espera? Los dos . D. Cintia Reyna de Tiacra [sic]. (fol. 17v, col. 2) The compositor of Excelentissimo , misunderstanding completely the dramatist's intention, changed the last line to: D. Cintia Reyna de Trinacria 11 This single example proves the priority of Excelmo . It also shews that the corruption of Calderón's texts began before Vera Tassis. The falsely-dated editions of the Primera and Segunda partes (dated 1640 and 1637 respectively) had certain characteristics in common which differentiate them from the genuinely-dated editions of those years. The editions I have called QCL (1636) and VSL (the genuine edition of 1640) of the Primera parte , as well as those Heaton called QC (the genuine edition of 1637) and S (1641) of the Segunda parte , have no such suspicious features. 12 The falsely-dated editions are VS ( Primera parte dated 1640) and Q ( Segunda parte , dated 1637). If the Excelentissimo edition of the Tercera parte has peculiarities in common with those of VS and Q, then we may claim that it too is falsely dated, as Heaton supposed. VS and Q are shorter books than their originals VSL and QC; Excelentissimo has the same number of pages that Excelmo has. VS and Q either suppress or greatly abbreviate the dedications previously printed in the preliminaries of VSL and QC; Excelentissimo reprints in full the dedicatory material of Excelmo . VS and Q suppress the name of the bookseller given on the title-pages of VSL and QC; Excelentissimo reprints the names and addresses of the printer and bookseller of Excelmo . VS and Q incorporate a number of stylistic and textual emendations that do not occur in VSL and QC; I have not detected a single variant in Excelentissimo for which such a claim can be made. The revised spelling of VS and Q as against VSL and QC is both more marked and more consistent than the variations in spelling incorporated into Excelentissimo . 13 None, then, of the most typical common features of the falsely-dated editions is to be found in this one. It seems more probable that it was an ordinary reprint of Excelmo , in much the same way that VSL was a reprint of QCL and S of QC. In my study of the problems of the Primera parte I attempted to shew that the two falsely-dated editions VS and Q were probably printed by Joseph Fernández de Buendía, who also printed the genuine Quarta parte of 1672 and the Primera parte de autos sacramentales of 1677. He is known to have worked between the years 1658-1679, and books printed by his widow appeared in 1680. I established that two wood-blocks in Q also occur in works undoubtedly printed by Buendía. In VS there is also a peculiar form of the minuscule letter j with two dots instead of one, which (although it was occasionally used by one or two other Madrid printers after 1648) can also be found in some of Buendía's books. Excelentissimo has no woodblocks except for an initial letter P in the preliminaries and the shield of Don Antonio Pedro Álvarez Ossorio on the title-page. The other clue, however, is more promising, because there are some double-dotted js in the preliminaries and in the text. They do not, however, occur uniformly through the book as they do in VS but only in some gatherings: a , A-F, Cc-Ff. There is, then, a possibility that Buendía may have set up some gatherings of this volume, but there is no indication that he was the only printer involved in the whole. This is the only link that I have been able to discover between Excelentissimo and the falsely-dated partes VS and Q. Perhaps the most important common feature of Excelmo and Excelentissimo is the shield of Don Antonio on their title pages. This appears to be identical in the two editions. We may therefore assume that even if García Morrás did not print both books, he at least permitted, and possibly arranged, the printing of the second. Possibly Excelentissimo was an ordinary commercial reprint of Excelmo , and as it was a page-for-page reprint of the earlier book, there could have been no difficulty in apportioning the different gatherings among several printers, of whom Buendía may have been one. Calderón was a famous man in the sixties, and there is no reason why his Tercera parte should not have gone into two editions, if not between 9 August (the date of the Fee de erratas ) and 31 December of that year, at least between 1664 and the expiry of the privilege in 1674. If so, the two editions of the Tercera parte would parallel the two editions of the genuine Primera parte (1636, 1640), of the Segunda parte (1637, 1641) and of the Quarta parte (1672, 1674). So that though Excelentissimo may also have been falsely dated, it may not have been falsely dated in order to deceive either intending purchasers or even the licensing authorities. The false date could conceivably have been accidental. Another printer, told to copy Excelmo page-for-page, might scrupulously reproduce a date on a title page also, even if it were no longer the date of issue. If this argument can be accepted, then the parallel is not so much with the relation of VS to VSL or Q to QC as with that of VSL to QCL or of S to QC. The extreme rarity of Excelentissimo remains unexplained, but its mere existence does not seem very hard to account for.</field>

Consonantal internal u is sometimes, but not often, replaced by v in Excelentissimo . The spelling etc. of both these editions seem to me fairly typical of ordinary printer's usage of the 1660s.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Gorboduc, Ferrex and Porrex : The First Two Quartos by I. B. Cauthen, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first quarto of the tragedy of Gorboduc, written by Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville, appeared on September 22, 1565, from the press of William Griffith. Its title, The Tragedie of Gorboduc , has been usually adopted by later editors. The second quarto, which appeared in 1570 with the imprint of John Day, bears the title The Tragidie of Ferrex and Porrex , a form that editors have often adopted as a subtitle. 1 Despite the difference in the title, both are the same play, performed by the Gentlemen of the Inner Temple before the Queen on January 18, 1561. The first quarto, it is evident, comes from an unauthorized source; the second quarto probably appeared because the authors were dissatisfied with the corruptions of the first. In an address to the reader in Q2, Day arraigns the first quarto and its printer. After declaring that the authors never intended for the play to be published, he continues: yet one W.G. getting a copie therof at some yongmans hand that lacked a litle money and much discretion, in the last great plage . . . put it forth excedingly corrupted: euen as if by meanes of a broker for hire, he should haue entised into his house a faire maide and done her villanie, and after all to bescratched her face, torne her appareil, berayed and disfigured her, and then thrust her out of doores dishonested. In such plight after long wandring she came at length home . . . to her frendes . . . . They, the authors I meane, . . . haue for common honestie and shamefastnesse new apparelled, trimmed, and attired her in such forme as she was before. Such hyperbole is only in part justified. Although some one hundred and fifty substantive changes are made in Q1 readings, Q2 retains at least five errors of Q1 and introduces some nine manifest errors of its own. Finally, an eight-line passage is omitted in Q2, perhaps for political reasons. Moreover, despite these divergencies and despite Day's harsh judgment of Griffith's work, Q1 was not so dishonested that it could not be corrected to serve as copy-text for Q2. It is evident that Day did not print from manuscript: certain bibliographical features are present that show that Q1, heavily corrected, was used as the copy-text for Q2. 2 The most obvious bibliographical detail that shows this dependence of Q2 on Q1 is a unique "white-space" that occurs in the same place in both quartos. In both texts, when a new sentence begins in mid-line it follows closely on the full stop of the preceding sentence. In Q2 there are twenty-four such mid-line sentence beginnings following a full stop or a question mark. But in Q1, at D1.26, a large white-space appears, measuring eleven millimetres. In Q2 at F2 v .21 (IV.ii.142) 3 a similar large white-space appears in the identical place, this time measuring four millimetres. When the invariable practice of both quartos is to have no such white-space between sentences in mid-line, it is quite conclusive that in this single instance, and at the same place in the text, both quartos agree in such a space. Other details confirm the evidence indicated by this unique white-space. For example, in both texts in the "domme shew" before the first act, Gorboduc is referred to as "Duke Gorboduc"; he is listed in the names of the speakers as "King of great Brittaine" in both, and in the dumb show before the fourth act he is called "King." Again, at I.ii.60, the Q1 reading, "The Realme deuided into two sondrie partes," is retained in Q2 despite its extrametrical and redundant effect. 4 At I.ii.233 in both texts, Philander, addressing the King, uses "My lordes," although his words clearly indicate that he is not speaking to the assembled nobles. At IV.i.68, in the line "Nor neuer bode I painefull throwes for thee," bode is surely a mistake for bore . At III.i.103 final punctuation for the last line of Gorboduc's speech is omitted in both quartos. And at IV.i.23-26 the incorrect punctuation of Q1, along with a possible incorrect repetition, is retained in Q2: O my swete childe, My deare Ferrex , my Joye, my lyues delyght. Is my welbeloued sonne, is my swete childe, My deare Ferrex , my Joye, my lyues delight Murdered with cruell death? The full stop after "delyght" is unnecessary, and the strangely repeated line perhaps shows us how the line should be punctuated — either with no punctuation at all or with nothing more than a light mark. The dependence of Q2 upon Q1 is seen again in the use of parentheses. In both quartos they are most often used in terms of address, and the correlation between the use and non-use of parentheses with these terms of address is so extremely high that Q2's dependence upon Q1 is evident. In the sixty-seven terms of address, parentheses are used in both quartos to enclose the same twenty-five of these phrases; forty-two of these terms of address do not have parentheses. There is thus complete unanimity in the agreement between the two quartos in the use or non-use of parentheses. Only the most fortuitous and unbelievable set of circumstances could have brought about complete agreement if Q2 had not been set from Q1. Moreover, in addition to these terms of address, certain other expressions, either appositive or interjectional, show almost such a high degree of correlation. There are twenty-one examples of such appositive and interjectional expressions; there are only two divergencies in the two quartos in their use or non-use of parentheses, but nineteen agreements. 5 From the evidence of the unique white-space, the common errors, and the high correlation in the use of parentheses, we may be sure that Q2 was set from a corrected copy of Q1. The new apparel with which Day clothed the text did not quite cover the "dishonested" body beneath. 6</field>
      <field name="fulltext">notes 1 The unique copy of Q1 is at the Huntington Library (STC 18684); Q2 is reproduced in the Tudor Facsimile Texts series (1908). I have used this facsimile here, but I have checked it in any doubtful points with the original in the British Museum (C.34.a.6). 2 Sir Walter Greg pointed out in his Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (I, 115) that "while Day's printing is much superior to Griffith's, there can be little doubt that [Q2] was set up from a corrected copy of [Q1]"; I trust that even that "little doubt" (should it exist) can here be resolved by the presentation of strictly bibliographical evidence. 3 The most accessible modern text of the play is that in Chief Pre-Shakespearean Dramas , ed. Joseph Quincy Adams (1924); references here are to that text. 4 A close study of the substantive variants shows that the corrector of Q2 was acutely conscious of extrametrical lines and corrected to bring them into the iambic pentameter scheme; in this line, as in a few others, he missed the extra syllable. 5 The two divergencies may require some conjecture. At V.ii.229 Q1 reads "(O Brittaine Land)", Q2 has only "O Brittaine"; if the corrector struck the word Land from Q1, he may have struck the parentheses at the same time. Two changes, one substantive, one accidental, occurring together may be attributed to the corrector. Second, at V.ii.272, the corrector may have together may be attributed to the corrector. realized that the Q1 expression "(O happie man)" is not a vocative at all but a truncated cry, usual at the end of such a drama as Gorboduc , "O happy [is the] man whom speedy death deprives of life." The important evidence is not in the divergencies but in the nineteen agreements. 6 I am grateful for the assistance of the Old Dominion Foundation in support of this and other projects during the summer of 1960.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">New Year's Day Gift Books in the Sixteenth Century by Edwin Haviland Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About 1520, in dedicating a translation of Pico della Mirandola to his "beloued sister in crist Joyeuce Leigh," Sir Thomas More observed: "It is and of longe time hath bene my well beloued sister a custome in the begynnyng of the new yere frendes to sende betwene presentis or yestis as the witnesses of their loue and frendsship and also signifyenge that they desyre eche to other that yere a gode contynuance and prosperous ende of that lukky bigynnyng." 1 When More wrote, the practice of giving books at New Year's time was not new. His friend Erasmus had presented at least three translations to patrons on these occasions. Probably in the preceding century manuscripts had been sent as gifts. At any rate in the sixteenth century it was not uncommon for authors to present their books to friends or patrons at this season. Amateurs like the author of The Dyetary of ghostly helthe (1520) and Walter Bailey, who in three successive years printed at his own expense little tracts on health as New Year's gifts, chose this method of bestowing greetings and presents upon their intimates. 2 Not all writers, however, were without ulterior motives. George Gascoigne, who wanted the unbending Elizabeth to bend slightly, offered her manuscripts in 1576 and 1577. 3 Though Gascoigne concealed his designs, as courtiers were wont to do, Thomas Churchyard, perhaps the most industrious and (almost) the most pedestrian of Elizabethan hacks, forthrightly stated his materialistic motivation: Then thought I to beginne the yere: On Newe yeres daie with some deuice, And though that many men be nice, And blushe to make an honest shifte, I sent eche Lorde a Newe yeres gifte: Such treasure as I had that tyme, A laughyng verse, a merrie ryme. . . . Some thinke this is a crauyng guise, Tushe holde your peace, world waxeth wise A dulled horse that will not sturre, Must be remembred with a spurre: And where there serues ne spurre nor wand, A man must needs lead horse in hande. So I was forste on causes greate, To see in fire where laye the heate: And warme their witts that cold did waxe, But thrust the fire into the Flax. But, as he later admitted with the candor that makes him, despite his wearying prose and poetry, a likeable person, "nothyng did retourne to me, / That I could either feele or se." 4 Although I have examined many books written by Elizabethan hacks like Churchyard, evidently few followed his example. This is perhaps surprising since Elizabethan professionals like ferrets seized opportunities to present volumes to reluctant patrons. If, on the other hand, Churchyard's failure to profit by New Year's gift books was typical, it is understandable that his fellow authors exploited occasions which promised more than the year-end festive season. 5 Of the important writers of the century few apparently exploited the holiday, unless Spenser intended Daphnaïda as a present to the Marquise of Northampton. 6 In the preface to The Scholemaster Roger Ascham wrote: "I thought to praepare some little treatise for a New yeares gift that Christmas," but "the worke rose dailie higher and wider, than I thought it would at the beginninge." 7 I have been able to identify thirty-seven books and twelve manuscripts intended as New Year's greetings. Unquestionably the practice was more widespread than these numbers indicate; otherwise the ridicule of a character in The Return from Parnassus is pointless: "I had almoste forgotten the cheife pointe I cald thee out for: new years day approcheth, and wheras other gallants bestowe Jewells upon there Mistrisses (as I haue done whilome), I now count it base to do as the common people doe; I will bestow upon them the precious stons of my witt, a diamonde of Inuention, that shall be aboue all value &amp; esteeme." 8 The following compilation of New Year's Day gift books is far from complete, and can only be considered a trial list. However, it is the first list that includes books written during the reign of Elizabeth I; Garrod and Bennett stopped at 1557. Despite its inadequacies, it should be useful to students of sixteenth-century printing and authorship, since it sheds light on an aspect of Tudor publication that was until recently neglected. Perhaps this checklist will lead to a greater interest in the subject and to a much larger number of citations. The entries include the following information in this order: the date, the author and title of the work, the entry number in A Short-Title Catalogue , the dedicatee, a brief quotation to establish it as a gift book or manuscript, 9 and the source of information in secondary works.

      <field name="heading_text">A Note on Printers' Measures by W. Craig Ferguson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">R.B. McKerrow stated that many composing sticks of different fixed lengths were used in early printing shops. 1 Referring to Blades' study of Caxton, he pointed out that there were at least fourteen different lengths of measure used in Caxton's shop. In the printing shop of Valentine Simmes, a later Elizabethan stationer, there was a much greater variation in line-lengths, and, if McKerrow was correct, Simmes used no fewer than 42 composing sticks. It would seem much more likely that Simmes's compositors used composing sticks which could be varied in length as required. An examination of Simmes's books shows that his octavos varied in line-length from 51 mm. to 76 mm., his quartos from 77 mm. to 107 mm., his four folios used lengths of 98, 101, 114, and 130 mm., and his 32mos employed lengths of 22 mm. and 38 mm. There was no favoured length of line in octavos, although six were set at 64 mm.; a length of from 85 to 90 mm. was preferred in quartos. The following table shows the number of books set at the various line-lengths. The first figure is the number of books printed with a particular line-length, and the second figure is the length of the line in millimeters. For example, the first numbers, 1/51, indicate that one book was composed with a line-length of 51 mm. Octavo format: 1/51 1/59 1/65 1/52 3/60 2/69 3/54 1/61 1/70 1/57 1/63 1/75 1/58 6/64 1/76 quarto format: 1/77 6/85 4/92 1/79 2/86 2/93 3/80 8/87 2/94 7/81 10/88 2/95 4/82 18/89 1/98 5/83 4/90 1/105 7/84 1/91 1/107 McKerrow noted that certain of Caxton's line-lengths appeared in several books printed in a relatively short space of time, thus suggesting that composing sticks of a fixed length were used until discarded. By contrast, Simmes's most common line-lengths appeared throughout his printing career (1594-1607), as the following tabulation of the seven most common line-lengths shows. This distribution further suggests that a stick of variable length was used, and that Simmes selected particular lengths whenever they were called for by the job at hand. The first figure in the tabulation is the number of books printed with a particular line-length, and the second figure is the year in which these books appeared. 64 mm.: 1/1595, 1/1600, 2/1602, 3/1603 81 mm.: 1/1601, 1/1604, 1/1605, 3/1607 84 mm.: 2/1596, 1/1599, 1/1602, 2/1604 85 mm.: 1/1595, 1/1597, 1/1599, 1/1603, 1/1604, 1/1605 87 mm.: 4/1596, 2/1597, 1/1598, 1/1599 88 mm.: 1/1595, 1/1598, 2/1600, 2/1601, 2/1602, 1/1603, 1/1607 89 mm.: 1/1597, 1/1599, 6/1600, 1/1603, 3/1604, 1/1605, 3/1606, 2/1607</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Earliest London Printings of "Verses on the Death of Doctor Swift" by A. H. Scouten</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Despite the biographical testimony indicating that "Verses on the Death of Doctor Swift" was first printed in January 1739 by C. Bathurst in London, Dr. H. Teerink has offered, in Studies in Bibliography , IV, 183-188, three kinds of evidence to suggest that Swift's poem was previously printed in 1736. He cites a pirated edition of Pope's Essay on Man that includes "Verses on the Death of Doctor Swift," now at the University Library, Cambridge, with the date of 1736 on the following general title page: An / Essay / On / Man. / With some / Humorous Verses / on the / Death of Dean Swift , / Written by Himself. / [ornament] / Dublin: / Printed, &amp; Sold by the Booksellers of / London &amp; Westminster. / [rule] / MDCCXXXVI. (I shall cite this printing as Teerink IV.) He presents variant readings of the text of Swift's poem from the above edition, from other pirated issues, and from one of the Bathurst folios of 1739 to show that the latter must have been printed from the edition dated 1736. He invokes the analogy of Pope's intricate publishing practices, stating that the procedure with the present work was to bring out a pseudo-surreptitious printing to suggest that a stolen manuscript had reached the press, follow it with a reprint purported to be derived from a Dublin edition, and then release the "genuine" edition. The identical curved F was used in "SWIFT" in each title page but I wish to demolish this attractive series of arguments by the sole method of presenting a collation of readings from the texts of the early printings, and from this collation also attempt to show the proper sequence of the five Bathurst folios of 1739. On 5 January 1738/39, William King wrote Swift that "Verses" had gone to press ( Correspondence , ed. F. Elrington Ball, VI, 106). On 17 January Bathust announced in the Daily Advertiser , "Tomorrow will be publish'd" the "Verses"; on 19 January his advertisement read, "This Day are publish'd" (repeated on 20, 23, 25, 27 and 31 January). He listed a new advertisement of the "Verses" in the Daily Advertiser of 9 February (repeated 15 February). On 6 March King reported to Mrs. Whiteway that "Two editions have already been sold off . . ." (VI, 114). And on 29 March Bathurst's notice read, "This Day is Publish'd (Price 1s) The Third Edition." Of both the second and third editions two states exist. I will list the title pages in which all five of the printings appeared, though this is not the arrangement given by Dr. Teerink under item 771 in his Bibliography , and I will refer to them as B ( i.e. , Bathurst) a, b, c, d, and e.

In examining these copies for his forthcoming bibliography of English verse, 1700-1750, D. F. Foxon has kindly informed me that B d seems to be partly the same setting of type as B c and would therefore precede B e . Dr. Teerink also lists four other printings of An Essay on Man which include the "Verses" (in the article cited above and again in Studies in Bibliography , VII, 238-239). However, he offers no proof to show that any of them were printed before 1739. One, his IVa, was set from IV; and the others show readings that first appeared in the text of "Verses" as printed in the Miscellanies of 1742. Consequently, the only text that must be dealt with is that with the date 1736 on the general title page. The collational readings come from the five Bathurst folios and from the printing of "Verses" dated 1736.

Swift used numerous spokesmen in his poem, and it is not always clear whether their statements are to be rendered as direct or as indirect discourse. In B e and Teerink IV, but not in the earlier folios, quotation marks have been inserted for lines 151-162, 169-174, 190-194, 283-286, and 290-293 (except for the omission in Teerink IV of terminal quotation marks at line 194). In view of the sequence of readings listed above, to support Dr. Teerink's thesis we would have to assume that Teerink IV was printed from one manuscript of Swift's poem (with B e set from Teerink IV) and that B a was set from a different manuscript. However, the textual collation renders such hypotheses untenable. From these readings, we can see a text of the poem evolving through five printings. The readings from B b in lines 16, 63, 72, 278, and 281 above show variants from B a which were continued in the remaining three folios and in Teerink IV. The readings from B c in the epigraph, in lines 24 and 36, and the punctuation in lines 8 and 147 show variants from B b retained in the remaining two folios and in Teerink IV. The readings from B d in lines 126, 147, and 214 show variants from B c retained in B e and Teerink IV, especially the reading "the Judgment" of line 126 which Dr. Teerink, in his SB article, uses to demonstrate the priority of Teerink IV. We know from the entries in his Swift bibliography that he had never seen a copy of B d ; consequently, he did not know that this reading of line 126 had already entered the text. (It was not until I found a copy of B d at Harvard that I felt able to prove a line of textual descent.) Finally, the readings from B e in lines 16, 21, 25, 37, 41, 52, 64, 76, 88, 220, and the above-mentioned insertion of quotation marks, show changes from B d which were followed by Teerink IV. The conclusion to be drawn from this textual collation is, I think, indisputable. The text which Pope and King sent to Bathurst developed through the five folios with changes made in each printing until it reached the condition from which it was used for Teerink IV. Never having seen B d , Dr. Teerink lacked sufficient evidence to observe the line of textual descent that I have traced in my collation above. In fact, there is some very slight evidence that Teerink IV may have been printed from the text of Swift's poem as it appeared in Bathurst's 1742 edition of the Miscellanies . This text was set from B e , and it contains the following variants which also appear in Teerink IV: "Monday," in line 256, and "Craftsman," in line 272, are italicized; "to" in line 234 is followed by a dash; and line 319 reads "'scape" for "scape." There still remains the fact that Teerink IV carries the date 1736. I have searched for some time to secure bibliographic evidence explaining this misdating. I have not found the printer's ornaments used in it in any other work of the 1730's or 1740's that I have examined. Both Maynard Mack and Irvin Ehrenpreis have kindly examined Teerink IV for me. 1 The former points out that gathering E (in six) which contains Swift's poem could have been added to a reissue. Ehrenpreis comments on the rather odd fact that the general title page is engraved and that it is not conjugate with another leaf. But it does not matter. The textual collation shows that the text of the London edition evolved throughout the five Bathurst folios printed between January and March 1739 and that Teerink IV must have been printed after that time. It and the other four pirated editions listed by Dr. Teerink were very likely printed after the deaths of Pope and Swift.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of Fielding's Miscellanies (1743) by Donald D. Eddy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The assertion that the first two editions of Henry Fielding's Miscellanies (both published in April 1743) are in reality only one edition, was first made over forty years ago. 1 However, recent bibliographic studies, such as William B. Todd's "Recurrent Printing" ( SB , XII [1958], 189-198), have stimulated a re-examination of the truth of such statements. Since the two standard bibliographies of Fielding—in volume III of Cross's History and in volume II of CBEL —both rely upon the information printed on title pages, and since such information is frequently misleading bibliographically, it may be worthwhile to examine the Miscellanies in some detail. The history of the composition and publication of this work is one of delays and postponements. At some time during the winter of 1741-1742 Fielding issued proposals for printing by subscription a miscellaneous collection of his works, both poetry and prose, in three volumes. On June 3, 1742, Henry Woodfall printed 700 more proposals for Fielding. 2 Two days later the Daily Post printed a notice of these proposals which describes the contents of the volumes and then states: The Price to Subscribers is One Guinea; and Two Guineas for the Royal Paper. One Half of which is to be paid at Subscribing, the other on the Delivery of the Book in Sheets. The Subscribers Names will be printed. Note, The Publication of these Volumes hath been hitherto retarded by the Author's indisposition last Winter, and a Train of melancholy Accidents scarce to be parallell'd; but he takes this Opportunity to assure his Subscribers, that he will most certainly deliver them within the Time mentioned in his last Receipts, viz. by the 25th of December next. Subscriptions are taken in by Mr. A. Millar, Bookseller, opposite St. Clement's Church in the Strand. As the Books will very shortly go to the Press, Mr. Fielding begs the Favour of those who intend to subscribe to do it immediately. 3 However, in the winter of 1742-1743 Fielding was again plagued with sickness and worries (which he describes in the preface to the Miscellanies ), and so publication was again postponed. On February 14, 1742/43, the Daily Advertiser carried the following notice: One Monday the 28th instant will be ready to be deliver'd to the Subscribers . . . Miscellanies . . . . Those who are pleas'd to subscribe to these Miscellanies, and have not yet sent in their Names, are desir'd to do it before the 22d instant, on which Day the Subscription will be closed: And all such as have dispos'd of any Receipts, and have not yet sent in the Names of the Subscribers are requested to do it within the above-mention'd Time. 4 For some reason, however, the volumes were not published on February 28. The next notice to the subscribers appeared in the St. James Evening Post of March 22-24, 24-26, and 26-29: " On Thursday the 7th of April , will be deliver'd to the SUBSCRIBERS, MISCELLANIES. IN THREE VOLUMES, octavo, By HENRY FIELDING, Esq;" 5 Finally, in its issue of April 5-7, 1743, the General Evening Post announced that " This Day , April 7, began to be delivered to the Subscribers, Miscellanies. . . ." 6 This first edition, "printed for the Author and sold by A. Millar," was issued (according to the subscription list) to 427 subscribers who took a total of 556 sets (214 on royal paper at two guineas a set, and 342 on coarse paper at one guinea a set). The list of subscribers was printed alphabetically at the front of the first volume, and Fielding was undoubtedly pleased with the 770 guineas he received. In fact, since the printing of the Miscellanies cost Fielding less than £100 (see below), he had a net profit of over £700, which is more than he received for any of his works with the exception of Amelia . The General Evening Post for April 21-23 announced that " Next Week will be published , Price bound 15s. The Second Edition, of Miscellanies. . . ." In its next issue of April 23-26, 1743, the same paper advertised that " This Day were published . . . The Second Edition, of Miscellanies. . . ." 7 This so-called second edition, "printed for A. Millar" and minus the list of subscribers, 8 was thus offered to the public only nineteen days after the first edition was ready for the subscribers. Careful comparison of these two "editions" indicates not only that they are in truth, one edition but also that they are merely varying states of the same impression. 9 The first state is composed of copies printed on both royal paper and coarse paper and contains the list of subscribers. Copies of the second state have different title pages, lack the list of subscribers, and are printed only on coarse paper. More specific information is given in the following description of variants.

Copies consulted: University of Chicago, University of Illinois, University of Michigan, Newberry Library. J. P. de Castro (p. 259) was the first person to publish the fact that William Strahan was the printer of this volume. The entry in Strahan's ledger is as follows: April 2, 1743. For printing the first vol. of Fielding's Miscellanies 26½ sheets pica 8°, no. 1000 coarse and 200 fine, at £1 : 2 : 6 per sheet £29 : 16 : 0 The first state of this volume contains 26 sheets plus one leaf of printed material, but the second state contains only 24¾ sheets. The majority of the copies printed were second state; so by charging for 26½ sheets for all the copies printed, Strahan increased his profit at Fielding's expense. 11 Volume II contains 26½ sheets and volume III 27 sheets. Assuming the same rate for the printing of these volumes, the total cost to Fielding for printing his Miscellanies was approximately £90. I assume that Strahan made a mistake in listing only 200 copies printed on the fine (or "royal") paper. In the first place, the subscription list calls for 214 copies on royal paper. Secondly, we know that there were some subscribers whose names are not on the subscription list. 12 Thirdly, we know that 250 copies of volume III were printed on royal paper (see below). Since the royal-paper copies are noticeably larger than those printed on coarse paper, Millar would surely have detected a shortage of fifty copies of volume I. Strahan may have been unfair to Fielding but certainly not to this extent; the ledger entry must be in error. First State, Volume II. Title: MISCELLANIES, / BY / Henry Fielding Esq; / [rule] / VOL.

      <field name="fulltext">Facts and Conjectures Concerning the Printing Volume I was printed in a somewhat unusual manner. In the first state i A and a (including d1-3) were printed as separate sheets, whereas Z1 was printed separately. In the i A gathering, however, leaves 1 and 2, 3 and 6, 4 and 5, and 7 and 8 are conjugate. 15 The evidence of the watermarks and chain lines indicates that the imposition was as follows: Thus i A3-6 were in their normal order for an octavo forme, and i A1-2 and i A7-8 were cut out and pasted before and after i A3-6. This method kept the title and special title conjugate and yet separate from the list of subscribers. As a result of such a method, however, the evidence of the watermarks is not uniform in all copies. In some cases the title pages printed on one sheet were bound with the list of subscribers printed on another sheet. In the a gathering, leaves 1 and 5, 2 and 4, and d1.2 are conjugate. a3 is pasted in between a2.4 and d3 is pasted in after d2. (This too is proved by the Princeton copy.) Again, the evidence shows that the imposition was as follows: Further evidence that the forme of a was arranged in the above manner is found by examining the offsets in the University of Michigan coarsepaper copy of the first state. At some stage of printing the inner forme (probably when the sheets were stacked after "drying"), two sheets that were not quite dry were laid down with their wet sides facing each other and end-for-end. The result was a mutual offset of pages d1 r and a3 v , d2 v and d3 r , a1 v and a2 r , and a4 v and a5 r . The only puzzling aspect of the first state of volume I is the separate imposition of Z1. In a book of 26 sheets surely Strahan could have included the printed matter of Z1 if he wished to without resorting to pasting in an extra leaf at the end of the book. Note, however, that by printing even one leaf more than 26 sheets, Strahan charged a rate throughout the printing for 26½ sheets. At a time when labor was cheap and paper was expensive, this was profitable for Strahan. Thus, as mentioned above, on all the copies of the first state Strahan saved three-eighths of a sheet and on the second state one and three-fourths sheets. In the second state of this volume the i A and a gatherings were deleted, d and Z were printed together as a half-sheet, and the revised title and special title (again conjugate) were printed on a quarter-sheet. This manner of printing shows that a simple mistake at the bindery can account for the fact that Wells (cited above) says that he has a copy of the second state that contains the list of subscribers. Both states of volume II contain 26 1/2 sheets, and in each case 2E and the title were printed together as the half-sheet. Both states of volume III contain 27 sheets, and it seems most likely that a, the title, and 2E were printed on one sheet. Each of the three volumes was printed by a different printer; but since the printers were all printing approximately the same number of sheets with the same kinds of paper and type, and since they were probably provided with their copy at the same time, it seems very likely that the chronology of their work was approximately the same. Assuming that the notice in the Daily Advertiser (see above) was correct in stating that the subscription would close on February 22; assuming that no copies were printed until the subscription closed; and knowing that at least two of the volumes were completely printed by the end of March or the beginning of April, it seems that the printers were faced with the task of printing 1250 copies of 26 1/2 or 27 sheets octavo in a period of about five weeks. I believe that they could do this at their normal rate of printing. 16 The printing probably proceeded in this manner: (1) 250 copies of the first state were printed on royal paper; (2) without altering the formes, approximately 350 copies were printed on the smaller sheets of coarse paper; (3) altering the forms of volume I as described above, and changing the title pages on all the volumes, approximately 650 copies of the second state were then printed on coarse paper. 17 Of course, it is another matter to prove that such a procedure was followed. An examination of the royal-paper copy and the coarse-paper copy of each state of a given volume shows that they are invariant so far as the body of the text and the headlines are concerned. (Volume I has no headlines except in the preface.) Any further conjectures concerning the printing, therefore, must be based upon the evidence of the press figures. Both states of volumes I and II lack enough variations in their press figures to enable one to make meaningful deductions. The evidence of the printing sequence, therefore, must be found in volume III. The royal-paper copies of volume III lack four press figures found in all the coarse-paper copies of both states, the figures being added before the coarse-paper copies were printed. Also, only the second state has a press figure in 2E. (Since the title page was changed in the second state, and since it was printed on the forme with 2E, the printer undoubtedly introduced the new figure at that time.) Perhaps it will be argued that the coarse-paper copies may have been printed first and that the press figures fell out before the royal-paper copies were printed. This, however, was not the case. In the royal-paper copies the average bottom margin on a page is 5.5 cm., while in the coarsepaper copies this margin is usually 3.5 cm. Undoubtedly the printers noticed the unusually large margin in the royal-paper copies, and some of them placed their press figures so that they were printed several centimeters below the body of the text. When confronted with the problem of printing these same formes on the smaller sheets of coarse paper, in certain instances it probably seemed necessary or at least advisable to raise the press figures, and this was done. It is inconceivable, of course, to believe that if the coarsepaper copies had been printed first the printers would have bothered to lower the press figures when they printed the larger royal-paper copies. This particular evidence reflects the printing practices only in Bowyer's shop and thus is limited to volume III, the press figures in the other volumes generally being on the level of the catchwords. Admittedly there is no conclusive proof to show that volumes I and II were printed in the same manner, but the available evidence does indicate that the printing probably proceeded in the sequence described above.</field>

One copy contains the list; the other omits it." I have not seen such a copy. 9 I am accepting William B. Todd's definitions of edition , impression , and state . See his "Recurrent Printing," SB , XII (1958), 191. 10 I am grateful to William B. Todd for several comments plus descriptions of the three copies of volume I, first state in the University of Texas Library. 11 Strahan's ledgers show that he did not always engage in such practices — for example, he sometimes listed discounts given for type that was still standing when a second edition was called for. Throughout his career, however, he occasionally reverted to such dishonest proceedings. In 1775, for example, he charged full price for setting the type of the second edition of Johnson's Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland when over twenty per cent of the second-edition sheets had been printed with the first edition. 12 One notable example is Fielding's good friend, Ralph Allen. See Pope's letter to Allen, dated 12 April, 1743: The Correspondence of Alexander Pope , ed. George Sherburn (1956), IV, 452. Probably some of Allen's £20 was spent on royal-paper copies. 13 Miller suggests that Henry Woodfall the elder, who printed the first two editions of Joseph Andrews and the proposals for the Miscellanies , is a likely possibility. 14 K.I.D. Maslen, "Works from the Bowyer Press (1713-65): A Supplement to John Nichols," unpublished B.Litt. thesis (University of Oxford, 1952), p. 104, as cited by Miller, Introduction, p. 8. 15 The Princeton University coarse-paper copy of the first state is loosely bound and its spine is broken in several places. Fortunately, this enabled me to determine the conjugacy of leaves with certainty. 16 When Strahan printed Johnson's Journey in 1775, for example, the normal rate for printing 2000 copies was approximately three sheets per week. (See William B. Todd, "The Printing of Johnson's Journey [1775]," SB , VI [1954], 247-254.) Thus, it does not seem impossible to print slightly better than five sheets per week when making only 1250 copies. 17 William Strahan's printing of Macpherson's Fingal in 1761 is a later example of a single impression of a book being issued as two editions on two sizes of paper. See William B. Todd's note in the Book Collector (Winter, 1959), pp. 429-430.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Rasselas : Purchase Price, Proprietors, and Printings by Gwin J. Kolb</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ledgers of the great eighteenth-century printer-bookseller William Strahan (and of his son Andrew), now happily accessible for scholarly examination, 1 enable a new editor of Rasselas to confirm, extend, and, in one instance, to correct statements about the purchase price, proprietors, and printings of the tale which appear either in the introduction to R. W. Chapman's edition (1927) of the work or in notes to his edition (1952) of Johnson's letters. To begin with, the ledgers seem to confirm Chapman's tentative conclusion regarding the amount Johnson received for the first edition of the tale. Sir John Hawkins, as Chapman said, asserted merely that "the sum . . . is variously reported;'" "Boswell," on the other hand, "states positively that 'Mr. Strahan, Mr. Johnston, and Mr. Dodsley purchased it for a hundred pounds, but afterwards paid him twenty-five pounds more, when it came to a second edition.'" Since "the second half of this statement can be proved to be true, . . . it is unlikely," Chapman concluded, "that the first half is inaccurate." 2 Now Strahan's Ledger J (compiled, apparently, in 1778) contains an alphabetical listing of works in which Strahan owned shares, the amounts of the shares, usually the dates when the shares were acquired, the names of the persons from whom the shares were bought, and the sums paid for each of them. The following entry appears on f. 19 v : "1/3 Rasselas 2 v. D r Johnson 33 6 8." Although the entry is undated, another entry (from Ledger B) cited in the next paragraph of this article shows that, beginning with the first edition, Strahan, Dodsley, and Johnston were equal "partners" in Rasselas . Three times the amount Strahan paid Johnson for his share of the work equals, of course, exactly £100. Thus Chapman's conclusion, based in part 3 on Boswell's information, would appear to be accurate. Secondly, the ledgers make clear the identity of the proprietors of the work. Chapman thought that Strahan "was perhaps the real publisher, [Robert] Dodsley and [William] Johnston being his agents, though only their names appear on the title-page" of the first edition. 4 Actually, however, the three men were equal partners in the work. Their names head a group of entries in Ledger B (f. 33 r ) dated April and June of 1759 which are concerned with Rasselas ; elsewhere, as in the entry above from Ledger J, Strahan recorded his share in the book as one-third; and in 1765, below the caption "Partners in Rasselas" and among other entries about the tale, Strahan wrote: "M r Johnston 1/3," "M r Dodsley [James, not older brother Robert, who had died in 1764] 1/3," and "Myself 1/3" (Ledger B, f. 57 r ). The names of E. Johnston, it may be noted in passing, replaced W. Johnston on the title-page of the fifth edition (1775); and T. Longman replaced E. Johnston on the title-page of the sixth (1783). The title-pages of the seventh (1786), eighth (1790), and ninth (1793) editions contain the names of these persons: J. F. and C. Rivington, J. Dodsley, T. Longman, and G. and T. Wilkie. 5 Thirdly, as R. A. Austen-Leigh's article in the Library in 1923 showed, 6 the ledgers establish the accuracy of Chapman's guess (in 1927) that Strahan "may probably have printed" 7 Rasselas , and they also provide detailed information about the printing of the first eight editions. In an entry dated April, 1759 (Ledger B, f. 33 r ), Strahan recorded the number of sheets (21½) which make up the first edition, the number of copies printed (1500), the cost per sheet (£1:4:0), and the cost (£25:16:0) of the initial printing; he noted, too, "Extra Cor. in D°" which came to £2:4:6. The next entry (Ledger B, f. 33 r ), dated June, 1759, recorded the printing of the "2 d Edit.," which consisted of 1000 copies and which cost "19 s " per sheet (or a total of £20:8:6 for the 21½ sheets). Strahan added the cost of the first two editions and noted that the resulting sum — £48:19:0 — was "Paid in a Note July 31. 1760." 8 The third edition of the tale was printed in December of 1759; 9 the number of sheets, cost per sheet, and number of copies printed were the same as for the second edition. The printing bill was paid, according to the ledgers (B, f. 39 r ), on May 9, 1761. Six years to the month after the printing of the third edition, Strahan recorded, under date of December, 1765 (Ledger B, f. 57 r ), the printing of the fourth, which corresponded exactly to the second and third in number of sheets, cost per sheet, and number of copies printed. The paper for the fourth edition came to 43 reams, at 12 shillings a ream; the cost of the advertisements was £3:15:6. The total bill was an even £50; Johnston's and Dodsley's shares — £16:13:14 each — were marked as paid on "Dec r 17. 1765. By Notes in Four Months." Ten years later, under date of March, 1775, 10 Strahan noted (Ledger D, f. 20 r ), below the heading "Partners in Rasselas," the printing of the fifth edition, in one volume and "13 Sheets." One thousand copies were printed at £1:2:0 per sheet. The bill, £14:6:0, was paid on April 18, 1775. According to the ledgers (E, f. 21 r ; F, 21 r ), the sixth edition, identical in sheets, number, and cost to the fifth, was printed in March, 1783; 11 the bill was paid, by "M r Longman" (Ledger H, f. 42 v ), 12 on June 12 of the same year. The seventh edition of the tale was printed in September, 1786 (Ledger F, f. 78 r ). It cost one shilling more per sheet (£:3:0) than its two immediate predecessors but was identical to them in number of sheets and copies. The bill — £14:19:0 — was paid by "M r Longman" (Ledger H, f. 52 v ) on January 11, 1787. The eighth edition, printed in December, 1789 (Ledger F, f. 104 r ), consisted of the same number of sheets as the seventh. The cost per sheet was £1:10:0, however, and 1500 copies were printed. The bill was paid "in Notes Jan. 28. 1790." An entry in Ledger H, on a page (f. 61 v ) enumerating "Cash Received for Printing" in 1790, reveals that "M r Longman" again paid the printing bill of £19:10:0. A later entry in the same ledger (f. 67 r ) notes the receipt, on July 24, 1793, of another £19:10:0 "From M r Longman for Rasselas "; presumably this amount was payment for the printing of the ninth edition, which appeared in 1793.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Dwight's Triumph of Infidelity : Text and Interpretation by Jack Stillinger</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Inevitably Timothy Dwight's poems will be reprinted, and among them The Triumph of Infidelity , the satirical narrative of 778 lines in which Satan visits America, speaks lengthily on the progress of "infidelity" since the birth of Christ, and then contrives the downfall of all Americans by inspiring the Reverend Charles Chauncy to preach the anti-Calvinist doctrine of universal salvation. The poem was twice published anonymously, "in the world," in 1788. Although the texts of the two editions differ from one another at many points, and although the poem is in current use even to the extent that parts of it are assigned in sophomore surveys, there has been no serious attempt to establish the sequence of these editions or to determine a proper text. On several grounds a tentative case for ordering the editions can be made. At one point, at least, establishing a proper text is important to the interpretation of the poem, which, in any case, has frequently been misunderstood by the critics.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The two 1788 editions of the Triumph are listed in Jacob Blanck's Bibliography of American Literature , II (1957), 520, item 5041, arbitrarily as A and B. 1 In the same order they may be described more fully as follows: A. THE | TRIUMPH | OF | INFIDELITY: | A | POEM. | PRINTED IN THE WORLD, | M,DCC,LXXXVIII. Collation : 8°: a 4 B-E 4 ; 20 leaves, pp. [i]-[iii] iv [5] 6-40. Contents : p. [i], title (verso blank); pp. [iii]-iv, dedication, beginning "[ thick-thin rule ] | To Monſ. de Voltaire."; pp. [5]-40, the poem complete, beginning "[ thick-thin rule ] | THE | TRIUMPH | OF | INFIDELITY. | [ flat-diamond rule ]". Copies examined : Houghton Library; American Antiquarian Society. B. THE | TRIUMPH | OF | INFIDELITY, | A | POEM. | [ flatdiamond rule ] | Printed in the World, | M.DCC.LXXXVIII. Collation : 12°: i 4 A 2 B 4 [C] 2 (signing A1 as "A2"); 12 leaves, pp. [1]-[5] 6-24. Contents : p. [1], title (verso blank); p. [3], dedication, beginning "[ thin-thick rule ] | To Monſ. de VOLTAIRE," (verso blank); pp. [5]-24, the poem complete, beginning "[ line of type ornaments ] | THE | TRIUMPH | OF | INFIDELITY. | [ flat-diamond rule ]". Copies examined : Massachusetts Historical Society; American Antiquarian Society. For each edition the format is in doubt. Neither contains watermarks, and while the vertical chain lines of A suggest an octavo format, one has only the horizontal chain lines and smaller size of B (very roughly two-thirds the size of A) on which to guess duodecimo. For B, Blanck provides "&lt;A&gt; 4 , A2 2 , B 4 , &lt;B2&gt; 2 " — and adds, " Collation in doubt ." My own collation is based on the signing ("A2" on the fifth leaf, "B" on the seventh) and on the evidence of conjugate leaves in an imperfect copy, consisting of the first ten leaves, in the Connecticut Historical Society. After snipping some of the stitching, Mr. Thompson R. Harlow, Director of the Society, was able to report the following leaves conjugate: 1 and 4, 2 and 3; 5 and 6; 7 and 10 (in doubt), 8 and 9. The absence of leaves 11 and 12 (only) suggests that they also were a conjugate pair. The poem has been reprinted twice. 2 A British edition of 1791 follows the text of B, making changes and corrections, and adds Dwight's name for the first time to the title-page. 3 The other reprint, the only recent printing of the poem, is that in Vernon L. Parrington's The Connecticut Wits (1926), pp. 248-272. Parrington (or James E. Ernst, "who is largely responsible for the text" of the anthology) omits lines 159-176, and claims (p. xlix) to have used "the edition of 1797." Undoubtedly he erred in the date, for he prints in quasi-facsimile one of the 1788 titles at the head of the poem, and his text is a modernized version of A. An edition of 1797 is otherwise unknown. Perhaps Parrington's date represents a momentary confusion of the poem with Dwight's two sermons on The Nature, and Danger, of Infidel Philosophy , delivered in September 1797 and published in the following year. Were it known that the two editions of 1788 were issued by the same printer, it would be relatively easy to infer a sequence. The fact that the compositor of A ran out of apostrophes just above the middle of page 23 (where five are missing, and spaces left for them, in five consecutive lines), but received a new supply for the lower half of the page, may suggest that the type of A was distributed immediately after each forme was printed; and the smaller format, compression of text, and poorer quality of paper in B suggest that it is a cheap reprint, possibly set up when, unable to reissue A as more copies were demanded, the printer was called upon for a second edition. But nothing about the ornaments, footnote symbols, methods of paging, signing, dating, and the like can be used to show that the editions came from the same house. One may reasonably infer an authorized manuscript source for one of the editions from the words of an anonymous correspondent to the Hartford American Mercury , 7 April 1803, who, writing in the midst of a newspaper controversy over Dwight's authorship of the poem, asked the editors: "Do you suggest doubts whether Dr. Dwight wrote the Triumph of Infidelity? I know he was the author of it. The man who copied it for the press is not deceased — you may digest these things at your leisure." 4 The correspondent himself may have been "the man who copied it for the press"; at least he had inside information about Dwight's authorization, or he would not have offered for "digestion" the fact of a "copied" text. The usual possibilities that one edition is a straight (uncorrected) reprint of the other, or that both editions derive from the same manuscript, are ruled out by a consideration of the variants between them — more than 350 in all, mainly accidentals, but also a number of substantives (e.g., "the Lord" / "our Lord" 157 n.; "Cherburg's" / "Herbert's" 200 n.; "or" / "and" 296; "blest" / "new" 405; "lie" / "curse" 464 n.; "even him" / "him e'en" 487; "principle" / "scale" 574 n.). 5 Where accidental variants occur, the text of B, from the reader's point of view, is the better version roughly three times out of four; that is, its spelling is preferable, its punctuation is more reasonable (and more often grammatically correct), and it more frequently (and more nearly consistently) uses apocopated forms (e.g., "plung'd" 31, "heav'n" 90) to emphasize its metrical regularity. Where substantives occur, the preference for B is somewhat stronger, and in addition B offers clearer hints to the identities of "blank" names in lines 355 ("* * * * * * *" / "E - - - - - -" for "Edwards"), 381 ("* * * * * * *" / "L - - - - - -" for "Ledyard"), and 734 ("* * * * *" / "S - - - -" for "Smith"). Given such variants, if one edition came from an authorized manuscript, the other can have taken its text only from another manuscript, whether or not also authorized, or, if it is the later edition, from an altered copy of the earlier edition. Since it is unlikely that Dwight would have provided an inferior text for a second edition, we must suppose that B, whatever its source of text, is the later of the two editions. Further evidence may lie in the reasons for suggesting that B was printed from a corrected copy of A. Typographical similarities — the same disposition of words on the title-pages, the use in both editions of the double rule above the heading of the dedicatory epistle to Voltaire, their similarities in title printed at the top of each first page of poetical text (a double rule in one vs. a line of type ornaments in the other; the same disposition of words, followed by flat-diamond rules beneath), their use of italics in lines 345, 573, and 716 — may not in themselves constitute proof that B was printed from a (corrected) copy of A, but one has to suppose a number of coincidences and fairly well detailed manuscript sources to explain them otherwise. More to the point is the fact that while A generally uses asterisks for "blank" names and B generally uses spaced hyphens, they both depart from their systems to print alike "-----" (23 n., for "Christ"), "A---n's" (391 n., for "Allen's"), "C-----'s" (492, for "Chauncy's"), and "J-----n's" (601, for "Johnson's"). The best evidence, however, comes from the variants. There are, first of all, omissions from B of four words that appear in A: "very" (157 n.), "other" (335 n.), " &amp;c. " (411 n.), and "Scriblerus." (671 n.). None is important; but if we apply the general rule that a compositor reprinting an earlier edition may naturally omit words but is not likely to add any, the omissions may suggest, or at least support other evidence, that the printer of B worked from a copy of A rather than from a manuscript. Secondly, there are two uncorrected errors common to both editions: "salute" (402, for the singular verb form "salutes") and "mens" (555, for "men's"). 6 These, like the omissions, may be explainable in other ways, but they are most readily seen, since a number of similar errors in A are corrected in B, as resulting in B from the printer's too faithful following of the text of A. Finally, there are two variants in B that are best explained as new errors resulting from corrections to the text of A. The first is "pow'rs" (44, for the possessive singular form "power's" as in A, or the hypothetical "pow'r's" — since the word is to be read as a single syllable), which clearly came about from the attempt, evident through much of B, to print apocopated forms of two-syllable words pronounced and scanned as one syllable; the possessive ending was lost in the alteration. The second, "were" (278, for "wore"), apparently came about through the misreading (or misprinting) of an alteration of A's "wears" to the past tense. None of the evidence is conclusive, but taken together it allows the assumption that the supposed later edition B was printed from a corrected copy of A; and it follows, then, that A represents the text of the inferred authorized manuscript. There the matter should rest until new evidence turns up. According to the principles of Greg and Bowers, 7 a proper text of the poem should be based on A rather than B, and should incorporate such variants from B as in each case can best be attributed to the author. One of these variants, though a mere matter of typography, is discussed at the end of the next section.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II To those who have read it, The Triumph of Infidelity has been many different things: an attack on Voltaire and Hume, or their influences; an attack on deism and democracy; a general defense of Christianity, or Calvinist orthodoxy; the outpouring of personal abuse. Arthur H. Quinn, The Literature of the American People (1951), pp. 186 f., represents the critics who find a variety of purposes in the poem, which he describes as "a satiric attack in verse upon the divine who does not believe in Hell; the Roman Catholic Church; modern philosophy; the Chinese and other institutions, via Satan, whose praise, of course, condemns them. It is also a defence of . . . Calvinistic theology." Even Leon Howard, who has read the poem more carefully than any of the others, is unsure of Dwight's intention: "There may be some doubt as to whether Dwight originally intended to satirize deism and materialism . . . and turned to heterodox Calvinists only for lack of better material or whether he planned a New Divinity satire from the beginning and wrote the first three-fifths of the poem merely as an introduction" ( The Connecticut Wits [1943], p. 215). One may attempt to resolve the "some doubt." I think the critics have erred in several ways: in their failure to appreciate what humor there is in the poem, in their failure to recognize Dwight's use of a variety of satirical techniques, even in their failure to find the real weaknesses of the poem. But they have erred most often, it seems to me, in the matter of Dwight's purpose. The poem attacks, purely and simply, the liberal "Old Light" theology that Dwight hated, and it suggests, with an indirection that is (in Dwight's plan, if not in his fulfillment) the very essence of satire, the possible consequences of a wide acceptance of such doctrine. From beginning to end the various elements in the poem work toward this single satiric purpose. The poem's application to America is established in the opening lines (1-16), which describe Satan's arrival in this country. The reader will learn, as the poem unfolds, that Satan makes such personal visits only when his cause, "infidelity," is seriously endangered: thus, for example, he had earlier gone to Scotland to write Hume's works and to France to inspire Voltaire (237-306). The specific reason for his American visit appears still later (353-392): Jonathan Edwards is too great an adversary against materialism and deism, and something extraordinary must be done "to plunge the New World in the gulph of sin" (406). The reason for Satan's special desire, however, is implied at the beginning of the poem, in the first description of America (11-14): While, full before him, dress'd in beauteous day, The realms of freedom, peace, and virtue lay; The realms, where heav'n, ere Time's great empire fall, Shall bid new Edens dress this dreary ball. The idea that America was destined to be the scene of "new Edens" of freedom, virtue, and godliness was as old as the first generation of colonists, but no less strong for the "revived Puritan" Dwight in the eighteenth century. To him it was perfectly logical for Satan to consider a victory over America the greatest possible triumph of infidelity. Satan does not act at once, but instead makes a long speech (17-452) on the history of infidelity up to the present day. Dwight included this section for three good reasons. First, he won the immediate sympathy of his reader. In condemning the pre-Reformation Catholics (73-98), the "fashionable" deism of Restoration England (133-182), and Hume and Voltaire (237-306), and in praising the early rise of Christianity (23-50) and the Protestant Reformation (99-132), he voiced sentiments that both the Old and New Divinity adherents could approve. Second, by reviewing the entire history of Christianity, he considerably increased the importance of his own subject, as Leon Howard suggests (p. 215). Satan's battle for the aggregate soul of America is made the supreme test of his power. Finally, the poet established a large background of evil with which he could associate his real object of satire, the Old Divinity men. The parallel that he subsequently draws between Satan's operations in the New World and his previous work in the Old provides the core of the poem's satire. This large parallel can be illustrated by a brief outline of the remainder of the poem. With European infidelity well established, and the American campaign very much in need of a boost, Satan turns to what has been the chief business of his visit ever since the opening of the poem, and hits upon a "glorious project," the "best, / That ever Satan's bright invention blest" (409 f.). His project is the promulgation of the doctrine of universal salvation, and his mouthpiece is the Reverend Charles Chauncy of Boston. Satan ends his speech, effects his plan, and Chauncy proclaims the doctrine (453-470). The project is immediately successful, and Dwight provides a long series of "characters" or satirical portraits, some of real persons, some of types, to show what happens when the fear of an eternal hell is removed (471-638). For a final triumph, Satan has Chauncy deliver a sermon fully expounding the Old Divinity theology (639-734). With this second blast all truth and virtue are defeated, sin and error reign, and even the "decent christian" grows liberal; infidelity has triumphed completely (735-778). Two important points to be observed are these. First, Chauncy has, with Hume and Voltaire, now become one of the three principal agents of Satan. Satan's visit to America, his inspiration of Chauncy, and the results of the new philosophy exactly parallel his operations upon the Scottish and French philosophers. Chauncy's case differs from the earlier infidels' only in that the American victory, more desirable and harder won, is the greatest success of all, just as Chauncy is the greatest of Satan's tools. Second, it should be emphasized that the long series of portraits that follows Chauncy's first announcement of Satan's doctrine are, however abusive, in every instance clearly concerned with illustrating the effects of that announcement. Altogether 620 lines of the poem are related to Chauncy and the American triumph of infidelity, as follows: description or speech of Chauncy, 120 lines; the results of his collaboration with Satan, 234 lines; the European infidels who function for Satan in the same manner as Chauncy, 70 lines; Satan's other forces with whom Chauncy is shown to be allied, 106 lines; the destiny of America and the situation necessitating Satan's personal visit, 90 lines. All but a handful of the remaining 158 lines are concerned with structurally necessary accounts of the early Christians and the European opponents of infidelity. The whole poem, then, can be seen as a series of descriptions and speeches centered on one major event, America's acceptance of infidelity through the efforts of Satan and Chauncy. And since the latter was dead in 1788 (appropriately Dwight designated a time for the poem before the end of the Revolutionary War), the chief target of satire is not the particular man, but what he represented, the theological liberalism that worried Dwight by its growing popularity. 8 Leon Howard (p. 212) believes that the poem was "misnamed in an excess of irony," because Satan "was shown, at the close, fleeing in confusion rather than advancing in triumph." The last six lines (773-778) of the A version read: From a dim cloud, the spirit eyed the scene, Now proud with triumph, and now vex'd with spleen, Mark'd all the throng, beheld them all his own, And to his cause no friend of virtue won: Surpriz'd, enrag'd, he wing'd his sooty flight, And hid beneath the pall of endless night. The point is, however, that infidelity has also triumphed over Satan. From the first of the poem, he has desired "The final victory o'er my struggling foes" (24), and now, with supreme success at hand on the American battlefield, it turns out that he has conquered not a single virtuous man. Confirmed in the Calvinist belief in the depravity of man, Dwight had written a few lines above (761 f.), "The decent christian threw his mask aside, / And smil'd, to see the path of heaven so wide," implying that even the most virtuous are only superficially good, ready to uncover their wickedness at the slightest suggestion. What surprises Satan, then, is that he has been wasting his time, that his "final victory" is, in effect, a pushover, because the enemy has all along been on his side, and there was "no friend of virtue" to conquer (776). Recourse to the second edition for a variant in typography that must be attributed to the author illuminates Dwight's final intention and explains the meaning of his title. To make clearer the reason for Satan's ultimate dismay, to emphasize the hollowness of his victory, the B text prints line 776 thus: "And to his cause no Friend of Virtue won." 9 Admittedly the theological reasoning at this point is a little shaky, but the explanation would seem to be that, for Dwight, the natural susceptibility of men toward sinful behavior made the liberal Old Divinity doctrine all the more dangerous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Blanck prefaces his descriptions by noting, "The sequence has not been established and the order in which they are here presented is wholly arbitrary." 2 The possibility of an early extract should be mentioned. As item 5042 Blanck (II, 520) notices an entry in the "Appendix of Titles Considered but Rejected" of Chester Noyes Greenough's A Bibliography of the Theophrastan Character in English , ed. J. Milton French (1947), p. 276: "The Smooth Divine, 1788" — presumably the passage beginning "There smil'd the smooth Divine, unus'd to wound / The sinner's heart, with hell's alarming sound" (533-564). Blanck suggests that this extract, unseen by Greenough or French, may have been published in a periodical. (More recently, the "smooth Divine" passage has been printed in Norman Foerster's American Poetry and Prose , 3rd ed. [1947], p. 248, and Jay B. Hubbell's American Life in Literature , revised ed. [1949], I, 183.) 3 THE | TRIUMPH | OF | INFIDELITY: | A | POEM. | [ flat-diamond rule ] | SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN BY TIMOTHY DWIGHT, D.D. | OF GREENFIELD IN CONNECTICUT, IN 1788. | [ flat-diamond rule ] | LONDON: | PRINTED FOR J. MATHEWS, No. 18, STRAND. | MDCCXCI. A copy of this 28-page reprint is in the Yale Library. 4 Quoted by Lewis Leary, "The Author of The Triumph of Infidelity," NEQ , XX (1947), 380 f. 5 In parenthetical illustrations, when variants are compared, the reading of A is given before that of B. The designation "n." refers to Dwight's prose note to the line in question. 6 The incorrectness of "mens" is questionable, but "men's" seems to have been in general use for half a century before the Triumph was written. For example, eighteenth-century editions of Pope at the University of Illinois (representing all decades but the first) regularly print "Weighs the Men's wits" ( The Rape of the Lock , V.72) from 1736 on. The B text is otherwise (with one exception) scrupulously correct in its possessive forms; it contains four special instances of possessive plurals ending in s without apostrophes ("others" 531 and 701, "wives" 556, "lords" 612), but, again using Pope as the example ("heroes'," "beaus'," "lovers'," in The Rape , V.115, 116, 118), the s -apostrophe form seems to have appeared generally only in the last quarter of the century. 7 In, respectively, "The Rationale of Copy-Text," SB , III (1950-51), 19-36, and "Current Theories of Copy-Text, with an Illustration from Dryden," MP , XLVIII (1950), 12-20. 8 Chauncy died in 1787. The most important of his late works, which Dwight saw as the ultimate form of Old Divinity Arminianism, were Salvation for All Men Illustrated and Vindicated as a Scripture Doctrine (1782) and The Mystery Hid from Ages . . . or the Salvation of All Men (1784). 9 The typographical peculiarities, as well as the phrase, may have been suggested by Pope's "The First Satire of the Second Book of Horace Imitated," line 121, which in many editions is printed "To Virtue only and her friends, a friend." But I think the reason given above for the change from A to B in line 776 is valid quite apart from considerations of "source."</field>

      <field name="fulltext">William M. Gibson and George Arms, compilers of A Bibliography of William Dean Howells (1948, p. 108), correctly attribute the unsigned review of John Hay's social novel, The Breadwinners , in the Century Magazine , May 1884, to Howells; but they base their assignment merely on Tyler Dennett's passing comment in his biography of Hay that it is "most probably" by Howells. 1 More recently, Clara Marburg Kirk and Rudolf Kirk, reprinting the Century review in their collection of Howells' essays entitled Criticism and Fiction, and Other Essays (1959), observe: Howells [n]ever acknowledge[d] that he wrote the review of The Bread-Winners , signed "W," for the May, 1884, issue of Century . However, the authorship of this early review can hardly be doubted after a consideration of "John Hay in Literature," written for the North American Review , September, 1905, soon after the death of Hay. In this essay Howells looked back over his long friendship with Hay, which had begun twenty-five years before the publication of The Bread-Winners , and referred to their meeting in London while Hay was writing the book. Almost unconsciously, Howells threw light on the anonymity of his earlier review in his later essay (p. 237). Stronger evidence of Howells' authorship is now available. To the evidence provided by Dennett's opinion and the inferences supplied by the Kirks, we can add the following paragraph from an unpublished letter, dated 4 March 1884, Howells to Hay: Congratulate your friend of The Bread Winner for me on the English notices. I'm vexed, however, that the notice I wrote for The Century five wks ago was postponed till April. I should be glad to have got ahead of the British with my good word. The author's letter was capital. 2 In their correspondence at this time Howells maintained the fiction that Hay had not written the controversial novel. Certainly Howells, who had tried unsuccessfully to get Aldrich to take the novel for the Atlantic , knew both the identity of the author and the reason why he thought it necessary to preserve his anonymity. Indeed in an unsigned letter to the November 1883 Century —a second letter appeared in the issue for March 1884—Hay, trying to answer the many criticisms that the novel had called forth, wrote so revealingly that many were able to guess his identity. Perhaps it was Hay's example in these instances which prompted Howells' own prudence in presenting his own "good word" anonymously.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Harold Frederic First by Stanton B. Garner</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his admirable bibliography of Harold Frederic ( Studies in Bibliography , XIII, 1960) Robert H. Woodward invites additions from other Frederic scholars. Although it is difficult to add many items at present to a list as complete as Mr. Woodward's, there are certain items of interest which have escaped his pioneer sorting and culling. For instance, I would add to his list of dissertations two others which contain significant sections treating the Dearborn County novels: Marvin O. Mitchell, A Study of Realistic and Romantic Elements in the Fiction of E. W. Howe, Joseph Kirkland, Hamlin Garland, Harold Frederic, and Frank Norris (1882-1902) (University of North Carolina, 1953), and Thomas F. O'Donnell, The Regional Fiction of Upstate New York (Syracuse University, 1957). In addition, another study of Frederic's fiction has been completed since Mr. Woodward's compilation: Charles B. Hands, Harold Frederic: A Critical Study of the American Works (Notre Dame, 1959) and Harold Frederic , by Thomas F. O'Donnell and Hoyt C. Franchere (Wayne Publishers, Inc., 1961). The one major error in Mr. Woodward's bibliography is the omission of Frederic's first short story. Scholars agree that "The Blakelys of Poplar Place" was his first attempt, and Mr. Woodward supports this contention. While it was the first story to be published in the Utica Observer after Frederic joined the staff of that newspaper, it is actually his second. The first is a bit of juvenilia named "Barbette's Christmas," published in the Utica Observer some time before Frederic joined the paper, while he was working as a proof-reader for the rival Utica Morning Herald . It is the extremely sentimental story of Barbette, an eight year old basket girl who walks the wintry streets of a blustery Alsatian town in the tradition of the Little Match Girl, trying to support her aged grandfather by selling her baskets. The plot is melodramatic, complete with frostbite and villainy, and in the end Barbette is reunited with her wealthy father. In the last paragraph the narrator intrudes with an appeal for Christmas charity toward little children. Although the story has little literary merit, it contains recognizable Frederic characters and themes in embryo, and realistic description of the kind which was later to help make him a leading novelist. I have never encountered any previous mention of the existence of this story. A microfilm copy of the page containing "Barbette's Christmas" may be inspected at the Utica Public Library.

      <field name="heading_text">Hidden Printings in Edith Wharton's The Children by Matthew J. Bruccoli</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Children (1928) is a minor novel in the Edith Wharton canon, but it is an intriguing bibliographical item. Although corroborative details from the publisher's records are incomplete, physical evidence in copies of the book reveals that what has passed for the first printing of The Children actually consists of two printings from duplicate plates; furthermore, both these printings include two states. Subsequent production of the novel introduced more hidden printings. It seems extremely unlikely, though, that there was any attempt by the publisher to mislead the public. Even though the text of the novel is not altered, The Children points a lesson for all who are professionally concerned with books printed from plates: modern printing methods are not to be taken as guaranteeing uniformity in all copies included within a single impression. Moreover, an attempt to differentiate printings cannot be restricted to an examination of the publisher's code or the information supplied on the copyright page. Although in most cases there is no intentional deception, the information too frequently turns out to be erroneous or misleading. In some instances the publisher is simply not interested in the strict accuracy of this information; in other cases the divorce between the editorial office and the printing plant makes the correct facts unavailable. It has been a rule for collectors and cataloguers to differentiate printings of an Appleton book by the numeral in parentheses at the foot of the last page of text. A "(2)", for example, indicates that the book in hand is a second printing. Undoubtedly, collectors have noticed that the first printing is sometimes designated by a roman "(I)" and sometimes by an arabic "(1)"; but since both forms were never reported in the same title, this distinction apparently occasioned no speculation. In The Children , however, both "(I)" and "(1)" occur. 1 Copies with "(1)" also have the statement " First Printing, September, 1928 " on the copyright page—which is contrary to Appleton practice—whereas "(I)" copies lack this legend. 2 When queried, Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc. (the successor firm to D. Appleton &amp; Co.) replied: "The reason for this [the two sets of markings in The Children ] was to distinguish between our copies for trade distribution and those supplied to the Book-of-the-Month Club for their use. We can only assume that the copies with the legend 'First Printing, September, 1928' on the title pages verso were the first copies run off on the original printing, and the balance of the copies were for the Book-of-the-Month Club." 3 This explanation would seem to indicate either a stop-press revision or two printings. On the other hand, neither of these alternatives will satisfactorily account for the variants within the printings. That The Children was a book-club selection suggests the possibility of duplicate plates, which provides the key to the problem. Collation on the Hinman Machine at the University of Virginia reveals that pages 122 and 135 of The Children were reset without textual revision. Both forms of each page appear in "(I)" copies and in "(1)" copies, thus producing four states of the "first printing." Since page 122 was not reset line-for-line, the two forms of the page are readily distinguished. Page 135 was reset line-for-line—although the lengths of short lines 8 and 15 were not kept uniform—but there is a typo in one form of page 135, where "moters" appears for "motors". But it is doubtful that page 135 was reset just to correct "moters", for this correction could have been made with a plate patch. Rather, "moters" appears to be a typo which was introduced when the page was reset for another reason, which is detailed below. The Children was published on 1 September 1928, and on 22 September Appleton advertised in Publishers' Weekly that more than 100,000 copies were in print. The book was a sleeper, and the necessity for producing a large number of copies in some haste plus Book-of-the-Month Club distribution made duplicate plates practicable. The Book-of-the-Month Club at that time purchased copies from the original publisher, rather than leasing plates for separate production, as is its practice now. 4 Although there is an ingenious way to account for the four states of the "first printing" by postulating stop-press revisions of the code number and copyright page in both sets of plates, what follows is a more reasonable explanation. Two sets of plates were prepared at the beginning of production. In one of these sets the copyright page and code number were altered to distinguish the Book-of-the-Month Club copies. From the fact that the "(1)" is tilted and badly printed, it is probable that the "(1)" was mortised in to replace the "(I)", and that " First Printing, September, 1928 " was added to the copyright page of the "(1)" set of plates to make it doubly distinguishable. Both sets of plates were machined at about the same time; but in one set the inner forme of the ninth gathering sustained serious damage or batter in the area of pages 122 and 135 (these are adjacent in standard octavo impositions), necessitating resetting and replating of the two pages. In this resetting the typo "moters" was introduced. That the "(I)" copies were distributed by Appleton and the "(1)" copies by the Book-of-the-Month Club is indicated by the locations of certain copies. Both Library of Congress copyright deposit copies (A 1054115, deposited 6 September 1928) have "(I)", whereas the Book-of-the-Month Club file copy has "(1)". Two inscribed copies in the Yale University Library, dated August 1928 and 14 August 1928, have "(I)"—and it is certain that the author's advance copies would have come from the publisher rather than a book club. The only available printing information in the Appleton-Century-Crofts files clearly supports the theory that there were two separate printings included within the "first printing." ptg #1 ptg #1 14182 14221 6/19/28 30,740 7/23/28 55,000 7/19 Here the five-digit number is the job or order identification number. The foregoing account identifies two printings from duplicate plates, but not the four states that have been noted. These were created when the sheets were bound. Except for the first and last gatherings, no attempt would have been made to segregate the sheets printed from the two sets of plates; consequently the sheets for the ninth gathering (containing pages 122 and 135) were integrated when they came off the presses and were moved to the bindery. This statement is at least partly substantiated by the gutter markings in The Children . Throughout the book the letter "I" or "N" appears in the gutters. These are identification marks inserted by the stonemen or pressmen in the dead areas of the formes so as to print on the spines of the gatherings or deep in the gutters. 5 Most likely, these particular letters are the initials of the men, who for our purposes may be dubbed Isaac on press # 1 and Newton on press # 2. A tabulation of these initials in twelve copies—one of which was cut apart—revealed no discernible pattern, a finding that lends further support to the idea that the sheets were mixed in the bindery. This theory would be neatly substantiated were freak copies with "(I) and " First Printing, September, 1928 " or "(1)" and no legend to turn up. The most curious point about this problem is the fact that although two printings from duplicate plates are clearly indicated, these two printings cannot be isolated—except for the first and last gatherings—because the sheets were scrambled. In any case, the Edith Wharton collector will need all four states of the first two printings. In 1928 it was not the practice of the Book-of-the-Month Club to reorder; it placed just one order for the quantity of a title needed for distribution. 6 Yet Appleton continued to print The Children from both sets of plates. This statement contradicts the printing records: ptg #2 ptg #3 14274 14294 8/23/28 10,000 9/13 15,170 But on the evidence of the variant pages 122 and 135, the copies marked "(2)" include two printings; and there is no other way to account for these variants. The same is true for copies marked "(3)". Moreover, the two sets of plates were shuffled before the "(3)" copies were printed, a procedure that introduced two new combinations of pages 122 and 135—the combination of the "is . . . most" form of 122 with the "motors" form of 135, and the combination of "is . . . sen-" with "moters". The Grosset &amp; Dunlap copies—printed from one set of plates leased from Appleton 7 —were a new impression, although this fact is obscured by the retention of the "(3)" in these copies. 8</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Half-Sheet Imposition of Eight-Leaf Quires in Formes of Thirty-Two and Sixty-Four Pages by Oliver L. Steele</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This note is an attempt to identify some of the physical characteristics that may be used to determine the imposition of modern books printed on sheets at cylinder presses. The characteristics with which I shall be concerned are those of the paper in the separate quires of books — the folds and edges of partially unopened books and the side and bottom edges of partially uncut books. The interpretation made of these characteristics and its application will be illustrated by an analysis of two American impressions of novels by James Branch Cabell. The first American impression of Jurgen (1919) illustrates a common imposition scheme for work-and-turn of eight-leaf quires in formes of thirty-two pages. 1 The significant characteristics of the quires of this book are: (1) the sides of the first and fourth leaves of each quire have smooth machine-cut edges; (2) the sides of the second and third leaves of every quire have rough uneven edges; 2 (3) a comparison of the side edges of the last four leaves of quires shows that the fifth and sixth leaves and the seventh and eighth leaves were once joined in folds at the sides; 3 (4) in the first and every odd-numbered quire the four outer leaves of the quire (leaves 1, 2, 7, 8) are approximately 5 to 8 mm shorter than the inner four leaves, and the bottoms of these outer leaves have smooth machine-cut edges; (5) the bottoms of the four inner leaves of odd-numbered quires have rough edges; 4 (6) in the second and every even-numbered quire the four inner leaves of the quire (leaves 3, 4, 5, 6) are approximately 5 to 8 mm shorter than the four outer leaves, and the bottoms of these inner leaves have smooth machine-cut edges; (7) the bottoms of the four outer leaves of even-numbered quires have rough edges. These characteristics can be explained only by assuming that the sheets were printed by half-sheet imposition of two eight-leaf quires in a forme of thirty-two pages. The folds that joined leaves five and six and leaves seven and eight, together with the four short leaves in each quire, show that the quires were folded and, thus, imposed as normal octavo formes — in this case sub-formes. The smooth side edges of the first and fourth leaves of each quire show that the sides of pages 1 and 8 in the outer forme and of pages 2 and 7 in the inner forme were on the machine-cut edges of the sheet. Similarly, the smooth bottom edges of the outer four leaves in odd-numbered quires show that, in those quires, the bottoms of pages 1, 4, 13, 16 (and those corresponding to them in later quires) in the outer forme and of pages 2, 3, 14, 15 in the inner forme were on the machine-cut edges of the sheet. The smooth bottom edges of the inner four leaves of each evennumbered quire show that, in such quires, pages 21, 24, 25, 28 (and corresponding pages in later quires) in the outer forme and of pages 22, 23, 26, 27 in the inner forme were on the machine-cut edges of the sheet. All of these interpretations may be brought together in the imposition scheme illustrated for a sheet printed work-and-turn in thirty-two pages. 5 The most obvious features of the quires of the first American impression of Jurgen can be explained only by this scheme of imposition. The alternation of short outer leaves with short inner leaves in odd-numbered and even-numbered quires can be explained as the result of printing on sheets too narrow to produce margins in those pages at the long outer edges of the sheet as wide as those established internally by the long cross of the forme. 6 A clear case of half-sheet imposition of quires of eight leaves in sixty-four page formes is the first American impression of Cabell's Gallantry (1907). 7 The significant characteristics of the quires of this book are: (1) the bottom edges of the four outer leaves of each quire are smooth machine-cut; 8 (2) the bottom edges of leaves three and four and of leaves five and six either are or at one time were joined in a fold; (3) the side edges of the first four leaves of the second and of every fourth quire thereafter have smooth machine-cut edges; (4) the side edges of the last four leaves of the second and of every fourth quire thereafter and the side edges of all leaves in other quires have rough uneven edges. The basic unit of the imposition, the eight-page sub-forme, can be deduced from the fold of the quires. Some experimentation with sheets of paper will show that only the following sub-forme will explain that fold. Further, the side edges of the quires of Gallantry show that eight such subformes, the inner and outer formes of four consecutive eight-leaf quires, were imposed together in a sixty-four page forme. 9 These are by no means the only possible imposition schemes for eightleaf quires in modern books; indeed, the possibilities are numerous enough to keep bibliographers busy for a long time. The two schemes described here are, I think, fairly common, and the method of analysis applied may be useful to others who want to attack the problem of imposition in modern books. 10</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The six copies of Jurgen examined are those listed by Matthew J. Bruccoli, James Branch Cabell: A Bibliography (Charlottesville, 1957), pp. 32-33. Another book using this scheme of imposition is Ellen Glasgow's The Wheel of Life , Doubleday, Page, 1906. 2 Exceptions to this rule appear to be the first and seventeenth quires in which the second and third leaves seem to have smooth edges at the sides. I assume that the knife cut cleaner than usual on these quires since no other explanation will account for the other features of the quires. Imposition in formes of 128 pages, which looks like a plausible explanation, is out of the question because it will not even explain the exceptions. The last quire of Jurgen is an exception to all the rules because it is made up of only four leaves; its imposition is not considered in this note. 3 Irregularly spaced indentations along the side edge of leaf five correspond exactly in position to projections along the side edge of leaf six, and vice versa . 4 There are a few exceptions to 5 and 7. The explanation adopted to cover them is stated in note 2. 5 This scheme is described by Theodore L. De Vinne, Book Composition , ed. J. W. Bothwell (1918), pp. 159-160. For evidence that the leading edge of this kind of forme was the long edge, see my "A Note on Half-Sheet Imposition in Nineteenth and Twentieth Century Books," Gutenberg Jahrbuch , forthcoming 1962. 6 Imposition in formes of sixty-four pages could not have produced this alternation. It would, instead, have produced four quires, two of which would have shown no difference in the length of leaves. Imposition in sixteen-page formes could not have produced alternation at all. 7 The seven copies checked are those listed in Bruccoli, pp. 40-41. Another book whose quires were imposed in this scheme is Frank Swinnerton's R. L. Stevenson , George H. Doran, 1923. 8 There are a few exceptions to his rule. Since they cannot be explained as part of a scheme other than the one suggested, they are not considered significant. The initial quire of the book is a four-leaf fold and is, therefore, an exception to all the rules. Its imposition is not considered in this note. 9 It should be noted that the quires cannot be explained as the result of imposing four outer sub-formes together in the same forme and perfecting with the four inner sub-formes in another forme. This would have produced quires 5, 9, 13, etc., with smooth machined edges at the sides of the last four leaves. A book which was printed by this method is Cabell's The King Was in His Counting House , Farrar &amp; Rinehart, 1938. 10 I am indebted to Mr. William Runge of the Rare Book Division of the University of Virginia Library for his helpful suggestions and, also, to Mr. Willis Shell of the William Byrd Press in Richmond, Virginia, for his confirmation of my analysis of Gallantry .</field>
