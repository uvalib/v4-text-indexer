      <field name="heading_text">"The Charge of the Light Brigade": The Creation of a Poem by Edgar Shannon and Christopher Ricks</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To millions of people in the English-speaking world 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' is Alfred Tennyson's most familiar poem. Yet few are aware of the care and craftsmanship, as well as of the exigencies, that led to the creation of this classic. It is a story that has remained ambiguously and incompletely told. His son, Hallam Tennyson, has recorded that an account in The Times of the astonishing action of the Light Cavalry Brigade in the Crimean War inspired Tennyson to write the poem; but there was more than one article in The Times about what has now become that famous charge, and no one heretofore has examined The Times carefully to discern how the poet drew upon it. Furthermore, the text went through some twenty states before it reached its nearly final form. Fortunately, manuscripts, proofs, and letters that have survived in libraries and private hands both in England and the United States make it possible to trace in considerable detail the skill and tact—themselves illuminated by a major temporary lapse—with which the artist perfected his work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I It was on 25 October 1854, in the Battle of Balaclava, that the Light Cavalry Brigade suffered grievous casualties and made itself immortal, and to speak of the Charge of the Light Brigade is already to pay tribute to Alfred Tennyson. On 13 November 1854 a leader in The Times , telling the British public of 'the attack on Balaklava' and 'the terrible form of a splendid self-sacrifice', declared: 'The British soldier will do his duty, even to certain death, and is not paralyzed by feeling that he is the victim of some hideous blunder'. Those last three words moved Tennyson by their substance and their cadence to create the line which his son came to believe had actually figured in The Times : 'Some one had blunder'd' (12). The next day, 14 November, The Times carried both a further leader, on this 'fatal display of courage which all must admire while they lament', and their special correspondent's account for 19-28 October (headed as having 'appeared in our second edition of yesterday', so that Tennyson may have read this too in his copy of the paper for the previous day). William Howard Russell, the first war-correspondent and probably still the greatest, reported vividly and poignantly the Brigade's 'desperate valour'. 'On Dec. 2nd', Hallam Tennyson was to report, 'he wrote "The Charge of the Light Brigade" in a few minutes, after reading the description in the Times in which occurred the phrase "some one had blundered," and this was the origin of the metre of his poem.' 1 This statement gives the impression that Tennyson read the description in The Times on 2 December and wrote the poem forthwith, but his wife, Emily, is no doubt correct in saying that it was composed 'as a recollection of the first report in The Times '. 2 The earliest extant manuscript (MS 1 ), which is in Tennyson's autograph, does not have the opening four lines, beginning 'Half a league, half a league,' or the final stanza. 3 The second manuscript (MS 2 ) is largely in the hand of Emily Tennyson, though the title, some corrections, and the last six lines are in Tennyson's hand, as are the signature 'A. T.' and a footnote about the number of participants in the charge: 'Written after reading the first report of the Times correspondent where only 607 sabres are mentioned as having taken part in the charge'. This manuscript Tennyson and his wife sent to John Forster, the editor of the Examiner , on Wednesday 6 December, with the following letter: Dec. 6/54 My dear Forster If you like to put this into your paper put only A. T at the foot. Six is much better than seven hundred (as I think) metrically so keep it &amp; put the note I have made at the bottom. I have no time to add more. the post just going. only if you do not put it in this week let me know as I may alter it for the next ever yours with our love A Tennyson [ Postscript in Emily Tennyson's hand ] If you think that Stanza crossed out "Half a league, half a league["] would begin the poem better than the present beginning will you put it [in] please? Make it begin "Half a league half a league["]—as a separate stanza if not omit the stanza altogether. 4 Already Tennyson, with that conscience about accuracy which some critics have found ludicrous and some of us find not only personally honourable but the condition for certain kinds of poetic achievement, was perturbed about the discrepancy in numbers among the accounts in The Times . 5 His instruction to Forster, 'put only A. T at the foot', presumably arose from the paradox by which a passionately patriotic poem, of all things, might prove not to be decorous for a Poet Laureate. On the next day, Thursday 7 December, Tennyson posted another manuscript (MS 4 ) to supersede the one of the previous day: 6 Farringford Freshwater I. W. Dec 7/54 My dear Forster You will get this amended copy in time for your paper. If you print it print it exactly as written. I have only retained 'valley of Death' in one instance when the ear has got accustomed to the metre, &amp; whatever other alterations there may be, believe that I have good reasons for them &amp; print as I said exactly what is sent last . There is no objection to your keeping it another week if you have any suggestion to make. You would have been amazed at our notes yesterday. They were written in such a scuffle. A caller came &amp; sat talking in our last 10 minutes before the letters went. Our boy has to run a mile to the P. O. in the village &amp; then the Postman has to walk 5 miles to the post-town &amp; he won't wait for the boy. ever yours A Tennyson [ Postscript in Emily Tennyson's hand ] Alfred has just bid me say he begs you will by no means put the ballad in if you do not think it good. Then the fact of the numbers We do not know what it is Would it be well to add a note &amp; say this *ballad [ interlined ] was written on the computation first made by the Times? Forgive all this trouble we have given you. (TRC) On the same day, 7 December, Forster—who had received the previous day's manuscript—had it set in type for the Examiner , made a few proofreader's marks on a proof (P 1 ) to correct the compositor's errors, and sent the proof to Tennyson. This and MS 4 crossed in the mail. Another proof (P 2 ) having been pulled from the same type as P 1 , Forster at first made on P 2 the same few marks as he had made on P 1 , and then on Friday 8 December (after receiving Tennyson's letter of 7 December, with MS 4 ), he corrected P 2 to conform to MS 4 , presumably giving instructions by word of mouth to abolish the indenting of lines, since such instructions do not appear on the proof. On the morning of Saturday 9 December, Forster had the next proof (P 3 ) before him in its clean, uncorrected state. In the meantime, Tennyson had received P 1 , had deleted 'No man was there afraid' (between what were to become lines 53 and 54 of the final authoritative text), had made two other substantive corrections, and had returned this proof with his letter of 8 (misdated 9) December: Freshwater I. W. Friday ['Nov' deleted ] Dec. 9 h /54 My dear F. On receiving the printed ballad I wished that my 'order' (my last) had been 'blundered' &amp; that the first edition had stood—never mind—I have corrected Flash'd all their Flash'd all at once— wh you can adopt if you have Time, &amp; if you approve it. I send back the proof but I should like it back again. ever yours affecly A Tennyson (TRC) When this letter arrived on Saturday morning, Forster revised P 3 to return to the text of P 1 as corrected by Tennyson, including making markings for re-indenting thirteen lines of the poem. The compositor accomplished all the changes in time for the printing of the Examiner that day, 9 December. Forster returned P 3 to Tennyson and apparently sent a clean proof (which has not survived and presumably was identical with the text in the Examiner ) from the finally corrected type. Forster's letter of 9 December reflects a justified pride: 58 Lincolns Inn Fields 9 th Dec r 1854 My dear Alfred Tennyson That you may see how determined I was to carry out your order without a blunder—though I may say I disapproved of its suggestions, which, if you had persisted in them, I would not have said—I enclose you the proof which was before me this morning when your letter arrived. But by a sharp effort there was time to try back again—and here you see it is done. I am particularly glad that Mrs. Tennyson thinks with you, with all of us, the original version the best. 7 I will send her a dozen slips of the ballad printed on good paper either on Tuesday or Wednesday next. (It is not until one of those days that the types are 'released' from the forms of the paper, &amp; available for separate working). By tonight's post I send you two Examiners . How I value this noble ballad, I need not say—how proud I am to print it first, and that my old friend sent it to me, I must say. I hear little of you, but again &amp; again I think of you, &amp; never have I done it so often as of late—never, with a throbbing heart, have read of those fights of heroes at Alma, Balaklava, and Inkermann, that I have not been eager for you to celebrate them—the only man that can do it up to their own pitch—the only 'muse of fire' now left to us that can of right ascend to the level of such deeds. —And now you have done it—have at any rate begun! 8 . . . (Yale) No sooner had Tennyson received his copies of the Examiner than he began tinkering with 'The Charge'; for a short manuscript (MS 5 ) survives, consisting of nine lines (represented by final lines 32-38), in which he rewrote three lines of the Examiner text and added four new lines to the poem. These alterations Emily Tennyson dutifully copied onto a copy of the Examiner (E 1 ); and they were conveyed to Forster in time for him to incorporate them in the text of the slips that he printed from the Examiner type after the forms were unlocked. Three of these duplicate slips (P 4 , P 5 , and P 6 ) are extant; one is clean, the second has several autograph revisions, and the third has extensive trial and rejected autograph emendations as well as others—in both the poet's and his wife's hand—that entered and remained in the text. The next phase of the poem's story, which is embodied in a further proof (P 7 ) and culminates in Tennyson's publishing an enfeebled version of the poem in Maud, and Other Poems (1855), may well have begun with a visit to Farringford of the American poet, Frederick Goddard Tuckerman, 12-15 January 1855. It has often been said that Tuckerman should be credited, or rather discredited, with Tennyson's weakening of the poem, especially as to the deletion of 'Some one had blunder'd'. 9 But Tuckerman's letter to Tennyson of 22 February 1855, soon after returning to the United States, clarifies his role: One incident of my voyage which interested me greatly I must however recount. Do you remember my quoting some lines one evening from a newspaper and objecting to the rhymes "blunder'd" and ["]Hundred", thinking it should read "blund e r e d"? I had then seen exactly three lines, and knew nothing of the connexion. Judge then of my surprise at discovering the whole poem in an American paper, with your name attached. I read it with a mixture of astonishment and delight and think it a most noble performance, the finest irregular Ode ever written upon the grandest subject. The repetitions too are wonderfully effective and I cannot help hoping that this poem will not receive any alterations. (Of course I refer to your general habit of retouching your poems and not to any remarks of mine). (Harvard) That Tuckerman had not known that the three lines were Tennyson's when deploring them to their author has its tang. But what is more important, Tuckerman's reverting to the poem does amount to a retraction. For he now 'cannot help hoping that this poem will not receive any alterations', and the parenthetical courtesy which follows is a diffident disclaimer along the lines of 'Not of course that anything I said. . .'. Such courtesies often lend a cryptic tone to such exchanges, but a straightforward reading of Tuckerman's letter (unbiased by the tradition of blaming him) would suggest that, though Tuckerman had indeed (the previous month) expressed disapproval of the rhyme in those three lines, he was now—on reflection, and knowing the whole poem and its authorship—moved to oppose (studiedly, politely) what he knew would be Tennyson's intention to re-write. Feeling some responsibility for Tennyson's having become dissatisfied with the lines, Tuckerman does not want anything that he had said (based on inadequate knowledge of the poem) to be a contributing or reinforcing factor in any drive towards revision. But the Laureate did not heed Tuckerman's restraining plea—though a later letter to Tuckerman makes clear that Tennyson remembered it and came to wish that he had (see below, p. 10). He had a propensity to be discomposed by criticisms, and others had seconded Tuckerman's initial unease. When Tennyson collected the poem, under his full name now, in the Maud volume (published by Edward Moxon five months later, 28 July), not only was the final stanza re-written, but the eight lines which included the repeated 'Some one had blunder'd' were gone. Tennyson had arranged for Moxon to send Tuckerman an advance copy of the book, and wrote him (?8 July 1855): "You will find in my little volume 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' with the 'blunder'd' that offended you and others, omitted. It is not a poem on which I pique myself but I cannot help fancying that, such as it is, I have improved it" (Harvard). Tennyson might more justly have spoken of 'the "blunder'd" that [had once] offended you'. And the turn of Tennyson's subsequent words—'but I cannot help fancying that [ our italics ], such as it is, I have improved it'—while acknowledging what might be felt on the other side, is itself an echo of the phraseology in which Tuckerman had expressed his resistance to Tennyson's predilection to revise: 'and I cannot help hoping that [ our italics ] this poem will not receive any alterations'. Not piquing himself on the poem, the author, soon after he received copies of Maud, and Other Poems marked a copy (Historical Collation, 55a) in a way that manifests a decision (temporary, as it proved) to drop 'The Charge', by drawing a vertical line through each stanza of it. That he did so shortly after receiving copies is clear from his changing in this copy a colon to a semicolon — a correction sent by Emily Tennyson in a letter to Moxon on 1 August (Harvard); for, once Tennyson learnt of the Crimean soldiers' enthusiasm for the poem, he would not have contemplated dropping it. Early in August 1855 began the ensuing phase of the development of the text, in which Tennyson promptly acknowledged that the poem should never have received the alterations in the Maud volume. On 6 August, acting upon an animating letter from Benedict Lawrence Chapman on 3 August, 10 Tennyson wrote to Forster and, it would seem, enclosed an autograph manuscript (MS 6 ) that is essentially a fair copy of the third duplicate slip printed from the Examiner type (P 6 ): My friend Chapman of 3 Stone Buildings, Lincoln's Inn writes to me thus: 'An acquaintance of mine in the department of the S. P. G. as he calls it—Society for the Propagation of the Gospel—was saying how a chaplain in the Crimea sent by the Society writes to the Society (neither he nor the Society being suspected of any Tennysonian prejudices) " the * greatest service you can do just now is to send out on printed slips Mr A. T's Charge at Balaclava. It is the greatest favourite of the soldiers—half are singing it &amp; all want to have on black &amp; white—so as to read ['it' deleted ]—what has so taken them" Now my dear Forster you see I cannot possibly be deaf to such an appeal. I wish to send out about 1000 slips; but I don't at all want the S. P. G. or any one else to send out the version last printed : it would, I believe, quite disappoint the soldiers. don't you live quite close to the S. P. G.? Could you not send Henry over to say that I am sending over the soldier's version of my ballad &amp; beg them not to stir in the matter? The soldiers are the best critics in what pleases them. I send you a copy wh retains 'the light Brigade' &amp; the 'blunder'd' &amp; I declare I believe it is the best of the two &amp; that the criticism of two or three London friends (not yours) induced me to spoil it. 11 For Heaven's sake get this copy fairly printed at once at once [ sic ]—&amp; sent out. I have sent it by this post likewise to Moxon but you are closer to your printer's. concoct with him how it is all to be managed; I am so sorry that I was not in town to have done it at once. I have written a little note to the soldiers which need not be sent — just as you like — it might be merely printed from A. Tennyson. Please see to all this: &amp; see that there are no mistakes ; &amp; I will be bound to you for evermore, &amp; more than ever — Yours in great haste A Tennyson * thus underscored in the original P.S. I am convinced * now after writing it out [ interlined ] that this is the best version. I have told Moxon to call on you—(TRC) At the same time, Tennyson sent to Moxon another fair copy, this one in his wife's hand, on which he had made two small corrections (MS 7 ). The next proof (P 8 ) was set from this manuscript, and both it and the quarto broadsheet that went to the Crimea (Historical Collation, C) were struck from Moxon's printers' (Bradbury and Evans) type and not from Forster's for the Examiner . The 'little note to the soldiers', after minor revisions (see Historical Collation), finally read on the Crimea broadsheet: Having heard that the brave soldiers before Sebastopol, whom I am proud to call my countrymen, have a liking for my Ballad on the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava, I have ordered a thousand copies of it to be printed for them. No writing of mine can add to the glory they have acquired in the Crimea; but if what I have heard be true, they will not be displeased to receive these copies of the Ballad from me, and to know that those who sit at home love and honour them. ALFRED TENNYSON. 8 th August , 1855. All of this asked for tact; on the sheet which has a draft of this message, Emily Tennyson noted: 'It would be pleasant to write to the soldiers only one is afraid it looks too regal to do so—' (TRC). On 7 August, Chapman wrote to Emily Tennyson: It will be but civil to acknowledge your two notes, though I have nothing to say that Moxon will not have said better than I can say it.—It was quite right to have the Newspaper version—or as near as may be—We were very much afraid that the 'blundered' would have been omitted in your copy—Moxon called on me today on the way to the printers. He seemed quite to go with the spirit of the thing and take it up quite hearty—would see that everything is done by Thursday. He is to send it to the SPG, and the SPG would send it on—why not 2000 says the sanguine and sanguinary Moxon? It is very kind of you and Mr A T to take so much trouble about these low fellows. (Yale) The next day, wishing no time to be lost, Tennyson spurred Forster on: Moxon reports that you are out but I suppose the duties of your Examinership have recalled you to town before this. I write to tell you that I think the letter should not go along with the Poem: let that be despatched by itself. In case the letter be already printed on the same slip as the Poem then of course it had better go as time I think would be lost in rearranging the printed ['types' deleted ] form; &amp; my desire is that the soldiers should have it as soon as possible. (TRC) On the same date, he prodded Moxon: Chapman reports that you said 'why not 2000 slips?' another 1000 * or more [ interlined ] let be sent afterwards if the Secretary thinks they are wanted: they might be sent now if the printing another 1000 did not delay the sending of the first; but I am anxious that the soldiers should have it at once. (Mr. Richard Garnett) Gerald Massey had written a favourable critique of Maud, and Other Poems in the Edinburgh News and Literary Chronicle on 28 July 1855, 12 and had sent a copy of it to the poet. In it Massey had applauded one of the revisions of 'The Charge' in the new volume and had deplored another: The present version omits the "Down came an order which some one had blundered," which we are glad of, as it was neither true nor poetical. But we miss the last lines— "Oh, the wild charge they made! Honour the Light Brigade! Noble six hundred!" which, we submit to Mr. Tennyson's consideration, is a fine and necessary conclusion. 13 On 11 August, Tennyson wrote to Massey and enclosed the latest text: Many thanks for the Critique in the Edinburgh paper which I suppose you sent me. . . . I trust that you got a copy of a Maud which I sent you, inscribed. I believe you are quite right as to the conclusion of the Charge. I send you a copy of that version of it which I have just transmitted to the Crimea. . . . The Chaplain of the Society wrote * to the Soc y [ interlined ], ' You can do no greater service just now than to send out copies of the Charge on slips for the army to sing. Who could resist such an appeal? This is the soldier's version &amp; I dare say they are the best critics. (Johns Hopkins) A letter from Charles Edward Hadow, Off. Chaplain to the Forces in the Crimea (received 14 October), 14 duly expressed fervid thanks, and gratefully accepted Tennyson's offer of a further 1000 copies. Tennyson did not forget Tuckerman; on 17 October, Emily Tennyson wrote to him: I enclose you the soldier's copy of 'The Charge.' I think you will like to hear two thousand of it have been printed for my husband and sent out by him to our Army in the East because the senior chaplain wrote that half the men were singing it and all wished to possess what they so much admired. (Harvard) To his own part of this letter, Tennyson added a postscript: 'You are quite right about the Charge. I was overpersuaded to spoil it'. The Laureate was now in no doubt about the damage that the revisions for the Maud volume had done to the poem and about the validity of his rectification. He used the same turn of phrase in a letter to William Johnson Fox, 25 October: 'The Charge I was overpersuaded to spoil. I send you a copy of that which I sent to the Crimean army at the soldiers' own request' (Harvard). Ruskin wrote Tennyson on 12 November, acutely lamenting the most important of the misguided revisions: 'I am very sorry you put the "some one had blundered" out of the "Light Brigade." It was precisely the most tragical line in the poem. It is as true to its history as essential to its tragedy.' 15 But by this time three months had elapsed since Tennyson had reinstated the line, though now with the value of a single instead of a double instance. The text of the proof (P 9 ) for the second edition of Maud, and Other Poems , like that of the second edition itself (1856), 16 corroborates Tennyson's satisfaction with the state to which he had now brought the poem, for they both in all instances (substantives and accidentals) follow the quarto broadsheet. After 1856, there were six changes in accidentals, and the final text (as in the Eversley edition) was reached in the single volume Works (Crown edition) published by C. Kegan Paul in 1878. Four occurred in this 1878 edition, one in Volume III of the Imperial Library edition, 1872, and one in the eighth edition of Maud , 1862.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington was characterized by a resolute abstention from naming. 17 Nowhere in this tribute to the Duke of Wellington, other than in the title, did his name appear. 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' practises a similar abstention, and for a further reason: as well as wishing to praise truly, it truly wishes not to blame. Hence Tennyson's matured change of mind as to the one personal name which he had made figure in the poem as first published. For the Examiner had had the lines: 'Forward, the Light Brigade! 'Take the guns,' Nolan said: [5-6] 18 Clearly the Laureate had written these lines under the immediate influence of The Times , which not only had picked out but had picked upon Captain Lewis Edward Nolan, the flamboyant member of Lord Raglan's staff who delivered the Commander-in-Chief's order to Lord Lucan (the Commander of the division composed of the Light and Heavy Cavalry Brigades), and who was the first officer to die in the charge. The leader of 14 November had referred to Nolan as having recently 'published his opinion that cavalry could do everything in war, storm any battery, break any square, whether supported or not'; 19 and Russell's dispatch in The Times , 14 November (for the dates October 19-28) had twice referred to 'Captain Nolan' and had given an extended account of his 'excellent work, published a year ago, . . . [in which] he entertained the most exalted opinions respecting the capabilities of the English horse soldier. Properly led, the British Hussar and Dragoon could in his mind break square, take batteries, ride over columns of infantry'. According to Russell, when Lord Lucan, upon receiving a written order from Captain Nolan, asked, '"Where are we to advance to?" Captain Nolan pointed with his finger to the line of the Russians, and said, "There are the enemy, 20 and there are the guns, sir, before them; it is your duty to take them, or words to that effect, according to the statements made since his death'. But Tennyson came to realize that to name one name was to risk a descent into that world which his poem was to rise above—the world of wrangling, recrimination, and indignation. Tennyson, like any good citizen, had no difficulty, though much pain, in compacting admiration at the soldiers' courage with indignation at military incompetence: 'I can sympathize with your genius', he wrote to a correspondent whose identity is now unknown, 'but not at this hour with any song of triumph when my heart almost bursts with indignation at the accursed mismanagement of our noble little army, that flower of men.' 21 But as the author of this poem, he believed that indignation would demean admiration. The poem, after all, names no individual for praise. 22 It never even names the place where the charge happened, as if attention were not to be diverted for even a moment from the courage contemplated, so that the site stands starkly and darkly as what The Times (leader, 13 November) called it—'that valley of death'. But Tennyson's substituting the definite article particularizes the place, and his capitalizing of 'death' into 'Death' at once personifies it and makes it monstrously, mechanically, abstract. 23 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' does name the foe—'Cossack and Russian' (34) 24 —partly because for once the foe was not England's traditional national enemy, France; although France was a threat in the 1850's, as Tennyson's patriotic poems insist, in the Crimea it came about that France was England's ally. To name only 'Cossack and Russian'—and once only—was to bring home that the poem is so entirely English as never to need to name its allegiance; its very language, the English language, is enough to establish its proud patriotic vantage-point. These refusals to name give a special salience to that name—not that of an individual or a place or a nation—which does ring through the poem: the Light Brigade. 25 This form, the Light Brigade, is much more compact, more light (as well as more rhythmically amenable), than the full name 'the Light Cavalry Brigade' used all but once in The Times . Tennyson in his title announces the streamlined name. It is urged forward in stanza I, 'Forward, the Light Brigade!' (4), and then is reconsidered, in exactly those same words, with a contrasting movement in stanza II, where 'Forward, the Light Brigade!' (9) 26 is now to be heard differently, poised with something of a backward look (ruminative, echoing and awed) in contemplation of the command that has just been heard. Only in the last but one line of the poem does the name return: 'Honour the Light Brigade' (54). The earliest manuscript had no title for the poem. The Times never once referred to the military action as 'the charge of the Light Brigade,' though the leader on 14 November spoke of 'its charge'. The verb the newspaper did use powerfully, writing of 'the whole brigade' that 'It charged batteries, took guns, sabred the gunners, and charged the Russian cavalry beyond' (leader, 13 November); and Russell described eye-witnesses as thinking: 'Surely that handful of men are not going to charge an army in position?' Tennyson's title—in advance and conclusively—sums up the poem even while standing slightly and duly apart from it, since 'Charge' is in stanza I an imperative—'Charge for the guns!' (6) 27 —and appears in stanza IV as a participle—'Charging an army . . .' (30) (Tennyson adapts those words of Russell's in The Times just quoted). Only in the last stanza of the poem does 'charge' become the noun for which we have been waiting ever since the title, a noun that is gravely and wonderingly repeated as its qualifying adjective falls away: O the wild charge they made! All the world wonder'd. Honour the charge they made! (51-53) The earliest manuscript (MS 1 ), in not having the final stanza, lacks such a destination, and one of the misjudgements that Tennyson made (P 7 , Maud volume)—before reverting to the Examiner's conclusion—was to annul the climactic rightness of 'the charge' by replacing the six lines of the last stanza with four that did not speak of the charge at all. Tennyson's revisions excised rank as well as name, since there too the divisive world of recrimination might take over. His strong silent emphasis was to be upon the commonalty of courage, not upon rank. Hence his not resting content with the line '"Charge," was the captain's cry' [5-6] (P 7 , 55), itself revised from '. . . the leader's cry' (P 7 ); for in such a military action there was some question as to who could fairly be described as the 'leader'—Nolan delivered the order and spoke peremptorily when Lord Lucan questioned it, the latter ordered Lord Cardigan to execute the charge, and Cardigan, as the commander of the Brigade, led it. 28 The word 'captain' would have pointed not only to Captain Nolan but also to explicit considerations of rank. Tennyson's final choice (MS 6 ): 'Forward the Light Brigade! Charge for the guns!' he said: (5-6) —leaves the 'he' wisely unspecified. The effect in this opening stanza then is both like and unlike the unnamed 'he' in the opening line of 'The Lotos-Eaters': '"Courage!" he said, and pointed toward the land'. For the 'he' of 'The Lotos-Eaters' must be known to be Ulysses, the famous man who commands the whole poem, whereas the 'he' of 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' does not—in a poem which is very different from the newspaper reports that precipitated it—invite identification. Of course this utterance is an order; but Tennyson came not to want the word 'order' itself explicitly in his poem. He preferred to establish the authority of such a military order by having the only words of direct speech in the poem—and this he understood from the outset, since no variants furnish any other instances of direct speech—be this one imperative moment of the direct words of command, '"Forward, the Light Brigade! | Charge for the guns!"'; a moment which is then weighed deeply, heard again not just said again, at the start of stanza II ('"Forward, the Light Brigade!"'); and which is then finally echoed in what, though it is not at all the same kind of direct speech, is directly and imperatively speech from the poem's own commanding authority at the very end: Honour the charge they made! Honour the Light Brigade, Noble six hundred! (53-55) Tennyson's temporary decision to alter the opening of stanza II to read, not '"Forward the Light Brigade!"', but 'Honour the Light Brigade!' (MS 3-4 , P 2-3 ), was doubly wrong: it removed that exact repetition, from stanza I, which gravely paused in contemplation of what the command was to mean, and it prematurely anticipated the act of honouring, instead of having it be truly won (in the military action and in the poem's progress) and therefore truly conclusive, proudly there as a parallel to, not as a repetition of, the opening command. The only exclamation-marks in the poem, even as it records such an astonishing feat of courage, are those at the beginning and end: the command to the soldiers, and then the vocative—'O the wild charge they made!' (51)—followed by the command to the patriot-reader to honour these soldiers who obeyed such a command. Tennyson's revisions were a submission to the discipline that would so position and so limit the exclamatory. There had not always been exclamation-marks for the initial commands, and there had been in 1855 (P 7 , 55) the reduction at the end of the poem to the one, '"Honour the brave and bold!"' [50]. On the other hand, there had been (MS 4 , P 2-3 ) a strident exclamation-mark at line 12: Not tho' the soldier knew Some one had blunder'd! —instead of the flat stoicism, grimly transitional, of the colon after 'blunder'd' (MS 1-3 , P 2-3 ). Likewise with the brief ill-judged use of an exclamation-mark in line 38 (MS 4 ): Then they rode back, but not Not the six hundred! instead of the chastened finality of the full stop. The noun 'order' worked against unquestioned authority, and Tennyson revised away (P 6 ) the two lines of 1854: For up came an order which Some one had blunder'd. [4/5(3)-(4)] so that there remained only the two lines which in the next stanza had paralleled them: Not tho' the soldier knew Some one had blunder'd: (11-12) He did so because 'order' was gratuitous, as well as because of the inappropriate innovation of the construction, to blunder an order. The sense was clear, but the idiom strange, such as to draw attention to itself. The word 'soldier' too, could then gain perfect introduction; it does not disguise the necessity for command, since the soldier's contrastive 'Some one' is clearly a superior officer, but the word 'soldier' does unify the Brigade, since although a soldier is not necessarily an officer, an officer is necessarily a soldier. The original leader in The Times (13 November) glimpsed the truth of this when it said, in the sentence that spurred Tennyson into writing the poem, 'The British soldier will do his duty, even to certain death, and is not paralyzed by feeling that he is the victim of some hideous blunder'. (Neither 'victim' nor 'hideous' could figure in Tennyson's stoical uncensorious poem.) But elsewhere in the leader in The Times , a divisive turn of phrase occurs: 'when officer and soldier felt themselves hurried to their doom by some inextricable error, they still kept their ranks . . .', where 'officer and soldier' sound as if they are keeping their ranks in an unintended caste sense. The fact that 'Nolan' became 'he' is a reminder that, in a poem which does not name, pronouns will take command. 'He' sets in motion the Charge of the Light Brigade—both in the war and in the poem; thereafter the third-person singular disappears within what is overwhelmingly—indeed, exclusively in its pronouns—a third-person plural poem. The movement is from the 'he' of stanza I; to the 'Their's . . . Their's . . . Their's' of stanza II; 29 likewise on to stanza III ('them . . . them . . . them . . . they'), and to IV ('their . . . they . . . they . . . they'); then to stanza V, which is a crescendo, not only as mustering more ('them . . . them . . . them . . . They . . . them') but also—uniquely in this very They poem—as granting the word the simple headship of the line: 'They that had fought so well'; 30 and so to the last stanza ('their . . . they . . . they'). Nothing is here for the other pronouns: not merely no 'he' again, but never a 'she' or 'you' or 'I' or 'we'. The feeling of awe at indeflectible courage, of which we the onlookers (distant in place but not in spirit) can be proud but which is not ours, is created by this pronominal single-mindedness, a counterpart to the singlemindedness by which six hundred acted as one man at the command of one man. Tennyson did not himself achieve this result at one stroke. He introduced 'as they turn'd' for 'all at once' in 'Flash'd as they turn'd in air' (28) as late as MS 6 and MS 7 ; and three wordings, which were at odds with what became his pronominal discipline, he changed. '"Take you the guns"' [6] (MS 1 ) was unfortunate in that it could sound as if it were exempting the speaker from the military action; 31 and Tennyson also thought better of his two ventures into the first-person plural. The 'our' of his revision of the end of the poem for the Maud volume [50-55] ('Yea, when our babes are old'), is weak, and offers no sufficient compensation for breaching the poem's dignity of they , as well as having a certain clumsiness: 'Yea, when our babes are old— | How they rode onward'. They, the Light Brigade, not they the babes; and anyway, 'when our babes are old' has its own further awkwardness; when they are old, they are no longer babes, though one knows what he means. Tennyson's superseded choice (P 7 ), 'sons' ('Yea, when our sons are old'), had the advantage of avoiding this difficulty of 'babes', but only at the expense of compounding the misleading assimilation with 'they'. 'Yea', too, is falsely archaizing, unlike the enduring exclamation to which Tennyson reverted in this final stanza: 'O the wild charge they made!' (50). The other instance of the first-person plural was the more central of the two and, if retained, would have been very damaging. It was the spectatorial 'We' which Tennyson for some time (MS 1-4 , P 1-3 ) thought of employing in lines 27-28: We saw their sabres bare Flash all at once in air, For one great virtue of the poem, its so combining the immediacy of an eye-witness with the respectful distance of the acknowledged non-combatant, was imperilled by any such 'We', stationed in observation. It was this respectful distance, this essential modesty and admission, which Tennyson judged so well, too, in the concluding words of the message he affixed to the version he sent the soldiers in the Crimea: 'but if what I have heard be true they will not be displeased to receive these copies of the Ballad from me, and to know that those who sit at home love and honour them'. The 'we' and 'our' of Russell's dispatch to The Times (the wording of which pricked Tennyson into his temporary 'We') were quite a different matter, since Russell, though not a combatant, was a participant—he was indeed there in the midst of it all and could honourably permit himself not only 'we' but 'I': 'Through the clouds of smoke we could see their sabres flashing as they rode up to the guns and dashed between them, cutting down the gunners as they stood. We saw them riding through the guns, as I have said; to our delight we saw them returning . . .'. 32 Russell's 'we' was already being turned into something very different (in a way that boded ill for Tennyson's 'We') when it ripened into the editorial 'We' of the leader in The Times : 'We now know the details of the attack on Balaklava. . . . Such a spectacle was never seen before, and we trust will never be repeated'. 'Never be repeated': never in action; yet the most important feature of the poem, so much so as then to constitute not only a feature but its animating principle, is the necessity for things ever to be repeated in words. 'The repetitions too', Tuckerman had written, 'are wonderfully effective'. The Light Brigade charged forward; it charged back. But this both was and was not a repetition; for six hundred charged forward, and those who charged back were 'not | Not the six hundred'. Repetition is insistent and yet not mechanical (any more than military discipline is mechanical); stanza V, as the Brigade sweeps back, is a transposition, not a straight or straightforward repetition of stanza III in which the Brigade had swept forward. Even the identical lines 'Cannon to right of them, | Cannon to left of them' are not precisely identical of reference when they return; they are transposed, as is manifest in the varying line which immediately follows them: 'Cannon in front of them' has to turn as 'Cannon behind them'. The final text instantly creates this strong repetition which is at one with the discomposing of any simple repetition. 'Half a league, half a league': is this a repetition or an advance? And when the next line rides onward, 'Half a league onward', both the repetition and the advance are consolidated. Three halves, or one half that is pounded over? One and a half? (Half a league is one and a half miles.) The historical fact, in the words of The Times (leader, 13 November), is that 'the whole brigade advanced at a trot for more than a mile'. But 'half a league' is more than a poetical (albeit accurate) way of saying 'more than a mile', since it allows the poem to set before us from the very start the sense of 'Half', just as the Charge forward was only half the story. Tennyson had not immediately sensed this true prophetic immediacy of opening; his earliest manuscript (MS 1 ) does not have these first four lines. Then he vacillated. They first appeared as a separate stanza seventeen lines into the poem (MS 2-3 ), 33 are deleted there and transposed to the beginning (MS 2 ), are then re-inserted as a separate stanza back where they first were (MS 4 , P 2 ), once more become a stanza at the beginning (P 1,3 , E, E 1 , P 4-6 ), and eventually stand, after the lapse with the Maud volume (P 7 , 55), as the opening lines of an eight-line stanza initiating the poem (MS 6 —). Here they at once constitute a movement resolutely self-contained (since lines 2 and 4 erect the recurrent rhyme of the poem on 'hundred', which occurs seven times throughout and concludes each of the six stanzas in the final text) and yet perfectly continue the stanza of which they are a part, since the impetus is maintained and since 'hundred' itself is reiterated in the last line of the first stanza. Tennyson contemplated a recurrence of the opening words, later in the poem, as 'Half a league back' [37] (MS 5 —P 6 ) or 'Half a league back again', [47/48] (P 6 —55), but this would have had an air of succumbing to dulled banality in comparison with the recollected hoofbeats of the poem's decisive and immediate advance. The strength, the total dedication, of 'All' at the head of line 3 constitutes another of the poem's repeated energies. From 'All in the valley of Death' (changed from 'Into the . . .' in MS 3 ), it drives forward, through line 31, 'All the world wonder'd' (a line repeated and re-affirmed, with a different timbre, as line 52 34 —though absent from the blundering revision there in 1855), and to the pathos of line 48, 'All that was left of them'. The valley of Death then looms through and through the opening stanza to conclude both line 3 and line 7 ('through and through that valley of death', The Times , leader, 13 November). The valley of Death returns, still as the penultimate line, in stanza II; but then in stanza III it is at once dilated and sharpened as Into the jaws of Death, Into the mouth of Hell (24-25) —lines that themselves return in the returning stanza V as the tragic triumph and relief of Came thro' the jaws of Death, Back from the mouth of Hell, (46-47) 'To our delight we saw them returning' (Russell, The Times )—them, but not all of them. Neither 'Came from the jaws of Death' [46] (MS 1 —E, E 1 —P 6 ) nor 'Rode thro'' [46] (P 6 —55) effected quite such shuddering relief as does the awed reversal of 'Came thro' the jaws of Death'. Look! They have come through. Likewise 'Up from the mouth of Hell' (P 7 , 55) was not only too explicitly allegorical or emblematic but also unsettled the inescapable forward/back movement and the unfolding of 'Came . . . | Back' 35 —the second line, 'Back from the mouth of Hell,' being the exultant counterpart to the subdued 'Then they rode back, but not | Not the six hundred' (37-38). 'The mouth of Hell' the cannon-mouth makes real (no bubble-reputation, theirs). Russell in The Times had said: 'the whole line of the enemy belched forth, from 30 iron mouths, a flood of smoke and flame', and there was later to be a testimony from a witness and a shell-shocked survivor whose mouth could utter 'only monosyllabic replies': 'A copy of Tennyson's poem having been lent me that morning, I took it out and read it. The man, with kindling eye, at once entered upon a spirited description of the fatal gallop between the guns' mouths to and from that cannon-crowded height'. 36 The poem's movement, from one tone of terror (the valley of Death, the valley of the shadow of death which Milton had associated with Hell) 37 to another kind ('the jaws of Death', 'the mouth of Hell'), Tennyson achieved only after he decided not to spring too soon the trap of 'jaws' [4/5(1)], as he had originally been tempted to do (MS 1,3-4 , P 2-3 ). Everything in the first stanza is to return in the poem, except for 'he said' (2) and 'onward' (6). Tennyson tried repetitions of 'onward' in lines 16-17 and 37 (MS 3-4 , P 2-3 , MS 5 —P 6 ) and, in the Maud volume (P 7 , 55), thought of circling back to 'onward' in the very last line, 'How they rode onward.'; but he reverted to the deeper circling that ends the poem with the honour and pathos of the regimental six hundred. Thus the command 'Forward, the Light Brigade!' (5) echoes into the second stanza (9)—echoes both as the command passed on and as the command deepening as it is contemplated. The word 'charge' (6) returns, as detailed above (p. 14) 38 ; 'the guns' (6) become 'the gunners' (29) of stanza IV, as the 'sabres' (27) there mutate to 'Sabring' (29) and then to 'the sabre-stroke' (35). This marshalled advance from the first stanza, through disciplined reiteration, Tennyson maintains throughout the poem, 39 and the superiority of the final readings is often a matter of their sensitivity to these steeled turns and returns. Sometimes the earlier readings are weak in comparison because they countenance a blurred repetition, as in the tautology of 'Struck by the sabre-stroke' (P 6 , MS 6-7 ), which became 'Reel'd from the sabre-stroke' (35) (E 1 , P 6 , MS 6-7 ); or as in the near-tautology of 'the brave and bold' [50] (P 7 , 55); or as in the fatigue (of the verse, not of the men) in 'Half a league back' [37] (MS 5 —P 6 ) and 'Half a league back again,' [47/48] (P 6 —55). Or, gravest of all the temporarily miscalculated repetitions which suggested not a steeled obduracy but an insensible evacuation, there had been on first publication the repetition of the poem's crux, 'Some one had blunder'd' [4/5(4)] (12)—a thing to be said once and once only. Moreover, the first occurrence, enfeebled by enjambement after the 'which' of the preceding line, was so immeasurably weaker than (and therefore destructive of) the second. The progress of the poem is such as to make it seem that the rhyme-scheme is of the greatest simplicity. But Tennyson worked subtly and dramatically with three kinds of line-ending, the proportion and disposition of the three kinds then varying greatly. Some lines do not rhyme at all; some have the effect of a kind of rhyme in that there is a refrain-like repetition of a word which had also earlier ended a line; and some lines rhyme. 40 Thus, despite what would appear to be the rhyming promise of the stanza-shape on the page, 'league', the ending of the very first line of the poem, 'Half a league, half a league', does not have a rhyme in the first stanza or anywhere else in the poem. Yet the internal reiteration of the word is so marked in lines 1 and 2 as to create some effect of rhyme. The endings of lines 2 and 4, 'onward' and 'hundred', do not fully rhyme, but they strike the ear as a partial rhyme; and Tennyson indented these lines to bring out this relationship. (The only lines indented, throughout the final text of the poem, are those ending in 'hundred' or rhyming with it, which link the poem together.) Under the second head, of refrain-like repetition, functioning as both more of a rhyme and less of a rhyme, there are in stanza I the two pairs: first, All in the valley of Death (3) modulated as Into the valley of Death (7) —and then Rode the six hundred. (4) repeated as Rode the six hundred. (8) But this last pair also connects with 'onward', and therefore aligns itself, as being a rhyme, with the stanza's rhyme on its title-word 'Brigade' | 'said' (5-6), though even here the rhyme is approximate rather than full. Stanza II like stanza I, only more so, in that this time there is no repetition of a phrase as an internal chime, has only one unrhyming line (11): Not tho' the soldier knew Some one had blunder'd: (11-12) The mingled exasperation and pathos in 'knew' are manifest in its unanswerability, both literally and stanzaically. Then there is the refrain-like reappearance of 'Into the valley of Death' (16), reappearing now not within the stanza but from the previous one where it had itself manifested a return. And finally there are the actual rhymes—that on 'Brigade', taken up from the first stanza and now 'Brigade' | 'dismay'd'; that on 'blunder'd' | 'hundred' (12, 17), a Lincolnshire rhyme; and (new to the poem, a rhyme relentless in trained obduracy and respect) a triple one: Their's not to make reply, Their's not to reason why, Their's but to do and die: (13-15) Stanza III has no simply unrhymed line; it has a refrain-like triplet, though, taking up what the previous fully-rhyming triplet had entailed confronting: Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them Volley'd and thunder'd; (18-21) and it has the refrain-like 'Into the jaws of Death' (24), echoing (though varying) the first two stanzas. For its full rhyme, stanza III has 'thunder'd' | 'hundred' (21, 26); and it has a triple rhyme that is violated by intrusion: Storm'd at with shot and shell, Boldly they rode and well, Into the jaws of Death, Into the mouth of Hell Rode the six hundred. (22-26) Stanza IV has three unrhymed lines, none of them with end-punctuation. First, there is the superb breath-catching suspension of 'while' (the counterpart to the earlier 'knew'): Charging an army, while All the world wonder'd: (30-31) Second, the enemy positioned at the salient: Cossack and Russian (34) Third, the tolling sadness: Then they rode back, but not Not the six hundred. (37-38) 41 Stanza IV, then, has no refrain-like lines; it has nine rhyming lines, constituted now of three triplets: first, 'bare' | 'air' | 'there'; next, the expansion of the linking rhyme ('wonder'd' | 'sunder'd' | 'hundred'); and again the dramatic sundering of a triple rhyme: Plunged in the battery-smoke Right thro' the line they broke; Cossack and Russian Reel'd from the sabre-stroke (32-35) Stanza V has no simply unrhymed line, while there is a return to the refrain-like triplet of 'them' which had figured in the mirroring stanza III: Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon behind them (39-41) —but this time Tennyson supplements it, with a fourth line that adds the chastened cadence but bold variation on the sense of 'left' in 'left of them' (19, 40), All that was left of them, Left of six hundred. (48-49) Of the full rhymes, the linking one is 'thunder'd' | 'hundred', as in the outward charge of stanza III; and again there is the triple rhyme on 'shell', here yawning and dilated by a fourth occurrence after the line referring to Death: Storm'd at with shot and shell, While horse and hero fell, They that had fought so well Came thro' the jaws of Death, Back from the mouth of Hell, (43-47) The final stanza, in its simplicity sublime, manifests an unimpeded momentum. For the first and last time, there are neither unrhymed nor refrain-like lines; instead, there is the full complement of full rhymes: what had been the rhyme of the first two stanzas, on the title-word 'Brigade' itself, but now heard four times, and the persistent linking rhyme: When can their glory fade? O the wild charge they made! All the world wonder'd. Honour the charge they made! Honour the Light Brigade, Noble six hundred! The structural rhyme itself Tennyson both urges forward and adjusts to the poem's terrain, since the conclusion of each stanza is always 'six hundred' but not always 'the six hundred'. The full phrase—indeed, the full line 'Rode the six hundred'—establishes itself at once as the norm: it ends the poem's first sentence (after four lines) and it then ends the first stanza, as it does the second stanza and the third. But the end of the fourth stanza leaves the line mutilated, though its metre and meaning are still clear and unbroken: Then they rode back, but not Not the six hundred. The end of stanza V cuts at the line again, and now for the first time 'the' is lopped, the cadence sorrowing: All that was left of them, Left of six hundred. (The words 'six hundred' have to be heard quite differently within that rhythm and syntax.) But then the last stanza ends by snatching victory from the very defeat; again no 'the', but now in rounded exultation: Honour the Light Brigade, Noble six hundred! For Tennyson to have ended stanza II with 'So they rode onward' [16-17] (MS 4 , P 2-3 ) (as it stood for a while), and the last stanza with 'How they rode onward' (as it became in P 7 , 55), would have been to lose this immitigable destination for each stanza; and had he ended the poem (as he thought of doing in MS 3-4 , P 3 ) with 'All the six hundred' [55], he would have forfeited not only the long-delayed epithet 'Noble' but also the particular timbre, of awed honour, which rings through the conclusive respect of 'Noble six hundred!' The dramatic escalation of the bombardment of the 'shell' rhyme, moving from stanza III to V, was a development in the poem's art, and there had not been the valuable interrupting of the triple rhyme in stanza III. 42 In stanza IV, the unrhymed targeting of 'Cossack and Russian' (34) after the first two and before the third of the lines ending in the triple rhyme, 'battery-smoke' | 'broke' | 'sabre-stroke' (32, 33, 35), was a change subsequent to publication in the Examiner (MS 5 ); and in stanza V in place of 'While horse and hero fell' (44) Tennyson had contemplated suspensions of the 'shell' | 'fell' | 'well' momentum with 'while' and 'till': Thrust at by lancers while Horsemen &amp; horses fell, [44] (P 5 ) and Hack'd at &amp; hew'd at till Horsemen &amp; horses fell [44] (P 6 ) These alterations, which had none of the poised wonder of stanza IV's: Charging an army, while All the world wonder'd, (30-31) he rightly discarded. As for the final stanza, the misguided revision for the Maud volume (P 7 , 55) was weak in rhyming as in everything else: Honour the brave and bold! Long shall the tale be told, Yea, when our babes are old— How they rode onward. The first three lines rhymed fully, but emptily so, for the triplet of 'bold' | 'told' | 'old' could not hold its own against the energy of the triplets earlier in the poem; and not only was there then no circling back to the rhyme of the first stanza (on the title-word 'Brigade'), but there was no rhyme on 'hundred' and indeed no final acknowledgement of the 'six hundred'. The indentation of certain lines points up only the structural rhymes (on 'hundred') in each stanza, and leaves all the other rhymes and non-rhymes unremarked and undifferentiated, even though their effect upon the ear and upon the poem's movement is markedly different. This decision about how to indent the poem gives the stanza-shape a sturdy unfussy clarity even though the linking rhymes change not only their placing but their number. Tennyson does not attempt the intricately distracting and wellnigh impossible task of indicating by indentings the entire rhyme-scheme of the stanzas; an ode-like stanzaic appearance for the poem would have worked against the needed simplicity and boldness of outline which caused Tennyson to speak of the poem as a ballad. Yet Tuckerman was penetrating when he called it 'the finest irregular Ode ever written upon the grandest subject'. 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' is a fine and grand poem because it is at once a ballad and an ode. At one stage (MS 4 , P 3 ) the poem had no indentation at all; this configuration went too far in the opposite direction, and clouded the clear rhymed shaping which always issues in those last words 'six hundred'. The numbering of the stanzas was not a matter of indifference in a poem which pays such respect to numbers, 43 and to an indeflectible impulsion. The progression, though not absolutely consistent, was the likely one: from not numbering the stanzas (MS 1 —P 6 ), to the simply convenient numbering in Arabic numerals (P 6 —MS 6 , P 9 —74, 84), to the appropriate numbering in Roman numerals (78W, 84W, Eversley)—appropriate because of their traditional (and military) dignity. To Tennyson's friend, Richard Monckton Milnes, 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' was 'a real gallop in verse and only good as such'. 44 But then the charge had been a real gallop, 'the fatal gallop', and Tennyson manifestly intended to embody such a movement: not that of a stampede, out of control, but that of a disciplined fatal gallop, with the repeated rhythms mightily regular and yet continually threatened, disturbed as if by the terrain, and skilfully improvisatory. One simple, though by no means easy, source of the poem's passionate drive is Tennyson's combining a strong stress on the first syllable of each line with a particular apprehension of what enjambement there needs to be in such a poem. (Line 44, 'While horse and hero fell', constitutes something of an exception, though 'while' asks at least some firmness of stress.) Every line takes a stress at once—decisively, unfalteringly, and with indurating obduracy. So the line 'With many a desperate stroke' [32/35] (MS 1 —E, E 1 )—which felt right to Tennyson for some time—had to go, since 'With' could not convincingly take any strong stress (and 'desperate' had the wrong implication for valiant soldiers). The line went, to be followed by a succession of phrasings, all of which would shoulder the prosodic obligation in the poem: 'Fiercely the line they broke' [33] (MS 5 —55); then, 'Strong was the sabre-stroke' [34] (P 7 , 55); then 'Right thro' the foe they broke' [33] (P 6 , MS 6-7 ); and finally, 'Right thro' the line they broke' (33) (MS 6-7 —). Apparently for the same reason, Tennyson rejected the line 'The Russian line they broke' [33] (MS 1 —E, E 1 ); 'The' at the head of the line weakened the fierce prosodic discipline, as did the unstressed first syllable in the rejected line 'Before they rode onward' [37] (MS 5 —P 6 ). This repeated yet inaugurative stress for each line would not amount to much if it were not complemented by Tennyson's imaginative decisions about enjambement. From the start, there is a concurrence of line-ending and sense ending, so that the line-ending constitutes some intrinsic and natural sense-break whether punctuated or not; but Tennyson then impels the meaning forward by the larger syntax which incites such onward motion as will complete the larger units of sense: Half a league, half a league, Half a league onward, All in the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. 'Forward, the Light Brigade! Charge for the guns!' he said: Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. Of these first eight lines, the ends of all but two have punctuation, but this does not impede the movement, so strong is the syntactical and rhythmical urgency; yet at the same time, the fact that there is so strong an acknowledgement of the line-units consolidates the conviction that here is no panic. The ranks of sense and of prosody are not broken; they do not spill forward but surge and urge forward. The particular kind of momentum which Tennyson achieves at the outset, or onset, is different from that of the later stanzas, and he achieves it partly by not admitting a single conjunction in this first stanza. The two lines of the first stanza that do not have terminal punctuation constitute a pairing: All in the valley of Death (3) Into the valley of Death (7) Death does not need terminal punctuation. It is terminal in itself, and is at the same time—like the open space at the end of the line—an awful vista opened for unhesitating and unflinching contemplation, theirs then and ours now. The conclusiveness of the poem's final stanza gains much of its force from every line's being so strongly terminally punctuated, just as the courageous impetuosity of the engaged battle-stanza (IV) is marked by the fact that six of its twelve lines do not have terminal punctuation. 45 Tennyson uses dramatic enjambement sparingly and very astutely in the poem. The three occasions compound their effect by none of them being rhyming lines. The first is in lines 11-12: Not tho' the soldier knew Some one had blunder'd: The propulsion towards an object for that verb 'knew' at the line-ending is such as to make this moment tonally and temporally unique in the poem; in the recording made at the end of Tennyson's life, 46 his voice swoops upon knew with an emphasis at once awed, exasperated, and half-incredulous at the immediately culpable folly of some one —a folly manifest to each of the cavalrymen involved. (The effect in the recording is riveting.) 47 The second dramatic enjambement is the great suspended 'while' of stanza IV, which makes one feel the world holding its breath in awe: Charging an army, while All the world wonder'd: (30-31) The Times (leader, 14 November) had said 'under the eyes of the whole world'; Tennyson realized such suspense and suspension. The third and last dramatic enjambement gravely and pausingly acknowledges the pain of loss: Then they rode back, but not Not the six hundred. (37-38) The chastened recognition of the grim reality is realized not only in the hinged repetition ('not | Not') and in the enjambement, but also in Tennyson's final decision not to fret the penultimate line ending with a comma (which he had done in MS 3-4 , P 7 , and the Maud volume). Negatives take and make a particular weight in the poem because of what the Charge of the Light Brigade was. Positive in its courage, in its discipline (discipline involving the negation of self), and positively to be celebrated, the Charge was yet a hideous mistake. 'Even accident would have made it more tolerable. But it was a mere mistake—evidently a mistake, and perceived to be such when it was too late to correct it' ( The Times , leader, 13 November). The Charge was a positive exploit at which the world said, 'Oh no'. The most famous thing ever said about it needed an inexorable negative to come hard on the heels of the praise: 'C'est très magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre'. 48 Tennyson effects such a turn himself by concentrating his negatives and by turning them so that they are positive acclamations. There are no negatives in the first or last stanza, or in stanza III. Stanza II turns them to the soldier's glory —it was not as though he did not know that the order was a blunder. Not tho' the soldier knew Some one had blunder'd: (11-12) and immediately, following the logic of that colon, discipline reveals itself as abnegation: Their's not to make reply, Their's not to reason why, (13-14) 49 —and then there is the climactic turn into the highest negation, self-abnegation, which becomes the greatest self-sacrifice: Their's but to do and die: (13-15) not, alas, 'do or die'. 50 The line is one of Tennyson's greatest evocations of duty. As the author, two years earlier, of the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington , where thrice over he had tolled the word 'duty', he is sure to have been moved by every word of the original sentence in The Times (leader, 13 November): 'The British soldier will do his duty, even to certain death, and is not paralyzed by feeling that he is the victim of some hideous blunder'. In 'The Charge of the Light Brigade', the word 'duty', unuttered, becomes not what the poem says but what it breathes. The economy and dignity of these paradoxes of the positive and the negative in the Charge of the Light Brigade had been present to Tennyson from the outset. Only one line (much reconsidered as to its wording and placing) ever constituted a misjudgement of the poem's economy in this respect: No man was there dismay'd [10] (MS 1-3 , P 1-3 ) No man was there afraid [53/54] (MS 2-3 , P 1-2 ) Hearts that were not dismay'd [10] (MS 3-4 , P 2-3 ) This negation was a derogation of the soldiers' unflinching sense of duty; flatly not to have been afraid would have been stark insensibility, not courage. Tennyson removed this inauthentic negative, and replaced it with a question which is at once a stirring rhetorical question and a real question: Was there a man dismay'd? (10) (P 5-6 , MS 6 —) No, and yes. Dismayed to do his duty, no (each man was a man ); dismayed at what that must mean, yes to some degree (each man was a man). There is only one other question in the poem, and forty lines later it rhymes with 'Was there a man dismay'd?': When can their glory fade? (50) This is prospective in its high confidence, not retrospective as had been the riskily historical question with which Tennyson once toyed at this point: 'When was a charge so made' [50/51] (MS 2 ). A poem of praise might be expected to lavish panegyrical epithets. One of Tennyson's most felicitous reticences is his withholding of the easy adjectival and adverbial celebrations. Of the latter, 'Onward' in stanza I is direct and unadorned; 'Boldly' and 'well' in III—'Boldly they rode and well' (22)—are no more than the simple minimal tribute to courage and skill; and 'well' then returns, stationed likewise at the line-ending in V, where it has great acclamatory force just because it is so unexclamatory, so little concerned to pause for applause—just as the word 'hero' 51 moves on past, acknowledged, neither slighted nor luxuriated in: While horse and hero fell, They that had fought so well (44-45) There is a matching restraint in Tennyson's employment of adjectives, which might have been expected to figure resoundingly. The Times (leader, 13 November) applied the epithets 'splendid' and 'glorious' twice each (in the second instance 'most glorious'); and Tennyson himself wrote of the Charge as 'glorious'—but not in his poem, 52 and he did not resort to any such superlative as 'most glorious' for this superlative feat of courage. Apart from the celebration, in the opening and closing stanzas, of the military name with its neutral adjective ('the Light Brigade'), the only adjectives are as follows. 53 First, there are the past-participial forms: in stanza II, 'Was there a man dismay'd? (10); in III and repeated in V, 'Storm'd at with shot and shell' (22, 43); in IV possibly 'Plunged in the battery-smoke' (32)—possibly, since the first effect, because of the punctuation and syntax, is of a sudden plunging, as if the sense were '[they] plunged in the battery-smoke'; and in IV as applied to the Russians, 'Shatter'd and sunder'd' (36). 54 Second, the poem has three simple adjectives: 'bare', for the cavalrymen's weapons in IV, 'Flash'd all their sabres bare' (27), and two adjectives in the final stanza, 'O the wild charge they made!' (51)—whereupon, as if 'wild', though true, were less than the whole truth, the word is made to fall away from the echoing companion line, though it is not rescinded: 'Honour the charge they made!' (53). 55 So into the final two lines: Honour the Light Brigade, Noble six hundred! (54-55) And there at last, after all the noble reticence, comes a direct adjective for them, one of high and simple praise: 'Noble six hundred!' In the poem's discipline, Tennyson's art offers a modest counterpart to the 'Noble six hundred'. The Times (leader, 14 November) had praised the Charge as noble ('a noble but disastrous deed—a fatal display of courage which all must admire while they lament'), but the newspaper's adverbial and adjectival exclamations—a 'spectacle so strange, so terrific, so disastrous, and yet so grand'—clamorously refused to allow 'noble' the dignity which Tennyson was to give it. His poem came in the end to utter its praise, not at all reluctantly but with all the accruings of patience and steadiness. It is good that he did not leave the poem, as he had thought of doing, with 'All the six hundred!' (MS 3 ). It would have been carrying restraint too far, grudgingly so, never to have arrived at such an epithet as 'noble'. No critique can adequately account for the poetic genius with which Tennyson fashioned 'The Charge of the Light Brigade'. Nevertheless, analysis of the surviving documents provides extensive testimony to his painstaking artistry. The imaginative impulse and a significant element of the phrasing were derived from The Times , but the poet's inspiration and discernment led him to refine away or to transform much of the original language and notably to enhance the quality of his achievement. To be sure, his progress in the development of the text was by no means unfaltering—the reversion in Maud, and Other Poems evinces an especially recalcitrant muse. Yet his failure there seems to have been largely a function of misperceiving his audience and of revising his poem in terms of an elite metropolitan reader. Once galvanized to address the soldier in the Crimea, he moved confidently and unerringly to create an undying utterance of the English tongue. The Times in its leader of 14 November had words of some application to the consolatory power of poetry and of such a poem as 'The Charge of the Light Brigade': 'Small consolation as it is, yet survivors, friends, and the public will be thankful that the terrible scene of the 25th had spectators who could appreciate it, and an historian worthy to relate it'. And then a poet. Bibliographical Note: Descriptions of Manuscripts and Proofs in Chronological Order MS 1 , in Houghton Library, Harvard University, consists of 48 lines in 5 unnumbered stanzas, untitled, written in black ink in Tennyson's autograph, in a tan notebook with a green calf spine, measuring 8⅜” x 5⅝” (Call no. MS Eng 952 *54M-203 [30]). A piece of white cloth tape, measuring 1frac916” x ⅜”, has been pasted on the spine and carries, written in black ink, reading vertically, the title 'MAUDXXXIX'; the front cover has written in black ink 'XXXIX'. Lithographed on the back cover is an advertisement for T. S. Tompkins, Bookseller, Stationer &amp; Printer, 163, Strand. There are 26 fols. and numerous stubs; the paper is plain bluish, wove, unwatermarked, measuring 8⅜” x 5⅜”. In addition to 'The Charge of the Light Brigade', there are 19 pages of Maud , two fragments of 'Merlin and Vivien', and 10 lines of The Princess . 'The Charge' is written back to front in the notebook on fols. 26 v and 25 v . Each leaf is partially torn away on the right-hand edge, so that parts of 37 lines are lacking. There is no concluding stanza (the draft ends with final text l. 49), and there is no footnote concerning the number of sabres in the charge. MS 2 , in the Tennyson Research Centre, Lincoln, consists of 58 lines in 7 unnumbered stanzas, written in black ink, primarily in Emily Tennyson's autograph, on the recto, verso, and recto of two conjugate leaves of white laid paper, measuring 4⅜” x 7”. There is a small blind stamped design in the upper left-hand corner of fol. 1, and the verso of fol. 2 is blank, except for the handwritten number '64' in black ink (but not the same as that of the text) in the upper left-hand corner. The title, the last six lines of the poem, the signature 'A. T.', the footnote, 'Written after reading the first report of the Times correspondent where only 607 sabres are mentioned as having taken part in the charge.', and several emendations are in the poet's hand. There are directions to the printer in the margins of fol. 1 by John Forster, the editor of the Examiner , and 'MS | Box', in an unknown hand, appears in the upper right-hand margin of this folio. MS 3 , in the Tennyson Research Centre, consists of 56 lines in 8 unnumbered stanzas, untitled and without the footnote, written in black ink in Emily Tennyson's autograph, with Tennyson's corrections, on the recto and verso of a quarto sheet of white laid paper, unwatermarked, folded in the middle, of which the leaves measure 7” x 8⅞”. There is a strip of clear gummed tape along the entire left-hand edge of the verso. 'First Draft' in an unknown hand in the upper right-hand corner of fol. 1 is manifestly inaccurate in view of the text in the notebook at Harvard. Although this draft may originally have been earlier than MS 2 , Tennyson's revisions bring it to a state later than MS 2 but earlier than MS 4 . MS 4 , in the Tennyson Research Centre, consists of 56 lines in 8 unnumbered stanzas, written on the rectos and versos of two conjugate leaves of white laid paper, unwatermarked, measuring 4⅜” x 7”, and is a fair copy in Emily Tennyson's hand made from the state of the text in MS 3 . No line of the entire poem is indented. There is a small blind stamped design in the upper left-hand corner of fol. 1, and 'MS Box', in an unknown hand, appears in the upper right-hand corner. The initials 'A. T.' stand at the end of the poem on fol. 2 v , and the numeral '63' in black ink (but not the same as that of the text) occupies the upper left-hand corner of 2 v . Lehman MS, whereabouts unknown, written in ink in Tennyson's autograph, on 2 octavo pages, signed ' Tennyson ', Union Galleries, New York, N. H. Lehman sale, April 17, 1936, lot 295. Although described in the sale catalogue (p. 59) as the 'Original Autograph Manuscript', line 6, as quoted, contains accidentals subsequent to MS 4 and corresponding to those in P 1 . No trace of this MS after 1936 appears in American Book Prices Current or Book Auction Records . Thus far, correspondence with booksellers and libraries and a notice in the Newsletter of The Manuscript Society, composed of collectors of manuscripts, have failed to bring it to light. P 1 , belonging to Mr. Robert H. Taylor, on deposit in the Princeton University Library, consists of 58 lines in 7 unnumbered stanzas, printed in a single column on the recto of a single leaf of white wove paper, unwatermarked, measuring 5frac1516” x 11frac516”, which has been inlaid and bound by Bradstreet's in full red morocco, measuring 9” x 12¼”. On the front cover in gilt lettering appears 'CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE | ORIGINAL PROOF | [ long rule ] | MS. CORRECTIONS BY TENNYSON | [ long rule ]'. A proof for the Examiner , of which the type was set from MS 2 , it has the title and the footnote. Besides several changes in accidentals in the poem and in the footnote and the printer's error 'He' corrected to 'We' (l. 27)—all of which were probably on the proof when the poet received it— Tennyson altered the beginning of lines 27-28 to read 'Flash'd all' and 'Flash'd' and deleted the line 'No man was there afraid;' between lines 53 and 54. At the bottom of this proof sheet there is the following penciled annotation: 'The original rough proof sheet corrected by A. Tennyson before it was printed in the Examiner. I bought this at H. J. E. Rawlins' sale (secretary to John Forster) 1881. J. F. Dexter'. On the verso, in the lower right-hand corner, in the same hand, is another penciled note: 'This cost me "nil." 1881.' This proof, which for some years belonged to William Harris Arnold, Thomas J. Wise discusses in A Bibliography of the Writings of Alfred Lord Tennyson (1908), 147-148; and Arnold refers to it in his Ventures in Book Collecting (1923), p. 248. It was lot 971 in the sale Catalogue of the William Harris Arnold Collection , November 10-11, 1924, p. 222. P 2 , in the Tennyson Research Centre, consists of 58 lines in 7 unnumbered stanzas (changed to 6), printed in a single column on the recto of a single leaf of white wove paper, unwatermarked, measuring 5frac1516” x 11¾”. Pulled from the same type as P 1 , it bears extensive corrections by John Forster to bring the text (except for indented lines) into conformity with MS 4 . This proof is No. 3871 in Tennyson in Lincoln: A Catalogue of the Collections in the Research Centre , comp. by Nancie Campbell, 2 vols. (1971, 1973), II, 10. P 3 , in the Tennyson Research Centre, consisting of 56 lines in 6 unnumbered stanzas (changed to 7), printed in a single column on the recto of a single leaf of white wove paper, unwatermarked, measuring 5¼” x 10⅛”, is the final proof for the Examiner , for which the type was set according to MS 4 and P 2 , and corrected according to P 1 . It has the title and footnote and bears corrections in Forster's hand and in another hand, similar to Tennyson's but that differs from his. There is clear gummed tape running from top to bottom on the left- and right-hand edges. This proof is No. 3868 in Tennyson in Lincoln , II, 10. (The poem appeared in the Examiner , 9 December 1854, p. 780, col. 1.) Hardie MS, in the Tennyson Research Centre, Lincoln, consists of 56 lines in 7 unnumbered stanzas, untitled, written in black ink in an unknown hand on the rectos and versos of two conjugate leaves of white laid notepaper, unwatermarked, measuring 4½” x 7”, and bearing the address, blind-embossed, 'Hinchingbrook | Huntingdon' in the top center of fol. 1. This MS has no standing in the development of the text. Presented by Mr. William Hardie to the Tennyson Research Centre in 1965, it follows the text of the Examiner in substantives, except for two readings, 'All in the valley of death' for 'Into the valley of Death' ( Examiner , l. 5) and 'While horse and rider fell' for 'While horse and hero fell' (l. 44). These variants seem to be lapses by the copyist and appear in no other version of the text of the poem. The Hardie MS has the footnote and the date, 'Hinchingbrook Jan y 23. 1855', at the bottom of fol. 2. This MS is not discussed in our article and is described here to avoid any further consideration of its having textual significance. See letters to the editor of the Times Literary Supplement by William Hardie, 3 June 1965, p. 455, and Sir Charles Tennyson, 15 July 1965, p. 597. MS 5 is a facsimile of a fragment of manuscript containing 9 lines that became, with modifications, final ll. 32-38 of 'The Charge', which belonged to William Harris Arnold and which he reproduced in his Ventures in Book Collecting (1923), p. 249. Lot 970 in the Arnold sale at the Anderson Galleries, November 10-11, 1924, the MS was sold to James F. Drake, a New York bookseller, whose files are now at the University of Texas. On November 11, 1924, it was bought from Drake by Howard J. Sachs. Lot 114 in the Sachs sale, Parke Bernet Galleries, February 1, 1944, it was sold, possibly to Maurice Inman, a New York bookseller, now out of business. Mr. Sachs was alive at the time of the sale but is now deceased. The authors have been unable to discover any further record of this MS or its present whereabouts. (We are grateful to Mr. John F. Fleming and to Ms. Ellen S. Dunlap, Research Librarian, at the University of Texas for information about it.) E 1 , in the Tennyson Research Centre, is a photocopy of the text on p. 780 of the Examiner with the last four lines of stanza 5 struck out and all but the first of the 9 lines contained in MS 5 written in black ink in Emily Tennyson's autograph in the left-hand margin. There are six notations in Hallam Tennyson's hand in black ink in the margins to indicate variations of this version from the Eversley text. There is a tab in the upper left-hand corner carrying the printed number '38'; 'TENNYSON', hand-written in black ink appears above this number. On the verso of the photocopy, written in blue ink, is the designation, 'Lincoln Public Lib.' Also attached to the verso is a card bearing a typewritten statement that this is a copy of the poem in the Examiner , that the alternate lines are in the hand of the poet's wife, and that it was 'Presented by the late Willingham F. Rawnsley M.A., J.P.'. (Willingham Franklin Rawnsley, son of Robert Drummond Rawnsley, the Vicar of Shiplake, who married Tennyson and Emily Sellwood in 1850, was a member of a family closely associated with the Tennysons for three generations.) This state of the text is No. 3873, Tennyson in Lincoln , II, 10. 'Knoyle House' MS, in the Tennyson Research Centre, consists of 60 lines in 8 unnumbered stanzas, no footnote, entitled, 'Charge of the Light Brigade | at Balaclava—Oct 25 1855', and is written in black ink in an unknown hand on the recto, verso, and recto of two conjugate leaves of white laid notepaper, unwatermarked. Like the Hardie MS, it has no standing in the development of the text. The address, 'Knoyle House | Swindon Wilts', blind-embossed and centered, appears on fol. 2. Although some accidentals vary, the substantives of the text are those of E 1 , P 4 , P 5 , and P 6 (before Tennyson's alterations). The copyist omitted l. 25, wrote 'Valley' for 'jaws' in l. 24, and in the last two lines but one spelled 'Honour' without a 'u'. This MS (No. 3876 in Tennyson in Lincoln , II, 10) is not discussed in our article and is described here to avoid further consideration of its having textual significance. P 4 , in the Tennyson Research Centre, consisting of 61 lines in 8 unnumbered stanzas, titled, printed on white laid paper, watermarked with a design, measuring 7⅜” x 9frac116”, is an uncorrected proof, set in Examiner type in two columns (with the footnote in a single line running the width of the page) that incorporates the readings in Emily Tennyson's autograph on E 1 . Clear gummed tape runs the length of the left- and right-hand edges of this proof (No. 3870 in Tennyson in Lincoln , II, 10). P 5 , belonging to Mr. Robert H. Taylor, on deposit at the Princeton University Library, is a duplicate proof, pulled from the same type as P 4 , on the same white laid paper, watermarked along the left-hand side of the leaf 'J Allen's Superfine', and measuring 7frac516” x 9frac116”. There are four autograph corrections of substantives and two of accidentals in black ink by Tennyson. William Harris Arnold, who owned this proof during much of the first quarter of the twentieth-century, refers to it in his Ventures in Book Collecting , p. 248. It was lot 972 in the sale Catalogue of the William Harris Arnold Collection , November 10-11, 1924, p. 222. P 6 , in the Beinecke Library, Yale University, is another duplicate proof, pulled from the same type as P 4 and P 5 , on the same white laid paper, watermarked along the bottom left-hand margin 'J Allen's', and measuring 7frac516” x 9frac116” (Call no. MS Vault Tennyson). There are extensive autograph corrections and alternative readings in black ink by both Tennyson and his wife. The stanzas have been partially numbered by the poet, and on the verso in Hallam Tennyson's hand is the incorrect notation in pencil: 'Leaf sent to | troops in | Crimea | Charge of Light Brigade'. P 7 , in the Tennyson Research Centre, which consists of 46 lines in 5 stanzas numbered in Arabic numerals with title and no footnote, appears in a trial- or proof-copy for the 1st edition of Maud, and Other Poems , 1855 (pp. [151]-[154]), that is bound in brown calf with gilt tooling. There are alterations in Tennyson's autograph, and the last stanza, including the numeral 5, is entirely in his hand (No. 4132 in Tennyson in Lincoln , II, 10). 55(a), in the Rare Book Room, University of Virginia, exists in a copy of the first edition of Maud, and Other Poems , 1855, in which Tennyson has drawn a line in black ink vertically down the center of each page of the text of the poem as it appears on pp. [151]-154. A single correction of a colon to a semicolon after 'sabre-stroke' in l. 35 appears on p. 153. The volume has been bound in red morocco by Rivière, with gilt lettering on the spine as follows: '[ design of flowers in a vase ] | MAUD | &amp; OTHER POEMS | ALFRED | TENNYSON | [ short rule ] | REVISE | [ design as above ] | [ design as above ] | [ design as above ] | 1855' (Call no. *PR5567 | .A1 | 1855a). MS 6 , in the Widener Collection, Harvard University, consists of 55 lines in 7 stanzas numbered in Arabic numerals, untitled, no footnote, written in Tennyson's autograph in black ink on the recto, verso, and recto of 2 leaves of blue laid paper, unwatermarked, measuring 7⅞” x 9⅞”. It has his revisions of ll. 33-36 and of lower case 'd' to a capital in 'Death' (ll. 7, 16, 24, 46). This MS is preserved in a blue morocco folding case, gilt-tooled, measuring 8¾” x 10¾” (Call. no. HEW 12.4.10) and contains an accompanying letter in black ink, dated 1 Sept. 1911, concerning the provenance of the MS, which belonged to Miss Amelia Walker of Meadfoot Rock, Torquay, an acquaintance and admirer of Tennyson. Upon her death in 1894 it came to her cousin, Arthur Radford, a J.P. in the county of Derby. Across the top of the letter in another hand in pencil appears the notation, 'no. 92—the Tennyson Centenary Exhibition, July 1909. | London.' This MS, erroneously described as the 'original manuscript', was lot 97 in Rosenbach Catalogue 22, offered for a sale November 6-20, 1911 ( The Collected Catalogues of Dr. H. S. W. Rosenbach, 1904-1951 , 10 vols. [1967], IV). It remained in Rosenbach's possession and became part of 'the extensive additions' after Harry Elkins Widener's loss on the Titanic that his mother, with the blessing of his grandfather, Peter A. B. Widener, somewhat surreptitiously made to Harry's collection. P. A. B. Widener was the actual purchaser for the sum of $6000 (Edwin Wolf 2nd with John F. Fleming, Rosenbach: A Biography [1960], pp. 78, 79). MS 7 , in the Tennyson Research Centre, consists of 55 lines in 7 unnumbered stanzas, untitled, no footnote, written in Emily Tennyson's autograph in black ink on the recto, verso, and recto of two leaves of the same blue laid paper, unwatermarked, measuring 7⅞” x 9⅞”, as is MS 6 , and has revisions of ll. 33-36 in Emily Tennyson's hand in accordance with the poet's on MS 6 . In addition AT has changed 'Those' to 'They' (l. 45) and 'through' to 'thro" (l. 46). The upper right-hand corner of the recto of fol. 1 bears the notation in black ink, 'MS Box | No 69'. P 8 , in the Tennyson Research Centre, consisting of 7 unnumbered stanzas (altered to 6), with title, printed on the recto, verso, and recto of two conjugate leaves of wove paper, unwatermarked, measuring 8½” x 11frac116”, is a proof for the quarto broadsheet, 'the soldier's version', that Tennyson sent to the Crimea. There are corrections of accidentals and the conjoining of a two-line stanza (ll. 37-38) with the preceding one, all by Forster. Tennyson's note to the soldiers, in Forster's autograph, is appended to the bottom of fol. 2. On fol. 2 v in the upper right-hand corner in Hallam Tennyson's hand is the notation, 'Charge of Light Brigade | &amp; | Patriotic poems | ---' (No. 3874, Tennyson in Lincoln , II, 10). P 9 , in the Tennyson Research Centre, consisting of 6 stanzas, numbered in Arabic numerals, with title and no footnote, is an uncorrected proof of pp. [161]-168 for the so-called '3rd edition' ( i. e. 2nd edition) of the Maud volume, 1856, printed on pages of white wove paper, unwatermarked, measuring 4frac316” x 6frac316”, which form an unsewn 8vo gathering. The poem begins on p. [161] (which has the signature 'M' in the right-hand corner at the bottom of the page), continues on pp. 162-163, and concludes on p. 164 (which carries at the bottom of the page, centered, 'LONDON: | BRADBURY AND EVANS, PRINTERS, WHITEFRIARS.'). Moxon's advertisement of Tennyson's Poems , 10th ed., The Princess , 6th ed., Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington , 2nd ed., and In Memoriam , 6th ed. appears on p. [165]. Pages [166-167] are blank. On p. [168] is written in pencil, presumably in Nancie Campbell's hand, 'Proof of pp. 161-164 of | the | 3rd ed of Maud and | other poems 1856' (No. 4140, Tennyson in Lincoln , II, 19). MS 8 , in the Rare Book Room, University of Virginia, consists of 55 lines in 6 stanzas, of which the first is unnumbered and the remainder numbered in Arabic numerals, with title and no footnote. It is written in black ink in Tennyson's autograph on the recto, verso, and recto of two conjugate leaves of white laid notepaper, unwatermarked, bearing the blind-embossed address in the upper right-hand corner of fol. 1, 'Farringford, | Freshwater, | Isle of Wight.' and the signature and date, 'A Tennyson | Apr. 10/64.' on fol. 2. This MS is preserved in a red morocco folding case, gilt-tooled. The spine reads, 'THE | CHARGE | OF THE | LIGHT BRIGADE | TENNYSON | AUTOGRAPH MANUSCRIPT' and the front cover, 'TENNYSON | [ short rule ] | THE CHARGE | OF THE | LIGHT BRIGADE | [ short rule ] | AUTOGRAPH MANUSCRIPT' (Call no. #6171). This MS does not figure in the lineal development of the text after Maud, and Other Poems [2nd ed.], 1856; but because it is an autograph MS that Tennyson wrote out, presumably as a gift to a friend, and because it is catalogued as existing in a major research library, its variant readings (which are only a few in accidentals) seem worth recording in the Historical Collation. The Charge of the Light Brigade. (Authoritative text, Eversley edition, II [1908], 225-227.) I. 1 Half a league, half a league, 2 Half a league onward, 3 All in the valley of Death 4 Rode the six hundred. 5 'Forward, the Light Brigade! 6 Charge for the guns!' he said: 7 Into the valley of Death 8 Rode the six hundred. II. 9 'Forward, the Light Brigade!' 10 Was there a man dismay'd? 11 Not tho' the soldier knew 12 Some one had blunder'd: 13 Their's not to make reply, 14 Their's not to reason why, 15 Their's but to do and die: 16 Into the valley of Death 17 Rode the six hundred. III. 18 Cannon to right of them, 19 Cannon to left of them, 20 Cannon in front of them 21 Volley'd and thunder'd; 22 Storm'd at with shot and shell, 23 Boldly they rode and well, 24 Into the jaws of Death, 25 Into the mouth of Hell 26 Rode the six hundred. IV. 27 Flash'd all their sabres bare, 28 Flash'd as they turn'd in air 29 Sabring the gunners there, 30 Charging an army, while 31 All the world wonder'd: 32 Plunged in the battery-smoke 33 Right thro' the line they broke; 34 Cossack and Russian 35 Reel'd from the sabre-stroke 36 Shatter'd and sunder'd. 37 Then they rode back, but not 38 Not the six hundred. V. 39 Cannon to right of them, 40 Cannon to left of them, 41 Cannon behind them 42 Volley'd and thunder'd; 43 Storm'd at with shot and shell, 44 While horse and hero fell, 45 They that had fought so well 46 Came thro' the jaws of Death, 47 Back from the mouth of Hell, 48 All that was left of them, 49 Left of six hundred. VI. 50 When can their glory fade? 51 O the wild charge they made! 52 All the world wonder'd. 53 Honour the charge they made! 54 Honour the Light Brigade, 55 Noble six hundred! HISTORICAL COLLATION Except for revisions listed subsequently in Alterations in the Manuscripts, this collation comprises the substantive and accidental readings in the documents listed (in chronological order of textual states with the corresponding symbols) that vary from the authoritative text of the poem in the Eversley edition (1908), which Tennyson and his son, Hallam, annotated. As a matter of convenience and to save space, Tennyson is referred to as AT, his wife as ET, and John Forster, the editor of the Examiner , as F.

[Crown edition]. C. Kegan Paul, 1878 84 Maud, and Other Poems [19th ed.]. Macmillan, 1884 84W The Works of Alfred Tennyson . [Collected edition, first issue]. Macmillan, 1884 The methods used for recording both textual variations and alterations in the manuscripts are those detailed by Fredson Bowers in his article, 'The Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants', Studies in Bibliography , 29 (1976), 212-264, and exemplified in his apparatus for the definitive ACLS-Harvard edition of William James's Works (1975-). For ease in comparing the variant readings, as many alterations in the manuscripts as possible have been included in the Historical Collation. An ampersand for 'and' has not been considered a variant, but where a variant in a manuscript includes an ampersand, it is reproduced. The number introducing each recorded variant is the line number of the Eversley edition (and The Poems of Tennyson , ed. Christopher Ricks [1969], pp. 1034-1036). Numbers separated by a slanting stroke, for example 4/5, indicate a line or lines, as the case may be, that existed in an antecedent text but not in Eversley. To identify each of the four lines that existed in a number of the early states of the text between lines 4 and 5 the designations 4/5(1), 4/5(2), 4/5(3), and 4/5(4) have been used. The lemma—the reading to the left of the bracket—is that of the authoritative text. The variants follow in chronological order to the right of the bracket. If the sigil—the symbol for one of the collated texts listed above—does not appear to the right of the bracket, the reading in that state of the text is the same as that of Eversley, except for the parts of 37 lines of MS 1 that are torn out and the lines of the Arnold facsimile MS that are lacking. Failure of the sigil for one of these MSS to appear to the right of the bracket means agreement of the reading for extant lines and no reading where the lines are lacking. (Doubt as to which of these meanings can be resolved by referring to the extant lines for each MS set forth above and seems preferable to cluttering the Historical Collation with reminders of any variant line or part of a line that is lacking in one or both of the two MSS— i. e. MS 1 , MS 5 ). In three instances (ll. 6, 13, 15) the reading of the lemma existed in a manuscript, became altered, and then was reverted to. For clarity in these circumstances, the sigil for the text in which the early reading is the same as the lemma is shown immediately to the right of the bracket and before the symbol for AT's alteration of a printed text or before the variant reading when the return to the original reading did not result from correction of a proof. In a few instances where a variant reading involves a word at the end of a line that has been torn out of MS 1 , the conjectural reading has been supplied in pointed brackets &lt; &gt;. Since the printed text of 55(a) (the author's copy of Maud, and Other Poems , 1855, with the text of 'The Charge' deleted) is that of the first edition, variant readings in the letterpress of 55(a) are not recorded, and the sigil 55(a) is omitted except for one instance—to show the poet's single autograph change of a colon to a semicolon in l. 34. The second issue of the first edition (55 2 ), which has this one variant of a semicolon, is treated in the same way. Readings resulting from AT's, ET's, or F's autograph alterations of a printed text are distinguished as AT/P 1 , ET/E 1 , F/P 2 , for example. Three alterations in an unidentified hand on P 3 are designated U/P 3 . When these autograph alterations of the printed text result in the final reading of the authoritative text, the sigil is placed out of chronological order immediately to the right of the bracket or immediately after any early MS reading that is the same as the lemma. This practice provides emphasis and saves space. The alteration is easily understood by comparing the printed variant in the designated proof with the lemma. A number of words or lines in the authoritative text do not exist in earlier versions, and they are accounted for by not , followed by the appropriate sigil(s). Stet means a substantive or accidental deleted and then marked to stand. A superscript 1 or 2 preceding a word identifies one or the other of two identical words in the same line. A vertical stroke | indicates the ending of a line. A sigil, a dash, and another sigil (for example, MS 1-4 or MS 2 -P 2 ) are used as a means of saving space to signify that a variant reading exists in MS 1 and all subsequent states in which the word, phrase, or line appears through MS 4 ( i. e. MS 2 , MS 3 , and MS 4 ) or in MS 2 through P 2 ( i. e. MS 3 , MS 4 , P 1 , P 2 ). Informational comments concerning variants that do not include a revision in a MS or a printed text are provided in parentheses. Information concerning the nature of a revision appears in brackets. Two arbitrary symbols have been employed in this Historical Collation: the section mark (§) and the double dagger (‡). The section mark beside a line number indicates a variant involving wholly or in part an alteration that has not been recorded in the Alterations in the Manuscripts and has been included instead in the Historical Collation. The double dagger indicates that a variant in a MS is part of an alteration which is not easily transferable to the Historical Collation but which can be found particularized in the Alterations in the Manuscripts. When alterations in the MSS are included in the Historical Collation (and in some instances concerning autograph alterations of a printed text), the processes of revision are described in square brackets. The quoted text outside a revision in brackets is always the final version in a corrected MS. When no words precede the description of an alteration in a MS (or of an autograph alteration of a printed text), the description applies to the lemma. Some readings are reproduced formulaically. In order to specify the words in the text that are affected by the description in square brackets, an asterisk (*) appears before the first word to which the description in square brackets applies. When there is no asterisk, the description in square brackets applies to all the words of a reading preceding the brackets, or the affected word or words are written in the square brackets along with the description—usually the record of a deletion. AT's alterations in a MS in ET's hand are shown with his initials in parentheses (AT). In the descriptions of alterations in the MSS, over means a correction by writing over a letter(s) of a word on the original line; interlined (abbreviated intrl .) means added between lines. Above ( ab .) positions an interlineation with respect to a word or words in a line, which are usually deleted ( del. ) but sometimes are not ( undel. ). Inserted ( insrt .) refers to an addition in the margin. No distinction has been made between interlineations and insertions made with or without a caret or guideline. In order to focus upon the alteration achieved and to save space by not detailing the means of achieving it, the general description altered from ( alt. fr. ) has been used occasionally. Other abbreviations are as follows: aft. for after, bef. for before, transpd. for transposed , indent. for indented .

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Memoir (1897), I, 381. 2 Letter to John Forster, 6 December 1854, The Letters of Emily Lady Tennyson , ed. James O. Hoge (1974), p. 70. Tennyson's wife is contradictory concerning the date of composition itself. In the letter to Forster, she refers to the poem as 'written yesterday' (5 December); but the entry in her Journal under 2 December confirms the son's date: 'A. wrote "The Charge of the Light Brigade" &amp; sent it to The Examiner ' ( Lady Tennyson's Journal , ed. James O. Hoge [1981], p. 40). A letter from Tennyson to Forster with a postscript by his wife, also dated 6 December (printed below), establishes that he and his wife actually posted the poem to the Examiner on 6 December. 3 For a bibliographical description of this MS and the other MSS and proofs compared in this article, see the Bibliographical Note below. 4 This letter is in the Tennyson Research Centre, Lincoln Public Library, Lincoln (abbreviated TRC). Hereafter the whereabouts of other unpublished letters will be given in the text. For permission to print from letters, MSS, and proofs, the authors are grateful to the Lord Tennyson, Mr. Richard Garnett, Mr. Robert H. Taylor, and the authorities of the Lincolnshire Library Services, Harvard University, The Johns Hopkins University, and Yale University. In printing letters, we observe exactly the orthography and punctuation (or lack of it) in the original (or in a typescript or printed text, when the MS original is not available), with the following exceptions: we regularly indent paragraphs, put postscripts at the end of the letter (regardless of where they actually appear), and separate without a stop the 'A' and the 'T' of Tennyson, which the poet often wrote together in his signature. 5 In the leader of 13 November, The Times had first said 'about 700 strong' and then later 'seven hundred'; in the second edition of 13 November and on 14 November, the special correspondent's report had given both '607 sabres' and a total of 607, while the leader of 14 November had spoken of 600. Working from recollection, the poet and his wife seem to have transposed the chronology of the numbers: she wrote to Forster concurrently with Tennyson on 6 December of the 'first report of The Times which gave the number as 605. He prefers "six hundred" on account of the metre but if you think it should be altered to 700 which from later accounts seems to have been the number he says you are to alter it' ( The Letters of Emily Lady Tennyson , p. 70). Actually, 673 horsemen began the charge, according to E. L. Woodward; '113 were killed and 134 wounded; 475 of the horses were killed and 42 wounded' ( The Age of Reform, 1815-1870 [1938; rpt. with corrections, 1946], p. 272. 6 MS 4 , in which none of the lines is indented from the left-hand margin, is a fair copy in Emily Tennyson's hand of MS 3 , a MS in her hand with emendations in the poet's. Presumably an additional MS is extant that seems to be a textual state slightly later than MS 4 and coincident with the first proof (P 1 ). It was lot 295 in the N. H. Lehman sale at the Union Galleries in New York, 17 April 1936; but its subsequent history and present whereabouts we have not been able to discover. For details concerning this MS, see the Bibliographical Note. 7 Emily Tennyson presumably had written separately to this effect in a letter now lost. 8 Forster's quoting 'muse of fire' (with 'ascend') from Henry V (Prologue: 'O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend | The brightest heaven of invention') calls up the fact that the Charge of the Light Brigade took place on the same day of the year, 25 October, as the Battle of Agincourt. In the discussion of the charge and of Tennyson's poem at the time, there seems to be no reference to this fact; but was Russell in The Times , 14 November, recalling 'band of brothers' when he wrote of the 'band of heroes'? And when The Times in a second leader of 13 November quoted 'those gentlemen of England who live at home at ease', was this coloured by Henry V's speech before Agincourt: 'and gentlemen in England, now a-bed'? The claims for Drayton's 'Ballad of Agincourt' as a source for Tennyson's poem (it was suggested at least as early as 1872: Richard Hooper, Notes and Queries , 4th ser., 10, 338) might gain some support from the coincidence of the battle-day; Tennyson denied the source (Eversley edition, II, 369), but one of Drayton's stanzas has as its arching rhyme 'wonder' | 'thunder'. 9 John O.

Shannon, Jr., 'The Critical Reception of Tennyson's Maud ', PMLA , 68 (1953), 399, n. 14. 13 'Down' for 'up' and 'Oh' for 'O' are misquotations by Massey of the text in the Examiner , and he omits two of the last four lines. 14 Lady Tennyson's Journal (p. 54) records on 14 October, 'A letter from the Senior Chaplain (Crimea) asking for a thousand more copies of "The Charge."' The letter is printed in full in Materials , II, 111-113. 15 Memoir , I, 411. Willingham F. Rawnsley (in 'Personal Recollections of Tennyson—I', The Nineteenth Century and After , 97 [1925], 8) floated the canard: 'Ruskin, remonstrating and telling him that it was the key to the whole thing, got him to put it back'. 16 The proof copy of 'A New Edition' of Maud, and Other Poems , 1856, in the TRC has '[3rd ed]' written in pencil on the title page, and Thomas J. Wise ( A Bibliography of the Writings of Alfred, Lord Tennyson [1908, rpt. 1967], I, 131-132), alleging that a second edition was published in 1855, designates the 1856 volume the third edition. In fact, it was the second. The publisher's numbering, when he abandoned 'A New Edition' and put 'Eleventh Edition' on the title page in 1866, was correct (not off by one as Wise asserts), though there were several printings of the first edition, and though the preliminary advertisements bound in some copies of the first edition are dated July and in others August. Maud, and Other Poems sold rapidly in the first four months after publication (by 24 November 1855 Moxon was advertising the 'Nineth Thousand'— Athenaeum , p. 1377); but a second edition was not required until the end of 1856, and Tennyson did not send Moxon the revised text for the second edition until 11 October 1856 ( Lady Tennyson's Journal , p. 76). Details of the publishing history of the first edition are as follows. Moxon apparently first printed 3000 copies, but soon added another 2000, writing Mrs. Tennyson in a letter dated 'Monday', presumably 23 July 1855 (five days before publication on 28 July), '. . . as we have already received orders for upwards of 3000 copies of Maud, I have requested the Printers to strike off immediately 2000 copies more, and to keep the type standing' (TRC). On 1 August the Publishers' Circular (18, 305) announced that the booksellers had subscribed 'for upwards of 4000'. Next Moxon reported to Tennyson in a letter dated merely 'Saturday' that he had 'had 2000 copies more struck off of Maud and that we are now selling the sixth thousand' (TRC). This third printing raised the total figure to 7000 copies, and finally Moxon had to print additional copies that brought the edition to 10,000. In one of the later printings, perhaps by the third, Moxon had changed, as Mrs. Tennyson had directed by letter, two accidentals in 'Maud' and the colon to a semicolon in 1. 34 of 'The Charge', so that there was a second issue of the first edition. On 15 October the Publishers' Circular (18, 385) declared, 'Upwards of eight thousand copies of Tennyson's "Maud" have already been sold'. By the end of the year, as the publisher's account with the poet shows (TRC), 8517 had been sold and 62 review, author's, and complimentary copies had been distributed. In the first part of 1856 Moxon informed Tennyson, 'As we have still on hand 900 copies of Maud, we shall not, if I may judge by the sale for the last three months, require a new edition much before autumn' (TRC). In late May there was the discouraging word, 'We have I find still on hand upwards of 500 copies of Maud. . . . Business I am sorry to say is at present exceedingly dull and will not I fear be much better till winter' (TRC). Although on 20 December 1856, Moxon was still advertising the 'Tenth Thousand' ( Athenaeum , p. 1560), his account for 1856 records 1421 copies sold by 31 December, which exactly exhausted the first edition. Moxon's advertisement on 10 October 1857 ( Athenaeum , p. 1256) of Maud, and Other Poems , 'Second Edition' clearly rules out a second edition in 1855 and establishes that 'A New Edition', 1856, was the second edition. 17 See Edgar F. Shannon, Jr. and Christopher Ricks, 'A Further History of Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington', Studies in Bibliography , 32 (1979), 141-146. 18 In the discussion that follows, line references for early readings in the Historical Collation appear in square brackets; others are in parentheses.

See also Tennyson Research Bulletin , 2 (1973), 75, for a slightly variant text and the possibility of a different date [?29 January]. 22 Contrast Henry V (IV, iii), before Agincourt: Then shall our names, Familiar in his mouth as household words— Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester— Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red. 23 Tennyson failed to capitalize 'death' [37] in MS 3 and raised the lower case 'd', which he had first written, to a capital 'Death' (7, 16, 24) in MS 6 . 24 'Cossack and Russian' (34) did not appear in the text from MS 1 through the Examiner and superseded (E 1 , P 6 , MS 6 - 7 —) 'the Russian line' [34, 35] (P 6 —55); and 'Cossack and Russian' owed something not only to the thrill of the word Cossack in English, but also to Russell in The Times : 'The ground was left covered with our men and with hundreds of Russians, and we could see the Cossacks busy searching the dead'. 25 Tennyson failed to capitalize 'Light', essential to its being felt as a name, in lines 5 and 9 in MS 1-4,6 and in line 54 in MS 3-4,6 . 26 Tennyson briefly rescinded this repetition and replaced it with 'Honour the Light Brigade!' (MS 3-4 ), but thought better of it in time for Forster to restore it in P 3 . 27 The charge, in more than one sense, is lacking from the Examiner 's text: '"Take the guns," Nolan said' [6] (P 1 -E, E 1 -P 6 ). (There were other accidental and substantive variants (MS 1-4 , P 7 , 55)). The Times (Russell) had: '"There are the enemy, and there are the guns, sir, before them; it is your duty to take them," or words to that effect, according to the statements made since his death'. 'Or words to that effect' is admirably honest in a war-reporter; inconceivable as applied to the words of a poem and their effect. 28 See Cecil Woodham-Smith, The Reason Why (1953), pp. 237-242. 29 A line that stood in place of lines 16-17 carried a 'they' in MS 3-4 , P 2 ; and there was a 'they' in the last line of the poem in P 7 and the Maud volume (1855). 30 'Those that had fought so well' [45] (MS 1 —E, E 1 —55, MS 7 ) not only failed to manifest this simple supremacy of the pronoun 'They', but also might have implied an invidious distinction, as if 'Those that had fought so well' returned, and those others who did not return had perhaps not fought so well. 'They', because of its community and continuity with the ubiquitous 'they' of the poem, avoids this. 31 Although not perhaps so unfortunate as the earliest MS reading here (MS 1 ), indebted to Russell in The Times , '"There is the foe" he said', to which the only answer would have been ' Tiens ' or some Hotspur-like exasperation. 32 But 'our' is not so secure when Russell permits himself to say of the cannon-balls: 'Their flight was marked by instant gaps in our ranks'. 33 See also Emily Tennyson's postscript to the letter first sending Forster the poem, 6 Dec. 1854 (p. 4 above). 34 In The Times (leader, 14 November) 'under the eyes of the whole world', with no such reciprocity as Tennyson's repeated cohesive 'All'. 35 For variants involving the replacing of 'jaws' by 'valley', see Historical Collation, 4/5(1), 7; and for a 'Death' | 'Hell' variant (MS 1 ), see Historical Collation, 24. 36 Materials , II, 113. 37 Paradise Lost , I, 303, for 'Vallombrosa' recalled in the landscape of Hell; and VI, 576-586, for the Satanic artillery, with its cannons' 'mouths' that 'belcht'. 38 'Take you the guns' and 'Take the guns' [6] instead of 'Charge . . .' persisted in the text until P 7 . 39 To mark a copy of the poem with coloured inks, to bring out the repetitions and filaments, is a revelation. 40 Variants affecting stanza disposition and indenting may be found throughout; see Historical Collation, 1-4, 2, 4, 4/5(2), 4/5(4), 8, 12, 16-17, 17, 21, 26, 31, 36, 37-38, 37, 38, 42, 49, 52, 55. 41 For some time 'turn'd' [37] (MS 1-4 , P 2-3 ) instead of 'rode' (37) was a reading. 42 The line 'Tho' horse and hero fell' [22/23] had originally appeared in MS 1 and MS 3 , and Tennyson had deleted it in MS 3 . In MS 1 instead of ending in 'Death', line 24, as well as line 25, terminated in 'Hell'. 43 Tennyson may have been sensitive to this procession of numbers in The Times (leader, 13 November); 'Two great armies, composed of four nations, saw from the slopes of a vast amphitheatre seven hundred British cavalry proceed at a rapid pace'. 44 T. Wemyss Reid, The Life, Letters, and Friendships of Richard Monckton Milnes (1890), I, 512; 16 July 1855. 45 Stanzas I, II, III, and V all have two such lines without terminal punctuation; and VI, none. For the arrival at this circumstance in IV, see Historical Collation, 28, 32, 35, 37. Revisions affecting terminal punctuation may be found throughout the Historical Collation. 46 Audrey Tennyson, Hallam Tennyson's wife, noted that on 15 May 1890 at Farringford the poet 'said down the phonograph' 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' ( Works , 10 vols. [London: Macmillan, 1884-93], II, 223, in TRC— Tennyson in Lincoln: A Catalogue of the Collections in the Research Centre , comp. Nancie Compbell, II [1973], 2: No. 3650). The modern recording is a 33 1/3 RPM disc (1969), issued by the Tennyson Society. See also Bennett Maxwell, 'The Steytler Recordings of Alfred Lord Tennyson: A History', Tennyson Research Bulletin , 3 (1980), 150-157. 47 The dramatic immediacy of 'knew' is the more inescapable when compared to the enfeebled transitional (rather than urgently transitive) 'which' of Tennyson's enjambement, earlier in the poem as first published: 'For up came an order which | Some one had blunder'd' [4/5(3)-(4)]. Cf. the 'as' of 'Then they rode back as | Before they rode onward' [37] (MS 5 -P 6 ). This instance is possibly even worse than the 'which'. 48 Quoted in The Times (leader, 13 November). Woodham-Smith ( The Reason Why , p. 247) attributes it to the French General Pierre Jean François Bosquet (1810-61). 49 Tennyson originally wrote 'Not their's to. . .', 'Not theirs to. . .' [13-14] in MS 1 . His improvement is a matter of the positive force then given to the negative concept; the military mission is not just that it is 'not theirs' to make reply or question why, but that it is positively 'theirs not ' to do such things; as when it is said that if it is not your duty to do such-and-such, it may be your duty not to do it. 50 Emily Tennyson's inadvertent slip into 'do or die' [15] in MS 3 , Tennyson immediately corrected. 51 Tennyson originally wrote 'men &amp; horses' before changing the reading to 'horse &amp; hero' [22/23] (MS 1 ). 52 Memoir , I, 388. 53 The adjectives 'desperate' [32/33] (MS 1 —E, E 1 ) and 'strong' [34] (P 7 , 55), Tennyson did not retain. 54 'Scattered and broken' Russell wrote in The Times , but of the Brigade. 55 If 'wild' had not been qualified so, it could have been damaging (undisciplinedly wild ?), as in Tennyson's second thought 'Wildly' [23] (MS 2 ) for 'Boldly', in 'Boldly they rode and well' (23).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Title-Page Transcription and Signature Collation Reconsidered by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When in 1974 John Bush Jones put together an anthology of Readings in Descriptive Bibliography , dealing with some of the developments since Fredson Bowers's Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), he pointed out in his preface that there was nothing for him to include regarding the quasi-facsimile transcription of title pages and the formulaic recording of signature collation. It is true that less has been written on these subjects in recent decades than on other aspects of bibliographical description and classification. The reason, presumably, is that bibliographers have felt there was not much left to say. 1 These two features have been more frequently included in descriptions, and over a longer period of time, than the other elements that we now expect to find in a thorough description: many nineteenth- and early twentieth-century descriptions consisted of little else, and even in more recent years abbreviated entries have been likely to be limited largely to these two elements. There has thus been ample opportunity for the techniques in the two areas to be refined through practice and discussion, and most bibliographers probably regard the conventions that have emerged as more firmly established than those associated with any other part of a description. Nevertheless, a fresh look periodically at accepted conventions can be salutary; and in fact some further discussion of these matters seems called for at present. The nature of what needs to be said is rather different in the two cases, however. In regard to title-page transcription, the question is not so much what methods or conventions should be used in transcribing as whether transcription should be attempted at all. One reviewer in 1981 echoed a not uncommon sentiment in discussing Sidney L. Gulick's Chesterfield bibliography: "Is the transcription of the title-page in quasi-facsimile any longer necessary or defensible? So much more information and relative accuracy would be gained by photo-reproduction of title-pages, even greatly reduced in size." 2 This reviewer chides the Bibliographical Society of America, the publisher of the volume, for not producing "something a little more advanced bibliographically "—as if a technological advance, allowing photographic reproductions to be inexpensively produced ("the cost advantage of minimizing compositor's work has steadily increased"), were necessarily a bibliographical advance. Whether or not photographic facsimiles should supplant transcriptions cannot be so simply settled as some have imagined: the question involves the essential nature of bibliographical description, and it must be thought about in the context of the full range of techniques of quotation. What requires further discussion concerning signature collation, on the other hand, is the technique for recording certain kinds of detail, not the desirability of providing the collation in the first place. I am assuming that the importance of signature collation for books of all periods no longer needs to be argued. But perhaps I am wrong to assume so much, for bibliographies of twentieth-century books do still sometimes appear without collations, and one of our prominent bibliographers could say in 1970, "Collation by signatures is unnecessary for most contemporary books except in special cases." 3 It is perhaps in order, therefore, to say something further on this score; but the usefulness of signature collation as a bibliographical practice, at least under some circumstances, has not been called into question in the way that title-page transcription has. A few suggestions, however, have been made in recent years regarding the form of notation that should be used in certain situations, and a few more are worth considering. They do not add up to any major modification of the formulary of collation codified by Bowers in the Principles ; but they do show the results of continuing to think critically about the matter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The practice of title-page transcription in English bibliographical scholarship evolved principally during the first half of the twentieth century and was given its great exposition in Bowers's Principles . The modern tradition effectively began with Falconer Madan's work in the 1890s, 4 and it developed largely in the hands of A. W. Pollard, W. W. Greg, and R. B. McKerrow; 5 indeed, the conventions set forth by McKerrow in 1927 (in An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students , pp. 147-154) 6 are essentially those recommended, and described in much greater detail, by Bowers two decades later ( Principles , pp. 135-184). This standard system—which has been outlined more briefly in various books since then, such as Philip Gaskell's A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972) —is very simple in its basic conventions: all lettering, with its capitalization and punctuation, is to be transcribed, and all other printed images (rules, devices, borders, etc.) are to be recorded or described; the ends of lines are to be indicated; and typography is to be represented by any roman, italic, and black letter designs of a single size, no attempt being made to reproduce the design or size of the type of the original (except that two sizes of capital in a single line are to be represented by large and small capitals). Because the product of these conventions goes only part way toward providing a facsimile of the original, this system is often called "quasi-facsimile transcription"—a negative-sounding name that anticipates some of the objections raised against the system. If one accepts the value of this approach, Bowers's splendid account provides all the guidance one needs in matters of detail, taking note, in the process, of certain debates that have occurred about particular conventions. And a great many bibliographers over the years have in fact accepted this method of transcription; it must by now be one of the most widely employed conventions of bibliography. It has not gone unchallenged, however, and criticisms have been voiced nearly as long as the system, in its modern form, has existed. Those who have defended the system have, in many cases, actually invited the criticisms, for their arguments have not always been very convincing. The two principal reasons that have generally been advanced for using quasi-facsimile transcription are that it enables the reader to visualize the typographic layout of the title page and that it provides details useful for distinguishing different editions or printings of the same work. Another, more practical, reason has sometimes been mentioned as well: that transcription is less costly than photographic reproduction. The flaws in these arguments are transparent, and if there were nothing more to be said in favor of quasi-facsimile transcription it should be abandoned without further discussion. What seems curious is that neither the advocates nor the detractors view the subject in relation to the larger question of the function and methodology of quoting, 7 and indeed the nature of descriptive bibliography itself. As a result, the former group has not been able to mount a very strong defense, and the latter has felt that demolishing certain limited arguments was sufficient for discrediting the whole undertaking. The argument that transcription costs less than reproduction is now largely outmoded, for inexpensive methods of printing illustrations of title pages exist. 8 Even before such methods were readily accessible, the financial argument was not always valid, as J. M. Osborn pointed out in one of the more impassioned attacks on quasi-facsimile transcription, in his review of Hugh Macdonald's Dryden bibliography: "if," he said, "a proper allowance is made for the time spent by the compiler in transcribing a title leaf, in checking and rechecking it until the final revised proof, the computation of cost would be very different from the mere expense of reproduction." He concluded that "the use of quasi-facsimile transcription in published bibliographies will soon be generally recognized as an anachronism." 9 The assumption underlying such arguments is that transcription is a makeshift substitute for photography, attempting to perform the same function but not succeeding very well. If that were true, then naturally the easy availability of photographs would render transcriptions obsolete. But to say no more is to take a superficial view of the matter. Yet the technical advances in the printing of illustrations have been more responsible than any other factor for the increasing criticism of quasi-facsimile transcription. The use by the Pall Mall Bibliographies (since the first volume in 1972) 10 and by the Pittsburgh Series in Bibliography (since the second volume, also in 1972) of title-page reproductions instead of transcriptions provides but two prominent examples of a growing trend. 11 If there are reasons to retain transcriptions, they are surely not the ones usually cited. No one can defend the idea that transcription allows one to visualize the title page in any precise way: all one has to do is imagine some of the typographic variations that would be rendered identically in transcription to see the point. 12 Even Madan in 1893 asked, "who has ever yet, by his description, created, in the mind of a reader, an adequate impression of the appearance of successive title-pages throughout a bibliography?" (p. 92). 13 Similarly the notion that transcriptions enable users to identify editions or impressions is on the face of it doubtful: neither would photographs accomplish this purpose, without the supporting detail provided in the other parts of a full description, for identity of title page obviously does not establish identity of the whole book. The importance of title pages for identification has often been greatly exaggerated, and other evidence correspondingly undervalued. 14 In any case, identity (or difference) of title page cannot be determined with certainty by means of transcription. In the most notable criticism of quasi-facsimile transcription, David Foxon makes similar points, leading up to them with a historical investigation (in his Howell and Zeitlin &amp; VerBrugge Lecture for 1970, Thoughts on the History and Future of Bibliographical Description ). He traces the origin of title-page transcription to Edward Capell's Prolusions (1760), in which the line-ends of a title page are marked with vertical strokes and its use of roman, italic, and black letter followed, except that large and small capitals are always used instead of full capitals. Foxon stresses Capell's eccentricity and crankiness and concludes that Capell's style of transcription "seems to have been born of his typograhical ingenuity, probably reinforced by an antiquarian interest in the appearance of the original title-pages" (p. 13). Because Capell's catalogue of Shakespeare quartos (1781) does not place editions of the same play together, Foxon asserts that Capell "did not think of his system as useful for distinguishing editions." He makes the same points when he turns to the work, a century later, 15 of Madan, Pollard, and Greg. "Madan's primary concern," he says, "was to enable the reader to visualize the appearance of a title-page," and Madan actually preferred photography for this purpose; when Madan talked about identifying different editions he referred to other techniques (noting the last words on certain pages and the positions of signatures in relation to the text above them), not to title-page transcription. Similarly, Pollard and Greg in their 1906 paper, as Foxon shows, were interested in providing a means to give the reader of a bibliography a mental picture of title pages; "there is no suggestion," he adds, "that the object of detailed title-page transcription is to bring to light concealed editions or variants which is the chief argument for its use today" (p. 17). At the end of his historical excursus Foxon wonders "whether quasi-facsimile description did not become popular with bibliographers just because xerox copies were not then available, and they felt the need of some equivalent for a title-page that they could take with them from library to library—whether or not it was effective in identifying variants" (p. 20). The historical aspects of Foxon's discussion are of considerable interest: we have too few studies of the history of bibliographical conventions. But his historical account appears not to be disinterested, for it seems slanted to lead the reader to the conclusion that title-page transcription is both anachronistic and unhelpful. The origin of such transcription, he hints, is suspect: both Capell and Madan had "an addiction to the ingenious convention," and "it is to this addiction that we owe quasi-facsimile" (p. 18). Furthermore, anyone who now argues that transcriptions are useful for identifying editions is simply providing "another example of the rationalization of an existing practice" (p. 17). Whatever position one takes regarding the value of quasi-facsimile transcription, one is bound to be puzzled by this attempt to link its history with a questioning of its current utility. What the inventors and other distinguished practitioners of quasi-facsimile transcription believed it accomplished—though undeniably of interest—is irrelevant to the question whether it can now be sensibly defended. To find value in a practice of the past for reasons different from those previously used to justify it is not necessarily to "rationalize." (Besides, in the case of quasi-facsimile, what would be the motivation to rationalize? Does anyone really have a vested interest in it?) Foxon takes note of this point in a limited way: he asks, "even if quasi-facsimile was not originally intended as a means of distinguishing editions, is it valuable for that purpose?" (pp. 18-19). He then examines the entries in Greg's Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration , finds that "only in three cases out of about a thousand is quasi-facsimile transcription necessary to distinguish editions, and in three further cases it fails to do the job," and concludes that "the total score does not provide a very convincing argument for the practical utility of quasi-facsimile as a means of distinguishing editions." This result is hardly surprising; indeed, it is obvious, even without a laborious investigation. No doubt there is much truth in the idea that early bibliographers, at a time when photographs were costly and Xerox copies unavailable, "felt the need of some equivalent for a title-page"— despite the lack of logic of their carrying a transcription from one library to another "whether or not it was effective in identifying variants." But regardless of what the early bibliographers thought about the role of transcription as a substitute for photography, everyone today understands, without the need for argument, that good photographs or Xerox copies provide better representations of title-page layouts than transcriptions normally do. So Foxon's criticism of quasi-facsimile transcription—limiting itself to two interrelated questions, whether transcription enables one to visualize title pages and whether it permits one to distinguish editions—amounts only to stating the obvious. It is hard to see what he accomplishes by stopping at this point, having attacked arguments that no one could seriously defend. An effective consideration of transcription must take into account factors other than these. At the outset, one must recognize, as Foxon does, the value of photographs. Any bibliographer would be foolish not to take advantage of available technology. Since good reproductions of typographic title pages 16 can now be included with relatively little trouble and expense in the printed sheets of a bibliography, there is every reason for doing so, and the resulting bibliographies will be the better for it. Xerographic copies are somewhat less desirable than photographs unless the slight alteration in size often inherent in the process is eliminated by an appropriate adjustment. 17 After all, a considerable part of the value of a title-page reproduction is lost if it is not presented in its actual size. One can (indeed, must) report the dimensions of the original, but a significantly reduced (or enlarged) reproduction is of questionable utility, because the qualities that a typographic layout has in one size may be altered when it is mechanically contracted (or expanded). 18 Leaving the matter of size aside, one still encounters, more often than seems possible, the naive belief that photographic and xerographic reproductions are necessarily truthful and accurate. This is not the place for a full discussion of the limitations of reproductions—a subject that has enormous implications for all scholars, indeed all readers. I shall simply say here that bibliographers, of all people, ought to be particularly aware of the problem. They should understand the many ways in which a reproduction may misrepresent the original, either because some blemish results from the reproductive process 19 or because some feature of the original (such as inking on the verso or the blind impression of a type that was not properly inked) shows up in a misleading way or does not show up at all. 20 Obviously any reproduction, whatever the process, should be carefully proofread, at the latest proof stage, against the original; and any problems it poses—if they are not correctable by making a new reproduction—should be pointed out in notes. 21 Reproductions of title pages handled in this way are certainly an asset to any bibliography. But the decision to include title-page reproductions in a bibliography really has nothing to do with the question whether to provide transcriptions. The two represent fundamentally different approaches to the representation on paper of a physical object; these approaches are complementary, and one does not necessarily obviate the other. A reproduction offers a two-dimensional visual representation of a three-dimensional object, or certain parts of it, whereas a transcription gives a detailed account in words. The basic task of bibliographical description, as the word description suggests, is to provide a verbal account—a set of statements about a book, not a set of photographs or depictions of it. Clearly the two are complementary, for the verbal account may be clarified by supplementary illustrations, just as a set of photographs (of a title page, certain other pages, endpapers, binding, and so on) would leave much to be desired if it were not accompanied by annotation. The notion that a reproduction of a title page renders a transcription unnecessary implies that the real purpose of the "description" is to present pictures of the object under consideration; if so, all the other features of the book ought to be presented pictorially as well, even though comments in words might often be appended. Carrying this approach to its extreme would result in a facsimile of the entire volume, including photographs of the binding, endpapers, and the like. Such a facsimile would have its uses; and if it were accompanied by appropriate and thorough annotation, its contribution to historical scholarship could be substantial. But that contribution would be different from what a bibliographical description accomplishes, unless the annotation amounted to a full descriptive account, not limited to the one copy reproduced or to the one impression represented by the reproductions. Full facsimiles serve a function (despite the risks inherent in reproduction) in making conveniently accessible the texts of certain copies of books; but they leave untouched the job of description. 22 A scholarly study that describes and analyzes the physical form and the printing and publishing history of a group of related books—which is what a bibliography is—has a value that is not diminished by the availability of photographic means for reproducing the pages of particular copies of books. The job of descriptive bibliography —making certain kinds of statements about books—is simply not accomplished by presenting pictures instead of an account in words. A picture may supplement, illustrate, even clarify, the words but does not render them superfluous; anyone who thinks that it does fails to comprehend how a scholarly historical study—such as bibliography—works. This point would be so even if copies of a single impression of a book could be produced as identical objects. But "identical" manufactured objects are in fact not identical. Every copy of a given impression of a book is different—however slight the differences may be—from every other copy. Some of the differences may normally be irrelevant to the bibliographer's concerns: irregularities in the weave of the binding cloth, for instance, or variations in the glue. Others, such as textual variants and cancels, are always relevant. A bibliographical description, like any other historical account, must—if it is to be a sound piece of scholarship—be based on a thorough examination of the evidence. The resulting product is not a description of a single copy but an account that encompasses, and arranges in a meaningful way, all the variations that appear relevant to the bibliographer. A picture of a title page, or any other part of a book, represents only a single copy and is therefore fundamentally different in scope from a verbal description. At best, the picture reproduces one piece of evidence on which the description is based. As such it is a useful adjunct to a description, but it cannot be the equivalent of a description—not only because verbal accounts are different from depictions but also because the verbal description is not an account of a single copy. 23 When one speaks of "the first edition" or "the first printing," one is using collective terms that refer to groups of individual items. Each of those items is a distinct piece of evidence, and no one of them can fully represent the group as a whole. Photographic reproductions can depict, with varying degrees of accuracy, title pages or other parts of an individual item; but a consolidated account of "the edition," or of "the title page of the edition," encompassing any variations among copies, must be made in words, for it is an abstraction and thus not photographable. 24 Variations among copies come about in two ways. The kind just discussed emerges from the manufacturing process: such differences were therefore present in copies when they were released to the public and are the bibliographer's business to record, for they are part of production history. But variations among copies as they exist at present also result from the post-publication history of each copy, from the varying treatment to which each copy has been subjected. These differences— such as a custom binding on one copy or the stub of a ripped-out half-title in another—do not enter into the historical account that the bibliographer constructs. It is to emphasize this distinction that the term "ideal copy" is employed by bibliographers as an indication of the object of a bibliographical description. The bibliographer attempts to describe "ideal," rather than actual, copies in order to eliminate from the account features of the surviving copies that were not present in those copies at the time of their publication. 25 In his discussion of the importance of quasi-facsimile transcription, Bowers points out, "In the case of some rare books, it is only possible to reconstruct the title from a comparison of several mutilated copies" (p. 136). This is of course a special case, but it illustrates the way in which a description must rise above the peculiarities of individual copies. Whether a seeming defect in a title page in fact emerged after publication is not always immediately apparent, but the bibliographer must come to a conclusion about the matter. The surviving copies of a book constitute the body of evidence the bibliographer has to work with, and a central part of the assessment of that evidence must be to determine how it has been affected by post-publication events. The fact that copies of books—from all periods—do vary from one another (however the variations are to be explained) provides a practical argument for the inadequacy of photographic reproductions as substitutes for verbal descriptions. And this practical argument only reinforces the theoretical one: that the presentation of raw data—which the reproduction of a title page from a particular copy is—produces a fundamentally different kind of work from the one that a descriptive bibliography aims to be. 26 These arguments, I should repeat, do not lessen the value of reproductions as illustrative matter; they speak only to the point that reproductions cannot serve as substitutes for descriptive accounts in words. Within those descriptive accounts, the function of title-page transcription has sometimes been misconceived, because it has often been linked with the identification of particular impressions or issues. But the question of how successfully quasi-facsimile transcription can be as an identifier is not the basic question. One should instead ask whether every element in a bibliographical description must justify its presence by its usefulness for identification. The whole history of the development of descriptive bibliography can be seen as a movement away from the limited notion of a bibliography as a statement of identifying points and toward the concept of bibliography as historical record. 27 In a scholarly historical description, one includes whatever details seem relevant to the particular description, given its defined scope, whether or not those details are necessary for identification: description is more inclusive than identification. Like any other historical account, a bibliographical description is made up of direct quotations and of statements by the writer of the account, the proportions of the two varying according to the judgment of the writer. Once we recognize that verbal description and photographic reproduction are distinct approaches, with different goals, and that quotation is an effective tool in description, it seems natural that quotation of a title page should be a standard element in a bibliographical description. Other quotations are likely to occur as well, however, and whatever one says about title-page transcription must apply to the whole body of quotation in a description, of which the quotation of the title page is only one part, though obviously a prominent one. 28 Some bibliographers wish to quote copyright notices, or printers' imprints, or sectional titles; others do not. But whatever is quoted, the quotations are part of the rhetoric of the description as a whole; and, like the other parts of the description, they are not tied to the defects or peculiarities of particular copies, 29 nor do they necessarily serve to identify particular impressions, issues, or states. Prescribing explicitly just when quotations ought to be made is not feasible; as in other historical writing, that decision would vary with the material and with the spaciousness of exposition contemplated. But something more can be said about the standards to be followed in quoting, when one does decide that a quotation is called for. What "accuracy" in quotation means, after all, is not self-evident: one can be accurate at various levels of detail, and the crucial issue is to determine which details are relevant for one's purpose. The conventions even of ordinary quoting have not remained constant over the years. Prior to the twentieth century, quotation marks were often found enclosing indirect quotations, paraphrases, and approximate quotations. At present, we expect material within quotation marks (or otherwise identified as a quotation) to repeat accurately the wording, spelling, capitalization, italicization, and punctuation of the original; but we do not assume that it reproduces the type designs and sizes or the lineation of the original. Quasi-facsimile transcription is a more inclusive convention of quotation, in which more features of the original typography and layout are quoted than in "ordinary" quotation. 30 Some aspects of this convention are fairly well established, and others remain open to variation. There is widespread agreement, for example, that type designs and specific type sizes are not comprehended in the convention and that an indication of line endings does belong in it; but on a matter such as how precise to be in the reporting of typographic rules, practice varies (a rule may simply be noted, or its relative length may be stated, or its measured length, accurate within a specified tolerance, may be recorded). Each bibliographer will have to decide, and announce in a preface, what standards of transcription are being employed in a given instance. 31 Bowers has already gone a long way toward establishing appropriate standards; but anyone is free to modify them, or indeed to be more demanding in the details for inclusion, so long as the operative conventions are always made clear. The overriding point is that some form of quotation paying special attention to typographic matters is appropriate in a bibliographical description, which by definition is concerned with the physical presentation of texts. It is irrelevant to protest that quasi-facsimile transcription does not reveal certain characteristics of the original. Recourse to the original will always be required for some purposes; but quotation—with whatever limitations are entailed by the conventions adopted—serves a purpose in any historical account, and in a historical bibliographical account it makes sense to quote in a way that recognizes the concerns of bibliography. Whether it is ever really defensible to quote without taking lineation and other physical points into account is a separate question, and a more important one. The ordinary approach to quotation assumes that intellectual content can be separated from physical form, and it proceeds to define some typographical features (e.g., italics) as textual, because by convention they suggest meaning, and others (e.g., type design and line endings) as nontextual, because presumably they play no role in meaning. But what bibliographers have been elucidating for a century is the way in which the physical aspects of textual transmission affect what is transmitted. One cannot seriously envision in any near future the mass conversion of the reading public to an understanding of this truth. For practical purposes, therefore, it will be necessary for some time to continue quoting in ordinary discourse as if this insight had not been achieved. The fact that it has, however, imposes certain obligations on those who understand it. For one thing, they cannot simply quote from one copy of one edition of a work, without checking other copies, and editions as well, to see whether there are variants in the passage; quoting is like preparing to undertake an edition, for one must be cognizant of textual problems in the text of what is being quoted. A second obligation is that, whenever one has the proper audience, one should quote in such a way as to report the physical evidence that one deems likely to be relevant to understanding the text or the history of the production of the book as a physical object. The pages of a descriptive bibliography are certainly one place where quasi-facsimile quoting is appropriate. Another is any article or book of analytical bibliography or textual criticism, or any essay attached to a scholarly edition. Some scholars who understand this general point have decided to provide passages of text in photographic reproduction from the edition cited—a practice that has recently come to be known as "photoquoting." The term, like the practice, is useful, so long as it does not lead readers into thinking of photographic reproduction as one further step in the continuum of quoting. It cannot be placed in the same scale, since it is fundamentally different. Some bibliographers who have substituted photographic facsimiles of title pages for quasi-facsimile transcriptions have similarly reproduced portions of other pages, such as copyright notices, as a way of quoting them. But whether one is dealing with a copyright notice, a passage of text, or a title page, the distinction between quotation and reproduction remains the same. 32 A photographic reproduction—of a whole page or of a few lines—is often a valuable addition to a discussion—especially when certain physical characteristics are the subject of that discussion (as they no doubt ought to be more often than is commonly understood). But such a reproduction can only be an illustration supplementing the text, because the physical features of the original appearance of the cited passage, even if they are what is being discussed, cannot themselves determine the physical presentation of the new discussion or of quotations within it. The distinction between the visual evidence reflected (in whatever degree of accuracy) in a reproduced passage and the typographic design and layout of one's own writing and quotation is not a trivial one: it reinforces, and in no sense denies, the connection between physical presentation and intellectual content. A previous instance of such connection cannot be recreated except as an exhibit, which exists independently of whatever context it finds itself placed in. The practical consequence is that anyone who photoquotes should always identify the particular copy used, recognizing that such an illustration is limited to the representation of a single copy. And anyone who quotes in reset type, whether in quasi-facsimile style or in the ordinary way, should be reasonably satisfied that the quotation to be used does not vary among copies of the edition. 33 Quotation (as distinct from reproduction) serves an irreplaceable function in historical discourse, and quasi-facsimile quotation (in some form) is more appropriate than ordinary quotation in those pieces of historical research that are particularly bibliographical in character. That is really the only point that needs to be made about quasi-facsimile transcription. The use of photographic reproductions in bibliography is certainly to be encouraged; but to imagine that the presence of such illustrations has any bearing on when to use, and when not to use, quasi-facsimile quoting is seriously to misunderstand the nature of historical writing, and therefore of descriptive bibliography.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II If one of the purposes of bibliographical description is to provide an account of the physical makeup of books, a basic element in it must be an indication of the way in which the printed sheets were folded and in which the series of sheets (and partial sheets) constituting a book were gathered together. It is hard to see how any element in a description is more central than this report of the succession of gatherings, for it is the basic statement of the structure of a book. The nineteenth-century incunabulists came to recognize this point; but those persons who began in the 1880s to produce checklists of modern authors thought of their work simply as providing guides for the identification of first printings, and they saw no need to record details not known to vary and therefore presumably not necessary for identification. 34 Some bibliographers of modern books quickly outgrew this superficial approach. Thomas J. Wise, for example, was noting signatures in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century books by 1901; 35 and in the 1920s Strickland Gibson recommended signature collations as a standard part of descriptions of post-1800 books, except for the most curtailed entries. 36 But traces of the old view have lingered on and are still with us. There are some bibliographers, sophisticated in other respects, who believe that certain details, notably signature collations, can be dispensed with for most modern books. In taking such a position, they are surely not claiming that modern books are simpler and more regular than early books, for their experience must have shown them otherwise; the explanation must be that, in some respects at least, they are harking back to the outmoded notion of a bibliography as a list of points for identification. They cannot have given adequate thought to the nature of descriptive bibliography as historical scholarship. Whether or not one has discovered a variation in a gathering that identifies a separate impression, one must recognize that a record of gatherings may enable someone else to discover such variation and in any case provides a historical description of how in fact a given book was constructed. Naturally there are times when the scope of a work—as in the case of some short-title catalogues—prevents the inclusion of signature collations; but in those cases other elements of a description are eliminated as well. The scale on which a bibliography is constructed obviously determines how much can be incorporated into the entries; but the period dealt with does not in itself determine the scale. There can be no question that a report or collation of gatherings is essential to bibliographical description on all levels except the most severely abbreviated. Once the importance of accounting for the structure of the gathered sheets is understood, the next step is deciding how best to write that account. A statement in words is one possibility: Michael Sadleir, for example, in his Trollope bibliography (1928) used the form "A-N in sixteens." But when the situation to be described is more complex and irregular, the statement in words is likely to become correspondingly more cumbersome. The urge to devise a concise and formulaic way to report the matter is therefore an old one. Henry Bradshaw, for instance, in a letter of 1 March 1864 to J. W. Holtrop, says that he has "long had the habit of using a fraction to represent the number of leaves and form of a quire"—thus representing a quarto book of five gatherings in eights as "abcde8/4" (the fraction showing that each gathering is made up of two sheets). 37 By the end of the century a somewhat different basic formula —the one we still use—had become standard. (One finds it in the early volumes of the Bibliographical Society's Transactions , as in W. A. Copinger's "Incunabula Virgiliana" in the second volume, for 1893-94, pp. 123-226.) In this system a series of regular gatherings is noted inclusively, without specifying each one individually, and the number of leaves in each of those gatherings appears as a superscript figure (e.g., "A-E 8 "); 38 the format (the number of leaves per sheet), which was the denominator of Bradshaw's fraction, is noted separately (either as a word, sometimes abbreviated, or as a number with a suffix or superscript "o," as in "quarto," "4to," and "4°"). 39 It was this system that Pollard, McKerrow, and Greg gave prominence to over the ensuing decades, 40 adding a few useful conventions in the process, notably two Greek letters: thus McKerrow suggested π (for "preliminary") to designate an unsigned preliminary gathering preceding a gathering signed or inferred as "A"; and Greg added χ (for "extra") to designate an unsigned gathering in the body of a book for which no letter (or number) of the regular sequence is available to be inferred. The simplicity of the system and the ease of remembering it carried the day. That the system is indeed simple should be emphasized, for unfortunately it is all too often regarded by those unfamiliar with it as complex and esoteric. The presence of two Greek letters, superscript figures, and plus and minus signs (for insertions and deletions) has led some people to think it is mathematical; and the fact that Bowers devotes more than fifty pages of the Principles (esp. pp. 196-254) to it has reinforced the view that it is a mystery requiring laborious study to comprehend. Bowers gives considerable space to the collation formula because his aim is to try to anticipate the various questions that might arise in practice as one uses it and to provide a standard point of reference where every detail is elaborated; but his own convenient appendix, "A Digest of the Formulary" (pp. 457-462), shows how uncomplicated the basic conventions are. 41 The value of a formulaic statement of signature collation is undeniable, for it makes an intricate or irregular book structure more readily apparent and easier to follow than an account in words would. 42 The fundamental rules of the system codified by Bowers—represented by a formula like "4°: π 2 A-C 8 χ 8 D 8 (D7 + χ1) 2χ 4 E 8 [F] 2 "—emerged from the main line of development in descriptive bibliography. Some of those rules (such as indicating the number of leaves in a gathering with a superscript figure) have now been in use in the English-speaking world for a century or so, and all (including the assignment of π and χ to unsigned and uninferred gatherings) have had a life of more than half a century. With these essential conventions so well established and with Bowers's thorough exposition of them available, it would be unwise at this point to tamper with them. They are simple, clear, and widely recognized; we should accept them as the basic grammar of the language of descriptive bibliography and proceed from there. 43 To accept these basic elements, however, is not to suggest that various extensions of the system should not be open to debate and further refinement. There is always the temptation to continue expanding a system of shorthand notation so that it covers ever more situations, and one cannot complain so long as the additional notation is compatible with the old, is kept as simple as possible, and fulfills a clear need. But one must always weigh the benefits of the new notation against the disadvantages of increasing the store of symbols and operations that must be learned. At some point what is gained may not counterbalance the loss in accessibility that results. The process of adding to the formulary after Bowers's codification of it has not been very fruitful, though some notable bibliographers have tried their hand at it—especially two bibliographers of botanical literature, Allan Stevenson in his introduction ("A Bibliographical Method for the Description of Botanical Books") to the second volume (1961) of the Catalogue of Botanical Books in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt , and Willem D. Margadant in his introduction to Early Bryological Literature (1968). And Greg and Bowers themselves made some suggestions, particularly in regard to additions and deletions, that need to be reconsidered. Whatever symbols and devices one is finally persuaded to use in one's own practice, the process of evaluating proposed conventions can, as I hope to show, serve to clarify the basic rationale of the collational formula. Insertions and deletions. Perhaps the principal element in the standard formulary that requires some rethinking is the method for indicating inserted and deleted leaves. This element is of course a significant one, for such irregularities in the structure of books occur with great frequency. The move from word to symbol for treating this matter lagged behind that for noting the regular conjugate leaves. Bradshaw used the form "g (3 wanting)" to show that the third leaf of the gathering signed "g" had been canceled; and McKerrow some sixty years later was still employing the same system, even though the basic formula and the method of referring to a single leaf had shifted—in the Introduction he cites "A-G 6 (G5 and G6 wanting)" as "the usual description" (p. 157). 44 It remained for Greg to substitute plus and minus signs for words in this system, 45 as well as to make a start on the problem of how to refer to insertions (since some are unsigned and others have anomalous signatures of their own). Bowers built his discussion on Greg's suggestions but provided much more detailed guidance for handling the great variety of situations that could occur. His analysis (pp. 235-251) is the most fully developed statement we have on insertions and deletions, and any further thinking on the matter must begin with it. The basic system is simple, and in its provision for cancellation it poses few problems. A minus sign preceding a reference to one or more leaves denotes cancellation, with periods used to join references to conjugate leaves and commas joining references to disjunct leaves: 46 A-B 4 C 4 (—C3) D 4 (—D2.3) E 4 (—E3,4) When a canceled leaf or leaves are replaced by leaves of identical conjugacy that are either unsigned or signed conventionally, a plus-minus sign can be used: A-B 4 C 4 (±C3) D 4 (±D2.3) E 4 (±E3,4) If the conjugacy of the substitution is different, the deletion and substitution must of course be treated separately: D 4 (—D1.4 + D1,4) E 4 (—E3,4 + E3.4) This much is straightforward. 47 The trouble largely enters in connection with insertions that are not replacements for canceled leaves. But it is adumbrated even in these simple instances of cancellation and substitution if the substitution is anomalously signed. In the standard formulary (see Bowers, p. 248), the actual signature of the substitution is used in such cases, and it is placed in single quotation marks if it might otherwise prove confusing: B 4 (—B2 + b2) C 4 (—C3 + '3') D 4 (—D3 + '* D2') E 4 (—E2 + 2E2) In this example the replacements in B and E need no quotation marks because they clearly represent actual signing, whereas those in C and D are quoted to call attention to the fact that the cited signatures are not misprints. 48 The potential for ambiguity is present here in the fact that the references following the plus signs in this formula are actual signatures, whether they are enclosed in quotation marks or not, whereas those after the plus (and plus-minus) signs in the earlier examples above (as well as those after the minus signs in all examples) are only positional indicators, not necessarily actual signatures. 49 Before pursuing this point, we should see the full dimensions of the problem by examining the notation for insertions. Even the simplest unsigned insertions can be handled two ways in the standard system: 50 C 4 (C3 + 1) C 4 (C3 + χ1) Of course the regular leaf preceding the insertion must always be named first in order to show the position of the inserted leaf. 51 In these two ways of indicating that gathering C contains five leaves, the use of "1" implies that (with the location of the insertion established) only the barest reference to the existence of one added leaf need be made, whereas the "χ1" treats the leaf as it would be treated if it fell between gatherings and no signature of the regular series were available to be assigned to it. 52 More complicated situations provide further alternatives, as illustrated by these two equivalent formulas derived from examples of Bowers (on pp. 239-240, 242-243): A-B 4 C 4 (C3 + 'C4',χ1) D 4 (D2 + χ1,2) E 4 (E3 + e3.1) F 4 (F1 + * F1.2) A-B 4 C 4 (C3 + 'C4' + 1) D 4 (D2 + 2) E 4 (E3 + e3.4) F 4 (F 1 + * F 2 ) In C, a second plus sign is needed if the second inserted disjunct leaf is to be referred to as "1" rather than "χ1"; in D, the two unsigned disjunct leaves can be noted simply as "2"; 53 in E, it is permissible to infer as "e4" the unsigned second leaf of the inserted fold, since the lower-case signature, established by the signed first leaf ("e3"), eliminates any confusion with E4; in F, the conjugacy of the inserted leaves can be indicated by a superscript "2", rather than by a period between the leaf references, since the first leaf of the fold is signed as a first leaf in a gathering. 54 That this standard formulary is analogous in some respects to a language, providing alternative ways of making the same statement, is not necessarily a defect. One can only agree with Bowers when he says, "Although a rigid system for marking inserted leaves can be devised, the most sensible practice is to permit a certain latitude according to the circumstances and the special problem involved, always with the emphasis on securing clarity and simplicity. However, certain basic principles should hold" (p. 237). One would certainly not wish to have a system so rigid that it could not be stretched to fit unusual situations; such rigidity is obviously self-defeating. On the other hand, a symbolic or formulaic statement must be unambiguous if it is to accomplish its purpose, and definite conventions must be followed. The difficulty is in drawing the line between productive and unproductive kinds of variation. For example, the fact that both "(C3 + 'C4',χ1)" and "(C3 + 'C4' + 1)" mean the same thing does not in itself produce any ambiguity, so long as one knows the rules and is consistent in one's own practice. 55 But since the two denote precisely the same situation, one may wonder whether the existence of these alternative forms offers any positive advantage to offset the slightly increased complexity of the system that undeniably results. In the case of the equivalence of "(E3 + e3.1)" and "(E3 + e3.4)", there is further doubt because of the greater complexity of the rules necessary to eliminate the potential ambiguity. The difficulty here springs from the fact that numbers attached to signatures (such as "E3" or "e3.4") generally make some reference to the position of the leaves so designated, whereas the "1" in "e3.1", though attached to the "e" in the notation, draws its meaning from a separate usage, that of unattached numbers to indicate the total of inserted disjunct leaves (such as the "1" in C and the "2" in D in the last formula above). Of course, one can explain that the "1" in "e3.1" simply means one unsigned leaf, rather than that the second leaf was signed "e1"—as a reader might otherwise think, since "1" is not the number the bibliographer would be expected to infer if no signature were present. And one can further explain the reason for this seemingly anomalous use of "1": if the first leaf of the inserted fold had been signed "E3" rather than "e3", one could not infer "E4" for the unsigned second leaf without producing confusion with the regular E4, and some other reference is needed. Whether "1" solves the problem most efficiently is a real question, since it involves a switch in usage that must be explained. As Bowers says, clarity and simplicity should be aimed for at all times; and one cannot help but wonder whether the standard treatment of insertions has not added an unwarranted complexity and a potential ambiguity into an admirably simple basic system. This doubt is reinforced by a consideration of the use of single quotation marks in the formula. Their function seems easily enough stated: they are used, in Bowers's words, "to enclose the signature of an insert ( a ) to indicate that the signature is anomalous in the gathering; ( b ) to distinguish a signed insert from a following unsigned insert with inferred signature" (p. 459). Nevertheless, I think it is fair to say that determining in practice when to use them is the most problematical aspect of writing a collational formula for many bibliographers and that interpreting the absence of quotation marks is often the most puzzling part of reading a formula. Some of the potential difficulties can be observed in these examples drawn from two formulas in Bowers's digest of the formulary (pp. 459-460): D 4 (D4 + D5) E 4 (E4 + * E5.6) G 4 (G4 + 'G5',G6) K 4 (K3 + 'K4') Q 4 (Q1 + * Q 2 ) R 4 (R3 + 'R3'.'R4') S 4 (S1 + s 2 ) The inserts in D, K, and R are all signed, even though the one in D is not in quotation marks. In K and R, the quotation marks are necessary to distinguish these anomalously signed leaves from the regular K4, R3, and R4. In D, no quotation marks are needed to indicate signing, because if the leaf were not signed, it would presumably be noted as "χ1" or "1". But there might still be a doubt in a reader's mind, since no quotation marks are present and since "D5", not conflicting with any other leaf in the gathering, would be inferrable. 56 The principle of inferring when no conflict results is shown in E and G, where the sixth leaf in each case is unsigned; the treatment of G leaves no ambiguity, but that of E might again raise doubts about whether the final leaf is signed. 57 In commenting on Q and S, Bowers explains that after Q1 comes "a fold with the first leaf signed * Q1" and after S1 "a fold with the first leaf signed s1 and the second s2". The fact that one cannot tell from the formula whether or not the second leaves of the folds are signed shows that these folds are being treated like the regular gatherings: in the main sequence of signatures with their superscript figures, the signing of individual leaves is not made apparent in the formula itself (but only in the statement of signing that follows). Yet for other kinds of insertions, and even for some folds (as in R), the attempt is made to specify the signing of every leaf. 58 The system is nonetheless workable as it stands, and I do not mean to suggest otherwise; I raise these points only in the hope that it can be made still simpler and clearer. What underlies these various complexities is the attempt to register within the collation formula the signatures of insertions and substitutions. That attempt introduces into the formula an approach that conflicts with one used elsewhere in the formula. The basic purpose of the formula, as ordinarily written, is to show the structure of a book and only incidentally to provide information about signing. 59 If the gatherings are signed, the clearest course is to use those signatures in the formula; but there is a limit to the amount of detail about signing that can be incorporated into the formula without making it unwieldy. Most bibliographers, following the standard system, do no more in treating the regular gatherings in the formula than to show which gatherings actually have signatures, reserving for an appended statement on signing a record of precisely which leaves are signed. Thus when one writes A—B 8 [C] 4 D—E 8 or A—B 8 C 4 D—E 8 one is saying no more than that the third gathering has no printed signature on any of its leaves 60 and that each of the other gatherings has the designated signature on at least one of its leaves (not necessarily the first). When it is necessary to refer to one of the regular leaves of a gathering, the reference is positional only and carries no implication about signing: "B 8 (—B5)" says only that the fifth leaf has been canceled (if no copies are known, its signature, if any, is obviously unknown), and "B 8 (B5 + 1)" says only that the insertion follows the fifth leaf (which might in fact be unsigned or even missigned). 61 For inserted leaves, on the other hand, the actual signature (or lack of signing) of each of them is normally indicated by the notation. 62 The result is that references following plus signs usually represent a different system from those preceding plus signs. This situation may invite misunderstanding; at the least it is awkward, reducing the elegance that one expects a formulaic statement to have. The issue is not whether certain information should be reported or concealed, but just how and where it should be reported. If the details of the signing of regular leaves are held for an appended record, should those of inserted leaves be similarly held? That bibliographers have not generally given this question an affirmative answer is a reflection of the extent to which they still think of the formula as a register of signatures. 63 If a gathering signed "B" contains an inserted leaf signed "b" or an inserted fold signed "†", those are in fact additional signatures, which a register of signatures would have to include. On the other hand, such insertions are subordinate to the gatherings of which they have become a part, and their signatures thus have a different standing from the signatures of the primary gatherings: they do not have a place in the main sequence of signatures except as they are attached to one of those main signatures. In order to show the structure of a book, of course, one must record insertions whether or not they are signed; choosing "χ" for an unsigned inserted leaf or fold, however, seems in some ways inappropriate, because it is treating an insertion in a gathering as if it were an independent gathering. Some such symbol as "χ" is obviously needed for an unsigned and uninferrable gathering, but for an unsigned insertion within a gathering no signature is required, since the leaf or leaves involved take their identity from the gathering itself; therefore assigning to such insertions a symbol that normally serves as a substitute for an actual signature implies a status for the insertions that they do not have. 64 Furthermore, when an insertion has an appropriate letter signature but is numbered anomalously—as when an inserted leaf between E2 and E3 is signed "E3"—quoting the anomalous signature in the formula is treating the inserted leaf differently from other leaves: the signature is not new (and thus does not call for mention even if one regards the formula as a register), and anomalous signing of regular leaves is not reported in the formula. Since the insertions have to be referred to in some fashion, however, one may ask why they should not be referred to by the signatures they actually bear, when they do bear them. Perhaps they should; but, if so, some other adjustments to the formulary ought to be made, so that a uniform approach would underlie all parenthetical elements in a formula. Not to distinguish in the formula (as now sometimes happens) between an inferred and a quoted signature reference betrays an indecision as to the function of the formula. These considerations suggest two directions for revision of the notation to be employed within parentheses. One is to use actual signatures whenever possible and always to differentiate references to actual from those to inferred signatures. Such an approach could take one of two forms: either placing all actual signature references in quotation marks (all signature references not quoted would be inferred) or placing all inferred signature references in brackets (all signature references not bracketed would be actual): 65 A 4 ( A 3 + '3 *') B 4 ('B2' + 'b2'.b3) C 4 (C3 + 'C3',1) A 4 ([ A 3] + 3 *) B 4 (B2 + b2.[b3]) C 4 ([C3] + C3,[1]) Both these forms 66 are unambiguous, but they are also rather awkward (the first less so than the second). 67 The gain in clarity is important, but the price paid for it makes neither of these solutions a happy one. Furthermore, this approach, even though it achieves consistency within the parentheses by specifying the signing of regular as well as of inserted leaves, fails to eliminate the split between parenthetical notation (which entails specifying the signing of individual leaves) and notation outside parentheses (which does not attempt to indicate how leaves are signed). 68 The other direction one could go, and I think a more promising one, is not to attempt at all to report actual signatures of leaves within parentheses. 69 The information provided would then be purely structural, the details of signing to be reported separately: A 4 ( A 3 + 1) B 4 (B2 + 1.2) C 4 (C3 + 1,2) χ 4 (—χ3) D 4 (±D4) This is indeed a simple system, and it could be made still simpler by eliminating the signature letters within parentheses: A 4 (3 + 1) B 4 (2 + 1.2) C 4 (3 + 1,2) χ 4 (—3) D 4 (±4) Whichever of these forms one uses (the second may seem too stripped-down to some people, though the repetition of the letter is unnecessary), 70 this approach still follows the pattern of the standard system for showing structure; 71 the established formulary has not resulted in any ambiguity in the reporting of structure but only of the signing of leaves, and here the latter function is simply taken away from the formula. One would have to turn to the separate statement of signing to learn, for example, that in the book represented by this formula the insertion in A is unsigned, the fold in B has the first leaf signed "b", the second of the inserted leaves in C is signed "c5", and the substitution in D is signed "* D4". The length of the statement of signing would be increased, but the formula would be shortened and simplified. And each would be clearer and more efficient by focusing consistently on a single function. No one would be likely to have any indecision about how to write or how to read the formula or the accompanying statement of signing. This ease of use—by both bibliographer and reader—would reflect the logic of the underlying conception. Reference notation. Any examination of the collational formula must give some attention to signature reference notation, for such notation is tied to, and takes its form from, the formula; 72 a revision in the system adopted in the formula may produce a change in the style of the reference notation. The function of signature reference notation is of course to provide a way of referring to a particular leaf or page in terms of the structure of the book; since references of this kind are widely employed in bibliographical discussion, the conventions governing their use are a matter of some importance. Most of the considerations involved in thinking about the formulaic notation of inserted leaves, as outlined above, are relevant here; the parenthetical parts of a formula, after all, make use of reference notation, since they refer to specific leaves. The standard system, set forth thoroughly by Bowers (pp. 255-268), begins with the printer's convention of identifying a leaf by attaching a leaf number to the signature of the gathering: the second leaf of gathering B, for example, becomes "B2". A superscript "r" or "v" can then be appended if reference is being made to the recto or verso page rather than the whole leaf. 73 This notation is taken to be positional only and does not indicate whether the leaf is actually signed (or missigned): "A4" means the fourth regular leaf of A even if that fourth leaf is unsigned or signed "A3". In assigning leaf numbers one must remember that only the leaves of the regular folded quires of a gathering (or substitutions for them) are counted: the last regular leaf in A 4 is A4, even if two further leaves have been inserted in A, giving it a total of six leaves. Obviously one cannot simply number the leaves of a gathering in a single consecutive sequence, ignoring deletions and insertions, for the reference notation would not then accurately reflect the place of the leaf in the structure of the book nor would it be consistent with the usage of the formula. There can be little quarrel with these basic rules. The treatment of inserted leaves, however, poses the same problems we have already noted in connection with the formulary. There is an additional consideration as well, for reference notation may be used at some distance from the formula (even in a separate discussion) and must provide for conveniently locating the cited leaf without constant recourse to the formula. In summarizing the standard approach, Bowers (p. 260) sets forth four ways of referring to an inserted leaf, illustrated by an insertion that would appear in a formula as "C 4 (C2 + * C2)": C(* C2) C(C2 + * C2) C2 + * C2 C2 + 1(* C2) The first of these does not make explicit the location of the leaf in the gathering and would necessitate reference to the formula for that information; the other three are therefore more appropriate for general use, especially if the formula is not at hand. Of course, since they are based on a formula that mixes positional notation with actual signatures, that mixture is present in these references. Leaving that matter aside, we are still likely to find their form rather cumbersome. Perhaps they could be simplified by observing two points: (1) since reference is being made to a leaf, not a whole gathering, and since a regular leaf of the gathering must be specified to locate the insertion, it is superfluous to state the signature of the gathering separately from the notation of the locating leaf, as in "C(C2 + * C2)" above, where the first C is merely repetitious; (2) the use of a plus sign that does not fall within parentheses (as in the last two examples above) awkwardly makes the notation look like a reference to two entities (an awkwardness that is compounded when a superscript "r" or "v" is appended to the second part of the reference). Applying these observations to this example gives us "C2(+* C2)" or, more simply, "C2(* C2)". Regardless of what system one decides to follow in the formula, these two principles should be considered in constructing references based on it. 74 If one does decide to adopt the formulary system proposed above (with notation that consistently focuses on position, not signing), references to leaves and pages are correspondingly simple. References to the inserted leaves (and their pages) in the following formula would take the form illustrated below it: A 4 ( A 3 + 1) B 4 (B2 + 1.2) C 4 (C3 + 1,2) D 4 (±D4) A 3(1) B2(1) B2(2) C3(1) C3(2) D4(±) A 3(1) r A 3(1) v etc. In the references, the figures in parentheses denote the first and second leaves following the leaves named just before the parentheses, and the plus-minus sign indicates that the leaf in question is a replacement for the one originally occupying that position. The identity of reference to the insertions in B and C shows that matters of conjugacy are not covered in references, their purpose being only to specify location in relation to the basic structure of gatherings. 75 This use of "2" to mean a second leaf in fact follows the standard system of reference; as Bowers points out (p. 260), the location of such a leaf should be stated as the second leaf after the preceding regular leaf (the position of which is obvious) rather than as the first leaf after the preceding inserted leaf (the position of which might not be evident without recourse to the formula). 76 References of the form suggested here are quite simple, requiring only single numbers in parentheses, and fully consistent with the formula, focusing on positions of leaves and not their signatures. Statement of signing. Some statement, outside the formula itself, is required in the standard system for specifying the signing of the regular leaves (or at least peculiarities in such signing), 77 since only the signing of the inserted leaves is indicated in the formula in that system. In the revised system proposed as a possibility above, a statement of signing takes on the role of dealing with the signing of all leaves, regular ones and inserted ones alike. 78 In either case the statement can be made concisely using signature reference notation (for the standard treatment, see Bowers, pp. 269-271). One established convention of reference notation that is particularly useful in the statement of signing is the dollar sign, which (as a form of "s," for "signature," not likely to occur as an actual signature) is used to stand for every—or, in some contexts, any—signature (as McKerrow suggested in the Introduction , pp. 157-158). Thus "$3" signifies the third leaf of every (or any) gathering. In the standard statement of signing, however, at least for pre-nineteenth-century books, "$3 signed" is used to mean that the first three leaves of every gathering are signed, requiring the inference that the leaves in each gathering preceding the designated one are also signed. It seems to me that an explicit statement would be preferable, particularly since so little extra space is required: "$1-3 signed" is scarcely more cumbersome, and it involves no special convention, other than knowing that the dollar sign is a generic signature. 79 Although the standard statement uses plus and minus signs to show exceptions to the basic pattern of leaves signed with the correct signature and leaf number—as in "$3(—C2; +H4) signed"—it generally employs words for other irregularities, such as "K2 misprinted as 'K3'". Interpretive words like "misprinted," however, seem supererogatory: it is enough to state how each leaf is in fact signed, and I think an equals mark could be used for the purpose ("K2=K3"). 80 Combining these two modifications of the standard statement of signing with the approach to reference notation suggested above results in the kind of statement illustrated below. Because a statement of signing needs to be seen in the context of the formula to which it refers, I take this opportunity to summarize my argument by setting down a formula and statement of signing constructed according to the standard system alongside those constructed according to the system I have outlined here: Standard system π 2 (π1 + †1) A-B 4 C 4 (C3 + 'C4', χ1) D 4 (—D2 + 2) E 4 (E3 + e3.4) F 4 (F1 + * F 2 ; —F3) χ 4 (—χ 2 + '3') G 4 (—G3,4 + G3.4) H 4 (±H4) I 2 Signatures . $3(—B2,D1,F2,G2,3; + B4,H4) signed; C2 misprinted 'C3'; D3 misprinted 'D' Proposed system π 2 (π1 + 1) A-B 4 C 4 (C3 + 1,2) D 4 (±D2 + 1) E 4 (E3 + 1.2) F 4 (F1 + 1.2; —F3) χ 4 (±χ2) G 4 (—G3,4 + G3.4) H 4 (±H4) I 2 Signatures . $1-3(—B2,D1,2,F2,G2,3; + B4,H4); π1(1)=†, C2=C3, C3(1)=C4, D3=D, E3(1)=e3, F1(1)=* F, F χ2(±)=3 In the second system, the single semicolon separates the account of the conventional signing of regular leaves (or substitutions for them) from the account of the irregular signing of such leaves and the signing of inserted leaves. Any leaves not mentioned in the statement of signing are unsigned. 81 Whether the statement should appear with the formula or as a separate paragraph later in the description (an option discussed by Bowers, p. 271) is not particularly important, although the statement would seem to fulfill its role most conveniently when it is adjacent to the formula. 82 What is important is that the functions of the formula and the statement be clearly differentiated, so that one can know without any hesitation what is located in each place. The proposed system may at times be less economical of space, 83 but it eliminates any ambiguity. Anyone who suggests alterations in a widely accepted convention should be mindful of the dangers of introducing confusion rather than clarification, and changes should not be proposed lightly. I have attempted here to remain within the standard system as much as possible and not to mention potential changes when I thought the benefits of the change would not compensate for the efforts involved in altering a functioning system. The changes I do suggest are, I believe, conducive to ease of use because they emerge from a simple and consistent distinction of function between a formula that delineates how a book is constructed and a statement that records the location of printer's signatures in a book. Indeed, no one who understands the established system would have any difficulty, even without receiving an explanation, in reading a formula and a statement of signing that employs the proposed plan. But whether this plan is accepted is less significant than understanding the reasoning that brought it about and the necessity for continuing to think critically about what we do. It takes many words to write about these matters, but the length of the discussions should not obscure the real simplicity of the collational formula, as it has developed over the past century. The aim of the formula, after all, is to facilitate communication between bibliographer and reader, not to place greater distance between them. There is nothing difficult or esoteric about collational formulas or their accompanying statements of signing; anyone who approaches them with an open mind and a basic knowledge of how books are constructed will understand them immediately. Nevertheless, one should not hesitate to attach explanations in words whenever one believes them necessary for clarity. The same point applies to the rules for quasi-facsimile transcription: guidelines serve their function only if they are employed thoughtfully, not mechanically. I hope that my comments in these two areas can serve in some degree to help clarify the essential purposes of quasi-facsimile quotations and collational formulas in bibliographical accounts. Intelligent use of conventions can follow only from a true understanding of the reasons for their existence.</field>

The designation of line endings had not been uncommon in the nineteenth century, but it was not generally accompanied by attention to typography. Madan's use of lower case and two sizes of capitals was a direct antecedent of the practice of those who came to have greater influence. A later statement of his approach to transcription appears (p. 56) in Falconer Madan, E. Gordon Duff, and Strickland Gibson, "Standard Descriptions of Printed Books," Oxford Bibliographical Society Proceedings and Papers , 1 (1922-26), 55-64. 5 For Pollard and Greg, see their "Some Points in Bibliographical Descriptions," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 9 (1906-8), 31-52; see also Pollard's practice in the first volume (1908) of the Catalogue of Books Printed in the XVth Century Now in the British Museum and Greg's in A Descriptive Catalogue of the Early Editions of the Works of Shakespeare Preserved in the Library of Eton College (1909). 6 McKerrow's work was an expansion of his "Notes on Bibliographical Evidence for Literary Students and Editors of English Works of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries," Transactions of the Bibliographical Society , 12 (1911-13), 213-318—which, however, did not take up the question of transcription. 7 The third Excursus (pp. cxxxi-cxlviii) of Greg's introduction (1959) to A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (1939-59) is entitled "Transcription and Quotation"; but aside from the association between the two implied by linking them in this title, no attention is paid to the relationship. Greg is primarily interested in establishing rules for transcription of title pages and for what he calls "bibliographical quotation" (which ignores typography, even italics), to be used in recording the contents of a book. His view that it is "pedantic" to use quasi-facsimile transcription in the contents paragraph has surely now been superseded (see Bowers, p. 291); but when quasi-facsimile is not used, there is a question whether his "bibliographical quotation" is preferable to ordinary quotation. 8 Madan foresaw this situation in 1893 (see note 4 above) and thought it should mean the elimination of transcription: according to the report of discussion following his paper, "The daily cheapening of photography made him hopeful that, in due time, the chief objection to the use of absolute reproduction in fac-simile would disappear" (p. 105). 9 Modern Philology , 39 (1941-42), 313-319 (quotations from p. 317); Bowers quotes a long passage from this review in his discussion of quasi-facsimile transcription (p. 135). Gallup (see note 3 above) also seems to believe that cost is the principal factor involved: "if the publisher can be persuaded to pay for easily legible photographic reproductions as illustrations, title-page transcriptions themselves would seem seldom to be essential" (p. 8). 10 Later in the series, as in A. F. Allison's Robert Greene (1975) and M. R. Perkin's Abraham Cowley (1977), the reproductions are supplied in microfiche in a pocket attached to the inside back cover. 11 If any argument on grounds of cost were now to be made, it would focus on the cost of paper, not photography. Photographic reproductions take up considerable space and can greatly lengthen a descriptive bibliography; there is little point providing illustrations of typographic matter unless they are the same size as the original. Even the editors of the Pittsburgh Series have decided to forego reproductions of title pages for certain categories of material (such as books contributed to by an author). 12 The bibliographer should know when such situations exist and annotate the transcriptions accordingly; but a bibliography should enable readers to identify variants unknown to the bibliographer. 13 In 1939 J. D. Cowley went so far as to say that, with exceptions for "special purposes," "we may now abandon quasi-facsimile, and adopt the rule that roman lower case, with initial capitals when necessary, is to be used for transcription" ( Bibliographical Description and Cataloguing , p. 56). 14 This point should be underscored, as it is in Bowers's "Purposes of Descriptive Bibliography, with Some Remarks on Methods," Library , 5th ser., 8 (1953), 1-22 (reprinted in his Essays in Bibliography, Text, and Editing [1975], pp. 111-134): "Please notice that what is in question is the whole book, and not just the title-page as the sole source of identification. . . . If we place such confidence in our ability to identify books by their title-pages that we fail to describe other matters in the more important body of the book, we are misleading a reader by providing him with insufficient information to identify an imperfect copy lacking the title, or by recording in a bibliography the presence of such and such an edition in a library when in fact it is a dangerous made-up bastard copy. If we are sincere in desiring to record the true details by which to identify books, let us deliberately describe books as if they had no title-leaves . . . there is more to description than identification, and more to identification than the title-page" (see esp. pp. 9-15 [119-126]). 15 According to Foxon, "After Capell's death, quasi-facsimile seems to have vanished from English scholarship for a century" (p. 13)—and Madan could therefore "put forward his system as novel" (p. 15). Foxon does, however, allude to Henry Harrisse's Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima of 1866; and other instances could be cited. The question is whether these occurrences are isolated innovations or whether they reflect a continuous tradition. 16 Title pages with illustrations are another matter: they are usually more expensive to reproduce well. 17 They are often less desirable anyway, especially when the types involved are large and heavy, for areas of solid black do not reproduce well by xerography. (In making adjustments, one should note that reproduction ratios do not always remain constant on a single machine.) 18 For example, see some of the small reproductions (as on pp. 96-97) in R. A. Sayce and David Maskell's A Descriptive Bibliography of Montaigne's Essais, 1580-1700 (1983), a bibliography in which reproductions supplant transcriptions. 19 Any spot that is touched up, to conceal a perceived blemish, is itself a blemish. The problems produced by retouching (as well as the peculiarities of individual copies) are mentioned by James Hardin in his able restatement of the importance of transcription, in "Descriptive Bibliography and the Works of Johann Beer," Wolfenbütteler Barock-Nachrichten , 4 (1977), 2-6. 20 Bowers, in his discussion in the Principles pointing out some of the advantages quasi-facsimile transcription has over photographic reproduction (pp. 135-137), mentions poor inking, flyspecks, and imperfections in paper as some of the characteristics of originals that could be misleading in photographs, and he warns readers of the dangers of retouching. Philip Gaskell, objecting to this argument, wrote a letter published as "Photographic Reproduction versus Quasi-Facsimile Transcription," Library , 5th ser., 7 (1952), 135-137. Gaskell says that it is the responsibility of the bibliographer to find copies for reproduction that are without blemish (and he maintains, incidentally, that "reproductions can be greatly reduced without losing their value"). One must naturally agree that the bibliographer has the responsibility to find unblemished copies, when they exist and are locatable; but Gaskell's discussion shows no awareness of the problems that still exist after one has obtained "a good photographic reproduction." Bowers replied to Gaskell in "Purposes of Descriptive Bibliography, with Some Remarks on Methods" (see note 14 above), arguing that photographic reproductions are "no such cure-alls that we can set up their utilization as a necessary or even as a generally desirable principle." He examines "the curious fallacy that the title-page is the most important single feature of identification that exists for a book," shows that photofacsimiles of titles provide some help for identification only when a reader has a copy that "differs from any that the bibliographer has seen and reproduced," and concludes—after describing the scholarly standards for descriptive bibliography—that "no mechanical process can act as a substitute for such standards." In A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972) Gaskell sets forth the established rules for transcription but also asserts that "there is often a case for dispensing with the laborious process of quasi-facsimile for any but short extracts from title-pages, etc." (p. 323). 21 Some bibliographies print what appear to be defective reproductions without explanation. For example, Joel Myerson's Emily Dickinson (1984)—which, as one of the Pittsburgh Series, uses title-page and copyright-page reproductions in place of quasi-facsimile transcription—contains a reproduction of a title page in which (in the copies I have seen, at least) the date is not legible (see p. 38); the copyright page in the facing illustration is difficult to read because of defective inking, and one is not told whether this defect is in the original or only the reproduction. 22 The function of facsimiles and standards for their production and annotation are sensibly discussed by Franklin B. Williams, Jr., in "Photo-Facsimiles of STC Books: A Cautionary Check List," Studies in Bibliography , 21 (1968), 109-130. 23 Illustrations have a different status, of course, in a bibliographical catalogue of a collection, where each entry does describe a single copy. But even there the distinction between a scholarly verbal account and a depiction still holds. Philip J. Weimerskirch, in "The Use of Title-Page Photography in Cataloging," in Library Resources and Technical Services , 12 (1968), 37-46, surveys the history of the idea of using photographs of title pages and describes instances of library cataloguing (or temporary cataloguing) in which such photographs have been employed; it is not his purpose, however, to pursue the distinction between photographs and verbal statements, or between photographs of single copies and generalized descriptions. 24 The problem of producing a facsimile of an entire book is analogous: if one wishes to make available to scholars a "facsimile of the first edition," how does one go about selecting a copy to photograph? Charlton Hinman, in preparing his Norton facsimile (1968) of the Shakespeare First Folio, recognized that no single copy would serve the purpose and selected pages from many different copies so as to represent the "corrected" text at points of stop-press alteration. The individual pages are of course those of particular copies, but the resulting facsimile as a whole is not identical with any surviving copy. In attempting to represent "the First Folio"—that is, a whole edition—it could not be limited to the characteristics of any individual copy. See also Fredson Bowers, "The Problem of the Variant Forme in a Facsimile Edition," Library , 5th ser., 7 (1952), 262-272. 25 See Bowers, Principles , pp. 113-123; and G. T. Tanselle, "The Concept of Ideal Copy," SB , 33 (1980), 18-53. 26 David Vander Meulen, in one of the most judicious assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of quasi-facsimile transcription and photographic reproduction, makes the same point: quasi-facsimile transcription, he says, "by reducing a physical object to words as the rest of a bibliographical description does, provides a standard form of the title page that can be more easily re-used and transmitted. Moreover, by presenting an ideal copy rather than a specific one, a quasi-facsimile can better convey the bibliographer's interpretation of ambiguous portions." See A Descriptive Bibliography of Alexander Pope's Dunciad, 1728-1751 (diss., University of Wisconsin, 1981), p. 44. Vander Meulen provides several telling examples of the way in which photographs (as well as transcription that falls short of quasi-facsimile) can be misleading. (His own practice in transcription, by the way, includes an indication of the measurement, to the nearest ⅓ millimeter, of the type faces employed.) 27 For one view of this shift, see G. T. Tanselle, "Physical Bibliography in the Twentieth Century," in Books, Manuscripts, and the History of Medicine: Essays on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Osler Library , ed. Philip M. Teigen (1982), pp. 55-79. See also note 34 below. 28 This view of title-page quoting as part of a historical account reinforces Bowers's point that the evidence from a title page is only one element in the total body of evidence supplied by the book as a whole (see note 14 above). 29 Even if what is quoted is a variant known in only a single copy, for the point of the quotation is not to represent this copy but to report that some portion (however small) of the edition or impression in fact contained the variant in question. 30 Bowers uses single, rather than double, quotation marks to distinguish quasi-facsimile transcription; the device is less effective for British readers, however, because of the more common use of single quotation marks in Britain for ordinary quotation. 31 For further discussion, see G. T. Tanselle, "Tolerances in Bibliographical Description," Library , 5th ser., 23 (1968), 1-12. Foxon says that if reproduction is rejected for transcription, "we ought to aim at scientific precision and record the size of the type in each line and the amount of space between one line and the next" (p. 18)—a statement that implicitly recognizes various levels of quotation but regards only one as defensible. 32 The practice of reproducing passages of text photographically is not new; what seems to be increasing is a tendency to think of such reproductions not as illustrations but as part of the text itself. The former approach is suggested in Hinman's The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963), for example, by the fact that the many reproductions of passages from the First Folio set into pages of Hinman's text are labeled as "figures," sequentially numbered and with captions. In contrast, some of the essays of Randall McLeod—to cite one scholar who has recently employed photoquotation extensively—incorporate reproduced passages, or even phrases, directly into the text in the way that reset quotations have always been used. There is no question about the appropriateness of the reproductions, for the typography of the original printing is in each case part of the subject under discussion. And one could say that it is only a stylistic matter whether one constructs sentences so that they can stand independently of illustrative quotation or whether one makes the quotations an integral part of the sentences. But a significant distinction is lost sight of if one believes that a reproduction—regardless of its importance for the discussion—can fit into a new text in the same way that a transcription can. The point is dramatized by the title of McLeod's essay in The Division of the Kingdoms: Shakespeare's Two Versions of King Lear, ed. Gary Taylor and Michael Warren (1983), pp. 153-193. His title (which may be rendered here as " Gon . No more, the text is foolish.") is photoquoted at the head of his essay but is converted to the standard typography of the volume in the table of contents and in the running heads. If McLeod photoquotes the title because he believes the original typography to be essential to the meaning, he has at the same time guaranteed that the title will generally be misquoted, because references to his essay in checklists, footnotes, and other essays will not normally accommodate the reproduced typography. (Of course, resetting the title would not be misquoting, according to the usual conventions of quotation, if the presence of the reproduction did not suggest that the typography is an inseparable element of the title.) The fact that photoquotation, whatever its extent, is not appropriate for some contexts may seem only a practical difficulty, but it clearly reflects a deeper issue. 33 If it does, the problem posed by the variation is itself likely to enter into the discussion, and specific copies in which the different readings can be found should of course be specified. 34 The role of the incunabulists in establishing modern descriptive bibliography is touched on in G. T. Tanselle, "The Evolving Role of Bibliography, 1884-1984," forthcoming in the proceedings of the Grolier Club Centennial Convocation. 35 See "Michael Trevanion," "Thomas J. Wise's Descriptive Formula," Book Collector , 13 (1964), 355-356; and Simon Nowell-Smith, "T. J. Wise as Bibliographer," Library , 5th ser., 24 (1969), 129-141 (esp. p. 132). 36 In Madan, Duff, and Gibson, "Standard Descriptions of Printed Books" (see note 4 above). Gibson recommended that the collation of modern books be treated like that of books of the "middle period" (1558-1800), for which Madan specified signature collation in the case of "important" and "interesting" books; for "ordinary" books he felt that signatures need not be noted except "in case of any complication" (p. 58). 37 Henry Bradshaw's Correspondence on Incunabula with J. W. Holtrop and M. F. A. G. Campbell , ed. Wytze and Lotte Hellinga (1966-78), p. 30 (other examples on pp. 31, 43-44). Bradshaw's "long" use of this system went back more than a year, for on 18 February 1863 he had explained it to Winter Jones: see "Letters of Henry Bradshaw to Officials of the British Museum" (ed. A. W. Pollard), Library , 2nd ser., 5 (1904), 266-292, 431-442 (esp. pp. 277-278; it is also illustrated in a letter of 8 January 1866 on pp. 288-292). 38 In the long subsequent history of this convention, there has been repeated debate as to whether these superscript figures can ever be odd; but there scarcely can be any doubt today that the formula serves best its function of showing a book's structure if such figures refer only to the leaves (necessarily even in number) that make up (or originally made up) the folded quires, with insertions and deletions to be handled separately. Greg sums up this debate in "A Formulary of Collation" (see note 40 below), p. 372 (309); and Bowers discusses it thoroughly, pp. 225-235. Gaskell ( New Introduction , p. 329) and Bowers (p. 434, speaking of nineteenth- and twentieth-century books only) would make an exception for 18° in 9s, since the format results in nine-leaf gatherings; but even here, one leaf must be disjunct, and writing "A 9 " does not show where that leaf is located. It would be preferable, I think, to write, for example, "A-M 8 ($4 + 1)." There have also been suggestions for incorporating further information into the superscript figures. One of Pollard's is mentioned below in note 45; another is the use of formulas like "A-G 8/4 " or "A-G 8.4 " to show a regular alternation between eight-leaf and four-leaf gatherings (a device still often employed). Alistair Elliot has more recently built on this device—in "Duplicated Signatures," Library , 5th ser., 25 (1970), 354—to suggest superscript figures separated by commas ("A-K 2,2 ") as a shorthand way of indicating regularly paired signatures in successive gatherings, as when A 2 is followed by *A 2 , B 2 by *B 2 , and so on. The difficulty with this practice is that, unlike Pollard's, the superscripts are here made to refer to a peculiarity of signing, not of gathering; yet information about gathering is the function of the superscripts, and a further note would be required to explain the situation. (A clearer device might conceivably be an ellipsis ["A 2 * A 2 . . . M 2 * M 2 "], which would distinguish this situation from that where a dash is conventionally used.) 39 Bradshaw himself moved to this system (which he was already using for references to format that were separate from signature formulas): see Francis Jenkinson's note on p. 278 of Pollard's edition (note 37 above). 40 As in Pollard's "The Objects and Methods of Bibliographical Collations and Descriptions," Library , 2nd ser., 8 (1907), 193-217, and the British Museum catalogue of incunabula (see note 5 above); McKerrow's An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927), pp. 155-161; and Greg's "A Formulary of Collation," Library , 4th ser., 14 (1933-34), 365-382 (reprinted in his Collected Papers , ed. J. C. Maxwell [1966], pp. 298-313), and the "Introduction" (drafted in 1942) to A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (see note 7 above), esp. Excursus IV, "Formulas of Collation," pp. cxlviii-clviii. 41 Elementary digests of the system also conveniently appear in Gaskell's New Introduction , pp. 328-332, and in Terry Belanger's "Descriptive Bibliography," in Book Collecting: A Modern Guide , ed. Jean Peters (1977), pp. 107-113. 42 Bradshaw, describing his system of signature notation in 1863, said, "It looks rather appalling at first, but it is so much the most convenient way of collating books—as you can see directly where the defect is in your copy" (Pollard's edition, cited above in note 37, p. 277). 43 In 1949, the same year when Bowers's book appeared, James G. McManaway stated the need for standardization of the formulary of collation, in Curt F. Bühler et al., Standards of Bibliographical Description , pp. 73-74. He was overstating the case when he said that "many variants are now in use, with the result that the printed collation of a book may be intelligible only to the man who wrote it"; but there is no doubt that Bowers's book has played a crucial role in bringing about widespread acceptance of a single standard. 44 He takes for granted the practice of referring to leaves by attaching regular (non-superscript) figures to signatures. (He is naturally not concerned with later books—generally American—in which the signatures are numbers; in such cases leaf numbers must be subscript figures to avoid confusion. Greg notes [ Bibliography , p. cxlviii] that some bibliographers find subscript leaf numbers, even with letter signatures, "more distinctive or more elegant"; but one must agree with him when he says, "I see no advantage in the practice"—though one could mention the insignificant advantage that leaf numbers would be treated the same way whether signatures were letters or numbers. See also "A Formulary of Collation" [note 40 above], p. 368 [300], where Greg says that using subscripts "suggests something recondite and obscures the plain meaning and origin of the notation.") 45 Pollard had earlier, in the British Museum catalogue of incunabula (see note 5 above), used plus signs attached to superscript fugures—as in "a-m 10 n 10+1 " (p. 59)—but this approach does not specify the location of the insertion. 46 As the following formula suggests, an irregularity in a gathering necessitates separating the gathering from the regular sequence; in Bowers's formulary, such a gathering "must not be linked with another gathering by a dash. A-D 4 (D4 + D5) is completely incorrect" (p. 237). Some writers have since questioned this point. Stevenson sees no ambiguity in such linking and uses it in the Hunt catalogue (e.g., entries 409, 417, 548). The objection to it is one of logic, for the parenthesis applies only to the last-named gathering, not to the whole sequence. Margadant (p. 23) carries Stevenson's point a step further and gathers all irregularities together in a single parenthesis at the end of a sequence of gatherings, as in "A-K 4 (±D2,—E4,—K4)." If the purpose of the formula is to show the structure of a book, sequence is all-important; and I do not believe one can claim that, for this purpose, such an arrangement "can be read more easily." 47 Although even here there is an alternative: the replacement in E, if unsigned, could be rendered "χ 2 " (see Bowers, p. 247). (But rendering it as "E3.4" does not necessarily mean that it is signed. See note 49 below.) 48 This use of quotation marks in effect provides an equivalent for "[ sic ]." Emphasizing that quotations are accurate, however, may seem a superfluous task for the formula. 49 This situation in regard to "E 4 (—E3,4 + E3.4)" is explained by Bowers as follows: "when there is no possible conflict between an inferred signing of a complete cancellans and the signing or completed signing of the original quire, the inference can be freely made in the formula without the necessity to indicate (except in the note on the signing) whether the cancellans signing was inferential in whole or in part" (p. 247). 50 Both Stevenson (p. clix) and Margadant (p. 23) express a preference for "χ"; but Margadant unwisely prefers to designate a single leaf with a superscript "1" (p. 22). 51 Such notation is purely positional: Bowers says, "The leaf of the regular gathering preceding the plus sign is used only to establish the position of the succeeding insertion and is never quoted, nor is any indication ever given whether it is signed or unsigned [or missigned]" (p. 237). 52 The conservative treatment advocated by Bowers (pp. 235-239, 241-242) for leaves between gatherings is certainly to be recommended: they should be regarded as independent members of the sequence of gatherings and not associated with the gathering before or after except when the link is definitely established, as with the same signature. 53 This system of noting the total number of inserted leaves is used only when the leaves are disjunct. (See Bowers, p. 240, where he warns against confusing such totals with quoted leaf numbers.) 54 If it were signed as a later leaf reference, such as "*F2", the superscript could not be used, for one cannot have such a notation as "*F2 2 ", which seems to combine reference to a leaf and to a gathering. 55 Failing to be consistent might create ambiguity by implying that the two usages had different signification. 56 This doubt would be eliminated if the reader remembered, and had reason to think the bibliographer followed, Bowers's rule that signatures of inserts "are ordinarily inferred only when an unsigned leaf follows a signed leaf which is itself an insert and when the signature does not conflict with or duplicate the signatures or completed signatures of the original gathering" (p. 459). 57 The fact that "* E5" is an actual signature should be evident even without quotation marks. 58 Writing "* Q1.2" and "s1.2" instead would make the signing of the second leaves no clearer. On the analogy of "e3.1" above, presumably one could write "* Q1.1", with the same attendant problems. 59 Bowers's discussion at various points makes this clear. On p. 246, for example, he speaks of the "essentially positional nature of formulary construction": in "C 4 (C3 + 'C4')", he points out, "the main feature of the construction is the indication of position"; thus the "identification by printer's signature is not essential but only a convenience for helping the reader to understand that the signed insert must not be mistaken for true [C4]." The same point can be made about inferential signing, which "is not of crucial importance in the collational formula" and which is usually adopted only if it provides "superior convenience for reference." He concludes, "The general trend of formulary notation towards reliance on positional notation makes for conservatism of inference." One might add that this trend carried to its logical conclusion would result in no inference at all (and no quotations of actual leaf signatures either). (See also p. 495.) 60 Square brackets and italics (suggested by Greg in "A Formulary of Collation" [see note 40 above], p. 369 [306]) are equivalent ways of designating inferred signatures. (See also note 66 below.) 61 The silent correction of missignings in reference to regular leaves in collational formulas is discussed by Bowers on pp. 222-225. 62 Except that, in Bowers's view, "it would seem to be unnecessary in [inserted] folds to indicate signing of later leaves, . . . although no positive objection could ordinarily be made" (p. 242). 63 Greg, at the beginning of "A Formulary of Collation" (note 40 above), comments on the printer's "register" in early books, which listed the signatures and the units in each, and he suggests that "there might be a good deal to be said for applying the term to our formulas of collation." In his Bibliography he does often refer to the formula as a "register," but he is aware that his practice is sometimes at odds with what the term implies: "Neither in reference nor in the register should the signatures given be regarded as in any strict sense quotations from the original, though it is true that the registrum may be said to have consisted of such in the first instance" (p. clii). Many of the complications that he analyzes in fact arise from a consideration of whether the bibliographer is best served by actual quotation and from attempts to accommodate such quotation—as when he writes "χC('Cc')", which perfectly epitomizes the urge to rewrite signatures for bibliographical use and the simultaneous reluctance to eliminate the actual form of a signature from the formula (p. cliv). The history of the development of the collational formula is dominated by discussions that have at their root either an indecisiveness as to the primary bibliographical function of the formula or a curious hesitation to push the formula fully and logically in the direction of a structural statement. The modern formula can no doubt be legitimately regarded as a descendant of the printer's register; but to do so seems to constrict thinking about the formula. (Even the standard term "signature collation" illustrates the point, for the bibliographer collates gatherings, and only incidentally their signatures.) 64 However, a distinction can be made between a single leaf and a fold, and there are times when it may not seem inappropriate to assign "χ" to a fold. See note 71 below. 65 Bowers glances at these possibilities (p. 238) and says, "No real objection can be raised to this theory, perhaps, except to point out that the method cannot be consistent itself, since in certain circumstances quoting proves impracticable, as for the shorthand notation of simultaneous cancellation and substitution" (see also pp. 244, 248). One can of course use an expanded treatment of cancellation and substitution instead of the plus-minus sign; but the undeniable problem is that it would be not merely impracticable but in fact impossible to quote the signature of the cancelled leaf if no copy of it had been located. (One convention might be to place the plus-minus sign after the quoted signature of the substitution—as "C 4 ('C3'±)"—to show that the named leaf replaces whatever leaf was previously in that position, without directly citing that previous leaf.) Bowers proceeds, "Moreover, since the ordinary formula takes no notice of the signing of individual leaves in a gathering so long as the signature of the gathering is established as noninferential, it need not necessarily do so for the signing of inserted leaves where the position is in no doubt. Quotes, therefore, may be reserved the more simply for the occasions when it is definitely desirable to indicate signings." One may certainly declare that the signatures of inserted leaves are not to be quoted, but the discussion at this point is how to handle them if they are quoted, and some form of consistent quoting is recommended: "inferentially signed [inserted] leaves must ordinarily be differentiated from signed inserted leaves" (p. 237). If, on the other hand, one decides that the signatures of inserted leaves are not to be noted, then by definition there are no situations in which it is desirable to note them. 66 In these formulas, the notation for the second inserted leaf in C would more conventionally be preceded by a plus sign (a comma would be used if the second leaf were cited as "χ1"). But the comma seems preferable because it recalls the parallelism with the convention of the period for conjugate leaves and because it allows the plus sign to be reserved exclusively to locate the link between the regular leaf and the inserted leaf or leaves. One should also note here the distinction, emphasized by Bowers (e.g., pp. 238, 257), between italics and brackets. Italic type denotes an inferred signature for a whole gathering (as in A here) and cannot be used to refer to an unsigned leaf of a gathering signed on some other leaf (as in C), whereas brackets can serve both functions. Italic leaf references are permissible, therefore, only when the signature involved has been inferred for the gathering as a whole (as in A ). 67 There is of course a third possibility: using quotation marks and brackets in the same formula. The result would be still clearer and considerably more awkward. 68 Of course, there is a fundamental difference between references to leaves and those to whole gatherings; but the fact remains that to complicate the parenthetical references with indication of the signing of leaves suggests that such indication is an appropriate function of the formula—a function not then carried through with regard to the other leaves, those not associated with insertions. Before passing on to an approach that in my opinion is more attractive, one further point is worth noting. A system that aims to be uniform and explicit in its references to leaves should also use numbers in a consistent way to refer to leaves; and since numbers regularly specify individual leaves, they should probably not be used at the same time for totals. If, in C above, both inserted leaves had been unsigned, the conventional notation "(C3 + 2)" would seem less appropriate in the context than "(C3 + 1,2)"—or, in the second formula, "([C3] + [1],[2])"—in which the "1" and "2" denote the first and second of the inserted leaves (just as "C1" and "C2" denote the first and second regular leaves of the gathering). Whether this reasoning suggests that in the formulas above the second inserted leaf in C should be called "2" rather than "1" (or whether "1" can be thought of as suggesting the first unsigned inserted leaf in the gathering) need not detain us, since the approach illustrated by those formulas cannot be strongly recommended anyway. This question calls attention again to the problems associated with quoting in formulas, illustrated here also by the possibility of inferring a second leaf in some instances (as in B) but not in others (as in C, where an inferred "C4" would conflict in notation with the regular fourth leaf of the gathering). Such complications, though not serious perhaps, provide further reason for thinking that this approach does not achieve the desired combination of clarity with simplicity. 69 Bowers alludes briefly (pp. 240-241) to a system that goes part way in this direction: eliminating from the formula the signing of inserted leaves except when "the signing is related to the signing of the gathering"—thus the "1" in "K 4 (K3 + 1)" would be appropriate if the inserted leaf were signed with an asterisk or a paragraph sign but not if its signature included "K", which would necessitate, for example, "K 4 (K3 + 'K4')." He understandably finds this system inconsistent and sees "no really positive virtue in it." 70 There is a case for retaining the signatures: their presence would emphasize the distinction between regular leaves (or replacements for them), which would be noted by signature and number, and inserted leaves, which would be noted by number alone. Signatures would be especially welcome when the conjugacy of canceled leaves is not the same as that of the substitutions for them: if "G 4 (—G3,4 + G3.4)" were written without the signatures—as "G 4 (—3,4 + 3.4)"—the numbers following the plus sign might seem at odds with the "1.2" one would normally expect in this system; but the addition of "G" would made instantly clear that the leaves are replacements, rather than insertions that increase the total number of leaves in the gathering. Greg, in "A Formulary of Collation" (see note 40 above), rejects the idea of eliminating signature letters within parentheses because "it would lead to ambiguity in some of the more complicated cases"—though the case he cites could be handled by replacing a comma with a semicolon (pp. 379, 381 [310, 311]). 71 An argument could be made that in this system conjugate inserted leaves should be represented by the other standard notation for folds, the superscript "2", which would in turn necessitate the use of a signature (actual or assigned). Even though an inserted fold takes its identity from the gathering into which it is inserted, an inserted fold is analogous to a separate gathering in that a signature can apply to both its leaves without conveying any information about the specific signing of either leaf. The system would remain consistent, therefore, if one wrote, for instance, "B 4 (B2 + b 2 )" instead of "B 4 (B2 + 1.2)", because no information about the signing of individual leaves is being reported in either case; the difference turns solely on the question of whether the reporting of inserted folds is to follow the model for gatherings or that for inserted leaves, and a defense of either approach can be made. The whole issue might not seem worth bringing up if all insertions were as simple as the ones in this example. But when two or more successive folds, or even quired folds, are inserted at the same point, a far simpler formula would result if one regarded those insertions as in effect a subseries of gatherings, treating them as separate gatherings would be treated: e.g., "A 4 (A 2 + a 2 * B 4 b 2 2b 4 ) B-E 4 ." 72 An excellent demonstration of this point is provided by Bowers's discussion of the application of the formulary to incunabula (pp. 487-499). 73 There has been a tradition of omitting the "r" when the context makes clear that the recto page is meant rather than the whole leaf. But the practice of allowing the same reference to mean one side of the leaf and both sides of the leaf is illogical and potentially confusing; it obviously has no place in precise notation, as Foxon argues with some vehemence (pp. 8-9). There is also a tradition, especially among incunabulists, of using superscript "a" and "b" for the two sides of a leaf; but there is no justification for regarding this usage as the only defensible one, as Gaskell does on pp. 329-330 of the New Introduction . 74 Another possibility may be mentioned, building on Greg's suggestion for citing gatherings whose location is not obvious. If one wished, for example, to cite χ3 in "A-G 4 χ4 H 4 ", Greg would write " G χ3", using the signature of the preceding gathering as a superscript index for the purpose of revealing immediately where the unsigned gathering is located. Similarly, one might indicate the location of an inserted leaf by using the notation for the preceding regular leaf as a superscript index—e.g., " B2 †" or " E3 e3". (Stevenson, in the Hunt catalogue, p. clix, suggests " R χ" for an inserted leaf in R, but this notation does not show the exact location in R.) 75 In some respects, of course, the notation does indicate structure by distinguishing an inserted leaf from a regular leaf, and if one wished to show the conjugacy of insertions one could use periods, following the practice in the formula: "B2(1.)" and "B2(.2)" would refer to inserted leaves that belong to a fold, whereas "C3(1)" and "C3(2)", lacking periods, would refer to disjunct inserted leaves. 76 Bowers gives as an example the second inserted leaf in K 4 (K3 + 'K4',χ1), noting that a reference to it as "K('K4' + 1)" would require "prior analysis of the precise position of leaf 'K4'", whereas "K(K3 + 2)" states its position in relation to the regular leaf K3. In the standard formulary, however, "+2" would refer to two inserted disjunct leaves, not to a single leaf in a second position. Bowers comments on this difference in usage: "This method differs from the manner in which these leaves would be noted in a collational formula; but there is no anomaly since only positional reference is being made in the absence of a formula to which formulary reference could be constructed" (pp. 260-261). Nevertheless, it would be advantageous from a practical point of view if the practice in reference notation coincided with that in the collational formula and if this divergence in usage could be avoided. 77 Bowers points out (p. 269) that some bibliographers regard only irregularities as worth noting, allowing customary practices of signing for the period to be taken for granted. But it requires little additional space to be explicit, and that space would seem to be well used. 78 Except, of course, regular leaves in those gatherings having no signature at all, because the inferred signature in the formula constitutes a statement that no regular leaf in the gathering is signed. One might argue that, if the formula deals only with structure and not signing, there is no point italicizing an inferred signature. (Even then, assigned signatures such as "π" and "χ" would still indicate lack of signing.) But as long as one bases the formula on the system of signing present in the book (and it would be foolish to do otherwise), it seems reasonable to show which signatures employed in the formula actually appear in the book and which do not. The formula, in this view of it, would not be concerned with the signing of particular leaves but would incidentally, in the course of reporting the structure of a book, reveal which gatherings are entirely unsigned; the statement of signing would then be exclusively devoted to the signing of leaves (as opposed to gatherings as a whole). 79 Bowers explains that the explicit approach is essential for dealing with nineteenth-and twentieth-century books (p. 434); some possible confusion might be eliminated, therefore, by employing it for all books. Margadant also takes this position, pointing out (p. 25) the awkwardness in saying both "$3 signed" (meaning the first three leaves) and "$3 signed $ *" (meaning the third leaf). He goes on, however, to propose what seems to me an unnecessary elaboration: the Greek letter gamma to stand for the (variable) total number of leaves in a gathering, so that one can say "$½ γ signed", meaning that half the total number of leaves in each gathering is signed, regardless of how the bulk of the gatherings varies. When a book has, for example, a regular alternation of eight-leaf and four-leaf gatherings, I see no objection to the slightly longer statement "$1-4 in $ 8 and $1-2 in $ 4 signed." 80 The use of the equals sign in the formula to show the identity of a cancellandum at one point with an insertion or cancellans at another (see Bowers, pp. 250-251) would not, I think, conflict with this use of the equals sign in the statement of signing. (Some bibliographers prefer to use square brackets in the formula to enclose a statement involving the equals sign.) However, if one wishes to avoid the equals sign in the statement of signing, the word "as" (scarcely longer than the equals sign) could be used from the second instance onward, as in "C2 signed as C3, D3 as D, E2 as e2" and so on. 81 Bowers notes that "signing statements record only variations from normal" and that an unsigned title page, if it falls on a normally signed leaf in a gathering, need not be specifically exempted from the generalization about signing since "few title-pages are signed" (p. 270). However, the small amount of space required to say, for example, "—A1" is probably worth using in order to eliminate any possible doubt in a reader's mind (as Gaskell suggests in the New Introduction , p. 332). 82 It can be important, as Bowers explains (p. 271), to record details about the typography of signatures (size and style of type) and their placement (in relation to footnotes, for instance); and he suggests that this information, in a full description, might go in a separate paragraph on signatures. One could also justify placing in the statement of signing only deviations (such as italic signatures when most are roman), leaving the principal facts about the typography of signatures for the paragraph on typography, where information about other aspects of typography in the book is drawn together. 83 One should remember that books with the number of irregularities and insertions recorded in the hypothetical formula above are not common. Some real books are indeed quite complicated, but many are quite regular, and one can expect collational formulas generally to have a much simpler appearance than the one shown here.</field>

The stemmatic method involves the following assumptions: (i) the author nowhere left variant readings; (ii) every manuscript (except the original) was copied from a single source; (iii) no two copyists originated the same error independently; (iv) errors were not removed by conjecture; (v) every relevant manuscript (i.e. a manuscript that survives or leaves extant progeny) except the original introduced at least one new error, at a point where no relevant manuscript had yet erred; (vi) of the errors introduced by a given relevant manuscript, at least one can be identified by critics as an error. These assumptions concern the original (i), the genealogy (ii), scribal behaviour (iii-v), the length of the text analysed (v) and the investigator's judgment (vi). Assumptions (v) and (vi) can usually be relaxed but never wholly dropped. 1 In any passage where the manuscripts are divided between the truth and one false reading, the set of manuscripts presenting the false reading may be termed the "error set". On the above assumptions, the error is due to an ancestor 2 common and exclusive to the error set. In two passages that exhibit different error sets, consider the relationship between the two ancestors responsible. Either one derives from the other, or they are collateral. In the former case, the error set due to the earlier ancestor includes the whole error set due to the later ancestor. In the latter case, the two error sets have no manuscript in common. Two error sets are therefore called "consistent" either if one includes the other or if they share no manuscript. 3 From a series of mutually consistent error sets, the stemma is reconstructed thus. We list all the manuscripts across the page, and arrange the error sets underneath, so that any error set(s) contained in a larger error set appear(s) below it. Every error set is joined to that immediately above. Of each manuscript we then delete every occurrence except the lowest. This procedure is applied in fig. 1b to the error sets generated by fig. 1a, namely AB, CD, A, B, D. 4 The text of ω, the latest common ancestor of the extant manuscripts, is reconstructed on the principle that two manuscripts which agree reproduce the reading of their latest common ancestor. In fig. 1, the agreement of AC or BC suffices. So far, P. Maas's approach 5 has largely been followed, but an alternative method was developed by J. Froger. We may regard any stemma as suspended from its topmost point, which represents the latest common ancestor of the extant manuscripts. Were it suspended from any other point, Froger observes (pp. 80, 118), the new stemma would generate the same patterns of agreement and disagreement, as long as the notion of error is left aside. These patterns thus admit a range of possible stemmata, which present the same enchainment 6 (i.e. network of lines connecting extant manuscripts and lost branch-points) but differ in orientation (i.e. choice of topmost point). 7 Froger therefore first seeks the enchainment, on the basis of agreement patterns in two-way splits alone (p. 119). One extant manuscript is arbitrarily chosen as a fictitious original (p. 83). The "error" set in any passage now comprises all manuscripts disagreeing with that manuscript. Over different passages, these sets too are consistent, 8 and so Froger can proceed (pp. 84, 95) as in fig. 1, obtaining an enchainment suspended from the fictitious original. With the tradition of fig. 1, and with C as "original", the "error" sets become AB, A, B, D, whence the enchainment of fig. 2ab, arbitrarily orientated with C on top. He now re-orientates, on the principle (p. 88) that if a group of manuscripts (or one manuscript) is caught in error, the topmost point cannot lie on their (its) side of the line that separates them (it) from the remaining manuscripts. An identifiable error in AB, and another in CD, would suffice to locate the topmost point; in fig. 2c dotted curves surround the areas eliminated. Fewer identifiable errors are thus required under (vi). This is an advance, because passages (which we may call determinate) where intrinsic criteria identify the original reading may be rare. The remaining assumptions are no less necessary. Without (v) different manuscripts would appear identical. As for (i), if certain variants stood as alternatives in the original, unrelated manuscripts could agree in their choice between them. The basic principle that an error set has an exclusive common ancestor is ensured by (ii)—(iv), which imply that any error set comprises all the descendants of the manuscript responsible for the error and them alone. If (iii) fails, however, the error set may be augmented; if (iv) fails it may be diminished (Froger, pp. 108 ff.). The failure of (ii) has the same effect as that of (iv) or (iii), according as good readings or bad are transferred from the secondary source. Two or more such shifts may occur in a single passage. In different passages the error sets may be distorted in different ways, and cease to be mutually consistent. If few consistent variants remain, the above construction methods break down. The largest error sets are the likeliest to be distorted. In all too many traditions, therefore, some small groups remain recognisable, but the passages where the manuscripts are more evenly divided exhibit a bewildering variety of inconsistent patterns of agreement, each occurring just once or twice. In most traditions, authorial variation, coincidence in error and successful conjecture are exceptional, and instances can often be suspected on intrinsic grounds and excluded. It is therefore primarily the level of contamination that determines whether a stemma can be constructed. In the total absence of contamination there are but a few possible error sets, all mutually consistent. At the opposite extreme we could imagine a totally contaminated tradition, where the truth may survive in any one of the manuscripts uniquely and a fortiori in any combination, and the possible error sets are correspondingly numerous and in the main mutually inconsistent. (Such a tradition, comprising just three manuscripts, is considered in §4.1.) Real-life traditions fall between these extremes. Contaminated traditions were less pejoratively termed "open" by G. Pasquali. 9 Here an open tradition will be defined empirically as one for which no stemma can be constructed. 1.2. Before devising an alternative to the stemma, one must ask what the stemma ideally achieves. The answer seems obvious: the stemma sketches the history of the extant manuscripts, and that history establishes priority between rival readings. In other words the stemma has two functions, historical and evaluative; and the latter would seem to depend on the former. Yet once the possibility of contamination is accepted, the history sketched by the stemma becomes just one of many possibilities. In 1928 J. Bédier complained that the same distribution of agreements and errors in manuscripts of the Lai de l'Ombre admitted either of the pedigrees in fig. 3. 10 Indeed for any stemma, however well it fits the patterns of agreement and error, any number of alternative pedigrees can be devised. The stemma may present a simpler history, argued Bédier, but not necessarily the true one, and therefore formed no sure basis for evaluation of rival readings (pp. 354 f). This objection to the stemma is weightier than Bédier's well-known argument that among the stemmata constructed by editors the proportion having just two branches is impossibly high; in fact a heavy preponderance of two-branched stemmata is entirely to be expected. 11 Here the answer to Bédier is that the evaluative policy stands even if the history falls. Consider how a stemma evaluates variants. In any variant passage, each rival reading is attested in a group of one or more manuscripts, and traced back to the latest common ancestor of that group. Suppose that one of these ancestors derives from another; we may call the manuscripts whose reading is traced to the earlier ancestor the superior group, and those manuscripts bearing the reading traced to the later ancestor the inferior group. Then the superior group prevails, the divergence between the groups being attributed to error in the later ancestor. This is the essence of stemmatic evaluation. In fig. 3a, for example, let ABDE agree against CG. The latest common ancestor of CG (=y) derives from that of ABDE (=v); hence ABDE's reading is older, and CG's may be put down to error in y. Now the reason that an exclusive common ancestor was posited for the inferior group at the construction stage is that that group were somewhere caught in an exclusive common error. Bédier's objection is that such an error is not conclusive proof of an exclusive common ancestor. 12 True; but the fact remains that the superior group has been known elsewhere to preserve the truth against the inferior group, 13 through whatever historical process, while the converse has never been observed. Hence, in passages (called indeterminate) where intrinsic considerations fail, readings exclusive to the inferior group deserve no priority. This conclusion bypasses historical reconstruction and Bédier's objections thereto, and rests on direct induction from determinate to indeterminate passages. 14 The history and the evaluative policy must be derived from the determinate passages independently, and not, as commonly thought, in succession.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Historical methods in open traditions 2.1. The genealogy, if known, would make evaluation easy even in a contaminated tradition. Suppose that the manuscripts disagree. If we can find a common ancestor for the group that attest one reading, and at the same time a path bypassing that ancestor can be traced from each member of the (or a) rival group back to the original, the former reading is attributable to error in that ancestor. Every group can be tested thus against every other, and unless every reading is found attributable to error, the original (or rather the oldest recoverable) reading will be identified. Now the only way to know that a group of manuscripts share an ancestor on which the remaining manuscripts are not wholly dependent is to have caught that group in an exclusive error elsewhere. Open traditions, however, exhibit a multitude of two-way splits (to go no farther), mostly rare or even unique. Over Cyprian's De Unitate , for example, there are 346 passages where the eighteen manuscripts collated by M. Bévenot survive and divide into two groups; these show no less than 198 different agreement patterns, of which 164 occur just once. 15 Many agreement patterns among the indeterminate passages occur in no determinate passage; none of their constituent groups, therefore, will have been observed in exclusive error. Such patterns cannot be illuminated by the partial genealogy derivable from the determinate passages. Among four manuscripts ABCD, for example, suppose that we detect unique errors in each, as well as some common errors in AB and some in CD. The stemma of fig. 4a results. Suppose in addition an indeterminate split AD:BC. According to fig. 4a, AD have no common source but the original, nor do BC; but in fact either AD or BC must have a common source, as one of the readings must be wrong. 16 The existing genealogy does not aid evaluation here. On the contrary, an evaluation would fill out the genealogy: if we decided after all that AD were correct, we would ascribe to BC a common source (which fig. 4b takes simply as B); if we preferred to follow BC, we would link AD. It may be noted that the same apparatus criticus admits more than one genealogy in an open tradition (§1.2). Suppose four manuscripts EFGH, each bearing unique errors, and suppose further some common errors in EF, some in GH, some in EH, some in FG. We might infer fig. 5a. However, the links E-H and F-G could be differently orientated (fig. 5b). Or, instead of ascribing common error to "intrastemmatic" contamination, we should perhaps ascribe common freedom from error to an "extrastemmatic" source (i.e. a lost source not derived from the latest common ancestor of the extant manuscripts); 17 in fig. 5c, μ accounts for the shared errors both of GH and of EF (which had no access to μ to correct λ's errors). In an open tradition it is not always obvious which of the alternative pedigrees has the dubious advantage of being the simplest. 2.2. For a genealogical approach to evaluation, then, one determinate specimen of every attested two-way split is prerequisite. Dom H. Quentin, however, claimed that a full genealogy could be constructed with far less information. He argued that if three manuscripts were related in any of the ways shown in fig. 6, the outer pair (AC) would never agree against the intermediary (B). 18 All the diagrams comprise the same enchainment, variously orientated. Quentin supposed conversely that if the number of agreements of two manuscripts (AC) against a third (B) were zero, the three were related according to one or other of the diagrams in fig. 6 and stood in the enchainment A-B-C. On comparing by threes all the manuscripts of a tradition, Quentin expected to discover enough zeros to form the complete enchainment, which would merely require orientation. Conflation would be revealed through the last case in fig. 6, though in fact zero agreement in AC against B will occur only in the atypical case where B simply amalgamates AC and never errs. Now in all six cases in fig. 6, at least one of the three manuscripts derives directly from another. It follows that if, after standard practice, 19 every manuscript which derives from another extant manuscript is eliminated, the remaining manuscripts will exhibit no zeros at all. Yet Quentin did obtain zeros, by restricting the field of variants. Suppose three independent descendants of one ancestor. Before the count begins, the number of agreements of any pair against the remaining manuscript is of course zero. If the text is long enough, all three manuscripts will eventually err and all three zeros will be breached. However, if the text is so short that one of the manuscripts did not err, a spurious zero will remain. Quentin used short texts, and further increased the likelihood of the survival of a zero by eliminating readings which "attirent l'attention des copistes". 20 He also regarded a low figure as a quasi-zero, equivalent to zero; but in fact a quasi-zero may result not only from intermediacy (e.g. if the two outer manuscripts occasionally agree by coincidence) but also from wholly different relationships. 21 Quentin also eliminated unique readings. Any manuscript standing at the end of a branch was thereby replaced by the nearest extant manuscript or branch-point; in fig. 7b, for example, a should show A's text apart from A's unique readings. Once an enchainment was established between these surrogates, the manuscripts themselves could be shown branching off it. For example, the enchainment Hub-Bern-Anic-Theo, reached after the removal of unique readings, was modified to fig. 7a ( Mémoire , p. 257). With this adaptation, Quentin's method detects zeros in a wider range of enchainments but by no means in all. In fig. 7b, A without its unique readings becomes a , as does B; C becomes β, and so on; but no zero reveals the relations between αβγδ. The variants therefore had to be kept few. One of Quentin's genealogies rested on a passage of under 250 words—hardly long enough for every copyist to have committed an error meeting Quentin's conditions. All his analyses involve fewer than 100 variants and he considered twenty sometime sufficient ( Essais , pp. 124, 65). Those who took larger samples of the same works found no zeros. For example, whereas Quentin used 91 variants from the Vulgate Octateuch ( Mémoire , p. 328), Dom J. Chapman found, on the basis of some two thousand from Genesis and Exodus alone, that "comparison by threes will no longer produce zeros". 22 Again, the zeros which Quentin found on the basis of a sample from the Lai de l'Ombre were breached elsewhere, as Bédier noted ( Romania , LIV [1928], 328). Similarly a test on hundreds of variants in Mark yielded "but one zero line among eighty-four groups of three manuscripts". 23 Quentin's approach has been continued by G. P. Zarri, who uses even fewer variants. In a section of some one hundred lines of the Chanson de Roland he reduced the field to just thirteen, by eliminating on the suspicion of polygenesis the variants that prevented the appearance of the requisite zeros. 24 Another study concerned a text so tiny that Zarri found too many zeros: the Copa in the Appendix Vergiliana, comprising thirty-eight lines, yielded sixteen admissible variants among six manuscripts, and no less than fourteen zero lines among the twenty groups of three manuscripts. 25 His rules for combining the lines of intermediacy are questionable. For example, in fig. 8a he expects a zero in C against BE, among many others. In fact, however, two manuscripts will not show zero agreement against a third if a path exists between the two manuscripts—other than a path leading downwards from both—which bypasses the third. Some agreements of BE against C are therefore expected, where C innovates and E follows D. Again he wrongly supposes that the pattern of zeros allows a convergent enchainment to be re-orientated. Fig. 8b will exhibit one zero, namely in BD against A; if B is instead placed uppermost, the only zero now stands in AC against B. 26 2.3. Instead of a contaminated genealogy, some are content to reconstruct an outline stemma on which every manuscript is derived from its main source alone. One method is to list the two-way splits in decreasing order of frequency until we meet one that is inconsistent (§1.1) with some predecessor. 27 If contamination is slight, this selection will include most passages, and a stemma accounting for them follows through the methods of Maas and Froger. Where contamination is more extensive, different procedures are proposed by P. Buneman, 28 V.A. Dearing, 29 D. Najock 30 and E. Poole 31 for selecting variants on which to base a tree that traces main sources. In this situation, however, the cumulative neglect of subsidiary sources, which in some cases might be almost as important as the main sources, compromises both the historical and evaluative functions of the tree. In open traditions, it may be impossible to identify any genealogy of main sources as the correct one. A single apparatus criticus admits many equally plausible histories, which may differ even if secondary sources are overlooked. For illustration, suppose three manuscripts ABC which err together five times; let each manuscript also bear ten unique errors; in five more places, A alone is correct, and, in seven more places, C alone. One possible genealogy is fig. 9a:ω committed five errors, and so on, while B adopted seven of a 's errors and five of β's and added ten of its own. B thus departed from α in 15-7+5+10=23 places, and from β in 8-5+7+10=20 places. Hence its main source is β, and the genealogy of main sources is fig. 9b. However, the genealogy of fig. 9c equally fits the facts. Here A used λ to avoid five of γ's errors and one of δ's, but accepted two of λ's errors and added eight of its own. As A departs from λ twenty-five times and from δ only sixteen times, its main source is δ, whence the tree of fig. 9d. Now any procedure to recover a divergent tree from the apparatus criticus will yield either (b), which is false if (c) is the true history, or (d), which is false if (a) is the true history. The tree yielded by any particular procedure can therefore be no more than one out of many possible genealogies of main sources. Evaluation can be falsified by disregard of subsidiary sources. Fig. 9b implies that AB's agreements are correct, but they may in fact be errors inherited from the neglected a ; similarly fig. 9d gives unwarranted priority to BC's shared readings. Again, as shown in §2.1, contradictions result if the stemma is applied to evaluate variants discarded in its construction as inconsistent. If fig. 4b were the true genealogy, with C following β more often than B, and the stemma of fig. 4a were recovered, then in the splits AD:BC, resulting from C's secondary use of B, the stemma could not decide priority. Such discarded variants would abound, in open traditions. The first chapter (about 160 words) of Cyprian's De Unitate yields, for the eighteen manuscripts abBDeGhHJkmOp-PRTWY, the following five splits, among others: 32 1. DHJkP: rell. (induimur) 2. bhHmpRT: rell. (subruendis) 3. GhHJmpRT: rell. (grassatur) 4. DhJmT:GY: rell. (crudelitate) 5. aJHT: rell. (conatus) Of these five, no stemma could accommodate more than one. Generally, no stemma can provide an evaluative policy in a seriously contaminated tradition. V.A. Dearing's application of stemmata to evaluation require the discarded variants to be "treated as something different from what they really are" (see n. 29, pp. 87 ff.). The present writer has elsewhere criticised in detail the logic of Dearing's approach to history and evaluation. A model tradition, representing in miniature two parallel families that influence each other (fig. 10a), supplied a test: Dearing's procedures yielded a quite different tree (fig. 10b) and led to the wrong choice of reading in 44% of passages. 33 Dearing replies that a test problem which contradicts his method involves different assumptions on textual transmission, and that a tradition which violates his own assumptions is not "likely to occur in real life"; 34 but real life seems more varied than Dearing allows. He further objects that, in any case, "hypothetical cases are always hypothetical"—rather as if the manufacturer of a drug which in experiments on rats proved fatal protested that rats were merely rats.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. History-free approaches 3.1. Diagrams that resemble but do not constitute stemmata result from cluster analysis. Here an index of similarity (or conversely of distance) between every possible pair of manuscripts is required. Initially each manuscript constitutes a "group" of one. The two groups most similar according to the index are amalgamated, and this step is repeated until there is but one group, comprising all the manuscripts. The obvious index of similarity is the number of agreements, but, as Patricia Galloway explains, other indices exist and, where two groups each comprise many manuscripts, there is more than one way of defining the index between the groups in terms of the indices between the constituent manuscripts. 35 The resulting diagrams, unlike stemmata, cannot show one manuscript above another, or a branching into three or more lines, and many cluster analysts rightly distinguish them from stemmata. 36 A. Kleinlogel, however, after a complex argument based on lattice algebra, 37 proposes that we provisionally select the original reading in every variant passage, and thence count, for every manuscript pair AB: s=no. of variant passages where AB are correct t=no. of places where A is correct and B errs u=no. of places where B is correct and A errs v=no. of places where AB err together Three-way splits may be left aside. A similarity index which will supposedly reveal the stemma through cluster analysis is τ = cos [π sqroottu/sqroottu + sqrootsv] Yet in a simple example this method gives the wrong stemma. In fig. 11a, α erred five times, and so on, and all forty-five errors arise in separate places. For all pairs we tabulate: TABLE 1 s t u v τ AB 10 20 5 10 0.00 AC 25 5 10 5 0.35 AD 25 5 15 0 -1.00 BC 10 5 25 5 -0.35 BD 10 5 30 0 -1.00 CD 30 5 10 0 -1.00 Cluster analysis yields fig. 11b, which falsifies the history, and also the evaluation: if β and D erred simultaneously, whence a three-way split AB:C:D, with C alone correct, fig. 11b would wrongly condemn C's reading. 38 Other investigators propose similarity indices not involving the distinction between true and false readings, apply cluster analysis, and call the results stemmata. Were this valid, one could obtain a stemma on the basis of mere similarity, without ever deciding between readings 39 — which is absurd, since, without the notion of error, one cannot even draw a stemma for two manuscripts AB, showing whether A derives from B or B from A or both from a lost source. The distinction, already stressed by Greg (see n. 3, p. 59) between similarity and historical relationship is illustrated by fig. 12a: AD are the most similar pair, but not the most closely related, and cluster analysis yields the very different tree of fig. 12b. Yet P. Tombeur ( loc. cit. , see n. 36), and V. Wendland 40 attempted to found stemmata on the number of agreements as a similarity index. Similar but more elaborate is P. Malvaux's treatment of fifteen manuscripts of Theodoret of Cyrrhus. 41 Five groups were immediately apparent from the apparatus criticus , each departing unanimously on between nine and eighty occasions from the agreement of the others. Together these groups covered all fifteen manuscripts (AYZ; BR; CFHP; ENT; GQW). Malvaux posited for each group an ancestor responsible for its distinctive readings, and a more distant ancestor free of them. To study the relations between those remoter ancestors, Malvaux discarded unique readings and the distinctive readings of the five groups, on the ground that they originated subsequently. 42 The disagreements between the extant manuscripts were counted over the reduced field of variants. Cluster analysis linked most closely AYZ and BR, between which the fewest disagreements occur, and then linked the two with ENT; meanwhile CFHP were linked with GQW; hence the main lines of fig. 13a. The contrary findings of his collaborator the philologist P. Canivet, however, imposed the contamination line. Canivet produced no common error in CFHPGQW, and found in CFHP alone some readings that were undoubtedly correct. 43 This situation is better explained by fig. 13b, which rests on Canivet's findings plus Froger's method applied to the agreement patterns. 44 It rehabilitates one "séduisante" reading that Canivet abandoned in deference to the stemma (p. 405) 45 and accommodates 403 of the 447 variants reported (out of a total of 585). In any event, as Canivet concluded (p. 413), this is not a particularly contaminated tradition. In yet another approach that excluded the criterion of error, Carmélia Opsomer-Halleux counted for each manuscript pair the number of common departures from the text of the majority, and on that index founded a stemma. 46 But the majority need not be correct; an error may have infected a fertile family. The notion of error cannot be sidestepped. 3.2. Some investigators find similarities informative, even though they yield no genealogy. J. G. Griffith has used them to arrange the manuscripts in a spectrum, i.e. a sequence in which manuscripts that are similar textually stand close together. 47 In a study of Juvenal's Satires, the sincerest witnesses came out at one end and the most interpolated at the other. The textual worth of a manuscript could thus be inferred from its position along the spectrum. Between eight spectra for different sections of the Satires, Griffith found some variation, which indicated shifts of allegiance, as he confirmed by traditional methods. Within each spectrum groups were discerned which showed especially high similarity figures among themselves. In a second study, covering fourteen or fifteen manuscripts over four samples from Luke and John, the spectra did not prove interpretable as scales of textual purity. The groups, however, followed accepted divisions, appearing in the order: Byzantine, Caesarean, Alexandrian, Western. A spectrum can be viewed as a one-dimensional map where the distance between successive manuscripts is not quantified. Griffith and others have experimented with maps in two or even more dimensions. Each manuscript is represented by a point on the map, such that the distances between points reflect the degrees of textual divergence between the corresponding manuscripts. Manuscript maps were first proposed by the monks of Solesmes, in their edition of the neumic text of the Roman Gradual. 48 These maps bore obvious but not total resemblance to geographical maps of provenance of the manuscripts, and facilitated the comparison of textual with political and linguistic affinity. The map also served to divide into eighteen clusters the four-hundred-odd manuscripts collated, and whichever reading was attested by the majority of these clusters prevailed. 49 Despite the obvious risk that an error might have infected the majority, this evaluative policy was as reasonable as any, for one can hardly detect errors in a neumic text. While the monks of Solesmes drew their maps freehand, other investigators use factor analysis. D. Najock 50 and F. G. Berghaus ( op. cit. , see n. 36, pp. 102 f, 110) analysed thus the tradition of Old English glosses on the Psalter, obtaining maps which demarcated clearly the two classes distinguished by conventional methods. Again, the main accepted groupings of New Testament manuscripts were confirmed, with some fresh insights, in J. Duplacy's map. 51 In a map compiled by P. Monat of nine manuscripts of Lactantius' Divinae Institutiones IV , the manuscripts located to the 'west' carried a longer version of the whole work, and those to the 'east' a shorter version, both attributed to the author; the oldest manuscripts appeared in the 'south'; Monat concluded (p. 322) that any reading attested jointly by the most 'southwesterly' manuscript and the most 'southeasterly' should prevail. 52 Griffith's maps of passages from Horace, Juvenal, the Gospels and Aeschylus confirmed and refined earlier groupings, while variation between results from passages by one author suggested shifts in the textual history. 53 The deficiency of all these approaches, including cluster analysis, is that the main aims of textual criticism—an evaluative policy and a history—are not attained. Admittedly, into one spectrum series (Juvenal) and one map (Lactantius) the notion of error, or at least priority, was readily imported, and led to an evaluative policy; but the contrasting performance of the remaining spectra and maps casts doubt even on those evaluative policies which intuitively emerge. 54 Many interesting results remain, especially the groupings, and the differences in transmission between different sections of one work or between different types of variant (e.g. whether they involve a whole word or not) (Galloway, see n. 35, pp. 4 ff). 3.3. We turn finally to approaches that involve no genealogies or other diagrams. M. Bévenot set forth a principle applicable to any tradition, however contaminated: a reading attested by two manuscripts never or seldom caught erring together prevails over a reading that lacks such attestation ( op. cit. , see n. 15, pp. 133 ff, 147 ff). In his edition of Cyprian's De Unitate , Bévenot had set up a 'Resultant Text' presenting at each point his choice of reading on intrinsic grounds. He then counted, for each manuscript pair, their agreements in readings not accepted for the Resultant Text. The pairs showing the lowest totals were termed "opposed". He identified some instances of three mutually opposed manuscripts, and argued that their shared readings were almost certainly correct. Using this principle to check the text, he found that triply opposed manuscripts hardly ever agreed in a reading earlier rejected; but this confirmation of his original choice of readings is suspect, since the underlying statistics of agreement in error themselves depend on that choice. More soundly, he applied his results from the De Unitate to another Cyprianic treatise, the De Lapsis , whose textual history could be presumed identical. He had meanwhile noted in the De Unitate a group (which he later called a 'team') of four mutually opposed manuscripts, and, in the evaluation of variants in the De Lapsis , "the agreement of any three of the four almost invariably carried the day." 55 M. L. West too counts common errors within every manuscript pair, to identify manuscripts that never err together when the truth anywhere survives. 56 Like Bévenot again, he constructs a 'team', but better defines it as the smallest group to contain all the ancient readings anywhere preserved. Bévenot's formulation (minimum agreement in false readings) might have admitted a group of manuscripts that were deficient, or exhibited separate errors, in places where the truth survived elsewhere. West's team does not rest on his statistics of common error. Instead, he lists all identifiable ancient readings. 57 Any manuscript that uniquely preserves such readings is adopted. Any ancient reading attested by the existing team members is struck from the list, and whichever manuscript contains the most of the remaining readings joins the team. The procedures in the last sentence are repeated until the list is exhausted. The approach of Bévenot and West seems the most promising. It is logically sound and attacks directly the goal of evaluation. It reduces the bulk of the apparatus criticus , and the labour of collation in works whose history may be presumed identical. It does not, however, yield a textual history. 58 The evaluative policy is clear, but only when the team is unanimous. Unfortunately it is often divided; in the De Unitate , for example, Bévenot's team of four (aepY) is divided in some twenty passages in Ch. 1 alone. Bévenot, as stated, would follow the majority, but this is to ignore the common phenomenon of unique preservation. 59 West is silent; but if the approach is indecisive wherever the team divides, its role in evaluation is limited indeed. The following sections ask whether these gaps can be filled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4. The inductive approach to evaluation 4.1. In an open tradition, the agreement patterns are too confused to illuminate directly the history and evaluation, but the principle of opposed pairs (§3.3) remains valid. To develop the argument we require what will be termed the bipolar assumption. If we collate many manuscripts, we can identify a relatively small 'team' of manuscripts which together attest all the good readings anywhere preserved (§3.3). Let us now define the team differently as the smallest set of manuscripts never to exhibit a common error when the truth anywhere survives. 60 Team members may on that account be termed 'poles'. What determines the size of such a team? A team of one results, of course, if only one manuscript is collated or is the source of all the others. Any other uncontaminated tradition yields a team of two, or rather many alternative teams. Any pair independently derived from the archetype form a team, and every manuscript belongs to at least one team. Fig. 3a, for example, yields eight teams (AD, AE, BD, CE, . . .). On the original definition, multiple splits could extend the team: in fig. 3a, if in one place xz erred separately, in another yz erred separately, and in a third w erred, we should need a team of three, namely (1) C or G, (2) A or B, and (3) D or E. With the modified definition all eight teams stand, and team size depends not on scribal behaviour but on genealogy alone. 61 A group of manuscripts can suffer some contamination but still have just two poles. If one manuscript (γ in fig. 14a) adopts good readings from a lost extrastemmatic source (§2.1), then any original team (i.e. a team that would have been valid had no contamination occurred) not containing that manuscript or a descendant thereof is eliminated. In fig. 14a, only the teams AC and AD would survive. Two lines of extrastemmatic contamination, however, might eliminate all the original teams (e.g. if the lines led to B and γ), and result in a team of three. As for intrastemmatic contamination, if one member of an original team (or an ancestor thereof) transfers error to the other member (or an ancestor thereof) the team is invalidated; but as long as one team stands (AC in fig. 14b) the tradition remains bipolar. Consider a team of three members ABC. Each is on occasion correct against the agreement of the other two. There are many possible pedigrees, all rather complex, which could bring this about. In fig. 15a, each pair shares a source and thence errors, but the only source common to all three manuscripts is the original. In fig. 15b, some of B's errors mar BC but not A (thanks to a ), some of C's reach A but arose after B, some of α's reach AB but not C (thanks to β). In fig. 15c, B consulted λ in some passages where ω was corrupt, C consulted λ in other such passages, and A is sound where BC bear β's errors. Teams of four or more betoken even more complicated genealogies. If such intricacy seems far-fetched, one need only recall that in the Aeschylean triad the question is whether the team numbers eleven or twenty. 62 Evidently not every tradition is bipolar. Moreover, even if the set of all manuscripts collated is bipolar, not every sub-group is necessarily so: for example, the group ωλβABC (all for a moment supposed extant) in fig. 15c is bipolar, but the sub-group ABC is not. Nevertheless, the assumption that manuscript groups are bipolar is far less restrictive than that of total absence of contamination. 4.2. The method here proposed begins with a list of the determinate two-way splits. Hence the errors in every manuscript and the errors common to every manuscript pair are counted. Multiple splits are excluded from the list, since manuscripts which elsewhere err together may there err separately and cause anomalies, as in fig. 16. Suppose that β and D each erred, so that BC show one error and D another; it would be misleading to ascribe one common error to BC and none to BD or CD and thereby suggest an exclusive relationship between BC. 63 In any case multiple splits are rare, if each independent point of variation, however great or small, is separated. Thus the readings to you I tell : to you I say : I say to you entail two variations: word order and tell/say . Similarly composed : composing : reposing comprises two variations: comp-/rep- and -ed/-ing . The readings amorous AB: loving CD: lufand EF yield two variations: (1) amorous /[ loving ] AB:CDEF, and (2) loving/lufand CD:EF (with AB unavailable). Some multiple splits (e.g. say : tell : sing ) are, however, irresoluble. 64 The criterion of independence is usually easy to apply; for example, see and hear : hear and see yield not two independent variations, but one. (Contrast Dearing, see n. 29, p. 32.) An error unique to any manuscript cannot affect the totals of shared errors, and as for the error total for that manuscript, all that matters (cf. §4.3) is whether unique errors occur or not. Unique errors can (rather than must) therefore be excluded, though their carriers should be noted. Unique preservation of the original reading, however, does affect the error totals, and any variant for which this possibility exists must remain. Probable cases of coincidence in error or successful conjecture should be excluded, since the figures are intended for extrapolation to indeterminate passages, where such non-genealogical causes of common error are not especially liable to generate the same agreement patterns. 4.3. We obtain, then, a table of error totals. Each total can now be expressed as a percentage of the number of determinate passages. This yields the average number of errors observed per hundred variant passages. (The problem of missing readings is ignored for the moment.) It is now assumed that, over the indeterminate variants too, every manuscript or pair of manuscripts yields a similar percentage of errors. This assumption turns on the number and accuracy of our determinate variants, and ultimately on our critical judgment; compare assumption (vi) in §1.1. At any indeterminate variant passage, the manuscripts divide into two or more groups. Even if such a group contains more than two manuscripts, its error percentage can still be defined as the average number of errors common to the group over a field of one hundred variants. The obvious course is, as before, to express the number of common errors detected in the group as a percentage of the total of determinate passages; but the results, at least for larger groups, may be unhelpful. In a tradition where scribes constantly compared sources in order to improve the text, readings that penetrated a good proportion of the extant tradition and yet can be confidently identified today as errors are rare. If (say) eight manuscripts agreed against ten in an indeterminate passage, it is all too likely that we could identify no instance of all the eight agreeing in error, nor of all the ten, and comparison of the two error percentages would be fruitless. The error percentage for a larger group is instead estimated through the bipolar assumption. Of all the pairs that can be formed from the group, let the pair PQ (say) show the smallest error percentage. The error percentage for the entire group cannot be greater; PQ plus others cannot agree in error more often than PQ alone. Can the error percentage be smaller for the group than for PQ? Let us suppose the group bipolar. PQ are then poles: wherever PQ err together, the truth survives nowhere in the group, which either shares PQ's error or is divided between two or more separate errors. The latter event being exceptional, most of PQ's shared errors will be common to the entire group, whose error percentage will approach that of PQ, the pair yielding the lowest percentage. For a group comprising just one manuscript, the error percentage will have been tabulated; if the manuscript bears unique errors, one will note that the true figure is higher. If the error percentage for the group attesting one variant reading is zero, that reading will prevail—unless a rival also shows zero, implying that our determinate variants formed an inadequate sample. If the error percentage for one group is low, and that for the rival group is far higher, say by a factor of four or more, that factor will indicate the odds in favour of the first reading, which of course prevails. 65 If there is no overwhelming imbalance between the error percentages, however, no decision is possible, as either group might well have erred. 66 As the error percentages for groups depend on those for pairs, this procedure comes back to the principle of opposed pairs: a reading attested by a pair never caught agreeing in error prevails over a reading not attested by any such pair. The replacement of 'never' by 'relatively seldom' adds a probabilistic version of that principle. 4.4. Let us examine further the logical role of the bipolar assumption. Two different lists of variants, requiring two different critical policies, could yield the same array of error totals (and percentages). Suppose that among ABC the error totals are two for each individual and one for each pair. This would result not only (i) if each manuscript erred once alone and all three erred once together, but also (ii) if AB erred once against C, AC erred once against B, and BC erred once against A. 67 These possibilities lead to different genealogies (the former to fig. 17, the latter to such genealogies as fig. 15abc) and imply respectively that readings common to ABC might, or cannot, be errors. The bipolar assumption, reasoning from constituent pairs to parent group, chooses whichever possibility posits the least contamination—here, the former. The consequences if the assumption fails appear from fig. 18. Thirty-two determinate passages (excluding unique readings) reveal eight common errors in AB, ten in AC, twelve in BC and two in DE. These were inherited from the lost manuscripts λ, μ, ν and ξ respectively, unbeknown to the investigator. The bipolar assumption, however, would impute eight common errors to ABC, and admit the genealogy of fig. 18b. Consider now a split ABC:DE. The smallest error percentage amongst ABC is 25%, yielded by AB (100% x 8/32), while DE show 61/4% (100% x 2/32). Our investigator would find odds of 4:1 (=25:61/4) in favour of DE's reading. In fact, however, the agreements of ABC must reproduce Ω, and the split ABC:DE indicates an error in DE. 4.5. To adjust for missing readings, the error total for any manuscript (or pair) should be expressed as a percentage not of the total of determinate passages, but of the number of determinate passages where the manuscript(s) is (are) available. Should this new denominator appear inadequate, the percentage must be treated cautiously or even discounted. Otherwise we might come to follow the agreement of a certain pair of manuscripts on the ground that they have never been caught in error together, when in fact there was little opportunity of catching them, either because they hardly overlapped or because the critic lacked the knowledge to recognise many errors. The adequacy of any particular denominator can only be assessed by someone expert in the tradition. With this revised definition, the error percentages can be tabulated and utilised as above to assess the credibility of the manuscript groups attesting the rival readings. The use of these procedures is illustrated in §6.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5. A complementary approach to evaluation and history . 5.1. The main drawbacks of the above approach are the need to compare a large array of error percentages in each variant passage and the failure to suggest a textual history. The following complementary method aims to fill these gaps. Suppose a two-dimensional map of manuscripts, on which the distances between points reflect the degrees of textual divergence between the corresponding manuscripts (cf. §3.2). To such a map we might add hypothetical manuscripts. Imagine, for example, a manuscript which always follows either A or B. We may expect to locate it along the line AB, in a position reflecting its relative indebtedness to its two components. Similarly, a hypothetical manuscript conflated from ABC should lie within the triangle ABC, and a mixture of many manuscripts should lie within the largest polygon that can be formed from the corresponding points (cf. fig. 19). These expectations are merely intuitive, and we shall see that they need modification; but for the moment let us accept them. The best text recoverable from the extant manuscripts is a hypothetical mixture ω which selects the true reading wherever that reading survives, but follows the manuscripts where all err together. 68 In an uncontaminated tradition, ω would be the archetype, which term denotes a manuscript that once existed. In an open tradition, however, that combination of good and bad readings which comprises the best recoverable text might never have stood in any manuscript; in the pedigree of fig. 14a, for example, ω's errors will be those of a minus those which γ avoided with λ's aid. From the determinate passages we may assess the degrees of divergence between ω and each extant manuscript, and hence locate ω on the map. This step introduces the notion of priority, which is essential for the derivation of an evaluative policy, but lacking (or at least not systematically included) in existing maps of manuscripts. Consider a group of manuscripts represented by points which span a polygon that contains ω. Then ω is a mixture of those manuscripts; that is, ω could be constructed from those manuscripts alone. Wherever that group of manuscripts agrees, so must any mixture of them. Hence their agreement gives the best recoverable reading. This principle evaluates variants: in fig. 20, for example, the reading of OPQX prevails over that of NRSTVYZ. 5.2. To construct the map, we require measures of 'distance' between all the manuscripts involved, i.e. between every pair of extant manuscripts and between ω and each extant manuscript. To adjust for missing readings, the 'distance' between two extant manuscripts is defined as the number of textual differences, expressed as a percentage of the number of variant passages where both manuscripts are available (cf. §4.5). Since at the outset ω is known in determinate passages only, the 'distance' between ω and an extant manuscript is taken as the error percentage of that manuscript, i.e. its total of identifiable errors as a percentage of the number of determinate passages where it is available. In all but the smallest traditions, unique errors are best omitted, as shown in §5.7. To be readily grasped the map should be two-dimensional. It is usually impossible, however, to draw a two-dimensional map on which the distances between points equal the distances between the manuscripts. One can only draw up a map that minimises the discrepancy, and different definitions of discrepancy lead to different methods. The technique here adopted is multidimensional scaling (MDS), which aims to preserve the rank ordering of the textual distances; that is, if one pair of manuscripts shows greater textual divergence than another, the first pair should be farther apart on the map than the second pair. 69 Although most manuscript maps have rested on factor analysis, MDS is preferred here. Firstly, factor analysis yields, in the first instance, a map in many dimensions, and aims for no specific correspondence between the data distances and the distances on the map obtained by neglecting all but the first two dimensions; 70 and without such correspondence, as §5.4 will show, the map cannot reliably assist evaluation. Secondly, MDS copes better with missing readings 71 and even with missing distances (Lingoes and Roskam, p. 73). The latter result if a lacunose manuscript survives in too few determinate passages, or if two such manuscripts overlap too little, to yield a reliable percentage. That entry could then be omitted, and a map could still be constructed from the remaining percentages. 5.3. The relationship between the measures of common error in §4.2 and the above statistics deserves clarification. The variants where any two manuscripts AB survive fall into five categories, as Kleinlogel remarked (§3.1): (i) AB agree in the correct reading, s times. (ii) A is correct and B errs, t times (iii) B is correct and A errs, u times (iv) AB err together, v times (v) AB err separately, w times The classification holds whether the errors are detectable or not. There are (u+v+w) errors in A and (t+v+w) errors in B, and AB diverge (t+u+w) times. The identity v=1/2 [(u+v+w)+(t+v+w)-(t+u+w) -w] implies that: no. of errors common to AB = 1/2 (no. of errors in A + no. of errors in B — no. of divergences between AB — no. of cases where AB err separately). 72 If we neglect the atypical event of separate error, and express the other items as percentages of the number of passages where AB survive, the general formula results: error percentage of AB equals2dot 1/2 (error percentage of A + error percentage of B - [percentage] distance of AB). Strictly speaking, all three terms on the right-hand side should be calculated over the field of all variants where AB both survive. In practice the first term rests on a different field (namely all determinate variants where A survives), as does the second; but if the determinate variants form a representative sample (§4.3), the figures should not differ greatly. 5.4. We must now examine more rigorously the proposition that the agreement of manuscripts which on the map surround ω gives the best recoverable text. If two manuscripts alone surround ω, they subtend there an angle of 180°. If more than two together surround ω, they include at least one pair subtending an obtuse (or right) angle at ω. In any triangle, an angle of 90° or more must be the greatest and stand opposite the greatest side. Therefore the distance between two manuscripts (say AB) subtending an angle between 90° and 180° at ω exceeds the distances Aω and Bω, on the map. The same holds of the textual distances, if the map preserves their rank ordering. Now it was shown above that error percentage of AB equals2dot 1/2 (error percentage of A + error percentage of B - distance AB) The distance AB is the largest term on the right-hand side. The greater the angle, the further ahead it will stand in the rank ordering and the more it will predominate. Hence the error percentage of AB should be low—but not necessarily zero. 73 This suggests a more general but more tentative formulation: an angle between 90° and 180° subtended at ω by a pair of manuscripts suggests that they rarely if ever agree in error. 5.5. Some possible pedigrees for three extant manuscripts will exemplify the map. For simplicity, unique errors are included and all errors are supposed to originate in different passages. In fig. 22, A miscopied ω twice, and so on, whence ten variant passages altogether. All the textual distances can be reproduced on a map in just one dimension (fig. 22b): d(A,B), i.e. the distance between A and B, is 3/10 x 100 = 30; d(B,ω) = 3+2/10 x 100 = 50; and so on. The numbers 2, 3, 5 are of course arbitrary. The pairs AC and BC each surround ω, and the agreement of either pair indeed gives ω's reading. Note that a line of descent (A→B) appears on the map as a path radiating outwards from ω. In fig. 23a, each of ABC miscopied ω once. The distance between ω and any copy is 1/3 x 100 ÷ 33; that between any two copies is 2/3 x 100 equalsdot 67. Were the map to reproduce those distances, ω would stand midway between AB, but also midway between AC and midway between BC—which is impossible. 74 We can only preserve the rank ordering, as in fig. 23b. Here what should have been the lines AωB, AωC and BωC are bent away from one another, and the range of the distances has been reduced (from 33:67 to 37:63). 75 The pairs AB, AC, BC each subtend an obtuse angle (120°) at ω, and the agreement of any pair indeed gives the best recoverable reading. As in later examples, the numbers of errors were chosen to produce ties, since with so few manuscripts rank ordering is otherwise insufficient to define a unique map. In fig. 24, the textual distances AB and AC equal 4/5 x 100 = 80, while Aω and all the rest equal 40. The pairs AB and AC each subtend an obtuse angle (150°) at ω, while BC subtend only 60°; correspondingly, the best recoverable text is given by the agreement of AB or AC but not necessarily by that of BC. Fig. 25a introduces conflation. If B reproduced all errors of A and C, the distances Bω and AC would equal 4/4 x 100 = 100, and the rest 2/4 x 100 = 50, whence fig. 25b. Alternatively, if B adopted just one error from each of AC, the distance Bω too would equal 50, whence fig. 25c. In either case, the only pair to subtend at ω an angle in the 90°-180° range is AC (90° or 120°), while the remaining pairs subtend only 45° or 60°. The genealogy confirms that AB could agree in A's errors, and BC in C's, but that AC agree only if both reproduce ω. 76 Note that the distance of a conflate manuscript from ω reflects its total of errors, while its direction thence is a compromise between those of its sources, reflecting their proportionate contributions. 5.6. The principle that paths radiating outwards from ω indicate descent, together with this remark on conflation, help to derive a textual history from the map, even though a unique history cannot be recovered (§§1.2, 2.1). We may indeed experiment with alternative histories, positing, for example, a lost common ancestor of two manuscripts (say AB) at the incentre of the triangle ABω. 77 Thus the map of fig. 25c could be reinterpreted by supposing a lost common ancestor α for AB (ωαA and ωαB becoming somewhat bent (see n. 77) lines of descent) and regarding C as conflated from B and a lost source β (C's direction from ω lying between those of B and β). This pedigree (fig. 26b) wholly differs from fig. 25a, but explains equally well the survival of the truth now in A alone (untainted by B's errors), now in C alone (thanks to β), but never in B alone. External clues, such as dates, may help to choose between alternative histories. 5.7. One limitation of the method is that it may be impossible to draw any two-dimensional map that reflects the rank ordering adequately. The rank orderings of the textual and map distances are in fact unlikely to correspond exactly (unless the manuscripts are few), but the discrepancy is sometimes so extensive that the map is inapplicable. Suppose, for example, five independent copies of ω. No possible map can provide that every pair of manuscripts subtend an obtuse angle at ω. A compromise like fig. 27b, where some pairs subtend an obtuse angle and others do not, creates illusions, e.g. that B is conflated from AC. 78 Such cases could be detected through the measures of 'badness of fit' output together with the map. 79 An implication of the last case is that unique errors should (rather than may—§4.2) be omitted here, in all but the smallest traditions. In most traditions at least five manuscripts bear unique errors. A map based on those errors alone would be at least as cramped and misleading as fig. 27b, and even a map based only in part on those passages might partially retain those defects. The map is also limited in its capacity to convey complex relationships. Consider, for example, the addition to fig. 23b of a conflate manuscript drawn 40% from A, 40% from B, 20% from C. Its bearing from ω must lie between those of A and B, its main sources; but then it is indistinguishable from a mixture of AB alone. Again, in any tradition comprising three manuscripts ABC, such as those of fig. 22-25, suppose that we inserted for each manuscript five (say) instances where that manuscript was correct against the agreement of the others. Then the number of divergences between AB would rise by 5+5=10, as would the number of divergences between Aω, and similarly for all other pairs. The rank ordering, and therefore the map, would remain unchanged. However, any evaluative policy founded on the map would fall, since any manuscript even singly might now preserve the truth. Hence even when a map has straightforward implications for evaluation and history, the risk remains that some important relationship has been overlooked. A partial answer is that checks may exist. The former complication (regarding the manuscript conflated from ABC) might be traced through the entry for C and the conflate manuscript in the table of common error percentages (§4.5); the latter (each manuscript alone preserving some true readings) might be suspected from the incidence of unique preservation among determinate passages. If such danger signals are absent, however, and the map gives reasonable results, it seems over-cautious to posit further complications. A problem in applying the map to evaluation is that the same error may arise by coincidence in two manuscripts which happen to subtend an obtuse angle at ω. A similar difficulty limits the stemma. Intrinsic considerations may indicate the likelihood of polygenesis of a given reading. The map, then, must be used not in isolation but in conjunction with the error percentages. Where either method is indecisive, caution is necessary, as §6.3 illustrates. In some respects the map is more limited than the stemma, but in other respects less so, whence the hope that the new methods may illuminate some traditions where the stemma fails. The virtue of the map is that of statistical procedures in general, namely the capacity to reveal fundamental trends, even though random fluctuations may disguise them, amid a mass of data. The genealogical relationships, however entangled, are fundamental in that they abide throughout the text. They are disguised by a host of sporadic (if not random) factors, e.g. coincidence, conjecture, physical damage and critical misjudgments among the supposedly determinate passages. The following experiment shows what the map can recover and apply to evaluation and history.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6. An experiment 6.1. Dom Quentin, to test his own theory, cleverly imagined how twenty-one imaginary scribes (B-Z), after the genealogy of fig. 28, might copy a Latin passage by Florus of Lyons. 80 Let us suppose that manuscripts N-Z alone survive. The apparatus criticus presents 49 independent (though nos. 36 and 38 interact) variants, cited against the lost original: Anastasia primo diram 1 et immitem custodiam a viro suo 2 Publio 3 passa est, in qua tamen a Chrysogono, confessore Christi 4 , multum consolata 5 et confortata est. Deinde 6 a praefecto Illyrici 7 in gravissima 8 aeque et 9 diutina 8 10 ustodia 8 macerata est: in qua duobus mensibus 11 refecta est caelestibus escis 12 per sanctam 13 Theodoten 14 , quae prius 15 martyrium passa 16 est. Deinde navi 17 imposita cum ducentis 18 viris et septingentis 19 feminis, ut demergerentur 20 in mari 21 , perlata est ad insulas Palmarias ubi martyrium consummavit 22 : et omnes qui 23 cum illa 24 venerant 25 variis interfectionibus martyrium 26 celebrarunt. Inter quos omnes 27 , unus erat 28 nomine 29 Eutychianus 30 , innocentissimae naturae 31 , qui sublatis 32 sibi, cum dives 33 esset, omnibus facultatibus 34 , tacuit 32 , nihil 35 cogitans nihilque metuens 36 , nisi hoc, ne facultates ac divitias fidei 37 perderet 38 39 . Quotiescumque denique 40 fuisset 41 auditus, quotiescumque 42 interrogatus 43 nihil aliud dicebat 44 45 : Christum 46 mihi non tollet 47 48 etiam qui 47 caput abstulerit 47 49 . An investigator was now imagined who, finding almost half these passages determinate, made twenty correct and four wrong decisions. The correct decisions were in passages nos. 3 (Publio), 4, 5, 10, 11, 14, 17, 22, 23, 25, 30, 32, 35-38, 40, 42, 43, and 47, and the wrong decisions in passages nos. 9 (atque), 21, 34 and 48. The locations are randomly chosen. These decisions mean merely to reflect a particular level of performance, which one hopes will seem realistic: the critic is right in 41% of passages, hesitant in 51%, confident but wrong in 8%. How credible each decision might seem to real-life specialists on Florus' writings is beside the point. 6.2. The determinate passages yield the following error percentages: TABLE 2 N O P Q R S T V X Y Z N 38 + 0 4 4 29 33 33 33 12 29 29 O 25 17 17 12 4 4 4 12 17 17 P 25 25 17 8 8 8 4 21 21 Q 25 17 8 8 8 4 21 21 R 42 25 25 25 8 38 38 S 42 42 42 17 33 33 T 42 + 42 17 33 33 V 50 17 42 42 X 25 + 17 17 Y 58 58 Z 58 + Note the distortions introduced by the four wrong decisions. In the construction of the map the few unique variants were included despite §5.7, as T and Z would otherwise be indistinguishable from S and Y. 81 The measures of distance (not tabulated here) between the manuscripts (including ω) yield the map of fig. 29. 6.3. Would these results yield correct decisions in the indeterminate passages and detect the four wrong decisions? The first pair of rival readings are diram NOPQRX, duram STVYZ. While diram is attested by NO, never caught erring together, the lowest error percentage among the pairs formed from STVYZ is 33; moreover, NOPQRX surround ω while STVYZ all stand 'west' of it; hence diram is rightly chosen. The truth is identified no less readily in thirteen other indeterminate passages: nos. 7, 8, 13, 18, 20, 24, 26, 28, 29, 33, 44, 46 and 49. In passage no. 2, N stands alone. While the lowest error percentage for any pair among OPQRSTVXYZ is 4 (OS), the figure for N exceeds 38; the odds favour the majority reading, especially since the percentage of 4 results from a single passage (no. 48). In confirmation, O-Z surround ω on the map. Great imbalances in error percentages, and the fact that one group surrounds ω, similarly identify the correct reading in four other indeterminate passages: nos. 12, 15, 27 and 31. In passage no. 15, the group thus preferred are in the minority. OPQX surround ω (see fig. 20), while the majority (NRSTVYZ) lie within the wedge NωR, which spans only 66° at ω; OPQX also yield a better error percentage (4 PX versus 25 RS ). In one wrongly determinate passage (no. 48), where the investigator followed NR against the rest, the error percentage of NR (29) and the fact that they subtend only 66° at ω should make him think again. So far the error percentages and the map have favoured the same reading. Where they are contradictory, or even where either is equivocal, the decision is doubtful. No. 6 splits between NRSTVYZ, OPQ and X. The error percentages (25 RS , 17 OP , 25+) and the angles subtended at ω (66°, 40°, 0) are indecisive. Fig. 28 confirms that any of the groups could agree in error—e.g. NRSTVYZ in L's, OPQ in O's, X in its own—so that one is right to hesitate. Again in no. 19, NSTVX and PQRYZ show similar error percentages (12 NX , 17 PR ) and neither subtends an obtuse angle at ω. Here too the genealogy shows that the agreement pattern is indecisive, since NSTVX might reproduce an error of C, and PQRYZ an error of P. Sometimes the percentages seem decisive but the map suggests caution. In passage no. 45, OX depart from the majority, whose error percentage is far lower (4 NP against 12 OX ). Yet OX subtend 154° at ω, an angle large enough to suggest that they never err together, which is in fact true. Their error percentage of 12 reflects three wrong decisions among the determinate passages (nos. 9, 34 and 48). The map, however, which utilises all the distances, in effect rejects the high error percentage of OX as inconsistent with the overall structure. This will give pause to the investigator both here and in the three misjudged determinate passages. Again, in the split NPQRSTVYZ:O:X at passage no. 41, the error percentages strongly favour the majority (4 NP :25:25+), which are in fact correct. On the map, however, the decision is less certain: the majority span at ω an angle (&lt;NωP) barely obtuse at 96°. This should alert us to the possibility, with this pattern of agreement, that O or X might be correct and NPQRSTVYZ might reproduce an error of D (see fig. 28). Conversely, the error percentages may modify the conclusions of the map. In the split OPQR:NSTVXYZ at passage no. 16, the angles subtended at ω (69° and 120°) favour the latter group, but the error percentages are equal (12 OR , 12 NX ). The pattern is therefore equivocal. Indeed, over its two occurrences, NSTVXYZ err (through C) in no. 16, while OPQR err in no. 21. Even clearer, on the map, seems the choice between NRSTVXYZ and OPQ in passage no. 39, the angles subtended at ω being 136° (&gt;RωX) and 40° (&lt;OωQ). The error percentages, however, do not differ overwhelmingly, being 8 RX versus 17 OP , or, if no. 48 has by now been dropped from the determinate passages, 9 RX (= 2/23 x 100) versus 13 OP (= 3/23 x 100). This pattern too is best treated as equivocal. Over its three occurrences, NRSTVXYZ are correct in no. 39 but err (through C) in nos. 25 and 36. Altogether, nineteen of the twenty-five indeterminate passages are now correctly decided, while six (nos. 6, 16, 19, 39, 41, 45) show an agreement pattern favouring no one reading. Of the four wrong determinate readings, one (no. 48) is discredited, but the agreement pattern will seem indecisive in the other three (nos. 9, 21, 34). Equivocal patterns are commoner in open traditions, as new cross-currents normally mean that new combinations of manuscripts share a source and are therefore liable to err together. Whereas an uncontaminated tradition could show at most one indecisive two-way split pattern, three appear here, namely OPQ:rell., OPQR:rell., and OPQRYZ:rell. The split OX:rell. will also seem ambiguous, as already stated, but in fact is not: OX deserve priority, as they have no common source except the original, while D is a source of the remainder. 6.4. For one who knows the genealogy, it is hard to imagine how much the investigator might reconstruct. He would note that O lies to the 'north-east' of ω, X to the 'south-east' and the remainder to the 'west'. Within the 'westerly' group, RYZ and especially PQ share a 'northerly' tendency with O, and NSTV a 'southerly' tendency with X. 82 Provided that he is no longer certain that OX err together, he may draw fig. 30a. While the apparatus criticus sometimes confirms the division PQRYZ: NSTV of the 'westerly' manuscripts (nos. 4, 10, etc.), R or YZ or all three often join some or all of NSTV in what the critic now sees as error (nos. 1, 3, 15, 38, etc.); hence some adjustments (fig. 30b). The inferred manuscripts a βγε prove to be the lost E, D, C and L respectively. 83 While a complete reconstruction could not be expected, this outline does explain the main patterns of agreement in error. 6.5. Dom Quentin's manufactured tradition does not provide an ideal test. A controlled experiment with many subjects copying according to a contaminated genealogy withheld from the investigator would have been more realistic. But extensive trials with hypothetical examples are essential to the development of text-critical methods. Failure in such a trial indicates at the very least a limitation, if not a fatal flaw. It should be obvious that any method must start from a statement of the assumptions limiting it, and be derived logically from these. Too many investigators, however, compose or borrow procedures whose intricacies so absorb them that they lose sight of the underlying logic. The justification for every result—the priority accorded to this combination of manuscripts, the common ancestor posited for that group, and so on—must be clear. An elaborate technique is no substitute for a sound rationale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Any manuscript in the tradition is either (a) lost and without extant progeny, (b) a lost manuscript of which one direct copy survives or leaves extant progeny, (c) a lost manuscript of which two or more direct copies survive or leave extant progeny, or (d) extant. Any line of the stemma joins two manuscripts of types (c-d), and conceals any number of manuscripts of type (b), whose errors are indistinguishable from errors of the manuscript at the bottom of the line. Among the manuscripts along and at the bottom of the line, one identifiable error arising in any of them, is all that (v) and (vi) require. 2 The 'ancestors' and 'descendants' of a manuscript are here defined to include the manuscript itself. 3 The term is due to Sir Walter W. Greg, The Calculus of Variants (1927), p. 12. 4 The above procedure is due to J. Froger, La critique des textes et son automatisation (Paris 1968), p. 74, though Froger does not normally apply it to error sets. Equivalently, Greg (pp. 45 ff) would nest the error sets, in the form [(A)(B)] [C(D)], and draw a stemma showing an exclusive common ancestor for every bracketed group and no other. 5 Textual Criticism (tr. Barbara Flower; 1958 3 ). 6 This rendering of Froger's term "enchaînement" (p. 44) appears in D. Najock's article cited in n. 50. 7 A case noted by Greg is the "ambiguity of three texts" (p. 21). A general explanation (not supplied by Froger) of the ambiguity of every pattern, however complex, of agreement and disagreement is as follows. When a relevant manuscript errs, the line above (or containing) it is severed, so that the stemma divides in two; a three-way split results from simultaneous errors that sever two lines; and so on. Now if the orientation is changed, the new stemma will generate the same splits, in the event of error(s) in the manuscript(s) at the lower end(s) of the same line(s). 8 This can be shown to follow from the consistency of the true error sets. 9 Storia della tradizione e critica del testo (Florence, 1952 2 ), p. 126. With n manuscripts the total number of possible error sets is (2n-2) if the tradition is uncontaminated but (2 n -2) if it is totally open. 10 "La tradition manuscrite du Lai de l'Ombre ", Romania , LIV (1928), 161-196, 321-356: 340. These are just two (nos. 1 and 5) of eleven pedigrees which, Bédier claimed, were all admitted by the textual evidence. The other nine, however, presuppose a multiple original or different verdicts on truth and error, against assumptions (i) and (vi) above. 11 M.P. Weitzman, "Computer Simulation of the Development of Manuscript Traditions", ALLC (= Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing) Bulletin , X (1982), 55-59. 12 For example, the errors of ABCG may be due not to the inferred ancestor w (fig. 3a) but to the different genealogy of fig. 3b. 13 If Froger's method of construction was used, we may have to re-phrase: "part of the superior group has been known elsewhere to preserve the truth against the inferior group among others". In fig. 2d, for example, an error in A may not have been identified, but, given a split A:BCD, we may prefer BCD on the grounds that (i) CD alone are sometimes correct against A and B, and (ii) no determinate passage suggests that BCD err against A. 14 One can readily check that Bédier's alternative pedigrees make no difference to the evaluative policy. In fig. 3b, for example, one would still hesitate before ABCG:DE, prefer ABDE to CG, and so on. 15 M. Bévenot, The Tradition of Manuscripts: A Study in the Transmission of St. Cyprian's Treatises (1961), pp. 96-123. 16 One could occasionally invoke coincidence, or suppose that ABCD derived from a faulty archetype which either AB or CD corrected by conjecture, but generally agreement must go back to a common source on which the remaining manuscripts do not wholly depend. 17 This distinction is due to S.

It agrees with 2 Cor. 5:14 and Theodoret's commentary thereon (Migne, Patrologia Graeca , LXXXII, 409 B 10-11, misquoted by Canivet); its briefer rivals can be attributed to eye-skip. 46 "Les états du texte d'un Herbier médiéval: Essai de classement automatique", Revue: LASLA (1980), no. 2, pp. 15-58; see especially pp. 24f, 33ff. 47 "A Taxonomic Study of the Manuscript Tradition of Juvenal", Museum Helveticum , XXV (1968), 101-138; "Numerical Taxonomy and some Primary Manuscripts of the Gospels", Journal of Theological Studies , XX (1969), 389-406.

"Ancient" means "true, and not found by conjecture, or else attested by an ancient source unavailable to the scribes". 58 The statistics of common error sometimes yield a "serviceable" stemma for a few of the manuscripts, as West shows (pp. 39f), but not in traditions as complicated as Cyprian's. 59 Pasquali (see n. 9), pp. 211 ff; R. D. Dawe, The Collation and Investigation of Manuscripts of Aeschylus (1964), Ch. 5. 60 The modification is for the sake of the theory here developed; the original definition remains ideal for its own purpose, viz the selection of manuscripts for the apparatus criticus . 61 In fact coincidence and conjecture (classed under scribal behaviour) can have the same result (§1.1) as contamination (here termed genealogical) and increase team size. Ideally, cases of coincidence and conjecture are eliminated. 62 West, "Tragica I", Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies , XXIV (1977), 89-103, argues for eleven; Dawe (see n. 59) and D. Page, "Notes on Manuscripts of Aeschylus" in J. L. Heller (ed.), Serta Turyniana (1974), pp. 227-238, together reach about twenty. 63 Similarly Froger (see n. 4), pp. 117ff. A two-way split between separate errors, such as would result if ω and D erred separately (whence separate errors in ABC, which are no genealogical family, and in D), similarly deserves exclusion. 64 These examples come from Greg (see n. 3), pp. 34-39, though Greg's approach is more elaborate and yields different results. 65 It is worth checking the few errors ascribed to the preferred group. If these prove doubtful, the chance element disappears. 66 A less than overwhelming difference would not decide the issue. H. Fränkel, Einleitung zur kritischen Ausgabe der Argonautika des Apollonios (Göttingen, 1964), pp. 132 f, considers two manuscripts (GL) which, over the determinate passages where they diverge, err respectively 62% and 38% of the time. L is the more reliable but, Fränkel observes, the policy of following L in all indeterminate passages would exaggerate the difference in the error frequencies. The greater the imbalance, however, the less serious the exaggeration. 67 More generally, consider any set of at least three manuscripts. Suppose that every possible group which can be formed from that set and whose size is an even number shows one exclusive error. Then the statistics remain unchanged if "even" is replaced by "odd". 68 Where all the manuscripts are divided between separate errors, the 'best' reading could be any of them indifferently. 69 The procedure here used, called 'Minissa', was developed by E. E. Roskam and J. C. Lingoes, A Mathematical and Empirical Analysis of Two Dimensional Scaling Algorithms = Psychometrika , XXXVIII (1973), monograph supplement. A computer programme is included in Edinburgh University's MDS(X) series. 70 In contrast, MDS generates the 'best-fitting' map in however many dimensions we care to specify in advance (in this case, two). 71 Monat, using factor analysis, had to add lacunose witnesses to the map separately (see n. 52; p. 316). Again, Griffith was forced, when one of the manuscripts in his study of Juvenal broke off, to compile separate maps for the sections before and after (see n. 53; p. 80). 72 Unique errors in (say) A affect neither side; their contributions to 'no. of errors in A' and 'no. of divergences between AB' cancel. 73 Theoretically the result could be negative (and interpreted as zero). With one determinate passage where AB are correct against other witnesses, and one indeterminate passage where AB disagree, the formula gives 1/2(0+0-50) = -25. Note that three percentage distances not based on the same field of variants need not obey the triangular inequality (that none can exceed the sum of the other two); hence the possibility that d(A,ω) + d(B,ω) - d (A,B)&lt;o. 74 Unless all four points coincide, or unless we invoke complex numbers in three dimensions, e.g. ω = (o,o,o), A = (100/3,o,o), B = 100/3 (-1,i,1), C = 100/3 (-1,i,-1). 75 The scale, less important than the shape of the map, is chosen to equate the totals of the textual and map distances. 76 In the terms of §5.1, the best text recoverable from ABC (occupying the central point of the map) is also a mixture of AC alone; hence B cannot prevail over the agreement of AC. 77 This site for α, the supposed ancestor, ensures that the paths ωαA, ωαB and AαB all embrace obtuse angles, as would be expected if such an ancestor actually existed. The paths ωαA and ωαB would ideally be straight, as both A and B descend from α; but as straight lines (or rather a single line) would falsely suggest that A descended from B or vice versa, the two paths would bend away from each other (cf fig. 23b) and each include an obtuse angle. Again, as α's text could be made up from A and B, it should ideally lie along the line joining them, but in practice the angle AαB too would be obtuse. 78 Similarly Najock (see n. 50), pp. 51ff, found factor analysis inapplicable when four or more manuscripts derived independently from the original. 79 Called 'stress' and 'coefficient of alienation'; see Lingoes and Roskam (n. 69 above), pp. 11, 21. 80 Drawn freely from two alternative versions in Migne, Patrologia Latina , XCIV, 1141 f.

      <field name="heading_text">Normalisation of Accidentals in Middle English Texts: The Paradox of Thomas Hoccleve * by D. C. Greetham</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A short while ago in these pages, G. Thomas Tanselle quite properly characterised the editors of mediaeval, biblical, and classical texts as having paid very much more attention to charting the transmission of these texts than to investigating the likely auctorial patterns of usage —particularly with regard to accidentals. 1 In this predilection, the editors of such "ancient" texts had behaved rather differently from their colleagues working in the post-Gutenberg periods, for with the frequent availability of later texts in potentially authoritative printed and manuscript forms, "modern" editors had quite appropriately argued over the relative value of these different stages of the text as representing auctorial intentions (both original and final). From these concerns came, for example, Greg's famous distinction between substantives and accidentals. To the mediaevalist, biblicist, and classicist, however, such passions seemed either remote from or irrelevant to the conditions under which they laboured. "Ancient" texts were typically extant only in scribal copies often several hundred years removed from any auctorial intention, and the texts transmitted in these non-authoritative documents had often been copied and recopied so many times that the best one might hope for would be a resuscitation of the so-called "archetype" for the extant manuscripts. From these assumptions came, therefore, not accidentals and substantives, nor indeed an articulated copy-text theory analogous to Greg's, but rather a fascination with stemmatics and filiation, with genealogy, conflation and contamination. The "ancient" editors got Lachmann, Quentin, and Maas, not Greg, Bowers, and Tanselle. And beyond the archetype in Maas' charting 2 of the Lachmannian system, there was a terra incognita where the editor dared not stray. These dispositions and theoretical interests, arising as they did out of differing documentary circumstances, seemed to offer little chance that editors of the older material would ever need to consider the problems of their authors' preferences (especially in accidentals), since the forms of the text had been so moulded by scribal accretion and interpretation. But in the editing of one ancient field at least—Middle English—there have been signs of a change. When, for example, George Kane and E. Talbot Donaldson invoked the concept of a "corrupt" B archetype in order to facilitate both their denial of authority to the B manuscripts of Piers Plowman , and their consequent smoothing of the B text to fit the pattern established by the A version of the poem, 3 they were making a leap beyond documentary evidence, beyond the infamous archetype, into this very terra incognita of auctorial intention that was supposed to be off-limits to the editor of mediaeval texts. The problem with this particular leap, and the source of the somewhat contentious debate that has surrounded the edition since its publication ten years ago, was that there seemed to be no readily-accepted "authority" (except for the editors' proclaimed "knowledge" of their author—derived itself from the "corrupt" documents carrying his text) which could be appealed to as an arbiter of critical decisions. There were no auctorial drafts, no fair copies, no corrected proofs, no annotations on a published text—nor even any auctorial correspondence on such basic issues as whether each line was supposed to fulfil "perfect" alliterative requirements. In sum, one either had to accept Kane and Donaldson's word that they had created Langland for the first time (virtually in despite of the documented textual transmission), or seek to re-edit the work oneself. 4 Perhaps, after all, it might be safer to stay with a version of "best-text" theory, and not to wander into the uncharted territory beyond the archetype. The ambiguous status of the archetype (and the question of editorial fidelity to its resuscitation) has recently been raised again in Middle English, this time with a very clear connection to the equally problematic status of the accidentals in mediaeval texts, and to the validity of copy-text theory as it relates to those accidentals. The editors of the Hoccleve edition (and specifically of his major work, the Regement of Princes ) have been faced with an unusual question: is it possible, considering the peculiar conditions of Hoccleve's texts, to combine orthodox "classical" base-text theory (stemmatics) with orthodox "modern" copy-text theory to produce for the first time an edition of the text of the substantives and auctorial accidentals of a mediaeval work which survives only in scribal copies? Clearly, the immediate and sensible answer to this question would be "No", for the forty-three scribal copies of the Regement , even though as a group displaying a remarkable degree of conservatism in copying, should not logically provide access to auctorial accidentals in a work which, like virtually all other mediaeval texts, does not exist in holograph, in rough draft, in annotated first edition, or in any other "authorised" form. 5 The major qualification to the question, however, is that nearly all of Hoccleve's other works do survive in holograph, and that it might therefore be worth looking at the accidentals of these manuscripts to determine whether there were patterns of auctorial usage that could be employed in the editing of the Regement . This process, if successful, would certainly take us beyond the archetype of the Regement , but in accidentals not in substantives. The "classical" base-text, in collation with the forty-two other extant witnesses of the Regement , would be used in a perfectly conventional manner to establish the "meaning" or the "content" of the text; the paradigms derived from the holographs of the other works (if such paradigms were genuinely demonstrable) would not weaken the status of this orthodox base-text, but would provide it with an overlay of "surface features" that could be shown to represent auctorial intention with regard to accidentals. The entire enterprise would clearly be a hybrid affair and would no doubt provoke (and possibly antagonise) loyalists of both orthodoxies; but the possibility seemed worth pursuing, especially if it could be established that some degree of consistency in the Hoccleve holographs was at least likely. This supposition depended in part upon current research on the much wider question of the movement towards standardisation of orthography in the fifteenth century, and of course, Hoccleve's place in any such movement. It has long been accepted that some degree of standardisation in spelling took place in England during the late Middle Ages. The main influences on this tendency towards a uniform orthography have been variously described as technological (the invention of the printing press, and the resultant fixing of "conservative" forms); religious (the wide dissemination of Wycliffite tracts, in which individual scribal idiosyncracies were levelled out by what was essentially a "factory" system of copying); literary (the dominance of Chaucer and his followers, with the resultant ubiquitousness of South-East Midlands forms in the corpus of literary manuscripts, and subsequently in their incunabula descendants); economic (the growth of London as the centre of trade and finance, coupled with the new sedentary—as opposed to peripatetic—authority of parliament and crown in Westminster); and, most recently, bureaucratic (the installation of a professional class of administrative civil servants to run the business of government). For the student of orthography and spelling history, this last area is clearly of great potential significance (if only because government agencies and their clerical staffs tend to generate so much paperwork). For the Hocclevean editor, textual or literary critic, the bureaucratic move towards standardisation is of paramount importance, for while Hoccleve was indeed an avowed and theoretically devoted Chaucerian (and could therefore have been greatly influenced by the supposed dominance of Chaucerian forms in the fifteenth-century copying of literature), he was also a bureaucrat, in fact, one of the clerks whose major responsibility it was to put into documentary practice the orthographic reforms which characterised the administration of Chancery and its related offices in the fifteenth century. 6 Hoccleve worked as a clerk in the office of the Privy Seal for many years. Indeed, his labours as clerk, and his supposedly poor remuneration as a government hack, become one of the pervasive topics of his poetry. 7 As in the case of Chaucer, who was also a government employee, we do not have any great body of auctorial documents of a professional nature (only one of the identified holographs is "bureaucratic" or "non-literary"), so we cannot directly examine Hoccleve's clerical contribution to the orthographic reforms. However, since Hoccleve was an author as well as scribe, he did leave a considerable corpus of literary materials in his own hand. While, therefore, the content of these manuscripts 8 is clearly very different from that to be expected in the documents typically copied in either Privy Seal or Chancery, their very existence is so unusual (perhaps unique), compared with the scant holograph materials otherwise encountered in Middle English verse, 9 that the Hoccleve manuscripts, whether or not they provided confirmation of the bureaucratic reforms in orthography, would offer a great opportunity to study at first hand the accidentals of a mediaeval poet. It was, therefore, with these two concerns in mind, (the place of the Hoccleve holographs in documenting the standardisation of spelling, and the evidence they might give of auctorially-preferred accidentals), that the Hoccleve editorial team began to chart the usage patterns in the identified holographs. It should be emphasised that the primary purpose of this investigation was always editorial, and not linguistic, palaeographic, or historical. As mentioned above, we were frankly concerned as editors to discover whether there was a sufficient degree of standardisation already present in Hoccleve's usage to allow us to employ the paradigms available in the holographs in the attempt to reconstruct the accidentals of the one major Hocclevean work (the Regement ) which had not survived in an auctorial fair copy. The analysis of the accidentals of the Hoccleve manuscripts could obviously have significance to historians, palaeographers, and linguists, but our aims were more modest (or perhaps more specific): to overcome the editorial and theoretical limitation traditionally associated with Middle English studies (and outlined at the opening of this essay), that the most one could hope for was to resuscitate the substantives of the archetype. The editorial philosophy and procedures of the Hoccleve edition are, therefore, a combination of "classical" base-text Lachmannian methodology and "new bibliographical" copy-text theory derived from the Greg-Bowers school. 10 However, while the "reach beyond the archetype" might seem to replicate the Kane-Donaldson intent and method mentioned above, in fact the Hoccleve edition possesses the one editorial and technical tool missing from Kane-Donaldson's critical equipment—a "control" derived directly from auctorial documents, which can then be used to substantiate the emendations in accidentals made in the copy-text (emendations which clearly extend beyond the archetype because they do not depend for their authority upon any document, copy-text or otherwise, carrying the text of the work being edited). The immediate problem for the Hoccleve editors was that the combination of two orthodoxies meant that within mediaeval studies, there was no developed or consistent body of textual theory relating either to the choice of copy-text on "modern" principles or to the normalisation of base-text by reference to documented auctorial preference. 11 As practising editors, we are convinced that the paucity of textual theory in this area is directly the result of the typical character of the documentary materials with which most mediaevalists have had to work: scribal copies at several removes from auctorial accidence, 12 with no "control" group of auctorial holographs to consult. However, this does not mean that such general conditions should determine textual theory and practice where some external evidence is available. In principle, therefore, we would endorse the position of Martin L. West in his Textual Criticism and Editorial Technique Applicable to Greek and Latin Texts (1973): As a general rule it would seem most rational to impose spelling that the original author is most likely to have used (for which the manuscript tradition may not be the best evidence). It is true that he himself may have been inconsistent, and it may be argued that the best manuscript authority should be followed on each occasion. But this will be no reliable guide as to his practice; we shall surely come nearer the truth by regularizing the spelling than by committing ourselves to the vagaries of the tradition. (p. 64) This position has recently been most convincingly extended (via Greg) to all editing of non-auctorial documents, in the Tanselle SB article on "ancient" editing cited earlier. Tanselle, arguing that West and other biblical, classical, and mediaeval editors sharing this position are in fact merely fulfilling Greg's orthodox view in copy-text theory of printed texts, claims that Greg's theory may be (and ought to be) extended into other fields where the problems are, in fact, similar, even though the documents appear to be of a different order. 13 In other words, that (as Housman had objected long ago, and as Greg was also to recognise) there would always be a temptation to yield to the "tyranny of the copy-text" 14 for all features of the text, and consequently to reduce the prerogative of editorial judgement. This temptation to succumb to such tyranny should be resisted, for, as Tanselle notes (p. 65), "any feature of the copy-text that one has good reason for emending can be emended without affecting the status of the copy-text as the text one falls back on at points where no such reason exists to dictate the choice among variants" (i.e., copy-text as "presumptive authority"). This means that even if only some of the "surface features" of the copy-text could be emended by reference to auctorial usage, these changes must be undertaken, admitting that the results will be imperfect, though less imperfect than if no such emendations were attempted. "Indeed, one must ask whether for a work of any period there is ever a justification, from a scholarly point of view, of any aim regarding accidentals other than the reconstruction of the author's own practice; however imperfectly that aim may be realized in many instances, it is the only aim consistent with the view that accidentals are integral to a text" (Tanselle, p. 43). A similar view (and one of particular value to the Hoccleve editors' articulation of a theory of accidentals in a field where such theory has not hitherto been confronted adequately) has been expressed by Fredson Bowers. "Unless Hoccleve were really random and indifferent in spelling, even a false consistency if based on your selection of his authorial mss preferences would conform to Greg's criterion of reproducing accidentals as close as possible to the author's time although admittedly artificial in consistency as his exact own." (Correspondence, 30 April, 1982). If we were to aim for a greater success than this limited, but necessary, stage, Bowers believes that the Hoccleve editors would have to demonstrate two conditions: a) that Hoccleve is consistent enough that "normalizing would not distort his variability by imposing a false and quite artificial uniformity, and b) that on the evidence [we could justify] extending normalization to words not in authorial mss on morphological considerations" (Bowers, loc. cit. ). While acknowledging Greg's warning that normalisation of an early text entails considerable philological difficulties (a position the Hoccleve editors would certainly endorse, both in theory and in practice), Bowers nevertheless believes that Greg's copy-text theory, developed for conditions unforeseen by its originator, would tend to support "any attempt, whether or not synthetic, to reproduce accidentals that were at least in part Hoccleve's own and the rest consistent with the time, as against a late scribal copy" (Bowers, loc cit. ). 15 Because the conditions of Hoccleve's text are so very different from those encountered elsewhere in the editing of Middle English literature, it is clear that the proposal to normalise by reference to auctorially-derived paradigms of accidental usage will appear as an anomaly to other mediaevalists; but it may not just offend the practice of medievalists, it may also call into question some of the theoretical assumptions that editors of mediaeval texts have long cherished. I believe it would be fair to say that many mediaevalists still regard any "mixed" text with horror, preferring to trust to the authority of a single document, rather than risk exposing the fragility of editorial judgement. This belief explains in part why we are anxious to emphasise the dual orthodoxies of our editorial method, and to stress the continuity of a developed textual theory in perhaps unfamiliar circumstances. Despite the peculiarities of the Hoccleve text, we believe that the two lines of textual theory (one running from Lachmann to Quentin, Bédier, Dearing and beyond, the other from Greg to Bowers to Tanselle) may both find a logical relevance in the unusually "mixed" conditions of the Regement and its related documents. It is not so much that we are perversely iconoclastic in textual method, but that the Hoccleve text encourages a balanced fidelity to two principles, both of which are present in our procedures. Having established that the normalisation of copy-text accidentals by reference to auctorial preference was a viable procedure at least theoretically, we then had to create a model for such normalisation, charting the potential relationships among copy-text, the holographs, and a final edited text. This model had to consider the various "levels" of consistency of usage that might be discoverable in the basic documents, and then determine the nature and degree of editorial prerogative that should be expected in transferring the findings of the textual analysis into an edited text that would be responsive to the author's observed intentions, the textual conditions of the documents themselves, and a reader's quite proper expectations of editorial as well as auctorial consistency. As will be explained in detail later in this essay, the holograph accidentals were listed in a new computer program which we called HOCCLEX (the same name being used for the resulting lexicon and its statistics), and an additional dictionary of normalised forms was created on microcomputer under the name NORMLEX. These normalised forms, based upon well-attested patterns in HOCCLEX, would be used for the "morphological extension" which Bowers had rightly insisted would have to be a part of our editorial rationale. The resulting model (somewhat simplified in the chart below) attempts to codify the theoretically inevitable relationships that the data-systems embedded in HOCCLEX, NORMLEX, COPY-TEXT, and EDITED TEXT would create.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Normalisation Model Explanation: This is not a model illustrating the descending significance or the statistical incidence of actual forms, but rather a logical arrangement of "levels" of normalisation, based upon the three major sources for producing the accidentals of the edited text—the HOCCLEX concordance (including a reverse lexicon, on which see below), the NORMLEX "special" dictionary of normalised forms not extant in HOCCLEX, and the copy-text, BL MS. Arundel 38. Furthermore, it is primarily a model for the likely editorial treatment of individual word-forms (or more properly word-form types), not for a system of accidence —either Hoccleve's or that of the scribe of Arundel. It is possible that such a system could be constructed from the evidence lying behind the model, but our unit of comparative data is first always the specific form as it occurs in a specific place or places in the text (i.e., only later, usually through NORMLEX or the reverse lexicon, is a formal morphological pattern extending beyond the immediate evidence of HOCCLEX transferred to the edited text). Similarly, the model—as it reflects our editorial method—is not a lexical study per se ; that is, it is concerned with the morphology of the word as it occurs in the text, and not with its lexical identity or history. This is an important consideration in interpreting the model, for while a particular form of a word might not exist in one column, the word itself (in a related form) could very well be extant. This explains the apparent anomaly of level 12, where there is no entry in either the HOCCLEX or the COPY-TEXT columns, and yet there is a 100% entry in the NORMLEX column: i.e., the particular form (say, a third-person singular of a regular verb) happens not to exist in the texts from which HOCCLEX is derived, and the copy-text is either very ambiguous in its preferred forms for this verb in this specific inflected form, or uses an inflection which does not appear in HOCCLEX for this verb, or perhaps not for any verb. Nonetheless, it would be possible to construct the appropriate preferred Hocclevean inflection from HOCCLEX and to read that, without ambiguity, into NORMLEX—in an example of the occasional employment of the general principles of accidence as a secondary editorial activity, based on the evidence of HOCCLEX and NORMLEX together. Anomalies such as this notwithstanding, the model still functions primarily as a record of the specific form in the specific word, not of the putative degree of consistency in the idiolect as a whole. In fact, as is readily seen, an entry appears in the NORMLEX column only when there is no entry in the HOCCLEX column; that is, recourse to NORMLEX is taken only when a highly conservative use of HOCCLEX will not produce a well-attested form for the specific inflection (or root) needed. The 100% HOCCLEX forms would be automatically read into NORMLEX but would not need to be cited in editorial work, hence their not recurring in the NORMLEX column. This simply confirms the relatively greater authority of HOCCLEX over NORMLEX (even though, in this case, they carry identical data, so that no choice has to be made between them). The entire procedure is, of course, merely another (post-classical) occurrence of the basic principle of "analogy" as defined by the Alexandrian librarians, editors, and grammarians. One final caveat : since we have not yet created a complete concordance of all copy-text forms to parallel HOCCLEX for the holographs, any statistics cited in the COPY-TEXT column are inevitably less firm (but also less significant for a critical as opposed to a diplomatic edition) than those for HOCCLEX. Frankly, we are not convinced that such a concordance would be of any great value editorially (although it could be of use to palaeographers, philologists, and dialecticians). For although Arundel happens to obey Gregian requirements for copy-text as regards its accidentals, it is essentially being used as a vehicle to present comparative data for the recognition and, where necessary, the construction, of auctorial intentions. HOCCLEX NORMLEX COPY-TEXT EDITED TEXT 1. 100% usage - = 100% usage HOCCLEX a &amp; COPY-TEXT 2. 100% usage - = high usage HOCCLEX b 3. 100% usage - = indifferent HOCCLEX c 4. 100% usage - = low usage HOCCLEX d 5. 100% usage - - HOCCLEX e 6. 90%-99% usage - = 100% usage HOCCLEX f 7. 1%-90% usage - = 100% usage HOCCLEX g or COPY-TEXT 8. - 100% usage = 100% usage NORMLEX h 9. - 100% usage = high usage NORMLEX i 10. - 100% usage = indifferent NORMLEX j 11. - 100% usage = low usage NORMLEX k 12. - 100% usage - NORMLEX l 13. - - = 100% usage COPY-TEXT m 14. indifferent indifferent indifferent COPY-TEXT n or HOCCLEX or NORMLEX Within the theoretical parameters described by this ideal model for normalisation, the Hoccleve editors could now deal with the lexicon itself. Working with Gary Tobey, Charles Wilcox, and John Southard of the Computer Science department of Adelphi University, and using a Prime 800 computer and a FORTRAN language, Peter Farley entered the accidentals of the holograph manuscripts to produce the raw data from which the editorial implementation of normalisation theory could proceed. Initially, we had thought that John Fisher's computer-based analysis of Chancery English (which he very kindly made available to us on tape) might be used for morphological extension, in those circumstances where no paradigm could be discovered in the holographs; for Fisher's material (based on a selection of 90,000 words from public documents) was very much wider in scope than the slim corpus of the Hoccleve manuscripts (6143 word entries in the main Hoccleve concordance). The Fisher concordance is presented in so-called KWIC (keyword-in-context) format, where the main entry occurs as the central word in a complete line of the print-out. This format is usually regarded as most suitable for prose and therefore is appropriate to Fisher's work on the Chancery documents. The KWIC format can be useful in verse also, especially where enjambment or the repetition of poetic formulae across the line-system is very common. But since Hoccleve generally prefers end-stopped lines, the line itself forms a natural unit, and Farley therefore used the KWOC format (keyword-out-of-context), whereby the main entry is keyed to a separate print-out of the text. 16 While there are some obvious limitations to the HOCCLEX program, we believe these are comparatively minor, considering our editorial purposes, and we are confident that the evidence we now have will indeed produce the first authoritative computer-assisted text of the accidentals of a Middle English author. Our major innovation (at least in Middle English) is to store the evidence which can be used for the construction of an inflectional system or a paradigm of auctorially-preferred suffixes. 17 This is done very simply, by creating a reverse lexicon as well as the positive one. We did not use a syllabic break-down (perhaps one of our oversights), but we can achieve the same results from being able, say, to list all uses of particular letter-clusters. This can be very significant in confirming readings of e.g., a preferred double "ee" over single "e", where otherwise the statistical evidence would be limited to the particular word in question, which nonetheless remains the basic unit of the evaluation. We did not use syntactic codings, although we had developed approximately seventy-five codes for all the major Middle English patterns. The degree of conservatism in the Regement copying makes it unlikely that preferred syntactic or word-order choices would occur that might run counter to the evidence of copy-text. Of the "surface features", we did record punctuation as a separate element (although it is not introduced into the sample normalisation below, and in practice turns out to be largely restricted to the use of the mid-line virgule for caesura), but not capitalisation, which Farley had already analysed independently. Finally, using the dictionary program THE WORD PLUS on a KayPro II Plus 88 microcomputer, a special sub-lexicon (i.e., NORMLEX) has been written by the general editor, listing all forms which can be created by analogy and morphological extension based on HOCCLEX usage, but which do not actually appear in the HOCCLEX lexicon. Furthermore, by first reading the actual morphology of the HOCCLEX text (but not the incidence) into the "Main Dictionary" on THE WORD PLUS (and, of course, erasing the 45,000-word Modern English dictionary on the program and renaming NORMLEX to this Main Dictionary), it is then possible to run any part of the edited (and normalised) text through the microcomputer dictionary programs separately and therefore to establish immediately whether the final text is compatible with either part of the normalisation and, if not, whether this apparent incompatibility is merely the mark of a retained indifferent or unique form from the copy-text (e.g., levels 13 or 14 in the normalisation model) or is a genuine error of judgement by an editor. I should emphasise here that this technical checking of the normalisation results is not intended to suggest that the entire normalisation process is one merely manufactured by a coven of computers. The main-frame computer simply provides the raw data upon which the editorial decisions are based (decisions obviously supported by statistical information), and the microcomputer makes some of this information more readily accessible to the other editors; the dictionary programs do not create the normalisation—they merely record it and check the final text against it. This is what we found. There is in the Hoccleve holographs a quite remarkable degree of consistency in accidentals, much more so than in Fisher's Chancery English (thereby rendering that concordance, despite its much wider data-base, of less value to us than we had hoped) and perhaps more so than in any other English author before the eighteenth century. Hoccleve was obviously a good bureaucrat. The first trial sections of normalisation suggested that more than two-thirds of the copy-text forms would remain undisturbed, thereby confirming the status of Arundel as a reliable copy-text. As editors, we could now distinguish at this practical level of normalisation three lexical types of relationship between copy-text and the holographs, types in which their representation of the actual conditions of those documents could usually be reassuringly linked to one or other of the theoretical levels delineated in the Normalisation Model.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Normalisation: Lexical Types Type 1. A (Copy-Text) and H (Hocclex) Agreement a) Perfect ca. 66% b) Abnormal (very rare): e.g., H 2 x wol , 137 x wole c) Indifferent e.g., A whylom , H 1 x whylom , 4 x whilom . A made , H 28 x maad , 39 x made Type 2. Normalisation by Extant Paradigm a) Perfect (i.e., 100% H usage): e.g., his (480/0), is (746/0), it (596/0), noght (19/0), noon (108/0), right (125/0), the (1342/0), thee (359/0), they (219/0), with (189/0) b) Composite e.g., bid-dynge (1+1/0), coyn-worth (8/0), meen-est (11/0), vn-seur (10/0) c) Analogous Forms e.g., H o x - þ , H o x sch ; scholde &gt; sholde , rekkyþ &gt; rekketh Type 3. Non-Extant Forms a) Possible Analogies e.g., A another (H othir ), A asyde (H syde ), A feyntyd (H feynte ) b) Inflectional/Suffix Analogies e.g., A noysaunce, perchaunce ; H substance, penance c) Non-Extant with Fisher/Chancery English Analogies? d) Non-Extant e.g., A Chestre ynne The first type, with A (Arundel) and H (Hoccleve holograph/HOCCLEX) agreement, is observable at three levels (the Perfect, the Abnormal, and the Indifferent); the second, with normalisation by extant paradigm, is observable at the levels of Perfect, Composite, and Analogous; and the third, with non-extant forms (in HOCCLEX), is observable at four levels (Possible Analogies, Inflectional/Suffix Analogies, Non-Extant with Fisher/Chancery Analogies, and Non-Extant proper. 1a. Perfect Agreement: This level is illustrated throughout the text and can be seen quite clearly in the trial normalisation of two stanzas printed below. It is, in practical terms, equivalent to all the cases fitting level one on the Normalisation Model, together with various proportions of those on levels two, three, and four. In brief, the great predominance of this type means that most of the features of A will still remain in the edited version. So, for example, in the first stanza of the extract, O, whyle, I, in, wele, I, was, honoured, And, many, on, of, my, glad, And, now, I, am, on, and, loured, There, how, wo, I, be, bystad, O, lord, &amp;, vnsad, world, nat, mannes, persone, ffor, sone, but, for, good, allone —or forty-two words in fifty-four occurrences—are retained untouched (in this case a ratio of over seventy-five percent retention). 1b. Abnormal Agreement: In this type, there is still a clear agreement between A and H, but the form in A, while extant in H, is demonstrably a statistical aberration. (This unusual case is parallel to the "lower" statistical end of level seven on the Normalisation Model.) For example, the copy-text reading wol does exist in HOCCLEX, but only twice, as against 137 examples of wole . In the face of such overwhelming auctorial preference, the wole form is selected. 18 This type, we should emphasise again, is very rare. 1c. Indifferent Agreement: This third sub-group (properly identical only to level fourteen in the Normalisation Model, but possibly occurring elsewhere depending on one's concept of, and statistical base for, "indifference") illustrates similar indifference in both copy-text and HOCCLEX. Where, for example, A reads whylom and HOCCLEX provides virtually equal occurrences of both whylom and whilom , then the copy-text form would be followed. 2a. Perfect Normalisation: Just as in the first main group, the "Perfect" sub-group in Type 2 is again the most common and the most easily documented. It corresponds to levels two to six in the Normalisation Chart. It is the first case in the Lexical Types chart of major normalisation (i.e. an editorial change in the accidentals of the copy-text). For, in all examples encountered in Type 1 (with the exception of the rare and relatively insignificant 1b), the copy-text reading was retained. As can be seen from both the normalised text and the Lexical Types Chart, the great majority of cases of normalisation fall into this sub-group. Quite simply, this type shows, for example, that Hoccleve spells the third person singular present tense of the verb "to be" is 746 times, and never spells it any other way (e.g., as ys ). In the face of such statistics, it would be a shirking of editorial responsibility to ignore this auctorial preference. 2b. Composite Normalisation: This sub-group consists of cases where the complete copy-text word-form is not extant in HOCCLEX, but where we can identify the necessary elements in the word and reconstruct it according to observable auctorial patterns. It therefore corresponds to various levels (from eight to twelve) on the Normalisation Model, depending on the statistical evidence. Thus, while HOCCLEX does not list the word coyn-worth (it may, in fact, be a nonce-word), it does show both coyn and worth , and we can therefore speculate with some confidence that Hoccleve would have very much preferred the "-th" to the "-þ" form. This case illustrates the principle which we can often employ in such examples: that while the apparent statistical base may be very small (theoretically non-existent for this compound word), patterns demonstrable elsewhere can reinforce the evidence considerably. That is, since we know (as mentioned earlier) that Hoccleve uses the thorn ("þ") only in the contracted form þ t and on no other occasion, the evidence supporting the normalisation to coyn-worth is very much more substantial than this single case might suggest. 2c. Analogous Normalisation: This type is a development of the arguments used in the previous sub-group and therefore also corresponds to levels eight to twelve in the Normalisation Model. For example, although rekketh does not exist in HOCCLEX, and although it is not strictly speaking a composite form but an inflected one, the evidence on "þ" employed in reconstructing coynworth can also be used to substantiate the "-th" inflection in rekketh as auctorial. (See below, on the use of the reverse lexicon, for other examples of inflectional analogies.) Similar evidence can be cited to emend the "longsch" form to "longsh" in such words as scholde or any other orthographic cluster patterns which are similarly consistent in the holographs (and are accessible, as mentioned above, through HOCCLEX's ability to pick out any specific morphological series, not just the word-unit itself). 3a. Non-Extant with Possible Analogy: One question that frequently confronts the Hoccleve editors is—just how common are genuinely non-extant forms in HOCCLEX that have no analogy to the documented forms? For example, the word another does not occur in HOCCLEX (as an orthographically compound word), but the word othir does, spelled with the "-ir" form not the "-er". Should we regard the two words as analogous, and therefore normalise the another to anothir , or should we consider them as representing two separate lexical units in the author's mind, and treat them differently (presumably normalising all copy-text other to othir , but retaining copy-text another because of the "empty" entry in the HOCCLEX column)? That is, are we using the level one or the level fourteen rationales in the Normalisation Model? In this particular case, I think one could argue that the etymology, morphology (and semantic connection) of the two words are similar enough to suggest that another should be dealt with as a type 2b or 2c normalised form. In fact, most examples of apparently non-extant words can be fairly clearly defended as belonging to one of the Type 2 lexical models. This ambiguous Type 3a is entered here largely to emphasise both the conservative ideology of the normalisation process (i.e., that the editor should at first consider whether a genuine anomaly has been found, in appropriate "classical" Pergamanian fashion) and the equally necessary—and in the Hoccleve holographs frequently more successful—conjecturalist search for analogies, in, of course, a "classical" Alexandrian manner. 3b. Inflectional/Suffix Analogies: A similar question to that posed in 3a might also be asked here, for although the principle of inflectional analogy was defended and illustrated under type 2b, it might be debatable whether a specific suffix or inflection could possibly change the lexical identity of the word in the author's mind in a manner similar to that suggested for the another/othir pair. For example, is it significant that Hoccleve, when choosing between an "-ance" and "-aunce" ending to abstract nouns, greatly prefers the "-ance" on occasions when it can be considered as a genuine suffix (e.g. in non-monosyllabic words, remembrance, variance, ignorance ), as opposed to the much rarer examples of "-aunce" like daunce or chaunce ? Or more particularly, can such predilections be used in determining the form of abstract nouns which do not occur in HOCCLEX, e.g. perchaunce, noysaunce ? The answer to such paradigmatic questions, and the decision to regard this Type as belonging to level thirteen or one of the NORMLEX levels (eight to twelve) in the Normalisation Model will clearly depend on the statistical and morphological consistency that each suffix presents. 3c. Non-Extant with Fisher Analogies: As mentioned earlier, we had at one point hoped to be able to use the 90,000-word Fisher concordance of bureaucratic Middle English to widen the evidence for morphological extension. Ironically, however, the level of consistency found in Hoccleve seems in general to be even higher than that charted by Fisher, so that while the HOCCLEX concordance is inevitably smaller than the Fisher, it is very much more amenable to the establishment of accidental patterns usable in the normalisation of copy-text. To date, therefore, we have not been able to employ the Fisher concordance with a surety greater than that accorded the HOCCLEX. 3d. Genuine Non-Extant Forms: With all the various qualifications listed above, and with the evidence of the normalised text printed below, it should be clear that genuinely non-extant forms are comparatively rare. That is, it is very unusual for us to come across a word in the copy-text for which there is no paradigm available in HOCCLEX or NORMLEX, either by analogy, composition, or inflection. When such words do occur, they are frequently proper nouns (e.g. Chestre ynne , on the fifth line of the poem), and given the generally-accepted dubiousness of the proper noun in other textual theories (e.g., stemmatics), we are content to allow copy-text the primacy. These cases correspond to level thirteen or even fourteen in the theoretical Normalisation Model, where the "residual authority" of copy-text can be safely invoked without compromising the argument for normalisation. As mentioned above, one of the potentially most useful features introduced into the HOCCLEX program was the reverse lexicon facility. This automatic rewriting of the basic text-data would allow us to gain access to the concordance not only through conventional alphabetisation, but also through word- endings , thereby making it possible to analyse the holograph morphology for inflections, suffixes, etc. Rather than simply re-store (and re-print) every occurrence of each word both backwards and forwards, the HOCCLEX program uses a code number system (as shown in the listings printed below) which can key the entry in the reverse lexicon back to the similarly numbered main entry in the concordance proper. A typical section of the reverse lexicon appears below. 3435) SI 3230) SIH 2273) SILLE 1826) SINIDIPUC 1922) SITIECED 6099) SIY 1934) SIDEED 5316) SIHT 4034) SIM 1806) SIORC 5400) SITNEMROT 4149) SIDEEN 1541) SIKRELC 867) SIMA 5658) SIOV 3451) SIWI 1399) SIEKRAC 5788) SIKREW 4169) SIN 5413) SIRUOT 6143) SIWY This section of the lexicon, therefore, lists every form in the holographs ending in "-is" (including, obviously, the word is itself—entry code 3435). Admittedly, a reverse alphabet does not make for easy reading, and one has to "reform" each word mentally in order to give it its conventional value (although we could have the computer simply print the reverse examples in the orthodox forwards manner). Now, using the key-code, we can trace each form back to the main entry in the concordance and thus to the text itself. 3435) IS (There are 746 listings in the concordance for this entry.

Take, for example, the group of entries in the reverse lexicon for words ending in "-ys". The following listings appear: 4430) SYDARAP 4501) SYEP 4688) SYRP 5652) SYWNV 4422) SYELAP 1837) SYETRUC 4619) SYTNERP 4971) SYWTHGIR 3417) SYEN40I 2337) SYMENE 1010) SYUA 2804) SYENRUOF 1508) SYOHC 6033) SYW Note, first of all, that there is no equivalent listing in the "-ys" group for the is, his , and amis recorded in the "-is" group, thereby establishing that there is 100% consistency in the form of these common words. This information could, however, have been gathered easily enough from a conventional alphabetised concordance, and the usefulness of the reverse lexicon is to measure the frequency and nature of the "-ys" group as a whole against the entries found in the "-is" group. Following the same procedure as before, we can trace the occurrences of all the "-ys" words to the text itself, via the main entry in the main concordance. 4430) PARADYS 1592, 5412 TOTAL 2 4422) PALEYS 1572, 3112, 4814 TOTAL 3 3417) I04NEYS 6491 TOTAL 1 2804) FOURNEYS 5459 TOTAL 1 4501) PEYS 1484 TOTAL 1 1837) CURTEYS 4528, 5770 TOTAL 2 2337) ENEMYS 5506 TOTAL 1 1508) CHOYS 5997 TOTAL 1 4688) PRYS (7 listings) 4619) PRENTYS 1036 TOTAL 1 1010) AUYS 3551, 3674, 3691, 3702 TOTAL 4 6033) WYS (9 listings) 5652) VNWYS 77, 2481, 5508 TOTAL 3 4971) RIGHTWYS 5587 TOTAL 1 These entries appear in the text as: 1592) PARADYS YATES OPNED BEEN BY THEE 5411) O GOOD LORD GOD / O LORD OF PARADYS 1572) PALEYS OF CRY2T / FLOUR OF VIRGYNITEE 3112) IN OUR PALEYS / WHER MANY A MILION 4814) HOOM VN TO HIS PALEYS THIS EMPEROUR 6491) FFORTH HIS I04NEYS THIS IONATHAS HEELD 5459) X.

At first glance, it might seem that the incidence of "-is" and "-ys" forms is virtually indifferent, for there are twenty-one entries in the reverse lexicon for "-is" and fourteen for "-ys". But there are several qualifications to be made to this apparent indifference, some of them directly helpful in the establishing of auctorial norms. Thus, it can be seen that in fact none of the fourteen entries in the "-ys" group (as observable in the thirty-seven actual occurrences in the text) are genuine inflections in "-ys". Some ( paradys, paleys, fourneys, peys, choys, prys, prentys, auys, wys, vnwys , and rightwys ) are simply part of the basic root of the word or its composite form, and while they might be useful in charting auctorial spelling preferences for these individual words—or the morphological types they represent—they are irrelevant to a determination of a preference between the "-is" and "-ys" as suffixes or inflections. Others ( io4neys, enemys ), while showing inflected forms (plurals), are based on a root which already ends in "y" and can therefore be similarly disregarded as evidence for a "-ys" / "-is" inflectional choice. When we compare this poor showing of the "-ys" group with the evidence of the "-is" group, we can first admit that, again, there are several "-is" forms which are part of the root of the word itself ( is, his, this, ellis, amis, carkeis, crois, vois , and yis ). There are also three contracted or composite forms ( nis, iwis, ywis ) which similarly have no inflectional significance. The Latin entry ( cupidinis ) is obviously of no value to the English accidence (and has in fact been deleted from the concordance), and the prefix mis , while clearly confirming an auctorial preference for the "is" spelling over the "ys", should not be cited in the inflectional evidence. However, that still leaves deedis, needis, clerkis, werkis, touris, deceitis , and tormentis , all of which are genuine plural forms in "-is" and suggest (unlike any form in the "-ys" group), a distinct auctorial pattern for this inflection. This brief analysis of one very small variant as charted in the reverse lexicon is obviously both incomplete and constructed on such a small data-base as to make absolute surety difficult to demonstrate. It is offered here largely because the data-base is so small and can therefore be presented SAMPLE NORMALISATION OF TEXT Copy-Text Transcript Normalised with Annotations Clear Text Edited Version (101) (101) (101) (9/0) O whyle I stode in welesemiinv.

It is intended merely to show the method for establishing paradigms via the reverse lexicon, and to chart a typical example of consistency of usage, resulting in a 100% figure, even though in this case that 100% represents only seven different words in one column, with a zero showing in the other possible choice. If this example were used as a means of determining a system of accidence for all plural nouns in Hoccleve, it would obviously be a misguided editorial procedure (for example, we would first have to add to the data-base all other possible plural forms which might compete with the recorded "-is" preference. However, it can tell us that, in this limited case, Hoccleve never uses the "-ys" form as a genuine plural inflection and, therefore, that a "-ys" plural in copy-text should be viewed with extreme suspicion, and very likely emended by reference to this "-is" group (and certainly if the copy-text produced a "-ys" for any of the seven words in the control group itself). The first point to be emphasised is that this brief selection from the text of the Hoccleve Regement , in its copy-text, annotated, and clear-text forms, is intended to provide as wide a range as possible of the "levels" of normalisation and the various editorial procedures used to deal with these levels. The text has, therefore, been consciously "over-normalised", in the sense that any possibility for normalisation has at least been charted in the annotations. The text as a whole has, in general, a much lower level of editorial participation, although even this particularly problematical section does display the typically reassuring accumulation of evidence (from HOCCLEX, the reverse lexicon, and NORMLEX) upon which decisions to normalise can usually be made with confidence. The first column is a diplomatic transcript of stanzas 101 and 102 of the Arundel manuscript. Word-division and punctuation in the manuscript are retained, and there is none of the conventional normalisation often occurring in otherwise conservative editions (e.g., initial "ff" is not normalised to capital "F", although it clearly has this function throughout the manuscript). The purpose of providing the copy-text transcript is merely to show the typical raw material with which the Hoccleve editors are faced, and, of course, to demonstrate that, despite the apparent complexity of the annotations in the normalised version, the rate of editorial normalisation per word of Arundel text is really quite modest. The annotated version can be read as follows: 1. All changes in the accidentals of the copy-text are recorded by italics: thus from copy-text line 1 "longstode" to normalised "longsto o d"; from line 3 "mylongslokyd" to normalised "m i longslo o k i d"; from line 4 "non" to normalised "no o n"; from line 5 "thys" to normalised "th i s" etc. An exception to this general rule is where, for example, an additional element in copy-text (usually final "-e") is not present in the normalised version, e.g., copy-text line 5 "worlde" to normalised "world". 2. The statistical evidence for the normalisation is cited (in parentheses) above the normalised form, with the HOCCLEX figure supporting the normalised form being given before the slash and any HOCCLEX evidence for a form similar to the copy-text form being given after the slash. This latter will obviously almost always register as a zero. In compound or inflected words (or in words which also occur in HOCCLEX in a compound or inflected state, in addition to the root form listed in copy-text) a second statistic is frequently cited, after a "+" sign. Thus, in a case like line 12 (copy-text "wyth", normalised to "w i th"), there are 189 occurrences of this root word in HOCCLEX, and in every case Hoccleve spells the word "w i th", and never "wyth". In addition, there are forty-five other occurrences, in words built upon the root "with" (e.g., "within", "without" etc.), where again Hoccleve uniformly employs the "i" form instead of the "y". This sort of cumulative or parallel evidence is obviously of comparatively small significance when the original data for the word are so conclusive, but may be of great value in cases where the root word is relatively rare, and when the existence of related forms may widen the base for normalisation considerably. Note that analogous morphological preferences derived from different roots are not cited in the statistical evidence above the normalised form, although there are occasions when such evidence might be extremely useful. Thus, the normalised form "ago o n" in line 10 is supported by a 100% usage pattern in HOCCLEX, but one which apparently relies upon only four occurrences of the form itself. In fact, the auctorial preference for an orthographic doubling of the character to signal a long vowel can be observed in several other places even in this brief selection (line 1, "longsto o d", line 3 "lo o kid", line 4 "no o n", and line 8 "longso o the"). The cumulative evidence may therefore often be very much more substantial than the statistics could suggest. Sometimes, of course, the "extended" statistic after the "+" will be less decisive than the smaller-based statistic for the word proper. (E.g., in line 3 the combined normalisations in "lo o k i d" as compared to copy-text "lokyd" are supported by a 100% occurrence in HOCCLEX of the form "lookid": i.e., Hoccleve always spells the past participle of "look" in this way, even though this particular inflection appears only twice. On those occasions where other parts of the conjugation of the verb appear, he uses "oo" thirty-three times and "o" three times.) In a case such as this, we base the normalisation on the principle of the specific form acting as the unit for comparative data, an argument which, as emphasised earlier, underlies the entire normalisation enterprise. 3. Where the copy-text word does not exist at all in HOCCLEX, then it is enclosed in square brackets, e.g., line 3 [ loured ]. As suggested above, copy-text form is therefore accepted. Of course, through the reverse lexicon and NORMLEX, it might frequently be possible to create a plausible auctorial form for the word, but in general a conservative method has been endorsed for these comparatively rare cases. Note that square brackets may also be used for sections of a word for which there is no exact (or secure) parallel in HOCCLEX. In these cases, an explanatory footnote provides details on the problem. For example, we can be fairly certain that, in line 6, Hoccleve would not have used the double "nn" form of copy-text honn u ryþ (see the series of single "n" forms listed in the footnote). But since the third person singular of the present tense does not occur in HOCCLEX, and since he varies his practice between a "u" and a "ou" in the second syllable of the word, we cannot be absolutely sure what the preferred form would be for this element, and thus we place it in brackets. Now, it could be argued that the evidence of the footnote suggests that Hoccleve uses the "ou" form only in nouns (the 20 x honour ), and that "u" is clearly the preferred form for verbs. It could, of course, ironically, be argued that the supralinear "u" in copy-text indicates an omitted character (most likely "o"?), so that we would, by combining these arguments, displace a copy-text "honn o uryþ" by a normalised honuryth (without brackets). However, in the circumstances it seemed more prudent to normalise what we were sure about, and to point to the ambivalence by using the brackets. Note that in line 1 the copy-text form, which in this case is spelled out in full ( honoured ) not contracted, does provide a model which (as far as its single "n" and its "ou" are concerned) does have analogies in HOCCLEX, but not in this form for this inflection. Again, a conservative approach seemed best and copy-text is retained, with the appropriate annotation. Eventually, of course, the accumulation of similar annotation and the incorporation of its results into NORMLEX might provide enough information to substantiate a paradigmatic normalised form in the edited text. 4. Footnotes are used to provide any additional information which cannot easily be accommodated by the square brackets or statistics alone (as in the case of honuryth ). Thus, for example, footnote 2 emphasises that the form rekken does occur four times in HOCCLEX (and is therefore not an unattested word to be placed in brackets), and that Hoccleve never uses the thorn ("þ") as an inflected form. In practice, of course, such notes, being inevitably very repetitive, are kept to a minimum and their general principles enumerated in the textual introduction. As is rather obvious, we are very doubtful that the published form of the normalised text of Hoccleve's Regement will have the luxury of being able to present all of this annotated material on the textual page, and we suspect that the famous "barbed wire" of editorial intervention would in this case severely interfere with the reader's access to Hoccleve's text. It is presented in this state here largely to demonstrate the type, range, and level of surety the normalisation process encounters. The explanatory material could no doubt work equally well in a conventional apparatus (distinguished, of course, from substantive emendation, which certainly occurs much less frequently), with appropriate lemma-keying to the stanzaic page. The laws of textual disclosure might indeed suggest that the traces of our editorial handiwork with regard to accidentals should be made available to the critical reader in the apparatus, so that the complete textual features—surface and otherwise—of the copy-text could be recreated out of this apparatus. As mentioned earlier, such a desideratum would involve a lemma-entry in the apparatus for roughly one-third of the individual words in the copy-text. Given that only one witness—Arundel itself—would need to be cited (compared to the more than forty witnesses whose readings would have to be listed in a complete historical collation of the rarer substantive variants), this level of editorial openhandedness would not necessarily result in an apparatus more unwieldy than those already produced for other mediaeval works, particularly those with multiple authority. However, it is debatable whether all of this material would be required by the typical reader (historian, political scientist, literary critic) of the stanzaic page, and it is likely that the apparatus reconstructing the accidentals of Arundel will occur in a separate microform addendum to the edition, along with the complete historical collation. It might be argued that, since Arundel is only a vehicle (albeit a relatively consistent and reliable one) for the reconstruction of auctorial accidentals, then neither editor nor reader should be greatly concerned with its surface features per se , and that even a microform accidentals apparatus is thus an editorial luxury. However, we do not want the normalisation to be entirely silent, and therefore the microform addendum can at least function as a record of what we have done, demonstrating we trust the validity and coherence of our editorial decisions. 20 The confidence with which normalisation may proceed obviously depends upon our following a procedure which is careful, consistent, and conservative. When the normalised form is created, it must be based on a rigorous application of formal principles of documentary evidence, and all dubious cases must be emended only as far as that documentary evidence and its analogies will allow. In our case, these principles translate into the following practices: 1. Normalisation always moves outward from the copy-text form. That means that if the copy-text form is well-attested in HOCCLEX, then in almost all cases it should be used. Copy-text is first checked against HOCCLEX, the editor being careful to consider the various related forms under which the base word might occur (e.g., variants in initial "longs"—or "2" in the print-out —and "s"). 2. If copy-text form does not occur in HOCCLEX, then the editor considers the other related evidence in HOCCLEX (but not yet NORMLEX). If there is 100% preference recorded for the word in question, then this recorded usage will normally be substituted for copy-text. Where there is a range of usage patterns, NORMLEX may be consulted to discover whether there is a general principle underlying the variants. However, if the HOCCLEX variants are clearly indifferent, then the reading in HOCCLEX duplicating the copy-text form should be used. If none of the forms in HOCCLEX replicates copy-text, and no analogies or general principles are derivable from NORMLEX, then copy-text is followed, perhaps with an explanatory note. 3. Statistics are compiled not only for the specific form in question, but for all related forms derived from the same root. These statistics are presented in the apparatus. 4. Finally, all forms in the normalised text are run through the dictionary program for HOCCLEX and for NORMLEX, so that any aberrancies may be checked in context. These aberrancies may, of course, be copy-text forms which do not fit any of the patterns of normalisation so far established, in which case they will not be "recognised" by the HOCCLEX and NORMLEX dictionaries. A check against copy-text context will confirm the status of these non-normalised forms. The specific conditions of the Hoccleve oeuvre, with a substantial body of holographs of minor works, together with the text of a major work available only in many scribal copies, are no doubt so unusual that it would be difficult to find immediately useful theories or practices derived from the Hoccleve editing that could be incorporated into the editorial principles of scholars working either in mediaeval or other periods. With the exception of the Ormulum and possibly the The Equatorie of the Planetis mentioned earlier (see footnote 9)—neither of which is really parallel to the Hoccleve problem—there are virtually no examples in Middle English literature of a document purporting to represent auctorial preferences in accidentals. Where holographs do exist in other periods, they are, of course, most often versions of the very work being edited, and may either be rejected as copy-text in favour of a printed edition or used for accidentals according to the principles enunciated by Greg and his followers. And when putative holographs of works other than that being edited do occur, their possible value as paradigms for accidentals or other auctorial preferences (e.g., of style, imagery etc.) has more often been the source of editorial contention than consensus. One thinks inevitably of the various attempts to determine the content and style of the entire Shakespeare canon from the characteristics of the famous "Hand D" in the fragment of Sir Thomas More . The issue may simply be that the desired consistency in accidentals is not demonstrably clear enough in the limited data available, and that therefore the admittedly scribal/compositorial features of a non-auctorial copy (printed or otherwise) are less problematical than an attempt to resuscitate auctorial preferences from such holographs, especially where a copy-text reasonably close to the author's time and language may be selected. But the Hoccleve holographs do not have such limitations. They contain a comparatively large body of material (in fact, nearly 7,000 lines of verse, a slightly larger lexicon-base than the poem of 5,000 lines for which they provide the comparative data). They display a quite remarkable degree of consistency—more so than any previous scholars of fifteenth-century English had anticipated; and while their lexicon is obviously not completely identical to that created by the necessities of the different subject-matter of the Regement , the lexical overlap is so practically useful that there are very few occasions where the editor is left without some paradigm or other. And finally, unlike the Chaucer Equatorie , the Hoccleve holographs are in the same medium (verse) as the rest of the oeuvre, and usually employ the same metrical and strophic patterns. For all of these reasons, the Hoccleve holographs may not be denied their status as valuable evidence in the editorial process: to do so would be to accept an acknowledged non-auctorial condition of the text in favour of one which can, with careful scholarship, be shown to rely upon the demonstrable preferences of an author who clearly cared very much about the exact form of his language. 21 We do not deny the apparent novelty of our methods, but claim that in fact they fall well within the accepted definitions of editorial theory and practice: as suggested several times in this essay, we have simply combined the "classical" Lachmannian orthodoxy in selection of a "base-text" for substantives with a logical extension of the "modern" Gregian orthodoxy in the selection of a "copy-text" for accidentals. The paradox of Thomas Hoccleve is that these two documents, base-text and copy-text, happen to be of different works, but that their combination will result in a final text which is closer to auctorial intentions than the use of either document independently would have brought us.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * A version of the computer sections of this article was presented at a conference on "Computer Technology and the Contemporary Scholar—Applications for Research", held at the Graduate Center of The City University of New York in October, 1983. A version of the editorial theory sections was presented at the 1983 meeting of the Medieval Institute of Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo. Much of the information in the article is based on material supplied by Peter P. Farley of Adelphi University, who has been responsible for the computer part of the Hoccleve edition. The article is also dependent on a good deal of very practical advice on both the theory and practice of normalisation offered by scholars in medieval and other fields. These scholars include Fredson Bowers, John Burrow, E. Talbot Donaldson, A. S. G. Edwards, John H. Fisher, W. Speed Hill, David J. Nordloh, M. C. Seymour, and G. Thomas Tanselle. In a series of colloquia, the Hoccleve editors (Charles R. Blyth, Peter P. Farley, Marcia Smith Marzec, Jerome Mitchell, Gale Sigal, and David Yerkes) have made valuable contributions to both the evidence and the theoretical arguments of the article. 1 G. Thomas Tanselle, "Classical, Biblical, and Medieval Textual Criticism and Modern Editing," Studies in Bibliography , 36 (1983), 21-68. See esp. p. 24, "What has traditionally been called 'textual criticism'—or, more recently, 'textual analysis'—is this attempt to fix the relationship of the surviving documentary witnesses; and though many of the theories of textual criticism have entailed certain assumptions about how the editor's critical text should be constructed, the focus of attention has normally been not on the 'editorial' phase (the actual selection or emendation of readings) but on the prior analysis of the texts that results in the assignment of relationships among them." See also Tanselle's criticism of Dearing's theories of 'textual analysis,' pp. 31-35. 2 Paul Maas, Textual Criticism , trans. Barbara Flower (1958). See esp. p. 5 for Maas' "ideal" stemma, demonstrating graphically that the evidence of "separative" or "conjunctive" errors would not enable the editor to move further up the genealogy (towards the author's putative fair copy "x") than the stage represented by "α", the archetype created by the comparative data embedded in the hyparchetypes, themselves dependent on the identification of error of one type or another in the extant witnesses. 3 Piers Plowman: The B Version . . . . An Edition in the Form of Trinity College MS B. 15. 17 . . . ed. George Kane and E. Talbot Donaldson (1975). See esp. Section III (pp. 70-97) for a discussion of archetypal corruption in the B text, a corruption which is, of course, quite predictable according to the orthodox interpretation of Maas' genealogical system. 4 As has been widely observed (by Kane, Donaldson and their reviewers), the full apparatus of historical collation in the Athlone editions of both the A and B texts is intended in part to allow precisely this re-editing of the text by the critical reader. That is, the degree of license assumed by the editors requires that all of the evidence for reconstruction of the text be made available so that the editorial rationale can be continually tested against the documentary witnesses. 5 The only possible "authority" in the Regement manuscripts is in the so-called "patronic" versions, the copying of which is very likely to have been overseen by Hoccleve himself. In a forthcoming article on the genealogy of the Regement manuscripts, Marcia Smith Marzec argues that, both on stemmatic evidence and from such extra-textual considerations as the survival of dedicatory verses and the documented patronage of Hoccleve's other works by members of the royal circle, there were probably as many as eight such authoritative copies of the Regement , of which two survive (British Library MS. Arundel 38 and British Library MS. Harley 4866). The second of these two was selected by F. J. Furnivall as copy-text for his 1897 edition of the Regement for the Early English Text Society (Extra Series 72), on no better grounds than its containing "the best portrait of Chaucer" (p. xvii). Furnivall even admits that Harley 4866 displays certain Northern orthographic features which could not represent Hoccleve's London usage, thereby severely qualifying Harley's potential status as "best-text" on the basis of dialect or accidentals—the usual major rationale cited by mediaeval editors (along with the evidence for genealogical authority) in support of a single witness embodying the greatest degree of auctorial intention. The present edition's selection of Arundel 38 as copy-text is supported in part by its genealogical position (it is arguably only one, or at most, two removes from the putative fair copy, and might even be the exemplar, or at least collateral to the exemplar, of Harley 4866), and in part by its orthographic and dialectal features. As is noted in more detail below, the degree of editorial intervention required in the restoration of auctorial "accidence" (see footnote 12) is comparatively slight in the case of Arundel (and certainly much less so than with Harley), and while it might be theoretically possible to restore the substantives of hyparchetypes in other branches of the stemma, these inferred witnesses would not only be genealogically "inferior" to Arundel (i.e., at two or three removes from the fair copy), but would also lack any consistent evidence for the reconstruction of auctorial accidentals, since they would be at best conflated states of the text representing the variants in as many as nineteen or twenty different manuscripts. On both Lachmannian and Gregian terms, therefore, Arundel 38 would stand in a greater position of authority as copy-text than any other extant witness, even if we were not attempting the reconstruction of auctorial accidentals which is the subject of this article. Once normalisation is to be undertaken, the usefulness of Arundel as a vehicle for this procedure becomes unassailable. See, in addition to the Marzec article mentioned above, M. C. Seymour, "The Manuscripts of Hoccleve's Regiment of Princes ," Transactions of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society , iv, part 7 (1974), 255-297 for a description of Arundel, Harley, and the other manuscripts, together with a preliminary account of their filiation. See also A. S. G. Edwards, "Hoccleve's Regiment of Princes : A Further Manuscript," Transactions of the Edinburgh Bibliographical Society , v, part 1 (1978), 32, and R. F. Green, "Notes on Some Manuscripts of Hoccleve's Regiment of Princes ," The British Library Journal , 4, number 1 (Spring 1978), 37-41. Seymour gives a brief account (differing in some minor points from the evidence cited here) in the Commentary (esp. pp. 113-114) to his Selections from Hoccleve (1981). 6 The fullest account of the status and possible influence of Chancery English occurs in John H. Fisher's article, "Chancery and the Emergence of Standard Written English in the Fifteenth Century," Speculum , 52 (1977), 870-99. The degree to which Hoccleve's idiolect corresponds to the most characteristic features of Chancery English as identified by Fisher is now being investigated by the Hoccleve editors. An interim analysis suggests that, while Hoccleve, as a Londoner, inevitably shares several of the paradigmatic forms which Fisher recognises as belonging to the "proto-Chancery" that would have been in use in the early decades of the fifteenth century, the degree and type of consistency in the concordance generated from the Chancery documents is often of a different nature from that discovered in our analysis of Hoccleve's practice. A fuller report will be published shortly. 7 For surveys of recent work on the autobiographical element in Hoccleve's verse, see Jerome Mitchell's chapter (pp. 49-63) on Hoccleve in Fifteenth-Century Studies , ed. R. F. Yeager (1984), and D. C. Greetham, "Hoccleve's Development of the Chaucerian Persona," in Chaucer at Albany II: Essays in Honor of R. H. Robbins (forthcoming). 8 Huntington Library MS. HM 111, Huntington Library MS. HM 744, Durham MS. Cosin V. III. 9, and the "non-literary" (Privy Seal) British Library MS. Add. 24062, which (unfortunately) is almost all in Latin or French. See H. C. Schulz, "Thomas Hoccleve, Scribe," Speculum , 12 (1937), pp. 71-81. 9 As Jerome Mitchell ( Thomas Hoccleve: A Study in Early Fifteenth-Century English Poetic [1968], p. 14n.) remarks, "Hoccleve is the only significant Middle English writer whose works have in large part been preserved in autograph manuscripts." The only other substantial piece of Middle English verse available in an orthography which seems to represent auctorial practice is the notoriously idiosyncratic Ormulum ; in Hoccleve's general period, only the possibly holograph text of Chaucer's Equatorie of the Planetis offers a potential parallel to the Hoccleve documents, and the Equatorie is uncharacteristic of Chaucer's oeuvre, being a scientific work in prose. In other mediaeval literatures the situation is a little better, for there are holographs of, e.g., Petrarch and Boccaccio, and William Wallace is to edit the autograph version of Thomas Aquinas' scriptum on the third book of the Sentences of Peter Lombard for the Leonine series. In general, however, it must be accepted that the survival of the Hoccleve holographs is an aberration in textual transmission, and does not in itself suggest that there are great documentary riches yet to be discovered. No doubt if Hoccleve had not been a Privy Seal scribe, his orthography would be as lost to us as that of any of his fellow-poets. 10 Jerome J. McGann, in his recent A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism (1983), attempts at several points (see esp. pp. 15-36) to draw the Greg-Bowers and Lachmannian dispensations together, particularly with regard to auctorial intention. However, his case depends very largely on proving that post-Greg textual critics have (deliberately?) misread or enlarged upon Greg and does not, I believe, modify the general assumptions about base-text/copy-text which motivate this present article: namely, that the Lachmannian genealogical system has been traditionally seen as a device for identifying the position of a witness in a hierarchy developed from a study of the substantive errors in texts (with comparatively little concern for the accidentals as they might be represented genealogically), whereas the Greg doctrine on copy-text has separated the authority of substantives and accidentals, while regarding both features as a necessary element in the reconstruction of auctorial intention, be it final (for substantives) or original (for accidentals). This is obviously something of a simplification of the distinction between Greg and Lachmann, but that some such distinction is eminent and valid is surely indisputable—at least from a charting of editorial theory in both the "ancient" and "modern" fields. 11 That is, where a normalisation theory occurs in mediaeval studies, it is associated primarily with the resuscitation of, for example, dialect, not idiolect. Such a normalisation theory might surface in the smoothing of Old English to tenth-century Wessex forms or in the selection of a South-East Midlands manuscript as copy-text on its dialectal features, but since there is virtually no opportunity for the reconstruction of an auctorial idiolect, there is little development of the sort of distinctions (i.e., between substantives and accidentals) which have led to the evolution and dissemination of Greg's theory elsewhere. 12 I use the term "accidence" in a special sense here and elsewhere in this article— i.e. to refer not to the classification of grammatical forms embodied in an author's "style", but to the entire system of surface features of which grammatical alternatives are but one of the choices presented to an author within the parameters of a particular language at a particular time. Thus, a choice between long and short "s" might be regarded as a purely orthographic component in the system of accidence (although there is some argument as to its possible phonological significance), whereas a choice between, say, "-e" and "-eth" as 3ps present tense inflection, or a predilection for a past participle with the "y-" prefix might have grammatical import (though not "meaning") as well as orthographic. Both types can still, however, be regarded as genuine "surface features" and both are therefore a part of the "accidentals" from which an identifiable system of "accidence" can be derived. 13 Tanselle, op. cit. passim , e.g., p. 42, "The editor is finally responsible for establishing both substantives and accidentals, and to assume that scribal accidentals are too far removed from the author's practice to be worth preserving is to ignore the connections between accidentals and meaning. One may not in the end accept these accidentals, but the question of what accidentals to include in a critical text must be faced. Authorial accidentals in ancient texts may be more conjectural than in modern texts, but the attempt to approximate them is not necessarily to be rejected in favor of standardized spelling and modernized punctuation." Tanselle's basic argument is stated in his last two sentences (p. 68), "Editing ancient texts and editing modern ones are not simply related fields; they are essentially the same field. The differences between them are in details; the similarities are in fundamentals." It is, of course, this belief which has motivated the Hoccleve edition to make use of both ancient and modern textual practices in the editing of the Regement . 14 See Tanselle op. cit. , p. 48 and fn. 33 for an account of the argument between Greg and Maas over copy-text. See A. E. Housman, Selected Prose , ed. John Carter (1961), p. 35-36 on the concept of "best" MSS, p. 59 on "the authority of a MS. against the exercise of the judgment," and p. 141 on "sincere" MSS. 15 Bowers' views on the Hoccleve problem are, of course, similar to those expressed in his published writings. See, for example, the "doctrine" that a "definitive edition . . . in its texture of accidentals, as well as in its words, [should] conform to the closest approximation to the author's own linguistic and orthographic characteristics that can be recovered." ( Textual and Literary Criticism [1959], p. 141). a The well-attested forms in HOCCLEX parallel exactly the same forms in the copy-text. In practice, this level accounts for, perhaps, 50% of all cases in the normalisation procedures, thereby confirming Arundel's status as copy-text on Gregian criteria as well as its function as base text on "classical" principles. b While copy-text might occasionally use a variant form, it clearly prefers the same form that is consistently used in HOCCLEX. c Copy-text does show the form used in HOCCLEX, but as an "indifferent" variant, in comparison to the consistent usage in HOCCLEX. d While copy-text clearly prefers a form other than that in HOCCLEX, the holograph usage is still absolutely invariable. e Even where the form does not exist in copy-text, the holograph preference is unambiguous. Usually, of course, the HOCCLEX form would therefore not occur in the edited text at all, except perhaps in circumstances where the scribal inflection seemed an error (e.g., in number, agreement etc.), when the form derived from HOCCLEX would take precedence. f Note that the required "level" of evidentiary support in HOCCLEX is higher than in the corresponding entry for copy-text (line 2 of model). This reflects the editorial desire to represent auctorial (as opposed to scribal) choice with greater surety, and, in general, not to admit HOCCLEX (or NORMLEX) forms as paradigms unless there is either a clear "blank entry" in the copy-text data or a statistically and morphologically well-attested norm in the great majority of auctorial or auctorially-derived forms. g Given the general assumptions (regarding auctorial and scribal usage) under which the normalisation model is constructed, this level should be very rare (and in fact turns out to be so), but could contain occasional anomalies. If one were using orthodox base-text theory (or copy-text theory in its usual restriction to the features of a single text), then the 100% usage form in copy-text would clearly support an unambiguous preference, albeit scribal, or at least not demonstrably auctorial. If the copy-text form is therefore highly atypical as measured against the HOCCLEX extant patterns (say, less than a 25% concurrence with HOCCLEX), then great care would obviously be needed in establishing preferred auctorial usage. Thus, although this level, particularly towards the lower statistical end just cited, occurs infrequently in the normalisation (perhaps once every 500 lines), it is by far the most problematical. Note, furthermore, that we had originally employed the same series of discriminations for HOCCLEX (high, indifferent, low) in this category as in levels 2-4 and 9-11 for copy-text. However. given our general principle that a demonstrable consistency of usage in HOCCLEX is necessary for normalisation of copy-text to proceed, anything under a 90% usage (particularly as measured in this category against a 100% usage in copy-text) seemed possibly suspect and might therefore lead to a selection of copy-text over HOCCLEX, as the model indicates. Therefore, a single category representing this level of indeterminacy, rare though it be, is a more honest response to the statistical conditions than a three-tier break-down would be. h While the required form does not exist in the holographs, it would be easy to create it by morphological extension. This required form corresponds exactly with the form in copy-text, and would merely confirm a conservative reading of copy-text by reference to NORMLEX. i Copy-text preference would again confirm the form created by morphological extension in NORMLEX. Since this form is at least derivable from auctorial usage in HOCCLEX and supported by the majority readings in copy-text, its consistency would be employed throughout the normalisation of the copy-text variants. j An indifferent variant in copy-text, but with the NORMLEX form established as a consistent and unambiguous derivative from HOCCLEX. k A logical extension of the previous two levels, where despite the statistical evidence of the copy-text, a minority form in the copy-text would be preferred since it would be derivable unambiguously from NORMLEX (and therefore from HOCCLEX). Note that the "presumptive authority" of copy-text would be employed, not in cases like levels 9-11 (where the authority of the consistent external evidence— i.e., NORMLEX—is paramount), but in cases where the "indifference" of the copy-text scribe would be matched by a similar (in incidence, if not always in exact type) indifference in HOCCLEX. l The normalised form is not extant in the copy-text (the scribe presumably preferring other variants of the same basic word) or in HOCCLEX (presumably because of the lack of concurrence of the two lexicons). The form could, however, be fully supported by NORMLEX in evidence drawn from related forms in HOCCLEX. This is therefore a level which logically proceeds quite straightforwardly from the previous three, where the normalised form was gradually having its statistical base in copy-text reduced. Note that, while the statistical base might appear to have vanished, in fact this could conceal a very high level of authority for morphological extension. As suggested above, this level could describe cases where a particular word happens not to occur in the holographs (and therefore does not turn up in the HOCCLEX column), but does occur in the copy-text, in, however, a form recognisably different from the clear auctorial preference that could be established in NORMLEX if the word had been used in the holographs. Say, for example, Hoccleve had happened not to use the word (ModE) though in the holographs, but it did show in the copy-text. We can establish from HOCCLEX that a) he never used a 'yogh' and that b) he never used a 'þ' except in the contracted form þ t =þ at , (ModE that ), and that therefore a copy-text form of þ ou yogh would be an impossibility in HOCCLEX. The normalised form, based on 100% usage patterns in HOCCLEX, would be perhaps though or thogh . Thus the form (if it represented a choice between an initial 'þ' and 'th', or a final 'yogh' and 'gh') could merit the 100% level in NORMLEX, while not occurring in HOCCLEX or copy-text in the form created by NORMLEX and used in the edited text. m This would cover very few cases, and would be most prominent in nonce-words, often proper nouns, which for obvious reasons would often not be replicated in HOCCLEX. The 100% in the copy-text column, therefore, would often represent in actual incidence a very small number, usually a single occurrence—for the scribe of Arundel, while closer to Hoccleve's usage than the other copyists, does not share his author's passion for orthodoxy in orthography to the same degree. n Again, a very rare level, where NORMLEX would not be capable of creating a consistent reliable form by morphological extension, but, on the contrary, several forms which would mirror the apparent indifference in HOCCLEX. In such cases, we would invoke the principle of copy-text as residual authority, as long as the forms showing in copy-text reflected putative auctorial choices. If the type , but not ratio (or incidence) of indifferent forms in copy-text were dissimilar to those in HOCCLEX and NORMLEX, then presumably the use of these latter forms would have to be considered. However, since this does not seem to appear in the editing of the Regement , the case is included here only as a logical completion of the statistical types cited, and an additional testament to the conservative principles upon which the normalisation proceeds. 16 See Robert L. Oakman, Computer Methods of Literary Research (rev. 1984), pp. 70-75 for an account of the KWIC and KWOC formats. 17 It should be emphasised that this reverse lexicon, even though it is used for charting suffix forms, is different in format and purpose from the sort of suffix-removal or lemmatisation programs described, for example, in Susan Hockey's A Guide to Computer Applications in the Humanities (1980), pp. 101-106. See also Oakman, pp. 80-81, 92-96 for references to other types of automatic lemmatisation and normalisation, including BIBCON, which can alphabetise variant spellings in Middle English under the appropriate modern form. See Oakman pp. 76-77 for a brief account of genuine reverse lexicons (or unfortunate lack of them) in other fields. 18 The final "-e" in wole could, of course, have metrical, as opposed to purely orthographic value. Judith Jefferson of the University of Bristol is making a metrical analysis of the Hoccleve holographs (dealing with such questions as the use of pronounced final "-e" and of variant spellings for metrical purposes). The results of this study will obviously be of great help in establishing the degree to which copy-text use of final "-e" represents a likely auctorial preference and could therefore have significant impact upon the metrical features of the Hoccleve edition. 19 The 7 in the text here is one of the numerical codes used to represent various scribal features not available on the conventional keyboard. The codes occurring here include 1 =semiinv. 2 = long "s" ("longs"); 3 = "re"; 4 = the supralinear flourish indicating an omitted "r"; 5 = "þ"; 6 = the macron signalling a following nasal; and 7 = the final flourish transcribed as "-e". (* = a supralinear "t"). Thus, "5 *" = þ t . 1 H 1 x honured , 1 x honurid , 5 x honure , 3 x honurable , 13 x honur , 20 x honour 2 H 4 x rekken , o x - þ 3 v. fn. 1 20 See Tanselle, op. cit. , p. 43, "Since accidentals can affect meaning and scribal practices in accidentals can constitute important textual evidence, a complete recording of such details, as well as of substantive variants, would seem to be desirable." 21 It remains to be seen what the possible effect on criticism might be of this demonstration that Hoccleve was no artless or careless poetaster, but on the contrary, one who was deeply concerned about his poetic language.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Sprinklings of Authority: The Folio Text of Richard II by John Jowett and Gary Taylor</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Authority, as Greg pointed out, is a comparative term. 1 As has long been recognized, Richard II belongs to a group of Folio texts printed from quarto copy, from an exemplar of an early print which had been annotated by reference to an authoritative manuscript (presumably the promptbook). It therefore derives from a text itself derivative, but sprinkled, so to speak, with authority—or at least with potential authority. An editor's job is to isolate those sprinklings of authority from the surrounding drought of derivation and corruption. This can be done only by first determining where the Folio simply reproduces an earlier printed text, and then by analysing the pattern and the nature of its departures from that text. In the case of Richard II , there is general agreement that F for the most part reproduces the text of Q3 (1598); it has, however, been suggested that for two passages (4.1.154-318, 5.5.19-5.6.52; TLN 2074-2243, 2685-2849) F was set up from a copy of Q5 (1615). The claims for a direct bibliographical dependence upon Q5 are considered (and rejected) in the first two sections of this paper. In the third section we turn to an analysis of the Folio's departures from its Q3 copy in an attempt to discern where the manuscript was consulted; in the fourth we consider what authority should be accorded the readings apparently taken from that manuscript; in the fifth, we analyse in detail the textual problem of the so-called 'abdication episode' (present in Q4, Q5, and F, but not in Q1). As a result of these interrelated investigations, we offer, finally, a newly comprehensive account of the relationship between Q1, F1, and the manuscripts which must have lain behind them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Q5 and the Abdication Episode In 1953 Richard E. Hasker (developing a conjecture by Alfred W. Pollard) demonstrated that, contrary to the prevailing orthodoxy, the printer's copy for most of the Folio text of Richard II was Q3, not Q5. 2 The possible influence of the later quarto, he urged, need be suspected in only two passages. The first of these, the abdication episode, or 'deposition scene', is relatively straightforward. As Hasker said: 'Since the "deposition scene" occurs in the section of the play set from Q3, which lacks this passage, leaves could have been taken from the copy of Q5 which supplied the last leaves . . . or a transcript of the lines could have been made when Q3 was compared with the manuscript prompt-book' (p. 69). Although Hasker himself eventually favoured the second of these options, the first has been endorsed by G. B. Evans and Matthew Black. 3 Hasker did not attempt to analyse spelling evidence in order to determine which of these two conclusions was the right one. Agreement of F with the spellings of Q5 would demonstrate nothing, since the manuscript might well have had many similar spellings; but spelling differences between the two texts are potentially valuable as negative evidence. If the Folio compositor never departs from his own spelling preferences except under the presumed influence of copy-spellings identical to those in Q5, then Q5—or something indistinguishable from it—was apparently his copy; on the other hand, if he repeatedly violates his own preferences against the spelling present in Q5, then he was apparently being influenced by copy spellings different from those in Q5, and hence was presumably setting the abdication episode (4.1.154-318; TLN 2074-2243) from manuscript copy. The following is a list of spellings in the abdication episode for which Folio Compositor A departs from the spelling of Q5, against his own preferences—or his own indifference—elsewhere. 4 (The figures in the third column indicate first how often he set the rejected alternatives present in Q5, then secondly how often outside this passage Compositor A set the form found here in F; 'j' indicates that the spelling occurs in a crowded line, where it may have been affected by the need to justify.) Q5 F Compositor A graunt grant 17; (1j) proceed proceede 10; 1 bow bowe 5; 0 tutor tuture 4; 0 haile hayle 10; 7 tend 'tend 3; 0 Mannors Manors 1; 0 Reuenewes Reuenues 1; 1 read (4) reade (4) 9; 7(+1j) Containing Contayning 3; 1 bate bait 3; 0 O Oh 93(+22j); 66(+10j) banckrout Bankrupt 0; 0; banqu'rout 1 satisfied (2) satisfy'd (2) 2; 1 indeed indeede 23(+6j); 7(+5j) Houshold House-hold unhyphenated 5; hyphenated 0 need neede 19(+1j); 2(+2j) The figures for Compositor A include all of his settings of the word in question. For most of these—those occurring in all of the plays he set from manuscript—we do not know the spelling of the word in his copy. For Richard II and Richard III , however, we can check the spelling in A's known copy, and see whether he altered or retained it. Such qualitative evidence somewhat diminishes the value of five of these anomalies. The only other example of 'proceede' occurs at Richard III 1819, where A's printed copy has 'proceed'. The participle 'Contayning' never appears elsewhere, but two of the three examples of the verb spelled 'contain' occur elsewhere in Richard II , and simply follow Q3; A's apparent preference for the 'contain' spelling may therefore simply derive from the influence of copy. Elsewhere Compositor A followed copy 'O' seventeen times, but he did alter to 'Oh' at least three times ( Richard II 1215, 1426; Richard III 710); the odds are, nevertheless, still against printed copy here. The only other example of 'satisfy'd' occurs at Richard III 1958, and departs from copy 'satisfied'. And although A is known to have retained 'indeed' 3 times in setting from printed copy, he also changed it to 'indeede' once elsewhere ( Richard III 2434). However, none of the other fifteen anomalies in the table is affected by the available qualitative evidence; and of those which are affected, both 'Oh' and 'indeede' remain good evidence so long as it is understood that all such spelling evidence depends on relative probabilities. This strong spelling evidence against the use of printed copy is reinforced by two other details of the Folio accidentals. Although Compositor A has a strong tendency to add emphasis capitals to his copy, on two occasions here he fails to supply them for words capitalized in Q5 (weau'd-vp, TLN 2151; follyes, TLN 2151). As a test of the validity of this evidence, one can examine Compositor A's departures from copy spellings in a passage of identical length which he is agreed to have set from Q3. This control was taken from the 82 lines preceding the deposition scene (4.1.72-153; TLN 1991-2073), and the 90 lines after (4.1.319-5.1.71; TLN 2244-2333). 5 It will be most convenient to treat these separately. For the 82 lines preceding, Compositor A departed from Q3, and his own quantitative preferences, only 5 times: Q3 F Compositor A Elsewhere Calice Callis 0; 0; Callice 5 banisht banish'd 4; 4 Appellants Appealants 0; 2 breath ( noun ) breathe 1; 22 kin (2) Kinne (2) 1; 4 Two of these are less significant than they appear. Though A set 'banisht' four times elsewhere, on each occasion he simply reproduced the spelling of his Q3 copy (TLN 1201, 1221, 1224); in contrast, one of his other 'banish'd' spellings departs from Q3 (1170). Qualitatively, A prefers the spelling adopted here. Likewise, all three occurrences of 'Kinne' (two here, and one elsewhere) occur in justified verse lines; all four uses of 'kin' in unjustified lines. This leaves only 3 genuine anomalies in the passage preceding the abdication. The last of these ('breathe') occurs 35 lines before the beginning of the abdication episode; though it is conceivable that the use of manuscript copy began here (perhaps at the beginning of a manuscript page), it seems more likely that 'breathe' is in fact a compositorial error, rather than an anomalous spelling. Compositor A elsewhere consistently used 'breath' for the noun (with only one exception) and 'breather' for the verb (with only one exception), and in setting 'Be iudg'd by subiect, and inferior breathe,' (TLN 2048) he might easily have misinterpreted or mis-memorized the last word as a verb. The second half of the control passage contains five apparent anomalies: pernitious pernicious 1; 3 pitty pittie 8(+1j); 14(+2j) happy happie 10; 21(+1j) he hee 28(+74j); 604(+82j) worthy worthie 29(+5j); 3(+1j) Two of these are in fact not anomalous at all. Though the quantitative figures indicate a preference for 'happy', in the plays where A's copy is known he twice alters 'happy' to 'happie' ( Richard II 1321, 1424), and three times accepts copy 'happie' ( Richard III 676, 1972, 2393); he also twice accepts copy 'happy' ( Richard II 1155, 2297), and once alters 'happie' to 'happy' ( Richard III 2392). This word is obviously a poor guide to Compositor A's copy. So is 'hee'. On five other occasions A set 'hee' in an unjustified line, where his copy is known; in all of them his copy had 'he' ( Richard II 1139, 1456; Richard III 1754, 2023, 3233). As for 'pittie', A never elsewhere departed from copy 'pitty', but he did twice accept copy 'pittie' ( Richard III 2567, 2659). He never elsewhere encountered the word 'worthy' in printed copy. The most serious anomaly is 'pernicious' at 2250: on the one other occasion where A encountered it when setting from printed copy, he altered copy 'pernicious' to 'pernitious' (the reverse of the change here). This may be another word where, if we had more evidence, we would see that A is simply inconsistent; but it is possible he was still working from manuscript copy. The interpolated episode ends only five lines before, and the annotator may have continued with manuscript copy until the (unknown) end of a manuscript page. This assumption might also explain the Folio's omission of a necessary ' Manent Westmorland, Carleil, Aumerle ' after the ' Exeunt ' at the end of the deposition scene (2245). Q3 contains this 'Manent' direction, clearly placed in the left margin opposite 2246-48; although its omission from the Folio may be a mere compositorial error, the omission would be easier to understand if A were working from a manuscript, in which the direction was either missing, or less conspicuously placed. 6 However, direct use of Q3 had clearly resumed by 2251, three lines before the end of this Folio page, where F follows Q3 in omitting 'My Lo:'. The resumption of printed copy thus cannot be related to the casting off of copy for the Folio. As there are no substantive errors common to Q5 and F in the abdication episode, the compositor's copy can only be determined on the basis of agreements or disagreements in accidentals. For this purpose, we can take as significant all those departures from Q3 which violate A's preferences elsewhere, as defined by quantitative and (where available) qualitative evidence. The 20 such significant disagreements between Q5 and F in the abdication episode (21 if 'pernicious' is included) contrast strikingly with the 4 anomalies in a passage of similar length surrounding that episode (3 if 'pernicious' is excluded). This discrepancy is difficult to explain except on the assumption that manuscript copy was used for the abdication episode. This in turn makes it easier to explain the peculiarities at the end of the play. 7</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Q5 and Act V Hasker proposed that Q5 was used again briefly at the very end of the play, from circa 2685 to 2849 (5.5.19-end); this hypothesis has been challenged by J. K. Walton. 8 According to Walton, Hasker's case for Q5 rests on three G5/F1 substantive agreements: euer (2738, for Q1-3 neuer ), wer't (2769, for Q1-3 art ), and thine (2777, for Q1-3 thy ). Walton is right in objecting that these are indifferent variants. But, in the first place, Walton ignores a number of other Q5/F1 agreements in this passage, because he is himself only concerned with dialogue variants. Thus, at 2767 F1 agrees with Q5 on the positioning of the Groom's exit direction; Q3 places it (incorrectly?) after 2773. Then F1 agrees with Q5 on the word strikes in the stage direction at 2779 ( Exton strikes him downe ), where Q3 has the imperative strike . Then at 2790 F1 and Q5 agree on the necessary direction Exit (which should more properly be Exeunt ), which Q3 omits. One must concede at once that these variants are also indifferent, and that the Folio readings could independently derive from the theatrical manuscript which was evidently available for comparison with Q3. One must also grant that the total of indifferent agreements with Q5 is entirely insufficient to establish the use of that quarto throughout the text ; Walton persuasively demonstrates, by extensive comparison with other post-Folio quartos, that we should expect a certain number of coincidental indifferent agreements. But though this lateral evidence strongly supports Hasker's own rejection of the earlier orthodoxy (that F was set throughout from Q5), it does nothing to refute Hasker's contention that Q5 was used briefly at the end of the play. Walton can rightly claim that this number of indifferent agreements would be nothing unusual, if spread out over an entire play; but so many indifferent agreements within 53 lines (2738-90) is another matter altogether. We are here dealing with statistical probabilities, and the clustering of variants in close proximity to one another dramatically increases their evidential significance. One need not be a statistician to see this: 6 indifferent agreements within 53 lines are obviously more significant than 6 within 2850 lines. In fact, by even the simplest arithmetic, they are 57 times more significant. It is surely impossible to dismiss this as coincidence. However, Walton is quite right in objecting that Hasker's only accidentals evidence for Q5 influence—the Q5/Folio spelling tels (2721, where Q3 has tells )—is not convincing, since B prefers the shorter spelling. In fact, he sets tels 20 times elsewhere, and tells only twice, both in justified lines. Moreover, a comprehensive check of all differences in accidentals between Q3 and Q5 in this portion of the text does nothing to confirm the use of Q5 copy. We list only the significant agreements (i.e. disregarding spellings, or differences in italicization and capitalization, where B simply follows a strong preference). In the final column, we list first the occurrences, elsewhere in B's work, of the spelling found here in the Folio, then secondly the occurrences of the alternative spelling (found here in one or the other quarto). Q3 F1 Q5 Compositor B Elsewhere 1. (2694) kinde kind--- kind 15; 112 kinde 2. (2699) beggar--- Beggar Begger 12; 54 -er 3. (2700) penurie--- penurie Penurie 4. (2708) time--- time Time 5. (2723) bell--- bell Bell 6. (2747-60) horse (4)--- horse (4) Horse (4) 7. (2778) hell--- hell Hell 8. (2783) hell--- hell Hell The accidentals evidence obviously conflicts with the substantive evidence, but the conflict can (we believe) be easily reconciled. Hasker's choice of 2685 (5.5.19) as the starting point for use of Q5 was, by his own admission, somewhat arbitrary, being based not on actual evidence for Q5 from that specific point onward but on the desire to have the Q5 stint begin at the beginning of a Q3 page, on the assumption that the exemplar of Q3 being used as copy lacked its two final leaves. In fact, the actual substantive evidence for the use of Q5 all falls within 53 lines, 2738-90, which include only the accidentals evidence nos. 6-8 above, and exclude four Q3-F1 substantive agreements: eare (2711, for Q5 care ), their (2718, for Q5 there ), haue (2728, for Q5 hath ), and of (2796, not in Q5). In other words, all the Q5/F1 substantive agreements fall within 53 lines, while all the Q3/F1 substantive agreements fall either before or after those lines. In short, substantive variants pointing to Folio dependence on Q5 cluster inexplicably in a brief passage where the Folio accidentals point to dependence on Q3; this brief passage is surrounded by both substantive and accidentals evidence pointing to Folio dependence on Q3 (as elsewhere throughout the play). The most plausible explanation for this otherwise-inexplicable pattern is that one page was missing from the original theatrical manuscript which was collated against Q3, and that this single missing page had been supplied (at some earlier date, by someone other than Jaggard) by a transcript of the relevant portion of Q5. This hypothesis has the advantage of explaining all the conflicting substantive evidence; it also provides an explanation of the activities in both the playhouse and the printing shop much more plausible than Hasker's. Hasker proposes that an annotated copy of Q3 was itself being used as the promptbook, and that the two defective leaves at the end of that quarto were patched with leaves from Q5. But—in the first place—why should anyone in the King's Men have bothered annotating a quarto, if a manuscript promptbook was already available, and would itself almost certainly have contained, on its final page, the licence of the Revels office? 9 And if there were a gap in either a manuscript promptbook or a promptbook based on Q3, why repair that gap by spoiling an exemplar of Q5, merely for the sake of two leaves? The more so, in that the use of Q5 would necessarily involve—even if we presume a lacuna of only 53 lines—the recto and verso of a single page (K2 and K2 v ), which would make even cutting and pasting difficult: the small Q5 sheet would have to be inserted whole in the midst of a manuscript almost certainly written on full folio pages. Moreover, are we to imagine that the gap in the manuscript happened to coincide with the beginning and end of two Q5 pages? If not, the scribe repairing the gap would either have to cross out some of his surviving manuscript text, or cross out lines at the beginning and end of his Q5 insert. This would simply add to the messiness of an already messy, unsatisfactory, and implausible arrangement. It would be much more sensible to replace the missing manuscript page with a new manuscript page, transcribed from Q5. This would repair the gap, without any need to collect and combine four or more actors' parts, but without destroying the exemplar of Q5, or inserting a quarto-sized leaf in the midst of a (presumably) folio-sized manuscript. And the hypothesis of a lacuna-repairing transcript of Q5 would also explain a number of anomalous differences between Q5 itself and the Folio text. If the book-keeper of the King's Men had simply inserted in the promptbook one or more leaves from Q5, why should he have bothered to cross out ' Enter [ a ] Groome [ of the Stable ]' (2733), or ' Exit [ Groome ]' (2767), or '[ Heere ] Exton strikes him downe ' (2779), or ' Enter [ Henrie ] Percy ' (2814)? His other changes to stage directions are more comprehensible: the specific actors called for in ' Enter Keeper ' instead of ' Enter one ' (2763), and in ' Enter Exton and Seruants ' instead of ' The murderers rush in ' (2779), perhaps even the specific property of ' with a Dish ' instead of ' with meat ' (2763). But there is no good reason for the first four changes, in terms of a specific theatrical function which Q5 as it stood did not serve. On the other hand, if the book-keeper were transcribing Q5, he might well have fidgetted with some of its wording of stage directions, even when this was strictly unnecessary. If leaves from Q5 were simply inserted in the promptbook, these changes could only have been made by an extraordinary intervention, which would in turn have produced a messier book; if Q5 were being transcribed, they could easily have been made in the course of transcription, without in any way affecting the legibility of the promptbook. Let us now consider the situation from a publisher's or printer's point of view. If someone was preparing printer's copy for Richard II by collating a manuscript promptbook against an exemplar of Q3, and if that promptbook contained a few leaves from Q5, why damage the promptbook (presumably of some value to the theatre) by taking those leaves out? He already had a printed text for the compositors to use; there would be no need for those Q5 sheets, and the divergence in pagination between them and Q3 would add little to their attractiveness. Equally, if he did retain Q3 as the printer's copy, why should he be tempted to transfer indifferent dialogue variants from one printed text (Q5) to another printed text (Q3)? He might naturally transfer any manuscript alterations to the stage directions of Q5; but why go through the dialogue collating the one printed text against the other? On the other hand, if the book-keeper had (at some earlier date) transcribed parts of Q5, in order to replace a missing manuscript page, then when the collator came to that transcribed page he would only notice, at most, a change of hand, or of paper; he would have no reason to regard the page as of any less importance or authority than the rest of the manuscript. The most plausible reconstruction of the activities of the King's Men's book-keeper and of the collator who prepared Jaggard's copy would thus lead us to expect that a one-page manuscript gap had been repaired by a transcript of the relevant portion of Q5, and that this portion of the text had then been treated by the collator just as he treated the remainder of the play, comparing the manuscript with Q3, and transferring any manuscript variants which he noticed onto the printed text. Let us now return to the accidentals evidence. All ten variants in capitalization point to Q3, without any regard to quarto or Folio page-breaks, or to the pattern of substantive agreements. The two pieces of good spelling evidence are adjacent and conflicting; the Q5/F1 spelling agreement comes 44 lines before the first Q5/F1 substantive agreement, during which interval there are three Q3/F1 substantive agreements. Moreover, this agreement occurs in a phrase—'they finde a kind of ease'—where B's preferences may have been affected or confused by rhyme and repetition. The punctuation evidence (not listed above) falls into no significant pattern. Most of the punctuation variants are affected by the sense; in context, only twice does the Folio punctuation represent a choice between two equally-acceptable variants: Q3 F Q5 (2729) mad:--- ˜: ˜. (2817) graue:--- ˜: ˜; Both of these point to Q3—as Hasker himself noticed (p. 68). In conclusion: Walton is right in contending that Q3 was the compositors' printed base for all of Richard II , and Hasker is right in contending that a short portion of the text at the end of the play (TLN 2738-90; 5.5.70-115) has been contaminated (at some point in its transmission) by Q5. The explanation offered here—that a one-page gap in the manuscript was at some time patched by transcribing the relevant lines from Q5—strongly suggests that the influence of the two quartos stems from two different phases and agencies of transmission: the annotation of Q3 copy for use by Jaggard, and the (earlier) patching of the promptbook by reference to Q5. 10 This hypothesis also, necessarily, impinges on another aspect of the Folio text—the nature of the promptbook itself. Pollard suggested that the promptbook was a marked-up copy of Q1; Greg, Wilson, Hasker, and Ure all cogently challenged that conclusion. 11 But Hasker, puzzled by the need 'to explain why the copy for the First Folio Richard II should have been a made-up quarto' composed of leaves from two different editions (Q3 and Q5), adopted Fredson Bowers's (private) suggestion that the copy of Q3 used by the Folio compositors was 'itself the official prompt-book of the King's Company' (pp. 69-70). This conjecture becomes superfluous and implausible if our alternative explanation of Q5's local influence is adopted. 12</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. The Pattern of Annotation Pollard's detailed study of the variants in Q1-5 and F drew attention to the large number of instances in which F restored a correct Q1 reading where Q3 had acquired an error, the latter originating either in the Q2 printer's copy for Q3, or in Q3 itself. In conjunction with the sweeping changes from typically authorial stage directions to typically theatrical directions made in F, this led Pollard to the conclusion that the printer's copy for F had been annotated with reference to the promptbook. F's accuracy in correcting Q3 could not be attributed to chance. Pollard also saw that such annotation could explain a number of Q/F variants which are unlikely to have arisen in the printing-house: F had acquired a promptbook reading which differed from that in Q. But this insight was not put forward as having much significance for the editor: Pollard explained most of the assumed textual variants between the promptbook and Q as actors' unauthorized departures from the true text, departures which had at some point been incorporated into the promptbook. The actual corrections of error in Q were therefore deemed to be few in number. Further, the process of annotation was declared to be 'very hastily and inadequately performed', words of caution that have sometimes been interpreted as words of denial. In his new Arden edition, Peter Ure provided a detailed application of Pollard's analysis of variants, examining their implications for the authority of F. Ure suggested that Q1 was set from a non-authorial transcript which contained memorial errors; this unlikely hypothesis has since been questioned by both Charlton Hinman and Alan Craven. 13 Ure tends to discuss Q/F variants in terms of categories of F error—thereby assuming that the Folio variants are errors, which only need to be properly categorized. One such category is 'unauthorized editorial replacements'. These account for 'perhaps the majority of words of nearly equivalent meaning in the Folio', though 'some at least' can be ascribed to the actors (pp. xxi-xxii). This conjecture is not offered as an explanation for metrical sophistication (for instance), but simply as a reason for dismissing a group of variants that will prove of some interest, 'nearly equivalent words'. 'Unauthorized editorial interference' is, of course, a real possibility, with Richard II as with other Folio texts. Since someone had to go through Q3 altering it by reference to the manuscript, that someone might well have made on his own initiative other changes not warranted by the manuscript. But though Ure may be right in believing that editorial interference took place, he is almost certainly wrong about the nature of such interference. An editor might add stage directions which he believed to be necessary, or modernize obsolete or obscure spellings, or provide act and scene divisions, or remove profanities; he might even, according to some textual scholars, regularize speech prefixes, or substitute commonplace words for rare or arcane ones. But why should he deliberately and randomly insert words of 'nearly equivalent meaning' to substitute for those in his printed and manuscript sources? Such a procedure would be particularly inane if, as Ure contends, these adjustments were made as part of the process of consulting the promptbook in order to modify Q3: in other words, the 'editor' is looking at a manuscript which might contain such variants, but none of them actually derive from that source, being instead unnecessarily and uncharacteristically intruded by the editor himself. Ure does not properly distinguish between the sort of change an actor would make and that which would be introduced in the printing house, or by a literary 'editor'; he does not explain how actors' verbal substitutions got into the promptbook; 14 he explains neither the necessity for supposing this additional stage of contamination nor the motives behind such a strange endeavour. The effect of his suggestion is to move a vital group of variants away from the potential authority of the manuscript. Ure's attitude towards the Folio text is most apparent in his comment on the F readings he admits as potential emendations. Ure claims that, whether he accepts them in his edition or not, 'I do not think we need entertain the possibility of prompt-book provenance for any of them' (p. xxii). Even though his own theory of memorial transmission means that Q1 is imperfect, even though F can occasionally have correct readings, F is only admitted to preserve promptbook readings when they are wrong . This is an especially striking conclusion in light of Pollard's original rejection of chance as an explanation for the considerable Folio restoration of Q1 readings: F should be as effective in correcting Q1 error as it is in correcting Q3, especially as neither the Q3 copy for F nor the promptbook would distinguish between these classes of variant. In what amounts to a rejection of one of Pollard's most important and persuasive conclusions, Ure explains some of the F restorations of Q1 readings as chance, others as sophistication; 'a majority of other restorations may be ascribed to the unaided editorial acumen of the Folio' (p. xxiii). Yet Ure is no conservative extremist: other editors have followed similar editorial procedures. Paradoxically, G. B. Evans in the Riverside edition admits that 'substantive readings which appear for the first time in F1 deserve some consideration as possible Shakespearean second thoughts' (p. 838), but in practice adopts fewer F readings than Ure. Evans recognizes not only that the promptbook is the most likely source for a number of F readings, but also that such readings are difficult to dismiss as corruptions of the text. The New Penguin text (1969) does not differ radically from the new Arden, but Stanley Wells similarly—if somewhat cryptically—remarks after discussing the variant stage directions, 'Other alterations were made, some of which may be considered improvements on Q1' (p. 270). There are therefore two problems. First, the most respected commentators have cast doubts on F as a source of potentially authoritative readings. This scepticism begins with Pollard's criticism of the inefficiency of the collation of Q3 against the promptbook—cautionary remarks which have sometimes been more enthusiastically taken up than the implications of his more general observation, that such a collation must indeed have taken place. W. W. Greg described the collation as 'superficial'; this may be a fair summary of some of Pollard's words, but sounds more dismissive than Pollard intended. 15 Greg's view was endorsed by Walton (p. 243); Ure elaborates upon Greg. On the other hand, but still beginning with Pollard, some editors have recognized that F is likely to have rather more than the bare minimum of valid readings, and have noted the actual superiority of some F readings—without feeling they are in a position to adopt them. The view that F should be followed more often is a reasonable one, but it has been expressed only tentatively. Sympathetic editors have probably been deterred partly by lack of evidence and partly to avoid the accusation of opening the floodgates to personal whim. Yet Pollard's comments are not the last possible word on the process of collation with the promptbook. Its linear progression can be investigated in some detail. The only such attempt has been Walton's study, which in a disappointing three-page discussion does not go beyond splitting up the variants according to the five acts. Walton at least shows that (as might be expected) the annotation was not uniform: Q1 readings are restored less effectively in the second and third acts. The simple expedient of plotting F's restoration of Q1 readings as they occur against its perpetuation of Q3 error gives a more localized picture. This is shown in Table 1. Anyone who suspects that the alternation between correction and perpetuation of error is random should try tossing a coin and plotting the sequence of results. The average length of an unbroken sequence of heads or tails will be found to be about 1.5. This is far from the case in Table 1. This information alone allows us to establish that some parts of the text were more effectively corrected than others. Indeed some areas were completely corrected; others were untouched. If nothing else, this pattern points away from Ure's multiplicity of causes for Q1-F1 agreement against Q3. We see a single process, spasmodically careful and efficient. This can only make promptbook annotation more plausible. Given this framework, the remaining indications of possible promptbook annotation can be set alongside it, as can contrary evidence of a failure to consult the promptbook. Each part of the promptbook manuscript would have been arranged in three vertical sections: speech-prefixes, text, and stage directions. All received attention from the annotator. Although he could have worked on the sections simultaneously, it is possible that he split his work into defined stages, handling the text separately from its adjuncts. For this reason, the evidence of speech-prefixes and stage directions is considered separately later, as is the evidence of another completely separable category of annotation, the marking of act and scene divisions. Many altered or added stage directions in F clearly derive from the promptbook, as do major Folio cuts. Editors agree on the need to adopt a number of F readings (though they disagree on whether those readings derive from the promptbook). The provenance of the alterations of God to heauen is uncertain, and needs investigating to establish whether some or all of the profanity had been eliminated in the manuscript. Some F variants appear to be manuscript misreadings; if so, they too derive from annotation. On the negative side, F occasionally attempts to emend Q3 without bringing it into line with Q1; elsewhere it perpetuates error in Q1-3 which cannot be expected to have stood in the promptbook. One further class of variants might be positive, negative or neutral in individual instances: F's relineation of Q3. Each of these categories of evidence will need to be discussed separately. 16 Compounded Error Whereas Table 1 expresses F's success as against its inaction in correcting Q3, it takes no account of actual failures. On nine occasions F compounds an error in Q3 which it apparently undertakes to correct. These are as follows: 17 TLN Q1 Q2 Q3 F1 1.1.71 82 spoke, or thou spoke, or thou spoke, or what spoken, or canst worse canst thou canst thou canst 2.1.18 659 whose taste the whose state the of his state: wise are found wise are found then there are sound 2.2.3 955 life-harming half-harming selfe-harming 2.2.103 1058 there no there two there 3.3.17 1601 our heads your heads your head 3.3.119 1706 princesse a Prince a Prince, is 3.4.24 1834 come commeth comes 4.1.41 1964 to see that I to see the to see the 5.3.63 2562 held hald had This category may contain readings where the promptbook has been consulted but inadequately represented or even readings where the promptbook differed from Q1, though one would not expect either of these to occur regularly. In other respects the group of nine should indicate lines which escaped collation. If the annotator overlooked a quarto error, which was then noticed by the compositor setting up the line, the compositor could either consult the manuscript himself, or correct on his own initiative. Compound errors could, of course, only occur if the compositor chose the second of these two options, and the presence of such errors in Richard II (and other Folio texts) suggests that re-consultation of the manuscript in such circumstances was rare, or non-existent. Indeed it is possible that the manuscript could not be consulted, because it was not in the printing house. The small number of compounded errors is itself significant when compared with the number of correct restorations of the Q1 reading. But to compare figures directly would be misleading, if the hypothesis of relatively well-corrected areas of text has any validity: one would need to examine in turn the situation inside and outside those areas. Shared Error Errors common to all the quartos and F will be a reliable guide to lines not checked against the promptbook—if such errors can be securely identified, and if they do not originate with Shakespeare himself. No such list can be definitive. Ours includes editorial emendations which are usually accepted, together with one convincing emendation (932) introduced by Kenneth Muir in his 1963 Signet edition, 18 and 2 proposed readings (964, 2556) and a proposed alternative reading (1090) first put forward here. 19 TLN Q1-F1 Emendation 1.1.163 168-9 obedience bids, | Obedience bids Obedience bids 2.1.283 932 Iohn Thomas 2.2.12 964 With . . . at At . . . with 2.2.110 1065 Thus disorderly thrust Thus thrust disorderly or Disorderly thus thrust 2.2.138 1090 Will the hatefull commons Will the hatefull commoners or The hatefull commons will 3.4.11 1817 griefe ioy 3.4.67 1879 you the you then the 4.1.148 2068 Preuent it Preuent 5.3.31 2528 my the 5.3.57 2556 lest thy lest One odd variant does not quite fit into this category. Q1 has a self-evident dittography: Landlord of England art thou now not, not King. (2.1.113; TLN 756) F reads: Landlord of England art thou, and not King: F might have independent authority from the promptbook, though it surely gives the weaker reading. On the other hand, the simplest unauthoritative correction would have been to remove the first (nonsensical and extrametrical) 'not'. Perhaps an annotation was misunderstood by the compositor. In any case, this variant cannot confidently be put forward as a miscorrection resulting from failure to consult the promptbook. Manuscript Misreadings A number of errors in F are such that it is hard to imagine that they are misreadings of the printed quarto copy. They appear to be misread manuscript literals. These are easily explained as the annotator's misreadings of the promptbook or, if the book was a non-authorial transcript, as errors committed when the promptbook was prepared. In either case they will indicate annotation (however mistaken). Variants of this kind are: 1.1.57 62 doubled/doubly 1.2.42 259 complaine/complaint 1.3.28 325 plated/placed 1.3.71 368 vigour/rigour 1.4.28 602 smiles/soules 3.2.112 1470 beards/Beares 4.1.33 1956 simpathie/sympathize Lineation Changes to lineation can be made for various reasons. The commonest cause is the need to accommodate a long line of print to the narrow Folio column. Like other texts, Q1 sometimes preserves the manuscript feature of a run-on part line at the beginning of a speech. When F splits such a line, it proves nothing about promptbook consultation. It does not constitute negative evidence because the alteration could originate from the promptbook; alternatively, the promptbook may not itself have changed the lineation. In one instance the Folio relineation is not only unsatisfactory, but also disturbs the following two lines. Q has: H. Bull. on both his knees doth kisse king Richards hand, And sends allegeance and true faith of heart To his most royall person: hither come (3.3.35; TLN 1620-22) The F compositor failed to realize that the abbreviated name constitutes a mid-speech part line, and set as follows: Henry Bullingbrooke vpon his knees doth kisse King Richards hand, and sends allegeance And true faith of heart to his Royall Person: hither come The relineation tells us nothing about promptbook influence. Even if F's expansion of the name and variant vpon derive from the promptbook, the compositor was himself almost certainly responsible for the relineation. 20 Once the name had been expanded, Q's first line would not fit F's measure, and the Folio compositor probably altered the line-breaks in order to fit his text into three type lines (the same number as in Q). He would hardly have done this if the annotator had indicated a line-break after Bullingbrooke (as in all modern editions). We can thus be fairly confident that the annotator did not 'correct' Q's lineation; but of course the annotator's manuscript may have treated ' Henry . . . hand' as one line—just as Q's manuscript had apparently done. A similar relineation occurs at 2.2.92-94, TLN 1048-49: Q1: Hold take my ring. Seruingman My Lord, I had forgot to tel your Lordship: To day as I came by I called there, F: Hold, take my Ring. Ser. My Lord, I had forgot To tell your Lordship, to day I came by, and call'd there, The verbal variants in F derive from Q2 by way of Q3. Q's lineation would fit the F measure, but it seems that the combination of a part-line at the end of the preceding speech and the metrical irregularity of To day . . . there induced someone in the printing-house to interfere with the lineation. In other words, relineation is here a direct consequence of an earlier failure to consult the promptbook. Almost all the discrepancies between the lineation common to Q and F and that followed in modern editions are due to the different licences observed in early texts. In just one passage both texts are recognized as being seriously mislined: I should to Plashie too, but time wil not permit: All is vneuen, and euery thing is left at sixe and seauen. (2.2.120-122; TLN 1074-75) Line-breaks are required after too and vneuen in order both to regularize the metre and to establish the rhyming couplet. In Q1, 1074 appears at the end of sig. D4 v . The book was set by formes, and the compositor had sufficient trouble with fitting the cast-off copy to his page to induce him actually to omit two full lines of text when setting the opposite (inner) forme of the same sheet. 21 Q1's lineation at 1074-75 is a printing-house expedient to save space. F thus perpetuates a layout which cannot have appeared in the promptbook. The same circumstances determine a less impressive example; in Q1 this occurs in the inner forme of sheet D, where the spacing problems were most acute. On D4 (1014) Q1 runs on a part-line at the end of a speech with the previous line; F does likewise. The most obvious example of relineation deriving from the promptbook is in the adjustment to the text after the abdication episode. The changed wording saves a part-line, so the text is rearranged to take in the part-line at the end of the speech (2245-6; discussed below in Section V). Significantly, this is not the only case where verbal variation accompanies relineation. Even conservatively-minded editors accept F in one such instance. Q: Yorke The time hath bin, would you haue beene so briefe He would haue bin so briefe to shorten you, (with him, F: York. The time hath beene, Would you haue beene so briefe with him, he would Haue beene so briefe with you, to shorten you, (3.3.11-13; TLN 1594-96) The significance of F's relineation here is not that it must be a promptbook feature itself. But the relineation shows how far the F compositor needed to alter the text in order to accommodate the addition of the two words. Such a change needs a definite external cause, especially as the text in Q1 is not noticeably corrupt. Another case is structurally somewhat similar: Q: Would they make peace? terrible hel, Make war vpon their spotted soules for this. F: Would they make peace? terrible Hell make warre Vpon their spotted Soules for this Offence. (3.2.133-134; TLN 1492-93) Here editors sometimes approvingly repeat Pollard's view that F's Offence is 'pittifully weak'. To show that there is no offence metrically in Q1, Pollard explained: 'The words "make peace" are a cry of rage which can only be adequately rendered by giving to each the time of a full foot. The next two words are pronounced slowly, and after "hel" there is a slight pause marked by the dramatic comma, and then the next line follows with a swift rush' ( A New Shakespeare Quarto , pp. 85-86). Despite this extraordinarily subjective apologia, Pollard may be right to accept Q1 as the wording in the printer's copy. If F gives the Q1 printer's copy reading, it is difficult to see how the Q1 compositor came to set the text he did. But Pollard and his followers require us to believe that an actor or someone preparing F both relined the passage and added to the wording, simply in order to eliminate a tetrameter in the preceding line . 22 Parallels for such an intervention are not easy to find, and those who were involved in the preparation of this and other Folio texts do not seem to have been unduly traumatized by the occasional tetrameter. If the Folio changes in these lines were deliberately introduced in the printing-house, then consultation of the promptbook provides a single, simple explanation for the change, an explanation which traces it to a source known to have been consulted elsewhere in this text; just as important, consultation of the manuscript provides a credible motive for the change. And if the F reading stood in the promptbook, it is perverse to attribute that variant to an actor when it could originate with the author himself. There might perhaps be some excuse for denying it to Shakespeare if F's reading was indeed 'pitifully weak'; but this is surely a case where Pollard's predisposition to blame the actors, or other agents of corruption, got the better of his critical sense. Offence gives the line a more positive ending; it brings out an otherwise latent irony, that the usual Christian virtue of making peace is here seen as a sin, an 'Offence'; it brings warre into more powerful juxtaposition with peace . In these lines the relineation is a vital part of the evidence in support of promptbook annotation. Other instances of significant relineation do not involve verbal variants, and must be considered solely on their own merits. For example: Q: King Why Vnckle whats the matter? Yorke Oh my liege, pardone me if you please, If not I pleasd not to be pardoned, am content with all, F: Rich. Why Vncle, What's the matter? Yor. Oh my Liege, pardon me if you please, if not I pleas'd not to be pardon'd, am content with all: (2.1.186-188; TLN 833-836) Line-breaks are required after liege and pleasd . Q1 is explicable: the copy probably ran on the part-line (writing 'Oh . . . pleasd' on one text line); the compositor began to do likewise, but had to improvise a relineation in order to adjust the lines to his measure. F makes a strange attempt to rectify this. But in Q3 the end of liege is just below the end of Vnckle . King. Why Vnckle, whats the matter? Yorke. Oh my liege, pardon me if you please, (D1 v ) A carelessly-placed line-break mark, intended to split the line after liege , could easily be misinterpreted by the Folio compositor as an instruction to introduce a break after Vnckle instead. Once the compositor had run on the line after Liege , he would find himself unable to fit 'pardon . . . pleas'd' on the same line. His compromise guaranteed no repetition of the problem on the following line. Surprisingly, the failed relineation is best explained as the result of an authoritative annotation. Where the Q1 copy evidently ran on part-lines, a correction in F can plausibly be attributed to promptbook annotation if it was not undertaken to allow for the narrower F measure. There are three such examples: Q: And with vplifted armes is safe ariude at Rauenspurgh. F: And with vp-lifted Armes is safe arriu'd At Rauenspurg . (2.2.50-51; TLN 1003-4) Q: The houshold of the King. North. What was his reason, he was not so resolude, When last we spake togither? F: The Household of the King. North. What was his reason? He was not so resolu'd, when we last spake together. (2.3.28-29; TLN 1135-37) Q: To kill the king at Oxford. Du. He shal be none, weele keepe him heere, Then what is that to him? F: To kill the King at Oxford. Dut. He shall be none: Wee'l keepe him heere: then what is that to him? (5.2.99-100; TLN 2473-75) (It will be noticed that the second instance contains a transposition, apparently an error in F.) Profanity Each of the classes of variant considered so far as potential additions to the picture established by Table 1 is in isolation too small to be of much statistical significance. This is not so for the God(s)/heauen(s) variants. There are 58 lines with God(s) in Q1; 26 of these are emended to heauen(s) in F1. 23 Another revision of profanity is Would God / I would (4.1.117; TLN 2037). Cuts As there are no cuts introduced in F whose length is of 2-3 lines, the actual cuts may conveniently be divided into two groups: single-line cuts and those of four lines and more. The latter are almost certainly deliberate measures taken to bring the text into conformity with the promptbook. They are usually described as 'theatrical' cuts, as though this is all we know, and all we need to know. But to say that the cuts are theatrical in historical fact ( represent the text as performed) does not prove that they are theatrical in origin ( made by others, without Shakespeare's approval), or that they are 'theatrical' in nature ( cheap, melodramatic, coarse, or inartistic). Cuts made in the theatre by Shakespeare's company could have been made by Shakespeare himself, resident dramatist and sharer; even if he did not initiate them, it can be assumed (in the absence of evidence to the contrary) that he approved of them and lent them his authority by so doing. 24 There are five of these longer cuts: 1.3.129-133, 1.3.239-242, 1.3.268-293, 3.2.29-32 and 4.1.52-59 (following TLN 426, 531, 557, 1388 and 1974). The single-line cuts may have similar authority, but as they could easily arise through compositorial error, they are less reliable as evidence of manuscript consultation. 25 Corrections of Q1 Error The most crucial readings of all from the point of view of confirming the pattern established by the F correction of Q3 error are those which correct error in Q1-3. For the sake of objectivity, the readings considered at this juncture are only those accepted in one, two or all of three representative editions: the new Arden (A), New Penguin (P) and Riverside (R). There are 20 such readings: 26 TLN Q1 F F accepted by 1.1.118 123 by by my A P R 1.1.139 144 Ah but (Q(a), Q2-3); But (Q(b)) But A P R 1.1.152 157 gentleman Gentlemen A P R 1.1.192 201 parlee parle A P 1.3.33 330 comes com'st A P R 1.3.172 465 sentence sentence then A P R 1.3.180 473 y'owe you owe A P 1.3.222 515 nightes night A P R 1.4.20 594 Coosens Coosin Cosin (Cosin) A P 1.4.52 627 Enter Bushie with newes .

Table 1 is itself by no means definitive, for several reasons. It gives no indication of the spatial distribution of variants, which are sometimes tightly clustered and elsewhere completely absent. It has wide indeterminate areas between some of the areas of relative correction and uncorrection. And it contains several random elements: fortuitous unauthoritative correction, isolated correction, light annotation, and oversight. A mechanism needs to be introduced to handle the elements of randomness. To achieve this, quite simply, a run of two or more indications of correction may be regarded as an area of correction. Such an area may be allowed to extend over single indications of non-annotation, but ends when two such opposing items occur consecutively. The same rules therefore apply for the uncorrected areas. (The terms 'corrected' and 'uncorrected' remain relative, for there may actually be any number of interim degrees.) This procedure may sound, if anything, conducive to chaos, for the number that defines a group could literally not be smaller. In fact, the exercise confirms and only minimally redefines the situation in Table 1. When the new data is included, only 17 areas of correction are established. These are as follows: 29-65 144-260 320-398 414-557 585-730 747-836 858-942 968-1004 1053-1055 1210-1229 1388-1415 1470-1615 1734-1798 1974-2017 2307-2368 2446-2517 2574-2716 The areas so defined give a working basis for describing the fluctuation within the process of annotation. But the approach remains explorative, and its limitations should be obvious enough. Most crucially, the guideline areas of correction fail to distinguish between the various degrees of consistency of annotation. Table 2, which gives the aggregated data, also gives a ready indication of the variation and of those areas of the text which remain indeterminate. For example, the passage from 1800 to 2100 might best be described as lightly annotated rather than corrected or uncorrected; this area alone accounts for over half the Q1-F agreements against Q3 that occur in passages defined as relatively uncorrected. The corollary is that elsewhere the distinction is sharper than the averaged-out statistics will suggest. Corrected areas account for 51% of the available text. 27 This nicely medial figure may be compared with the proportions of the various categories of data to fall within these corrected areas. {Major cuts 5/5 100% {A, P and R readings from F 18/20 90% {Manuscript misreadings 6/7 86% Evidence of consultation {F restorations of Q1 64/76 84% {Significant relineation (positive) 5/6 83% {Emended profanity 22/27 81% {Compounded error 2/9 22% {Shared error 2/10 20% Evidence of failure to consult {Q1 God ( s ) retained in F 6/32 19% {Uncorrected Q3 error 11/75 14% {Significant relineation (negative) 0/3 0% Individually the above figures demonstrate little. The bridging mechanism designed to compensate for randomness can enhance small groups whilst detracting from large groups where the individual items involved are of less statistical significance. But this criticism cannot apply to the comparison of corrected and uncorrected areas for the accumulated evidence for and against annotation, whereby each item is of equal value: Positive data in corrected areas 120/141 85% Negative data in corrected areas 21/129 16% Nor is the initial information from Table 1 unduly distorting the picture. Without it, the results are: Positive data in corrected areas 55/65 85% Negative data in corrected areas 10/54 19% Nevertheless Table 1 provided a remarkably useful starting point. The rest of the evidence confirms and refines what it suggested. The only way the demonstrated correlations make any sense is to suppose that the vast majority of the listed changes in F were made during a single process of annotation carried out with reference to the promptbook. Most important of all for the editor of Richard II is the irresistible association between (a) the most plausible emendations of Q1 in F and (b) other indications of annotation. Stage Directions The stage directions are more enigmatic. Not only are added and changed stage directions no commoner in corrected areas than elsewhere, they actually occur in corrected areas noticeably less frequently than we should expect if they were randomly distributed. Only 34% of added and changed directions are found in corrected areas, suggesting the inverse of the expected relationship. The number of directions involved is too large for this proportion to be dismissed as insignificant. And the situation is not meaningfully alleviated by assuming that the more trivial changes were introduced by compositors. Even if we exclude another possibly untrustworthy group, the scene-break directions, we are left with a similar situation for the remaining minority of mid-scene directions. It is in their interaction with Table 2 that the added and changed directions can usefully be divided into two groups. In the first 1000 lines, 63% of them occur in corrected areas; this distribution is almost certainly random, as the area has a greater than average amount of correction. But only 20% of the altered directions in the rest of the text occur in corrected areas. Even though corrected areas account for only 36% of this second half of the play, this dissociation—only 1 altered direction in 5 occurring in an area which shows signs of corrections to dialogue—is unlikely to be random. Speech Prefixes No explanation of the anomalous distribution of stage-direction annotation can be offered without first considering the speech-prefix variation. The most striking instance of the latter is the reorganization of prefixes for Richard and Bolingbroke. For Richard, Q1 invariably has ' King ' except for (a) the first prefix in 5.1, and (b) throughout 5.5, the prison scene. For the latter, he is unkinged ' Rich. '. Still in Q1, Bolingbroke's prefixes change from ' Bull. ' or ' Bul. ' (once ' Bulling. ') to ' King H. ' or ' King ' for 5.3 and 5.6. F leaves 1.1 unchanged, but thereafter systematically (without exception) changes Richard's ' King ' prefixes to ' Rich. ' (occasionally ' Ric. ' or ' Ri. '). 28 Bolingbroke's ' King ( H. )' prefixes all become ' Bul. ' in F. These changes go far beyond anything that could be expected by way of regularization. They clearly must echo the pattern found in the promptbook; there is no other reason why the trouble should have been taken to effect such a detailed change when the prefixes in Q1 were perfectly logical according to their own system. 29 Most of the ' King ' / ' Ri(c)(h). ' variants are in corrected areas, and many of those that are not do occur in indeterminate or bordering areas. This correspondence is probably not between the categories of variant themselves, but between areas of annotated text and scenes in which Richard is on stage. (There is no comparable patterning of ' King ( H. )' / ' Bul. ' variants.) At first sight this correspondence might appear to be explained by the coincidence of heavy annotation in the first 900 lines and the exceptional number of scenes in which Richard is present in the same part of the play. After 870 (2.1.222) Richard does not appear for almost 700 lines, and after 994 (2.1.295) there are only very brief snatches of correction until Richard returns to the stage. Such a situation may in itself be no coincidence. But even within the first 900 lines, the parts of the text with Richard present are more consistently annotated than the others. The same also holds true after 1000, when both Richard's appearances and the signs of annotation are scantier. The dramatic falling-off of annotation around 1000 may be a (belated) response to Richard's long absence. The presence of the play's principal character seems to have been one factor which influenced the annotator's fluctuations. Other significant F alterations of Q speech prefixes are limited and localised. Some, such as ' Herald ' / ' I Har. ' (401), ' Herald 2 ' / ' 2 Har. ' (407) and ' H. Per. ' / ' Percie ' (1130, etc.) suggest but do not demonstrate annotation. More definite are two altered character assignations, ' King ' / ' North. ' (2346) and ' yorke ' / ' Bul. ' (2612); a moved prefix (' Bag. ', 1100-1); and the distinctive changes ' Welch ' / ' Capt. ' (1285, 1291) and ' Man ' / ' Ser. ' (1850, 1865, 2657, 2660). Of the changes more definitely associated with promptbook annotation, only those at 2346, 2612, 2657 and 2660 fall within corrected areas. Stage directions whose rewording may be connected with the speech-prefix variants are ' a Welch captaine ' / ' a Captaine ' (1284), ' Gardeners ' / ' a Gardiner, and two Seruants ' (1833), and ' &amp;c. ' / ' and Seruants ' (2651). However, the reassignations at 2346 and 2612 are not particularly near changed stage directions. There are some signs that the annotated speech prefixes resulted from quite careful collation; there is no reason to associate it with annotation of the dialogue, and little evidence for an association with the annotated stage directions—though if (as appears to be the case) both speech prefixes and stage directions were collated thoroughly and systematically, such an association could exist, without being detectable. If the collator caught all of the speech-prefix and stage-direction variants, then coincidence of annotation in the two categories would result only from coincidence of variation between Q3 and the manuscript. The lack of a discernible association between stage-direction and speech-prefix annotation therefore demonstrates nothing; but the lack of association between speech-prefix and dialogue annotation is significant. Act and Scene Divisions The Folio's introduction of act and scene divisions supplies the final piece in the jigsaw. They were almost certainly marked on to the quarto copy. The theatrical significance of act divisions remains in some doubt, but it is most probable that by 1610 the King's Men's promptbooks were regularly marked with act divisions. 30 There is no particular reason to doubt the validity of F's act division. (No one will doubt that the beginning of Act 4 at least is correctly positioned.) The scene divisions, on the other hand, include a generally-recognized error. Despite Q1's direction ' Exeunt. Manet sir Pierce Exton, &amp;c. ' (2651-52), almost all editors agree that the required staging is indicated in F: ' Exeunt. | Enter Exton and Seruants '. But F does not introduce a scene break, instead continuing its scene 5.3, and so misnumbering 5.5 and 5.6 as 5.4 and 5.5. This single anomaly can scarcely be unconnected with the form of the direction in Q. The evidence of Richard II itself is here supported by an examination of other texts. The Folio contains eight plays set from lightly annotated quarto copy. One of these ( Romeo and Juliet ) has no act or scene divisions, and shows few if any signs of promptbook consultation; 31 five ( Love's Labour's Lost , The Merchant of Venice , A Midsummer Night's Dream , Much Ado about Nothing , and Titus Andronicus ), which were collated against theatrical manuscripts, provide act divisions only. 32 In Titus and Dream the text has been adjusted to accommodate an act division, which therefore seems likely to have come from the promptbook; the authority of the division in Love's Labour's Lost has been doubted, but the act divisions in the two other comedies are at least acceptable and may derive from theatrical manuscripts. On the basis of these six other plays we might expect consultation of a promptbook to result in the provision of act divisions, but not scene-breaks. Only Richard II and I Henry IV provide act and scene divisions; as with the other texts, the act divisions are sensible, but in both plays an error in the scene divisions results from a misleading quarto direction. In I Henry IV , after TLN 2890 Q5 (following Q1) has the stage direction, Here they embrace, the Trumpets sound, the King enters with his power, alarme to the Battell: then enter Dowglas, and Sir Walter Blunt . Whether or not one accepts Rowe's interpolation of ' and exeunt ' after ' embrace ', the stage is evidently cleared at some point before the entrance of Douglas and Blunt; all editors mark a new scene (5.3). The Folio omits ' Here ', substitutes ' entereth ' for ' enters ' and ' alarum vnto ' for ' alarme to ', but does not supply the missing scene division, and consequently mis-numbers the two following scenes. As with Richard II , it seems fairly evident that scene divisions were not marked in the annotator's manuscript, and that the annotator failed to mark a division here because he did not see the need for one. He could easily have been misled by the fact that Q5 does not contain the keyword ' Exeunt ' or ' Exit '; either the manuscript also failed to supply the word, or he failed to transfer it from that source. Hypothesis The Folio's printed copy (Q3) for Richard II received at least three kinds of annotation: the systematic provision of act and scene divisions (the latter apparently editorial), the systematic collation of stage directions and speech prefixes, and the sporadic collation of dialogue variants. The fluctuations of accuracy in this third stage are documented in Table 2. Explanations for that pattern of fluctuation are necessarily conjectural. To some extent, no doubt, they reflect the universal rhythm of alternating alertness and inattentiveness. 33 We have already suggested that the annotator may have been more alert to dialogue variants in scenes where the protagonist is present. From the beginning the annotator left some short passages uncorrected, with no obvious motive for his alterations in procedure. But just as the annotator of Love's Labour's Lost stopped his thorough collation shortly after TLN 977, so the annotator of Richard II after 1003-4 must have decided that it was necessary to lighten further the amount of attention he was giving the promptbook. The sudden slackening in his thoroughness is indeed quite dramatic (though not so total as in Love's Labour's Lost ). The annotator apparently saved time partly by avoiding work on those parts of the play which had already received at least some annotation; that is, around the added and changed directions themselves. A few exceptions crept in between 2364 and 2704, but his basic approach remained the same until the end of the play. Such a procedure is not entirely illogical, and is psychologically plausible. It also fits neatly into the larger pattern of Folio annotation. We have already pointed out that the layout of manuscript pages would have provided a physical encouragement and basis for separating the annotation of speech prefixes and stage directions from the annotation of dialogue. Such a separation also has an obvious basis in the nature of the two authorities the collator was comparing. His printed copy was a reprint of a good quarto, set from autograph or fair copy, presumably reliable in its verbal detail but deficient in the very theatrical features (stage directions and regularity of speech prefixes) supplied by a promptbook. Hemmings and Condell would have known very well the differences between these two kinds of documents, and even if they were not themselves responsible for collating quarto and manuscript, one would expect them to have discussed with the publishers, at least in general terms, the differences between the material in their possession and the printed texts already available. Finally, such a method of working would have been immediately attractive and intelligible to a printer or publisher: Moxon explains the normal two-step compositorial procedure for setting pages with ' Marginal Notes . . . down the Side or Sides of the Pages '. 34 Before Richard II , four Folio texts had been set from annotated quarto copy: Much Ado about Nothing , Love's Labour's Lost , A Midsummer Night's Dream , and The Merchant of Venice . In each case, the annotation was sparse, chiefly affecting act divisions, stage directions and speech prefixes. But in the case of Richard II it seems to have been decided, for whatever reason, at whatever point in time, to attempt a more extensive collation of Q3 against the manuscript. This collation of dialogue variants was, by modern standards, unevenly, even 'superficially' carried out, but it nevertheless represents a clear departure from previous Folio practice. And I Henry IV , the next Folio play to be set from quarto copy, shows similar signs of two different kinds of annotation: again, directions and prefixes have been altered throughout the text (often in trivial ways), and act and scene divisions provided, but alteration of the dialogue is sporadic. 35 I Henry IV and Richard II both, in different ways, offer evidence of a transition in methods of Folio annotation, from the consistent practice in the Comedies to the more extensive annotation first undertaken in earnest in Richard III (up to the end of quire s). 36 After this experiment in extensive annotation, laziness returned: the end of Richard III (t1-2 v ), Romeo , and Titus are given the absolute minimum of annotation (again concentrating on stage directions, prefixes, and act divisions), and the same was clearly intended at first for Troilus . This reversion to the earlier procedure may have been connected with the introduction of Compositor E, who by all accounts was an inexperienced compositor who may not have been able to cope with heavily-annotated copy; or Compositor E may have been called in because a decision had already been taken to make do with sparsely-annotated copy. In any case, after this lapse the Folio finally reverts to extensively prepared quarto copy for both King Lear and Troilus , the last two plays to have been set from printed copy. 37 In short, the Folio itself, like the individual plays within it, shows a pattern of varying thoroughness in the annotation of quarto copy; within this pattern, Richard II and I Henry IV are pivotal, and both reveal a discrepancy between their treatment of, on the one hand, directions, prefixes, and act and scene divisions, and, on the other, their annotation of dialogue. This apparent pattern in the nature of the copy from which Jaggard's compositors set inevitably raises a question about who prepared that copy. In the case of the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher Folio, a single publisher (Moseley) provided copy for six different printers; all of the texts seem to have been set from manuscript copy, and the collection and preparation of the copy was clearly the publisher's rather than the printer's responsibility. 38 The 1616 Jonson Folio was both published and printed by William Stansby; Jonson himself was clearly instrumental in supervising the preparation of this volume, and hence was probably personally responsible for the annotation of those plays set from annotated quartos. 39 The Shakespeare First Folio falls somewhere between these two eminent stools. Rather like Stansby, Jaggard—the sole printer—was also co-publisher; but the 1623 Folio, like that of 1647, was a posthumous publication, and the collection of texts to print was at least partly and perhaps wholly the work of Heminges and Condell. Unlike Jonson, Shakespeare was not available to annotate quartos himself; yet like the Jonson Folio, Shakespeare's contains plays undoubtedly set from annotated quarto copy. Who annotated those quartos? Heminges and Condell may have done so; or the publishers may have. In this case, however, the printer was himself one of those publishers—indeed the senior partner in the syndicate: as Greg concludes, 'There can then be little doubt that . . . the moving spirit of the scheme on the publishing side was Isaac Jaggard' ( First Folio , p. 6). Jaggard's shop was clearly in a position to provide the skills of collating and proofreading, and to ensure that the quartos were annotated in the manner most convenient for the compositors. Three more specific arguments suggest that even if the annotator was not 'Jaggard's man', he nevertheless worked in association with the printers. First, it does not seem likely that theatrical professionals would have introduced act divisions as inept as those in The Taming of the Shrew , Henry V , and I Henry VI ; the divisions in those plays, at least, seem to originate outside the theatre, and if so a similar origin for other editorial annotations of copy must be suspected. Secondly, it is certainly suspicious that the evidence for consultation of a manuscript in Folio Love's Labour's Lost ceases so abruptly only nine lines from the bottom of a Folio page—nine lines which would have required no other annotation. This might be a coincidence, but it suggests that annotation and casting-off of copy sometimes went hand in hand. Finally, a dramatic change in the character of the annotation at the end of Richard III coincides with an irregularity in the sequence of setting. After most of Richard III had been set up from heavily-annotated quarto copy, at the end of quire s work on the play was broken off, and setting of the Tragedies commenced. When eventually the compositors returned to Richard III , extreme variation from quarto copy continued for only half of the first column of t1; the remainder of the play was set from copy that had been only nominally edited, almost wholly in respect to speech prefixes and stage directions. This coincidence seems most plausibly explained in one of two ways, either of which presumes a close connection between the annotator of the quarto and Jaggard's compositors. The temporary abandonment of work on Richard III may have been due, as Hinman conjectured (II, 127), to difficulties in securing the copy for Henry VIII (which completes the Histories section of the volume). If this explanation is correct, then the drastic change in the level of annotation on column a of t1 may have occurred because the annotator had, in the interim, prepared copy for Titus and Romeo (already set or being set, when work on Richard III resumed), and as a result quickly decided to revert to the more economical degree of annotation employed for those two texts. This seems to us unlikely: why should the annotator stop work on Richard III just because copy for Henry VIII was not ready, why should there have been any problem about the copy for Henry VIII , and why when resuming Richard III should he extensively annotate half a column of Folio text before abruptly changing his methods? It seems likelier that the abrupt switch to the Tragedies occurred because the annotator had encountered some difficulty or deficiency in the manuscript he was consulting, halfway down the first page of a new quire, and that completion of Richard III was delayed while an attempt was made to rectify this difficulty. A full justification of this hypothesis would require an extensive investigation of the vexing problem of printer's copy for Folio Richard III ; here we must limit ourselves to the statement that such an investigation has convinced us of the validity of this hypothesis. 40 Certainly, it would be most economical to assume that the change in the nature of Jaggard's copy at the end of Richard III bears some relation to the change in the order of Jaggard's setting. This does not prove that the annotator was employed by Jaggard, or worked in his shop, but it does suggest—like the other evidence—that he worked in close association with Jaggard's compositors, and that he may sometimes have cast off pages as he annotated them. Two further facts, specific to Richard II , support the same conclusion. First, it seems most likely (as we have suggested) that the apparent influence of Q5 in a 53-line stretch near the end of the play results from the fact that someone in the theatre transcribed that passage from Q5, in order to rectify a gap in the promptbook. If someone in the theatre also presented Jaggard with annotated printed copy, why was Q3 (rather than Q5) used? The most obvious agent to have performed both functions would have been the book-keeper, who would have done both jobs between 1615 and 1622; we would expect the same quarto to be used for both, even if (as is possible) there had been a change of book-keeper. Secondly, we have already remarked on the fact that Folio Richard II betrays evidence of annotation more extensive than that in the Comedies; I Henry IV has been similarly annotated; Richard III , the next play set from quarto copy, was even more extensively annotated. Matthew Law, who was not a part of the syndicate which published the Folio, held the copyright to all three plays (and to no others printed in the Folio). One does not like to attribute such coincidences to coincidence. In the case of Troilus and Cressida , it has been widely accepted that the difference between Jaggard's abandoned first setting of the play (after Romeo , from quarto copy as minimally annotated as that for Titus and Romeo ) and the second (between the Histories and Tragedies, from heavily annotated quarto copy) probably resulted from difficulties of copyright: the heavy annotation was, in other words, a ruse to evade someone else's copyright. (See Greg, First Folio , pp. 447-449.) We find it difficult not to see the same motive at work in the change in the level of annotation which takes place between the Comedies and Richard II . 41 And if the annotators were working closely in conjunction with Jaggard's compositors, then the irregularity in setting which interrupted work on Richard II may be related to that which interrupted work on Richard III. Henry V, 1 and 2 Henry VI , and part of 3 Henry VI (all from manuscript copy) were set before Richard II was completed and 1 Henry IV begun. Could this interruption be due to the fact that the annotator was not far ahead of the compositors whose copy he prepared, and that in order for him to have time to finish the (more extensive than usual) annotation of Richard II and 1 Henry IV , the compositors had to leapfrog him and begin work on Henry V ? We cannot confidently answer this question, but it is surely legitimate to ask it. All of this evidence suggests that the man (or men) who annotated quarto copy for use by Jaggard's compositors worked closely with Jaggard's compositors. Jaggard's dual position as sole printer and co-publisher would have made this possible. But would the King's Men have turned any of their promptbooks over to Jaggard? Perhaps not. If Heminges and Condell would not let their promptbooks out of the theatre, then (obviously) the annotator must have performed the actual task of marking up a quarto in the theatre itself, rather than the printing house. 42 If the King's Men had no other manuscript of the play on hand, and if Jaggard for copyright reasons needed a source of variant readings, and if the King's Men wouldn't let go of their promptbook, then someone would have had to collate Jaggard's quarto against their promptbook. 43 Whoever that someone was, he must have worked, for a while, in close association with both the King's Men and Jaggard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. Authoritative F Readings The discussion so far has established a useful starting point for identifying readings in F which are likely to be authoritative. The annotation, we suggest, had the authority of the promptbook and was in places detailed and careful; moreover, we can identify where those places are. This does not leave us in a position mechanically to determine the authority of individual readings. Textual and even literary judgements will remain at the forefront. So, for example, Q's furbish at 373 (1.3.77) is undoubtedly richer and more unusual than F's mundane furnish ; Q should be followed, even though the line occurs within a corrected area. In other cases the pattern of correction, combined with the critical argument, presents a convincing case for the reading in F. But the argument from corrected areas will not prove sufficient in itself in the case of truly indifferent readings. Whereas some scenes are almost entirely corrected and others scarcely corrected at all, 3.2 shows a fairly representative mixture. From 1359 to 1387 (ll. 1-27) and from 1416 to 1473 (ll. 61-115) it contains no evidence of correction; the remaining areas, 1388-1415 and 1474-1580, contain variants from several categories suggesting annotation. What the tabulated list of corrected areas does not tell us is that after 1500 (l. 141) we enter a grey area where the evidence is thin and where two Q3-F agreements against Q1 suggest the absence of close annotation (1502, 1530). 44 In practice, the fifty lines after 1530 (l. 170) are indeterminate. It is worth spelling these details out, for this scene contains the most remarkable series of variants in the text. The relineation and added Offence at 1492-3 (ll. 133-134) have already been put forward as attributable not only to the annotator, not only to the promptbook, but to the hand of Shakespeare himself. A variant of similar status allows us to plunge into the indeterminate area and claim at least some of it for the annotator: Q: sit and waile theyr woes F: waile their present woes (l. 178; TLN 1538) If Q had read, let us say, waile theyr passing woes , F could be satisfactorily explained as an anticipation of presently in the following line. Even so, one would have to admit that present makes excellent sense and gives effective word-play on presently : a happy accident. Q reading as it does, such an explanation of F will not suffice. The assumption that an actor or the annotator himself would take a dislike to the Q reading and substitute that in F is fanciful, if not perverse. The logical agent is again Shakespeare himself. If anyone is likely to indulge in textual changes which appear to us inscrutable, it is the author. Yet here the change is perhaps more scrutable than it at first appears. Editors have compared the line in Q with another Shakespeare had previously written, but without drawing any inference from the comparison: My lord, wisemen nere sit and waile theyr woes, ( Richard II ) Great Lords, wise men ne'r sit and waile their losse, ( 3 Henry VI , 5.4.1; TLN 2884) One might fairly surmise that the motive for the Folio change was an author's motive: to eliminate what had been an unconscious borrowing from an earlier play (and an earlier personal style). There may be a similar instance within 3.2: Q: Crie woe, destruction, ruine, and decay, F: Cry Woe, Destruction, Ruine, Losse, Decay, (l. 102; TLN 1460) This variant has also been treated to inattention, or at least silence. The points to observe are obvious enough. Q's and could not possibly be misread Losse , nor, as we usually understand the psychology of the process, could the variant arise through substitution. F's reading is more concrete, forceful and specific; the metre is locked firmly into the sense, where a reading of Q must either thump and or hiccough to an end. Either Q has been weakened in transmission, or F has been improved. Given the example of sit and waile theyr woes , one may set Q by Richard III 4.4.409, TLN 3200: Crie woe, destruction, ruine, and decay, ( Richard II ) Death, Desolation, ruine, and Decay: ( Richard III ) The extent to which Shakespeare was reworking the same ideas is even clearer in the light of the following line in Richard II : 'The worst is death . . .'. The reading F supplies not only strengthens the line, but also varies it where the resemblance with Richard III is most specific. Q drops from the formulaic to the merely repetitive; F does not. It is the variants themselves that pass judgement on Q's repetitions, and suggest that Shakespeare was not satisfied with them. If substantiveness comes in degrees (the word perhaps misleadingly suggests that it does not), there are several other Q/F variants which could be called highly substantive. Some F readings will be rejected: hand for wound (l. 139; TLN 1498) is clearly a Folio compositorial error influenced by Hands in the previous line; at 1399 (l. 43) F describes how the sun 'darts his Lightning through eu'ry guiltie hole', where Q more meaningfully and metrically reads Light ; Beares for beards (l. 112; TLN 1470) is, as suggested above, an annotator's folly, an easy manuscript misreading which produces a line of delightful nonsense ('White Beares haue arm'd their thin and hairelesse Scalps'). Variants such as power/friends (l. 35; TLN 1391) and partie/Faction (l. 203; TLN 1562) require more serious attention. At first sight they could be substitutions in either direction, though not of the commonest kind. But if compositorial substitution accounts for these variants, Q is more likely than F to have introduced them. Q's power and partie share in their neutral attitude. Folio friends is not only the more specific of its pair, but when set beside substance ('in substance and in . . .') it makes a meaningful distinction between material and human resources in a way that power does not. Furthermore, power occurs twice in previous lines (l. 27 and l. 28; TLN 1387 and 1388), whereas friends is nowhere in sight. Faction , too, is more precise and expressive than Q's partie ; as may also have happened at Richard III 3447 (5.3.13), one explanation for the variant would be that manuscript factiō was misread partie , an error plausible in this direction but not in reverse. 45 With 'Is not the Kings name twenty/fourty thousand names?' (l. 85; TLN 1442), it is again F which is less easily explicable as error, for 20000 has already been cited (l. 76; TLN 1433). F's fourty continues the progressive exaggeration begun with 20000 itself; the first figure cited is twelue thousand (l. 70; TLN 1426). The Q compositor might (like modern editors) have corrected fourty as apparently a self-evident error. 'Awake thou coward/sluggard Maiesty thou sleepest' (l. 84; TLN 1441) in isolation is more difficult both to explain and to judge. Q's coward gives the easier antithesis with Maiesty , but cowards are not usually characterised by a propensity to sleep. It will be noticed that the two last-mentioned variants occur in adjacent lines; taken together, they suggest nothing so much as further instances of minor authorial alteration. Certainly the influence of Shakespeare's own hand best explains why so many significantly different variants occur in one scene—or, speaking more precisely of the valid F readings, in the corrected parts of one scene. 46 To reserve final judgement on Shakespeare's responsibility for a variant in a single instance such as 1410 (l. 55) is no contradiction of this view. Q's imperfection there is almost certainly illustrated by unmetrical and redundant off ('Can wash the balme off from an annointed King'); F's removal of the word looks like restoration, not revision or sophistication. Only in the concentration of its attractive F variants is 3.2 unique. Examples of F giving a more specific or harder reading can be readily found elsewhere. Three F readings rejected by editors may be considered together. Tell thou the lamentable tale of me, Tell thou the lamentable fall of me, (5.1.44; TLN 2305) Which then blew bitterly against our faces, Which then grew bitterly against our face, (1.4.7; TLN 582) Shorten my daies thou canst with sullen sorrowe, Shorten my dayes thou canst with sudden sorow, (1.3.227; TLN 520) In each of these lines, Q has a simple, acceptable and uncontroversial reading. One tells a tale, the wind blows, sorrow is sullen. But in each case F gives an unusual idiom which is nevertheless, to say the least, acceptable. Fall at 2305 gets away from a cliché that has already been used three lines above: tell the [i.e. thee ] tales . Richard relates himself to a specific genre of narrative, the Falls of Princes, and in doing so he heightens the extent of his self-dramatization. Grew and sudden both concentrate upon a momentary transformation instead of a state of being; this more dynamically (one might almost again say 'more dramatically') gives rise to the tear, or the death caused by sorrow. At 520, Q's sullen is appropriate to sorrow as received, not as inflicted, whereas F's sudden , though a more unusual epithet for sorrow, is exactly appropriate to acts such as Richard's banishment of Bolingbroke. Other variants have been attributed to the actors, but are much more likely to be authorial. In the line: Coosin, throw vp your gage, do you beginne. (1.1.186; TLN 194) F's variant downe for up probably represents, as Stanley Wells suggested in the New Penguin edition, a change in the envisaged staging. Editors follow F in correcting an historical error at 2802 (5.6.8), but they do not attribute the same authority to the F correction of Woodstockes to Glousters (1.2.1; TLN 218). There is admittedly a significant difference between these Q readings in that one is an error and the other no more than an inconsistency. Elsewhere in Richard II the character is called Gloucester, and Woodstockes is probably a first thought coming early in the play, when the play Woodstock , usually regarded as an antecedent to Richard II , would be still uppermost in Shakespeare's mind. It should probably be regarded as a foul-papers inconsistency which Shakespeare later eliminated. Two transpositions may be set side by side: Q: fourth of that name F: of that Name the Fourth (4.1.112; TLN 2032) Q: do these iusts &amp; triumphs hold? F: Hold those Iusts and Triumphs? (5.2.52; TLN 2421) In 2032, the Q reading is metrically possible in that Henry was, in early Shakespearian usage, occasionally trisyllabic. Apart from this example and one in Richard III , all such instances are found in the Henry VI trilogy. A deliberate revision would therefore remove an outmoded metrical form. At 2421 Q has an acceptable hexameter. F gives a more compact line with a more unusual word order. Whereas a compositor might drop a word to create space—F's line fills the rule—a complete reshaping of the line for this reason is most unlikely, especially as the end of the line could have been turned up or down. The changes do not point to compositorial error in Q in that they are more extreme than one would expect, though this does remain a possible source of error. More likely, this is also an instance of authorial adjustment. The variant at 1538 (3.2. 178), in which Q echoes an earlier line, is not unique. Remarkably similar is: Q: the word it selfe Against the word F: the Faith it selfe Against the Faith (5.5.13-14; TLN 2680-81) Shakespeare used exactly the same words at 2624 (5.3.122) as Q gives here. Although this has been noticed before, it has not been connected with the variant; editors have preferred to imagine that an actor or annotator introduced the F reading on religious grounds (though different views have been advanced as to why Q was found unacceptable). 47 It is more reasonable to suggest, especially in the light of the example of sit and waile theyr woes , that Shakespeare changed his text to avoid repetition. The superiority often attributed to Q's reading must be weighed against the fact that it perpetrates such a repetition, while Faith is certainly defensible on the grounds that it emphasises the supposed meaning of an equivalent word . Unlike Shakespeare, his editors are generously reluctant to find fault with the repetition; they therefore cannot admit that F could supply an authorial improvement. One may compare the laugh/mocke variant at 1759 (3.3.171) with partie/Faction discussed above. In both instances F has the more emotionally precise expression. F's Queene (5.1.78; TLN 2340) is doubly advantageous over Q's wife in that it avoids a repetition from five lines above and encompasses the connotations of pompe as well as the concept of wife : My Queene to France: from whence, set forth in pompe, She came adorned hither like sweet May; When Richard tells Northumberland that The loue of wicked men conuerts to feare, (5.1.66; TLN 2328) his observation is confusing: are the wicked men those like Northumberland, or those like Bolingbroke to whom they are obsequious? Richard intends both: that is, the love between wicked men. This is made clear in F, where men becomes friends . Three substitutions involving units of time in fact vary in the certainty with which they can be identified as authorial alterations. At 162 (1.1.151) Q has: Our doctors say, this is no month to bleede: In F month becomes time . It may be suspected that this again is a deliberate alteration of the text, made to remove the unfortunate suggestion of menstruation that the original line may have been thought to elicit. An apparently similar variant is yeeres/dayes (5.3.21; TLN 2517), but this variant is probably connected with the presence of heere at the end of the following line. Either Shakespeare emended a jingle out of the text, or heere stimulated a compositorial substitution in Q. Another instance may be more safely attributed to compositorial error in Q. Ure recognized that Q gives an illogical sequence in: Shew minutes, times, and hours (5.5.58; TLN 2724) In F the second and third terms are transposed. Or, to express the situation more plausibly, F has the required text and Q contains a compositorial transposition. With raise/reare (4.1.145; TLN 2065) F arguably gives the less usual idiom; it is reassuring to find that the variant ocurs in a carefully annotated area of the text. A similar case is throwne/stricken (5.1.25; TLN 2286). This is not in a corrected area, but F has a more significant advantage in that it completes an irregular nine-syllable line in Q. 48 Another metrical emendation supplied by F is tell me/tell (5.3.1; TLN 2497), where Q's me anticipates my two words later (and is in any case an easy interpolation). In the last two instances we move from F readings which possibly or probably derive from Shakespeare's revising hand to those which are much more likely to preserve an original text which Q has corrupted. The preceding discussion has established or at least suggested the validity of some F readings which editors customarily reject, but there is a persistent difficulty in distinguishing between what must be Shakespeare's second thoughts in F and corruption in Q. Fortunately we have some detailed knowledge of the work and habits of the compositor who set most of the text in Q1: Simmes's Compositor A. Alan Craven has written a series of articles analyzing the types of error this compositor was prone to introduce, and the implications of such habits for an editor. 49 Contrary to the usual assertion that Q gives an accurate and reliable text, Craven observes that Simmes's Compositor A was particularly likely to introduce error that involved a change in wording: in Q2 Richard II , for example, which he set in its entirety, he introduced 63 substitutions and 30 omissions, as against 25 literals errors. Yet when Craven comes to discuss probable compositorial error in Q1 he covers very different ground from the present study. The reason is that Craven's evidence points consistently to the triviality of the compositor's many errors. 'The words thus affected are not usually nouns and verbs, but instead are connectives and qualifiers' ('Five Shakespeare Quartos', p. 56). Although Simmes's Compositor A was prone to substitute, he is unlikely to be responsible for the 'words of nearly equivalent meaning' noted by Ure and discussed above. The only comparable substitutions in the whole of Q2 are speak/said, fall/drop, sparks/sparkles, shock/smoke and slander/slaughter . If these were Q/F variants, it is unlikely that more than one of them would have been mentioned in this article: the first two appear completely indifferent, and the last three are self-evident errors of which the first might have been cited in passing as a metrical corruption. Simmes's Compositor S, who set the remainder of Q1, was 'much more accurate than A', though prone to errors of omission ('Five Shakespeare Quartos', p. 57,n. 9). Yet there are no indications that the variants discussed above are influenced in number or in kind by this compositor. Assuming that the general tenor of the preceding critical comments proves acceptable, few or none of the variants discussed can be attributed to error on the part of the F compositors. But this assertion can be put on a more objective footing by considering the work of the F compositors elsewhere. Richard II was set by Compositors A and B, the latter taking the greater share of the work. Compositor B's efficiency in setting from printed copy has been examined by Paul Werstine, some of whose conclusions can be cited. 50 Although he sometimes substituted 'a more difficult word for the clear reading of his copy', Werstine's two examples— brawles/Broyles ( Romeo and Juliet 91) and beastly/Beastlike ( Titus Andronicus 2703)—are not remotely comparable with the variants in Richard II discussed above. Similarly, when Werstine attributes to Compositor B substitutions of 'words which are orthographically dissimilar to the words of his copy, but similar in meaning to the copy words' he is speaking in relative terms, and his examples again distance Compositor B's work from the distinctive substitutions in Richard II: smirched/smeered ( Much Ado about Nothing 1796), curelesse/endlesse ( Merchant of Venice 2051). These examples are drawn from a much wider body of work than his stints on Richard II . Transpositions prove to be Compositor B's rarest form of error, and interpolations almost as rare. Though he sometimes introduced metrical sophistications, he 'never added half-lines, adjectives, verbs, or expansions to his copy'. His omissions are 'too few to classify'. To summarize, the only discussed variants that Compositor B could normally be thought likely to have introduced are the metrical emendations at 1410 and 2497; Compositor A actually set the latter. Of Compositor A's work set from minimally-annotated printed copy we know less, for the only passage so set outside Richard II itself is just over a single page in Richard III (1569-1735). His work there introduced the following changes: five minor rewordings of stage directions, five obviously necessary corrections of copy error, two metrically-required elisions, and one minor substitution or literal error ( Nor/No at 1581). His propensity to correct on his own initiative is of some interest, but there are no hints here of the kind of substitutions and other alterations found in Richard II . His work setting from manuscript copy suggests that he was more accurate than Compositor B. 51 But 3.2 occurs in Compositor A's stint, with the result that he set more of the variants attributed to annotation than Compositor B, even though A set less than half the text. This returns us to the pattern of annotation. Only 3 (12%) of the variants we have discussed lie outside the corrected areas. These provide the slight sprinkling of exceptions to the pattern that, on the basis of the other information, one would expect. As it has not been felt necessary to exclude such readings from consideration simply because they fall outside the corrected areas, and as the annotation of the surrounding area has not been put forward as a criterion for justifying most of the F readings, the new suggested readings from F lend further weight to the interpretation of the promptbook annotation. Or alternatively, the pattern of correction gives added authority to the advocated F readings. The present discussion does not exhaust the number of F readings which should or might be adopted. The conclusions are twofold and mutually supporting. F is a rich source of readings that are both authoritative and radically different from Q. And even in Richard II , perhaps the most straightforward instance of an F text printed from annotated quarto copy, there are unmistakable indications that Shakespeare himself was responsible for some of these variants. We see clear evidence of the author in the process of making final adjustments to his play.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. Censorship and the Abdication Episode The most important single difference between Q1-3 and F is F's inclusion of the abdication episode, which the texts printed in Elizabeth's reign omit. This has implications for the stage history as well as the textual history of the play. Was the Folio-only passage a later addition —as most critics believe that the 'fly scene', present only in the Folio, was an addition to Titus Andronicus? Or was it always part of the original play, which should have been printed in Q1? Although in other respects the superiority of Q1 over F is now generally accepted, few critics have been satisfied that Q1 here gives Shakespeare's original text intact. The most serious objection lies in Westminster's reference—found in all texts, just after the inserted episode—to A wofull Pageant (4.1.321; TLN 2246). It is difficult to apply this convincingly to any action that has just been staged according to Q1. The most obvious suggestion would be that the Pageant is Bolingbroke's ascent of the throne (4.1.113; TLN 2033). But does this actually happen? Q1-3 indicate only that Carlisle interposes and tries to prevent him. Here one must guard against accidentally using the F text in support of Q1. If we are familiar with the idea that Bolingbroke does ascend the throne, in spite of Carlisle's intervention, it is probably because nothing could be more dramatically effective (and in keeping with the pathos of the scene that follows) than for Richard to enter to find the accomplished fact, Henry on the throne. If Q1 is understood as an unbroken text, the circumstances are very different. Carlisle's intervention and arrest would lead directly into Bolingbroke's abrupt if not angry announcement of his intended coronation, dismissal of the lords, and exit. The potential Q1 text ends on a note of frustration. It would be consistent with this for Carlisle effectively to prevent Bolingbroke from ascending the throne: the scene would seem to require that an effective Pageant should be delayed to a more fitting time. Pageant is not, to judge from other instances, a word used casually by Shakespeare. It suggests something distinct, visual and theatrical: almost a play within a play. It can also imply a representation with allegorical meaning. All these qualities are appropriate to the abdication episode itself, and in particular to Richard's self-conscious and allegorizing mime with the crown and the mirror. Richard deliberately dramatizes, in symbolic form, his own fall. Moreover, it is Richard above all else who is wofull . These rich associations make the Q1 text look like an empty jar waiting to be filled. Q1 thus appears to have omitted a passage; whatever the mechanism of that excision (and several are possible), the motive seems to have been anxiety about the political content of an episode in Shakespeare's foul papers. 52 But the inclusion of the episode in the first Jacobean edition of Richard II , Q4 (1608), both illustrates the acceptability of its printed text after Elizabeth's death and gives evidence that the abdication episode was, eventually at least, played in the theatre in the form F preserves: the title-page of Q4 was reset during the course of printing to read: THE | Tragedie of King | Richard the Second: | With new additions of the Parlia-|ment Sceane, and the deposing | of King Richard, | As it hath been lately acted by the Kinges | Maiesties seruantes, at the Globe. This form of phrasing may or may not imply that the additions were new to the acted text as well as the printed text. Two possibilities immediately suggest themselves: either (a) the Folio abdication episode was politically acceptable in 1608, as it had not been in 1597, or (b) the Folio abdication episode was always politically acceptable, but what stood in the foul papers was not. This second possibility of course assumes that the scene in F is different from what should have been printed in Q1 had there been no issue of censorship in Q1. The lines immediately following the cut in Q1 are significantly different in Q1 and F: Bull . Let it be so, and loe on wednesday next, We solemnly proclaime our Coronation, Lords be ready all. Exeunt . (H2) Bull . On Wednesday next, we solemnly set downe Our Coronation: Lords, prepare your selues. Exeunt . (2244-45) The variants are in themselves a sufficient demonstration that the promptbook was consulted here in preparing F. But the most obviously directed change is Q1's introduction of Let it be so, and loe : if the abdication episode was cut in Q1, the context determines that the part-line cannot have been cut in F. In other words, it is possible that Q1's phrase was introduced to bridge over the gap created by the omission of the abdication episode. But as the other variants in these lines retain the same overall sense, they cannot, like Let it be so, and loe , have been introduced in Q1 specifically to mend the censorship gap; indeed they are of a kind such as has now been established as often indicating authoritative variants resulting from changes introduced in the promptbook. The bridging phrase mends the broken text in a contextually plausible and metrically invisible way; it is reasonable to suppose that blatant but equivalent substitutions would not be introduced at the same time, especially as no perceptible advantage is gained by them. If proclaime/set downe and be ready all/prepare your selues are very similar in kind to other variants introduced in F from the promptbook, they too may be attributable to the revising hand of Shakespeare. As such they are consistent with a known stage in the development of the Folio text. Furthermore, reasons for the introduction of each alteration become evident. In the case of proclaime/set downe , the reading as preserved in Q1 is potentially ambiguous. It hovers between the interpretation 'we (now) proclaim that Wednesday next will be our coronation' and 'on Wednesday next we will proclaim ourselves crowned'. Set downe conveniently avoids this difficulty. In the 1955 New Variorum edition (p. 278), Matthew Black conjectures that be ready all was emended to prepare your selues in order to avoid a repeat of the all/fall rhyme of 2242-43 (ll. 317-318). Black's word 'avoid' suggests that he believes that the all/fall/all chime was never allowed to stand in the text. But if, as he believes, the abdication episode was cut in Q1, and if the substitutions were introduced in the promptbook (as his conjecture presupposes), Shakespeare must have originally written something like this: Rich . Oh good: conuey: Conueyers are you all, That rise thus nimbly by a true Kings fall. Bull . On Wednesday next, we solemnly proclaime Our Coronation: Lords be ready all. Exeunt . The repeated rhyme must, according to the logic of Black's conjecture, have stood in Shakespeare's original text, and it is necessary to suppose that its removal was a later, presumably authorial, change. But is this conflated text likely to be what Shakespeare really wrote? We can see that he apparently revised the lines immediately after Q1's Let it be so, and loe . But we have no direct way of knowing what the text preceding this phrase was originally like, simply because Q1 does not print it. The conflated text rests on a large assumption: that F preserves what Shakespeare first wrote. As has been suggested, this is not necessarily the case. It is in fact decidedly awkward to suppose that the variants just after the abdication episode are unconnected, and that it is mere coincidence that we find two alterations introduced in the promptbook in close proximity to the only significant alteration introduced in Q1. By chance, it seems, the conjectured repeated rhyme in Shakespeare's original text was removed deliberately in the promptbook and also, quite fortuitously, in Q1. One must add to this circumstance the supposition that Shakespeare would write such an obvious but presumably unintended repetition of all in the first place. And, moreover, that he would make another misjudgement in the immediately preceding line. All of these difficulties would disappear if we assumed that the Folio text of the episode represents a text which has undergone—like other parts of the play—at least some verbal revision. If so, then even Let it be so, and loe might be part of Shakespeare's unrevised original, rather than a mere botched transition interpolated by whoever censored the text. We would not claim that any of this reasoning 'proves' that Shakespeare's original version of the abdication scene differed from that present in F: no one can legislate about the the exact content of the passage apparently missing from Q. But that very fact should make us sceptical of the assumption, hitherto almost universal, that F prints (unaltered) what originally appeared in Shakespeare's foul papers. The text cut from Q1 may well have been an earlier version of the episode, sporadically or even fundamentally different from that eventually printed in F. At the least, no one can rule out this possibility. The proposition is lent some support by a detail in the opening direction for 4.1. The Quarto calls vaguely for Bolingbroke to enter '. . . with the Lords to parliament ', but usefully places ' Enter Bagot ' after Bolingbroke's 'Call forth Bagot'; in the Folio, in promptbook fashion, the lords are named, and the direction ends '. . . Abbot of Westminster. Herauld, Officers, and Bagot '. The unexpected addition here is ' Herauld ', for in neither text is a herald required. If the promptbook was originally prepared with a different text for part of the scene, the herald's presence is easily explained. When the substitution took place, the opening direction might not have been emended, leaving evidence of a character who would have spoken in the lost original text, but has no part in the extant version which replaced it. A herald would have an obvious role in a more explicit abdication. His omission in Q is merely typical of the authorial style of its directions: the heralds similarly are absent in Q's directions for 1.3 (Bolingbroke's banishment: a scene loosely parallel with Richard's abdication). Shakespeare's first draft may have been censored, and the text as it stands in F may be a rewritten version which actually avoids political controversy. Such an hypothesis is consistent with the view, sometimes expressed, that nothing in the episode as it stands would arrest the attention of the censor. 53 The Folio version of the episode might well have been used in the earliest performances of the play; but this does not mean it appeared, in its Folio form, in the play's earliest manuscript.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI. Textual History of Richard II If this hypothesis about Q1's omission and F's provision of an abdication episode is correct, then the relationship of the two underlying manuscripts becomes easier to understand. Scholars have generally agreed that Q1 was set from something other than a promptbook; whether the papers were foul or fair, whether autograph or scribal, has been disputed, but there seems little doubt that the manuscript was reasonably clean; Q1 shows no discernible evidence of extensive corruption or sophistication. The simplest assumption, one which at least accords with the available evidence, is that the manuscript was holograph; we may conveniently classify it as 'foul papers', so long as we recognize that some foul papers are much fairer than others. 54 As suggested above, the omission of the original abdication episode from Q1 can be explained as the result of censorship by one or other agent, directly interested in the printing rather than the performing of the text. Long before this manuscript was delivered to the printers, however, a transcript of Shakespeare's foul papers must have been prepared for use in the theatre. Such a transcript might be scribal or authorial; the number of minor verbal variants in F which seem to result from authorial tinkering suggests that Shakespeare at some stage made his own transcript of the foul papers. This autograph fair copy might have been transcribed yet again, or it might simply have been marked up for direct use as the promptbook; the latter is the more economical assumption (though not demonstrably the correct one). This promptbook (whether autograph or scribal) would then have been submitted to the Master of the Revels; he might well have demanded that the original abdication episode be altered. The play was revived in 1601 (at the time of the Essex rebellion) and at some time before 1608 (when Q4 refers to, and apparently acquires its text of the abdication episode from, recent performances). Some time after the publication of Q5 (1615), someone discovered that one page was missing from this manuscript, and patched the gap by transcribing the text of the affected passage from that edition, with some alterations to the stage directions which suggest that a performance was intended. Some time between 1615 and 1622, copy for Jaggard's compositors was prepared by marking up an exemplar of Q3 (1598), by reference to the promptbook. The annotator supplied act and scene divisions; the latter were almost certainly editorial, but the former may have been present in the manuscript. (Certainly, the King's Men were regularly providing act-intervals in performances after c. 1610, so that if a post-1615 revival did occur, the act divisions could have been supplied then.) The annotator also systematically collated stage directions and speech prefixes, transferring promptbook readings to Q3; he collated dialogue variants as well, but performed this function much less systematically. On the most economical assumptions, then, Q1 was set from foul papers, or a transcript of them, censored for printing; F was set from an exemplar of Q3 which had been collated against an autograph promptbook, containing a version of the abdication episode and one short passage transcribed from Q5. 55 The consequence of such a textual history is that the Folio text demands more attention than it is usually accorded. Shakespeare may have revised the abdication scene; certainly, the absence of the episode from Q1 puts the state of the text in Shakespeare's original papers beyond confident recovery. And given that edited texts supply the Folio abdication scene, it would be logical for them to include other Folio readings which also seem to be Shakespeare's minor revisions. The state of innocence would appear to be unattainable. Besides, the Q1 text, though unsullied by the stage, had apparently not, in some of its finer details, reached maturity. Where we can find it, we may prefer to opt for the sprinkled authority of experience.</field>

Alfred Harbage (Pelican, 1969), p. 636. 4 For Compositor A's responsibility for this passage in Richard II , see Charlton Hinman, The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare , 2 vols. (1963), II, 74-79; for the latest investigation of Compositor A's work elsewhere in the Folio, see Gary Taylor, 'The Shrinking Compositor A of the Shakespeare First Folio', SB , 34 (1981), 96-117. The latter also contains a description of the computer concordances from which the evidence of A's quantitative preferences has been compiled; all statements about qualitative preferences are based on manual counts, assuming that Richard III was set from Q3 or Q6 copy, and the rest of A's Richard II stints from Q3. 5 The slight unevenness is caused by the fact that A did not set dl v ; the sample therefore includes all of d2 before the added scene, and material from d2 v and d3 after it. The order of setting was d3, d2 v , d2 (Hinman, II, 76-77). 6 If we extend the limits of the passage from which A was setting from manuscript copy, then we expand the size of the disputed passage and contract the size of the control. In order to rectify this we would need to include TLN 2334-47 in the control. However, these lines contain no anomalies. 7 It also strikes another severe blow at the older hypothesis, that F was set throughout from a copy of Q5—an hypothesis still endorsed, inexplicably, by Kenneth Muir, in his Signet edition of the play (1963), p. 148. If Q5 were Folio copy, there would have been no conceivable reason for resorting to manuscript for this passage. 8 The Quarto Copy for the First Folio of Shakespeare (1971), pp. 116-117. 9 Richard II , ed. Peter Ure, new Arden Shakespeare (1956), p. xxv. 10 One might conjecture that if the annotator's copy of Q3 happened to be defective, he might have patched it with the last two leaves of Q5. But if Q5 was available, why not use it throughout—as the later edition, and one with the abdication episode? The accidentals evidence in any case militates against this conjecture, as does the fact that the clearest links with Q5 are not at the end of the play, or even confined to a single Q5 leaf. 11 Greg, Editorial Problem , p. 15, n. 1; Dover Wilson, Richard II , New Shakespeare (1951), p. 113; Hasker, pp. 56-57; Ure, p. xxv. 12 Professor Bowers now believes that the hypothesis of a marked-up quarto promptbook is too speculative to entertain. Hasker argued that his hypothesis provided a 'much simpler' explanation of the Folio cuts: 'because these passages were scored out of the promptbook which the compositor was using, he likewise left them out of the Folio as a result of a too scrupulous following of copy'; this seemed to Hasker more desirable than supposing that 'the editor, confronted with both a complete text and an abridged one, had chosen to follow the latter' (p. 70). But this second, 'less desirable' assumption must be embraced in the cases of Richard III, Troilus and Cressida , and King Lear (to mention only the most striking examples), and unless one is prepared to argue that all of these were set from quarto-based promptbooks, the argument from omissions carries no weight in Richard II . Moreover, the use of the word 'editor' betrays Hasker's bias: though a modern editor might assume that the fuller text was necessarily more desirable, printers and theatrical producers are well aware that the 'abridged' text often represents the final form of a work. Whether the author himself made the deletions is none of the printer's business. If the collator were told that the manuscript was more authoritative than Q3, he would have had no reason for treating cuts differently from additions or variants. 13 See the Shakespeare Quarto Facsimile Richard II , edited by W. W. Greg and Charlton Hinman (1966), pp. xv-xvi, and Alan Craven, 'Simmes' Compositor A and Five Shakespeare Quartos', SB , 26 (1973), 37-60, especially 57-58. 14 For an extensive discussion of the general issue of 'actors' departures from the text' being incorporated into promptbooks, see Gary Taylor's ' King Lear : The Date and Authorship of the Folio Version', in The Division of the Kingdoms: Shakespeare's Two Versions of 'King Lear ', ed. Taylor and Michael Warren (1983), pp. 405-410. 15 W. W. Greg, The Shakespeare First Folio: Its Bibliographical and Textual History (1955), p. 237. Compare Hasker's assessment: 'although the editorial work of the Folio was in some respects exceedingly good, it was not, however, performed without some degree of carelessness' (p. 58). 16 The variants in the two lines immediately following the abdication episode are so closely tied up with the Folio text of the episode itself that discussion of these is held over; these lines do not figure in any of the statistics given. 17 The more obviously deliberate emendations are introduced by Compositor B. Compositor A is responsible only for 1601, 1706 and 1834. F's emendation at 1706 may, of course, be authoritative: certainly in this instance Q1 is wrong. But Sisson argued plausibly (apart from his failure to account for Q1's missing article) that Q1 is more likely to arise from a misreading of prince and than prince is ( New Readings in Shakespeare , 2 vols. [1956], II, 24). One may suspect an error of composition which was miscorrected in proof. 18 Thomas is the historical name as given in Holinshed's Chronicles . The error arises from graphically similar abbreviations, and was sufficiently easily made for the same error to occur at Henry V 4.1.92. See the note in J. H. Walter's new Arden Henry V (1955). 19 At 964 Q2 and Q3 follow the corrected state of Q1, which is here cited; the compositor originally set At . . . at . The context strongly suggests that the wrong at was corrected: 'my inward soule, / With nothing trembles, at something it grieues, / More then with parting from my Lord the King'. One trembles at something; with agrees with the following line. Most editors adopt the transposition at 1090 ('The hateful commons will'), but this is unlikely, since Will is prominently positioned at the beginning of the line; on the other hand, commoners could easily be displaced by the similar term used just nine lines previously. At 2556, the omission of thy was conjectured by Craven; it emends the metre as well as strengthening the sense. 20 Paul Werstine, in 'Line Division in Shakespeare's Dramatic Verse: An Editorial Problem' ( AEB , forthcoming), argues that mislineation creating 'irregular verse patterns' is characteristic of Compositor A, who set this passage; however, Werstine finds only one other example in Richard II (2022-4), and it also probably began with the compositor's inability to fit the first line ('Sweet . . . Bosome') into his measure. 21 See Shakespeare Quarto Facsimile Richard II , pp. ix-xiii. Hinman does not cite this example, but he attributes to space-shortage both the uncorrected lineation at 1014 and the corrected instance at 1003. 22 As an example of what such unassisted metrical emendation of Q1 might have produced, see Vaughan's insipid conjecture, 'terrible hel [do thou] . . .' 23 Possible complications are that: a) the promptbook may have been unaltered, and the variants introduced in the printing house without authority; b) the promptbook may have been unsystematically altered; c) the variants may originate partly in the promptbook and partly in the printing house. The occurrence of God(s) in clusters in Q may also confuse the issue. 24 On the general issue of Shakespearian cutting, see Taylor's discussions in Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, Modernizing Shakespeare's Spelling, with Three Studies in the Text of 'Henry V' (1979), pp. 155-6; Henry V , Oxford Shakespeare (1982), pp. 312-315; The Division of the Kingdoms , pp. 415-422. 25 In fact the four single lines omitted in F, 1031a, 1404a, 1541a and 2600a, would, if deliberate cuts, conform with the overall pattern of annotation established below: three of the four lie in well-annotated areas of the text. The exception, 1031a, was, with 2600a, set by Compositor B, who rarely omitted full lines when working from printed copy. A profanity is emended in 1031, an alteration which could be associated with a deliberate cut in the following line. 26 Parlee / parle (201) might be regarded as an emendation, a sophistication, or a spelling variant. Editors have treated the variant as substantive; their procedure is followed here. 27 This excludes, as well as the abdication episode and the two lines following, the 53-line passage in 5.5 without independent authority, and F's act and scene headings. 28 One Folio page, c2 v , entirely avoids ' Rich. ' in favour of shorter ' Ric. ' or ' Ri. '. This anomaly is explained by the order of work on F. Compositor B had previously set ' Rich. ' only once (863 on c3 v ), and evidently did not settle on this as his standard form until after setting c2 v . His next page, c3, has ' Ric. ' twice (731, 875) and ' Rich. ' eight times. 29 The unchanged ' King ' prefixes in Folio 1.1 are an inconsistency. The annotator may at first have thought the variant insignificant, or the inconsistency may be that of the playhouse scribe. A late printing-house correction would have been impossible as, after the printing of quire b, on which 1.1 appears, there was a substantial interruption before work was resumed on Richard II ; type for quire b had, by then, already been distributed. 30 According to Wilfred T. Jewkes, plays acted before 1607 in the popular theatres would not have act divisions marked in the promptbook; if such a play was printed after 1616, the act divisions may have been introduced in the course of late theatrical revivals or in the printing house ( Act Division in Elizabethan and Jacobean Plays , 1583-1616 [1958]). G. K. Hunter argues less plausibly that the change of practice took place only in the printing house, and that act pauses were generally observed in the theatre throughout Shakespeare's working lifetime ('Were There Act Pauses on Shakespeare's Stage?', in English Renaissance Drama , edd. Standish Henning, Robert Kimbrough, and Richard Knowles [1976], 15-35). For a reply to Hunter, with an expansion and modification of Jewkes's findings, see Taylor's 'The Structure of Performance: Act Intervals in the London Theatres, 1576-1642' (forthcoming). 31 See S. W. Reid, 'The Editing of Folio Romeo and Juliet ', SB , 35 (1982), 43-66. 32 For the first of these, see Stanley Wells, 'The Copy for the Folio Text of Love's Labour's Lost ', RES 33 (1982), 137-147. 33 For a detailed analysis of such rhythms in one text, see MacD. P. Jackson's 'Fluctuating Variation: Author, Annotator, or Actor?' in Taylor and Warren, The Division of the Kingdoms , 313-349. 34 Joseph Moxon, Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing (1683-84), edd. Herbert Davies and Harry Carter (1962), pp. 228-229 (marginal notes). Proof-correction was also carried out in stages: 'Having Read the Matter of the Proof he examines again if the Form be right Impos'd , for though he before turn'd the Pages in the Proof as he read them according to their orderly places, yet he will scarce trust to that alone, but again examines them on purpose, and distinctly . . . [new paragraph] He examines that all the Signatures are right, and all the Titles and Folio's ' (pp. 249-250). For the pertinence to Jacobean printing of Moxon's remarks on proof-correction, see Peter W. M. Blayney, The Texts of 'King Lear' and their Origins , Vol. I: Nicholas Okes and the First Quarto (1982), 188-218. (It is of course still true that collation—of which proofreading is a subdivision—is often most economically and accurately carried out by stages.) 35 One possible explanation for this pattern has recently been offered by Paul Werstine, in 'Folio Compositors, Folio Editors, and Folio King Lear ', in Taylor and Warren, The Division of the Kingdoms , pp. 248-260. From our own work on I Henry IV for the Oxford Shakespeare we agree with Werstine that many dialogue variants cannot be, as A. R. Humphreys suggested in the new Arden edition (1960), pp. lxxiv-v, the work of the compositors (though we do not agree with Werstine's overall hypothesis). We arrived at a conclusion similar to the one S. W. Reid independently reached in an unpublished article: that a manuscript must have been consulted and readings from it annotated on to the copy for F. 36 This reconstruction assumes that Henry V was set from manuscript copy, rather than a heavily-corrected quarto: see Taylor, Modernizing Shakespeare's Spelling , 41-71. 37 For new evidence that Hamlet and Othello were set from manuscript copy, see Taylor, 'The Folio Copy for Hamlet , King Lear , and Othello ', Shakespeare Quarterly 34 (1983), 44-61. This article also provides new evidence that Folio Lear was set, in part at least, from Q2. T. H. Howard-Hill's 'The Problem of Manuscript Copy for Folio King Lear ', in The Library , VI, 4 (1982), 1-24, argues that a transcript of Q2 was made, incorporating promptbook readings; we find this implausible, but it would not affect our argument here, since some combination of Q2 and an authoritative manuscript clearly underlies F. 38 See The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon , gen. ed. Fredson Bowers (Cambridge), I (1966), xxvii-xxxv. The only text possibly set from a marked-up print is The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn ; but see Bowers's textual introduction (I, 113-123). 39 Ben Jonson, Works , ed. C. H. Herford, Percy and Evelyn Simpson, IX (1950), 13-73. 40 See Gary Taylor, Toward a Text of Shakespeare's 'Richard III' (forthcoming). 41 If this explanation is correct, then problems of copyright account for four of the five Folio texts set from extensively-annotated quarto copy. The fifth is King Lear . The right to this was owned by Nathaniel Butter—the only play in the collection to which he could lay claim. He was not a part of the syndicate. Aspley and Smethwick (who were) owned Romeo, Love's Labour's , and Much Ado ; Titus and Dream were derelict (Greg, First Folio , 61-9); all five plays were reprinted with minimal alteration. 42 This might explain why the Folio text of Richard II (like others set from quarto copy) contains some readings which look like miscorrections of quarto errors (see above, 'Compounded Error'). These might suggest that the manuscript, which had clearly been consulted at some stage in the preparation of F, was not readily available when the compositors noticed these errors in the print. However, press-variants in the Folio, and many other works of this period, clearly demonstrate that Jacobean printers often preferred to correct on their own initiative, even when a manuscript was clearly on hand somewhere in the shop. 43 Unless, of course, Jaggard merely faked variants. But the character of the variants themselves argues against this; so does the fact that the syndicate was apparently willing, at first, to abandon Troilus altogether when they ran into copyright difficulties, and only retrieved it, at the last minute, when a manuscript had clearly become available. 44 At 1502, Q1 has I , Q2 Ye , and Q3-F Yea . ( Ye is a spelling variant of yea .) It is possible that the annotator regarded I/Yea as indifferent. 45 For the rather unusual p/f misreading, compare Q2 Hamlet 5.2.9, TLN 3508 (uncorrected 'pall', corrected 'fall'). Peter W. M. Blayney has pointed out to us that the same misreading is possible in Hand D of Sir Thomas More . 46 If we admit 1502-30 to be an uncorrected area, it still remains true that the readings fall in corrected areas. 47 Clarendon (1869) suggested that the substitution in F was 'to avoid the imputation of profanity'; Chambers (1891), on the other hand, considered that perhaps 'someone who objected to the Puritan habit of looking to the words rather than the spirit of the Scriptures' made the alteration. 48 In the New Cambridge edition (1951), Dover Wilson prints throwen in the belief that such a spelling indicates a disyllabic pronunciation. Ure is rightly sceptical about the validity of this assumption. 49 'Simmes' Compositor A and Five Shakespeare Quartos' (cited above); 'The Reliability of Simmes's Compositor A', SB , 32 (1979), 186-91; 'Compositor Analysis to Edited Text: Some Suggested Readings in Richard II and Much Ado About Nothing ', PBSA , 17 (1982), 43-62. 50 'Folio Editors, Folio Compositors, and Folio King Lear ', pp. 261-73. The usual quantities of compositorial error can be accounted for by variants in the corrected areas other than those discussed above. 51 This conclusion is based upon Gary Taylor's unpublished survey of unanimously-rejected readings in plays which A or B set from manuscript, or heavily-annotated, copy. 52 Possible agents for the excision are: (a) the actors, taking the easiest means to ensure that an offensive passage was not printed; (b) the Bishop of London, who censored books independently of the theatrical censorship exercised by the Master of the Revels; (c) the printer or publisher, taking his own preventative measures. The latter is not as improbable as it may at first appear: G. K. Hunter demonstrated in his Revels edition of The Malcontent (1957) that Simmes or his publisher must have cut potentially offending lines in that play on his own initiative (pp. xxviii-xxxi). 53 'Political conditions at the end of the sixteenth century had made any suggestion of the dethroning of a monarch dangerous. Most literary historians believe that the passage was excised for this reason, though Richard technically abdicates and the lines actually enlist sympathy on his side' (Hasker, p. 48). 54 As MacD. P. Jackson points out, Richard II differs from all the other 'good' quartos except Titus in preferring 'Oh' (28) to 'O' (8). See Studies in Attribution: Middleton and Shakespeare (1979), p. 215. The evidence of 'Oh' in Richard II thus suggests that copy for Q Richard II may have been a transcript, rather than foul papers. The exceptional clearness of the text would support this. 55 If the King's Men were unwilling to allow the promptbook out of the theatre, then the Folio text of the abdication episode must have been set from a transcript of that portion of the promptbook.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Shakespeare and the Geneva Bible: Hamlet , I.iii.54 by Naseeb Shaheen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his list of biblical references in Shakespeare's plays, Thomas Carter gives three sources or verbal parallels in the Geneva Bible for Polonius' words, "A double blessing is a double grace" ( Hamlet , I.iii.54). "The words 'double grace' and 'double blessing' occur in the Geneva Bible in very interesting connections," Carter says, and quotes the Geneva Bible at Ecclesiasticus 26.15, "A shamefast and faithfull woman is a double grace." He then gives two additional examples from the Geneva notes, note "c" on Isaiah 40.2 and note "f" on Isaiah 40.3: In Isa. xl. 2 a Genevan Note on the verse says—"Sufficient or double grace whereas she deserved double punishment;" and again [at Isa. 40.3]—"This was fully accomplished when John the Baptist brought tidings of Jesus Christe's comming, who was the true deliverer of His Church from sinne and Satan; hence this double blessing of the Forerunner and the Messiah announced the sufficient or double grace of the forgiveness of God ." 1 (Italics added.) Carter's claim is important for at least two reasons. First of all, if he is correct, then in the note on Isaiah 40.3 we have one of Shakespeare's clearest references to a Geneva note or gloss. Shakespeare frequently refers to the text of the Geneva Bible; at times these references plainly indicate that he had only the Geneva Bible in mind and no other version. But to demonstrate that Shakespeare echoes a Geneva note or gloss as clearly as Carter asserts he does in this instance, is quite another matter. Convincing evidence that Shakespeare was influenced by the many notes in the margins of the Geneva Bible is practically nil. Carter's claim is important for another reason. The average scholar will be unable to find the italicized portion of note "f" on Isa. 40.3 in his Geneva Bible, and will probably conclude that Carter's reading must be taken from a different edition. If it is true that certain editions of the Geneva Bible contain that note as Carter presents it, there would be some basis for arguing that a certain edition of the Geneva Bible, or one of several editions with that textual variant, may have been the edition that Shakespeare possessed and read. To be able to identify an edition of the Geneva Bible that Shakespeare used would be an important milestone in the study of Shakespeare's use of the Bible. Shakespeare's biblical references should then be compared not with any edition of the Geneva Bible, but only with the edition or editions which contain this marginal note, and which might contain other textual variants that are reflected in Shakespeare's plays. The problem with Carter's claim is that the crucial part of the note on Isa. 40.3, the part in italics, does not appear in any edition of the Geneva Bible. The expression "double grace" does appear in the Geneva Bible in the two places that Carter points out, Ecclus. 26.15 and note "c" of Isa. 40.2. But only the first part of note "f" on Isa. 40.3 appears as Carter quotes it. The latter part, which contains both the expressions "double blessing" and "double grace" that are parallel to Polonius' words, is nowhere to be found. Carter asserts that he used the 1598 edition of the Geneva Bible for the Old Testament, and the 1557 edition of the Geneva for the New (Whittingham's New Testament). Only two editions of the Geneva appeared in 1598 ( STC 2171, 2172), and the note as Carter quotes it appears in neither of them. 2 Nor does that note appear in any of the spuriously-dated "1599" editions of the Geneva Bible ( STC 2174-2180 a ). Most of these Geneva Bibles were actually published after 1599 on the Continent, most likely in Amsterdam and Dort, although their title pages declare them to have been published in London in 1599. The only authentic 1599 Geneva is STC 2173, but it, too, lacks that note. Moreover, in an attempt to find the edition of the Geneva Bible that Shakespeare might have used, I checked every edition of the complete Geneva Bible and every Geneva Old Testament in the library of the British and Foreign Bible Society in London. Its collection includes almost all editions of the Geneva Bible that were ever published from 1560, when the first edition appeared ( STC 2093), till 1644, when the last 17th-century edition of the Geneva Bible was printed (Wing B 2206). Not one of them contains the portion of the note at Isaiah 40.3 that Carter claims Shakespeare refers to in Hamlet . 3 I have also considered the possibility that Carter might have combined or confused two separate glosses in the Geneva Bible in the note in question, and then failed to cite his source for the second part of the gloss. But a search for the italicized portion of the note elsewhere in the Geneva Bible has failed to turn it up. Carter places both portions of that note within the same quotation marks. Related as both halves are in thought and content, and connected by "hence," they were clearly intended to be understood as a single unit. Thus, we are not dealing with an edition or editions that have an important textual variant. Rather, we are confronted with a situation in which not a single edition of the Geneva Bible contains that portion of the note at Isaiah 40.3 on which Polonius' words are supposedly based. It simply does not seem to exist.</field>

The Council of the Bibliographical Society (London) graciously sent me pre-publication proofs of the entire section on Bibles in the forthcoming revised Short-Title Catalogue , and the revised STC likewise lists only two editions of the Geneva Bible published in 1598. 3 Geneva Bibles published after Hamlet was written were checked to make sure that Carter was not using one of those later editions.

      <field name="heading_text">Nicholas Ling, Publisher 1580-1607 by Gerald D. Johnson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Stationers' Register on 19 November 1607 records the assignment to John Smethwick of sixteen copyrights "Whiche dyd belonge to Nichas Lynge." 1 Among these were three of the plays of Shakespeare: "a booke called Hamlett," "Romeo and Julett," and "Loves labour Lost," and a "possible Shakespeare play: "the taminge of A [not "the"] Shrew." Other items in the list are also easily recognized as important works of the period. For example, "Mr Draytons poemes," for which Smethwick paid a single title fee, actually comprised eleven titles, or almost all of Drayton's work to that date. There are three works by Robert Greene: "Arcadia" (or "Menaphon"), "neuer to Late", and "Tullies loue"; Lodge's "Euphues golden legacie" ("Rosalynde"); Nashe's "Piers Pennyles"; and Anthony Munday's "Englishe Roman Lyfe." Many of the titles in this list had gone through several editions prior to 1607, and they would generally continue to be popular, judging by the frequency with which Smethwick republished them. Other than significance and popularity, however, what is remarkable about these works is the manner in which Ling came to possess most of the copyrights. Only a few of the titles, "Wyttes common wealth," "figure of foure," and some of the Drayton poems, were originally entered in the Registers and published by Ling alone. Most of them were copies which he entered jointly or copies which he came to control through recorded or unrecorded assignment from other stationers. Tracing the publication history of these titles reveals a habit or practice in Ling's work as a publisher which may be seen in the majority of his work. While he did enter and publish (or publish without entrance) a number of titles alone, he also benefited largely from other stationers who located copy and brought it to him for help in publishing the editions. Or, similarly, he bought or assumed copyrights that had been entered by and in some cases published by other stationers. Four of the titles in the assignment to Smethwick were assigned to Ling only some eleven months previously. On 22 January 1607, he entered Sir Thomas Smith's The Commonwealth of England "by Direccon of A Court, and by bergaine and assignement of master Seton vnder his hand wrytinge datum 16 octobris 1606" (Arber iii. 337). Seton had entered the English version of this title in 1584 (Arber ii. 429) and had published five editions prior to 1607 (STC 22857-61). Also on the same day, Ling entered the three Shakespeare plays by assignment from Cuthbert Burby "vnder his handwrytinge." In other instances no such assignment is recorded. Greene's "Arcadia" was originally entered by Sampson Clerke in 1589 (Arber ii. 529) and published by him in that year (STC 12272). Ten years later, however, Ling brought out an edition, and he republished the work again in 1605 (STC 12273 and 12273.5). Greene's "Tullies loue" had been assigned to John Busby in 1595 (Arber iii. 51). He published an edition in 1597 (STC 12225), and Ling published editions in 1601 and 1605. The other Greene title, "neuer to Late," which was not entered, was published by Ling and Busby in 1590 (STC 12253), after which Ling published editions in 1600, 1602, and 1607. These two also entered "Euphues golden legacie" in 1590 (Arber ii. 564). It was published in four editions for Busby and Thomas Gubbin, or for Ling and Gubbin, in 1590-1598 before Ling assumed control of the copyright in 1604 (STC 16668). Nashe's "Piers Pennyles" also came to Ling by Busby. This title had been entered in 1592 by Richard Jones (Arber ii. 619), who published the first edition. Busby then published three editions in 1592-1593, and Ling one in 1595 (STC 18375). "Three sermons of mr. Smyth" refers to the collection published by Ling in four editions 1599-1607 (STC 22735 et seq. ); however Ling had entered only one of these, "The Affinitie of the Faithfull," in 1591 (Arber ii. 594). It was printed for him and Busby (STC 22656). Another of these sermons, "The Benefit of Contention," had not been entered but had been printed several times by Roger Ward and Abell Jeffes (STC 22693 et seq. ). The third, "The Lost Sheep Is Found," had been entered by John Oxenbridge in 1598 (Arber iii. 103) but evidently not printed. Another title in the list, "Reformation of Couetousnesse," was entered to Thomas Bushell, a former apprentice of Ling's, on 23 November 1602 (Arber iii. 222). But it was printed for Ling and John Newbery in 1603 (STC 19735.6). Munday's "Englishe Roman Lyfe" was entered by John Charlewood and Ling in 1582 (Arber ii. 413) and printed by Charlewood for Ling in that year and again in 1590 (STC 18272 and 18273). Hamlet , of course, was entered to James Roberts on 26 July 1602, though Ling and John Trundle published the first edition in 1603, and Ling published the second, printed by Roberts, the following year ( BEPD , p. 18 and #197). The Drayton copyrights are a bit more difficult to sort out. "Mr Draytons poemes" in the assignment was probably meant to refer to the collection of six titles published by Ling in 1605 (STC 7216). This included "The Barrons Wars," a revised version of "Mortimeriados," which Matthew Lownes entered in 1596 (Arber iii. 63). It was published by him and his brother Humphrey in two issues in that year (STC 7207 and 7208). The Lownes's then assigned the title to Ling in 1602 (Arber iii. 218). Ling had entered and published three of the other titles: "Englands Heroicall Epistles," registered in 1597 (Arber iii. 92), and published in five editions prior to 1607 (STC 7193 et seq. ); "Idea," entered in 1594 (Arber ii. 651), with one edition that year (STC 7203); and "Robert Duke of Normandy," entered in 1596 (Arber iii. 74), and published once in that year (STC 7332). The other two titles, "Matilda" and "Peirs Gaveston," were originally published by Ling and Busby. They entered "Peirs" in 1593 (Arber ii. 641) and published it probably in the next year (STC 7214). "Matilda," not entered, was printed for them in 1594 (STC 7205 and 7206). (These two works were also reprinted in the 1596 Robert Duke of Normandy .) Smethwick republished this collection four times in the decade following the assignment. His 1619 edition, however, added five titles to the above. Three of these formed the collection Poemes Lyrick and Pastorall , entered by John Flasket in 1606 (Arber iii. 320) and published by him and Ling probably in that year (STC 7217). These works were "Odes" and "Eglogues" and "The Man in the Moon," a revised version of Endimion and Phoebe which John Busby had entered and published in 1595 (Arber ii. 296, STC 7192). Another title added to the 1619 collection was "The Owle," entered by Edward White and Ling in 1604 (Arber iii. 252) and published by them in several editions in that year (STC 7211 et seq. ). Ling had had no obvious connection with the other added title, "Great Cromwell." It was entered by John Flasket in 1607 (Arber iii. 360), printed by Felix Kingston to be sold by Flasket in that year (STC 7204) and re-issued with a cancel title-page (Kingston for William Welby) in 1609 (STC 7201). 2 Thus Ling had acquired most of the copyrights in the list assigned to Smethwick through indirect, though probably not surreptitious, means. For example, Ling's claim to the Busby titles probably was based on the business arrangement between the two during their collaboration (see below). Nor, as this essay will show, does this practice appear only in the titles represented in this assignment. Of sixty-six titles with which he was involved in his career (including "figure of four," "a spiders webbe," and the "Iewe of Malta," for which no copies are extant), he entered and published only sixteen alone; another nine were published by him without entrance. On the other hand, he entered seven titles with other stationers, published editions of eighteen titles which had been entered to another stationer, and was assigned five copyrights. Thus the majority of the titles in which Ling was concerned throughout his career shows that he favored this way of working. A sound capital base was obviously necessary in order to conduct Ling's type of business. The successive reprints of a number of the titles described above shows that he invested wisely. But it also appears that he had money behind him from near the beginning of his career. He was the son of a well-to-do Norwich parchment maker, John Ling, who owned property in several parishes of that city. 3 Nicholas, the third son of the family, was baptised there in the Parish of St. Simon and Jude on 4 April 1553 (Norwich Central Library). At the age of seventeen, he went to London to learn the book-trade, being indentured to Henry Bynneman, a well-known printer, on 29 September 1570 (Arber i. 434). He was admitted to the freedom of the Company some nine years later, on 19 January 1579 (Arber ii. 679). After publishing a few books in London to 1585, Ling returned to Norwich, where on 7 August 1585 he was admitted per patrimonium to the freedom of that city as a stationer. 4 On 6 December of that year he set over his two London apprentices to other stationers (Arber ii. 137). Like his fellow citizens and stationers, Robert Scott and Nicholas Colman, Ling probably ordered his wares from London wholesalers. 5 Unlike Colman, however, there is no record that Ling published any titles in Norwich (for Colman's publications in Norwich, see the imprints in STC 6564 and 23259). Ling evidently remained in Norwich for the next five years. His name reappears in the London Registers on 6 October 1590 when he and John Busby entered Lodge's Rosalynde . John Ling's will, recorded on 29 November 1590, leaves to him a "tenement in Pockthorpe . . . now in the possession of the saide Nicholas." (608, Flack, Norwich Central Library). Thus Ling may not have re-established his London business until a few months later. On 1 February 1591, however, he registered the indenture of an apprentice, Thomas Bushell, a Norwich native whom Ling may have brought with him from there (Arber ii. 173). Ling probably used the legacy from his father as the financial basis of his London business. By 1594 he had bought a share in the Day and Seres privileges, the foundation of the English Stock. On 15 May 1598 he was elected to the livery, 6 and in 1603 he served as Renter Warden. However, Ling was evidently not interested in rising to a position of importance in the governance of the Company. He declined to serve out his term as Renter Warden, for which refusal he was fined ten pounds and ordered to prison on 3 September 1604. 7 As Cyprian Blagden establishes, the normal route, or "narrow defile," through which a stationer rose to an influential position in the Company was early election to the livery, service in the rentership, and thence election to the wardenship and Court of Assistants ( The Stationers' Company , pp. 85-86). For some reason, perhaps because he found the task onerous and his own business sufficiently lucrative and satisfying or because of his age (he was fifty in 1603), Ling backed away from the possibility of advancement into the governing body of the Company. In fact, he lived for only four more years. The Parish Register of St. Dunstan's-in-the-West records the burial of "Nicholas Lynge Stationer" on 9 April 1607 (Guildhall Library, Ms. 10,342). He was accorded a burial place inside the church (Guildhall Library, Ms. 2968/1, fol. 530r). He evidently left no will 8 and may have died suddenly. His widow had to present an apprentice, John Helme, the following month (Jackson, Records of the Court , p. 440). And Ling had been dead some seven months when the assignment to Smethwick was recorded. Ling's career was evidently boosted at the start by his master, Henry Bynneman. On 8 April 1580 (Arber ii. 368), Bynneman entered Thomas Churchyard's A Warning for the Wise , a report on the earthquake on 6 April of that year with a monitory poem by Richard Tarlton at the end. The colophon indicates that it was printed by John Allde to be sold by Ling "at the West doore of Paules Church" (STC 5259). This may refer to the shop that Bynneman had leased from Richard Smith in 1574. And, two years later, the imprint of the first edition of Munday's The English Romayne Lyfe (STC 18272), which John Charlewood and Ling had entered on 21 June 1582 (Arber ii. 413) indicates that Ling is "dwelling in Paules Church-yarde, at the signe of the Maremaide. Anno. 1582." This address may refer to yet another shop leased by Bynneman, which Ling was occupying in 1583. 9 The Mermaid, which also appears on Bynneman's devices (McKerrow #149 and #155), was the shop sign used by Bynneman in Knightrider Street (see imprints of STC 11985, 205, and 11986). Ling maintained a shop or shops in the vicinity of the west end of Paul's into 1600 (see below). Ling's publications during 1580-85, before his return to Norwich, were oriented towards religious subjects. These included a translation of one of Calvin's commentaries on the Bible, a book of advice on the raising of children, three collections of sermons by the Puritan minister John Udall, and a single sheet folio of visitation articles. 10 In the Udall sermons, Ling worked with Thomas Man and William Broome. Since none of the reprints of the Udall sermons includes Ling's name in the imprints, he may have sold or granted his share in these copyrights to his associates when he left London. It was not until he re-established his London business that Ling began to publish the literary titles that characterize the rest of his career. During 1590-95, he worked closely with John Busby, whose habits as a publisher suggest that he was mainly a procurer of copy. 11 As described above, Ling and Busby produced several popular works during these years. Lodge's Rosalynde, Greenes Never Too Late , Nashe's Pierce Pennilesse , Henry Smith's Affinitie of the Faithfull , and the early Drayton works were all reprinted several times. 12 Two other Lodge works, The . . . Life of Robert Second Duke of Normandy (not entered, published 1591 [STC 16657]) and Euphues Shadow (entered by them in 1592 and published that year [Arber ii. 604, STC 16656]) were evidently not reprinted. The edition of a third work probably by Lodge, "a spiders webbe," has not survived. The anonymous sonnet sequence Zepheria , which they published without entrance in 1594 (STC 26124), was also apparently not reprinted. Another exception to this run of popular books was Thomas Kyd's translation of the Robert Garnier play Cornelie ( BEPD #116). It was entered by Ling and Busby in 1594 ( BEPD , p. 10) and published by them in that year. Ling, however, re-issued the sheets the following year with a more elaborate title-page, probably in the hope of quickening sales. 13 It is obvious, however, that the collaboration between Ling and Busby resulted in a number of lucrative copyrights. How they shared the profits of these ventures is impossible to know, but the fact that all of the imprints which denote a place of sale give Ling's address at the West Door or West End of St. Paul's (see imprints in STC 7214, 16656, and 16657) and that Ling eventually controlled the titles that were reprinted, strongly suggests that he was the dominant partner. He probably financed the printing and sales of the editions with Busby providing most of the copy. The successive reprintings of these titles must have helped to keep Ling's business solvent until the end of his career. In the years following his collaboration with Busby, Ling continued his interests in literary and religious publications, and he became involved in the publishing (and probably editing) of a group of anthologies of verse and collections of "wise sayings." In these, outside of the titles that he entered alone, he worked with several other stationers, with no apparent favorite (though Cuthbert Burby's name does appear in several instances). Some of the literary publications are still of interest. In 1596, Ling entered and published Sir John Davies' Orchestra, Or a Poeme of Dauncing (Arber iii. 74, STC 6360); this title, however, had also been entered by John Harrison in 1594 (Arber ii. 655). Ling's entry does not state that his claim was based upon an assignment. In 1599, Ling and Burby brought out a work by Nashe, Nashes Lenten Stuff , which was entered by Burby in that year (Arber iii. 134, STC 18370). Ling published two works by Nicholas Breton: Wits Trenchmour , not entered, in 1597 (STC 3713); and The Strange Fortune of Two Excellent Princes , entered by him in 1600 and printed that year (Arber iii. 160, STC 3702). He entered and published Edward Guilpin's satire Skialetheria (Arber iii. 126, STC 12504) in 1598, one of the satirical works "burnte in the hall" in June 1599 (Arber iii. 677-8). He published Thomas Moffett's verse The Silkewormes, and Their Flies without entrance in 1599 (STC 17994). In 1600 he registered and published Christopher Middleton's verse Legend of Humphrey Duke of Glocester (Arber iii. 160, STC 17868). Also in 1600, he published an edition of Jonson's Every Man Out of His Humour , which William Holme had entered and published in two editions of the same year. 14 In 1603 Ling was evidently involved in publishing several editions of Thomas Dekker's The Wonderfull Yeare despite being fined along with Smethwick and John Brown for printing the work "without Aucthoritie or entrance" and ordered to bring the books into the Hall. 15 Also in 1603, Ling and Edward White published without registration Lodge's A Treatise of the Plague (STC 16676). In 1606, Ling sold Peele's The Tale of Troy (STC 19546.5) for Arnold Hatfield, according to the imprint. The title was not entered. In 1600 and 1606 he published works associated with his hometown. He entered William Kemp's Kemps Nine Daies Wonder , a report of Kemp's morris dance from London to Norwich, in 1600 (Arber iii. 160, STC 14923). In 1606 he published without entrance a translation from Erasmus by William Burton, who had preached in Norwich in the 1580's (STC 10457, two issues; reprinted by Smethwick in 1624). The religious works show a similar pattern of publication. In 1596, he and Simon Waterson brought out the fifth edition of Henry Bull's Christian Prayers and Holy Meditations (STC 4032). This work had been assigned to Robert Robinson, who printed the edition, in 1588. (Arber ii. 510) Ling also published three titles by Samuel Gardiner: Portraiture of the Prodigal Sonne (STC 11579) he entered himself in 1598 (Arber iii. 132); The Cognizance of a True Christian (STC 11573) was entered to Thomas Creede in 1597 upon the condition that Creede would print the copy for Ling (Arber iii. 92); and Domesday Booke (STC 11576) was registered by Edward White in 1605 (Arber iii. 280). Similarly, in 1606 Ling published an edition of a sermon by William Smyth, The Black-Smith (STC 22881.5), which Martin Clerke had entered in that year (Arber iii. 320) and published in two editions. In that year as well, Ling entered and published another work by William Burton, An Abstract of the Doctrine of the Sabbaoth (Arber iii. 312, STC 4165a.5). Finally, in 1607 he published a translation from Phillippe des Portes, Rodomonths Infernall, or the Diuell Conquered (STC 6785). He had entered this title some nine years earlier, in 1598 (Arber iii. 126). Towards the end of the century, Ling played a major part in the publication of the series of collections of "wise sayings" or "sentences" known as "Wits Commonwealth." In 1597 he entered and published the first of these, Politeuphuia (Arber iii. 93, STC 15685). Another issue of the first edition and two further editions appeared in 1598. The work continued to be popular in the seventeenth century: Smethwick published an additional nine editions through circa 1640, and the text resurfaced under a new title in 1770. 16 Other works in this series were Palladis Tamia (STC 17834), published by Burby in 1598; Wits Theater (STC 381), published by Ling in 1599; 17 and Palladis Palatium (STC 26014), published by Francis Burton in 1604. In recent years Ling has been credited with editing some of these collections, including the anthology of verse England's Helicon . 18 It is obvious that he found such collections attractive. In 1600 he, Burby, and Thomas Hayes (or Heyes) entered and published several issues of Englands Parnasus (Arber iii. 173, STC 378 et seq. ). Also in that year, Ling registered and brought out The Harmonie of the Holy Scriptures. With the seuerall sentences of sundry learned writers (Arber iii. 156, STC 1891.5), a collection by James Bentley. Another related title is Leonard Wright's A Display of Dutie, dect with sage sayings, pythie sentences, and proper similies . This title, however, was entered by John Wolfe in 1589 (Arber ii. 531) and printed by him in that year (STC 26025). On 7 December 1601 the title was assigned to Edward Aggas from "John wolf deceased" (Arber iii. 196). But Ling published an edition in 1602 (STC 26026). All of the collections of sayings are similarly arranged. The quotations from classical authors, church fathers, the Bible, and, in some, from contemporary authors, are placed under subject headings such as "Of God," "Of Heauen," "Peace," "Truth," etc. There is a table of subjects at the end, keyed to page numbers. The result, as The Pforzheimer Library Catalogue (pp. 826-827) points out, is something like a Bartlett's Familiar Quotations and was probably ably useful in the same way. Establishing that Ling often in his career financed the publication of copy that had been procured by other stationers is interesting for the light that this practice throws on the publication of Hamlet . Thus it becomes more likely than a mere guess that John Trundle provided the copy for the first quarto. 19 And the fact that Trundle had no further interest in the title probably reflects the agreement between the two that Ling, as usual, would claim the copyright. It is still not clear why Ling's publication of the first quarto evidently did not conflict with the entry to James Roberts. However, as has often been noticed, Roberts was Ling's favorite printer. Twenty-three editions published by Ling came from Roberts' press. Thus the two of them may have reached a private agreement in the case of Hamlet . If Roberts had a better manuscript in hand or had access to one, both could hope to profit from the publication of a new edition that could correctly be advertised as "enlarged to almost as much againe as it was, according to the true and perfect Coppie." That Ling made such arrangements with printers seems likely in at least one instance. He probably financed the printing of Gardiner's Cognizance of a True Christian , which Thomas Creede entered with the proviso: "This copie to be alwaies printed for Nicholas Linge by the seid Thomas Creede as often as it shalbe printed" (Arber iii. 92). And there may have been unrecorded agreements between Ling and other printers. John Weever's An Agnus Dei , for example, was not registered but was printed three times by Valentine Simmes for Ling (1601, 1603, and 1606; STC 25220 et seq. ). Though it was not among the titles assigned to Smethwick, he republished it in 1610. In the following year, however, the Registers record an assignment of the title from Simmes to Smethwick as "A copy of the sayd Valentynes" (Arber iii. 452). Simmes may have based his claim upon the fact that he had printed the earlier editions, but he may also have been able to show, Ling being dead, that he had some rights to the copy due to the terms of the original publication. While Ling, for one reason or another, declined his chance to advance into the governing body of the Stationers' Company, his practices indicate that he profited from the advantages of the position of capitalist publisher. During his career, the economic control of the book-trade was shifting from the printer-publishers to men like Ling who had money to invest and who used the skills of the printers and manuscript procurers to advance their own economic welfare (Blagden, pp. 89-90). It is impossible to know whether Ling recognized the advantages that such a position might offer and made a decision at the outset to become a publisher though he served his apprenticeship with a printer. His father's trade may have influenced his choice. But it is interesting to contrast Ling's career with those of his fellow apprentices Abel Jeffes and Valentine Simmes, both of whom struggled as printer-publishers. Ling was of course lucky to have money behind him, but he also had the ability to recognize potential best-sellers and invest in them. While it would be going too far to say that he was a publisher in the modern sense of the term, his career does point in the direction in which the book-trade was to evolve.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ling's Shops As described above, Ling sold editions at the West Door of St. Paul's and in St. Paul's Churchyard at the sign of the Mermaid during the first years of his career. Upon his return to London in 1590, he sold one edition (STC 18273) in St. Paul's Churchyard. Then he returned to the west end of Paul's, where he continued to sell editions into 1600. It is not clear how many shops he maintained in this vicinity. Imprints from editions of the 1590's locate him either at the West Door (STC 16657, 1591; STC 7214, 1594; STC 22971, 1595; STC 7232 and 22972, 1596), the West End (STC 18370 and 22664, 1591; and STC 17994, 1599), the Little West Door (STC 12504, 1598), or the Northwest Door (STC 18375, 1595). While some of these may be variations of one address, it does appear that more than one shop is involved. The Northwest Door apparently refers to a distinct shop, perhaps the one that Bynneman had maintained in the 1570's (see imprints in STC 6901 and STC 13602, 1572; and STC 15541, 1573.) 20 Unless several stationers were sharing premises, there must have been at least three shops or sheds clustered at the west end of Paul's in the 1590's. Ling, Humphrey Lownes, and Richard Smith were all selling editions with the West Door or West End addresses in the imprints at this time. 21 Ling continued to use the West Door address into 1600 (imprints of STC 1891.5, 14923, and 17868). One imprint of that year, however, gives his location as St. Paul's Churchyard, 22 and another of 1601 also gives this address (STC 22736). In fact, however, he had opened a shop at St. Dunstan's-in-the-West in 1598. A Wardmote Inquest of that year cites "Nichas Linge Bookebynder for forestalling his neighbo rs and streghtynynge the Queenes highe waie by settinge vp a shopp borde into the Churche yarde." 23 The first imprint to give St. Dunstan's as his address occurs in 1602 (STC 7197). After this, all imprints which specify an address give the St. Dunstan's location (STC 22276 and 22737, 1604; STC 10457 and 11576, 1606; STC 22738 and STC 23669, 1607).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I quote from the original of the Register at Stationers' Hall, Liber C , fol. 161r. This entry is reproduced in Cyprian Blagden, The Stationers' Company, a History, 1403-1959 (1960), figure iv, p. 111. (The note on this figure, however, is wrong: the items are not "sixteen plays.") See also Edward Arber, ed., A Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London; 1554-1640 A. D. (1875-94; 1967), iii. 365; and, for the play titles, W. W. Greg, A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama (1939-59; London, 1970), p. 24. In this essay, I have silently altered all legal-year dates to the calendar year. 2 For a complete description of the Drayton editions, see Bent Juels-Jensen, "Bibliography of the Early Editions of the Writings of Michael Drayton" in The Works , ed. by J. William Hebel, 5th Corrected Edition, ed. by Kathleen Tillotson and Bernard Newdigate (1961), v. 271-306. Juels-Jensen describes Smethwick's 1619 edition as "by far the most important of the collected editions of the Poems ." (p. 288). It is obvious that Smethwick took a rather wide view of which titles the assignment referred to. In later years he also brought out three other titles which had not been mentioned in the assignment: Jonson's Every Man Out , Weever's An Agnus Dei , and William Burton's translation from Erasmus (see below). 3 See John F. Pound, ed., The Norwich Census of the Poor 1570 (1971), pp. 28, 86. The Pockthorpe property, which eventually passed to Nicholas Ling, "housed eight families, or 22 people in all." (p. 14). 4 Percy Milligan, ed., The Register of the Freemen of Norwich 1548-1713 (1934), p. 122. 5 David A. Stoker, "A History of the Norwich Book Trades from 1560 to 1760." 2 Vols.

Jackson, ed., Records of the Court of the Stationers' Company 1602 to 1640 (1957), p. 10. Ling paid this fine on the same day (Arber ii. 839). I have found no record that he actually served a prison sentence. 8 The entry for Ling in McKerrow's A Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers . . . 1557-1640 (1910; rpt. 1977) states that Ling's will is P. C. C., 58, Wingfield. But this Nicholas Ling was a merchant who lived in the parish of St. Dionis Backchurch. (See the edition of the Register of that parish by Joseph L. Chester [1878], passim .) His burial date is recorded as 27 February 1609. His will was recorded in that year (23, Dorset) and proved in 1610 (58, Wingfield). His wife's will was recorded in 1613 (123, Capell). For those interested in trivial coincidences, it is unfortunate that this Ling was not the publisher, for his wife's name, when he married her, was Elizabeth Hamlet. (See Boyd's Marriage Index for 1594 and her will.) 9 The information on Bynneman's shops is taken from Mark Eccles, "Bynneman's Books," The Library , V, 12 (1957), 88 and 92. 10 Ling published Calvin's A Commentarie uppon the Epistle to the Philippians in 1584 "to be sold at the West dore of S. Pauls Church." (STC 4402). He entered this work on 3 August 1584 (Arber ii. 434), but this entry probably followed the publication as he was assessed a fine of twelve pence on the same day for printing the book "without order" (Arber ii. 857). He published without entrance A Godlie Exhortation to Vertuous Parents and Modest Matrons (STC 11503) in 1584. Of Udall's sermons, Ling, Man, and Broome published, all without entrance, Amendment of Life (STC 24489) and Obedience to the Gospel (STC 24501) in 1584. According to the imprint, Ling published Peters Fall (STC 24503) alone in that year. Reprints of these works in 1585-89, however, indicate that they were published by Man (or Man and Thomas Gubbin in the second edition of Amendment of Life ). Ling's last publication before his return to Norwich was probably the single sheet folio of visitation articles for the Church of England (STC 10268). This imprint is undated, but the heading indicates that the visitation was "holden the yeere. 1584 the 15. and 19. of Ianuarie" (i.e., 1585). 11 See my essay on John Busby, forthcoming in The Library , March 1985. 12 Ling's publisher's device (McKerrow #301) appears for the first time on the fifth edition of Pierce Penniless , 1595 (STC 18375). It contains Ling's initials and a visual pun on his name: a ling (fish) entwined in honeysuckle. McKerrow notes that the honeysuckle has not been explained. D. Carroll Allen suggests that it might be "a pictoral anagram— Honisocal—Nicholas —possible with a number of variant spellings." Skialetheria (1974), p. 100. 13 The catalogue of the Pforzheimer Library ( English Literature, 1475-1700 [New York, 1940]) calls attention to a comment on this play by William Covell in his Polimenteria , 1595. Covell writes that this play stands "naked vpon euery poste" and notes in the margin that it is "A work howsoeuer not respected yet excellently done by Th. Kyd." (Q3v). 14 This William Holme (or Holmes) was probably also the publisher of Edward Vaughan's A Plaine and Perfect Method for Understanding the Bible in 1603 (STC 24599.5), in which the imprint reads: "at the Peahenne, ouer against Serieants Inne in Fleetstreet." He may also have published in 1606 Chapman's Monsieur D'Olive (BEPD #236), which was printed "for William Holmes, and are to be sold at his Shop in Saint Dun-stones Church-yard in Fleete-streete." A "William Holmes Stationer" was buried in this church on 28 July 1607 (Parish Register of St. Dunstan's-in-the-West, Guildhall Library, Ms. 10,342. For his burial charges, see the Churchwarden's Account, Guildhall Library, Ms. 2968/1, fol. 531v.) But it is not certain that he was the "william Holme, Junior" who entered Vaughan's A Method, or Brief Instruction . . . for the Reading of the Old and New Testament on 6 July 1590 (Arber ii. 553, STC 24597). This edition gives no address in the imprint, and, according to the Revised STC, it is not the same text as STC 24599.5 (above), as Jackson quite understandably thinks ( Records of the Court , p. 41, n. 1). Every Man Out , though not listed in the 1607 assignment, was later claimed by Smethwick. It appears under his name as publisher in the 1616 edition of Jonson's works. 15 Arber ii. 837. Two days later Smethwick and Brown paid half of their ten shilling fines, but there is no record that Ling was forthcoming with any of his. However, the copy was printed by Thomas Creede in several editions circa 1603-1607 (STC 6534 et seq. ). No publisher is named, but the address, "Saint Donstones Church-yard in Fleete-Streete" is Ling's; moreover, his publisher's device is on the title-pages. In his introduction to The Plague Pamphlets of Thomas Dekker (1925; rpt. 1971), F. P. Wilson speculates that Ling may have "made matters smooth with the Company by paying his fine and by getting the pamphlet properly licensed." (p. xxxiv). If so, it is puzzling why he continued to omit his name from the imprint. 16 Antiquity; or the Wise Instructer , which was "Printed for J. Brooks, the Editor." The British Library copy of this edition (shelf mark 1075.1.3) is annotated by P. Bliss, who calls the book: "A singular instance of deception and plagiarism." Other than the new title-page, this book contains new preliminaries, including a twenty page list of subscribers, and a "Discourse on Man" added at the end. Otherwise, it appears to reproduce the text of Politeuphuia . 17 There are two issues of the first edition of Wits Theater . In the first (STC 381) the dedication to "Iohn Bodenham" is signed "Robert Allott" (A2-2v). In the second (STC 382) the dedication to "I.B." is unsigned. Though obscure, the wording of this dedication suggests that its author is laying claim not only to this book but also to Politheuphuia . Since Ling apparently had edited the latter work (and perhaps had worked on Wits Theater as well if it is the book of examples promised n the Address to the Reader in later editions of Politeuphuia ), it may be that he disputed Allott's claim in this dedication and cancelled his name in the second issue. 18 See J. William Hebel, "Nicholas Ling and Englands Helicon," The Library , IV, 5 (1925), 153-160; and Hyder Rollins, ed., England's Helicon (1935), ii. 60. D. T. Starnes has traced the history of the form back through earlier sixteenth-century examples to Diogenes Laertes. ("Sir Thomas Elyot and the 'Sayings of the Philosophers,'" University of Texas Studies in English , Number 13 [1933], 5-36.) According to Starnes, the editor or collector of Politeuphuia "seldom translated from originals. He took matter second-hand and often slavishly followed his immediate sources." (p. 24) 19 Harold Jenkins, ed., Hamlet (1982), p. 15. 20 The DNB article on Bynneman states that Matthew Parker "allowed him to open a shed at the North-West door of St. Paul's at the sign of the 'Three Wells' . . ." I have been unable to find this reference in Parker's correspondence. Parker did write to Burghley on Bynneman's behalf in 1569 (the relevant section of this letter is reproduced in Plomer's article "Henry Bynneman, Printer," The Library , New Series, 9 [1908], p. 233), but there is no reference to a shop. I have found this sign in only one of Bynneman's books. The colophon in The Surueye of the World, or Situation of the Earth (STC 6901) reads: "Imprinted in Knightrider streete, at the signe of the Mermayde, 1572. And are to be sold at his shop at the Northwest dore of Poules Church, at the signe of the three Welles." 21 Lownes is located at this address in the following imprints: STC 13114, 1590; STC 14685.7, 1592; STC 1483, 1595; STC 7208, [1596]; and STC 1484, 1598. Smith sold the following editions there: STC 7, STC 629, STC 5632, STC 5637, and STC 23867, 1592; STC 17346, 1593; STC 17347, 1595; STC 17347.5, 1596; and STC 17348, 1597. When his copyrights passed to William Wood in 1598 (Arber iii. 131), Wood evidently also took over this shop (imprints in STC 4207 and STC 5234, 1599; and STC 17082, 1601). This was probably the Richard Smith from whom Bynneman had leased a shop at the west end in 1574 for ten years (Eccles, "Bynneman's Books," p. 88), but it is not clear which shop this lease refers to. Bynneman had printed two editions for a Richard Smith in the 1570's (STC 3181, 1571; and STC 11636, 1575). These editions were sold at the Northwest Door (STC 3181 specifies "the Corner shoppe, at the North-weast dore"). 22 In the Folger Library grangerized copy of Drayton's Heroicall Epistles , 4th edition (STC 7196), the imprint reads: "Printed by I. R. for N. L. and are to be sold at his shop, in Paules Church-yard at the signe of the Crane. 1600." Evidently the imprints of other copies of this edition do not mention this shop sign. Juels-Jensen does not note it in his bibliography of Drayton. Ling's collaborator, John Busby, sold two editions at this address in 1598-99 (STC 17485 and STC 20307). 23 Guildhall Library, Ms. 3018/1, fol. 61v. Ling evidently moved to this parish late in 1598. A son of his was baptized in the Parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate, on 27 October 1598. (William E. Miller, "Printers and Stationers in the Parish of St. Giles-Cripplegate 1561-1640," Studies in Bibliography , 19 [1966], 30.)</field>
      <field name="heading_text">William Stansby's Early Career by James K. Bracken</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Heretofore the date of William Stansby's succession to the mastership of the Cross Keys printing house of his former master John Windet is thought to have been about 1615. R. B. McKerrow, in his Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers in England, Scotland and Ireland, and of Foreign Printers of English Books, 1557-1640 , noted that Stansby "appears to have been taken into partnership by his former master, at whose death about 1615, he succeeded to the business." 1 In his portrait of John Windet, however, McKerrow was less precise about the date of Stansby's succession: "The last book entry under his [Windet's] name is found on May 14th, 1604; but he continued in business until 1611 when he assigned over his copyrights to William Stansby, who ultimately succeeded to the business" ( Dictionary , p. 295). Evidence showing that McKerrow was incorrect in dating Windet's death about 1615 and, consequently, mistaken in placing Stansby's succession in the same year, although right in assuming that they had entered into a partnership, appears in Windet's will. 2 The will, tested on 21 November 1610, was probated on 8 January 1611, showing that Windet had certainly died between these dates. Furthermore, the will shows, first, that Windet and Stansby had previously agreed to a partnership in which Stansby owned half of the printing instruments of the Cross Keys as well as half of Windet's completed but unsold books, partially completed books, and manuscripts yet to be printed; and, second, that the remainder of Windet's professional property was to be offered to Stansby for purchase at a price established by Windet's executors. The second point of Windet's will is as follows: 3 Item I give &amp; bequeath to my saide sisters [Elizabeth Goarde, wife of John Goarde, a London barber-surgeon, and Mary Bowles, wife of John Bowles, a Devonshire tailor] all my part or porc i on of my printinge stuffe or instrumentes for printinge nowe in my tenure, or in the tenure or occupac i on of William Stansbie Cittizen and Stacioner of London whoe is nowe Cop ar tner w i th me in printinge as by certaine Covenauntes made betweene us both touchinge the same at large appeareth[.] All w hi ch saide printinge stuffe or Instrumentes for printinge, as presses, letters, Cases, Chases[,] borders, cast or cutt letters, unites markes[,] composinge stickes, flowers, gallies pap er bordes or other thinge or thinges, necessarie or necessaries whatsoever nowe used occupied or ymploied or hereafter to be used occupied or imploied by what name or names the same shalbe of or shalbe called in or about the saide printinge house or other roomes belonginge to the same[.] All w hi ch saide goodes debtes and chattells whatsoever my will and minde is that they shalbe w i thin three daies after my deathe equallie devided betweene the saide William Stansbye and my Executor to the use of my saide twoe sisters except the saide William Stansbye will buye the same at such price or prices as by the discrec i on of mr Thomas Dawson and mr Adam Islyp shalbe thought fitt and meete to be given for the same, And if the saide William Stansbye doe refuse to buye or take the same at such rate or price as the saide mr Dawson and mr Islyppe shall thincke fitt to agree uppon, Then my will and minde is that the same equall parte or porc i on belonginge or apperteyninge to my saide sisters shalbe solde to the Companie of Stacioners or printers w i thin the Cittie of London, And if the saide Companie shall refuse to buye the same Then my will and minde is that the same shallbe solde or otherwise disposed of to the most benefitt and advantage of my saide Sisters at the discrec i on of my executor[.] ffurthermore my will and minde is that all such printed or imprinted paper bookes p er fect or books imp er fect or anie other thinge or thinges matter or matters, copie or copies, or anie scriptes, scrowles papers or other writinges or anie manner of thinge or thinges app er teyninge to us both nowe in my lifetyme by wait of Cop ar tnershipp that the same shall likewise be equallie devided betwixt the saide William Stansbye and myne Executor to the use of my saide sisters as aforesaid rate and ratelike. The details of Windet's will allow the events of Stansby's early career to be reexamined in new light. Stansby began his career as an apprentice to John Windet in the Cross Keys on Christmas 1590. 4 Admitted a freeman on 7 January 1597 (Arber, II, 717), Stansby evidently went into business for himself, although remaining closely associated with Windet. On 28 April 1597—only three months after he was made a freeman—Stansby entered his first book copy, The Policy of the Turkish Empire (Arber, III, 83), which he published in the same year ( STC 24335). The book's imprint, "Printed by Iohn Windet for W. S. and are to be soulde at Powles Wharfe at the signe of the Crosse Keyes," suggests that Windet greatly aided Stansby in the publication. Stansby's name as publisher appears in the colophon. Stansby was then apparently content to labor quietly in Windet's printing house for the next decade. 5 After 1607, however, numerous books can be attributed to Stansby as a printer. Since he owned no press, Stansby probably about this time entered into the partnership with Windet which enabled him to use the resources of the Cross Keys for his own benefit. The earliest book whose printing has been attributed to Stansby is The Iesuites Play at Lyons ( STC 21514), which was published by Nathaniel Butter in 1607. 6 The book's imprint does not identify the printer. Stansby's initials as the printer appear in the imprint of the fourth edition of Politeuphuia ( STC 15687), published by John Smethwick in 1608. Stansby's name as a printer begins to appear regularly in the imprints of books published in 1609. Eight books can be attributed to him in this year and another twelve in 1610, while twenty-seven can be attributed to Windet in these years. Stansby's new prominence and, doubtless, Windet's decline in the activities of the Cross Keys are indicated on 21 June 1610 when Stansby bound Robert Lightburne as an apprentice for a term of eight years. 7 In binding an apprentice, Stansby assumed a right of only those freemen who were masters. Within months Windet would be dead and Stansby apparently in full control of the Cross Keys. In 1611 Stansby began vigorously printing for other stationers, entering book copies, and undertaking publications on his own account. Twenty-three books can be attributed to Stansby in 1611, eight of which he published on his own or in partnership with other stationers. On 1 April 1611 Stansby registered his first book copy since 1597, The Tocsin, or Watch-bell (Arber, III, 456), which he printed for Edward White ( STC 1845) in the same year. On 11 September 1611 some forty-seven full and partial copyrights which were formerly Windet's were assigned to Stansby (Arber, III, 466-67). With this assignment it appears that Stansby's succession to Windet's business was made complete. Stansby already owned Windet's professional property. He now acquired Windet's most valuable copyrights as well. The tremendous productivity of the Cross Keys printing house in 1611 and afterwards can be credited solely to Stansby. Some 104 books can be attributed to him in the period 1611-15. Three-quarters of these, seventy-eight in number, Stansby printed for other stationers, the remaining quarter, some twenty-six, being his own publications. Among the books which Stansby produced in this period are some significant folios—Richard Hooker's Of the Lawes of Ecclesiasticall Politie ( STC 13714) of 1611; Thomas Fougasses' The Generall Historie of the Magnificent State of Venice ( STC 11207) of 1612 (shared with George Eld); Samuel Purchas' Purchas His Pilgrimage ( STC 20505 and 20506) of 1613 and 1614; Seneca's Workes ( STC 22213), Walter Ralegh's The History of the World ( STC 20637), Thomas Jackson's The Third Booke of Commentaries vpon the Apostles Creede ( STC 14315), and William Leighton's Teares and Lamentations of a Sorrowfull Soule ( STC 15434) of 1614; and William Camden's Annales ( STC 4496) and William Martyn's The Historie and Liues of Twentie Kings of England ( STC 17526 and 17527) of 1615. Following the death of Windet in late 1610 or early 1611, Stansby became solely responsible for the activities of the Cross Keys printing house. The books produced there are much to his credit.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">John Webster and Thomas Heywood in Appius and Virginia : A Bibliographical Approach to the Problem of Authorship by MacD. P. Jackson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Introduction John Webster's reputation rests upon two fascinating Italianate tragedies which, though displaying such baroque excess of local elaboration and such straining for sensational effect as to lack clarity of outline or obvious coherence of purpose or point of view, are pervaded by a distinctive and haunting atmosphere that blends savagery, melancholy, and a nerve-tingling sense of impending doom. And the "Tussaud laureate" who created The White Devil and The Duchess of Malfi set his seal no less surely on their dazzling tragi-comic counterpart, The Devil's Law Case . But Appius and Virginia , first published in 1654 with a title-page ascription to Webster, is less clearly a product of the same singular imagination; for this Roman tragedy is "striking in its almost classical simplicity of construction" (Lucas, Webster's Works , III, 146). In plot it is straightforward, direct, and unified, and in style it is restrained. Can such a work really be Webster's? Rupert Brooke thought not, vigorously arguing in 1913 that Webster's sole contribution to Appius was the revision of I.i and IV.i, the play being Heywood's. 1 Most scholars have since apportioned Appius between Webster and Heywood, although Bentley was characteristically impatient at what he pronounced "impressionism rationalized," and saw "no grounds for any dogmatic assertions about the authorship" ( Jacobean and Caroline Stage , V, 1247). F. L. Lucas could scarcely be accused of dogmatism on the subject. In his standard edition of Webster's works he hesitantly ascribed I.i, I.ii, III.ii, III.iii, IV.i, and V.i to Webster alone, considered II.ii largely his, and found traces of his work in every scene except (doubtfully) II.i, IV.ii, and V.ii. In his massive two-volume study of the playwright, Fernand Lagarde surveyed all the evidence for authorship of Appius and Virginia , and on the basis of his own intimate knowledge of the dramatist and of an analysis of orthographical and linguistic forms concluded: "Nous proposons d'attribuer sans réserve à Webster I.i., I.ii., II.ii., III.iii., III.iii., IV.i. et V.i., et de lui concéder un certain rôle dans la composition de I.iii., de I.iv., de II.iii. et de V.ii." Peter B. Murray, after counting some contractions, felt most confident of Webster's authorship of I.ii, II.ii, III.ii, III.iii, IV.i, and V.ii. And Sanford Sternlicht's thorough comparison of the play's imagery with that of the three undoubted Webster plays persuaded him that five scenes (I.i, I.ii, II.ii, III.iii, and IV.i) "belong fully and strongly to Webster," and that three others (IV.ii.1-44, V.i, and V.ii) show signs of his hand. Lucas, Lagarde, Murray, and Sternlicht exhibit a fair measure of agreement. Yet none offers compelling evidence, and the problem remains intractable. Arguments from diction and imagery are, as Lucas was well aware, of dubious value, when the whole artistic impulse of Appius and Virginia is towards a far more chaste dramaturgy than that which served Webster in his Italian tragedies. Though Lagarde, unlike Murray, gives an accurate and fairly full tabulation of the linguistic forms in Appius and Virginia , Lucrece is his sole source of comparative material for Heywood. There is still much to be done along this line of enquiry. My purpose in this article is twofold: to provide, through bibliographical and, in particular, compositorial analysis of the 1654 Quarto of Appius , a sold basis for examination of those orthographical and linguistic minutiae which may aid author identification, and to undertake a more comprehensive examination of this sort of evidence than has been reported up till now.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Quarto of 1654: Printer and Compositors The sole Quarto of Appius and Virginia survives in no fewer than five issues, with successive cancels replacing the original title leaf (Greg, Bibliography , II, 733). The first issue, of which Greg records two copies, was printed for Richard Marriot, to whom it had been entered in the Stationers' Register on 13 May 1654, and is dated 1654, as is the second, of which there are eight copies; the third, extant in a unique copy in the Library of Congress, is dated 1655; the fourth, of which there are eight copies, is dated 1659 and was printed for Humphrey Moseley, to whom the rights had been transferred on 11 June 1659; and the fifth, of which there are four copies, is as late as 1679. The collation is A 1 B-H 4 I 4 (—I4), the text beginning on B1 and ending on I3. The printer, hitherto unidentified, was almost certainly Thomas Maxey (active 1637-1657), whose name as printer is on the title page of at least seven of Marriot's publications in the period 1651-1655, 2 including Isaak Walton's The Complete Angler (1653, and second edition 1655), Sir Henry Wotton's Reliquiae Wottonianae (1651, and second edition 1654), and John Donne's Essays in Divinity (1651). There is little about the Appius Quarto that might serve readily to identify its printer—only an arrangement of nine unusual fleurons on the title page and a double row of small acorn-like ornamental types, of a very common kind, above the head title on B1. Both these forms of ornamentation are, however, found several times in Reliquiae Wottonianae (1654, Wing W 3649) on A3, A5, B1, E2, F7, H1, and many other pages; in Edward Sparke's Scintillula Altaris , printed by Maxey (1652, Wing S 4807) on A3. A4v, A5v, A6v, A7, B2, C1, and other pages; and in Essays in Divinity (1651, Wing D 1861) on A1, A2, and K11v; and the more distinctive appears in The Complete Angler (1653, Wing W 661) on A5; The Complete Angler (1655, Wing W 662) on Q11; Reliquiae Wottonianae (1651, Wing W 3648) on a1, b1, A1, D1, F4, I5, and P4; and Sir Thomas Overbury's Observations upon the Provinces United (1651, Wing O 609), also printed by Maxey, on A4. Moreover, the Appius fleuron is used on A2v of the Quarto of Henry Glapthorne's Revenge for Honour , which has a publishing history similar to that of Appius , appearing in three issues, two of 1654 "for Richard Marriot," and a third of 1659 "for Humphrey Moseley" (Greg, Bibliography , II, 730). In the second issue, surviving in a single copy in the Pforzheimer Library, a leaf containing an Epistle Dedicatory has been inserted after the title. Greg notes: "While there is no proof that the leaf belongs to the book, there seems no reason to doubt it. According to the Pforzheimer Catalogue the printer of the leaf was Thomas Maxey (1647-57), but the printer of the play is not known." Greg does not say on what basis the Pforzheimer Catalogue assigned the printing of the second issue's additional leaf to Maxey, but that he was in fact the printer of the whole play is strongly suggested by the type ornamentation that the Quarto has in common with Scintillula Altaris (1652), The Complete Angler (both 1653 and 1655), and the other books printed by Maxey. Compare, for example, A2 of Revenge for Honour with A2, A8, and B1 of the first edition of The Complete Angler (1653), and with A2 and B1 of the second edition (1655). Or compare the opening A2v-A3 of Revenge for Honour with the opening 2C1v-2C2 of Scintillula Altaris . The habit of dividing a row of ornamental types by colons links Revenge for Honour with the books known to have been printed by Maxey. In Revenge for Honour , as in Appius and Virginia , only two leaves per gathering are signed, always in the form 'B', 'B2', without stops, and in neither play are lines of verse capitalized. Both Quartos seem to use the same fount of type, of which twenty lines measure approximately 81-82 mm. 3 Thomas Maxey is, then, the probable printer of both Revenge for Honour and Appius and Virginia . Analysis of the headlines in the Appius Quarto reveals that a single skeleton was used for inner and outer formes of sheets B-E. This skeleton also machined both formes of G and the outer formes of H and I. However, a second skeleton was introduced to machine both formes of F and the inner formes of H and I. 4 Tabulation makes the sequence clear: B C D E F G H I OUTER: I I I I II I I I INNER: I I I I II I II II This skeleton pattern implies an undisturbed relationship between composition and presswork over the first four sheets, but suggests that the first forme of F may have been prepared for the press before the second forme of E had been released. It would not be surprising to find some change in the compositorial pattern in sheet F. A hint towards differentiation of compositors is given by the spellings of those useful test words do and go . On some pages the spellings do and go are preferred, on others doe and goe . Pages exhibiting a decisive preference for do and go are C1, C2, C4v, D4, E1, F2, F3, F4, G2v, G3, G3v, and I4v; and for doe and goe B2v, C3v, D1, D1v, E2v, E3, E3v, E4, and E4v. 5 When the twelve do/go pages are carefully compared with the nine doe/goe pages, further differences emerge, and these all prove statistically significant beyond the one per cent level, when tested by Yates's chi-square. 6 Table 1 presents these results: Table 1 12 do/go pages 9 doe/goe pages (Compositor A) (Compositor B) do/go 39 do/go 1 doe/goe 0 doe/goe 31 I'l 15 I'l 0 I'le 1 I'le/Ile 10 -ness 10 -ness 0 -nesse 4 -nesse 8 -l 22 -l 1 -ll 0 -ll 22 Figures for -l and -ll endings exclude monosyllabic words ( shall , will , well , still , and so on), of which the modern spelling predominates throughout, but the do / go speller, whom I have labelled Compositor A, nevertheless uses the -l ending in a monosyllable 9 times in his twelve pages, whereas the doe / goe speller (Compositor B) never uses it. Compositor A's I'le spelling occurs on a page (F4) on which I'l also appears. Compositor B's anomalous single -l spelling is in the last word of a full line, and is outweighed on the page (E2v) by four -ll endings. Compositor B's uncharacteristic do spelling is also in a full line, and there are eight doe / goe spellings on the same page (E3v). From Table 1 we may safely conclude that at least two compositors set the text and that the spellings listed there will serve to distinguish them. When the whole text is examined in the light of these key words, almost every page affords unequivocal evidence (presented in full in Table 2 at the end of this article) of one or other compositor's handiwork. The overall pattern suggests that the doubtful pages in sheet B are probably Compositor B's, those in F-H probably Compositor A's. The change at F in the relationship between composition and presswork, tentatively inferred from the skeleton pattern, is confirmed by Table 2, which shows Compositor A, who had shared equally with Compositor B the setting of sheets C and D, and also set the first two pages of sheet E, now taking over as sole typesetter. Presumably presswork was lagging behind composition, perhaps because the press was partly occupied with some other job, so that Compositor A could comfortably keep ahead of the press on his own. Some confirmation of the proposed compositorial divisions is provided by the setting of words immediately following speech prefixes. Compositor A often fails to set adequate spacing between prefix and text. Compositor B is more consistent. There is doubtless subjectivity in my criterion of "adequacy" here, but on A's thirty-five unquestioned pages I count fifty-six instances of deficient spacing between prefix and text, whereas B's nineteen unquestioned pages afford only five. B1, B4, and B4v are all perfect in this respect, while F1, F2v, G4v, and H3v have two, two, one, and two examples of inadequate spacing. So my tentative assignment of the doubtful pages in sheet B to Compositor B, and of those in sheets F-H to Compositor A receives some support from this evidence. Compositor A always sets speech prefixes for Marcus Clodius as Clod . (36 times), except for one Clo. in a full line on D4: the pertinent pages are D2v, D4, D4v, F1, F1v, F2, F2v, F3, G1, G1v, I1, I2v, and I3. Compositor B never sets Clod. , but employs a great variety of other prefixes for Clodius. He begins with two instances of Marcus. Cl. on B1v, sets Marcus twice on B2-B2v, changes on B3v from Cl. to Clodius. (twice) and M. Clodius . (3 times), continuing to use M. Clodius. three times on B4. Then he follows one Clodius. on C2 with Clo. twice on C2 and three times on C3, reverting to M. Clodius. (twice) and Clodius. (6 times) on D2. In E2v-E4v he sets a single Clo. at the top of E3, but otherwise wavers between Clodius. (15 times) and Clodi. (5 times). The difference between the two men is striking: Speech Prefixes for Marcus Clodius Clod. other forms Compositor A: 36 1 Compositor B: 0 48 Three tentative attributions are thus further confirmed—B4 to Compositor B, and F1 and F2v to Compositor A.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Manuscript Copy for Q What sort of manuscript served as copy for the Quarto of Appius ? R. G. Howarth claims: "Obviously the text was prepared for the press, though no title-page (with a motto, in Webster's usual fashion) and no dedication or preliminary address have been drawn up" ( PQ , 46, 137). Nor is there any Dramatis Personae , such as heads The Duchess of Malfi and The Devil's Law Case . That the manuscript had been "prepared for the press" is not obvious to me, though it is divided into acts, not scenes, with the formula Actus Primus Scena Prima , and so on, and each act but the last (followed by FINIS ) ends with an Explicit . The explicit, used by Heywood in his autographs of The Escapes of Jupiter and The Captives , reappears in the Quartos of several of his plays— The Iron Age (both parts), The Wise Woman of Hogsdon , and The Fair Maid of the West (both parts); but it can also be found ending Acts II and III of Webster's The Devil's Law Case . The text is comparatively clean, requiring few substantive emendations, and the speech prefixes give little cause for complaint, though Lucas plausibly transfers five words from Numitor to Appius at F4v, IV.i.61, and there is ambiguity in the frequent abbreviations for Virginius and Virginia, both usually Virg. in the Quarto, even when present in the same scene. Corbulo, so named in the speech prefixes at the opening of II.i and III.i (C2, C2v, D4v, E1), abbreviated to Corb. in III.iv (F3, F3v, F4), is Clown. or Clow. in III.ii (E2v, E3, E3v). The Quarto's one Cl. and seven Clo. speech prefixes for Marcus Clodius could cause confusion with the Clown, but Compositor B may have been solely responsible for the abbreviations. Lucas adds a score of exit directions and supplements a few entries, while on F1v Enter Valerius is a minor error, as it is Sertorius who has been called for on E4v and who is dismissed on F2v. So prompt-book provenance seems unlikely. On C1v the stage direction has Virginius enter where Virginia is required, but this error may well have been the compositor's. In the Quarto minor characters are often designated by a number: 1. Cozen. , 2. Cozen. , 1. Petitioner. , 2. Petit. , 1. Serving. , 2. Serving . (for servingmen), for example. In three scenes numbers alone are used: in II.ii "six Souldiers" are given numerals as speech prefixes (22 times); in III.ii two of "foure Lictors" speak alternately with the numerals 1 and 2 (10 speeches); and in IV.ii "two Souldiers" are indicated in the same way (19 speeches). The use of unqualified numerals as speech prefixes is not a feature of either Webster's or Heywood's undoubted plays as they have come down to us, though in The Duchess of Malfi , especially, Webster has a great many prefixes of the type in which a numeral precedes a generic title—for two servingmen, four officers, two pilgrims, and four madmen; and Heywood also has many in his autographs of The Captives and The Escapes of Jupiter , and in other plays. The unaccompanied numerals occur in scenes of Appius that will be shown to be wholly or largely Webster's. Their presence suggests foul papers copy. Perhaps pointing to the same conclusion is the fact that fifteen prefixes in Appius are assigned to Omnes , twelve in II.ii, one in II.i, one in IV.i, and one in IV.ii. Some of the speeches go far beyond simple exclamations of a united rabble, and in performance they would obviously need to be allocated to individuals among those assembled, rather than uttered in chorus. The designation Omnes is an author's conventional shorthand, common enough in dramatic texts of the time. Neither Heywood nor Webster is elsewhere given to such frequent use of collective speech prefixes, and Heywood normally prefers All when he does use them, though there are three examples of Omnes in The English Traveller and two in Webster's The White Devil . II.ii is the first scene in which a sizable group of soldiers must be incorporated into the dialogue and action: hence the special need for the group prefixes here. Many of the entry directions seem authorial, most notably: Enter Virginius with his knife, that and his arms stript up to the elbowes all bloudy; coming into the midst of the souldiers, he makes a stand . (H1) There is a descriptive tinge to several: Appius enters melancholly on B3, as does the Clowne , meaning the character named Corbulo in speech prefixes, on F3. Iulius enters troubled on D2. Corbulo, called Clown again, enters whispering Virginia, after her M. Clodius with presents on C2: Clodius's entry here is inconsistent with the direction some twenty-five lines later, Enter Clodius and Musicians , which Lucas modifies to Clodius comes forward, with Musicians , supposing that Clodius "should lurk in the background" (III, 250). On F4 Virginius and Virginia each enter like a slave , and on H1 the first mutinous Souldier enters in haste . On I1 Enter Appius, and Marcus Clodius , fettered and gyved . Numbers of minor characters entering are precisely specified except on B4, where the stage direction ends with &amp;c , C2v ( Musicians ), and D2v ( Lictors ). On B2v Enter a Servant, whispers Icilius in the eare , spread over three lines against the right-hand margin, begins at least a line too late and is moved up by Lucas. Another feature of the Quarto that tells against a theatrical origin for the printer's copy is the tendency in some scenes for short speeches that continue a line of verse to occupy the same line as the preceding speech ending. As Greg explained, "In all manuscripts intended for stage use every speech begins a fresh line of writing, irrespective of the metrical division. The habit of writing speakers' names in the middle of a line would be distracting for prompt purposes, and may be taken to indicate a purely literary intention in the writer. The speakers' names are in the margin, and the beginning of speeches are not indented as is usual in print, but a short horizontal rule is drawn separating the speeches." 7 The untheatrical setting out of some short speeches in the Quarto 8 is unlikely to be a printing-house strategy for the saving of space, because it occurs in the stints of both compositors and in various positions on the pages, which are seldom unduly crowded. Moreover, the practice is characteristic of Webster in all three of his unaided plays, and in Appius it is confined to scenes in which there are other strong indications of Webster's authorship, as I shall show. On the other hand, of the few directions for action that are set to the right of the page, one looks very like a book-keeper's annotation: on H3v Wine , against the right-hand margin, comes ten short speeches before Virginius actually calls "Wilt a, wilt a give me some Wine?" The direction A Shout on I2 might be from the same source. The evidence suggests to me authorial papers, which may have received some attention from the prompter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Linguistic Discriminators between Webster and Heywood Attempts to determine the authorship of Appius and Virginia are complicated by ignorance over its date of composition. Metrical and stylistic considerations have led most commentators to conclude that " Appius lies at one end or other of Webster's development" (Lucas, III, 122), but there is no agreement over which end: it has been dated 1603-4 at the one extreme, 1626-34 at the other. Bentley finds the evidence of earlier scholars "at best inadequate, often absurd, and frequently tied to arguments for hypothetical collaborators," but judges that "the period from 1624 to Webster's death seems to have slightly more to be said for it than have the other dates offered" (V, 1246). Lucas favoured 1625-7 as the most likely date of composition, and 1624 is the year under which it is entered in the Schoenbaum-Harbage Annals . In view of the paucity of hard evidence on the matter, however, Heywood and Webster characteristics that fail to differentiate between the dramatists throughout the first quarter of the seventeenth century are of little legitimate use. Another complicating factor is doubt over the extent of Webster's participation in the plays in which he is alleged to have collaborated, such as Anything for a Quiet Life , The Fair Maid of the Inn , and A Cure for a Cuckold —and again there are problems of chronology. Could we be certain of his shares in these plays, a wider range of data concerning his stylistic and sub-stylistic characteristics would be available to us, and we might better be able to gauge and understand the changes in his art. But only the early collaborations with Dekker, Westward Ho (1604) and Northward Ho (1605), can be apportioned between the parties with any precision or confidence. 9 In pursuit of "linguistic" features that may serve to distinguish between Webster and Heywood, I have examined the three plays of Webster's undoubted sole authorship and fifteen plays known to be the unaided work of Heywood, including The Captives and The Escapes of Jupiter , extant in manuscripts generally agreed to be autograph. The minutiae studied were those that Cyrus Hoy, David J. Lake, and others have shown to fall into patterns discriminating neatly between the various Jacobean and Caroline dramatists—colloquial contractions such as 'em , I've , e'en , ha' , i'th' ; linguistic preferences for ye , you , or 'ee , hath or has ; exclamations, oaths, and other expletives; affirmative particles ( Ay , Yes , or Yea ); connectives such as among or amongst , betwixt or between , while or whilst ; and habits in the setting out, spelling, and punctuation of the text. 10 In many of these respects the two authors are closely alike. Neither makes liberal use of a wide range of contractions and both eschew has and does in favour of the formal hath and doth , 11 except that Webster favours has and does in The Devil's Law Case : we cannot know whether the change reflects chronology ( The White Devil is usually dated 1612, The Duchess of Malfi 1614, and The Devil's Law Case 1617), or was made in the interests of decorum, the colloquial forms being felt more appropriate to tragi-comedy than to tragedy. Another possible explanation would look to the probable origins of the texts. John Russell Brown judged that The White Devil was printed from the author's own papers, that The Duchess of Malfi was printed from a transcript, probably in the hand of Ralph Crane, and that while for The Devil's Law Case the indications were slight and inconclusive, they appeared to point to a literary rather than a theatrical manuscript. 12 Although Webster and Heywood avoid various forms common in the work of other dramatists —and these forms are absent from Appius —both men are rather fond of aphetic forms, such as 'fore and 'gainst , which occur several times in Appius ; and even the exclamation Ha! , a recognized favourite of Webster's, is of very little value in discriminating his writing from that of Heywood, who uses it quite often in several plays. Murray ( A Study of John Webster , p. 38) asserts that instances of 'tis in Heywood's work are "relatively few," but in The Captives , The English Traveller , and The Fair Maid of the West, Part II Heywood uses 'tis with a Websterian liberality, and in some other plays his rate of use is not significantly lower than Webster's. Among the more striking idiosyncracies of Heywood's autographs, the only one to survive into several printed texts is the spelling Ey for the affirmative Ay ( I in most dramatists), but its appearance in a Quarto as late as 1654 would be most surprising, and it is in fact absent from Appius . 13 The main features of Webster's linguistic pattern were noted by Hoy. Remarking that, apart from the switch to has and does in The Devil's Law Case , the linguistic practices evident in Webster's plays comprise a pattern that is "extremely consistent," Hoy showed that, though Webster avoids most contractions, "his use of i'th' , o'th' (which often occurs in his work as a'th' ), and 's for his in each of his three unaided plays far exceeds the occurrence of these forms in any single play of such other dramatists whose unaided work I have examined as Fletcher, Massinger, Field, and Ford." 14 Heywood makes little use of i'th' , o'th' , or 's for his . The two dramatists also differ in their preferences over connectives, one or two expletives are favoured by one man but not the other, and there are a few pseudo-bibliographical markers. Figures for some discriminators that prove relevant to Appius and Virginia are presented in Table 3 at the end of this article. I have omitted good discriminators between Webster and Heywood that fail to appear in Appius , such as the locution Gramercy , which turns up in almost all Heywood's plays but is never used by Webster. The forms listed in Table 3 vary in their power to discriminate. Heywood uses more contractions in i'th' , o'th' , and to th' towards the end of his career, to which period Appius is perhaps most likely to belong, but the rate of occurrence in his plays always falls far short of Webster's. Most of Heywood's to th' contractions are merely variants of the use, which he favours, of th' before a vowel; only five examples in The Captives and three within the two parts of The Fair Maid of the West are the genuine to th' contraction before a consonant, which is the type employed by Webster. For't appears with Websterian frequency in 2 Fair Maid but none of Heywood's other plays, though Webster's use is itself variable. A few examples of i'th' , o'th' , to th' , and for't in a scene of Appius would be perfectly compatible with Heywood's authorship. Far more distinctive is Webster's liking for of't , which is completely absent from the Heywood plays. Though I have not entered figures in the table, Webster's partiality for enclitic 't contractions generally is much greater than Heywood's, and his range is wider, including many more examples of 't appended to a verb— proclaim't , swear't , bring't , whisper't , and the like. Heywood usually restricts himself to the more common 't contractions, such as is't , in't , do't , to't . The total numbers of enclictic 't contractions in Webster's plays, according to my rather quick counts, are: The White Devil 68, The Duchess of Malfi 102, The Devil's Law Case 76. There are only four Heywood plays in which the total falls outside the range 5-25; in 1 Fair Maid , 2 Fair Maid , and The Captives it is about 50, and in The English Traveller about 60. Again, in three of the four later Heywood plays the figures are high and the rate of use Websterian. Clearly the number and type of 't contractions in a scene of Appius can be used only as slight supporting evidence. The most obvious discrepancy between Heywood and Webster in their use of contractions concerns 's for his : any instance of this type of contraction in Appius must constitute strong evidence for Webster's hand. The connectives ought to supply useful testimony. Whereas Heywood greatly prefers betwixt (83 times) to between (22), 15 and whilst (150 times) to while (10), Webster employs between exclusively (28 times), and prefers while (19 times) to whilst (6). Though in The White Devil and The Duchess of Malfi Webster shares Heywood's preference for amongst over among , in The Devil's Law Case this preference is reversed. Thus while , among , and between will, with varying decisiveness, point to Webster, whilst and betwixt to Heywood. A further pointer to Webster's authorship has not been tabulated. In The White Devil he adopts the classical and Jonsonian practice of using small capitals for speech prefixes and setting them within the line when a new speech continues a line of verse. In The Duchess of Malfi and The Devil's Law Case small capitals are replaced by lower-case italic (the names beginning with a capital, of course), but speeches continuing a line of verse still often begin within the line. This practice is entirely alien to the Heywood autographs; it occurs sporadically in the Quartos of The Royal King and the Loyal Subject and The English Traveller , and a few times in The Rape of Lucrece , The Golden Age , and (on a single page) The Silver Age , but it is not otherwise a feature of Heywood's plays.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Linguistic Evidence in APPIUS AND VIRGINIA 1654 Table 4 (at the end of this article) presents the incidence per scene of the discriminators mentioned so far. As Heywood favours no contractions avoided by Webster, Webster markers predominate, and their absence from certain scenes must be an important part of the evidence for Heywood's hand. As far as Table 4 goes, the surest signs of Webster's presence are in II.ii, III.ii, and IV.i, with II.iii, the very short III.iii, IV.ii, and V.i also offering something of value; in V.ii a solitary Webster marker, stop's for stop his , occurs in the third speech from the end of the play. The frequent occurrence of betwixt and whilst confirms that Webster is not the sole author of the play, and is consistent with Heywood's responsibility for much that scholars have assigned him. The divisions suggested by Table 4 are quite independent of the compositorial stints. For example, of the eighteen speech prefixes set within the line, ten belong to Compositor A's pages, eight to B's. All but one of them (one of the two on E3) prefix a speech that continues a line of verse. However, it will be convenient to discuss the evidence of Table 4 section by section. I.i—II.i : There is very little bibliographical or linguistic trace of Webster in the first Act or in II.i. The five instances of the less distinctive Webster contractions, and two 't contractions, within 514 lines of the first five scenes, contrast markedly with the nine Webster contractions, including the highly distinctive of't , from's , and in's , and four 't contractions, within 250 lines of II.ii, and the change is accompanied by a shift from Heywood's connectives (3 betwixt , 3 whilst ) in the first 514 lines to Webster's (3 while , 1 among ) in II.ii. Yet every scholar who has divided the play between the two dramatists assigns Webster I.i, and even Rupert Brooke nominated this as one of the two scenes that Webster might have revised, while Lucas, Lagarde, and Sternlicht all give Webster I.ii. There are passages in I.i that certainly seem to me more in Webster's than in Heywood's manner: My Lord, my Lord, you dally with your wits. I have seen children oft eat sweet-meats thus, As fearfull to devoure them: You are wise, and play the modest courtier right, To make so many bits of your delight. (I.i.19-23) I have heard of cunning footmen that have worne Shooes made of lead some ten dayes 'fore a race To give them nimble and more active feet: So great men should, that aspire eminent place, Load themselves with excuse and faint denyall, That they with more speed may performe the trial. (I.i.55-60) In the first of the above passages, lines 20-21 are in fact repeated from The Duchess of Malfi , I.i.533-534. I would tentatively suggest that Heywood may have begun copying out the play, and that the first five scenes of the printer's manuscript copy were in his handwriting. Thereafter the handwriting of the authorial papers may have alternated with dominant authorship. In some scenes the work of the two dramatists would appear to be thoroughly mixed. 16 The short I.ii does carry at least an orthographical hint of Webster's presence in the two instances of to th' followed by a consonant. As we have seen, this type of contraction is confined to The Captives and 2 Fair Maid among Heywood's plays, and used in them only eight times altogether, but it is common in Webster's work; and of the first five scenes I.ii is the only one without any indications of Heywood. There are some oddities about II.i. Hath and doth predominate throughout the play, except in this scene where, besides one hath , occur two examples of has and one of does (C2v-C3). There is one more has in IV.ii (G4). The opening of II.i between Corbulo and Virginia seems to be Heywood's; it is there that hath appears. The two instances of has and one of does are within the encounter between Clodius and Virginia in the second part of the scene. Lucas notes that metrically "it is peculiar owing to its high percentage of feminine endings and quite unlike anything else in the play" (III, 141). He perhaps exaggerates its metrical eccentricity: there are patches of verse elsewhere with many feminine endings, including the monosyllabic endings found here. But it is interesting that the encounter between Virginia and Clodius is introduced with the stage direction that Lucas found difficult to reconcile with that which opens the scene. Moreover, this episode has a heavy concentration of Clo. speech prefixes for Clodius: five of seven Quarto instances congregate here; Clodius is first given his full name, but is Clo. in his five other speeches in this scene. It is just possible that the Clodius-Virginia encounter, which is graced by two songs, is a relic of some third writer's participation. It may have been specially added to accommodate the musicians. II.ii-II.iii : As noted above, II.ii is unmistakably Websterian, with a steady stream of his linguistic markers. Even the two instances of to th' are significant, each being followed by a consonant. So too is the instance in II.iii, where the evidence for Webster is sparse, but is countered by nothing pointing to Heywood. The contraction At's=at his on D2 is an especially clear pointer to Webster. Moreover, the contraction to'ave , which I have found in neither Webster nor Heywood, links the strongly Websterian II.ii (D1, Compositor B) with the less Websterian II.iii (D4v, Compositor A). Another possible trace of Webster in II.iii is the spelling I'ld for I should on D3v; this occurs several times in The Duchess of Malfi (where it may be Crane's, though you'ld and yee'ld appear in The White Devil , C3v and G4), but not in Heywood's plays. III.i : Here the absence of Webster markers suggests Heywood's hand, and the single occurrence of whilst tends to confirm it. The 't contraction in this scene is the very common is't , which could as well be Heywood's as Webster's. III.ii-III.iii : Act III, scene ii exhibits a wealth of diverse indications of Webster, including eight examples of i'th' , two of 's , one of yon's , two of for't , the Websterian colloquialisms look you and by my life , and the connective while . The 't contractions are quite varied, including fear't , defer't , hear't , and obtain't . Supporting this evidence is a variation in the naming of Corbulo. In the first twenty lines of II.i (C2) and the first seventeen lines of III.i (D4v-E1) he is Corbulo . in speech prefixes, and in III.iv (F3-F4) his prefixes are abbreviated to Corb . Table 4 supports the generally held view that II.i, III.i, and III.iv are Heywood's scenes. When Corbulo speaks in III.ii, in contrast, he is Clown. or Clow . (E2v-E3v). Admittedly, pages E2v-E3 were set by Compositor B, while all but one of the Corbulo . pages were set by Compositor A, but B did set Corbula . ( sic ) in II.i at the top of C2v. The difference in naming is probably authorial, rather than compositorial, Webster not caring about this minor character's name. It seems to me obvious enough that the Clown of III.ii has a markedly more satirical, Websterian vein than the amiable punster of the other scenes. In the very short III.iii deliver't and i'th' point to Webster, and perhaps outweigh the single Heywood marker, tush . III.iv : The return to the name Corbulo is almost the only clue to the authorship of this scene. There is nothing to suggest Webster; the one instance of for't could easily be Heywood's. IV.i-IV.ii : The Websterian markers in IV.i are not particularly frequent: i'th' three times, to th' before a consonant, and the expletive by my life . The 't contractions are of the kind that Heywood might have used. However the six speeches beginning within the line associate this scene with the markedly Websterian II.ii and III.ii, and the formality of this trial scene might have inhibited the use of many contracted forms. One further link between presumptively Websterian scenes is the exclamation by the gods (10 times) or O the gods (4 times) or variant (4 times). This represents a rather perfunctory contribution to the Roman flavour of a play decorously devoid of the more colourful Jacobean expletives. The scenes in which evocations of "the gods" appear are II.ii (7 examples), III.ii (3), IV.i (5), IV.ii (1), and V.i (2). So this is another feature of IV.i connecting it with II.ii and III.ii. Uncertain signs of Webster in IV.ii are limited to the opening and closing lines. The scene begins with a dialogue between two soldiers, in which 'tween occurs as well as betwixt , and there are three 't contractions suggestive of Webster— see't , hav't , and know't . Some thirty lines from the end of the scene occurs for't , and the last seven lines have while and Be't . V.i-V.ii : The final Act is scarcely more Websterian than the first in its linguistic forms. The connectives are Heywoodian. The sprinkling of Websterisms in V.i are not among his most distinctive, but i'th' , a couple of uses of to th' before a consonant, two instances of for't , and the colloquialism in sooth combine to make Webster's participation in the scene probable. Mixed authorship seems to be indicated. In V.ii the sole sign of Webster, but a clear one, is Stop's sixteen lines from the end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conclusion To summarize: The original Quarto of Appius and Virginia was probably printed by Thomas Maxey. Henry Glapthorne's Revenge for Honour can be identified as likely to have been another product of his shop. The stints of two compositors in Appius can be distinguished with some precision and confidence, and the division is consistent with the skeleton pattern. When linguistic and bibliographical discriminators, derived from study of Webster's three unaided plays and fifteen plays by Heywood, are applied to Appius and Virginia , substantial evidence of Webster's hand is found in II.ii, III.ii, and IV.i, and less persuasive evidence in I.ii, II.iii, III.iii, IV.ii, V.i, and the very end of V.ii. The data concerning authorship are not appreciably affected by contrasting compositorial preferences. It is clear that Webster is not the sole author of the play. The data presented here cannot demonstrate that the second playwright is Heywood, who has no really distinctive linguistic preferences, so that his hand manifests itself in the absence of Webster's forms rather than in features uniquely his own, but they are consistent with Heywood's authorship and part-authorship of several scenes. Lucas (III, 137) lists twenty-two words in Appius that are typical of Heywood's latinate diction. These are distributed thus: I.iii (2), I.iv (4), II.i (1), II.iii (2), III.i (1), IV.i (1), IV.ii (3), V.ii (8). Thus the scenes that are most strongly Websterian on the linguistic and bibliographical evidence, II.ii, III.ii, and IV.i, contain only one such word in 1012 lines, leaving twenty-one within the remaining 1579 lines. The three Heywoodian words in IV.ii, which I have claimed to be at least partly Webster's (pointers to his hand accumulate within the first and last forty lines or so), are confined to a short passage, lines 79-102. It cannot be coincidental that Heywood's diction is prevalent in portions of the text free from Webster's linguistic traces. Appius and Virginia is, then, a joint composition. We cannot know whether Heywood and Webster worked in collaboration, or one dramatist revised the other's play. But the final product is an interesting illustration of a phenomenon that has been observed in other Elizabethan and Jacobean plays of dual or multiple authorship—the partial submerging of the more idiosyncratic traits of markedly different dramatists as they contribute to a worthwhile drama with its own distinctive quality. Heywood is an unsophisticated dealer in broad humour and in emotional and moral blacks and whites, "a facile and sometimes felicitous purveyor of goods to the popular taste," as T. S. Eliot described him ( Elizabethan Essays [1934], p. 102). He is also jingoistic, and has the popular writer's talent for offering titillation and orthodox piety at the same time. His best play, A Woman Killed with Kindness , is a competent bourgeois melodrama, pregnant with potential ironies and subtleties which a Middleton, for example, would have exploited to the full, but of which Heywood seems blithely unaware. In Appius his essential simple-mindedness, which is not without its positive aspects, moderates his cerebral partner's tortuous art. As Lucas remarked (III, 146), under the influence of Heywood and with his help, "a better brain than Heywood's has here produced a work that at times seems to revert to the manner of a quarter of a century before, when its part-model, Julius Caesar , first appeared on a stage that had not yet lost its sense of directness and simplicity."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 "The Authorship of the Later Appius and Virginia ," MLR , 8 (1913), 433-453; expanded as an appendix to his book, John Webster and the Elizabethan Drama (1917). Other references in this paragraph are to Lagarde, John Webster (Toulouse, 1968), I, 299; Murray, A Study of John Webster (The Hague, 1969), p. 238; and Sternlicht, John Webster's Imagery and the Webster Canon (Salzburg, 1972), pp. 192-193. Murray's table of contracted forms in Appius is wildly inaccurate, partly because the columns for i'th ' and ' tis have been transposed. 2 The total seven is derived from examination of Paul G. Morrison's Index of Printers, Publishers and Booksellers (1955). In the years immediately after Maxey's death, John Grismond ("J.G.") appears to have been Marriot's main printer: five Marriot publications were printed by "J.G." in 1657-58. Thomas Roycroft also worked quite frequently for Marriot within the period in which Appius was printed. Maxey's books are the only ones showing typographical links to Appius . 3 The mixture of ordinary and swash italic capitals for speech prefixes is very similar: note the swash M , swash A , and occasional large C in each. A narrow lower case roman "a" appears frequently in both plays. 4 There is a head title, instead of a headline, on B1, and as the text ends on I3 this page is the last to have a headline. But I(o) takes over its three headlines from H(o), and I(i) its two from H(i). Continuity from F(i) and F(o) to H(i) is not certain. Differences in the heaviness of the inking make identification difficult, but despite a major alteration to the spacing of the headline, the lettering on H3v is probably the same as that on F1v and F2v, while the headline of F3 and F4 appears to have been used for H2, and that of F3v and F4v for H1v. If this is so, F(i) was probably printed before F(o), as on F4v, H1v, and I1v the running title is slightly closer to the left-hand margin than on F3v. 5 My rule-of-thumb criterion for "a decisive preference" was as follows: the test words should occur at least twice and the ratio of preferred to unpreferred spellings should be not less than three to one. 6 For -ness/-nesse in two cells the expected frequencies are below 5, so that chisquare probabilities, even when Yates's correction is used, are suspect; but the lowest expected frequency is above 3.5 and the chi-square of 7.8, 1 d.f., is well beyond the 0.01 level of significance, which requires a chi-square value of at least 6.635. There is a description of the chi-squared test in Anthony Kenny, The Computation of Style: An Introduction to Statistics for Students of Literature and Humanities (1982), pp. 110-119. 7 Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses . . . Commentary (1931), p. 207. Greg notes John of Bordeaux as a possible exception to these general rules. 8 I do not, of course, mean to imply that marginal speech prefixes and horizontal rules between speakers are to be expected in a Quarto printed from a prompt book. These features would be transformed by standard printing-house practice. 9 See Peter B. Murray, "The Collaboration of Dekker and Webster in Northward Ho and Westward Ho ," PBSA , 56 (1962), 482-486; David J. Lake, The Canon of Thomas Middleton's Plays (1975), pp. 47-49; Tony Halsall, "The Collaboration of Dekker and Webster in Westward Ho and Northward Ho ," PBSA , 72 (1978) 65-68. The linguistic and bibliographical evidence cited by these scholars apportions the plays in much the same way as Frederick E. Pierce's "three-syllable Latin word test," described in The Collaboration of Webster and Dekker (1909). Our ignorance about chronology and about Webster's part in the later collaborate plays is far from absolute. Lucas does not indulge in what Bentley stigmatizes as "sage pronunciamentos about Webster's artistic development." He simply argues, through ordinary procedures of criticism, reinforced by metrical data, that Appius fits more comfortably at the beginning or end of Webster's career, especially the end, and finds allusions in the play that appear to confirm a late date of composition. Ants Oras, Pause Patterns in Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama (1960), accepting Lucas's assignment of scenes to Webster in Anything for a Quiet Life , The Fair Maid of the Inn , A Cure for a Cuckold , and Appius and Virginia , remarks that Lucas's dating of these plays is supported by examination of the line-split patterns of Webster's share of their verse: "if Lucas's attributions and chronology are accepted, Webster's line-split patterns are seen to evolve in a strikingly consistent and natural manner" (p. 32). This claim acquires decided significance within the context of Oras's subtle and sensitive prosodic analysis. Examination of Oras's figures and graphs (pp. 58, 86) strongly suggests that Appius belongs to the end, rather than to the beginning, of Webster's career. Oras's data concern quite different metrical features from those considered by Lucas. We should not be unduly distrustful of arguments from metre: each one of Shakespeare's plays can be placed within its right period on metrical evidence alone. The main features of Webster's linguistic pattern, as described below, recur in the scenes that Lucas assigns to him in the collaborate plays. 10 Hoy, "The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon," SB , 8 (1956) -15 (1962); Lake, The Canon of Thomas Middleton's Plays (1975). See also MacD. P. Jackson, Studies in Attribution: Middleton and Shakespeare (Salzburg, 1979), where reference to other studies of this kind may be found. 11 Heywood's avoidance of has and does is not, of course, complete, but no play has more than a few instances, and hath and doth always greatly predominate. In Webster's share of the Ho plays he shows the strong preference for hath and doth that can be seen in WD and DM . 12 "The Printing of John Webster's Plays (I)," SB , 6 (1954), 117-140. 13 Heywood's peculiarities are described in the introductions to the Malone Society Reprints of The Captives , ed. Arthur Brown (1953), and The Escapes of Jupiter , ed. Henry D. Janzen (1977). 14 SB , 12 (1959), 103. There are 3 i'th' and 2 's within the 330 lines of Webster's elegy to Prince Henry, A Monumental Column (1613). 15 The exclusive use of between in The Silver Age and The Brazen Age suggests that both plays may have been set from transcripts in the hand of a scribe prejudiced against betwixt —unless Heywood passed through a brief phase of preferring between. 16 The rarity of Webster's o'th' and a'th' in the Quarto requires explanation. As o'th' occurs in the second line of the play, and at th' in the fourteenth, it seems possible that Compositor B, after showing initial tolerance of o'th' and partial tolerance of a'th' , normalized to of the , and that Compositor A normalized throughout his stints. Late Quartos often fail to preserve earlier seventeenth-century forms. Another possibility is that the whole manuscript was a transcript of the joint papers, made either by Heywood or by a scribe. As amongst outnumbers among in all Heywood's plays, while Webster's preference for this form may have been less compulsive, it should be recorded that amongst occurs in Appius in I.ii, III.iv (5 times on F3v), and IV.ii (twice).</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The procedures for proof-correcting English books of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are still imperfectly understood, partly because we seem to have developed the vexatious habit of occasionally taking partial knowledge for whole truths. Variables such as the subject matter of the book under investigation, the kind of press at which it was printed, the author's attitude toward the book, the printer's ability and willingness to pay for professional correction, and so on, often prevent useful and accurate generalizations about the topic. Although most scholars of the period are aware that a six-penny play printed at a London commercial house would ordinarily be far less attentively corrected than a Latin treatise on the perils of Papism printed at the Oxford University Press, the point seems to have fallen more into the realm of faith than of demonstrated fact. It is the purpose here to sort out the variables and to clear the air of some of the misconceptions which have arisen from the application of principles belonging to some classes of books to all classes of books. In 1935 Percy Simpson declared that one of the most "mischievous" errors in modern thinking about the production of early books was "the assumption that authors did not read proofs." 1 The first chapter of his book contains an impressive array of authors' apologies for failing to attend the press to read proof, failures which resulted in more than the usual number of errors having crept into the text. Simpson drew the natural conclusion that these disclaimers amount to testimony that authors did commonly read proof, or at least that they were expected to do so. He allowed, however, that in some cases "the main motive which prompted this scrupulous proof-reading was the theological purpose of the book" (p. 3). It is this qualifying factor which has not received enough attention in recent years and the neglect of which has led to fairly widespread acceptance of Simpson's general conclusion that "ample evidence has now been accumulated to show that proof-reading by authors was a common practice in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; that it was, as common sense would suggest, a business precaution which safe-guarded the interests of both author and publisher" (p. 49). The limited truth in this conclusion is that authorial proof-reading was common practice in those cases in which the author and the publisher had, in fact, interests to safe-guard, in cases, that is, of such things as legal books or theological works, in which significant errors could bring the authors and publishers afoul of the law. In the proof-reading of trade books of much less consequence, such as pamphlets, almanacs, ballads, plays, and the like (what we might call popular literature), economic concerns or matters of pure expediency often displaced the common-sense desire for an accurate text which might otherwise have led authors and publishers and even printers to desire authorial correction. Fredson Bowers, certainly a man familiar with a great many dramatic quartos, has remarked that "the keen concern for meaning manifested by the proof-reader of an early dramatic text is usually a figment of the critic's imagination." 2 And even more than this, "the automatic assumption is surely wrong that every forme of cheap commercial printing was necessarily proofread. Any editor of Elizabethan play quartos is familiar with some formes in which the typographical errors are so gross as to make it seem impossible to suppose that these formes had been read" (p. 136, n.1). Obviously, Bowers' findings do not square at all with Simpson's contention that authors commonly read proof. 3 The discrepancy, however, does not justify the generalization opposite to Simpson's that "proofreading by authors was not usual before the eighteenth century; indeed, early proofreading normally consisted of a reading (by the master printer or his assistant) of one of the first sheets printed off, without recourse to the copy, and marking any apparent errors for correction." 4 This, like Simpson's, is a partial truth. Simpson's data shows us beyond a doubt that proof-reading by authors was indeed quite usual prior to the eighteenth century, but only for certain kinds of books printed under certain conditions. What these conditions were may be seen by examining the reasons behind the emergence of the Learned Presses at Oxford and at Cambridge and by looking in a systematic way at the proof-correction of several different classes of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century books to clarify the distinctions between them and to show how and why the procedures of proof-reading differed so widely between each class. The nature and purpose of the printing-house had a decided influence upon the attitude toward the degree of accuracy the book should attain. The Press at Oxford University did not become an official arm of the University itself until late in the seventeenth century, but steps toward making it so had begun at least a century earlier. The impulse behind the movement was the desire to create a Learned Press, one that would provide a corrective to the sorry, mercenary houses in London. Several of the documents relating to the history of the development of the Press at Oxford betray an undisguised disdain for the quality of work going forward in London; indeed, the slightness of the books being printed there formed the basis of the argument for establishing a Learned Press in the first place. Of course, not all books printed in London during the period were ephemera; on the contrary, a vast amount of learned printing, in Latin and in English, went forward in the city. In 1595, Andrew Maunsell, a London bookseller, assembled lists of the important books printed in the vernacular. In The First Part of the Catalogue of English printed Bookes: Which concerneth such matters of Diuinitie, as haue bin either written in our owne Tongue, or translated out of anie other language: And haue bin published, to the glory of God, and edification of the Church of Christ in England (London: John Windet, 1595), Maunsell compiled hundreds of titles of books, most printed in London, which he grouped under the headings of "Diuinitie," "Bible," "Catechismes," "Prayers," and "Sermons"; in The Seconde parte of the Catalogue . . . which concerneth the Sciences Mathematicall, as Arithmetick, Geometrie, Astronomie, Astrologie, Musick, the Arte of Warre and Nauigation . . . (London: James Roberts, 1595), he enumerated titles dealing with the secular sciences. (The two Parts are available in facsimile, ed. D. F. Foxon, Gregg Press, 1965.) In two essays treating information garnered from Latin books printed in England (about which more will be said later), James Binns examined a total of 75 volumes, 62 of which were printed at London, seven at Oxford, and six at Cambridge. Hence, it would be a mistake to draw a simplistic, radical distinction between mere trivia printed in London and serious works printed at the University Presses. Nevertheless, as a casual glance at any random pages of The Short-Title Catalogue reveals, thousands of "trifles" of the popular sort mentioned earlier poured off the presses at London, and, in their zeal to establish Learned Presses, the champions of scholarly printing naturally focused their attacks chiefly upon the ephemera, though shoddy performance in the printing of learned works in London did not entirely escape their condemnation. The bias is evident in an anonymous, sixteenth-century "brief for the University's Chancellor, Robert Dudley, first Earl of Leicester, to plead with the Queen for her leave to print at Oxford," a document which puts the matter succinctly: "Finally, whereas nearly the whole of the kingdom abounds in frivolous trifles written in English, tending rather to corrupt morality than to any sound and serious education, the young might by these means be attracted to something healthier and more advanced." 5 As trivial, licentious stuff in the vernacular poured off the presses in London, the more "important" manuscripts, those treating the classics, law, religion, and philosophy, were in danger of extinction for want of publishers and printers willing to preserve them. Furthermore, as the dissemination of such works declined, the quality of learning and skill in the Latin language likewise began to decline, in the view of the scholars, to abysmally low levels. One prime reason, therefore, for establishing a Learned Press at Oxford was "the desire for the destruction of barbarism," which amounted to the desire to forestall the decline of proper Latin and to stem the rising tide of frivolous trifles in the vernacular (Carter, pp. 9-10). The major obstacle to Learned printing was expense; it was a financially disastrous undertaking. The London presses indulged in the production of trivialities in the mother tongue because such items appealed to a large market and because the presses were in business to make money. They were self-supporting commercial houses, as, indeed, was the Oxford Press itself before its attachment to the University was made official. The problem for the Learned Press, of course, was that the market for learned books in foreign languages was much more limited, and therefore less profitable, than that for broadside ballads, pamphlets, and plays in English. That profit should be necessary to survival nevertheless infuriated Archbishop Laud, who undertook the establishment of the Learned Press at Oxford in the first half of the seventeenth century. The terms in which he couched his statute providing for an overseer of the Press indicate an impatient contempt for the goings on in London: Since the experience of the trade shows that these mechanic craftsmen for the most part look for profit and saving of labour, caring not at all for beauty of letters or good and seemly workmanship, and bundle out any kind of rough and incorrect productions to the light of day, be it provided by this statute that an Architypographus shall preside over the University's public printing office, which is to be established in a building specially devoted to this purpose (Carter, p. 31). Of the character and accomplishments of this Architypographus more shall be said later, but for the present it is sufficient to say that the tone of the statute is remarkable for its hostility toward all things which smacked of profit, particularly as the profit was made at the expense of learning and accuracy. For Laud it was the profit motive which produced the deformed work, the "rough and incorrect productions," in the London printing-houses, an implication which will be of great consequence in understanding the procedures of proof-correction in the commercial establishments. The Oxford project went on feet, not on wheels. When Fell took over Laud's position as champion of the Learned Press later in the century, the case had altered not one whit. In 1670/1 he wrote to Issac Vossius in Holland: "We have it in mind, provided the Vice-Chancellor agrees, and all goes well, to set up in this place a press freed from mercenary artifices, which will serve not so much to make profits for the booksellers as to further the interests and convenience of scholars" (Carter, p. 61). All did not go well, either for Laud or for Fell, for although the Press devoted itself to printing not only Bibles but works in Latin, Greek, and Oriental languages, it fell afoul of the inevitable financial troubles that such a project could be expected to encounter. Consequently, the Press was forced to print some items of more popular appeal, such as almanacs, to keep itself solvent. The Stationers Company of London, however, viewed such efforts as a threat to their monopoly on printing in the city; as a result, some very complicated arrangements were made whereby the University Press received "forbearance" payments, money paid it by the Stationers in exchange for an agreement not to print such books as would compete with those in the London market. Still, it was not enough; the Press at times resorted to printing works not covered by the forbearances simply to produce enough revenue to keep the Press operating. Irked by the apparent breach of faith, the Stationers repeatedly attempted, often successfully, to legislate greater and greater restrictions upon the Press until by 1692 at the latest, "it was the view of the Stationers that the two Universities should confine their publishing to learned books" (Carter, p. 158). Much the same situation obtained at the Cambridge University Press, which, though it did not receive official sanction from the University until very late in the seventeenth century, had nevertheless occupied itself with the printing of learned books since its inception. Not surprisingly, the Cambridge Press encountered the same kinds of difficulties that vexed the Press at Oxford. D. F. McKenzie has pointed out that "in the very nature of things learned works of this kind were produced by and for a small minority group; compared with the staple wares of the book trade, they were never very numerous; they took a long time to prepare; requiring careful correction, they passed through the Press more slowly than cheap popular works; they were too costly to produce for their undertakers to make much of a profit; and, in any case, being slow sellers, they lacked ready backers." 6 From the business perspective, the Cambridge Press does not appear to have been any more successful a venture than its counterpart at Oxford, and, indeed, Cambridge was also obliged to make arrangements with the Stationers in order to remain afloat. Despite the risks and the bleak prospects of financial success, the Cambridge Press too persisted in its efforts to preserve high quality in scholarly printing, partly from the same motives which impelled the Oxford Press. As an anonymous writer in 1662 put the case, The University'es priviledge is looked upon as a trust for the publick good, &amp; theire printing of these bookes will force the Londoners to printe something tolerably true (else they shall not be able to sell while better may be had from Camb) who otherwise looking meerly at gaine will not care how Corruptly they print, witnes the 200 blasphemy's wch Mr B[uck] found in their bibles; &amp; the millions of faults in theire school bookes, increasing in every edition. . . . (McKenzie, I, 5) The writer's confidence in the power of high-quality printing at Cambridge to inspire improvements in London was obviously misplaced, but once again the idea of a Learned Press was based upon the conviction that the London printers were careless, mercenary creatures incapable and unwilling to bestow upon their works the attention necessary to produce accurate, reliable texts even of important books. There needed to be a new conceptual as well as financial approach to printing if scholarship and the learned works were to survive. The whole body of evidence from the records of the University Presses indicates that they both regarded themselves as exceptional printing-houses. They undertook a serious charge in the name of scholarship and the preservation of cultural heritage, and in consequence they exhibited an attitude toward profit which differed radically from that of their London cousins. The wealth was in the learned works, the profit in the dissemination of knowledge. And not only were they dedicated to the preservation and advancement of learning, but they were bent upon producing books of higher quality and accuracy than those turned out by the Londoners, even by those who were engaged in printing learned works. In his introduction (I, xiii), McKenzie declares that "the University Press, it is shown, was in some respects untypical, but it would be misreading the evidence so to regard the whole undertaking and therefore the invaluable witness it bears to the organization and methods of hand printing. The people who ran it were professionals and, as judged by their works, competent." The statement is somewhat misleading because it tends too far to level the distinctions which did obtain between the Learned Presses and the London houses; it is important to distinguish those "respects" in which the University Press was "untypical" because those are the features which will help to explain the differences in practical printing procedures employed at each kind of press. That the people who ran the University Press were "professionals" is one of those features, because the most damning charge levelled repeatedly at the workers in the London houses is that they were not professionals; rather, they were craftsmen, as Laud called them, tradesmen engaged in a business for the purpose of earning a living. Their entire perspective on the office of printing was therefore governed by a different attitude toward means and ends. The end of printing for the Learned Presses was the book itself; for the London presses, the book was a means to the end of turning a profit. The difference between a profession and a trade is precisely the difference between a Learned Press and a Commercial press. One of the practical consequences of the differing perspectives on the aims of printing is that the scholarly attainments of the men setting up and correcting type for works in Latin, Greek, and Oriental languages would naturally have to be considerably greater than those of men composing and proofing works in the vernacular. The overseers of the Learned Presses recognized the problem, of course, and they sought men capable of printing the kinds of books they had in hand. It has long been recognized that the quality of English printing, including type-founding, paper-making, press-construction, and type-setting itself, lagged far behind the quality of continental printing. 7 As a result, many of the material goods used in printing were imported from Holland, Germany, and France. Sometimes the workmen themselves were brought from abroad because, accustomed to working with better materials and to adhering to higher standards, they were more accomplished in all aspects of the trade. Printing having had a longer time to develop on the continent, the workers were better educated, more responsible, and more competent. It is not surprising, then, to find the Learned Presses employing a higher proportion of foreign workmen than the London Printers did. In the mid-sixteenth-century records it is fairly easy to trace the influx of foreign workers because each one had to be admitted formally to the trade, which meant that his name was entered in the Stationers' Register. By the late seventeenth century the regulations concerning aliens, though not relaxed, were more commonly ignored, making it more difficult "to assess with any accuracy the true proportion" of workmen moving from the continent to England (McKenzie, I, 61). The records of the Cambridge Press nevertheless indicate a preference for foreign employees: With its Dutch overseer [Crownfield], however, and the favour of its prime promoter [Bentley] well inclined towards continental achievement, the Cambridge Press might well be expected to prove hospitable to journeymen from abroad; and it is no surprise to find among its compositors the names of Willem de Groot, John Delie, Christian Michaelis, and Johannes Muckeus, or among its pressmen the name of Albert Coldenhoff. A Johannes Friedrich Graevius also made a brief appearance at the Press in August 1701 when he laid two and prepared four pair of Greek cases (McKenzie, I, 61). These men were French, Dutch, and German, and they represent all offices in the craft or art of printing: compositors, pressmen, and the corrector, Crownfield himself. It is perhaps belaboring the obvious to point out that the workmen had to be able to read and understand the language they were setting into type, but it is a point necessary to help distinguish the nature of the corrector and his duties as he performed them at Oxford or Cambridge from his character and function as he performed them in London, depending, of course, upon the nature of the book in question; although a London house could hire a specialist proof-reader to attend to a particular scholarly book, it is unlikely that each London printer retained a full-time learned corrector, since the need of him would have been merely occasional. Rather, we are concerned with the regular house corrector in London compared to the regular proofreader at the Learned Presses. And as late as 1708 English printing quality had not yet caught up to the continental standards, for Bentley was complaining to Newton that "Our English compositors are ignorant &amp; print Latin books as they are used to do English ones; if they are not set right by one used to observe the beauties of ye best printing abroad" (McKenzie, I, 54). The English workmen, those employed extensively in the commercial houses, did not have the qualifications necessary to set and correct learned books. An excellent early example of the disaster that could befall a book printed by inadequately trained workmen is afforded by this apology which precedes Florio's Firste Fruites (1578): "Gentle Reader, for such faultes which have escaped the Authors naughty pen, the Compositors wavering hande, the Correctors dasling, and the Printers presse, we desire thee courteously to amend, for surely the Author writes scarce good English, and a ragged hand with all, and the Compositor understandes no Italian." 8 In order to forestall such catastrophe in the more difficult task of printing learned books, the promoters of both the Oxford and the Cambridge Presses made provision in their plans for what they called an Architypographus. In Laud's statute, De typographis Universitati (1633-34), we find a sketch of the ideal character and duties of this officer of the Press: He shall be a man thoroughly acquainted with Greek and Latin literature and deeply learned in philological studies. His functions shall be to superintend the printing done in that place and to see that the material and equipment, that is to say the paper, presses, type, and other implements of this workshop shall be the best of their kind. In all work that comes from the University's public printing office he shall determine size of type, quality of paper, and width of margins, correct correctors' mistakes, and take unremitting care of the good appearance and fine workmanship of the product (Carter, p. 31). This is no small charge; not only was the Architypographus to be responsible for checking and correcting the work of the regular correctors, but he was also to see to it that the overall quality of the printing, in materials and workmanship, compared favorably with the continental standard. Cambridge too was careful to provide for its Press such a general supervisor: "The Architypographus was a servant of the university, corrected, prescribed the size of letter, etc., and had general oversight of the equipment" (McKenzie, 1, 97). Despite these precautions, things were not all sweetness and light, at least at Oxford. The ideal of the Architypographus was realized for only a short time; "established as the supervisor of printing at Oxford, controlling the academic printing-house, its equipment, staffing, and materials, a corrector of copy and a superior proof-reader, he soon became little more than a runner of errands between the Delegates and the printers and an accountant before being suppressed in all but name" (Carter, p. 143). Evidently what led to the demise of the office was a power struggle between the Delegates of the Press and the Architypographus, who, after all, regarded it his duty to run the entire operation. It appears that the first Architypographus at Oxford, Samuel Clarke, who took office in 1658, was not only properly qualified in accordance with Laud's statute, but also took the duties of his position as seriously as Laud would have expected. He was "a student of Hebrew and Arabic who had borne a share in the correction of the London Polyglot Bible and had plans for more polyglot publishing. He was energetic and earned from Anthony Wood the character of 'a most useful and necessary person' to the University. He interested himself in the mechanics of printing, catalogued the Greek types brought to Oxford in Laud's time, and made inquiries in Holland for matrices and a letter-cutter" (Carter, p. 143). In short, he took control of the Press in all seriousness, a move which threatened the control which the Delegates and the Vice-Chancellor felt more properly belonged to them. That the Delegates grew weary of this Architypographus in short order is evidenced by a note in the records a mere eleven years later when Thomas Bennett succeeded Clarke as the corrector of the Press. Lest he "might try to be a sort of architypographus, the partners [i.e. Delegates] noted: 'Corrector not to intermeddle in any thing, but to mynde his businesse'" (Carter, p. 145). Though the Oxford Press kept Bennett tethered, they nevertheless did retain this learned corrector. And all indications are that the Delegates were satisfied with the quality of work turned out by their pressmen and compositors, though Fell, when he took over the Press in the 1690s, soon found himself nettled by the workmen's attitude toward the enterprise: "To make them always attend their work, is I think beyond any Skill: Printers having a peculiar obligation to be idle, as being paid for it: Holiday money being a certain stile in their Bills" (Carter, p. 66). Despite their superior skills and talents, the men appear to have approached their tasks in the same spirit as their fellow tradesmen in London approached theirs. Hence, as far as attitudes, procedures, wages, and customs are concerned, Fell's remarks about the Oxford employees lend support to McKenzie's claim that "the workmen of the Cambridge University Press, notwithstanding their Dutch master and their own mixed nationalities and experience, were probably not unlike the journeymen and apprentices who made up the staffs of most small, two-press printing-houses of the seventeenth century. Their customs, as far as the evidence goes, seem to have been much the same as those Moxon mentions; and their rewards in years when production was reasonably well up were probably fairly similar to those obtained in London" (I, 93). The real issue, though, is not one of wages and customs but of the quality of the work they produced when they did, in fact, work. The judges we must rely upon to assess the quality of the workmanship are the authors of learned works themselves. The workers at the Learned Presses certainly made errors, and authors apologized profusely for them, but we do not find the kinds of vitriolic remarks directed at these men that authors frequently aimed at their counterparts in London. Some of the London houses were engaged in the printing of learned books, and, since the difficulties to be met and overcome would necessarily be the same no matter where the book was printed, the procedures for printing and correcting ought to be equivalent. The quality of the results, however, would be directly related to the abilities of the men printing the book. Bishop Montagu, who had his Analecta ecclesiasticarum exercitationem printed in London in 1622, is one witness to the degree of success the city printers attained. Montagu's work is especially significant because we receive from him the same complaints about English workmen that generated the impulse toward establishing Learned Presses in the first place; in his preface he writes, "On top of the six hundred difficulties with which we are afflicted we have unfortunately had to put up with the stupidity and stinginess of the printers. For they are accustomed to work for profit, they only following a mercenary trade. And so they load waggons and carts with two-penny ha'penny garbage. They have no taste for serious things. Latin writings are not read, and as for Greek, they exclaim against them as if they were heretical." 9 This vituperous preface is a fair indication that conditions in the London printing-houses were not those of the University Presses even when the commercial houses were in fact printing learned works. In George Blackwell's Declaratio motuum ac turbationum , printed at London in 1601 by Thomas Creede (probably), we find "another complaint that an author had to use a printer who was not very good at Latin," and in John Vicar's Decapla in psalmos (London: Robert Young, 1639) there appears "a comment that errors have occurred in Syriac and Arabic words because the printer is not accustomed to them." 10 Montagu, Blackwell, and Vicars, like Laud, saw that the London workmen did not always possess the knowledge, skill, and expertise to print books in foreign languages; worse, Montagu found them altogether unconcerned about their failings because they did not take important books seriously in all cases. And the culprit, as Montagu saw it, is again the profit motive. The workmen at the Learned Presses were carefully selected precisely to combat the "stupidity" and the "mercenary" considerations which so plagued the production of books in the city. It is unlikely that the printer of Montagu's book went to the expense of securing learned compositors and correctors versed in the classical languages; if he hired temporary help, his employees did not much care to exercise their talents. The best solution to the kinds of woes that beset Montagu, Blackwell, and Vicars was, of course, for the author himself to attend the press to read the proofs, and there is far more evidence that authors did so for scholarly works, particularly those in foreign languages, than for any other kind of book, whether printed commercially at London or at either University Press. From his first collection of prefaces detailing the trials and tribulations of printing 47 Latin books ranging in date from 1543 to 1638, Binns concludes: Piecing together the evidence, we may surmise that a typical Latin book passed through the press in the following stages. A fair copy of the work to be printed was first made by a scribe in the employ of the printer. The work was then passed to the compositor or compositors, who might number as many as four, who set the book up. The author was usually present during the printing of the book, and proofs, both first and second, were read by the author and the press corrector. Errata which were subsequently discovered were then listed for the reader's attention, a distinction between major and minor errors, or substantive and non-substantive variants, often being drawn, the authors in particular displaying a precise awareness of the difference that the omission, addition, or transposition of even a single letter or mark of punctuation can make to the meaning. The author and/or printer then gave vent to some final comments on the quality of the printing and the difficulties encountered, whilst, after the book was printed, any remaining errors in the body of the text might be corrected in ink before the book was issued (Binns, 32 [1977], 1-2). One cannot help noticing the high proportion of responsibility for getting things right that falls on the shoulders of the author. And indeed it is from these books and books like them that we get most of our apologies for authors' having failed to attend the press to read proofs, with the result, as Bennett remarks, "that Elizabethan books, whether first or later editions, often carry a formidable errata list" (p. 286). Once the author was removed, by illness, inconvenience, or business concerns, from the orderly process of the printing, all kinds of havoc was likely to ensue, as the authors never tired of telling the Gentle Reader. At least this was so in the London printing-shops. McKenzie (I, 152) suggests that it was not the case at Cambridge because the learned correctors could fill in more successfully for the absent author than the less well-educated correctors at London could do. It was even more necessary to have capable correctors at Cambridge because the distance from London meant an inconvenience to the authors, who were thus less frequently able to proof-read their own works there than at London. Furthermore, "the existence of the young band of scholars who acted as correctors of the Press may have minimized . . . the primary need for an author to see his proofs at all" (McKenzie, I, 84), the primary need being the absence of an army of scholar-correctors battling the monster Error in London. That the regularly retained correctors in the city were less dependable is clear from what we are told happened to a book when the author was for some reason unable to oversee the printing himself. Montagu was certainly unimpressed with the diligence and care that the workmen accorded his Analecta , and Scipione Gentili, whose In xxv Davidis psalmos epicae paraphrasis was printed in London by John Wolfe in 1584, had some complaints about the workmanship precede his errata list: "Through the great carelessness of the man who set this book up by formes, it has come about that neither the numbering of psalms, nor the page numbers, are correct. Although this carelessness would indeed be intolerable in a major work, it ought to be considered as a triviality in a work as slight as this, which can be read almost at a single glance, and it is not worth reproach. But the errors of commission and omission made by the same man in the poems themselves ought to be corrected and restored thus" (Binns, 32 [1977], 11). Wolfe's compositor would no doubt have cast either Laud or Fell into a catatonic stupor, but it is important to note that the errors in pagination and numbering had nothing to do with the nature of the book being printed; the compositor had simply gotten the imposition wrong. But the same compositor also failed to set the text accurately, and this Gentili is not disposed to forgive; despite his disclaimer that his work is a "slight" one, not worth the intensive scrutiny of correction that a "major work" would command, and despite his attempt to adopt a casual tone, his annoyance over the shoddy production is fairly evident. That Gentili prepared the errata list from final printed sheets which seem to have shocked him indicates that he could not have read proof himself. Whether the book was not proof-read at all, which seems likely considering the grossness of error, or whether it was read by an incompetent corrector, the results did not please the author; it was the occurrence of just this kind of accident which induced Laud to plead for the establishment of a Learned Press. Binns's translations and interpretations of the Latin prefaces are valuable aids to a better understanding of printing in the period, but Binns, like Simpson and Thorpe, generalizes just a little too far. Having pointed out that the printers of Latin works printed English books as well, he avers that "there is, however, no reason to doubt that the same processes applied to the printing of books in English, to those works at any rate that were seriously valued by their author or printer." That is as far as the conclusion can legitimately go; Binns overstates the case slightly when he drops the qualification regarding the "serious value" of the book in question to conclude more generally, "The detailed record of [the Latin authors'] battles with the press and their experiences with the proofs militates against any notion that Elizabethan printing was a slap-dash affair, but accords well enough with the suppositions of common sense and the assumptions about Elizabethan printing arrived at by analogy with eighteenth-century practice" (32 [1977], 24). That is but one more partial truth. Surely Laud, Fell, and Bentley were not tilting at windmills. Just how slap-dash an affair Elizabethan (and seventeenth-century) printing could actually be is everywhere attested to by editors (for whom Bowers, quoted earlier, shall for reasons of scope be allowed to speak) of such works as were not seriously valued by their authors or printers except insofar as they could be turned to commercial advantage. And more importantly, as we shall shortly see, there is evidence from the correctors themselves that some printers were loathe to hire competent proof-readers and to compensate them commensurate with their talents and efforts. The crux, again, was economic; popular books had to be produced cheaply and quickly if a reasonable profit was to be realized. The empirical data so far reviewed will help to put into perspective the earliest circumstantial account of the proof-reading procedures recommended for use in English printing-houses, Joseph Moxon's Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing (1683-84). 11 Moxon was himself periodically a London printer, though he was never made free of the Stationers' Company and though he occupied himself with other trades as well, spending some of his time on the continent, most frequently in Holland, whence his family had emigrated to England. In recent years there has been some controversy over the validity of Moxon's discussion of proof-reading, particularly over the related questions of whether Moxon accurately represents the practice of the trade in his own time (especially of the London commercial houses in which nearly all plays were printed), and if he does, whether his description holds true for the earlier years of the seventeenth century. In short, we want to know, once more, the extent to which a piece of evidence can safely be generalized. 12 Like the promoters of the University Presses, Moxon demanded that the corrector be a learned philologian. In fact, even by the standards of the Learned Presses, the qualifications required by Moxon seem stringent: "A Correcter should (besides the English Tongue) be well skilled in Languages, especially in those that are used to be Printed with us, viz. Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Syriack, Caldae, French, Spanish, Italian, High Dutch, Saxon, Low Dutch, Welch , &amp;c. neither ought my innumerating only these be a stint to his skill in the number of them." He even suggests that the corrector should know the language of the work in hand more thoroughly than the author himself, who "has perhaps no more skill than the bare knowledge of the Words and their Pronunciation, so that the Orthography (if the Correcter have no knowledge of the Language) may not only be false to its Native Pronunciation, but the Words altered into other Words by a little wrong Spelling," with the resultant distortion or destruction of the sense. He must furthermore "be very knowing in Derivations and Etymologies of Words" (to distinguish spelling variants from substantive errors?) and be as well "skilful in the Compositers whole Task and Obligation." Despite these apparently impossible qualifications, Moxon seems to think that finding a man so blessed ought to be no great matter, for he casually refuses to discuss the matter further: "But I shall say no more of his Qualifications; but suppose him endowed with all necessary accomplishments for that Office" (pp. 246-247). It is a remarkable supposition. One feels that either University Press would have been pleased to have had such a corrector, and indeed Clarke seems to have filled the bill nicely before being reduced to a supernumerary; even he, however, did not come to the job with these kinds of qualifications. For several reasons we cannot suppose each London printing-house to have retained a corrector of this calibre. Just on the face of it, it seems impossible that many men of these achievements would have contented themselves with unsteady, low-paying work in an unpredictable trade. There is good evidence that expense was a major obstacle to printers' maintaining full-time learned correctors. In 1578 Christopher Barker set forth to the Queen the subscription terms for his Bible, and in them he explained the price and his means of arriving at it: Your said suppliant hauing bene at great charge aswell in preparing furniture [i.e., type, &amp;c. ] as in retayning Journeymen and three learned men for a long time for the printing of the said bibles , and correcting such small faults as had escaped in the former prints thereof, so as if it were prised at xxx s . it were scarce sufficient, (his labour and cost being well considered) yet he is content for present money by this meane to take for euery of the same bibles bound xxiiij. s . and for euery of the same vnbound xx. s . 13 It is costly to retain three learned men to correct "small faults," and Barker is making it clear that he is not inflating the price of the books in order to realize an unreasonable profit; no doubt the price is above cost, but the explicit mention of the expense of correction indicates that it was no small consideration in the printing of a book the accuracy of which was so vital. A few years later, when Barker reviewed the status of all current printing patents and grants, he raised the issue of correction again. In December 1582 he complained on behalf of the Stationers that the publishers and booksellers had all the best of the trade since they owned copies and patents but bore no expenses beyond the hiring of a printer. Increasing numbers of patents had worsened conditions so far that "Booksellers being growen the greater and wealthier nomber haue nowe many of the best Copies and keepe no printing howse" and have not, therefore, the expenses attendant upon them. The printers' costs continue to rise, "so that the artificer printer, growing every Daye more and more vnable to provide letter and other furniture, requisite for the execution of any good worke; or to gyve mayntenaunce to any suche learned Correctours as are behouefull, will in tyme be an occasion of great discredit to the proffesours of the arte, and in myne opinion preiudiciall to the comon wealth" (Arber, I, 114-115). And the time when such discredit would raise an outcry was not far in the future; the pleas for Learned Presses were prompted by just such a state of affairs as Barker describes, and among the contributing factors is the expense of maintaining learned correctors. Given the consequences Barker outlines, one must suppose that for many printers the cost was prohibitively high. The situation evidently had not improved by as late as 1634, for at about that time the four correctors of the King's Press petitioned Laud because the salaries of correctors had been reduced, and the four sought to recover the salary level of previous years; they explain that your Peticioners haue bene for some yeares Correctours in the King's Printhouse Conditioned with to haue the pay and priuiledges which formerly the Correctours had; The ffarmers there haue abated almost 80 li per annum of their paie, and abridged the number of Correctours intending a yet further Diminution: The worke notwithstanding is greater than euer and they exact from your peticioners the [expense of] the reprinting of such faults as escape (Arber, IV, 20). One could understand reducing salaries or laying off workers if demand were down, but the petitioners claim that the demand is "greater than euer" for their services. It appears, then, that throughout the period correctors demanded pay commensurate with their abilities but that the profits of printing were not sufficient to meet those demands. The printers therefore hired less qualified men who were content with lower pay or they coped with correction matters as best they could on their own. The best evidence we have on the subject details the problem from the corrector's point of view. The Dutchman Hornschuch, in a handbook specifically addressed in 1608 to correctors of the press, describes the attributes of a good corrector in order to stress the point that poorly printed books are not always due to the failure of the proof-readers themselves but to the failure of printers to hire qualified men for the job. At the time he wrote his handbook Hornschuch was himself an unemployed skilled corrector, and it is quite possible that his bitterness has taken the form of hyperbolical complaint, but the substance of his argument fits squarely with the other evidence concerning lack-lustre performance and the expenses to the printer. The printers' failure to hire competent correctors he attributes to the avarice of those who refuse to pay men adequately, with the result that "when they do the correctors' job themselves, they are unskilled, bungling, and inadequate; men educated in only the language that they were once taught by their nurses." Unskilled men in such a delicate position are worse than useless, "for since they understand nothing, so they care about nothing; rarely if ever do they check their work, or examine the care taken by the workmen, who naturally become more lax when they know their task-masters are even more careless." Ultimately, such a casual attitude toward proof-reading renders a skilled corrector superfluous anyway, since "mistakes are often discovered which the correctors may have made a note of, but the printers in their carelessness have left alone." 14 It would appear from Hornschuch's account that the employment of learned correctors was by no means commonplace and that the men who filled their places performed their duties in-differently. Moreover, we find here further evidence that the profit motive prevented the London printers from achieving the standards of correction sought by the Learned Presses, since the printers themselves were acting as unskilled correctors to save the expense of hiring skilled ones. In assessing, therefore, the likely procedures of proof-reading any given book, we would do well to consider the kinds of books for which correctors answering Laud's or Moxon's qualifications would be either necessary or desirable. Obviously, for the "frivolous trifles written in English" of which the Learned Presses complained, a full knowledge of the tongues, derivations, and etymologies would be superfluous. A printer principally engaged in the production of broadsides, pamphlets, and plays in the vernacular would hardly concern himself with securing a corrector knowledgeable in Hebrew or Syriac. Should a work requiring the services of a philologian come to his hands, the printer was presumably at liberty to hire a scholar temporarily to attend to the specific needs of the book or to insist that the author himself oversee the printing and correction, but for the most part a corrector well versed in his native tongue would suffice, if, indeed, any were especially employed at all for such work. And it does seem, despite Hornschuch's unhappiness over the state of affairs, to have been true that in the nature of the business retaining a full-time scholar-corrector was prohibitively expensive to the average commercial printer. In order to turn a profit, the expenses of printing a ha'penny ballad or a six-penny play must naturally have been held to a minimum, especially since the Stationer's Company restricted the size of an edition that could legally be printed from a single setting of type. Hornschuch's unpleasant remarks about the avarice of printers must be kept in perspective; if a printer hoped to earn a livelihood, he could not retain an expensive, learned Architypographus to correct the proofs of The Blind Beggar of Bednal Green , nor, quite plainly, would he have a need to. As Montagu's and Gentili's experiences testify, Hornschuch's account of the incompetence of untrained correctors probably does not distort the picture at one end any more than Moxon's unrealistic decision to "suppose him endowed with all necessary accomplishments for that Office" distorts it at the other. But sweeping generalizations about proof-reading procedures in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries will all be inaccurate to the degree that they fail to take account of the nature of the book being printed and the character of the printing-house printing it. The abilities of most correctors in the period no doubt lay somewhere between the extremes described by the handbook authors, with the Learned Presses aiming more for Moxon's ideal and the commercial houses tending by necessity toward a less exalted standard. In the absence of external evidence, the internal evidence of each book in question must be the witness to the likely proof-reading procedures accorded it in view of the considerable leeway the printers allowed in tolerable correction standards.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Dryden as a Cambridge Editor by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As early as 1729, at which date Elijah Fenton's edition of The Works of Edmund Waller was published, it was known that Wentworth Dillon, fourth Earl of Roscommon (1633?-1685), "began to form a Society for the refining, and fixing the standard of our language; in which design his great friend Mr. Dryden was a principal assistant" (p. lxxvii). Some two hundred years later, Professor Carl Niemeyer recalled attention to this "academy" by quoting the relevant passage from a copy of a manuscript biography of the Earl, written by Knightly Chetwood, his intimate friend. Chetwood's son John, a Fellow of Trinity Hall, died in 1752 and left all his father's books and manuscript sermons to Wadham Knatchbull, also a Fellow of Trinity Hall; the copy of the manuscript biography of Roscommon in the Baker MSS in the Cambridge University Library bears the information that the original was "in the hands of Mr. Knatchbull Fellow of Trinity Hall." 1 Chetwood wrote that Roscommon "set himselfe, to form a sort of Academy" whose members were "the Marquess of H:, who undertook the Translation of Tacitus, an Author perfectly suited to his tast. He carried it on a good way, &amp; corrected a great many Mistakes in the Version of M r Ablancourt. The Lord Maitland was another, who then began his excellent translation of Virgil." Others were the "Earle of D. . .t, one of the most accomplish'd persons of the Age, [who] came sometimes among them, as did the Lord Candish, the Ingenious coll: Finch, S r Charles Sc. . .gh, M r Dryden, whom Lord Ros: look'd upon, as a naturall rather than a correct Poet, &amp; therefore calls him somewhere, The luxurious Father of the fold . There were some few others of less note &amp; Abilities." As there is a reference to Roscommon's writing "his Essay on translated verse [1684], in emulation of that finish'd Poem, An Essay upon Poetry" by the Earl of Mulgrave, published in 1682, Niemeyer puts the date of formation of the academy in the early eighties. He identifies the members as the Marquess of Halifax; Richard Lauderdale, fourth Earl of Maitland; the Earl of Dorset; Lord Cavendish (later the Duke of Devonshire); Colonel Heneage Finch (husband of the famous poetess); and Sir Charles Scarborough. Neither he nor anybody else has sought to trace the later history of this group or to conjecture, for one can only conjecture, upon the identities of the "others of less note &amp; Abilities." The existence of a group of poets and scholars which included Dryden in the role of "principal assistant" to the founder, the Earl of Roscommon, suggests the possibility that this association may be in the background of some of Dryden's editorial ventures. Professor Katherine Lynch states that Dryden introduced various "eminent hands" to the publisher Jacob Tonson, and the 1680 translation of Ovid's Epistles by Dryden and seventeen other writers was the result. 2 The editors of the California Dryden (Vol. I, Poems, 1649-1680 ) do not know "precisely what part Dryden played in arranging for the collection known as Ovid's Epistles . . . . He has sometimes been described as the editor of the volume, but there is no evidence that he acted in that capacity. It seems more likely that Tonson collected the pieces, and engaged Dryden, because of his great prestige, to write the preface. . . . Dryden . . . may well have suggested the project to Tonson" (p. 324). None of Dryden's seventeen collaborators is known to have been a member of Roscommon's academy, but a number of them also contributed to Miscellany Poems (1684). The editors of the California Dryden (Vol. II, Poems , 1681-1684 ) state that "Dryden's role in putting together this first one in a series of Tonson-Dryden miscellanies cannot be determined" (p. 374) and cite Hugh Macdonald's Dryden bibliography, p. 67 in their footnote. Macdonald wrote, however, that "although Tonson and Dryden were in close collaboration at any rate over Sylvae , Dryden probably acted rather as an occasional adviser in the compilation of the four parts published during his lifetime than as the actual selector of his fellow poets." 3 The California editors continue, after naming the Earl of Roscommon as a contributor to Miscellany Poems (1684): "Among other contributors connected with Dryden, or to be connected with him later, were Thomas Creech, Richard Duke, the Earl of Mulgrave, Thomas Otway, the Earl of Rochester, Thomas Rymer, Sir Charles Sedley, Sir Carr Scrope, George Stepney, and Nahum Tate. In short, Miscellany Poems seems to have been something of a coterie production with Dryden as the major figure." 4 Contributors to both Ovid's Epistles (1680) and Miscellany Poems (1684) were Sir Carr Scrope, Nahum Tate, Richard Duke, the Earl of Mulgrave, Thomas Rymer, Thomas Otway, six of the seventeen in the earlier volume and of the same number in the later. Two names among the contributors to Miscellany Poems bring one back to the academy, for the Earl of Roscommon translated two odes by Horace, while Knightly Chetwood translated part of the second Georgic as well as one of Virgil's Eclogues . It will be recalled that Chetwood, as the Earl of Roscommon's biographer, wrote that "others of less note &amp; Abilities" were members of the Earl's academy, and I am fairly confident that he modestly remained an anonymous member of this group. He was the intimate friend of Roscommon and Dryden. Both he and Dryden wrote commendatory verses to the Earl's Essay on Translated Verse (1684) and he edited the Traitté touchant l'Obeissance Passive (1685), translated by the Earl from the English of Dr. Sherlock. Besides his contribution to the 1684 Miscellany Poems , he was associated with Dryden in an edition of Saint Evremond's Miscellaneous Essays (1692), and wrote the Life of Virgil and the Preface to the Pastorals for Dryden's Virgil (1697). He also translated the life of Lycurgus for the English edition of Plutarch's Lives , another work edited by Dryden. All this, in my opinion, makes him a charter member of the Earl of Roscommon's abortive "academy," the Earl dying in 1685 and the original design of refining and fixing the English language giving way to a number of projects under the general leadership of Dryden. Professor Niemeyer, in his identification of "coll: Finch" as Heneage Finch, notes that he is probably the "F . . . ch" described in two lines of Thomas Otway's epistle to Richard Duke, published in the 1684 Miscellany Poems . He might have noted that in the list of the second subscribers to Dryden's Virgil there appeared the names of "The Hon. Col. Finch," of "The Hon. Doctour Finch," of "Tho. Finch, Esq.," and of "George Finch." If the identification is accepted, there is good reason conjecturally to number Otway and Duke among the "few others of less note &amp; Abilities," for they both contributed to Ovid's Epistles and Miscellany Poems , Duke to the extent of six pieces. What is more, Duke translated the fourth satire of Juvenal for Dryden (1693) and contributed to Dryden's edition of Plutarch's Lives in English translation. And for whatever, if any, value as evidence of such an association, it should be pointed out that Duke's poetry was posthumously published in 1717 with that of the Earl of Roscommon and of the Duke of Buckingham. Duke also contributed two anonymous amatory songs to Dryden's third miscellany, Examen Poeticum (1693). He had written commendatory verses for Absalom and Achitophel (1681), along with Nathaniel Lee and, for the third edition, Nahum Tate. Even earlier, in 1679, he wrote verses on Dryden's play Troilus and Cressida . He, with Dryden and Sir Carr Scrope (or Scroop), contributed to Mrs. Barker's Poetical Recreations in 1688. 5 Scrope, it is well to repeat, was another of the group of six writers who contributed to Ovid's Epistles and to Miscellany Poems . As part of the recurrence of certain names of writers known to Dryden or connected in some way with his efforts it is also necessary to note that Duke joined with Tate and Otway in contributing commendatory verses to the second edition of Thomas Creech's translation of Lucretius (1683). Creech, who contributed five pieces to Miscellany Poems , was also one of the translators of Dryden's English edition of Plutarch's Lives (1683-86), as were also Duke, Chetwood, John Caryl (translator of one of Ovid's epistles in the 1680 volume), Thomas Rymer (another contributor to the 1680 Ovid's Epistles ), and John Evelyn. It may be well to dispatch John Evelyn's part in these editorial ventures, for he was not exactly one of Dryden's friends. He did, however, join Otway, Tate, Duke, and Mrs. Aphra Behn (another contributor to Ovid's Epistles ) in writing commendatory verses on Creech's Lucretius and he contributed two poems for the second of Dryden's miscellanies, Sylvae (1685). Macdonald notes that in 1694 Dryden and Evelyn were among those who dined at Edward Sheldon's home (p. 134, n. 3). Thus far, then, aside from any pre-1680 associations of various writers with Dryden, there are a number of contributors to Ovid's Epistles (1680), Plutarch's Lives (1683-86), and Miscellany Poems (1685). Some of these same writers were to be associated with Dryden in collections either edited by him or in which he had a part. Perhaps a list of names will make for the simplest exposition of these associations, despite some repetition of what has already been said. The collections are Ovid's Epistles , 1680 ( OE ); Miscellany Poems , 1684 ( MP ); Plutarch's Lives , 1683-86 ( Lives ); Sylvae , 1685 ( Sylvae ); Juvenal , 1693 ( J ); Examen Poeticum , 1693 ( EP ); Annual Miscellany , 1694 ( AM ); Lucian's Works , 1711 ( Lucian ). Sir Car Scrope OE , MP He was of Westminster School, Dryden's old school. Scrope contributed the prologue to Nathaniel Lee's Rival Queens , 1676/7, which was dedicated to the Earl of Mulgrave and which had commendatory verses by Dryden. And he was associated with Dryden in contributing to Lee's Mithradates , 1677/8. 6 He died in 1680. Earl of Mulgrave OE , MP , EP Mulgrave collaborated with Dryden in translating one of Ovid's Epistles; Dryden had dedicated Aureng-Zebe to him in 1676 and was to dedicate his translation of the Aeneid to him in 1697. Nahum Tate OE , MP , J , Lucian Macdonald, p. 67, n. 4 suggests that "it is possible that Tate collaborated with Dryden in assisting Tonson in some of his undertakings." Tate was the author of the second part of Absalom and Architophel , being asked to write it by Dryden. Dryden wrote a prologue for Tate's The Loyal General in 1680. And there is a connection with the Earl of Roscommon's academy in that the Earl of Dorset, one of the members, was Tate's patron. Richard Duke OE , MP , Lives , EP He followed Dryden at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. Thomas Otway OE , MP He and Dryden were not on good terms in 1676 (Macdonald, p. 212); he died in 1685. His presence in these collections may stem from his friendship for Duke and Colonel Finch. Thomas Rymer OE. MP Rymer's attack on Dryden's plays came in 1692 in his Short View of Tragedy . John Caryll OE , MP , Lives He was the uncle of Pope's friend. Caryll was a prominent Catholic and author of Naboth's Vineyard , 1679, a poem which "probably gave more than a hint to Dryden" for his Absalom and Achitophel (Macdonald, p. 214). Dryden's conversion to Catholicism occurred about 1685. John Somers OE , Lives He was later Lord Somers. Attribution to him of a coarse satire against Dryden in 1683 is probably incorrect (Macdonald, p. 234). In a letter dated 26 November 1699 Dryden wrote that Somers, then Lord Chancellor, was his "Enemy." 7 None of the remaining contributors to OE reappears in the later collections. Of these, Mrs. Behn was at one time a great admirer of Dryden (Macdonald, p. 161, n. 2), while Elkanah Settle had no reason to love him. Samuel Butler, who died in 1680, lived close to Dryden but nothing is known of their relationship. Thomas Flatman contributed verses to Remains of John Oldham in 1684, as did Dryden and Tate (Macdonald, p. 38, n. 2), and he and Dryden also contributed verses to another work in 1685. He, like Dryden, was a fellow of the Royal Society. [John] Pulteney was at Westminster School under the famous Dr. Busby, also Dryden's schoolmaster. If the Mr. Wright who contributed to the volume was James Wright, tentatively so identified by Macdonald (p. 17), author of Historia Histrionica , 1699, he later contributed prefatory verses to Dryden's Virgil . Both an Edward Wright and a John Wright contributed verses to Luctus Britannici , or The Tears of the British Muses for the Death of John Dryden (1700). Neither Floyd nor Pooley, the other two contributors to OE, has been further identified. Dryden, it can be seen, knew most of the contributors to the 1680 collection. New names appeared in MP . There is no reason to elaborate Dryden's connection with the Earl of Roscommon or with Knightly Chetwood, or with Thomas Creech. Prominent among the new contributors were William Bowles MP , Sylvae , J He was a Fellow of King's College from 1680-88. I can find no connection with Dryden other than his contributing to these three collections. He may very well have been known to Charles Dryden who was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1683. George Stepney MP , J Stepney was of Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was a friend of Charles Montague, Earl of Halifax; both of them, with Prior, Duke, and Charles Dryden (the poet's son) contributed to a Cambridge University volume of verses on the death of Charles II and the accession of James II (Macdonald, p. 253, n. 1). Charles Dryden also contributed to his father's Plutarch . The Hon. John Stafford MP , Sylvae He wrote the epilogue for Thomas Southerne's The Disappointment , 1684; Dryden wrote the prologue for the play. Giles Jacob, in his Historical Account of the Lives and Writings of our Most Considerable English Poets , 1724, describes "Mr. Stafford" as "A great friend of Mr. Dryden's and Colonel Sackvil , of the Family of the Lord Dorset ." This last relationship establishes another link with Roscommon's academy, as the Earl of Dorset was a member. What is more, it has been recently suggested that John Stafford was the brother of Mrs. Anastasia Stafford, whose marriage Dryden celebrated in a poem of about 1686 to 1688, and that "Dryden was one of a group of people drawn together by their common Catholicism. As the editor of the Miscellany volumes, however, Dryden was acquainted with one of the Staffords before his conversion, and it may be that his association with the Staffords began as a literary relationship." 8 In 1697 in a note on his translation of Virgil's eighth Pastoral Dryden wrote, "The Eighth and Tenth Pastorals are already translated to all manner of advantage by my excellent friend Mr. Stafford. So is the episode of Camilla, in the Eleventh AEneid ." Sir Charles Sedley MP Dryden had dedicated The Assignation , 1673, to him. He is Lisideius of the Essay of Dramatic Poesy , 1668. Macdonald notes that Sedley, Dryden, Mrs. Behn, and Granville all contributed poems to a collection of 1691 (p. 82), and that Dryden and Shadwell had a common friend in Sedley (p. 190), a fact which may explain Shadwell's presence in MP . John Cooper OE , MP , Lives Cooper's contribution to OE was to the second edition, 1681, translating the epistle which had been paraphrased by Mrs. Behn for the first edition. He was of Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. Thomas Adams MP He, with Nahum Tate, wrote preliminary verses to Dryden's The Medal , 1682. He was admitted a pensioner to Trinity College, Cambridge, from Westminster School on 13 May, 1651, one year after Dryden was admitted to Trinity. There seems little doubt that his presence in MP must be put down to Dryden's influence. The only other name is that of the Earl of Rochester, dead four years, whose poetry was drawn on for this collection as well as for EP and AM . It is only because Professor Ward had not traced the identity of the other contributors to MP and their connections with Dryden that he could write, of that collection, that "no doubt Tonson again made himself responsible for soliciting contributions from a number of persons, including Sedley, Mulgrave, Roscommon, Otway, Creech, Shadwell, and others." By "again" Professor Ward means that Tonson was responsible for getting contributors to Plutarch's Lives 1683-86. 9 Professor Ward, to go on to Dryden's translation of Juvenal and Persius, believes "it is not possible to determine upon what basis the 'several hands' were chosen or upon what principle the assignments were made" (p. 255). The basis, almost surely, again was Dryden's acquaintance with the contributors. The contributors to Dryden's translation of Plutarch's Lives have been treated separately elsewhere 10 and it remains only to say that John Evelyn, who contributed to the Lives , is also represented in Sylvae , 1685. Dryden wrote in his Preface to Sylvae : "I hope it will not be expected from me, that I shou'd say any thing of my fellow undertakers in this Miscellany. Some of them are too nearly related to me, to be commended without suspicion of partiality: Others I am sure need it not; and the rest I have not perus'd." Only Charles Dryden was "nearly related." There are, moreover, more anonymous pieces in this collection than in any of the other three miscellanies, and it is likely, although only conjectural, that Dryden had less to do with their inclusion than did Tonson. Again conjecturally, Dryden may be referring to these anonymous pieces when he says that he had not "perus'd" the rest. He knew Charles Stafford; he may have known Bowles; and it was either Creech or the Earl of Lauderdale, both very well known to him, who translated part of Virgil's fourth Georgic for the collection. The only new names in Sylvae are those of Dryden's son, Charles, and "H. D. Esq." He is Henry Dickinson, the translator of Father Simon's Critical History of the Old Testament , whom Dryden in 1682 termed "an ingenious young gentleman my Friend" (Macdonald, p. 33). His poem is immodestly titled "Upon the late Ingenious Translation of Pere Simon's Critical History." Charles Dryden also contributed to his father's translation of Juvenal and to AM . The new names in the Juvenal are Stephen Harvey J , AM He, too, was of Trinity College, Cambridge, having been admitted a pensioner on 17 May 1641. William Congreve J. EP , AM Congreve's appearance in this collection marked the beginning of a friendship that ended with Dryden's death. Thomas Power J Power was also of Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He became a Fellow of Trinity College in 1684, one year after Charles Dryden, another of the translators of Juvenal, was admitted to that college. Dryden's next collection was Examen Poeticum , 1693, the third of his Miscellanies . With the exception of the Earl of Mulgrave and Congreve, the other contributors had had no part in any of Dryden's earlier collections. Joseph Addison EP , AM For the last ten years of his life [1690-1700] Dryden "drank with him [Addison] more than he was used to" (Macdonald, p. 74, n. 1, quoting Spence's Anecdotes .). Addison wrote the preface to the Georgics for Dryden's Virgil , 1697. Thomas Yalden EP , AM Samuel Johnson, in his life of Yalden, wrote that "among his contemporaries in the college were Addison and Sacheverell, men who were in those times friends, and who both adopted Yalden to their intimacy." 11 Henry Sacheverell EP Friend of Addison and Yalden. Henry Cromwell EP He contributed six pieces to the collection, but I find no link with Dryden, although one of his pieces, a translation of the fifteenth Elegy in the first Book of Ovid's "Love-Elegies" is "Inscrib'd to Mr. Dryden." Nathaniel Lee EP He and Dryden were friends from at least 1677 to the time he was confined in Bethlehem Hospital. They collaborated in the play Oedipus , 1679. Lee died in 1692. George Granville, later Lord Lansdowne EP , AM Granville was also of Trinity College, Cambridge. He was "evidently intimate with Dryden" (Macdonald, p. 61, n. 1). He contributed eleven pieces to a collection of 1691, in which Dryden's "Verses to Etherege" first appeared, and wrote some preliminary verses to Dryden's Virgil , 1697. Bevil Higgons EP Cousin to George Granville. Higgons contributed verses to Luctus Britannici (1700), the collection published on Dryden's death. Matthew Prior EP He was of Westminster School. His most immediate connection with Dryden was his and Montague's parody of Dryden's The Hind and the Panther , 1687. Dr. Walter Pope EP He was Dryden's contemporary at Westminster School and a Fellow of the Royal Society. [James] Talbot EP He was of Westminster School and was Charles Dryden's exact contemporary, both being admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as pensioners on 26 June 1683. He was a Fellow of Trinity from 1689 on and Regius Professor of Hebrew from 1680-1704. Jacob Allestry EP He died in 1686; he was of Westminster School. J.[ohn] H.[ow] EP This is probably the John How who contributed verses to The History of Adolphus , 1691 (see Macdonald, p. 82). Robert Wolseley EP He was the "Friend of the Author" who wrote the Epilogue to Dryden's Spanish Friar (Macdonald, p. 123). In the critical Preface he wrote for the Earl of Rochester's Valentinian (1685) Wolseley cited or quoted Dryden's work three times, always in laudatory contexts. Sir John Eaton EP Edmond Malone identified him as a writer of songs. ( Letters , pp. 10 and 146). The remaining contributors were the late Duke of Buckingham, "Mat." [Martin] Clifford (also deceased), and the unidentified writers whose signatures were J.R., Dr. S[hort?[, Ld. V., Mr. S., and Ld. S. and Mr. C., the last two of whom combined forces in a poem. The fourth part of Dryden's miscellanies, the Annual Miscellany for the year 1694, included poems by Charles Dryden, Addison, Congreve, Stephen Harvey, Yalden, George Granville, the Earl of Lauderdale (one of the members of Roscommon's academy), all of whom, with the possible exception of Lauderdale, had already contributed to one or more of Dryden's earlier collections. The new names are those of John Dennis He and Dryden evidently became acquainted about this time ( Letters , pp. 65-74). Francis Knapp He was a demy (foundation scholar) at Magdalen College, Oxford from 1689-96; fellow-demys were Joseph Addison, from 1689-97, and Henry Sacheverell, from 1689-1701. I have no doubt that one of these two friends, both contributors to EP , brought Knapp to Dryden's attention. Charles Hopkins Hopkins wrote Epistolary Poems , published by Tonson in 1694; he was "very much esteemed by Mr. Dryden ," according to Giles Jacob. One of the poems in his collection is to Walter Moyle, a good friend of Dryden's (Macdonald, pp. 277-8). He evidently also knew Yalden, for one of his poems reprinted in The First Part of Miscellany Poems , 1716, V. 51, is addressed to him. In a letter of 1699 Dryden wrote of Hopkins that he was "a poet who writes good verses without knowing how, or why; I mean he writes naturally well, without art or learning, or good sence" ( Letters , p. 124). Henry Savile He died in 1687; the inclusion of one of the two poems for which he is remembered may be owing to his friendship with the Earl of Dorset. The Mr. Glanvill who contributed translations of a chorus of Seneca's Troas and of three odes of Horace is almost without doubt John Glanvill (1664?-1735), characterized in the DNB as "poet and translator," whose first published work was Some Odes of Horace Imitated , 1690. I can trace no link to Dryden. In 1693 Sir Henry Sheeres translated The History of Polybius the Megalopolitan ; the publisher was Samuel Briscoe, and Dryden contributed a character of Polybius and his writings. Dryden knew Sir Henry at least as early as 1686 ( Letters , p. 30), and there may, therefore, have been some connection between Dryden's contribution to the Polybius and Sir Henry's part in the translation of The Works of Lucian , published by Briscoe in four volumes in 1711, for which Dryden wrote a character of Lucian and his writings. The project had got under way before 1696, Briscoe stating in the dedication to the first volume that "The Life by Mr. Dryden, and some of the Dialogues, were done before and in the year 1696, and the rest in subsequent years." Dryden, in 1697, in a note on a line in his translation of Virgil's fourth Georgic , wrote of his "most ingenious friend, Sir Henry Shere." Nahum Tate had a part in the Lucian , but none of the other contributors had appeared in Dryden's collections. There were twenty-two contributors besides Dryden and Sheeres and Tate; of these twenty-two, ten had or may have had earlier connections with Dryden. They were Walter Moyle He is mentioned in Dryden's dedication of the Aeneid and was highly regarded by him (Macdonald, p. 278, n. 1). He was an acquaintance of Sheeres. 12 Tom Brown Brown had written a prefatory poem to Creech's Lucretius , 1682, and was a favorite of the Earl of Dorset at whose table he coincided at least once with Dryden (Macdonald, p. 258, n. 4). He, with James Drake, John Savage, and Francis Manning were the translators of Miscellaneous Essays by Monsieur de St. Evremond , 1692, for which Dryden wrote a character of St. Evremond. Note that both Drake and Savage also contributed to the Lucian . James Drake He wrote a character of Tom Brown for the collected edition of Brown's works, published, incidentally, by Samuel Briscoe. Drake was a contemporary of Charles Dryden's at Cambridge. John Savage He is described in the Lucian as "of the Middle Temple," to which he was admitted on 17 May, 1686 ( Register of Admissions to the Middle Temple ). Charles Blount, ESQ. Macdonald notes that Blount "seems to have been on good terms with Dryden from 1672 [he wrote a vindication of Dryden published in 1673] till his death" (p. 245, n. 2 and p. 204). Blount's elder brother, Sir Thomas Pope Blount, subscribed to Dryden's Virgil . Samuel Cobb Part of his education was at Trinity College, Cambridge. He complimented Dryden in his Poetae Britannici, A Poem , 1700, as well as in Poems on Several Occasions , 1707. (See the Term Catalogue, III. 439, 535.) Laurence Eachard (or Echard) Echard had praised Dryden's Amphitryon as an improvement on Plautus whose plays he, Echard, translated in 1694 (Macdonald, p. 130, n. 7), and Dryden had corrected the first volume of Echard's History of England (Macdonald, p. 167 and nn. 6, 7). Charles Gildon Friend of Dryden and of Charles Blount, whose works he edited in 1695. The fact that Blount was dead in 1695 lends further credence to Briscoe's statement about the early date upon which the collection began. Edmond Malone states that the project was "announced by Motteux in his Gent. Journ. in June, 1693; and in March, 1694, said to be extremely forward." 13 Hugh Hare He was admitted as a nobleman to Trinity College, Cambridge in May 1684, one year after Charles Dryden was admitted to Trinity. John Philips He was of Westminster School and admitted as pensioner to Trinity College, Cambridge in June 1682; hence he would surely have been known to Charles Dryden. "Joannes Phillips Interioris Templi Alumni" wrote verses on Dryden's death for Luctus Britannici (1700). I believe Charles Dryden may have recommended Hare and Philips to his father, who in turn brought them to Briscoe's attention. The Mr. Vernon, not otherwise identified, who translated one of the Lives might conceivably be "Henricus Vernon" of London who mourned Dryden's death in the collection Luctus Britannici (1700) and subscribed to the Virgil in 1697 along with a James Vernon. But there is also Thomas Vernon, ESQ. who was a five-guinea subscriber to the edition with the plates. One has too many Vernons from whom to choose. James Tyrrel, another of the contributors, is almost surely the author of a history of England; he was connected to the Blounts through the marriage of his sister to Sir Thomas Pope Blount, elder brother to Charles Blount, Dryden's friend and himself a contributor to the Lucian . The connection with Dryden is slight, but it is there. Eleven, then, of the twenty-four contributors to the Lucian , may have had no prior connection with Dryden. One fact which should be added is that Dryden and four others (Cavendish, Scarborough, Dorset, Halifax) of the original "academy" were Fellows of the Royal Society, Dryden, Cavendish, and Scarborough being charter members. Seven others of those who contributed to the seven works discussed were also Fellows of the Royal Society, and of these, two (Evelyn, Pope) were also charter members. 14 More importantly, however, it has been seen that all but two of the seventeen who contributed to Ovid's Epistles were, or were to be, somehow connected with Dryden. So, too, were all the known contributors to Miscellany Poems, Sylvae , and the translation of Juvenal; fifteen of twenty-three in Examen Poeticum , ten of sixteen in Annal Miscellany ; and thirteen of twenty-four in The Works of Lucian . Twenty-eight of the total number of all the identifiable contributors to these seven collaborative editions were Cambridge men, and of these twelve were Trinity College men. 15 Fourteen had attended Westminster School, as had Dryden. 16 Further, when it is realised that six of the noblemen had been privately educated, that at least two contributors (Tate and Congreve) had attended Trinity College, Dublin, and that two others (Caryll and Stafford) were Catholics and hence prohibited from attendance at university, the predominance of Cambridge men emerges the more strongly. Both in the above editions and in the collaborative translation of Plutarch, Dryden proved loyal to his university and to his college. 17</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Dryden's Translation of Virgil's Eclogues and the Tradition by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While there have been studies of Dryden's indebtedness to his predecessors in his translation of Virgil's Georgics and Aeneid , 1 no one has undertaken to analyze the extent and kind of his borrowings in his other translations. Mrs. Hooker concludes that "out of the 3,149 lines in Dryden's Georgics , the poet took over 20 per cent of the rhyme words directly from his predecessors [and thus does not count those instances in which Dryden employed a rhyme word obviously suggested by a borrowed rhyme]. It appears that his imagination was stimulated by rhyme. Having fixed upon the end word he built easily and gracefully upon it, rendering the sense in the eloquent harmony that is characteristic of his own genius" (pp. 309-310). Leslie Proudfoot concludes from his study of the translations of the fourth Aeneid that Dryden borrowed between 275 and 300 rhyme-words and a total of forty lines verbatim or nearly so from eight English predecessors (pp. 265, 266). He, unlike Mrs. Hooker, is more sparing of his praises of Dryden as translator of Virgil, finding faults in a number of aspects of his version of the Aeneid . But he, like Mrs. Hooker, neglects the matter of Dryden's debts to various predecessors for a telling word or phrase that will often give the line or passage in which it appears its distinctive tone. Neither, I believe, has correctly analyzed the extent to which Dryden is indebted to his predecessors in the matter of rhyme-words. 2 I am confident that my conclusions will be at variance with those of the editors of the California Dryden when they publish the Virgil , since I have studied the notes to Dryden's translations of Ovid, Theocritus, and Lucretius in vols. I-III of that edition. Dryden's predecessors in the translation of Virgil's Eclogues were W. L. [William Lisle], Virgil's Eclogues Translated into English , 1628; John Biddle, Virgil's Bucolicks Englished , 1632; Sir John Beaumont, a version of the fourth Eclogue in his Bosworth Field , 1629; John Ogilby, the works of Virgil , 1649 (I use the 1654 edition); various of his friends and acquaintances who joined with him in a translation of the Eclogues in the Miscellany Poems of 1684, edited by him; and the manuscript version of Richard Maitland, fourth Earl of Lauderdale, published after Dryden's and the Earl's deaths. 3 Dryden translated the fourth and ninth Eclogues for the 1684 Miscellany Poems . John Caryll translated the first; Nahum Tate and Thomas Creech contributed versions of the second, while the latter also translated the third. The fifth, sixth, and seventh were, respectively, by Richard Duke, the Earl of Roscommon, and Thomas Adams. John Stafford was responsible for the eight and tenth, while Knightly Chetwood also translated the eighth. Sir William Temple's imitation of the tenth was reprinted in the collection. Just as it has been demonstrated that Dryden availed himself of the translations of the Georgics and the Aeneid of virtually every one of his English predecessors, so too can it be shown that he impressed all of the above versions of the Eclogues into service. Initially, it must be understood that I consider half-rhymes, that is, one identical or nearly identical rhyme word in a couplet or triplet, evidence of influence, although there must be supporting evidence before any influence or borrowing can be claimed. Thus, if Dryden, or anybody else for that matter, can be shown to have borrowed rhyme words, as well as individual words and phrases, from one of his predecessors, and they coincide, in the space of a short poem, in half-rhymes or identically sounding rhymes, the presumption is that influence is present. If one poet depends on a second poet for a number of his rhyme words in a context in which there are a number of identical half-rhymes or individual words, the fact of the original dependence makes it almost mandatory to suspect further dependence. Subsequent illustration will put this bare statement in better perspective. Perhaps it will be best to start, not with the earliest translations of the Eclogues but with Sir John Beaumont's version of the famous fourth, the so-called Pollio, which appeared in his Bosworth Field (1629). Dryden's lines, "A golden Progeny from Heav'n descends;/O chast Lucina speed the Mothers pains" (10-11) derive from Beaumont's "Now progenies from lofty Heav'n descend,/Thou chast Lucina, be this Infants friend" (p. 32). Beaumont's rhyme-words, deface/place, adorne/corne, remaine/constraine, and fed/bed are paralleled, in the same passages, by Dryden's Face/grace/Race (13-15), adorn/Thorn (33-4), remain/gain (37-8, and read/Bed (76-7). Now John Biddle, in Virgil's Bucolicks English'd (1634) has the corn/Thorn and drain/remain rhyme-words (B2 r ) and the first line of his version reads "Sicilian Muses Now some Loftier strain." Dryden's version begins, "Sicilian Muse begin a loftier strain," and the two versions, in addition to the rhyme-words for three couplets, also coincide in Biddle's Raigne/strain, where/appear, beare/teare and Dryden's pains/reigns (11-12), bear/wear (29-30), and Ware/bear (47-8). But W.L.'s version of the fourth Eclogue has the remaine//plaine and ware//are rhymes also, as well as providing Dryden with time//prime and begun//run for his Rhymes/times/begun/run (5-8). 4 John Ogilby first translated the Eclogues for his version of Virgil's works in 1649 and revised his translation for the 1654 edition. Dryden used both editions, but took nothing from the 1649 translation for his version of the fourth Eclogue , although, it may be said in anticipation of later analysis, he took the rhyme-words for some twenty couplets from Ogilby's translation of the other nine Eclogues . Ogilby, in the 1654 edition, also has the Corn/thorn and ware/every where rhymes of his predecessors as well as giving Dryden are/declare, free/see, found/surround, Jove/improve, and raise/Baies for his prepare/care (3-4), be/see (18-19), round/ground (39-40), move/Jove (58-9), and Layes/Bayes (66-7). All of the above results in the conclusion that Dryden had precedents for thirty-nine of his rhyme-words and that he derived two lines from his predecessors. While this may seem fairly inconsequential, analysis of similar indebtedness in the other nine Eclogues will serve to give a much completer picture of how much Dryden owed to his English predecessors. An important by-product will be corroboratory evidence of a tradition in the translation of certain parts of Virgil's poetry, translator after translator availing himself of a number of inherited words and phrases to use at certain junctures, thus allowing him to concentrate on those words, passages, and rhyme-words unsupported by the tradition.

His greatest debt, it is obvious, is to the translation by John Caryll, that which appeared in Miscellany Poems , 1684, a collection edited by Dryden. In the second Eclogue Dryden owes something to his predecessors in 53 of his 108 lines. Again the greatest debt is to the 1684 translators, mostly to Creech and only occasionally to Tate. As will be seen in what follows, Dryden availed himself of the 1684 translations of the Eclogues to an extent that would be unthinkable today. Since it would be wearisome to tabulate Dryden's borrowings for the remaining eight Eclogues in the same fashion used above for the first two, I shall break down the borrowings from each of the predecessors numerically, including, for the sake of completeness, the borrowings for the first two Eclogues . It should be borne in mind, in the following table, that "Lines" means the number of lines which Dryden took verbatim or with very little changes (see Dryden's first Eclogue , 36-37, quoted above, and the 1684 version, for an example) and that "Words" means the same word, although not necessarily the same part of speech or tense of a verb, i.e., "yeaning" in Dryden's first Eclogue 20 and O1's "yean'd." "Triplets" includes two rhyme-words in a predecessor which Dryden expands into a triplet, i.e. W. L.'s Rome//home is expanded to Rome/come/home in Dryden's first Eclogue , 29-31. There is no duplication in what follows, that is, of the rhyme-words found in W. L. which appear in 38 of Dryden's couplets, none is duplicated in the 42 in Biddle used by Dryden. Nor is there duplication in the two Ogilby versions, or those of 1684. Since Dryden translated the fourth and ninth Eclogues for the 1684 Miscellany Poems , there are naturally no entries for 1684 listed under those two Eclogues . Analysis of the debt to each of Dryden's predecessors, grouping the various translators of the 1684 volume under one heading, results in the following: Rhyme-words for couplets Rhyme-words for triplets Lines Phrases Words W.L. 78 15 0 2 11 B 84 12 3 3 13 01 28 0 0 2 1 02 86 3 5 3 2 1684 142 27 69 17 9 One must also add seven rhyme-words from Sir John Beaumont's version of the fourth Eclogue and four from Knightly Chetwood's translation of the eighth. Dryden almost surely derived virtually forty percent of his rhyme-words from his predecessors, 486 out of a total of 1212 lines for the ten Eclogues . Put baldly thus, one's reaction might be to shrug one's shoulders and say that something like this could have been predicted from Mrs. Hooker's study of the English translators of the Georgics and Mr. Proudfoot's of the fourth Book of the Aeneid . However, to begin with matters of lesser import, Mrs. Hooker sees Dryden deriving about twenty precent of his rhyme-words, and Proudfoot's 275 to 300 rhyme-words in a total of just a little over a thousand lines results in a thirty percent, while Dryden's borrowings in the Eclogues amount to forty percent. Admittedly, I am including, as I was careful to state at the outset, half-rhymes and rhymes that are the same in sound alone, i.e. where Dryden has round/ground and one of his predecessors has found/surround at the same juncture I count this as two derivative rhyme-words. Actually, Dryden almost invariably borrows at least one identical rhyme-word from the couplet or, rarely, triplet of one of his predecessors. Probably of somewhat more interest is the frequency with which Dryden depends upon his predecessors' versions to get him started, for he borrows his rhyme-words (and more, as will be seen) for the first couplet in four of the Eclogues (I, II, III, VI), for the second couplet in four (IV, V, VIII, X—a triplet in this last) and for lines 4-5 in Eclogue IX. Only in the seventh does he wait until he is well into the translation (ll. 15-16) before he becomes derivative. Somewhat similar, but not so pronounced, is Dryden's reliance on his predecessors to help him finish his translations, for he is derivative in his rhyme-words (and more) for the closing couplets for I, II, IV, and VII and for the penultimate couplets for III, V, VIII, and X (this last actually ends with a triplet). While it is overwhelmingly clear that Dryden seemed to have looked upon the translations of the Eclogues in the 1684 Miscellany Poems , edited by him, as a kind of private preserve—something which will soon become even more apparent—it is of additional interest to note that at a few places he will have another version also in view. This would seem to be true of the 1654 Ogilby translation, especially in VI. His total reliance on O2 is corroborated by the statistics given immediately above. What no number of tables or statistics can show is to what extent the kind of tone that Dryden is often praised for in the Virgil , and I include the Georgics and the Aeneid , is also derivative. Take, as one example, certain words in Dryden's third Eclogue , the "Mungril" of l. 25, the "sculk'd" of l. 28, particularly the "cursed" "Stepdame" of l. 48, and the "Wildings" of l. 107—all come from W. L.'s version (he has "curst Stepmother"). The Loeb translation, incidentally, demonstrates something of the longevity of the tradition and the influence of Dryden's version in its repetition of "mongrel" and "skulking," but it then descends to the colorless "harsh stepmother" and "apples." Biddle inherited "mongrel" and "skulking" and a "Step-dame curst" (note that Dryden is even closer to Biddle here) and he was followed in the second by Ogilby and Creech, the latter of whom also has "my Stepdam curst." Here, then, is a bit of traditional language for which Dryden is to be given no other credit than his ability to spot a good thing and use it. Since Dryden's total debt to Creech's version of the third Eclogue is, or may be, so great—a possible 42 rhyme-words and 12 lines, if one disregards coincidences between Creech and the versions earlier than his—it is quite probable that he took most of his diction, including "skulk" and "Stepdam curst" from him. But there still remains the "mongrel" and the "wilding" from W. L. It is difficult, if not impossible, from our position in time to judge the literary morality or immorality of Dryden's wholesale borrowings from his predecessors, especially from those friends and acquaintances who joined him in translating the Eclogues for the 1684 Miscellany Poems . His complete translation of Virgil appeared in 1697, only thirteen years after Miscellany Poems , and most of those associated with him in the early translation of the Eclogues were still alive. No one seems to have remarked upon or objected to Dryden's version of the Eclogues on the grounds of plagiarism. Nor does Dryden himself make reference anywhere in the Virgil , either in the preliminary matter or in the notes, to any help he got from the 1684 volume. He does, however, praise the Earl of Roscommon's version of the sixth Eclogue and John Stafford's versions of the eighth and tenth. Perhaps it would be well to cite the example of William Benson's translation of Virgil's first Georgic , a translation that makes up part of Benson's Virgil's Husbandry , published in 1725, Benson having translated the second Georgic in 1724. The burden of Benson's Preface is that Dryden's version of the Georgics is a bad one on several counts; in his notes he points out Dryden's indebtedness to Thomas May's earlier translation of the Georgics . He writes that "Mr. Dryden had [May] always before his Eyes, and, through Haste, I suppose, very frequently took two, or three Lines, even sometimes, five, or six, almost together, out of this obscure Author. There are in this Georgic, I believe, almost a hundred of Mr. May's Lines, very little altered, and in all the four Georgics, I believe there may be found more than as many hundred, if any Body has Leisure enough to make such a Search" (H1 v -H2 r ), a charge and an invitation he repeats within the space of one signature. What is interesting is that Benson, in his version of the first Georgic up to Dryden's couplet at lines 100-01, has thirty-one rhyme-words (eleven couplets and three triplets) either identical (five couplets) or similar to Dryden's, roughly one-third of the 101 lines. He has Dryden's "And chiefly Thou" (l. 30 in Dryden), "To thee alone the Mariner shall pray" for Dryden's "Then Mariners on Storms to thee shall pray" (l. 40) "groan benath his Toil" for Dryden's "groans beneath his Toil" (l. 70). All of which would suggest that for Dryden and his contemporaries, and Benson wrote a quarter of a century after Dryden's death, rhyme-words were thought common property. But the purpose of this analysis of Dryden's translation of the Eclogues is to assess the amount of Dryden's indebtedness to his predecessors, so as to demonstrate that some part of his excellence, especially in a telling word or phrase, is derivative. It may appear anticlimactic to suggest that the rapidity with which Dryden turned out his translation of Virgil, as well as all of his earlier translations, owes much to his judicious use of his predecessors. I suggest that Dryden had a kind of pattern in front of him, some opening lines or phrases, a string of end-rhymes, some closing lines or phrases (including end-rhymes), and here and there a striking word or phrase, all derived from one or more predecessors, which he then proceeded to fill in and occasionally to alter. It may also be worth noting for the pattern of one poem that he took part of his refrain line, "Begin with me, my Flute, the sweet Maenalian Strain," for the eighth Eclogue from Biddle's "Begin with me, my Pipe, Maenalian Layes." Chetwood, incidentally, has "To Maenalus my Pipes and Muse tune all your Harmony," evidence of Dryden's judgement in proferring Biddle and of the vast number of choices open to translators. I reprint below Dryden's version of the seventh Eclogue , the shortest of the ten, if one discounts the fourth and ninth, both translated by Dryden in the 1684 volume and hence not influenced by the translations in that volume as were his other translations for the 1697 version of the Eclogues . The italicized words are those Dryden could have derived from his predecessors. It must be understood that Dryden could have conflated previous translations, so that his line, "And Jove descends in Show'rs of kindly Rain" (83) probably, almost surely, is taken from Ogilby, "And Jove descends in joyfull show'rs of rain," and Adams (1684), "And bounteous Jove descends in kindly Rain." The order of words is not always the same, a simple example of which is Dryden's "crown" in the rhyme position in line 35; it is not in that position in W. L's line. Objection will arise to the inclusion of single, relatively unimportant words, but sometimes they dictate the form a line will take and, in any event, the entire analysis is meant to be suggestive rather than definitive. A word like "abject" (l. 58) is another matter, however; I am convinced, such is the distance between it and other versions of the line, that Dryden owes it to Biddle. It is also worth noting that Dryden's eye-rhymes at lines 30-1, high/Mortality, come at that juncture where W. L. has versifie/bee.</field>

If, as I believe and hope to demonstrate in another article, Dryden borrowed extensively from the Fourth Earl of Lauderdale for his translation of Virgil, one should also add the following to the possible indebtedness in the seventh Eclogue : said (the rhyme-word in l. 9, with which Lauderdale rhymes "speed"), wanton (l. 15), bending (l. 16), Lambs/Dams (ll. 21-2), ever fair and. . . young/inspire my Song (ll. 27-8), crown (l. 39, in the rhyme position) bewitch (l. 40), Parian (l. 45, without justification in Virgil's Latin), chaws (l. 60, Lauderdale has "chew," also in the rhyme position), leafy shades (l. 67). Most interest attaches to Dryden's use of the 1684 translations, hence I list the lines in his version of the Eclogues (always except the fourth and ninth, which he translated himself for the 1684 Miscellany Poems ) most directly indebted to those translations.

It will be noted that I have listed eighty lines; there are the sixty-nine of the table above plus eleven of the phrases. Dr. Johnson, tracing the relationship between Pope and William Warburton in his life of the former, quotes from or paraphrases a letter from Warburton to Matthew Concanen in which he writes, "Dryden I observe borrows for want of leisure, and Pope for want of genius." In the first edition of the Lives of English Poets , from which the above is quoted, Johnson had written "he tells Concanen that Milton borrowed by affectation, Dryden by idleness, and Pope by necessity." 13 Dryden took a little less than three years to translate Virgil, having already translated a few passages in his work; whether for "want of leisure" or "by idleness" there can be no doubt that he did borrow, and extensively, for his translation of the Eclogues .</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Determining Final Authorial Intention in Revised Satires: The Case of Edward Young by James E. May</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In editing a text with multiple authorities in linear descent, an editor ordinarily takes for his copy-text the first edition (or, in some cases, a thoroughly revised reprint or an author's holograph). This text he emends with the author's revisions, after separating them from compositorial errors. He normally gives preference to the last revision should several overlap since his goal is to reproduce the author's final intentions. Yet an author's last revisions are not accepted as "final" unless they are, as G. Thomas Tanselle has written, "an attempt to improve the work in terms of its original conception." 1 Tanselle concludes that, when an editor "chooses an authorial reading previous to the author's last one . . . his justification is that the reading is 'final' in terms of his view of the work as an organic whole and that the later reading either creates a new work or is an isolated alteration at odds with the spirit of the work" (p. 353). As examples of last revisions without final authority, Tanselle cites certain of Melville's changes in Typee which "alter the tone of the book and are not in keeping with the spirit of the original version" (p. 335). He would distinguish those revisions Melville made that alter the work's original conception from those that do not and then accept only the latter: "known authorial revisions must be divided into categories for editorial decision according to the motives and conceptions they reflect" (p. 336). As kinds of revision that might alter the original conception and require extraordinary treatment, besides those altering tone, Tanselle suggests those adapting the text to a younger audience (p. 334) and those removing discussions of issues that date the work (p. 336). Tanselle does not apply his editorial principles to any pre-Romantic satires or public poems, which often are loosely-coherent collections of diverse materials within a mixed form, and revisions to which cannot usually be judged by any principle of organic form. However, Tanselle's willingness to give special treatment to changes both to accommodate a different audience and to alter historical features suggests the usefulness of rhetorical and historical considerations in determining final authority in revised satires. Since satires and other forms of public poetry in their origin were usually intended to refer to historical situations and to achieve certain effects on a particular audience, the editor, in assessing final intention, should consider whether later revisions presuppose an audience and state of affairs different from those for which the work was originally intended. This editorial policy, appropriate to revised satires incorporating historical references within a persuasive appeal to a distinct audience, is examined in the following discussion of Edward Young's revisions to his satirical poetry. Most of Young's later revisions to Love of Fame (1725-28) were prompted by changes in the objects satirized or praised or in his or the public's attitudes. Some of these revisions that cause updating, even if not intended to do so, violate the work's original conception, and, so, should be denied final authority. The prerogative to deny final authority here depends upon Young's having conceived the work rhetorically, that is, following the advice of classical rhetoric, his having primarily chosen his theme, topical materials, ethos, and manner in order to achieve certain effects on a contemporary audience. But not all his revisions, even those that result in updating, violate his rhetorical interlocking of speaker, subject, and audience. This essay sketches a methodology and poses necessary historical questions for discriminating between those revisions to satires conceived like Young's that do not violate the rhetorical conception from those that do and, so, should be denied final authority. Many partly satirical poems are not primarily rhetorical in conception, nor do their conceptions require much historical reference. Yet when these poems, like Young's Two Epistles to Mr. Pope (1730), were revised after the passage of many years, they may lose much of their historical integrity. But, as we will see in the case of Two Epistles , the scholarly editor, if so inclined, still has several options for preserving the historicity of the earlier version. The revisions primarily discussed here occur in Love of Fame and Two Epistles when they were reprinted in the authorized Works of 1757 by the poet's friend Samuel Richardson. 2 The Love of Fame satires, after first being published in a series of seven folios (1725-28), were revised for a collected edition in 1728, when Young added a Preface and 12 lines, removed 24 and moved 4 lines, changed about 30 words or phrases, and overhauled emphatic capitals and italics. 3 But then, 29 years later, for Works 1757, Young removed a sentence from the Preface and 42 lines from a text of over 2500, although making no additions and introducing no more than three changes in phrasing. 4 Charles Frank's observation about the 1757 revision of Love of Fame , that "It was essentially an old man's way of revising and correcting," 5 can be applied with greater accuracy to the revision of Two Epistles . In 1757, the epistles, not previously revised, lost 70 of their 628 lines, but no phrasing changes or additions were introduced, not even to accommodate the omission of Epistle I's concluding lines. 6 Other early poems were similarly revised for this collected works: lines were deleted but none were added, and little phrasing was altered. 7 Thus, one cannot argue by analogy that Young carefully revised Love of Fame and Two Epistles for Works 1757. Since Young's 1757 revisions of those two poems almost exclusively involved deleting lines, and since he could have introduced those changes about 30 years after the first editions, the editor must scrutinize the revisions to determine if, to quote Tanselle, they aim "at altering the purpose, direction, or character" of the original works (p. 335). Young seems to have removed lines for three major reasons: to eliminate redundant and awkwardly-expressed passages, to increase structural coherence, and to remove dated opinions and public or personal references. Only the deletions designed to accommodate the poems to a new audience and state of affairs seem to require special treatment. The creation of this separate case is especially required for Love of Fame since it was conceived rhetorically for a particular situation. Love of Fame was contrived for a broad, contemporary audience, with an anonymous but persuasively-conceived speaker attempting to reform the behavior and attitudes of a particular society. Like most eighteenth-century satires, the poem lacks organic unity, containing parts that primarily fulfill formal and expressive intentions. 8 Young's formal intentions included the desire to write an Horatian satire with Juvenalian touches, which would rival Boileau's example and become a paradigm for English poets of what satire ought to be. 9 And he desired to expound his analysis of human pride, as in Satire The Last where he exposes the causes and effects of the love of fame (VII.117-158). But his rhetorical conception is paramount, and to its reformative purpose he subordinated design, ethos, thought, and style. He chose the Horatian kind with occasional Juvenalian severity on therapeutic grounds, as he did the thesis that the love of fame is a universal passion. 10 Similarly, Young deliberately addressed the current follies of English Society and historical persons who symbolized those evils. For example, he attacked current vogues for gambling and for deistical free-thinking, alluding to Mrs. Kemp's salon and to Anthony Collins' writings, and, for various vices, he singled out masquerade producer John Heidegger, Secretary of the Treasury John Scrope, and critic Charles Gildon. 11 Although many of his victims have Latin names, a key published by Edmund Curll in 1741 and marginalia in early editions, especially those in Horace Walpole's copy of 1728, show that contemporary readers thought the satires were full of historical references. 12 From such allusions to the contemporary milieu, Young made a deliberate appeal for authority. The same ethical strategy lies behind the panegyrics, which, although they function as ethical norms, also indicate the speaker's worldliness. The speaker demonstrates his familiarity with fashionable noblemen in the epistolary addresses to peers and statesmen, like the Duke of Dorset and Sir Spencer Compton, Speaker of the House, in panegyrical apostrophes within the text, like that to Queen Caroline, and in anecdotal references, like those to Lord Stanhope at the World Club or to the poet himself writing Satire V at Dodington's Eastbury estate. 13 This association with society's leading lights anchored the satire to historical reality and lent the speaker a social status that in a class society translated into taste and discernment. I stress the rhetorical conception of Love of Fame because the case for giving special treatment to revisions that alter a work's historicity is strengthened when the work, like most satires, is rhetorically conceived for a particular historical moment. (The extent to which different satires exploit the contemporary scene varies greatly; Pope's satires, for example, contain many more topical allusions than do Young's.) Love of Fame was more determined by its historical moment, by the fashions and ills of its age, than was Two Epistles . The second epistle was didactically conceived to express universal precepts about what has been, is, and will be the poet's true craft. Even the satirical first epistle, although it has some historical references, as to the Mint, to Elkenah Settle, and to gambling at White's Coffeehouse, 14 draws heavily on commonplaces from Horace and Young's immediate predecessors in literary satire, like John Oldham, and avoids attacks on particulars. Consequently, when Two Epistles was brought forth revised twenty-seven years after its first publication, few deletions occurred that can be attributed to Young's accommodating it to new rhetorical circumstances. But the new rhetorical situation attending Love of Fame 's 1757 republication dictated many deletions. The passage of time had called for certain adjustments of ethos, removed the relevance of several attacks, lent disruptive irony to one panegyric, and necessitated a few other changes for the fulfillment of the satire's reformative purpose. Although these changes cannot be said to have altered the "purpose" of the work, they did alter its "conception," provided what I am defining as "rhetorical conception" is compatible with Tanselle's use of the word. A satire like Love of Fame is sufficiently anchored to history that any attempt to remove materials because they later become ineffective conflicts with the historical integrity and, thus, the "spirit" of the work. In some cases a satire might be so extensively reshaped to suit new rhetorical circumstances at odds with the original as to prevent the confluence of the two authorities in an eclectic text. Changes and additions can so alter the style, materials, sentiments, and sensibility of the original poem as to create a distinctly new work or hodgepodge of the old and implicit new. Then an editor may be forced to edit two separate versions or to focus on one, while relegating the other to an appendix. 15 When deletions alone disfigure the integrity of the original, brackets, like those I will later propose for Two Epistles , may be useful. However, an eclectic text is possible for Love of Fame . The revised text of 1757 is not so much a new version adapted for a 1757 audience as it is one less adapted for a 1720's audience: it has merely become less anchored to any time or place, more universal, which, according to some definitions of satire, makes it less of a satire, more of a moral poem. The revised edition is not timeless or fully accommodated to 1757 but still contains most of the dated references in the first editions or introduced in the revisions of 1728. Its value to literary historians of the 1750's is almost nil, but the first editions, as well as the revised second, have considerable value to historians. Scholars approach the poem as the first formal verse satire of the century, as a prototype of Pope's work in the kind. They value it not only for historical insight into the 1720's but as an expression of the period, which shaped it and called it forth. So given the importance of historical circumstances to Young's original intentions, and to a lesser extent, the value of the satire's historical features to scholars, an editor should incorporate only those revisions of Love of Fame not intended to alter its original interlocking of a specific speaker, audience, and society. In editing Love of Fame this policy is compatible with the choice of first-edition copy-texts, required by the nature and number of the revisions. 16 The editor of revised satires ought to especially guard copy-text readings whenever publishers can be suspected of encouraging or performing the revisions. In the case of Young's satirical poetry, the nagging possibility that the printer Richardson collaborated with Young on the revisions or introduced them himself may influence the editor's attitude toward accepting the 1757 revisions. 17 But apart from his efforts to exclude non-authorial changes, the editor, by focusing on 1725-1728 copy-texts for Love of Fame , will be less inclined to admit revisions performed thirty years later which disrupt the copy-text's historical setting and thrust. Even if the revision occurred but a few years afterwards, the historical features of first-edition copy-texts ought to have some weight in editing satires. An editor is, of course, more likely to discern updating in revisions introduced after a decade or more, but, as I shall argue concerning one revision in the 1728 octavo of Love of Fame , it is possible to identify revisions forced by historical change even after a few years have elapsed. Assuming the theoretical validity of denying final authority to certain 1757 revisions of Love of Fame , the editor preparing an edition based on the 1725-1728 copy-texts now faces the difficult task of separating the revisions compatible with the satire's original rhetorical conception from those detracting from it and, so, lacking final authority. Since he would preserve not the full historicity of the first editions, but only those historical features integral to the work's rhetorical conception, the editor will find it helpful to divide the revisions into three classes: 1) those due to a change in the referents, such as a person's ceasing to deserve praise or censure, 2) those due to a change in the public's attitude toward the referent or the author, and 3), without regard to these changes in the world or in public opinion, those due to a change in the poet's opinion or beliefs. Only revisions that fall into classes one and two tamper with the work's original rhetorical conception and, so, should receive special treatment as revisions without final authority (unless one's edition is limited to the final version). The editor must allow Young the freedom to change his mind, to remove old opinions or even to introduce new ideas, provided these changes were not intended as responses to new rhetorical circumstances, even though in a strict sense they affect the historicity of the poem. For example, in the revised octavo of 1728, Young introduced four lines into Satire The Last's general exposition of the causes and effects of the love of fame. They added a providential purpose for this universal passion not noted in the first edition: our desire for fame "Confirms society ; since what we prize / As our chief blessing, must from others rise" (VII.155-158). These lines, without internal flaws, were removed in 1757, probably because they interrupt the coherent development of ideas before and after them. In 1728 Young wanted to say his say, but in 1757 he was less concerned with developing his thesis than with removing artistic flaws, which is suggested by his never adding, only removing, lines. Since Young's original conception of Love of Fame seems to entail the subordination of thematic materials to a reformative and satiric intent, the editor is forced to honor as final his deletion of these lines. Nor can he argue that the omission detracts from the historical anchoring of the poem so important to its rhetorical conception. For several of Young's deletions it is difficult to say whether some change in the rhetorical situation, either in the referent or the public's attitude toward it, had wrought a change in the poet's opinion. For instance, the editor must consider whether Young deleted from Satire III six lines attacking opera (III.209-214) because opera or public attitudes toward it had changed by 1757, or because, without regard to historical circumstances, he merely wished to alter his expressed opinion. If the passage had been originally part of an expressive pattern conceived apart from the rhetorical inter-locking of speaker, subject, and audience, and Young had simply changed his mind, then an editor would honor the deletion. However, in Love of Fame there is no such pattern of self-expression, and the attack occurs in a series on topical luxuries; so, the lines probably should remain, the omission ignored as a rhetorical adaptation to historical change in opera and its reputation, provided such change can be verified. In the 1757 revision of Two Epistles , a more complicated problem involves the removal of the satirical portrait of Lico (Ep. I.133-140), a foppish poet whose vainly worn "scarlet" stockings are set incongruously against his poverty: "He stands erect on silken, scarlet legs, / His Figure bullies, tho' his Fortune begs." Excluding for the purpose of discussion the possibility that it was struck for redundancy or dullness, the character could have been removed owing to any of the three historical changes outlined above. In 1757 the satiric attack may have become obsolete if scarlet stocking were no longer worn by Grubbian hacks or fops, or if they were then worn by people of fashion. On the other hand, perhaps the rhetorical circumstances had not changed, but the elder Young now found distasteful the extended attack on poets more for their poverty than their poetry. The editor's difficulties here are complicated further since the public may have come to understand Lico as referring to Ambrose Philips, whom Pope had satirized for wearing "red Stockings" in his "Macer, a Character." 18 If Young had originally intended Lico to be a satiric glance at Philips, and if he removed the portrait because he now thought better of Philips or simply thought the manner of attack disreputable, then the editor would accept the change as an altered opinion. Conversely, if Young deleted the portrait in response to the public's misreading the generalized Lico as Philips, then the editor would ignore the deletion as an accommodation for a new audience. The same set of questions must be asked concerning the couplet deleted from the satirical portrait of the speaker's "friend" Hilario , whom some have identified with Jonathan Swift. 19 Similar considerations apply to panegyrical materials removed in 1757, like the couplet praising Simon Harcourt. This is a problematic deletion since the context, a discussion of the true patron, invited Young's actual testament to his supportive readers. Yet this self-expression is a rhetorical device for authority and occurs in a formal imitation of Horace. 20 Young wrote that for some authors there are "large-minded" patrons who appreciate and guide their efforts: Who serve, unask'd , the least pretence to wit; My sole excuse, alas! for having writ. Will H---t pardon, if I dare commend H---t , with zeal a patron, and a friend? (IV.203-206) Young cut the couplet on Harcourt, although he let stand those that follow praising other patrons. It may be as difficult for the editor to ascertain the poet's intention for revising the passage as it is to establish a hierarchy of his several original intentions. But, after making that critical judgment, the editor will accept the deletion as final if the original praise was expressive in intent and if its removal was prompted by Young's change of heart. And, if the praise of Harcourt was removed as weakening a bid for authority, due, say, to his ill-repute in 1757, then its removal may not deserve final authority. In another satire with a different rhetorical conception, a poet might with final authority remove lines praising a person who had become disqualified as a norm, but, since Young avowedly anchors his persuasive appeal to historical material, we must refuse final authority to adjustments not only of speaker and audience but of victims and norms when they were prompted by historical change. Although in the previous cases the editor will labor with a complicated knot of possibilities to determine whether changes in the society or in only the poet probably caused the revision, there are deletions in Love of Fame that were clearly forced upon Young by new rhetorical situations and by new historical circumstances. In one 1757 alteration, Young responded not to any physical change in what he had referred to nor to any change of heart but to a change in the speaker-audience relation. In this instance, Young deleted the following couplet from a sketch of a femme fatale : "Thrice happy they! who think I boldly feign , / And startle at a Mistress of my brain" (VI.63-64). This emphatic gesture was appropriate to the anonymous vir bonus , but the work's 1757 audience, inclined to biographical fallacies, knew that the pious rector of Welwyn was the author. Thus, the reader's inability to separate speaker from poet probably required the removal of the speaker's self-conscious exclamation. We can also be nearly certain that earlier, in 1728, Young dropped the concluding lines of Satire The Last to adjust the poem to new historical circumstances, specifically to the recent death of George I. Young had originally closed the satire, published in January 1726, with a clever hyperbole referring to George I's stormy and delayed voyage back to England in December 1725 after negotiating the Treaty of Hanover. In the first edition, lines 211-224 depict the King in danger at sea, lines 225-234 praise the concerned Prime Minister for not sleeping at England's Helm, and lines 235-246 depict England's joy upon the King's return: What smile of Fate, what Blessing can attone For Brunswick 's absence?—his Return alone. Tho', late, thy delegated Stars shone bright, And shed a wholesome Influence, still 'twas Night; The Nation droopt; but, now, with ravisht eyes From Ocean's lap, she sees her Sun arise. 21 When the poem was reprinted in March 1728, Young dropped lines 235-46, for, with the King's having died less than a year earlier, the celebration of the "smile of Fate" and George's symbolic triumph over the seas of chance would have seemed ironic or even ludicrous. Today, with George I and II long dead, these lines are no longer inappropriate or ironic, and an editor will reintroduce them since the poem's original conception entails an English audience in 1726. Most panegyrics allude to contemporary figures and are designed for particular audiences and occasions, but, when the work as a whole does not share that rhetorical conception, the author can delete or alter those panegyrics without bringing different intentions to the work. For instance, Young has several laudatory digressions on contemporaries in his narrative poem on Lady Jane Gray, The Force of Religion (1714); 22 his removal of these passages in 1757 only complemented his narrative design and must be considered a final revision. However, in Love of Fame the panegyrics are integral to both structure and strategy, and in Satire The Last Young made a deliberate bid for authority by putting to poetic use the headlines of the preceding month. For several revisions previously discussed, the public, by misreading the poem, may have functioned as a disapproving editor, forcing Young to alter his original readings. An interesting parallel to those adjustments to a new audience—where the historicity of the first editions may be disrupted by anterior readings—involves the poet's removing names and dedications from Satires II and V, presumably to satisfy the persons praised. Young intended to publish all seven satires with dedications, as he indicated to Thomas Tickell in November 1724: "I propose publishing one after another directed to people of Fashion" (Pettit, p. 36). Besides gaining financial favors from the patrons, the dedications served the structural function of balancing censure with virtuous example and the rhetorical function of rooting the satire in contemporary life. There is evidence that Satires II and V, without public dedications, were originally, and remained silently, dedicated to Richard Lumley, the second Earl of Scarborough, and Henrietta Howard, mistress of George II and later Countess of Suffolk. Satire II has a dedication in the body of the poem (ll. 95-100) and two panegyrical passages to someone whose name had been elided (ll. 201-204 and, in the folio only, ll. 291-294). Later, in the Tonson sixth edition, 1763, the separate title for Satire II carries a dedication to "the Earl of Scarborough," who had died in 1740, and the two-syllable blanks in lines 95 and 291 and the three-syllable blanks in lines 92 and 201 are filled with " Lumley " and " Scarborough ." 23 Since this edition introduced 38 entirely new lines from a manuscript antedating folio publication, these names probably reflect Young's original intentions, which were overruled by Scarborough. Similarly, we know from Horace Walpole's annotated copy of Love of Fame 1728 that he supposed his neighbor Mrs. Howard's name belonged in the blank before the panegyrical set-piece in Satire V. 24 If her two-syllable surname also belongs at line 11, and if the claim there genuinely speaks of her modest refusal of open praise, then, as the praise of " Henrietta " at IV.210 also argues, Young did not elide her name to avoid difficulties with Princess Caroline or to avoid a disreputable norm. When an author introduced changes at the request of a patron, who, like a publisher, prevented the fulfillment of a rhetorical plan, the editor may decide to reintroduce the earlier readings. However, there would have to be strong evidence for the authority of the hypothesized readings, stronger than that offered above for Mrs. Howard's name. Also, the poet's original conception must define the primary audience to be the general public, and not the inner audience of the epistolary frame or the apostrophes. In admitting these anterior readings, the editor would be denying final authority to certain copy-text readings and interfering with the historicity of the copy-text. The editor of Love of Fame can construct a text preserving the author's final intentions while also conserving the historical spirit of the original. This is possible because the historical details of the first editions are so important to the work's primarily rhetorical conception. That solution is not accessible in editing some poems, including Two Epistles . Although Two Epistles was addressed to Pope and treats much the same topics as poems contributing to the Dunciad controversy, 25 even the satirical first epistle was not contrived to participate in the current quarrels within the literary scene and is remarkably free of particularized attacks. Moreover, the second epistle, as W. L. Mac-Donald noted, "may bear the interpretation of advice to any writer," without regard to time or place. 26 In short, the editor predisposed to protect the historicity of and all the critical observations in the first edition of Two Epistles cannot do so by claiming that later revisions violate the work's conception for a particular historical occasion. He cannot claim that any revision aside from the omitted Lico portrait was intended to update the poem or adapt it to a new audience. Yet, as is surely often true of revised poetry, the poet's removal of 70 lines lessens the value of the work to literary scholars by detracting from its historical integrity. For instance, in 1757 Young struck eight lines from an extended comparison of hacks to serpents (Ep. I.269-276). The resulting image is now free of the over-extension for which Young was attacked later in the century, but the original reflects the baroque excess of the age of The Dunciad . Other 1757 deletions remove topics characteristic of the earlier period, as the attention to wit and the reliance on the court as a standard in the advice "Courts know no such Creature as a Wit" (Ep. II.100), or the admonishment not to import thoughts from France and to avoid "easy writing" (Ep. II. 225-232). For all these changes one can posit literary motives quite compatible with Young's original design and intention. Also, an editor cannot argue that the changes represent new, or updated, critical positions since, over four decades, Young's criticism is remarkably homogeneous. Nevertheless, even though Young's 1757 revisions to Two Epistles were not intended to update the work or to alter its original purpose or conception, some or all of the revisions still might perhaps be denied final authority for violating in fact whatever conception the original had. Thus, one might argue that Young's original intention in Epistle II of expressing a body of coherent criticism outweighs certain 1757 deletions designed to remove passages with redundancy and obscurity. In particular, two passages, apparently struck for excessive refinement, state truths central to Young's critical theory yet not expressed elsewhere in the epistle: the first is on the value of sincerity in composing (Ep. II.59-70), and the second advises satirists to copy the art but not the subjects of Greek and Roman writers (Ep. II.201-206). If the editor can argue that these deletions weaken the thesis that the original poem was called forth to express, he could perhaps convincingly argue that the poet's 1757 intentions, either in specific revisions or within the revisions as a whole, must be considered different, and not final, intentions since they contradict the purpose and thrust of the original. This argument makes the theoretical assumption that stylistic and structural revision, not intended to alter the original purpose and design, can indirectly and unwittingly disrupt the poet's original conception, which might occur were the poet sufficiently uninvolved with the work as to throw out the beans with the weeds. 27 In general, if an editor cannot argue that a poet's revisions bring different intentions violating his original ones, but if he values the first edition's historical integrity more than the poet's final intentions, then he might choose to produce a text without final authority. After removing press variants and errors from the copy-text, to preserve the historicity of the first edition, he can relegate to textual footnotes or an appendix either all later revisions or—if he chooses—only those that disrupt the historical integrity of the original. The editor of Young's Two Epistles , in order to reproduce for literary historians more bibliographical evidence and a more informative text, might best adopt the former of these editorial methods and abandon the orthodox goal of reproducing the final authorial readings. Since the only revision in 1757 was the deletion of 70 lines, he might reprint a corrected 1730 copy-text with the deleted lines placed in the text within brackets. He can justify his neglecting the poet's later revisions by arguing the importance of the lines deleted in 1757 to historical scholars, who primarily approach the work as an historical document rather than an aesthetic object, as a compilation of remarks rather than as an artistic whole. Since in 1757 Young seems to have intended not to alter his critical opinions, but only to improve the poem's artistic merit, his revisions do not have much if any importance to the history of criticism. In consequence of using the line numbers of the longer original, the editor can list in his historical collation the variant substantives in editions between 1730 and 1757, variants that would otherwise not ordinarily have been listed yet are important in establishing the transmission of the text. An edition like that described here, which—with or without brackets—reprinted readings later omitted by the author, would not produce a text with final authority, but the edition would be "critical" in so far as its notes and apparatus would indicate the author's varying intentions, and its textual introduction and notes would hypothesize which intentions have final authority. In this essay, I have tried to apply the editorial principles of final authorial intention to revisions of satirical and quasi-satirical writing that is rhetorically conceived for a historical moment or that has a largely historical value to scholars. Although this application has solely concerned deletions, nearly all introduced decades after the work's original publication, these have been treated in the same manner that other kinds of revisions would be handled, as, for instance, additions made shortly after publication. As with all revisions, the editor will use his historical and critical skills to construct a hierarchy of the poet's intentions while composing and revising in order to determine which revisions are compatible with the work's original conception. However, rhetorical and historical circumstances and features are more often central to the conceptions of satires, like Love of Fame , than to those of other kinds of literature. The satirist usually derives his poetic impulse from his participation within the contemporary scene, conceives his work for an audience specific to time and place, and fleshes out its design with topical references. Thus, after intensive historical scholarship, the editor of a satire may well find that later revisions, like certain deletions in Love of Fame and Two Epistles , were responses to historical changes and to new rhetorical circumstances and, so, probably should be denied final authority.</field>

Publication and bibliographical information about these and other editions of Love of Fame and Two Epistles to Mr. Pope can be found in the Textual Introduction and the Description of Editions Collated of my "Critical Reader's Edition." In several respects, this essay represents a rethinking of editorial decisions in that edition. 4 The following readings in Love of Fame 1728 were omitted from Works 1757: The sentence "If they like not the fashion . . . of his aim" (sig. A3 r ); Satire II.109-110; III.63-64, 209-214, and 259-260; IV.205-206; VI.63-64, 547-548, and 591-610; and The Last (VII), 11. 155-158. Three variant phrases in Works 1757 that may be authorial occur in the Preface (on sig. A2 v of the 1728 text) and at II.232 and III.114 (see the textual footnotes to my edition). Throughout this essay, quotations and line numbers derive from the Tonson 1728 edition of Love of Fame , unless otherwise noted. 5 "Edward Young's Satires: Materials for an Edition of Love of Fame ," Diss. Princeton, 1939, p. 53. 6 The following lines in the 1730 edition of Two Epistles , printed for Lawton Gilliver by John Wright and published in January 1730, were omitted in Works 1757: from Epistle I, lines 133-140, 269-276, and 327-332, and from Epistle II, lines 11-12, 59-70, 99-102, 167-68, 201-206, 213-214, and 225-244. Throughout this essay, all quotations are from and all line numbers are to the Gilliver edition of 1730. 7 Of Young's early poems reprinted in Works 1757, only A Paraphrase on a Part of the Book of Job (1719) did not lose lines. A Poem on the Last Day (1713), revised thoroughly in 1715, lost 84 lines when revised for Works 1757. Young deleted digressive and panegyrical passages and also several with imprecise and obscure language. In addition, one passage seems to have been struck on doctrinal grounds and another as redundant. The Force of Religion (1714), when first revised in 1757, lost 48 lines, involving panegyrics addressed to contemporaries, a moral digression and a lengthy comparison which slow narrative progression, and three passages with obscure phrasing. In both Last Day and The Force of Religion no lines were added for Works 1757, and Young's primary concern, apart from removing obsolete eulogy, was structural coherence. 8 Passages with primarily formal conceptions take their excellence, or derive their satisfaction, from the completion of generic and stylistic patterns or forms, as when Young closely imitates topics in Horace's or Juvenal's satires. Passages with primarily expressive conceptions seek fulfillment in the exposition of thought and feeling. The two halves of this theoretical distinction are more or less evident in formulations of the doctrine of imitation between the Renaissance and the Age of Johnson. 9 Young's programmatic design to write an Horatian satire is evident at Satire I.45-46 and within the Preface (sig. A4 r ); he speaks of adopting Juvenal's morality and manner in the Preface (sigs. A4 r -A4 r ), where he invites comparison to Boileau by slighting his satires for excessive severity and repetition. The envoy published with Satire VI also compares Young's satires to Juvenal's and Boileau's; there, although he raises these poets above him, he also insists that his satire " cuts herself a track , to you unknown " (VI.607). Within the poem, passages with primarily formal intentions include the self-conscious gestures in the envoy or in apostrophes to the muse and the apologies for satire, which frequently contain apostrophes (as Satire III.251-264). 10 Young's preface argues the superiority of Horatian satire over Juvenalian on therapeutic grounds (sigs. A3 r -A4 r ). Both Frank (pp. 144ff.) and Bruce Wilson ("Studies in the Formal Verse Satires of Edward Young 1683-1765," Diss. Minnesota, 1971, p. 70) have argued that Young's thesis was conceived to be a structural frame allowing diverse satiric victims. 11 See, respectively, Satire VI.471-480, VI.407-416, III.213-244, I.275, and VII.137-138. 12 Curll's key was published in Works 1741 on sigs. U1 r -U2 v of volume I. Walpole's copy is now at the British Library, catalogued as C.45.c.8, and his marginalia on Satire V are conveniently cited in the notes to that poem in Sherard Vines' Georgian Satirists (London: Wishart, 1934), pp. 193-195. 13 See, respectively, Satire I.1-10, IV.1-14, VI.573-584, I.93-94, and V.265-266. 14 See, respectively, Epistle I, 11. 111-118, 277-284, and 101-110. 15 See Tanselle's discussion of when revisions require the editing of separate versions, which relates Fredson Bowers' editorial solutions for several extensively revised texts (pp. 337-347). 16 As I have indicated in "The Authority of Accidental Variants in the Tonson Second Edition of Edward Young's Love of Fame ," Young did revise certain classes of accidentals in 1728, but there are still advantages to using the first editions as copy-texts and emending them with the accidental revisions of 1728. 17 In view of the use of the corrupt Works 1741 in composing the 1757 texts of Love of Fame and Two Epistles and, especially, of Richardson's assistance in the composing and revision of Young's The Centaur Not Fabulous (1755) and Conjectures on Original Composition (1759), both of which he printed, we may be concerned whether Richardson had a hand in the 1757 revisions of both poems. Extant letters record Young's requesting and accepting his friend's suggestions for both prose works and Richardson's sending detailed advice ( The Correspondence of Edward Young 1683-1765 , ed. Henry Pettit [1971]; on The Centaur , see pp. 410-422, and, on Conjectures , see pp. 440-455 and 484-493). Young and Richardson could have collaborated on the revisions during one of their four known visits to each other's houses during the 15 months prior to the publication of Works 1757 (pp. 437, 438, 452, and 453 of Pettit record the visits; the Works was advertised in the June 1757 issue of The London Magazine and announced earlier on 21 May in the London Evening Post ). That Richardson made or suggested revisions for the poems in Works 1757 is perhaps implied by Young's comment to him on 20 January 1757: "For the admirable addition to my last poetry all thanks are due" (Pettit, p. 452). If someone other than Richardson had printed the authorized works, we could be more confident that Young alone introduced the deletions in Love of Fame and Two Epistles . 18 The Twickenham Edition of the Poems of Alexander Pope , VI, ed. Norman Ault and John Butt (1954), 137-138. Joseph Spence, remarking that "Philips was a neat dresser and very vain," recorded an amusing repartee by Swift which glanced at Philips' foppish dress ( Anecdotes, Observations, and Characters of Books and Men , ed. James M. Osborn [1966], I, 340, item no. 844). Also, Philips had a reputation for physical temerity, evident in Young's remark to Thomas Tickell perhaps concerning Pope's "Macer": "Pope in his Part abuses Philips, very intrepidly since ye sea is between them" (Pettit, p. 56). Thus, what appears to be an allusion to Lico 's vain dress, "His Figure bullies" (l. 136), could allude to another of Philips' traits. 19 Frank, noting a marginal comment to this effect in a copy of Works 1741, first suggested that Hilario referred to Jonathan Swift (pp. 51 and 177). However, the proud Dean, like the intrepid Philips, would never have silently tolerated a satiric character, and there is no evidence that Swift, who spoke well of Young's satires as late as 1732, suspected Young had criticized him. So, although Swift and Philips may have contributed hints for fictional characters, it seems unlikely that in either Hilario or Lico Young contradicted his expressed avoidance of particularized attacks ( Love of Fame , sig. A2 r ), especially when the individuals, fellow poets, were neither vicious nor public nuisances. Nevertheless, Young could have removed the Lico portrait because readers, perhaps Philips himself, mistook the general for the particular. 20 Compare Horace's catalogue of his readers, also used as a justification for composing: 'It is enough that Plontinus and Varius approve of these Verses; let Maecenas, Virgil, and Valgius; let Octavius and Fuscus, best of men; and let but the Viscus brothers give their praise" (Ep. I, x, 83-85, Satires, Epistles, Ars Poetica , trans. H. R. Fairclough, Loeb Classical Library [1926; rpt. 1970]. 21 The Universal Passion. Satire The Last (1726), ll. 241-46 (p. 12). 22 The Force of Religion (1714), Book I, ll. 11-12, and Book II, ll. 1-12 and 296-315. 23 Love of Fame (1763), pp. 27-43. Frank first called attention to the new readings in this edition (pp. 57-62), though he incorrectly supposed that the pre-publication manuscript formed the printer's copy for this edition of Satire II. See my "A Critical Reader's Edition," pp. 112-114, on the new readings in the 1763 edition and, pp. 99-102, on Young's dedications. 24 Sherard Vines, noting Mrs. Howard's name beside the panegyrical set piece (ll. 343-64) in Walpole's copy, suggested that her name also belonged at l. 11, where the poet defines the satire as indirect praise of a lady ( Georgian Satirists , pp. 193-195). Young later wrote to her around 1730 to request that she argue his case for preferment to the King (Pettit, pp. 67-69); her influence with the King may explain Young's praise for her in Satire V. His office as chaplain to Princess Caroline (later Queen) may partly explain why the dedication, if it was to Mrs. Howard, remained silent. 25 On Two Epistles' relation to the war of the dunces, see my "A Critical Reader's Edition," pp. 13-15 and 85-88. 26 Pope and His Critics (1951; rpt. 1974), pp. 196ff. 27 In denying final authority to some of Melville's last revisions to Typee , Tanselle characterizes them as "not part of a sustained and coherent reshaping" but "instances of sporadic tinkering" not consistent "with the spirit of the work" (p. 341). Here Tanselle seems to require the consideration of not only the revision's effect on the work but also the degree of the author's involvement in the revising.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Sons and Lovers : The Surviving Manuscripts From Three Drafts Dated by Paper Analysis by Helen Baron</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sons and Lovers is the autobiographical novel of an author whose biography has, since his death, rivalled his art in commanding the attention of readers and critics. The two years he spent writing his four drafts of the novel (October 1910 to November 1912) witnessed the most momentous events in his life: his mother ("my first, great love") 1 died, he left his teaching job for the risky experiment of living by his pen, he went to live out of England for the first time, and he began sharing his life with Frieda Weekley; he also brought to an end his long relationship with Jessie Chambers, and was engaged for fourteen months to Louie Burrows. The four drafts that he wrote in those two years bore witness to his efforts progressively to understand and face or evade the implications of those events while living through them. Lawrence himself called the work "autobiography" ( Letters , I, 490), but it was no simple record; by writing it he was examining a central life-problem that was Oedipal in character, and doing so not only before Freud's theories had made their impact on Europe, but also through the medium of the novel rather than the treatise or essay. His method of arriving at his conclusions was to renew his efforts at interpretation with each successive draft. Thus the sequence of drafts would show the steps by which he made progress in the uncharted territory of psychological self-analysis, and how he learned to reconceive the potentialities in the novel form for the purpose of such fictional-biographical exploration. The full drafts would therefore show more than developments in style, they would reveal how Lawrence brought into shape an innovative work of art; in addition, they would document his oscillations between one interpretation and another as he pondered the conflicting pressures in his personal history, and they would provide some insights into the emergence of his verdicts. Echoes of a conflict between rival viewpoints linger on into the published novel in the recurrent tones of judgement, accusation and self-justification. This tendency of the novel to sound like a debate has been reinforced from without by the existence of Jessie Chambers's rival interpretation in her memoir, written after Lawrence's death. 2 All these complexities cause the surviving early drafts to be the subject of a more intense and varied curiosity on the part of readers of the novel than many an author's "foul sheets" would necessarily be. But because each draft is so intimately bound up with Lawrence's life in those two years, it is not enough simply to read and compare different versions; we need to know as closely as possible when the surviving pages were written. Alas, not everything has survived, but in addition to the complete final manuscript miscellaneous portions from previous drafts are extant. No serious attempt has been made to date these and discover how they all relate to each other. The University of California published in 1977 a beautiful photographic facsimile of the Sons and Lovers manuscripts acquired in 1963 and held at the Bancroft Library, Berkeley, which include not only the final manuscript itself but some rejected sheets from earlier drafts. 3 The editor, Professor Schorer, labelled these sheets "Fragments" and divided them up at follows: Fragment 1 Chapter I pp.1-8 2 pp.26-36 3 Chapter II pp.44-45,46a-49a,46-58 4 pp.68-69 5 Chapter III pp.68-82 6 Chapter IV pp.83-85 Fragment 6 is in fact a continuation of Fragment 5: no pages are missing between the end of chapter III on page 82 and the beginning of chapter IV on page 83. Professor Schorer registered his surprise (p.[3]) that Fragment 4 contained page-numbers also found in Fragment 5: the answer to this enigma is that Fragment 4 belongs to a different period of composition from all the other Fragments except the inserted pages 45, 46a-49a of Fragment 3. Any reader of the facsimile of the final manuscript itself is bound to notice that it contains long and short sequences of varied paper, some sections of which have had their page-numbers altered once or even twice. Did these renumbered sections originally belong to earlier drafts? If so, which drafts? When were those passages written? How do they relate to the other, discarded, portions of drafts: the Fragments at Berkeley and the manuscripts now held at the Humanities Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin? It is strange that Professor Schorer made no mention of the latter, for they had been described in print (albeit not wholly accurately) by Harry T. Moore; 4 and they were the only Sons and Lovers manuscripts listed in the edition available to him of Warren Roberts's scholarly and authoritative A Bibliography of D. H. Lawrence . 5 The University of Texas H.R.C. has held since the early 1960's a 271-page manuscript of an early draft which is there labelled The Paul Morel Manuscript ; and in November 1980 the Center also acquired a twenty-three-page section from a draft written in Lawrence's hand but annotated with crititisms and revisions by Jessie Chambers. It is well known that Lawrence tried to improve his progress with the writing of this novel by involving in the process of composition at several stages one of the main participants in the life-history recounted therein, Jessie Chambers. As a result she wrote for him biographical notes, and critiques of his drafts, some of which have fortuitously survived. The existence of her marginalia shows that she also wrote her objections and criticisms on the manuscript of the novel itself, and the result is a richly suggestive document. The acquisition of this manuscript completes the H.R.C.'s holding of the small selection of Jessie's written contributions to Sons and Lovers known to have survived. The others are three episodes and two commentaries, making six manuscript sections in all. It has never been satisfactorily established how these Jessie Chambers manuscripts (labelled the 'Miriam Papers' by Harry T. Moore 6 ) relate either to each other or to the successive drafts of Sons and Lovers . When my co-editor and I were pondering our microfilms of the surviving manuscripts in Cambridge, England, in preparation for a study of the originals in Berkeley and Austin, and wondering whether it would be possible to settle some of these unanswered questions, the significance dawned upon me of a remark in one of Lawrence's letters: "The 112 pages of Paul are pages such as this on which I write. Am I a newspaper printing machine to turn out a hundred sheets in half an hour?" Letters I , no. 264. Did Lawrence's expostulation contain a clue as to where the key to this jigsaw-puzzle might be found? That letter, written on 9 May 1911 to Louie Burrows and now held at Nottingham University Library, was written on a 21-lined paper which had been torn off a pad with the aid of such large perforations that the sheet had acquired a markedly "serrated" top edge. These same features, 21 lines and a serrated top edge, appeared to be present also (as far as one could tell from a microfilm) in the first surviving pages, 72-165, of The Paul Morel Manuscript . Were some of these the pages Lawrence had been referring to in that letter? Did he regularly write letters on the same paper that he was using for his novel (and stories and poems)? If so, the letters, as physical documents , would provide a dated framework for reconstructing the history of the layered manuscripts and miscellaneous fragments that have survived. Preliminary study of the holdings in the library of Nottingham University gave me reason to believe that some correlations would be revealed if we undertook as full a survey as possible of the relevant documents. Nearly all the extant letters written between October 1910 and November 1912 are now held in the Nottingham University and County Libraries, the H.R.C. at Austin and the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library. Some comparison of manuscripts of the novel with letters could be made physically at Austin, but for identification of paper-types between the various library holdings some form of sufficient paper-description needed to be devised. The comprehensiveness of James T. Boulton's The Letters of D. H. Lawrence Vol. I 1901-1913 permitted us the great convenience of referring to each letter by the enumeration in that volume (which also gave economical identifications between letters written on the same day and even to the same recipient). In the larger period September 1910 to May 1913, that we chose prudentially to cover, there are 402 items in Letters I (Nos 178-579). Of these, 83 are postcards and one was written on a concert programme; 6 survive only in typed copies and 27 as quotations in books, newspapers or private communications; a further 9 letters are in private hands; 7 are at UCLA 7 and one at the University of Indiana. 8 The remaining 268 original letters we examined and described for comparison with the paper-types found in the 882 surviving leaves of manuscripts of the novel. In this article I report the results of the research, beginning with an account of the problems encountered, the methods evolved and the picture that emerged of Lawrence's habits in the use of stationary. The grid of descriptive questions we assembled reflects the range of paper-types being covered, and the terminology we settled for reflects the practical rather than theoretical emphasis of the task. Scholars engaged on similar projects, whether in relation to further manuscripts of D. H. Lawrence or to other authors, may perhaps benefit from the information and adapt the techniques described here. Then, although a wide range of results flows from the precision in dating made possible by the paper research, this article is confined to explaining the chronology of composition and interrelations between the surviving portions of drafts in terms of paper-batches. This information is summarised in two tables at the end: they provide the essential factual foundations for readers of the California facsimile who wish to develop their observations about Lawrence's revisions. Lawrence's statements in his letters give an outline composition history of Sons and Lovers as follows. It was written, in effect, in four stages: Lawrence wrote four drafts starting from the beginning each time and he conducted a separate, thorough revision of one draft; but he did not complete all these four stages. He wrote Stage I (unfinished) from October to December 1910; Stage II (unfinished) from 13 March to July or October 1911; Stage III he began on 3 November 1911 and continued until perhaps 19 November when he fell ill, and then after convalescing he began again sometime between 9 and 23 February 1912 and finished on 11 April 1912; on 3 May he took this IIIa manuscript with him to Germany, and Stage IIIb was a revision of this version carried out from 16 May to between 2 and 9 June 1912; in September he arrived in northern Italy where he wrote Stage IV from 7 September to 19 November 1912. The paper research modifies some of this outline as well as providing dates within which each sequence of paper was used. After the completion of the manuscript stages, the novel was further altered during the ensuing months. First, the publisher's reader at Duckworth's, Edward Garnett, reduced its length by a tenth by crossing out passages throughout the final manuscript. Secondly, Garnett sent the edited manuscript direct to the printer, Billing and Sons in Guildford, where it was used as copy: the compositors introduced a few substantive variants and thousands of changes in punctuation. Finally, two rounds of proofs were revised by Garnett and Lawrence before publication on 29 May 1913. The change of title from 'Paul Morel' to Sons and Lovers during composition is not perfectly reflected now in the labels by which the surviving manuscripts are known. From his very first mention of the novel in October 1910, Lawrence called it Paul Morel, and it was not until mid-October 1912, when he had written three-fifths of the final manuscript and only a month before he completed and despatched it, that he used the title Sons and Lovers . Therefore all the references in Lawrence's letters during those first two years, that is for almost all the manuscript stages, are to Paul Morel. But Paul Morel is the name now given at the H.R.C. to the 271-page manuscript (largely of Stage II) held there, and Professor Schorer (pp. [2]-[3]) suggested the title Paul Morel or PM 3 for the Fragments at Berkeley. In this article Lawrence's uses of titles in letters will be quoted as they are printed in Letters I ; 'Paul Morel' will be the form for referring to mention of the novel in the records for that period; The Paul Morel Manuscript will be used for the H.R.C. manuscript of Stage II; the "Final" manuscript for the complete manuscript of Stage IV, and "Fragments" for the discarded pages at Berkeley; the "section" of chapter IX for the twenty-three pages of a draft held at H.R.C.; the "remains" of Stages IIIa and b for the reconstruction of that draft from the surviving evidence; and "items" for the distinct manuscript sequences belonging to the so-called "Miriam Papers".</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Paper Research Because we were concerned with distinguishing between a number of similar papers by minute differences in measurement, it was helpful to refer to them not by the trade names for the different paper-sizes but by their distinctive fine-measurements which we made entirely in millimetres. The height of each leaf needed to be measured at both side edges and the width at both top and bottom, because in some batches they varied, and if Lawrence reversed a page the variation could give a false impression of a different paper-batch. Many of the later papers were large sheets folded into quires, and because these had been torn unevenly down the fold it was necessary to reassemble conjugate leaves to make accurate measurements across the width. We chose, in fact, to trace all the patterns of conjugate leaves and original quires, but these are not recorded in Table 1. They led us to discover that Lawrence, who wrote on one side of the paper only, left the quires intact and occasionally inserted leaves from earlier drafts among the pages of the quires. When Garnett edited the manuscript he crossed out text and wrote the delete symbol in the margin with the quires still intact, so that some of his writing which overflowed the fold is now on the reverse of conjugate leaves. It is most probable that the quires were torn in the printing shop for distribution to the compositors. We found the use of a micrometer for measuring paper thickness (calibration) in hundredths of a millimetre very helpful; but measurements needed to be taken at various points on a page because some papers had uneven density. Describing the colour of paper is problematic, not only because most papers are a variety of white, but also because they discolour with age differently according to the different conditions in which they have been kept by their various owners. Dr. Philip Gaskell of Trinity College, Cambridge, whom I consulted about this research, suggested we should assemble a collection of samples of papers of graduated colour shades and label them numerically. This excellent advice we did not have time to follow, and the resulting colour descriptions we resorted to served only as subjective aidemémoire . In the end, colour difference did not constitute the sole basis for any identification—despite the one very distinctive blue paper, which also had very distinctive line-numbers—and I doubt if in advance we would have thought to extend the range of samples to cover the variety of flecked-brown papers Lawrence acquired by the Lago di Garda. Many of Lawrence's papers, especially the early ones bought in England, were lined and we had to develop a number of definitions for distinguishing between them. The greatest problems presented by this enquiry concerned the very similar pads of uniform lined paper that Lawrence used while writing the now critically dispersed Stage IIIa draft. These papers, of 24 and 26 lines (see the e,g,k and h,j,l papers in Table 1), are easy to confuse; and to make matters worse he used further similar pads in his letters which do not occur in the surviving remains of the novel. Therefore, in addition to the routine measurements of spaces between lines (only the averages of which are given in Table 1), spaces above the top lines and below the bottom lines (which for convenience we called "top and bottom margins") and any side margins, we also paid attention to the direction of the slope with which the lines were characteristically printed on the page (or which characteristically resulted from the way the blocks were cut), to the quality of the printing, and whether the lines were printed differently on front and back of the paper. As a result of my preliminary discussion with Dr. Gaskell, we decided upon five categories to define paper quality, 9 which turned out to be very useful. The first two categories were the characteristics the paper displayed by transmitted light, its "See-through features", consisting of transparency or density and the presence or absence of watermarks. Degrees of transparency were often significant, and although there were few watermarks they appeared and disappeared in clear-cut sequences in the letters, and this contributed useful dating evidence for the novel. The other categories of paper quality were descriptions of the general impression the paper-finish displayed to the eye under normal and raking light. Under the heading "Finishing features" we recorded whether the paper was shiny or matt; whether it was flexible or brittle (including our impression of the noise a page made when shaken if this was a significant corroboration of its stiffness or suppleness); and its calendering. "Calendering" was not recorded when paper was "laid", that is, had chain-and-wire lines; most of the papers were "wove", but we doubted whether the labour of measuring the mesh would be rewarded with the clear distinctions we were looking for, and instead we recorded as an aide-mémoire our impression of the surface patterns under a raking light. These various subjective descriptions of finishing features were, like paper-colour, only corrective or supportive of any identification, made primarily on the basis of measurements, lines and watermarks in combination with idiosyncrasies such as the "serrated" top edge. Finally, under the heading "Format" we recorded any evidence of the form the paper batch had taken whether pad (i.e. glued block), quire or sheet. We found that some single sheets showed evidence of being torn from a pad while others from the same pad had been torn off without any betraying mark being sustained. When Lawrence went back to Croydon to continue teaching (after his mother's death on 9 December 1910) he wrote his letters on a wide range of papers. If he was writing from his lodgings in Colworth Road it included not only pages from the supply he was using for his novel or poems, but also mourning notepaper with black edges and Colworth Road headed notepaper. When he wrote letters from school he used pages torn from school registers or exercise books, or even Croydon Education Committee headed paper, and, once, an Accident Report Form. When he went to stay with people he used their headed notepaper; and the letter on a concert programme also comes from this period. From 19 November 1911, when he fell ill, to 28 February 1912, there was a sudden change from this miscellaneity to a simple sequence of good-quality letter-writing paper. He started the first, watermarked "Court Royal", on 15 November and finished it on 13 December 1911; the second, watermarked "Classic Parchment", was then used equally consistently from 17 December 1911 to 7 January 1912. That last letter on Classic Parchment was the first he wrote from his place of convalescence, Compton House, Bournemouth; he then discovered the guest-house's supply of headed notepaper, and set his Classic Parchment aside to use up later (10 February to 17 April). After his return to Eastwood on 9 February he was mobile again and inevitably his letter-paper became miscellaneous again (once the Classic Parchment was finished), and began to include the lined paper he was currently using for his novel and poems. Then when he went abroad in May 1912, his letter-paper became, if possible, even more varied; but it did include the two surviving papers introduced in Stage IIIb and four of the six new papers used for Stage IV. 10 In the surviving manuscripts of Sons and Lovers there are nineteen different papers. These I have labelled in alphabetical order (omitting i and o ) to correspond with the chronological order of their use in the manuscripts, using capitals for the papers first introduced in Stage II ( A-D ), then lower case for those first used in Stage IIIa ( e-l ) and IIIb ( m-n ), and capitals again for Stage IV ( P-U ). Lower case is used for Stage III for instant recognition because of the difficulties presented by the dispersal of the manuscript remains of this draft. The character of the sequence of papers in the manuscript drafts of the novel is from cheap-quality lined papers in England to quires of unlined paper in Italy, where Lawrence wrote much of the novel out afresh for Stage IV. The information derived from the letters needs to be used with care for a number of reasons. Lawrence used several uniform pads of lined paper, and while sequences of similar paper distinguish themselves from each other by physical comparison in the body of The Paul Morel Manuscript or the Final manuscript and Fragments, transporting these fine distinctions for comparison with individual letters of one or more leaves in libraries many miles distant needs to be done with cautious scepticism to prevent misidentifications. Furthermore, Lawrence must often have had a variety of papers in use simultaneously and used them at intervals (as can be seen with the S paper in Table 1). On the other hand, some papers are very distinctive, and because they make their appearance in the letters for a short period and then disappear, they do provide real evidence about the novel. If this evidence is used with circumspection and in conjunction with the other information available, not only does it establish a number of facts, it is indeed the sole means of answering some questions. Table 1 Table 1 takes each paper in chronological order of its use in the drafts of the novel, which is identical with the order in the letters except for paper S , and provides for each a description which is sufficiently full to help in the recognition of most papers. Where it has been possible to identify any paper in other works the details are added below each description, but this question has been investigated only in the collections at Nottingham University Library; the Bancroft Library, Berkeley; H.R.C., Austin; and the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library. Finally, the letters written on the same paper are listed by their numbers in Letters I and their dates. Table 2 Table 2 lists the surviving pages 11 of each draft of the novel, and shows the sequences of paper-types within each manuscript. The survivals from each stage of composition are in broad outline as follows: Stage I is lost; Stage II survives in large part, as 264 pages of The Paul Morel Manuscript , which lacks both its opening and concluding pages. Some pages were transferred by Lawrence into subsequent stages of composition and 13 are now in the Final manuscript. Seven unnumbered pages of the novel's opening now kept with The Paul Morel Manuscript do not belong to this draft, but will be shown below to have been an abortive start to Stage IIIa. Of Stage III proper, both a and b, 161 pages (probably about one-third) are preserved piecemeal in a variety of ways. There are the 58 pages of Fragments rejected by Lawrence during the writing of Stage IV, now in the Bancroft Library; there are the 80 pages that Lawrence transferred a few at a time into Stage IV, now in the Final manuscript; and there is the section of 23 pages from chapter IX now at the H.R.C. Stage IV is the Final manuscript in the Bancroft Library. Because Stages II, IIIa and IIIb no longer stand complete in their original form, part of the information in Table 2 is an abstract reconstruction. Many pages from these three periods of composition are now missing; and because those that survive are now dispersed in separate sections and in the Final manuscript, it is necessary to add to the brief information about each sequence of pages as they originally stood in each draft, a note of where those pages are now located. The dates of each draft are given at the head, and the dates of the paper's use elsewhere are summarised in addition (but the paper's use elsewhere is omitted if precise dates cannot be given, as for pages of the Love Poems MSS ). The version of the novel for which this exercise of reconstruction is most crucial is, of course, Stage III: it would be impossible to detect that the material on m paper belonged to Stage IIIb and not IIIa except by investigating the letter-paper. Similarly it is only possible to deduce that Lawrence wrote pages 1-74 of Stage IIIa before his illness in November 1911 from the fact that the paper ( f ) was used up during the next month in almost every letter, and then a new supply of paper followed with the same consistency. THE COMPOSITION STAGES The description below of the composition of the second and third drafts of Sons and Lovers follows as exclusively as possible two threads of interest: the information derived from the letter-papers about the paper-batches in the surviving drafts, and the new discoveries about the composition history. These two strands have to be extricated from the complex weave of Lawrence's other writing, the pressures and influences exerted upon him, and his various friendships during this period, the whole pattern of which cannot be recounted here, but brief sketches of which are given when they impinge directly on the composition of the novel. Stage II Lawrence's letter of 9 May 1911 (no. 264) containing the paper clue was one of eleven written between mid-March and the end of May in which he reported to Louie Burrows on his progress with the novel. In the first, of 13 March (no. 236), he announced that he had begun 'Paul Morel' again and added that he feared it would be a "terrible" (i.e. a painful) novel. He made the same announcement to two other people in the next two days and then did not mention the novel again until 12 April (no. 254), by which time he was beginning to worry about his rate of progress. He told Louie: "I have just done one folio, a dozen MSS pages, of Paul Morel. That great, terrible but unwritten novel, I am afraid it will die a mere conception." By "just" he seems to have meant "just now" and not "only". These folios must have been among the opening 71 pages which are now missing, for the first pages that survive (pp. 72-165) are the "serrated" paper, now labelled A paper, which Lawrence began using for his letters in his next letter to Louie of 24 April (no. 256). He did not use folios again until page 255. The anxiety he expressed on 12 April deepened, and on 28 April (no. 259) he wrote to Louie in an outburst that could be read as an appeal for moral support: "Do you know I simply cannot work. I have done only about five pages of MSS, 'Paul Morel'; and that only from sheer pressure of duty. I don't want to work: and I don't care a damn about it." She must have responded to the appeal, for three days later Lawrence was evidently making use of her encouragement to force himself through these initial difficulties (no. 261): "At your behest I wrote yesterday fourteen pages of Paul Morel, and I sit with the paper before me to continue when this is done." Then, three days after this, on 4 May (no. 262), he gave the first indication where he was in the text, and even recorded how he felt about what he had written so far: "I have written 90 pages of Paul Morel. I think about 7 of these pages may be called amusing, and 20 perhaps pleasant. The rest are "navrant" [i.e., distressing ]. I wonder how Paul will work out." Of these ninety pages, numbers 72-90 survive in The Paul Morel Manuscript . The first three were originally numbered 74, 75 and 76, and perhaps Lawrence renumbered them as he removed a few earlier pages. 12 The text on page 72 begins mid-sentence in the middle of a satirical scene in which Walter Morel, ill in bed, receives a visit from his boon companion, Jerry. The loyal friend has smuggled in for him a longed-for bottle of beer, and is moved to tears by the unwonted difficulty Walter has, because of his enfeebled condition, in swallowing more than a few grateful mouthfuls. This scene ends on page 77. The rest of the chapter recounts Walter Morel's convalescence, his rejection by the baby Paul, and Paul's casting aside by his mother into the hands of a nurse at the age of seventeen months because of the birth of Arthur. At this last event, Walter Morel, then Miss May (Miriam's governess, who was later to teach Paul to paint) and Mr. Revell (the local non-conformist clergyman) gather round Mrs. Morel's bedside to discuss the new baby. The chapter ends at the top of page 88, and a new one begins immediately on page 88: Chapter IV, "Paul Morel's First Glimpses of Life", which takes him from the age of three to six. By page 90 he had reached four and Arthur was "three and a half" (corrected by Louie to "two and a half"), and Lawrence had begun to describe Paul's fits of motiveless weeping. On 7 May (no. 263) Lawrence reported to Louie that he was on page 112 and found it all "very rummy"; then he reflected: "I don't think the last chapter of Paul has action enough, moves sufficiently. It is the bane of my life, to get the action of a novel hurried along." The new chapter that he had begun on page 88 went on to page 125, so by the "last" chapter he must have meant chapter III, described above. When Lawrence came to rewrite this chapter in Stage IIIa, his new chapter III contained a revised version of the same material. It began with the causes of Walter Morel's illness (now missing from Stage II) and continued with Jerry's visit to his bedside, his convalescence and the baby Paul's rejection of him, all modified but not changed a great deal. But the description of the birth of Arthur which followed was not only much abbreviated, but Lawrence even then deleted several lines of the new version at the end of the chapter (see Fragment 5). Evidently as he copied and modified the offending chapter, he identified its lack of movement with the scene at Mrs. Morel's bedside after the birth of Arthur. At this point the paper evidence provides information of a different kind. Every letter that Lawrence wrote to Louie from 24 April to 14 May 1911 (nos. 256-268), excluding one (no. 262) written from school, was on A paper— with the odd exception of one that he wrote from Colworth Road and dated 29 April (no. 260). In almost all of them (except those of 11 and 14 May) he gave a progress report on the novel: clearly he sat down to both tasks in the evening in front of the one block of paper. The letter-paper and manuscript dovetail so neatly here that the one odd letter arouses suspicion. On closer inspection it is evident that Lawrence wrote it not on 29 April as he dated it but on 29 May. (He had started writing April on 26 May, too, but corrected himself in time.) The dates of the Whitsun holiday that he refers to, saying: "This time next week we shall be going to Eastwood", were 5-11 June. With this letter, Lawrence sent Louie his 'Paul Morel' manuscript: "It's nine o'clock. I'm going to do a bit of Paul. I send you this mass. I'm afraid it's heterogeneous; since I have never read it through, very blemishy. Correct it and collect it will you, and tell me what you think. This is a quarter of the book . . . What will you think of it, I wonder. I want to take it to Ada at Whitsun." This letter needs to be re-dated, then, 29 May, by which time Lawrence might well have written a quarter of his novel. The next day, 30 May (no. 272) he wrote Louie a postcard in French enquiring whether the parcel had arrived and apologising for not putting enough stamps on. In what therefore turns out to have been the previous letter, of 26 May (no. 271), Lawrence had compensated for refusing Louie's request to see his manuscript poems, by promising: "But at Whit I will show you the first two hundred pages of 'Paul', that book of books." Then, having promised to show it to Louie personally, he changed his mind in favour of sending it for her to tidy up so that he could show it to his sister, Ada. He doubtless wanted helpful comments from both, but from neither could he expect the severe literary standards and independent knowledge and judgement of the material that Jessie Chambers had brought to bear on The White Peacock . 13 Because Lawrence was letting Louie read his manuscript nearly a week earlier than he had originally promised, the "mass" he sent her may not have been the 200-page length he had predicted on 26 May; and since page 166 is now missing, it is tempting to speculate that it was lost because it was the last page in the parcel. Page 165 is the last of the A pages, and page 167 is the first of B paper, a thin 27-lined paper very like one he used for his letter to Louie of 1 June. The supporting speculation thus suggests itself, that Lawrence sent her all he had written when he finished his perforated pad of A paper. On neither page 165 nor 167 is there a natural break in the text: the one ends mid-sentence, the other opens mid-conversation; but at the end of this chapter, on page 176, Lawrence started a new one on the same page, so that did not provide a natural break either. The two papers, A and B , are very different sizes, and while it is true that this alone could have caused the loss of page 166 at any time, it also suggests that the changeover may have seemed to Lawrence as suitable a break as any. Indeed, his evident haste, the suddenness of his decision to send the manuscript, his sense of its miscellaneity and his failure to put enough stamps on the parcel, all betray a degree of casualness that might easily result in loss of some sort. Lawrence described this portion as a quarter of the book, and if it was pages 1-166 the expected total would be 664 small pages and nineteen short chapters. But since he failed to complete this draft, and the end of the next is now lost, and the completed final draft was found to be too long, it is impossible to guess what length he envisaged at this stage. Chapter IV, "Paul Morel's First Glimpses of Life" (pp. 88-125), contained scenes from Paul's early childhood. Some were still present in the final draft, such as the evenings the children spent helping Walter Morel to make straw fuses while he told them tales of the pit; some were later dropped, such as a graphic account of Paul's participation in the games and candle-lit story-telling sessions of his elder sister Annie and her friends, and another of a day he spent on the ice in winter which led to an attack of pneumonia. Chapter V, "Acquaintances" (pp. 125-176), described Paul's convalescence and his childhood friendships with "Ginger" and Miriam. In this version Lawrence placed Miriam in the household he later used for The Lost Girl , with an invalid mother, an impractical entrepreneurial father, and a governess, Miss May, who taught her to play the piano. The break caused by the loss of page 166 occurs just as Paul and Miriam are playing with Paul's rabbit, Adolphus, in her house. The chapter ended with elegant tea at Miriam's house followed by angry tales of his father's drunkenness on Paul's return home. Chapter V ( bis ), "Launched" (pp. 176-207), was devoted to Paul's interview at Jordan's factory and his experience of working there. Again when Lawrence finished this chapter he began the next on the same page. Louie did correct the manuscript for him a little, though there were many slips that she overlooked. In the whole of the surviving manuscript there are only fifteen alterations and corrections in hands other than Lawrence's, and only eleven of them are unmistakably by Louie: they occur between pages 83 and 188. Her hand is distinctively even, rounded and upright or backward-leaning, and her alterations are minor one-word corrections of inconsistencies in names or dates, and small slips. She changed George to William three times (pp. 97,121); Job Arthur to Alec three times (p. 126); Muriel to Miriam once (p. 167) and three to two (p. 90). She also inserted till on p. 105, which was demanded by the context; wrote ois over Lawrence's spelling "chammy leather" (p. 188); and altered his "This was a lady" to "She was . . ." (p. 83). She used a thick black pencil from pages 83 to 126, and a very fine one from pages 167 to 188. If therefore, Lawrence had sent her pages 1-166, perhaps she had only reached page 126 by Whitsun, or had not noticed any errors thereafter, and then when they met during the holiday Lawrence gave her the continuation to read, which she marked using a different pencil. The few changes made in other hands are hard to attribute. 14 Lawrence may have asked his sister Ada to correct any errors she noticed. Jessie Chambers read the manuscript months later, and some further pencil marks appear to be by her (see below). After the Whitsun break, Lawrence gave up sending Louie regular progress reports on 'Paul Morel', but on 12 June, replying to Martin Secker who had written offering to publish his short stories, he humorously described his work on the novel (no. 274); "I stick at my third book like a broody hen at her eggs, lest my chickens hatch in a winter of public forgetfulness." But at some point during the summer he abandoned his post, probably during July (cf. nos. 280, 288) and possibly somewhere around page 353. What he had written was very different in many respects, particularly in its plot, from the eventual novel, Sons and Lovers . Around the central core of the Morels' married life as their children grew up, he had constructed a variety of fictional narratives. He had introduced a girl, Miriam, whose teenage friendship with Paul caused him conflict with his mother, but had placed her in a petty-bourgeois family setting; he had divided his own character between two Morel sons, the artisan but artistic Paul who worked at Jordan's factory, and the clever but spoilt and volatile Arthur, a successful college boy. Then, using a shocking incident that apparently occurred 15 in his uncle's family, Lawrence described the manslaughter of Arthur by his father. Walter Morel died soon after his release from prison, and by the end of the eighth chapter, Lawrence had engineered the amicable isolation together of Paul and his mother. In the next chapter he immediately began to introduce a thirty-year-old married woman, "a tall, silent blonde" called Frances who had left her husband, George Radford, after seven years of unhappy marriage. Some of the later pages of this chapter describing Paul's conversations with Frances, Lawrence transferred to the next drafts as he rewrote the novel, changing the name Frances to Clara. 16 Thus the last pages of this draft that have survived are pages 341-351 now in the Final manuscript, and p. 353 standing isolated at the end of The Paul Morel Manuscript , its text filling the page with Paul and Clara's unfinished conversation. Although Lawrence did not complete this draft, page 353 itself contains no indication of where he left off. On 17 July 1911 he had confessed to Louie that he had "not done any Paul lately" (no. 288), and in October he told her he had not done any for months (no. 316). The last twenty-five surviving pages are on D paper, which Lawrence also used for sixteen letters between 7 July and 20 October 1911. This might suggest that he renewed his efforts at the novel during the period from July to October, but it is unlikely, because for a long time he had been receiving attractive requests for short stories and poems, with the result that he was almost wholly occupied with stories from July to September and verse from early October. (This may explain why some of his verses for Love Poems are on D paper.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jessie Chambers and Stage II During October Lawrence's publisher, Heinemann, began pressing him to promise that 'Paul Morel', which Lawrence said was "half done", would be finished "for March" (no. 323). But when he turned to it again, he must have despaired of breaking through the block he had developed towards it during the summer, for instead of completing it, he suddenly decided to send the unfinished manuscript to Jessie Chambers and ask her opinion of it ( E.T. , 190). Relations between Lawrence and Jessie were very troubled during this period, and indeed were effectively at an end six months later. They had barely been in touch since they had met at the time of Mrs Lawrence's funeral in October 1910 and quarrelled about Lawrence's recent engagement to their mutual friend, Louie ( E.T. , 183-184). Lawrence had sent Jessie a complimentary copy of The White Peacock on its publication in January 1911, in gratitude for her help in writing it ( E.T. , 189), but he left her to discover from another mutual friend, Helen Corke, that he had started an autobiographical novel ( E.T. , 190) which was bound to contain reflections on his relationship with herself. It was through Helen Corke that Jessie met Lawrence again at this time: for it cannot have been by chance that he and Helen Corke both took their guests—his brother George, and Jessie, respectively—to the same performance at the Savoy Theatre in London on Saturday 7 October 1911. What Lawrence then sent Jessie, therefore, "some time" after this meeting, ( E.T. , 186), was The Paul Morel Manuscript now at H.R.C., together with the opening and latter pages which are now missing. Jessie had played a crucial rôle in Lawrence's first publications, both by sending his poems to the English Review ( E.T. , 156-159) and by "nursing" his first novel, The White Peacock , into existence (she records with some pride his tribute: "I its creator, you its nurse.") ( E.T. , 189). But in writing The Paul Morel Manuscript Lawrence had sought not only to exclude her but to replace her in her rôle of confidante and adviser with his fiancée, Louie Burrows, his engagement to whom Jessie had disapproved: "I told him he had done wrong to involve [Louie] in the impasse of our relationship" ( E.T. , 183-184). Therefore, even if Jessie felt it a pleasure or at least a welcome duty to respond to Lawrence's appeal for comments on his novel, she must to some extent have been predisposed against the manuscript. Twenty years later she included a critique of it in her memoir, E.T. , which would be the sole account of this draft in existence had The Paul Morel Manuscript not been preserved; but now her description can be read in conjunction with the original document itself. In a strongly written paragraph she summed up its inadequacies: its deadlocked, "story-bookish" plot (a word she had used of the first draft of The White Peacock ), and its "tired writing" which convinced her that Lawrence "had had to force himself to do it" ( E.T. , 190-191; cf. 116). Her phrases have an uncanny resonance with the remarks quoted above that Lawrence had made in his letters to Louie as he wrote this manuscript. And yet her judgements are not so pervasively true as her emphases would have them: much of the surviving manuscript displays Lawrence's characteristic vitality. More importantly, it is now evident that her account then continues with some curiously inaccurate statements: for, passing over in silence the father's manslaughter of Arthur in order to home in on Lawrence's treatment of "the mother's opposition to Paul's love for Miriam", Jessie wrote ( E.T. , 191): In this connection several remarks in this first draft 17 impressed me particularly. Lawrence had written: 'What was it he (Paul Morel) wanted of her (Miriam)? Did he want her to break his mother down in him? Was that what he wanted?' And again: 'Mrs Morel saw that if Miriam could only win her son's sex sympathy there would be nothing left for her.' In another place he said: 'Miriam looked upon Paul as a young 18 man tied to his mother's apron-strings.' Finally, referring to the people around Miriam, he said: 'How should they understand her—petty tradespeople!' Not one of these is an exact quotation from The Paul Morel Manuscript . This cannot be explained by the possibility that Jessie was quoting from parts of the manuscript now lost, for the central chapters devoted to Paul's relationship with Miriam have survived. The sentences that correspond most closely with Jessie's "quotations" are: He did not know what he was saying. Perhaps he wanted Miriam to rise and conquer his mother in him. There is no telling. (Ms. p. 268) If once Miriam was able to win Paul's sex sympathy and service, then he was lost indeed to his mother. (Ms. pp. 245-246) She told herself that he resented the maternal authority, that it irked him to be so tied to his mother, that he longed to be with her, Miriam. (Ms. p. 253) Miriam roused mistrust in everyone who misunderstood her: and as she was always misunderstood by colliers' and petty tradesmen's wives, she had a poor time of it. What were the women to think of a girl who was deferential, humble, almost pleading towards them, who yet had a haughty contemptuous soul in reserve, . . . (Ms. p. 329) How did this baffling discrepancy arise? There are three possible explanations: either she wrote this entirely from memory, or she used very brief notes made at the time, or she was inadvertently quoting from notes she later made of the Stage IIIa manuscript, the whole of which she read. The latter two alternatives are rendered doubtful by Jessie's declaration in a draft of her memoir: (Delavenay, 710) "I had to make a new start in life . . . So I found it was necessary to break every link that had bound us together, and I destroyed as far as I possibly could every line of his writing. I burned all the letters that I had kept, and even tore the fly leaf out of several books where he had copied poems for me." However, she may have failed to destroy everything or have saved, for example, a diary containing reflections or notes which she was able to turn to when writing her memoir. Too little of Stage IIIa survives to rule out the possibility that her quotations accurately represent sentences Lawrence had written there, but in the few remaining passages with which her "quotations" do have some correlation, the wording is even less close than that of the passages in Stage II. They are 19 : Mrs. Morel soon began to perceive the power that Miriam had over her beloved son, as Miriam well knew it herself. Only Paul himself was ignorant of it. Then began a struggle between the mother and the girl for the possession of the boy's soul. and: Miriam herself was angry with him for being at the beck and call of everybody. She loved him, he loved her, of that she was sure. But he would not acknowledge his love. He was inconsistent, and on some very vital points, quite childish, she said. When the equivalent passages in the published form of the novel are looked at, 20 it is clear that Lawrence developed the Stage II versions of them with a certain consistency in each revision: he steadfastly moved away from the suggestion that Miriam could win Paul's sex sympathy. This makes the third explanation of the discrepancy the most implausible. If, on the other hand, Jessie's "quotations" from Stage II represent the way in which she remembered at the age of forty-four something she had read at twenty-four, the gist of the sentences that had struck her had been transmuted in her memory into explosive and impatient formulations with the passage of time. In view of the fact that, as I explain below, the manuscript was only in her hands for two weeks, or at most just under a month, it seems to me marginally less likely that she would have developed sufficient familiarity with these passages to carry them in her memory for twenty years, and rather more likely that she had kept some sketchy notes. That would also give her the confidence to offer her sentences as quotations, since they would then be at least anchored in the key words which she had jotted down at the time. 21 Jessie did not write comments in the margins of The Paul Morel Manuscript as she did later in some parts of the next draft, perhaps because she knew Lawrence intended to rewrite it—or because she was not driven by it to the degree of anger and distress that was provoked in her by the next draft. But it must have been she who pencilled (non-punctuational) brackets around Lawrence's description of Miriam as a "woman who exists only to plunge herself into the mystical dark of life" (p. 246) 22 perhaps as a description she intended to challenge. In her memoir, however, she indicates that her reply consisted of more general comment and advice: ( E.T. , 191-192): As I read through the manuscript I had before me all the time the vivid picture of the reality. I felt again the tenseness of the conflict, and the impending spiritual clash. So in my reply I told him I was very surprised that he had kept so far from reality in his story; that I thought what had really happened was much more poignant and interesting than the situations he had invented. In particular I was surprised that he had omitted the story of Ernest, which seemed to me vital enough to be worth telling as it actually happened. Finally I suggested that he should write the whole story again, and keep it true to life. Lawrence may not have been expecting such radical advice, but, as Jessie explained to the French scholar, Emile Delavenay (670): "He took me at my word, and entirely recast his novel. He included also the story of our household, which I had not suggested." She did not specifically ask Lawrence to set the figure of Miriam in a portrait of the Chambers's home, but that was the effect of her insistence "true to life". Her concern in pressing for that seems to have been a desire for Lawrence to see, as she did, that the death of Ernest would prove a portent for Bert, too, should he prove equally unable to overcome his "strange obsession" with Mrs Lawrence ( E.T. , 192). I am pressing her remarks to conclusions which she deliberately—or delicately—resisted in her memoir ( E.T. , 192-193). She wrote of The Paul Morel Manuscript : "The elder brother Ernest, whose short career had always seemed to me most moving and dramatic, was not there at all. I was amazed to find there was no mention of him" ( E.T. , 191). She had forgotten the William of this draft, who appears to represent Ernest as a child, and whose name Louie had occasionally had to correct from "George" (the actual name of Lawrence's other brother). This oversight is not as strange as her failure to mention the Arthur of this draft. The astonishing climax of the plot, in which the son's vituperations of his father whip Walter Morel into such a blind rage that he hurls a poker at his son, and kills him, would be the first thing that most readers of this manuscript would mention in a summary. Jessie must have known the true basis for the story; presumably she found Lawrence's use of it melodramatic, or was not interested in his exploiting alternative narrative ploys for developing his subject. Her emphatic "no mention" of Ernest was related to her emphasis on his "short career": by comparison with the death of Ernest, which rendered his life-story "moving and dramatic", "poignant and interesting" and "vital", she must have found the death of Arthur "story-bookish" (the sentences about Ernest quoted above follow immediately upon the use of that word). Jessie's silent amazement at Lawrence's fiction of the death of a "brother", and the focus it gave to her advice, produced a radical and thought-provoking change in the novel. In the revision, the father is no longer the agent of his son's death, and the hatred for the father shown in Stage II thereby loses its central vehicle; the college boy is no longer represented, nor are the bitter denunciations with which he had whip-lashed his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stage IIIa: the start In Letters I Professor Boulton has dated Lawrence's letter to Jessie accompanying his unfinished manuscript of Stage II (no. 324) after the second of his two interviews at Heinemann's, on 5 and 20 October 1911, which appears from Lawrence's account (no. 323) to have been the more businesslike and specific. The fact that Lawrence and Jessie met on Saturday 7 October might suggest an earlier date; but Jessie herself could not remember whether the parcel arrived in October or November (Delavenay 670). The later date gives her just a fortnight to return the novel with her comments before 3 November 1911, when Lawrence started Stage III. For it is most unlikely that he began the new draft until the old had been returned, not only because he was waiting for Jessie's suggestions before deciding how to proceed, but also because, as is evident from the comparisons that can be made, Lawrence's method of rewriting was to place the discarded draft in front of him and transcribe it with modifications. On 3 November he wrote to Louie with the air of one putting on a yoke (no. 330): Tonight I am going to begin Paul Morel again, for the third and last time. I shall need all your prayers if I'm to get it done. It is a book the thought of which weighs heavily upon me. Say a Misericordia. . . I really dread setting the pen to paper, to write the first word of Paul—which I'm going to do when I've written the last word of this. This letter, like the two previous ones to Louie, was written on e paper, and when Lawrence had finished writing it he started his novel again as he promised, writing the first words on the same pad of poor-quality lined paper. For there survives an abandoned opening of the novel on seven unnumbered pages of this paper, which is now kept together with The Paul Morel Manuscript at the H.R.C. Being evidently the novel's opening, these pages are placed at the front of 'Paul Morel' Stage II, but in fact they post-date it by several months. The text runs out nearly half-way down the seventh page, a point at which Gertrude Morel had finally learnt that the young man, "a school teacher who was a good Latin scholar," whom she had loved at twenty, had subsequently "married his landlady, a woman of forty odd years, who had money". Lawrence had arrived at this point in a brisk 150 lines from the opening: "'The Breach' took the place of Hell Row. It was a natural succession. Hell Row was a block of some half-dozen thatched, collapsing cottages . . ." It is clear from the textual development that these seven pages preceded the two other versions of the opening which also survive: Stage III proper, partly in the Fragments and partly in the Final manuscript, and Stage IV in the Final manuscript. The shape remained the same, but by the time Lawrence had finished working it up, he took 310 lines to reach the same point. Lawrence was ill with pneumonia from 19 November 1911 till the end of the year, and convalescent until February. As mentioned above in the section on Paper use in Lawrence's letters, the evidence from his letter-paper is unusually clear-cut in this period. In summary, he used f paper, a fine quality paper, watermarked "Court Royal" with a shamrock, rose and thistle design, for his letters from 15 November to 13 December 1911. (He was so ill that some of these letters had to be written for him.) Then he moved on to another good quality paper, "Classic Parchment", which he used for all his letters from 17 December to 7 January, and finished later in Eastwood (after his return from convalescing at Compton House, Bournemouth), using it for every letter from 10 to 28 February and then intermittently until 17 April 1912. No "Court Royal" ( f paper) occurs again after 13 December 1911. This paper evidence leads to a number of conclusions: 1. The fact that Lawrence abandoned his first attempt of a draft of Stage III at the seventh (unnumbered) page, and began again, was not caused by his illness. 2. He began again on f paper, copying and modifying this seven-page draft, and proceeded to write pages 1-74 of Stage IIIa on f paper between dates after 3 November and before 19 November, when he fell ill. (On 15 November he wrote to Louie—on f paper—that he was "frightfully busy", "rushed", "squashed with work" and exclaimed: "Poor Paul, I don't know when he will be done . . . Now I will to Paul." no. 338) 3. At this point, because Lawrence was too ill to continue with this draft of his novel, his supply of f paper was assigned for letter-writing, and it was used up during the next month. 4. At page 74 (see Fragment 5) Lawrence had reached his satirical description of Jerry at Walter Morel's bedside about to produce the bottle of beer: page 74 ends mid-way through the paragraph: In the midst of their discussion of the malady, Jerry lowered his voice. If not at the end of it, Lawrence must have been somewhere on page 74 of Stage IIIa when he fell ill. 5. The first surviving page of the previous draft, Stage II, page 72 of The Paul Morel Manuscript , has the same one-sentence paragraph on its fifteenth line: Lawrence was clearly copying and modifying The Paul Morel Manuscript to produce the new draft. 6. This explains why The Paul Morel Manuscript survives from page 72 onwards, or at least why pages 1-71 are lost: this is the point at which Lawrence had stopped when he fell ill in Croydon. The earlier pages of Stage II, which he had already copied, he no longer needed and so presumably he left them behind or threw them away when he left Croydon for Bournemouth. The rest of the old draft he took with him back home to Eastwood so that he could continue copying it with modifications from the point at which he had left off. 7. This suggests that the lost seventy-one pages of the opening of Stage II were similar to the opening of Stage III, now reconstructable from the Fragments and Final manuscript. Certainly the two versions of the episode between Walter Morel and Jerry, which can be compared, are very similar. 8. One theory which suggests itself concerning the renumbering of pages 72, 73 and 74 of The Paul Morel Manuscript must be rejected. Because of the way Lawrence later transferred pages from an earlier draft to the current one instead of copying them out again, it might be thought that the altered numbers of these first-surviving pages of Stage II indicate that Lawrence had been tempted, on taking up Stage III again at pages 74-75, simply to incorporate the old material rather than write it out again, but that after three pages he changed his mind. This cannot be the case, partly because he did not delete the first fourteen lines of page 72, as he would have needed to do, 23 but mainly because these pages must have been first 74, 75 and 76, and re numbered 72, 73 and 74 (the last of them is particularly clear, as the original 6 is revised into a very a-typical 4) which is the wrong way round, even supposing Lawrence had made the error of altering the first of the three to 74 instead of 75, and so on. 9. Finally, it follows that when Lawrence took his novel up again between 9 and 23 February 1912, and said in a letter of 23 February (no. 392): "'Paul Morel' is going pretty well, now that I have once more tackled it," he had not begun from the beginning again, but took it up at page 75 on g paper—which, alas, does not appear in his letters, by way of tidy corroboration, because he was now using up his supply of "Classic Parchment".</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stage IIIa: the completion Back in November, when Lawrence had first received Jessie's suggestion that he rewrite the novel keeping it "true to life", he had responded by asking her to write down some reminiscences for him to use ( E.T. , 193). He did not need these for revising the opening seventy-four pages in Croydon, but soon after his arrival in Eastwood on 9 February, and probably before 23 February when he reported himself underway with the novel again—"early in the week" as Jessie recalled ( E.T. , 195), and therefore possibly Monday 12 or Tuesday 13 February—he visited her to collect her notes. On 4 February Lawrence had terminated his engagement to Louie, and he now wrote Stage IIIa with Jessie's moral support as he had written Stage II with Louie's. But the writing of this draft was more rapid, and as he lived nearer to Jessie he was able to give her pages of manuscript to read continuously as he wrote it, delivering them first by hand and later posting them. On 23 February Lawrence officially resigned from his teaching post, and he now worked single-mindedly on this novel, turning away nearly all other offers of publication, whether short stories or poems. There were, however, a few other things that he allowed himself to do. From 2-8 March he took a trip to visit some old friends including the Daxes in Shirebrook. 24 From 25-31 March he was in Bradnop, Staffordshire, in fulfilment of a promise to visit his old school-friend George Henry Neville. (During this period he also met, or re-met, Frieda Weekley.) All the while he continued to work hard at his novel, even taking it with him when he went to Shirebrook: there are letters on j paper on 1 March from Eastwood (no. 396) and 4 March from Shirebrook (no. 397), and on k paper on 6 March from Shirebrook (no. 399) and on 8 March from Eastwood again (no. 400), so presumably he wrote those parts of his novel that made the transition from the one paper to the other in Shirebrook. His sense of urgency derived firstly from his determination to fulfil as nearly as possible his deadline for delivery to Heinemann, which he now set at May. Secondly, he had received in January while ill an invitation to visit relations in Germany, which had apparently given him the idea of writing a book of travel sketches, 25 and he had at once set his heart on going in the spring. When it was that he also began to think of this trip as an opportunity for an affair with Frieda it is not possible now to know for certain. There are not the same detailed accounts in Lawrence's letters of his progress with this draft that there had been for Stage II, partly because of his direct contact with Jessie Chambers, and partly because she later destroyed his letters. Instead, there is an unusually full, and, in a sense, first-hand reminiscence in Jessie's memoir, written from her special perspective. At first sight there seems to be a discrepancy between her account and the impression given by Lawrence's letters concerning the date at which he completed this draft. Jessie recorded that it was written "in about six weeks" "at a white heat of concentration" ( E.T. , 204, 201) and implies it was finished before 25 March 1912. Lawrence's letters indicate that it was finished about 11 April, which was seven weeks from 23 February (the latest date by which he had taken it up again). In describing how Lawrence brought pages of the novel to her as he wrote it, Jessie does not state that he collected the pages she had already read, but gives the impression instead that he left it all with her to accumulate—as he must have done when he stopped bringing it personally and began to send it by post. This latter change may have had something to do with his trip to Shirebrook, but Jessie was convinced his motive was solely embarrassment at what he had done with her reminiscences, and, in effect, what he had written about herself ( E.T. , 201). When she had read the last pages, she proposed a date for a meeting, but Lawrence replied that he was already committed to visit Neville: since that visit took place from 25-31 March, he had, according to Jessie, completed the manuscript sometime before 25 March ( E.T. , 205). This is rather surprising in view of the fact that only on 13 March Lawrence had been predicting to Heinemann's editor, Walter de la Mare, that it would take him another month. 26 The most satisfactory interpretation is that Lawrence was allowing himself time for an immediate read-through after he had written to the end, and after Jessie had, like Louie, "corrected and collected" the manuscript and told him her opinion of it. On Monday 1 April, the day after his return from Bradnop, Lawrence visited Jessie to collect the novel and hear her comments. But she was so overwhelmed by the injustice she felt he had done her by his portrait of Miriam, that she declined the inevitable quarrel, and, instead, "put some notes in with the [parcel of] manuscript" ( E.T. , 210-211). That parcel must have contained the twenty-three pages that now survive annotated with Jessie's objections and revisions, together with four pages of commentary entitled Chapter IX in which she expounded her criticisms, and at least one of the episodes written out by her. 27 Thus the apparent discrepancy between E.T. and Lawrence's letters may be explained: when on 3 April he wrote to Edward Garnett (no. 411), "I shall finish my Colliery novel this week—the first draft. It'll want a bit of revising", he was presumably "finishing" it in the sense of pondering Jessie's criticisms and perhaps rewriting chapter IX—now too disfigured to submit it to a publisher—and tidying up the other pages she had annotated. For example, on page 311, which was later transferred to the Final manuscript (where it became page 352), Jessie had pencilled in a correction of fact on the bottom line, overflowing to the top line of the next page. Lawrence did not rewrite the pages but penned his slightly different revision over hers so as to obliterate hers. His text had first read: Miriam read this letter a thousand times. It was very dreadful to her. Jessie's correction, which is hard to read now, was intended to replace "a thousand times": twice, after which &lt;it was&gt; she sealed the envelope. Paul had given it her opened. A year later she broke the seal to show her mother the letter. Lawrence overwrote this in ink changing the first two sentences to: twice, after which she sealed it up. On 11 April, after a week of (I suggest) such work on his manuscript, he reported to Walter de la Mare at Heinemann's (no. 415): "I have finished in its first form the colliery novel. Now I want to leave it for a month, when I shall go over it again. There are parts I want to change. Shall I send it to you for your opinion now at once, before I do any revising, or shall I pull it closer together before you see it?" There is nothing in the surviving 'Miriam Papers' to suggest that Jessie had advised him to pull it together: perhaps this was the result of his reading it through during this week. In the event, he took it to Germany on 3 May and revised it there. Lawrence called Stage IIIa the "first draft" and the "first form" of the novel because he had recast it so radically it no longer resembled Stage II, and because now that he had produced the first version of the whole in the form it was ultimately to take, he wanted to work it up. Unfortunately the end of this version is now lost, but Lawrence did give a clue as to how long he expected this draft to be when he wrote to Edward Garnett from Shirebrook on 6 March 1912 (no. 399) that he had "done two thirds or more". This letter was written on k paper, and the changeover from j to k paper, which happened in Shirebrook, took place between pages 281 and 309. If this was two thirds, the whole would be about 450 pages. (By contrast, the Final manuscript was 533 pages, much of it written much smaller on much larger paper.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The remains of Stage IIIa Very little of Stage IIIa now survives: 139 pages in seven sequences on six different batches of paper (not including the sections of D paper transferred towards the end from Stage II). These are pages 1-85, 182-192, 204-226, 272-281, 309-315, 317-318, 328-331 (the D paper of Stage II became pages 332-333 and 337-347). The papers are f to l , of which f, j and k only are found in the letters. The largest sequence is the opening eighty-five pages on f and g paper, constituting chapters I-III and the opening of chapter IV, of which the first seventy-four pages are the "Court Royal" pages which Lawrence wrote before his illness. The opening chapters are the part of Stage IIIa that Lawrence seems to have copied most closely from Stage II, but because the first 71 pages of Stage II are now lost, and pages 86-181 of Stage III are also lost, there are now only twenty pages of close overlap between these two versions: Stage II pp. 72-91 and Stage III pp. 74-85. However, the fact that certain episodes from the beginning of Stage II are also found in Stage IV—notably the making of straw fuses and Paul's interview at Jordan's—means it is very probable that despite the eventual divergence of plot, the overlap between Stages II and III continued beyond what now survives of Stage III. This is particularly significant because of another curious inaccuracy in Jessie Chambers's memoir. In her description of the beginning of this draft, she selects for praise, as if now written into the novel for the first time, two passages that she must have read (very little different) in The Paul Morel Manuscript ( E.T. , 197-198): The early pages delighted me. Here was all that spontaneous flow, the seemingly effortless translation of life that filled me with admiration. His descriptions of family life were so vivid, so exact, and so concerned with everyday things we had never even noticed before. There was Mrs Morel ready for ironing, lightly spitting on the iron to test its heat, invested with a reality and significance hitherto unsuspected. It was his power to transmute the common experiences into significance that I always felt to be Lawrence's greatest gift. He did not distinguish between small and great happenings; the common round was full of mystery, awaiting interpretation. Born and bred of working people, he had the rare gift of seeing them from within, and revealing them on their own plane. An incident that particularly pleased me was where Morel was recovering from an accident at the pit, and his friend Jerry came to see him. The conversation of the two men and their tenderness to one another were a revelation to me. I felt that Lawrence was coming into his true kingdom as a creative artist, and an interpreter of the people to whom he belonged. However much one may agree with Jessie's praise here—leaving aside her failure to notice Lawrence's ironies at the expense of Jerry and Walter Morel (which included that the latter's illness was caused by drink and not by an accident at the pit)—she implies that it was in this draft, written with her advice and moral support that Lawrence first described those everyday things she had not noticed before. But her examples were both present in The Paul Morel Manuscript, and the description of Mrs Morel ironing (which survives intact amidst radical alterations in the Final manuscript) 28 was very probably, like the other scene, copied with modest revisions into Stage IIIa. In view of the fact that Jessie wrote equally forcefully of the stale, tired writing of Stage II, her emphatic praise here must reinforce the suggestion made above that she had been predisposed against that manuscript. Chapter I, "Antecedents", has survived complete in its Stage IIIa form: pages 1-43 (of which twenty-four pages were eventually retained in Stage IV). It was similar in outline to the revised chapter I in Stage IV (that is, largely as published), but Lawrence had not yet introduced the small boy William's arrival for lunch and visit to the Fair, or Walter Morel's return home after helping at the public house and his brief conversation with his wife before the authorial voice resumes the story of her antecedents. In Stage IIIa, while Mrs Morel waited for her husband to return from his holiday trip to Nottingham, Lawrence offered some authorial reflections on her disappointment with her marriage, such as: 29 Walter Morel had given his wife children, according to the doctrine of Schopenhauer. But he would not take from her, and help her to produce, the other finer products, blossoms of beautiful living of which he might make wisdom like honey, and dreams like worship. Therefore she refused him: also, fearfully, she combated [ sic ] him. She was too much of a woman, too much of the stuff of life, to despair for herself. She was still fast producing life, and religion of life for her children. followed by descriptions of the stifling kitchen and the relative emotional states of the two partners that evening before they met and quarrelled, such as (Fragment 2, p. 34): It is a question whether she was more intoxicated with suffering than her husband with drink. He came at about twenty past eleven. He was not drunk, but in that wound up state of intoxication whose precious calm and equipoise is easily shaken, when a little readjustment is irritating to make, when real thwarting maddens. All of this Lawrence dropped at Stage IV in favour of the dramatic inspiration of having Morel arrive just as his tired and heavily pregnant wife is engaged in the effort of pouring hot liquid from a large saucepan. Chapter II, called "Birth and Death", then "Birth and Horror" and then simply "Birth", can also be reconstructed almost intact at Stage IIIa: pages 44, 46-67. This was the only one of the first three chapters that Lawrence modified at Stage IIIb. Eight pages from Stage III (a and b) were eventually retained in Stage IV, but the rest of this version of the chapter was only revised a little as it was copied into the Final manuscript. For example, at Stage III Lawrence had not yet had the idea of describing Morel working at the pit before coming home to discover that Paul had been born; he also introduced in Stage IV some remarks about the older boy William's distress at his mother's pain and his dislike of the new baby—but these were deleted by Garnett when he pruned the Final manuscript. Finally, at Stage IIIa chapter II had ended with Walter Morel's escape from his family to the local pub on the Sunday evening following the Saturday night row in which he had struck his wife [with a drawer]. (It was at Stage IV that Lawrence added the semi-comical coda of Morel's half-hearted attempt to leave home with a bundle of possessions.) Chapter III, numbered at Stage IIIa pages 68-82 and called first "Aftermath" and then "Morel Reaps the Whirlwind", was all rejected and rewritten at Stage IV, and is now entirely found among the Fragments. As described above, it opens with the causes of Walter Morel's illness, and continues with a revision of the Stage II version of chapter III: Jerry's visit, the baby Paul's rôle in disturbing the brief harmony between Mr and Mrs Morel during Morel's recuperation (which was re-used in Stage IV but deleted by Garnett) and finally a severely abbreviated account of the birth of Arthur. (A very brief remark at the end of the chapter, on the young life of William, was the seed of expansion to many pages in the Final manuscript—of which Garnett deleted a great deal.) Chapter IV, "Glimpses of Early Life", of which only three pages now survive (Fragment 6 pages 83-85) is also a revision of Stage II. It begins with the successful relationship between the handsome baby Arthur and his father, contrasted with the sickly and colourless Paul who followed chattering at his mother's heels all day; and the pages run out at the familiar account of Paul's fits of motiveless weeping. All this material occurs in modified form in chapter III of the Final manuscript, where the chapters are fewer and longer. As one looks from the opening three and a bit chapters of Stage IIIa back to the earlier versions—the overlapping first twenty extant pages of The Paul Morel Manuscript (pp. 72-91) and the seven unnumbered pages of the abandoned opening—and then forward to the much revised final version of the work, certain general impressions emerge. Lawrence's first inspiration seems to have been the single thread of his mother's jarred existence in the alien, recently built mining village, with her memories of her betrayed youthful and romantic optimism still very vivid to her; and he only gradually diversified that rather static narration of bitterness with the dramatic accretions of the lives of other members of the family, particularly William. Jessie's recommendation with regard to William bore fruit progressively: aspects of his youth had already been included in Stage II; his death was now entered at her suggestion into Stage IIIa (see the account of h paper below); but further aspects of his childhood and early manhood were introduced as Lawrence rewrote the novel. It seems that Lawrence's perception of William's rôle developed along the lines Jessie had had in mind slowly, 30 and accumulated momentum as he rewrote the novel; and it might be added that Garnett made an error of perception when he pruned much of that growth in the early pages. In Stage III Lawrence's tone towards Walter Morel was more lighthearted, Mrs Morel's resentment of her husband was occasionally alleviated by humour and Lawrence's treatment of both was more even-handed at the outset of the narrative. Then, although the movement of the later drafts was less static, had more of the action that Lawrence found it so hard to instil, the bitterness became more relentless, the humour more scornful. From this point on, the surviving pieces are more fragmentary, and it is here that the identification by paper-types is most useful. Of the two sections of h paper, the first, pages 182-189, narrates the death of William from the moment of Mrs Morel's arrival at his bedside, as far as Paul's subsequent illness. The fact that these pages, written for the first time now in response to Jessie's advice, were eventually incorporated into the Final manuscript shows that Lawrence established them largely to his satisfaction at the first writing. (The narration was completed on three pages of g paper, 190-192; see Table 2.) The second sequence on h paper is the twenty-three page section of chapter IX, pages 204-226, the whole of the chapter except its opening pages. This is the longest surviving sequence of Stage IIIa apart from the first three chapters, and is the equivalent of chapter VII of the published novel: it relates Paul's teenage friendship with Miriam and was rewritten because of Jessie's many objections. The part of Stage IIIa on j paper, pages 272-281, which constituted the end of a chapter and survives because Lawrence found it satisfactory enough to transfer bodily into Stage IV to be the end of chapter VIII, recounts the terrible and pivotal scene of Paul's quarrel and reconciliation with his mother: It was not the first time Lawrence had written up this exchange, for he was here further developing it from The Paul Morel Manuscript and A Collier's Friday Night (Act III). In other words, this scene was one of the foundation episodes present in all the versions of the novel for which we have any evidence, and must have been central to Lawrence's conception. The two sequences of k paper were numbered 309-315 and 317-318 at this stage. But when Lawrence re-used them in the Final manuscript he did so in reverse order, renumbering them 350-355 and 345-346. The first, at Stage IIIa, contained Paul's twenty-first-birthday letter to Miriam in which he had called her a nun, and his reply to her reply. It was his description of Miriam's reaction to the first letter that Jessie had corrected on page 311. The other, two-page, passage, which at this stage followed Paul's letters, was the latter part of a scene of partly dare-devil and partly passionate flirtation between "Beat" and Arthur Morel. Evidently Lawrence decided at Stage IV to make the virile portrait of Arthur in this scene (followed by some sketching of the changes at home after Annie's marriage and a description of the physical contrast between Clara playing at the farm and Miriam standing aloof) lead up to, and so set a pointedly contrasting tone before, Paul's precocious-juvenile, intellectual-spiritual letters to Miriam. With the second of them he then brought chapter IX of the Final manuscript to a close, as "the end of the first phase of Paul's love affair". 31 In the four pages of l paper that follow shortly (later transferred into chapter X of the Final manuscript) Paul invites Clara to apply for an overseer's job at Jordan's, and this leads straight into a section of pages taken from the Stage II draft, The Paul Morel Manuscript , in which the growing friendship between Paul and Clara (her name now changed from Mrs Frances Radford) is quickened by their walk to the Castle on his birthday and her subsequent gift. These had been pages 337-351 of Stage II and they were renumbered when transferred to Stage IIIa, pages 332-347. Thus our knowledge of Stage IIIa ends precisely where our knowledge of Stage II ended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The remains of Stage IIIb Only twenty-two pages first introduced into Stage IIIb now survive: pages 45, 46a-49a, 62, 68-69 on n paper which Lawrence used for his letters between 29 June and 18 July 1912, and pages 353-355, 358-362, 370-375 on m paper which he used for letters on 16, 17 and 21 May 1912. This was the period of Lawrence's sojourn in Germany. He was abroad for the first time in his life; his affair with Frieda had produced tumult with her husband and her family and turmoil within Lawrence himself. After a week abroad, he went to Waldbröl to stay with his Krenkow relatives, 32 who had issued the original invitation to him to visit Germany. He was in Waldbröl only from 11-24 May, and on 16 May he settled down to revise his novel. His letters from here on 14 and [15] May (nos. 443,444) are on a 26-lined paper which does not appear in the novel, but from [16] to 21 May (nos. 445, 446, 447) are all on m paper—otherwise he wrote postcards, and probably one letter to Jessie. She reported in her memoir that he wrote from Germany saying ( E.T. , 216): "I am going through Paul Morel . I'm sorry it turned out as it has. You'll have to go on forgiving me." On m paper he wrote fourteen new pages which he inserted into his draft and which survived into Stage IV as parts of chapter XI, "The Test on Miriam", some of them very little altered in Stage IV. It is impossible to tell whether these new pages contain quite new material or just extensive revision of Stage IIIa writing, but they are particularly interesting in that they convey some of the first of Lawrence's reflections on his relationship with Jessie under the impact of his very new relationship with Frieda. Pages 353-355, renumbered 397-399 in Stage IV, contain Paul's conversation with Miriam when he went back to her, about their "marrying", from "'I can't marry you,' he continued slowly" to "As she stood under the drooping thorn-tree." Pages 358-362, renumbered 402-406 in Stage IV, contain the cherry-picking sequence followed by the walk in the pinewood, from "There was a great crop of cherries. . ." to "Instinctively, they all left him alone." Pages 370-375, renumbered 414-417 and 419-420 in Stage IV, contain Paul's final breaking-off with Miriam, starting "'Well,' said his mother, 'I think it will be best,'" and ending "His mother looked at him." But this section was altered a great deal at Stage IV, with a whole page inserted (p. 418) towards the end of the bitter dialogue between Paul and Miriam, after "never fight you off" and before "He hacked at the earth till she was fretted to death." On 23 May he announced that he had "finished all but 10 pages" (no. 453); and the next day he left Waldbröl for Munich and his "honeymoon" with Frieda. From 1 June for two months they settled in Alfred Weber's apartment in Icking, near Munich, as Lawrence described to his Eastwood friend Mrs Hopkin on 2 June 1912 (no. 457): "Now Frieda and I are living alone in Professor Weber's flat. It is the top stor[e]y of this villa—quite small—four rooms beside kitchen. But there's a balcony, where we sit out, and have meals, and I write." It may have been here that Lawrence tinkered with chapter II of his novel; for he inserted revised pages in chapter II on n paper, an extremely transparent cheap paper, rather like grease-proof paper, which he also used for Once written between 2 and 29 June, and for his letters of 29 June and 3, 8 and 18 July. As this paper is not found outside these dates, and as Lawrence used different paper for revisions to the end of the novel, it is likely that he made these changes to the second chapter nearer those dates. Moreover, he talked on 2 June (no. 458) of sending 'Paul Morel' off to Heinemann, but did not send it till 9 June. On this paper he inserted five new pages between pages 44 and 46 of his previous draft (Fragment 3, pages 45, 46a-49a) in which he described Walter Morel cleaning up for his wife during the latter part of her pregnancy, and the gossip between the women and the traders in the alley of the Breach. He also tried but did not complete a two-page revision to the end of chapter II (see Fragment 4, pages 68-69—this explains the reduplicated numbers which perplexed Professor Schorer). The only n page that lasted into Stage IV was page 62 (renumbered 64 in the Final manuscript), a one-page replacement among his IIIa "Court Royal" pages, on which he described Morel throwing a drawer at his wife. As these different strata fall into place in the final morphology of the novel, it is not uncommon for material transferred from earlier stages to be found at the end of a chapter. This gives the impression that Lawrence knew the destination at which he intended each phase of his narrative to arrive but took time establishing the route. Yet where the different drafts can be compared intact, Lawrence can be observed copying out again almost verbatim whole episodes. For example, in the visit of Jerry to Walter Morel's sickbed and most of the ensuing twenty pages of overlap between Stages II and III, the revisions Lawrence introduced as he copied could have been entered on the original Stage II text without much disorder, and Lawrence could have transferred the pages, as he later did elsewhere. Thus it would be a mistake to suppose when Lawrence rewrote a passage afresh onto new paper that he was compelled to because of the quantity of revision, or that it was entirely new material. It may be that, particularly as he wrote Stage IV, his zeal for making fair copies flagged towards the end of a chapter. Nonetheless, it may be significant that chapter-ends often remained unchanged from Stage III to Stage IV, and that the surviving sequences of Stage III often had been or became chapter-ends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Edward Garnett's notes on Stage IIIb By contrast with the opening chapters, the latter part of the novel was not only not fixed early on, but expanded considerably in the final draft. Whether or not this was the effect of Garnett's detailed notes on the Stage IIIb version of the novel which Lawrence had before him as he wrote Stage IV, the resulting length of the Final manuscript was clearly not what Garnett had intended. It took Heinemann only three weeks to reject Lawrence's novel outright at the sight of the Stage IIIb manuscript, and send it back (on 1 July 1912). His editor, Walter de la Mare, wrote almost at once to Edward Garnett, editor for Duckworth, to explain the situation ( Letters I , 424 n. 1), with the result that Garnett asked Lawrence for the manuscript. Heinemann's main objections were that the work lacked "unity" and "reticence" ( Letters I , 421, n. 4). Despite his anger at the rejection, Lawrence apparently accepted the former point, for on 8 July he told Garnett, who had given him similar help with The Trespasser (no. 467): "I will make what alterations you think advisable. It would be rather nice if you made a few notes again. I will squash the first part together—it is too long." It took Edward Garnett only three weeks to accept Lawrence's novel in principle, and to return the manuscript to him by 22 July together with notes which Lawrence described as "awfully nice and detailed." (no. 472) These notes have not survived, but by chance some of Garnett's jottings toward them have, tucked away among Lawrence's letters to him in the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library where they and their significance have hitherto been overlooked. They are written in terrible scrawl—Garnett's handwriting is not the most legible at the best of times—on the back of a piece of paper 33 which Lawrence had evidently slipped in the parcel with the manuscript when he sent it to Garnett on 4 July, bearing in large clear letters his address in Germany. 34 This is one final piece of evidence about the composition of the novel which the identification of the remains of Stage III by paper analysis makes it possible to set in place. For three of the page numbers beside the sixteen brief notes on this piece of paper refer to surviving pages of Stage III. The first is: "331 'Fabian v. Socialistic'". This page became page 371 of chapter X, "Clara", in the Final manuscript, and Lawrence had written of Clara at Stage IIIa: "She had acquired a certain amount of education, under Fabian and Socialistic and Unitarian influence." In Stage IV he completely revised the middle part of this page, beginning with that sentence, and wrote instead: "During the ten years that she had belonged to the Women's movement, she had acquired a fair amount of education. . ." Lawrence's revision here confirms that although this scrap of jottings remained among Garnett's papers, he sent Lawrence notes based on them. Another jotting refers to page 341: "Talk is a little cheap." This page was one of an eleven-page sequence carried forward from Stage II and renumbered 337-347 in Stage III; page 341 was then renumbered 381 in Stage IV. It was part of the description of the walk Paul and Clara took to the Castle in Nottingham on Paul's birthday: their actual "talk" lasted from page 341 to 345 (renumbered 381-385 in Stage IV). On page 341 in Stage III they merely commented on how small the people in the streets below the Castle seemed from the Castle grounds, and Lawrence appears not to have found anything "cheap" to rewrite, for he had not altered this or the next few pages very much. However, he did revise the bottom half of page 342; but when Garnett eventually saw Lawrence's revisions, in the Final manuscript, in December 1912, he still found the passage unacceptable, and deleted all the conversation from half-way down page 342 to the end of page 343 (pages 382-383 in the Final manuscript), so that it was never printed. In these 35 lines, Paul turned the conversation round to talk about Clara's apparent self-loathing, and then about her husband Baxter's "naturalness". The other page that corresponds with Garnett's jottings, page 373 (renumbered 417 in Stage IV), contains the words "like a cynicism" which Garnett found " lurid " (indeed they are underlined with Garnett's wavy line in pencil in the manuscript). This page was one of the pieces of blue paper that Lawrence used in Waldbröl for writing Stage IIIb. In that May 1912 version he had written: ". . . It has always been you fighting me off." . . . She had finished—but she had done enough. Now at last, since she denied that their love had ever been love at all, he was severed from her. She had spoken the historical phrase to him, as he to her when he said: 'You are a nun.' He sat silent in bitterness. At last, the whole affair looked like a cynicism to him. He became intellectual and cruel. In response to Garnett's criticism, Lawrence heavily revised these two paragraphs, to the form they had in the first edition (except for the addition of two sentences on the proofs). And when the revisions are compared with this passage, it is noticeable that, although the context is expanded and explained, the actual phrase that Garnett objected to is only slightly recast: "At last, the whole affair appeared in a cynical aspect to him." It is a great pity that the notes Garnett sent and his letters to Lawrence, have not survived, for clearly his criticisms made a considerable contribution to Lawrence's development of his novel. And yet Lawrence seems often to have altered the wording to meet the criticisms, but in such a way as to reinforce his underlying intentions, even though these may have been at the root of the objection. But in some instances—as with the second of the criticisms for which full evidence survives—Garnett was able to have the last word, when he prepared the Final manuscript for the printers and pruned a tenth of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The survival of the manuscripts Finally, why have certain portions of Stages II and III survived—in particular, the Fragments and the section of chapter IX—and no more? At the fourth and final stage, Lawrence wrote 437 pages out afresh onto new paper: is it plausible that he kept the first 58 pages that he had rejected from the old draft, and the twenty-three pages of chapter IX, and no others? The survival of Stage II seems to have happened as follows: The opening 71 pages of Stage II are lost probably because, having rewritten them before falling ill in Croydon in November 1911, Lawrence left them there or threw them away at his departure. The rest of Stage II survives because he rewrote it in Eastwood and left it with his sister Ada when he went abroad. It lacked its end because he had transferred the latter pages into his third draft: and this is why he called it "the first part of Paul Morel" when he wrote home to Ada from Waldbröl on 23 May explaining for the benefit of his elder sister Emily what it was (no. 453): "Thank Emily for her letter—tell her the first part of Paul Morel is the first writing—I did it again, and have the whole here. . ." The survival of a section of chapter IX must be related to the survival of the 'Miriam Papers'. For Lawrence had probably already rewritten chapter IX before leaving England, during the period 1-11 April when he tidied up his Stage IIIa manuscript after recovering it from Jessie Chambers with her comments written on it, and on some accompanying sheets. Then, when he took the Stage IIIa manuscript abroad with him in May 1912, he probably also took the 'Miriam Papers' so that he could refer to them as he produced the Stage IIIb revision. He must have kept those discarded pages of chapter IX for the same reason, so that he could consult the comments Jessie had written on them. Even so, how did the 'Miriam Papers' survive after Lawrence had finished with them? Unfortunately, Harry T. Moore, who must have seen them in private hands in or before 1964, was no more specific about their provenance than to say, referring to the section of chapter IX: ". . .it is probably a variant, for Lawrence doubtless rewrote this chapter and placed the revised version in the complete manuscript of Paul Morel B , retaining the part under discussion and putting it away with the other Miriam Papers, among which they [ sic ] were found after his death" (Moore 375-376; Tedlock 52). Mr. Theodore S. Bober, at the Sotheby-Parke Bernet sale of whose manuscripts in November 1980 H.R.C. bought the section of chapter IX, acquired it himself (via a Chicago dealer) from the collection of a Mr Wells, who had purchased many manuscripts direct from Frieda Lawrence. Lawrence, then, had preserved the 'Miriam Papers' for use when writing Stage IIIb, and they were still among his papers when he died. It is possible that there were yet others, but only six items, which Frieda sold to collectors after Lawrence's death, have subsequently come to light. But why did he preserve the first 58 pages of Stage IIIb that he rejected as he rewrote the novel, and no others? Between finishing Stage IIIb in Icking near Munich and writing the fourth and final draft, Lawrence travelled with Frieda, largely on foot, from Icking to Lake Garda in northern Italy. As Frieda described in her memoir: 35 "We packed up our few possessions, three trunks went ahead of us to the Lago di Garda. We set off on foot, with a rucksack each. . ." The trunks went by train to Riva, at the northern end of the lake, 36 and Lawrence and Frieda, having started their trek on 5 August 1912, arrived in Riva on 5 September. On 7 September, Lawrence wrote to Garnett from Riva (no. 495): "I am glad to be settling down, to get at that novel. I am rather keen on it. I shall re-cast the first part altogether." What exactly had he unpacked from his trunk in Riva? Back in Icking on Monday 22 July, when Lawrence received from Garnett his Stage IIIb manuscript, he wrote (no. 472): "I got Paul Morel this morning, and the list of notes from Duckworth. The latter are awfully nice and detailed. What a Trojan of energy and conscientiousness you are! I'm going to slave like a Turk at the novel—see if I won't do you credit. I begin in earnest tomorrow—having spent the day in thought (?)". This was two weeks before he and Frieda set off on their trek on Monday 5 August. It is probable that Lawrence did start revising his novel in those two weeks, both because of the strong desire to do so expressed in this letter, and the decision already expressed in his letter of 8 July to Garnett to "squash the first part together". I therefore propose the following hypothesis: first he read through the opening chapters and began by deleting a number of lines (see Fragment 2, pages 32-33; Fragment 5, pages 81-82, Fragment 6, pages 84-85); then he decided to rewrite some pages onto new paper, using quires of P and Q paper. He rewrote pages 1-8 on the first ten-leaf quire of P , and then he accepted pages 9-25 of Stage III and slipped them into the quire between the eighth and ninth leaves; then he carried on copying with modifications Stage III pages 26-37 onto pages 26-34 of P paper, so that when he decided to incorporate some more of Stage III pages, he had to renumber them downwards. He proceded in this fashion, revising and incorporating; and the last page of Stage III paper he drew into the new draft was page 67, renumbered 69 in the Final manuscript. I propose that he had reached Stage III page 85, the last of the Fragments, when he set off for Italy. On this page, Mrs Morel demands of the three-year-old Paul: "What are you crying for?" This scene was copied with modifications onto page 76 of the Final manuscript—and at the end of it there is a discernible change of handwriting. 37 Lawrence apparently wrote no letter to Garnett after that of 22 July, until 4 August, the day before he left Icking, when he said (no. 476): "I am going to write Paul Morel over again—it'll take me 3 months." I suggest that this was the conclusion he had come to as a result of the labours I have described. The hypothesis is simply that he left the discarded pages (that is, the Fragments) behind—perhaps in a trunk of other possessions, probably with Frieda's sister, Else, who lived at Wolfratshausen near Icking, and whose address Lawrence still used as a forwarding address after he had left for Italy. 38 Then, in Riva, he unpacked: pages 86 to the end of Stage III together with pages 1-76 of the Final manuscript and a few blank quires of P paper. Frieda's footnote to the letter that he wrote immediately to Garnett (quoted above) suggests he may have done more reading and discussing than rewriting at first (no. 495): "I think L. quite missed the point in 'Paul Morel' . . .—he is writing P.M. again, reads bits to me and we fight like blazes over it." At any rate, he did not write any letters on P paper until 17 September, the day before they left Riva to settle for six and a half months in Gargnano, on the lakeside further south. No Q paper appears in the letters after this date: and in the Final manuscript Q paper was used for pages 52-60 and 70, that is, during the Stage IV writing that I suggest Lawrence did in Icking. Thus the available evidence neither proves nor disproves my hypothesis—nor does it suggest a better one. The alternative that suggests itself is that many more pages of manuscript survived, but have not yet come to light. 39 Table 1: The Paper Paper A Measurements : height 209.5, width 177, thickness .011.

In reply to my query the Rare Books Librarian confirms that the paper does not correspond with any known Sons and Lovers paper. 8 Letters I (no. 274) written to Martin Secker on 12 June 1912, which we were also unable to go and see. In reply to my query the Curator of Manuscripts confirms that it is most similar to Paper B. 9 These are modifications of the tests and descriptions suggested in P. Gaskell, New Introduction to Bibliography (1972). 226-227, 334. 10 Within this variety certain sequences of watermarked papers occur intermittently, and sometimes their dates overlap; I list here those found during Lawrence's sojourn abroad in the Sons and Lovers period, because although they do not occur in the Sons and Lovers manuscripts, we did find some of them in other manuscripts and this exemplifies the applicability of the paper research beyond the present enquiry: "Friedenau", Frieda's letter-paper used very intermittently by Lawrence (21 May-22 July 1912); "Fortuna Mill Damasce" (13 August-5 September 1912); "Extra Strong Lessiles Mill" (19 November 1912-[?22] March 1913); "Old Mora Mill" used very intermittently (12 January-29 May 1913), a paper also used for New Eve and Old Adam , pages 1-3 and Honour and Arms (i.e. The Prussian Officer ) page 10. Both of these manuscripts also contain a paper with continental style rectangular lines, which occurs in one letter: 575, of 13 May 1913 ( New Eve pp. 4-14 and Honour and Arms pp. 11-17). The New Eve ms. is at the McFarlin Library, University of Tulsa. 11 In addition to the changes in page-numbering made by Lawrence in ink when he transferred pages, other changes were made in pencil by Garnett or the printers because of Lawrence's errors in numbering. In the latter case Lawrence's ink numbers are used in this article. 12 Discussed below in section entitled Stage IIIa: the start , 8. 13 See Lawrence's letter to Louie of 1 June 1911 (no. 273): "I'm glad you like Paul, but doubt whether you tell me 'the truth, the whole truth. . .'" 14 Page 89 "behind" changed to "at" and p. 208 "about" changed to "at" may both have been by Lawrence (cf. his large deliberately formed correction "it" on page 232). Two slips were corrected by others: p. 199 the omission of "be" and p. 173 "The," in error for "Then,". 15 Roy Spencer, D. H. Lawrence Country (1979) 29; and the Eastwood and Kimberley Advertiser 18 March 1900. 16 Radford is Clara's mother's name in Sons and Lovers ; Lawrence's choice of Dawes may have had something to do with a strange running pun in the novel centring on the lugubrious temperaments of Clara and Baxter Dawes, from Paul's nickname (in chapter IX) for Clara: "Mrs the raven that quothed 'Nevermore'." to the nurse's nickname (in chapter XIV) for Baxter: "Jim Crow". 17 Jessie knew nothing of Stage I. 18 Emile Delavenay, D. H. Lawrence: L'Homme et la Genèse de son Œuvre , 2 volumes, Paris, 1969 (hereafter Delavenay). This quotation is given with 'young' omitted, p. 673. 19 'Miriam Papers' section of chapter IX, p. 208 (Lawrence himself deleted Only and 's soul. ) and p. 215. 20 Cf. Final ms. p. 233 "[Mrs Morel] could feel Paul being drawn away by this girl. And she did not care for Miriam. 'She is one of those who will want to suck a man's soul out till he has none of his own left,' she said to herself, 'and he is just such a gaby as to let himself be absorbed. She will never let him become a man. . .'" and Final ms. p. 279 "[Miriam] despised him, for being blown about by any wind of authority." First English edition pp. 161, 196. There is another passage similar to the first of these on Final ms. pp. 275-276; English ed. 194. 21 Jessie gave other quotations in E.T. , particularly from Lawrence's letters which she claimed to have destroyed, and in many cases her memoir is now the sole source. The fact that here where her quotations can be checked they are found very approximate is disturbing. However, readers of her memoir are probably acutely aware that it was not written as a work of scholarship but as an attempt to put the interpretative record straight in a matter that was still too painfully close to the author for certain kinds of objectivity to be a main concern. 22 It was also more likely to have been Jessie than Louie who crossed out in pencil the phrase 'sinister as fate' (p. 216), since she was more inclined to stylistic criticisms; and more likely she who queried in pencil an uncorrected use of the name Muriel for Miriam (p. 278), for Louie would have corrected it—if she read that far. 23 As he did, for example, when making page 309 of Stage III into page 350 of the Final manuscript: he deleted the sentence "Must I write you a birthday letter?" and what follows, because he now wrote them on page 349 of the new draft (Lawrence deleted in straight lines, Garnett in diagonal or wavy lines). 24 This is interesting in view of the fact that Jessie Chambers believed the figure of Clara in the novel to be a composite of Mrs Dax, Louie Burrows and Helen Corke, see Delavenay 671. 25 G. H. Neville, A Memoir of D. H. Lawrence , ed. Carl Baron (1981), (hereafter Neville) 155-156 and 206 n.26. 26 There are several complicating factors to this discrepancy. One: Neville asserted in his memoir (Neville 44 and Appendix 167-171) that while Lawrence was staying with him in Bradnop he was bringing The Rainbow to completion; this has not been accepted by Lawrenceans, but if Lawrence had 'finished' his latest draft of 'Paul Morel' and left it all behind in Jessie's hands, what was he writing in the daytime while Neville was teaching, and what was the bedroom scene Neville warned him against? Two: Lawrence wrote one letter (no. 407) from Bradnop on a 26-lined paper similar to l , on which he wrote (at least) pages 328-331 of Stage IIIa, the last surviving pages of that version. These pages of the novel concern Clara's return to Jordan's factory, and are not near the end of the novel. Surely Lawrence was not still writing the end of 'Paul Morel' in Bradnop? This would cast severe doubt on Jessie's memoir: for she gave a brief description of the outcome of the plot that indicates that she had read the narrative beyond this point: ". . . at the end Paul Morel calmly hands [Clara] back to her husband, and remains suspended over the abyss of his despair" ( E.T. , 202). Perhaps Lawrence was writing material for later insertion into his manuscript. Three: E.T. has been found inaccurate in details, and one solution of the discrepancy here would be to doubt it again in favour of the literal truth of Lawrence's letters. But, on the one hand, if Lawrence had only sent Jessie, say, three-quarters of the novel, she must have known she had not read to the end—and the outcome of the plot must have been a burning issue to her at that time. On the other hand, what did Lawrence mean by "finished": "written only" or "written, read through and tidied up"? His letters indicate he had written "two thirds or more" after 1-3 weeks' work (6 March); if he had not written the last third until 11 April, it took him a disproportionate 5 weeks. 27 An article in which I attempt to explain the relationship of all the 'Miriam Papers' to the novel is due to appear in Archiv (Bonn) in 1985. 28 See my article "Mrs Morel Ironing", The Journal of the D. H. Lawrence Society , Eastwood, Nottingham, U.K. 1984, where the two surviving manuscript versions of this scene are reproduced and discussed. 29 Fragment 2, pp. 32-33. It was at the start of Stage IV, I believe, that Lawrence rewrote this passage after "living" thus: "Therefore she nourished the souls of her unborn children on her own dissatisfactions. Her passionate yearning entered into her infants, poisoning, as it were, their naive young spirits. . ." He then deleted the bottom seventeen lines of p. 32, as I describe in the last section of this article. In this chapter, it is noteworthy, too, that the description of Walter Morel which J. C. F. Littlewood praised saying "it must have been inserted at a late stage of revision" (in his valuable pamphlet, D. H. Lawrence I, 1885-1914 in the Writers and Their Works series, 1976, 36), belongs in fact to this spring 1912 Stage IIIa writing and was incorporated into the Final manuscript as page 13: ". . . the dusky, golden softness of his sensuous flame of life, that flowed from off his flesh like the flame from a candle. . ." (These were thoughts Lawrence elevated to a 'religion' in January 1913; see Letters I no. 539.) 30 See Lawrence's references to William in the letter of 19 November 1912 to Garnett (no. 516) in which he gives a synopsis of the 'idea' the novel 'follows'. 31 Because these pages are on k paper, and Lawrence may have begun using k paper in Shirebrook, that may explain why Lawrence began posting this part of the novel to Jessie. 32 Dieter Mehl gives new information about Lawrence's German relatives, in "D. H. Lawrence in Waldbröl," Notes and Queries , Vol. 31, No. 1. 78-81. 33 The paper is the same type as one which Lawrence wrote to David Garnett on, 23 July 1912 (no. 473). 34 He used Frieda's sister's address, see Letters I , 415 n.1. 35 Frieda Lawrence, " Not I, But the Wind . . ." (1935, 1964, 1973), 44. 36 Ibid. , 50: "[From Trento] We took the train to Riva on the Lago di Garda. . . Then we got our trunks." See Edward Nehls, D. H. Lawrence: A Composite Biography , Madison 1959, Vol. I, 178: David Garnett: "Lawrence and Frieda sent off all their worldly possessions in two suitcases by train to Italy." I argue that they left some possessions behind. 37 There are discernible changes of handwriting throughout these mss., indicating that Lawrence wrote them with breaks. He clearly had a remarkable capacity to write while on the move and while living in strange temporary accommodation. I cite the change in handwriting here not as something extraordinary but because it supports the possibility that my hypothesis is valid. 38 See Letters I (no. 478). Lawrence certainly left some manuscripts in Bavaria in 1913, but that later occasion would not explain this particular survival. 39 This article is published with the kind permission of the Cambridge University Press, Laurence Pollinger Limited and the Estate of Mrs Frieda Lawrence Ravagli; and with the kind permission of Mrs Ann Howard (Jessie Chambers Mss). 40 Love Poems ms. : Lawrence had been preparing poems for a book since October 1911 but Love Poems and Others was not published until February 1913. The ms. paper is very mixed, and since the poems include "Bei Hennef", Lawrence must have kept the poems together with more of the same blank paper, and taken the collection abroad with him.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Lost Passage from Hemingway's 'Macomber' by Leger Brosnahan</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A comparison of the first printing of Ernest Hemingway's 'The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber' in Cosmopolitan (September 1936) with the second, and since standard, printing of the story in The Fifth Column and the First Forty-nine Stories (New York: Scribner's, 1938) shows that the greatest single difference between these two clearly independent forms of the story is the suppression in the Scribner's 1938 and later printings of a passage of about 100 words near the climax of the lion hunt ( Cosmopolitan 168, FCFFS 116, later printings 17). The ribbon typescript used as setting copy for the Cosmopolitan printing is now in the Morris Library at Southern Illinois University and was described by John M. Howell and Charles A. Lawler in 'From Abercrombie and Fitch to the First Forty-Nine Stories: The Text of Ernest Hemingway's 'Francis Macomber' ( Proof 2 [1972]: 212-281). They predicted that the carbon copy, then inaccessible to them but listed among the Hemingway papers and used as setting copy for the Scribner's printing, would be found to be the carbon of the Cosmopolitan ribbon copy, that it would make few substantive changes in the text, and that it would probably prove that the deleted passage of about 100 words should be restored to the text (233). The carbon is now accessible in the Hemingway collection at the Kennedy Library and confirms all of these predictions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Howell and Lawler argued correctly that the carbon copy was from the ribbon copy because the thirty-ninth page of the ribbon copy was misnumbered 33, whereas the account of the carbon by Phillip Young and Charles W. Mann, in The Hemingway Manuscripts: An Inventory (1969), described it (7i) as paginated (1) 2-33 but repaginated 634-672 for the 1938 Scribner's collection, indicating a thirty-nine-page typescript. The carbon copy is clearly the carbon of the ribbon copy and shows that the page number of page 39 was typed 3 39, with the first 3 two spaces left of the left page margin. The 3 39 was then miscorrected on the ribbon copy by the erasure of the 9 instead of the first 3.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Comparison of the ribbon copy with the carbon copy also shows that Hemingway corrected the ribbon copy for Cosmopolitan very carefully and in great detail but corrected the carbon copy for the collection independently and much less carefully and left standing in the carbon copy errors that he had corrected in the ribbon copy, e.g. 'Won't shoot unless it's close enough so you can make sure' (167, 11, 12) and 'Macomber had not thought how the lion felt as he got out of the car' (168, 114, 15). Substantive changes of the text in the carbon copy were limited to changing 'A good fifty inches, too' (172) to 'A good fifty inches or better. Better' (135, 36) and deleting the 100-word passage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Comparison of the ribbon and carbon copies with their respective printings shows that the editors at Cosmopolitan took a number of small, relatively unimportant liberties with the corrected ribbon copy, but that the Scribner's copy editor was, with one great exception, even excessively respectful of the corrected carbon copy, the exception being the large deleted passage. Comparison of the ribbon and carbon copies shows clearly what happened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Hemingway finished typing the passage in question, on the lower half of page 16 of the typescripts, he rolled the copies down to type the interlined addition 'that ran away behind the river bank trees' near the middle of the page. In rolling the copies down, or in removing them from the machine, he wrinkled the carbon, which smudged and made a number of carbon marks that resemble pencil marks over the passage immediately below the typed interlined addition. He separated the copies before correcting the ribbon copy for Cosmopolitan , but while the carbon was still above the carbon copy, he apparently accidentally rolled a wooden pencil with a metal eraser-holder over the carbon and carbon copy under a heavy book, probably a dictionary. This added six wavy parallel lines from margin to margin across the already smudged and carbon-marked passage. These combined accidental carbon markings convinced the Scribner's copy editor that Hemingway intended to cancel the passage. The editor then made the cancellation perfectly clear with a ruled red pencil line through the line below the typed interlined addition and three vertical red pencil arrows descending from it to the end of the passage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But examination of this cancelled passage shows clearly that Hemingway corrected it, less extensively than in the ribbon copy but virtually from end to end, marking gun bearers for closure in the first line of the cancelled passage and correcting an over-typed o-u in poch with a handwritten pouch in the last. More important still, he inserted in his distinctive and easily recognized hand a full, never printed sentence, 'There's the dark and the light blood (x)' just after 'You gut-shot him and you hit him forward.' Without arguing the larger question of which of the independent forms of the story and of this passage have the better claim to be definitive, it is clear that the 100-word passage, with its never printed additional sentence, should be restored to the form of the Scribner's, and since standard, printing of the story.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Textual History of William Faulkner's The Wishing-Tree and The Wishing Tree by Louis Daniel Brodsky</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The publication history of Willam Faulkner's The Wishing Tree is byzantine and highly curious. To be precise, it spans two months more than four decades from the date of its very private, officially recorded "publication" as a personally-typed, hand-bound, single copy Faulkner gave as a birthday gift on February 5, 1927, 1 to its initial magazine appearance as a short story, "The Wishing Tree," in the April 8, 1967 number of Saturday Evening Post vol. 240, pp. 48 ff., followed three days later by the Random House first printing as a self-contained novella, replete with elaborate illustrations commissioned for the simultaneously-issued trade and specially-bound and slip-cased, numbered edition entitled The Wishing Tree . 2 According to definitions adopted and promulgated by the United States Copyright Office, 3 it was Faulkner himself who fixed the official dates of creation, and, by implication, publication of The Wishing Tree when he typed the phrase, "single mss. impression / oxford-mississippi-/5-february-i927", at the foot of the verso of the title page, then bound and presented his gift booklet to Lida Estelle Franklin's daughter, Victoria de Graffenried, presumably on that same day. Officially, this date satisfies the terms of the Copyright Office's statute which asserts that "a work is 'created' when it is fixed in a copy . . . for the first time." Understood is the fact that the text itself could not have sprung spontaneously and completely intact on February 5, 1927; rather, that its gestation and the revisionary process leading up to the typing and binding of this "single mss. impression," had seemingly culminated on that date. Accepting the Copyright Office's statutory definition of "publication" as that date on which the first "distribution of . . . a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership . . ." is made, it would appear that February 5, 1927, also should be considered the "official" recorded date for The Wishing Tree . On the title page, below the title, THE WISHING TREE, Faulkner added the following first of two dedications: "For his dear friend / Victoria / on her eighth birthday / Bill he made / this Book". Victoria Franklin, who, with the marriage of her mother to William Faulkner on June 20, 1929, would become the author's step-daughter, had been born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on February 5, 1919. Implied in his dedication is the fact that Faulkner had made the book for the occasion of the little girl's birthday, not that he had actually "made" it on that day. Two additional assumptions as well may be extrapolated from Faulkner's wording: first, that on the actual day of the birthday, February 5, 1927, Faulkner would have physically given Victoria the book; and secondly, that in giving her the book, he would have fulfilled the dedication's promise to cause a transfer of ownership to be accomplished. Ironically, six days later at the outside, possibly even before February 5, 1927, Faulkner would either repeat the magnanimous gesture he had made to Victoria Franklin, or make the first of what would become two such similar deeds, by personally delivering to the house of Dr. and Mrs. Calvin S. Brown, of Oxford, Mississippi, a differently typed copy of a story he had titled The Wishing-Tree . 4 Although it is impossible to date with absolute precision the exact day on which Faulkner brought to the Brown house his gift for daughter Margaret, we do know from the entry Dr. Brown made in his diary for February 11, 1927, that he "Read a story by William Faulkner called The Wishing-Tree which he brought over to Margaret." 5 Unfortunately, the usually fastidious diarist failed to record the actual day on which Faulkner dropped off the manuscript; Dr. Brown could have been coming to the task of reading the story days after, rather than on that very day the gift arrived. Nonetheless, the fact remains that Faulkner did present Margaret Brown, who was dying of an irreversible disease, with a gift of friendship and consolation, a newly-written fairy tale entitled The Wishing-Tree (note the hyphen), which he suggested he had composed especially for her. In the upper left portion of page "1," Faulkner had inscribed in ink what amounted to a dedication: "To Margaret Brown / from her friend, / Bill Faulkner." Unquestionably, Faulkner's two separate gifts, The Wishing Tree and The Wishing-Tree , would go unremarked for thirty years; so too would the awareness, or even the slightest suspicion by any single party, other than Faulkner himself, that more than one copy of The Wishing Tree existed. Both recipients, and, later, Margaret Brown's surviving family members, would continue to believe that the copy each possessed not only had been written exclusively for her by William Faulkner, but that it was uniquely hers to do with as she might see fit. A first printing of Intruder in the Dust 6 which Faulkner inscribed for Mrs. Maud Morrow Brown, Margaret Brown's mother, dated December 10, 1948, may document the day on which the author came to the Brown house in Oxford to borrow the typescript of The Wishing-Tree which in 1927 he had originally given to the now long-deceased Margaret. The inscribed copy of the recently published book may have been a token of politeness for a favor he anticipated rightly Mrs. Brown would grant him. Doubtless, Faulkner's reason for his request was neither exacted by Mrs. Brown, nor was it proffered by the borrower. In fact, Faulkner's purpose for taking the typescript home was to type from it two copies, ribbon and carbon, which he could give as Christmas gifts to the children of two intimate friends: Phil Stone and Ruth Ford. Presumably, when he finished his retyping chore, Faulkner delivered to the Stone residence the recently typed 44-page, bound ribbon copy he had made from the 47-page "Brown" carbon copy. On page "1," in the upper left hand corner, Faulkner had inscribed in ink: "For Philip Stone II, / from his god-father. / William Faulkner / Oxford. / Xmas 1948". 7 The corresponding unbound, carbon copy was mailed to its recipient. Its ink inscription read: "For Shelley Ford. / Xmas, 1948 / William Faulkner." 8 Except for the conscious omission of the verse epigram that accompanied in slightly altered form 9 the copies Faulkner had made in 1927 for Victoria Franklin and for Margaret Brown, these two new copies resembled the original "Brown" text he had recently borrowed from Maud Morrow Brown. In fact, except for accidentals variants caused by typographical errors and not a half dozen minor alterations in diction, and with only one obviously mistaken transposition of two lines of dialogue with its concomitant misattribution of speaker in one of the two lines, the text of the Philip Stone and Shelley Ford copies remained true to the Margaret Brown copy. Coincidentally, the previously mentioned copy of Intruder in the Dust may also contain information which documents the occasion on which Faulkner returned the borrowed typescript to Mrs. Brown. The first free front end-paper of the book not only contains the presentation inscription which Faulkner made "For Mrs. Calvin Brown / Bill Faulkner" with its accompanying provenance appearing on the title page, "William Faulkner / Oxford Miss / 10 Dec 1948", but bears beneath his first inscription, a second one to Mrs. Brown's visiting daughter, Faulkner's childhood friend, Edith Brown Douds: "For Edith / Xmas 1948 / Bill Faulkner." Quite possibly, on his appearance with the typescript, Mrs. Douds, a collector in her own right, could have requested of Faulkner his signature on the book he had left with her mother a few weeks earlier. Neither Phil Stone nor Ruth Ford imagined that their child had received a Christmas gift from William Faulkner that was anything other than totally unique; certainly, they never questioned its originality. In fact, it was not until Maud Brown saw a copy of the Princeton University catalogue 10 high-lighting a copy of The Wishing-Tree among the entries on display for the vast Faulkner exhibition running from May 10 through August 30, 1957, that she even surmised what Faulkner's intention had been for borrowing her copy of The Wishing-Tree that Christmas of 1948. The exhibited copy was the one Faulkner had given to Philip Stone, and had been reluctantly loaned for the occasion by Phil Stone. On July 16, 1958, expressing consternation and hurt over having become aware of the existence of a "second" copy of her daughter's story, Mrs. Brown wrote a letter to Faulkner, imploring him to grant her permission to publish the story: Dear Billy, You told me, I know, that The Wishing Tree was mine to do with as I pleased. Through all these years I've cherished it as something personal because Margaret loved it so much. The manuscript is yellow and dogeared from her handling of it. I have never before considered publishing it but now I believe it should be published. Since a copy was on exhibit at Princeton it has become an object of public curiosity. 11 After numerous unsuccessful attempts on Mrs. Brown's behalf by Professor James W. Silver to interest Life , then Random House, in publishing The Wishing-Tree , Faulkner himself finally learned of the escalating attempts and with provocation wrote to his publisher, Bennett Cerf, instructing him emphatically not to proceed: Dear Bennett: This story was written as a gesture of pity and compassion for Mrs. Brown's little girl who was dying of cancer. I would be shocked if Mrs. Brown herself wanted to commercialize it. But it belongs to her. I will not forbid her to sell it, but I myself would never authorize it being published, unless perhaps, the proceeds should go to save other children from cancer. 12 It is apparent that even at this late date Faulkner maintained his stance in having made for and given to Margaret Brown The Wishing-Tree : his gift had been given outright; it belonged to her, except for its copyright. Possibly at this juncture, Faulkner may have realized the potential embarrassment that could arise from publication of this story, especially were it to be discovered by his step-daughter, for whom, surely, he might have uneasily recalled, he also had made the story thirty-two years earlier. During the Fifties, Professor James W. Silver had become friends with William Faulkner; much earlier, he had nurtured an intimate friendship with Faulkner's two step-children, Malcolm and Victoria. As coincidence would have it, Silver, who had already become quite familiar with the Brown typescript of The Wishing-Tree , was shocked to discover yet another copy of the story. In a letter to John Cook Wyllie, dated September 1, 1961, Silver described this and other relevant revelations: For a long number of years I assumed that Mrs. Maude Morrow Brown (who has known "Billy" since the moment he was born) had the original copy. She had an afflicted daughter who died a couple of years after Faulkner brought to her the story ... Faulkner borrowed it from "Miss Maude" in 1949 [ sic ] and made another copy for Phil Stone's son... Anyway, in May of this year, I was talking one night with Faulkner's stepdaughter, Victoria Franklin Fielden, who accidentally remarked that she had a copy of a short story written for her by Faulkner when he was courting her mother. This was the "Wishing Tree" and was apparently given to Mrs. Fielden on her ninth [ sic ] birthday, in 1927 ... Mrs. Fielden was shocked to discover that there was another copy in existence, and I think a bit hurt, for she had treasured this story as being hers alone. Of course, Mrs. Brown has felt about the same way, particularly after the death of Margaret and after Faulkner had told her that she could do with it as she pleased. 13 Neither Professor Silver, nor Victoria Fielden, dared mention this seemingly blatant disparity to Faulkner, who died fourteen months later. Yet, in 1964, Mrs. Fielden, fearing either Mrs. Brown or Phil Stone might press the issue of publication, thereby jeopardizing, possibly squandering her own proprietary rights to "her" story, and without any opposition from her stepsister, Jill Faulkner Summers, Faulkner's literary executrix, filed for and obtained complete copyright authority to the story, The Wishing Tree . Three years later, Random House published what soon became apparent was not merely just another copy of the story, but a distinct version of The Wishing Tree : The "Victoria" version.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II During the Twenties, when Faulkner was developing and refining his writing techniques, style, and his literary aesthetic, and throughout his full maturation as an uncompromisingly original artist in the Thirties, it was his habit first to compose his prose in longhand, almost always printing with fountain pen, in lettering so minute as to be illegible to almost all but himself. Generally, it would require three pages of typescript to incorporate one page of handwritten manuscript. Then, Faulkner would transcribe his first draft to a typescript, which almost unfailingly he would subject to rigorous revision, some being done on the typewriter, some in holograph outside the margins as well as interlineally. Finally, he would retype that draft into a clean, presentable typescript. Unfortunately for The Wishing Tree , neither an original holograph manuscript of presumably fifteen or sixteen pages, nor any of what surely could have been at least two early, successively-revised typescript drafts antecedent to the 47-page typescript which Faulkner gave to Margaret Brown in 1927, have survived. Yet, we must not discount the probability of this hypothetical sequence of composition: the 47-page "Brown" carbon typescript, with its companion second manifold carbon and ribbon copies which Faulkner kept, 14 is far too polished and complete to have come into existence without precursory drafts. In fact, Faulkner had interpolated into the "Brown" typescript only one brief piece of dialogue on page "13" ("What is it?" Daphne asked), which, from context, is obviously a forgotten retort necessary to the flow, not a newly-conceived rejoinder. And, although Faulkner's holographic ink corrections, consisting of sporadic and seemingly arbitrary additions of apostrophes and quotation marks, as well as numerous typographical corrections, evidence a rereading of the typescript, they appear far from comprehensive in their proofing. In no way do they contribute to the inclusion of any new substantive matter. Furthermore, there is little doubt that either the ribbon copy of the "Brown" typescript or the first of the two carbon copies (the corrected one given to Margaret Brown) served as the one from which at least two additional copies were retyped: matching ribbon and carbon texts which managed to economize forty-seven pages into forty-three pages, 15 while retaining the exact text of the "Brown" copy, as well as incorporating virtually all of Faulkner's holographic emendations and his single addition of dialogue on page "13." That both ribbon and carbon copies of this 43-page retype remained together in Faulkner's personal possession until their final disposition as part of the materials placed on permanent deposit at the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia, can most likely be explained by the apparent carelessness in retyping them. Page "10" of the carbon copy is missing; however, page "10" of the ribbon copy, although extant within the proper sequence of pages, is marred to the extent of carrying on its verso a duplicate of its recto text: this obviously happened when the typist placed the carbon paper ink-side up, rather than face-down between the two sheets to be typed. In addition, page "25" is completely missing from both the ribbon and carbon copies of this 43-page typescript. The text lacking from this missing page corresponds to the text on page "27" of the "Brown" copy. It appears that in completing "Brown" page "26," the typist repeated the page number ("Brown" "26") at the foot of what sequentially should have been page "24" of the retype in progress; then, for whatever reason, he or she skipped completely "Brown" page "27," and began again with "Brown" page "28." The page, intact and identical, became page "26" of the 43-page retype. Then, the typist went back and in ink changed the first mistaken number ("26") to page "24." But, page "25" of the retype, which should have corresponded exactly in text to "Brown" page "27," never got retyped and inserted into the 43-page sequence. Finally, although the pagination runs consecutively from page "26-43," there is the equivalent of a complete page of the "Brown" manuscript (page "44") omitted between pages "40-41." Although there is little doubt that the 47-page ribbon and its two carbon copies of the "Brown" text followed a preexisting, non-extant typescript, or that the 43-page ribbon and carbon copies were typed from one of the 47-page copies, there is uncertainty as to whom the typist might have been for either or both these sets of typescripts. In Faulkner: A Biography (1974), Joseph Blotner (pp. 431-432) documents the fact that during the period Faulkner was writing Soldiers' Pay and Mosquitoes , both composed and published within the same time-frame (1925-1927), Faulkner would customarily submit his work to others for typing and proof-reading. Mostly, these assistants were secretaries in Phil Stone's law office. There is more than a suggestion that at least the 47-page copies and most likely the 43-page copies may have been handled in this manner. The three 47-page "Brown" typescripts repeat "William Faulkner," followed by "The Wishing-Tree," across the top of each sheet; neither was this one of Faulkner's typing characteristics, nor does this format appear on any of the manuscripts whose typing can be clearly attributed to Faulkner himself from around this same period. Rather, this seems more to be in the nature of a convention congenial to the legal profession. Additionally, it was not Faulkner's habit to make three copies of any of his typescripts; conversely, this was a common legal procedure. Furthermore, with hindsight to inform us of Faulkner's easy access to his friend's, Stone's, good will in terms of providing professional services in those early years of Faulkner's writing career, it seems most likely that Faulkner could have submitted at least one, possibly both tedious and perfunctory jobs to Stone's modest "typing pool" for processing. And, if this were the case, it might plausibly allow for the following explanation as to how the version of The Wishing Tree Faulkner gave to Victoria Franklin at about the same time in February, 1927, could have developed. First, let us assume that Faulkner had conceived the story, The Wishing-Tree , as a tribute to Margaret Brown, as he himself stated at the time he presented it to her, and reiterated in his letter to Bennett Cerf in November, 1959. Possibly, with completion of the clean 47-page typescript, the carbon of which he intended to and subsequently did give to Margaret Brown, Faulkner also realized that he might have another suitable occasion and recipient for his story. Acknowledging the fact that he would need to retain a complete copy for his files, the ribbon copy (apparently the second carbon copy was incomplete from the outset), Faulkner yet may have relinquished it to Phil Stone for retyping, with the notion of using one of the two newly-retyped copies to give to Victoria Franklin whose birthday was fast-approaching. Possibly, while what became the 43-page copies were being retyped, or even after both new copies were returned to him in a manner made seemingly unpresentable because of their problems with pages "10," "25," and "40-41," Faulkner thought better of his earlier notion of presenting both children with virtually identical gifts. Acting on this "ethical" consideration, Faulkner indeed may have returned to the typescript from which his clean 47-page text had originally been typed to make revisions extensive enough not only to satisfy his own artistic sensibility, but to assuage his sense of moral integrity. Either from this nonextant text or from another which apparently has not survived, it seems certain that Faulkner personally did retype into a "single mss. impression" the specially-bound gift booklet which he gave to Victoria Franklin. Also, it is virtually certain that Faulkner could not have possibly typed the "Victoria" copy from one of the "Brown" typescripts, because far too many major stylistic, as well as substantive variations, exist between the two for Faulkner to have transposed the alterations in his head and transcribed them intact onto the off-sized booklet pages of the "Victoria" copy; certainly not with so few typographical or punctuation flaws as are in evidence. Finally, whether the major energy Faulkner expended to fashion the "Victoria" version of The Wishing Tree into existence was the result of his natural, self-induced tendency to continue revising his prose, or whether it had been motivated by his determination to create a different gift for her, must remain a matter of scholarly conjecture. There is little doubt that both extant versions are distinct and complete unto themselves. In point of fact, both stories have different titles: the one he presented to Margaret Brown is unequivocally called The Wishing-Tree , its idiosyncratic hyphenation carrying through in each reference within the story itself. The "Victoria" copy, lacking the hyphen, with one exception, 16 is entitled The Wishing Tree with similar consistency throughout its text. And, significantly, Faulkner has given his main female protagonist different names: in the "Brown" version, she is referred to as Daphne; in the "Victoria" version, she is called Dulcie, as though to insure separate fictional identities with whom each of his recipients, if she so desired, might identify. Moreover, by internally comparing the texts of both extant versions of The Wishing Tree , the "Victoria" version in its original typescript, and the "Brown" version as manifested in its most recent, though virtually unchanged, incarnation, the Philip Stone copy of 1948, this distinctiveness between the versions becomes all the more consequential.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Like that of most literary artists, great or merely competent, Faulkner's fundamental approach to refining his prose consisted of progressively distilling and compressing it: 17 his revision was a matter of subtracting and sharpening, and, with rare exception, he did not indulge in adding to his already layered textures. Although a purely physical word-count might not, by itself, prove adequate confirmation of this premise, it certainly provides a basis from which to begin. By actual number, the "Brown/Stone" version of The Wishing-Tree consists of 11,100 words; the "Victoria" typescript is made up of 9,858 words. Comparative textual scrutiny allows us to isolate at least four basic approaches Faulkner employed in revising The Wishing Tree . One salient technique to which he consistently resorted was that of reducing or deleting extraneous or redundant description; information which did not particularly enhance the forward thrust of his narrative. The following three examples, excerpted randomly from the two versions, make clear how Faulkner moved from the density of the "Brown/Stone" version to a more gracefully distilled style inherent in the "Victoria" version: "I used to have a lot of ponies," the little old man said. "But we got shed of them. They et too much." (Page "12," "Brown/Stone" version) "I used to have a lot of ponies," the little old man said. (Page "18," "Victoria" version) "I wants some ham and gravy and a piece of cornbread and a cup of coffee," Alice said, and there it was in front of her. (Page "18," "Brown/Stone" version) "I wants some ham and gravy and a piece of cornbread and a cup of coffee," Alice said, and there it was. (Page "29," "Victoria" version) "It's just my pony," the redheaded boy explained. "But he'll come on home by himself: he always does that." (Page "34," "Brown/Stone" version) "It's just my pony," the redheaded boy explained. "He knows the way home, all right." (Page "53," "Victoria" version) Seemingly in an attempt to make the "Victoria" version read less like a literary exercise, favoring, instead, a more direct, if fabulous, narrative style calculated to communicate with and captivate a child's imagination and hold his interest, Faulkner consciously pared away many of his highly-stylized figurative and literary allusions. In doing so, he was able to heighten the "Victoria" version's simple, direct diction and repetitious phraseology. The following two examples manifest a reduction in overly-extended metaphorical comparisons: Soon it would be at her mouth, then it would pop out and jump up against the ceiling as though it were laughing at her ... (Page "1," "Brown/Stone" version) Soon it would be at her mouth, then it would pop out and jump right up against the ceiling . . . (Page "1," "Victoria" version) "Darling!" Daphne exclaimed. The gillypus was as big as a rabbit now, and Dicky hit it again. "Dont hit Mr. Egbert's gillypus!" Daphne cried. The gillypus was as big as a dog now, and Dicky hit it again. (Page "31," "Brown/Stone" version) "Darling!" exclaimed Dulcie. "Dont hit Egbert's gillypus! Alice! Alice!" "Kill little puppy," Dicky said. The gillypus was as large as a dog, now. "Cut little puppy in two," Dicky said, and the gillypus fell in two pieces. (Page "49," "Victoria" version) The following excerpt demonstrates Faulkner's conscious elimination of the metaphorical comparison altogether in the interest of directness as well as artistic taste: ...and the redheaded boy rose to his knees and still puffed and blew, and the pony was as large as a dog now; and the redheaded boy blew and puffed, and he got to his feet and the pony was as large as a calf and still it got bigger and bigger. (Page "6," "Brown/Stone" version) ...and the boy rose to his knees and still puffed and blew, and then to his feet, and the pony got bigger and bigger. (Page "9," "Victoria" version) These final two examples highlight Faulkner's awareness of the potentially distractive effect of abstruse or overt literary allusions and influences on the mind of a child: "Come and see," the redheaded boy replied, and she came over beside him and saw through the window the black trees with their bare dripping branches in the rain. "They're sorrying themselves," the redheaded boy murmured. (Pages "2-3," "Brown/Stone" version) "Come and see," the boy said, and she came up beside him and saw through the window the black trees with their bare dripping branches in the rain. (Page "3," "Victoria" version) "Come on," the redheaded boy said. And they went on and passed from out the forest, into a valley. This was the valley through which, in the old days, young Sir Galwyn of Arthgyyl, with the green design called Hunger at his right hand and the red design called Pain at his left hand, had ridden. It was full of sweet odors. . . (Pages "39-40," "Brown/Stone" version) "Come on," the redheaded boy said. They were in a valley now, and pretty soon they would reach a river. The valley was full of sweet odors. . . (Page "61," "Victoria" version) The effacement of this last literary allusion, referring as it does directly back to his allegory, Mayday , completed and dated January 27, 1926, as well as the image of the black trees "sorrying themselves," a blatant vestige of the Imagist movement, suggests Faulkner was reaching a turning point in his literary career. In fact, the great prose he would produce during the next dozen years would reflect this same careful concern for eliminating distractive imagery of this kind. Yet another effort Faulkner made to streamline and balance the "Victoria" version of The Wishing Tree is exemplified by the way he succeeded in this latter text at minimizing the roles of lesser characters in order to achieve a more sensible balance for the major participants. George's role is simply reduced; he spends less time on stage. Realizing he has dwelled inordinately on the vixenish qualities of Egbert's wife, Faulkner backs off: "I used to go to a sight of picnics," the little old man said, and the little old man's wife opened the kitchen door and glared at the little old man. "You, Egbert!" the little old man's wife shouted, and she glared at him again and slammed the door. . . (Page "39," "Brown/Stone" version) "I used to be a great hand for picnics," the little old man said, and then his wife opened the kitchen door. "You, Egbert!" she shouted, and slammed the door again. . . (Page "60," "Victoria" version) Also, Dicky's babyish persiflage is reduced to a degree. Of most significance, however, is the adjustment Faulkner makes in reducing the quantity of dialogue and improving the quality of the dialect Alice and her husband, Exodus, are made to express in the "Victoria" version: Faulkner allows them to fade back into the gestalt by sophisticating their posturing. Compared with their appearances in the "Brown" version, both characters seem far less self-mocking, minstrel-show stereotypes in their behavior and demotic: "You have something else, honey. Here, gimme yo' candy. You dont want no old candy, does you?" Alice took the candy out of Dicky's hand... (Page "16," "Brown/Stone" version) "You better have something else. Here, give me yo' candy." Alice took the candy out of his hand... (Page "25," "Victoria" version) "Name Exodus," Alice answered. "De one before him was name Genesis. I never did know what become of him. But you kin bet yo' money dat if meanness aint kilt him, de law's got 'im somewhere." (Page "23," "Brown/Stone" version) "Name Exodus," Alice answered. "Dey was two of 'em. The other one wus name Genesis, but meanness kilt him 'fore he wuz ten years old." (Page "37," "Victoria" version) "I dont believe I'll marry any more," the little old man said. "Even if I could, I mean." "All husbands thinks dat," Alice's husband said. "De trouble is, convincin' de womenfolks. De man what's got any business sayin' he dont think he'll marry no mo' is dead." (Page "29," "Brown/Stone" version) (entire sequence deleted ) (Page "45," "Victoria" version) A fourth revisionary concern Faulkner heeded in sophisticating his "Victoria" version of The Wishing Tree had to do with refinement by means of giving sharper focus and definition to his qualifying verbs, adverbs, and adjectives. Just two examples might serve to suggest the pervasive nature of this intensification: "Dont blow him up too big now, for me and Dicky," Alice said. (Page "7," "Brown/Stone" version) "Dont blow him up too big, now, for me and Dicky," she cautioned. (Page "11," "Victoria" version) "Drive first choss pony," Dicky said. (Page "8," "Brown/Stone" version) "Drive first choss pony," Dicky shouted. (Page "12," "Victoria" version) Whether the foregoing examples demonstrate a progressive revisionary evolution from the "Brown/Stone" version to the "Victoria" version of The Wishing Tree , or just a thorough reworking to insure that the gifts he was giving almost concurrently remained "unique," cannot be decided with absolute certainty. Aside from the notion of priority of texts, both distinct versions have their own literary as well as aesthetic merits: both can be read independently with relatively equal delight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV The side-by-side collation which follows, with the "Brown/Stone" version occupying the left-hand column, and the "Victoria" version in the right-hand column, preserves, with few exceptions, the two distinct texts as Faulkner himself typed them. I have chosen to transcribe the Philip Stone copy made by Faulkner in December, 1948, from the Margaret Brown 47-page typescript, because it represents the ultimate opportunity Faulkner had to handle and alter it. I have also elected to transcribe the original typescript Faulkner gave to Victoria Franklin in 1927, rather than reprint the text of the 1967 Random House edition for a decidedly fundamental reason: the Random House text in no way can be said to represent either the text which Faulkner himself typed, or that which the "silent" editor claims in the "Publisher's Note" Faulkner would not only have agreed to, but "extended . . . if he had been present to prepare the script for 1967 publication." The anonymous editor of this edition has taken more than justifiable liberties with his role as provider of an accurate text; furthermore, he is presumptuous in having assumed Faulkner would have accepted anything other than his consistent proper placement of apostrophes in contractions, his sporadic addition of grammatically correct commas and dialogue punctuation, and the seven necessary and salutary corrections of fundamental errors in tense and agreement, continuity and spelling which Faulkner committed. 18 Contrarily, having assiduously refined his Negro dialect in the "Victoria" version, Faulkner surely would have protested the seemingly arbitrary editing of almost all of Alice's and Exodus's speeches; notwithstanding its disclaimer, the Random House text presents a truncated and totally distorted rendition of the dialect Faulkner succeeded in making realistic, and, by doing so, grievously changes a weighty and highly pleasing aspect of the original typescript. Just as Faulkner refused to tamper with his Negro dialect in subsequent printings and editions of Sartoris , especially, and even in The Sound and the Fury , so too would he have been loath to compromise what he had written years earlier: apparently, Random House felt under no such aesthetic constraints; rather, they must have feared offending an audience which in 1967 was all too aware of the 1954 Supreme Court protocol and the 1962 James Meredith incident at Ole Miss, in Faulkner's own back yard. Other distortions persist as well which go beyond the normal expectations of silent editing. For instance, the "editor" has supplied numerous commas where they did not exist; conversely, too frequently he has deleted commas Faulkner intended in order to maintain his rhythm. Furthermore, the Random House edition has unduly committed eight gratuitous errors by creating words which did not originally exist, or by making arbitrary deletions or by causing distortions in words and phrases ostensibly transcribed from the original. 19 As a result of the printing of this highly unreliable text of the "Victoria" version by Random House, this article provides not only for the first publication of the "Brown/Stone" version of The Wishing-Tree , but in fact for the first authentic publication of the "Victoria" version as well. In both texts I have kept silent editing to a minimum, presenting them as "original" as possible. Such has been the rationale for not apostrophizing "aint," "dont," "cant," and "wont," as is consistent with Faulkner's idiosyncratic disregard for rendering them grammatically correct. Also, I have left intact most of the missing commas conventionally employed to set off clauses and modifiers and conjunctions. Also, I have not disturbed the texts by changing the position of existing commas or periods either inside or outside quotation marks, an inconsistency found most acutely in the "Brown/Stone" version. On the other hand, for the sake of clarity and basic consistency, I have silently corrected dialogue punctuation to the extent of providing a missing quotation mark for an incomplete pair and an occasional comma where a period existed, or placed a period where the comma existed. Also, where necessary, I have either raised a lower case word, proper noun, or pronoun, to the status of upper case, or done the reverse for words other than proper nouns and some pronouns beginning or continuing a piece of dialogue. Also, in a few instances in both texts, I have corrected misspelled proper names that were obvious inconsistencies in Faulkner's typing ("Dulcy" for "Dulcie"; "Dickey" for "Dicky"; "the wishing tree" for "the Wishing Tree"). And, generally, I have corrected silently typographical errors resulting clearly from misstruck keys which have rendered otherwise unintelligible words. In all cases in which the typographical mistake has produced an alternatively recognizable, though incorrect, word, I have followed it with a square bracket containing the sign "i.e." followed by the appropriate word. Finally, for lapsed words, I have inserted a square bracket containing, without a denotative sign, the intended word. The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version THE WISHING-TREE THE WISHING TREE She was still asleep, but she could feel herself rising up out of sleep just like a balloon: it was like she was a goldfish in a round bowl of sleep, rising and rising through the warm waters of sleep, to the top. And then she would be awake. And so she was awake, but she didn't open her eyes at once. Instead, she lay quite still and warm in her bed, and it was like there was another little balloon inside her, getting bigger and bigger and rising and rising. Soon it would be at her mouth, then it would pop out and jump up against the ceiling as though it were laughing at her. The little balloon inside her got bigger and bigger, making all her body and her arms and legs tingle, as if she had just eaten peppermint. What can it be? she wondered, keeping her eyes shut tight, trying to remember from yesterday. What can it be? She was still asleep, but she could feel herself rising up out of sleep, just like a balloon: it was like she was a goldfish in a round bowl of sleep, rising and rising through the warm waters of sleep to the top. And then she would be awake. And so she was awake, but she didn't open her eyes at once. Instead, she lay quite still and warm in her bed, and it was like there was still another little balloon inside her, getting bigger and bigger and rising and rising. Soon it would be at her mouth, then it would pop out and jump right up against the ceiling. The little balloon inside her got bigger and bigger, making all her body and her arms and legs tingle, as if she had just eaten a piece of peppermint. What can it be? she wondered, keeping her eyes tight shut, trying to remember from yesterday. "It's your birthday," a voice said near her, and her eyes flew open. There, standing beside the bed, was a strange boy with a thin ugly face and hair so red that it made a glow in the room. He wore a black velvet suit with red stockings and shoes, and from his shoulder hung a huge empty booksatchel. "Who are you?" she asked, looking at the redheaded boy in astonishment. "Name's Maurice," the redheaded boy answered. His eyes had queer golden flecks in them, like sparks. "Get up." She lay still again and looked about the room. The funniest thing was, there was nobody in the room except the redheaded boy and herself. Every morning when she waked, her mother and Dicky would be in the room, and soon afterward Alice would come in to help her dress and get ready for school. But today there was nobody in the room except the strange redheaded boy standing beside her bed and looking at her with his queer yellowflecked eyes. "Get up," the redheaded boy repeated. "I'm not dressed," she said. "Yes, you are," the redheaded boy answered. "Get up." So she threw the covers back and got out of bed, and sure enough, she was fully dressed----shoes and stockings, and her new lilac dress with the ribbon that matched her eyes. It was the funniest thing! The redheaded "It's your birthday," a voice said near her, and her eyes flew open.

So she threw the covers back and got out of bed, and sure enough, she was dressed ---shoes and stockings, and her new lavender dress with the ribbon that matched her eyes. The redheaded boy had gone to the window The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version boy had&#8232; gone over to the window and he stood with his face pressed to the&#8232; windowpane.&#8232;&#8232; "Is it still raining?" she asked. "It was raining last night."&#8232;&#8232; "Come and see," the redheaded boy replied, and she came over beside him&#8232;and saw through the window the black trees with their bare dripping&#8232; branches in the rain. "They're sorrying themselves," the redheaded boy &#8232;murmured. and stood with his face preseed against the glass "Is it still raining?" she asked. "It was raining last night." "Come and see," the boy said, and she came up beside him and saw through the window the black trees with their bare dripping branches in the rain. "I wish it wouldn't rain on my birthday," she said with disappointment. "I think it might stop raining today, don't you?" The redheaded boy glanced at her and then away, then he raised the windowsash. "Oh, don't do that!" she exclaimed, then she stopped in surprise, for as soon as the sash rose, instead of rain and black winter trees, she saw a soft gray mist that smelled of wisteria, and far down in it she heard little far voices calling, "Come down, Daphne." When she looked through the upper sash, there was the rain falling against the glass in crawling streaks, and the black sad trees; but beyond the open sash that soft wisteria scented mist and the little voices saying, "Come down, Daphne; Come down, Daphne." "Well, this is the funniest thing!" she exclaimed, looking at the redheaded boy, who was digging busily in his huge satchel. "It's because it's your birthday," the redheaded boy explained. "But nothing like this ever happened before on my birthday." "But it might have," the redheaded boy pointed out, taking something out of the satchel. "That's why birthdays are. And, on the night before your birthday---" he glanced at her with his queer goldflecked eyes "----if you get into bed left foot first and turn the pillow over before you got [i.e. go] to sleep, anything might happen," he added wisely. "That's exactly what I did last night!" she said. "But who is that calling me?" "I wish it wouldn't rain, on my birthday," she said with disappointment. "I think it might stop raining today, dont you?" The redheaded boy glanced at her and then away, then he raised the window. "Oh, dont do that!" she exclaimed, then she stopped, for as soon as the window rose, instead of rain and black winter trees, she saw a soft gray mist that smelled of wistaria, and far down in the mist she heard little far voices calling Come down, Dulcie; Come down, Dulcie. When she looked through the upper window sash, through the glass, there was the rain, and the black sad trees, but beyond the open sash, the soft wistariascented mist and the voices saying Come down, Dulcie; Come down, Dulcie. "Well, this is the funniest thing!" she said, looking at the redheaded boy, who was digging busily in his huge satchel. "It's because it's your birthday," he explained. "But nothing like this ever happened before on my birthday." "It might have," the boy answered, taking something out of the satchel. That's why birthdays are. And, on the night before your birthday----" he glanced at her with his queer goldflecked eyes "---if you get into bed left foot first and turn the pillow over before you go to sleep, anything might happen," he added wisely. "Oh, that's exactly what I did last night," she said. "But who is that calling me?" "Why not look down and see?" the redheaded boy suggested. So she leaned out the window into the warm, scented mist, and there, looking up at her from the ground, were Alice and Dicky, and George, a fat boy who lived across the street. "Come down, Daphne!" "Wait for me!" she cried down to them, "Why not look down and see?" the boy suggested, so she leaned out the window into the warm scented mist, and there looking up at her from the ground were Alice and Dicky and George, who lived just across the street. "Come down, Dulcie!" "Wait for me!" she cried down to them, The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version and the redheaded boy was again beside her. In his hand was a toy ladder about six inches long, and he raised the ladder and put one end of it to his mouth and blew through it, and at once the ladder began to grow. The redheaded boy puffed and blew, and the ladder got longer and longer until at last the end of it touched the ground, and Alice caught it and held it steady while she climbed down to them. "Got up at last, did you, Sleepyhead?" George asked, and Dicky chanted "Sleepyhead, Sleepyhead!" He was a little boy, and he always said whatever the others did. The redheaded boy climbed down the ladder, and he bent over and pressed his finger on a little shiny button on the ladder, and the air went Whsssssshhhhhhhhhhhh out to [i.e. of] the ladder and it was once more a toy ladder about six inches long. The redheaded boy put it back in his satchel. "Name's Maurice," he said shortly, looking from Alice to Dicky and then to George with his queer yellowflecked eyes. "Come on." The mist was like a big gray tent above them and around them, and a warm little breeze blew through it, smelling of wisteria. They went across the lawn to the street, and the redheaded boy stopped again. "Well," he said, "how shall we go? walk, or in a car, or on ponies?" "Ponies! Ponies!" Daphne and George shouted, and Dicky chanted. "Wide a pony! Wide a pony!" But Alice didn't want to. "Naw, suh," Alice said, "Me and Dicky ain't goin' to ride on no hawss; and Daphne you ain't got no business with no hawss, neither." "Oh, Alice!" "Naw, suh," Alice repeated. "You knows yo' mommer don't allow you to ride no hawss." "How do you know?" Daphne said, "she didn't say I couldn't." "How could she, when she don't know you'a [A] goin' to? I reckon we kin git wherever we's goin' just like we is." "Oh, Alice!" Daphne said, and Dicky chanted, "Wide a pony, wide a pony!" "Alice and Dicky can ride in the ponycart," the redheaded boy suggested. "You aren't scared of a ponycart, are you?" "I guess I ain't," Alice answered doubtfully. and the redheaded boy was at the window again. In his hand was a toy ladder about six inches long, and he raised the ladder to his mouth and blew on it, and at once the ladder began to get longer and bigger. The redheaded boy puffed and blew, and the ladder grew longer and longer until finally the end of it touched the ground and Alice held it steady while she climbed down to them. "Got up at last, did you, Sleepyhead?" George asked, and Dicky chanted "Sleepyhead, Sleepyhead!" He was a little boy, and he always said whatever the others did. The redheaded boy climbed down the ladder, and bent over and pressed his finger on a little shiny button on the ladder, and the air went Whishhhhhh out of the ladder, and it was once more a toy ladder about six inches long. The boy put it back in his satchel. "Name's Maurice," he said shortly, looking from Alice to Dicky and then to George with his yellowflecked eyes. "Come on." The mist was like a big tent about them and over them, and a warm little breeze blew through it, smelling of wistaria. They went across the lawn to the street, and the redheaded boy stopped again. "Well," he said, "how shall we go? walk, or in a motorcar, or on ponies?" "Ponies! Ponies!" Dulcie and George shouted, and Dicky said, "Pony! Pony! Want to wide pony!" But Alice didn't want to. "Naw, suh," Alice said, "me and Dicky aint going to ride on no hawss, and Dulcie, you aint got no business with no hawss, neither." "Oh, Alice!" "Naw, suh," Alice repeated, "You knows yo' mommer dont allow you to ride no hawss." "How do you know?" Dulcie said, "she didn't say I couldn't." "How could she, when she dont know you's goin' to? I reckon we kin git wherever we's goin' just like we is." "Oh, Alice!" Dulcie said, and Dicky chanted: "Wide a pony, wide a pony." "Alice and Dicky can ride in the ponycart," the redheaded boy suggested. "You aren't scared of a ponycart, are you?" "I guess I aint," Alice said doubtfully. The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version "Daphne better ride in the cart, too." "No," said Daphne, "I want to ride a pony. Please, Alice." "They're gentle ponies," the redheaded boy said. "See?" He reached into his satchel and brought out a Shetland pony no larger than a mouse, with a little red bridle with silver, tiny bells, and a red saddle on it. Daphne squealed with delight, and Dicky tried to climb right up the red headed [i.e. redheaded] boy's leg. "Mine! Mine!" Dicky shouted. "My first choss pony!" "My pony! My pony!" Dicky [i.e. George] shouted. [B] "First choice: I claim first choice!" "Here, you all wait," the redheaded boy said, holding the pony above his head while its little hooves pawed and scrambled in his hand, "Stand back, now." So they stood back and the redheaded boy knelt and set the pony on the ground, and he put his mouth to the pommel of the saddle and began to blow. And as he blew the pony began to grow larger. It got bigger and bigger, stamping its feet and shaking its bridle until the bells jingled and tinkled; and the redheaded boy rose to his knees and still puffed and blew, and the pony was as large as a dog now; and the redheaded boy blew and puffed, and he got to his feet and the pony was as large as a calf and still it got bigger and bigger. At last the redheaded boy raised his head. "Dulcie better ride in the cart too." "No: I want to ride a pony. Please, Alice." "They're gentle ponies," the redheaded boy said. "Look." He reached into his satchel and brought forth a Shetland pony no larger than a squirrel, with a red bridle with little silver bells and a red saddle on it. Dulcie squealed with delight and Dicky tried to climb right up the boy's leg. "Mine! Mine!" George shouted. "First choice: I claim first choice!" "My pony, my pony!" Dicky shouted, "My first choss pony!" "Here, youall wait," the redheaded boy said, holding the pony above his head while its little hooves pawed and scrambled in his hand, "Stand back, now." So they stood back and the boy knelt and set the pony on the ground, and put his mouth to the pommel of the saddle and began to blow. And as he blew the pony got bigger and bigger, stamping its feet and shaking its jingling bridle; and the boy rose to his knees and still puffed and blew, and then to his feet, and the pony got bigger and bigger. At last he raised his head. "There", he said. "Is that big enough?" "Who's dat 'un for?" Alice asked quickly. "Mine! Mine!" shouted George and Dicky together. "No, this one is Daphne's," the redheaded boy said. "Den you let some of dat air right back out," Alice said promptly. "Dat's too big for Daphne." "No, no!" Daphne protested. "Look, Alice! See how gentle he is!" She pulled up a handful of grass, and the pony nibbled it and shook his head until the silver bells on the bridle jingled like mad. Then Daphne held the reins and the redheaded boy took two more ponies from his satchel, and Dicky chanted, "First choss pony! First choss pony!" "How can your satchel hold so much, "There," he said. "Is that big enough for you?" "Who's dat un for?" Alice asked quickly. "Mine! Mine!" shouted George and Dicky together. "No, this one is Dulcie's," the redheaded boy said. "Den you let some of dat air back out," Alice said promptly. "Dat's too big for Dulcie." "No, no!" Dulcie objected. "Look, Alice! See how gentle he is!" She pulled up a handful of grass and the pony nibbled it and shook his head until the silver bells jingled like mad. Then she held the bridlerein and the boy took two more ponies from his satchel, and Dicky chanted, "First choss pony, first choss pony!" "How can your satchel hold so much, The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version and yet look like it's empty?" Daphne asked. "Because I'm Maurice," the redheaded boy answered "Besides anything is likely to happen on birthdays, he added gravely. &#8232; and yet look like it's empty?" Dulcie&#8232; asked.&#8232; "Because I'm Maurice," the redheaded boy answered. "And besides,&#8232; anything&#8232; is likely to happen on birthdays," he added gravely. "Oh," said Daphne. Then the redheaded boy blew these two ponies up and gave the reins to George to hold, and he took from his satchel a fourth pony hitched to a little wicker cart with bells all over it, and Dicky was just wild. The redheaded boy blew this one up too. Alice watched him nervously. "Oh," said Dulcie. Then the boy blew up these two ponies and&#8232;gave&#8232;the reins to George to hold, and took from the satchel a fourth pony hitched&#8232;&#8232;to a little wicker cart, with bells all over it, and Dicky was just wild. The&#8232;boy&#8232;blew this one up too. Alice watched nervously. "Don't blow him up too big now, for me and Dicky," Alice said. The redheaded boy puffed and blew. "Ain't dat plenty big enough?" suggested Alice uneasily. "Alice don't want him any bigger than a rabbit," George said. "He can't pull the cart if he's not any bigger than that, Alice." The redheaded boy puffed and blew, and soon the pony and cart were the right size. "You'll need a whip," he said, and he reached again into his satchel and got out a red whip. "Naw, suh," Alice said quickly, "we don't need no whip. You kin put dat right back." But Dicky had already seen the whip, and when the redheaded boy put the whip back in his satchel, Dicky yelled. So the redheaded boy gave Dicky the whip, and Dicky and Alice got in the cart and Dicky held the end of the reins in one hand and the whip in the other. "You mustn't hit de hawss wid yo' whup, honey," Alice said. "You'll make him run away." "Dont blow him up too big, now, for me and Dicky," she cautioned. The redheaded boy puffed and blew. "Aint dat plenty big enough?" suggested Alice uneasily. "Alice dont want him any bigger than a rabbit," George said. "He cant pull the cart is [i.e. if] he's not any bigger than that." The redheaded boy puffed and blew, and soon the pony and cart were the right size. "You'll need a whip," he said, and he reached again into his satchel. "Naw, suh," Alice said quickly, "We dont need no whip. You kin put dat right back." But Dicky had already seen the whip, and when the boy put it back in the satchel, Dicky yelled. So the boy gave Dicky the whip, and Dicky and Alice got into the cart and Dicky held the end of the reins in one hand and the whip in the other. "Drive first choss pony," Dicky said. "Shetland pony, darling," Daphne corrected, "Not first choice pony." "Drive Shetlun pony," Dicky said. Then Daphne and George and the redheaded boy got on their ponies and they rode down the street. They reached the end of the street and passed the last house, and then all of a sudden they rode out of the mist and into the sunshine. Behind them they could see the mist like a huge gray tent, but everywhere else the sun shone and the trees were green as summer, and the grass was green and little blue and yellow flowers were every- "Drive first choss pony," Dicky shouted. "Shetland pony, darling," Dulcie said, "Not first choice pony." "Drive Shetland pony," Dicky said. Then Dulcie and George and the redheaded boy got on their ponies and they rode down the street.

Birds were The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version where in the grass. Birds were singing in the trees, and flying from one tree to another; and the three ponies flew along the road, faster and faster, until Alice and Dicky in the cart were left far behind. They came to the edge of a forest, and they stopped here to wait for the cart. The cart came trotting up, and Alice was holding her hat one, [i.e. on,] and she looked a little alarmed. So they promised not to go fast any more, and they rode of [i.e. on] into the forest and after a while they came to a small gray cottage beside the road. The cottage had roses growing up over the door, and sitting in the door was a little old man wi[th] a long gray beard, whittling on a piece of wood. singing in the trees, and flying from one tree to another, and the sun shone and the three ponies flew along the road, faster and faster, until Alice and Dicky in the cart were far behind.

The cottage had roses above the door, and there was a little old man with a long gray beard sitting in the door, whittling a piece of wood. "Good morning," the redheaded boy said politely. "Good morning," the little old man replied politely. "We're looking for the Wishing-Tree," the redheaded boy said. "You are?" the little old man said. He wagged his head gravely. "It's a far ways," he said. "I don't hardly believe you could find it." "We are going to ask along the road," the redheaded boy explained. "There ain't anybody in these parts that ever seen it," the little old man said. "How do you know it's so far, then?" the redheaded boy asked. "Oh, I been to it lots of times," the little old man answered. "I used to go to it every day, almost, when I was your age. But I aint been to it now in several years." "Why not come with us and show us the way?" the red headed [i.e. redheaded] boy suggested. "You can ride in the cart with Alice and Dicky." Alice was mumbling to herself, and Daphne asked, "Good morning," the redheaded boy said politely. "Good morning," the little old man replied politely. "We're looking for the Wishing Tree," the redheaded boy said. "It's a far ways," the little old man said. He shook his head gravely. "I dont believe you could find it." "We'll ask somebody on the road," the boy said. "There aint anybody in these parts that ever saw it," the little old man said. "How do you know it's so far, then?" the redheaded boy asked. "Oh, I been to it lots of times. I used to go to it everyday almost, when I was your age. But I aint been in several years, now." "Why not come with us and show us the way?" the redheaded boy suggested. Alice was mumbling to herself and Dulcie asked, "What did you say, Alice?" "I says, we dont want no old trash like him with us. I bet he's a tramp. I bet yo' mommer wouldn't like it if she knowed." "Could I ride in your ponycart?" the little old man asked. "Yes," the redheaded boy answered. "If you'll come and show us the way to the Wishing-Tree." The little old man looked cautiously over his shoulder into the house. "What did you say, Alice?" "I says, we dont want no old trash like him with us. I bet he's a tramp. I bet yo' mommer wouldn't like it if she knowed." "Come on and go with us," the redheaded boy repeated. The old man looked cautiously over his shoulder into the house. "I believe I will," he said. He shut his "I believe I will," he said. He shut his The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version knife and he put it and the thing he was carving into his pocket. He rose, and peered again around the edge of the door into the house. "I guess I better go and show you the way, because-------" Then the little old man's wife came to the door and threw a rolling pin at the little old man, and a flatiron. "You lazy old scoundrel!" the little old man's wife shouted at him, "Sitting out here all day long, gassing with strangers, and not a stick of wood in the house to cook dinner with." knife and put it and the thing he was carving in his pocket. He rose, and peered again around the dooredge into the house. "I guess I better go and show you the way, because------" Then the little old man's wife came to the door and threw a flatiron at him, and a rollingpin and an alarm clock. "You lazy old scoundrel!" she shouted at him, "Sitting out here and gassing with strangers, and not a stick of wood to cook dinner with in the house!" "Mattie------" the little old man said. His wife reached her hand back into the house and she threw an alarm clock at the little old man, and so he ran around the corner of the house. The little old man's wife stood in the door and glared at them. "And you all with nothing better to do than keep folks from their honest work!" she said. She glared at them again, and slammed the door. "There now, what I tell you?" Alice said. "White trash!" "Well, I guess we'll have to ask somebody else where the Wishing-Tree is," the redheaded boy said. "Come on." They rode on past the house and along the garden fence. At the corner of the garden fence someone called cautiously to them as they passed, and they saw the little old man peering out from behind a row of tomato plants. "Is she gone?" the little old man hissed. "Yes," the redheaded boy answered. The little old man came out and climbed the garden fence. "Wait a minute for me," he said, "and I'll go with you." So they waited for him, and the little old man sneaked along the fence to the house, and grabbed up the alarm clock and the flatiron and the rollingpin and ran back down the road and climbed the garden fence again and hid the alarm clock and the rollingpin and the flatiron in the fence corner. "So she cant throw them at me when we come back," he explained cunningly. "Where can I ride?" "Maggie," the little old man said. His wife reached into the house again and threw a shoe at him, and he turned and ran around the corner of the house. The woman stood in the door and glared at them. "And you folks with nothing better to do than keep folks from their work," she said. She glared at them again and slammed the door. "There now, what I tell you?" Alice said. "White trash!" "Well, I guess we'll have to find the Wishing Tree by ourselves," the redheaded boy said. "Come on." They rode on past the house and along the garden fence. At the corner of the fence somebody called cautiously to them as they passes, [i.e. passed,] and they saw the little old man peering out from behind a row of tomato plants. "Is she gone?" he whispered. "Yes," the redheaded boy answered. The little old man came out and climbed the fence. "Wait a minute for me, and I'll go with you." So they waited for him and he sneaked along the fence to the house and picked up the clock and the rollingpin and the iron and ran back down the road and climbed the garden fence again and hid the things in the fence corner. "So she cant throw them at me when we come back," he explained cunningly. "You can ride in the cart with Alice and Dicky," the redheaded boy told him. Alice mumbled again, and Daphne asked. "What did you say, Alice?" "I says, me and Dicky dont want that "You can ride in the cart with Alice and Dicky," the redheaded boy said. Alice mumbled again, and Dulcie asked, "What did you say, Alice?" "I says, me and Dicky dont want that The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version old trash in the cart with us. Yo' mommer wont like it." "Why, cant I ride, too?" the little old man said in a hurt tone. "I wouldn't aim to hurt." "Let him ride in the cart, Alice," the redheaded boy said. "He wont bother you and Dicky." "Of course I wont, ma'am," the little old man said quickly, "I wouldn't think of it." "Let him ride in the cart, Alice," they all said. "Well, git in, then," Alice said ungraciously. "But yo' mommer wont like it." The little old man hopped nimbly into the cart, and they rode on. Alice turned her back on him. The ponies trotted on along the road. After a while the little old man said: "I can whittle things with a knife." old trash in the cart with us. Yo' mommer wouldn't like it." "Why, cant I ride too?" the little old man said in a hurt tone. "Let him ride in the cart, Alice," the redheaded boy said. "He wont bother you." "Of course I wont, ma'am," the little old man said. "I wouldn't think of it." "Let him ride in the cart, Alice," they said. "Well, git in, then," Alice said ungraciously. "But yo' mommer wont like it." The little old man hopped nimbly in, and they rode on. "I can whittle things with a knife," the little old man said. Alice sniffed. "I can whittle most anything I ever seen," the little old man said. Alice sniffed. The ponies trotted on beneath the trees. There were a lot of butterflies flying around, and squirrels and rabbits and birds. Alice sniffed. "This is a nice pony and cart you have," the little old man said. "First choss pony," Dicky said. "Shetland pony, darling," Daphne corrected. "Not first choice pony." "Shetlun pony," Dicky said. "This is a nice pony and cart you have," the little old man said. "First choss pony," Dicky said. "Shetland pony, darling," Dulcie corrected, "Not first choice pony." "I used to have a lot of ponies," the little old man said. "But we got shed of them. They et too much." "I used to have a lot of ponies," the little old man said. Alice sniffed again. "Bet you never had nothing in your life except flati'ons throwed at you." They came to a fork in the road and [the] redheaded boy stopped. "Which way?" he asked. "That way," the little old man answered immediately, pointing. They rode on that way. Alice sniffed again. "Bet you never had nothing except flatirons throwed at you in yo' life." They came to a fork in the road and the redheaded boy stopped. "Now, which way?" he asked. "That way," the little old man answered immediately, pointing. They rode on. "What were you carving when we came up?" Daphne asked. The little old man reached in his pocket and took the piece of wood out, and they all crowded about the cart to see it. "Little puppy," Dicky said. "It's a lizard," George said. "No, it's a dragon," said Daphne. "Isn't it?" "What were you carving when we came up?" Dulcie asked. The little old man reached in his pocket and took the piece of wood out, and they all crowded about the cart to look at it. "Little puppy," Dicky said. "It's a lizard," George said. "No, it's a dragon," Dulcie said. "Isn't it?" The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version "It aint nothing," Alice said. "He nor nobody else never saw nothing like that thing." "What is it?" Daphne asked. "I dont know," the little old man answered. "I dont know what it is, but I think it's a gillypus." "What's a gillypus?" asked George. "I dont know. But I bet it looks something like this." "Why do you call it a gillypus, then, if you dont know what a gillypus looks like?" George asked. "Well," the little old man answered, "it looks more like a gillypus than anything I ever seen." "It dont look like nothing, to me," Alice said. "Not like nothing I ever saw, even in a circus." "Did you ever go to a circus?" Daphne asked the little old man. "Alice has been." "I dont know," the little old man answered. "It used to be like I could kind of remember going to one, but that was a long time ago, and now I don't know if I remember or not." "It's in a big tent," George said. "A tent big enough to hold our house. I wish I had a circus tent." "It has flags on it," Daphne added, "colored flags flying on top of it." "I wants to go to a circus," Dicky said. "We are going to the next one," Daphne said. "Mother has already said we could. Alice is going to take us, aren't you, Alice?" "And a band," Alice added, "and a elefump bigger'n all dese ponies rolled into one, and all of us on top of 'em. That elefump was the biggest thing I ever seen in my bawn days. Lawd, Lawd." "It aint nothing," Alice said. "He nor nobody never saw nothing like that." "What is it?" Dulcie asked. "I dont know," the little old man answered. "I dont know what it is, but I think it's a gillypus." "What's a gillypus?" asked George. "I dont know, but I expect it looks something like this." "Why do you call it a gillypus, then, if you dont know what a gillypus looks like?" "Well," the little old man answered, "it looks more like a gillypus than anything I ever saw." "It dont look like nothing, to me," Alice said. "Not like nothing I ever saw, even in a circus." "Did you ever go to a circus?" Dulcie asked the little old man. "Alice has been." "I dont know," the little old man answered. "It used to seem like I could kind of remember going to one, but that was a long time ago and now I dont know if I remember or not." "It's in a big tent," George said. "A tent big enough to hold our house. I wish I had a circus tent." "It has flags on it," Dulcie added, "colored flags flapping on top of it." "I want to go to a circus," Dicky said. "We are going to the next one. Mother has already said we could. Alice is going to take us, aren't you, Alice?" "And a band," added Alice, "and a elefump big as ten of these ponies rolled into one. That elefump was the biggest thing I ever seen in my bawn days. Lawd, Lawd." "I wants to go to a circus, Alice," Dicky said. "So does I, honey. Spotted hawses, and folks spanglin' through de air...........Listen: dont I hear a band now?" It was a horn they heard, and they trotted on through the forest and came in sight of a huge gray castle, with a flag on top of it. A soldier stood on the wall of the castle, blowing the horn. ["]Once Alice's husband was a corporal in the army. I mean, a husband that Alice used to have was a soldier, too.["] "I want to go to a circus, Alice," Dicky said.v "So does I, honey. Spotted hawses, and folks spanglin' through the air.......listen: dont I hear a band now?" It was a horn they heard, and they rode on and came to a huge gray castle. The redheaded boy stopped again. "Which way now?" he asked. The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version "I wouldn't give nothing for a whole war full of soldiers," Alice said. "Not nothing." The redheaded boy stopped again. "Which way?" he asked. "That way," the little old man answered, pointing. They rode on that way, and soon they couldn't hear the horn any more, and still further on they found a curious tree beside the road. It was a white tree, and at first they thought it was a dogwood tree in bloom, but when they came up to it, they saw that the leaves on it were perfectly white. "What a funny tree," Daphne said. "What kind of a tree is it?" "It's a----a----it's a mellomax tree," the little old man said. "There's a lot of them in this forest." "I never saw a tree with white leaves before," Daphne said, and she pulled one of the leaves off. And as soon as she touched it, the leaf turned to a lovely blue color. "If that isn't the funniest thing!" Daphne exclaimed. "Look!" Then they each pulled a leaf from the tree. George's leaf turned purple, and the redheaded boy's was gold; and Alice took one and hers became a bright red, and she held Dicky up so he could pull one, and his was not any color especially: a kind of faint blending of all colors, with a blue the same shade as Daphne's, but paler, for the dominant note. "That way," the little old man answered, pointing. A soldier on the wall of the castle was blowing the horn. They rode on and passed the castle, and a little further on they came to a curious tree beside the road. It was a white tree, and at first they thought it was a dogwood tree in bloom. But when they came up to it they saw that the leaves were white. "What a funny tree," Dulcie said. "What kind of tree is it?" "It's a---a mellomax tree," the little old man said. "There are a lot of them in this forest." "I never saw a tree with white leaves before," Dulcie said, and she pulled one of the leaves off, and as soon as she touched it, the leaf changed its color and became a lovely blue. Then they all pulled a leaf off the tree. George's leaf turned purple, and the redheaded boy's was gold; and Alice took one and hers became bright red, and she held Dicky up and he got one, and his was not any color especially---kind of faint pinks and greens and mostly the same shade of blue as Dulcie's, but paler. "What color is yours?" Daphne asked of the little old man, who showed them his leaf, but his hadn't changed at all. "That's the color of everybody's wishes," the redheaded boy explained. "Daphne's are blue wishes, and Dicky's are a little of everything and not much of anything yet, because he's little, but when he's bigger they'll be blue like Daphne's because he's Daphne's brother; and Alice's are red wishes, and George's are purple ones; and yours----" he turned to the little old man "----yours are not anything, because you are satisfied with things as they are." "What color is yours?" Dulcie asked the old man, who showed them his leaf, and it was almost exactly like Dicky's except for the blue. "That's the color of everybody's wishes," the redheaded boy told them. "Dulcie's are blue, and Dicky's are not very much of anything yet, because he's little, but they'll be blue when he gets bigger, because he is Dulcie's brother; and Alice's are red wishes, and George's are purple, and mine are gold ones; and yours---" to the little old man "---are the same as Dicky's because you dont have many wishes either." "Why, this must be the Wishing-Tree," Daphne said. "No, no," the little old man answered, "This is not the Wishing-Tree: I've been "Why, this may be the Wishing Tree," Dulcie said. "No, no," the little old man answered. "This is not the Wishing Tree: I've been to The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version to the Wishing-Tree too many times not to know it. This is just a mellomax tree." "Well, which way is the Wishing-Tree, then?" the redheaded boy asked. "That way," the little old man answered promptly. And so they went on that way. the Wishing Tree too many times. This is a mellomax tree." "Well, which way is the Wishing Tree, then?" the redheaded boy asked. "That way," the little old man said promptly. And so they rode on. "It's an awful long way," George said, "and I'm hungry. I wish I had a sandwich." And then George nearly fell off his pony in surprise, because there in his hand was a sandwich. George stared at the sandwich, then he smelled it, then he bit it, and whooped for joy. "Look what George has got," everybody cried, and Dicky said: "It's an awful long way," George said, "and I'm hungry. I wish I had a sandwich." And then George nearly fell off his pony in surprise, for there in his hand was a sandwich. George stared at the sandwich, then he smelled it, then he bit it, and whooped for joy. "I want something to eat, too." And as soon as he said it, there was something in his hand. "What you got in your hand, honey?" Alice asked. The others crowded about the cart to see too. "What in the world is it?" Daphne asked. The redheaded boy pinched a bit of it off and put it in his mouth. "What does it taste like?" asked George. "It doesn't taste like anything," the redheaded boy answered, "because it isn't anything. It's just something. That was what Dicky wished for, you see: he didn't say bread or candy, he just said he wanted something." "I want something to eat too," Dicky said, and as soon as he said it there was something in his hand. "What you got in your hand, honey?" Alice asked. The others crowded about the cart to see also. "What in the world is it?" Dulcie asked. The redheaded boy pinched a bit of it off and put it in his mouth. "What does it taste like?" "It doesn't taste like anything," the boy said, "because it isn't anything. It's just something. That was what Dicky said he wanted, you see---he didn't say bread or candy, he just said he wanted Something." "I wants candy," Dicky said, and immediately it was a cake of chocolate which he had in his hand. "Alice, you know he cant have candy," Daphne said. "I want some candy," Dicky said, and immediately it was a cake of chocolate that he held in his hand. "Alice, you know he cant have candy," Dulcie said. "That's right, honey," Alice said. "You dont want no old candy, do you?" "Wants candy," Dicky insisted. "You have something else, honey. Here, gimme yo' candy." You dont want no old candy, does you?" Alice took the candy out of Dicky's hand, but as soon as she did so, the candy disappeared. "Wants candy," Dicky repeated. "You better have something else. Here, give me yo' candy." Alice took the candy out of his hand, but as soon as she did so, the candy disappeared. Alice sat for a moment in astonishment. Then she whirled upon the little old man. "You old man," Alice asked. [C] "You gimme back that candy, you hear? Taking his candy right out of a baby's hand, like that! You gimme that candy, you hear?" "Why," the little old man said with surprise, "I didn't take it. You taken it yourself." Alice sat for a moment in astonishment. Then she whirled upon the little old man. "You old man," Alice said, "You gimme back that candy, you hear? Taking right out of a baby's hand, like that. You gimme that candy, you hear?" "Why," the little old man said with surprise, "I didn't take it. You took it yourself." The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version "Dont you try to prank wid us!" Alice exclaimed. "Didn't somebody took it right outen my hand?" "Why, Alice!" said Daphne, "He didn't take it!" "Somebody did, then. And he is the closest!" Alice glared at the little old man. "I never taken it," the little old man repeated. "Dont you try to prank with me!" Alice exclaimed. "Didn't somebody took it right out of my hand?" "Why, Alice!" said Dulcie. "He didn't take it!" "Somebody did, then. And he is the closest." Alice glared at the little old man. "It just went," the redheaded boy explained. "Dicky was the one who wished it, and when Alice took it, it just went, because Alice hadn't wished for any candy." "Well, I dont like no such goingson around me," Alice said. "I think we better turn around a [i.e. and] go home." "I'm hungry," Dicky said. "I wants-------" "Don't you want some bread and butter and sugar?" Daphne asked quickly. "Or cookies?" "Wants cookies," Dicky said, and as soon as he said it, he had a cookie in each hand. "Well, if that isn't the funniest thing!" Daphne exclaimed. "That must have been the Wishing-Tree back there." "No, no," the little old man said, "I know the Wishing-Tree too well. That was just a mellomax tree." "Well," the redheaded boy said, "Whatever it was, I'm hungry too. Suppose we stop and all wish ourselves something to eat," he suggested. So they stopped and got down and hitched the ponies, and they sat in a circle beneath a tree. "Now, Daphne," the redheaded boy said, "You wish first." "It just went," the redheaded boy explained. "Dicky was the one who wished it, and when Alice took it, it just went, because Alice hadn't wished for candy." "Well, I dont like no such goingson around me. I think we better turn around and go home." "I'm hungry," Dicky said. "I want--" "Dont you want some bread and butter and sugar?" Dulcie said quickly. "Or cookies?" "Wants cookies," Dicky said, and as soon as he said it, he had one in each hand. "Well, if that isn't the funniest thing!" Dulcie exclaimed. "That must have been the Wishing Tree back there." "'No, no," the little old man said, "I know the Wishing Tree too well. That was just a mellomax tree." "Well, whatever it was, I'm hungry too. Suppose we stop and all wish ourselves something to eat," the redheaded boy suggested. So they stopped and hitched the ponies. "Now, Dulcie, you wish first." "I want------I want-------Let me think what I want. Oh, yes: I want some green peas and lady-fingers and an alligator pear and a chocolate malted milk." And as soon as she said it, there they were on the grass in front of her. "Now, Dicky," said the redheaded boy. "Alice will have to wish for him," Daphne said. "What do you want, darling?" "You wants some rice and gravy, dont you, honey?" asked Alice. "Wants wice and gwavy," said Dicky, and there it was in front of him. "Now, George," said the redheaded boy. "I want so much strawberries and chocolate cake that I'll be sick for a week." And immediately there was a huge bowl of strawberries and a fresh chocolate cake in front of him. "I want----I want......Let me think what I want. Oh, yes: I want some green peas and ladyfingers and an alligator pear and a chocolate malted milk." And as soon as she spoke, there they were on the grass before her. "Now, Dicky," said the redheaded boy. "Alice, you'll have to wish for him," Dulcie said. "What do you want, darling?" "You wants some rice and gravy, dont you honey?" asked Alice. "Wants wice and gravy," said Dicky, and there it was before him. "Now, George," said the redheaded boy. "I want so much strawberries and chocolate cake that I'll be sick for a week." And immediately there was a huge bowl of strawberries and a fresh chocolate cake before him. The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version "Now, Alice," said the redheaded boy. "I wants some ham and gravy and a piece of cornbread and a cup of coffee," Alice said, and there it was in front of her. Now, you choose," the redheaded boy said to the little old man. "I'll take apple pie and icecream," the little old man said. "We dont have icecream very much at home," he explained. "Now, it's my turn," the redheaded boy said. "I want some hot gingerbread and an apple." They sat on the grass and ate, and Alice helped Dicky because he was little. "Now, Alice," said the redheaded boy. "I wants some ham and gravy and cornbread and a cup of coffee," Alice said, and there it was. "Now, you choose," the redheaded boy said to the little old man. "I'll take apple pie and ice cream," the little old man said. "We dont have ice cream very much at home," he explained. "Now it's my turn," the redheaded boy said. "I want some hot gingerbread and an apple." They sat on the ground and ate. "George," Daphne said, "You're going to be terribly sick if you eat all those strawberries and that cake by yourself." "Dont care," mumbled George. "That's what I want." When they had all finished, they got on the ponies again. The redheaded boy turned to the little old man. "Which way now?" he asked. "George, you're going to be terribly sick if you eat all that cake and those strawberries," Dulcie said. "Dont care," George mumbled. "That's what I want." When they had all finished they got on the ponies again. The redheaded boy turned to the old man. "Which way now?" he asked. "That way," the little old man answered, and they went on that way through the forest. "I ate too much," George said. "I wish now I hadn't." "That way," the little old man answered, and they went on through the forest. "I wish I hadn't eaten so much," George said. "I wish we'd find the Wishing-Tree pretty soon. That's what I wish," Daphne said. A little further on the road forked again. "I wish we'd find the Wishing Tree pretty soon. That's what I wish," Dulcie said. A little further on the road forked again. "That way," the little old man said, and they went on that way. "I dont feel good," George said. "Why, there's that white tree again," Daphne said in surprise, "We've come back to it." "No, no," the little old man said quickly. "That's not the same tree. That's just another mellomax tree. There's a lot of them in this forest." "I believe it's the same tree, myself," the redheaded boy said. "So does I," Alice agreed. "I don't think he knows where that Wishing-Tree is not [i.e. no] more than I does. Did you ever see the Wishing-Tree?" "I've been to it more than a million times," the little old man answered hotly. "I know exactly where it is." "Have you been to it, really?" Daphne asked. "That way," the little old man said, and they went on. "I dont feel good," George said. "Why, there's that white tree again," Dulcie said with surprise. "We've come back to it." "No, no," the little old man said. "That's not the same one. That's just another mellomax tree. There's a lot of them in this forest." "I believe it's the same one, myself," the redheaded boy said. "So does I," Alice agreed. "I dont believe he knows where that Wishing Tree is no more than we does. Did you ever see that Wishing Tree?" "I've been to it more than a hundred times," the little old man answered. "I know exactly where it is." "Have you been to it, really?" asked Dulcie. The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version "I cross my heart, I have," the little old man said. "I used to go to it every day when I was a young man. Cross my throat and hope to die." "Well, this certainly looks like the same tree to me," the redheaded boy repeated. "Which way, then?" "Dont you all pay no more mind to him," Alice said, "He dont no more know where that tree is than I does," Alice's voice mumbled on, and Daphne asked, "What did you say, Alice?" "I says, He aint no better than a ole tramp, that's what I says." She turned and glared at the little old man, who cringed back into the corner of the cart and began to talk to Dicky. "I cross my heart, I have," the little old man said. "I used to go to it every day when I was a young man. Cross my heart and hope to die." "Well, this certainly looks like the same tree, to me," the redheaded boy said. "Which way, now?" "Dont youall pay no more mind to him," Alice said. "He dont no more know where that tree is than I does." Alice's voice mumbled on, and Dulcie asked, "What did you say, Alice?" "I says, he aint no better than a ole tramp, that's what I says." She turned and glared at the little old man, who cringed back into the corner of the cart. "If we just had a gun," the little old man said, "we could shoot some of these squirrels and rabbits and birds, couldn't we, now? There's a sight of game in this forest." "I wants a gun," said Dicky, and Alice flung up her hands and shrieked, for there was the gun in Dicky's hands, a gun so big that Dicky couldn't hold it, and it dropped on the little old man's foo[t.] "You----" said Alice, and she shrieked again. "You, young redheaded man, you take us right back home this minute, 'fo' dis ole fool kills us all dead. You come here and get dis here gun away from him. Look at him, pullin' a gun on me and dis baby!" "Why, Alice!" exclaimed Daphne, "he didn't do it! It was Dicky himself that wished the gun!" "I dont care who done it," Alice replied. "Just look at him yonder, grinnin' at us like a 'possum, waitin' a chance to rob and kill us all." She glared at the little old man. "Honest, ma'am," the little old man said, bewildered, "I never done it. I wouldn't even think-------" "Hush yo' mouf and get dat gun outen dis cart." The little old man stooped and put his hand on the gun, but as soon as he touched it, it disappeared, because he hadn't wished the gun. "Well," said Alice, watching him, "where is it? What you done with it? Take it right out from under yo' coat, 'fo' I calls a policeman." "If we just had a gun," he said to Dicky, "we could shoot some of these squirrels and birds, couldn't we, now? There's lots of game in this forest." "I want a gun," Dicky said, and Alice flung up her hands and shrieked, for there was a gun in Dicky's hands, a gun so big that he couldn't hold it and so it dropped right on the little old man's foot. "You-----" said Alice, and she shrieked again. "You, young redheaded man, you take us right back home 'fore this ole fool kills us all dead. You come here and get dis gun. Look at him, pullin' a gun out on me and this baby!" "Why, Alice!" exclaimed Dulcie, "he didn't do it! It was Dicky that wished the gun!" "I dont care who done it. Just look at him there, grinnin' at us, waitin' a chance to rob and kill us all." She turned and glared at the little old man. "Honest, ma'am," the little old man said, "I never done it. I wouldn't even think-----" "Hush your mouf and get that gun out of this cart." The little old man stopped and put his hand on the gun, but as soon as he touched it, it disappeared, because he hadn't wished for the gun. "Well," Alice said, "where is it? Take it right out from under yo' coat, 'fore I calls a policeman." "Alice!" Daphne exclaimed. "Dont' you "Alice!" Dulcie exclaimed, "Dont you The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version see it's gone? It's gone, Alice! He didn't wish for the gun: It was Dicky who wished for a gun." Alice flopped around on the seat. "We's goin' right straight home: you tell that redhead[ed] boy to pick out the first road he kin find. I'se had about all this goingson I kin stand." Alice fell to mumbling again, and they rode on, and after a while they came again to the gray castle. There were some soldiers marching through the gate of the castle, with a flag at the head of the company. "Look at the soldiers," Daphne said. "I dont feel very good," George said. "Soldiers is de most triflin' folks in de Lord's creatium," Alice said. "Eatin' all day and on de prowl half de night. Thank de Lawd de army dont depend on me be [i.e. to] boa'd um." see it's gone? It's gone, Alice. He didn't wish for a gun, it was Dicky who wished for the gun." Alice flopped around on the seat. "We's goin' right straight home: you tell that redheaded boy to pick out the first road. I'se had about all of this goin' on I can stand." Alice went to mumbling again, and they rode on, and soon they came to the gray castle again. There were some soldiers marching through the gate. "Look at the soldiers," Dulcie said. "I dont feel very good," George said. The soldiers marched through the gate, with a flag at the head of the company. ["]Once Alice had a husband who was a corporal in the army. I mean, a husband that Alice used to have was a soldier also.["] "A soldier's life is awful hard," Alice said. "I want a soldier," Dicky said. "You black nigger," Alice exclaimed, "Where you been?" The soldier that Dicky had wished for touched his soldier hat. "Why, if it aint Alice," he said. "And I'll Alice you!" Alice shouted at him. "If I jes' had a stick of stovewood in my hand-----" Alice blinked her eyes at the stick of wood, then she threw it at the soldier, but as soon as it touched him, it disappeared. "Jes' gimme one mo' stick," Alice said, and there was another stick in her hand and she threw it and it disappeared also. The soldier jumped behind a tree. "Lawd a mussy, woman," the soldier said, "what is you chunkin's me wid? Hants?" "You triflin' villyun," said Alice, and she started to climb out of the cart. "Alice!" exclaimed Daphne, "What in the world!" "It's dat husband I used to have. The one dat run off on me and lef' me wid a month house rent and not even a hunk of sidemeat in de house, and me payin' a lawyer to fin' out what de gov'ment done wid him. Him and his army!

"I want a soldier," Dicky said. "You black nigger," Alice exclaimed, "where you been?" The soldier that Dicky had wished for touched his soldier hat. "Why, if it aint Alice," he said. "And I'll Alice you," Alice shouted, "if I jes' had a stick of stovewood in my hand-----" Alice blinked her eyes at the stick of wood, then she threw it at the soldier, but as soon as it touched him, it disappeared. "Jes' gimme one mo' stick," and there was another in her hand, and she threw it and it disappeared too. The soldier ducked behind a tree. "Lawd a mussy, woman," he said. "What is you chunkin' at me?

The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version "She aint got a flatiron nor a rollinpin neither," the little old man called to the soldier. "And I dont need none," Alice said. "I dont need-----" "Run, run," the little old man said, "She aint got a flatiron or a rollingpin." "Hol' up," the soldier said, "I kin explain how come I never come back." "I bet you kin," Alice retorted. "You come right up here and git in this buggy and save yo' explainin' twell we gits home." The soldier came and got in the cart. "Don't you hurt my soldier," Dicky repeated. "He's Alice's soldier, darling," Daphne said. "Is that the soldier you lost in the war, Alice?" "He's de one," Alice answered. "And a good losin', too. Look at 'im! Even de war dont want him!" They rode on. The soldier and the little old man sat side by side in the back of the cart. "What's your husband's name, Alice?" asked Daphne. "Name Exodus," Alice answered. "De one before him was name Genesis. I never did know what become of him. But you kin bet yo' money dat if meanness aint kilt him, de law's got 'im somewhere." "Hol' up," the soldier said, "I kin explain how come I never got back." "I bet you kin," Alice retorted. "You come right here and git in this buggy and save yo' explainin' twell we git home."

"He's de one," Alice answered. "And a good losin', too. Look at 'im! even de war dont want 'im!" They drove on. The soldier and the little old man sat side by side at the back of the cart. "What's your husband's name, Alice?" Dulcie asked. "Name Exodus," Alice answered. "Dey was two of 'em. The other one wus name Genesis, but meanness kilt him 'fore he wuz ten years old." "I was in a war once," the little old man said to Alice's husband. "Which one?" Alice's husband asked. "I never did know," the little old man answered. "There was a lot of folks in it, I remember." "Sounds like de one I wuz at," Alice's husband said. "They're all about alike, I reckon," the little old man said. "I 'speck you's right," Alice's husband agreed. "Wuz it across de water?" "Across the water?" the little old man repeated. "Across de big up and down water," Alice's husband explained. "Man, man, dat wuz a war. A hundred days, and jes' water, up and down and up and down, and when ever you looked out de window, all you seen wuz dat restless water. Not even no sagegrass to look at and tell how far you come.

"They come right down in my pappy's pasture and fit the war I used to go to." "No, this wasn't that war. They came right down in my pappy's pasture and fought the war I went to." "Well, now," said Alice's husband, "If dat aint makin' war conveniump!" "And there was another war I went to," the little old man added, "It was the Seven Pines war." "Well, now," said Alice's husband, "If dat aint makin' war comvenient!" "And there was another war I went to. It was at a place named Seven Pines." "Were you behind one of the trees?" asked Daphne. "No, ma'am," the little old man answered. "There were a lot of generals at that war." "Well, now," said Alice's husband again. "Wars dont change much, does dey?" "I don't feel good," George said. "I think......." George's eyes had a far away look in them. "I think I'm going to be sick," George said. "Were you behind one of them?" Dulcie asked. "No, ma'am," the little old man answered. "There were more than seven generals in that war." "Well, now," said Alice's husband, "Wars dont change, does dey?" "I dont feel good," George said. "I think......." George's eyes had a far away look in them. "I think I'm going to be sick." "Who won the war you went to?" Daphne asked the little old man. "I dont know, ma'am," the little old man answered. "I didn't". "Dat's right, too", Alice's husband agreed. "I never seed a soldier yet dat ever won anything in a war except trouble gittin' in and mo' trouble gittin' loose. But den, white folks' wars is always run funny. Next time de white folks has a war, I think I aint goin'. I think I'll jes' stay in de army instead." "Who won the war you were in?" Dulcie asked.

But den, whitefolks' wars is always run funny. Next time de whitefolks has a war, I think I aint goin'. I think I'll jes' stay in de army instead." "I reckon that's better," the little old man agreed. "I think," said George, "that I'm going to be sick." And George sat right on his pony and became dreadfully ill. "He sho' did," Alice's husband said, "He couldn't be got no sicker goin' to the far offest war in de whole world." They all stopped, and pretty soon George stopped being ill, and they helped him into the cart. "Can I ride on this pony, mister?" the little old man asked the redheaded boy, and the redheaded boy said he could, and the little old man hopped out of the cart and mounted the pony. "Why didn't you wish for a pony before, if you wanted to ride on one?" Daphne asked the little old man. "You haven't "I guess that's better," the little old man agreed. "I think," said George, "that I'm going to be sick." And George sat right on his pony and got dreadfully sick. "He sho' did," Alice's husband said. "He couldn't a got no sicker goin' to de far offest war in de whole worl'." They all stopped, and presently George got a little better, and they helped him into the cart. "Can I ride his pony, mister?" the little old man said to the redheaded boy. The redheaded boy said Yes, and the little old man hopped out of the cart and mounted the pony.

And as soon as he said it, everyone had a sack of candy in his hand. "Dicky cant have candy, Alice," Daphne said "You know we have to promise not to let anybody give him candy when we're walking." So Alice took Dicky's sack, and they all thought up something for Dicky, and the little old man wished Dicky some more cookies. The little old man opened his sack. anything except apple pie and icecream. Cant you think of something you'd like to wish for?" "I dont know," the little old man said. "I hadn't thought about it. But I will think of something. Let's see.......I wish we all had a sack of pink and white striped candy." And as soon as he said it, everyone had a sack of candy in his hand. "Mine are soft ones," the little old man said. "I'm glad of that. I used to like the hard ones best, but now I have to eat soft ones, because my teeth aint what they used to be when I was a young man." "Let me see your teeth," Daphne said, and the little old man opened his mouth. He had no teeth at all. "Why dont you wish for some false teeth?" Daphne asked. "What are false teeth?" the little old man asked. "Wish for some, and see," Daphne suggested. "All right," the little old man agreed. "I wish I had some false teeth", he said, and he clapped his hand to his mouth and looked at Daphne in astonishment. "Dont you like them?" Daphne asked. "I dont really believe I do," the little old man answered. "I've kind of got used to not having any, you see." He took the false teeth out and looked at them. "They're right pretty, now, aint they? They'd look right nice on the mantleshelf, wouldn't they? I think I'll just keep them for that." They rode on through the forest, under the huge oak trees, eating their candy. Except George. George didn't want any candy right now, and he put his sack in his pocket to take home with him. There were a lot of birds in the trees chirping to one another, and squirrels scudded across the grass from one tree to another, and there were flowers of all kinds and colors in the grass. "Mine are soft ones," the little old man said. "I used to like the hard ones best, but now I have to eat the soft kind, because my teeth aint what they used to be when I was a young man." "Let me see your teeth," Dulcie said, and the little old man opened his mouth. He didn't have any teeth at all. "Why dont you wish for some false teeth?" Dulcie asked.

"I dont really believe I do," the little old man answered. "I've got used to not having any, you see." He took the teeth out and looked at them. "They're right pretty, aint they? They'd look right nice on the mantle piece, now, wouldn't they? I think I'll just keep them for that." They rode on through the forest, under the huge oak trees.

And he made the pony dash down the road until the little old man's beard streamed out behind him in the wind, then he made the pony whirl around and come dashing back. "I bet you never went to no war in your life," Alice said. "I bet so too," George said. George was feeling better now. "I bet if you ever saw a enemy, you'd run." "I bet I wouldn't", the little old man replied quickly. "I bet I'd cut a enemy right in two with my sword. If I just had a sword in my hand-----------" And there was the sword in his hand---a new shiny one, with a gold handle, and the little old man looked at the sword, and then he rubbed it on his coat until it shone like a mirror, and he showed his sword to Alice's husband. Alice's husband said it was a fine sword, but he said it was a little too long to suit him, because he liked a knife you could hang on a string down your back, inside your shirt. "This is the way I used to do at a war," the little old man said. "Look at me". And he waved his sword and made the pony dash dow[n] the road again and then come flying back. "I bet you'd be scared as scared," George said. "I bet I wouldn't be scared of a hundred enemies," the little old man said, "with a fine sword like this. I bet I'd just ride right into 'em and slice 'em right in two." "I bet you couldn't slice a----a----rabbit in two," George said. "I bet you'd be scared." little bells on the bridle jingled like mad.

Alice's husband said it was a fine sword, but he said it was a little too long to suit him; because he liked a knife you could hang on a string down your back, inside your shirt.

"I bet I've killed a hundred tigers and lions in this very forest," the little old man said, "with a sword just like this....No, I used the sword at them wars. I dont remember what I killed the tigers and lions with. It was something else." "I guess you kilt 'um dodgin' rollin' pins and flati'ons," Alice said.

That's de way I'd conduck a war." "It would save a lot of money, wouldn't it?" the little old man agreed, "because they could pick up the rollingpins and flatirons and use them again. couldn't they?" "I've knowed 'um dat dont need no flati'ons and rollin'pins," Alice's husband said. "Wait twell you's been married as frequent [E] as I is." "I don't believe I'll marry any more," the little old man said. "Even if I could, I mean." "All husbands thinks dat," Alice's husband said. "De trouble is, convincin' de womenfolks. De man what's got any business sayin' he dont think he'll marry no mo' is dead." "Yaah," said George. "I bet if a lion jumped out from behind that tree, you'd fall dead."

But Alice's voice drowned them all, and she caught Dicky up in one arm and dragged Daphne by the other and flew down the road. Behind them came George howling at the top of his voice, but the little old man, still carrying his sword, distanced them all. "Stop! Stop!" the redheaded boy shouted, and Alice stopped and leaned against a tree, panting for breath. There, in the middle of the road, was the lion, and beside it the redheaded boy on his snorting pony. "Come back," the redheaded boy called to them, "He wont hurt you." "Not twell you gits dat thing outen here!" Alice said. "You Daphne! Dont you go back up there." "All you have to do," the redheaded boy said, "Is for the one who wished the lion, to unwish him.

But the little old man, still carrying his sword, distanced them all. "Stop! Stop!" the redheaded boy shouted, and Alice stopped and leaned against a tree, panting for breath. There, in the middle of the road, sat the lion, and near it on his snorting pony, was the redheaded boy. "Come back," the redheaded boy called to them, "he wont hurt you." "Not twell you git dat thing out of here," Alice said. "You, Dulcie! Dont you go back up there." "All you have to do," the redheaded boy said, "is for the one that wished the lion to unwish him. Who was it who wished him? It was George, wasn't it?" "I guess so," George answered. The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version "Well, do you want him any longer?" the redheaded boy asked. "Not me," George replied. "I hope I never see another lion as long as I live." And as soon as George said this, the lion was gone. "Now we can go back," Daphne said. "You, Daphne!" Alice exclaimed. "Dont you go up there! Dat thing jes' jumped back behind that tree: I seen him!" "No, no," the redheaded boy said, "He's gone. Come on back." They went back, and the little old man who had run still further down the road, came back too, with his sword; and Alice's husband climbed down from the tree and came back also. The lion was gone, but Alice wasn't satisfied until she had looked behind all the trees. But the lion was really gone. "Well, do you want him?" the redheaded boy asked. "Not me," replied George. "I hope I never see another one." And as soon as George said this, the lion was gone. "Now we can go back," Dulcie said. "You, Dulcie!" Alice exclaimed. "Dont you go up there! That thing jes' jumped behime that tree: I seen him!" "No, no," the redheaded boy said, "he's gone. Come on back." They went back. Alice had to look behind all the trees, but the lion was really gone. "Why didn't he run after us?" Daphne asked. "Because none of you wished he would," the redheaded boy explained. "You certainly didn't look like you were wishing he'd run after you. And now the ponies are gone, too. You all wished them away when you saw the lion. Everybody wished they could run, you know, and you cant run when your're [i.e. you're] sitting on a pony or in a cart." "Why, where are the ponies?" Dulcie asked. "Youall wished them away when you saw the lion," the redheaded boy said. "When the lion jumped out, everybody wished he could run, and you cant run while you're sitting on a pony or in a cart." They looked at one another in astonishment. "Will we have to walk?" Daphne asked. They looked at one another in astonishment. "Will we have to walk?" Dulcie asked. "Well, I haven't any more ponies in my satchel," the redheaded boy replied. "I 'speck us better walk," Alice said. "De mo' us rides, de further us gits from home. Dey's somethin' mighty curious about this," Alice added and she glared at the little old man, who now wore his sword thrust through his left gallus. "And you kin jes' do somethin' wid dat knife, too," Alice said. "Well, I haven't got any more ponies in my satchel," the redheaded boy replied. "I 'speck us better walk," Alice said. "De mo' us rides, de further us gits from home. Dey's something mighty cur'us about dis," Alice added and she glared at the little old man, who came up with his sword. "I aint going to hurt no one with it," the little old man [said]. "Besides, I've lost my gillypus. It fell out of my pocket and now I cant find it." "I've lost my gillypus," the little old man said. "It fell out of my pocket, and now I cant find it." "That's too bad," Daphne said. "It was a nice gillypus. Don't you wish it could walk and talk, and then you could find it." "I sure do," the little old man said. "It was the best gillypus I ever seen." And then they heard a rustling in the grass, and a little thin voice crying: "Here I come, Egbert; here I come." "That's too bad," Dulcie said. "It was a nice gillypus. Dont you wish it could walk and talk, and then you could find it." "I sure do," the little old man answered. "It was the best gillypus I ever seen." And as soon as he spoke, they heard a scuffling through the grass, and a little thin voice crying, "Here I come Egbert; here I come." The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version "That's my name," the little old man said, stooping down to see where the gillypus was. The rustling came nearer, and soon they saw the gillypus running through the grass. "Little puppy," said Dicky, and he caught up a stick from the ground and hit the gillypus, and the gillypus got larger, and Dicky hit it again, and the gillypus got larger still. "That's my name," the little old man said. The scuffling came nearer, and soon they saw the gillypus running through the grass. "Little puppy," exclaimed Dicky, and he caught up a stick from the ground and hit the gillypus, and every time he hit it, the gillypus got larger and larger. "Darling!" Daphne exclaimed. The gillypus was as big as a rabbit now, and Dicky hit it again. "Dont hit Mr. Egbert's gillypus!" Daphne cried. The gillypus was as big as a dog now, and Dicky hit it again. "Alice! Alice!" Daphne exclaimed, trying to catch the stick Dicky was hitting the gillypus with. "Darling!" exclaimed Dulcie, "Dont hit Egbert's gillypus! Alice! Alice!" "Kill little puppy," Dicky said, and the gillypus fell dead. "Cut little puppy in two," Dicky said, and the gillypus flew in two pieces. "Look what you done!" the little old man said, and he hid his face in the bend of his arm, and wept. "I'm awful sorry," said Daphne. "Dicky's a bad boy to kill your gillypus." Then another little voice wailed up from the grass at their feet, and they looked down and there was Dicky, no bigger than a lead soldier in a clump of grass. "That's because he made a bad wish," the redheaded boy explained. "A wish that hurt something." "Dont step on him!" Daphne shrieked, and almost at the same moment Daphne and Alice were little like Dicky, and Alice picked Dicky up and drew Daphne to her with the other arm. "You ole fool," Alice shouted up to the little old man in her thin tiny voice, "Look what you done! Dont you step on us!" "I dont know what to do, now," the redheaded boy said. "Dicky'll have to stay little until he does a good deed for somebody, and Daphne and Alice wont wish themselves big again as long as Dicky must stay little." "I think we all better get little, too," the little old man said, "so we can stay together." "I guess that's the best idea," the redheaded boy agreed. "But before we do, let's "Kill little puppy," Dicky said. The gillypus was as large as a dog, now. "Cut little puppy in two," Dicky said, and the gillypus fell in two pieces. "Look what you done!" said the little old man, and he hid his face in his elbow, and wept. "I'm awful sorry," said Dulcie. "Dicky's a bad boy to cut your gillypus in two." Then another little voice wailed from the grass at their feet, and they looked down and there was Dicky, no bigger than a lead soldier. "That's because he made a bad wish," the redheaded boy explained, "a wish that hurt something." "Dont step on him!" shrieked Dulcie, and almost at the same moment Dulcie and Alice were little like Dicky, and Alice picked Dicky up and held Dulcie against her with the other arm. "You ol' fool," Alice shouted up to the little old man in her thin tiny voice, "look what you done! Dont you step on us!" "I dont know what to do, now," the redheaded boy said. "Dicky'll have to stay little until he does a kind deed for someone, and Dulcie and Alice wont get big again as long as Dicky must stay little." "I think we all better get little, too," the little old man suggested, "so we can stay together." "All right," the redheaded boy agreed. "That's the best idea." The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version be sure we still have our colored leaves, so we can get big again." "Not me," said George quickly. "I dont want to be that little. I wish I was home." And George just disappeared. "I'm sorry he's gone," the little old man said. "I could have killed that lion, if I hadn't been so surprised." The redheaded boy and the little old man had their leaves in their pockets, but Alice's husband didn't have a leaf, so they had to wish for him; and they did, and then they were all little like Alice and Daphne and Dicky. "Not me," said George quickly. "I dont want to be that little. I wish I was home." And George just disappeared. "I'm sorry he's gone," the little old man said. "I could have killed that lion, if I hadn't been so surprised." Then the others were all little, like Alice and Dulcie and Dicky. "Golly," said the little old man. They were in a huge forest of the funniest trees. The trees were green all over, and they were flat, like huge sword blades stuck into the ground, and there were no branches and leaves on them at all. "Gee," said the little old man. They were in a huge forest of the funniest trees. The trees were green all over, and they were flat, like huge sword blades, and they didn't have any branches or leaves at all. "That's grass," the redheaded boy explained. "We better go this way." They went on among the funny flat trees, and soon they came to a yellow mountain. "This is a funny mountain," the little old man said. "It's made out of wood, like somebody whittled it with a big knife." They went on along the foot of the mountain, looking for a road that went over it or around it. But there didn't seem to be any way that they could get around it. "That's grass," the redheaded boy explained. "We better go this way." They went on among the funny flat trees, and soon they came to a yellow mountain. "This is a funny mountain," the little old man said. "It's made out of wood." They walked along beside the mountain, trying to find a road up it. But the mountain went on across the path, and they couldn't get by it. "I know what it is," the redheaded boy said, "It's Mr. Egbert's gillypus." "I wish I had my gillypus," the little old man said, and they stopped in astonishment, because the mountain disappeared, and then the little old man clapped his hand to his pocket and said, "Something jumped into my pocket." And he put his hand in his pocket and took out his gillypus. "Well," the little old man said, "I'm certainly glad to get this gillypus back again. It's the best gillypus I ever made." "I know what it is," the redheaded boy said, "It's Egbert's gillypus." "I wish I had my gillypus," the little old man said, and they stared in astonishment, for the mountain disappeared, and then the little old man said, "Something jumped in my pocket then." And he put his hand in his pocket and took out his gillypus. "Well," the little old man said, "I'm certainly glad to get this gillypus back again. It's the best gillypus I ever made." So they went one, [i.e. on,] and they came out of the flat forest into a great wide desert, and standing in the middle of the desert was the biggest beast Alice had ever seen, or Alice's husband either. "It's bigger'n dat elefump," Alice said. "It's just my pony," the redheaded boy explained. "But he'll come on home by himself: he always does that." They went on across the desert, and all So they went on, and they came out of the forest into a great desert, and standing in the middle of the desert was the biggest beast Alice had ever seen, or Alice's husband either. "It's bigger'n that elefump," Alice said. "It's just my pony," the redheaded boy explained. "He knows the way home, all right." They went on across the desert, and then The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version of a sudden something whooshed through the air and a jaybird as big as two eagles flew down at them. Alice caught Dicky up and caught Daphne to her, and the jaybird whirled about them, trying to peck Dicky up with his beak. Alice's husband aimed his soldier gun and shot at the jaybird, but the jaybird kept on whirling around them trying to eat Dicky up. The jaybird thought Dicky was a bug, because Dicky was so little. "Put your hat on the ground!" the redheaded boy shouted to the little old man, while Alice's husband was fighting with the jaybird, and the little old man put his hat on the ground and the redheaded boy wished it was as big as a soup plate, and it was, and they all got under it. They could hear the jaybird pecking at the hat, but he couldn't get in. After a while they couldn't hear the jaybird any more, and Alice's husband raised the hat and looked out. "He's gone," Alice's husband said. Then he dropped the hat and jumped back inside. "Lawd save us," he shouted. "Here comes a earthquake!" And before he finished saying it, the ground rose up under them and they tumbled over one another and rolled down a hill, and the hat rolled off of them and they could see the earthquake going on past them. They could see the ground hunching up like there was something burrowing along under it. "It's a mole," the redheaded boy said. "That's what it was. Come on, we better get back into the forest and think what to do." They ran back among the flat funny trees again, and Alice sat down against one of the trees to get her breath. "I think," the redheaded boy said, "that we'd better wish Alice's husband big again, and we'll all get in his hat and he can carry us." So they wished Alice's husband big again, and he put his hat on the ground and picked them up carefully and put them in the hat. "You big fool," Alice shouted at him in her tiny thin voice, "you pick me and dis baby up careful, or I'll tear yo' head off and unravel yo' backbone clean down to yo' belt." So Alice's husband put them in carefully, all of a sudden a jaybird twice as big as an eagle flew down at them. Alice caught Dicky up again and grabbed Dulcie with the other hand, and the jaybird whirled about them, trying to peck Dicky up with his beak. Alice's husband aimed his rifle and shot at the jaybird, but the jaybird kept on whirling about them, trying to eat Dicky up. The jaybird thought Dicky was a bug, because Dicky was so little. "Put your hat on the ground!" the redheaded boy shouted to the little old man, while Alice's husband was fighting the jaybird, and the little old man put his hat on the ground and the redheaded boy wished the little old man's hat was as big as a soup plate, and it was; and they all got under it. They could hear the jaybird pecking at the hat, but he couldn't get in. Finally they couldn't hear the jaybird any more, and Alice's husband raised the hat and looked out. "He's done gone," Alice's husband said. Then he dropped the hat and jumped back inside. "Lawd save us," Alice's husband shouted, "here comes a earthquake!" And all of a sudden the ground rose up beneath them and they tumbled over one another and fell down a big hill, and the hat rolled over, and down they went tumbling, and they could see the earthquake going on past them. They could see the ground hunching up like something was burrowing along under it. "It's a mole," the redheaded boy said, "that's what it was. Come on, we better get back into the forest and think what to do." They ran back among the funny flat trees again. "I think," the redheaded boy said, "that we'd better wish Alice's husband big again, and we'll all get in his hat and he can carry us home." So they wished Alice's husband big again, and he put his hat on the ground and picked them up one at a time very carefully and put them in the hat. "You big fool," Alice shouted at him in her tiny high voice, "you pick me and dis baby up easy, or I'll tear your head clean off and unravel yo' backbone down to yo' belt." Then Alice's husband picked up his hat The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version and he picked up his hat and went on. Daphne and Dicky and Alice and the redheaded boy and the little old man sat in the hat. They couldn't see anything except Alice's husband's head, and the sky and the treetops, and the hat had a kind of swinging motion like a hammock when Alice's husband walked; and after a while Dicky went to sleep, and Daphne began to get drowsy, too. But she couldn't get comfortable, because there wasn't [i.e. weren't] any pillows in Alice's husband's hat. I wish I was in my nice soft bed, Daphne said to herself. "No, I don't! I dont!" she screamed, but it was too late, for she was once more at home in her bed, in her room by herself. "I dont want to be here!" Daphne wailed. "I want to find Mr. Egbert so he can tell me where they went to!" And once more she stood in the road before a small gray cottage with roses growing over the door. "This is not where I left them!" Daphne said. "I want to be where Alice and Dicky and Maurice and Mr. Egbert and Alice's husband are." But nothing happened. Daphne waited a moment, then she wished again. But still nothing happened, and then she remembered her blue leaf and put her hand in the pocket of her dress. The leaf was gone. and went on. Dulcie and Dicky and Alice and the redheaded boy and the little old man sat in the hat. They couldn't see anything except Alice's husband's head and the sky and the treetops, and after a while Dicky went to sleep, and Dulcie began to get drowsy. But she couldn't get comfortable, because there wasn't a pillow in Alice's husband's hat. "I wish I was in my nice soft bed," Dulcie said to herself. "No I dont! No I dont!" she screamed, but it was too late, for she was again in her bed at home, in her room by herself. "I dont want to be here!" Dulcie wailed. "I want to find Mr Egbert so he can tell me where the others went!" And once more she was in front of a gray cottage with a rose growing over the door. "This is not where I left them!" Dulcie said. "I want to be where Alice and Dicky and Maurice and Mr Egbert and Exodus are." But nothing happened, and Dulcie remembered her colored leaf, and she put her hand in the pocket of her dress. The leaf was gone. Daphne didn't know what to do, but she expected she was going to cry. She stood in the road in front of the house, and then she heard somebody chopping wood behind the house, and she opened the gate and entered the yard. The door of the house was shut, and on the ground near the stoop were some slivers of wood where someone had been whittling, and scattered about the yard were a flatiron and a rollingpin and an alarm clock. The axe was still chopping behind the house, and Daphne went on around the corner toward the sound, and there at the woodpile a little old man with a long white beard worked busily. Daphne flew across the yard to him. Dulcie didn't know what to do. She stood in the road in front of the cottage, and then she heard somebody chopping wood behind the house, and she opened the gate and entered the front yard. The door of the cottage was closed, and on the ground near the door were some slivers of wood where someone had been whittling with a knife, on [i.e. and] scattered about the yard were a flatiron and a rollingpin and an alarm clock. Dulcie went on around the house and there was a little old man with a long white beard, chopping wood. Dulcie went up to the little old man. "Where are the others, Mr. Egbert?" Daphne asked. The little old man stopped in the middle of a stroke and turned with the axe held about [i.e. above] his head. Then he lowered the axe. "Ma'am?" the little old man said. "Where are the others, Mr Egbert?" Dulcie asked. The little old man dropped his axe and whirled around. "Ma'am?" the little old man said. "I've lost them," Daphne explained. "I've lost them," Dulcie explained. "We The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version "We were all together there, and I got lost, and now I dont know where they are," she wailed. The little old man dropped the axe, "Was it a picnic?" he asked with interest. "I used to go to a lot of picnics, in my time." "Why, you were with us," said Daphne in surprise. "Did you get lost, too?" The little old man had the kindest blue eyes, bright and innocent and kind. "I used to go to a lot of picnics," the little old man said. "But I aint been to one now in a long while." "Why, you were with us this morning!" Daphne exclaimed. "Dont you remember? You had apple pie and icecream!" "Did I, now?" the little old man said with pleasure. Then he wagged his long white beard. "I used to be a great hand for icecream, in my day. But we dont have icecream very often now, icecream and apple pie. Well, sir." He pushed the wood he had been chopping aside. "Wont you have a seat on this log?" he said politely. were all together there, and now I cant find them," she wailed. "Was it a picnic?" the little old man asked. "I used to go to a lot of picnics." "Why, you were with us. Did you get lost, too?" asked Dulcie. The little old man had the kindest blue eyes. "I used to go to a lot of picnics," the little old man said. "But I aint been to one now in a long while." "Why, you were with us this morning!" Dulcie exclaimed with surprise. "Dont you remember? You had apple pie and icecream!" "Did I, now?" the little old man said. He waggled his long white beard. "I used to be a great hand for icecream, in my day. But we dont have icecream very often, now." The little old man pushed the wood he had been chopping aside. "Wont you have a seat on this log?" the little old man said politely. Daphne sat down sadly. "Then you dont know where they are?" she asked. The little old man sat down also. "Lordy, Lordy," he said, and he wagged his beard again, "It's been a power of years since I went to a picnic. But then, I aint as spry as I once was, and I've kind of got lazy. That's the reason I chop wood, you see. We got a nigger to do it, but I like to chop ocasionally for a little exercise." Dulcie sat down sadly. "Then you dont know where they are?" she asked. The little old man sat down also. "Lordy, Lordy," he said, "it's been a power of years since I went to a picnic. But then, I aint as young as I once was, and I've kind of got lazy. That's the reason I chop wood, you see, for a little exercise." "How old are you?" Daphne asked. "Well," the little old man answered, "one April I turned ninety two, but that's been........let's see.....Well, I dont think it's been so long ago, and so I expect I'm still about ninety two." "How old are you?" Dulcie asked. "I'm ninety two this past gone April a year," the little old man replied. "And so you dont know where they are," Daphne said. "I was with them, and then I got l-lost, and now I c-cant f-find them, and I'm sc-cared," [i.e. sc-scared,"] Daphne wept. The little old man jumped up nervously, and he made a clucking sound with his tongue. Suddenly he reached into his pocket. "Look what I got," he said. Daphne dried her eyes and looked. "Why, it's the gillypus!" she exclaimed. "Is that what it is?" the little old man said, pleased. "I made it myself, but I didn't know what it was. You can have it, if you want," he added. "And so you dont know where they are," Dulcie said. "I was with them, and then I got l-lost, and now I c-cant f-find them, and I'm sc-scared," Dulcie wept. The little old man jumped up nervously, and he made a clicking sound with his tongue. Suddenly he reached into his pocket. "Look what I made," he said. Dulcie wiped her eyes and looked. "Why, it's the gillypus!" she exclaimed. "Is that what it is?" the little old man said, pleased. "I didn't know what it was. You can have it, if you want," he added. The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version "I want Alice and Dicky," Daphne wa[i]led, and she wept again. The little old man clicked his tongue again and put his hands back into his pockets. "Look", he said, "Look here what I found in the road this morning. I thought at first it was a leaf, but now I believe it's a dragon's scale or a roc's feather." Daphne looked at the leaf, and clapped her hands. In the old man's hand the leaf was white, but as soon as Daphne touched it, it began to turn blue. "You can have it, if you want," the little old man said. "Oh, thank you, thank you!" Daphne exclaimed, clutching the leaf tight in her palm. "And when we go on another picnic, we'll come for you," Daphne promised the little old man. "Thank you, thank you!" "I used to go to a sight of picnics," the little old man said, and the little old man's wife opened the kitchen door and glared at the little old man. "I want Alice and Dicky," Dulcie said, weeping again. The little old man clicked his tongue and put his hands in his pocket again. "Look here what I found in the road this morning. I thought at first it was a leaf, but now I believe it's a dragon's scale or a roc's feather." Dulcie looked at the leaf and clapped her hands. While the old man held it, it was not any color especially, just a faint pinkish greenish color. "You can have it, if you want," the little old man said. "Oh, thank you, thank you!" Dulcie exclaimed, grasping the leaf tight in her palm. "If we go on another picnic soon, we'll come for you," Dulcie promised. "Thank you, thank you!" "I used to be a great hand for picnics," the little old man said, and then his wife opened the kitchen door. "You, Egbert!" the little old man's wife shouted, and she glared at him again and slammed the door. The little old man caught up the axe again and began chopping wood furiously. "You, Egbert!" she shouted, and slammed the door again. The little old man caught up the axe and chopped wood furiously. "Now," said Daphne, clasping her blue leaf tightly and shutting her eyes, "I want to be where Dicky and Alice and Maurice and Alice's husband--------------" "Hello, Daphne, hello, Daphne!" they all shouted, and Daphne hugged Dicky and Alice, and Alice and Dicky hugged Daphne, and Alice's husband gashed his mouth from ear to ear until all his teeth shown, and the redheaded boy watched them with his queer yellowflecked eyes. "How did Dicky get big again?" Daphne asked. "Dat ole tramp los' his gillymus in one of de wrinkles in Exodus' hat, and Dicky foun' it for him," Alice explained, and Daphne hugged Alice and Dicky again, and Dicky and Alice hugged Daphne again. "Come on," the redheaded boy said. And they went on and passed from out the forest, into a valley. This was the valley through which, in the old days, young Sir Galwyn of Arthgyyl, with the green design called Hunger at his right hand and the red design called Pain at his left hand, had ridden. It was full of sweet odors, and gray, and presently they would reach a river; and they "Now," said Dulcie, clasping her blue leaf tightly in her hand and shutting her eyes, "I want to be where Dicky and Alice and Maurice and Exodus-----" "Hello, Dulcie, Hello, Dulcie!" They all cried, and Dulcie hugged Dicky and Alice, and Alice and Dicky hugged Dulcie, and Alice's husband gashed his mouth from ear to ear until all his teeth showed, and the redheaded boy watched them with his queer yellowflecked eyes. "How did Dicky get big again?" Dulcie asked. "Dat ole tramp los' his gillymus in one of de wrinkles in Exodus' hat, and Dicky foun' it for him," Alice explained. And Dulcie hugged Dicky and Alice again, and Alice and Dicky hugged Dulcie again. "Come on," the redheaded boy said. They were in a valley now, and pretty soon they would reach a river. The valley was full of sweet odors, and they walked on and soon they saw a tree covered with leaves of a thousand different colors. The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version went on and in a while they saw a tree covered with leaves of a thousand different colors. "It's the Wishing-Tree!" Daphne exclaimed. "I guess that's what it is," the redheaded boy agreed, but when they drew near the tree the leaves whirled up into the air and spun about it, and they saw that the tree was a tall old man with a long shining beard like silver, and that the leaves were birds of all kinds and colors. "Good morning, Father Francis," the redheaded boy said. "Good morning, Maurice," the good Saint Francis replied, and the colored birds spun and whirled and sang about his head. "This is Daphne, and Dicky, and Alice, and Alice's husband," the redheaded boy said. "We are looking for the Wishing-Tree," Daphne explained. The good Saint Francis looked at them, and his eyes twinkled. "And did you find it?" "We dont know," Daphne replied. "We thought perhaps this was it." The good Saint Francis thought a while, and the birds settled again about him like a colored cloud. Then he spoke, and once more the birds whirled up into the air and spun and sang around his head. "It's the Wishing Tree!" Dulcie exclaimed. "I guess that's what it is," the redheaded boy agreed, but when they got close to the tree the leaves flew up into the air and whirled about the tree, and then they saw that the tree was [a] tall old man with a long shining beard like silver, and the leaves were birds of all colors and kinds. "Good morning, Father Francis," the redheaded boy said. "Good morning, Maurice," the good Saint Francis replied, and the colored birds whirled and sang about him, lighting on his shoulders and head and arms. "This is Dulcie, and Dicky, and Alice and Alice's husband," the redheaded boy said. "We are looking for the Wishing Tree," Dulcie explained. The good Saint Francis looked at them and his eyes twinkled. "And did you find it?" "We dont know," Dulcie replied. "We thought perhaps this is it." The good Saint Francis thought a while, and the birds settled about him like a colored cloud. Then he spoke, and the birds whirled again into the air and spun around his head. "Didn't each of you pull a leaf from [a] white tree back yonder in the forests?" [i.e. forest?"] the good Saint Francis asked. "Yes, Father Francis." "Well, that was the Wishing-Tree. But suppose there are a thousand leaves on that tree, and a thousand boys and girls come along and pull a leaf off; when the next boy or girl comes to it, there wont be any leaves for them, will there?" "No, Father Francis." "So a wish you make this way, is a selfish wish, isn't it?" "Yes, Father Francis." "Then," the good Saint Francis said, "Let each of you give me the leaf you pulled from the Wishing-Tree so I can put them back, and instead I'll give each of you a bird. And a bird is better than a leaf, because if you'll feed it and care for it, you'll never make a selfish wish, because people who care for and protect helpless things can "Didn't you each pick a leaf from a tree back there in the forest?" the good Saint Francis asked. "Yes, Father Francis," Dulcie said. "Well, that was the Wishing Tree. But suppose there had been a thousand leaves on it, and a thousand boys and girls had each taken one, when the next one came along, there wouldn't be any leaf for him, would there?" "No, Father Francis," Dulcie said. "So a wish you make that way is a selfish wish, isn't it?" "Yes, Father Francis." "Then," the good Saint Francis said, "give me your leaves so I can put them back, and instead I'll give you each one of my birds. And if you'll feed it and care for it, you'll never make a selfish wish, because people [who] care for and protect helpless things cannot have selfish wishes. Will you do this?" The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version not have selfish wishes. Will you do this?" "Yes, Father Francis," they all answered. So they gave their leaves to the good Saint Francis, and the good Saint Francis took from beneath his gown four wicker cages, and he put a bluebird in a cage for Daphne, and an oriole in a cage for the redheaded boy, and he gave Alice a redbird, and to Dicky a little white bird with pale blue feathertips, because Dicky was little and because he was Daphne's brother. "What about Alice's husband?" Daphne asked. "He will help Alice take care of her redbird," the good Saint Francis replied, "Because if he leaves her again, he will be a selfish wisher and he wont deserve a bird." "And George?" Daphne asked. "Wishing is not good for George," the good Saint Francis replied. "The first wish George made, he made himself sick and was punished for it; the second wish he made, he frightened you all and himself too for no reason whatever; and the third wish he made, he deserted you when you were in trouble." "Yes, Father Francis," they all answered. So they gave the good Saint Francis their leaves, and in exchange he took from beneath his gown a wicker cage and he put a bluebird in it for Dulcie, and he took another cage and put an oriole in it for the redheaded boy, and he gave Alice a redbird, and to Dicky a little white bird with pale blue feathertips, because he was little and because he was Dulcie's brother. "What about Alice's husband?" Dulcie asked. "He will help Alice feed her redbird," the good Saint Francis replied. "Because if he leaves her again, he'll only be a selfish wisher." "And George?" Dulcie asked. "Wishing is not good for George," the good Saint Francis replied. "The first wish he made, he was punished for, the second wish he made, frightened you all for no reason whatever, and the third wish he made, he deserted you while you were in trouble." "But Mr. Egbert," Daphne said. "He deserves one, doesn't he?" "Ah," answered the good Saint Francis, "he already has more than I can give him: he is old, and so he no longer has any wishes at all. What became of him, by the way?" "His wife came and got him," Alice answered. "Then," the good Saint Francis said, "he doesn't even need anything else." He ceased speaking, and birds settled down again about his head and shoulders. "Goodbye, Father Francis," the [i.e. they] said. "And thank you." But the good Saint Francis only smiled at them from amid his birds, and they went on. They came to the bank of the river. But the funniest t[h]ing was, it wasn't a flat river, but it stood up on its edge, like a gray wall. "If that isn't the funniest thing!" Daphne said, because the river was like a mist, it was like the mist this morning had been, and in it she could see a dim thing like a street in a fog stretching on between rows of houses, and the mist smelled of wisteria. "But Mr Egbert," Dulcie said. "He deserves one, doesn't her [i.e. he]?" "Ah," answered the good Saint Francis, "he already has more than I can give him: he is old, and he no longer has any wishes at all. What became of him, by the way?" "His wife come and got him," Alice answered. "Then," the good Saint Francis said, "he doesn't even need anything else." He ceased to speak, and the birds settled down again about his head and shoulders. "Goodbye, Father Francis," they said. "And thank you." But the good Saint Francis only smiled at them from amid his birds, and they went on. They came to the bank of the river. But the funniest thing was, it wasn't a flat river, but it stood up on its edge, like a gray wall. "If that isn't the funniest thing!" Dulcie said, because the river was like the mist had been, and in it they could see a dim thing like a street stretching on between houses, straight in front of them, and the water smelled like wistaria. The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version "We'll have to go through it," the redheaded boy said. "Oh, but I'm afraid to," Daphne said, "Wait." But the redheaded boy had already stepped into it, and Alice and Dicky and Alice's husband followed him. "Wait!" called Daphne again, but they had passed into the mist and were only dim shapes fading on into the mist, and the redheaded boy turned his thin ugly face and his queer yellowflecked eyes, and his hair made a faint glow about them, and beckoned to her. "Wait," called Daphne a third time, and she too passed into the mist, carrying her bluebird in one hand and stretching the other before her, feeling her way. But the others had gone on and disappeared, and the glow of the redheaded boy's hair was gone too; and it was like she was in a round bowl, rising and rising through warm water like sleep, to the top. And then she would be awake. "We'll have to go through it," the redheaded boy said. "Oh, I'm afraid to," Dulcie said, "Wait." But the redheaded boy had already stepped into it, and Alice and Dicky and Alice's husband followed. "Wait!" called Dulcie again, but they were only dim shapes, and the redheaded boy turned his thin ugly face and his queer goldflecked eyes, while his hair made a little glow about him, and beckoned to her. "Wait," called Dulcie again, and she stepped into the mist too, and felt with her hands before her. But the others had disappeared ahead of her, and she could see only the faint glow of the redheaded boy's hair in the mist, and it was like she was in a round bowl of sleep, rising and rising through the warm waters of sleep, to the top. And then she would be awake. And she was awake, but she didn't open her eyes at once, and she lay there and her body and arms and legs tingled as though she had just eaten peppermint. What is it? she thought. What can it be? And she was awake, and it was like there was another little balloon inside her, getting bigger and bigger, making her body and arms and legs tingle as though she had just eaten a piece of peppermint. What is it? she thought, What can it be? "Birthday! Birthday!" cried a voice, and her eyes flew open, and there was Dicky jumping up and down on her bed, and leaning over her, her mother. Daphne's mother was awfully beautiful, so slim and tall, with her grave unhappy eyes changeable as seawater, and her slender hands that came so softly about you when you are [i.e. were] sick. "Look", her mother said, and she held out a wicker cage with a bluebird in it, and Daphne squealed with delight. "I wants a bird, mamma," Dicky chanted, "I wants a bird, mamma." "You can have half of mine, darling," Daphne said, and she let Dicky hold the cage and she closed her eyes again and her mother's hand came onto her face and smoothed the hair back from her brow, and she remembered the good Saint Francis, and Maurice with his queer eyes and his flaming hair, and Mr. Egbert and his gillypus; and dreams and birthdays seemed beautiful and sad to her, but being Daphne was beautifullest and saddest of all. Well, she still had her bluebird, even "Birthday, birthday!" cried a voice near her, and her eyes flew open, and there was Dicky jumping up and down on the bed beside her, and leaning over her was her mother. Dulcie's mother was beautiful, so slim and tall, with her grave unhappy eyes changeable as seawater and her slender hands that came so softly about you when you are [i.e. were] sick. "Look," her mother said, and she held out a wicker cage with a bluebird in it, and Dulcie squealed with delight. "I wants a bird, mamma," Dicky said, "I wants a bird, mamma." "You can have half of mine, darling," Dulcie said, and she let Dicky hold the cage, and she closed her eyes again and her mother's hand came on her forehead, and Dulcie remembered the good Saint Francis, and Maurice, with his queer eyes and his flaming hair. Well, she had her bluebird, even if it had been just a dream, and the good Saint Francis had said that if you were kind to helpless things, you dont need a Wishing Tree to make things come true. And next year she would have another birthday, and The "Brown/Stone" Version The "Victoria" Version if it had been all a dream; and the good Saint Francis had said that if you are kind to helpless creatures, you dont need a Wishing-Tree to make things come true. And next year she would have another birthday, and if she just remembered to get into bed left foot first and to turn the pillow over before she went to sleep, who knows [i.e. knew] what might happen? if she just remembered to get into bed left foot first and to turn the pillow over before she went to sleep, who knows [i.e. knew] what might happen? The following collation between the ribbon typescript transcribed above, which Faulkner gave to Philip Stone in 1948, and the carbon typescript he gave to Margaret Brown in 1927, lists only the substantive variants. The accidentals variants between the two typescripts, consisting predominately of typographical errors and inconsistent punctuation, have been omitted. For convenience, the substantive variants have been keyed to references signified by superior bracketed capital letters in the text. The reading to the left of the bracket is that of the "Brown" typescript: to the right the reading is that of the "Stone" typescript.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The booklet itself consists of front and back boards, covered in colored paper, with a blank sheet pasted down to the interior surface of each board. In addition, the front cover carries a paste-on paper label bearing in black ink Faulkner's hand-printed title, THE WISHING-TREE. The pages themselves, measuring evenly with the boards, 5½ by 6¾ inches, consist of a free-front endpaper with blank recto and verso, title page [i], verso of title page noting date, place and number of copies [ii], dedication page [iii], blank verso of dedication page [iv], pages "1-67," ["68"] running in correct paginated sequence the typed text, a blank facer to the last page of text ["69"], and a blank verso ["70"]. This gift booklet was placed on temporary deposit at the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia by Mrs. Victoria Fielden, its owner and copyright holder, and has been maintained there under that status at the expressed consent of Mrs. Fielden's daughter, Victoria F. Johnson, the legal holder of the copyright. I am indebted and grateful to Mrs. Johnson for allowing me the privilege of reprinting here for the first time this unexpurgated text of The Wishing Tree, and also for scrutinizing this Introduction and providing the following crucial revisionary factual information which I have excerpted from her June 30, 1984, letter to me and incorporated into this article: "My mother's name was Victoria de Graffenried Franklin, not Melvina V.! . . . She was born on Feb. 5 , not Feb. 8." In addition, I wish to express my gratitude to Professor Robert W. Hamblin, who read the introduction to this article and provided several major insights which I have incorporated into my fundamental thesis. Finally, to Fredson Bowers, I am immeasurably indebted for his editorial tutelage and concern for the presentation of this material. 2 The Wishing Tree . New York: Random House, [April 11] 1967. Illustrations by Don Bolognese. The limited and trade copies of this book are from the same printing. 3 This information has been gleaned from the Application for Copyright Registration for a Nondramatic Literary Work , Form TX, United States Copyright Office, Library of Congress, "Jan. 1980." 4 This carbon, typed manuscript of 47 pages is located at the University of Virginia, Alderman Library, and carries the accession number 9821. The typed page numbers run: "1-37," "39" ("38" has been entered in ink above the typed designation "39"), "39-47." The text is sequential and unbroken throughout. For the listing of this accession number and verification of the textual sequence and pagination, as well as for the information relevant to all referred to holdings at the University of Virginia, Alderman Library, I gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Edmund Berkeley, Jr., Curator of Manuscripts. 5 For this information, I am indebted to Professor James W. Silver, who, having had made available to him during the 1950's the diary of Calvin S. Brown, recorded this data from Dr. Brown's entry of February 11, 1927, on the cover sheet of a typescript he had had copied from the "Brown" typescript of The Wishing-Tree . Dr. Silver's copy resides in the Brodsky Collection. 6 See Louis Daniel Brodsky and Robert W. Hamblin, Faulkner: A Comprehensive Guide to the Brodsky Collection, Volume I: The Biobibliography (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1982), item 644. 7 Ibid. , item 663. I wish to extend my ongoing appreciation to Jill Faulkner Summers for consenting to let me make available to scholarship the text of this particular manuscript as well as all items in my Faulkner collection through publication of the Comprehensive Guide and, by extension, intervening scholarly publications that call attention to and which will subsequently be contained in the multi-volume Guide . 8 This carbon, typed manuscript of 44 consecutively numbered pages is located at the University of Virginia, Alderman Library, and carries the accession number 10,124-a. 9 Appearing on page [iii] of the "Victoria" typed booklet, this 5-line epigram which follows is introduced by the second of two dedications: To Victoria / ".......I have seen music, heard / Grave and windless bells; mine air / Hath verities of vernal leaf and bird. / Ah, let this fade; it doth and must; nor grieve, / Dream ever, thou; she ever young and fair." Except for a variation in the number of dots that follow the initial quotation marks (12 in the "Brown" version; 7 in the "Victoria" version), and in the "Victoria" version the substitution of a period at the end of line 3 for four dashes at the end of the same line in the "Brown" text, the first four lines are identical. Only the fifth, final lines are at variance. The last line of the "Brown" version reads: "Wish ever, thou; nor gain, but find it fair." 10 See Brodsky and Hamblin, Faulkner: A Comprehensive Guide to the Brodsky Collection, Volume I: The Biobibliography , item 1344; Princeton University Library Chronicle , 18 (Spring 1957). 11 See Louis Daniel Brodsky and Robert W. Hamblin, Faulkner: A Comprehensive Guide to the Brodsky Collection, Volume II: The Letters (1984), item 1412k. 12 Ibid. , item 1412i. Faulkner's response to Bennett Cerf has been excerpted from a letter Cerf sent to James W. Silver on November 17, 1959, in which Cerf included Faulkner's negative response to his publisher's inquiry regarding potential publication of the "Brown" copy of The Wishing-Tree . 13 Ibid. , item 1526a. 14 The 47-page ribbon typescript is located at the University of Virginia, Alderman Library, and carries the accession number 6074, item II:8.a. This typescript is identical to the carbon typescript Faulkner gave Margaret Brown in its pagination; like the latter, it carries numerous minor holographic ink corrections, though not all of the "Brown" version corrections. A second manifold carbon copy of this typescript ("Brown" version ribbon copy) is located at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin. It differs from the "Brown" 47-page ribbon and first carbon copies only to the extent that it exhibits no holographic corrections at all, and lacks pages "26," "27," and "37." In addition, in an unidentified hand (not Faulkner's), in pencil, there is a note at the top of page "1" which states: "Incomplete copy. Some pages omitted." For all information relative to this typescript, I am owing to the kind assistance of Cathy Henderson, Research Librarian, Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center. 15 Both ribbon and carbon copies of this 43-page typed manuscript are located at the University of Virginia, Alderman Library, and carry the accession numbers 6074-a, item IIB:8.b, and 6074-a, item IIB:8.b, respectively. On the ribbon copy, the pagination runs as follows: "1-23," "26" (the unit "6" has been written over in ink with the unit numeral "4," changing the number from "26" to "24."), (at this point, a break in the text occurs which corresponds to the text of "Brown" page "27"), "26-43." Although pages "26-43" are paginated sequentially, there is another text break, this one coming between pages "40" and "41," which corresponds textually to "Brown" page "44." The carbon copy is identical, except that page "10" is completely lacking; its carbon impression accidentally ended up on the verso of ribbon page "10." 16 The one exception relates to the vestigial paper label affixed to the cover: it presents a real enigma, in that its hand-lettered appearance more closely resembles the artistic lettering in india ink, with its characteristic reversed "S" letters, of The Marionettes (1920) and "The Lilacs" (1920) hand-made and hand-lettered booklets, than it does to his script dating from the mid-Twenties. Notwithstanding, Faulkner's typed title page, proclaiming in upper-case letters its unhyphenated title, and every subsequent reference to the "Wishing Tree" in the text, appear without a hyphen. 17 For an in-depth study of Faulkner's literary methods of revisionary refinement, see Louis Daniel Brodsky, "The Textual Development of William Faulkner's 'Wash': An Examination of Manuscripts in the Brodsky Collection." Studies in Bibliography , 37 (1984), 248-281. 18 The following brief collation keys the edited words that appeared in the Random House edition of The Wishing Tree to the words they replaced in the original "Victoria" typescript. To the left of the dividing half-bracket, by page and line (counting from the top) are the Random House corrections; to the right of the bracket appear the "Victoria" version words: p. 47-18: faraway] far away; p. 50-13: mantelpiece] mantel piece; p. 51-1: leapt] lept; p. 51-20: shone] shown; p. 69-18: gray] white; p. 70-16, 19, 20: ice cream] icecream; p. 70-18: gray] white; p. 71-12: ninetytwo] ninety two; p. 72-9: pockets] pocket; p. 81-13: were] are; p. [82]-5: are] were. 19 The following brief collation keys the altered or omitted words that appeared in the Random House edition of The Wishing Tree on the left of the dividing half-bracket to those which appeared in the "Victoria" typescript on the right side of the bracket. Reference to the Random House alterations is by page and line number, counting from the top, of the 1967 published text: p. 7-5: afterward] after; p. 29-1: hers] her's; p. 32-17: around] about; p. 32-2: Something] something: p. 42-5: "You..."] "You black nigger,"; p. 44-18: behime that tree."] behime that tree, nigger man."; p. 57-7: They all looked at] They looked at; p. 58-2: saw."] seen." * It should be pointed out that virtually this entire line of dialogue and the line immediately preceding it were accidentally reversed when Faulkner's eye skipped a line in recopying the "Brown" typescript, picked up and substituted from the line below the name "Dicky" for "George" along with his concluding speech. Faulkner failed to recognize and/or correct both the reversal of contextually logical sentence sequence and the misappropriation of the speaker's name in the second of the two lines. In "Brown", the lines read: "Mine! Mine!" George shouted. "First choice: I claim first choice!" "My pony! My pony!" Dicky shouted. "My first choss pony!" In "Stone", the lines read: "Mine! Mine!" Dicky shouted. "My first choss pony!" "My pony! My pony!" Dicky shouted. "First choice: I claim first choice!"</field>
