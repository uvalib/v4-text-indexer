      <field name="heading_text">Compositor Determination and other Problems in Shakespearian Texts by Alice Walker *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My aim in this paper is to suggest what purposes compositor determination may serve and, in view of these purposes, on what basis the analysis should be made. The focus will be on the thirty years or so in which our substantive texts of Shakespeare's plays were printed; but although the focus is on Shakespeare the matter is of interest to all concerned with printed books of the period, whether as bibliographers or editors. Very little is known about printing-house spelling. A philologist can, of course, relate spelling to the derivation of a word and to the sound changes, or other influences, which at one time or another have affected it. He knows why variant spellings like 'blood' and 'bloud' originated; but he does not know what their distribution is in this period. The O.E.D. is, of course, the main authority on the spelling of printed books; but although it gives a good general conspectus (though not always a complete record) or the range of spellings for a particular word, and although it sheds a great deal of light on what lies behind anomalies in modern spelling, it was no part of its programme to treat the subject either comprehensively or systematically: it is a history of the meaning of words, not their form. Thus, to take a simple example, it explains the origin of the spellings 'show' and 'shew' and remarks that the two spellings reflected different pronunciations originating in the Old English period and surviving (on the evidence of rhymes) down to about 1700 ; it observes that the 'shew' spelling was prevalent in the eighteenth century and not uncommon in the first half of the nineteenth century; but it sheds no light on the distribution of these two spellings in Shakespeare's day or on the distribution of the longer forms with a final 'e'. We cannot even be certain that the O.E.D. extracts from this period (however numerous they may be) necessarily give a just picture. The extracts cited were intended to illustrate meaning, not spelling: consequently, though most of the reading for the Modern English period was of printed books (not manuscript), some of the extracts were taken from modernised texts. Thus, after remarking that the present-day spelling 'blue' was hardly known in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the normal spelling was 'blew', it cites under 'blue-bottle' a modernised (quarto) spelling for 2 Henry IV , V.iv.20. The Folio spelling with 'blew' follows in parenthesis, but only because the Folio has the error 'blew- Bottel'd', not because Jaggard's spelling differed from that of Simmes's quarto. It is not, of course, surprising that no effort has been made to study the spelling of Elizabethan and Jacobean books systematically. This is partly because the view has been widely held that it was chaotic and, now that it is recognised that there was certainly method in its seeming vagaries and that investigation must proceed on the basis of compositors, it is clear that little good might have come of a survey even if it had been made. The natural line of attack in the past would have been chronological, by printers or by authors, and might therefore have failed to penetrate to the compositor-basis which is of prime importance. The subject has, anyway, not roused much interest. The phonologist recognises that it was mainly conventional spelling and out of touch with the spoken word. Consequently, it can tell him little about the pronunciation of Shakespeare's day. His attention is focused on the 'phonetic' spellings of uninstructed writers and, therefore, on manuscript spellings — and the naiver the writer, the better for his purpose. From a phonological point of view John of Bordeaux is far more exciting than the First Folio or even Sir Thomas More D . Among textual critics, though wiser heads have never supposed that the spelling of printed books was the author's (the Old Cambridge editors, for instance, rejected the idea of an old spelling Shakespeare on this account), there is even yet a great deal of muddled thinking. Spellings of one writer are compared with those of another on the evidence of printed texts of different dates from different printing houses 1 and the vagaries of compositors are being erratically introduced into modernised texts of Shakespeare . 2 A systematic study of printing-house spelling is plainly wanted, if only to act as a curb on this kind of folly. Unfortunately, Willoughby's interpretation of Satchell's observations on spellings in Macbeth was not at once followed up, but Hinman's reopening of the matter has stimulated keener interest. This is partly, no doubt, because of the close link between compositor-analysis and presswork, but partly too because it is now recognised that an analysis of the spelling of printed texts can shed a great deal of light on what has been the focal point of twentieth-century Shakespearian textual criticism — the problem of transmission; and that we know all too little about the stage in the transmission of substantive texts about which we could know most — their metamorphosis into print — is now, I think, generally recognised. The study of the ways of compositors should enable us to isolate with some confidence not only the accidentals of printed texts which were not due to copy but also (even more important) the substantive errors of compositors. The main purpose of compositor-determination as I see it is, therefore, to clarify a stage in transmission about which we know very little and ought to know more. But we shall be neglecting a great many important ramifications if the enquiry results in no more than a short list of words which serve to distinguish the hand of one compositor from another. This kind of rigidity is at variance with the fundamental characteristic of printing-house spelling — its fluidity — nd the treatment of the subject should partake of its character. Some habits of compositors were fixed (at any rate over a period of years) and these fixed habits included not only spellings which serve to differentiate between the hand of one compositor and a fellow-workman but also spellings which serve to bind. From The Merchant of Venice Q1 , Titus Andronicus Q2 , and Hamlet Q2 , for instance, it would appear that both of Roberts's compositors were 'doe', 'goe', 'heere', 'young', 'blood', 'devill', and 'yeere' spellers. At the same time, spellings common to a pair of compositors (or peculiar to one) were liable to alter, either temporarily (under the influence of copy) or more permanently (possibly in response to changing fashions). We cannot even treat the First Folio as a unit. My own differential spellings have special reference to the plays printed in 1623 Many of them (and certainly most of A's) are no use for the Comedies. Changes in habit can even be seen in the plays printed in 1623 In the Comedies printed (according to Willoughby ) in 1621 the capitalising of 'heaven' is erratic. In the plays printed in 1623 , A's practice (almost invariable) is to capitalise the word. B (almost invariably) uses a lower case letter until Macbeth . In this play and thereafter B's practice (though never so steady as A's) is to capitalise. Another change one can watch in progress is the spelling of 'prithee'. The usual spelling in the 1621 Comedies was 'prethee'. This holds for The Winter's Tale . In the Histories of 1623 there is much wavering and B's struggles to be off with the old love are interesting. It was plainly his intention to substitute 'prythee' for Q5 's 'prethee' in 1 Henry IV . He managed it on the first four occasions but succumbed to past habits and the influence of copy on all but two subsequent occasions and continued as a 'prethee' speller throughout 2 Henry IV . His new spelling comes to the fore in 3 Henry VI and Richard III , is established in Henry VIII , and never wavers in the Tragedies. Changes such as are apparent in the Folio are not, of course, exceptional. What serves to differentiate between two Danter compositors in 1593 is partly obsolete in 1594 What serves to discriminate between Roberts's two compositors in The Merchant of Venice 1600 is in some cases irrelevant to Hamlet 1604-1605 A pair of compositors might draw together over some spellings but apart over others, and how often their spelling changed in one particular or another is of as much importance as their fixed habits. My expectation is that, if a study of printing-house spelling could be made on a broad basis, including not merely what serves to distinguish between one compositor and another but also what serves to unify, as well as what is variable and what is fixed, we should have an instructive and serviceable conspectus of use to bibliographers and editors alike. For the analytical bibliographer, compositor-determination is plainly an important link with press-work and there is no need for me to enlarge upon the way in which the one kind of analysis is complementary to the other. As regards another field of bibliographical work, fuller information about compositors, if broadly based, should serve to identify printers, where other means fail, and to date (at any rate approximately) undated books and cancels. There are, for instance, a number of plays in Greg's Bibliography whose printers are either unknown or doubtful. These may have been written off as Lost Property merely because no one has had occasion to use them. They may even have been under scrutiny since the Bibliography was published. But assuming they have not yet been assigned to a particular printer, I judge that anyone acquainted with the spelling of Simmes's , Creede's , and Eld's compositors could determine, almost at a glance, to which of the three No. 242 (The Fair Maid of the Exchange , 1607) should be assigned, and similarly whether No. 278 ( Mustapha , 1609 was Windet's or not. In Lodge's Wounds of Civil War , printed by Danter in 1594 for instance, there are plainly two hands: the first characterised by the spellings 'prowd', 'young', 'friend', 'Romaine', 'sirra', 'powre', 'thrise', 'fruit' and 'poore'; the second by 'proud', 'yong', 'frend', 'Romane', 'sirrha', 'power', 'thrice', 'frute', and 'pore'. Both compositors were 'goe', 'here' spellers (firm Danter compositor characteristics in 1593-4) and other Danter texts exemplify the ending 'icke' as common ground during this period. Not all of these spellings are relevant to Romeo and Juliet Q1, printed in 1597 , but when we find that the first Romeo and Juliet compositor (A-D) was a 'goe', 'here', 'young' speller and the second (E-K) was a 'goe', 'yong', 'frend' speller we are on the way to establishing that Lodge's Wounds and Romeo and Juliet Q1 were set by the same pair of men. And when we find in Fair Em , assigned tentatively to Danter by Greg (on the evidence of an ornament), the characteristic 'goe', 'here', ' — icke', 'proud', 'power', 'yong' spellings of the second Wounds compositor, we can be reasonably certain that Danter was indeed the printer of this play. The quarto is undated, but the spelling places it (as the Malone Society editor did) before Jack Straw in 1593. Reprints are, of course, a trickier problem than first editions, since we must expect the trail to be confused by the spellings of the print used as copy. Roberts's reprint of Titus Andronicus certainly gives a much distorted picture of the habits of the compositors who set it and suggests that it may be little use to try to arrive at a compositor's normal practice from a reprint. This is, I judge, what makes it difficult to identify the compositor (or compositors) responsible for the Folio texts of Titus Andronicus and Romeo and Juliet . The spelling is mixed not because the compositor was a 'mixed' speller but because these texts (especially the latter) were hurried and careless reprints. 3 By far the most systematic spelling in the Folio Histories and Tragedies , on the part of both Jaggard A and B, occurs in plays which were certainly set up from manuscript. In 1 Henry VI , Julius Caesar , and Macbeth , for instance, spellings which fail to conform with the normal habits of the two compositors are strikingly rare. They are much commoner in Richard II , 1 Henry IV , and in the half dozen plays set up, I believe, from corrected quartos. It was, in fact, the somewhat 'mixed' spelling of 2 Henry IV , Hamlet , and Othello which partly led me in the first place to range them with Richard II , 1 Henry IV , Richard III , Lear , and Troilus and Cressida rather than with plays for which Jaggard must certainly have had manuscript copy. 4 In Troilus and Cressida for instance, Jaggard A seems to have abandoned most of his characteristic spellings in favour of Eld's . Possibly the mechanical reproduction of copy induced relaxation of effort in the interests of speed and what caused steadier spelling in setting from manuscript may have been the necessarily slower pace. 5 But although I suspect that reprints will seldom provide a safe- guide to a compositor's usual habits, the contamination from an earlier print that we should expect to find can be turned to advantage. I feel certain that, if a copy of Titus Q1 had never come to light, an analysis of the habits of Roberts's compositors when working from manuscript would have made it clear that the spelling of the 1600 quarto was too mixed to be that of a first edition and a legitimate inference would have been that some characteristic Roberts habits had been superimposed on an earlier print with 'here', 'yeare' and final ' — icke' spellings. It is easy, of course, to be wise after the event; but what can be established on the basis of this reprint and some Jaggard reprints might be applied to other texts which may be reprints of a lost predecessor. Is, for instance, the spelling of Love's Labour's Lost Q1 fully typical of White ? What about The Spanish Tragedy ( Greg , No. 110), Edward II (No. 129), David and Bethsabe (No. 160)? The need to know all we can about compositors' habits is manifestly of considerable importance to an editor. I do not for a moment suppose that increased knowledge will enable us to recover enough of Shakespeare's own spelling to transliterate substantive prints into that; nor, on the other hand, will it ever be possible to translate the vagaries of the early texts into a kind of standardised old spelling The former would be a mingle-mangle of spellings neither fully representative of Shakespeare nor of his compositors. The latter would be linguistic lunacy — much as if we were to devise a standard Middle English and re-write texts from different parts of the country and of different periods in terms of that. Only one standardisation is possible — full modernisation — nd for an old spelling text we must accept the spelling of Shakespeare's printers and explain their different conventions in terms of date and compositors in the way that Middle English texts are explained in terms of date, dialect, and scribes. For the rest, the most we can hope to recover from behind the veil of compositors' spellings is a clearer impression of the manuscript, or other copy, with a view to elucidating textual problems. How disruptive any tinkering with the accidentals of a copy-text would be is plain from the spellings of Sir Thomas More D. Even if we made the unlikely and unwarranted assumption that Shakespeare's spelling was much the same from the early 1590s to 1608 , we could not introduce 'yf', 'yt', 'coold', 'shoold', 'woold', 'ar', 'wer' into, for instance, Jaggard texts, nor break down Short's consistent 'sheriffe' spelling of 1 Henry IV , II.iv into the variable spellings of the More fragment. It is the old spelling editor who naturally most needs the kind of guidance which a survey of printing-house spelling will provide. It is obvious that when the Folio error 'Vassailes' (Antony and Cleopatra , I.iv.56) is emended to Pope's 'wassails', all that is wanted is the substitution of an initial W for the Folio's V. It is equally obvious that Hamlet Q2's 'lowlines' (III.i.46), to be corrected to the Folio's 'lonelinesse', requires no more than the substitution of 'ne' for 'w' and that it would be quite wrong to introduce the Folio's long termination into Roberts's text where short spellings in 'nes' are the rule. It may be less obvious that when the Folio's 'counsell' is supplied at III.ii.137 it must be altered to 'counsaile'. As our eyes get more critical of old spelling we shall find increasingly offensive anomalies like Duthie's 'Then prethee' in Lear , IV.i. This spelling (imported without alteration from the quarto) gives one a jolt as it has no business in any of the Tragedies set by Jaggard B. Nor is the Lear quarto's 'dearer' the correct emendation of the Folio 'deere' (III.v.24); since Jaggard B was a 'deere' speller, 'deerer' is wanted. To an eye trained to register the characteristic spellings of a compositor, errors sometimes acquire an added significance. In Romeo and Juliet Q2 (IV.i.83) the error 'chapels' (for 'chapless') is not a simple case of two letters having been accidentally transposed. The termination ' — lesse' is invariably used throughout this text. What the error signifies, therefore is that the compositor never intended to set up 'chaplesse' but misinterpreted as 'chapels' the spelling of his copy which must have had the short spelling 'chaples'. If the copy had had the long spelling the error would not have occurred. The correction of the error in an old spelling edition requires notwithstanding 'chaplesse', since the Old Spelling editor must emend in accordance with the compositor's normal practice. Similarly, Compositor A's error of 'Naples' (for 'napless') in Coriolanus , II.i.224, would probably not have occurred if the manuscript had had the long spelling. The error is best explained as due to the misinterpretation of a manuscript short spelling, which (if Jaggard A had understood it) would have appeared in the Folio as 'naplesse'. Again, if we accept the Folio correction of Q1's 'that accord' to 'it action' in Titus Andronicus V.ii.18, we must postulate that the quarto compositor misinterpreted 'yt' (for 'it') as the contraction. All the same, the text requires the 'it' spelling (not the postulated 'yt' of the copy) since 'yt' in Danter's quarto would be anomalous. Similarly, a number of Jaggard B's errors in Antony and Cleopatra , due to the misreading of final 'd' as 'e' (owing presumably to the absence of an apostrophe in his copy) require the apostrophe when the correction is made: 'dumbe' at I.v.50, for instance, should be corrected to 'dumb'd', since it was B's custom to use the apostrophe. 6 It is perhaps failure to recognise that an Old Spelling edition of Shakespeare requires primarily an understanding of the habits of compositors that encourages the idea that there is something peculiarly difficult about it. The only difficulty is that it is an expensive pastime — and I use the words 'expensive' and 'pastime' advisedly, because it demands freedom from all other responsibilities and consequently considerable independent means. So far as substantive readings go, the old spelling editor's task is no different from that of the editor of a modernised edition; and so far as old spelling is concerned, the problem is no different from that of editing any of Shakespeare's contemporaries whose works survive only (or mainly) in print. Consequently, attempts to penetrate to Shakespeare's own spelling (though important for the detection of errors in transmission) are irrelevant to the emendation in old spelling of an Old Spelling text; nor can they wisely be made until compositors' normalisations have been stripped from substantive quarto and Folio texts set from autograph. A. C. Partridge's recent inferences from Venus and Adonis and Lucrece exemplify, for instance, the wrong way of tackling the problem. 7 What we need to know is what the normal habits were of the compositor who set these prints and until these are known we cannot guess in what particulars he followed copy. As some of the above errors (like 'chapels' in Romeo and Juliet ) show, a consideration of a compositor's normal habits in relation to his errors will sometimes throw light on the features of his copy; but the most satisfactory evidence for the extent to which he followed copy will be found in prints set in conjunction with another workman or in reprints. Either will serve as a control, though the former is the better evidence for accidentals and the latter for substantive readings. In Hamlet Q2, for instance nearly all of the erroneous apostrophes occur in the work of one compositor and we cannot therefore suppose that these apostrophes were a feature of Roberts's manuscript. The same holds for the frequency with which erroneous apostrophes occur in the work of Jaggard B. There are no signs that he knew (or even tried to fathom) the difference between 'wert' and 'wer't', 'wast' and 'was't'. All the erroneous apostrophes in 3 Henry VI and Richard III , for instance, are in his stints and consequently the large number of erroneous apostrophes in Antony and Cleopatra which he set single-handed, were likely enough not in the copy at all any more than the apostrophe in 'dumb'd' (already mentioned). On the other hand, we must postulate, on the same evidence, that when anomalous apostrophes appear in the work of Jaggard A he followed copy. We may not always find the differences between a pair of compositors so marked as in the case of Jaggard A and B, but the differences may prove greater, when analyses have been made, than is immediately apparent. I have so far concentrated on spelling as a main clue to compositor determination. It is not, of course, necessarily the quickest and certainly not the only way in which we can determine where the stint of one workman ended and that of another began. Typographical evidence and presswork may sometimes provide a speedier or alternative means of determining whether more than one compositor was engaged on a print and may also assist in diagnosing the maladies of a text. But, whatever the means which best serve for differentiation, an analysis of spelling habits is none the less necessary if full use is to be made of the evidence which compositors provide for refining on what are, at present, often no more than generalisations about the transmission of Shakespeare's plays and for establishing the basis on which Old Spelling texts should be emended in the appropriate spelling. Anomalies representing manuscript spellings (or the spellings of other prints) will look as alien as words introduced into one Middle English text from another in a different dialect. And although I have kept the focus on spelling, all accidentals (especially grammar and punctuation) require analysis of the same kind. Very especially, work on a single text or a few texts is quite useless. A compositor's hand needs to be established in a sequence of printed texts before inferences can be drawn concerning his habits. Anyone who generalises about Jaggard A's habits from Troilus and Cressida will, for instance, get a sadly distorted impression of his normal spelling habits in the Histories and Tragedies. Few editors of Shakespeare are likely to be confronted with the specialised problems of old spelling, though it should be everyone's concern that the project of an old spelling edition is realised as quickly as possible. A definitive text is an idle fancy, except in so far as the facts about quarto and First Folio readings are concerned. In this respect, what McKerrow projected can be more definitive than he foresaw, since mechanical collation has since made possible what then seemed beyond attainment. But so far as certainty in emendation enters into the matter, we are almost as much in the dark as ever we were about substantive readings; and although more knowledge about compositors should make it clearer what kind of errors (and how many) they may have made, it will never locate the errors or emend them. What I judge from my own experience is most perplexing for the editor of Shakespeare is not general issues, like the choice of a copy-text or the authoritative text. Though problems remain (as in the case of Lear ), an editor has in most cases (as editors have always had) Hobson's choice. The teasing problems (and they occur by the hundred) are individual readings — whether emendation is necessary and, if so, how to emend. Was, for instance, Portia hedged by her father's 'wit' (as the quarto has it) or by his 'will' ? Were the sweet bells of Hamlet's reason out of 'time' or out of 'tune' ? Is Antigonus's threat to 'landdamne' the slanderer of Hermione right; if so, what does it mean and, if not, what should be substituted? These are still an editor's problems (as they always have been) and, whatever an editor's personal decision may be, there can mostly be nothing definitive about it; the verdict rests with the future. If the history of the editing of Shakespeare has anything to teach, it is that no editor (so far, of course, as we know) has always been right and that confidence that the text of Shakespeare (or even the text of a single play) has been 'settled' has quickly brought down Nemesis. It is, therefore, much to be hoped that no one will be encouraged to think that a definitive text is within the compass of a single edition. What is wanted from an old spelling edition is leadership — the application of the lessons that have been learnt in the present century, combined with recognition of what remains to be done and how to do it. Repeatedly making a fresh start is wastage of ground gained. Naturally, an old spelling edition twenty years hence should achieve more than McKerrow's could, but this is no argument for delay. On these grounds, it would be better to wait two hundred years for greater certainty. An Everyman Shakespeare would meet the needs. There is no need to be pompous about old spelling (which in many ways presents fewer difficulties than a modernised text) and, as we have old spelling in popular editions of Chaucer and Milton , there is nothing peculiar about an Old Spelling Shakespeare . What is wanted is merely an up-to-date text with the kind of definitive Folio line numbering McKerrow used. It is little use our longing for a more sensibly planned and up-to-date Concordance and a more critical Shakespeare Grammar so long as reference is tied to the line numbering of an antiquated edition. Every editor must have felt at times that undesirable and old-fashioned conventions in act, scene and line division (hampering as they are) must be preserved, in order to keep in line with out-of-date works of reference. I have so far dwelt at some length on two points. I have first emphasised the need for as broadly based an analysis of compositor's spellings as possible, in case it is not generally realised how little is known about printing-house spelling in Shakespeare's day (since its history has still to be written) and in the fear that, unless the problem is tackled comprehensively from the outset, much of the reading will need to be done again if the fullest possible use is to be made of the evidence — by bibliographers (in assigning and dating prints) and by editors (necessarily concerned in determining the characteristics of the copy which reached the printer). I have dwelt secondly on the importance of printing-house spelling for the Old Spelling editor, as this is the spelling in which emendations must be made and because there seems a persistent tendency to suppose that Shakespeare's own spelling and an Old Spelling Shakespeare are somehow more crucial problems than, say, Dekker's own spelling and an Old Spelling Dekker . There is no need for me to stress my third point — the need for compositor-determination as one means of assessing the number and kind of substantive errors a compositor may have made. This is all the more important in view of the mounting evidence that the reading of proof with copy was the exception and not the rule, at any rate with Shakespeare's plays. Where we have collateral texts, the traditional method has been to use the evidence of the one as a means of estimating the damage sustained by the other in the course of transmission. I believe the method to be sound, though one would naturally wish for as much objective evidence as possible to show at what stage in transmission and by whom the damage was done. Unfortunately, the text of most of Shakespeare's plays rests on a single authority. The only means of assessing their trustworthiness in the past has been an editor's literary taste and, however valuable this may be, everyone would prefer to have all possible objective evidence for the likely extent of corruption, its character and source. If the object of the twentieth-century emphasis on transmission is (as I take it to be) prompted by the determination to find out the facts, then compositor determination at once broadens the basis on which the enquiry can be made. We have, for instance, only one substantive text of Shakespeare's plays printed by Eld ; but Eld was an active printer of plays, and by reference to other plays set by the two compositors concerned in the Troilus and Cressida quarto we should be able to eliminate much hazardous speculation about Eld's manuscript. In the case of Shakespeare's plays the maximum demand will always be for modernised texts and the reliability of substantive readings is, therefore, every editor's concern. What I have said about compositors must obviously affect, both now and in the future, the editing of nearly all Elizabethan and Jacobean writers. No one concerned with printed books of the period can remain entirely aloof, though editors concerned with dramatic texts, by reason of the varied channels through which copy reached the printer, have perhaps most to gain by taking a cross-section of Elizabethan and Jacobean works on the compositor basis. The task is one, in the initial stages at least, for the analytical bibliographer, who is fortunate in being able to apply bibliographical techniques which are complementary to compositor-identification on the basis of spelling. 8 We need, in fact, in conjunction with a conspectus of printing-house spelling, a press-work analysis of Shakespearian substantive texts. The only way of tackling the problem of spelling is, of course, chronologically and by printers, on the compositor basis, and the task may not prove as arduous as might be supposed if compositors hung together over long periods, like Danter's two compositors or Roberts's . Prints of plays are obviously a good starting point by reason of the fact that many were printed from unsophisticated copy and that spelling runs truer to type in verse than in prose. Given the material on which to work, two or three could cover the dramatic field in a year. What takes longer than compositor-determination on the basis of spelling is the assessment of the quality of the work, especially in cases where texts have never been edited or have been edited uncritically. Here, at any rate, the editor of Shakespeare has no lack of material on which to draw.</field>

It is the general policy of the new series 'to preserve all older forms that are more than variant spellings' — policy which has not I suspect, been seen in relation to its logical linguistic conclusions. When Muir , for instance, in the New Arden Lear , followed the Folio's 'murther', what was he reproducing — the compositor's spelling or a scribal alteration of the Q1 spelling on the authority of the Lear prompt-book? If it was the prompt-book spelling, was it Shakespeare's ? Further, if consonant variants, like 'murther' and 'vild', are preserved, why not the vowel variants in 'show' and 'shew 'blood' and 'bloud'? Why not the commoner 'alablaster' or 'abhominable' and (contrariwise), in early texts, 'clime' for 'climb' or 'limmes' for 'limbs'? Muir went so far as to reproduce Compositor B's arbitrary distinctions between — 'd and — ed of weak preterites and past participles in prose. But what will happen in the New Arden As You Like It where there are two compositors favouring different conventions? Modern English is one thing; the habits of the compositors of Shakespearian texts are quite another, and the arbitrary preservation of a selection of the latter has no linguistic principles behind it. 3 I do not, of course, rule out the possibility that we have in the Tragedies reprints (as here and there in the Comedies reprints) a third hand. What I suspect is that, if we have a third hand in these Folio reprints, we cannot isolate his normal habits from the influence of printed copy any more than we could isolate the normal habits of Roberts's compositors from Titus Q2. What is wanted, in order to determine how many compositors Jaggard employed, is a survey of all Jaggard prints between (say) 1619 and 1624 with special emphasis on works set up from manuscript. 4 That is, I believe the disturbing factor to have been printed copy. So far as my observations go, spelling tended to become progressively more mixed the oftener a text was reprinted. I am sceptical of attempts to explain mixed characteristics as due to transcription of the quartos. Jaggard's manuscript copy must have been very diverse. How came it then that transcripts of quartos were singled out for different treatment from other manuscripts ? And if a third hand was responsible for the mixed spelling of these texts, how chanced it he was not employed in the Histories and Tragedies which were certainly set from manuscript? None of these are in mixed spelling. 5 Roberts Y's work in Titus Q2 provides a parallel. In view of the fact that a compositor's spelling habits were not static and that some spellings must always have been more a matter of habit than others, we cannot assume that systematic changes were made with equal facility. Under stress, only spellings which were second nature may have been used at all systematically. 6 There are oversights, of course, in B's use of the apostrophe, which an editor should not normalise. A compositor's substantive errors, that is, should be corrected in the light of his normal habits, but this is no reason for all-out standardisation of what was variable in accidentals. 7 In Shakespeare Survey , VII (1954), 35 et seq. Inferences are drawn from the two Field prints and a selection of early quartos of the plays, without any investigation of the normal habits of the compositors who set them. 8 The one will often assist, or refine upon, the other. After a spelling analysis has been made, it may sometimes prove far from clear which variations are significant. Fredson Bowers's account of the Hamlet Q2 's running-title evidence, for instance, at once revealed to me which variants in spelling were important and which were of no account. On the other hand, as has been shown elsewhere in this volume with reference to L4v of Roberts's quarto, spelling tests may be necessary to refine on typographical evidence. In my experience, difficulties with compositors mostly occur when too limited a range of spelling tests is used or when 'block' spellings obscure some difference in the spelling of a particular word within the group. These last should be used with the greatest caution. Recognition of what is significant depends, I think, mainly on observation, and the following spellings, additional to those earlier listed on p. 9 of Textual Problems of the First Folio , materially assist in distinguishing the hand of Jaggard A from that of Jaggard B in the Histories and Tragedies. They should be amalgamated with those presented by Cauthen in an earlier volume of Studies in Bibliography . The combined lists will be far from complete, as I have no doubt that those who have repeatedly read these plays will be able to add others. A B --- --- madame madam wee'le (etc.) wee'l (etc.) prowd proud ta'ne tane ougly vgly widowe widdow honie hony Heauen heauen I include the last with the reservation mentioned earlier in this article. Though it is sometimes difficult to discriminate between the one hand and the other in prose if there is much justification of lines by spelling, there is usually something within the orbit of a particular text to assist: in Coriolanus for instance, there is A's 'Scicinius' (except at the foot of 8b a column set by B) or 'toth' (as one word). The important thing to remember, in connection with A's habits, is that he was systematic This comes out in his analytical use of italics (very noticeable in Richard II and 1 Henry IV ) in contrast with B's more erratic ways. He could normally maintain a system and I have no doubt that if A had decided to turn every tenth 'e' he could have held his head to the business.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Compositors of Hamlet Q2 and The Merchant of Venice by John Russell Brown *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In The Manuscript of Shakespeare's Hamlet (1934), Professor J. Dover Wilson made one of the first attempts to analyse the habits of a compositor in an Elizabethan printing house, and his conclusion was that James Roberts employed a bungling and inexperienced workman for the 1604/5 Hamlet . The picture Professor Wilson drew of this compositor was detailed and paradoxical. He was a novice and, left to himself, would have worked letter by letter, reproducing the spellings of his copy, but he was rushed in his work, and sometimes omitted lines, half-lines, phrases, words, or letters. In moments of confidence, he abandoned his plodding method and let his eye 'race ahead of his fingers,' so that he might transpose a word in error from the end to the beginning of a line. This picture of Roberts' compositor has been generally accepted and has greatly influenced the repute of the second quarto of Hamlet ; Sir Walter Greg thought it "was printed from Shakespeare's autograph copy, though there was little that was foul about it and the chief trouble is the incompetence of the printing." 1 Since Professor Wilson's early study, other techniques have been developed in order to trace the work of compositors. The acquisition of these techniques has been recorded in the pages of The Library and Studies in Bibliography , and the first large scale application of them has appeared in Dr. Alice Walker's Textual Problems of the First Folio (1953). The trail has been clearly blazed: editors of Elizabethan texts should no longer speak vaguely of compositorial error or sophistication. Many old textual problems now need to be re-examined, and among them is the nature of the copy for Q2 Hamlet (1604/5). This paper is a beginning of this reexamination; it presents evidence for believing that two compositors were responsible for Hamlet , the same two who shared the work for The Merchant of Venice which was printed by Roberts for Thomas Hayes in 1600.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Professor Fredson Bowers has already questioned whether Q2 Hamlet was set by one compositor who was rushed in his work. From a preliminary analysis of skeleton-formes used for this quarto, he has shown that Sheets B, C, and D were imposed with a set of two skeletons for each sheet, this being a pattern customarily adopted when the compositor was comfortably ahead of the press. With sheet E two more skeletons were constructed, oddly enough, and thereafter the first set continues with sheets F and I while the new set imposes sheets G, H, K, and L. With sheets M, N, and O there is a curious mixture of the sets. This evidence suggests that composition speed was ahead of press speed, and there is even a question as to whether two presses were operating, in which case there must have been two compositors. 2 Later, he was more definite: "This general alternation involving the use of four skeleton-formes is inexplicable for printing with one press; yet if we hypothecate two presses it follows that there must have been more than one compositor." 3 Fortunately, the evidence for two compositors suggested by the presswork can be made specific from the results of a spelling test. The work of these two men is distinguished by the following spellings: Compositor X . Compositor Y . their theyr/their deare, dearely, etc . deere, deerely, etc . sweete sweet farwell farewell sayd(e), etc . said(e), etc . houre(s) howre(s) madam(e) maddam(e) being beeing receaue, receaued, perceaue, etc . receiue, receiued, perceiue, etc . honor(s), honor'd, dishonor, etc . honour(s), honour'd, dishonour, etc . mooue, mooued, prooue, etc . moue, moued, proued, etc . sodaine suddaine choise choice reuendge, reuendgeful, etc .(There are 3 Y forms in Act I) reuenge, reuengeful, etc . In addition, words which in modern English terminate in - consonant + ow and - consonant + ew and are pronounced similarly to know and knew , are spelt by Y, almost exclusively, - ow and - ew , whereas X has a large number of - owe and - ewe forms. The evidence may be tabulated; and from the evidence of these tables, it appears that the two compositors divided the work as follows: Compositor X B1-D4 v ,F1-4 v ,I1-4 v , L1,L4 v ,N1-O2 Compositor Y E1-4 v ,G1-H4 v ,K1-4 v ,L1 v -4,M1-4 v It is noteworthy that Y started work when the new skeletons were constructed. The evidence is reasonably clear except for H3 v , L1, and N1-1 v . Some further spellings support these allocations. It is probably safe to assume that H3 v was set by Y because the form 'musique', occurring twice, is only found elsewhere on E2 and H4 (twice), both Y pages; 'musickt' is also found on a Y page (G3), but 'musicke' is restricted to I4 and O2 pages set by X. The allocation of N1 and 1 v is uncertain because 'their' was set by both X and Y, and the houre / howre distinction is not very clear. Here the spelling leasure helps; it is found on D1 (set by X), N1 v (twice) and N2, and in Roberts' 1600 quarto of The Merchant of Venice which was probably set by the same two compositors as his Hamlet , this is characteristic of X, Y using the form leysure . 4 The allocation of L1 is the most difficult of all; with L4 v , it is an exception to the division of the work by sheets, 5 and deare is the only word on it which is usually significant. 6 But there is further support for the X allocation in 'noise' which occurs twice on this page, whereas on the one immediately following (L1 v ) 'noyse' is found twice. Elsewhere in the play, 'noise' is only found on pages set by X ( viz . I2 v , and O1 v ), whereas 'noyse' is found only on pages set by Y ( viz . G4, K1 v and M1). Noise / noyse strengthens the case sufficiently to justify assigning L1 to X on the basis of the available evidence. The evidence of the spellings for Hamlet becomes more impressive when similar tests are applied to The Merchant of Venice quarto of 1600 Here again, there is evidence of more than one set of skeletons. The verso running-title ' The comicall Historie of ' is sometimes approximately 4.4 cms. in length and sometimes approximately 4.6 or 4.7. The two lengths alternate regularly: short running-title A2 v :-B4 v ,D1 v -4 v ,F1 v -4 v , H1 v -4 v ,and K1 v . long running-tide C1 v -4 v ,E1 v -4 v ,G1 v -4 v ,and I1 v -4 v . This alternation is reflected in the spelling tests, which show that the following forms are again significant: Compositor X . Compositor Y . their theyr/their deare deere farwell farewell sayd(e), etc . said(e), etc . houre(s) howre(s) madam(e) maddam(e) being beeing sodainly suddainely This is a shorter list than for Hamlet : the mooue / moue distinction, by no means constant in Hamlet , does not hold for The Merchant ; the Y form of receaue / receiue etc. is not found; the X form of honor / honour etc. occurs only twice, once on a page set by Y (F2 v ); and of reuendge / reuenge etc., only the Y form is found-on two pages set by X (E2 v [twice] and E3). While X again used choice , Y used the form choyse. The - owe ,- ewe / - ow ,- ew distinction is irregular: it works almost perfectly for the often recurring word Jew but for other words, the Y forms predominate, - owe or - ewe being found only 7 times on pages set by X, and 5 times on pages set by Y. Similarly, the Y form sweet is often found but X's sweete four times only, thrice on pages set by X and once on a page set by Y. In addition to the spellings significant in Hamlet , X set leasure(s) where Y set leysure(s) . The form Ile is found throughout, but on pages set by X ile is often found. This last peculiarity is probably due to a shortage of capitals which is a noticeable feature of the quarto, verse lines frequently beginning with lower case letters. 7 The evidence is as follows: For The Merchant of Venice there is further evidence: (1) Compositor X normally set the whole of the entry directions in italic type, while Y used italic only for proper names, setting the rest in Roman, and (2) Compositor Y occasionally indented single lines, or parts of lines. These peculiarities reinforce the spelling tests: X-italic type only C1,1 v ,3 v , 4,4 v ,E1&amp; v ,2,3 v ,G1 v , 2,3,4 v , and I1,1 v ,2,3,3 v . Y-Roman type except for proper names A2,2 v ,4 v ,B2,2 v ,4&amp; v ,D1, 1 v 2,2 v ,3 v ,4 v ,F2 v ,4,4 v ,and H1. On C2 v , C4, and E2 v there are entry directions with proper names in Roman and the rest in italic type. Y-indented lines A2,4 v ,B2,3 v ,4,D1,1 v ,4,E2 v , and F4,4 v . The indentation of the last line on E2 v is the only detail of this bibliographical evidence which breaks a regular alternation. It seems safe to assume, on the accumulated evidence of running-titles, spellings, entry directions, and indentations, that the work was divided between the two compositors as follows: Compositor X A1(title-page),C1-4 v ,E1-4 v ,G1-4 v , and I1-K2. Compositor Y A2-B4 v ,D1-4 v ,F1-4 v , and H1-4 v . A1 seems to be the only page about which there can be any doubt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Once it is accepted that the same two compositors set Q2 Hamlet (1604/5) and The Merchant of Venice (1600), certain theories about the text of the former must be examined afresh: can it still be said that the 'chief trouble' is incompetent printing? Certainly it is no longer possible to blame an 'untutored dolt' for any of its short-comings, for The Merchant is a remarkably clean text throughout. It would seem that either these workmen were abnormally rushed while setting Hamlet -for which no certain evidence is yet known-or else their copy was abnormally illegible. Before accepting either of these explanations, much more must be known about the printing of the quarto: its imperfections must be reexamined and their distribution studied, the press-work must be considered, and a more detailed knowledge about Roberts' printing house must be acquired. In the meantime, the text of Hamlet must be treated with added caution. For example, Professor Wilson thought that a considerable number of half- lines, phrases, and words found in the Folio text (generally thought to derive from a prompt-book), 8 and not found in Q2, had been present in the copy for Q2 but had been omitted through the incompetence of the compositor. 9 Professor Wilson's 'omissions' are from pages set by both compositors, neither of whom is known to have skipped numerous lines and words in other work. Until it is proved that they were both guilty of such incompetence, or that they were rushed in setting Q2 Hamlet , we must presume that they were both defeated by a peculiar illegibility of their copy, or else that the Folio Hamlet contains additions to Shakespeare's original foul papers. A glance at Professor Wilson's lists of 'omissions' will show how likely the latter explanation is; few of them contain any hard words which do not occur in neighbouring lines, and many of them involve mere repetition or the addition of particles. In the present state of knowledge, it seems possible that the 'omissions,' accepted as authoritative by Professor Wilson, have no stronger authority than that of a scribe or the players' prompt-book. New knowledge about the compositors responsible for these two quartos will also illuminate the problem of the copy used for The Merchant of Venice . It is usually argued that this copy was closely related to Shakespeare's foul papers or autograph manuscript. 10 Obviously it cannot have been 'foul' to the same degree as the copy used for Hamlet and some other plays, and it is therefore risky to claim that it was in fact Shakespeare's autograph copy. But if the same compositors set both Hamlet and The Merchant and if we are agreed that the copy for Hamlet was autograph, it should be possible to compare the accidentals of the two texts and come to a more definite opinion about the copy for The Merchant . First of all, it will be necessary to know how much the compositors habitually altered the spelling and punctuation of their copies, and what spellings are normal in texts of their composition. To get this information we must examine other books printed by Roberts about the same time as Hamlet and The Merchant .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The choice of books for comparison is not easy, for the practice of compositors certainly altered with varying circumstances. We have seen how a shortage of capitals probably led to the recurrence of a form in The Merchant which is not found in Hamlet , and we must presume that the fount of type with which they were working might have predisposed compositors in favour of certain forms. For our purposes, therefore, books printed in the same type as the two quartos (Roman '82') will be especially valuable. The spelling of their copy was perhaps the largest single factor which affected the work of compositors. We can check this, to some extent, by examining books reprinted from earlier editions which came from other printing houses, but the check is not fully adequate, for compositors could work far more rapidly from a printed text than from a manuscript and this inevitably affected their faithfulness to copy. Likewise, the legibility of manuscript copy would influence the speed and workmanship of compositors, and we have little hope of making any satisfactory allowance for this. Another factor is the amounts of prose and verse in a book; compositors sometimes departed from their normal spellings and punctuation in order to justify a line, and there would be a greater tendency to do this in a prose work than in a verse one. The format of a book might similarly influence their work; a duodecimo book in prose might present justifying difficulties every half dozen words or so. Over and above these factors, there must be the human factor; a compositor might favour one spelling for a year, or perhaps for only a few days, or he might have to work for a short time in a bad light, or be rushed in his work. The study of compositorial habits is obviously full of difficulties, but nevertheless it is possible, at this early stage, to present some kind of answer to our enquiry and thereby add to our knowledge of the two Shakespeare texts. I have chosen to examine books which represent most of the different circumstances which I have just described in the hope that something may emerge about the wider problems involved in the study of compositorial habits. The most interesting evidence comes from James Roberts' reprint of Titus Andronicus for Edward White in 1600 The previous edition was by John Danter in 1594 and in this first quarto the following spellings predominate: -ow , -ew, their, deare, farewell, said, houre, being, honour, moue, reuenge, Ile. In the Roberts reprint, farewell, said, and reuenge were not altered, but sometimes the others were, as follows: -ow, -ew became -owe, -ewe B2,D3 v ,I2 v . their became theyr A1,2,4(3),4 v ,D1(2),E1(2),1 v ,F1 v (2), 2,4 v ,G1 v (2),I1,1 v (3), 4 v (3),K1,1 v (3),2 v . deare, etc. became deere, etc. A4(2),C1,D2,E2 v ,3 v (2),4,F1,1 v , 2,I1 v ,K1,2 v . being became beeing D1 v . honour, etc. became honor, etc. A2,B1,1 v ,2. moue, etc. became mooue , etc. B4 v ,D2 v . Ile became ile D3,E3,4 v ,I3(2),3 v . A few irregular forms were changed: -owe , -ewe became -ow , -ew D4,F3,G4 v ,I1 v ,2 v . howres became houres C4 v . honorable became honourable K2. mooued became moued F1 v . ile became I'le I1. Danter's first quarto varied the following forms: sweete/sweet , madam/ maddam, receaue/receiue , sodaine/suddaine , and choise/choice/choyse. The Roberts reprint sometimes altered these, as follows: sweete became sweet A3 v ,4,B2 v ,4,C1 v (2), D1(2),E2 v , 3 v (2),4,F1,G2,H2,3,I3 v ,K1. maddam(e) became madam(e) D1(2),2 v ,F3,I4 v . receiue, etc. became receaue, etc. E3,I2 v . choise became choyse F3 v . In addition to these spelling changes (which Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice suggest may be significant), this was changed to thys on C1 v (2),2(2),3 v ,F4(2), and I1 v . From this evidence, it would seem that the two compositors who set Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice also set Titus Andronicus, and certain pages can be allocated to each: Compositor X B1,1 v ,2,4 v ,C4 v ,D2&amp; v ,3,3 v ,E3,4 v ,F3, I2 v ,3,3 v . Compositor Y A1,2,3 v ,4,4 v ,B2 v ,4, C1,1 v ,2,3 v ,D1, 1 v ,2,4,E1,1 v ,2 v ,3&amp; v ,4,F1,1 v ,2,3 v ,4,4 v , G1 v ,2,4 v ,H2,3,I1,1 v , 4 v ,K1,1 v ,2,2 v . Very few details conflict with this allocation: X's honorable replaced Y's form on A2, but the honor/honour distinction does not hold for The Merchant, and in Hamlet, X's -or form is sometimes found on pages set by Y; X's madam replaced maddam on D1(2) and I4 v which were both set by Y, but there are a few irregularities in the madam/maddam distinction in both Hamlet and The Merchant; Y's -ow, -ew forms replaced X's - owe, -ewe on F3 and I2 v and sweet replaced sweete on I3 v , but the shorter forms are often found on X's pages, especially in The Merchant. The allocation of pages A3 v B2 v , 4, D4, F3, G2,4 v , and H2,3 must be considered doubtful, for they rely on -ow, -ew, sweet, or madam spellings which are not entirely trustworthy. Judging from Titus Andronicus it would seem that if Compositor X found -ow and -ew in his copy he did not often bother to change them to the -owe and -ewe forms. Nor did he always change honour to honor, and moue to mooue. He did not once change farewell to farwell, reuenge to reuendge, or sweet to sweete. Compositor Y did not change houre to howre and was not consistent in changing being to beeing, their to theyr, and madam to maddam. Both compositors sometimes changed sweete to sweet and -owe, -ewe to - ow, -ew, and both sometimes retained uncharacteristic forms of receaue/receiue, etc. These tendencies help to divide other books between the two compositors. Samuel Harsnet's A Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures (1603) is in Roman '82', the type used for the three Shakespeare quartos. 11 It is a quarto of prose with 36 gatherings, not counting signature A which contains preliminary matter in italic type. The copy for this book probably had very few, or no, -owe, -ewe or sweete forms; I have noted only 5 -owe or -ewe forms (B3 v , N2 v , T2, V1, &amp; Dd3) and two sweetes (E3 &amp; R4 v ). Similarly I have noted honor only once (R2), deare once (L2 v ), and sayd eight times (Q1, T4 v , V2,4 v , Y3 v , Dd1 v , &amp; Ll3 v ); in each case the Y forms predominate and probably did so in the copy. I have not found ile, farewell or farwell, madam or maddam, leisure or leasure; houre is infrequent and invariable; thys I found once (M1) and reuenge once (L1); choise and choyse I found twice each (C3, M2 &amp; G1 v , R1), and choice once (Aa1). The work of the two compositors is distinguished by their/theyr, receaue/receiue etc., being/beeing, sodaine/suddaine, and, less reliably, mooue/moue etc. The following pages may be allocated with some confidence: Compositor X C3,3 v ,D2 v ,El-3 v ,F4- G2,H2 v - 3 v ,I3 v -K1,L2,2 v ,M1 v ,2,3,Q4,R2,4 v ,T1 v , 2,4,X2,Z1 v ,Aa3,3 v ,Bb3 v ,4,Cc2 v - 4,Dd2 v ,3,Ee2 v - 4,Ff4,4 v ,Hh3,3 v ,Kk2,2 v ,3 v ,Ll3 v - 4 v ,Mm2,Nn3, 3 v , Compositor Y B1 v -C2 v ,C4 v -D1&amp; v ,D3- 4 v ,E4,4 v , F1 v -3 v ,G3 v -H1 v ,H4 v - I3,K2 v -L1,L3-M1,M4-N1 v , N2 v ,N3 v -O1 v ,O4,4 v ,P2,3 v ,Q1 v -3 v ,R2 v -4, S2 v ,3 v ,4,T2 v ,3,4&amp; v ,V1 v ,V3- X1,X4,4 v ,Y2-4 v , Aa1,1 v ,Aa4 v -Bb2 v ,Cc1-2,Dd1 v ,Dd4-Ee2,Ff1 v ,Ff2 v -3 v ,Gg2 v ,3,Gg4-Hh2 v ,Ii4-Kk1 v ,Kk4-Ll2 v ,Mm1,3,Mm4 v - Nn2 v ,Nn4,4 v . Again only a few of the distinctions noticed in Hamlet and The Merchant are significant in A. Warren's The Poor Man's Passions (1605). This is a quarto of verse, so the use of the longer forms would not be greatly influenced by the need to justify. Once more, the copy probably had few -owe or -ewe forms, for these occur in the printed book only on B1,4 v , D3, E3 and F1. It might, however, have read sweete a number of times; I have found it 5 times (C1 v , E2, F2 v , &amp; G1,1 v ) but sweet only 3 times (C1 v , 3, &amp; H4). Honour, houre, choise, and farewell are invariable, while reuenge, said, suddaine and leasure occur only once each (G3 v , I1 v G4 v , &amp; C2). I found being on I2 and beeing on G4; deere is on G4 v and deare on D3 v , E1, H3 v (2), and K1; both the mooue and moue forms are found throughout. It is chiefly through the their/theyr distinction that the book can be divided between the two compositors. Their is found throughout, but theyr only seven times on G4(2),4 v (3)and I4 v (2). These spellings, together with the deere, beeing, reuenge, said and suddaine already noticed, and the absence of - owe or -ewe forms from sheets G and I, suggest that the whole book may have been set by Compositor X, with the exception of parts of sheets G and I which were probably set by Y. The copy for G. Estie's A Most Sweet and Comfortable Exposition upon the Ten Commandments and upon the 51 Psalm (1602) almost certainly had a preponderance of -ewe and -owe spellings. It is a small octavo of prose with a comparatively large type, so that there are only a few words to each line, and justifying must have been a frequently recurring difficulty. Again Y's theyr spellings are especially significant: their is found throughout the book, but theyr occurs some 41 times up to K2 v and thereafter is not found at all. There is a sprinkling of X's -owe, -ewe spellings from the first (I have noted them on B3, 4 v , C3 v ,6,6 v , D3 v ,7, E7, F1(2), H1 v ,2,3 v ,7, &amp; K4 v ), but since Y's distinctive theyr is also found on many of these pages, the longer form has probably been retained to help justification. Again, a change comes at sheet L in which I have noted only 2 - ows or -ews but a cluster of longer X spellings (on L3,3 v ,4(3), &amp; 6). On sheet M there are a further 7 X spellings (on M1,1 v ,2,4,5 v (2), &amp; 8 v ). There are only 7 of these spellings in the remaining 6 sheets, but since there is no recurrence of Y's theyr, X is probably still responsible but has used the shorter form occasionally to accommodate the text to the short lines. It is noteworthy that the pages are signed 1 to 3 up to and including sheet K, L is signed 1 to 5, and the following ones, 1 to 4. Moreover other spellings suggest that X took over the composition from Y at L1; suddaine etc. is found on D3 and sodaine etc. on M2 v ,8, and O7; deere is found on A5 and deare on M2 ; choyse is found on D2 only; thys is found on A2 v (2),4 v , E3, G1, and K1,7 only; sweete and sweet are both found up to F7, thereafter the word occurs only once, on S4 in the X form. There are some anomalies: reuenge occurs infrequently but is invariable; Y's honour is the normal form occurring on L1 v and following pages, and X's honor is found on N7 v and O8 only; said occurs throughout and X's sayd on A5 v and N8 v , the former having a theyr characteristic of Y; the receaue/receiue distinction does not hold (the X form occurs up to Is only) nor does the less frequent mooue/moue. These irregularities need not greatly influence the allocation of pages between X and Y; neither receaue/receiue nor mooue/moue held for The Merchant, which is fairly close to this book in date, and the conservatism of both compositors as demonstrated in Titus Andronicus sufficiently explains the rest. Y probably set up to the end of sheet K of Estie's Exposition, and X the remainder. H. Smith's Four Sermons (1602) is a quarto in eights written in prose and therefore with a recurrent need to justify. The allocation of work between the two compositors seems to be complicated, but Compositor Y probably set most of the pages of signature A, and Compositor X most of those of signature B. The significant spellings are: After signatures A and B, for C, D, E, and F, the workmen seem to have changed more frequently, the two, on occasion, setting alternate pages. It is possible that a third compositor was employed. Deere is invariable and said is so until C8 v , after which a few X forms occur. Being/beeing, receaue/receiue etc., mooue/moue etc., sodaine/suddaine, and sweete/ sweet are seldom helpful. England's Helicon (1600) is probably another book for which the same two compositors were at least in part responsible, but for many of its pages there is no certain evidence. This might well be due to its copy being written in many different hands. All that may be claimed here is that signatures C, F, and O seem especially to belong to Compositor X, and S, Aa, and Bb to Compositor Y.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV It is time to return to the question which led to the examination of these books printed by Roberts: what evidence is there for saying that the copies for Q2 Hamlet (1604/5) and The Merchant of Venice were in the same handwriting? One answer is fairly straightforward. It has been shown from Roberts' reprint of Titus Andronicus and from other books first printed by him, that the two compositors whose work has been identified sometimes retained uncharacteristic forms from their copy. Since Hamlet and The Merchant share a larger number of significant spellings than any other two books which have been examined-and this in spite of a gap of some four years-it follows that the spellings of their copies were much alike. In particular, it appears from Titus Andronicus that if the copy contained only -ow and -ew forms, very few -owe or -ewe forms would be found in the printed book. This view is supported by Harsnet's Declaration and The Poore Man's Passions. Now in both Hamlet and The Merchant the longer spellings occur not only in pages set by X but also in those set by Y. It therefore seems highly probable that the copy for both plays had a considerable number of -owe and -ewe forms. It is worth noting that Addition 'D' of the manuscript of Sir Thomas More (believed by many scholars to be in Shakespeare's handwriting) contains 4 -owe or -ewe spellings, 12 and not one -ow or -ew. Similarly, it appears from Titus Andronicus that Compositor X did not always change farewell to farwell, and this is borne out by A Poor Man's Passions. Smith's Four Sermons suggests that he did not often change deere to deare, and also, with Harsnet's Declaration and Estie's Exposition, that he did not often change said to sayd. Titus Andronicus shows that Compositor Y did not often change houre to howre, and this is borne out by A Declaration. These spellings were significantly varied in Hamlet and The Merchant, and it therefore seems likely that the copy for both plays contained a preponderance of farwell, deare, sayd, and howre forms. A complete check of the spellings in the two plays and other books by Roberts would be a very long task, and beyond the scope of this paper. It would be especially complicated by the possible illegibility of the copy for Hamlet. Nevertheless, it is possible to check a few unusual forms, as, for instance, 'how so mere' in The Merchant (G2 v ) and 'howsomeuer' in Hamlet (D3 v ). Both were set by Compositor X and we might expect that he was responsible for the 'm' spellings; but there is more evidence in signature Q of Estie's Exposition where the same man, in all probability, set the usual form 'howsoeuer'. Until a complete check is made, such details are of little value, 13 and the recurrence of -owe, -ewe, farwell, deare, sayd, and howre forms is, at this stage, the strongest evidence that the two copies were in the same handwriting. Most of the spelling checks I have made have proved of little use in showing that the two copies were in a single hand, but they have shown that many unusual spellings in Hamlet which were listed by Professor Wilson as possible evidence of Shakespearian orthography, 14 are in fact often found in other work by the two compositors responsible for Hamlet. Hether is a clear example: it was set several times in Q2 Titus Andronicus where Q1 reads hither; X set it in The Poor Man's Passions (F4), and Y in Harsnet's Declaration (B2 v ); it occurs also in England's Helicon and Smith's Four Sermons. Similarly, doost was set several times in Titus where Q1 reads dost (e.g., D3 v ,4, &amp; E1 v ). The evidence for the compositors' predilections is not quite so strong with seauen, but it should make us hesitate before calling the spelling Shakespearian: X set it in Estie's Exposition (M5 v ,&amp; N1) and both compositors set it many times in A Declaration (e.g., H3 v , K3 v , N1 v , O3 v , T2, &amp; Ee3). Tearmes was likewise set by X in The Poor Man's Passions (B1) and by Y in Estie's Exposition (B1 v ). I hope these few examples will show that no spelling in Q2 Hamlet can be accepted as Shakespeare's own until a complete check of the spellings used by Roberts' compositors has been undertaken. The changes made in reprints will be especially valuable evidence for this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V The punctuation of both Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice has been praised as particularly sensitive. 15 It is certainly very light, and the possibility that it represents Shakespeare's own punctuation must be considered. The first question to ask is whether it was typical of Roberts' printing house. My general impression of the punctuation in the Roberts books I have examined is that the two compositors in whom we are interested, varied their punctuation considerably; this is especially clear in England's Helicon where their copy was possibly in different hands, with as many different kinds of punctuation. However, the lyrics of England's Helicon are perhaps special cases. I will quote some passages from the prose works already examined. First, two passages from Estie's Exposition, the first set by Y, and the second by X: The thing, is to bee deliuered from blood. Some learned Interpreters, by bloods, vnderstand tragicall examples, and bloody euents in Dauids stock and house: but they cannot well proue this. I thinke, it signifieth man-slaughter and murder. For Dauid now thought vpon the murdering of his most faithfull seruaunt Vriah, and slaughter of the other in his band. Thus are bloods often taken in the Scriptures. Gene. 4.10. (H4- 4 v ) God hath blessed and hallowed this day, to this end: therefore it must be kept. Thus haue we the cōmandement shortly laid downe: but all this while here is nothing of the place. (N1 v ) These two passages are, I believe, representative of the kind of punctuation throughout this book. Occasionally there is a proliferation of commas: The parts are inward affections, and secret hart, that is, as we heard before, the disposition of the will, iudgement, and affections. In deede mans soule is a spirit somewhat like God, and had princedome ouer the creatures, as a shadow of Gods soueraignty, but the seat of likenes, most principally is the soule. (E6 v ) Both compositors in Smith's Four Sermons reproduce a peculiar use of the colon to mark direct speech: Faith in all afflictions doth lift vp her head, wayting, in assured hope, beyond all hope, and seeing the clouds scattered ouer her head, yet shee is euer comfortable to her selfe, saying: anone it will be calme: and although all the friends in the world doe faile, yet it neuer faileth nor fainteth, but euer keepeth promise.... (A3 v ) Some will say, it is a testimonie of our good wil. To such we must reply, saying; so it is a testimonie of your ignorance: and then after a little conference they vvill graunt, that indeede it doth not profit them. (B2 v ) The examples I have given could be greatly multiplied, but I hope they are sufficient to show that the light punctuation of Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice is by no means the invariable practice of the two compositors who set the plays. This is borne out by Roberts' Q2 Titus Andronicus; in this book, the compositors made the punctuation heavier than their copy. Not counting question marks, there were some 240 changes which made the punctuation heavier, and some 120 which made it lighter. A good proportion of these must be considered as corrections to the copy; there was a measure of editing in the reprint and the 'editor' may have considered punctuation to be within his scope. Of all the changes, about 80 or so involved semicolons, colons, or full-stops. Titus Andronicus therefore suggests that the compositors of Hamlet and The Merchant tended to add to the punctuation, not reduce it. And despite their changes and some obvious errors, they seem to have been careful and conservative over it; for example, on G2 a comma is kept at the end of a line, where it may imply that the following line breaks out abruptly, stopping the first speaker in the middle of a sentence (IV.ii.80). I have been unable to find any way of treating the copy's punctuation which could be ascribed to one compositor only. I think this is as far as my investigations will allow me to go in considering the printing of Q2 Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice. Obviously there is a lot left to do. We should like to know more about the spelling of each compositor, and, perhaps more important, we should like to know to what kind of errors each compositor was prone. This paper can only be a beginning, and will have achieved its purpose if it has shown the evidence for two compositors in each play, and suggested ways of tackling the many problems connected with editing their work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * After I had come to my general conclusions, I heard that Dr. Alice Walker had information that led her to think along the same lines. We corresponded and she most generously gave me a free field. I should have felt more uneasy at accepting this arrangement if she had not assured me that an investigation into James Roberts' compositors would have led her away from the main direction of her studies. I have greatly benefited from her advice; in particular she has helped me to increase the number of significant spellings, and to decide about the allocation of doubtful pages. 1 The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (1942), pp. 64-5. 2 A Definitive Text of Shakespeare: Problems and Methods," Studies in Shakespeare , ed.

This information became available as this paper was going to press. It would seem that X used Y's cases for setting L4 v , and also for L1 if it was his work. 6 Deare is found on a page set by Y (G4 v ). 7 In the following tables, I have not noted Ile where it follows a full-stop or begins a verse line in a passage where lines are normally capitalized. 8 Cf.

It would seem that for both plays the copy had a form similar to 'a le(a)uen', which is also found in Addition 'D' of Sir Thomas More. This has a bearing on the theory that Act I of Hamlet was set from a hand-corrected copy of Q1: Q1 and Q2 are very close here and the former reads 'eleuen'. 14 Op. cit., I, 114-117. 15 J. D.

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of Hamlet, Q2 by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND quarto of Hamlet, printed in 1604/5 by James Roberts, offers an interesting problem in running-title analysis. Over and above this, our ability now to separate the pages set by the two compositors provides a check, not usually present in running-title problems, to test results by other evidence. Thus when, as in Hamlet, the spelling tests for compositors equate so precisely with what one may conjecture to have been their stints from the evidence of running-titles, we may be somewhat more confident in the future about roughing-out two-compositor work in books on this running-title evidence. Not, as will be seen, that the running-titles will always tell us the precise pages set by different compositors, for they would not have detected in Hamlet the unusual fact that Compositor X assisted Y with sheet L by setting sig. L4 v , and L1 r . On the other hand, bibliographical evidence about the presswork may assist to differentiate the work of compositors when spelling tests prove doubtful. For example, in Hamlet the spelling evidence in sheet N is not so clearcut as in other sheets and might even be interpreted as indicating the possibility, at least, that compositor Y set sigs. N1-2 v , and X sigs. N3-4 v . But the evidence of the running-titles practically enforces the hypothesis that sheet O + A was imposed before either M or N, and, moreover, that inner N was imposed before any forme of M. If this is so, and it seems to be true, then it is all but impossible to work out stints for the two compositors that will enable them to have shared sheet N; and hence it is necessary to weight the almost equal evidence and to award all of sheet N to compositor X, a view confirmed by typographical evidence. Running-title and spelling tests, therefore, offer valuable complementary evidence to decide difficult problems in the analysis of printing. Some time ago a preliminary survey of the running-titles convinced me of the possibility, even the necessity, for the use of two presses in printing Hamlet Q2. But since I was then concerned only with discussing the nature of bibliographical evidence in criticism of Dover Wilson's non- bibliographical hypothesis that the quarto was set by only one compositor, I merely sketched in the general pattern which the running-titles in their skeleton-formes took, and did not list precise details. The purpose of this note is to present the complete evidence, and from this evidence to construct a hypothesis about the order of the sheets through the press. Mr. John Russell Brown's article in this volume of Studies gives the result of spelling tests which show that compositor X set sheets B. C, D, F. I, sig. L1 and L4 v , sheet N and half-sheet O (doubtless including the title-page on half-sheet A machined with 0). Compositor Y set sheets E, G, H, K, sigs. L1 v -L4 r , and sheet M. This assignment is confirmed by the running-titles, which show that sheets B-D, F. and I were imposed by one pair of skeleton-formes; and sheets E, G, H, K, and L by a different pair. Sheets M-O exhibit a curious mixture of titles from the two different sets, which will be analyzed below, but the main pattern is clear that compositor X served one press and imposed his formes for that press, whereas compositor Y served a second press and, correspondingly, imposed his own distinct formes for that press. The evidence of the running-titles follows. I have assigned roman numerals to identify every title and have not indicated the few times when minor re- spacing somewhat alters the appearance of the typesetting. These running- titles are occasionally so similar in their typographical characteristics and in their spacing determined by measurement as to lead to considerable difficulty in precise identification. However, I have reasonable confidence that the table below presents the facts with some accuracy. The relation of the N1 running-title is the only point of serious doubt. I B2 v -C1 v -D1 v -F1&amp; v -I3 v -N3 v IX E1 v -G1 v -H1 v -K1 v -L3 v -M3&amp; v II B2-C2-D2-F4-I4-02-N1(?)

The first concerns the transfer of running-titles from the formes of sheet B to those of sheet C whereby in an unusual manner two running-titles break their formes and are exchanged for each other. Such an event could not arise unless both formes of B were rinsed and lying together on the bench waiting to be stripped and their furniture, including the running-titles, to be transferred to the C formes. Presumably this situation would occur only if the conclusion of machining a sheet coincided with the end of a working day when, as here, the first forme of sheet C did not need to be ready imposed before the last forme of sheet B came off the press. On the evidence it would seem probable that both formes of sheet C were imposed the next morning at the start of the working day and the type of B thus released for distribution. The error, though that is too serious a word, could have been caused if we imagine the two formes of B to have been lying on the bench in the following relation, the outer forme having (a common practise) been turned end to end: B (i) B (o) (4) IV VIII (3 v ) (1) [ ] I (2 v ) (1 v ) III II (2) (4 v ) VI V (3) Since sig. B1 contained the head-title, an additional running-title (VII) needed to be set above what, owing to the turn of the outer-B forme, was the C3 type-page. If, when this was done, the compositor had moved to the left instead of to the right to select the B furniture to place about the C4 v type-page, he would have taken title VIII from inner-forme B3 v instead of title I from outer-forme B4 v . C(i) C(o) (4) IV III (3 v ) (3) VII VIII (4 v ) (1 v ) I II (2) (2 v ) VI V (1) The transfer of the running-titles from C(i) to (Di) was accomplished normally, with each title being placed in its corresponding position in the newly imposed forme. An irregularity developed in the transfer of the outer forme, since C1 and C3 went properly to D1 and D3; but C2 v to D4 v and C4 v to D2 v Such an exchange diagonally across a forme is somewhat unusual but not unknown. I have observed it before and speculated whether it meant that some compositors stripped the form not horizontally or vertically, but instead on a diagonal. It will be noticed that precisely the same diagonal exchange takes place in both formes when sheet F is imposed from D. In the inner forme D2 and D4 go respectively to F4 and F2, and in the outer D2 v and D4 v respectively to F4 v and F2 v . And in the transfer of the running-titles from both formes of F to I, once more each forme exhibits one diagonal exchange: F1 v and F3 v to I3 v and I1 v and F2 v and F4 v to I4 v and I2 v respectively. This is an interesting compositorial habit, seemingly, although compositor Y indulges in it four times also: between H(i) and K(i) the titles of H2 and H4 are exchanged diagonally, and between K(i) and L(i) the titles of K1 v and K3 v ; in the outer forme G2 v and G4 v titles exchange in the transfer to H, and H2 v and H4 v in the transfer to outer K. The transfer of titles between E(o) and G(o) is not irregular since it apparently results from the forme of E(o) having been set down on the bench in a turned position, although one cannot in this book, at least, rule out the slight possibility that a double diagonal exchange has been made. At this point two statements may be made about the printing before sheet M which are pertinent in connection with what is to follow. First, except for the evidence that under special circumstances C(o) was first imposed although not necessarily first sent to press, we cannot distinguish, except inferentially, the order in which formes for any sheet were imposed and machined; but we do know that there was perfect regularity of procedure and that each compositor faithfully imposed inner from inner and outer from outer. Second, we know that whatever slight irregularity developed, as in the diagonal exchange of quarters common to both compositors in transferring furniture, each forme maintains its integrity, and except for the special circumstances of sheet C there is no transfer of running-titles and furniture from one forme to another. Hence when this transfer develops with sheet M, and running-titles indeed are exchanged even between compositors, the effect is not random but there is a cause to seek which must lie in the circumstances of composition or presswork and is therefore subject to analysis. For a start, we have one useful piece of information derived from the spelling tests: compositor X assisted his companion by setting type-page L4 v and very likely L1 r of a sheet not assigned as part of his stint. Another piece of evidence derives from the running-titles. Although the types for the letterpress of the running-title I4 v -O1 v -N2 v are identical, an adjustment is found in its spacing which indicates that the title was imposed above O1 v directly from I4 v , and thereupon the spacing differs in the same title on N2 v It would appear, therefore, that sheet O+A was imposed and machined before sheet N. Even without this important evidence, we should be forced to infer this order of printing as I-O-N for the work of compositor X, since the only non-random explanation for the evidence of the running-titles in sheets M, No, and O requires some unusual employment of only certain titles in a forme leading consequentially to a necessary breaking-up of the integrity of the skeleton-formes. This requirement can be satisfied only by the imposition and machining of half-sheet O (by twin half- sheet imposition with half-sheet A) before either sheet M or N. Moreover, the evidence of the running-titles requires inner N to have been imposed before either forme of M. This latter requirement cannot be met if the two compositors split sheet N between them, for workman Y would be free to tackle N only after he had finished M. We are able, as a result, to lay out an approximate time schedule for the relation of the two compositors' typesetting. On the evidence that X helped Y by setting sigs. L1 and L4 v it would seem fair to conjecture that X was the faster workman, assisting a slower compositor who was falling behind his press; and some evidence in support of this conjecture may be found in Dr. Walker's analysis of the work of the two compositors in her "Collateral Substantive Texts" in the present volume of these Studies. How much faster he was, however, is difficult to assess. Moreover, since we may reasonably assume that the time taken to machine a sheet at each of the two presses would be relatively constant, faster composition would not mean faster printing unless the slower compositor delayed his press by failing to have formes ready when required. The fact that the hypothetically slower Y used two skeleton-formes for each sheet, however, would appear to indicate that at the start, at least, he was able to keep up with presswork. By the time he came to sheet L, however, he may have begun to experience difficulty, and that may explain the intervention of X with this sheet. The assistance that X gave to Y by setting L1 and L4 v is rather curious. From typographical evidence Dr. Gerritsen has discovered—that the italic in each compositor's font was cast on a different size of body so that a similar speech-prefix will vary in measurement by about one millimetre according to the fonts-it is clear that when X helped Y. he abandoned his own cases and used Y's. This is most curious, although it could perhaps be explained as a device not to mix the types when the formes of L were distributed by Y and thus to prevent the depletion of X's cases if the pages set by him in L were not segregated for his own distribution. However, it raises the question whether the two workmen were composing simultaneously, or whether X took over composition while Y was imposing one or other formes of K and very likely engaging in some distribution Whichever it was, both men could not be using the same cases for their separate purposes. It may be, however, since compositors seemed to have worked with pairs of cases, that X composed from one set while Y was either composing from or distributing to the other set. 1 Still another problem is raised by the particular pages L1 and L4 v both from the outer forme, chosen by X. One of three explanations may conjecturally account for the apparent anomaly that X did not proceed to L1 v after setting L1. According to the first, he may have been casting off copy and setting by the forme so that when Y. returned Y. would have only two type-pages to compose to have outer L ready for the press. According to the second, when X first started on L1 he may have swung over to help his companion because he thought his own stint was finished, and only a short time later was it decided that he should continue by preparing the title-page. 2 Since further cast-off copy would indicate that some text type-pages would need to be imposed with the title-page, it may be that in next selecting L4 v compositor X was killing two birds with one stone. That is, he would not only provide Y with the opportunity to set the rest of sheet L most expeditiously by formes, but he would also provide himself in L4 v with the farthest point in sheet L from which to cast off the manuscript to insure accuracy when he came to set the pages of half-sheet 0. Thirdly, we cannot be sure, of course, that L1 and L4 v were set seriatim, as has been assumed in the above. Hence it may be that X assisted Y by setting L1 that he then proceeded to the pages of O + A, and finally returned to assist once more with L4 v before continuing with N1. But except for the very dubious evidence of capital W's on L4 v following on two VV's at the foot of L1 there is no evidence, in fact, of the order of setting L1 and L4 v . An approximate composition schedule for the work of the two men might resemble something like the following. In it, I have included arbitrarily two extra type-pages in X's stint as against Y's, on the evidence for his faster composition. I have also assumed in this schedule that X set both L1 and L4 v . An alternate ending might have been: Before discussing this curious alignment, we may survey the evidence that leads to the reconstruction of such a schedule. Since there are only four pages of letterpress to combine with four blanks in sheet O + A, there would have been time for compositor X to turn to the assistance of Y by setting O + A and L1 and L4' before the first forme of O + A was required by the press. It may be that I(o) was first off the press and that O(o), requiring only the single type-page O1, was immediately imposed from it, though it is clear that the I(o) type-pages with their running-titles were not used to furnish-out the blanks. Bench I(o) Forme O(o) VII VI bl bl or bl bl VIII V V bl or bl V If the last forme of sheet I to come off the press coincided with the end of a working day, perhaps as with C the two formes of O were simultaneously imposed at the start of the next day. Bench I(o,i) Formes O(o,i) VII VI II I bl bl II tp VIII V III IV bl V VI bl Whichever it was, we seem to have a roughly similar occurrence to that found in the imposition of sheet C with the selection of II and VI on a line, though from different formes, to impose O(i). If we arbitrarily assume that O(o) was first sent to press, and that N(i) was imposed while O(i) was printing, the quarters available on the bench, and the imposition, would be: The prime difficulty here lies in the reason why title XII was taken from Y's bench to fill up the fourth quarter when VII and VIII and probably V were available. The regular transfer to the same respective positions of titles I, III, and IV shows that II must have been previously removed, and this evidence joins to the clearcut case of respacing VI between O1 v and N2 v to indicate the high probability that the imposition of O preceded that of N. As remarked above, this order is also indicated by the necessity to explain the irregularity of the running-titles in M and N as consequent upon the use of only some titles in imposing sheet O + A. If, as seems possible, the wrought-off formes for both presses were placed on the same bench, in spite of the fact that previously there had been no mixing of the running-titles, it would appear that in this case, partly perhaps because no complete X forme was present, the compositor, once more on a line, abstracted the furniture and running-title from another forme. This time he was forced to do so by the presence of only three quarters in I(i). The only odd matter is that he used a quarter from his fellow compositor's forme, which is highly unusual in two-press printing. When Y came to impose M(i), he had on his part of the bench only the three remaining running-titles from L(i): IX X, and XI. These he imposed in their regular positions except for a diagonal exchange of IX and XI, and he necessarily abstracted his fourth quarter from X's share, choosing VII from I(o). M(i) imposition VII IX XI X When N(o) came to be imposed by X he had these miscellaneous quarters available, and also L(o) on Y's part of the bench: I(o) O(o) O(i) L(o) II XIII XIV VIII V VI XVI XV He seems to have ignored V and VIII, and started to impose N(o) from the last available forme O (i), inserting the furniture of quarters II (title respaced) and VI, and finished by borrowing XIII and XIV from Y. N(o) imposition XIII XIV VI II? Thus when Y came to impose M(o), only four quarters were left on either bench, VIII from I(o), V from O(o), and XV and XVI from L(o). These four produced the final imposition of the quarto: M(o) imposition XV VIII XVI V The above reconstruction has been somewhat arbitrarily presented without an attempt made at showing possible alternatives, in large part because no alternative that I have been able to conceive of has in any way fitted the evidence of the running-titles. It is necessary to repeat that on the evidence of sheets B-L of this quarto, as well as the evidence of countless other books, there is every indication that printing would have continued normally to the end, each skeleton-forme as a unit imposing the next forme, if some unusual circumstance had not intervened. So far as I can see, this could only have been the printing of sheet O + A after sheet I. Thereafter, no compositor could have an integral skeleton-forme to transfer as a unit, once compositor X had abstracted XII from Y's materials to impose inner N. On the evidence it would seem that after formes were broken up, the compositors (or at least compositor X) were indifferent where they secured their quarters for imposition. It is unfortunate that the spelling evidence is not more clearcut for L1 since if X set only L4 v the situation would be much more transparent. The collateral spelling evidence does seem to tend towards the hypothesis that X set L1, although something could be said for the appearance of the two VV's as favoring Y. The question has no intimate relation with the breakup of the skeletons consequent on the imposition of O + A and what this tells us of the order of the sheets. And the conjectural schedule is not vitally affected, though it would be much neater if only L4 v were set by X. Since there is some small latent doubt about the assignment of L1 I add a proposed schedule in case X set only L4 v This is an adjusted printing composition schedule: One troublesome remaining question is why, if X started setting only shortly after Y, the two men did not alternate sheets regularly as they had previously done in the first Merchant of Venice quarto. It is distinctly odd that copy was cast off to start Y with sheet E when X was either just finishing sheet B or beginning sheet C. Then, although Y skips sheet F, he sets two adjacent sheets G and H, and after skipping I sets two more sheets in a row, K and L, followed after L4 recto by sheet M. It may be that this plan was adopted to enable X to draw more even with him. Why X set A + O after sheet I, and only then returned to assist Y by setting sheet N is explicable, apparently, only by supposing that the original plan was to put X to work on another book, leaving Y to finish the quarto at his own rate. This would help to explain the three-sheet sequence K, L, M given to Y; and we must suppose that the plan was cancelled when A+O was set, and L1 and L4 v had been helpfully typeset to assist Y, once it was seen that the schedule was such that both compositors could finish at approximately the same time if X set N while Y worked on M. This hypothesis may appear to hang together, the more especially since only by some such reconstruction of motive can one explain why X helped Y by setting two pages of L instead of continuing with his own stint. However, if we take it that X's stint was planned to end with I, or just possibly with something after I, like A + O, then the distribution of the sheets for setting is fairly regular, given the fact that Y started with sheet E, for each compositor did in fact alternate sheets with his fellow (except for the G-H sequence) up to the start of K, from which point it would appear Y was at first expected to carry on alone to finish the book. If so, there remains only the question why so late a sheet as E was assigned as the beginning of Y's stint. This question has no easy answer, and it is more than possible that the question of copy had something to do with the case, for it must be remembered that the first act, in which contamination from Q1 has been detected, concludes seven lines down on E1. The precise manner in which Q1 influenced Q2 has not yet been established with certainty, nor have its limits been definitely determined. It may prove to have significance that the major, though not the only, pages in which contamination seems apparent appear in sheets B-D assigned as the stint of compositor X, even at the price of starting Y so late as sheet E. But it would be idle to speculate about this matter further until a more precise study is made of the influence of Q1 on Q2, a study which I hope to publish in the near future.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 For example, it will be noticed that four regular roman capital W's appear in the upper part of L1 recto, set by X, but when next the letter is required he twice sets VV for W at the foot, perhaps indicating that the sort was exhausted. Yet on L1 v , Y regularly sets W. Capital W appears on L4 v . On the other hand, the worth of this evidence is doubtful. In X's stint the only other time he uses VV for W is on B4 v once, though W appears on C1 which should have been composed before any forme of sheet B was distributed. Compositor Y sets VV once on G3 v , line 7, but W precedes it in line 4, and various W's follow on the same page, four to be exact. Y also uses a VV on H1 v along with W. and again on H3, K2 (thrice), L2 v , and M2. Very likely Y liked to justify a line by substituting VV for W. 2 That X may have thought he was finished with his assignment could be indicated by the fact that O + A was set by X before N. Sheet N. therefore, would appear to have been added to his stint still later.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Collateral Substantive Texts (with special reference to Hamlet ) by Alice Walker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In my article on the Folio I Henry IV, 1 1 I suggested that there might be as many as two hundred errors contributed by the compositor alone in the Folio texts of Lear and Othello. In what follows I shall consider what can be done to eliminate these and other errors from edited texts. The quarto and Folio texts of Lear and Othello are substantive collateral texts and there is only one way in which collateral texts can be edited: that is eclectically. In his preface to Juvenal, Housman exposed with devastating logic 'the folly of leaning on one manuscript like Hope on her anchor and trusting to heaven that no harm will come of it.' Collateral substantive prints stand broadly in the same relationship to the 'true original' as collateral manuscripts at the head of a series to the archetype. Consequently, Housman's principles for the editing of Juvenal and Manilius hold good for the editing of those plays of Shakespeare for which we have two or more substantive prints. In the case of Juvenal, the text was corrupted in transmission by the blunders and interpolations of scribes and by interchange of lections. In the case of Shakespeare's plays, transcription, memorial contamination, printing-house errors and conflation have similarly operated against any one substantive text's preserving the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The lines of transmission for Shakespeare's plays are shorter, but a careless print could cause greater damage at a blow than a succession of conscientious copyists and we have only to think of Hamlet Q2 to realise what the damage might amount to. The position as regards Shakespeare's plays is naturally simpler than is the case with the text of Juvenal. All the same, two of our 'better' substantive quartos, Roberts's Hamlet Q2 and Creede's Romeo and Juliet Q2, have suffered from contamination by an inferior strain as well as from the carelessness of compositors. The third substantive text of Hamlet, the Folio, was likewise carelessly printed and the copy seems also to have been contaminated by playhouse corruptions. The quarto of Troilus and Cressida, though a good text, is at least at two removes from the foul papers; and the Folio text, which should have corrected all the quarto's errors, failed to do so and introduced further complications through printing- house errors of its own. The Lear quarto is a mongrel of obscure provenance, closer by descent (on the evidence of its length) to the foul papers than the Folio text; and the latter, though of respectable antecedents, was carelessly printed, corrupted by conflation, and, in any case, somewhat suspect since it was based on a prompt-book. Only if one of these prints had flawlessly reproduced autograph which had not been tampered with by another hand would we be justified in reliance on the better text. No one, of course, supposes that substantive Shakespearian texts (whatever their superiority to a collateral) have the integrity of Malone Society reprints, and editors have rightly made use of an inferior collateral print (even the worst of bad quartos) when they recognised that through a scribe's or compositor's carelessness, or the editorial interference of a bookkeeper or expurgator, a word, phrase, line, or passage was lost or perverted in the superior text. Where much current textual theory and practice seems at fault is in refusing to desert the better text unless its readings are impossible. Thus, on the false premises that it is not safe to reject a reading in the Folio Lear provided some kind of sense can be made of it, two recent editors follow the Folio in reading 'being' in the following passage (II.ii): such smiling rogues as these, .............smooth euery passion That in the natures of their Lords rebell, Being oile to fire,snow to the colder moodes, Reuenge,affirme,and turne their Halcion beakes With euery gall,and varry of their Masters. If the editor of Lear chooses to follow the Folio's 'being' rather than the quarto's 'bring', it should be for one of two reasons: either because he believes it is the better reading (and not because he finds it in the better text) or because there is nothing, so far as he can see, to choose between these variants. In the latter event, he must follow Housman's reasoned policy of giving priority to the reading of the better authority, not in any confidence that it is necessarily right but because the odds are that the better text will be right oftener than the inferior one. On merits, the quarto's 'bring' is unquestionably superior to 'being', and discrimination between readings on individual merit (and not according to provenance) will undoubtedly remove most of the compositor's errors from the Folio texts of Lear and Othello. Naturally, the less the damage to the inferior text in transmission the oftener the choice will prove to be a straightforward one, uncomplicated by the possibility of emending the reading of the better text in some other way. It might perhaps be asked 'why then all this bother over problems of transmission if the choice of reading rests on merits ?' There are two main reasons, which I have already hinted at. The first is that we need to know which is the more authoritative text because an editor must fall back on this when the merits of readings are so evenly balanced that he finds discrimination impossible. Fortunately, in great literature, and especially in the work of a connoisseur of words like Shakespeare, it does not often happen that an editor needs to gamble in this way. The second reason is that we need to know all we can discover about the transmission of substantive texts in order to formulate coherent principles for emendation. Many of our substantive collateral texts are memorially contaminated and for this reason it may at times be necessary to emend a blunder in the superior text rather than to accept what appears at first sight the superior reading in an inferior one. We need, that is, to know not only what is an error (a matter of literary judgment) but also what kind of error it is (a question of transmission). This is why we need the fullest possible information about the history of the printer's copy (whether foul papers, a transcript, a memorially contaminated text, or 'mixed' print and manuscript) and all that can be discovered by bibliographical means about its printing (the habits of the compositor or compositors who set it and everything that the press-work and proof-correction can tell us). From my own experience in editing these texts, I should say that, when the variants are considered on their merits (artistic, dramatic, acoustic 2 ), the Folio versions of Lear and Othello contain well over two hundred errors apiece (mostly compositor's errors) and that the number is nearer three hundred in Lear. This is, of course, a personal judgment. On what is a matter of editorial principle based on reason, like Housman's logical procedure for the editing of collateral texts, we should be able to reckon on editors seeing eye to eye. Agreement is also to be expected over principles of emendation, provided there is basic agreement on transmission. But where the merits of individual readings are in question, though responsible editors are fairly certain to concur in rejecting most of the poorer readings, we must expect difference of opinion over a few; and this is only proper if the aim of English studies is to foster the exercise of an informed but independent judgment on literary matters. Consequently, I am not afraid like one bibliographer 3 that, since what is known of Jaggard's proof-reading makes the emendation of Folio texts not merely allowable but desirable, editors will give their fancy too free a rein. No one would begin to edit Shakespeare without some feeling of the matter or without giving careful thought to the work of enlightened editors who worked on genuinely eclectic lines-notably the Old Cambridge editors. We know a great deal more about the transmission of Shakespeare's plays than they did, but a great deal less about how to choose a good reading from a bad. They paid Shakespeare the compliment (I think rightly) of supposing that the better reading, even if it occurred in an inferior text, was his. This was sensible, since it is obviously easier to mar what is good than to improve on it. The fashion is now, on the contrary, to suppose that the errors in the better texts were what Shakespeare wrote and that the better readings in inferior texts were the improvements of book-keepers and actors. We ought to give our greatest poet and dramatist the benefit of any doubt. Nor, like another bibliographer, 4 do I regard the kind of conflation which I postulate in the transmission of the three Hamlet texts as a complication one would gladly be rid of: it would be far better to be rid of common errors. Why should we regret the loss of security if the security was merely security in error? Editors of classical texts have surmounted the obstacles of conflation, 'troublesome to the truth-seeker and annoying to the formulist yet not on the whole disadvantageous to the author.' 5 If there are common errors due to conflation they should be removed. To suggest that we need to re-consider the principles on which collateral texts are edited is not therefore to suggest putting the clock back to the mid-nineteenth century. Eclecticism today would be (and is) controlled by the great advances due to twentieth-century research into the big problem of transmission which defeated the Old Cambridge editors. Eclectically edited texts of Hamlet today are, of course, grounded on Q2 and the recognised procedure (where merits are evenly matched) is to give Q2 the benefit of the doubt and (if possible) to emend the Q2 errors in accordance with what can be inferred concerning transmission rather than to accept (as the Old Cambridge editors did) Folio variants which may be no more than bodges. But this, and the emendation of common errors where there has been conflation due to the use of mixed copy, is not the end of the matter. Hitherto we have generalised about texts, describing The Merchant of Venice Q1 and the Folio Henry V, for instance, as 'clean' texts and Hamlet Q2 and Coriolanus as 'careless.' We can no longer generalise in this way. The two Roberts quartos were the work of the same pair of compositors, as has been shown elsewhere in this volume; the two Folio texts were the work of the same pair of Jaggard compositors, and how much more careful Jaggard A might be than Jaggard B was demonstrated in my article on I Henry IV. Hence the superiority of Henry V may have been due to its having been mainly the work of Jaggard A, whereas Jaggard B was largely responsible for Coriolanus. There is certainly a marked increase in the number of errors when B takes over in the former (pp. 71b-75a,88-9,92a) and a decrease when A's hand is evident in Coriolanus (pp. 7,9-11,13- 4,16a,18a). Hence it might not follow that the copy for Coriolanus was inferior in any way to the copy for Henry V. The basis for comparison is, therefore, in the first instance compositorial and, if it happens that the work of one compositor was inferior to that of his fellow, generalisations about a text as a whole and conclusions drawn from such generalisations as to either the extent of printing-house corruption or the character of the copy may seriously distort the facts. Since we now know that the same pair of Roberts compositors set The Merchant of Venice Q1 and Hamlet Q2, it is natural to ask what emerges from a comparison of their work in these two texts and what the editorial implications are. This is especially important in the case of Hamlet. Dover Wilson's pioneer enquiry into the problem of transmission led him to the conclusion that the Q2 text was set up by a single compositor, who was both incompetent and hurried. The conclusion has not until recently been questioned and the eclectic tradition in the editing of Hamlet, though it has shifted ground a little, has not lost face: Dover Wilson's, Alexander's, and Sisson's are all eclectic texts. I have already argued that the eclectic editing of collateral texts is soundly based on common sense, but common sense will not, of course, explain whether the supposed disparity between the two Roberts prints is real or imaginary nor, if the belief is justified, account for the difference. Many factors have to be borne in mind. I have mentioned one already that inferences about the transmission of a text cannot fairly be made until its errors have been analysed in relation to the compositors' stints. This therefore needs to be done before we can judge whether copy was a factor to be reckoned with. The second is, that it is dangerous to assume that texts set by the same compositor or pair of compositors were set under equally favourable conditions. Because Compositor B was careless in I Henry IV and his work is manifestly more careless than A's in Henry V, it by no means follows that he was invariably responsible for an average of eight errors to a page in setting from print, his average in the former play, and five errors to a page in setting from manuscript, his average in the latter (so far, of course, as we can judge from the manifest errors in a text for which we have a single authority). Julius Caesar, for instance, was mainly B's work (A setting only pp. 112-4 and the lower half of 129b), but it is, to all appearances, a cleaner text than Henry V; and it would be rash to argue that this was due to more legible copy for Julius Caesar on account of the considerable number of errors in I Henry IV where B was working from print. In the present state of our knowledge we can only guess what caused this apparent inequality of workmanship in Folio texts. The work of the normally accurate Compositor A went to pieces, for instance, in Troilus and Cressida, and haste may therefore have affected the quality of the work. Thirdly, we have to remember that the editing of texts for which we have a single authority is conservative. This was the policy which the Old Cambridge editors deliberately adopted on the grounds that they knew too little about transmission to emend, with confidence, corruptions of unknown origin. 6 Where they had, or thought they had, collateral texts, they selected what, in their judgment, was the true reading; where they had a single authority, they only emended when the Folio reading was impossible and the emendation adopted was the only possible remedy. If the defect could be made good in more ways than one, then they made no alteration but left it to the reader to exercise his own judgment on the emendations recorded in their notes (a fact perhaps forgotten by those who are no less conservative but provide no critical apparatus). Since no appreciable change is evident in the present-day editing of texts based on a single authority, comparison between the number of readings normally emended in The Merchant of Venice and Hamlet Q2 is significant only if we postulate the editing of the latter on conservative lines, disregarding the evidence of Q1 and the Folio. I shall approach Hamlet through The Merchant of Venice, tabulating the readings in The Merchant which any or all of the four following editions have emended: the Old Cambridge edition, Dover Wilson's, Alexander's, and Sisson's. I disregard Q2 readings followed by the Old Cambridge editors in the belief that it was the earlier of the two editions dated 1600, except in a few cases where the choice may have been made on merits. 7 I give the line numbering of the 1891-3 Old Cambridge edition and italicise trivial errors (including a few mis-spellings which may have been due to misreading), giving the correction (when necessary for clarification) in brackets. In the case of more serious errors I give first the Q1 reading and then the emendation in modern spelling, followed by the sigla of the editions which have adopted it. If there is more than one emendation, I place the best first. I disregard everything immaterial to verbal accuracy (including grammatical normalisations, expansions and contractions for the sake of the metre) and also the provenance of emendations unless they originated in one of the later quartos or Folios. 8 Many of the emendations (as will be seen) are of the kind that anyone following the matter intelligently might make and a few may have been accidentally introduced. It is of some interest that Jaggard B set the 1619 quarto (a compound of intelligence, highhandedness, and carelessness) and also pp. 162a (= 164a),178-180a,183 of the Folio text so that the Folio emendations between III.v.75 and IV.i.225 (inclusive) are probably his. A conspectus of this kind can, of course, give only an inkling of what the corruption may amount to, 9 but it seems reasonably likely to give a fair picture of the comparative merits of the two compositors and what it suggests is that Roberts X was more prone to error than Roberts Y. What we have is 19 trivial and 57 more serious errors, 10 of which 11 trivial and 36 more serious are in X's stints ( just over 34 pages) and 8 trivial and 21 more serious in the work of Y (38 pages). 11 That the error at III.iv.49 was Shakespeare's and the mistake at IV.i.393 possibly due to a conjectural attempt to supply a missing speech prefix does not affect the picture. No full sheet set by X is (apparently) so free from errors as Y's sheet B; nor is any sheet set by Y so manifestly careless as X's sheet G. On the other hand, there is seemingly not much to choose between X's work on sheet C and Y's on sheet D. Misreadings are not numerous: 'docks' at I.i.27, 'wit' at II.i.18, 'timber' at II.vii.62, 'heere' at III.i.92, 'Tranect' at III.iv.53, 'meane it, it' at III.v.68, 'bleake' at IV.i.74 are errors of this kind, but the majority of the errors suggest the accidental interpolation or omission of letters and words rather than difficulties with copy. Roberts's Hamlet Q2 gives much the same sort of impression of greater care on the part of Compositor Y. If we isolate from consideration the first three sheets (the work of X) set up, I believe, from mixed copy and, therefore, not so relevant for comparison with The Merchant of Venice, what we find on a survey of Q2 readings rejected by all four editions in favour of the Folio readings is that the number (including trivial errors) is about 35 on every full sheet except on sheets E and K (both the work of Y), where the number is about halved, and 24 on sheet I (the work of X and his best stint when setting from manuscript). But these figures afford no real basis for comparison with The Merchant of Venice and what we need, in order to get the matter into perspective, is a conspectus of what the postion might have been if editors had been dependent on Q2 for the text of Hamlet. What a difference the survival of a collateral text makes can be demonstrated from Hamlet itself. I have mentioned sheet K as one of the two sheets set by Y which exemplify (on the evidence of the four editions used as yardstick) more reliable workmanship than is characteristic of sheets E-O in general. The four editions reject unanimously one reading on K1, three on K1 v , one on K2, two on K2 v and one at the head of K3. Two-thirds of K3 and nearly the whole of K3 v are occupied by Hamlet's conversation with the Captain and his soliloquy on the little plot of Polish ground (IV.iv.) Here editors accept the Q2 text, though it has manifestly garbled both matter and metre here and there, having no collateral authority by which to correct its readings since the Folio omits nearly all of the scene. On K4, where the Folio comes to the rescue again, one reading is corrected and three are corrected, with Folio aid, on K4 v What we need, therefore, is to bring the editing of Hamlet Q2 into line with the editing of these two pages and The Merchant of Venice. Nothing would be gained by listing for the whole of Hamlet the Q2 readings rejected in favour of the Folio's by the four editions. Samples will serve to show where the difference lies between the two quartos and what it amounts to. I shall give, therefore, the readings of three sheets (E,F,G) for comparison with The Merchant of Venice tables above, marking with an asterisk the Q2 readings which I judge all four editions would have emended and with an asterisk in brackets readings over which I judge opinion would have been divided, bearing in mind, of course, editorial procedure concerning similar errors in The Merchant of Venice. The second reading given in my tables is that of the Folio. I obelize readings where some larger omission would have been suspected. What emerges from this hypothetical view of Hamlet Q2 (E-G) as edited on conservative lines without reference to Q1 or the Folio is as follows:   E F G Trivial errors 4 5 5 Readings postulated as corrected in all 4 editions 5 12 8 Readings over which opinion would have divided 4 7 5 It would therefore appear that the disparity in workmanship between Roberts's Merchant of Venice and Hamlet is not nearly so striking if we disregard the evidence of collateral texts, though it is plain that the workmanship in Hamlet is certainly poorer. Y's sheet E (on the hypothesis above) with 4 trivial errors and 5-9 manifest errors of a more serious kind is among the best of Y's stints in Hamlet and compares unfavourably with what would appear to be his best sheet (B) in The Merchant of Venice. Nor is it quite as good as sheet D in The Merchant of Venice, seemingly his worst stint in the earlier quarto. What occasioned the difference would appear in some measure to be haste, since difficulties with the copy (though they might have occasioned the haste) cannot be directly responsible for the trivial slips: Y's 9 on sheets E and G, for instance, is in excess of his total in The Merchant of Venice 12 and that X's sheet F was hurried work is plain from the unsightly failure to range speech-prefixes, evident on most pages of this sheet, as well as from the large number of errors, though the number of manifest errors does not compare too unfavourably with his sheet G in The Merchant of Venice . Since Y appears from both texts to have been the more careful workman, it seems likely that we shall find the best reflection of the character of the copy in the sheets set by him. I shall therefore consider briefly what the Q2 readings on sheets E and G rejected by all four editions suggest about the manuscript. On E there are three misreadings ('wit' at II.i.38, 'sallies' at II.i.39, and 'about' at II.ii.125) and one misunderstanding ('or tooke' at II.i.58, which, if the compositor had interpreted the copy rightly, would have appeared as 'ore-tooke'); there are five errors due to the omission or addition of a letter ('addistion' at II.i.47, 'stokins' at II.i.79, 'passions' at II.i.105, 'shone' at II.ii.76, and 'wath' at II.ii.147); five omissions (at II.i.28,52 and II.ii.57,90,148) and the substitution of 'her' for 'his' (at II.ii.142) through repetition of a pronoun. On sheet G there are seven misreadings ('deale' at II.ii.595 (an error repeated), 'lowlines' at III.i.46, 'quietas' at III.i.75, 'euocutat' at III.i.118, 'stature' at III.i.159, 'vnmatcht' at III.i.188, and praysd' at III.ii.29); three errors due to the omission of a letter ('An' at III.i.1, 'sickled' at III.i.85, 'pronoun'd' at fifteen omissions (at II.ii-577, III.i.32, 55, 83, 92, 107, 121, 129, 137, 141, 142, 145 and III.ii.22,26,36) and seven further errors due to misapprehension or faulty memorisation ('two' at III.i.28, 'Wee'le' at III.i.33, 'these' at III.i.99, 13 'list' at III.i.144, 'expectation' at III.i.152, 'what' at III.i.157, and 'detected' at III.ii.87). We get a very different impression from these two sheets. The errors on sheet E suggest lack of care rather than difficulties with the copy and that the manuscript is unlikely to have presented very serious problems seems clear from the fact that this was Y's first stint and, therefore, his initial effort with an unfamiliar script. He may, of course, have started on this sheet with time in hand, but we can at least safely postulate that, given leisure, the copy could be deciphered. What occasioned the more numerous errors on sheet G may therefore have been haste, possibly partly due to an increase in the amount of prose; and it is worth remarking that X's poor performance on F (mostly prose) and better work on I (all verse, and his best sheet set from manuscript) seems to point the same way. It would be unreasonable to suppose that Roberts's manuscript was a careless transcript of the foul papers, since a playhouse transcript prior to the prompt-book would have served no useful purpose if it had not been both legible and passably accurate. And the possibility that any kind of transcript lay behind Q2 seems to be ruled out because, although a copyist might not achieve the same level of accuracy throughout, it involves the double coincidence that good and bad patches corresponded with the sheets of a printed book and that the better patches twice fell to the lot of the better of a pair of compositors. We have seen that there is a marked increase in the number of errors on F and there is a similarly noticeable difference between X's sheet I (where twenty-six readings are condemned by all four editions) and Y's sheet K (twelve readings condemned on the six pages for which the Folio provides a check). The errors in Q2 must therefore be laid to the charge of the compositors. On the evidence of sheets E and K, the text could have been much better, though Y's work on these sheets precludes our supposing that, even if Hamlet Q2 had been set at greater leisure, it would have seemed as clean a text as The Merchant of Venice. To postulate that the compositors were mostly hurried may not, therefore, go all the way to explain the difference, and a contributory factor may have been that Roberts's manuscript was not as fairly written as the manuscript for The Merchant of Venice. Obvious misreadings, as we have seen, are infrequent in the earlier quarto. There are, in fact, more misreadings on sheet G of Hamlet Q2 than there are (seemingly) in the whole of The Merchant of Venice. The likelihood would therefore, seem to be that the manuscript for Hamlet was more cursively written and much like the manuscripts from which Henry V and Coriolanus were printed. Given time, or comprehension of the meaning, it was readable (there is, for instance, only one misreading, 'ground' for 'grave' on sheet K 14 ), but what difficulties Shakespeare's hand presented when transliterated without understanding is evident from some of the errors in French words in Henry V. Even though the spelling is often quasi-phonetic, 'saaue' for 'suivez', 'perdia' for 'perdu', 'buisse' for 'baiser' suggest misreadings of the kind of writing that gave rise to 'deale' for 'devil' in Hamlet Q2-a word which had presented no difficulties in The Merchant of Venice and might have been inferred from the context in Hamlet if the compositor had had time to reflect on the meaning. The general verdict on the number of errors in Hamlet Q2 is (I think rightly) that it is very high. All the same, regrettable as it is, there is nothing extraordinary about this state of affairs, and we have only to think on the one hand of the Folio Romeo and Juliet to realise what garbling could result from hasty work (even when the copy presented no difficulties) and on the other hand of Okes's Lear to realise what blunders ill- written copy might lead to. The most disturbing class of Q2 Hamlet errors is the many omissions. Bearing in mind Compositor B's interpolations in I Henry IV and the fact that he set the greater part of the Folio Hamlet, this is where vigilance is especially necessary, even though recognition that there is playhouse corruption in the Folio text has already provided a safeguard. A few facts of general interest emerge from the preceding survey. The first is that genuine eclecticism in the editing of Hamlet has not resulted in wide divergence of opinion. 15 On the other hand, there is no established consensus of opinion over the seemingly few errors and suspect readings of The Merchant of Venice. The second is that the eclectic editing of collateral texts not only enables an editor to locate and emend the errors of the better text with greater assurance but it also throws a great deal of light on one aspect of printing-house transmission. If proof had been scrupulously read with copy, there would have been no need to use the evidence of collateral texts in this way; but Roberts's proof-reading for Hamlet was evidently haphazard and even literal errors escaped correction. If the evidence of the Folio text for Roberts's compositors' errors is disregarded, we have nothing to substitute except a personal judgment which is, in every way, more partial; and how imperfectly it must operate is evident from The Merchant of Venice. Fuller knowledge about transmission gives greater security, and the study of collateral texts has as much to contribute to fuller knowledge as the study of reprints. What can be deduced from the Folio Hamlet about Roberts's compositors should, in fact, assist in the editing of The Merchant of Venice.</field>

I.i (F1, p. 146)-an error of no account, since it occurred in a reprint, though it served as a warning How, they asked, could one retrace the error from 'merit' to 'friends'? The error is certainly perplexing, but we now have the comfort of being able to isolate Folio pages set by B and there is, in any case, no evidence that this kind of aberration occurred so often that normal emendation need take much account of it. 7 The Old Cambridge editors made an unlucky choice when they concluded that Q2 (Pavier's falsely dated 1619 quarto) was the earlier and took this as the basis of their text. But since Q1 (the Heyes quarto) contained manifestly superior readings, they concluded that the two prints were independently set up from the same manuscript and, having, as they thought, collateral substantive prints, they made their choice of readings on merits. Eclecticism thus saved them from the worst results of wrong conclusions about transmission: the more serious errors of Q2 (set up by Jaggard B) were removed, though many trivial errors (which got the benefit of the doubt) were retained. 8 The conjectural or fortuitous improvements of these derivative texts have, of course, no authority and I distinguish them from the emendations of 'named' editors merely because some were in all probability accidentally made. 9 Partly, of course, because we have no collateral text and partly because so little is known about the character of Roberts's proof-reading of this quarto. 10 I use the word 'errors' for brevity and convenience What the term covers, both here and in my later discussion of Hamlet Q2 readings, is certain errors and some of the more seriously suspect readings (though, of course, not all by any means of the latter in The Merchant of Venice ). 11 Y'S first sheet included 6 full pages of text; X's last just under 2 1/2. 12 This comparison is, strictly, only a fair one if we know that the sheets in question are either all in the uncorrected state or are all in the corrected state after proof-reading with similar care and this we do not know. What we can be certain of is that the errors were the compositor's and, since G(o) of Hamlet Q2 survives in two states and the errors cited were not corrected, it seems legitimate to conclude that (so far as the evidence of this sheet goes) there was negligence on the part of both the compositor and the proof-reader. 13 Emendation would here be unnecessary if 'these' in the following line was emended (as a common error) to 'them'. 14 The fall in the number of errors on this sheet, and especially in the number of perversions due to imperfect memorisation, points rather to greater leisure in setting than a chance improvement in handwriting. Nor can the difference be explained as due to careful proof-reading. On the evidence of the Old Cambridge edition notes, the proof-reader merely altered 'most' to 'must' at IV.i.31 on K1 v . 15 The solidarity would have been even greater if the Old Cambridge editors had not taken the Folio as the basis of their text.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Relation Between the Second Quarto and the Folio Text of Hamlet by Harold Jenkins</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Although the older editors of Hamlet preferred to base their texts on the Folio rather than the Second Quarto, it is now twenty years since Professor Dover Wilson demonstrated the superiority of Q2 His view, elaborated in The Manuscript of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' (1934), was that we have in this, the first good quarto, a text of the play deriving from Shakespeare's foul papers. It is a view that now needs modifying to allow for some use of the bad Q1 by the printers of Q2, but otherwise it has generally been accepted. 1 The present-day editor of Hamlet, therefore, is in no doubt about what his chief authority is to be. 2 But he has the major problems of what use he is to make of Q1 and F. Q1 in this article I propose to leave aside. F, though farther from Shakespeare's autograph than Q2, has somewhere behind it a good manuscript and it can serve to correct some of Q2's many errors. If it could be taken to rest entirely on a manuscript which was independent of Q2: F would also serve to corroborate Q2 where they agree and the editor would know that readings which occur in both could not be rejected unless they could be explained convincingly as common errors. The question of the relation between Q2 and F is therefore a matter of first editorial importance. Professor Dover Wilson, of course, maintained that F was independent of Q2: "It is clear that the 1605 Hamlet or its reprints, the Smethwick quartos, do not at any point come into the pedigree of the F1 text." 3 The opposite theory, namely that F derived, with modifications, from Q2? had occasionally been put forward, notably by Hendrik de Groot, who held that a copy of Q2 became the promptbook at the Globe and that this promptbook, altered, corrected, and augmented, served as copy for F. 4 But Professor Dover Wilson's skillful analysis convinced all the leading authorities, from whom the following are some representative opinions: The idea that [F] was printed from a play-house copy of [Q2] corrected by reference to the prompt-book must be abandoned. There are so few bibliographical resemblances and so slight a community of error between the texts of Q2 and F that it seems impossible that the latter should have been printed from the former, however much modified. (Hamlet, ed. T. M. Parrott and Hardin Craig, p. 25). The folio text of Hamlet is certainly . . . substantive in its own right. (Sir Walter Greg, The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare, p. xix note). The folio was printed from a manuscript and not from a quarto. (Ibid., p. 64). This is the view that has now been challenged by Dr. Alice Walker, 5 who maintains that Hamlet, like five other plays in which the Folio text diverges very considerably from the quartos that preceded, was nevertheless set up in the Folio from a quarto that had been corrected on collation with a manuscript. Her argument as to Hamlet rests on erroneous readings found in both F and Q2; anomalous spellings common to both; and mistakes of punctuation in which F is thought to have been misled by Q2. If Dr. Walker is right, then the whole editorial position is changed. Agreement between Q2 and F in any particular reading need not constitute a dual authority but may arise from an error in Q2 which the collator failed to notice or at any rate to correct. The object of the present article is, then, to review the evidence for the theory that F was printed from a corrected copy of Q2. Two explanations are in order at the beginning. In theory of course F could derive from Q2 indirectly by way of one of the reprints Q3 and Q4; but in fact some of the crucial spellings disappear from Q3. My own inspection confirms Dr. Walker's judgment 6 that any significant resemblances F has with the quartos are greatest with Q2 itself. It is therefore to a comparison between F and Q2 that I here confine myself. For F I have used the Devonshire copy in the Oxford facsimile: the possibility of variant readings in other copies has of course to be allowed for, but this margin of error, when the evidence is considered as a whole, is certainly a small one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Common errors. Dr. Walker reminds us that Professor Dover Wilson lists eleven identical errors in Q2 and F. 7 She rejects one of these, but adds four others. Her suggestion of course is that F took these errors from Q2. The alternative is to suppose that the two texts derived them independently (Q2 directly and F via one or more transcripts) from Shakespeare's own manuscript: either they stood as errors in the autograph or the autograph was twice independently misread. I give the list of fourteen with the Globe line-numbering: I. i.94 Q2 desseigne, F designe (for designd) I. iii.74 of a most select I. v.43 wits II. ii.612 Q2 of a deere, F of the Deere (omitting father) III. ii.295 Q2 paiock, F Paiocke III. iii.18 somnet III. iv.121 haire IV. v.119 Q2 browe, F brow V. i.71 Q2 ô the time, F O the time V. ii.29 Q2 villaines, F Villaines ( for villanies) I. ii.209 Whereas (= Where as) II. ii.510 A rowsed (= Aroused) III. iii.66 cannot (= can not) IV. vii.126 Q2 indeede, F indeed (= in deed) Little need be said of Dr. Walker's four additions. Even if 'cannot' is an error, which is not certain, she herself admits it likely enough that in these wrong word-divisions two compositors could have made the same mistake. Equally of course such readings could have been in Shakespeare's autograph. Of Professor Dover Wilson's original list, the most striking is the reading of I.iii.74, which is certainly obscure, though the trouble may lie, as Professor Dover Wilson admits, 8 not in 'of a most select' but in 'chiefe' (F cheff) later in the line. Q1 agrees in both readings. This may therefore be a case where a good text has been contaminated by a bad; but it is also possible that the three texts agree because their readings are the right ones, though we do not understand what Shakespeare meant. Malone and the N.E.D., by variously glossing 'chiefe', have tried to explain the line as it is. In V.i.71, 'ô', to represent the grave-digger's breath-pause, 9 is anomalous only in comparison with 'a' three times in this line and the next, and could easily go back to Shakespeare. So of course could 'wits', 'haire' and 'browe'. The plural form of the first, echoed by the singular 'wit' in the next line, seems to have been influenced by the 'gifts' with which it is associated, but is as likely to have been due to the author as to a compositor. 'Haire', subject of two plural verbs, and 'browe', governed by 'betweene', are both unsatisfactory in the singular; but the objection is in each case to grammar only, not to sense, and I see nothing beyond what Shakespeare could in haste have written. 10 One must not give too much weight to such anomalies. "The Q2 passage may well be an unresolved tangle", explains Dr. Walker herself on one occasion, 11 and we have to allow for the presence in Shakespeare's foul papers of a number of these, which may have been transmitted independently to F. F's 'designe', 'Paiocke', 'somnet' and 'Villaines', all indubitably wrong, are more difficult to explain. But e for d , i for c , mn for mm, in for ni are very easy misreadings, and if Shakespeare's handwriting led the Q2 compositors to make them, as it apparently did, it may easily have given rise to the same errors in the scribe who copied Shakespeare's foul papers for the playhouse-as Professor Dover Wilson indeed suggests. 12 One might, it is true, have expected 'designe' and 'somnet' to be corrected before they reached F, but it should be noted that 'Villaines' is satisfactory to sense and condemned by metre only. As the most significant identical error we are left with the omission of the word 'father', which Q1 supplies, at II.ii.612. The capital for 'Deere' in F shows that this word was mistaken for a noun and that 'father' was therefore absent from the F copy; but the erroneous substitution of the definite for the indefinite article in F might be against its dependence on Q2 even here. Altogether the identical errors on which one might argue F's dependence on Q2 make a very small bag for a text of the length and difficulty of Hamlet. Nor can it be much enlarged from the possibles that Dr. Walker from time to time suggests: I.ii.198, wast, where Q1 reads 'vast'; I.iii.130, bonds ( ? bawds); II.ii.397 hand saw (F Handsaw); III.ii.262, mistake, where Q1 has 'must take'; III.ii.269, ban, where Q1 has 'bane'. Of these 'mistake' has been well defended 13 and all are certainly defensible. F's running 'Handsaw' into one word does not suggest copying from Q2 Anomalous spellings. Among the spellings in which F agrees with Q2, Dr. Walker finds a score or so which are anomalous either in relation to contemporary custom or to the Folio practice elsewhere. Some of these do not seem to me to be anomalous at all, viz: I.i.55, Q2 ont, F on't; I.ii.204, Q2 distil'd, F bestil'd; II.i.99, Q2 adoores, F adores; III.ii.117, Q2 O ho, F Oh ho; III.ii.144, Q2 for ô, for ô, F For o, For o. F's 'adores' is due to a misreading, but a compositor could have committed this quite as easily in working from a manuscript as from Q2. I see nothing odd that cannot have descended from Shakespeare's original manuscript in F's 'Illo, ho, ho . . . Hillo, ho, ho' (I.v.115-6) or 'ennactors' (Q2 ennactures, III.ii.207). Slightly, but not very much, more significant, may be I.i.40, of (for 'off', which some copies of F have); I.i.73, brazon; IV.v.206, Q2 colaturall, F Colaterall; V.i.310, Q2 cuplets, F Cuplet. Whatever significance attaches to 'smot' (I.i.63) and 'sent' (= scent, I.v.58) comes from their occurring also in Q1, from which it is suggested that Q2 may have taken them. But both are common spellings in the period, and 'sent', which is the F spelling of the corresponding noun in The Shrew and Twelfth Night, may be regarded as normal. For 'smot', however, it is to be observed that it occurs in the same line as 'pollax' (see below). Interesting certainly are II.i.3, Q2 meruiles, F maruels (for 'marvellous'); and IV.v.100, Q2 impitious, F impittious. But if the odd Q2 spelling is Shakespeare's own, this could equally well have been retained by a playhouse transcriber of his autograph and so transmitted to give the F readings without any contamination from Q2. (Cf. 'adores' above.) Dr. Walker notes, however, that among 20 other instances of marvellous in A, 'maruel's' occurs but once and that when the F spelling derives from Q. The F spelling 'impetuositie' in Twelfth Night is less pertinent. The striking common spellings seem to me to be the following: I.iii.73 ranck, with a c unique in F in the spelling of the noun and rare even in adjectival use, though its occurrence is to be noted in The Merchant of Venic e and Henry VIII; II.ii.531 ore-teamed, which contrasts with 10 instances of 'teem(ing)' in F; II.ii.566 dosen, instead of 'dozen', which is found in all 33 other instances of the word in F; II.ii.578 fixion, contrasting with 'fiction' in Twelfth Night and Timon ; V.ii.322 how, as a cry, which, though normal enough in Elizabethan spelling, tends in F to be replaced by 'hoa' (see, e.g., Hamlet, III.ii.57; III.iv.22,23; IV.iii.16); and most remarkable of all, I.i.63 pollax (F Pollax), for 'Polacks'. This last seems inexplicable as a reading of any manuscript and has to be attributed to a phonetic rendering of something said and heard but not understood. It occasions no surprise in the reported text Q1, from which it is reasonably held to derive in Q2 and to have been transmitted through to F. To what is suggestive about these spellings Dr. Walker adds the not negligible weight of two anomalous apostrophes common to Q2 and F: I.v.162, can'st; I.v.167, dream't. These in themselves are not remarkable, but since they occur also in Q1, that may have been their source, in which case they must have been transmitted to F through Q2. There seems, then, enough evidence from spelling to suggest that some, though not necessarily extensive, use was made of Q2 in preparing or in printing the text of F. Punctuation. The errors in punctuation common to Q2 and F are, again, not numerous, and the three examples to which Dr. Walker gives prominence could find other explanation. They could derive independently in each text from Shakespeare's practice of underpunctuating, but it would be foolish to deny any significance to them and especially to the second. It is Dr. Walker's view that in all three cases "the F1 compositor either followed or was led astray by, the pointing in Q2." 14 I.ii.17 Q2 'Now followes that you knowe young Fortinbrasse. . .' F's introduction of a comma after 'followes' and no point where one is required,after 'knowe', shows an obvious misunderstanding. II.ii.420 Q2 'nor Plautus too light for the lawe of writ, and the liberty: these are the only men.' It must have been some such unintelligible punctuation as this that led the F compositor to print 'nor Plautus too light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty. These are the onely men.' III.i.6off. Q2's omission of pointing after 'sleepe' in line 60 and 'die' in line 64 is repeated in F. Stage-directions. Dr. Walker also notes one or two correspondences between Q2 and F in stage-directions. There is nothing much perhaps in F's retention, at the opening of I.ii, of Enter Claudius, [F Claudius ] King of Denmarke, Gertrad [F Gertrude ] the Queene. A little stronger-cumulatively at least-are: I.i.18, Exit Fran.; III.iii.26, Exeunt Gent.; and IV.i.31, Enter Ros. &amp; Guild. The striking direction at I.v.149, Ghost cries under the Stage, probably came from Q1, but the irregular entry for Osric at V.ii.360 may have originated in the autograph. The F speech-heading Qu. at III.ii.238 when the Player Queen's other speeches are in F headed Bap(t). is clearly due to an oversight in the copy; but it permits no deduction about what the copy was. Even after Dr. Walker's very thorough scrutiny of the texts, it is possible that a few further significant resemblances may be detected. It is very unlikely that she has overlooked either the orthographic interest of 'soop- stake' (F Soop-stake) at IV.v.142 and 'vnsinnow'd' (F vnsinnowed) at IV.vii.10 or the probability that in both cases the Shakespearian spelling has simply been retained. 15 She hints herself at further instances in F of punctuation derived from Q2, and one may note such minutiae as the comma after 'vs' at I.i.25, the absence of a comma after 'them' at I.ii.258, and the period after 'loue' at I.v.23. None of these is surprising, but none is quite satisfactory, and they may all have been taken by Q2 from Q1. In addition to the stage-directions noticed above there might be significance in some of the following: I.i.1, Enter Barnardo, and Francisco, two Centinels (F omits the commas); II.ii.169, Exit King and Queene (F &amp; Queen); IV.v.96, A noise [F Noise] within (set up in each case to the right of the text); V.i.1, Enter two Clownes (plus the regular use of the speech-heading Other for the second). Altogether it does not seem possible to deny that F may depend in some measure upon Q2 and that an occasional reading may therefore occur in F simply because it was already present in Q2. What a survey of the resemblances between Q2 and F does not justify is a whole-hogging theory that Q2, however much corrected, rather than a manuscript served as the principal copy for F.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Against such a theory stand at once two highly significant facts, one acknowledged by Dr. Walker and one ignored. No clear typographical links between Q2 and F have been discovered and considerable passages in Q2 are omitted from F. These omissions, mostly explicable as theatrical cuts and natural enough in a playhouse manuscript prepared for performance, 16 are difficult to account for if the printers of F, which aimed at giving Shakespeare's plays "perfect of their limbes", were working from a copy of Q2 in which these passages were included. Moreover, while Dr. Walker has painstakingly collected evidence which would support her case, she has neglected items, even in her own categories of spelling and punctuation, which go against it. Divergences between Q2 and F need perhaps even more careful handling than similarities. Anomalies common to two texts can sometimes establish that one was printed from the other; but in the nature of things it is difficult to prove the negative. This is especially so when divergences can be explained as (1) emendations made by a corrector of Q2 based upon the manuscript with which he was collating, as well as (2) the inevitable errors and alterations of the F compositors. Even so the divergences between the two are very great. It may be thought that Dr. Walker relies too heavily on compositors' errors as explanations of corruptions; and there are, I think, many features of the F text which the two causes of divergences are together insufficient to explain. Erroneous readings. If the F text was in fact set up from a corrected copy of Q2, then the manuscript used by the hypothetical corrector of Q2 was certainly at one and possibly at more removes from Shakespeare's autograph; and it had also undergone alteration by or for the players. It had therefore plenty of opportunity for the corruption and vulgarization which have given in F so many inferior readings. But the question that arises is how far such corruptions would have been transferred by the collator to the copy of Q2 on which he worked. It is a necessary postulate of Dr. Walker's theory that the corrector sought mechanically to bring the Q2 text into line with the manuscript he was using, exercising no editorial discrimination; but granted that the aim was to secure a better text for F, I find it difficult to accept correction of so extremely mechanical a pattern as it would be necessary to infer. 17 A mechanical corrector might conceivably have introduced such nonsense as the notorious 'or Norman' for 'nor man' at III.ii.36 or 'our Nation' for 'the Nation' at IV.vii.95-if indeed these are not attributable to compositors' errors-perhaps even 'their corporall' for 'th'incorporall' at III.iv.118. But was 'inobled' deliberately introduced for the 'mobled' Queen? Without Q2 to guide him either a transcriber or a compositor might easily have so misread a manuscript copy; but, with 'mobled' twice in front of him in print, one would have expected a collator to pause before insisting on this reading and a compositor not to make this error three times over. Other nonsensical readings which could have arisen from the misreading of manuscript copy but which a corrector might have been expected to refrain from introducing into Q2 include: II.ii.580, warm'd (Q2 wand, = wann'd); III.i.48, surge (Q2 sugar); III.i.99, then perfume left (Q2 their perfume lost); IV.iii.7, neerer (Q2 neuer); IV.vii.143, I but dipt (Q2 that but dippe); IV.vii.156, commings (Q2 cunnings); IV.vii.183, buy (Q2 lay). It would have to be a very mechanical correction indeed which substituted readings such as these. And again one cannot well impute them all to simple errors of a compositor working from a printed copy. Some of them might of course have arisen from compositor's errors which, as we know often happened, a proof- corrector emended by guesswork without reference to copy. The complete collation of the Folger Folios which is now being undertaken might throw some light on this. But in the present state of my knowledge I see no reasonable explanation of F's numerous errors of this order on the assumption that F was set up from Q2. 18 Stage-directions and speech-headings. In the matter of stage- directions, although a few small similarities have been noticed, the most obvious thing that emerges from a comparison of Q2 and F is the remarkable nonconformity of the two texts. A corrector of Q2 who achieved this result would have had to carry out a very thorough-going revision. This of course cannot be ruled out, for something of the kind was apparently done with Q6 of Richard III, if scholars are right in holding that F printed from that quarto. 19 But it is worth noting that the Hamlet alterations embrace a number of quite pointless variations. Among these I cite: I.ii.159, Q2 Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo F Enter Horatio, Barnard, and Marcellus; II.ii.221, Q2 Enter Guyldersterne, and Rosencraus, F Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne; III.ii.52, Q2 Enter Polonius, Guyldensterne, &amp; Rosencraus, F Enter Polonius, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne. In the last two a transcriber might easily have given Rosencrantz the priority normally accorded him elsewhere, but a deliberate transposition of the Q2 order, either by collator or compositor, is unlikely. At II.ii.39, Q2 has Exeunt Ros. and Guyld., and it is difficult to see why a corrector or a compositor with plenty of room should have wished to replace this explicit direction with the single word Exit. I do not think the correction of Q2 from a manuscript is a sufficient explanation of these changes. A comparison of speech-headings yields similar results. My own fragmentary observations confirm the conclusion of Dr. Philip Williams that in plays set from quartos the Folio compositors tended to be guided by the speech-headings in their copy. 20 But of course the speech-headings of a quarto might reach the F compositors already heavily altered by a collator, as Richard III, again, suggests. So perhaps not too much should be made of the discrepancy in III.iv. and IV.i. of Hamlet, where Q2 heads the Queen's speeches, with one exception, Ger., while F sticks steadily to Qu. The replacement of short by longer forms of speech-heading requires a different explanation. A compositor familiar with the play, if we could assume such, might, I suppose, have substituted such longer forms as Polon. for the Pol. which Q2, after an initial Polo., invariably uses. The occurrence of Polon. in F in I.iii, II.i and II.ii coincides with the work of compositor A, who always uses this form, while B overwhelmingly prefers Pol. 21 But Polon. turns up in one small block (III.ii.390 ff.), as well as sporadically elsewhere, in the work of B; and it is probable that this form of the speech-heading was the one commonly found in the copy, which A, according to his wont, tended to follow more exactly. Rosin., rather than the Ros. of Q2, would seem to have been the normal speech-heading for Rosencrantz in F's copy: 22 its use in F is quite consistent except for IV.ii.5, where Ro. occurs for reasons of space, and it runs through the work of both compositors. F's single instance of Marcell. at I.v.148, in a scene where both texts are otherwise content with Mar., is, on the theory that F was set up from Q2, more than a little odd. Punctuation. A consideration of the punctuation provides more clues. It is true that there are passages showing a high degree of correspondence between the two texts. Dr. Walker has cited the 'To be or not to be' soliloquy, and another example might be the speech of Claudius which ends IV.iii. But the opposite situation is notorious in the 'What a piece of work is a man' speech, and whatever one's view of the alternative methods of punctuating this, the one thing that is clear is that the F punctuation did not derive from Q2. It is Dr. Walker's observation of the Folio compositors that they "normally reproduced the majority of the parentheses in their quarto copy". 23 This does not suggest that their copy for Hamlet was Q2, where, discounting passages of text which are not present in F at all, I count eleven instances of parenthesis and find as many as nine of these not reproduced in F. Yet the F Hamlet gives plenty of evidence of compositor B's recognized penchant for parenthesis, which occasionally leads him into error. A good example occurs at II.ii.140 with '(my yong Mistris)', which is absurdly taken for a vocative. Yet in the same speech this compositor missed an obvious opportunity in the line which Q2 points As I perceiu'd it (I must tell you that) (II.ii.133) His omission of any point after 'that' suggests that he never even understood that the second half of the line was parenthetical. He can hardly have had Q2 before him either then or when he failed to recognize the parenthetical phrase at III.i.192: Q2 Ile be plac'd (so please you) F Ile be plac'd so, please you These examples go against those three which Dr. Walker cites where F's erroneous punctuation seems to derive from Q2. And there are many similar ones. In the following cases F has been led into wrong, or at least inferior, punctuation precisely through not following Q2, and the natural inference is that Q2 did not serve as copy: I.ii.202 Q2 Goes slowe and stately by them; thrice he walkt F Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt, II.iv.56 Q2 With thoughts beyond the reaches of our soules F With thoughts beyond thee; reaches of our Soules II.i.41 Q2 Marke you, your partie in conuerse, F Marke you your party in conuerse; II.ii.145-6 Q2 she tooke the fruites of my aduise: And he repell'd, a short tale to make, F she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice, And he repulsed A short Tale to make, IV.iii.24-6 Q2 your fat King and your leane begger is but variable seruice, two dishes but to one table, that's the end. F Your fat King, and your leane Begger is but variable seruice to dishes, but to one Table that's the end. IV.v.112 Q2 Where is this King? sirs stand you all without. F Where is the King, sirs? Stand you all without. IV.vii.45-6 Q2 to see your kingly eyes, when I shal first asking you pardon, there-vnto recount F to see your Kingly Eyes. When I shall (first asking your Pardon thereunto) recount IV.vii.58-9 Q2 And how should it be so, how otherwise, Will you be rul'd by me? F as how should it be so: How otherwise will you be rul'd by me? The third and fourth examples in this list are spoken by Polonius, whose involved syntax frequently caused the F compositors trouble, in which the lightly punctuated Q2 gave little help. But I judge it to have offered more guidance in these two instances than F availed itself of. Again, of course, one must not neglect the possibility that an erroneous F reading might have arisen in proof-correction when a corrector tried to tidy up some compositorial muddle without reference to copy; and this should particularly be allowed for when, as in the second and fifth examples, an eccentric spelling ('thee' for 'the', 'to' for 'two') points to a likely source of confusion. But it would be very surprising if the proof-correction could be shown to account for all the misunderstandings I have cited. Two further passages deserve more detailed consideration. The first is I.iii.8-10: Q2 lasting, The perfume and suppliance of a minute No more. F lasting The suppliance of a minute? No more. Here the F compositor was baffled by his copy as he should not have been if working from Q2. His running of 'No more' into the same line looks like an attempt to eke out the metre consequent on the dropping of 'perfume and', which was presumably absent from F's copy. The omission of the comma, which suggests that 'the suppliance of a minute' was taken to be the object of 'lasting', also supports this. The other passage, IV.vii.101-3, is also one in which F has an omission: Q2 If one could match you; the Scrimures of their nation He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye, If you opposd them; sir this report of his F If one could match you Sir. This report of his The dropping of two lines is not in itself remarkable. But the usual explanations-a deletion in the copy or a compositor's oversight-are not here available. The attachment of 'Sir' to the sentence which precedes instead of that which follows the omission suggests that the printer's copy itself ran straight on. I think, then, that a study of the punctuation does not assist the view that F was in general set up from Q2. Spellings. Divergences of spelling are difficult to argue from. Abnormal spellings common to two texts-and Dr. Walker, as we have seen, has revealed a few pertinent ones in Hamlet- may well suggest dependence. But since the compositor was under no obligation to follow the spelling of his copy, the converse is not true. Yet there is one kind of word in which the compositor would normally be guided by his copy. I refer to proper names. Not all of these of course are significant: a compositor will have his own way of spelling Gloucester 24 and the names of other English earls or counties, as well as those of the classical figures who throng the Roman plays. But there are other names which must have been strange to the compositor, who would approach them without predilection. Hamlet has a number of these. The most striking are, to adopt the modern spelling, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. These were well-known Danish names in the sixteenth century, and their possible occurrence in the ur-Hamlet and their pre-Shakespearian history in England do not concern us here. What does is the consistent orthographic divergence of Q2 and F. Q2 invariably prints 'Rosencraus', F normally (II times) 'Rosincrance'. The F exceptions-'Rosincrane' three times and 'Rosincran' once-may safely be regarded as erroneous, and in any case they come no nearer than the usual F form to the practice of Q2. Even if one could presume a corrector who changed u to n throughout Q2, I should find it impossible to believe in one who regularly replaced the medial e by i or the final s by ce. The medial i in F also runs consistently through the speech-headings (42 of them). The name of Rosencrantz's companion shows a like discrepancy: it is regularly spelt 'Guyldensterne' in Q2, 'Guildensterne' in F. The variants 'Guyldersterne' (twice) in Q2 and 'Guildenstern' (twice) in F are insignificant. What is significant is that, apart from two instances of i in Q2 (III.ii.376; IV.i.31), the variation between y in Q2 and i in F is consistently maintained throughout text, stage-directions and speech-headings. There are over forty instances. The F spelling of these two names is, then, consistently different from that of Q2. And it cannot be attributed to a compositor, for both the compositors who worked on the F Hamlet followed exactly the same practice. The inference is inevitable that when they set up 'Rosincrance' and 'Guildensterne', together with speech-headings Rosin. and Guil. or Guild., they were following their copy. And therefore their copy could not have been Q2. This single piece of evidence seems to me conclusive. Other rare names in Hamlet give confirmation. 'Fortinbrasse' or 'Fortenbrasse' in Q2 becomes 'Fortinbras' invariably in F, both compositors again being involved. F's substitution of 'Gertrude' for 'Gertrard' may be accounted mere normalization, but since it too is quite consistent with both compositors, it cannot be ignored. Q2 always spells 'Elsonoure', but in all three instances in II.ii, shared between the two compositors, F prints the name 'Elsonower'. It is true that at I.ii.174 compositor A spells it 'Elsenour', but even here the medial vowel and the absence of the final e do not suggest that the spelling derives from Q2. Osric, either in full or in abbreviated speech-headings, is in Q2 eight times spelt with a t - 'Ostr(ick(e)'-before appearing twice without it; but 'Osr(icke)' without the t is always used by both compositors in F. 25 When a name is confined to that part of the play set up by one of the F compositors, the significance of divergent spellings lessens but does not vanish. The 'Reynaldo' of Q2, for example, is 'Reynoldo' in F in the one scene in which he appears; and since F's speech-heading is always Reynol., the crucial middle vowel is vouched for 17 times. 'Pirrhus' in Q2, though it has the variants 'Pirhus' and 'Phirrhus', retains the i in all 10 instances; in F it is invariably 'Pyrrhus'. 26 Q2's 'Ieptha' appears in F in all three instances as 'Iephta'. With Voltemand there is inconsistency in both texts: but where F spells 'Voltemand' in I.ii, Q2 has 'Valtemand', and when Q2 does spell 'Voltemand' in II.ii, F shifts to 'Voltumand'. The coincidence of 'Pollax' (Q2 pollax) at I.i.63 is offset by divergences elsewhere: for the Q2 'Pollacke' or 'Pollack' (II.ii.63, 75; IV.iv.23; V.ii.387), F has 'Poleak' and 'Polake'. Proper nouns or adjectives which have but a single occurrence include Q2 Nemeon, F. Nemian (I.iv.83) and Q2 Lamord, F Lamound (IV.vii.93); and, since it was apparently mistaken for a proper name, one might add Q2 Mallico, F Malicho (III.ii.149). Against all this there is not a single coincidence in the spelling of proper names throughout the play which can be held significant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Dr. Walker's expert scrutiny of the two texts has revealed, as we have seen, a number of resemblances between them. And when due allowance has been made for those which need not have the significance which she attaches to them, enough remain to make it probable that, in the preparation of F, some use was made of Q2. Such a conclusion is not in itself a new one; scholars have sometimes fallen back on the explanation that the printers of F occasionally "consulted" Q2. Dr. Walker ridicules such an explanation as lacking in logic and realism. It is also very inconvenient, since, if neither the nature nor the extent of consultation can be defined, it leaves the position of the modern editor hazy and insecure. But this he may have to put up with. What is illogical, of course, is the easy supposition that a handful of obvious common errors may be explained as due to consultation at the same time as F and Q2 are held to be otherwise independent. As Dr. Walker has so well insisted, in an important clarification of textual theory, to admit consultation in a few instances is to admit its possibility at any point in the text. For it is not to be supposed that every time Q2 was consulted what was taken from it would be a questionable reading; many readings thought to be above suspicion may have come into F from Q2. In fact the door is open for a hypothesis of conflation on a considerable scale; and an editor will do well to heed Dr. Walker's warning that "the Folio will not serve as . . . an independent witness to the correctness of readings where the two texts agree". 27 But Dr. Walker's theory that the actual copy for the Folio Hamlet was a corrected Second Quarto must clearly be rejected. 28 And although this may seem, so long as one accepts that Q2 was used at all, to leave the editorial position materially unchanged nevertheless where so much is uncertain, even the disproving of a hypothesis is something gained. What remains uncertain is exactly how Q2 was used for F. Professor Duthie has brilliantly shown how Q2 of Romeo and Juliet was set up from a copy containing manuscript and printed leaves, 29 and Dr. Philip Williams has recently argued that a similar composite copy lay behind the F King Lear. 30 In his view the printers set up Lear from a transcript of a promptbook which consisted of a copy of a quarto with some of the leaves replaced by leaves of manuscript; and he suggests that the copy for the F Hamlet may have been of the same kind. I do not know what further investigation may reveal, but I have found no evidence of this. Although significant resemblances between F and Q2 are greater in some passages than in others, notably in I.i.1-94 and II.ii.420-612, these passages also contain significant divergences and it does not seem to me that limits of text can be defined within which F does or does not depend on Q2. The probability, as I see it, is that when the printer's copy for the Folio was being got together, Heminge and Condell were not satisfied with the Hamlet quarto and, notwithstanding Jaggard's supposed preference for printed copy, supplied a manuscript version. In that case one may tentatively suggest that either the scribe who made a transcript for the printer (Dover Wilson's scribe C) or someone in the printing-house itself made reference to the quarto. The first seems to me the more likely. For everything goes to show that the printers were normally content to work from the copy that was supplied them and make the best they could of it. But I see no difficulty in supposing that a scribe who was charged with preparing a transcript of a manuscript might have a copy of the quarto at hand, or even open, in case of need. How much he may have used it will not be easy to determine.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Dryden's Mac Flecknoe : The Case for Authorial Revision by Vinton A. Dearing</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In an important article on "The Text of Dryden's Mac Flecknoe" ( Harvard Library Bulletin , VII (1953), 32-54), Professor G. B. Evans has called the attention of future editors of the poem to the textual evidence provided by seven early manuscripts and the printed texts of 1682 and 1684, which he has assembled in several pages of detailed collation. He is unable to establish the relationship of these texts, except that he believes that one of the manuscripts is simply a copy of the 1684 edition, but he argues that when all or almost all of the other texts oppose the text of 1684 they present genuine early readings which are sometimes preferable to the readings of 1684. It is the purpose of the present paper to suggest a relationship for these texts, and on that basis to attempt to distinguish early readings from late and to investigate further the likelihood that the 1684 text is in some places corrupt. The concepts and methods employed are in part, I believe, new, and will, I hope, prove generally useful. Professor Evans designates his texts by the sigla 82 , 84 , L , H , B , C , F , M , and I. In his list of variations he had recorded a number of accidentals-- differences in spelling ('upward(s),' line 215), hyphenation ('Royal(-) Barge,' line 39), and the like--which, as Greg has warned, only obscure the relationship of the texts in question. 1 The list should be confined to substantive variations, and to variations in punctuation that markedly affect the sense and so may be called substantive. Substantive punctuational variations are subject to a further restriction, because H and M have almost no punctuation. Therefore, so far as their punctuation is concerned, H and M are the equivalent of imperfect manuscripts, and their punctuation may be counted only when it is present. The selection of variations which results from the application of these principles is as follows: 6 1 , 6 2 , 9 1 , 10, 11 2 (omitting 'his Sons'), 11 3 ,12,14, 19 3 , 21, 23 1 , 23 2 , 27 2 , 29 2 , 31 2 , 31 3 , 33 1 , 33 2 ('clad':'cloath'd':'drest'), 33 3 (' Norwich drugget':'Drugget Russet':'rusty drugget':'Russell drugget':'rustick drugget'), 36, 37, 39 1 (ignoring hyphens), 41 2 , 41 3 , 42 1 (inversion), 42 2 ('Blankets':'Blankett'), 43, 44 1 ('still':'she'), 44 2 ('trembling':'trembles'), 44 3 , 45 1 , 46 (punctuation), 47 1 , 48 1 , 50 1 (omitting 'along' and punctuation), 50 2 , 50 3 , 51, 52 2 ,53 ('Andre's':'Andrew's'), 54 1 , 54 3 , 54 5 , 55 2 , 55 3 , 56 2 , 58, 59 1 , 59 2 (ignoring italics and spelling 'ous'), 61, 64 2 , 64 3 , 65, 67 1 ('of':'on'), 67 3 , 69, 71, 72 1 , 72 2 , 73, 75, 77, 79, 82 1 , 82 2 , 83 1 , 84, 86, 88, 89 1 , 90 2 , 92 1 (plural:singular), 92 3 , 96 1 ('of':'o'th'), 96 2 ('Fame':'Pomp'), 97, 98 1 , 99 (ignoring apostrophes), 100, 103 1 , 104 1 , 104 2 , 105 (' Herringman': 'Herringham'), 107, 108 2 , 109 2 , 110 1 , 110 2 (hyphenation), 111, 112 1 , 112 2 , 114 1 , 114 3 , 115, 117 1 (omitting 'Sense' and punctuation), 117 2 , 121 1 , 121 2 , 124 1 , 124 3 , 125, 126 2 , 128 1 , 128 2 , 132 ('admiring': 'advancing'), 134 1 , 134 2 , 136 1 ('of':'on'), 136 2 (punctuation after 'dullness'), 138 1 , 138 2 , 138 3 , 139 (plural:singular), 140, 141, 142, 143 1 (singular:plural), 143 2 , 144 1 ('paus'd':'said'), 144 2 , 144 3 ('cry d:'said'), 145 (punctuation after 'thus'), 146, 147, 148, 150 1 , 150 2 ('thy':'the'), 150 3 ('toyl':'Soul':'soil'), 151 2 , 152 1 ('Make':'Lett'), 152 2 (' Loveit ':'love it's'), 153 1 , 153 4 , 154, 155 1 , 155 2 , 157 2 , 157 3 , 159, 1601,160 2 , 161, 162 1 , 162 2 , 163 2 (ignoring spelling and dashes), 164 (omitting ' Epsom prose'), 165 3 , 167 1 ('and':'on th''), 167 2 ('and in each':'in every'), 168 1 , 168 2 , 169 1 , 169 2 , 170 1 , 170 2 (plural:singular), 175 1 , 175 2 , 175 3 , 176, 177 1 , 177 2 , 178 1 , 178 2 , 179 1 , 179 2 (ignoring italics), 180, 181 2 (ignoring italics), 182 ('dwindled':'windled'), 183 1 , 183 2 ,183 3 (ignoring italics and apostrophe), 184 1 , 184 3 , 185 1 , 185 2 , 185 3 , 185 4 , 187 1 , 187 2 , 188 1 , 188 2 , 189, 190, 191 1 , 191 2 , 191 3 , 192 1 , 192 2 , 193, 196 1 ('But': 'Yet'), 196 2 ('sure thou'rt but':'sure thou art':'thou art but'), 197, 198 1 , 198 2 , 199, 202 1 , 203 ('thee':'the'), 204, 207 (ignoring spelling), 208 ('Ten':'a'), 209 1 , 209 2 , 210 1 , 213 1 , 213 3 , 214 and 217. An examination of this list discloses that there are type-1 variations for each text, but it must be noted that there are none for 84 when I is present. It follows, according to the usual reasoning (see Greg, Calculus, p. 55), that I derives from 84; and accepting this relationship for the present we may ignore I for the time being, and turn our attention to the other texts. An analysis of the type-2 variations and of such of the complex variations as can be reduced to the simple types discloses no consistent pattern, except that of inconsistency. To put it another way, no group of texts occurs (I being now out of the question) from which all the others are excluded or almost always excluded. It is for this reason that Professor Evans, though he persists in thinking of his texts as falling into groups (pp. 43-45), devotes his attention almost exclusively to the instances where the readings in 84 are opposed by all or the majority of the other texts. It does not follow, however, as Professor Evans suggests that it does (pp. 43-44), that the edition of 1682 has no more authority than the manuscripts. Distributional study can indicate no more than something of the transmission of a literary text through or to its various exemplars. Decisions as to the authority of these exemplars must rest upon external evidence, in this case the long recognized corrupt state of the text in the 1682 edition (cf. Evans, p. 44, n. 18). Professor Evans uses the standard argument when he reasons from the corruptions in L that it did not emanate directly from the author (p. 33). Hill would interpret the variations listed above as indicating that the texts are collaterals independently derived from a common ancestor in the relationship called radiation. 2 Greg's logic allows him to assume simple radiation only when all the texts have type-I variations alone or almost alone; if other variations occur with any frequency he can see no course other than to assume some sort of conflation somewhere (Calculus, pp. 21, 56; 43). 3 Greg does not deal explicitly with chance coincidences, but Hill points out that they occur constantly and indicates something of how often any one may recur and still be accepted as chance (p. 77). The present set of variations, however, is not explicable as the result of chance coincidence or conflation or both. The proportion of chance or the amount of conflation or both would be unbelievably large, for only B agrees, in different variations, with as few as four of the other texts, and 84, L , and H agree in one variation or another with all the others. The only alternative, it would seem, is to accept the relationship of the texts as radiation and to explain the conflicting variations as resulting from authorial revisions, with perhaps some admixture of chance coincidence or conflation or both. Under the circumstances, it appears likely that I is a collateral instead of a descendant of 84, for in 177, 2 where 84 agrees with B, I agrees with the other texts, and Professor Evans mentions other details in which similar relationships may be observed (pp. 34; 41, variation 211 1). These details seem too many to explain as coincidence, and yet too minute to explain as conflation, and coincidence and conflation are last-ditch explanations in any event. Once it is seen, however, that Dryden allowed copies of his poem to be taken before it was published, and that he revised the text between these copies, then the differences between I and 84 are simply explicable as resulting from small final changes made before he sent his manuscript to the press in 1684.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II So far as I know, no general treatment of patterns of authorial revision has been attempted, and it will be well, therefore, before going further, to investigate what might be called its theory. There are three general types of revision that may occur: simple revision, which may be addition, rejection, or substitution; reverse revision, returning to the original reading; and continued revision, where a new revision is substituted for the rejected one. Combinations of two or all three types are also possible. Simple revision results from a single decision on the author's part (pattern ab), reverse revision from two (pattern aba), continued revision from two or more (pattern abc, abcd . . .), and combinations of types from three or more (simple and reverse: abab, ababa . . . ; continued and reverse: abac, abca, abcb . . .; all three: ababc . . .). In accordance with the concept of simplicity introduced by Hill, we may say that where there is a choice in postulating types of revision, the type resulting from the fewest decisions is, all other things being equal, to be preferred. Hill has maintained that the usefulness of distributional study is at an end when authorial revision has been established (p. 69), but this would appear to be generally true only when the study is intended as a help in establishing the genetic relationships of a group of texts. If the relationship can be established as radiation, the distributional evidence may continue to be of paramount importance, for by it it may be possible to range the texts in successive order from that representing the earliest recoverable state of revision to that representing the latest, or the reverse. The axioms governing the analysis of this order are as follows: Given that the texts are in radiational relationship, a reading found in only one may be taken to have resulted from copying rather than from revision, until the reverse can be proved. This is a restatement of what Greg calls the assumption of universal variation, "the process of transcription is characterized by variation, and it is only in the process of transcription that variant readings arise" ( Calculus, p. 8). Given that the texts are in radiational relationship, a reading found in two or more may be taken to have resulted from revision rather than from copying, until the reverse can be proved. This is a restatement of what Hill calls the postulate of unity, "it is more likely that unity of manuscripts represents unity in their source than that it represents coincidence" (p. 64). Unless there is evidence to the contrary, revisions may be taken to have been clearly indicated in writing (or by marks of deletion). This is a specific application of the assumption behind all textual analysis that there has been no memorial transmission (Greg, Calculus, p. 1, Hill, p. 69). The best arrangement of the texts will be that which will require the positing of the fewest decisions on the author's part to explain all the variations. This is a specific application of the concept of simplicity. It is at the same time obvious that such a simplification does not necessarily represent the facts; the author may well have changed his mind more often than was logically necessary to achieve his final revision. There is, therefore, always an appeal open from the distributional to other types of evidence, especially when the distributional evidence is not clear-cut. On the other hand, mere distrust of the results obtained is not sufficient to overthrow them, for unless there is evidence that the author was by nature undecided, we must fall hack on this fourth axiom; its opposite, that the texts should be arranged in such a way as to require the most possible decisions on the author's part, is contrary to reason and experience. As Hill puts it, in another connection, "the more complex [arrangements] are always unnecessary, and will never be used by a consistent student, no matter if there is a danger that later evidence might show him that his assumption of a simpler [arrangement] was actually false" (p. 92). As a preliminary to calculating the best arrangement of the texts the variations should be tabulated, using Greg's notation, with Σ: and its subscript and superscript sigla, so that their exact nature may be seen at a glance. Factoring the variations will often facilitate subsequent calculations. Since author's decisions are being measured, all readings found in only one text may be ignored, and since only these variations can occur where there are only two or three texts in question, it follows that the method is applicable only to four or more. In any single variation, arranging the variant texts together will always decrease the number of decisions that have to be posited, and dividing them will always increase it. The first step in the calculations, therefore, is to group together the texts with the greatest number of mutual agreements. Normally there will be only two texts in the group, for if there are to be more than two, each must agree equally often with at least two of the others. If two or more mutually exclusive groups are found to occur with equal frequency, that one to which more texts may be added has the priority. To this nucleus should be added any texts that agree with one of its members more often than with any others outside the group. If there are other texts which agree with the newly added members of the group more often than with any other texts outside it, they too may be added. When the group has been expanded as much as possible, the process is repeated with the ungrouped texts, and continued until all have been arranged in groups. These groups do not indicate any genetic relationship; that is already established as radiation; they are simply a mechanism for clarifying and simplifying calculation. If there are only two groups, their original nuclei should be placed at the extremities of the arrangement, as this will insure the greatest number of single-decision variations. To secure the greatest number of three-decision variations without lessening the possible number of those requiring only two decisions, that member of the nucleus should be placed at the extremity which agrees most often with texts outside the nucleus, unless it can be placed contiguous to a text with which it agrees more often than the difference between its outside agreements and those of the member of the nucleus having the next largest number. The remaining texts should be arranged so as to secure the greatest number of agreements between and among contiguous texts, for this will give the maximum number of two-decision variations. If there are more than two groups, all the possible arrangements of the groups must be tried, arranging the members of the terminal groups on the principles above, and the members of the inner group or groups so as to secure the maximum number of agreements between and among contiguous texts. In calculating the number of decisions required, special care must be taken when counting the variations where one or more texts are imperfect, for to count a text as present when it is in fact absent may add two to the number of decisions. Thus, in testing an order ABCDE, to read Σ D :CE as Σ:CE will result in the erroneous count AB/C/D/E. The same precaution must be taken when there are more than two alternate readings in a variation, especially when some or all of the additional readings occur in only one text apiece. It is, by the way, unnecessary and indeed useless to speculate on the readings in the missing portions of imperfect manuscripts; we can work only with what we have, and to refuse to employ the talent that is given us is to remain in willful ignorance. Once the desired order has been established, distributive study is at an end. To determine which extremity of the arrangement of the texts represents the latest recoverable stage of revision must be left to external or literary study, preferably the former. Dates of copying the texts, even if determinable, are meaningless, as always, for there is no assurance that they were copied from the author's original. On the other hand, reasoning may be possible if one or more of the texts is, or has as a descendant, a printed version. Once a work is in print, interested persons will normally prefer buying the book to copying the author's manuscript, unless the author is known to be still improving it. A printer will normally choose printed over manuscript copy. And an author is not likely to sanction the publishing of an early revision of his book if a later one is already in print. Where external evidence fails, one will normally assume that the more satisfactory of the terminal texts, so far as he can judge of it, is the later. Complete proof that the order and its direction are correct is impossible, but the likelihood may be demonstrated pragmatically by showing that the variations fall into consistent patterns and that they suggest or allow reasonable interpretations for a maximum number of individual variations. Included in the interpretation should be a careful investigation of readings found only in the final text, since, the pattern of revision having been established, these readings may no longer be dismissed as unauthoritative. Once the order and its direction have been established, the texts are, in a sense, no longer in a radiational relationship, for, as Greg points out, a text which has been revised is tantamount to a transcript of the unrevised form (Calculus, p. 8, n. 2). This fact reminds us that while it is especially tempting when dealing with authorial revisions to think of the ancestor of the extant texts as the author's original manuscript, the original is in fact irrecoverable. The author may even have made a new copy each time he revised-if many of the revisions are of the complex kinds it is quite likely that he made a clean copy at least once-and while we have some idea of the alterations of the text as it passed through various stages we can have no certainty that we have recovered all of these or the state of the text before, or, if the author did not publish the work, after revision. If we think of the revisions as the same as transcripts, the tree which results is identical with one indicating successive variation, but reached in this fashion there are no anomalous variations. Any decision that some of the variants are the result of chance coincidence or conflation will have to be estimated by some other method than distributional study. It is, therefore, of some interest to examine into the likelihood of the occurrence of the various patterns of revision. The Cambridge manuscript of Milton's minor poems shows for his sonnets, besides a number of simple revisions, some of the patterns aba (XIII, 4, 5; XIV, 9) and abc (IX, 7; XIV, 9), with variants abbc (XI, 10) and abbcc (XIII, 3), and one more complicated, abcb (XII, 10). 4 Milton is more likely to reverse his revisions than to continue them, though on two occasions in Comus we find abcd (351,833); and he often combines the two processes, so that in Comus again besides the common aba and abc we find abac (389), abaca (554),abca (254), abcbc (544), and abcada (a canceled passage following line 4). Pope's penchant for revision is notorious; the editors of the Twickenham edition of his poems preferred not to try to indicate the variant readings in his manuscripts. To take a random example, if the opening couplet of the Essay on Man, Epistle II, quoted from the Harvard and Morgan manuscripts by Professor Sherburn, be compared with the textual notes in the Twickenham edition, 5 it will be seen that beside two changes of the pattern ab in the first line there is one aba ('then thyself'/'we ourselves'/'then thyself'), another aba in the second line ('study'/'science'/ 'study'), and a more complicated pattern, abcdce at the beginning of that line ('And know the'/'But know the'/'The only'/'Convinced the'/'The only'/'The proper'). Finally, to go no farther than the end of the eighteenth century, the manuscript of Blake's 'The Tiger,' taken with the first edition, 6 shows the pattern ab in lines 3, 15, 16, and 19, aba in lines 4, 5, 6, 13, 16, 19, and 20, abab in line 19, and aabcb in line 15. This cursory survey indicates that the patterns of revision may be of almost any nature, and that it would be unwise to reject any in advance as unlikely to occur.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Before proceeding to investigate Mac Flecknoe further, it should be said that we possess none of Dryden's working manuscripts. We do not even have a holograph fair copy of any of his poems) except for the verses sent in a letter to his cousin Honor. We do have manuscript versions of several of his poems written before or about the time of Mac Flecknoe which indicate that the printed texts are only the -final polishing of works that were in private circulation earlier, and in the case of prologues and epilogues perhaps even in public circulation. But for none of these do we have more than three texts in radiational relationship to their common ancestor, and so it is impossible to reason about Dryden's methods of revision beyond the obvious likelihood, amounting normally to certainty, that he did make simple changes of the pattern ab. We have no record of the amount of polishing to which Dryden subjected his work before he sent it to the press. We can have, then, no preconceptions as to Dryden's methods of composition. Following is a tabulation of the variants significant to this investigation: These factors are entered below in the appropriate places and marked with an 'f.' The group occurring most often is L C, and no other texts are to be added to it. The next most frequently occurring group is 82 M , and to this group B may be added. The next most frequent grouping is 84 I , and to this group F may be added, and H added next. Arranging the groups according to the principles given above results in the alternatives 82 M B L C H F I 84, M 82 B H 84 I (or I 84) F L C, and C L M 82 B H 1 84. The total of decisions required in the first arrangement is 167, in the second 160, in the third 159. The first of the alternatives, requiring 5% more decisions than either of the others, may with some confidence be rejected. This is the limit, in the present instance, to which distributive study will take us. The direction of revision in the remaining alternate arrangements of the texts is from left to right, as the positions of the editions of 1682 and 1684 make clear. The second arrangement would indicate that Dryden had continued with considerable revisions of the poem, and yet had not felt it worth while to have them inserted in the reprints issued by his publisher. The third arrangement is therefore the more likely on external grounds. It is also the more attractive on internal or literary grounds, for the more obvious errors appear more regularly in contiguous texts, and the apparently later readings are in general more attractive. The following remarks, the assume that the progress of Dryden's revisions is most accurately shown when the texts are in the order C L M 82 B H F I 84, without arguing the case in detail. Simple revisions (pattern ab) occur in 11 2 , 33 2 , 42 2 , 55 2 , 79, 117 2 , 140, 141, 150 3 , 159, 178 2 , 181 2 , 189, 190, 204, 207, and 209 2 . Other variations treated in the distributional analysis as involving only a single decision are seen, once the arrangement of the texts is established, to be part of larger patterns of revision, and will therefore be discussed below. They occur in 33 3 , 144 3 , 176, 178 1 , and 185 2 . In the following quotations accidentals have been normalized. Several of the simple revisions appeal at once as genuine corrections or improvements. The substitution of 'sense' for 'verse' (55 2 ) seems pretty certainly a correction, since the phrase 'in numbers as in verse' is tautological The substitution of 'altars' for 'trophies' (207) results in a more accurate description of the verse-forms upon which Dryden is animadverting. The substitution of 'one' for 'each' (190) corrects a quotation from Shadwell. It is true that 'thy mind' is a less accurate quotation of Shadwell than 'the mind' (189, cf. Evans, p. 51), but here the unaltered quotation is awkward in the sentence Dryden has constructed. At the same time, he was apparently content to let the full quotation stand for some time. Less certain are a number of shifts from singular to plural. Since Shadwell can compose, sing and play the lute, perhaps these are better described as 'talents' than lumped together as a 'talent' (209 2 ). The substitution of 'arts' for 'art' may similarly sharpen the idea of Shadwell's ignorance (178 2 ). It is perhaps better to speak of Fletcher in 'buskins' instead of 'buskin' (79), especially if Jonson is to appear in 'socks' just below. Metaphors are difficult of analysis, but it might be argued that 'mild anagram,' instead of 'kind anagram' (204), implies a lack of control of one's medium consistent with the idea of Shadwell's dullness. It is also, perhaps, a completer antithesis to 'keen iambic' in the same line. Professor Evans remarks on the attractiveness of 'soil' rather than 'toil' in another metaphor (150 3 , cf. Evans, p. 50), and it would indeed appear that Dryden did not abandon his earlier reading until a fairly late stage of revision. Dryden's ear may have suggested to him that 'blankets tossed' was preferable to 'blanket tossed' (42 2 ), but such an argument is not very forceful, for if he avoided a hiatus by preferring 'to future' over 'to after' (159, cf. Evans, p. 46), he introduced another by changing 'mine' to 'my' (181 2 ), and as may be seen from some of the more complex revisions, he apparently hesitated fairly often over matters of this kind. Matters of grammar are similarly inconclusive, for if Dryden substituted 'nor' for 'or' after 'Ne'er' (117 2 ), he abandoned the subjunctive 'were' for 'was' after 'pond'ring' (11 2 ), and the more complex revisions show that this inconsistency is characteristic. The reasons for changing 'clothed' to 'clad' (33 2 ), 'fair' to 'far' (140, cf. Evans, p. 50), and 'dominions' to 'dominion' (141) are not beyond all conjecture, but they suggest nothing that would be likely to carry wide conviction. Reversed revisions (pattern aba) occur in 37, 53, 58, 82 2 , 97, 98 1 , 151 2 , 157 2 , 157 3 , 162 2 , 167 2 , 168 2 , 180, 183 1 , 187 1 , 213 3 , and 217. Two others, 46 and 56 2 , are part of larger patterns of revision. No reason suggests itself for most of these, but it is of some interest to observe the different shades of meaning or possible misunderstanding resulting in three of them, those in 97, 162 2 , and 187 1 . The decision between 'bore' and 'wore' (58) would seem to have depended on whether 'lute' or 'sword' was felt to govern the verb. The indecision over 'St. Andre's' and 'St. Andrew's' (53) is paralleled in even greater indecisions over 'Vilerius' and 'Valeri(o)us' (59 2 , pattern abab) and 'Nicander's' and 'Alcander's' (179 2 , pattern ababa, cf. Evans, p. 53). Apparently Dryden's memory was uncertain of these names, but he took the trouble to get them right for the edition of 1684. Three of these readings are not strictly the result of two decisions on the author's part, for the readings of 'varnished' for 'vanished' (82 2 , cf. Evans, p. 45, n. 19), 'durst' for 'dust' (180) and 'declining' for 'declaiming' (213 3 , cf. Evans, p. 53) make nonsense, or at best an unsatisfactory sense, of the passages. As they all occur in at least two contiguous texts, they seem to indicate that the ancestor had become illegible at these places for a time, or that they are slips of Dryden's pen as he copied his original which he over-looked as he made successive copies. Another passage that may have become difficult to decipher is 165 3 , where for 'cull' H reads 'smell' and F reads 'pull.' The four other variations of this pattern are associated in pairs. Two, 157 2 and 157 3 , combine to produce three alternate readings, 'by thy own,' 'of thy own,' and 'by thine own,' the first being returned to after the second and again after the third. No reason appears for the changes, nor for the more striking series of changes in 167 2 and 168 2 . Ignoring the other substantive variations, the lines appear to have been altered as follows: But write thy best and top, and in each line Sir Formal's oratory will be thine. C L But write thy best and top, and in each line Sir Formal's oratory wit be thine. M 82 But write thy best and top in every line, Sir Formal's oratory wit be thine B H But write thy best, and top,(;) and in each line, Sir Formal's oratory will be thine. F I 84 So that we find Dryden returning to his original form after a wide excursion. Combinations of simple and reverse revision in the pattern abab occur in 12, 14, 29 2 , 39 1 , 44 2 , 54 1 , 59 2 , 65, 92 3 , 96 2 , 111, 115, 124 1 , 136 1 , 138 2 , 143 1 , 160 1 , 177 2 , and 185 1 . The pattern ababa is found in 50 3 , 71, 107, 175 2 , 179 2 , 196 2 , 203 and 208, and the pattern ababab occurs in 183 3 . Those in 59 2 and 179 2 (Vilerius, Nicander) have been discussed above. Those in 50 3 , 96 2 , 136 1 , and 177 2 are better discussed in company with other variations as examples of continued revision. And many of the others defy analysis, either as to the reason for the original revision or as to why there was any question about it once made. It should perhaps be emphasized that there is nothing in this situation to make it an unlikely one, as a glance again at Blake's revisions of 'The Tiger' will make clear. One of the variations, the substitution of 'the' for 'thee' (203, cf. Evans p. 45, n. 20) in 82 and H, is almost certainly the result of chance coincidence in error. It is also tempting, but not strictly necessary, so to interpret the apparent constant wavering between 'Fletcher's' and 'Fletcher' (183 3), where either will apparently make equally good sense. On occasion it is possible to assess the attractions for one or other of the alternate readings. Thus, in 12, an 'immortal war' may be an endless one, while 'immortal wars' can only be ever-memorable. In 14, the decision for 'who' over 'that,' or the reverse, seems to reflect varying attitudes toward the logic of gender, similar to the indecision in 923 as to whether the man ('he') or the instrument ('it') is more strongly felt in the words 'his pen' in the line above. Professor Evans has remarked on the attractiveness of the metaphor 'well-tuned oars' (39 1 , cf. Evans, p. 51), and it is not perhaps surprising to find Dryden hesitating before abandoning it for 'well-timed oars.' The eventual decision for 'Kingdom' over 'kingdoms' (143 1 , cf. Evans, p. 53) shows Dryden abandoning a sly allusion with some regret. His apparently greater indecision between 'throne' and 'state' (107) may possibly reflect a fear on the one hand that the former might be taken in its slang sense, under the influence of line 101 just above, and on the other a dislike of using the latter when it was to be the rhyme word two lines below. Line 185 has, besides the complex revision 'transfuse': transfused,' a simple change from 'oils' to 'oil.' Professor Evans remarks that the passage 'has always caused difficulties,' and proposes to emend the standard text at the latter, if not both places (pp. 46-47). It is more likely that the earlier editors were not emending the text here so much as handing on a corruption introduced in 1716, and while Christie and Sargeaunt certainly made difficulties, Noyes, easily the best of Dryden's more recent editors, found plain sailing. It seems quite possible that 'transfuse' was considered for a time because of 'transfuse' in the line above, which is the reason it appeals to Professor Evans, and reasonably certain that 'oil' was adopted because of the singular verbs in the line below. 7 We may turn finally to those variations which show Dryden continuing to improve his poem through several revisions. In four instances, 33 3 , 56 2 (when taken with 54 5 , 55 1 and 55 3 ), 88, and 144 3 (taken with 144 1 ), the revisions proceed without interruption, but in the others, 46, 50 3 (taken with 50 2 ), 96 2 (taken with 96 1 , 136 1 (taken with 136 2 ), 175 3 and 176, 177 2 and 178 1 , and 196 2 , there is an admixture of reverse revision. In the following quotations, only those variants which are pertinent to the discussion at hand are reproduced, the rest of the text being normalized. In 33 3 , Crusty drugget' ( L ) gives place to 'drugget russet' ( M 82 ), which in turn becomes 'rustic drugget' (B F, taking His 'Russell drugget' as a corruption), supplanted in its turn by the 'Norwich drugget' of 84. The final version) of course, adds a further dig at Shadwell, who was born near Norwich. Lines 54-56 (cf. Evans, pp. 51-52) offer a complicated array of punctuational variations that may be summarized as follows: M and H have no punctuation; C , L , and 82 , having uniformly heavier terminal punctuation in lines 54 and 56 than in line 55, connect the two latter; F , having no punctuation in line 54, line 55 in parens, and a semi-colon at the end of line 56, connects the first and third; and 84 , having a colon at the end of line 54, a semi-colon at the end of line 55, and a comma at the end of line 56, gives line 55 something of the feeling of an interjection, as in F, but connects line 56 to line 57. Apparently dissatisfaction with the shifted tense in line 55 (forced by the rhyme) had something to do with the change. In F the difficulty is resolved by making line 55 parenthetical. In 84, it is resolved by making 'they' in line 56 refer to 'papers' in line 52 instead of 'feet' in line 54. The second solution also makes natural use of the fact that line 56 begins 'So' and line 57 'That,' a circumstance always likely to cause confusion when line 56 as well as lines 53-55 interrupted the connection between lines 52 and 57. In 88, 'place' ( L C ) gives way to 'isle' ( M 82 H), which gives way to 'pile' (F 84). 'Isle' seems to be the least satisfactory reading, and if one does not wish to credit Dryden with having failed consistently to improve his work, it may be argued that he changed 'place' to the more vivid 'pile' by crossing out only 'lace' and writing 'ile' above 'ile' (a normal variant spelling of 'isle') being taken by a series of copyists as a revision of tile whole word. Finally, line 144 shows a consistent evolution in vividness of expression: He said, and all the people said, Amen. C He paus'd, and all the people said, Amen. L He paus'd, and all the people cry'd, Amen. the rest In 46 (cf. Evans, p. 49) the lack of punctuation in L and M (normal for M) leaves the meaning ambiguous, 82 provides one alternative, 'the treble squeaks for fear, the basses roar,' B, H and F the other, 'the treble squeaks, for fear the basses roar,' and 84 returns to the reading of 82. No reason appears for the alternation between the last two readings. Line 50 (cf. Evans, p. 51) shows the following development: As at the morning tide that floats along C As at the morning, toast that floats along, L, B H, 84 As at the morning toast that wafts along M, F The reading in 82 , 'And gently waft the over all along,' would appear to be simply a corruption of the third version of the line. The alternation between 'floats' anti 'wafts' ( M and 82 falling between L and B, F between H and 84) may have resulted from dissatisfaction with the echo introduced by the substitution of 'toast' for 'tide.' Line 96 shows the following development, best explained in context with the two preceding lines: Now Empress Fame had published the renown Of Shadwell's coronation through the town. Roused by report o' th' pomp, the nations meet C Roused by report of Pomp, the nations meet L M 82, F Roused by report of Fame, the nations meet H ,84 Changing 'o' th'' to 'of' resulted in the personification of 'Pomp,' and so introduced an inconsistency into the lines. Perhaps Dryden's apparent hesitancy in substituting 'Fame' for 'Pomp' ( F falling between H and 84 ) indicates that he felt some awkwardness in using the name twice in such quick succession. Line 136 (cf. Evans, pp. 49-50) must be discussed in relation to the lines immediately above and below: And from his brows damps of oblivion shed, Full of the filial dullness long he stood, Repelling from his breast the raging god. C ... shed; [a blank ] dullness long he stood Repelling... L ... shed Full on the filial dullness long he stood Repelling... M ... shed: Full of the filial dullness long he stood, Repelling... 82 ... shed Full of the filial dullness long he stood- Repelling... H ...shed, Full on the filial dullness long he stood Repelling... F ... shed Full on the filial dullness: long he stood, Repelling... 84 The punctuation in H is simply inconsistent. It is normal for M to have no punctuation, so its variant tells us nothing. The state of L suggests that Dryden had improved the punctuation to fit the reading 'of' and then changed 'of' to 'on,' without repointing the lines, so that the copyist, unlike the copyist of F , was stumbled by the inconsistency. A similar delay on Dryden's part in making his punctuation fit his other revisions appears to have occurred in line 175. The punctuation in line 175 is connected with a simple revision in line 176. There appear to be four versions of the couplet that should be distinguished: Thou art my blood, where Jonson has no part For what have we in nature or in art? C L Thou art my blood, where Jonson has no part, What share have we in nature or in art? M 82 B H Thou art my blood, where Jonson has no part What share have we in nature or in art? F Thou art my blood, where Jonson has no part; What share have we in nature or in art? I 84 M and H are grouped with 82 and B because, having no punctuation at all in line 175 (normal for them), their reading is like that of the other two texts ambiguous. On the whole it seems more likely that the punctuation in F is the transcriber's, indicating that the punctuation of the ancestor was still ambiguous, than that Dryden experimented with alternate readings. What probably happened was that he changed line 176 without at once seeing that he would have to supply emphatic punctuation at the end of the line above to preserve his original meaning clear. Two other variants, 177 2 and 178 1 , combine as follows (cf. Evans, pp.50-51) Where did his wit or learning fix a brand? Or rail at arts he did not understand? C L M 82 , H F Where did his wit on learning fix a brand? Or rail at arts he did not understand? B Where did his wit or learning fix a brand, And rail at arts he did not understand? I Where did his wit on learning fix a brand, And rail at arts he did not understand? 84 Here it seems possible that Dryden was dissatisfied with the repetition of 'or'; changed the first 'or' to 'on' ( B ); but decided against it (H F); then changed the second to 'And'; and then keeping the second change, went back to the other also. Finally, in 196 2 , we may see Dryden wavering between 'sure thou art' (C L, 82 B H) and 'thou art but' ( M, F), and resolving his difficulties by combining his alternates into 'sure thou'rt but' ( I 84 ). The foregoing series of developing revisions offers convincing evidence that the order of texts chosen is indeed the most nearly correct one that reasoning will enable us to discover. It raises in addition the question of whether the type-1 variations in 84 may not also be the result of revision. In the usual textual relationships, it might reasonably be contended, with Greg, that the possibility of compositor's errors should be considered, and that indifferent or inexplicable, as well as manifestly inferior or uncharacteristic readings should be rejected ('Rationale,' p. 32). But we have seen that Dryden was revising his poem to the very last-even, in details, subsequent to the state of the text found in l and a large proportion of these revisions are apparently inexplicable or indifferent. We must insist, therefore, that the type-I variations in 84 be manifestly inferior or uncharacteristic before we reject them. In the list with which we began, there are six of these readings, 54 5 , 64 2 , 126 2 , 136 2 , 139, and 145, and Professor Evans (p. 48) calls attention also to a spelling variant in line 108. As we have seen, two variants, 54 5 and 136 2 , are improvements; 64 2 , 126 2 , 139, and 145 are indifferent. Professor Evans ( ib. ) urges that line 145 be emended, but the opening words of the line, if they are taken as part of Flecknoe's speech, may be interpreted either as a further adjuration to the 'heavens,' or, better, as pointing Shadwell to the methods of advancement retailed in the succeeding couplets. The reading of 'sat' for 'sate' in line 108, on the other hand, is both inferior (it rhymes with 'fate') and uncharacteristic (Dryden prefers perfect to imperfect rhymes), and therefore, as Professor Evans notes, should be altered by a careful editor. There is an additional possibility. If the type for 84 was set from a copy of 82 that had been corrected by the author, we might expect to find that certain readings had been left uncorrected. The process is mechanically the reverse of conflation, but the results are the same. Only those readings which do not appear in any texts intermediate between 82 and 84 may be considered, for all the rest were clearly still under consideration at a period subsequent to the state of the text represented by 82. There are three of these variations, 46, 59 2 , and 138 2 , but the reading of 82 and 84 in 59 2 is right, and those in 46 and 138 2 apparently indifferent. There is no evidence for conflation of any of the other texts. The very considerable importance of Professor Evans's collations would seem to lie, then, not so much in their possible use in emending the text of 1684 as in their indication for the first time of Dryden's methods of composition. Until Professor Evans had published his essay, materials for such a study were almost totally lacking, nor was there even any collected account of the manuscripts which he has assembled. The present investigation has sought to determine how far the standard methods of textual criticism might by suitable modifications be fitted to deal with this new and at first glance intractable body of data. It is to be hoped that inasmuch as two new scholarly editions of Dryden are now in progress, the whole subject may be canvassed to the full.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Quadruple Imposition: An Account of Goldsmith's Traveller by William B. Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EARLIEST version of Goldsmith's first poem, The Traveller, appears in a series of quarto half-sheets discovered and reproduced by Bertram Dobell in 1902 and now deposited under press C.58.g.7 at the British Museum. Three of these unique sheets (B--D) are leaded between lines, spaced between paragraphs, numbered throughout, and headed A PROSPECT OF SOCIETY, a reference later used as the sub-title of the published edition. The fourth (E) contains only text, signature, and catchwords, all set solid at the top of each page, but of an appropriate number of lines, in each instance, so that the letter when spaced and headed would exactly fill the page. Whereas the peculiar form of E is not without significance, it has been generally disregarded in the light of an even more remarkable aberration occurring throughout the text. Instead of running forward, this regresses in nine sections, commencing at B1 r -2 r with lines 351-392 and concluding on E2 v with lines 73-90. 1 The orderly derangement of the sections was first noticed by A. T. Quiller-Couch who, in his review of Dobell's reprint, thereupon offered a plausible explanation. As Goldsmith finishing writing out each page of his poem for press he laid it aside, on top of the page preceding . . . and, when all was done, he forgot . . . to sort back the pages in reverse order. That is all; given a good stolid compositor with no desire but to do his duty with the manuscript as it reached him, you have . . . an immortal poem printed wrong-end-foremost page by page. And I call the result delightful, and, when you come to think of it, just the blunder so natural to Goldsmith as to be almost postulable. 2 Though I agree with Quiller-Couch that his hypothesis is "ridiculously simple" much simpler than any I may propose-further reflection leads me to doubt Williams' belief that it offers "the true explanation" and to deny Dobell's assertion that it "accounts for all the peculiarities of the first version." 3 One considerable oversight involves lines 1-72, 91-100, and sixteen lines after 392, all present in The Traveller, all omitted here. Probably the last sixteen were added in revision, but the earlier lines, or something equivalent to them, must have been prepared for the original printing. Another matter casually dismissed as "fairly regular" is the unequal length of the sections in this version, a length ranging (in order of writing) from 18 lines in the first group, to 28 in the next, to an average of 36 in the next five, to a maximum of 42 in the last two. If each of these represents a page of copy, then we must suppose that Goldsmith wrote (1) in ever smaller script on paper of equal size, (2) in even script on larger and larger paper, or (3) in even script on paper of uniform size but more and more on one side of the page and then more and more on the other. None of these inconsistencies is observed in Goldsmith's practice. 4 A third problem left unresolved concerns the extraordinary imposition of sheet E. As this apparently anticipates the later arrangement evident in B-D it must reflect an earlier operation in press-work and may not, therefore, be envisaged in any "simple" explanation. Whatever the status of the one sheet, it differs from that of the others. Another and more promising theory is the one originating with A. E. Case and briefly noted by R. S. Crane. 5 This suggests that the disarrangement results from an error in make-up-a hypothesis which, as Professor Crane has since explained to me, presumes the use of galleys. Until recently it was believed that long galleys were introduced not before the nineteenth century, 6 but Mr. Philip Gaskell has now shown that as early as 1773 William Mason was reading "Folio Proofs" for the quarto volume of Gray's Poems published two years later at York. 7 If this practice was common among provincial printers in 1773 it probably was not unknown to London printers in 1764. Like Mason, then, Goldsmith may also have read "Folio Proofs"-or something like them-revised these for press and, conceivably, approved the ordered "Folio" version before it was disordered in quarto make-up. Before venturing too far with this last conjecture, we should first deter- mine the kind and number of proofs submitted to the author. Since the layout of sheet E indicates, as already mentioned, an earlier stage in the printing, it is likely that the earliest proofs were, like this, set solid, ordinarily contained 36 lines each (the average length of the sections as later imposed), and therefore measured, at 6mm. a solid line, a total of 216mm. Such proofs, though comprising almost twice the letter of a spaced quarto page, would extend only 6mm. beyond the total measure of that page (i.e., letter plus heading and direction) and still allow a 79mm. margin for any additions supplied in revision. 8 From their limited extent these proofs would appear to be, not "slips" or "folios" in the strict sense of these terms, but short quarto galleys set in frames sufficiently large to accommodate single page work and sufficiently thin to be machined without any special adjustment of the press. 9 If the proof was originally of this kind it probably represented, in more equal portions, more lines of text than now appear in the quarto set-up, either of the E or B-D impositions. These printed sheets exhibit eight full sections and part of another. Of these, the last full section extends from line 101 at the middle of E1 v to line 128 at the foot of E2 r . Then on E2 v , the last page of the series, the part section begins with line 73 and ends with line 90. Below 90 is the catchword "Each", an obvious indication that the remainder of this section, 91-100 (corresponding to 93-102 in The Traveller), was in galley and intended for imposition in 1 r of the unprinted sheet F . The complete section, then, like the one that immediately precedes it, consists of 28 lines. Besides 91-100 the extant printing also omits lines 1-72, an exact multiple of 36, and therefore probably of two standard sections designated for the remainder of F. In inverse order of printing, and with due allowance for spacing, the first of these would range from line 37 at the middle of F 1 r to 72 at the top of 2 r , the second from line 1 at the top of 2 r to 36 at the foot of 2 v . With F reassembled on the pattern of E the sequence is complete, and all sections may now be reversed to show the original arrangement in galleys. As illustrated in the accompanying table, there were apparently eleven of these, all correctly ordered and presenting a consecutive text. Of the eleven four depart from average, two as a pair of 28 lines each, two as another pair of 42. Very probably the shorter pair was originally composed as a single galley of 36 lines to which the author then added 20 more, far too many to be held in one frame and therefore evenly divided in two. Possibly the larger pair represents a similar distribution; or it may be that the compositor, realizing that he had only 84 lines to go, set his letter in two equal sections instead of running it out to three. In either event, though longer (folio?) frames would be required for this pair, each of the proofs could still be accommodated-with 33mm. to spare-on a separate quarto leaf. So far, the presumption that all type was originally set in galleys has resolved two of the three questions undecided in the Quiller-Couch hypothesis. For one I surmise that the unprinted lines appeared in the initial proof, and there according to an evident pattern. For the second I argue that occasional deviations from pattern imply some mechanical division easily devised in composition but hardly to be imagined in manuscript. For the third question, on the relation of E to the preceding sheets, I defer comment until I describe certain other unnoticed peculiarities. All of these are best considered in a chronological review of the work in the printing shop. Goldsmith's copy, when delivered to the printer, was split at the end of the paragraph at line 202, approximately midway in the text, and assigned to two compositors, A and B, who then set galleys 1-6 and 7-10 respectively. From the evidence of the spelling it would seem that It, the last galley, though of that portion which normally would have gone to B, was partially set by A or eventually finished by a third compositor C. 10 'A' lines 1-202 'B' lines 203-350 'C'? lines 351-392 chear [13], 181, 189 cheer 217, 271 splendour [45], 86 splendor 373 honor 86 honour 252, 253, 304, 342 honor 352 'Till [93] Till 220, 260, 347 This tabulation also shows that the unprinted lines-now evident only as finally imposed in The Traveller- were originally set by the compositor to whom they properly belong. Hence we discover still another indication of the previous existence of these lines in the original imposition. As the type was set the galleys were printed, rinsed, and then stored in a rack to await Goldsmith's emendation; and when this was received they were again processed and again stored, we may conjecture, to await his final approval of the text. Not on the first round but apparently on the last, the galleys were accidentally reversed so that, as they lay in the rack pending the second imposition, the eleventh galley was in the position of the first. 11 If the author read the original series of proofs, the second sequence in quarto make-up must have been prepared for the corrector. Of this sequence only E is extant, the one sheet set solid, like the earlier proof, but now disposed in pages so that the corrector might check layout and punctuation. Both in E and in B-D (now evident only in the third imposition) the corrector had much to do, for as the galleys were inversely disposed he soon discovered that the final line of one occasionally bore no grammatical relation to the initial line of the next. 12 First in galley 9 and thereafter in 7 and 4 he accordingly adjusted the pointing to join the disparate parts. As determined from the correct pointing again introduced in the reimposed Traveller, each of these galleys originally began with a new paragraph (at lines 275, 203, and 101 respectively), each following in a preceding galley another logically complete in itself. In inverted order, however, these paragraphs interrupted others uncompleted in the preceding sections, and were therefore joined to them. Page / Galley / Line C1 r 10 350 And statesmen toil, and poets pant for fame; 9 27 To men of other minds my fancy flies, 276 Embosom'd in the deep where Holland lies, D1 r 8 274 The solid transports of internal praise. 7 203 These are the charms to barren states assign'd; 204 Their wants are few, their wishes all confin'd.

Only the three, then, directly implicate the corrector at points where only he would intervene* where he must intervene to construct a continuous text; and as these three are conveniently dispersed one to a sheet, they allow us the inference not only that the text was originally approved but, in this second imposition, that it was eventually "corrected" for press. If, as we have now demonstrated, proof sheet E is of an intermediate form used by the corrector, then sheets B, C, and D, all obviously of a third imposition, must represent finished work at press. In every respect these three sheets appear to be in their final state: in leading and spacing, in the headtitle and initial letter provided for the first page, and in the numbers and headlines supplied for all succeeding pages. 14 What is so apparent I therefore accept as the last and most evident fact that all sheets, in one form or another, were destined for issue. From every indication A Prospect of Society should thus be described, not as a random essay, nor as an uncorrected proof, but as an abortive edition, well conceived, badly bungled, and finally suppressed. All that remains of it now are these several sheets, in several stages of preparation. Once this blunder was discovered the letter was transposed, revised, sup- plemented by several couplets and a new concluding paragraph-this last largely from the pen of Samuel Johnson 15 -and the whole again impressed, in its fourth imposition, for issue as The Traveller, Or a Prospect of Society. Though the text of this remains invariant, in the first published edition, the preliminaries appear in four different states, two without and two with half-titles. As these also have been erroneously described, our account may properly conclude with a record of the last of many extraordinary efforts to bring forth Goldsmith's earliest poem.

Williams, Seven XVIIIth Century Bibliographies (1924), pp. 133-134. 4 For manuscripts of any length (Goldsmith ordinarily wrote on foolscap paper in a hand averaging (with spacing) 8mm. to a line. One contemporaneous with the Prospect (CSmH, Preface and Introduction to the History of the Seven Years' War c.1761) is a folio in twos, written throughout on both sides of the leaf, and containing about 37 lines to the page. Another of the same period (NNP, The Captivity, c.1764) is in quarto half-sheets, written throughout on one side only, and averaging 25 lines to the page. For his correspondence, on the other hand (as judged by 1 letter at NNP, 4 at MH), Goldsmith consistently used post quarto half-sheets. 5 CBEL, II, 641-42. 6 McKerrow (p. 66) cites as the earliest reference Savage's Dictionary of Printing, l841; but earlier reports, in this century, appear in (1) Johnson's Typographia, 1824, II, 193, 587; (2) the Inventory of the Glasgow University Printing Office, 1826 (reproduced by the Water Lane Press, Cambridge, 1953), which accounts for "51 Mahogany Galleys-32 Fir Galleys"; the 1832 report of the Union Society of Compositors (Ellic Howe, The London Compositor [1947], p. 195), which refers to the pulling and correcting of "slips and galleys". 7 The First Editions of William Mason, Cambridge, 195l, p. 18. Even earlier than this-but possibly of little significance for English printers-is a reference to galley proof for the 12 "Neaulme, Amsterdam" [Duchesne, Paris] edition of Rousseau's Emile, 1762. See P. H. Muir's account in The Book Collector, I (1952), 68-69. 8 An uncut copy of The Traveller in the Berg Collection measures 295 x 228mm. 9 "Slips", as defined by Savage (cited in Howe, op. cit., p. 177), are of "the length and half the breadth of a demy leaf of paper," i.e. , of half-sheets divided lengthwise in strips measuring 451 x 279 mm. These presumably are the "folios" to which Mason refers, a series of proofs necessarily longer than those required for the Goldsmith quarto (since Mason's work remained unleaded), and struck from long, thick wooden galleys (cf. fn. 6) on a press especially reserved for this purpose. As Mr. Gaskell reminds me, the use of such galleys in a press set for ordinary printing would be a great nuisance, requiring first a considerable adjustment of the platen cheek mortices and headbolts, and then a readjustment of all these before normal work could proceed. 10 Brackets enclose readings unprinted in the Prospect but evident in The Traveller. To simplify this account I enter only the stem of the word, ignoring prefixes and the like. 11 For other probable reversals, not of galleys but of formes, see my account in Studies in Bibliography, III (1950), 184-191. In these examples, of course, the text remains unaffected, whatever the order of printing. 12 If as Dr. Walker has shown (Studies in Bibliography, VI [1953], 58), a corrector was occasionally concerned only that letters should make a word and not that words should make sense, we may excuse (indeed, applaud!) the example of this corrector in leaving to the author the meaning of his lines and drawing to himself only the responsibility of pointing the text. Even in this distorted form the lines make sense, of a kind-as much certainly as the Shakespearian motley constructed by Harvey Breit or the modern mess compounded by Lord Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett Dunsany. See NYTBR, January 24, 1954, p. 8. 13 Some 22 in fact. See notes to my edition. 14 Unfortunately press figures and skeletons, the two most obvious signs of successive impression, are not used either in this printing or in the first published edition. 15 In a copy of the poem which Boswell tendered him in 1783 (a pirated '1770' edition: see my note under 'C', Studies in Bibliography , VI [1953], 41), Johnson marked nine lines as all that he could recollect as being his. These, in the first edition, are 398, 407-l2, 415-116. Nonetheless, Johnson told Reynolds on an earlier occasion (Boswell, Life of Johnson, ed. Hill-Powell, II, 6, n.3) that he might have revised as many as eighteen; and from the collation given in my edition of the Prospect it would seem that even this number may be an underestimate.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Parisian Panel Stamps between 1480 and 1530 by Ernst Kyriss *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE DESCRIPTIONS in this paper are based on rubbings taken by the writer since 1929, mainly in south German libraries. The fact that such a relatively small number of Parisian panel stamps from this period have appeared in the approximately 36,000 early bindings I have examined must be considered evidence for their rarity at least outside of their own country. The oldest ones, those dated before the turn of the century, always have single stamps in the outer border. Their smaller format is an immediate external distinction in which they differ from later ones, and, according to Michon, 1 they are to be viewed as the work of goldsmiths or engravers of seals. The library of the St. Nikolaikirche in Isny owns two such bindings on its incunabula Phil. 26 (HR 10478), a Parisian imprint by Crantz, Gering, and Friburger dated 1477, and Phil. 41 (H 10448), a Venetian edition of Locatellus dated 1487. The bindings consist of wooden boards covered with brown leather and at one time held together by two clasps extending from front to back, the arrangement generally customary in France at this time. The rectangular center fields, each of which contains four panel stamps, are enclosed by decorated borders, each of which contains three single stamps. The first has a 53 mm. x 78 mm. panel portraying the Annunciation (Fig. 1), and the second has a 55 mm. x 75 mm. panel portraying the Crucifixion (Fig. 2). Both are mentioned by Michon, 1 p. 33. The panels are surrounded by a 12 mm. wide border with the initials GP tied together with a knot in the middle of the lower edge of the border. The border of the first panel (Fig. 1) contains a snail, two birds, and a lizard in the corners, and a frog, an owl, and a bird in the other three sides of the border, all surrounded by a leafy vine. The border of the second panel (Fig. 2) shows a dragon in the middle of each of the verticals, a griffon in the middle of the upper edge, and a dog on either side of the initials in the lower edge, a11 surrounded by a flowering, leafy vine. The crucifixion panel is on the front cover of Phil. 26, and the Annunciation panel is on the back cover, while the latter is used on both covers of Phil. 41. A third binding in this group is in the Royal Hohenzollern Hofbibliothek in Sigmaringen under the shelf mark of Inc. 3,135. It contains an incunable printed in 1490 by Flach in Strassburg (Cop. 603). Like the two preceding volumes, this book is bound with similar division and decoration of the covers, but with the exclusive use of the crucifixion panel. According to a manuscript note on the last printed page it was bought in Paris in 1502. Only one picture of a binding from this Parisian bindery has been found in the literature, no. 50 in antiquarian catalog no. 66 of J. Halle, Wiegendrucke; griechische und lateinische Klassiker (Munich, 1928), where both covers are depicted. In addition to three single stamps in the border the front cover is impressed four times with the Annunciation panel in the center field; and in the center field of the back cover a third panel (mentioned by Michon), showing the mass of St. Gregory, appears four times. It is 57 mm. x 81 mm. and, contrary to the other panels, is executed without a border. The volume contains a Venetian imprint Of 1491 by B. de Choris and S. de Luere (HC 13063). On the basis of these four volumes we have evidence of a master, with seven different single stamps and three panels. His name is unknown and his productive period may be assigned to the last two decades of the fifteenth century. The next binding, executed around the turn of the century, is on Theol. 8 372 of the Nuremberg Stadtbibliothek, a book of hours dated 1497. On each cover of the soft brown leather binding there are two impressions of a rectangular panel depicting St. Nicholas and measuring 79 mm. x 106 mm. There is no evidence of this panel on any other binding. In this panel, as in the first two, there is a 15 mm. wide border showing blackberry vines and acorns with a bird in each of the upper corners and a dragon in each of the lower corners. The upper edge of the border does not appear in the rubbing (Fig. 3). In the lower edge of the border, between the dragons, there is the name "theodric9 ricardi." As Hobson 2 proves on p. 71, this name was later replaced by "NICOLA9 MATHEI" (cf. Gruel 3 p. 135, and the accompanying plate). A second panel by Richard is mentioned by Michon on p. 33 and is reproduced by Gruel 3 on p. 156 from a 1493 Parisian imprint in the Bibliothèque Nationale. The latter, presumably a somewhat later form with St. Barbara but similar in design to the first, is enclosed with a narrow border in black letter inscribed as follows: "Ora.pro.nobis.btā.barb | ara.ut.digni. | efficiamur.promissionib*. | theodric* ricardi". We have no information about this individual. Two large panels on Inc. K 281a in the Zürich Zentralbibliothek probably bring us to the beginning of the sixteenth century. The binding contains GKW 6969, a Parisian imprint of 1498. Two borders decorated with single stamps surround panels on both covers measuring 84 mm. x 126 mm. The front cover has an 11 mm. wide border filled with a blossom-covered vine with lilies in the corners. At the left St. Sebastian is depicted pierced by arrows, and at the right there is an archer. An angel holding a crown hovers over the saint. The lower edge of the border contains the name "gilbert.ferrer" (Fig. 4). On the back cover a similar 12 mm. wide border encloses a chalice held by two angels, with the sun, moon, and stars at the top. Hobson 4 reproduces the panel as Plate VIII a and points out on p. 420 that this scene appears frequently in French books of hours. Blossom- covered vines and lilies similar to those in Fig. 4 fill the entire border, although the upper edge contains a bird, the lower a heart, the left a snail, and the right two circular bands cutting through one another. In connection with both panels Michon refers to the otherwise unknown Ferrer as a bookseller. On p. 34 Michon refers to at least fifty-three bindings as traceable to the Parisian bookseller André Boule, concerning whom there is no other information. His bindings, which show only two different panels in addition to rolls, contain imprints ranging from 1487 to 1520. The panels may be reckoned among the most beautiful French designs of the period. The more frequently used panel, showing St. Sebastian and measuring 81 mm. x 122 mm., has been reproduced frequently (e.g., by Michon as Plate XI, by Husung 5 as Fig. 2, by Goldschmidt 6 as Plate XXIV, by Gruel in v. I, p. 59, by Westendorp 7 as no. 14, and by de Marinis 8 as Plate CXCVI), and therefore it need not be reproduced here. The saint stands in the center with an archer on either side and two angels hovering over him and holding a crown. On three sides the scene is enclosed in a 14 mm. wide border containing blackberry vines, leaves, and blossoms, with lilies in the corners, a dog in the upper edge, and two dragons in the middle of the verticals. The lower edge contains the name ANDRE BOULE in a lettered band. The second panel, measuring 92 mm. x 134 mm., depicts Christ on the cross, between St. Thomas Aquinas, who is catching the blood from a breast wound in a chalice, and St. Catherine of Siena as she receives the stigmata (Fig. 5). At the bottom of the scene there is the lettered band with the name. The scene is enclosed in a 12 mm. wide border filled with vines containing blossoms, blackberry foliage, and acorns. In the middle of the upper edge of the border there is a bird, in the middle of the lower edge a dragon. The panel was reproduced by Husung as Fig. 2 from a book in the University of Münster Library (D2584) containing a 1513 imprint and by Westendorp as no. 13. Both panels occur on Solg. 8 1132 of the Nuremberg Stadtbibliothek, a Parisian imprint of 1519. A second volume which is decorated only by the panel of St. Sebastian is in the Wilhelmsstift in Tübingen, V 1570, with two Parisian imprints from the end of the fifteenth century (GKW 7893 and HC 6763). Both of the latter titles are bound together in wooden boards and covered with brown leather. Originally the two covers were held together with clasps. Presumably the bindings of Julien Desjardins, of whom we know no more than we know about Boule, also belong to the sixteenth century. He is known from two panels, one with St. Yves, the other with St. Barbara and St. Sebastian, on which there are also nine single stamps and three rolls. As a result of investigation conducted by the writer six volumes can be added to the twelve reported by Hobson 2 on p. 51 which were printed between 1508 and 1512. These six contain books printed in Paris, Tübingen, Pforzheim, and Basel between 1505 and 1512. Five volumes show single stamps and occasionally rolls, and only the panel of St. Yves, the patron saint of lawyers; and the second panel appears on only one book. Some of the covers are wooden boards, others pasteboard, all covered with brown leather. Goldschmidt describes the 77 mm. x 128 mm. panel of St. Yves as no. 67 and reproduces it as Plate XXIX. The saint is in the costume of a prebendary, whose dress is completely covered with ermine. He is standing between two trees, and in his right hand he has an open book, in his left a parchment roll. A horizontal lettered band with the inscription ":Sainct:yvez:" is at the lower extremity of the panel. The second panel measures 75 mm. x 113 mm. and is enclosed in an II mm. wide border containing an inscription. To the left there is St. Sebastian pierced by arrows, with the conventional angel hovering over him with a crown; and at the right St. Barbara stands with a palm leaf in her right hand and an open book in her left hand, with a two-storey tower at her right. The lower edge of the border contains the name of the binder ".Julien.des. Jardins."; and in the three other edges there is the following inscription from left to right: "+TOUT+SE+PASSE+ | FORS | +AYMER+ DIEU+". It is only on this panel that one finds traces of nail heads measuring 6 mm. in diameter at the top and bottom edges of the picture (Fig. 6). The panel is also described and reproduced by Gruel, v. I, p. 83. The panel with St. Yves alone is on KH 4 1934 of the Wilhelmsstift in Tübingen, containing three Parisian imprints of 1511, and on the following books of the Nuremberg Stadtbibliothek: Philos. 4 47, a Basel imprint of 1510; Philos. 8 6, two Parisian imprints of 1512; Philol. 4 7, a Tübingen imprint of 1511; and Hist. 4 286 with two 1509 imprints from Tübingen and Pforzheim. Both panels are used on the Nuremberg Stadtbibliothek's Theol. 4 120 (Binding 147) with four Parisian imprints ranging from 1505 to 1511. Six additional books in the Nuremberg Stadtbibliothek which are decorated only with single stamps and rolls also belong to this shop. They are Philos. 2 12 and 41, and Theol. 2 390, 391, 394, and 559 with books printed in Paris, Basel, and Lyon between 1495 and 1512. All of these books except the first are in wooden boards. According to Michon, p. 35, and Hobson, 2 pp. 72-75, the otherwise unidentified sixteenth-century bookseller and bookbinder Jean Norvis had six panels, all of which go back to models in French books of hours with the exception of the acorn panel. The panels show David and Bathsheba, St. Michael, the vision of Emperor Augustus (See Fletcher, 9 Plate XVII), Christ and the Samaritan woman, and the emperor. All panels have either the initials IN connected with a knot or the full name "JEHAN:NORVIS". The two first panels always appear together, and four bindings with these panels have been identified and described. Three have been reproduced, viz., in Goldschmidt, no. 130, Gruel, v. II, p. 124 and Gumuchian's catalog XII ( Belles reliures, Paris, 1929), no. 14. The location of the fourth binding was not indicated, but it is probably C 257 of the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Cologne. All four bindings are duodecimos and contain Parisian imprints of 1523. Since the panels are broader than the covers of the books, no binding has been located thus far which shows them in their full breadth. The first panel shows David on a balcony in the upper center looking down on Bathsheba in her bathtub, and at the right of the latter a servant woman holding a mirror, at the left another servant woman with a bowl of fruit. The lower extremity is formed by a rectangular lettered band with the name "IEHAN:NORVIS". The full breadth of the panel was 62 mm., the height less than 104 mm. In the second panel St. Michael appears in full armor with raised sword in his right hand and shield in the left. He is standing on the devil, who is prostrate on the ground. The panel is in a border of which the 10 mm. wide verticals are filled with a three-storey Gothic structure. Two figures appear in this structure. The upper horizontal of the border is 16 mm. wide and unites the pillars on either side with four Gothic arches. The lower horizontal, 18 mm. wide, contains a shield with the initials IN in the middle, flanked on both sides by men-at-arms with sword and shield. The entire panel is 66 mm. x 106 mm. On a book in the Feldkirch Stadtarchiv there is the crowned standing figure of the emperor with an elevated sword in his right hand and a terrestrial sphere in his left hand. The scene is an exact reproduction of one in the dance of death, particularly as it appears in the borders of Pigouchet's books of hours (cf. Hobson, 4 p. 418, Fig. 2 and Plate VII). A broad border with the same scenes always encloses the rectangular center field and can be cited in four slightly varying forms. The middle of the upper edge of the border shows Mary with the Child in a crescent. The lower edge shows the Massacre of the Innocents in Bethlehem, as King Herod looks on from a throne in the left corner. Above him in the left vertical Emperor Octavian stands and above him the Tiburtine Sibyl. In the right vertical are the three kings, one above the other. All of these panels show a shield in the middle of the lower edge of the border with different monograms or symbols, although it is empty in some cases. The difference between the panels lies not in the shield but in the construction of the border. The richest form is found on the binding in Feldkirch with the initials IN on the shield. It corresponds precisely to Hobson's Plate VII, 4 except that Hobson's shield is empty. It is characteristic for this border that all the figures in the verticals on both sides stand on a low mound and that between Mary and the Sibyl is an s-shaped band with the inscription "sic deum adora". The dimensions of the entire panel are 98 mm. x 155 mm. The binding contains F. Tissardus' Grammatica hebraica, a Parisian imprint of 1508 with the mark of G. de Gourmont and a Basel imprint of 1504. According to a manuscript notation the book was purchased in Paris in 1508 by the humanist Michael Hummelberg of Ravensburg, who lived in the French capital from 1504 to 1511. It has pasteboard sides covered with brown leather and has four leather straps. A second variety of the emperor panel is on the back cover of Lit. B VII 893 of the Eichstätt Staatsbibliothek, which contains two Nuremberg imprints of 1501 and 1502, measuring 99 mm. x 158 mm. The figures in the verticals hover in space without a base, and the lettered band does not occur in the upper edge. The shield bears the monogram IG, but it also appears in the same border with the initials RP (cf. Hobson, 2 p. 13 and Plate I, and Westendorp, no. 16, here with the initials TD). The book is in wooden boards covered with reddish brown leather, and there were at one time two clasps extending from front to back. Goldschmidt describes almost exactly the same panel as no. 68 and reproduces it as Plate XXX from a Parisian imprint of 1507. The only variation is in the canopy over Herod's throne, where there is a pine cone instead of a lily, and in the shield there IS a sphere. On the back cover of the copy of Aulus Gellius' Commentarii noctium atticarum (Paris, 1508) in the Feldkirch Stadtarchiv there is a third form of the border. Here the figures in the verticals are on a somewhat higher base, and, contrary to the other bases on which the kings stand, stems with blossoms and leaves are growing from the ground. The same is true for the base on which the emperor stands (Fig. 7). The entire panel is 97 mm. x 154 mm. In the shield there is a domestic symbol which can be ascribed to Michael Hummelberg on the basis of another binding in the library containing a Parisian imprint of 1502 and GKW 2359 (1497). According to a manuscript notation Hummelberg bought the Gellius in Paris in 1509. Thus we have evidence of the different significance that may be ascribed to such initials and symbols. The covering of brown leather on pasteboard has four leather straps and, in addition to two different panels (for panel on front cover, see infra), has two single stamps in the border, and under the emperor panel there is a separate impression of the shield with the symbol. The same panel but with an empty shield occurs on the front cover of Lit. III 10,25 of the library of the St. Mang Church in Kempten. It contains four Parisian imprints of H. Stephanus ranging from 1504 to 1506. In addition to the panel two single stamps varying from those on the preceding binding occur in the border. A panel identical with the one in Kempten is reproduced by Lempertz, 10 Part C, Plate VI C. It should be pointed out that all three emperor panels are the same size. For the sake of completeness a fourth variety should be noted in the literature. It is described by J. Baer &amp; Co. in their Frankfurter Bücherfreund, XII (1914), 7, and reproduced as Plate IV. It varies from the three others particularly with respect to the headgear and the large blossom-bearing stems on either side of the shield, which contains the initials PL. The figures in the verticals stand on thick bases. The binding contains Cajetan's Summa theologiae (Paris, C. Chevallon, 1511). A quadripartite panel with saints frequently appears with the emperor panels. According to Hobson, 4 p. 408, there are at least twenty-one different forms with thirty different saints. The representations derive not from books of hours but from northern French and Flemish manuscripts. Michon mentions on p. 33 that five different panels may be traced to Denis Roce, the industrious Parisian bookseller and publisher during the period from 1490 to 1518 (for four of which see Hobson, 4 p. 432). One of the panels is on the front cover of Lit. P III 778 of the Eichstätt Staatsbibliothek, although the decoration of the back cover of the same book is not clear. The panel measures 101 mm. x 156 mm. and shows St. James the Greater, St. Barbara, St. Genevieve, and St. Nicholas together with their attributes within a 15 mm. wide border. In the corners of the border (filled with branches bearing thistles and acorns) are the symbols of the evangelists with their names on lettered bands. In the middle of the upper edge of the border is a bird, and a dragon is in the middle of each of the verticals. The lower edge varies from the three others and shows the arms of the publisher (cf. Hobson, 4 p. 422, Fig. 4) in the middle between his initials, DR. The horizontal lettered bands extend from the initials to the symbols of the evangelists (Fig. 8). The binding contains F. Philelfus' Epistolae (Paris, Denis Roce, 1505). The wooden boards are covered with brown leather, and at one time they were held together by two clasps extending from front to back. A volume we have already mentioned, Lit. B VII 893 in the Eichstätt Staatsbibliothek, has on the front cover a 108 mm. x 164 mm. panel representing saints and their attributes according to the legend underneath each one: "S.katerine: - S. nicolas: - S.iehan: - S.barbe:". A 9 mm. wide strip with quadrifoliate flowers is on the outside of the group at the right and the left. The panel has been reproduced from a book containing a Lyon imprint of 1507 to accompany no. 647 in Sotheby's Catalogue of the Library of George Dunn (London, 1913). In the library of the Benedictine Monastery in Engelberg, Switzerland, are two Parisian incunabula (Inc. 221 of 1500 and 1502 and Inc. 290 [Cop. 2391] of 1500) and two supplementary volumes of 1500. Impressed on the brown leather drawn over wooden boards is a quadripartite panel without lettering and measuring 104 mm. x 171 mm. It shows John the Evangelist with the palm branch and cup of poison; St. Barbara with an open book, palm branch, and tower at the right; St. Catherine with a sword, an open book, and a wheel at the left, over which appears the letter "p"; and St. Nicholas with an open book and a crosier and a "g" at his left. The panel was owned by the otherwise unknown bookbinder Pierre Guiot. Here we should also include Lit. B XI 717 from the Staatsbibliothek in Eichstätt, containing two Parisian imprints of 1505 and 1509, with its panel on the front cover accompanied by a single stamp. There are reproductions from Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Parisian imprints in Goldschmidt (1510; no. 55, Plate XXII), Gruel (1502; V. II, p. 88,89), Loubier 11 (1509; p.113, at one time in the Schlossmuseum in Berlin), and Gumuchian's catalog of Belles reliures (1512; no. 7, Plate VII). On all of these bindings there is a second panel in another form which will be discussed later. It is in a frame with five vertical stripes. A second variety of quadripartite panels portrays biblical characters enclosed in a border decorated with vines bearing blossoms and fruit with birds and dragons in the middle of the border. To this type belongs the front cover of the 1508 Gellius in the Feldkirch Stadtarchiv (supra). On this 95 mm. x 163 mm. panel, of which the border is 12 mm. wide, we see John the Baptist, the Virgin and the Child, the three kings, and King David (Fig. 9). A very similar panel corresponding to the front cover of the book in Husung, 12 Fig. 48, is on the back cover of a book in the Augsburg Staatsbibliothek, H. v. Schlettstadt's Quadrivium ecclesiae (Paris, 1509). The border of the Husung panel did not make a full impression. The panel is 96 mm. x 161 mm. The pasteboard sides are covered with brown leather. The next version is distinguished from the other panels we have described especially in that the four figures are larger as a result of not being enclosed in a border. Goldschmidt describes it as no. 66 from a 1508 Lyon imprint, and Weale 13 describes it in v. II under R 512 from a 1509 Parisian imprint. Gumuchian's Belles reliures describes it as no. 16 and reproduces it as Plate VIII. It shows God the father with a crown and a terrestrial sphere over a schematic band of clouds, under which there is the inscription "o dne libera animam meam"; St. Peter with an open book in his right hand, a key in his left hand with the tiara at his right; John the Baptist with the Easter lamb and the banner of the cross; and King David kneeling with his harp. The panel measures 96 mm. x 165 mm. This panel may be seen on the back cover of a book in the Feldkirch Stadtarchiv, R. Gaguinus' Compendium de gestis francorum (Paris, 1507). The pasteboard sides are covered with brown leather. According to a manuscript notation Hummelberg bought the book in Paris. There is another panel on the front cover of the same book. It shows John the Baptist in a broad border. Hobson 2 mentions it on p. 13 and reproduces it as Plate 2. According to his statement 4 on p. 400-401 the border is taken from the books of hours, the center field from the mystery plays. The panel is also described by Goldschmidt as no. 66 and perhaps corresponds with R 511 in Weale, v. II, in which, however, just as in Hobson's example, there is a lettered band in the verticals. In the upper part of the center field John the Baptist preaches from the top of a hill to three individuals on either side, one above the other. In the middle of the upper edge of the border there is a half figure of Mary and the Child, on her right a candle and on her left an angel. An angel holding a lettered band reading "S iacobe" is in the upper left corner; and a half figure of God the Father with a terrestrial sphere over a cloud is in the upper right corner. In the middle of the lower edge Bathsheba is in her bath with a servant holding a mirror at her right. There is a high fountain in the lower left corner that penetrates a third of the way up the left vertical. At the foot of the right vertical King David gazes at the bath scene from a balcony window. Above this figure he appears again, in this case kneeling as if in prayer. On the other side over the fountain St. James the Greater is standing in a pilgrim's costume (Fig. 10). It is surprising to find traces of two nails in the verticals. The panel measures 94 mm. x 168 mm. John the Evangelist with a palm branch and a bowl of poison appears in a 25 mm. wide border on the front cover of the Schlettstadt book in Augsburg. The whole panel, measuring 98 mm. x 168 mm., appears in Fig. 48 in Husung 12 but in incomplete form. In the middle of the upper edge of the border there is the evangelist's eagle with the lettered band "S:iohane" under a tripartite Gothic arch. In the three other edges there are autumnal scenes, at the left the fruit harvest, at the right and the bottom a deer hunt (Fig. 11). They have been taken from almost the same designs, except in the contrary sense, in marginal decorations of French books of hours in the manière criblé. Such designs appear, for example, in HC 8855, which introduces among the figures in the dance of death the emperor who has been described repeatedly in this paper. The Kempten volume has an example of the acorn pattern on the back cover (the emperor panel, supra, is on the front cover). Michon, p. 36, mentions it, and according to Hobson, 4 p. 398, some twenty versions of it have been identified. A 17 mm. wide border decorated with vines bearing thistles and acorns with a dragon in the middle of the verticals and a strip on the lower edge containing an empty shield in its middle encloses nine full and two half acorns which are on the ends of two juxtaposed arching friezes. The border and the center field are separated by two thin lines on the outside and two heavier lines on the inside. The panel is 94 mm. x 153 mm. and has been reproduced by Hannover 14 as no. 13 from a book printed in Paris in 1519 and presently belonging to the Royal Library in Copenhagen. Another panel of the same dimensions, reproduced by Schmidt, 15 Fig. 34, from a 1524 Basel imprint presently in the Darmstadt Landesbibliothek, is distinguished from the preceding one in particular by a row of pearls which forms the border of the inner rectangle. Schmidt incorrectly ascribes the binding to the Low Countries and alleges that on account of the row of pearls the panel consists of two parts, the border and the center field. A careful examination does not support this statement. On the contrary, the panel is impressed from a single piece, and the design in the border is hardly distinguishable from the preceding one. Bickell 16 reproduces a second binding, a book printed in Paris in 1518, as Plate XII. It is possible that this panel was cut on the model of the first one which we described. Here too belongs Diogenes Laërtius' De vita et moribus philosophorum (Basel, 1524) in the Hofbibliothek at Donaueschingen. Still another type of panel (Michon, p. 36) divides the center field, which is enclosed in a border, into vertical stripes. An example may be found on the back cover of Lit. B XI 717 of the Eichstätt Staatsbibliothek (supra). The 104 mm. x 171 mm. panel is enclosed in a 15 mm. wide border, and within the rectangle there are five stripes in three different forms and breadths, which increase as the stripes progress from the middle to the edge. Blackberry vines fill the outer stripes, and the middle ones are filled with quadrifoliate blossoms. The border is decorated with blackberry vines, and five birds, two dragons, a snail, and four lettered bands are inserted in it. The inscription, which begins at the top and runs down the verticals, reads: "experence:-.en.dieu :z tout:-bon :advis", while the band in the lower edge contains the name of the binder, "Pierre guiot". Reproductions of this panel (just as in the case of the front cover, supra) may be found in Goldschmidt, Plate XXIII, Gruel, v. II, preceding p. 89, and Loubier, p. 113. The center field poses a problem with its border of straight lines which also delimit the stripes, since the vertical lines cut over the horizontal ones, a phenomenon which suggests that the panel was not made from a single impression. Moreover. the sharply defined upper and lower limits of the stripes prove clearly that no rolls were used. In this connection the balanced design of both the outer stripes should be pointed out. For these reasons this writer believes that the border consisted of one piece, while the inner rectangle was divided by four different filets. A second quite similar panel is on the binding of GB IV 4 59 of the Cologne Universitäts- und Stadtbibliothek. It contains the undated incunable H 15168 and a book printed in Venice in 1502. The whole measures 87 mm. x 137 mm., and the smaller border is 14 mm. wide. Again the border is filled with blackberry vines in which three birds, three dragons, a snail, and three bands are inserted. Their inscription reads "Esperance .de. - T A I P - M. . ." (cf. Michon, p. 36). The lower edge, which has no lettered band, distinguishes this panel from the first. In the case of the center field, which is divided into four stripes, the statements about the preceding binding also apply here. In design, the three different filets resembles the ones in the first panel almost exactly. The traces of two nails 4 mm. in diameter in the upper and lower edges of the center rectangle are recent. Here, as in the preceding binding, the panel is accompanied by a single stamp, in this instance a crowned lily. In conclusion we have a heraldic panel on the covers of a textually incomplete octavo no. 28986 in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg. A shield with the initials DM, connected by a knot, is held by two nude figures, a man with a club and a woman. A monkey sits on the richly designed cover of the full-barred helmet. A 19 mm. high horizontal band in which a stag and a dragon face one another concludes the armorial design at the bottom (Fig. 12). The panel measures 76 mm. x 133 mm. Hobson, 2 p. 12-13, mentions it, but no second example has been found. We have discussed twenty-seven bindings containing books printed between 1477 and 1524 with twenty-seven different panels. The breadths vary from 53 mm. to 104 mm. and the heights from 75 mm. to 171 mm. The smaller formats are characteristic of the period before the turn of the century. The subjects of the pictorial representations are taken from the Bible and hagiographical literature. In addition, there is the figure of the emperor, the acorns, the borders, and a heraldic panel. The following bookbinders or booksellers are mentioned by name: André Boule (two bindings), Julien Desjardins (six), Pierre Guiot (three), Jean Norvis (two), Gilbert Ferrer (one), Theodoricus Ricardus (one), and Denis Roce (one). Three bindings are marked with the initials GP and one each with JG and DM. It should also be pointed out that the monograms and symbols frequently given in a shield in the border have varying significance and may not be viewed only as marks of the bookbinder or bookseller.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A London Ornament Stock: 1598-1683 by C. William Miller *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">London printers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries accumulated large, and often ill-sorted, ornament stocks by a variety of ways, some of them puzzlingly devious. They could always purchase new decorations or acquire them at second-hand; but in addition they lent blocks which they never saw again, or borrowed others which they neglected to return; they bequeathed or inherited whole stocks, and commissioned imitations or recuttings of decorations that caught their fancy. Their storage shelves or drawers were evidently spacious enough to hold both the old and the new; hence only on occasion and apparently with reluctance did they discard permanently portions of their ornament collections. Mostly it appears that decorations which fell into disuse were shoved back into oblivion rather than thrown away. Yet one can never predict when the long reach of a compositor, the exigencies of an elaborately ornamented volume, or the reshuffling of the blocks in transfer from one printing house to another will cause the startling reappearance of a forgotten decoration, as in this study the 'pear' A that flourished in the years before the defeat of the Spanish Armada and reappeared in print finally in the year of the Restoration, or the John Harrison rebus, first seen in 1590, and still in use, badly scarred and cracked, 103 years later. For the bibliographer this practice among early London printers of holding on to most of the decorative blocks that came into their possession and of mingling at random the old with the new in their printing is of more than passing interest. The study of a long-term accumulation of ornaments frequently affords him a sure means of tracing the relationships between printers and of identifying the printers of unsigned books exhibiting blocks not normally associated with them. By just such a study I have been able to follow through the shops of a dozen printers an ornament stock kept largely intact over a span of about ninety years, and therefore can offer a somewhat fuller sampling of those decorations and recording of their use than one is likely to achieve by the intensive study of the books of an individual printer. The general line of succession of the early printers involved in this study-Judson through John Okes-was first set down by Arber in 1887. 1 McKerrow 2 and Plomer 3 have since contributed substantially to our knowledge of the lives and careers of these men. Recent scholars have dealt with specific printers: Professor H. R. Hoppe, extensively with John Wolfe, 4 Professor R. C. Bald, briefly with Robert White, 5 and Mr. Harold Jenkins, with John Norton. 6 My particular tasks in preparing a commentary to accompany the ornament plates were these: (1) to bring together the facts bearing on the careers of the printers who once owned this ornament stock; (2) to use that information to study the transfer of decorations from printer to printer, and (3) to fix as definitely as possible the terminal dates of the use of the stock by each printer in order that bibliographers may by means of the ornaments identify unsigned books issuing from the presses of these printers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Thomas Judson appears to be the first printer to use in his books the blocks that form the basis for this ornament stock. Whether he purchased them new when he set up shop or second-hand from an earlier printer I have not been able to discover. Thomas, the son of stationer John Judson, took up his freedom on January 16, 1581 (Arber, II, 683), joined John Windet on January 15, 1584, in a partnership agreement drawn for five years, 7 but destined to last scarcely one, and then apparently permitted his privilege of master- printer to lie dormant until 1598 when his name reappears in imprints. In this new venture, which ran only two years, Judson signed his name to a mere handful of books-one of them Nashes Lenten Stuffe, the first of two which he printed for Cuthbert Burby; nevertheless it is in these few books published in the closing years of the sixteenth century that one first finds the decorative initials and occasional ornaments that will reappear in the publications of at least six later printers. On February 4, 1600, Thomas Judson, appearing before a whole Court of Assistants of the Stationers' Company, acknowledged that he had sold "all his presses letters &amp; printing stuffe" to John Harrison, and agreed never "to erect printing" nor "use or kepe [in] a printing house as a m r printer hereafter." 8 This new owner of the ornament stock, a young man just admitted freeman to the Company the previous July 9 (Arber, II, 724), was the son of John Harrison the elder, a well established stationer. Because young John was one of four John Harrisons engaged in the printing business in London at about the same time, the clerk usually identified him with care in the Stationers' Register as "John Harrison Junior (or younger), son of Master Harrison the elder"; Arber and Plomer distinguish him from his kin by referring to him as John Harrison (III). John set up shop under the sign of the White Greyhound in St. Paul's Churchyard, 9 and engaged in both printing and publishing. Occasionally he printed a book for his father, but by July, 1601, he had begun printing books for which he held the right of copy-some theological tracts, later a book on astrology, and in 1604 Stow's popular Summary of the English Chronicles. And what is especially relevant to this study Harrison expanded considerably the ornament stock that came to him from Judson. One small addition of four initials (A2, C6, H1, and S1) 10 and two ornaments (Nos. 2 and 4) is historically significant because these blocks first appear between 1583 and 1592 in books printed by the well-known stationer John Wolfe, and hence stand as probably the oldest decorations in the stock. Actually only initials A2 and C6 and ornament no. 2 occur in the Harrison-printed books which I have examined; ornament no. 4 appears in a book printed by George Snowdon, Harrison's successor, and initials H1 and S1 first appear in books printed by Nicholas Okes, Snowdon's successor. The question is whether these decorations were acquired at different times by the three printers involved or whether the six decorations and perhaps others yet unidentified 11 were purchased at one time. The second of these views seems the more plausible. Wolfe died in 1601, and shortly after, Adam Islip bought Wolfe's "printing house Letter and Implements" (Arber, III, 700) and had possibly begun reselling some of the newly acquired but unwanted printing materials. Certainly initials A2 and C6 derived from Wolfe first appear in a Harrison book in 1601, and McKerrow's notes on the reoccurrence of devices originally in Wolfe's possession indicate a transfer of certain ornaments to other printers in and after 1601. 12 There are, however, obstacles to this view. Wolfe, as Hoppe points out (p. 267), changed his activities from those of printer to publisher in 1593 or 1594 and dispersed at least two portions of his ornament stock to Adam Islip and John Windet. Wolfe initials H1 and S1, first occurring in this study in early Okes books, Hoppe discovered in use in Islip-printed volumes (p. 275), and the O3 which Judson employed as early as 1598, while not traceable to Wolfe, looks suspiciously like an initial from a favorite alphabet used by Islip all through the 1590's Therefore, until scholars study in detail the transfer of ornaments at the turn of the century, one can only conjecture that the Wolfe decorations through Islip might have come into the ornament stock here under study by 1598 in the career of Judson, or in 1601 in the time of Harrison, or even in part as late as 1606 when Islip was selling his business to Raworth and Monger, and Nicholas Okes was on the point of leaving his partner Snowdon to set up his own business. Young Harrison's opportunity to enjoy his newly purchased decorations was short-lived, for his career as a stationer consists of little more than its promising beginning. The last imprint which he signed was dated 1604. He was dead by February 6, 1604 (Arber, III, 275), the day on which the Stationers' Company transferred to John Harrison the elder young John's lone apprentice. Even briefer than Harrison's career was that of his successors, George and Lionel Snowdon (or Snowden). These kinsmen from Yorkshire had both served their apprenticeships with the London printer Robert Robinson, George receiving his freedom May 11, 1597 (Arber, II, 718), and Lionel admitted freeman on February 13, 1604 (Arber, II, 736). They shared jointly the privilege of master printer and set up shop early in 1605 with printing equipment including the ornament stock bought from the Harrison estate. The S.T.C. records only eight signed imprints issuing from their press, the majority of them religious works published by Clement Knight, George Potter, or Nathaniel Butter. Plomer fixes the dates of the Snowdon partnership as 1606-1608. 13 The evidence of the Snowdon imprint-dates and the Stationers' records indicate rather that Lionel was George's partner only until January 29, 1606, when Nicholas Okes was admitted to be in Lionel's place "with George Snodom in the same sort and all respects." 14 This new partnership of Okes and Snowdon ran to April 13, 1607, at which time George Snowdon resigned his part of the printing privilege to Okes and sold him all his printing materials, consisting in part of the ornament stock accumulated by the Snowdons, though to what extent one cannot rightly judge because of the meager output of their press. Nicholas Okes, Snowdon's successor, was the son of John Okes, a horner plying his trade in London. On March 25, 1596, Nicholas started serving his apprenticeship with William King (Arber, II, 209). Okes gained his freedom on December 5, 1603 (Arber, II, 735), and married on December 8, Elizabeth Beswick of St. Mary Magdalen, the daughter of a Gloucester cook. 15 At least two children, John and Mary, sprang from this marriage, both of whom figure later in the history of this ornament stock. On April 19, 1606, Okes was admitted into the livery of the Stationers' Company (Arber, III, 700). The S.T.C. records no items bearing an Okes-Snowdon imprint and lists but one Okes imprint ( S.T.C. 10856) in the year 1606. 16 Nicholas did not enter a copy in the Register until July 6, 1607 (Arber, III, 355), several months after he had launched his own business. Of all the printers considered in this study Nicholas Okes is unquestionably the most significant. He was active as a printer-publisher for some thirty years, longer than any of the others; he printed the largest number of books and stands unchallenged except perhaps by the later William Wilson as the printer of items important in the history of English drama. From Okes' press came play quartos of Armin, Heywood, Jonson, Massinger, Marston, May, Middleton, Shakespeare, and Webster. In addition he printed non-dramatic writings of Braithwaite, Brown, Daniel, and Donne, the travels of Lithgow, and the widely popular farming and livestock manuals of Gervase Markham, a number of whose writings Nicholas both printed and published. Likewise the books issuing from Nicholas Okes' shop are for this study the most revealing. Okes owned a full ornament stock and drew upon it consistently in decorating the preliminaries of his books and calling attention to new sections or chapter headings, although he seldom decorated a book lavishly, and on some occasions he included no ornamentation at all. A survey of his printing list as a whole reveals that the majority of his books were in formats smaller than the folio or large quarto; consequently he used few big ornaments and tended over the years to insert with less and less frequency the larger block initials which he had inherited from Judson. Only with the large outpouring of books from Okes' press is one able to gauge the true depth and range of the ornament stock which he had received from his predecessors. The collection as a whole was scarcely eight years old and showed very little wear when he purchased it. Okes, evidently thinking it adequate for his needs, employed it for thirty years with few additions. He bought a small group of ornaments within five years after he began his own printing and added three identifiable small initial alphabets midway in his career: the leaf and line set (like D4) c. 1616, the scroll set (like A8) c. 1615, and the acorn set (like A9) c . 1624. So ample, in fact, was Okes' supply of decorative initials that he seldom had need for a factotum. He inherited half a dozen from his predecessors, used only one (Fa 7) with any consistency in his first years, and appears not to have purchased a new factotum during his career. Okes, like many of his contemporaries, reserved a few ornaments for use on his title-pages and employed them frequently enough that they may be considered printer's devices as McKerrow accurately described them when he reproduced all of Okes' some years ago. 17 Only two of the six normally ascribed to Okes were original with him: the fleur de lis in the oval frame (Orn. 4) and the large unframed fleur de lis (Orn. 6) came from John Wolfe; the Pegasus over a caduceus (Orn. 2) and the pair of compasses in the oval frame (Orn. 1) came from Harrison. The small unframed fleur de lis (Orn. 9) first appears in an Okes book in 1608; the large device picturing Jove amid his oak trees and dated 1610 (Orn. 8) Okes used at intervals throughout his printing years. A seventh ornament, a lion's face over a shield without the initials H. M. (Orn. 10) McKerrow attributes somewhat reluctantly to Okes because the device, once the property of Henry Middleton, should have passed to Robinson, to Bradock, and then to Haviland, not to Okes. McKerrow found a single imprint by Okes bearing the decoration and supposed it "possible that he . . . had a habit of putting his name as printer on books really printed for him." 18 This habit Okes may have had, though I came upon no examples of it; but he was not misleading anyone in those books bearing the old Middleton device. There exist at least four other Okes imprints containing the device and including additional blocks identifiable as Okes'. The ornament later passed to John Okes and then through his widow to William Wilson. Nicholas Okes' life during the thirty-odd years of his career was for an early seventeenth-century London printer not an unpredictable one. He changed his residence or place of business three times: in 1603 he was living in St. Nicholas, Cole Abbey; 19 by 1613 he was situated near Holborn bridge, 20 and by 1628 he was dwelling in St. Leonard, Foster Lane. 21 In the eleven-year span from 1611 to 1621 his father, John; his wife, Elizabeth; and his mother, Grace, all died. He took his son, John, in the same period to be his apprentice and incurred the censure of the authorities for printing Francis of Sales' An Introduction to a Devout Life (Eye) and Withers Motto (1621). By February of 1624 he had taken a second wife, Mary, the widow of Christopher Pursett, 22 a publisher active briefly from 1605 to 1607, and again in 1611. On January 12, 1626, Nicholas' son, John, gained his freedom in the Stationers' Company (Arber, III, 686). The year following Nicholas was again in difficulty with the authorities, this time jointly with John over the printing of Sir Robert Cotton's A Short View of the Long Life and Raigne of Henry the Third. By January, 1628, Nicholas' second wife was dead. After 1626, the year of John's freedom, the partnership arrangements that Nicholas and his son entered into with each other and with others cannot always be determined with certainty. Plomer and McKerrow both state that John Okes was in partnership with John Norton. 23 The single piece of supporting evidence for that conclusion is the State Paper note that in 1635 "John Okes . . . and John Norton [were] partners under colour of partnership but none of them admitted" (Arber, III, 703), a statement indicating that the relationship was at best a fiction designed to hoodwink the authorities. Plomer states also that in about 1627 Nicholas took his son John as a partner. 24 The available evidence suggests the contrary. During the ten-year period 1625-1634 John Okes inserted his name in only four imprints: two jointly with his father and two alone. Plomer implies that there is proof from a deposition of John and his father's working together on a third book, the unsigned A Short View by Cotton which the government suppressed. In roughly the same years Nicholas was printing almost sixty volumes in which his name appears alone in the imprints and was actively engaged in a partnership with another printer. The one partnership that Nicholas formed for which irrefutable proof exists is that with John Norton, who before a twelve-year stint as master-printer had served as apprenticed and journeyman in the King's printing house under Bonham Norton, to whom John probably was distantly related (Jenkins, p. 94). Decorations from Okes' ornament stock first appear in Norton-signed books in 1628; Norton continued to use Okes' blocks generally unmixed with foreign ones until sometime in 1636. Evidence corroborating that of the ornaments occurs in petitions addressed by both Okes and Norton to the Commissioners for Printing in 1636 and 1637. Okes acknowledged that he had taken John Norton as a partner "without the privity of the Archbishop or the Commission." Norton likewise admitted that he had been Nicholas Okes' partner "for eight years during which time many differences had arisen." 25 This quarreling led to the splitting of the partners, gave rise to bitter recriminations, and resulted eventually in a suit at common law. How Okes and Norton managed their cooperative venture can be understood in part by examining the books which each of the men printed. Norton had been a master printer prior to his joining Okes and hence could be expected to retain some of his materials. His types he evidently brought along with him, for the types in his books are consistently different from those in Okes' printing. There is, on the other hand, no evidence that Norton added a second press to the one which Nicholas had possessed from the outset of his career, nor is there any marked indication that Norton retained his old ornament stock. 26 During his years with Okes he seems gradually to have accumulated in his section of the shop a group of Okes' decorations, including some dating back to the era of Judson and Harrison, which he kept separate from the general Okes stock and which he tended to use and reuse in his books. From these printing practices which characterize the Okes-Norton shop during the period of the partnership, the bibliographer may also infer a possible solution to the problem of distinguishing an unsigned Okes book from one unsigned but printed by Norton between the years 1628 and 1636. Identification of the ornaments in a given book would merely limit the search for the printer to the Okes-Norton shop. Finding in the volume certain of the Okes' blocks which habitually reoccur in Norton imprints would furnish inferential but scarcely proof-positive evidence. Therefore only by a detailed comparative type study-the varying italic capitals in the pica and English fonts offer a speedy trial solution-may the scholar determine with any conclusiveness which man printed the book. No problem posed by the Okes-Norton partnership is so difficult of solution as that which one faces in attempting to ascertain the precise date when the two parted company. The presence in Norton books of Okes' blocks unmixed with foreign decorations through the year 1636 suggests, as stated earlier, that the agreement terminated in that year, but even the testimony of the ornaments is in this situation open to question. Nicholas in an undated petition to the Commissioners of Printing states that "Norton . . . has aided a company of factious persons in erecting an unlawful press in a secret place and secretly conveyed out of petitioner's house forms and letters which afterwards were discovered by the Company of Stationers and defaced to petitioner's disgrace and loss" (CSPD, XII, 73). In another undated petition Norton admitted that the Stationers "have lately taken away his press" (Ibid.). Norton's press was restored to him on January 23, 1636 (CSPD, IX, 468); hence he probably lost it sometime in 1635. That Okes and Norton remained business associates after this act of Norton's-if Okes' statement is a true one-seems improbable. Further, if Norton carried off letters and formes, he might also have taken along some of Okes' decorations. The fact is that Norton did take with him at one time or another the Okes' blocks that he had gradually accumulated around his cases, including the Okes' device of the Pegasus over the caduceus and possibly that of the large unframed fleur de lis, and continued to use them in his books as late as 1639. After 1636 Norton imprints usually carry the appropriated Okes' decorations mixed with new blocks. This combination of familiar and strange decorations makes it possible to distinguish most of Norton's later books from Okes'; but if Norton ever printed in these later years an unsigned sparsely ornamented volume bearing only Okes' blocks, one might conclude quite incorrectly on the evidence of decorations that Okes and Norton were still partners or that the work had come from Okes' press. Norton's parting company with Okes, in whatever year it occurred, stripped Norton of even the pretended right to print with the approval of the Archbishop and the Commission. Despite the absence of his name on the Star chamber decree of 1667 listing approved master printers, Norton continued his printing "by indulgence" and on a very insecure footing. He eventually received his license in 1639 (Jenkins, loc. cit.), but within a year or so he had died, intestate -- the inventory of his estate was estimated at a mere £99 27 -- and left his family near to poverty. Alice, his widow, carried on the trade in the early forties and then turned the business over to their son Roger whom Plomer describes as having "died very poor" on November 27, 1658. 28 I have examined no imprints of either Alice or Roger Norton, but both of them doubtless used the decorations which John had once possessed; hence it is plausible to suppose that the Okes' blocks carried off by Norton continued their separate existence in works printed during the period of the Civil War. The problem of determining the business relationship between Nicholas and his son after 1634 is almost as puzzling as the one involving Nicholas and Norton. This new problem is complicated by the Okes' running afoul the authorities over the reprinting of Francis of Sales' Introduction to a Devout Life in 1637. As a result Nicholas failed to have his printing privilege reapproved in the 1637 Star Chamber decree. One scrap of evidence suggests that John was responsible for printing the censored Sales' work rather than Nicholas and that the father, ready to retire, took the blame in order that his son might succeed him as master printer without prejudice ( CSPD, XV, 212) From the Okes' imprints dated 1635 and 1636, the years in which Nicholas and Norton were feuding in earnest, one may infer that John was assuming an increasingly important role in the business. In those two years his name, linked always with his father's, appears repeatedly in the imprints. During 1637 John printed several books carrying his name alone. In 1638 and 1639 all but two works emanating from the Okes' shop bear John's signing. Thus John, who between 1635 and 1637 became Nicholas' partner in fact, if not legally, appears to have assumed late in 1637 the role of master in the Okes' house and permitted his father to step down. This conjectured history of the changing relations between father and son is substantiated in part by Nicholas' petition to Archbishop Laud dated June 28, 1637. In it he professes himself willing to turn over his title as master printer to his son. Nicholas pleads old age as his reason for retirement, and "prays his Grace to allow the said transfer until further order" ( CSPD, XI, 249). John's finally taking over his father's business was not, however, without financial strings in the form of annual payments: £ 25 to Nicholas and L50 to John's sister Mary, now married to William Kempe. Within a year Mary followed her father's petition with one of her own requesting Laud to permit John to "subsist, as he now does by favour, and have the reversion of the next printer's place which shall fall void" ( CSPD, XIII, 221) The reason for Mary's action is understandable. John, fearing hindrance in pursuing his craft, had refused to perform his agreement and pay Mary the £50 which he had promised her. The facts concerning John's life and career between 1637 and 1643, the year of his death, are quickly set down. He was elevated to the livery of the Stationers' Company on June 1, 1640, 29 and presumably by that date had received from the government his license to practice his trade. From his will drawn on July 15, 1643, most of these remaining facts may be inferred. Sometime after 1637 he moved his shop to the parish of Little St. Bartholomew, probably to the Well-yard near Little St. Bartholomew's Hospital, the location which William Wilson gave in an imprint some years later. He married during the 1630's and fathered two sons, John in 1638 and Edward in 1640. He was ill when he signed his will in the summer of 1643 and probably died that autumn. The will was not probated, however, until May 8, 1644. To his wife Mary he bequeathed his printing business; to his father Nicholas, John willed £10, "his mourning cloak and best beaver hat" and promised him "his dyet lodging and washing . . . provided that he used his best endeavours to direct and govern my said trade." 30 The single most important contribution which the books bearing John Okes' imprint make to this study is the evidence throughout that a large new stock of decorations has been added to the old collection. The new blocks, both ornaments and decorative initials, make their appearance first in 1636, the year in which John joined his father actively as a partner at about the same time Nicholas and Norton were parting company. The stock which Nicholas had employed so consistently from the start of his career was by now worn and because of Norton's "borrowings" somewhat incomplete, but the decision to purchase a new stock turned in all probability on Nicholas' desire to give the publications issuing from his house a modern appearance and to launch John on his career with fresh materials. This new ornament stock, except for a few additions, seems to have served John and his successors well during the next half-century. They did not, however, discard the original stock; old familiar blocks continue to appear but much less frequently now and quite unpredictably. For the bibliographer, a knowledge of the decorations in both the old and new stocks and of the circumstances surrounding their merger is from this point on of particular value, for the six printers who use these blocks during the next fifty years will be leaving unsigned the imprints of many of their books and will at the same time be printing a good portion of the significant belles lettres in mid-seventeenth- century London. Once John Okes had died, his widow Mary had virtually no choice but to take up the responsibility of running the printing shop. The Stationers' Company honored the right of widows to succeed their husbands in the trade, John had paved the way by stipulations in his will, and Mary had two sons and a father-in-law to support. Fortunately she could depend on the shrewd counsels of Nicholas Okes to guide her and probably could count on the assistance of William Kirby and Adam Hare, two journeymen whom John had remembered in his will. She signed her first imprint in 1643; the earliest I have found is Daniel Swift's The Pious Protestant issued in October, a date which suggests that John had died within a few months after signing his will and that Mary assumed control almost immediately. She ran the shop for about two years and then turned over its direction to the printer William Wilson, whom she married in 1645. When precisely all these events in the lives of John and Mary Okes and Wilson occurred, the parish registers of Little St. Bartholomew fail to say. They are silent on the dates of both of Mary's marriages, on the birthdates of her two sons and the death dates of her father-in-law and even of her husband John, who had requested to be buried in the Little St. Bartholomew sanctuary "as near to the chancel as may be with convenience." 31 Mary's new husband, the printer William Wilson, Plomer barely mentions in his Dictionary 1641-1667; he even questions whether Wilson was active in London (p. 196), but more recent scholars concentrating on the study of London printing after 1640 have found, of course, abundant evidence of the activity of Wilson's presses. 32 William, the son of the late Thomas Wilson, a yeoman living at Meldreth in Cambridgeshire, "put himself apprentice" on July 25, 1618, to the London stationer Thomas Dawson for a term of nine years. Wilson was officially bound on November II, 1618, and after Dawson's death, was "put over by Consent of a Court" to Thomas Purfoote on April 9, 1621, to serve the residue of his unexpired term. 33 Purfoote turned Wilson over to the Stationers at the end of an eight rather than nine-year term, and on September 4, 1626, the young man was sworn and admitted freeman of the Company (Arber, III, 686). Apparently lacking the opportunity and funds to set up as a master printer, he labored for most of the next twenty years as a journeyman. He ventured only once in these early years to make a Register entry; the copy, a broadside, was listed on July 7, 1628, and assigned to Edmond Whiting on February 5, 1640. 34 Wilson's opportunity came in 1645 with his marriage to Mary Okes. He was in his early forties, almost an exact contemporary of Mary's first husband, and evidently a widower with one daughter Sarah. 35 With this new marriage he gained two small stepsons, both of whom he was to train in the printer's trade, and one of whom, the younger Edward, was to become his successor. He acquired, moreover, a printing privilege, a group of saleable rights of copy, and a well-established and well-stocked printing house. His rise in the Stationers' Company was also assured. Within a year he was elected to his first half-yeomanry share in the English Stock, 36 and two years after that he was raised to the livery of the Company. 37 He won a full yeomanry share in 1651, 38 and by 1652 he had been named as one of a group of master printers empowered to search other printing houses. 39 Eventually he was preferred to a livery share in the English Stock in 1660. 40 The greater portion of the books which Wilson printed mirror the shoddy printing standards of his day; his significance rests in the fact that he printed for Humphrey Moseley and Henry Herringman, the two leading London publishers of contemporary literature. He shared Moseley's printing with Thomas Warren, and Herringman's with John Macock, but Wilson's was always the lion's share. He is the only active printer mentioned by Moseley in his will, 41 and Herringman is the only bookseller-publisher mentioned in Wilson's will, suggesting that Wilson enjoyed more than a strictly business relationship with both publishers. From his presses came the huge French romances of La Calprenède and Scudéry in translation, the early theological and scientific writings of Robert Boyle, poetry by Cowley, Dryden, Fane, King, and Waller, and plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, Davenant, Dryden, Porter, Tuke, and Shirley. Wilson employed consistently and at times lavishly the new decorations which Nicholas and John Okes had purchased in 1636 and mingled with them occasionally the blocks from the earlier stock, including four or five of the very earliest acquired originally from John Wolfe. He bought additional decorations of his own, and because he printed numerous folios and quartos, tended to use more large ornaments and block initials than the Okeses did. His persistent use of the same small group of headpieces, a handful of initials, and two devices, ornaments no. 5 and II, makes the identification of his presswork relatively simple-a boon indeed when one considers the fact that he signed something less than fifty per cent of the output of his printing house. Of the 53 pieces which he printed for Herringman in the years 1653-1665, for example, Wilson inserted his name or initials in only 7 imprints, and I suspect that the proportion varies little in those books which he printed for Moseley. Wilson's career as a master printer covers exactly twenty years. He married Mary Okes in 1645 and died in the spring of 1665-his will was probated on May 8, 1665. 42 In it he bequeathed L100 of his share in the English Stock to his daughter Sarah Chalfont and the remaining £60 to "my loveing and obedient [step-]sonne Edward Oakes," to whom Wilson also willed his "printing house and all ymplements thereunto belonging," with the understanding that Mary Wilson was to enjoy sole interest in the shop as long as she desired or until her death. The widow was soon to turn the responsibility for the business over to Edward. On August 5, 1665, "weake and ill" she was affixing her mark to her will. 43 Nor was she the only one attentive to the arranging of her worldly affairs. Pepys, in the same week, hearing that the Bill of Mortality had listed 3000 deaths from the plague was drawing over his will anew, observing at the time, the town grows so unhealthy "that a man cannot depend upon living two days." 44 Mary's death seems to have occurred shortly thereafter; by December Edward ventured without undue risk to attend to the probating of his mother's will and probably the reopening of his printing shop. Both of Mary's sons, John Jr. and Edward, taking advantage of their patrimonial privilege, had become free of the Stationers' Company-John Jr. on April 7, 1662, and Edward on June 27, 1664 45 _ but evidently it was the younger Edward, who proving the more reliable and industrious of the two, had been rewarded by his stepfather with the business. Edward was clothed by the Stationers on June 30, 1668. 46 A survey of London presses made in the next month describes Okes as having two presses, no apprentices, and only two workmen. 47 He is listed as one of four printers "set up since ye Act [of 1662] and contrary to it." 48 L'Estrange planned to indict the other three printers at the next Quarter Sessions; 49 how and why Okes escaped a like charge one can only guess. Edward's career runs from 1666 to 1672, possibly into early 1673, although I have found no imprint dated after 1672. In this interval he printed only an occasional volume for Herringman, who after the London fire gave the bulk of his large printing business to his new neighbor in the Savoy, Thomas Newcomb. Okes also served two young play publishers, William Cademan and Thomas Dring the younger; but since Okes signed his presswork only rarely, the full output of his house is yet to be determined. Okes married Ann Cocke, a widow, of St. Martin, Ludgate, two years his senior, on April 23, 1672 (Foster, loc. cit. ), and bequeathed to her his "coppyes Letters Printing Presses and Tooles in a will drawn April 18, 1673, and executed on May 27. 50 On June 16 she assigned a group of the most popular of Edward's copies to Thomas Vere and John Wright. 51 By June 30, the day on which the clerk entered the assignment in the Stationers' Register, Ann also was issued a commission to administer the "goods rights and credits" left unadministered in the wills of her late husband's mother and stepfather, William Wilson. 52 Ann Okes' alacrity in winding up the affairs of Edward's estate suggests that she was either desperately in need of ready money or very anxious to get her hands on some. At about the same time, or as soon as she could find buyers, she must have busied herself likewise in disposing of Edward's printing materials. His extensive ornament stock, the accumulation of three generations of Okeses and William Wilson, eventually fell into the hands of Robert White, 53 a long established printer of religious matter in Warwick Lane, described in the press survey of 1668 as operating three presses and employing three apprentices and seven workmen. 54 Once White came into possession of Okes' blocks-I found White using them first in 1674-he appears to have employed no other ornamentation despite the fact that his earlier imprints reveal a ready stock which is attractive and not noticeably worn. White continued inserting his newly bought decorations in his books until his death about June 30, 1678. 55 His widow Margaret assumed immediate charge of the business, which had been willed to her, and continued to use the ornament stock in her presswork until she ceased activities late in 1682 or early in 1683. Who next used the blocks in these final decades of the seventeenth century when London printers tended to devote little or no book space to ornamentation I have not been able to learn. Bernard White, formerly an apprentice and journeyman of Robert's, possibly a kinsman, and certainly greatly favored by Robert in his will, seemed a likely candidate, but Bernard's books in the late 1680'5 include none of them. The probability is, however, that this ornament stock passed into another's hands and was used-one block at least, ornament no. 44, appears later in an unsigned volume dated 1697. It is also highly probable that something of the history of these decorations predates Judson's use of them and that there are in this study ramifications of which I have been quite unaware.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. The following is a list of occurrences which I have found of the ornaments, factotums, and initials pictured on the plates accompanying this study. Each of the three types of ornamentation has its own heading and separate series of numbers. The decorative initials in turn have been divided into three alphabets according to relative size in order that the scholar may discern the more easily the similarity of design among different letters of the same alphabet. The entry for each decoration contains this information: (I) an identifying number corresponding to that accompanying the picture of the decoration; (2) the approximate millimeter measurements, with the vertical measurement occurring first; (3) a listing of the books in which the particular decoration is to be found, chronologically arranged and subdivided among the various printers who owned or used the decoration during specific periods of years. "JUDSON" means always Thomas Judson, 1598-1600; "HARRISON," John Harrison (III), 1600-1604; "SNOWDON," George and Lionel Snowdon, partners, 1605-1606; "N. OKES," Nicholas Okes, 1607-1636; "NORTON," John Norton, 1628-1636[-1639]; "N.&amp; J. OKES," Nicholas and John Okes, partners, 1635-1637; "J. OKES," 1637-1643; "M. OKES," Mary Okes, 1643-1645; "WILSON," William Wilson, 1645-1665; "E. OKES," Edward Okes, 1666-1673; "R. WHITE," Robert White, 1674-1678; "M. WHITE," Margaret White, 1678-1683. Books in the following list printed before or during 1640 are cited according to the numbers assigned them in the Pollard and Redgrave S.T.C. The remainder are cited according to the numbers given them in the Wing S.T.C. The brackets enclosing any S.T.C. number indicate that the book has been identified by means of the ornaments as the presswork of a particular printer although his name does not appear in the imprint. A number of the volumes ascribed to printers included in this study are the presswork of several printers. Hence the ascription to a particular printer does not mean that he was necessarily the only one involved in printing the work. The decorations pictured are reproduced at approximately life-size. Perhaps these few caveats should be brought to the attention of those inexperienced in the use of ornaments charts such as the one offered here. Ornament makers seem to be slavishly imitative so that no London printer of the seventeenth century is likely to have a stock of decorations which is entirely different from that of one or many of his contemporaries; in the decorative initials there exist frequently striking similarities. Further I sense an increasing use of metal cast ornaments in this period which means that several printers could own identical decorations. One should realize also that I have attempted always to reproduce the newest and clearest printing of each decoration and that blocks with use over long periods of time tend to become damaged and dirty and hence to change in appearance and measurements. Finally, in studying the ornament stocks of William Wilson and Edward Okes, I was obliged to work with large numbers of unsigned books. My findings for these printers are therefore particularly susceptible to error. ORNAMENTS 1 (44 x 39) McKerrow: 334. HARRISON- 1601: 4941. N.

      <field name="heading_text">The Text of Peele's Edward I by Dora Jean Ashe *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PEELE'S Famous Chronicle of King Edward the First was published in quarto in 1593, with a second edition, printed from the first, appearing in 1599. The author's name is not given on the title pages of the two editions, but on the last page of text in each quarto appears the subscription, Yours. By George Peele Maister of Artes in Oxenford." The date of composition is believed to be 1590-91. 1 The text presented by the two quartos has long been recognized as a corrupt one. A. H. Bullen, who edited Peele's works in 1888, speaks with feeling of the "mutilated form" in which Edward I has come down to us, saying (I, xxxii), ". . . the text throughout is vile. It is only fit reading for students of the rudest build. The labour of the treadmill is child's play to the editing of it." An earlier editor, Alexander Dyce, who issued Peele's works in 1828, 1829, and, in combination with Robert Greene's, 1883, noted (1883 ed., p. 338) that "Both editions abound with the grossest typographical errors; here lines have dropped out, there verses are inserted where they ought not to stand: after a careful revision of the text, I have been obliged to leave some passages in a doubtful state, and others, which defy emendation, in all their old corruption." Sir Walter Greg, in the introduction to the Malone Society Reprint of Edward I issued in 1911, comments (p. vi), "The original [Q1] is a very ordinary piece of presswork of the time, composed with tolerable care but representing a very corrupt text. Moreover, in spite of the unusual length of the play as it has come down to us, it would yet seem that it has been mutilated and possibly some scenes altogether excised." All three of these editors of Edward I apparently believed that the manifest corruptions of the text can be explained in part by some kind of revision and in part by errors in printing, but none attempted to establish the exact nature of the mutilation. It remained for Leo Kirschbaum, in "A Census of Bad Quartos" (The Review of English Studies, XIV, 1938, 20-43), to advance the theory that Edward l represents a text reconstructed through the memories of reporters. According to Kirschbaum (p. 36), "Dyce (that excellent editor!) in the footnotes to his text of . . . King Edward the First . . . presents enough evidence to convince even the most conservative modern textual critic that Q is a bad quarto." Within the confines of his "Census," however, Kirschbaum is able to cite only two specific examples of what he believes to be bad-quarto corruption; hence his theory has not been presented in sufficient detail to establish its validity as the solution to the long-puzzling textual problems of Edward I. The basic problem posed by this text has yet to be solved: granted that the one substantive edition is corrupt, what view of the text is in general best able to explain the kinds of errors with which the play abounds? The discussion which follows is an attempt to indicate a possible answer to this question. It is based on two principal beliefs: first, that a reported text, particularly of the unusual length of Edward I--2980 lines of print, including stage directions, in the Malone Society Reprint--ought to exhibit positive signs of memorial reconstruction, whereas such signs are almost entirely absent in this play; and second, that the hypothesis of a radical and somewhat unskillful stage revision of a Peele manuscript is more tenable in view of the textual evidence than is the hypothesis of reporting. Because the strength of the case for non-authorial stage revision from author's manuscript is in itself a refutation of the memorial-reconstruction theory, I shall in the main here present the affirmative case and point out only briefly the weakness of the case for reporting. The two examples of bad-quarto corruption presented by Kirschbaum are a passage at lines 188-219 (MSR), illustrating blank verse supposedly mangled through reporting; and King Edward's final speech, at 2943-56, which together with an earlier passage at 2235-51 is cited as anticipation-recollection. The first passage- occurs in the section of scene 1 where various offers of largess are being made to the wounded soldiers who have just returned with Edward from a Crusade. Most of the speeches in this portion of the scene are clearly intended as prose, although Q1 presents them predominantly as extremely lame verse. The first four lines of the passage cited by Kirschbaum, however, appear in Q1 as prose; and both Dyce and Bullen present the passage as prose except for the last nine lines. It hence seems likely that this passage represents not blanks verse corrupted by reporting but, at least in part, prose mistakenly set as verse by the Q1 compositor. Verse throughout Edward I is uneven and often corrupt, but its dislocation can be satisfactorily explained on the basis of revision plus compositorial error and need not be taken as an indication that the text has been memorially reconstructed. King Edward's speech at 2943, cited by Kirschbaum as a recollection of an earlier speech at 2235, occurs in the final scene (25), where clear signs of radical cutting appear and where rewriting to gloss over omissions has almost surely taken place. Again it is not necessary to posit reporting to explain the "recollected" passage when another factor, revision, is clearly at work and is capable of offering an adequate explanation which is also consonant with the state of the text in other sections of the play. In my own investigation of the play, I have found only one other possible anticipation-recollection, and here the passage involved is a "jingle" which could have been repeated intentionally in the two musical-farcical scenes in which it appears. The first occurrence is at 354-61, in scene 2: Friar. Heere sweare I by my shauen crowne, VVench if I giue thee a gay greene gowne, Ile take thee vp as I laid thee downe, And neuer bruze nor batter thee. Nouice. O sweare not maister, flesh is fraile, VVenche when the signe is in the taile, Mightie is loue and will preuaile, This Churchman dooth but flatter thee. Three of these lines are repeated in scene 8, in a passage again involving the lecherous Welsh friar (1487-97): (Lluellen) . . . O Frier wil nothing serue your turne but Larkes. Are such fine birds for such course Clarkes, None but my Marian can serue your turne. Eli. Cast water, for the house wil burne. Frier. O mistres mistres flesh is fraile, Ware when the signe is in the taile, Mightie is loue and doth preuaile. Lluellen. Therefore Frier shalt thou not faile, But mightily your foe assaile: And thrash this Potter with thy flaile, Since the nearly identical three lines shared by these two passages in both cases are appropriate to the subject-matter and rhyming-schemes of the rest of the jingles in which they appear, the repetition is to that extent intentional. The substitution in the second passage of "ware" for "wench" is more likely an adaptation of the first passage to the different circumstances in scene 8 than a compositorial or scribal error. 2 In scene 2 the word "wench" is needed because in the preceding line the Novice is addressing the Friar, whereas in the last three lines he turns to the girl Guenthian. In scene 8 all the lines are addressed to Lluellen's wife Elinor, so that a second term of address is not necessary. There is no reason to suspect memorial reconstruction in the recurrence of these three lines; either Peele or a later reviser could be responsible. There are other repetitions of rhyming lines within scene 8 which seem clearly intentional, for example these two passages at 1423-26, and at 1431-34: Eli. Now Frier sith your Lord is gone, And you and I are left alone, What can the Frier doe or saie, To passe the wearie time away ? Friar. What can the Frier doe or saie? To passe the wearie time awaie: More dare I doe then he dare saie, Because he doubts to haue away. Such repetitions differ from the "flesh is frail" passages by recurring in much closer proximity, but they bear out the impression of intentional repetition conveyed by all the musical-farcical scenes. Inane repetition of single words or phrases, often a characteristic of bad quartos, is noticeable in Edward I chiefly in the frequent occurrence of the word "sweet," especially in forms of address like "Sweet Nell" and "Sweet Ned." This word (plus one "sweetly," one "sweetness," and one "sweetest") occurs 49 times in the play, according to my count. Scene 10, a long continuous-action scene of which part may be a later revisional addition, contains 16 "sweet's," more than twice the number to be found in any other one scene. Thirty of the 49 occurrences are in speeches of Edward (20) and Queen Elinor (10), usually in references to each other. It is true, however, that "Peele is fond of these tasteless repetitions." 3 &gt; and that many of the "sweet's" in Edward I must be the author's own, inserted principally to point up the ironic contrast between Edward's concept of his queen and her actual cruel nature. There are approximately 22 occurrences of "sweet" in Peele's Arraignment of Paris, in 1359 lines of print (MSR); and 31 in David and Bethsabe, in 2012 lines of print (MSR). "Fair" is the favorite descriptive word in The Arraignment appearing some 94 times. In view of Peele's predilection for repetition, some of it "tasteless" but some effective, there is no reason to suspect that the memory of a reporter is involved in the texts of any of these plays. 4 In addition to the negligible signs of bad-quarto corruption exhibited by Edward 1, there is almost no evidence bearing on the identity of reporters. It is sometimes possible to determine the identity of bad-quarto reporters by tracing the patterns of anticipations-recollections and other significant repetitions through the parts of the various characters, noting which parts share lines with other parts and which borrow only-or principally- from their own previous or subsequent lines. 5 When significant repetitions are lacking, as in Edward l, it is necessary to apply almost exclusively the more subjective evidence of "well-reported" passages. Such evidence in the case of this play does not favor the hypothesis of memorial reconstruction. The most consistently "good" parts are those of lesser characters in the predominantly- historical scenes, notably Baliol and Lluellen. If these actors were the reporters, speeches by other characters would presumably improve when they were on or near the stage and degenerate when they were absent. But King Edward and Queen Elinor are sometimes good, as in scene I and, despite cuts, in scene 25, when no one present can be suspected of being the reporter(s); and they are sometimes bad, as in scenes 10 and 13, when the same situation obtains. If Edward I were a reported text, a logical pattern should emerge from the evidence either of repetitions or of good passages, if not from both. The case against Edward I as a bad quarto is one of insufficient evidence: if a play 2980 lines long, exhibiting manifest textual corruption, were reported, there should be evidence of the kinds of memorial error to be found in other reported texts. When such evidence is lacking, reconstruction from memory cannot be postulated with any confidence; and when evidence strongly indicative of another type of textual history is present, the case for memorial reconstruction becomes progressively weaker as the alternative theory gains strength. There is evidence which permits these hypotheses about Edward I to be presented with considerably more confidence than the hypothesis of memorial reconstruction: (1) that parts at least of the text are based on Peele's own manuscript, either foul papers or an author's fair copy; (2) that the holograph has been revised by someone other than Peele for modified stage performance; and (3) that contemporary theatrical conditions provide the basis for an explanation of this thoroughgoing revision of Peele's manuscript. There are three principal types of evidence suggestive of author's manuscript underlying parts of Edward I. The first is the subscription which appears on the last page of text in Q1 and Q2: Yours. By George Peele Maister of Artes in Oxenford." Greg's comment (MSR, vi), that this subscription was "evidently copied from the manuscript," is a reasonable one, since it is hardly the kind of flourish one would expect a compositor to add to his copy or a reporter to append to a memorially-reconstructed manuscript. A theatrical reviser, working from author's autograph, might just possibly copy such a signature; but the signature itself can best be explained as representing what it purports to be, Peele's own signature to his play, appended either to his foul papers or to his own fair copy made to be sent to the theatre. Hence author's manuscript would seem to underlie at least this last page of the printed text. The second indication of author's manuscript is the phraseology of the stage directions. The directions in Edward I are in the main fairly long and noticeably descriptive, not only of action but also of the personal appearance or mental attitude of the characters. Some of the directions might be explained as examples of the usual bad-quarto descriptiveness, but an impressive number are suggestive not so much of action or appearances already witnessed on stage as they are of an author's imagination envisaging what he hopes can be conveyed in stage presentation. This is assuredly not an easy distinction to make, but these directions seem especially suggestive of author's manuscript: 46-55: The Trumpets sound, and enter the traine, viz. his maimed Souldiers with headpeeces and Garlands on them, euery man with his red Crosse on his coate: the Ancient borne in a Chaire, his Garland and his plumes on his headpeece, his Ensigne in his hand. Enter after them Glocester and Mortimer bareheaded, &amp; others as many as may be. Then Longshanks and his wife Elinor, Edward Couchback, and lone and Signior Moumfort the Earle of Leicesters prisoner, with Sailers and Souldiers, and Charles de Moumfort his brother. Especially noteworthy here is the tentative direction for supernumeraries, "as many as may be," and descriptive words like "maimed" and "bareheaded," as well as the unusual length of the direction. The last three lines list as entering Signior Moumfort and his brother, neither of whom is mentioned in the scene which follows. Later (613ff.) it is revealed that Lluellen's betrothed wife, Elinor, has been captured while on her way by ship from France and is being held by King Edward. According to Holinshed (1587 ed.), 6 Elinor's father was Simon de Montfort Earl of Leicester, who was slain at the Battle of Evesham in 1265 and whose family had fled to France. Elinor's brother Emerick accompanied her from France and was also captured. Hence some editors have interpreted the stage direction as referring to Elinor de Montfort, the Earl of Leicester's daughter, and her brother Emerick (see Bullen, I, 87, quoting P. A. Daniel). Such an interpretation presupposes that Peele ignored Holinshed's date for the capture, 1276, and considered that it occurred in time for the captives to be present in scene I, when Edward is returning to London in 1273 from his Crusade. Another possibility is that Peele intended the reference to mean two of de Montfort's older sons, perhaps Guy and Simon or possibly Guy and Charles of Sicily, his cousin. Guy, according to Holinshed (p. 275), had assassinated Edward's cousin and Crusade companion, Prince Henry of Germany, at Viterbo, Italy, in 1272. Edward, returning from his Crusade via Italy, requested Pope Gregory to send for Guy de Montfort to answer for the murder; Guy apparently ignored the command, however, and was excommunicated (p. 277). Perhaps Peele is here envisaging what might have happened if Edward had succeeded in capturing his cousin's assassin who was also an enemy of the English crown. Whatever the interpretation, the direction may well indicate foul papers by embodying a plot element left undeveloped by Peele. 117-19: The Queene Mother being set on the one side, and Queene Elinor on the other, the king sitteth in the middest mounted highest, and at his feete the Ensigne underneath him. 130-1: Vse Drummes, Trumpets, and Ensignes, and then speake Edward. 467: Make as if yee would fight. 643: Lluellen reades his brother Dauids letters. (Identity of the writer is not given in the text-proper.) 1013-14: Then Lluellen spieth Elinor and Mortimor, and saieth thus. (No speech prefix for the ensuing speech.) 1100-1: Enter lack and thc Harper getting a standing against thc Queene comes in. 1368-9: They arc all clad in greene &amp;c. sing &amp;c. Blithe and bonny, the song ended Lluellen speaketh. 1897-8: Enter the Nouice and his company to giue the Queene Musicke at her Tent. 2133-36: After the Christening and marriage done, the Harrolds hauing attended, they passe ouer, the bride is led by two Noble men, Edmund of Lancaster, and the Earle of Sussex, and the Bishop. 2141-2: Then all passe in their order to the kings pauilion, the king sits in his Tent with his pages about him. 2182-3: After the showe, and the King and Queen with all the lordes and ladies in place, Longshanks speaketh. 2428-30: Exeunt ambo from Wales. Heres thunder and lightning when the Queen comes in. Enter Queene Elinor and lone. 2755: The King beholdeth his brother wofully. 2891: Shee sodainly dies at the Queenes beds feete. The stage directions of other Peele plays, especially David and Bethsabe 7 and The Arraignment of Paris, share certain traits of the Edward I directions. " Dauid in his gowne walking sadly" (David and Bethsabe, D2, 6) is reminiscent of the Edward I direction, The King beholdeth his brother wofully" (2755). The two scenes being described in the following stage directions, the first from David and Bethsabe and the second from Edward 1, are similarly treated both in phrasing and in the amount of detail given: B1v, 1-3: He [speaker of the Prologue] drawes a curtaine, and discouers Bethsabe with her maid bathing ouer a spring: she sings, and Dauid sits aboue vewing her. 1595-99: King Edward, Edmund, and Gloster, goes into the Queenes Chamber, the Queenes Tent opens, shee is discouered in her bed, attended by Mary Dutches of Lancaster. Ione of Acon her daughter, &amp; the Queen dandles his [Edward's] young sonne. The Arraignment of Paris shares with Edward I a tendency to repeat, with variations, the pattern "after such-and-such an action so-and-so speaketh"; compare, for example, Edward I, 1369, ". . . the song ended Lluellen speaketh" with The Arraignment, A4v, 25, The songe being done, Iuno speakes and C1v, 7, The song being ended Helen departeth, &amp; Paris Speaketh." Both plays employ directions which describe past action; similar to the Edward I direction at 2133-36, quoted above, is this direction from The Arraignment (B3, 29-30): The storme being past of thunder &amp; lightning, &amp; Ate hauing trudled the ball into place, crying Fatum Troie, Iuno taketh the bal vp &amp; speaketh." The Arraignment is also the only Peele play besides Edward I which makes use of "ambo" in stage directions. This term, fairly frequent in Edward 1, occurs four times in The Arraignment, twice on B2v, 6 and 15, indicating the lines of a song which are to be sung as a duet, and twice in the direction Exeunt ambo" (B2v, 23; C1v, 38). A final point of similarity between the stage directions in the early quartos of Peele's plays is that characters' names are usually set in italic type, not in the roman type more frequently employed in such instances, a fact which suggests that the names appeared in the manuscripts in Italian rather than secretary (English) script. David and The Arraignment, like Edward 1, employ italic type almost without exception for all words in stage directions. So does The Battle of Alcazar for the directions which Greg believes are taken from MS; the rest, supplied according to Greg's theory by a theatrical reviser making an abridged stage-version from the full prompt book, are in roman type throughout. 8 The Old Wives Tale exhibits both roman and italic type for characters' names, with roman predominating. From these points of similarity it can at least be suspected that the Edward I directions preserve traits which are traceable to Peele himself. A characteristic which has at times been advanced as indicative of author's manuscript, especially foul papers, is the use of different names or designations for the same characters in different portions of a play. This argument has been advanced particularly in connection with Romeo and Juliet Q2 , as an aid in establishing the generally-accepted theory that the copy for this quarto was foul papers or a transcript of foul papers. 9 The same trait is seen in Edward 1, in the different designations for the King. Edward appears in ten of the play's 25 scenes and is designated in stage directions and speech prefixes as follows (scene divisions from MSR): Scene 1: Longshanks in stage directions and speech prefixes, except on A4, where Edward appears in one stage direction and one speech prefix. These two occurrences follow a long speech by the King in which he refers to himself three times as Edward and only once as Longshanks. Scene 3: Stage direction king Edward and the King; speech prefixes Longshanks. Scene 5: Stage directions and speech prefixes Longshanks. Scene 6: Stage direction Edward Longshanks; speech prefixes Longshanks. Scene 10: Stage directions once King Edward Longshanks, once King Edward, once Longshanks, once the king; speech prefixes Longshanks. Scene 12: Stage directions once Longshanks, twice the King; speech prefixes Longshanks except on H2v and H3, where three Edwards occur (these are speeches in which the King reveals his identity to Lluellen and is immediately addressed as "Edward"). Scene 13: Stage directions the King twice, Longshanks twice, Edward King once; speech prefixes Longshanks. Scene 21: Stage direction (one) King Edward and Edward; speech prefixes Edward. Scene 23: Speech prefixes Edward, once K. Edward. Scene 25: Stage directions the King twice, Edward once; speech prefixes King. The King gains in dignity in the last three scenes in which he appears, the somewhat jibing designation "Longshanks" being finally dispensed with. In most of the scenes in which "Longshanks" is used as the predominant speech prefix for Edward, no one actually addresses him in this fashion. His mother refers to him as Longshanke your king" at line 39, and he calls himself "Longshanks" at 129; otherwise this designation is employed largely by his enemies. The evidence of author's manuscript to be found in Peele's signature, the phraseology of the stage directions, and the varying designations for King Edward is strong enough, I believe, to serve as a foundation on which to base a second hypothesis, that a non-authorial revision of the manuscript is also involved in the textual history of Edward 1. There are three principal elements in the plot of this play: the basic historical events (predominant in scenes I, the first and last parts of 2, 3 except the last 21 lines of text, 4, 5, 9, 10, part of 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 21, 23, 24, 25); songs, dances, and farcical scenes involving Welsh characters (predominant in the middle section of 2, 7, 8, 11, part of 12, part of 24); and the vilification of Queen Elinor, a Spanish princess (last part of 3; parts of 6, 10, and 13; 16, 20, and 22). When the 25 scenes are considered from the standpoint of their predominant plot elements, this general pattern emerges: the historical scenes contain the best blank verse and the most satisfactory passages from a literary standpoint but also exhibit the most serious signs of cutting; the farcical scenes are at times confused because prose passages are set as verse, but the rhymed dialogue and the songs, where words are given, seem reasonably satisfactory, and no serious signs of cutting emerge, although comic additions are a strong possibility; the scenes having as their main purpose the vilification of the Queen are usually bad in all respects, presenting poor blank verse and often confused or inadequately explained plot-events. I believe that the historical scenes are in the main Peele's, although severe cutting has caused frequent and widespread textual garbling. The musical-farcical scenes also probably originated with Peele, whose predilection for such scenes is well illustrated in other plays, but comic and perhaps musical additions have very likely been made. The occasional criticism of the Queen to be found in predominantly historical scenes is almost certainly part of the original Peele play, but the scenes in which Elinor is most vilified I believe have been added, perhaps under the influence of a popular ballad which could have provided details for this further vilification. A theatrical reviser has, I believe, altered the text of Peele's play in two ways -by cutting passages and incidents, especially in the historical scenes; and by adding other passages, particularly in the scenes vilifying the Queen. The motive for the abridgment was presumably to make room for the additions, which in turn present plot elements expected to popularize the play with audiences, very likely provincial ones. 10 Probable cuts have occurred in the following portions of the text: 11 Lluellen's speech, 329-41; "her" in line 335 lacks an antecedent. Scene 3: the initial stage direction calls for 23 people, 20 of whom are mute; lines 725-7 may be entirely out of place (Bullen's conjecture, 1, 115, n. 6); the awarding of the Scottish crown to Baliol is sudden and his acceptance speech brief and, at 752-3, doubtful in meaning. 1138, where Bullen suggests (1, 133, n. 2) that lines are omitted in Jone's speech before this surviving first line. The compressed and terse middle-historical scenes, especially 9 and the first part of 10, where historical plot-elements are presented abruptly with little explanation or motivation, while the scenes involving the Queen and the Welsh sub-characters are presented in detail. 1677, where Edmund's question about "the Abbies here in Wales" is scarcely answered at all, whereas a fairly long and somewhat disjointed discussion of Lluellen and his Robin Hood disguise ensues. 2943-56 (the passage cited by Kirschbaum as memorially recollected), where at least part of Edward's speech is clearly out of place. Here a messenger has just arrived to tell the King of Baliol's renewed revolt in Northurnberland, whereupon Edward laments that Lluellen also is in renewed rebellion and that Mortimor must haste to Wales to oppose him while Edward, Elinor, Gloster, "and the rest" will deal with the Scots. Lluellen and Queen Elinor are both dead at this time. Dyce has suggested that the lines should appear at 2238, where Edward is making a similar disposition of his forces, some ("Edmund, Gloster, and the rest") to aid him in opposing the Scots while Mortimor leads the fight against Lluellen. Kirschbaum traces striking verbal similarities between this misplaced passage and the one at 2235, believing that its repetition at 2943 is a sign of memorial failure. But it seems doubtful that even a bad-quarto reporter would thus, in the last lines of the play, refer to people who are dead and to action which is long past. Historically, John Baliol actually did renew his enmity with Edward and had to be dealt with again. Perhaps the news of his rebellion, as brought by the messenger, is in its correct place and the ensuing lines about Lluellen (who at 2235 was rebelling anew) represent a misplaced manuscript fragment, possibly an alternative version of the earlier lines. 2964, where a similar error has taken place. This line, a stage direction, reads, Enter Mortimor with the head." The reference is presumably to Lluellen's head, which appeared on a spear at 2632. The direction is obviously out of place at 2964, because, in the play's final speech, Gloster is lamenting Jone's death, saying, ". . . how ought [oft] haue I beheld? / [stage direction here intervenes] Thy eies thy lookes thy lippes and euerie part." If Jone had been beheaded, one might wonder if her head is here brought out on stage to serve as a visual representation of Gloster's references to her eyes, her looks (perhaps "locks": Dyce, 1883 ed., p. 415, note), and so on. Since she was not, and since Lluellen's head has no place here, it seems that somehow a stage direction once belonging at an earlier point has crept in here. A badly confused manuscript must underlie Q1 in this final scene. The stage direction probably belongs at 2942, because a messenger there announces (2938-4I) that Mortimor "is here at hande in purpose to present your Highnes with his signes of victorie, ...." In Holinshed, Mortimor brings Leolin's (Lluellen's) head to the king in London on the end of a staff. There are indications at 2378-9 and 2632 that Lluellen's head was so treated in Peele's play. Hence this direction almost certainly points to cutting in the final scene, only the misplaced stage direction remaining to indicate that Lluellen's head, "the sign of victory," once was brought on stage again. Dyce (1829 ed., I, 201, n.) finds "very probable" the speculation of the editor of Dodsley's Old Plays (1827) that this stage direction indicates an ending for the play more in keeping with the bloody nature of the historical plot than the present ending of Gloster's lament for Jone. Since Peele's signature immediately follows this speech, however, I think that the speech may well represent the original ending and that cutting earlier in the scene is indicated. Cutting of the type here cited was presumably done to make room for additions, which I believe occur most noticeably in scenes 3 (the last 21 lines of text only) and 16 (the Mayoress-of-London scenes); 20 and 22 (the sinking-of- theQueen scenes); and parts of 6, 10 and 13. Most of these scenes are part of the vilification of the Queen plot-element. The last part of scene 3, as it stands in QI, has no connection with the earlier portions of the scene, which depicts the crowning of John Baliol as King of Scotland and ends at 807, with the direction Exeunt." Then, at 808-9, appears the direction, Enter the Maris [Mayoress] of London from Church, and Musicke before her." The first speech, at 810, is Queen Elinor's; in it she addresses both Jone and Gloster, but Gloster remains mute throughout the brief scene. The final direction, after Exeunt Maris, &amp; omnes" at 830, is "Exeunt Glocester and the Queene," with no reference being made to Jone's presence. Most modern editors add a Manent Elinor, Jone, and Glocester" to the simple Exeunt" at 807, and also an entry for Jone at the beginning of scene 3, because there is no indication of her presence in that scene. These emendations are of little help in clearing up the confusion here, since they assume that the crowning of Baliol took place in the London streets, an assumption which is neither historically true, according to Holinshed's account, nor likely from any point of view. Actually the scene in question has no connection with either scene 3 or scene 4 and exists for the sole purpose of paving the way for scene 16, another extraneous scene. The situation in the first of these extraneous scenes, the last lines of 3, is so tersely presented that it leaves the intent in some doubt. The wife of London's Mayor, leaving church with musicians playing before her, is accosted by the Queen and her party and asked to explain the reason for her celebration. The Mayoress replies that she is giving thanks for the birth of a son and hopes that her action can in no way "offend the good." The Queen answers sharply, whereupon the Mayoress flees with the exclamation, "Alas I am vndone, it is the Queen, / The proudest Queene that euer England knew." The Queen's only comment is, "Come Gloster, lets to the court and reuel there." Thus the scene ends. Between it and scene 16 no further reference is made to the Mayoress except in scene 10, which may also in part be an added scene. An enigmatic four-line speech at 1869-72 in scene 10 is assigned to "L. Maris." It is apparently an aside and consists of a reproach to the Queen for ordering King Edward to leave her. Line 1869, "Proud incest in the craddle of disdaine," makes little sense unless it is an anticipatory reference to the Queen's confession in scene 25 that she and Edward's brother Edmund were once lovers. This line, and the fact that the entire speech is extraneous, suggest strongly that it is a later addition. In the stage direction at 1595-99, opening scene 10, one of the attendants of the Queen and the infant Prince is listed as Mary Dutches of Lancaster." Bullen's note (I, 154, n. 1, quoting P. A. Daniel) points out that neither of Edmund Duke of Lancaster's wives was named Mary and suggests that perhaps "Mary Mayoress of London" is meant, since this character refers to herself as Mary in scene 16. Scene 16 presents the aftermath of scene 3. It occurs illogically between two terse scenes summing up, mostly in stage directions, the outcome of the battles in Wales. The Queen enters alone at 2306 and says, "Now fits the time to purge our melancholly, and bee / reuenged vppon this London Dame." Why this battle-scarred time is fitting and why revenge is indicated at all are not explained. The Queen sets herself to think of some tortures for the Mayoress, and then calls for the unfortunate lady. Her first words to the Mayoress (2317-19) do not seem to indicate that the latter has previously acted as an attendant for her and the Prince: Now mistres Maris you haue attendance vrgde, And therefore to requite your curtesie, Our minde is to bestow an office on you straight. The Mayoress is then offered her choice between the offices of nurse and laundress. When she elects to be a nurse to Prince Edward, the Queen has her Spanish attendant Katherina bind the Mayoress to a chair and apply an adder to her breast, saying sadistically, "why so now shee is a Nurse, sucke on sweet Babe" (2331). Thereupon the Queen and Katherina depart and the Mayoress, left alone, dies. No provision is made for removing the body, as scene 17, opening immediately after the Mayoress's last line, begins with an entrance for Lluellen and David and returns to the battle-scenes interrupted by this abrupt murder-scene. The events so briefly covered in scenes 3 and 16 of Edward I are presented in logical if blood-chilling detail in an anonymous ballad called "A Warning-Piece to England Against Pride and Wickedness," which consists of a 20-stanza attack on Queen Elinor and her Spanish pride. Bullen (I, xxxiii) says that this ballad has been assigned to the days of Queen Mary, but he suspects it of being one of many such ballads written immediately after the destruction of the Armada. There seems no way of being sure whether the ballad antedated the play or vice versa . 12 In stanzas 9-14 (Bullen, I, 79-81) the ballad presents in logical sequence the story of the Queen's animosity toward the Mayor of London's wife (not herein called the Mayoress). It explains that the Queen's anger over seeing anyone except herself so full of mirth and joy motivated a resolve, taken immediately after the church- encounter, to murder the Mayor's wife. This murder the Queen devised carefully by inviting the Mayor's wife to become her attendant, then by forcing her to perform menial tasks, and finally, having sent her secretly to Wales, by binding her "at twelve a clock at night" to a post and applying two snakes to her breast. The clarity and detail of the ballad account of the murder, and the possibility that the ballad may antedate Edward 1, suggest that it was the source for the similar account given in the play, although of course both ballad and play may depend on a common source no longer extant. It is possible that scenes 20 and 22 have also been added to Edward I in the course of a theatrical revision. These present the episodes which the Q1 title-page describes as "the sinking of Queene Elinor, who sunck / at Charingcrosse, and rose againe at Potters-/hith, now named Queenehith." Ballad stanzas 16-18 cover the same material, although in the ballad the Queen is accompanied to Charing Cross by Edward, whereas in the play Jone is with her. According to the ballad, a strange tempest arose as the Queen was returning by coach to London, presumably from Wales, and the horses were suddenly unable to make the coach move from the spot. This phenomenon was a judgment from Heaven sent because the Queen had murdered the Mayor's wife. When Edward thereupon accuses her of the deed, she hopes that the ground may open up and swallow her if she is guilty of so vile a thing. With that at Charing-cross she sunk Into the ground alive; And after rose with life again, In London, at Queenhithe. 13 Scene 20 of Edward I presents the episode of the sinking. As was true of scenes 3 and 16, it has no connection with the scenes before and after it, both of which are concerned with the struggle in Wales. The scene begins at 2429 with the direction, Heres thunder and lightning when the Queen comes in," followed by the direction at 2430, Enter Queene Elinor and lone." The 30-line scene (including stage directions) is set as prose, but could equally well be somewhat lame verse. No coach is concerned here, nor is a return to London mentioned. Jone makes the accusation which Edward made in the ballad, the Queen wishes that she may sink down to Hell if the charge is true, and forthwith she is swallowed up. Scene 22, presenting material covered in the ballad only by the two lines which state that the Queen "rose with life again . . . at Queenhithe," recounts in more detail this rising. The initial stage direction, at 2506-7, reads, Enter the Potter and the Potterswife, called the Potters hiue dwelling there, and Iohn her man." Confusion exists both in the phraseology and in the fact that no further reference is made to the Potter. The first 20 lines of dialogue consist of humorous exchanges between the Potter's wife and John. Then the Queen rises from the ground and is recognized by the Potter's wife, since the news of her sinking that same day has apparently spread rapidly. The wife offers aid to the Queen just as a shout "Westward ho" is heard, and the scene ends as John leads the Queen to a boat which will convey her back to court. This scene is apparently correctly printed as prose throughout. A reference to the Queen's sinking occurs in scene 23, when messengers arrive in Wales to inform Edward of events in London. The message presumably containing news of the Queen's sinking is given by Edward to Edmund with the remark (2587-88): Nobles my Queene is sicke but what is more, Reed brother Edmund reede a wondrous chance. The stage direction (2589) states, Edmund reedes a line of the Queens sincking." This "line" is not in the text and the reference to it may indicate that Edmund reads part of the ballad from a MS scroll. Edward exclaims that this sinking is a result of pride, and suggests that he and Edmund disguise themselves as the French friars whom the Queen has sent for to hear her dying confessions. Scene 25, the long continuous-action scene with which the play ends, presents these confessions with no further reference to the sinking. Such confessions are also briefly mentioned in the ballad, where few details are given. The confession-scene in Edward I is better than any of the earlier scenes concerning the Queen and is too integral a part of the denouement to be a later addition. There is no reason to believe that the story of the sinking was originally in any way connected with this later scene, however, and the reference to it in scene 23 could easily have been added. I believe, on the basis of both the internal evidence of the scenes themselves and their extraneous nature as regards the rest of the play, that scenes 3 (last part, as explained), 16, 20, and 22 were added to the version of Edward I which Peele originally wrote. A case can also be made for the addition of part of scene so, a continuous action scene: which exhibits great textual confusion. It is the second longest scene in Edward 1, containing 301 lines of print in the text-proper, excluding stage directions. Only scene 2, with its three sections and 371 lines, is longer. Scene 10 presents mainly the christening of Prince Edward and the betrothal of Jone to Gloster. 14 The last portion of this extremely confused scene, approximately from 1801 to 1866, where the episode is concluded some thirty lines before the end of the scene, presents a situation which has its counterpart in the ballad. In Edward 1, the Queen has been accused by Edward of Spanish pride and in a fit of pique exclaims, "Fie fie me thinkes I am not where I shoulde bee" (1790-99). To make amends the King asks Elinor to request anything that will "perfect her content," whereupon she replies (1815-1827): Qu. Elinor. Then shal my wordes make many a bosom bleede. Reede Ned thy Queenes request lapt vp in rime, And saie thy Nell had skil to choose her time. Read the paper Rice. The pride of Englishmens long haire, Is more then Englands Queene can beare: VVomens right breast cut them off al, And let the great tree perish with the small. Longsh. VVhat means my louelie Elinor by this ? Qu. Elinor. Not be denide for my request it is. The rime is, that mens beards and womens breasts bee cutte off. &amp;c. Edward circumvents the Queen's diabolical suggestion by firmly maintaining that he and she shall be the first victims of the decree. Since Elinor is not willing to accede to this condition, she does not press her suit and the incident is closed. The ballad version of this episode is much more clearly presented in stanzas 4-7. Here the Queen's requests are not made simultaneously. Edward proclaims throughout the land the Queen's first decree, that every man must "be cut and polled all, Or shaved very near." Then the Queen, still not content, requests that every woman's right breast be cut away, adding that burning irons should then be used to stanch the flow of blood. Edward, to foil this request, calls for burning irons and tells the Queen, "I will begin with thee," whereupon she relents and kneels to ask his pardon. Whether Peele intended to include this episode in his play cannot be determined with any certainty. The episode is without doubt presented in garbled form in the play. It looks as if someone inserted the lines, The rime is, that . . . ," in a desperate effort to explain what is going on. Rice, of course, has no business appearing in this scene; he is one of Lluellen's followers and an implacable enemy of Edward. 15 The episode is so garbled that neither Peele nor a reviser could have written it in its present form. Absurd as it is, it fits into the context of the scene better than the previously discussed ballad elements do-with the difference that the latter are whole scenes, while this is only one episode of a single long scene-and it is possible that it existed in some form in Peele's foul papers. In that case, the garbling could be due to the compression which a continuous- action scene often indicates. The case for additions to Peele's play rests principally on the evidence of the vilification scenes here discussed. I believe that parts of scenes 6 and 13 may also have been added, these scenes being much like scene 10 in tone and subject-matter. Additions of "less seemly jests" (Greg's phrase in Two Elizabethan Stage Abridgements) and possibly of songs may have been made in the musical-farcical scenes, but there is little chance of distinguishing between the parts which Peele wrote and the parts which could have been added later. The Robin Hood scenes (7 and 8) might or might not be Peele's. The idea probably originated with him, because the scenes present a good opportunity for the kind of rhyming dialogue and interspersed songs which Peele liked. There are references to the Robin Hood disguises of Lluellen and his men elsewhere in the play, although the longest passage containing such references (1679-1710) comes in scene 10, a much-garbled scene. The primary reason for the non-authorial revision of Peele's play must have been to offer Edward l as a stronger competitor of currently popular plays. The anti-Spanish element was emphasized much more strongly than Peele had originally intended, although this element must always have been present in the play. Crowd-pleasers like the murder scene and the Queen's mysterious sinking at Charing Cross, popularized by the ballad, were I think added. Coarse jests at the expense of, and by, the Welsh Friar were very likely added to the already existing ones. Possibly the Robin Hood scenes were augmented to compete with plays like George a Greene and even perhaps with a lost Robin Hood play. 16 The play that resulted has a bit of everything then popular on the Elizabethan stage-historical scenes with their battles and bloody heads on spears, songs, farcical scenes with broad humor, Robin Hood episodes, and hearty vilification of the pet abominations of the day, Catholicism and the Spaniards. The fact that the play is an unwieldy monstrosity would not be as apparent during stage presentation as it is when the text is read. The revision must have been made sometime between the composition of Edward I by Peele in 1590-91 and its appearance in quarto form in 1593. References in Henslowe's diary to a play called Longshanks, acted by the Admiral's men as "ne" in 1595, may well relate to Peele's play. The designation "ne" may mean simply that the play was new to this company. 17 The Q1 title-page specifies no acting history. Greg believes Edward I to have been Edward Alleyn's personal property, since Alleyn sold a play called Longshanks to Admiral's in 1602 (MSR, vi). The question then arises of how Alleyn got possession of the play. A possible answer is that he got it from the Queen's men. 18 The Old Wives Tale, according to the title-page of Q1 (1595), belonged to Queen's. Greg, in Two Abridgements, has demonstrated that Robert Greene's Orlando Furioso was a Queen's play which came into the possession of Alleyn and Admiral's when the Queen's men went to the provinces. It is extremely doubtful that Peele wrote Edward I for Alleyn personally in 1590-91. I suggest that he wrote it for the Queen's men, as he did The Old Wives Talc in the same period (composition date ca. 1590). When the Queen's men departed for the provinces, they could have sold Edward I to Alleyn, as they did Orlando. It is possible that both sales occurred at the same time, in the summer of 1591. The play thus sold to Alleyn would presumably have been the prompt book of Edward 1, made from Peele's manuscript. But the Queen's company, which according to Greg's hypothesis concocted the bad-quarto version of Orlando to act in the provinces after the sale of the prompt book to Alleyn, may well have engaged in additional double-dealing concerning the Edward I sale. I suggest that they retained Peele's manuscript, perhaps in a fairly muddled but reasonably complete state, and made it the basis of a revision on which they planned to base a new prompt book. Deficiencies in the manuscript may in part explain why the Queen's men bothered with revision at all, instead of simply basing a new prompt book on the manuscript. Another reason is that the Queen's men, since they had provincial performance in mind, were especially interested in audience-pleasers. Hence they cut Peele's historical scenes to the bone and added the other elements here discussed. Although there are places where the requirements of stage directions from Peele's manuscript would be impossible for a provincial company (the number of supernumeraries called for in scene 3, for instance), these requirements could be ignored or altered in the course of making a transcript to serve as prompt. The minimum cast for Edward 1, excluding supers, is approximately 12 actors, of whom 3 or 4 are boys. Being a company particularly interested in profit, as the low ebb of their fortunes at this time indicates, the Queen's men could easily have sold their revised author's manuscript to a publisher after making a prompt-book transcript from it. This theory, although of course speculative, is more credible than the alternative one that Alleyn himself authorized such a poor revision and then allowed it to be sold to a publisher-or the incredible possibility that the play as it stands in Q1 represents Peele's manuscript as he himself left it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * The present article was in the editor's hands before I had an opportunity to read an unpublished doctoral dissertation by Frank S. Hook, George Peele's Edward I (Yale, 1952). Mr. Hook's view of the text will, I understand, be presented in his proposed edition of the play, to be included in the Yale Works of Peele presently appearing under the general editorship of Charles T. Prouty. As I understand the positions, Mr. Hook and I are in substantial agreement that the text is non-reported yet revised; however, Mr. Hook believes that Peele himself made the revisions and that the extant text then served as the basis for London performances, whereas I feel very strongly that non-authorial revision, probably for provincial performance (as presented below) is responsible for the state of the Q1 text. 1 see E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, III, 460; E. G. Fleay's earlier (1891) advocacy of the 1590-91 dating is here cited. Harold M. Dowling, in "The Date and Order of Peele's Plays," Notes and Queries CLXIV (March 18, 1933), 184, attributes Edward I to the winter of 1591, citing lines quoted from Peele's Polyhymnia (1590) and Descensus Astraeae (written before October 29, 1591), and literal parallels between Edward I and Marlowe's Edward II, a play which also contains echoes of Peele's Descensus . 2 Note however a similar variant in a repeated passage in Peele's Old Wives Tale where compositorial error in the first occurrence is likely (italics mine): (D4v, 22-23) Head: Gently dip, but not too deepe, For feare you make the golden birde to weepe, (E4, 8-9) Voyce: Gently dip: but not too deepe; For feare you make the goulde beard to weepe. 3 Bullen, I, 98, n. 1. The reference is to the phrase, repeated in consecutive lines, "Sprung (descended) from the loins of . . ." (300-1). See also Bullen I, 111, n. 3, concerning the repetition of the word "welcome" twice in a single line (618). 4 Harry R. Hoppe has suggested in a brief footnote ( The Bad Quarto of Romeo and Juliet, 1948, P. 76, n. 1) that Peele's The Old Wives Tale, Q1 1595, is a bad quarto, hut the general nature of the text does not seem to warrant such a designation. All five plays of Peele which survive appear to be abridged but non-reported acting versions. 5 This is the method employed, in the main, in Chapter IV of my unpublished doctoral dissertation, A Survey of Non-Shakespearean Bad Quartos, University of Virginia, 1953. 6 Historical facts in Edward I are only generally correct and do not correspond too exactly to the version given by Holinshed; however, no errors occur which cannot be attributed to the exigencies of dramatic presentation. 7 It has been suggested that David and Bethsabe represents an abridged (perhaps provincial) stage version, revised at least in part by Peele himself; see Arthur M. Sampley, "The Text of Peele's David and Bethsabe," PMLA, XLVI (1931), 659-671. 8 See Greg, Two Elizabethan Stage Abridgements (1922), pp. 99-100. 9 See G. I. Duthie, "The Text of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet ," Studies in Bibliography, IV (1951-52), especially 17-18; and Richard Hosley, "The Corrupting Influence of the Bad Quarto on the Received Text of Romeo and Juliet ," SQ , IV (1953), especially 11-12 and 16. 10 Note a comment on the Edward I text by Harold M. Dowling, op. cit ., 184: "The text shows that the play has been ruthlessly revised, serious matter being wholly excised so as to allow for the inclusion of comic and farcical scenes." 11 This list is intended to be illustrative not exhaustive. Accidental dropping and misplacing of lines, suggested by Dyce, Bullen, and other editors, may enter into the explanation of some of these passages, as well as conscious revision. There is a clearly misplaced four-line fragment in David and Bethsabe, at the bottom of G4v, indicating some kind of confusion in the manuscript; and it may be that such misplacements occur in Edward 1. See the above discussion of the passage at 2943-56. 12 Holger Norgaard, in Notes and Queries, CXCVII (October 11, 1952), 443, states his impression that "the play must almost certainly have been the source of the ballad, which in places is barely understandable without reference to the play." My own impression reverses this pattern of influence, but there is no positive evidence either way. 13 Bullen, I, 82. The last word was probably once "Queenhive"; Potters Heath is three times called "Potters Hive" in Edward I, at 2506, 2543, and 2548. 14 Neither of these events is mentioned in the anonymous ballad. The only reference to any child of Queen is in stanza 19 of the ballad, where it is stated that Elinor confessed to having had o-a base-born child" by a friar. In Edward 1, scene 25, the Queen confesses that Jone's father was a French friar. This is one of two specific links between the ballad and portions of Edward I which I believe to be in the main Peele's. The other concerns Elinor's pride in dress, mentioned in stanzas 2-4 of the ballad and in the play in scene 1, at 223-233, and 285-92. Peele may have had a general knowledge of the anonymous ballad when he wrote his play, or he may merely have known the tenor of the current vilifications of Queen Elinor. I do not think, as I am attempting to demonstrate above, that he is responsible for the more extensive use to which the ballad has been put in other scenes of Edward 1. 15 Possibly the occurrence of Rice's name in this stage direction indicates that the actor who portrayed Rice earlier is here doubling as an attendant of King Edward's. The stage direction in such case would be a playhouse addition made by a theatrical reviser and/or bookkeeper. The apparent confusion between stage directions and dialogue reflected in this line has a counterpart in David and Bethsabe at F4v, 17, in the direction, Hence murtherer, hence, he threw at him." Presumably the first half of this line belongs to the text-proper, not to the stage direction. The curious use of past tense for stage directions occurs both in David and, more rarely, in The Arraignment, but not in Edward 1. 16 The reference in scene 7 of Edward I at 1293-4, to "the booke of Robin Hood" (i.e., the prompt book), suggests that there was in existence a Robin Hood play earlier than Anthony Munday's Death of Robert Earl of Huntington, printed in 1601, and longer than the play which occupies the last eight pages of "A mery geste of Robyn Hoode and on hys Iyfe, wyth a newe playe for to be played in Maye games . . . ," first printed in an undated quarto ca. 1561-69. 17 See MSR, vi. In Henslowe's Diary, 11 (1908), 148, Greg defines "ne" thus: "The occurrence of the letters against a performance may therefore indicate one of three things: (i) that the play was new to the stage and had never before been acted; (ii) that it was new to the company, but had been previously represented by some other body; (iii) that it was new in its particular form, having received alterations since it was last acted." 18 Greg, in Henslowe's Diary, II, 176, has suggested Strange's instead of Queen's as the original owner of Edward l: "The present play belonged to Alleyn and may very likely, therefore, have come from Strange's men [Fleay's suggestion], being marked as new on account of revision. The edition of 1599 appears to be a mere reprint of that of 1593, so that any additions made in 1595 have perished. The printed text is mutilated, and may have been cut down for country performance during the plague of 1592-3."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Two Compositors in the First Quarto of Peele's Edward I by Frank S. Hook</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NEARLY a quarter of a century ago it was noted that a study of variant spellings in the First Folio Macbeth suggested the possibility that two compositors had set type for the play. 1 Later investigation supported the hypothesis and revealed the work of these same men in other plays of the Folio. 2 More exacting principles for a spelling test to detect compositors have since been laid down. 3 The test has been applied to other plays, 4 and in at least one instance the results have been verified by still another technique. 5 Although its accuracy seems validated by these studies, the test has thus far been employed in comparatively few cases. Therefore, it seems desirable to extend its use both to substantiate conclusions previously drawn and to add to our knowledge of early printing house procedure. Application of the spelling test to the 1593 quarto of Peele's Edward 1, printed by Abel Jeffes for William Barley, reveals the work of two compositors. However, they did not divide their material alternately throughout the play as seems to have been the case in other quartos studied. Compositor A set from the beginning at least through D, and Compositor B set at least from E4 to the end of the play. Although it seems likely that they are to be attributed to Compositor B, the remaining pages (E1-E3 v ) present some difficulties which will be discussed later. The evidence upon which these conclusions are based is given in the table below. Most remarkable is the fact that through D, the word friar appears 60 times, and only once is it spelled frier. From E4 to the end of the play, the word appears 121 times, and 118 times it is spelled frier. The remarkable consistency of these variant forms indicates clearly the two-compositor pattern, but since the word does not appear on every page, it is necessary to seek out supplementary evidence. Such evidence is ample. Compositor A wavers inconclusively between go and goe (7: 6), but his fellow shows a decided preference for goe (23 times), using, in his undisputed work, go only once, and that in a full line. 6 Much the same holds true for do . 7 While Compositor A uses doe only twice to fifteen instances of do, Compositor B has do only four times (all in full lines) in 33 appearances of the word. This suggests that wherever either go or do appears outside a full line the work should be attributed to Compositor A. However, this facile rule will not apply, since on E2 v and E3 go occurs four times, only once in a full line, and other evidence indicates that the work is Compositor B's. In speech ascriptions Compositor A tries several forms before he settles on Long. (for Longshankes), but he also uses Longsh. ten times. Compositor B much prefers Longsh., but three times he also uses Long. Compositor A generally shortens Lluellen to Lluel. (three times to Llu.), but four times he tell, the full name. Compositor B consistently uses the complete name, abbreviating once in a full line to Llue., a form never used by Compositor A. In speech ascriptions and in the text Compositor A uses Glocester (abbreviating Glocest. and Gloce.) in his work Gloster occurs twice, no doubt through the influence of copy. Compositor B uses Gloster (abbreviating occasionally to Glost.) exclusively. In two categories of words the practises of the two compositors diverge. For words like well, Compositor A ordinarily has the normal spelling with some -I variants; Compositor B uses the -I variant far more frequently than does his fellow. 8 For words like say Compositor A again likes the normal spelling, but he also employs an -aie variant. Compositor B prefers the -aie variant. 9 While, as the main table will show, this evidence is not trustworthy for any individual page, the following tabulation indicates its significance for the mass of work. -ll -l -ay -aie A 180 (91.4%) 17 ( 8.6%) 58 (78.4%) 16 (21.6%) B 187 (61.3%) 118 (38.7%) 47 (32.9%) 96 (67.1%) Even though the variants in these two groups represent a long and a short form, it is unlikely that line length exerted much influence over the choice of spelling. In the first place, Compositor B most often uses the long -aie form, but he also uses the short -l form with greater frequency than does Compositor A. Furthermore, investigation of some pages of high concentration of a particular form demonstrates that line length had little to do with spelling. For example, F2, a page of doggerel with short lines, has a high number of the long -aie forms, coupled with heavy use of short -l forms, the characteristics of Compositor B. B3v has Compositor A's highest concentration of the shorter -ay form, but on that page occur only two full lines, neither of which has an -ay spelling in it. B4, a page of prose, uses the long -ll and short -ay forms exclusively, the characteristics of Compositor A. It seems obvious that habit, not line length, dictated the spellings to be used. Thus far, there seems little doubt about the evidence, but the problem of E1-E3v is more complex. The friar/frier spellings are ambiguous; on E3v, the only questionable page on which the word appears, friar occurs twice, and frier five times. Go occurs four times on E2v and E3, suggesting strongly that those pages were set by A, but contradictory evidence appears in the three doe forms (E1v, E2v, E3), which provide as distinct a vote for Compositor B as the go forms do against him. Long., a rare form for B, appears three times on E2v, seven times on E3; but on one of those pages (E2v) Longsh., a B form, occurs four times, more often than on any single page of A's undisputed work, although A does have this spelling more frequently than B has Long. On E3v Lluellen, a B form (which A occasionally employs) occurs three times. Gloster spellings, a very strong evidence of B, occur eleven times on E1v-E3 (seven on E2). Compositor B's -l variant is used twenty times to 32 -ll spellings in those pages. His -aie variants appear on only two pages, and not in significant number. Excluding the -ll/-l and -ay/-aye categories, in which there is the most frequent mixture of A and B forms, the spellings may be tabulated thus: EI EI v E2 E2 v E3 E3 v Total (EI v -E3 v ) A 5 6 8 2 16 B 3 7 6 2 1O 28 E1 seems certainly to be Compositor A's work, since it has only A spellings, including one instance of Glocester and two of Lluel., spellings never used by B. For E1 v -E3 v Compositor B appears to have a slight advantage. The only real difficulty in assigning these pages to Compositor B is the extremely high number (10) of Long. abbreviations on E2 v and E3. Furthermore, the high number of Gloster forms would be just as surprising for Compositor A. Therefore, it seems best to make the line of demarcation between E1 and E1 v . This division is borne out in part by two additional spelling variants which have not been included in the tables. Compositor A consistently spells eye(s), and Compositor B spells eie(s). 10 Eie and eies appear on E2. Compositor A keeps to neere, and Compositor B has neare. 11 Neare occurs on E2. This seems definite proof that E2 is to be assigned to Compositor B; therefore, presumably E2 v -E3 v are also his, since it is unlikely that compositors would divide their work by single pages. On E1 v is the ambiguous form nere, evidently influenced by a rhyme with here, but E1 v also has two Gloster spellings, more than any single page of Compositor A's undisputed work. Departures from characteristic habits on these pages, as well as elsewhere, are doubtless to be explained in part by the influence of copy. Apparently the copy had friar, from which Compositor A once inadvertently departed, and which Compositor B followed on five occasions in spite of his habit of spelling frier. The copy probably read Gloster throughout, which led to Compositor A's twice using that form although he was normally a Glocester speller. There is no assurance that the copy was any more regular than the printed text in abbreviating the speech ascriptions for Lluellen and Longshankes, but assuming that it generally had the full names seems the likeliest explanation for the compositorial divergences. Compositor B would, then, have followed his copy for Lluellen; Compositor A normally departed from it, but on four occasions was led to use the full name. So it is also with Compositor A's treatment of Longshankes, which he occasionally has in full and which is abbreviated Lon., Long., and Longsh.; his fellow was more consistent. Go and do in the copy might explain the departures from his normal spelling in B's work, but assuming that the copy had a norm in these words seems risky. Similarly, in the -ll and -ay groups the copy no doubt showed much the same variety as the printed text, and it would be futile to attempt to ascertain any particular spot in which copy influenced the compositor. Generally, it appears, Compositor B was the steadier speller. The difficulty in assigning E1 v -E3 v points up an important lesson to be drawn from a study of compositorial habits: one must not be overscrupulous in demanding consistency from his compositors. Obviously, whichever compositor set up those pages departed from his normal procedure. As a further illustration of this point, from about I3 v through the end of the play the use of the -I variant drops noticeably. However, on I3 v , I4, K2 v -L1, and L2 appears the trier variant, which is the hallmark of Compositor B. Throughout most of this section one also finds Compositor B's -aie forms. Inconsistencies occur on individual pages throughout. HI is surely the work of Compositor B, but he uses the -l variant only once in eleven possibilities. Conversely, Compositor A quite suddenly uses the -l form five times out of eleven on A4 v . Examples can be multiplied to demonstrate that for no apparent reason a compositor may within a given page show characteristics more like those of his fellow than his own. Whatever conclusion one may reach about E1 v -E3 v , the major proposition seems proved beyond any doubt: two compositors did work on the play, dividing it not quite evenly. There is no evidence to suggest that they worked simultaneously. In fact, since two sets of running titles can be traced throughout the book, composition and printing evidently proceeded seriatim . 12</field>

I am indebted to Miss Alice Walker for calling these spellings to my attention. 12 One set appears in outer AB, inner and outer C, inner D, and outer E-L; the other in inner AB, outer D, and inner E-L. Some readers may be interested in what is evidently one of the comparatively rare appearances of a "bite." When the printer cut out the hole in the paper or parchment for the frisket, he sometimes failed to get it quite accurate, or perhaps it later moved slightly out of register. In either case, the intervention of the frisket between type and paper prevented the printing of one or more letters, resulting in a "bite" (see R. B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography p. 47). At the top of C4 in the 1599 quarto of Edward I, the Huntington and British Museum (162.d.51) copies have the speech ascription Maris; other copies examined have aris with what appears to be the very tip of the upper right corner of the M barely visible.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of a Valerius Maximus Dated 1671 by Curt F. Bühler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ABOUT the middle of the last century, a bibliophilic "find" was made in Holland in the course of liquidating the stock of a bookseller's warehouse; 1 here were discovered a considerable number of copies, still in the original sheets as issued from the press, of a Valerius Maximus "Amstelodami, Typis Danielis Elzevirii, Sumptibus Societatis" with the date 1671. Two editions with this same information and date are known which agree with each other page-for-page and mostly line-for-line; it is certain, however, that the edition with signature *2 recto printed in roman type and lacking a headpiece 2 on that page was not printed by the Elzevir press. As Gustaf Berghman has shown, 3 this edition--to which the unbound sheets belong--was very probably printed at Amsterdam by Johann Blaeu. Apparently here, as in a number of other instances, a group of booksellers banded together to undertake a joint venture; though all the copies of the several editions bore the Elzevir imprint, it seems clear that now one member of the association, now another, would reprint the texts as further printings were required. Consequently any book printed "Sumptibus Societatis" may or may not have been put out by the Elzevir press. In any event, it is apparent that those copies not actually printed by Daniel Elzevir do not constitute "forgeries" nor do they belong to "counterfeit editions" in the usual sense, since Blaeu could hardly have continued this practice without the Elzevirs becoming aware of it, and the relations between the two firms remained cordial to the very last. However, as Berghman has sadly remarked: 4 La particularité piquante que nous apprend M. Willems au sujet des nombreux exemplaires brochés de cette édition, a dû singulièrement diminuer la satisfaction de leurs heureux possesseurs. La preuve que nous venons de donner de la provenance non elzevirienne de ce volume, la détruira sans doute complètement. Nous en sommes peiné, mais la vérité avant tout. While the value of these books may well be relatively slight from a commercial point of view, it is quite considerable for the evidence which they afford in regard to the method of printing employed in their production. Indeed, they offer concrete proof for a printing practice which Ronald B. McKerrow discussed but did not illustrate. 5 He further stated (p. 168) that "it is undoubtedly possible for a book to be printed as a 12mo (i. e. for the leaf to be one-twelfth of a sheet) and yet to be sewn in 8'S, though I cannot give an instance of such a thing." 6 Here, then, is an example of such practice, though in this particular case it is just double that which McKerrow had envisaged. The Pierpont Morgan Library (no. 21246) possesses one of the numerous extant copies of this Valerius Maximus in its original state, the sheets still uncut but sewn together. The very unusual and awkward appearance of the book is due to the fact that three sorts of gatherings with varying measurements are bound together. The collation, 7 as conceived by the printer, may well have been: * 4 A-V 8 X 4 , though quire * was not necessarily always bound first. 8 The types of gatherings are these: Group 1--quires: A C F I M P S Measurements: 9 folio 1 measures 3 3/8 X 5 inches " 4 " 3 3/8 X 4 3/4 inches folios 2, 7, and 8 measure 2 1/2 x 5 inches " 3, 5, " 6 " 2 1/2 X 4 3/4 inches Group 2-quires: B D G K N Q T Measurements: folio 2 measures 3 3/8 X 5 inches " 3 " 3 3/8 X 4 3/4 inches folios 1, 7, and 8 measure 2 1/2 x 5 inches " 4, 5, " 6 " 2 1/2 X 4 3/4 inches Group 3-quires: [*/X] 10 E H L O R V Measurements: folios 1 and 2 measure 3 3/8 X 5 inches " 3 " 4 " 3 3/8 X 4 3/4 inches " 5 " 6 " 2 1/2 X 4 3/4 inches " 7 " 8 " 2 1/2 X 5 inches The watermarks occur either in the upper margins (groups 1 and 2) or in the outer ones (group 3); the chain-lines are horizontal. The only possible way that these sheets could have been printed is set forth in the accompanying figure. 11 The sheet would have to be cut-and indeed was cut-along the dotted lines. The small circles marked on the dotted line of the central fold indicate the pinholes. As usual these occur at different distances from the edges of the paper so as to insure perfect register when the sheets were perfected; 12 the holes are found approximately 1 1/4 inches from one edge of the paper and 2 1/4 from the other. The broken lines in the form of a rectangle and of a diamond indicate the approximate alternative positions of the watermark. The signature marks set down are those of the printed pages, not of the formes as they were imposed; those in square brackets indicate the pages on the verso as printed and turned face up. After the sheet had been perfected and cut as indicated, two of the resulting four parts could be folded as ordinary octavos, though with the chain-lines running horizontally. The remaining two parts had the appearance of quartos, with the chain-lines (as usual) horizontal; the watermarks, however, would be found in the outer margins instead of in the inner ones and might often be cut off in the trimming. These two sections were folded together (i. e., one sheet within the other) 13 to make a gathering of eight leaves. These facts would probably not be easy to determine once the sheets had been trimmed down to make the completed book, bound and ready for sale. The original sheet of paper must have measured approximately 16 3/4 X 19 1/2 inches, a size which does not appear in McKerrow's standard work. 14 Clearly it was not anticipated that the finished book would measure more than 4 3/4 x 2 1/2 inches, so that a sheet slightly larger than 15 X 19 inches (approximately that of the modern "crown" sheet) would have sufficed for the printing. This would give an overall measurement of 285 square inches as against more than 326 such inches actually used. Accordingly about an eighth of the paper fell away as wastage before the knife of the trimmer. That Blaeu could afford so great a loss in his stock of paper (about 12 1/2 per cent.) would seem to indicate that paper was relatively cheap in Holland in those days. The uncut sheets of this Valerius Maximus have thus given us some insight into the workings of a late seventeenth-century press. When we are enabled to deduce the method of imposition and printing, that of the cutting and the folding of the paper, the exact location of the pinholes relative to the edges, the size of the original sheet and the amount of trimming it was expected to suffer- and possibly other details which may have escaped my notice-then one can hardly refer to these sheets as being wholly without value.</field>

These copies do not appear to have been known to Charles Pieters, Annales de l'imprimerie Elsevirienne, Gand, 1851, p. 235, but apparently came to light shortly after that date. 2 See Gustaf Berghman, Catalogue raisonné des impressions Elzeviriennes de la Bibliothèque Royale de Stockholm, Stockholm, 1911, p. 314, no. 2162. The copy of the 1671 edition actually printed by Daniel Elzevir (Berghman 2161) found in the New York Public Library also has leaf K3 mis-signed C3; the corresponding leaf in the Blaeu edition is correctly signed. 3 Nouvelles études sur la bibliographie Elzevirienne, Stockholm, 1897, p. 109, no. 388- see also Edouard Rahir, Catalogue d'une collection unique de volumes imprimés par les Elzevier, Paris, 1896, p. 397, no. 3336. 4 Etudes sur la bibliographie Elzevirienne, Stockholm, 1885, p. 50. 5 An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students, Oxford, 1928, p. 173 and (especially) Appendix Five. 6 McKerrow adds that the printer "could easily do this by cutting off one- third of each sheet and using the remainder exactly as a normal sheet for his octavo formes, making up every third gathering out of the two cut-off pieces placed one inside the other." Though our "Elzevir" is a 24mo in form and manner of printing, the method of cutting and folding is just this. Oddly, Pieters (loc. cit) refers to our book as a I6mo, as does Jean Graesse, Trésor de livres rares et précieux, Dresden, 1859-69, VI 2 : 245. 7 According to Willems, the 1671 Valerius Maximus is a page-for-page reprint of the 1650 Elzevir printing so that the compositor was well aware of what each page would contain; thus his task for this somewhat complicated imposition was considerably simplified. 8 Gathering * comprises the title-page two biographies of Valerius Maximus, and the table of contents; the leaves are unnumbered. In the NYPL copy this quire is bound at the beginning, in the Morgan copy (of the reprint) the title is, of course, bound as the first leaf but the other three leaves have been inserted at the end. It is naturally impossible to determine what Blaeu had in mind for the unbound sheets. 9 Because of the rough (untrimmed and consequently uneven) edges of the paper, the measurements are necessarily approximate but are sufficiently accurate for our purposes. 10 These two quires were doubtless printed as gathering H in our figure but were not folded together as the other gatherings in this group. 11 Despite the great variety of his illustrations, John Johnson ( Typographia or the Printers' Instructor, London, 1824, vol. II, chap. vii) gives no lay-out for "A Sheet of Twenty-fours, with Three Signatures" though he gives a number for the same "with Two Signatures." 12 For a discussion of this practice and for the literature on this subject, see Paul S. Dunkin, "The Ghost of the Turned Sheet," PBSA, XLV (1951), 246-250. 13 Except in one instance, for which see note 10 above. 14 Introduction, Part 1, Chapter 8.

      <field name="heading_text">The Precedence of the 1676 Editions of Milton's Literæ Pseudo-Senatûs Anglicani by Bruce Harkness</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN MILTON'S posthumous work the Letters of State exists in two separate editions, both printed in 1676. For purposes of reference, the two editions may be easily distinguished by the labels Face and Fruit: the device on the title page of one bears an open-mouthed face in its center; that of the other depicts some fruit. Since one edition is a page-for- page reprint of the other (except for the Preface of a page and a half), the question naturally raised is, which is the first edition ? It is generally assumed that the Face edition is a reprint of the Fruit. But that assumption has not as yet been proved. 1 My purpose here is to bring forth the bibliographical evidence which demonstrates that the Face edition does in fact reprint the Fruit. Short bibliographical descriptions of the two editions are as follows: (A) Title page: LITERÆ | PJeudoScnatSs Anglicani, | CROMWELLII, | Reliquorumque Perduellium | nomine ac juIIu con- | Icriptæ | A | JOANNE MILTONO. | [ device: fruit, 33 x 46 mm.] | ImpreIIæ Anno x676.

Copies examined: University of Illinois Library's copies 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16, and three uncatalogued. There are three arguments that the Face edition is the reprint. Perhaps none is in itself conclusive, but the cumulative effect of the three amounts to bibliographical proof. The crucial evidence is found in (I) the printing of the preliminaries and of signature K in the Face edition, (2) the catchwords noted above, and (3) the manner of justifying certain lines in both editions. Since one edition reprints the other, proof that the Fruit edition is not likely a reprint is naturally proof that the Face edition is the reprint. It will be noted in the bibliographical description above that for the Fruit edition, gathering K was machined in full, though six pages were left blank. Furthermore, the preliminaries of four pages in length were printed separately. This manner of printing could have occurred quite naturally if the printer did not know what his preliminary matter was when he came to gathering K. Rather than keep K standing until he found out, he might have preferred to machine K with blank leaves, even though it wasted paper. Afterwards he was to see that the preliminary matter could have been machined with gathering K. In a first edition such a procedure is common enough. This method, however, with its consequent wastage of paper, is difficult to imagine in a reprint. It is likely, therefore that the Fruit edition is the first. When one turns to the Face edition, one sees that the preliminaries were printed with gathering K, quite in a manner of a reprint. The preliminaries, that is, were printed on half of the cut-off in 12mo. The method of printing can be inferred quite clearly from the divided watermarks of gathering K. In twelve copies of the Face edition which I have examined at the University of Illinois Library, the watermarks are found divided between the top outer margin of K9 and K10 (when the latter is still in the bound volume); in four copies, the watermarks are found divided between K5 and the second leaf of the volume ( * 2). That the half-watermark of K gathering is completed on * 2 is proof that the first two leaves of the volume were printed with K. Having decided to set the preliminaries with his last gathering, the printer would naturally have them put on what would become an inner fold of his 12 sheet, because this method is the most economical of paper. One position of the watermark in 12 o is on folios 11 and 12 of any gathering. In gathering K of the Face edition, because two leaves are taken from the middle folding of four to make the preliminaries, the watermarks should appear on folios 9, not 11; and 10, not 12. This in fact occurs in several Illinois copies. The alternate position of the watermark in 12 should be in folios 7 and 8 of any gathering. But 7 and 8 are part of the cut-off; and hence in copies 8, 13, and 16, the watermark is found divided between K5 and the second leaf of the volume, which contains the printer's Preface to the reader. The appearance of the watermark on * 2 and K5 proves, furthermore, that the preliminaries were printed on one half of the cut-off, rather than in its center. The cut-off was then cut in half before folding. If this were not so, the watermark would be divided either between the title page and K5 or between * 2 and K6. Because of the position of the watermark it is clear that the introductory matter and the title page were printed with gathering K in the Face edition. One cannot imagine a reprinter doing otherwise. It is strongly suggested, therefore, that the Face edition is the reprint. 2 My second argument for the priority of the Fruit edition involves the catchwords noted above in the bibliographical descriptions. The ten errors in correspondence between catchword and following word in the Fruit edition are mainly errors in accidentals. Despite the fact that it is dangerous to argue from accidentals, I would like to point out that only one of these errors exists in the Face edition. Furthermore, in all but one case, the words correspond by virtue of a change in the catchword, rather than the following word. It should also be noted in the case of B8 v -B9, Ex- [AD], where the error stands in both editions, that the printer has gone to the second line of the formal heading of a letter for his catchword. Perhaps this example could be called a "partial" error. In the instance of G6-G6 v the "correction" was made in the following word, which is made better Latin. Indeed, the text is most often better in the Face edition. Now while it is true that simple multiplicity of error in setting up a book does not necessarily tell us much about the succession of editions, errors involving definite printing practice are important. In four cases of lack of agreement, it should be observed, the error involves a catchword on the verso of a leaf. If Fruit were a reprint, that is, there would be four instances of error when the compositor had open before him a book in which he could see both the catchword and its following word without even turning over a page. And what is more, to hold that Fruit could be a reprint, one would have to suppose that in eight of the ten instances of error, the mistake would be made in the catchword itself, rather than in the following word-a coincidence in which it is hard to believe. It is conceivable that the original printer could make all these errors in correspondence, but it is highly improbable that a printer making a page-by-page reprint would. Face, then, is more than likely a reprint of Fruit. My last bit of evidence concerns the justification of certain lines in both editions. Ordinarily, one edition follows the other line for line. It is the departure from this practice which is bibliographically interesting. An example of one of these departures from line-by-line reprinting is found toward the middle of D1 (p. 73). In both editions the width of line is reduced to permit brackets and numerals on the right side of the page. In the Fruit edition, the reader will find the following passage, which completes a paragraph: quidem perficere &amp; conati ſu- mus &amp; in manu noſtra ſitum e- rat, niſi eos Belgæ iniquiſſimè de- fendiſſent, quæ pecunia amiſſa ad impenſas faciendas jamdu- dum in Europa triplum peper- iſſet: quod Nos æſtimamus In the Face copies this passage reads: quidem perficere &amp; conati ſumus &amp; in manu noſtra ſitum erat, niſi eos Belgæ iniquiſſè defen- diſſent, quæ pecunia amiſa ad im- penſas faciendas jamdudum in Europa triplum peperiſſet: quod Nos æſtimamus As will be noted, the compositor of the Fruit edition permitted bad syllabification, particularly in the second line, e- rat. This slipshod piece of work is bettered in almost every line by the compositor of the Face edition. At any rate, that is my hypothesis-for a reprinter can look ahead to the end of the paragraph and see that he can set up the lines better than his copy. Were the Fruit compositor working from a copy of Face, there would be no excuse for his untidy work -particularly since his inner line is slightly wider and his total line is considerably wider. From these three kinds of evidence, therefore, I would conclude that the Face edition reprints the Fruit, and that, from a bibliographical point of view, the Fruit edition should consequently be used as an editor's copy-text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See, for example, the Columbia editors and Professor Harris Fletcher, both of whom leave the matter an open question: (1) Thomas Ollive Mabbott and J. Milton French (eds.), The State Papers of John Milton, The works of John Milton, XIII (New York: Columbia university Press 1937), 596. (Reprints the Face edition.) (2) Professor Fletcher's notes to the recent University of Illinois Library's exhibition of its Collection of First Editions of Milton's works, items 54 and 55. 2 The error of signing K4 as K3 and K6 as K5 might have come about in one of two ways. In the method outlined above, the "usual" folio 8 becomes bound as K5, while the usual folio 5 becomes bound as K6. Hence it could happen that K6 was signed according to its customary position in the forme. since the missigning of K4 is not accounted for by this explanation, the more likely argument is that the compositor confused his formes. He signed K4 and K6 (inner forme) as if they were K3 and K5, which have the same relative positions in the outer forme. One copy (#3) is signed correctly-probably a stop-press correction in an effort to prevent faulty binding. (One copy examined (#10) is in fact misbound from this missigning).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Missing Term Catalogue by Cyprian Blagden</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN Volume II of his reprint Professor Arber has a leaf (pp. 565/6) with only this note on it: Here should come in, if it were ever published, The Term Catalogue for Michaelmas Term, 1695.... A long-continued search .... has quite failed to prove either the publication, or the non-publication, of this particular Number: and there the matter must be left for the present." That was nearly 50 years ago; so far as I know the search is still on. Common sense, while vigorously asserting that some books must have appeared between June and November 1695, can easily invent reasons why no Catalogue was published for that period; in fact, there was no Catalogue for Hilary 1689 because, during the uncertainty of the 'Glorious Revolution,' no Hilary Term was kept. The Catalogue for Easter 1689 contained "the books printed since Michaelmas Term before," and is, in consequence, about twice the normal length. But the Catalogue for Hilary 1696 (the next after the missing one) is shorter than the average and has the usual title. If, therefore, it can be proved that books appeared normally during the summer and autumn of 1695, it is a reasonable assumption that there was a Catalogue which listed them. Two notes by John Locke make the assumption almost a certainty. In a pocket book 1 in which he kept a careful record of all books and pamphlets received there is this entry for Tuesday 18 February, 1695/6: "Recd of A[wnsham] C[hurchill] term cats for Trinity and Mich." These are unlikely to be for any other year than 1695, particularly when he recorded on Wednesday 17 March 1696/7 the receipt of "The catalogues of the books printed the 4 Termes of the last year &amp; Hilary terme of this". Though Robert Clavell, who is generally thought to be the compiler of the Term Catalogues, cannot produce comparable evidence for the existence of the Michaelmas Catalogue, he can prove to us that books did appear in the relevant period and he tells us, in a roundabout way, which they were. It would still be pleasant to find a copy of the missing Catalogue, partly because it would give us a little more information and partly because it would prove the validity of my theory. But at least it is possible to reconstruct a list of titles which would have been included in the Catalogue for Michaelmas 1695. At the end of Number 12 of the second series of the Term Catalogues , 2 Clavell advertised "The General Catalogue of all the Books Printed in England since the Dreadful Fire of London 1666. to the end of Hilary Term, 1673." This series ran to Trinity 1674 (no. 18), and early in 1675 Clavell produced the second edition of The General Catalogue, which he entered in the Registers of the Stationers' Company on 10 February. The third series ran for 24 issues and ended with that for Trinity 1680; late in the same year appeared the third edition of The General Catalogue. The fourth series ran for longer than the others, and the Catalogue for Trinity 1695--the last of this series to survive-is numbered 58 (misprinted 57); but the expected General Catalogue, of which the title page is dated 1X6, includes in its main body no books listed after those in the Hilary Catalogue. The gap is filled by 2 1/2 pages of "Books Published in Easter, Trinity and Michaelmas Terms, 1695." These pages are numbered 125 to 127, form, with the blank page 128, signature Kk and are linked to the previous signature Ii by the proper catchword 'Books'. What determined Clavell to round off his fourth series in 1695 rather than one or more years earlier, I do not know; but it is worth noting, in view of his interest in publishing the prices of books, 3 that in 1695 there occurred one of the periodic agreements between booksellers and bookbinders about the prices of binding. 4 What caused him nine months' delay in carrying out his determination is equally obscure, though disputes about the binding agreement and the final lapsing of the Licencing Acts may have had their effect. What is certain is that he minimized the effects of this delay by compiling the Supplement of books published in the Easter, Trinity and Michaelmas Terms of 1695. This Supplement to the 160 Catalogue contains 208 titles arranged under the expected headings-'History', 'Physick', 'Musick', 'Poems', 'Miscellanies', 'Law' and 'Divinity' (though the word 'Divinity' is omitted). There are no sections for 'Lib. Lat.' and 'Reprinted', just as there are no sections for them in the main body of the Catalogue; and there are no 'Advertisements'. From the 'History' section it is easy to see how Clavell worked. 5 The first two titles are the only two History books in the Easter Term Catalogue; the next four are the first four in Trinity (the fifth in Trinity, Comber's The Church History Clear'd from the Roman Forgeries, appears in the Supplement under 'Divinity'). The next four in the Supplement are reprints, three from Easter and one from Trinity. The last nine are, by deduction, those published in Michaelmas. Of these, six are not mentioned elsewhere in the Catalogues; Pufendorf's introduction to History and Romae Antiquae Notitia appear as second editions in later Catalogues, and Brown's Lives of the Princes of Orange as a new book in Easter 1694. This pattern-Easter new books, Trinity new books, Easter reprints, Trinity reprints, balance for Michaelmas (new and reprints undifferentiated)-is followed exactly in the sections for 'Poetry', 'Miscellanies' and 'Musick', and with one slight modification in that for 'Physick'. In the 'Law' section (the only one to give prices but no booksellers' names), the first five titles are those listed as new in Michaelmas 1693 and the next four those in Hilary, Easter and Michaelmas 1694; there was no section for Law books in Trinity 1694. The next three are from Trinity 1695 and the thirteenth appears as a reprint in Hilary 1695; the sole new title for Hilary 1695 appears also in Hilary 1694 and the sole Easter 1695 title appears also in Michaelmas 1693, though with a different imprint. The remaining two titles in the Supplement were presumably published in the Michaelmas Term 1695. In the 'Divinity' section, much the largest with 108 titles, the first 67 are taken straight from the Trinity and Easter Catalogues (in that order); of the remaining 41, four appear somewhere in the Easter or Trinity Catalogues (one, as already mentioned, under 'History') and the rest must be presumed Michaelmas titles. But this section is untidy in every way; whereas from the other sections of new books in the Easter and Trinity Catalogues all the titles are included in the Supplement except Emblems for the King and Queen and Vassor's Letters written by a French Gentleman (both from 'Miscellanies'), the 'Divinity' section omits a number of books which, according to the rule. it should contain. Before giving the list of 71 titles which I deduce were first published or reprinted between June and November 1695 and which I am fairly sure were printed in a Catalogue for Michaelmas, I want to draw attention to three points: 1) The titles are normally shorter even than the short form used in the main body of The General Catalogue; but Clavell makes no differentiation between his setting of those titles which we know appeared in the Term Catalogue for Easter and those which I think appeared in that for Michaelmas. 2) Booksellers' names are always given, except in the 'Law' section; but there are no addresses and occasionally Clavell leaves out one or two names or lumps them together under 'and others'. 3) In his Preface to the 1600 Catalogue Clavell explains that he has omitted the prices of books because various factors "render the Prizes of most Books uncertain"; by 1695 he has decided to put in the prices of Law books and (because these prices are the same in all shops?) to leave out booksellers' names.

      <field name="heading_text">The Circulation of Some London Newspapers, 1806-1811: Two Documents by Robert L. Haig</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN THE absence of Stamp Office accounts for the early nineteenth century, historians of the press are compelled to rely upon scattered and fragmentary evidence as to the circulation of London newspapers during the period of the Napoleonic wars. 1 Professor Arthur Aspinall's studies of the problem 2 have thrown light upon the methods of circulation, the size of the newspaper-reading public, and the extent of influence exerted by the newspaper press during the period, but reliable contemporary estimates of the circulation of individual newspapers are unfortunately rare. 3 A few such estimates, hitherto unnoticed, occur in memoranda among the papers of the Treasury Solicitor preserved in the Public Record Office. 4 They relate to the years 1806-1808 and 1811, and are based on figures supplied by the Stamp Office from records no longer extant. During the period from 1808 to 1811 libel actions against the London newspapers were instituted by the government in unprecedented numbers-more than forty in three years. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the Law Officers of the Crown were taking an interest in newspaper circulation. That interest was responsible for the compilation of the memoranda here described.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I In June, 1808, Henry White and John Herriott Hart, proprietor and printer respectively of The Independent Whig (a Sunday paper distinguished for its criticism of Tory policies), 5 were twice brought to trial for libels. 6 Both prosecutions were based upon ex-officio informations filed by the Attorney General, and the first group of circulation figures to be considered was apparently compiled in preparation for the trials. It consists of reports on the quantities of stamps issued by the Stamp Office to the printer of the Independent Whig. The period covered extends from the first issue of the paper on January 5, 1806, to the middle of January, 1808. The earliest memorandum in the group records that "the Circulation [of the Independent Whig ] commenced with printing 1188-Stamps issued 1500[.] During the first Thirty weeks gradually increased to 2439-Stamps 2500." The circulation figures, as here distinguished from the number of stamps issued, seem to indicate that the compiler received information from someone close to the paper itself, but such a distinction is not carried consistently through the reports. The second note is headed "1806 Number of Stamps paid for by Mr Hart Printer of the Whig Newspaper" and records issues of stamps at irregular intervals from January 4 to November 20, 1806. The total number issued was 109,100, an average of 2,424 stamps for each number of the paper during the forty-five week period. A similar list of stamps purchased by Hart between January 8 and July 29, 1807, totals 83,950, for a weekly average of 2,894. There is no report of purchases at the Stamp Office for the Independent Whig between July, 1807, and an unspecified date in the following year, but a noted signed "L. Booth Reg r (i.e., "Register") explains the absence of such figures for the period: "Mr Hart does not appear to have paid for any Stamps since July 29-1807-therefore must have been served by some Stationers." Booth's surmise is borne out by another memorandum headed "Independent Whig-bought of Mess rs Magnay and Pickering-Newspaper Stamps." Magnay and Pickering were stationers in Queen Street, Cheapside. A list of four purchases from them reveals that the Independent Whig used 80,500 stamps between September 10, 1807, and January 14, 1808. In the manuscript, this figure has been divided by twenty-four (the number of weeks between Hart's last recorded purchase at the Stamp Office and the latest purchase from the stationers), and the quotient, 3,354, is labelled "d week." The approximate circulation of each issue of the paper from January, 1806, to January, 1808, may be tabulated, then, as follows: January to November, 1806 2,400 January to July, 1807 2,800 September, 1807 to January, 1808 3,300 The owner and printer of the Independent Whig were found guilty at both trials in June, 1808, but they appealed to the House of Lords, and the Attorney General remained interested for a time in the circulation of their paper. The final reference to it in this group of documents occurs in a letter of November, 1808, addressed to W. C. Litchfield, the Treasury Solicitor: Sir Having laid your Letter of this day's date before the Commissioners, I am directed to transmit to you the inclosed Account of the Number of Stamps paid for on account of the Independent Whig for half a Year with the Weekly Average thereof, Signed by the proper Officer, for the Information of the Attorney General. I am, Sir, Your most humble Servant F. C. Beresford The enclosure is as follows: Stamp Office November 11, 1808 The Number of Stamps paid on account of the Independent Whig is--109,525-for l/2 a year Weekly Average of which is-4,212- L Booth Register The figure supplied in Booth's memorandum reveals an increase of nearly twenty-six per cent in the average number of stamps purchased weekly between January and November, 1808. The proportionate circulation increase which is indicated was undoubtedly due in part to the notoriety attendant upon the prosecutions themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The second, and more comprehensive, group of Stamp Office figures contains estimates of the average daily circulation of thirteen London papers for the month of January, 1811, together with the total number of stamps sold during the month. These occur in both rough draft and fair copies; in the former it is apparent that the average daily circulation figure in each case has been obtained by dividing the total number of stamps issued for each paper during the month by twenty-seven, the number of publication days in the month. A specimen will most clearly illustrate the method: M g Post 27/87000 ----- 3222 Day about 3000 It should be noted that in every case the nearest round figure below the quotient was taken as the daily average, thereby making some allowance for the margin between the number of stamps purchased and the number of papers actually sold. I reproduce the fair copies. 7 Number of London Newspapers and Amount of Stamps for January 1811 The Number of London Newspapers now Published is 60 Country Newspapers in England . . . . . . . . . . . . 112 Country Newspapers Irish . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 Country Newspapers Scotch . . . . . . . . . . . . 27 The Number of Stamps paid for at the Stamp Office for Newspapers in the Month of January 1811 was as follows By the London Printers 1,268,750 By Stationers part used by London Printers &amp; part in the Country 768,669 Total 2,037,419 Circulation of some of the London Newspapers (per Day) Morning Post about 3000 Morning Chronicle (more during Sitting of Parliam t than at any other time) about 3500 Courier about 5800 Times &amp; Mail 3 Times in the week about 5000 8 Press &amp; Globe (both daily) 3000 8 Morning Herald about 1500 Day about ll00 Statesman about 1500 Traveller London Chronicle &amp; Commercial Chronicle } together about 1500 The thirteen newspapers listed were almost certainly considered to be the leading journals published in London at the time. All were issued daily except the Mail, the London Chronicle, and the Commercial Chronicle, which appeared thrice weekly. The individual circulations of these three, therefore, would probably have been more extensive than is indicated by the figures given, which were computed on a daily basis. Such a computation was made necessary by purchases of stamps in single lots for use by several papers, no indication being given of how many were used by each. Thus, The Times, with six issues per week, and the Mail, with three, drew upon the same stocks of stamped paper, and only a combined daily average afforded a basis for comparing their circulation with that of other newspapers.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Booksellers' "Ring" at Strawberry Hill in 1842 by A. T. Hazen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MANY AN inexperienced collector has observed with alarm what seem to be inexplicable fluctuations in the auction records of certain books: a good copy of a book consistently worth above a hundred dollars is suddenly knocked down for twenty or thirty dollars. He may be told that these fluctuations are part of the normal demand-supply market or that the sale was badly advertised and the copy badly described or that the copy in question was known by the trade to be defective. But since rumors of manipulation are wide-spread, he is likely also to suspect that this copy was knocked down cheaply by some pre- arranged plan. If the collector broods over such phenomena, he is likely to conclude that the auction markets for both books and securities exist chiefly as sheltered hunting areas for wolves and bears. Now it is clear that short of outright dishonesty on the auctioneer's part no manipulation is possible when two or more collectors set out independently in pursuit of a book. Indeed, a constantly recurring phenomenon is the notably high price scored by a book because of intense competition: the Wilmerding Sales in New York in 1951 afforded numerous examples. And Horace Walpole's agent bid £49, at Dr. Mead's Sale in 1754, for a book worth less than £5, not because of any manipulation but because both Walpole and his rival had given instructions to buy the book at any price. When a collector complains about high prices, therefore, he is not charging manipulation in the usual sense; he is in effect confessing that his own enthusiasm led him on to injudicious heights, or, at worst, suggesting that persons unnamed raised his bids only to make him pay more for the book. 1 The booksellers' "Ring," therefore, can operate to keep prices down only in the absence of firm bids from private collectors. The "Ring" can play no part on any lot for which one or more collectors may choose to bid, whether by mailed bids, by commitments through dealers, or by direct action on the floor. This means in practice that the "Ring" can operate only in the distribution of books for stock, especially in the distribution of grouped items on which private collectors are less likely to bid. The method in itself is simple enough: the members of the "Ring" are dealers who would like to add to their stock various desirable groups of books from a particular auction; by agreement among themselves no member of the "Ring" will raise another member's bid; no great harm is done if an outsider bids higher, on a particular lot, than the insiders wish to go for stock; whatever lots fall to members of the "Ring" are then divided among the participating members at a private auction, the "Knock-out" or "Settlement." The effect is that ten books in a lot, worth something like $IO each, can all be purchased for $IO if no outsider wants to go higher for the lot because of a much-wanted item in the lot. The principle on which the "Ring" works is simple enough. The participating booksellers (usually only five or six in London, but all dealers present at a country sale) agree before the sale not to bid against each other on lots wanted for stock. If then there is no serious outside competition, each desired lot falls to one member in the "Ring" at a moderate price. After the sale, the dealers in the "Ring" hold a private auction, called the "Knock-out" or "Settlement," of the lots bought in the public sale. The proceeds of this second sale (i.e., the difference between the total realized and the total paid for these same lots in the public sale) are then divided among themselves. The result is that a lot knocked down to a particular dealer in the public auction will be retained by him only if he wants it for stock more than do any of his associates, so that the announced purchaser at the public auction is very frequently not the final owner of the lot after the settlement. Another convenience is that members of the "Ring" can go high at no great cost to themselves on a few lots near the beginning, to help to frighten away brash outsiders. Mr. John Carter has useful little notes on the "'Ring" in his Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting and in his ABC for Book-Collectors; he records that the practice was made illegal by Act of Parliament in 1927; "opinions vary as to their prevalence at book sales to-day." The law of 1927 applies only to dealers who purchase for resale. Mr. I. A. Williams, in his Elements of Book-Collecting in 1927 wrote: It is hard to resist the conclusion that the "Ring" is not a legitimate form of combination, that it is, indeed, morally in the category of conspiracies to defraud.... The facts are hard to establish, and could they be established, it would possibly prove libellous to print them in any detail; but it is rumored that in the London auction rooms the "Ring" comprises some half-a-dozen firms only. Obviously, therefore, there will be present at every auction of books a large number of dealers, and a few private purchasers, who are outside the "Ring," and who will certainly not allow its members to appropriate books at a ridiculously low figure. Since my interest is wholly historical, I do not think I shall be accused of libel. Neither do I wish to concern myself with morality, or ethics-perhaps the booksellers in the "Ring" are no different ethically from two private collectors who agree in advance not to compete for certain desirable items and who therefore in effect agree to share the spoils. But it seems to me helpful, in examining the history of book auctions, to understand that, despite the operations of both dealers and private collectors who are outside the "'Ring," the plan can be applied effectively by a cohesive group of insiders. No outsider is interfered with when he wants any book more than the insiders want it; the outsider is able to buy and he is not penalized in price. But on any lot for which there is no outside bid, at least not above a nominal price, the "Ring" is completely effective, at a great saving in cost to the members. The loss has to be taken by the auction house and the consignor, but this may be more apparent than real: since the members of the "Ring" are among the leading dealers, and hence those who have sufficient capital to buy largely for stock, the bottom would soon drop out of the whole market if they failed to bid, but by the pooling of their bids they are in fact able to buy more lots for stock. The plan is therefore a decided advantage to the members of the "Ring," but it may be no very great hardship to the consignor. The great Walpolian Sale at Strawberry Hill in 1842, by a fortunate combination of circumstances, affords sufficient evidence to document the working of the "Ring." In this sale, the members of the "Ring" were allowed "to appropriate books at a ridiculously low figure." Walpole's collection of books, coins, paintings, and memorabilia, housed in his little gingerbread castle, was one of the sights of London during his lifetime, and collectors were of course excited by the sale in 1842. Crowds came to see the collections, many grumbled at the inadequacies of the cataloguing, and an unusual number of individuals competed in the bidding from lot to lot. In the collection there was something for everyone, and there can be little doubt that many a collector wanted merely "something" from Strawberry Hill. But others, including Lord Derby, William Beckford, and W. H. Miller, bought heavily. The methods and results outlined above are clearly visible in the records of the sale. Desirable single items or small lots, for which one or more collectors entered bids, fetched suitable if not startling prices. Hawkins's History of Music cost £10.10.0; William Herbert's edition of Ames, £4-more than the same copy was worth in 1890; Pope's Shakespeare, £6.16.6; Morant's Essex, £6.6.0; Dugdale's Warwickshire, £17.17.0; Dart's Westminster, £5.5.0; Walpole's Description of the Villa, £18.10.0. Such books were sold to private collectors, knocked down after competition, and they are not out of line with other prices throughout the sale. But interspersed through the sale, usually when several good books are lumped in a lot, are hundreds of absurdly low prices, to dealers. Here are three characteristic and not unusual examples: three items in one lot (iii.49) sold to Pickering for 14/-, but priced at £4.13.0 when re- offered separately by Thorpe; six items in one lot (v.170) sold to Kerslake for 10/-, but re-offered separately by Thorpe for £3; three items in one lot (v.76) sold to Pickering for £1.2.0, but re-offered separately by Thorpe for £8.15.6. The proof that these low prices were produced by an active "Ring" and not by chance failure of free competition is preserved in certain records of the resale of identifiable lots; among them are the three lots cited above, all offered for resale by Thorpe although knocked down to Kerslake and Pickering at Strawberry Hill. The auctioneer printed a list of purchasers and prices after the sale, and its nearly complete accuracy is attested by a few contemporary notes of purchasers. (Many copies of the Sale Catalogue list the purchasers in MS merely by transcription from the printed list, but a few copies survive with notes made at the sale.) Any particular lot, therefore, is identifiable as sold to a private collector, to a dealer like Bohn or Boone known to be executing many private bids, or to a dealer who is presurnably bidding for stock. At least two dealers who purchased heavily for stock, Thorpe and Strong, published special catalogues soon afterwards of their stock of purchases from Strawberry Hill. It is chiefly from these two catalogues that six members of the "Ring" can be identified: Kerslake, Payne and Foss, Pickering, Rodd, Strong, and Thorpe. 2 Scattered through the records are multiple examples of each of the following types: (I) lots listed as sold to Kerslake but re-offered by Thorpe; (2) lots sold to Payne and Foss but re- offered by Strong; (3) lots sold to Payne and Foss but re-offered by Thorpe; (4) lots sold to Pickering but re-offered by Strong; (5) lots sold to Pickering but re-offered by Thorpe; (6) lots sold to Rodd but re-offered by Strong; (7) lots sold to Rodd but re-offered by Thorpe; (8) lots sold to Strong but re-offered by Thorpe; (9) lots sold to Thorpe but re-offered by Payne and Foss; (10) lots sold to Thorpe but re-offered by Strong; and (11) a single lot sold to Thorpe, one volume of which is now at Farmington with a purchaser's note "October 1842, from Kerslake." There seems no doubt that other types could be added if Kerslake, Pickering, or Rodd Catalogues of 1842 could be traced, or a Payne and Foss Catalogue earlier than 1845. More detail seems scarcely necessary, especially since the detail can be supplied only by an itemized tracing of numerous books from the lots sold at Strawberry Hill through the special catalogues issued by Strong and Thorpe. The detail on which I have depended will appear in the Catalogue of Walpole's Library, now approaching completion. Not every book from every lot can be traced; but if a lot of about five items was sold to Strong whereas Strong's Catalogue contains none of them and Thorpe's contains three or four, it seems certain that Thorpe took over the lot in the "Knock-out" or "'Settlement" after the sale and then omitted from his own Catalogue any items he had sold from his shop during the summer. Since the function of the "Settlement" is in part to allow each participating dealer to select from the total those lots in which he has particular interest, that is, lots containing books he knows to be of interest to his regular customers, one would expect him to sell some books immediately. But the lots are kept together too consistently and completely to allow any explanation other than the planned action of the "Ring"; the results can not be explained as the occasional direct purchase of an item from another dealer who was more alert at the auction. Perhaps the chief interest of this episode, to others than Walpolian specialists, is the reminder that the method was normally in use in London until 1927 and that we are fortunate in a chance to examine its operation in 1842. Whether the auctioneer and consignor knew of its operation in 1842 or in any given sale is not of any special significance: books are to be dispersed to the highest bidder in public auction, and the books immediately wanted by individual collectors are secured in fair competition; but there must always be a large stock of books in the trade not immediately wanted by any individual collector, and the auction room distributes these within the trade for stock more or less according to the capital available to the different dealers. The London custom of bunching five to ten books each in very miscellaneous lots undoubtedly makes the "Ring's" program easier, but it also makes feasible the orderly distribution of such books; and the London market is therefore less vulnerable to the intermediate fluctuations of demand that disturb the New York method of praising each book as a collector's item. 3 In the sale at Strawberry Hill, eight thousand volumes were dispersed in eight sessions, twenty-five hundred of them in the Fifth Day alone, and relatively few were collector's items; clearly, most of these books were destined for stock in the general antiquarian or second-hand trade, where Walpole's bookplate might add a bit to the interest but where eventual absorption by private collectors would be exceedingly slow. The second interest of this episode seems to me its illustration of the danger in any attempt to generalize about prices. Observers watching the sale spoke of the disappointing prices, and a bibliographer studying it will quickly judge that prices were astonishingly low. The temptation is therefore strong to generalize concerning the Corn-Law deflation and the subsidence of the Roxburghe fever. But this impression of low prices is produced by the spectacle of lot after lot of identifiably excellent books selling for only a tenth of their known retail value as the sum of the prices of the separate items. These are the lots in the bidding for which the "Ring" was operating, in the absence of private competition, to absorb the large mass of good but not splendid books into stock. The record of such prices has no real relation to the sum even of the wholesale values of the books in the lots; they are only the conveniently dignified prices (10/-, 14/; 21/-) beyond which no bid was entered by any collector or casual spectator. To study the value of books in 1842, or the 1842 price of Walpole's books, one must exclude all the miscellaneous lots that are listed as bought by any member of the "Ring." The auction prices of the rest will be found to be respectably satisfactory; and sometimes, when lifted by competition between collectors like Miller and Sir Thomas Phillipps, the prices were magnificent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Sometimes a dealer seems to have raised a bid for stock largely to maintain the prestige of the item's established value, but this is not manipulation. 2 One or two others may have participated, but these six are certain. These six were among the leading antiquarian dealers of the day: Thorpe was later to become Britwell Librarian; Payne and Foss built and catalogued the great Grenville Collection; Pickering was the famous publisher of reprints who was also the publisher of Lowndes and publisher toe the British Museum. Henry Stevens tells briefly how this same William Pickering spoiled the plans of a similar "Ring" at Lord Mountnorris's Sale in 1852 ( Recollections of Mr. James Lenox, 1886, pp. 167-170). 3 Perhaps in New York the various dealers, who are a friendly and gossipy group, are more likely to decline to buy extensively for stock at a particular auction because of widespread disapproval of the consignor's standards of condition and collecting methods.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Matthew Arnold and Percy William Bunting: Some New Letters 1884-1887 by Robert Liddell Lowe</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN THE Bunting papers at the University of Chicago Library there are four teen unpublished letters of Matthew Arnold to Percy William Bunting (1836-1911), who was editor of the Contemporary Review from 1882 until his death. Bunting conducted the Review on liberal lines and "encouraged all writers, whether or no of established fame, who could adequately present salient phases of contemporary theology, science, art, literature and politics. He maintained in the 'Review' a moderately advanced religious tone and gave topics of social reform a prominent place in its pages." ( DNB, Second Supplement, January 1901-December 1911, I, 257.) Arnold's letters to Bunting are more important collectively than individually. They are primarily the story of the publication of his article "A Comment on Christmas," which appeared in the Review in April, 1885 (XLVII, 457-472). At the same time they add substantially to our understanding of Arnold as a contributor to the leading journals of his day and to the effect that he wished to make upon his public. In Arnold's published letters there is no mention of Bunting or of the Contemporary Review while Bunting was its editor. In his Note-Books, however, Arnold did enter two quotations from an article entitled "Goethe," by J. R. Seeley, which had appeared in the Contemporary Review in November, 1884, (XLVI, 653-672). (See The Note-Books of Matthew Arnold, ed. H. F. Lowry, K. Young, and W. H. Dunn [1952], pp. 409-410, 523.) For permission to publish the letters, I am indebted to Mr. Arnold Whitridge, Arnold's grandson, and to the University of Chicago Library, especially to Mr. Robert Rosenthal, Curator of Special Collections.</field>

I am not disposed to write more at present about Carlyle than I have said in my discourse on Emerson. 3 I shall probably return to America this time year, 4 and between now and then I am not likely to publish more than two articles. One of them has been long promised to Mr. Knowles; the other I should probably have also given to him, but you shall have it if you like. It will be ready for February, will have for title "A Christmas Meditation," 5 and will follow in general the same line of thought and feeling with which Literature and Dogma and God and the Bible have made the public more or less familiar. Perhaps on this account it may not be well suited to the Contemporary Review; you will tell me if this is so, and I shall perfectly understand it. Your terms are liberal, but I am quite content with £50 for an article of from 15 to 20 pages, which is what M r . Knowles and the editor of Macmillan pay me.

But you shall have the article for your March number;-what is the latest possible day you can give me in February ? If, on reading the article, you think it would be in the least degree an unsuiting or embarrassing apparition in the "Contemporary," you must frankly tell me so and I assure you I shall not be foolish enough to feel at all hurt or offended. A happy New Year to you, and believe me, very truly yours, Percy W m . Bunting Esq. Matthew Arnold.-</field>

      <field name="fulltext">VIII Cobham, Surrey. April 4 th . 1885 . My dear Sir I have just arrived here, and find your kind note and cheque. I doubted about the article suiting you, but its tone and temper make it possible for a public such as we have at present; vicious attacks on the orthodox position do nothing but harm in every direction. 1 I cannot but hope that the line taken by me will prove, in the times upon which we are entering, to be of use; I feel myself really in sympathy with the religious world far more than with its assailants-even with the religious world as it is at present. 2 I am afraid I must stick to my self-denying ordinance as to article-writing. I have already refused a request from America for an article on the revised version. 3 Believe me, my dear Sir, most truly yours Percy wm. Bunting Esq re . Matthew Arnold.-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the article, Arnold asserts that, although a belief in miracles must be lost, one must, at the same time, retain Christian morals. To lose Christian morals is to imperil oneself, and needlessly. What men need most, he maintains, is an understanding of what the essential facts and truths of Christianity really are, not a literal belief in the miraculous or preternatural. The two Christian virtues with which he is most concerned in the essay are pureness and charity. The virgin birth he regards as "the popular homage to a high ideal of pureness," a virtue recognized by such lofty spirits as Plato, Sophocles, and Goethe. The ideal of pureness is the force needed to oppose lubricity, which brings moral confusion. (For a penetrating exposition of Arnold's attitude toward lubricity, see Lionel Trilling, Matthews Arnold [1939], pp. 344-346.) In discussing charity, Arnold insists that both rich and poor must prefer the common good to private possession and personal enjoyment. If they do not, they will be unable to make part of the ideal society of the future. He finds the virtue of charity in the ascendency, especially "in the framing of laws and in the interpretation of them by tribunals," where "regard to property and privilege used to be . . . paramount, and the idea of the common good hardly coinsidered at all.... An acceleration of progress in the spread of ideas of this kind " Arnold says, "a decline of vitality in institutions where the opposite ideas were paramount, marks the close of a period. Jesus announced for his own period such a close; a close necessitated by the emergence of the new, the decay of the old." ( St. Paul and Protestantism [1889], p. 170.) Jesus, Arnold insists, did not announce the end of the world, but rather the end of the age. In looking over the society of his own time, Arnold is inclined to augur that the social organization of the 1880's is not far from such end of the age. Dissolution will be peaceful, he says, if men have virtue enough, and violent if they are vicious. The essay, then, is a plea for an ideal society, one that conforms "to the line of Jesus"; for the attainment of such a future, each member of society must mend himself, must implant within him the two central virtues of Christianity, pureness and charity.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 James Thomas Knowles (1831-1908) edited the Contemporary Review from 1870-1877. When the Review changed hands in 1877, he disagreed on certain matters with the new owners and, as a consequence, resigned his editorship. Immediately he founded the Nineteenth Century, becoming its sole owner and editor. (See DNB, Second Supplement, January 1901-December 1911, II, 408.) Arnold himself had no part in Knowles's controversy, and remained a loyal contributor to his editor-friend of the Nineteenth Century. Indeed, Arnold had never appeared in the Contemporary Review until Knowles became its editor, and with good reason if one considers a letter that he wrote to his mother in 1867: "I am to meet Swinburne at dinner on Monday.... He expresses a great desire to meet me, and I should like to do him some good, but I am afraid he has taken some bent His praise has, as was natural, inclined the religious world to look out in my writings for a crusade against religion, and the Contemporary Review, the Christian World, and other similar periodicals, fix on the speeches of Empedocles and Obermann, and calmly say, dropping all mention of the real speakers, 'Mr. Arnold here professes his Pantheism,' or 'Mr. Arnold here disowns Christianity.' " (Letters of Matthew Arnold 1848-1888, ed. George W. E. Russell [1895], I, 436-437.) But under the editorship of Knowles, who appreciated Arnold's genius and sympathized with his religious thought, Arnold became a frequent contributor to the Review, publishing ten essays in it. Among these were his "Review of Objections to 'Literature and Dogma,' " the seven parts of which were later published as God and the Bible (1875). Arnold's references to the magazine during Knowles's editorship were always complimentary. In 1873, he wrote to his friend M. Ernest Fontanès, a French pasteur: "Vous avez bien gout, je crois, de vous abonner à la Contemporary Review.... ( Letters, II, 121. For other references to the magazine under Knowles's editorship, see Letters, II, 134, 138, 139, 238.) One can clearly see the rapport between author and editor in a letter that Arnold wrote to his sister Frances in December, 1886, at a time of bad weather: "To-day we have no post at all.... To London [however] the line is open, and letters will be sent there to-night. How much farther they will get I know not, but Knowles will get the corrected proof of my article ["The Zenith of Conservatism," Nineteenth Century, XXI (January, 1887, 148-164] at his house in St. James's Park, and take it to the printer.... That is being a good editor; to do everything to facilitate your contributor's task, instead of worrying him." (Letters, II, 418-419. For other references to Knowles, see Letters, II, 232, 241, 320, 380, 412, 416.) 2 Arnold's first book to bear the imprint of Macmillan and Company was A French Eton (1864). One sees the regard that Alexander Macmillan (1818- 1896), director of the house and founder of Macmillan's Magazine, though never its editor, had for Arnold in a letter that Arnold wrote to his mother in 1864: "I have a note from Macmillan, who is an extremely intelligent, active man, sending me a cheque for my article ["A French Eton," Part II, Macmillan's Magazine, IX (February, 1864), 343-355], and saying he only wished he could afford to pay it in any degree in proportion to its worth-so excellent and important did he think it." ( Letters, I, 260. For an account of Arnold's publications in Macmillan's , see Charles Morgan, The House ot Macmillan, 1843-1943 [1944], pp. 59-60.) Considering Arnold's friendly relations with Knowles and Macmillan, one sees that he had little reason to find other outlets for his articles. 3 The discourse on Emerson was the famous lecture that Arnold first delivered in Boston in 1883 while he was on his American lecture tour (October, 1883-March, 1884). It was first published, under the simple title "Emerson," in Macmillan's in May, 1884 (L, 1-13), and was afterwards reprinted in Discourses in America (1885). 4 Arnold's elder daughter was soon to marry a young American. (See Note I, Letter II.) Apparently Arnold and his wife planned to visit the young couple in the latter part of 1885. However, Arnold himself was not to return to America until June, 1886. (See Letters, II, 383 ff.) 5 The title that he had intended to use for the article, "A Christmas Meditation," was changed to "A Comment on Christmas." 1 Arnold's elder daughter, Lucy Charlotte, was married to Frederick Wallingford Whitridge, of New York, whom she had met while accompanying her parents on their tour of America. 2 The article that Arnold had promised to Knowles for the January number of the Nineteenth Century was seemingly "A Word More about America," which, however, did not appear until February, 1885 (XVII, 219-236.) 1 Arnold published only two articles in 1885, "A Comment on Christmas," and the one referred to in Note 2, Letter II. 2 One has no way of knowing the particular circumstances in which "A Comment on Christmas" was written. Nevertheless, the following description of the inspector at work on one of his essays during free time at a school is not irrelevant. This reminiscence was recorded by a teacher who had known Arnold only as an inspector: "Some of Matthew Arnold's own literary work was performed during lawful intervals of active inspection on such occasions. For hours the students would be silently writing their tasks while the inspector was silently writing his. His manuscript was placed on the lid of a grand piano which stood in the roomy hall, a few words would be penned, and then the author would rise and noiselessly pace the floor, chin aloft, and hands clasped in the rear. A few more words would then be added, and the perambulation would begin again." ( Pall Mall Budget, XXXVI [April 19, 1888], II.) 1 As Arnold said in his first letter to Bunting, "A Comment on Christmas" follows "in general the same line of thought ant feeling with which Literature and Dogma and God and the Bible have made the public more or less familiar." The theme of the article and of the two books is simply expressed in a letter that Arnold wrote to young George Macmillan, the son of his publisher, in 1876: "In Literature and Dogma I have pointed out that the real upshot of the teaching of Jesus Christ was this: 'If every one would mend one, we should have a new world.' " (Letters, II, 150.) In the article, Arnold asserts that, although a belief in miracles must be lost, one must, at the same time, retain Christian morals. To lose Christian morals is to imperil oneself, and needlessly. What men need most, he maintains, is an understanding of what the essential facts and truths of Chrisianity really are, not a literal belief in the miraculous or preternatural The two Christian virtues with which he is most concerned in the essay are pureness and charity. The virgin birth he regards as “the popular homage to a high ideal of pureness,” a virtue recognized by such lofty spirits as Plato, Sophocles, and Goethe. The ideal of pureness is the force needed to oppose lubricity, which brings moral confusion. (For a penetrating exposition of Arnold's attitude toward lubricity, see Lionel Trilling, Matthew Arnold [1939], pp. 344-346.) In discussing charity, Arnold insists that both rich and poor must prefer the common good to private possession and personal enjoyment. If they do not, they will be unable to make part of the ideal society of the future. He finds virtue of charity in the ascendency, especially “in the framing of laws and in the interpretation of them by tribunals,” where “regard to property and privilege used to be . . . paramount, and the idea of common good hardly considered at all. . . .An acceleration of progress in the spread of ideas of this kind,” Arnold says, “a decline of vitality in institutions where the opposite ideas were paramount, marks the close of a period. Jesus announced for his own period such a close; a close necessitated by the emergence of the new, the decay of the old.” ( St. Paul and Protestantism [1889], p.170.) Jesus, Arnold insists, did ot announce the end of the world, but rather the end of the age. In looking over the society of his own time, Arnold is inclined to augur that the social orgtanization of the 1880's is not far from such end of the age. Dissolution will be peaceful, he says, if men have virtue enough, and violent if they are vicious. The essay, them, is a plea for an ideal society, one that conforms “to the line of Jesus”; for the attainment of such a future, each member of society must mend himself, must implant within him the two central virtues of Christianity, pureness and charity. 2 Arnold's religious position and its effect upon his readers is succinctly stated by his friend George W. Smalley, the American journalist who was European correspondent to the New York Tribune, and who helped him plan his lecture tour of America: "[Arnold] saw how much there is in current theological dogmas which it has become impossible to preserve. All the more he wanted to preserve what had not become impossible. But the orthodox were furious and, I suppose, may for some time yet continue to be furious. If they but knew it, Arnold was on their side, only wiser than they." ("Matthew Arnold," London Letters and Some Others [1891], I, 296.) 3 The Revised Version of the New Testament was first published in England on May 17, 1881, and that of the Old and New Testaments together on May 19, 1885. (See C. J. Cadoux, "The Revised Version and After," The Bible in Its Ancient and English Versions, ed. H. Wheeler Robinson [1940], p. 250.) Arnold would have written ably on the Revised Version, not only because he had long been a careful student of the Bible, but also because he had prepared an emended transcript of Isaiah, one of many early efforts to improve upon the Authorized Version. (See A Bible- Reading for Schools [1872], The Great Prophecy of Israel's Restoration [1875], and Isaiah of Jerusalem [1883].) 1 This letter refers to the tour that Arnold made of Germany, Switzerland, and France at the request of the Education Office. (See Letters, II, 337 ff.) Its purpose was to make a study of free schools abroad. (See Stuart P. Sherman, Matthew Arnold: How to Know Him [1917], pp. 47-48.) Arnold's Special Report, the result of the tour, was issued by the Education Department in 1886 and was later reprinted as Special Report on Elementary Education Abroad ( 1888). Arnold, who had been appointed one of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools on April 14, 1851, resigned his post on April 30,1886. 1 This terse letter was written on the day that Arnold's brother-in-law William Edward Forster (1818-1886) was buried at Burley-in-Wharfedale. Forster, who had married Jane Martha Arnold in 1850, died in London on April 5. A Quaker manufacturer and statesman, he represented the conservative type of liberal in Parliament. With Arnold, he had been a supporter of popular education, and in February, 1870, had introduced his most important piece of legislation, the Elementary Education Bill. 2 It was characteristic of Arnold to refuse requests to write memorial pieces for those whom he had cared for most. After the death of his close friend Arthur Hugh Clough, Arnold said in a letter to his mother: "I have been asked to write a Memoir of him for the Daily News but that I cannot do. I could not write about him in a newspaper now, nor can, I think, at length in a review, but I shall some day in some way or other relieve myself of what I think about him." ( Letters , I, 177.) Though Clough died in November, 1861, "Thyrsis" was not published until April, 1866; and almost certainly it was "published as soon as it was written." (C. B. Tinker and H. F. Lowry, The Poetry of Matthew Arnold, A Commentary [1940], p. 216.) 1 A Comment on Christmas," under its title in the Contemporary Review, was reprinted in the popular edition of St. Paul and Protestantism (1887), which had originally appeared in 1870. The essay, which was placed at the end of the volume, is "timorously and incongruously associated with the otherwise admirable unity" of the book. "It contains but three material modifications of any scope; and these are readily explicable as examples of Matthew Arnold's steady desires to clarify and to condense." (E. K. Brown, Studies in the Text of Matthew Arnold's Prose Works [Paris, 1935], p. 39) 1 Arnold refers to the publication of Edward Dowden's The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley (1886). The essay was later written and was simply entitled "Shelley." It appeared in the Nineteenth Century in January, 1888 (XXIII, 23-39), and it was later reprinted in Essays in Criticism, Second Series (1888). Speaking of the essay, Arnold wrote to Lady de Rothschild in January 1888: "In this article on Shelley I have spoken of his life, not his poetry. Professor Dowden was too much for my patience." (Letters, II, 433.) 1 A Comment on Christmas" was Arnold's last appearance in the Contemporary Review. Before his death, however, in 1888, he published thirteen more articles: one in 1886 (a busy year for him with trips to the continent and to America), eight in 1887, and four in 1888. Of these, he gave seven to Knowles, of the Nineteenth Century, who esteemed him so highly. A letter that the aging Arnold wrote to his wife in April, 1886, gives touching proof of Arnold's happiness in pleasing Knowles: "I had a severe week with my article ["The Nadir of Liberalism," Nineteenth Century , XIX (May 1886), 645-663] last week, but it is all done now, and Knowles telegraphs to me that it is 'magnificent,' and that he means to open his number with it. So, at any rate, I continue to give satisfaction to the Editors." (Letters, II, 380.) Of the remaining articles, two understandably appeared in Murray's Magazine, which was edited by his nephew E. A. Arnold. (See Letters, II, 406.) The other four appeared, one each, in Macmillan's Magazine, in which he had appeared sixteen times- in the Fortnightly Review, in which he had appeared eight times; in the National Review, in which he had appeared twice; and in the Century Magazine, to which he made his only contribution. Concerning Arnold's distribution of his articles, one can conjecture with some confidence. It is clear enough why he gave articles to Knowles, his favorite editor, and to his nephew. As for the disposition of the remaining four, the answer is to be found in a letter that he wrote to M. Fontanès in November, 1886: ". . . on my return home [from America, where he had visited his elder daughter and her family] I find myself confronted by half a dozen editors, who allege promises made by me to give them an article when I became free: and, as I have at last resigned my inspectorship, they summon me to fulfil my promises. Something I must do to satisfy them, and this will keep me busy up to Easter...." ( Letters, II, 413-414.) In other words, after he had taken care of Knowles and his nephew, he wished to oblige as many other editors as he could. One may wonder why he gave Macmillan's only one of the later articles. Perhaps Arnold felt that, since Macmillan and Company were his publishers, they were getting their share of him. Although Bunting repeatedly asked him for other contributions, there were not enough articles to supply the admiring Knowles, his nephew, and those other editors to whom he felt an indebtedness because of his promises and their genuine interest. It is obvious that, since Bunting offered Arnold a larger sum for his articles than he was in the habit of receiving, money could not persuade him to contribute to any periodical. It might be added that some of the articles he was to publish after "A Comment on Christmas" continue to show his pre-occupation with religious attitudes, for instance, "A 'Friend of God,' " Nineteenth Century, XXI (April, 1887), 499-506; the last paragraphs of "Amiel," Macmillan's Magazine, LVI (September, 1887), 321-329; and much of "Count Leo Tolstoi," Fortnightly Review, XLII (December, 1887), 783-799. 1 Arnold had long been interested in Alexander Vinet (1797-1847), the Swiss-born French literary critic and theologian, who had received the admiration of such diverse men as Sainte-Beuve, Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Henri Amiel, and Edmond Scherer. (See Laura M Lane, The Life and Writings of Alexander Vinet [1890], pp. ix-x.) Vinet, along with Spinoza, Thomas à Kempis, St. Augustine, Joubert, the De and Bishop Wilson, had been important in helping Arnold "to work out for himself a modified version of the Christian belief." (Tinker and Lowry, pp. 268-269.) Early in 1865, Arnold had written his mother: "If I can do Vinet to my mind it will be a great thing, and I shall have reached the Dissenters and the Middle Class; then I shall stop for the present." ( Letters , I, 287. For other references to Vinet in Arnold, see Letters, 1, 303- Literature and Dogma [1902], p. x, and The Note-Books, pp. 430, 431, 436, 535, 536.) Unfortunately Arnold died on April 15, 1888, before he was able to write the essay on Vinet.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The First Book Printed at Bari by Dennis E. Rhodes</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN THE course of my researches for a series of articles on the early bibliography of Southern Italy which are to be published in the Florentine journal La Bibliofilia , I have paid particular attention to a rare and handsome book, the Operette of a man calling himself 'II Parthenopeo Suavio,' printed at Bari in 1535. Few copies are recorded today, but the book has never been lost sight of: a copy featured in the Catalogue des livres de la Bibliothèque de feu M. Ie Duc de la Vallière in Paris in 1788, and the volume has been described by Giustiniani (1793), Panzer (1793-1803), Minieri Riccio (1844), and several more modern bibliographers, such as Fumagalli. The especial interest of the book lies in the fact that it is not only the first book printed in Bari, but it is also the only book ever printed in the sixteenth century in the whole of Apulia, with the probable exception of the village of Copertino near Lecce, where one Giovanni Bernardino Desa almost certainly printed between 1583 and 1591 a number of books. Copies of the Operette exist today in the British Museum (King's Library, 81.k.18), the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris (Rés. Yd. 579), and the Biblioteca di storia patria, Naples. 1 A copy was offered by Hoepli in Milan in 1926; while another, belonging to the publishing house of Laterza in Bari, was shown in an exhibition in that town in 1951. 2 I give a description of the British Museum copy: OPERETTE DEL PAR/thenopeo Suauio in uarij tempi &amp; per diuersi / subietti composte, Et da Siluan Flammineo / insiemi raccolte, Et alla amorosa &amp; / moral sua Calamita / intitulate. Colophon: Stampato in Bari per Mastro Gilliberto / Nehou Francese in le case de San/to Nicolo a di 15 de / Ottobre / Ne lanno de la Natiuita del / Signore / M.D.XXXV. Quarto. 192 leaves, A-Z 8 Aa 8 . The printed register occurs on Aa7 recto. The British Museum copy is without the last (blank?) leaf. The titlepage has a woodcut showing a musician playing the mandolin or guitar, and a winged Cupid shooting arrows. There are woodcuts in the text on D4 verso, 18 verso and R1 verso. The preliminaries contain addresses by the author to Ferrando di Capua, Duke of Termoli (A2 recto) and to the famous Neapolitan humanist Jacopo Sannazaro (A3 recto). All the book's obvious connections, therefore, are with Naples, and, as was natural, that city represented by far the greatest printing centre south of Rome throughout the sixteenth century. Why then were the Operette not printed at Naples, but instead at Bari, a town on the remote Apulian coast, where as yet no printing-press had ever been set up ? To attempt an answer to this question, we have to consider the identities of two mysterious personages: 'il Parthenopeo Suavio,' the author, and Gillibert Nehou, the printer. Only recently does the true identity of the pseudonymous author seem to have been satisfactorily explained. There is a whole chapter devoted to the book and entitled "Il primo libro a stampa" in Armando Perotti's Bari ignota (Trani, 1907, pp. 101-108), but this is rather in the nature of a romantic speculation than a scientific investigation of the bibliographical evidence. The candidates whom Perotti puts forward for the authorship of the Operette include unlikely and obscure characters such as Crisostomo Colonna, Federico Crivello, Girolamo de la Penna, and Spinetto Ventura. All of these he eventually rejects except the last, a Lecce baron. But present-day scholars seem at last to have hit upon the truth when they unanimously affirm that the 'Parthenopeo Suavio' was one Niccolò Antonio Carmignano. 3 This poet, who wrote equally well in Latin and Italian, was appointed Treasurer in the Kingdom of Naples by Bona Sforza, Queen of Poland, who invited him later to Bari and made him Governor of the castle there. The Queen first travelled from Naples to her Northern kingdom in 1518, and thereafter she was frequently in Bari, while Carmignano died there in 1544. 4 Internal evidence of the Operette, quite apart from the evidence of Tafuri, shows that 'Suavio' was a close and faithful partisan of Queen Bona Sforza, for the book contains several sections, both of prose and verse, addressed directly to her, and one long poem describes her embarkation at Manfredonia for Fiume and Poland. Now what of the printer, Gillibert Nehou the Frenchman ? Absolutely nothing is known of him, for in no other book has his name been recorded. The surname Nehou seems to belong to Normandy, since a certain Quentin Nehou was 'procureur' at Rouen on 19 November 1579, 5 and a Lucas de Néhou, who flourished about 1688, is believed to have been born in Normandy. 6 But who Gillibert Nehou was, and how he came to print one book in Bari in 1535, I have been unable to discover. That his stay there was not a long one seems certain: he may even have accompanied the Queen's entourage from Naples. At least there is no need to doubt the authenticity of the colophon. The 'houses of Saint Nicholas,' where Nehou had his shop, tell us nothing precise: for Nicholas is the patron saint of all Bari, and these houses might have been located anywhere in the old quarter of the town. This much seems clear-that the book was printed at Bari rather than Naples because the author's allegiance to Bona Sforza had caused him to take up residence there, and this is why, on historical grounds, Carmignano is the most likely candidate for the identity of 'Il Parthenopeo Suavio.' He still liked to call himself a Neapolitan in provincial Bari. The woodcuts in the volume deserve especial consideration, but they, too, raise some unusually puzzling problems. Sander 7 describes the titlepage woodcut as having been borrowed from an edition of Tibaldeo, Venice, 25 June 1507, while the cut on 18 verso is of Florentine origin, copied from an edition of the Vendetta di Vespasiano; but, says Sander, "on le trouve aussi dans Grisedio, S., Aquila, 1493." Unfortunately none of these three books is in the British Museum, and I have been unable to compare the woodcuts with their prototypes. Paul Kristeller, in Early Florentine Woodcuts (London, 1897), has a description of several similar cuts in Florentine editions of the Vendetta, but all of these he dates c. 1550, i.e. long after the Bari edition. Kristeller has no illustration resembling the Bari cuts. The most perplexing problem is that Sander's illustration no. 746, which is reputed to come from the Bari book, is a totally different cut from that on 18 verso of the British Museum copy which represents the same scene: Vespasian in a boat which also carries images of the Virgin Mary and (Christ. In the B.M. copy, the boat is sailing the other way. Sander remarks, however, that T. de Marinis (the Florentine bibliographer) "possède un exemplaire avec le même bois, mais en sens inverse et de taille plus grossière." This sounds like the same cut as that in the B.M. copy. Were different cuts inserted in different copies, or has Sander been misled? It would seem that he has, for although his reproduction represents the same scene, it measures 85 X 110 mm., and is almost too wide to fit on a page whose type-area is 80 x 170 mm. I tend to believe that Sander has shown one of the earlier woodcuts from which the Bari version was derived, but I have not deemed it practicable to obtain facsimiles from all known extant copies in order to substantiate this theory. 8 After the curiously isolated episode in typographical history in which a handsome book produced by an otherwise unheard-of press makes its solitary appearance in 1535, no other book was printed in Bari for the next sixty-eight years. We should like to know details of the career of Gillibert Nehou, but we seem destined to remain in complete ignorance. Addendum: Since this article was written, I have had the fortune to meet Signor De Marinis, who informs me that the copy of the Operette now in Bari is the same one which he formerly owned and which he donated to Laterza some years ago. He assures me that Sander has in error reproduced a cut which comes not from the Bari book at all, but from some earlier volume (possibly a Neapolitan incunable) which at present I am unable to identify. Sander's explanatory text is correspondingly at fault in the description of the De Marinis copy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 This Naples copy once belonged to Minieri Riccio, who lists it in his Memorie storiche degli scrittori nati nel Regno di Napoli, Napoli, 1844, p. 340. He knew of Carmignano as a poet, but did not connect him with 'Suavio,' since he gives them two separate entries (p. 88 and p. 340). can his copy be the same as that which also belonged in 1900 to count Francesco Bonazzi in Naples? (Ludovico Pepe, Storia della successione degli Sforzeschi negli stati di Puglia e Calabria, Bari, 1900, p. 309.) 2 Mostra documentaria del pensiero economico-politico pugliese dei secc. XVI-XX. Catalogo. Bari, 1951, p. 59 and pl. VII. The correct identity of Suavio was known to the compiler of this catalogue, Beniamino d'Amato. 3 As Beniamino d'Amato (n. 2 supra ), and Fernanda Ascarelli, La Tipografia Cinquecentina Italiana, Firenze, 1953, p. 116. They do not, however, quote an authority. 4 Giovanni Bernardino Tafuri, Istoria degli scrittori nati nel Regno di Napoli, tom. 3, pt. 1, Napoli, 1750, pp. 163-5. Tafuri does not mention the Operette. 5 G. Lepreux, Gallia typographica. Série départementale, tom. 3, vol. 2 (Normandie), Paris, 1912, p. 81. 6 E. Frère, Manuel du bibliographe normand, tom. 2, Rouen, 1858, p. 337. 7 Max Sander, Le Livre à figures italien depuis 1467 jusqu' à 1530, tom. 3, Milan, 1942, p. 1229, no. 7107, and tom. 6, illustration 746. The book technically falls outside the period covered by Sander's title which is however loosely-worded. 8 However, the copy in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris and the Laterza copy in Bari, I have ascertained, contain the same cut as the B. M. volume.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Abstracts From the Wills and Estates of Boston Printers, 1800-1825 by Rollo G. Silver</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MORE THAN fifty years ago, Plomer, influenced by the previous work of Ames and Herbert, demonstrated the usefulness of wills in book trade history. 1 By means of such documents and estate inventories, one obtains an intimate view of the printer's possessions as well as an occasional glimpse of his station in life. Although other English bibliographers followed the example of Plomer, 2 few Americans have ever turned to our Probate Courts for this source material. The following abstracts, it is hoped, will induce similar studies for other areas and other periods. It must be noted that assembling a group of these abstracts is not an easy task. A number of embarrassments invariably impede what otherwise might be an automatic search. It is disconcerting to find significant papers missing from a folder. In other instances, financial statements lack clarity or a complete accounting of funds. Finally, one must be able to withstand the glare of uncivil civil servants loath to search in old and dusty files. Nevertheless, the investigation is warranted-even for a period as late as the nineteenth century. The inventories of printing offices, when gathered in sufficient quantity, give promise of rewarding statistical information. Much biographical data lie hidden in the wills. Furthermore, a survey of these abstracts which follow suggests interesting conclusions: The richest printers owned newspapers; the independent book and job printer did not succeed as well; and, if a journeyman left any estate at all, it was usually infinitesimal, sometimes insolvent. Only additional abstracts, however, will verify these generalizations and contribute towards definite knowledge of the methods of operating a printing business. 3 ADAMS, ABIJAH Will, dated 28 October 1815: Bequests: To the "Son of my Wife," Davis Coolidge Ballard, $500.00; to Lucy Adams, wife, two-thirds of personal estate and income; to Lucy Von Hagen, "eldest Daughter of my Wife," one-third of personal estate and income; to Mary Ann Adams, "my only Daughter," all real estate.
