      <field name="heading_text">Textual Criticism and Deconstruction by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In recent years there has been an increasing tendency for literary critics to refer to literary works as "texts." In consequence, the term "textual criticism" has become ambiguous, some people regarding it as a synonym for "literary criticism." 1 Traditionally, of course, "textual criticism" has meant the scholarly activity of studying the textual histories of verbal works in an effort to propose reliable texts of those works (according to one or another definition of correctness). This activity has commonly been though of as preparatory to literary criticism—as if it were mechanical or objective, and as if its results were to be unquestioningly accepted as the starting point for interpretive discussion. The products of textual criticism, however, like all historical reconstructions, incorporate judgments and assumptions. Textual critics must try to understand the works they are editing (however one defines "understand") in order to make choices among variant readings and decisions about emendations; they inevitably engage in literary criticism. So-called literary critics, for their part, should recognize—though they rarely do—that they must evaluate the makeup of particular texts in the process of analyzing literary works. Any development that brings "textual critics" and "literary critics" closer together is to be welcomed. The problem with the recent equation of the words "texts" and "works" is that, while it brings the two terms together, it completely ignores the issues that textual criticism has always dealt with. The distinction between the texts of documents (handwritten or printed, private or published) and the texts of works is basic to textual criticism. The effort to "reconstruct" or "establish" the texts of works presupposes that the texts we find in documents cannot automatically be equated with the texts of the works that those documents claim to be conveying. Literary critics who neglect, or are oblivious to, this point are not commenting on works but on the arrangements of words and punctuation that happen to have come their way in particular documents. 2 The critical movement widely known as "deconstruction" provides an interesting illustration. Those who have written from this point of view have been especially concerned with exploring the nature of literature, and it is therefore surprising that they have given so little attention to a matter so fundamental to the definition of reading and the understanding of the medium of literature. Geoffrey Hartman, in the preface to Deconstruction and Criticism (1979), a collection of essays often thought of as a manifesto of deconstruction, continually uses the word "text" to mean "work." When at the outset, for example, he refers to "the great texts of our culture," he is not thinking of great documents—that is, landmarks in the transmission of historically important works—but of the works themselves. He identifies a central concern of the volume to be the "priority of language to meaning"; but he does not acknowledge the failure of the volume to consider an equally fundamental matter—the logic of accepting any sequence of words as it comes to us. Such acceptance implies a reverence for artifacts; otherwise the words or their arrangement could be freely altered. Yet even an interest in verbal artifacts as historical statements requires a questioning of documents, given the variability, from one document to another, of the texts—the arrangements of words—that purport to represent the same work. In the process of examining how a given word functions in a particular context, those interested in history and those not interested in history must alike ask whether it is the word that ought to be there. In what follows I shall look at the use of the word "text" in the five essays of Deconstruction and Criticism (with a glance or two at some related writings) 3 and consider the implications of that usage for the arguments they make. Although Hartman says that the book is not "a manifesto in the ordinary sense" and although the five authors do not hold identical positions, they were willing to be published together under the title Deconstruction and Criticism , and we may therefore regard the essays as indicative of the "shared set of problems" (in Hartman's words) that characterizes the deconstructive approach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The first essay in Deconstruction and Criticism is Harold Bloom's "The Breaking of Form" (pp. 1-37), an appropriate opening because (as the title suggests) it focuses directly on an operative principle of deconstruction, stated succinctly in the first paragraph: "in a poem it is not form itself that gleams or sparkles. . . . the lustres of poetic meaning come rather from the breaking apart of form." In the ensuing five pages, Bloom, speaking in Emersonian cadences, utters a powerful statement of the importance, cultural and personal, of what he calls "strong reading"—the activity whereby readers struggle with poems, fight with poems to create their own meanings. "Only strength is memorable," he says, for "only the capacity to wound gives a healing capacity the chance to endure, and so to be heard" (p. 5). Therefore "good poems must be combative"; "Reading well is a struggle," a "warfare" in which one fights to establish, during the "encounter," one's own interpretation. A strong reader of Bloom's essay, excited and invigorated by this opening, will look forward to the development of these ideas in the remainder of the piece—and will, unfortunately, be disappointed. This disappointment has nothing to do with agreement or disagreement: a strong reader who disagrees with the ideas of a strong essay—or, rather, breaks the structure of those ideas apart and re-creates them in a new form—would not be expressing disappointment but rather respect for the intellectual challenge posed by the essay. Such disagreement would indicate the success of the essay, and one would have no reason in those circumstances to be disappointed by it. What would cause disappointment is a fundamental weakness, in its own terms, of the process of thought underlying the essay, a flaw that would render it a weak combatant. The first hint of such a flaw in Bloom's essay occurs on the sixth page of its printed form, where the word "textual" first appears. Up to this point Bloom has spoken of "poems," "fictions," and "works" but has said nothing about "texts." A reader alert to the difference between works and texts will have wondered whether a strong reading of a poem does not begin with being critical or combative about the constitution of the text of the poem, whether "reading well" does not entail the questioning of the makeup of the text as well as of the meaning of the work; and the reader will have assumed that these matters are to be pursued as the essay develops. But the first reference to "texts" is disquieting: "Gnostic exegesis of Scripture is always a salutary act of textual violence" (p. 6). Out of context this remark would be taken by most readers, I think, to refer to the extracting of meaning from particular sequences of words (that is, particular "texts") found in particular documents. When, however, one reads this sentence in the light of what has led up to it, the meaning of "textual" is not so clear. The violence described earlier occurs in the clash between a "strong" or "creative" reader and a "combative" poem—a poem , a work of literature, not the text of an artifact. If Bloom in this sentence is still talking about the same kind of violence, are we to conclude that he is using "text" as a synonym for "poem" and "work"? 4 If so, then what word, we wonder, will he use to refer to the sequence of words found in a particular document? Or is he not going to recognize the distinction between such a sequence of words and a "work"? The disappointing answers to these questions emerge in the passage immediately following (pp. 7-8), in which Bloom discusses his belief that "a strong reading is the only text": "there are no texts," he says, "but only interpretations." 5 Since there manifestly are texts, in the sense of series of words handed down to us on pieces of paper or parchment, 6 he is obviously equating "texts" with "works" and asserting that works have no meanings independent of the interpretations of those who encounter them. But how do we know when we are encountering a work? How do we know that the texts we encounter in documents are reliable representations of works? We may legitimately not care whether they accurately reflect the author's, or anyone else's, intention; but if that is our position, it must be made clear. Because verbal works do not exist in physical form, as visual works do, there is no way of avoiding the question of the relation between texts and works, whatever names we call them by. I am of course using "texts" here to mean specific oral or written sequences of words and pauses (or marks of punctuation); but the issue I am raising is not one of definitions of terms. Bloom is free to use "texts" and "works" synonymously if he wishes, but he then needs another term to refer to what "texts" conventionally denotes; for he is not free, if he hopes to present a coherent argument, to ignore the distinction. A natural opportunity to pursue this matter presents itself to Bloom at this point, as he takes up Gershom Scholem's work on Kabbalah. Scholem, explaining why "there is no written Torah here on earth," says (as quoted by Bloom): "Everything that we perceive in the fixed forms of the Torah, written in ink on parchment, consists, in the last analysis, of interpretations or definitions of what is hidden. . . . There is no written Torah, free from the oral element, that can be known or conceived of by creatures who are not prophets." How this passage fits Bloom's purpose is obvious. But what he might also have said is that it offers an analogue of the relation between every text and the work it purports to represent. Just as the Torah as work is not fully knowable through any of its written manifestations, so also are the documentary texts of all literary (and other verbal) works but imperfect guides to the works they attempt to transmit. And just as the only Torahs we can have are the interpretive results of the process of analyzing the physical evidence present in documents, so also the only texts that we can possibly have of all verbal works are the ones we construct from the evidence presented to us in documents (or, in some cases, in oral traditions), using our individual judgments to choose among variant readings or to insert new readings. Not only are the meanings of works subject to our interpretation (which may or may not be historically oriented), but also the very constitution of the texts of those works is the product of our interpretive judgment. One thinks, at first, that Bloom is going to make this point, for he says that Scholem's statement is true not only of "Text Itself" (Scripture) but also of "all lesser texts." Immediately, however, he places "poem" in apposition with "texts": ". . . true of all lesser texts, of all poems more belated than the Torah." Once again, then, "texts" are works. If, therefore, one substitutes "work" for "text" in his next paragraph, one has no difficulty following, indeed admiring, its ridicule of professors who believe "in the real presence of the literary text . . . in editions, definitive editions, upon which responsible commentaries might be written." Those who believe that works reside in printed books and who unquestioningly accept the texts of any editions, even scholarly ones, as if they were the works themselves, indeed deserve our criticism for misunderstanding the nature of the medium that verbal works employ. But we still have a problem here, for Bloom fails (whether or not the failure is induced by his use of the word "text") to include in his formulation the indeterminacy of texts (arrangements of words) as well as of meanings (interpretations of the significance of words). He proceeds to say, in commentary on the foregoing, "I only know a text, any text, because I know a reading of it," and elaborates, "I do not know Lycidas when I recite it to myself, in the sense that I know the Lycidas by the Milton." A primary reason for his not knowing "Lycidas" in this sense is that he cannot be sure how close his text of it is to the one Milton intended (or to any of the ones Milton may have intended at various times). But this reason is not what Bloom has in mind. He means that he can only know "Lycidas" through his, or someone's, interpretation of it and that there is no one Miltonic meaning that stands independent of those interpretations. But he does not say how he comes by the particular text he is following or what difference it might make to his interpretation if he followed a different one. He is therefore behaving in a fashion much more similar than he suspects to that of the professors he castigates and pities, for by ignoring the textual question entirely he is tying himself just as uncritically as they to some fixed text (or texts). He is tacitly endorsing the notion that editing is distinct from criticism, failing to see that editing involves critical judgments and that criticism must question the constitution of texts if it is to be concerned with works rather than documents. Bloom's total neglect of the relation of texts to works—or, put differently, of the mode of existence of verbal statements—undercuts his eloquent arguments and reduces them to incoherence time and again. In the next paragraph, for instance, he offers a prose-poem about words , words that "refer only to other words," words that "will not interpret themselves"—and, finally, "words lying against time" (p. 9). But where are the words that lie against time, carrying on "the verbal agon for freedom"? Everything in the paragraph suggests that he is talking about verbal works, verbal constructions, not documents (printed or handwritten) with their multiplicity of errors. 7 In the context of the essay, however, where no distinction between works and texts is made, the passage loses the force that it rightly should have, for readers will be at a loss to know how one locates those words that, lying against time, can serve to occupy the independent mind in its struggle for a sense of freedom. How much richer the passage would be if it resonated with the ironies inherent in every attempt to preserve verbal works: poems survive—to the extent that they do survive—only through remembered, written, or printed versions, all of which must, in one degree or another, be suspect. We constantly encounter texts lying against time, in the documents that come to us from the past, and we are free to decide that the words in those texts are the words we wish to be concerned with. But they cannot automatically be equated with the words that constitute works of poets from the past. Whatever our attitude toward the past, we cannot be moved by Bloom's phrase "words lying against time" because it reflects a naïve oversimplification of the process it aims to help elucidate. These comments on the first nine pages of Bloom's essay provide, I believe, a way of reading the rest of it. References to "a specific poem" (p. 10), to reading a poem "properly" (p. 16), and so on are simply vague, rather than alive with the intriguing indeterminacies that accompany any effort to locate a verbal work. A place does occur in the essay where a distinction between "text" and "poem" is made, but it is not the one I am making: in discussing the "revisionary ratios" that a poet uses against a predecessor, Bloom says, "As text, a ratio names intertextual differences; as poem it characterizes a total relationship between two poets, earlier and later" (p. 19). The relation of work to documentary text remains untouched. In the second part of his essay, Bloom examines a "proof-text," Ashbery's "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror"; and although he makes extensive quotation from some (unspecified) text of the poem, he never once questions that text as a representation of the work. Presumably he is using the text in Ashbery's 1975 volume of the same title, for one of his quotations includes a line that varies between the 1975 text and the August 1974 Poetry magazine text, and the reading in his quotation is that of 1975 book. 8 Furthermore, the division into verse-paragraphs in the text Bloom is following is the same as in the 1975 book. Bloom says (p. 27) that the first verse-paragraph closes with the line "Affirmation that doesn't affirm anything"—as it indeed does in the 1975 text (p. 70), but not in the 1974 text, where there is an earlier paragraph break (53 lines earlier, after the line beginning "Its hollow perfectly:"—p. 69, line 17, in 1975). This matter is of some moment, since the division into six verse-paragraphs is a "happy division" for Bloom, allowing him to associate the six sections with his six-part "apotropaic litany of evasions or revisionary ratios" (p. 23). 9 At another point in the essay, however, his quotation contains a word that differs from both the 1974 and the 1975 texts, raising the question whether he is following some third text, if such a text existed when he wrote. 10 More likely the word in his quotation is simply a typographical error, but one cannot be sure. Nevertheless, this error (if it is one) does illustrate the point that all texts must be questioned if our interest is not in random texts but in the works they are intended to represent. Just as Bloom's quotations may contain errors, so may the 1974 and 1975 texts that Ashbery authorized. 11 The few differences between them do not seem particularly significant, but one cannot rule out the possibility that some readers would find them significant. Besides, however trivial the differences may be, 12 can we assume that the 1975 readings are always the ones Ashbery wished? Is not the possibility that Ashbery made the changes itself significant? And may there not be other places, alike in both texts, that do not accurately reflect his intention? I am not suggesting that Bloom should explicitly have taken these questions up in his essay; but he should give evidence of having thought about them. As long as he is treating the poem as by a particular person (and he does comment on Ashbery's "career" and allude to other poems by Ashbery), he cannot avoid being concerned with "Self-Portrait" as a work , not merely as a text that is located in a given copy of a printed edition. His not doing so casts doubt on the whole undertaking: the textual variants in this instance may be minor, but the failure to recognize the issues is a major conceptual flaw.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Paul de Man's essay "Shelley Disfigured," which follows Bloom's essay in Deconstruction and Criticism (pp. 39-73), exhibits the same blurring of the essential distinction between texts of documents and texts of works. The first endnote might make one think otherwise, for in it de Man identifies the scholarly edition that is the source of his quotations and refers to another piece of textual scholarship. 13 But that note is attached to the second sentence of the essay, and the opening sentence has already revealed de Man's confusion: "Like several of the English romantics' major works The Triumph of Life , Shelley's last poem, is, as is well known, a fragment that has been unearthed, edited, reconstructed and much discussed." Up to the word "poem" the sentence is fairly clear: it refers to "major works" and identifies "The Triumph of Life" as a "poem"—that is, a "work" (though whether he wishes us to understand that he considers it a "major work" is not clear). 14 He then states that the poem is a "fragment"—a word that does not necessarily pose a problem, since a work can be regarded (by its author or by others) as unfinished. When, however, he says that the fragment has been "unearthed" and "edited" and "reconstructed," the sentence becomes incoherent. Though "unearthed" is a figurative term here and does not literally refer to removing from the earth, it does surely imply the uncovering, the discovery, of a pre-existing tangible object—a manuscript on which a text has been inscribed. Given the medium of verbal works, one cannot "unearth" such a work but only a physical document containing a text purporting to be the text of a particular work. Thus the "fragment" that has been unearthed is a document, not a "poem"; the meaning of "fragment" required to go with "unearthed" is different from the meaning required by the earlier part of the sentence (in which "Shelley's last poem" is "a fragment"). The next verb, "edited," makes sense if the reader will excuse a slight imprecision, for what has been edited is not literally the document (or "fragment") but the text of the document. The third verb, "reconstructed," is a different matter, however, since the goal of the editorial reconstruction referred to is presumably some version of the work (not the text of some lost fragmentary document)—and therefore the required meaning of "fragment" has swung back to "work" or "poem." That the reader must continue to switch the meaning of "fragment" as the sentence progresses is a sure indication that the writer of the sentence had not carefully considered the relation of literary works to the documents that attempt to transmit them. In the remainder of the first section of his essay, de Man continues to use the archeological metaphor, speaking of " 'digging in the grounds for the new foundations' "—that is, using "history as a way to new beginnings" (p. 40). But the confusion of the opening sentence undercuts everything else: are the foundations provided by history to be thought of as the texts that survive in documents or as the works that can be derived from those documents? The latter may subsume the former, but the question is nevertheless a central one, for what it really asks is where in the process we conceive individual judgment as entering. De Man's bias is evident when he says that our "curiosity about antecedents has produced admirable philological results," allowing for "the establishment of texts whose unreliability is at least controlled by more reliable means," but that "the questions which triggered all this industry remain more than ever in suspense: What is the meaning of The Triumph of Life , of Shelley and of romanticism?" To call the philological work (that is, the scholarly editing, the "establishment" of a text) "admirable" but nevertheless mere "industry" that does not touch on the main issue of "meaning" is to suggest that textual scholarship and literary criticism are strictly separate and that the former—somehow scientific or objective—produces the materials for the latter, which engages in assessment and discrimination. There seems to be no recognition here that even the editor who wishes simply to transcribe the text of a document, to "establish" what in fact is in the document, must try to understand the context of each word and continually makes judgments that reflect one understanding or another of what message is being conveyed. The editor who does not claim to be transcribing a documentary text but who instead aims at reconstructing from it the text intended by its author is clearly making still more judgments. The two goals are distinctly different, but both rely on critical judgment. If textual criticism is thus truly "criticism," literary criticism cannot simply accept its conclusions but must examine them as part of the process of reading. 15 Attempting to understand the "meaning"—in the narrowest and the broadest senses—of a communication from the past cannot be divorced from a questioning of the words that are thought to make up that communication. De Man's handling of this point is unfortunately just what the reader would expect on the basis of the opening sentence. He actually touches on a much more illuminating line of inquiry when he asks (p. 41), "Is the status of a text [like] the status of a statue?" 16 If he had pursued this question, he might have extricated himself from his confusion, for he would have recognized that the medium of literature, unlike that of sculpture, is not tangible and that no tangible rendering of a piece of verbal communication can be the work itself. Each one is, if you will, an unearthed fragment—or, at least, possibly a fragment, because the wholeness of each document is a matter of conjecture, to say nothing of the wholeness of the work represented by its text. Instead of developing this line, however, de Man brushes it aside: "But there are more economic ways to approach this text [that is, the work called "The Triumph of Life"] and to question the possibility of establishing a relationship to Shelley and to romanticism in general." The economy of his route proves illusory in the end, for the path never again comes as close to a vista that would display the relation of language—the medium of literary art—to the documents that give it physical form. The functioning of language and reading do form the primary concern of the essay; and one must feel regretful in reading it to recognize how de Man's failure to distinguish works from texts not only weakens his argument but robs him of insights that would have reinforced the general direction his thought was already taking. "The Triumph of Life," rendered fragmentary by Shelley's death, provides him with a "mutilated textual model" exposing "the wound of a fracture that lies hidden in all texts" (p. 67). Our understanding of this wound is obscured, however, by his equating versions of works with the texts that survive in documents. This confusion is revealed early in the essay when, in introducing his discussion of the changing role of Rousseau in the poem, he speaks of the "unearthed fragments of this fragment, the discarded earlier versions" (p. 41). Versions of works are works as they stood at particular moments, and version thus exist only in the medium being employed, which in this case is language. One therefore cannot assume that the text of any document, even one in the author's hand, is a faithful representation of a given moment in the evolution of a work, for it may contain not only slips of the pen but also words and phrases already superseded in the author's mind but mechanically copied from a previous document and not altered before the new document was laid aside. To say that the "last available text" of "The Triumph of Life" was "frozen into place by Shelley's accidental death" (pp. 42-43) is true only if one takes "text" to mean "documentary text"—though there would in that case be little point in making the statement, since every documentary text is "frozen into place" by its placement in a physical object, whether or not the person who placed it there has died. But if "text" in this sentence means "text of a work" or "text of a version," as in de Man's usage it is likely to mean, the sentence cannot be true: Shelley's death cannot stop the speculation about what the text of "The Triumph of Life," or some version of it (such as the "last available" one), consists of—speculation that would have been as relevant while Shelley was alive as it is now that he is dead. The text of the work, or of versions of it, is never frozen because it is always the product of our critical judgment. Over and over again de Man speaks of the power of words, words that "cannot be isolated from the deeds they perform" (p. 49), sometimes expressing himself with eloquence: And to read is to understand, to question, to know, to forget, to erase, to deface, to repeat—that is to say, the endless prosopopoeia by which the dead are made to have a face and a voice which tells the allegory of their demise and allows us to apostrophize them in our turn. No degree of knowledge can ever stop this madness, for it is the madness of words. (p. 68) This emphasis on words underscores the necessity of questioning the makeup of whatever sequence of words we are examining; what is left unsaid here is how difficult—in the end how impossible—it is to determine what words we ought to be examining. De Man says, "In Shelley's absence, the task of thus reinscribing the disfiguration now devolves entirely on the reader" (p. 67), but his statement does not go far enough: Shelley's absence is irrelevant, and what devolves on each serious reader includes the determination of the text to be read. At the end we are told, "Reading as disfiguration, to the very extent that it resists historicism, turns out to be historically more reliable than the products of historical archeology" (p. 69). This statement would have carried more weight if it had grown out of the paradox of textual historicism: if one is interested in the text of a work as intended at a particular time by one or more of its producers, one will come nearer the goal through a critical reconstruction, based on surviving evidence and one's knowledge and judgment, than through the acceptance of any of the texts that happen to have survived in written or printed documents. This insight is not unique to textual studies, of course: it reflects a basic point of view about how we come to know, or think we know, the past. De Man was clearly attuned to this view, even if he did not think there is a past to know; but he does not, in this essay, reveal any understanding of its application to the establishment of texts. Since the essay is concerned with texts and works, with verbal productions from the past, that weakness is fatal. It may be worth turning for a moment to an essay not in Deconstruction and Criticism , for de Man's naïve conception of editorial "archeology" shows up in extreme form in his essay on "Heidegger's Exegeses of Hölderlin" originally published in French in 1955 and republished in English in 1983 (in an enlarged edition of Blindness and Insight ). 17 Because de Man was content to allow this early piece to be included, with no additional commentary, in a late book, one is perhaps justified in concluding that it may represent his view of textual scholarship throughout his career. 18 He begins the essay with a discussion of editorial matters because the reader, he believes, "must bear in mind the special circumstances of the editing and elucidation of Hölderlin's works" (p. 247). If the astonishing statement he makes soon thereafter were true, the circumstances would be special indeed: "More so than for everyone else, the reliability of his text is all important" (p. 248). 19 The 1906 Hellingrath edition of Hölderlin, the one Heidegger used, has been superseded, de Man points out, by the Beissner edition, and de Man's praise of the new edition fully reveals the thoughtlessness of his approach to textual criticism: It is one of the great achievements of modern scientific philology. By drawing upon the most proven methods (detailed study of the sources and of historical and biographical references, internal comparative references, syntactic explanations, study of formal metrics, etc.) as well as upon some modern technical processes (study of paper and writing with the aid, I am told, of slides of enlargements of the manuscript) Beissner has produced the irreproachable critical edition, something that, in the case of Hölderlin, was at once necessary and most difficult to achieve. (p. 248) If "critical editing" is "scientific," employing "proven methods" and "technical processes," then why is the result "difficult to achieve"? Perhaps the quantity of data makes the task time-consuming, but that is surely not the kind of difficulty de Man has in mind. The difficulty arises because the techniques listed as examples of "proven methods" and of "modern technical processes" all require judgment: decisions are called for at every turn. What emerges from such a critical process can be "irreproachable" only in the sense that it follows from a responsible way of proceeding. In the same sense a critical essay could be "irreproachable," but it would not necessarily be "correct" or earn universal agreement. De Man's comments show that he does not take seriously the word "critical" in "critical edition" and imagines that editors can provide objectively established texts for literary critics to exercise their judgment on. Indeed, he praises Beissner for claiming as much. But he immediately sees a drawback to this "prudent philological modesty": Beissner is "forced to leave unresolved a number of issues, including some at the level of the text establishment." So the establishment of texts does, after all, require judgment. Is it not possible, therefore, that some people will disagree with Beissner about which cruxes fall into the resolvable, and which into the unresolvable, categories? Can the literary critic ever afford to be uncritical in accepting the results of a textual investigation? De Man asserts that Heidegger decided textual questions "in the name of the internal logic of his own commentary" (p. 248), and he concludes: "it cannot be denied that the exegete capable of providing a coherent and responsible interpretation has the right, indeed the obligation, to decide according to the conclusions of his interpretation. . . . Everything rests, then, on the intrinsic value of the interpretation" (p. 249). Of course it does—for critical editors as well as "critics"—as long as the interpretation does not contradict any "facts" that can be agreed on. Editors, like everyone else interested in the past, try to establish a framework of facts not subject to interpretation (though they have exercised judgment in arriving at it) and then supplement it with interpretation. The boundary line between fact and interpretation is forever indistinct. In his naïveté about scholarly editing, de Man was not distinguishable from large numbers of his professorial colleagues.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Jacques Derrida's contribution to Deconstruction and Criticism (translated from the French by James Hulbert) is by far the longest (pp. 75-176) and occupies the center of the book through its content as well as its physical position. In it Derrida is characteristically playful, and the game he plays with the title of the piece makes any simple citation of its title inaccurate. The game is a productive one, however, leading directly to Derrida's central point—and also, in my view, illuminating a central flaw in his process of thought. The title as given in the table of contents is "LIVING ON · border lines". At first one might assume that the typographic design of this volume calls for subtitles to be placed in small capitals following a centered dot. But then one notices that the listing for the next essay, the only other one with what appears to be a subtitle, consists entirely of large capitals and has a colon between the two parts of the title. A distinction is being made, and it is made again, though less effectively, in the running titles of the two essays. The running title of the Derrida piece is "LIVING ON: Border Lines ", in which the colon rather confuses the issue; but when one sees that the running title of the next essay has the same sized capitals following its colon, one recognizes that the designer is trying to reflect the differing status of the "subtitle" in the two cases. That the words "Border Lines" are not a conventional subtitle is apparent on the first page of the essay. At the head of the essay there is only the title "Living On"; near the foot of the page (above the seventh line up from the bottom) a rule runs across the page, and the text below that rule is headed "BORDER LINES." Those two words obviously form the title of a companion piece of writing that runs along the bottom of each page of text: 20 two related compositions are proceeding simultaneously. One does not have to read far into the essay, or to know anything about Derrida's other writings, 21 to see what he is suggesting by this scheme. Since the essay concerns the breaking down of borders, limits, boundaries, he is providing the essay with an indistinct border, edging it with a layer of words, related to the essay but moving out from it—a border implying that borders are only links to something else, one border following another, moving ever outward until the whole world is encompassed. The device of a secondary essay running along the lower part of each page raises, however, some problematic questions. Is Derrida saying that his composition is a visual as well as a verbal work? Does he consider readers' constant awareness of a line across the page to be an integral part of what he is communicating? Is he creating for readers the visual experience of finding that, wherever on the page they are looking, there is text on the other side of the line as well? That is to say, if his essay were to be set in type anew for inclusion in another volume of essays, and if "Border Lines" were on this occasion printed as a block of text at the end of the main piece (in the way that footnotes in one edition of a work sometimes become endnotes in another), would the meaning of the work be altered? 22 Would the work, indeed, have become a different work? If so, how much of the present arrangement is a part of the visual form of the work? Is it essential to have 27 or 28 lines of type above the division (except where there are inset quotations) and seven below, except on the last seven pages? Must the typeface remain the same? Can one have a visual work in which some of the visual features are not integral to the work? I assume Derrida would be pleased that his piece gives rise to such questions. He would take them, I imagine, as evidence that his double composition stimulates thinking about the nature of verbal and visual art and illustrates, in this additional way, the indeterminacy of dividing lines. Perhaps it does, but only on a superficial level, for a more considered analysis of the visual aspect of the piece leads one to ask how carefully its implications have been thought through. The questions posed above are of course potentially fruitful, but here the reader raises them out of puzzlement rather than insight. The reader who has previously given thought to the nature of the medium of verbal works will begin to suspect, reading this piece, that the author's use of spatial metaphors springs more from confusion about that medium than from a constructive playfulness. Derrida says that "what used to be called a text" (p. 83) had limits that separated it from the rest of the world; but "in the last dozen or so years" these boundaries have been overrun, so that a "text"—"what I still call a 'text'" (p. 84)—is no longer to be differentiated from "everything that was to be set up in opposition to writing." The idea that verbal works shade into everything else—are parts of the world rather than statements about it—is worth exploring thoughtfully and carefully. But Derrida cannot do the concept justice because his approach to it is incoherent, as an examination of his metaphors of limits and edges will reveal. This incoherence is manifested in the shifting signification of his references to the physical boundaries of works, for these boundaries are sometimes presented as analogical and sometimes as literal. When, for example, he speaks of "the referential realm outside the frame" (p. 83), he is appropriately using a conventional metaphor to describe what he considers an outmoded way of looking at a verbal work. And he is using this metaphor in the conventional way: the "frame" is the intangible boundary that defines the beginning and ending of a work and has nothing to do with any physical frame that may or may not be present on the pages of the book containing a text of the work. Similarly, when he refers to "all those boundaries that form the running border of what used to be called a text," the "border" he has in mind is clearly not a physical one. "Border" and "frame" are metaphorical, likening something abstract to something concrete. When, in the same sentence, he mentions "margins," the word is particularly meaningful, because "margin" is the word, rather than "frame" or "border," generally used to refer to the physical boundaries of texts in books. It is still metaphorical: he is saying that just as pages of texts have margins, so verbal statements or works were formerly thought to have their edges also. The word "margins" is simply a particularly apt synonym for "boundaries" in this context. This progression of thought is shattered in the next sentence, however, when he describes the new meaning of "text" as "no longer a finished corpus of writing, some content enclosed in a book or its margins, but a differential network, a fabric of traces referring endlessly to something other than itself, to other differential traces" (p. 84). To speak of the "content" of a work being bounded by the physical dimensions of a book is not to engage in a productive analogy but to mix the two levels of the metaphor. In rejecting the notion of "some content enclosed in a book or its margins," Derrida is rejecting something that does not exist. To be sure, there are people who think of verbal works (and works in other media) as separate, in one way or another, from the rest of life; but one cannot effectively refute their position by claiming that what they see as separate is "content enclosed in a book or its margins." Perhaps some confused thinkers do fail to distinguish between verbal works, which are intangible, and the particular texts of those works conveyed to us in physical objects; but Derrida cannot possibly mount a successful argument for the boundary-less nature of verbal works if he shares with some of those he hopes of convert a misunderstanding of the relation between texts and works. The point that I believe Derrida wishes to make could be more coherently expressed as follows: "Just as books, being physical objects, have edges that mark the limits of the space they occupy, so, in the view of some people, do verbal works (of which the texts in books are evidences) have boundaries that set them off from other experience; but, as against this view, some recent thinkers have come to believe that verbal works are part of an endlessly interconnecting and all-encompassing network." Put in this way, the statement rises above the confusion of those who equate works with physical texts; indeed, it corrects their error in the process of making the more inclusive distinction between those who see verbal works as having boundaries (however they arrived at their position) and those who do not. The physical metaphor can thus enhance the argument; but Derrida's handling of it undermines the argument by revealing a conceptual flaw at the base of it. Once this problem has manifested itself, we see that it pervades the essay. The next sentence provides another particularly telling instance. Derrida says that "the text overruns all the limits assigned to it so far" and defines those limits as "everything that was to be set up in opposition to writing (speech, life, the world, the real, history, and what not, every field of reference—to body or mind, conscious or unconscious, politics, economics, and so forth)." The appearance of the word "writing" here is unfortunate. Derrida is using "writing" to mean "the kind of work normally conveyed in written form," not "the physical presentation of words," although the latter is what is suggested by the juxtaposition with "speech." But surely he would classify as "writing" a lecture delivered without notes: it would be a formal verbal composition, not conversational everyday "speech." His concern, in other words, is not with the texts that appear in particular documents but with the works they reflect; he is not claiming that the conventional view contrasts "life, the world, the real, history, and what not" with printed pieces of paper but with the contents of verbal works. Yet the blemish of using the words "writing" and "speech" is more than a temporarily misleading infelicity; it is an index of his failure to recognize the distinction between texts and works. As Derrida knows, our language will betray us in the end. A few lines later he points out that what the new approach does is "to transform the world into a library." Again, the physical metaphor reveals more than Derrida imagines, for it brings into the open a shortcoming of his own. The world is of course a "library" in that it is full of physical objects that we can "read": all artifacts can be examined for clues to their own production history and to their role in the lives of their former owners. When read in this way, books can provide information (as analytical bibliographers have shown) about the workings of printing shops and the habits of compositors, proofreaders, and press editors; and books, through their paper, typography, and format, further tell something of the social status of the authors and genres represented. But Derrida is not thinking of reading books in this way; what he means by a library is clearly a collection of works, not recognizing that what a library in fact contains is the material out of which we can attempt to reconstruct works. A library—like the world—contains physical objects; and the inked letterforms that one finds within the special objects in libraries constitute documentary texts, each of which is an attempt to report the text of a work. How successful each book text is in reflecting a work is a matter for investigation and informed judgment. Libraries do not contain authors' works in the same way that museums contain artists' works, since visual artists' works are tangible and can be contained within a physical space, whereas verbal artists' works are not tangible and can be represented physically only by instructions (the accuracy of which must always be questioned) for their reconstitution. If Derrida believes that breaking down the barriers between verbal works and the rest of life makes the whole world a library, he is using a metaphor that undercuts what he wishes to say. The problems so evident in this key passage reverberate throughout the long essay. Even when Derrida talks about variant versions of Maurice Blanchot's L'arrêt de mort (as on pp. 101-102), he concerns himself only with the meaning of "version," with the relation of versions to works, and is not led into the inextricable question of the relation of words on the page to the works they attempt to transmit. 23 One feels that he is approaching the distinction between texts and works when he cites Blanchot's statement that the "'narrative voice'" utters a work from "'the placeless place where the work is silent'" (p. 104), but he does not seize this obvious opportunity. And in the "Border Lines" he focuses on translation: "the problems that I wished to formalize above all have an irreducible relationship to the enigma, or in other words the récit , of translation" (p. 89). Pondering what translation can be thought to accomplish would naturally provide a way of embarking on a consideration of the nature of verbal works; but instead of moving from such works to their texts, Derrida moves in the opposite direction, from works to the thought lying behind them. The idea of "content" that "does not touch the borders of language" (p. 95) takes us away from the concept of work , for a work, as distinguished from thought, is tied to a medium (which can be visual, aural, verbal, and so on). Just how a body of thought, or content, is related to individual expressions of it in different media is a philosophical question worth exploring; but to do so profitably one must understand the peculiarities of the various media. If language is to be one of the media considered, there is no way to avoid dealing with the status of physical texts as intermediaries, as messengers that may at any point give us incorrect information. Derrida's essay is a richly textured meditation, remarkable in its convolutions; but what is more remarkable still is that a piece so full of word-play, so full of twists and turns and bypaths in its exploration of the nature of works, could fail to find its way to a confrontation with the ultimate indeterminacy of the texts (not just the meanings) of verbal works.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Geoffrey H. Hartman's essay ("Words, Wish, Worth: Wordsworth," pp. 177-216), the next one in the volume, makes more reference than the others to specific variants between one text of a poem and another. Hartman appends to the essay a section headed "Text of Poem and Bibliographical Note," in which he prints (with two trivial differences) the text of "' A LITTLE onward . . .'" as it appears in Ernest de Selincourt and Helen Darbishire's edition (Vol. 4 of The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth [1947], pp. 92-94). His headnote to the text is "bibliographical" only in the sense of "reference bibliography," for it cites several other critical writings either about this poem or about matters taken up in the essay; there is no discussion of such bibliographical concerns as the publication history of the poem or physical details that might bear on textual decisions. He does mention one textual variant, the allusion to Antigone rather than Dora (line 11) in editions before 1850; and in the body of his essay he mentions such other variants as some of those between the 1805 and the 1850 texts of The Prelude (e.g., pp. 198, 211). Hartman clearly takes the poem under discussion as an utterance of a particular person at a particular time in the past, and he refers to other works by the same person and recognizes the value of textual variants as evidence of a writer's developing thought. 24 It is odd, therefore, that he does not report all the textual variants in the poem, as recorded in de Selincourt and Darbishire, or comment on the textual policy of that edition. He was not obligated, of course, to present the entire text of the poem at all; but since he chose to do so for the reader's convenience, it is misleading not to have present the variants noted in the edition cited, especially when he refers to one of them. Readers might naturally conclude that there were no other variants. 25 In any case, as long as a "bibliographical note" is provided, it is strange not to have some commentary on the principles that governed the construction of the text that is being accepted. In her preface, Darbishire says, "In following Wordsworth's final text I have made a few corrections, in most cases supported by the manuscripts." 26 Although it does not appear, from the variants recorded in the 1947 edition, that any "corrections" from manuscript are incorporated into the 1947 text of the poem Hartman is discussing, there is one variant passage, identified in 1947 as "MS. corr. to text ," that raises a question about the meaning of "final text." It was incumbent on Hartman, in any event, to think about the implications for his argument of following a "final text" incorporating revisions first printed in 1820, 1827, and 1850; but no illumination on this question is afforded by the "bibliographical note." These matters bear on the primary concerns of the essay. Hartman is exploring Wordsworth's "intertextuality," the presence in his work of passages and ways of thinking influenced by his predecessors, by the "effaced or absorbed memory of other great poems" (p. 179). Going further, Hartman suggests that among the poet's "precursor text(s)" is a "primordial speech act," that indeed the "primordial wish" and the "primordial speech act . . . converge in the vision" (p. 197), that "Creation and response merge" (p. 199). Hartman is seeking the roots of poetic inspiration, in terms—growing out of the poem—that link light and sound, seeing and hearing: Wordsworth "brings the speaking darkness to light" (p. 195). The enterprise Hartman is engaged in necessitates thinking about the state of being of literary works. Any meditation on the shift "from visionary voice to visionary text" (p. 202)—a shift that is "part of a vast metaphoric activity identifiable with creative power itself"—must reflect some attitude regarding the mode of existence of verbal works and postulate some relationship between those works and the texts whereby we approach them. Hartman is trying to understand the act of reading in the broadest sense, the "reading" that poets perform and our own "reading" of those poets: "Wordsworth's poem suggests that we must read the writer as a reader" (p. 187). The immediate object of "reading" is "texts" (whether verbal or nonverbal), but how we define "texts" is the crux of the matter and will in turn affect how we conceive of "reading." Hartman's seeming lack of inquisitiveness about the production and status of the de Selincourt-Darbishire text—about how those two editors had read Wordsworth—is indicative of his broader failure to come to grips with the relation of texts to works in his own reading of Wordsworth, which is to say in his interpretation of Wordsworth's reading. The problem becomes evident as we follow the word "text" through his argument. It first occurs in the opening paragraph, where Hartman discusses the initial image of the poem, the link between Wordsworth walking with Dora and the blind Oedipus being led by Antigone. The poet, Hartman says, is surprised by this association, "the usurpation of that text on his voice, and the anticipatory, proleptic nature of the thought." This linking of "text" and "thought" is revealing, for "text" here is similar to a thought that has been influenced by a reading of a text in the past. The referent of "text" is literally the quotation that constitutes the first two lines of the poem, but the intended meaning is evidently not a specific documentary text but any text of Samson Agonistes —or, perhaps more accurately, the experience of having read these lines of Samson Agonistes (and, in turn, Sophocles) in some text. Shortly thereafter he associates the word "quotation" with "voice" and an echo: imagination, he says, has risen "in the form of a voice, the quotation from Samson Agonistes —echoing back to Oedipus at Colonus " (p. 178). The "quotation," like the "text," refers to a passage in a work, not the words that happen to be in one or another specific text of the work. The question of how we find our way to the work from the signals available to us, of the problematic nature of the connections between texts and works, is not broached. At least we think we have learned from the opening paragraphs how "text" is being used, even if a fundamental question is being overlooked at the same time. And our observation is confirmed by the immediately ensuing occurrences of the word: "a text surfacing in his [Wordsworth's] mind" (p. 180), "a well-known text flashing on the poet's mind" (p. 181), even "a famous text from Wordsworth's own poetry" (p. 183). In all these instances "text" means a passage from a work. But whether it can still mean the same thing in Hartman's conclusion to his third section is arguable: "An unmediated psychic event," he says, "turns out to be a mediated text: words made of stronger words, of the Classics and the Bible" (p. 186). Inner feelings or responses become "texts" to be read, and in the process they turn into actual verbal texts, arrangements of words, which are influenced by previous verbal works that have entered one's repertory of thought patterns. This description of a particular succession of mental events conceives of "text" in at least three ways: as something nonverbal to be interpreted, or "read"; as a passage from a verbal work of the past; and as a specific sequence of words and pauses (or punctuation) that one constructs from the other two kinds of text. The first involves—continuing the metaphor—"documentary" evidence, for one must accept as a given the particular combination of elements one is faced with. The second, though it is recalled as an individual series of words, is not perceived as the text of a specific document, with its own idiosyncrasies, but as the text of a linguistic work, which has its existence in some realm apart from the mundane realities of paper and ink or even of sound waves. The third, the new composition, is—what? Not really a third conceptual type, for how could it be something other than the text of a document or the text of a work abstracted from one or more documents? But which is it? Hartman's vagueness here will be noted only by those who have thought about the difference between texts of documents and texts of works. It is regrettable that Hartman does not appear to be among those, since his interest is in the nature of verbal works and their mediating role in our perceptions: his account, for all its richness, appears naïve as a result of being divorced from this basic distinction. Recognizing how documents and works differ is essential to an understanding of reading, and much of his essay is concerned with the process of reading. He begins his fourth section by asserting, "The relation of 'text' and 'soul' is the province of a theory of reading" (p. 186). This statement takes on different meanings depending on whether "text" refers to the text of a document or the text of a work. The former connects us to "soul" by showing us the humanity of the producer or producers of the document, whether it is a manuscript in the hand of the author (or scribe) or a printed book set in type by a compositor. Documents always contain evidences of the striving of their producers; but the human dramas preserved in them may be a number of steps removed from the minds underlying the works that are reflected (however accurately or inaccurately) in the texts of the documents. The text of a work, on the other hand, links us directly to the "soul" of the author, and presumably it is the reading of texts of works that Hartman has in mind. But where do we find such texts? We can never know when we have found them; all we can do is approach them through the texts of the documents that seem intended to convey them. We will therefore be constantly questioning those documentary texts, for at any point they may be misleading guides. The process of reading leads us along an intricate path in which at each point we must confront the mysteries of physical objects before we can hope to recover the messages they seem to offer us. "Text" and "soul" are indeed connected, but Hartman's account is grossly oversimplified through its failure to address the relation of physical texts and verbal messages. We may readily agree that authors bring "an inner light" to the "texts" they read and that their reading is "a form of life" (p. 187). But when we are told that the "inner voice also proves to be a text"—in this case "the textual voice of Milton" (p. 188)—are we not bound to aks for a more precise account of where that particular arrangement of words, now in the poet's mind, came from? Must we not confront the process by which one or more texts on paper become transmuted into a text in the mind, a text that is perhaps identical with one of those on paper, perhaps a conflation of them, and perhaps different in various respects from all of them? And what relation do all these texts have to the work as intended by its author? If poetry is "the working through of voices," if a poet experiences a "latent pressure of voices or texts" (p. 191), if "the usurping voice is referred to a specific text" (p. 193), we had better inquire into this process. Even though Hartman uses the phrase "a specific text," he clearly means "a specific work," not "a specific text of a work." When he speaks of "the relation between textuality and referentiality" (p. 193) and says that poetry "textualizes a phantom voice" (p. 194), that it is "echo humanized" (p. 195), and that the poet "brings the speaking darkness to light" (p. 195), he is concerning himself with the creation of a verbal work out of experiences that have themselves been affected by prior verbal works; but he is not even touching the equally profound mystery of where verbal communications have their being, of the ontology of works made of words. 27 One could argue that it does not matter whether different people are influenced by different texts of Milton (texts as previously read or as created in the mind through the unconscious, but perhaps willful, tricks of memory); all that matters, one might say, is that their responses to the world are affected by prior groupings of words. 28 This approach could certainly be defended, but "Milton" would then not be a biographical reference, and the use of the term "Milton" would raise anew the question of the relation between ideas and each separate grouping of words employed to express them—that is, the relation between "referentiality" and "textuality," the very question that Hartman is attempting to explore. A coherent discussion of this question cannot escape the requirement of facing the problems inherent in defining "textuality," in segregating the two strands that make it up. If we are to understand how Wordsworth's experience on Snowdon "includes the poet as reader of a prior and sacred text" (p. 196) and how Wordsworth "has created his own text by a verbal geometry that extends the lines of force in a prior scripture" (p. 197), we have to explore how "lines of force" emanate from specific sequences of words and how varying sequences of words can be related to each other in such a way as to be encompassed by the singular term "scripture." Hartman apparently uses "text" to mean written, as opposed to spoken, words, for he takes a stand in the debate over which are primary by saying that critics should understand "how texts eclipse voice and speak silence" (p. 207). Yet he seems to see no awkwardness in letting "texts" also mean the "scriptures" or "poems" that transcend the limitation of particular documents. In a key passage of his peroration he asserts that the work of Wordsworth's under discussion is "both a minor poem and a considerable text " (p. 213); but this statement does not mean that he has come around, however belatedly, to distinguishing texts of documents from texts of works. (What would a "considerable" text, in that sense, be?) He is saying that this poem does not conform to his criteria for great art but that it is an interesting example of intertextuality as an "undersong" to intratextuality. The "considerable text " here is a poem treated as a biographical document, without reference to the physical documents that provide our evidence for reconstructing it. Hartman, however, equates the two levels: "There is no authentically temporal discourse, no timely utterance, except by resolute acts of writing. . . . Writing . . . defers utterance of the definitive parole or password—from generation to generation" (p. 207). The actual situation is more poignant: the preparation of written or printed texts gives a verbal work its best chance of surviving; but what survives on pieces of paper consists of the accidents of particular historical moments, and the work that speaks to us across the generations will forever be a conjecture arising from those time-bound, vulnerable objects. Hartman's account of the creative process, and of the relation of literary works to sound and to time, cannot but seem thin compared to what it would have been if these fundamental considerations had been a part of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V The final piece in Deconstruction and Criticism , J. Hillis Miller's "The Critic as Host" (pp. 217-253), is explicitly an apologia for deconstruction, taking as its basic metaphor the reciprocal, reversible relationship between parasite and host and offering, through an analysis of Shelley, "an 'example' of the word 'parasite' functioning parasitically within the 'body' of work by one author" (p. 232). Despite the quotation marks around "body," the essay displays no awareness of any problems surrounding the determination of what words constitute the texts of the works to be discussed. Even a reference to a clause in "one of the drafts of the preface" (p. 239) to Epipsychidion does not serve to open the subject of variant wording and what it implies about the nature of verbal works. 29 In the next sentence we are referred to "the poem itself"—the "itself" being presumably intended to emphasize the distinction between poem and preface but also implying, in the context of the essay, that there is no question about what "the poem itself" is. For Miller, the word "text" is a simple synonym for "work" or "poem." He begins a sentence, for example, by saying, "The poem, like all texts, is . . ." (p. 226). He speaks of critical essays and "the texts they treat" (p. 226), of "such a text" as Shelley's "The Triumph of Life," 30 of "all the great texts of Western metaphysics" (p. 228), of "any text in Western literature" (p. 248). In describing the parasitical relationship between a poem and earlier poems, he says, "The new poem both needs the old texts and must destroy them" (p. 225); he refers to "the encapsulation in the poem of echoes and references to a long chain of previous texts" (p. 232); and thus, when he comments on "the relation of the poem to previous and later texts" (p. 233), he does not mean "previous and later texts of that poem" but "previous and later poems." The shift from "poem" to "text" is apparently for the sake of verbal variety; if Miller's point were that poets are influenced by particular texts of previous poems, he would have to say something more about the independent existence of individual documents as physical objects, as well as to recognize that the text of the poem under discussion is just as problematical as the texts of those earlier poems. But this issue is obviously not in his mind. When he is totaling the number of appearances of "parasite" in Shelley, he arrives at the figure of seven "if one counts The Daemon of the World and The Revolt of Islam as separate texts" (p. 247): "texts" here can only mean "works." The essays that critics write, being works, are also called "texts," as in "the asymmetrical relation of critical text to poem" (p. 224). Some readers, familiar with scholarly editions that present critical texts (texts that incorporate emendations resulting from the editors' critical judgments), may at first think that Miller is posing the question of the relation of such critical texts to the poems or works as they may be thought to exist independently of their transcription in particular documents. This question would perhaps be more interesting than the one he has chosen to discuss; in any case there is no doubt that "critical text" here means "an essay by a literary critic." In the other essays in this volume the use of "text" to mean "work" produces ambiguity, for "text" sometimes seems to convey two meanings in passages that will not support both. There is no such ambiguity in Miller's essay, where—purely and simply—"text" equals "work." But this lack of ambiguity is no compliment to Miller, for through it his essay reflects so great a removal from any thought of textual matters that the two words are never even tinged by an underlying recognition of such issues. He does provide some endnotes citing the editions from which his quotations are drawn, and in them he twice uses "text" to mean the particular arrangements of words in those editions; "works" could not be substituted for "texts" in these instances. But neither this conventional use of "text" nor his reference to the previous publication of part of his essay "in a preliminary form" causes him to pay attention to the variability of texts. He is free, of course, to use "text" and "work" as synonyms in the body of his essay if he chooses; but what he must then do, and does not, is to find some other way of referring to what has traditionally been referred to by the word "text." That he does not refer to texts in this sense at all has serious consequences for his discussion. At the beginning, for example, he quotes a comment from an essay by M. H. Abrams, a comment in which Abrams in turn quotes from Wayne Booth. Miller then asks, "What happens when a critical essay extracts a 'passage' and 'cites' it? Is this different from a citation, echo, or allusion within a poem?" And he proceeds to ask whether the relationship between the quotation and the surrounding words is like that between parasite and host, and, if so, which is the parasite and which the host. All these are important questions—indeed, questions that go to the heart of the nature of texts and works. But Miller does not do them justice, since he does not treat the textual basis of them. He does not—to put it another way—give evidence of recognizing that quotations are mini-editions, raising all the questions about "establishing" texts that are raised by editions of the texts of whole works. Whatever "quoting" means is what "preparing an edition" or "determining a text" means. There is a whole spectrum of standards that can be applied to these activities, and Miller sensibly mentions "citation," "echo," and "allusion" in this connection. They—like "paraphrase," "influence," and so on—are all forms of reference to other works, forms in which different standards of textual accuracy are appropriate. But accuracy to what? This is the central question, regardless of which genre of reference one is employing. Echoes, allusions, and paraphrases are not expected to have the same accuracy to something outside themselves that a quotation has; but their tenor, their general drift, their evocative effect, will nevertheless depend on the details of the text of that outside thing. (The point is not altered by the fact that some writers do not wish to be accurate, intending their paraphrases or quotations to be distorted to serve a particular purpose: they are still responding to what they believe some outside text to be.) If writers who quote from other writers (or refer in another way to them) accept unquestioningly the texts of particular editions (or the texts in their minds based on the reading of particular editions), they are actually referring—whatever they may think—only to documents, not to writers; and anyone reading their writings must try to understand their handling of citations as part of the process of understanding what they are saying. The first answer—preliminary to any other—to the question "What happens when a critical essay extracts a 'passage' and 'cites' it?" is that the quoter either understands or misunderstands the relation of texts to works. In pursuing the question of quoting, however, Miller ignores this issue and moves into an etymological analysis of words (like "parasite") beginning with "para-," which is a "double antithetical prefix," signifying many sets of opposites. Each "para-" word "may seem to choose univocally one of these possibilities," but "the other meanings are always there as a shimmering in the word which makes it refuse to stay still in a sentence" (p. 219). His examination finds in the "little piece of language" that Abrams quotes from Booth (which includes the word "parasitical") "context after context widening out from these few phrases to include as their necessary milieux all the family of Indo-European languages, all the literature and conceptual thought within those languages, and all the permutations of our social structures of household economy, gift-giving and gift-receiving" (p. 223). In this way the quotation grows like a parasite; but the surrounding essay is also parasitical on the earlier one. This relationship, Miller asserts, is true of all quotations or allusions in all verbal works, poems as well as essays. He presents this analysis as "an 'example' of the deconstructive strategy of interpretation" (p. 223), as "a model . . . for the incoherence within a single critic's language" or "within any single literary text" (p. 224). Deconstruction thus uncovers the "equivocal richness" inherent in verbal expression. The absence, in this introductory exposition of deconstructive procedure, of any recognition of the difference between texts and works forces one to consider again, perhaps from a new angle, the much-discussed question of the relation of deconstruction to historical study. Textual criticism, as traditionally understood, is a historical enterprise; whether its focus in a given instance is an author's intention or the combined intention of a collaborative group (author, author's friend, publisher, and so on), its goal is the construction of texts of works as intended at some point in the past. The texts in surviving documents form the most important class of evidence for such reconstruction. When, instead of using those texts critically as evidence for textual reconstruction, one accepts them uncritically, one is abandoning any concern with intention. But one may still approach them with a historical interest, for those documentary texts were available to be read in the past and are therefore evidence for examining past readers' responses. One need not, of course, be interested in history at all, in which case one text is as good as another to provide a sequence of words for analysis—though the fact that a particular sequence of words comes from the past in then of no significance, and the sequence could just as well be devised by the critic. These logical possibilities emerge clearly once the text-work relationship is understood; but since Miller does not deal with that relationship, it is not surprising that his position in regard to these basic possibilities is unclear. Words do have their genealogies, both etymological and associative; and it is not only the words of quotations that are importations into a work but, as Miller understands, all the words making up the work, for all are outsiders with their own histories. If, as a result, works (or individual texts of them) are "incoherent" (cf. p. 224), "unreadable" (p. 226), and "self-subversive" (cf. p. 228) in that they contain the basis for contradictory interpretations, one would assume that this universal condition either (1) eliminates any useful interest in what human beings have attempted to express in words or (2) can itself be eliminated, as a given, in order to focus on what human beings have attempted to say in spite of it. At times Miller seems to be leading toward the former view, as when he cites "the law that language is not an instrument or tool in man's hands, a submissive means of thinking," and concludes, "Language rather thinks man and his 'world,' including poems" (p. 224). This "triumph of language" (p. 233) would seem to make irrelevant any interest in the authorial intention behind certain sequences of words; how the words came to be combined would be of no significance. One text would serve as well for analysis as another—but there would still be textual decisions to make, for there would be no reason why any pre-existing sequence of words had to be kept intact, and critics would be free to alter any words they wished. Quoted texts would then be entirely swallowed up in the new context: commentary and subject would completely coalesce. Such a position would be a tenable one, if carried through in this way. But, despite the similarity of the conclusion to Miller's host-parasite concept, this is not the position Miller takes. It is revealing that, when Miller says, "Language . . . thinks man and his 'world,'" he adds, "if he will allow it to do so" (p. 224). That man has any choice in the matter is an unexpected revelation, and how it can be is not clear. Of course, our world is what we decide it is; but Miller's "law"—"the law that language is not an instrument or tool in man's hands" (p. 224)—is presumably independent of our wishes, and language has had its way with us even if we think we did not "allow it to do so." In any case, contrary to what would seem to be consistent with the framework Miller sets up at the beginning, he continually refers to works and texts as the products of individual human beings, especially in the last three sections of his essay, where he is concerned with "the 'body' of work by one author" (p. 232), Shelley. Why should an analysis of the implications of the word "parasite" in various contexts stop at the boundary separating work by Shelley from other verbal work, unless there is an interest in seeing how this one human mind struggled with the difficulties of expressing ideas in language? If that is indeed the interest, then the focus has shifted from the helplessness of man in "the prisonhouse of language" (p. 230) to the intended meanings of individuals as they attempt to express themselves in spite of the obstacles thrown up by words with ancient heritages. And further, if that is the case, one must try to reconstruct, from the documentary texts that have come down to us, the texts intended by their authors—for there is no point linking two works on the grounds that they are by the same author unless one has made an effort to ascertain the author's intended texts of those works. Fleetingly Miller seems to sense the impasse he has placed himself in. He asks, "Who, however, is 'Shelley'? To what does this word refer if any work signed with this name has no identifiable borders, and no interior walls either?" (p. 243). It is crucial for his argument to deal with this question, but he does not do so satisfactorily. He does not even explain appositely why Shelley's work (or anyone else's) may be thought to have "no identifiable borders": "It has no edges," he says, "because it has been invaded from all sides as well as from within by other 'names,' other powers of writing." But if those other "names" possess "other powers of writing," they are individuals who have placed their own stamp on intractable language; presumably Shelley's use of them would make them an element in his own personal "power of writing." The real reason that a writer's words could be considered to have no borders is that they are simply fragments of language, part of the immense mass of arrangements of words from the past. If we are interested in language as the driving force, and not the individuals who have used it (or been used by it), we have no reason to notice "authors." Miller does not make this point here; he places Shelley's name in quotation marks three times (p. 243), then refers to him for a page or so as "the poet" (which does not avoid the problem), then once more puts the name in quotation marks (p. 245), and then the troublesome question of why he is discussing Shelley as an individual slips away, unanswered. Miller's essay is thus incoherent in argument, which is a different kind of incoherence from the one he finds in all verbal works. That one may distinguish two levels of coherence or incoherence is implied by Miller's own treatment of Shelley, for he does not regard Shelley as confused, even if Shelley's poetry, containing the contradictions and "blind alleys" (p. 230) embedded in language, must inevitably be "the record of a perpetually renewed failure" (p. 237). Miller's concern is, finally, biographical, a concern with the dignity and pathos of Shelley as a human being who, like all artists, attempted to reproduce in some lasting form outside his mind the sense of life that existed within it. In the case of literature, that lasting form is intangible and can only be brought to our attention through the second-hand reports of documents or of oral recitations; Miller's neglect of this situation is the basis of the incoherence of his essay. Of Shelley's "failure," he says, "The words, however, always remain, there on the page, as the unconsumed traces of each unsuccessful attempt to use words to end words" (p. 237). The words on paper are indeed the evidence of a human struggle—that of the producer of the document (whether author, scribe, or printer) to transmit a text accurately. But the work of poetry is not "there on the page." 31 Miller presents deconstruction as "simply interpretation as such" (p. 230), "analytic criticism as such" (p. 252), 32 because it deals with the fundamental nature of language. His account, however, overlooks something no less fundamental: that verbal works are not coequal with their representations in tangible form. This oversight causes him to confuse the deconstruction of particular texts with the deconstruction of authors' works and, as a result, to write an unpersuasive brief for deconstruction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI A strong case for deconstructive criticism can be made, and anyone who has given careful thought to the implications of the distinction between texts of documents and texts of works could make a stronger one than any presented by the five writers in Deconstruction and Criticism . It is remarkable that a group of critics so preoccupied with theoretical matters should have failed to include in their discussions some recognition of the difference between the stationary arts (like painting and sculpture), which use tangible media, and the sequential arts (like literature and music), which use intangible media and which can therefore be preserved only through instructions for their repetition. My comments here do not constitute a criticism of deconstruction but rather a criticism of five essays that, in their various ways, reflect some of the attitudes of deconstruction. What I hope has become clear is that the traditional concerns of textual criticism help to clarify the issues that deconstructive critics must face. Those who have been called textual critics and those called literary critics are alike in making critical judgments about literary works. All of them must follow, explicitly or implicitly, a theory of literature, and any theory of literature must take into account the implications arising from the intangibility of the medium of literature. One may choose to be interested or uninterested in history, but one must recognize how the medium of literature requires, in either case, that textual decisions be made. Language, like the other parts of what we think of as the world we inherited, can indeed be treacherous and unaccommodating. So, for that matter, is the nervous system through which we hope to assert our existence. But whatever we attempt to express, in one medium or another, is a historical fact, a part of the record of human sentience. Even if language always subverts what we think we have to say, we persist in selecting certain words rather than others, and arranging them in one order rather than another, in our effort to communicate—or even to assert that there is not or should not be such a thing as communication. Whenever we wish to examine an effort of this kind from the past, we are forced by the nature of verbal transmission to include in our deliberations a questioning of the accuracy of the available texts that claim to represent it, and to accept as well the consequent possibility of altering those texts. When, on the other hand, we do not wish to receive groupings of words as evidence of previous human expression, we are then not inhibited by any historical argument from altering those words or their arrangement so that they seem more pleasing or effective or interesting to us. Either way, we have to consider making alterations in what has been passed down to us; either way, there is no coherent argument for considering inherited texts as inviolable. Critics who fail to question the constitution of documentary texts cannot argue convincingly for either of these approaches, and indeed are likely to confuse the two. Deconstruction raises questions about the role of history in human discourse, and it must therefore assess the historical status of preserved texts—the tenuous relation of the texts of artifacts to verbal communication—if it is to offer a satisfying model of human thinking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 An indication of the new prominence of the word "text" is offered by the announcement in the Chronicle of Higher Education (in an article by Scott Heller on 3 August 1988) that "A faculty committee at Syracuse recently approved a plan to change the name of the major to English and Textual Studies" (p. A16). 2 I have discussed these issues at greater length in my Rosenbach Lectures of 1987, published as A Rationale of Textual Criticism (1989). 3 A convenient listing of other writings by four of the five authors (all but Derrida) is Wallace Martin's "Bibliography" in The Yale Critics: Deconstruction in America , ed. Jonathan Arac, Wlad Godzich, and Wallace Martin (1983), pp. 203-212. Extensive lists of the literature of the subject are provided by Josué V. Harari at the end of his anthology Textual Strategies: Perspectives in Post-Structuralist Criticism (1979) and by Richard Barney in a supplement to the Reports of the Society for Critical Exchange, No. 8 (Fall 1980). Two useful introductory surveys are Jonathan Culler's On Deconstruction (1982) and Vincent B. Leitch's Deconstructive Criticism (1983). 4 In The Anxiety of Influence (1973) he speaks only of "poems"; in A Map of Misreading (1975) he frequently uses "texts" as well. 5 In A Map of Misreading he says that "there are no texts, but only relationships between texts" (p. 3). 6 Such texts exist, that is, to the extent that we admit the existence of external objects or external simuli. 7 That is, what would be considered errors by the author of the work transmitted in a given document or by one or more of the producers of the document. 8 Bloom's first inset quotation on p. 30 contains the phrase "on a rock", the reading of the 1975 book text (p. 73, line 24); the magazine text reads "up on a rock" ( Poetry , 124 [1974], 252, line 22). 9 Even with the extra division, the magazine text would appear to most readers to have only six verse-paragraphs, for one of the divisions in the book text, after "To get to sleep tonight, at least until late" (p. 75, line 3), coincides with a page break in the magazine (p. 253), where there is no typographic indication that a break in the poem also occurs. Does a break in fact occur there? Perhaps Ashbery decided later to make a break there—or perhaps the space in the book text is an error. And could the failure of the book text to have the earlier break (after "Its hollow perfectly") also be an error? Does the poem have six or seven sections, and, if six, where do they occur? 10 Bloom's quotation at the bottom of p. 35 contains the phrase "This sample"; but both the 1974 text (p. 256, line 10) and the 1975 (p. 77, line 18) read "The sample". (At several points he cites line numbers, which are not provided in 1974 or 1975 for this 552-line poem.) 11 Certainly the word "amazament" in 1975 (p. 74, line 10) is a typographical error (the word is "amazement" in 1974, p. 253, line 8). 12 And can one really call the location of paragraph breaks a trivial matter? Or consider the shift from "emerge out of" to "issue from" and the addition of "with Pierre" trivial changes in poetic lines? (In the 1975 edition, these occur, respectively, on p. 74, line 13, and p. 75, line 10; in 1974, p. 253, line 11, and p. 254, line 7.) 13 The wording of his note is strange, however: after citing Donald H. Reiman's Shelley's "The Triumph of Life": A Critical Study (1965) as his source, he says, "Together with G. M. Matthews' edition . . ., this edition is authoritative." In fact, his quotations do not correspond in every respect to the Reiman text: all the lines in his quotations are printed flush left, whereas in Reiman alternating lines are indented; no italics appear in his quotations (except at a few points where he notes " emphasis added "), whereas in Reiman there are a number of italicized words and phrases; and the word "and" is spelled out and certain American spellings occur in de Man's quotations, whereas in Reiman the ampersand and British spellings are used. At some points de Man's quotations follow Matthews's edition or the first edition ( Posthumous Poems , 1824) instead of Reiman's, but without any pattern: thus on p. 54, the capital letter in "Shape" (line 352) and the lower-case initial in "dawn" (line 353) correspond not to Reiman but to both Matthews and the first edition; the lowercase initial of "earth" (line 353) corresponds to Reiman and the first edition, not Matthews; but on p. 52 the capital letter in "Shape" (line 425) corresponds only to Matthews and not to Reiman or the first edition. (Whether or not such words are capitalized is obviously a matter of some significance.) At one point, de Man's text even follows Harry Buxton For-man's 1876-77 edition in a reading that, as Reiman points out (p. 161), "has no foundation": on p. 46, de Man's quotation of line 187 reads "the holes he vainly sought to hide" instead of "the holes it . . . ." Furthermore, there are places where de Man's quotations do not match any text cited in Reiman's notes: e.g., "the" is inserted in line 33, which is quoted (on p. 52) as "O'er the evening hills . . ."; "the" is omitted from line 353, which is quoted (on p. 54) as "Dew on earth . . ."; and "the' 'is substituted for "one" in line 367, which is quoted (on p. 72) as "As the enamoured . . . ." Whether or not one regards these differences as significant is beside the point: de Man says unequivocally, "All quotations from The Triumph of Life are from the critical edition established by Donald H. Reiman." Their presence, however, does reinforce the point that the texts of documents must always be questioned. 14 If he does, the sentence, lacking the word "other," is not well phrased (it could begin, "Like several other major works of the English romantics"). 15 In good scholarly editions, much of the information necessary for assessing the editors' decisions is provided in apparatus. An accurate apparatus could be called "definitive" in regard to the information it aims to record; but no critical text based on it can be called "definitive" because no such text can embody all the responsible judgments that are possible. 16 I have placed "like" in brackets because the word in the printed text is "line." It seems unlikely that de Man meant to say "Is the status of a text line the status of a statue?", for a "text line" would seem to mean a unit or building block of a text and would therefore not be parallel with "statue," a whole work. The matter must remain uncertain, however—as, indeed, the constitution of all texts of works is uncertain. This typographical error, if it is that, illustrates the necessity for deciding on the makeup of the text as a part of the act of reading. It also shows how documents can be unreliable witnesses to past intentions, even though we can never know with certainty the precise extent of that unreliability. 17 This essay, in a translation by Wlad Godzich, was one of the pieces added to Blindness and Insight (originally published in 1971) for its second edition in 1983 (pp. 246-266). The original essay, "Les Exégèses de Hölderlin par Martin Heidegger," appeared in Critique 100/101 (septembre/octobre 1955), 800-819. 18 One must note, however, what he says in the foreword to the enlarged edition: "I have left all these texts exactly as they were first published and have made no attempt to update them or to make them more germane to present-day discussions about literary theory —also when, as is the case in the essay on Derrida, I am myself aware of inadequacies with which I have tried to cope elsewhere" (p. xi). I have not yet discovered a place where he revises the view of editing expressed here. 19 In the original French, the statement reads, "pour lui plus que pour tout autre, la correction du texte importe grandement" (p. 802). 20 This title in the original French, we are told on p. 82, is "Journal de bord." 21 He had earlier dealt with similar matters in, for example, the prefatory section of La Dissemination (1972); trans. Barbara Johnson, 1981). 22 At many points in "Border Lines" he calls it a "band" (e.g., pp. 77, 89, 90) and refers to it or the main essay in spatial terms: "a procession underneath the other one" (p. 78), "here, at the foot of the other text" (p. 87), "the upper band" (p. 91), "the procession above" (p. 98). 23 In a related passage Derrida comments on the "double narrative" of L'arrêt de mort in terms of physical presentation. He lists "binding" as one of the conventionally enclosing features of "the framed unity of the corpus" in literature; this particular verbal work in two parts is being held together, within a physical binding, at "an invisible hinge . . . (the space between the last sentence of the first récit and the first of the second)" (p. 142). In the first of Blanchot's two versions of this work, Derrida says, there was a second blank space separating the second récit from a kind of epilogue; but in the second version there is "only one blank space in the typography of the book, between the two récits ," and this space takes on "an even more remarkable singularity" (p. 144). This space occurs "at the bottom of one page and at the top of another"—so that "after the narrator has said, 'What is extraordinary begins at the moment I stop. But I am no longer able to speak of it,' on the next page, the facing page, the other shore, truth enters—thematically, and by name" (pp. 144-145). But if part of the meaning connecting the two récits is being expressed by the page-break that allows two particular passages to face each other on facing pages, the work is then a work of visual as well as verbal art. Derrida does not, however, proceed to examine the problem of treating spatial arrangements as an element in an intangible work, as if verbal works were in fact tangible and existed on paper. If they did, there would be nothing wrong with thinking of bindings, or page-breaks, as unifying elements of such works. Derrida does not seem to see that his questioning of "the entire conventional system of legalities that organizes, in literature, the framed unity of the corpus" (p. 142) is linked with an unquestioning acceptance of a conventional misconception about the location of verbal works. 24 Hartman had earlier made a statement about the value of studying revisions, in "Retrospect 1971" prefixed to the 1971 printing of his book Wordsworth's Poetry 1787-1814 (originally published in 1964): "Perhaps Wordsworth never did emerge to an assured sense of self or a decisive poetry. There is something peculiar in the way his text corrupts itself: the freshness of earlier versions is dimmed by scruples and qualifications, by revisions that usually overlay rather than deepen insight. I should have paid some attention to this problem but was more interested, I now see, in the integrity of the mind than in that of the single poem" (p. xvii). Hartman's choice of the verb "corrupts" recalls the standard jargon of textual criticism, in which a textual "corruption" is an unauthorized "reading" (a word or phrase or mark of punctuation) that occurs in a particular documentary text; but Hartman's belief that Wordsworth's "text corrupts itself" refers to something else—to a poem becoming in some ways less satisfactory, in Hartman's view, as Wordsworth revises it. In the process of analyzing revised versions to come to this conclusion, one still needs to assess the texts of those versions to try to eliminate "textual corruptions" (in the traditional sense) from them. Hartman's explanation of his previous neglect of revisions—that he was more interested "in the integrity of the mind than in that of the single poem"—seems not to recognize that revisions form a significant part of the evidence for examining "integrity" of mind, and that therefore one must ask whether the documentary texts of each revision reflect the author's intentions at that stage. 25 A footnote on the first page of the essay tells the reader that "the entire text of the poem" appears at the end. The text printed Americanizes the punctuation of line 31 (placing a comma within quotation marks) and modernizes the spelling of "recal" in line 43 (to "recall"), without comment. However, it accurately reproduces "Holy writ" in line 51 (and in the quotation of the passage on p. 181), without noting that in the 1958 printing of the de Selincourt and Darbishire edition (printed "from corrected sheets of the first [i.e., 1947] edition") the initial letter of "writ" is capitalized. 26 Hartman cites the edition as that of de Selincourt only, not mentioning Darbishire at all; but she is named on the title page as co-editor, and she signed the preface, which—as in this sentence on the editing—uses the first person singular pronoun. Her reference to "following Wordsworth's final text" is in line with the policy set forth in the first volume of the edition (1940), where de Selincourt says that he follows Wordsworth's collected edition of 1849-50, "the last to appear under his personal supervision." 27 Even his few references to versions—e.g., "Wordsworth's manuscript revisions" (p. 196) and the "1805 version" (p. 200)—do not serve to bring up the issue. 28 That is, in speaking of "the usurping memory of Milton's text" (p. 204), one is emphasizing "memory" over "text"—or "text" as a framework of ideas, not a specific arrangement of words. 29 He does cite in endnotes the sources of his quotations; but inaccuracies in quoting provide unintended illustrations of the distinction between works and documents. The most striking question raised by his quotations concerns the word "uncanniest" in his quotation (p. 227) from the Kluback-Wilde translation (1958) of Heidegger's The Question of Being —a word that he proceeds to use several times in his discussion following the quotation. In the original printing of this bilingual edition, published in New York by Twayne Publishers, the word at this point is "strangest" (p. 37); and the translators comment on this translation of "unheimlichste" in brackets in the previous sentence (where the word also occurs): "the word unheimlich here signifies not having a home." Miller cites a later printing of this edition ("New Haven, Conn.: College &amp; University Press, 1958" [the "1958" presumably occurring in the copyright notice]); but, since the currently available printing (with the same imprint that Miller cites) also has the reading "strangest", it seems unlikely that the copy Miller used had a different reading. Perhaps, instead, the change from "strangest" to "uncanniest" in Miller's quotation somehow springs from his knowing the association of "uncanny" and "unheimlich" in translations of and commentaries on Freud. (Cf. Miller's later citation of Freud's "The Uncanny" in his chapter " Wuthering Heights : Repetition and the 'Uncanny'" in Fiction and Repetition [1982], p. 69 and note 6 on pp. 236-237.) For a discussion of Freud's essay on "The Uncanny" and translations of "unheimlich," see Karl Kroeber, Romantic Fantasy and Science Fiction (1988), p. 90 (and the references on pp. 176-177, note 13). 30 Three of the five essays discuss this poem, reflecting (as Hartman explains in the preface) "an earlier scheme" to concentrate on Shelley (and presumably on this poem). 31 Another instance of this phrase in Miller's writing occurs in the chapter on Wuthering Heights in Fiction and Repetition (1982): "Words no different from those we use in everyday life . . . may . . . go on functioning as the creators of the fictive world repeated into existence, . . . whenever the act of reading those words is performed. The words themselves, there on the page, both presuppose the deaths of that long line of personages and at the same time keep them from dying wholly, as long as a single copy of Wuthering Heights survives to be reread" (p. 72). Such a reference to words "there on the page" also presupposes that the literary work exists on the page; but what happens to be present in a given copy (such as the "single copy" that might be the sole surviving copy) may not in every respect perpetuate the "fictive world" that was in the author's mind. A somewhat more sophisticated reference to words on a page appears in Miller's The Linguistic Moment (1985): the linguistic moment in Wallace Stevens, we are told, is "when language almost emerges as surd, not sign, becomes almost a material substance, almost sounds or marks on a page, almost blanched, drenched, drained of meaning" (p. 14). When words on a page take on this status, they are being approached as visual art; but the issue of what words (or "marks") ought to be there, and what standard should be employed in answering that question, is still completely avoided. 32 In The Ethics of Reading (1987), he says, "Deconstruction is nothing more or less than good reading as such" (p. 10).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Archival Standards in Documentary Editing by Ronald J. Zboray</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Documentary editors seldom take note of archival practice though they have much in common with archivists. Both must confront the formidable task of controlling, in one way or another, thousands upon thousands of documents. Authorship and dates of documents must be ascertained, documents have to be filed in some sort of chronological order, and indexes (of cards or in computer data bases) must be constructed to provide access to the "collection." One would think then that editors and archivists would hold in common some general approaches and principles, but this has not happened. For example, although Mary Jo Kline in her A Guide to Documentary Editing advises in her chapter on document control: "if the editor is not an archivist or rare books librarian by training, he must learn the rudiments of these professions," she fails to mention such commonplace terms in the archival world as Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules , MARC AMC, or "authority work." But then again, Dr. Kline, through her methodology of finding out how various documentary projects operate, merely reflects the standard practice of editors. 1 The different goals of editors and archivists to some extent account for the distance separating their practices. Editors must control individual documents rarely numbering beyond the thousands while most archivists must deal with collections that often consist of millions of documents. The few archivists who control individual documents are sometimes deemed by the profession, not entirely charitably, "antiquarians." Editors, as their name implies, have always been guided by the need to produce an edition and not so directly by the archivist's goal of preserving manuscripts and rare printed materials from the vicissitudes of time. Editors aim to disseminate their work to a much wider audience than the relatively small number of hearty researchers who in person besiege archivists each year. Ironically, archivists themselves for a long time followed few common standards. Archivists generally observed the dictum to "let the nature of the collection determine the principles used to organize it." Though the resulting, often surreal bevy of organizational strategies frustrate many researchers today, they have by and large worked well enough and have often graced the task of archival research with a certain quaint charm. On the other hand, the archivist's cherished principle of respect des fonds has often preserved the original order in which documents were generated, saving them from idiosyncratic schemes of organization imposed upon collections by well-meaning but often misguided collection managers. While the arrival of the age of electronic information storage and retrieval has not changed the way archivists organize their collections, it has dramatically altered how they store information about these holdings. The format of such information must be standardized in order to permit easy retrieval and, eventually, storage on-line in a national data base of manuscript holdings. Since the early 1980's such standardization has increasingly drawn the attention of archivists, swelling the numbers at Society of American Archivist sessions devoted to computerization. 2 Standardization problems in automation have come slightly later and with less force to documentary editing. Most projects have used the computer for word processing rather than controlling documents. A study funded by the Office of Scholarly Communication and Technology found that as late as 1986 only 17 of 53 humanities projects funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities used computers to create data bases. Yet documentary editors have been publicly speaking out for the "possibility of pooling information from editorial projects in data bases" since as early as 1981. With time as scholarly data bases become more widely available and with the eventual acceptance of CD ROM storage, such centralized data bases for documentary editions will become feasible. But only those documentary editing projects which have taken the time to address the issue of archival standardization will be able to contribute to such data bases. Ironically, projects without computers which have adopted standard cataloging rules will be more likely to go on-line (thanks to the rising generation of hand-held scanners) than will many of the projects with computerized data bases in incompatible formats. 3 In short, documentary editors should begin now to evaluate adopting archival standards to assure that their work will be able to meet tomorrow's demand for computerized access to information. As a first step in this analysis, four central topics of archival standardization will be discussed here: cataloging rules, the MARC AMC format, authority work, and subject indexing. The applicability of these standards to the peculiar needs of documentary editing will be addressed, based upon the experiences of the Emma Goldman Papers, a project which has striven to adhere to at least some of these standard practices. 4</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cataloging Rules Archivists and other librarians now almost universally catalogue materials according to the second edition of Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR2). These rules grew out of a cooperative venture on the part of the American Library Association and the British Library Association to create a standard format, an effort which produced the first edition in 1967. In keeping with the library orientation of its parent bodies, AACR1 gave short shrift to nonbook materials and the British and American editions differed. To make matters worse, two years after AACR1, the International Meeting of Cataloguing Experts met in Copenhagen to create a new international standard: International Standard Bibliographical Description (ISBD). After many, many meetings and negotiations and with the addition of the Canadian Committee on Cataloging, the Library Association, and the Library of Congress as sponsors, the greatly revised and expanded second edition appeared in identical British and American editions in 1978. 5 AACR2 requires a great deal of study before a prospective cataloguer may implement the rules. The difficult organization of materials contributes to the steep learning curve. The first chapter of the book sets out in forty extremely dense pages "General Rules for Description." With these rules in mind, the cataloguer must then consult one of twelve other chapters for specific material-based formats ranging from the expected "Books, Pamphlets, and Printed Sheets" and "Manuscripts" to "Machine-Readable Data Files" and "Three Dimensional Artefacts and Realia." The formats comprise the first part of the book; "Headings, Uniform Titles, and References" concludes it. This final section must be consulted for proper forms for a wide variety of personal, geographic, and corporate names. Cataloguers unfamiliar with the formats find themselves constantly leaping about from the general rules to the specific and thence to the prescriptions for name forms. 6 AACR2 confronts the user with an unfamiliar, sometimes exotic technical vocabulary. For example, instead of the familiar term "author," AACR2 uses the unwieldy but perhaps more precise "statement of responsibility." For articles or other materials appearing in larger printed formats, the cataloguer must consult a section entitled "'In' Analytics" under a chapter entitled "Analysis." If two authors are responsible for the work, the first author is indexed under the category of "Main Entry" and the other under "Added Entry." The formats themselves may confuse first-time users. For example, an entry for a piece of correspondence contains, in order, the type of document ( e.g. , letter, telegram), the date composed (in year-month-day format), the place of composition, the name of the recipient, the recipient's location, a back slash, the author's name, a dash, the number of pages, a semi-colon, the size, another dash, and then the physical description ( e.g. , typescript or holograph). A typical entry might read, with editorial interpolations (brackets): "[Letter, 1931?] Dec. 20 [Paris, to] Emma [Goldman, St. Tropez?] / Peggy [Guggenheim]. — 2 p. ; 30 X 21 cm. — Typescript signed (photocopy)." For those unfamiliar with the format, it takes a while to hunt down the author and to sort out the place of writing from the destination of the correspondence. The elimination of back-to-back bracketing may easily lead the reader to suspect that "Goldman" may be a sub-unit of the municipality of St. Tropez. And it takes a long time to become accustomed to leaving spaces before colons and semi-colons or to using the period, space, dash, space ( i.e. , ".—") as a subsection delimiter. Formats differ from one another in which the order of data elements appear. For example, in the case of correspondence, the date of composition follows the first element in the entry, typically: "Letter, 1899 March 30. . . ." However, for articles, the date appears at the very end, as in the case of: "The White Slave Traffic / Emma Goldman.—p. 344-351; 19.5 cm. In Mother Earth. — Vol. 4, no. 11 (Jan. 1910)." Note, too, that "p." here stands for the inclusive pages in the parent imprint and not for the number of pages as was the case for correspondence. And only the height of the document is given, whereas the manuscript format prescribes height and width. Data element order differs even within the same format as in the case of manuscript speeches. A typical entry would read: "[Speech, before A Mass Meeting to Promote Local, State, and Public Works for the Unemployed, Union Square, New York] / Emma Goldman. — [1893 Aug. 21]." Here, in the same format as correspondence, the date comes after the author, not before, as with correspondence. Great differences exist in the manuscript format between manuscript volumes, correspondence, speeches and sermons, legal documents, collections of manuscripts, and miscellaneous single manuscripts. The labyrinthine rules of AACR2 certainly would seem to discourage editors attempting to adopt them, not to mention their processing staffs, if they have them. The Goldman Papers, for example, at first tried to encourage everyone to become familiar with the AACR2 manual; with time it became clear that the manual daunted even the most adventurous of the staff. The staff, instead, streamed into the microfilm editor's office, presumably thinking that he had the final word on the manual. It soon became clear that a usable interpretation of the AACR2 was necessary. Some of the more common AACR2 formats were written directly into the project's data entry program. The microfilm editor wrote other of the more exotic rules into the project's data processing manual and he finally became resigned to acting as the final authority for interpreting the rules. In short, because of the complexity of AACR2—much greater than MLA or Chicago style manuals—documentary editors will probably only be able to adopt the rules if they can boil them down for their own purposes. Because editions usually have so many documents in the same format, this should not present very many problems. But, of course, nearly every project must deal with stray documents in highly unusual formats. To meet this eventuality, someone in the office will have to specialize in knowing the AACR2 manual, or at least be familiar enough with it to solve expeditiously any problems that may come up. One may well ask after this discussion: is it worth the time and effort to use AACR2? Certainly operating under the rules takes much more thought and care than working with other style manuals; editors will have to spend at least twenty-five per cent more time entering data or filling out cards. Those projects preparing printed editions will also face the formidable task of getting AACR2 material into either the MLA or Chicago footnote and bibliography forms. Nevertheless, AACR2 promises to give projects the chance to put their material on-line in some future national data base. The point of most editions has been to create a definitive work that will last for years to come. AACR2 insures that not only the edition but also the formidable work that goes into collecting manuscripts from a wide variety of sources will be preserved. 7</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MARC AMC The rationale for using AACR2 depends upon the ultimate ability to put records on line in a computerized data base. The MARC AMC format provides the bridge between AACR2 (conceived of as a manual format), the archivist's or editing project's own computer data base, and nationwide networks of data bases. The acronym "MARC AMC" stands for Ma chine R eadable C ataloging, A rchival and M anuscripts C ontrol format. The AMC format represents only one of many formats that grew out of the Library of Congress's attempt to automate its substantial holdings. When the Library of Congress published its first AMC format in 1973, archivists complained that it worked best only for item-by-item description and, in general, refused to adopt the format. Archivists experimented with several other systems during the 1970's, but their implementations differed so much to make it impossible to create a network for sharing data. To address this problem, the Society of American Archivists (SAA) brought together in 1977 a National Information Systems Task Force that recommended a greatly modified form of MARC AMC be put forth as the standard for the archival community. In order to insure against only librarians determining the standard, the SAA's Committee on Archival Information and Exchange (CAIE) would help maintain the standard with the American Library Association's Committee on the Representation in Machine-Readable Form of Bibliographic Information. Editors and archivists generally need several works in order to understand and use the MARC AMC format. The Library of Congress's own MARC Formats for Bibliographic Data Update 10 (Library of Congress, 1984) formally presents the AMC format although the manual contains several errors, corrected in Update 11 (1985). A more useful exposition of the format can be found in the Nancy Sahli's MARC for Archives and Manuscripts: The AMC Format (Chicago: Society of American Archivists, 1985). Either work cannot be truly comprehended without consulting the examples given by Max J. Evans and Lisa Weber in MARC For Archives and Manuscript: A Compendium of Practice (The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1985). Other works which should be consulted include Steven L. Hensen's Archives, Personal Papers and Manuscripts (Library of Congress, 1983), the Research Libraries Group's AMC Field Guide (Stanford, Cal.: Research Libraries Group, 1983), and Walt Crawford's MARC for Library Use: Understanding the USMARC Formats (White Plains, N.Y. and London: Knowledge Industry Publications, 1984). 8 That so many works are necessary for using the format suggests its complexity. The basic unit of the format is, as anyone familiar with data base management programs will recognize, the "field." Computers recognize fields as containers for specific types of descriptive information ( e.g. , title, author, or date). Fields can be "fixed," meaning that they will accept a pre-determined number of characters, or they can be "variable." In MARC AMC, fields can also be divided into subfields, which are indicated within the field by the use of a dollar sign '$' and a lower case alphabetical character whose meaning changes depending upon the field. These characters are called "subfield delimiters." MARC prescribes that each field have a descriptive title and a numbered "tag" to identify the field to the computer. All fields taken together for each document described constitute a "record." Each record in MARC AMC has 77 variable data fields which in total provide the most in-depth description that archivists think they will need for years to come. Whereas AACR2 is best conceived of as a form for generating library index cards, MARC AMC has been developed with an eye to eventual computer manipulation of data. A good deal of duplication of data results from this goal. For example, the date and place of publication of a document must be recorded in separate fixed fields and together within the variable-length title field. The need for data manipulation and searching also means that throughout the format extensive codes are used to represent often complex descriptions. In the case of the physical description fixed field (Tag 007), "hdrbfbo16baca" translates into: h = microform d = microfilm reel r = reproduction b = negative f = 35 mm. microfilm b = normal reduction 016 = 16:1 reduction ratio b = monochrome a = silver halide c = service copy a = safety base Needless to say, the MARC AMC format confronts first-time users with a seemingly insurmountable maze of codes, fields, and subfields. The archival profession itself has generally trembled with trepidation at adopting the format since its release, and the ability to deal with MARC AMC has become a much-coveted skill for job applicants in the field. 9 Many major research libraries have effected only a very minimal interpretation of the format, due to the considerable cost and skill necessary to create full-blown MARC records. Editors attempting to implement MARC AMC on microcomputers face additional problems. The MARC records with their 77 fields are lengthy and editors catalog on a document-by-document basis, meaning that full implementation of the format requires a great, great deal of hard disk storage. Versions of DOS before 4.0, the most common operating systems for microcomputers, cannot address a single data base file stored on a disk greater than 32 megabytes. Most projects would probably need to jump over the 32 megabyte limit by using DOS 4.0 or some other specialized software, if they intend to adopt MARC. Software for getting information stored into a MARC format also will present problems for editors. Most libraries committed to MARC use the programs offered by bibliographic utilities such as OCLC and RLIN for creating MARC records. Commercial data base packages can be adapted to the needs of MARC AMC only with great difficulty and considerable programming. The biggest stumbling blocks of these programs grow out of MARC's need for numerous variable-length fields. Most of the major, commercial data management programs for microcomputers, with the exception of Revelation, operate on a fixed-field length basis, meaning that the vast majority of disk space in any implementation of MARC will be wasted by unused portions of fixed fields. 10 A new program tailored specifically by archivists at Michigan State University for MARC AMC users has recently come on the market and promises to address some of these problems. Editors may also look into "turnkey" systems—combining hardware, software, and instructional and service support—such as those of Geac and OCLC's LS2000, although these systems may prove to be too expensive for the meager budgets of most projects. 11 Once again, the question must be asked concerning MARC AMC, as it was for AACR2: is it worth it for editors? Until an expert-type software ( i.e. , one in which the formatting rules are embedded within the program) becomes available, probably not. The format in its present form is simply too difficult and costly to implement and maintain, especially on a document-by-document basis. Editors with enough funds could hire a full-time cataloger with MARC AMC experience to oversee data entry. Nevertheless, the sheer volume of information each MARC AMC record contains dramatically increases the chances for errors and the time needed for proofreading. And quality control becomes hard to attain unless every processor is well versed in the rules of the format. In short, MARC AMC threatens to distract editors from their primary work, which is, after all, producing an edition, not creating a data base. One of the advantages of electronic information storage, however, is that data can later be manipulated into different formats. At some future date when users may be able to access information about manuscripts through an on-line, national data base, documentary editors may be able to transfer their data bases to the MARC AMC format, if they take the proper steps now to insure compatibility. The issue of compatibility should be addressed at the conceptual stage of data base design. Those who have designed data bases will immediately realize that MARC AMC, like AACR2, represents only a goal of information output and may not be the best way to store and retrieve information locally. For example, a local data base may need only one date field to feed, via programming, into the three or more fields in MARC AMC that may require date information. Particularly, the AACR2 title field must be broken down into component parts or else, for correspondence, programs will index all letters under the initial part of the field ( i.e. , "letter to" instead of the recipient's name). Even if the author's name is removed to a separate field, AACR2 demands a first-then-last name order and MARC AMC and most data base management programs, vice versa. Editors should not think that manipulating information electronically will easily solve the problems of transferring data between different formats. The previous case, for example, of changing the order of first and last names, requires a herculean amount of programming effort to account for all the idiosyncrasies of usage. At first glance, such manipulation would seem to depend merely upon the location of the comma in an inverted name form. But what about abbreviations, preceded by a comma, such as "Ltd."? Or names of business firms like the publishers "Little, Brown"? The cases multiply to the point where a program has to take into account literally hundreds of rules and thousands of exceptions. Some projects even enter the author or recipient's name in inverted order with the last name in all capital letters, or perhaps worse, titles in all capitals. The distribution of lower and case letters in a name or a title is something that, at this point, only human intelligence can do largely because humans decide, in not the most logical fashion, what their names and the title of works will be. For example, how would a program know to capitalize the first "V" in "W. S. V an Valkenburgh" and not the same letter in "Henry v an Dyke"? In short, editors should study AACR2 and the MARC AMC format very closely to make sure that their data bases will be able to output information in either form. The Goldman Papers' most recent revision of its data entry program, called with heavenward hopes "Ultimate Emma", has the ability to address both formats. Document processors enter data directly at one of six microcomputer work stations networked together and sharing distributed hard disk resources. Information such as date, place of publication or writing, destination (if correspondence), recipient or title are all entered in separate fields via a menu driven system that records such information in a form which allows for electronic manipulation and indexing. After this, the program assembles the various fields into a large, AACR2-compatible title field. The document processors are then given the option to enter editorial attributions (called in AACR2 parlance "interpolations") such as brackets and question marks—the things which, if they appeared in fields to be indexed, would destroy any semblance of order. For example, a bracketed last name beginning with "Z" would come before one beginning with "A". Through the design of the data base and through the manipulations of the computer program, the Emma Goldman Papers has thus shown that it is possible for editorial projects to enter and retrieve its data efficiently and in a form which can easily go on-line in a national MARC AMC-based data base.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Authority Work All editors already do in-office authority work when confronted with documents with variants of an author's name. Emma Goldman, for example, wrote letters under various pseudonyms such as E. G. Colton, E. G. Smith, Emma Clausen, and E. G. Brady. Obviously in all these cases, "Emma Goldman" would be the authorized name form under which the document would be indexed. But what of another famous case, her lover and lecture tour manager, Ben L. Reitman? Should his name appear in an index as "Benjamin Lewis Reitman", "Benjamin L. Reitman", "Ben Lewis Reitman", "Ben Reitman", or "Ben L. Reitman"? If the name is taken directly from documents, Reitman would appear as five different people in an index, something which would have amused him as a dedicated prankster and a sometime anarchist, but which would only irk researchers seeking him out. Authority work within the archival world expands this type of authorized control of name forms and subject headings beyond the confines of the office to archives across the country. Only with knowledge of authorized names and subjects can users search and retrieve information from a national on-line data base. But to make the system workable, all the archives must use the same common name form as well, or else users will have to somehow know all the variants and search them out, too—a time-consuming proposition. As with MARC AMC, the Library of Congress has, by virtue of its size and commitment to being the national library, taken the lead in developing authority control for national computer networks. In 1975 the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science funded a study by Lawrence Buckland, The Role of the Library of Congress in the Evolving National Network , which led to the establishment of the Network Development Office (NDO) at the Library of Congress. NDO faced the task of computerizing what had been a manual process. The Library of Congress had for years maintained, in card file form, a name authority system of which the most publicly visible portion was the name forms in National Union Catalog . In 1974, the Library published some of this information in Name Headings With References . A batch automated system followed in 1977, which generated such things for distribution to libraries as authority cards and cumulative microfiche. Finally in the early 1980's, through the efforts of NDO and the MARC Editorial Division, the authorities went on-line in their own MARC AMC format. 12 MARC AMC Authorities do not hold much promise for documentary editors seeking proper name forms for their editions. The Library of Congress enters authority name forms only for material currently being processed; retrospective authority records are updated only as they are used. Thus a new work with a historical person's name as author or as a subject will have to be published and catalogued by the Library for the name form to be updated. Since so many of the names that come up in documentary editions belong to relatively obscure people, the chances are that those forms would not be contained in the MARC Authorities data base, and if they were, they probably would have an incorrect pre-AACR2 form. Nevertheless, editors should attempt to do as much authority work using the national system as possible. This could be as simple as checking name forms against the National Union Catalog—though it must be remembered that these entries will probably be in pre-AACR2 form. The best approach would be for editors associated with a university to arrange for the campus library to allow them access to one of the bibliographic utilities that carry MARC Authorities, such as OCLC. No matter in what way editors may undertake this authority work, they will find that the authorized name sometimes is not the best form, according to their much more informed editorial judgment. Catalogues at whatever institution creates the name forms very seldom have anything approaching the specialized knowledge of editors. For on-line searching, however, the name form itself matters less than maintenance of consistency throughout the system. Of course, this means that editors may need to employ a two-track system for authority work: one which looks outward to the national data base and the other for use within the office and, ultimately, within the edition. Obviously, authority work adds a good deal of time to cataloging. For example, descriptive catalogers at the Library of Congress spend, according to one estimate, half their time in name authority work. 13 Since editors deal with a much more finite universe of names, it would probably be likely that efforts at achieving proper name forms might take only a maximum of one-quarter more processing staff time. As with most cataloging, the error rate runs very high; according to one study, if names occur more than ten times in a data base at least one error should be expected. 14 The Goldman Papers approaches the issue of authority work in the following manner. All authors, recipients, and titles receive four-letter mnemonic codes. Names generally take, in order, the first two letters of the last name and the first two letters of the first ( e.g. , "goem" for Emma Goldman). Titles are coded using the first two letters of the first word, and the first letters of the next two important words. Living My Life , for example, takes the code "liml." When entering a document for the first time, processors, instead of entering the full name, attempt to input the four-letter code. The program seeks the code in the project's authority data base. If the program finds the code, it retrieves it and asks to verify the name. If not, the program prompts the user for new code; if so, the program writes the authorized name form directly to the record. If the program does not find the code in the authority files, the program gives the processor the opportunity to create a new entry in the name authorities file. Periodically, the microfilm editor reviews new entries for proper form. The Goldman Papers system has several advantages for doing authority work. Since one entry creates all names in the main data base, variant forms do not occur. Eventually, the four-letter codes that appear in each record can be linked to any altered entries in the authority data base; hence if the forms the Goldman Papers uses differ from those of MARC Authorities, the MARC form can be entered in the authority data base to permit output in a form which allows for on-line searching.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Subject Assigning Subject assigning constitutes, in actuality, a subset of authority work. The same need to maintain consistency over the forms of access points makes highly controlled subject coding crucial in an on-line environment. Subject indexing differs from name authority work, however. Subject assigning must be, by its very nature, less exact than name authority work. A part of the lore of many editing projects concerns the time when editors and processors passed around a single document and no one assigned the same subjects to it. The story is probably apocryphal; editors grow so accustomed to working with an eye towards objectivity that they can easily forget that subject indexing represents a highly, informed interpretation of the material. Indexers differ in their style almost as much as authors, which is not to say that poor indexing can be excused by an indexer's right to unbridled self-expression. Indexing can be an act of concentrated creativity and perspicacity or it can be a futile effort that ultimately turns away readers. 15 Although the style of an index may vary, its quality depends in large part upon internal consistency. If indexing something with great relevance to the social history of the period, such as Samuel Sewall's diaries, one cannot create an entry for "beer" on one page and index "beer" under "alcoholic beverages" on another (if this is the only such beverage appearing on the page). 16 Readers should feel confident that when they look up an entry, they will find there all the relevant portions of the text, unless cross-referenced to another subject heading. Electronic information storage and retrieval demands not only internal consistency within an index, but that the subject headings used conform in their form, meaning, and application to widely accepted standards. Thesauri of subject terms present editors and archivists with a means of achieving this external level of consistency. 17 The Library of Congress's Subject Headings (LCSH) have become for the library and archival world the de facto thesaurus, though in reality those two large red books hardly deserve the term. A true thesaurus would allow users to be able to follow, through cross-references, natural language forms of an expression to the most technical. For example, if someone tries to use "street-walkers" they will not be referred to "prostitution." In other words, one must in general know the proper authorized term before using LCSH. The form of LCSH also differs from a true thesaurus. A thesaurus like that of the Educational Resources Information Center gives broader, narrower, and related terms as well as extensive scope notes; LCSH only renders "see also" references and has very little advice on the way the terms should be used. 18 Tomes can be written about the inadequacies of LCSH for the age of electronic information storage and retrieval. LCSH began as (and to a large extent remains) a manual thesaurus; as of mid-1987 it had still not gone on-line. One must thumb through thousands of pages of two unwieldy volumes to use the work rather than being able to pose simple queries to a data base. To the horror of experienced data base managers, the LCSH has been issued since 1908 in ten editions; no variations—and they have been considerable—between the editions have been cross-referenced or even formally tracked by the Library of Congress . To make matters worse, the headings used by LCSH bewilder specialists in several fields. Why would film historians ever look under LCSH's "moving-pictures" when they probably never used the term in their entire scholarly careers? And LCSH manages to offend, in various ways, several special interest groups, especially minorities. The Subject Headings have been so insensitive to women's issues that "counter-thesauri" have been posed as correctives. Finally, LCSH does not provide the descriptive depth required by the type of document-by-document indexing that editors undertake; several editors have tried to use the subject headings and have given up in exasperation. 19 Given all LCSH's problems, should editors avoid it completely? Probably not, since the Subject Headings remains the closest thing to a true, national thesaurus. If the federal government ever does realize the importance of such a thesaurus for the electronic information age and supplies funds for bringing together specialists in various fields, lexicographers, and librarians to develop a definitive thesaurus, undoubtedly the basis will be the system developed by the Library of Congress. Editors can make use of LCSH if they use it only as a basis for subject assigning. For example, the Goldman Papers addressed the limitations of the Library of Congress system in two ways: by reshaping the original scope of the subject headings to include women's experiences and by creating new headings which are then cross-referenced back to the nearest Library of Congress term. The project has avoided working with the large volumes by pre-selecting the terms likely to be used and entering them into a thesaurus data base. Subject terms have been grouped beneath ten major headings that range from "Arts and Letters" to "Economics" and in over a hundred subgroups. For example, "Booktrade" appears beneath "Arts and Letters." Subject headings displayed under their assigned group and subgroup are frequently printed out to be used by staff members who process documents. Subject assigning follows a system similar to that for name authorities in which four-letter mnemonic codes stand for headings ( i.e. , "aupu" for "Authors and Publishers"). The data entry program ensures that codes will not be duplicated and allows for the entry of new terms in the thesaurus data base with proper group and subgroup headings. 20 With the new generation of microcomputers based upon the Intel 80386 microprocessor chip and the new operating system being jointly developed by Microsoft and IBM (OS/2) it will become feasible for projects to consult a subject thesaurus directly on the CRT screen in a manner similar to the various thesauri currently available for word processing programs. A pop-up menu would present various authorized options to a natural language subject term which can be entered electronically by merely hitting a number key. However, on today's IBM-compatible microcomputers based upon the 8088 and 80286 chips, such thesaurus authority work would be difficult to manage and would be prohibitively slow given the random access memory limits of these computers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conclusion The above discussion has attempted to point out that documentary editors may be coming to an important juncture in their work. As on-line national library and archival data bases become a reality, editors will have to assess the role, if any, they will play in these networks. If editors and the agencies and foundations that fund them decide that a part of the goal of making editions accessible to the public will be the ability to do on-line searching of documents published in documentary editions, then editorial projects will have to start thinking now about using the same standards archivists employ. Certainly it seems a waste of energy for any project controlling its documents with the use of a data base management system to ignore the archival standards which could open the data base to a wide audience. Yet documentary editors must be prepared to put a great deal of effort into adopting archival standards. AACR2 and the MARC AMC format must be mastered and incorporated into the project at the cost of increased complexity and, consequently, more time required to finish the project. That cost may presently not be worth it for editors, at least until expert programs have been written to ease the use of AACR2 and MARC AMC. Authority work for names and subjects poses further hindrances. Projects would have to add the search for authorized name forms onto their already burdened work load. For subjects, editors will have no other choice but to use the Library of Congress's Subject Headings and to stumble along with often inappropriate headings. Nevertheless, editors can take comfort in that archivists will face many of the same problems. Out of those problems will grow new solutions in microcomputer software and on-line data base utilities. An argument thus can be made for editors waiting and letting archivists shoulder the burden of developing approaches to on-line access. Waiting may be a mistake, however, since archivists and editors, though having much in common, have differing goals. Any national data base of manuscript holdings will probably not include the type of document-by-document description editions offer. Such description simply takes up too much information storage space to be kept permanently on-line. If editors can manage to get onto a national data base or some other bibliographic utility, they would essentially have a new form of publication (the data base) and, hopefully, a new source of revenue. Libraries, for example, are often paid or given credits for the MARC records they create. Apart from monetary considerations, going on-line with indexed editions could conceivably attract far more users than books or microfilm. A user would need only a microcomputer with a modem to gain access to the data bases of editions. In a single search for a name the user would have contact with the work of several documentary editing projects. If documentary editors have done their authority work well, that search could yield records for hundreds of documents in a matter of seconds; if done manually, through library visits or interlibrary loans or printed catalog searching, the same search would take weeks if not months. Before editors rush into the new millennium of "connectivity" ( i.e. , networked information storage and retrieval), they should realize at least one danger that lurks in the future. Documentary editions projects' creation of data bases with on-line capability may be seen by some funding agencies and foundations as a low-cost alternative to both microfilm and book publishing, in the same manner that microfilm has been argued as appropriate for editions of lesser figures in American history. Editors who decide to pursue connectivity should make it clear to all grantors that the data bases being constructed are meant only to increase the access to microfilm and book editions—else these editors may become more like archivists than they ever intended. With this caveat in mind, editors have one other reason, one less tangible than the ones presented above, for becoming familiar with archival standards. Learning the standards gives often-isolated editors a sense of community. The archivists and librarians who developed the standards faced many of the same problems as editors do in their day-to-day tasks. Seeing how the standards deal with problems gives an editor a shock of recognition, even if editors reject the standards themselves. The standards took many minds and much discussion to construct. Editors who familiarize themselves with the standards thus engage in a dialogue with this on-going process of definition within the archival profession. This dialogue can enrich the decision making of editors and ultimately contribute to their sense of professionalization.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Two Lollard Codices and Lollard Book-Production by Ralph Hanna III</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For most of the English Lollard writings we know publicly, we owe a considerable debt to two Victorian editors, Thomas Arnold and F. D. Matthew. 1 Both, in the course of their work, devoted considerable attention to an important codex which collects a wide range of such tracts, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS. 296. And both acknowledged that they were flummoxed by one feature of this book. Matthew remarked, in his headnote to the tract called "Of Feigned Contemplative Life" (hereafter FCL): The scribe who wrote the Corpus MS. (X) made a curious blunder with this tract. . . . Owing most likely to the displacement of some leaves in the MS. from which he copied, he transferred the last portion of this tract to the end of 'A Petition to the King and Parliament,' while bringing the last part of the Petition to the end of this. As is often the case with him, he passed over the junction in happy unconsciousness that he was writing nonsense. And Arnold, who had earlier edited "A Petition" (hereafter PKP), noted the same textual mishandling and commented, "How it occurred, it is now impossible to say." 2 While I am certain that Matthew was correct in suggesting that the Corpus scribe copied from a misarranged exemplar, the error seems to me particularly significant. I hope, in the course of examining how this misadventure befell the Corpus scribe, to indicate some constraints which underlie his book-production. These, in turn, will allow some consideration of known features of Lollard production generally. As Arnold and Matthew indicate, Corpus includes full texts of both FCL and PKP, but the texts occur in fused forms. In each case, the brief conclusion of the other text has been consecutively attached to the lengthy head of the tract. 3 In Corpus, FCL begins on p. 165 a (sig. k3 ra ); the text continues, in due order, until line 34, well down the column, of p. 170 a (sig. k5 va ). At that point, which corresponds to EETS 74:195/7, the scribe simply begins copying PKP, at a point which corresponds to Arnold's p. 520/18. The text reads (I insert a solidus at the point of juncture): "Lord, where þes worldly prestis wisere þan / distroied þe false feiþ tauʒte of anticrist and of his false cursede disciplis." The remainder of what is presented as FCL, ending on p. 172 a (sig. k6 va ), merely transcribes the concluding portion of PKP. The text of PKP occurs at the very end of the codex, beginning on p. 288 a (sig. s9 va ). At just the precise point in that tract where the final pages (already copied in the manuscript) should occur, the scribe ceases to copy PKP and instead finishes the text with that portion of FCL that he should have included earlier. This juncture occurs at p. 297 b (sig. t4 rb ), line 20; the text reads: "by cursed ypocritis and heretikis and worldly prestis vnkunnynge in goddes lawe / ben alle þe apostlis of crist." The remainder of the manuscript, which ends at p. 298 b (sig. t4 vb ), line 12, gives the conclusion of FCL, the portion for which the scribe substituted the conclusion of PKP earlier in the codex. At this point, I want to draw attention to several features of the Corpus text which neither Arnold nor Matthew noted. They were interested, after all, in making texts available, not in codicological examination. But there appears to me ample evidence on which to argue that the Corpus scribe never planned to provide a text of PKP. A number of manuscript features indicates that the text has been added to an otherwise complete and consecutively produced book. The quiring of Corpus 296 at this point suggests that PKP may be a late supply. The entire manuscript, except for the last two quires, was produced in regular eights. But the penultimate quire s (pp. 271-290) is a ten, and the final quire t (pp. 290-298) a four. This particular confirmation of quires looks to me suspiciously like what I have elsewhere described as "a superseded fascicle boundary." 4 The Corpus scribe saw that the text with which he intended to end his copying could not be completed in a normal eight-leaf quire and constructed a ten-leaf one instead. This unique text, "Þe grete sentence of curs expouned," begins at p. 239 a and ends on p. 288 a (sig. s9 va ). Had the scribe copied it straight through in his usual eights, he would have ended quire s at p. 286 and then would have finished transcribing the work on a loose singleton. Like a great many medieval book-producers, he rejected this solution—small quires, singletons, and bifolia frequently get misplaced, as we will see; his solution, to produce an extra-long quire to accommodate text runover, is a commonplace one. But the concluding pages of quire s and all those of quire t, which bear PKP, look markedly different from all earlier sections of the volume. I do not think the text was copied by the same scribe responsible for the rest: the hand is not so carefully formed and shows different habits of letter-formation and -distribution. And especially in the final quire of the book, the page format differs in slight ways from the remainder. The main Corpus scribe has copied within a regular forty-line frame for something in excess of 140 folios; here, as the writing sprawls out, the text is typically presented in a 37- or 38-line column. When what I believe a second scribe decided to copy PKP, he practiced economies. Rather than starting a new quire, he simply began to add his text of PKP on the blank pages left at the end of the heretofore concluding ten-leaf quire s. The text was longer than the blank portions of this existing quire, yet not so long as to require an additional full eight; the short quire t, in which this scribe concluded his work on the final verso, proved just right for his purposes and conserved parchment. But these decisions indicate that the plan for the book changed at some point very near the end of production and that, with the exception of the odd bit he had inadvertently copied earlier, the main scribe had apparently not planned to copy PKP. This interpretation of the codicological evidence, of course, immediately raises problems. The materials the second scribe eventually copied at the end of the codex, given the exactness of the textual fits, must have been derived from the same exemplar from which the main scribe had already transcribed a portion of PKP in apparently the wrong place. Thus, the evidence suggests that the scribes responsible for Corpus might simultaneously have and yet not have access to portions of that single exemplar containing two of their texts. From the absence of the full text, one might surmise that the main scribe initially did not make use of this portion of the exemplar at all, perhaps for editorial reasons, perhaps because it was unavailable to him. Yet his colleague could access a portion of the same exemplar, presumptively contiguous, when he later decided to extend the apparently completed codex. At this point, I want to add a further complicating detail, which should have occurred to both Arnold and Matthew. For Corpus 296 is not, for much of its course, a unique manuscript: it has a partial twin, another early fifteenth-century manuscript, Trinity College, Dublin, MS. 244 (C.3.12). The evidence Trinity provides is particularly disconcerting, for, excepting some leaves now lost which contained the conclusion of the work, Trinity includes all of PKP in one place. Moreover, that codex includes its version of the text at a provocative point: after providing the complete tract FCL with its sections in proper order (ff. 136-141 v ), it originally contained a full version of PKP (ff. 141 v -148 v , after which a leaf and a full quire have been lost). 5 Even in this truncated form, the textual presentation in Trinity suggests that the exemplar had full and continuous texts of FCL and PKP as adjacent units. Thus, the fragmentary conclusion of PKP in Corpus has been placed correctly (or at least, in the intended position in their common exemplar); what appears, from this perspective, the after-the-fact provision of the opening sections of this text in Corpus is that manuscript's aberrancy. So I return to Arnold and Matthew's befuddlement. What kind of error is this? How could such an exchange of textual materials have occurred? I want first to note the nature of those textual portions exchanged in Corpus 296. In both cases, the misrepresentation of the texts is discrete and affects only these texts while respecting their boundaries, their junctions with adjacent items in the manuscript. Moreover, only the ends of the tracts have been exchanged. On this basis, it seems reasonable to suppose that, whatever else is true of the exemplar behind Trinity and Corpus, it was not, for some portions at least, a continuous manuscript, in the sense that each text was immediately followed by its successor on the same leaf. Had texts appeared in this consecutive fashion in the exemplar, one would hardly expect to find the exchange of material between the two tracts text-bounded: one might reasonably assume that some portions of subsequent texts, included on the same leaves as the conclusions of FCL and PKP, would also show dislocation. But the order and extent of texts in Trinity, otherwise identical to Corpus so long as the manuscripts are true twins, insure that no such dislocation has occurred. If one ignores the exchange of passages, Corpus has accurate textual boundaries. If pieces of other texts have been dislocated, the main Corpus scribe has corrected these failures and reestablished accurate textual boundaries. But if he was capable of such correction, he should have discovered his initial mistake, and might well be expected to have amended it as well. One should conclude, I think, that the textual exchange I describe occurred through inadvertence (Matthew's "happy unconsciousness") and that it reflected properties of the lost exemplar. Further, identifying one of these properties as the discontinuous presentation of texts places the lost exemplar in a well-recognized class of codices. It gathered together a set of fascicles or of "booklets," short self-contained groups of quires which formed a whole only by aggregation. Given the nearly universal agreement of Corpus and Trinity in contents and order for a very protracted period (224 pages in Corpus, 186 folios, discounting losses, in Trinity), one must assume that both scribes acquired this bunch of fascicles in some relatively fixed form. But the state of PKP in Corpus is telling: it represents, as I have suggested above, a separate piece of production, derived from an apparently separable textual unit. This feature supposes that the exemplar was capable either of being disbound or of shuffling of textual portions; in any event, the booklet which included PKP was somehow mobile, perhaps even detachable from the codex at large (and thus added only belatedly by the second Corpus scribe). In an effort at specifying how the endings of texts might become exchanged in Corpus, I want to consider the size of the textual portions mishandled. In actual terms, the bit of PKP on pp. 170-172 runs for nearly four columns, 152 lines in the scribe's format here. The isolated piece of FCL is roughly half that size, nearly two columns, 68 lines in the second scribe's comparable format in the added quire at the end. If the extent of the textual fragments is considered in terms of the full texts of the works, just about one seventh of FCL (forty-one lines in Matthew's text out of 279 total) appears apart from the body of the text. For PKP the corresponding figures differ: something over one sixth of the text (eighty lines in Arnold's text out of 494 total) has been copied out of sequence. In trying to visualize the exemplar behind both manuscripts, PKP provides the most useful place to begin. Given its placement in Corpus 296, this text must have begun an independent fascicle. From this fact, and from the relative extents of the separate portions in which the text was copied, one can make some rough estimates about the form of this textual unit. The two separated bits of copy include the whole text; the shorter piece essentially represents one sixth of the whole. On this basis, as a separate fascicle, the text should have been divided between production units related to one another in a ratio of 5:1: the simplest hypothesis would postulate a text divided between a ten-leaf quire and a continuation in a single bifolium. In passing, one should note that in this minimal size for the units involved—any multiple which maintained a five-to-one ratio is theoretically possible—the folios of the exemplar would have been roughly comparable in textual volume to the pages in the surviving copy, Corpus 296. In fact, a modest amount of evidence implies that such a minimal unit was in fact at issue here. Such evidence that a folio of the exemplar bore approximately the same amount of text as a page in Corpus emerges from one shift of scribal stints in Trinity. The manuscript was written by two or three scribes, both or all involved in copying materials from the exemplar shared with Corpus. At the end of f. 91 v , the scribe responsible for the entire text to this point apparently gave a segment of the exemplar to a colleague: this step was probably undertaken to expedite copying through allowing simultaneous work in two hands. Scribe 1 resumed his work at the end of the segment he had given scribe 2, and each left his partner, on the page where the other was to begin his stint, a partial sentence to indicate where copying was to start. The section of text copied by scribe 2 was not a fascicle: it includes part or all of three texts, corresponding to EETS 74:112/25-143/22. But it seems likely to have been two eight-leaf quires, or 32 pages. The presumption for such a sizing depends upon the correspondence of this portion to seventeen plus pages in Corpus (pp. 106 a , line 13-123 b , line 9). Since Trinity scribe 2 did not include almost a column of Latin unique to Corpus (pp. 106 b -107 a ) and arguably not part of his split examplar, the textual block he was copying corresponds to slightly more than sixteen pages of Corpus. (Scribe 2 nonetheless miscalculated the number of leaves necessary to hold the text, and on the final leaf of his stint had to reduce his writing to about half its normal size so as to match the point at which his partner's copying resumed.) This sizing of portions of PKP also allows some inferences about the exemplar's presentation of FCL. If exchanged portions of PKP occupied most of two full leaves in the exemplar, the exchanged portions of the other text, less than half the length, would have taken up less than a full leaf. However, they should have been extensive enough to cover more than just the recto of this leaf. One can then imagine that, in the minimum possible proportions, the displaced part of FCL was written on a single folio, the concluding one in its fascicle. However, one can only with difficulty speculate about the shape of that fascicle. PKP stood at the head of its textual unit, but one may not be similarly assured about FCL. The text may have been situated at the end of a very lengthy fascicle, and in such a fascicle, it could have begun at the middle of a quire, or of a leaf. But the misplaced section most probably occupied the final leaf of this unit, a leaf which was somehow mobile—perhaps because single and sewn to its predecessors, perhaps because detached from its conjugate. Were FCL to have comprised a single booklet, it could have formed a six-leaf quire with a sewn-on singleton; or it might have been copied into an eight-leaf quire with a cancelled blank eighth leaf. These two situations could produce the alternative hypotheses I have mentioned—a singleton becoming unsewn, a weakened quire structure from which a leaf might become detached. Although I adopt the first of these hypotheses simply as an explanatory procedure in what follows, it remains only a suggestive possibility: one cannot know to the same degree as with PKP the original shape of this portion of the exemplar. However, this information suffices to explain the textual mismanagement in Corpus 296. One must, first of all, assume that the sensible copying of two full texts in Trinity indicates that this scribe received the exemplar intact, with the texts appropriately ordered. I would schematize this ordering of the exemplar: booklet a booklet b . . . FCL PKP 1 6 + 1 leaf 1 10 2 2 After the Trinity scribe had used this textual source, but prior to the activity of the main Corpus scribe, the exemplar had been subjected to displacement. The late provision of PKP in Corpus may indicate that, in addition to displacement, minimal separation of contents had occurred. I would schematize the form in which the Corpus scribes received the exemplar: booklet a 1 booklet b 2 . . . booklet b 1 + a 2 . . . FCL PKP PKP + FCL 1 6 2 2 1 10 + 1 leaf (I insert an ellipsis simply to indicate the removal of materials from their original station: I do not believe the nature of the ellipsis can be specified, and the removed materials may have had no set place within the exemplar.) The loose concluding leaf of FCL had become detached from the quire to which it properly belonged (booklet a, quire 1). Disbound, it may have been inserted into booklet b, quire 1, travelled with that quire as it was moved from its earlier placement in the exemplar (the form as available to Trinity), and (as an obviously final leaf, because partially blank) removed to a position following that quire as the apparent conclusion of the now atelous PKP. Moreover, this movement of the quire containing the greater portion of PKP left the bifolium bearing the end of that text to stand as the apparent conclusion to the preceding, now also atelous text, FCL. This reconstruction seems to me more likely than an apparently simpler alternative Anne Hudson and David Vander Meulen, who have read this article in draft, have suggested—the exchanged texts disposed in two consecutive full quires. 6 In such a view, the first quire after one comprising most of FCL would have contained the end of FCL (f. 1) and head of PKP (ff. 2-8), and the following one the end of PKP (ff. 1-2) and subsequent materials (ff. 3-8). The initial anomaly—the conjunction of the start of FCL and the end of PKP—might then have resulted from the misplacement of the middle quire. But in such a view, the textual dislocation I describe becomes more, not less, difficult to comprehend, inasmuch as it would require two acts of motivated scribal intervention. In this account, one must assume that the first Corpus scribe chose deliberately to ignore codicological signals in his exemplar. In its unbound state, proper ordering of the exemplar would have been insured by either conventional catchwords at quire endings, clear quire signatures, or both. For the scribe to miss out a full quire implies that he did not heed either noncongruence of catchword and subsequent text, or non-consecutive quire signatures, or both. Moreover, the disposition of texts in Corpus must, in this account, presume a further set of erratic activities by the second scribe. Having acquired the intact quire 1 and having determined to copy it, this scribe would have had to ignore the construction of the quire (as well as any signatures) and to have deliberately refolded it, to make its current f. 1 its f. 8 so as to provide a clear conclusion to the text of PKP. Further, unless the conclusion of FCL was entirely page-bound (limited to quire 1, f. 1, with no runover and with PKP beginning at the head of f. 2), the scribe should have been acutely aware that he was tampering in a way which did not respect the exemplar at all. This seems particularly unlikely, since his sole reason for adding materials would have been fidelity to the exemplar, a sense that the first Corpus scribe had not reproduced it in its appropriate fullness. Such a concatenation of erratic procedures is possible, but seems to me inherently less probable than the booklet situation which I argue here. This reconstruction allows two conclusions in passing. First, both Arnold and Matthew misdescribed the textual disruptions of Corpus 296. Only metaphorically did anything like a "transfer" or "transposition" of texts occur, and the main scribe in fact copied the conclusion of PKP precisely where he should have done, in the position it always, within our knowledge, had in the exemplar. Second, both Corpus scribes seem relatively blameless figures in the procedure: the first palpably did not recognize that his exemplar had been disrupted by removal of pieces of text, and both copied faithfully and straight on the apparently consecutive materials they had at hand. 7 One might wonder why such a disruption occurred at all and especially why, in the period between these two copyings of this exemplar, a piece of that source text might have been separated from the remainder. Such considerations will move the discussion beyond the narrower topic of the precise construction of Corpus and Trinity toward a social siting of this variety of book-production. Although there exists no evidence to support the supposition (these are the unique copies of PKP), 8 the first quire of PKP may have been removed for a separate copying. And this copying may have occurred in a locale removed from the central place where the body of the exemplar was retained (and where it was available, more or less whole, to the group of scribes responsible for Corpus and Trinity). This exemplar may have been produced in booklet form for a reason rather different from the usual forces which impel this type of production and perhaps reflects uniquely Lollard modes of production. Most normally, one assumes booklets exist to facilitate production of the text in hand—to take account of difficulty of access to exemplars, for example. 9 But in the case of the Corpus/Trinity exemplar, which contained illegal texts, heretical ones, and which may consequently have had to be copied in quasi-clandestine circumstances, producing the exemplar in booklet form may have been a deliberate effort at facilitating subsequent book-production. Corpus may initially have lost access to the first quire of PKP because it was on loan, out to be copied—not as part of a production which necessarily involved other portions of the exemplar volume, but perhaps as a unique text. In effect, the fascicular exemplar may have constituted a separable lending library—a series of smallish booklets, held in relatively fixed order in a central location, but available in broken form to a larger reading community. Two different considerations lend some credence to this argument. First, as I have indicated above, although twins for much of their length, Corpus and Trinity do diverge. Their identical contents originally included twenty-six items (some no longer extant in Trinity, owing to textual damage). At this point, the main booklet of Trinity concludes with a brief filler item (apparently both acephalic and atelous); what is perhaps the same scribe (but in any event, certainly one involved elsewhere in the portion of Trinity copied from the common exemplar) then adds another booklet, comprised, with a minor exception, of unique Lollard texts. Following p. 224 b (but preceding the late supply of PKP at the end), Corpus offers a different series of Wycliffite texts, all but one unique. Conceivably this continuation represents the end of the common exemplar: Trinity either may have chosen not to reproduce these portions or may have lacked access to the whole. Such a view would explain the second Corpus scribe's decision to supply PKP: he may have felt that the manuscript in production was intended as a complete rendition of the exemplar, checked off rubrics against the booklets at hand, and extended the manuscript on discovering it was short an item. Whatever the case, both groups of scribes show a substantial interest in gathering large groups of Lollard materials. Beyond copying a huge sequence of heretical documents intact, they also appear capable of exercising independent initiative: they are able to acquire a rich assortment of items similar to, but probably exclusive of, their prepared exemplar. One could well see both groups as attached to some center of Lollard copying and, through that association, in a borrower-lender relationship with other Lollard writers and copyists. Moreover, both manuscripts inscribe centralized cooperation. In sum, we are discussing four or five different scribes who alternate and finish one another's work. (If there is a third Trinity scribe, he succeeds scribe 1 in mid-leaf and mid-text on f. 111 v .) And all had access to a partially fixed canon in a common exemplar. Both manuscripts stand as monuments to an organized cooperative form of book-production with, at the least, links to a single textual source, and thus center. To approach the second consideration I have mentioned, I want to examine briefly the one non-unique text included in Corpus but lacking in Trinity. This fairly popular work, "Of weddid men and wifis," represents a rather mild form of Lollardy and, indeed, appears in at least one manuscript well removed from sectarian taint, Westminster School 3. Moreover, only one of the other six manuscripts which contain the work shares further contents with Corpus. If one wonders about the mode by which such a text escapes its original sectarian circulation to enter a wider religious culture, at least one possible answer is that it circulated alone, without sign of its attachment to particularistic views. Such separable circulation would have been facilitated by the existence of the text in loose booklet form, and in fact, "Of weddid men" would fit neatly within a ten-leaf quire of the same format as PKP. But one need not simply speculate about such circulation of bits from the Corpus/Trinity exemplar. For isolated manuscripts share with the two full copies groups of texts, reproduced in the exemplar order. Bodley 647, for example, contains a sequence, found in both manuscripts, of three antifraternal texts (Corpus, items 3-5, pp. 29 b -65 a ). Similarly, Bodley 540 provides two texts which appear consecutively in both manuscripts (Corpus, items 12-13, pp. 145 b -157 b ). 10 And Bodley 938, one of the codices providing "Of weddid men," shares with Corpus and Trinity, although in a different order, three other texts (Corpus, items 14, 15, and 19, pp. 157 b -165 a , 175 b -79 a -very interestingly surrounding but skirting FCL and PKP). Such fragmentary, but usually ordered, parallels look as if they reflect access to individual constituent booklets of the Corpus/Trinity exemplar, as if that codex most normally circulated not as the whole, but the fragment. Moreover, such evidence of partial circulation, by putatively marking off free-circulating portions of the exemplar, can be used to identify other, perhaps separable blocks of text. Although they achieved no circulation visible today, one might tentatively suggest these as booklets in the lost exemplar. Thus the contents which Bodley 647 and Bodley 540 share with Corpus and Trinity bracket an extensive group of items common to these two manuscripts but not reproduced elsewhere. These would appear, on the basis of subject matter (prelates, priests) potentially divisible into two groups, each arguably the material of a fascicle (Corpus, item 6, pp. 65 a -103 b ; items 7-11, pp. 103 b -145 b ). And even the unique contents of Corpus and Trinity are occasionally susceptible of similar analysis. In the original conclusion to Corpus, before the scribe regained access to the full PKP, the lengthy unique text, "Þe grete sentence of curs expouned" (pp. 239 a -288 a ) at least appears potentially a candidate for fascicular circulation. Of the preceding texts not shared with Trinity, I have already suggested that "Of weddid men" may have achieved a relatively wide circulation through a separate booklet. The other two texts in this portion, both unique, are extremely brief and may represent filler copied while awaiting arrival of the much more substantial work. This discussion should help fill in features which have been studied on several occasions by the modern doctor evangelicus of Lollardy, Anne Hudson. 11 Hudson's extensive survey of Lollard trial records has drawn attention to the variety of Lollard book-production: the bishops who sought to extirpate the heresy referred to three specific forms in which such writings were found—"schedulae," "quaterni," and "libri." Ample references to bills or schedules (small parchment sheets or rolls) occur, and full books, like Corpus and Trinity, survive with very great frequency. But to date, Hudson seems to have found but a single "quaternus," a dialogue in a Cosin manuscript at Durham University Library. My discussion should suggest that the bishops' distinction between "libri" and "quaterni" may have been factitious, as is, in many circumstances, any modern distinction between quires and fascicles. Production by such fascicles, comprised of a single "quaternus" or multiple "quaterni," is inscribed in two well-known Lollard codices—and there it was very likely undertaken in an effort at generating yet additional "quaterni" for consumption by a partisan audience. Such production might induce us to examine more thoroughly book-production associated with the origins of Lollardy, the Oxford milieu. 12 For the behavior I have been describing—the use of fascicular exemplars to facilitate multiple and selective copyings of texts deemed canonical in an at least partially dispersed situation—smacks of a procedure one can well imagine in a university environment. In such a situation, the persistent need for numerous copies of various canonical texts should have produced such a system. And given standard medieval complaints about the "penuria studencium," such a production system could well have incorporated exemplar dispersal as well: affordability might best be served by a rule of "each student, his own scribe," with copying proceeding by textual portions lent out to transcribers/readers/owners. But the production-system which underlies Corpus 296 and Trinity 244 differs in one appreciable manner from any putative Oxonian forebearer. The notion of canon at work here remains, for the most part, unfixed: the two Lollard codices, and related manuscripts, testify to an allowed audience selectivity, a possible appeal to a topical interest—that very individuality which underlies heterodox belief itself.</field>

Matthew, English Works of Wyclif Hitherto Unprinted , EETS o.s. 74 (1880, rev. 1902). I refer to "writings we know publicly," since following Anne Hudson, Lollards and their Books (1985), p. 181, something like eighty per cent of the corpus remains unprinted. 2 I cite, respectively, EETS 74:187, and Select English Works , 3:508. 3 I need to acknowledge here that I have never handled Corpus 296, owing to the current Librarian's intractable policy to render American readership well nigh impossible. Montague Rhodes James, as part of his indefatigable efforts at cataloguing Cambridge libraries, published a very helpful description; see A Descriptive Catalogue of the Manuscripts in the Library of Corpus Christi College Cambridge , volume II (1912), pp. 74-75. I am very grateful to a British scholar, who must in the circumstances remain anonymous, for loan of a complete microfilm, which confirms James's observations and on which I base all statements about the codex. I am similarly grateful to the Librarian of Trinity College, Dublin for courteous and generous access to volumes in his care. In an appendix I offer brief descriptions of the two manuscripts central to my argument. 4 See, for example, my description of Bodley 416, at Studies in Bibliography 41 (1988): 211; or of Huntington HM 148, at Mediaeval Studies 49 (1987):434. 5 The break in the Trinity text of PKP occurs at very nearly the same point as the textual disruption in Corpus, but I think this almost certainly accidental. The Trinity copy ends at Arnold's p. 520/17, but in mid-word ("world—"); the conclusion of this word would have appeared on the subsequent lost leaf (the last of a quire). Moreover, the following quire, now lost, if an eight, as most of the remainder of the Trinity manuscript, would have been sufficient to contain the subsequent tracts now extant in Corpus. Following these losses, Trinity resumes in the middle of a text and continues to parallel Corpus in contents for another forty folios. 6 Although I take exception to this particular interpretation of the evidence, I am extremely grateful to Hudson and Vander Meulen for both information and suggestions which have, inevitably sharpened my sense of what I am about here—and hopefully, sharpened my argument as well. 7 For a parallel instance where the scribe should probably be exculpated, cf. John Shirley's unfortunate bout with Chaucer's Boece in British Library, Additional 16165. Shirley apparently never realized that two consecutive quires in his exemplar had been folded backwards (rendering their proper central bifolia their outside bifolia); as a consequence, part of his copy of book 5 contains four large misplaced blocks of text. See Larry D. Benson et al., The Riverside Chaucer , 3rd edn. (1987), p. 1159 (note to 5.m 3). 8 Although a copy of the Latin source survives; I. H. Stein provides an edition at Speculum 7 (1932):87-94. 9 As I argued in "Booklets in Medieval Manuscripts: Further Considerations," Studies in Bibliography 39 (1986):100-111. 10 The two sets of copies in Trinity College, Dublin MS. 246 were made in the sixteenth century, presumably from one of the three extant manuscripts. 11 See "Some Aspects of Lollard Book Production," in Lollards , pp. 181-191, particularly pp. 183-184; and The Premature Reformation (1988), pp. 200-203. For Cosin V.iii.6, see "A Lollard Quaternion," in Lollards , pp. 193-200 (for comments on book-production, see particularly pp. 199-200). 12 The most notable studies of direct ties between Oxford and dispersed Lollard communities include: Hudson, Premature Reformation , pp. 60-81; her article "A Wycliffite Scholar of the Early Fifteenth Century," Studies in Church History , subsidia 4 (1985):301-315; and A. K. McHardy, "The Dissemination of Wyclif's Ideas," Studies in Church History , subsidia 5 (1987):361-368. These studies identify possible suspects, but none has yet attended to Oxford forms of book-production and whether these might provide a model for a text like the Corpus/Trinity exemplar.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">"The Final Revision of Bonduca ": An Unpublished Essay by W. W. GREG by Grace Ioppolo *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The scribal manuscript of John Fletcher's play, Bonduca , written between 1627 and 1637, 1 has long offered textual scholars significant evidence of the manner in which foul and fair copies of a Renaissance play were written. At the beginning of Act 5, the scribe, now identified as Edward Knight, book-keeper of the King's Men, 2 summarizes scenes 1 and 2 and the beginning of scene 3, explaining, "The occasion. why these are wanting here. the booke where by it was first Acted from is lost: and this hath beene transcrib'd from the fowle papers of the Authors w c h were found." 3 The scribe thus informs us that his manuscript has been transcribed from incomplete foul papers; the variants between this text and the 1647 Beaumont and Fletcher Folio text suggest that the latter text was printed from the recovered "booke where by it was first Acted." At the conclusion of his 1925 essay, "Prompt Copies, Private Transcripts, and the "Playhouse Scrivener,'" W. W. Greg considered the evidence of Bonduca (which he thought at that time to have been co-authored by Beaumont and Fletcher), and remarked of the lost original prompt-book which served as the Folio printer's copy: We know that in some instances authors themselves prepared fair copies of their plays, which could then be used for the purposes of the playhouse (e.g. Munday's John a Kent , Massinger's Believe as You List , Daborne's Bellman of London ); but other prompt copies that have come down to us were clearly prepared in the playhouse from rougher drafts supplied by the authors (e.g. Barnavelt , Massinger's Parliament of Love ). To which class did the lost 'originall' of Bonduca belong? The differences between the text of the manuscript and that printed in 1647 suggest that the authors may have prepared their own fair copy, subjecting the play to revision in the process. 4 In his 1925 essay, Greg was not prepared to pursue this line of inquiry about the preparation of the fair copy and the possibility of authorial revision. But in 1931, he again asserted in his Commentary on Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses that a comparison of the two extant texts of Bonduca offered the opportunity to observe revision between the author's rough draft and the final theatrical version. 5 In his 1951 edition of the manuscript of the play for the Malone Society Reprints series, Greg acknowledged that determining whether the revisions were made by Fletcher, whom he then recognized as the sole author, or the scribe who prepared the prompt-book was "one of the critical problems of the play, but lies beyond the present discussion" (MSR, pp. xii-xiii); by 1954 he seemed satisfied with his earlier conclusion that there was no proof that the "appreciable amount of revision" in Bonduca was not done by Fletcher himself. 6 Although he tentatively resolved the question of who was responsible for the revisions in Bonduca , Greg apparently did not settle the question of who was responsible for the preparation of the prompt-book of the play. Also, in none of his published discussions of the texts of Bonduca did he attempt to answer the other question he had posed in 1925 about the class to which the lost original prompt-book belonged, even though he noted at one point that a more detailed investigation into the relation of the manuscript and Folio texts was needed (MSR, p. xi, n. 4). However, Greg had carefully investigated the relation of the two texts, the source of the revisions, and the preparation of the prompt-book in an unpublished essay now in the collections of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. In "The Final Revision of Bonduca ," a 63-page manuscript essay, Greg had posed and answered the question of whether Fletcher himself supplied the revised fair copy of the play which served as the prompt-book for the King's Men. Greg's essay, which he thoroughly corrected and revised, is contained in a pamphlet file (RB 112111 PF) appended to the Hoe-Huntington copy of the 1647 Folio of Beaumont and Fletcher's Comedies and Tragedies . A few months after Sir Walter's death in March, 1959, his wife, Lady Elizabeth Greg, donated the essay, as well as his collations of the manuscript and Folio texts of Bonduca and The Honest Man's Fortune , to the Huntington for the use of scholars (Greg maintained a fifty-year correspondence with the librarians of the Huntington). 7 He apparently wrote the undated essay shortly after his 1925 article on Prompt Copies and Private Transcripts in which he first took up the bibliographic problems of Bonduca . With Greg's essay is a letter dated 25 July 1927 in which A. W. Pollard recommends that either Greg cut the "The Final Revision of Bonduca " for publication in The Library , or use it to prepare an edition of the play. 8 The essay was not printed in The Library or elsewhere, 9 and Greg included very few of its comments about the preparation of the prompt-book in his Introduction to his Malone Society edition of the manuscript. In spite of the extraordinary glimpse into authorial and scribal practice that Bonduca offers, the play's textual history has received attention from only a few scholars besides Greg, most notably, R. C. Bald in 1938, and Cyrus Hoy, who in 1979 was the first to produce an edition of the play based on both the manuscript and Folio texts. 10 Although Greg's unpublished essay on revision in Bonduca may appear outdated in some details, it provides the only in-depth examination of the relationship of the two texts of the play and of Fletcher's handling of the transmission of his text. More importantly, in this essay Greg first explores many of his theories which later became the foundation of modern Shakespearian editing. 11 Therefore, Greg's essay may yet be valuable to scholars engaged in literary and textual criticism of Bonduca or Fletcher in particular, and in general in the continuing controversy about editing possibly revised plays by other Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists, including Shakespeare. 12 In order to present Greg's central arguments in "The Final Revision of Bonduca " here, his minor points have been summarized and only his major points relating to the authorial preparation of the prompt-book have been reproduced in full. Greg was the first scholar to collate both the manuscript and Folio versions of the play; thus much of his essay is concerned with giving parallel transcriptions of variant passages from the two texts. As Cyrus Hoy's edition of the play offers a complete collation of the variants between the texts, those portions of Greg's essay which present these variants have not been reproduced, although the variants have been noted in the context of presenting his main arguments. At the beginning of "The Final Revision of Bonduca ," Greg presents his thesis: he will attempt to reconstruct the original foul papers and the prompt-book of the play by separating scribal and compositorial variants from authorial variants in the manuscript and Folio texts. After dismissing the obvious non-authorial variants, Greg states, we shall be in a position to compare the play as it stood in the rough papers with the text of the playhouse-copy, or in other words we may be able in a general way to determine what alterations were made in the course of the final revision that resulted in the authoritative text of the tragedy. And these should in turn enable us to form an opinion as to whether the preparation of the prompt-copy was the work of the author himself, and perhaps obtain what our literary friends would probably call a peep into Fletcher's workshop. (MS, p. 2) Therefore, Greg plans to examine three main issues: variants in the manuscript arising from scribal error in reading the author's foul papers; variants in the Folio text arising from compositorial error in reading the recovered prompt-copy; and variants between the reconstructed rough draft and prompt-copy due to authorial revision. In the first section of the essay, "The Foul Papers and the Errors of the Scribe," Greg terms the manuscript a "reasonably accurate text compiled by one rather particularly equipped for the task," but finds that the types of errors made by the scribe demonstrate that "the foul papers of Bonduca were not only at times illegible but at others filled with alterations either ambiguous or obscure" (MS, pp. 3-4). Greg begins his discussion of scribal "blunders" by noting the scribe's failure to provide a whole string of speakers' names in 4.2 and his miscopying of a few words which were unfamiliar to him. However, Greg commends the scribe for his "honesty" in usually leaving blank spaces in his manuscript when he could not read his illegible copy, especially at 1.1.119 (135), 1.2.105-108 (347-350), 4.2.74 (1910), 4.3.157 (2079), 5.3.141-145 (2526-2530), and 5.3.163-164 (2560-2561). 13 Greg continues: Once our attention has been drawn, by the frank confession of the scribe, to the difficulty he found in deciphering the foul papers, ample evidence of their obscurity and frequent alteration may be found in numerous passages of obvious corruption in the manuscript. The tempting opportunity thus afforded of catching Fletcher in the very act of composition makes it worthwhile pursuing the matter in some detail, though it is so closely interwoven with the separate question of the final revision that no complete treatment is possible at this stage. (MS, p. 8) Greg cites examples of obscurities and alterations in the foul papers which produced corruptions in the manuscript at 2.1.3 (566), 2.2.50-54 (786-791), 2.4.91-94 (1201-1202), 3.5.46 (1527), 4.4.114-119 (2309-2314), 4.4.156-159 (2361-2365), 5.3.65 (2420), and particularly 5.3.119-131 (2496-2513), the death of Hengo, arguing that this passage is not, primarily, if at all, "a case of revision, but merely of corruption in MS. There is a framework of identical matter in the two texts, but two passages have got displaced in MS., distorting both sense &amp; metre. . . . The natural inference is that there have been additions to the text as originally written &amp; that there was some doubt as to the exact place to which they belonged" (MS, pp. 13-14). Greg later restated these comments about marginal additions in the Introduction to his edition (p. xii), and both R. C. Bald (p. 85) and Cyrus Hoy (p. 152) have similarly suggested that the manuscript of Bonduca offers examples of textual confusion, rather than authorial revision, due to the uncertain placement of some additions. After briefly examining scribal errors due to uncertainty in the insertion of speakers' names in Fletcher's rough draft at such points as 1.1.151-154 (169-173), 1.2.129-131 (382-385), and 4.4.46-48 (2207-2210), Greg follows with "a series of blunders on the part of the scribe for which there seems no very obvious excuse" at 1.1.94 (106), 1.1.108 (123), 1.1.177 (199), 1.2.63 (291), 2.3.99 (1018), 2.3.125-127 (1047-1050), 3.5.116 (1618), and 4.3.16 (1951). Greg concludes this portion of the essay with a discussion of the scribe's summary of the missing scenes in Act 5, noting that the scribe places the funeral of Penyus as the first scene, crosses it out, then describes the scene in which Swetonius mocks Petillius for his role in Penyus' death, and afterwards presents the funeral of Penyus as the next scene (MSR 2368-2380). Greg remarks: Turning to F. we find that the lost scenes are rather more complex than is here indicated, but the remarkable thing about them is that the first &amp; second occur in the reverse order, the funeral preceding the mocking. The scribe's first instinct was right &amp; it was only when he tried to elaborate it that he went wrong. The point is of some importance since it shows that where the foul papers failed him he had only his memory to rely on and was not able to consult a 'plot'. Considering the state of things revealed in the foul papers it may fairly be argued that no one but the author himself could have reduced them to such satisfactory shape as we find in the folio. 14 (MS, pp. 19-20) Greg's final point that only the author could have made the corrections needed between his very rough foul papers and the completed prompt-book which served as copy for the Folio printers becomes the focus for the rest of the essay. In the second section of the essay, "The Prompt Copy and the Errors of the Compositor," Greg concedes that whereas there is no clear evidence of the Folio "having been actually printed from a playhouse manuscript there is I think one feature that points to its close dependence on such an original. This is the printing of a dash in place of anything that might be regarded as an oath." He does not find this feature characteristic of the 1647 Folio as a whole but does cite its occurrence in Bonduca, The Prophetess , and Four Plays in One , three Folio plays set by the same printer who did not restore the censored oaths as the other printers had. 15 Greg argues that although the copy for Bonduca was "probably a playhouse manuscript," it was not subjected to more censorship than the other plays in the Folio (MS, pp. 20-21). Greg then clears "out of the way all variants that may be attributable to the compositor on the one hand and to the scribe [of the prompt-book] on the other" (MS, p. 23), citing probably compositorial or scribal errors at 1.1.48 (57), 1.1.184 (209), 1.2.89 (323), 1.2.111 (353), 2.1.57-58 (628-629), 2.1.113 (696), 2.2.56 (793-794), 2.2.82 (827), 2.3.50 (939), 2.3.59 (961), 2.3.80 (986), 2.3.87 (996-997), 2.3.90 (1001), 2.3.100 (1019), 2.4.61 (1148), 3.5.5 (1467), 3.5.79 (1568), 4.2.56 (1884), 4.3.95 (2029), 4.3.166 (2095), 4.4.76 (2243), 4.4.108-109 (2300-2301). He debates whether some variants suggest authorial revision or corruption rather than compositorial error, including those at 1.1.144 (162), 1.2.257 (523), 2.1.28 (598), 2.1.128-129 (715-716), 3.1.47-50 (1255-1258), 4.4.8 (2162). Finally, Greg finds the use of "you," "ath," "em" or "vm," to be characteristic of the manuscript and the use of "ye," "o'th," and "em" characteristic of the Folio. Greg later noted some of these compositorial variants and manuscript/ Folio characteristics in the Introduction to his 1951 edition of the play (p. xii). In the next section of the essay, "The Stage Directions," Greg suggests that because the stage directions in the foul papers were "meagre and obscure," the manuscript scribe may have revised the original directions in the prompt-copy and thus repeated them when transcribing the manuscript (MS, p. 31). In support of this argument, Greg cites minor variants at 1.1.0 (2-3), 2.2.50 (785), 2.3.66 (963-964), 2.3.116 (1032), 2.3.125 (1046-1049), 2.3.130 (1053), 2.4.31 (1107), 2.4.41 (1119), 3.1.50 (1258), 3.1.75 (1285), 3.5.0 (1461), 3.5.137 (1647), 3.5.141 (1653-1654), 3.5.150 (1666), 3.5.154 (1670-1671), 4.2.31 (1850-1852), 4.2.74 (1910), 4.3.178 (2108), 4.3.197 (2129-2131), 4.4.29 (2189-2192), 5.3.127 (2508-2510), and 5.3.188-189 (2587-2588), and concludes: We cannot be sure that any or indeed all of these directions may not be due to the scribe's imagination or his recollection of the actual performance, but it is at least tempting to suppose that some at least may preserve or be based on notes of the author's own, that were pruned away in preparing the prompt-copy, or perhaps even struck out from it in the course of adapting it for stage use. (MS, p. 35) However, Greg remains uncertain and does not offer any conclusive evidence for this point. The remaining thirty pages of Greg's essay takes up "The Final Revision" by examining those variants which may be due to authorial revision between foul papers and the prompt copy. Greg first sets up the problem in the "abstract": The central point to be borne in mind is that, however the revision was made, it was not made on the foul papers, since ex hypothesi , these bore no trace of it at a date long subsequent to the preparation of the prompt-copy. Either therefore the revision was made in the course of the preparation of the playhouse-copy, or it was made later on playhouse-copy—or, of course, it may have been made partly in the one way and partly in the other. If therefore, we come to the conclusion (i) that the revision shows the hand of the author, and (ii) that it is of a nature unlikely to have been undertaken on a subsequent occasion, we shall be brought to conclude that Fletcher prepared his own fair-copy for the playhouse. (MS, p. 36) Greg's first point that the foul papers showed no sign of revision years after the transcription of the prompt-book has not been made by any other editor or critic of Bonduca . Greg's last point allows him to argue further that both classes of variants, indifferent and substantive, were introduced in the course of preparing the fair copy, rather than during a revision of the play for revival: "Except possibly in a single scene, there is hardly anything important enough to suggest that the play was ever overhauled for a revival: not much one would say of sufficient importance to justify the defacing of the promptbook for its introduction" (MS, p. 37). These second-thought revisions made during Fletcher's fair transcription of his foul papers, marks of "textual instability" as E. A. J. Honigmann later came to term them, 16 may stand side by side with other alterations made by another scribe or playhouse reviser, according to Greg. Greg assigns little "weight" to such indifferent authorial variants as those at 1.2.23 (243), 2.2.66 (805), and 4.1.41 (1757) and questions those "individually slight" variants involving a change of the article at 1.1.103 (117), 1.2.145 (401), 1.2.165 (426), 1.2.205 (467), 4.2.45 (1868), 4.2.88 (1928-1929), 4.4.40 (2199), and 4.4.44 (2320), in which "the consistent superiority of F. suggests revision" (MS, p. 39). Greg examines other variants which demonstrate the idiosyncrasies of manuscript and Folio copy at 1.1.134 (151), 2.1.20 (706), and 3.1.83 (1297). He attributes at least three variants, 1.1.87 (99), 1.2.62 (290), 2.1.70 (646), to the hand of the censor; Greg also noted these examples of censorship in the Introduction to his edition of Bonduca (p. xii). These and other puzzling minor variants at 1.1.7 (10), 1.1.37 (45), 1.1.99 (113), 1.2.109 (351), 1.2.156 (412), 2.3.136 (1062), 2.4.46 (1127), 2.4.86 (1191), 3.3.13 (1424), 3.5.109 (1609), 4.2.53-54 (1880-1881), 4.3.26 (1961-1962), 4.3. 197-200 (2131-2134), and 5.3.137-138 (2521-2522) lead Greg to conclude that the alterations are sometimes in the direction of the remoter, more definite, and forcible, sometimes in that of the more obvious, vaguer, and less emphatic, but in either case the change seems to have been made with taste and judgment; having regard to the context. The numerous variants not cited are, I think, generally of the same character. To my mind at least they speak strongly of the hand of the author. Even when directly dictated by stage considerations, they are rather too subtle to be credited to a playhouse adapter, nor does it seem likely that such an agent would have troubled to make them. (MS, p. 44) In arguing for authorial revision in Beaumont and Fletcher's The Maid's Tragedy , Robert K. Turner also cites minor variants to make much the same point as Greg has made here. Turner states that "some conscious and deliberate change probably took place in these instances, and it is unlikely that anyone but an author would have troubled himself over such minor matters." 17 Greg's strongest arguments for Fletcher having prepared the fair copy which served as the prompt-book of Bonduca appear in his examination of eleven major variants. Thus his citation of these eleven passages and his conclusions as to what they demonstrate about Fletcher's composition practices are reproduced in full here. 18 Greg begins: "The major variants will need to be examined individually and in detail, since they afford, of course, the main body of evidence upon which our conclusions must rest. There are eleven of them. 1. [1.1.69-78; MSR 79-88] Ten times a night I have swom the Rivers . . . and still to try these Romanes , whom I found (and if I lye, my wounds be henceforth backward, and be you witnesse, gods, and all my dangers) as ready, and . . . as valiant . . . MS. reverses the order of the lines within brackets. The parenthesis is in any case of awkward length, and the two lines are curiously parallel. It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that they were alternatives in the rough copy that have got in inverse order into the two transcripts. If so, it must be admitted to be hardly the mistake one would expect of an author. 2. [2.3.58-66; MSR 958-964] The speakers are Caratach &amp; Hengo (who enters): Car. Sit down poor knaves: why where's this wine and victuals? who waites there? Suit. within . Sir, 'tis coming. Hen. Who are these Uncle? Car. They are Romans, Boy. Hen. Are these they that vex mine Aunt so? can these fight? they look like emptie scabbards, all, no mettle in 'em, like men of clouts, set to keep crows from orchards; why, I dare fight with these. Car. That's my good chicken. And how do ye? how do you feel your stomacks? MS. omits the first two of these speeches ( Car. Sit . . . coming'.), in their place, and in place of the last has the following: Cara : thates my good chicken. sitt downe poore knaves. why wheres this wine and victualls. who waightes there. w th in : sir, tis com͂ing. Cara : and how doe you. how doe you feele your stomackes.--- Enter: w th wine / &amp; Meate: No wholly satisfactory arrangement of the lines is possible. But it will be observed that in F. the metrical structure is impossible both at the beginning &amp; end of the passage. In MS. 'thates my good chicken' completes the line 'why I dare fight with these' [above F, not MS.], and by bringing 'sir tis coming' into conjunction with 'and how doe you', continuity both of sense &amp; verse is secured. 19 This points to Hengo's interruption (' Heng . Who are . . . chicken') having been in the rough draft an insertion the exact portion of which was doubtful. It is itself metrical except for one broken line. MS. adopts the arrangement which avoids disturbing the metre, and is therefore presumably original: on the other hand it may well be argued that F.'s arrangement is dramatically more effective, and was perhaps adopted in revision. 3. [2.3.95-113; MSR 1008-1029] This is a very similar case in the same scene. The speakers are as before, with Judas and the Younger Daughter: Jud. Delicate Captain, to doe thee a sufficient recompence, I'll knock thy brains out. Car. Do it. Hen. Thou dar'st as well be damn'd: there knock his brains out, thou skin of man? Uncle, I will not hear this. Jud. Tie up your whelp. Hen. Thou kill my [MS. noble] Uncle? Would I had but a sword for thy sake, thou dry'd dog. Car. What a mettle} [ one line in MS. ] this little vermine caries.} Hen. Kill mine Uncle? Car. He shall not, child. Hen. He cannot: he's a Rogue, an onely eating Rogue: Kill my sweet Uncle? oh that I were a man. Jud. By this wine, which I will drink to Captain Junius , who loves the Queens most excellent Majesties little daughter most sweetly, and most fearfully, I will do it. Hen. Uncle, I'll kill him with a great [ om. MS ] pin, Car. No more, Boy. I'll pledge thy Captain: To ye all, good Fellows. 2 Daugh. In love with me? that love shall cost your lives all. MS. places Judas's speech, 'By this wine . . . I will do it', immediately after Caratach's 'Do it'. Both the metre &amp; the verbal echo prove that these two speeches should follow one another. On the other hand the arrangement in MS. is dramatically impossible since it separates Judas's allusion to Junius from Bonvica's comment. The whole of the passage, ' Hen. Thou dar'st as well . . . Oh that I were a man', is clearly an addition—and a very unnecessary addition—in the rough draft, which cannot be forced anywhere into the original text without damage. It has two broken lines: 'What a mettle' (F.'s division is correct) and 'oh that I were a man'. 4. [4.2.62-70; MSR 1893-1904] Speakers Hengo and Judas: Heng. When, Sir? I long to kill thee; come, thou canst not scape me, I have twenty ways to charge thee; twenty deaths attend my bloody staff. Iud. Sure 't is the devil, a dwarf, devil in a doublet. Heng. I have kill'd a Captain, sirha, a brave Captain, and when I have done, I have kickt him thus. Look here, see how I charge this staff. Iud. Most certain this boy will cut my throat, yet. In MS. the passage stands: Hen : when. I have twenty wayes to charge thee. twenty deaths. I long to eate thee. come thou canst not scape me. attend my bloody staffe: I have killd a captaine sirra, a braue captaine. &amp; when I have done I have kickt him thus. [look here, deleted ]. Iud : sure tis the devill the damnd devill in a dublett. Hen : looke here. see how I shake this staffe. Iud : most certaine the boy will cutt my throte yet. It is clear that the arrangement in F. is unsatisfactory from the metrical point of view, but that of MS. is at least as bad. The slip which the scribe made at the end of the first speech shows that the line was originally continuous in the rough draft as in F. It follows that Judas's first speech, 'sure . . . dublett', was a marginal addition of uncertain position. I imagine that the words 'sirra, a brave captain' are another interpolation, &amp; that at the end the draft originally read 'it is most certain'. If so it began by being metrical. That as it finally stood it was much confused is further shown by the scribe's absurd inversion of the second &amp; third lines. The changes from 'eate thee' to 'kill thee' and from 'the damnd devill' to 'a dwarf-devil' (as it should presumably stand) and from 'shake' to 'charge' were made in revision. 5. [4.3.30-52; MSR 1966-1985] Petillius meets Regulus &amp; Drusus, who are attending on Penyus: Petill. Good morrow, Gentlemen; where's the Tribune? Reg. There. Dru. Whence come ye, good Petillius ? Petill. From the General. Dru. With what, for heavens sake? Petill. With good counsel, Drusus , and love, to comfort him. Dru. Good Regulus step to the souldier, and allay his anger; for he is wilde as winter. Exeunt Drusus and Regulus . Petill. O, are ye there? have at ye. Sure he's dead, it cannot be he dare out-live this fortune: he must die, 't is most necessary; men expect it; and thought of life in him, goes beyond coward. Forsake the field so basely? fie upon't: so poorly to betray his worth? so coldly to cut all credit from the souldier? sure if this man mean to live, as I should think it beyond belief, he must retire where never the name of Rome, the voice of Arms, or Honour was known or heard of yet: he's certain dead, or strongly means it; he's no Souldier else, no Romane in him; all he has done, but outside, fought either drunk or desperate. Now he rises. How does Lord Penyus ? Pen. As ye see. Petill. I am glad on't; continue so still. The Lord General, the valiant General, great Swetonius --- Divergence begins with the third speech of Drusus, MS. reading: and loue to comfort him. Drus : I feare thy nature and will not be far of. good Regulus step to the soldier. and allay his anger. for he is wild as winter. Regu : Ile doe my best. and when occasion offers. call. Drus : I will: --- Exeunt: Regulus. &amp; Drusus: petill : how does lord penius . peni : sure he mockes me. petill : sir. how doe ye. peni : as you see sir. petill : the lord Generall the valiant Generall great Swetonius . Here there has evidently been extensive revision, consisting of the elimination of Drusus's apparent suspicion of Petillius, and the introduction of the latter's soliloquy before he addresses Penyus. MS. is metrical (allowing for a redundant vocative) but requires some slight rearrangement, thus: Petill. How does lord Penius? Peni. Sure, he mocks me! Petill. Sir, How doe ye? Peni. As you see [sir]. Petill. Th'lord Generall . . . F. is likewise metrical, but it is to be observed that the revision leaves a broken line at the exit. Fletcher's hand is evident. 6. [4.3.72-82; 2005-2013] The same scene: yet durst doubt, and be damned. Petill. It was an errour. Pen. A foul one, and a black one. Petill. Yet the blackest may be washt white again. Pen. Never. Petill Your leave, Sir, and I beseech ye note me; for I love ye, and bring along all comfort: Are we gods, alli'd to no infirmities? are our natures more then mens natures? when we slip a little out of the way of vertue, are we lost? is there no medicine called Sweet mercie? Pen. None, Petillius ; there is no mercie in mankinde can reach me, nor is it fit it should; I have sinn'd beyond it. The corresponding passage in MS. runs: yet durst doubt. and be damnd. petill : that was an error. peni : a fowle one; ô a black one. petill : It may be cur'd though. peni : never with credit petill : now ye are ith right on't. peni : I am ith right: I knowe petillius , there is no mercy in mankinde can reach me, nor is it fit it should. I have sind beyond it. This, though rather rough, is metrical: so is F. if we allow the redundant vocative 'Petillius'. The passage has been considerably amplified in revision, evidently by the author. 7. [4.3.86-87; MSR 2018-2021] Still the same scene: to be so stupid, to arrive at pardon. Petill. O but the General--- Pen. He's a brave Gentleman. . . Here MS. has: to be so stupid to arrive at pardon. petill : O but the Generall . the noble Generall . you doe not knowe sir. peni : Is a braue gentleman . . . We have in F. judicious pruning which leaves the metre unaffected. 8. [4.3.97-113; MSR 2031-2034] Again the same: Petill. What would ye do? Pen. Die. Petill. So would sullen children, women that want their wils, slaves, disobedient, that fear the law, die. Fie, great Captain; you a man to rule men, to have thousand lives under your regiment, and let your passion betray your reason? I bring you all forgivenesse, the noblest kinde commends, your place, your honour. Pen. Prethee no more; 't is foolish: didst not thou? by-----thou didst, I over-heard thee, there, there where thou standst now, deliver me for rascal, poor, dead, cold coward, miserable, wretched, if I out-liv'd this ruine? Petill. I? Pen. And thou didst it nobly, like a true man, a souldier: and I thank thee, I thank thee, good Petillius ; thus I thank thee. Petill. Since ye are so justly made up, let me tell ye 'tis fit ye die indeed. Pen. O how thou lovest me! Petill. For say he had forgiven ye;say the peoples whispers . . . This long passage is represented in MS. by four lines only: petill : since ye are so Iustly made vp, let me tell ye nor is it fit you should. ye foole yo r waight in't. breake yo r owne groundes of rule, that have cõmande, nay say he had sir. say the peoples whispers . . . The expansion is rather loose in places, metrically, but of a piece with the rest, and clearly Fletcher's. 9. [4.3.118-119; MSR 2039-2042] Yet the same; Petillius is speaking: must not these kill ye? Say they are won to pardon ye . . . MS. reads: must not these kill you. dare you stay so long penius . peni : honest captaine petill : say they are wun to pardon you . . . Pruning again, and I think judicious, for the force of 'so long' is not as clear as it might be. 10. [4.3.129-141; MSR 2053-2059] This is the last of the many alterations in this scene: Pen. No, by no means: I am onely thinking now, Sir, (for I am resolved to go) of a most base death, fitting the basenesse of my fault. I'll hang, Petill. Ye shall not; y'are a Gentleman I honour, I would else flatter ye, and force ye live, which is far baser. Hanging? 't is a dogs death, an end for slaves. Pen. The fitter for my basenesse. Petill. Besides, the man that's hang'd, preaches his end, and sits a signe for all the world to gape at. Pen. That's true: I'll take a fitter poison. Petill. No, 't is equal ill; the death of rats and women, lovers, and lazie boys, that fear correction. Die like a man. Pen. Why my sword then. Petill. I, if your sword be sharp, Sir . . . MS. has merely: peni : no. by no meanes. I am only thinking now sir. for I am resolued to goe. of a most base death. fitting the basenes of my faulte. petill : by no meanes: that were abhominable. and wolld still showe you poorer and poorer. peni : why then my sword petillius . petill : I. if yo r sword be sharpe sir . . . It is possible that at this point the rough draft was obscure or in confusion, for the MS. version is in part not verse at all. The F. version, much expanded, is metrical, but ends with a broken line. 11. [5.3.196-201]: Swet. Petillius , you have shown much worth this day, redeem'd much errour, ye have my love again, preserve it. Junius , with you I make him equall in the Regiment. Jun. The elder and the nobler: I'll give place, Sir, Swet. Ye shew a friends soul. There is nothing in MS. corresponding to this passage which (with two broken lines) was inserted in the course of revision. This is clear from the fact that the lines immediately preceding, like the final couplet that follows, rime. When he came to his final revision Fletcher evidently found that he had forgotten to round off the Petillius affair. It is a remarkable fact that more than half the major revisions occur in the scene in which Petillius persuades Penyus to commit suicide, and it shows the close attention which the author bestowed upon what must certainly have been the most difficult scene in the play to convey to the audience. It is not possible to say for certain whether these alterations were made later, as a result of actual experience on the boards, or in the course of preparing the fair-copy. The former is quite conceivable: on the other hand the MS. version of no. 10 really reads more like a rough note for a speech than anything Fletcher can have seriously intended to stand. The other major revisions rather suggest to my mind alterations made in course of transcription, except the first in which it would appear that alternative readings have perhaps been preserved. Taken in conjunction with the minor revisions previously discussed, the evidence certainly seems to incline to the idea of transcriptional rather than independent revision, and therefore to the view that the author prepared his own fair-copy. This provisional conclusion would of course be invalidated if it could be shown that there are any substantial errors, or any considerable number of minor slips, common to the two texts. It is certain that errors of a sort, namely of metrical division, do so occur. It may have been noticed that in variant no. 10 above, the first line is intolerably clumsy. The passage stands thus in F. [4.3.127-129; MSR 2051-2053]: there is a mercy for each fault, if tamely a man will take't upon conditions. Pen. No, by no means: I am onely thinking now, Sir . . . MS. has the same arrangement; yet it is obvious that the 'No', uttered by Penyus belongs metrically to the preceding line. Such errors of division, however, if errors they are to be called, occur not seldom in autograph manuscripts, and afford no evidence for denying the hand of the author. This could only be done by producing mistakes of a more substantial kind" (MS, pp. 44-58). Greg concludes his study of manuscript and Folio variants by examining nine editorial changes made by Rev. Alexander Dyce in his 1844 edition, based solely on the Folio text, at 1.1.100 (114), 1.2.17 (237), 1.2.214 (478), 1.2.236 (501), 2.1.42 (613), 3.2.28 (1334), 3.2.68 (1382), 3.5.29 (1502), and 4.3.185 (2118). Because Greg finds that these Folio readings have manuscript support, he rejects Dyce's proposed emendations and cautions that "the scribe of the playhouse manuscript, whoever he was, understood the author's intention a good deal better than the modern editors have done" (MS, p. 63). At the end of "The Final Revision of Bonduca ," Greg draws two conclusions which he was to repeat thirty years later in his study of the Shakespeare First Folio: firstly, that an author may have been required to turn over foul papers to the acting company to prevent "double dealing," i. e., the sale of the original copy to a rival company; secondly that an author's foul papers would ordinarily contain alterations, including deletions, interlinings and false starts. 20 Greg finally remarks in this unpublished essay: "If it be thought that I have succeeded in establishing a presumption that the prompt-copy of Bonduca was prepared from the foul papers by Fletcher himself, then there is one point which I should like to emphasize here, though I have mentioned it before in another article. It is the very remarkable fact that when the King's men took delivery of the piece they were not content with receiving the fair-copy which might serve as prompt book, but apparently insisted on the author handing over, and upon the book-keeper preserving, the rough draft of the play as well. This is a detail of playhouse organization that may not be without important bearing upon bibliographical criticism. "One point I think our investigation has established beyond question. Fletcher's rough draft was anything but faultless. 'What ever I have seene of Mr. Fletchers owne hand,' wrote his publisher in 1647, 'is free from interlining; and his friends affirme he never writ any one thing twice: it seemes he had that rare felicity to prepare and perfect all first in his owne braine; to shape and attire his Notions , to adde or loppe off, before he committed one word to writing, and never touched pen till all was to stand as firme and immutable as if ingraven in Brasse or Marble.' When he wrote these words there can be no doubt that Moseley had in mind these used by the first editors of Shakespeare: 'His mind and hand went together: And what he thought, he vttered with that easinesse, that wee haue scarse receiued from him a blot in his papers.' Mr. Pollard has somewhere 21 remarked that if this statement is supposed to have any value it must be taken to refer to the original drafts of Shakespeare's plays &amp; not to fair copies. That the latter should be free from alteration might be evidence of the author's neatness or patience or conscientious care, but never of his ready invention. There is no escaping from Mr. Pollard's logic, and Moseley's statements are even more precise. Yet it is abundantly manifest that the foul papers of Bonduca were full of alterations &amp; revisions, often untidily made, and that further revision took place in the preparation of the fair copy. We can positively assert that Moseley's representations are quite untrue. And I for one do not for one moment believe that Shakespeare's foul papers were any exception to the general rule" (MS, p. 63). Many of the specific arguments that Greg presented by 1927 about Fletcher's composition practices in Bonduca anticipated those of R. C. Bald in 1938. In discussing censorship in the Folio text, Bald cited many of the same examples of expurgated oaths; the theatrical nature of the stage directions in F similarly convinced him that this text was derived from a prompt-book; the types of variants between the manuscript and prompt-copy suggested to him either revision or authorial "afterthoughts" during the transcription of the fair copy (pp. 73, 78-79, 58). Bald also cited the major variants that constitute Greg's examples 2-6 and 8-10 to demonstrate cases of textual confusion due to authorial revisions written in the margin or on inserted slips of paper. 22 Cyrus Hoy similarly concluded that the foul papers of Bonduca gave the scribe trouble, and that a comparison of the manuscript and Folio texts shows signs of revision in the Folio, particularly, as Greg noted, in the portion of 4.3 between Penyus and Petillius, and in the extra six lines in 5.3 (pp. 151-152). However, neither Hoy nor Bald raised the question of the preparation of the prompt-book which served as copy for the Folio. Scholars who have studied other plays by Fletcher, with reference to his early writing partner, Francis Beaumont, have followed Greg in their line of argument about the relation between manuscripts and early printed texts, echoing his two important conclusions about Bonduca , namely that Fletcher produced foul papers full of alterations that were difficult to decipher; and that the revised fair copy served as prompt-book and later as printer's copy. For example, Robert K. Turner suggested that the high incidence of misreadings in the Folio text of The Tragedy of Valentinian may result from "a number of ill-written changes which could not be entirely deciphered by the compositors or difficulties on the part of the scribe in making out Fletcher's draft." 23 Fletcher may have transcribed fair copies of his plays other than Bonduca , including Monsieur Thomas and Women Pleased . 24 Either Beaumont or Fletcher may have prepared the fair copy which lay behind Quarto 2 of The Maid's Tragedy and Quarto 1 of The Scornful Lady . 25 Beaumont may have written the fair copies which served as printer's copy for the first Quarto texts of The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn 26 and Cupid's Revenge , which he co-wrote with Fletcher. 27 Beaumont, Fletcher, and Massinger may have each produced fair copy transcripts of their portions of The Tragedy of Thierry and Theodoret . 28 In addition to producing fair copies, Beaumont and Fletcher may have routinely revised their plays; modern editors have discussed possible authorial revision in The Maid's Tragedy, A Wife for a Month, Philaster, The Woman Hater, A King and No King, The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn, Cupid's Revenge, The Noble Gentleman , and The Tragedy of Valentinian . 29 Throughout his career, Greg returned to the evidence provided by Bonduca about the nature of Renaissance foul papers, fair copies, prompt-books, and printer's copy, whether he was discussing playhouse scriveners in 1925, dramatic documents in 1931, editorial problems in 1942, or the printing of the Shakespeare First Folio in 1955. Although R. C. Bald asserted that Bonduca "provides authentic examples of author's revision more definitely and frequently" than any of the other plays in the Beaumont and Fletcher 1647 Folio (pp. 83-84), the real value of the texts of the play may not lie in their examples of revision but in their illumination of the way in which an author himself handled the transmission of his text. Fredson Bowers has written that "logical thinking, great thoroughness, and always an original turn of mind operating on the frontiers of knowledge marked Greg's work throughout his life." 30 In this unpublished essay on the final revision of Bonduca we can again recognize these qualities in the work of Walter Wilson Greg.</field>

Greg first made this statement in the 1942 first edition of this book. 7 Lady Elizabeth Greg's letter, dated 11 July 1959, to the Huntington Librarian reads: "Dear Sir: Professor F. P. Wilson of Merton College, Oxford is Literary Executor for my late husband Sir Walter Greg, and he has been helping me to pick out works which he thinks may be acceptable to various people &amp; Libraries as tokens of remembrance of my late husband &amp; his work. I am sending you these facsimiles &amp; manuscript in the hope that you will care to accept them as such. I am sincerely, Elizabeth Greg" (HEH Inst. Arch. 33.1.7.4. FL. 28). I wish to thank Thomas V. Lange, the Associate Curator of Early Printed Books at the Huntington Library, for providing me with information about the acquisition of Greg's essay. 8 A. W. Pollard's letter reads in part, "I am conscious that I haven't been able to do justice to your paper, but it certainly throws light on what scribes &amp; authors &amp; compositors may respectively have done in a given case. The point I have not sufficiently disentangled is as to how much you have introduced for the elucidation of Bonduca as contrasted with what has a wider applicability. From the point of view of the reader as well as of the Editor of a magazine, the length is rather daunting. I've never read Bonduca ; if it is a decently good play &amp; worth printing, I am inclined to think a lot of your matter would come better as notes to an edition. Between this &amp; the end of October when I shall be making up the December Library , you might consider whether you could get Oxford to print the play, &amp; write an article in The Library , which would call attention to the Edition only presenting your general conclusions without so much detail. This is all I can suggest at present, but The Library is so heavily indebted to you for your help that you may be sure it will do its best to print anything you want printed" (HEH RB 112111 PF). 9 Greg did not include "The Final Revision of Bonduca " in either of the two lists of his writings which he prepared (printed in The Library , 4th ser., 26 [1945] and 5th ser., 15 [1960]), but these were of his published writings only. 10 See R. C. Bald, Bibliographical Studies in the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647 (Oxford University Press, 1938), and Hoy, pp. 151-259. 11 Many of Greg's theories have lately been re-examined. For a discussion of the modern categorization of manuscripts and printer's copy, see Gary Taylor's General Introduction to William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion , by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor with John Jowett and William Montgomery (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987), p. 10 ff. 12 For a discussion of some current trends in editing Shakespearian plays which may have been authorially revised, see David Bevington, "Determining the Indeterminate: The Oxford Shakespeare," Shakespeare Quarterly , 38 (1987), 501-519. 13 All act-scene-line references are to Cyrus Hoy's edition of Bonduca (his collation of the texts appears on pages 249-259); the corresponding lines in Greg's MSR edition of the manuscript are given in parentheses. 14 Greg has added the last sentence in pencil in the manuscript. 15 In support of this point, Greg refers readers in this essay to his article, "The Printing of the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647," The Library , 4th ser., 2 (1921), 109-115. 16 Honigmann argues that an author's first draft may show indifferent and substantive variants when compared with a draft with "second thoughts" made soon afterwards and before delivery to the actors. These two "unstable" drafts represent "not so much a fastidious author's determined attempts to improve passages that fail to satisfy as an author so unconceited with himself and so fluent that little verbal changes, not necessarily always for the better, ran quite freely from his pen when the process of copying refired his mind" ( The Stability of Shakespeare's Text [London: Edward Arnold, Ltd, 1965], pp. 2-3). 17 Robert K. Turner, Textual Introduction, The Maid's Tragedy , in The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon , Vol. 2, p. 22 ( Dramatic Works hereafter cited as DWBF ). 18 As Greg's reproduction of the following passages in his unpublished essay is sometimes incorrect, I have reproduced the Folio passages as they appear in Greg's photostatic copy of the 1647 Folio text (now in the Huntington Library rare book collection) and the manuscript passages as they appear in his 1951 MSR edition (Greg renders all commas in the manuscript as periods in the MSR edition). 19 Greg noted in the margin of this passage that he had erred in originally assigning to MS. the completion of the line "why I dare fight with these" with "thates my good chicken." 20 Greg, The Shakespeare First Folio (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955), pp. 107-110. Greg had also made these points in The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (1942), pp. 27-30. 21 Greg has footnoted in pencil, "Where was it?" in the manuscript, with the inked response, " Shakespeare's Fight with the Pirates , 2nd ed. (1920), p. 60." 22 Bald, pp. 84-89. Bald also cited the variants at 2.4.91-94, 5.3.124-127 and 5.3.129-131 which Greg had cited earlier in his essay (Greg had at first also included the passage at 2.4.91-94 in his discussion of major variants but deleted it, perhaps after he realized that he had already discussed this passage in his section on "The Foul Papers and the Errors of the Scribe"). 23 Robert K. Turner, Textual Introduction, The Tragedy of Valentinian , in DWBF , Vol. 4, p. 274. 24 Hans Walter Gabler concludes of the 1639 Quarto of Monsieur Thomas that "the absence of directions and notations of an exclusively theatrical nature and the presence in high proportion of Fletcherian linguistic forms according to Cyrus Hoy's classification suggests authorial papers as printer's copy, further defined as a fair copy in Fletcher's hand by the virtually error-free verse lining" (Textual Introduction, Monsieur Thomas , in DWBF , Vol. 4, p. 418). Gabler draws the same conclusions about the Folio printer's copy for Women Pleased : "The proximity in transmission of the copy-text to a fair copy in the author's hand is suggested by the general cleanness of the text and its arrangement—there is little corruption to be emended in the words, the verse-lining, or the verse/prose division—as well as by the marked incidence of Fletcherian forms such as the ' em and ye colloquialisms" (Textual Introduction, Women Pleased , in DWBF , Vol. 5, p. 443). 25 Robert K. Turner argues of The Maid's Tragedy that "although there is little direct evidence to show that either Beaumont or Fletcher made a fair copy which lay behind Q2 and even less to indicate which of the two performed the task, an authorial transcript seems the best choice among the possible alternatives; and the failure of Fletcher's linguistic practices to force their way into the passages found only in Q2 allows the inference that Beaumont was the transcriber" (Textual Introduction, The Maid's Tragedy , in DWBF , Vol. 2, p. 20). Similarly, of The Scornful Lady , Cyrus Hoy states that "whether the manuscript behind Q1 was prepared by one of the dramatists (if either, it is more likely to have been Beaumont, in view of the scarcity of Fletcher's famous ye 's), or, as seems somewhat more likely, by a scribe, the quarto print exhibits a number of features, specifically with reference to stage-directions, that are more likely to be traceable to an authorial manuscript or a transcript thereof, than to a manuscript that had been prepared for use in the theatre" (Textual Introduction, The Scornful Lady , in DWBF , Vol. 2, p. 456). 26 Fredson Bowers conjectures that certain textual variants between Q and F of The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn result either from a reworked manuscript behind Q, or from the fact that "Beaumont himself wrote out the printer's copy manuscript for Q and in the process made a few improvements in the theatrical form of the text" (Textual Introduction, The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn , in DWBF , Vol. 1, pp. 120-121). 27 Fredson Bowers concludes of the copy for the Folio text of Cupid's Revenge : "That Beaumont may have copied out the play, revising it in the process from the combined foul papers in order to produce a copy suitable for submission to the theatre company, is a hypothesis that the general uniformity of the accidentals save for the noted compositorial characters appears to support, especially since Fletcher's individual linguistic preferences are obscured" (Textual Introduction, Cupid's Revenge , in DWBF , Vol. 2, p. 324). 28 Robert K. Turner finds that certain features of Quarto 1 of The Tragedy of Thierry and Theodoret "suggest that the underlying manuscript consisted of the authors' papers, possibly fair copies by each" (Textual Introduction, The Tragedy of Thierry and Theodoret , in DWBF , Vol. 3, p. 368). 29 For a discussion of revision by Beaumont and Fletcher in these plays, see the Textual Introduction and Notes to DWBF , Vols. 1-6; also see A King and No King , ed.

      <field name="heading_text">The Problem of Semi-Substantive Variants: An Example from the Shakespeare-Fletcher Henry VIII by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our penchant these days for popularized modern texts of the Elizabethan drama without apparatus has in some part concealed a worrisome problem felt most keenly by the original-text, or old-spelling, editor. This problem concerns not only the degree but also the kind of editorial interference with the 'accidentals' of the original, particularly with the punctuation, that is required if a critical reading edition and not a simple diplomatic transcript is to be formulated. This latter is no longer fashionable save for early dramatic manuscripts, but the old-spelling reading edition is comparatively alive and well. The attention needed to clean up the usual carelessly printed dramatic text is not confined to the accidentals, of course. The more important editorial function remains the emendation of the substantives, or words, the basic building blocks in the transfer of meaning. Nevertheless, although similar problems posed by ambiguity or error in textual accidentals are constantly encountered in the editing of early dramatic texts, they have been subject to less critical attention than questions of corrupt wording on which any reader may form a personal opinion, whether impressionistically or logically derived. Indeed, by this time for Shakespeare—except perhaps in the sometimes erratic new Oxford edition—the number of editorial disagreements among the substantives is not very large for most single-text plays. In contrast, the usually hidden editorial disagreements about meaningful accidentals are more frequent though less recognized; hence, paradoxically, what I call semi-substantives are now of more editorial moment than words as we slowly progress toward a general consensus about Shakespearean texts. 1 The editor of an old-spelling Elizabethan play needs to come to terms at the start with the problem of faulty or inadequate punctuation, this being his chief concern among the accidentals. His is a delicate operation. In Renaissance texts dramatic punctuation can vary widely between play and play, printing shop and shop, compositor and compositor, and certainly date and date. Some early texts are unevenly over-punctuated, generally by the imposition of artificial rules; others may be too lightly pointed for normal recognition of the syntax and its meaning without close study. Most plays are mixed. The editor of a modernized text confronts only the problem of enforcing his concept of present-day syntactical punctuation on the sometimes alien rhetorical system of the original. The imposed style will change according to the era of the new edition and the flair of the editor, and in that sense 'modernized' is at best a comparative term. Before the turn of the century, and for some years after, a heavy and conventional system was the norm, marked by scrupulous setting-off by commas of any word, phrase, or clause that seemed to the slightest degree parenthetical or appositive. And it was a curse of the time to sprinkle quite uncharacteristic exclamation marks liberally throughout the text, so much so, in fact, that one character could scarcely say good morning to another without making it an exclamation. 2 Those days are fortunately gone although their memory may linger still when a marked-up text is insufficiently purged. Indeed, there is no guarantee that whatever system a modernizing editor adopts will not in its turn lose its contemporaneous feel and eventually join the ranks of the old-fashioned. That is not a problem I am addressing at the moment, however. (One need only remark that a modernizing editor is advised to use a light punctuation system that best maintains the flow of the verse, as likely to be the longer lasting. 3 ) Moreover, an attempt to mix purely syntactical alterations with remnants of the old rhetorical system may be confusing to a reader accustomed to a strictly modern texture. A modernizing editor is expected to modernize albeit with discretion in those numerous cases when the older syntax resists the imposition of contemporary standards and some compromise is needed. The problem facing an old-spelling, or original-text, editor differs materially. The reader of such a text is necessarily in some part sophisticated in the ways of Elizabethan spelling, grammar, syntax, and punctuation and therefore can follow with comparative ease the intent of non-syntactical pointing when it is itself not only faithful to its period but also relatively consistent in its terms. When we consider, for example, the relative weight of the semicolon and colon, the following passage from Shakespeare and Fletcher's Henry VIII 4 causes no problem: My good Lord Archbishop, I'm very sorry To sit heere at this present, and behold That Chayre stand empty: But we all are men In our natures fraile, and capable Of our flesh, few are Angels; out of which frailty [3060] And want of wisedome, you that best should teach us, Have misdemean'd your selfe, and not a little: Toward the King first, then his Lawes, in filling The whole Realme, by your teaching and your chaplaines (For so we are inform'd) with new opinions, [3065] Divers and dangerous; which are Heresies; And not reform'd, may prove pernicious. V.ii.42-53 (TLN 3056-67) An accustomed reader is not misled by the lack of punctuation after 'men' (TLN 3058) or by the comma after 'flesh' (TLN 3060), which syntactically should be a period or rhetorically a semicolon or colon. The semicolons after 'dangerous' and 'Heresies' (3066) only increase the emphasis. To modern readers expecting the syntax to indicate the meaning, the heavy colon after 'little' (3062) partly obscures the fact that 'Toward the King' (3063) is not the start of a new clause (unless one were to imagine a massive ellipsis) but instead a prepositional phrase modifying the verb 'have misdemean'd'. However, although the punctuation may perhaps reflect a compositorial misunderstanding, actually the colon is effective rhetorically before the specification of the misdemeanor and would not be misleading to the sense except for the most literal minded. 5 Thus in an old-spelling text the punctuation in this passage should remain undisturbed. Nevertheless, occasional problems arise when conventions of punctuation sometimes met with in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries clash with the rhetorical flow of meaning and thus tend to cancel out the effectiveness for modern comprehension of less structural pointing. One such is the tendency among compositors to place a comma almost automatically at the end of a verse-line. Ordinarily only slight harm (if any) may be done by this convention even though it may obscure the syntactical relationship of run-on lines. 6 More annoyingly, a convention that the caesural pause in a pentameter may be marked by a comma serves to thwart the syntactical (or even rhetorical) basis for a reader's comprehension until the convention is recognized in a text and accepted for what it is. 7 Yet such conventions of punctuation—especially if their occasion is exacerbated by inconsistency of usage—can so distort the meaning as to require emendation even in an unmodernized text. For example, in the Folio Henry VIII when Lord Sands is revving up his wit at Wolsey's banquet, he answers Anne Bullen's light-hearted query whether his father was mad by replying: O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too; But he would bite none, just as I doe now, He would Kisse you Twenty with a breath. I.iv.28-30 (701-703) Here the end-of-the-line comma after 'now' does have an effect on the transfer of meaning. Does Sands mean that like his father he is biting no one now, or that his father would give twenty kisses (or, possibly, kiss twenty women) in an instant, just as Sands is now doing—presumably accompanying his words by kissing Anne Bullen, something an actor would need to know. Modern editors like the Globe choose the latter intention (which I think is correct) and distinguish by starting a dependent clause with 'just as I doe now,' prefixing 'just' with a semicolon or some other heavy mark and so retaining the comma after 'now'. This is unexceptionable, but an old-spelling editor is bound to emend as much as possible in terms of the original, not in terms of modernization. For such an editor the simpler way of straightening out this Folio ambiguity in meaning and action is to retain the characteristic light comma after 'none' but to remove the conventional line-ending comma, thus creating a run-on line: 'just as I doe now | He would Kisse you'. An alternative but perhaps less desirable emendation would be to exchange the Folio semicolon and comma, thus reading, 'in love too, | But he would bite none; just as I doe now, | He would Kisse you'. An exchange like this is often necessary, but the simple removal of the line-ending comma may be more appropriate here for an unmodernized text. A reverse case comes when the Duke of Norfolk is describing the Field of the Cloth of Gold: Each following day Became the next dayes master, till the last Made former Wonders, it's. To day the French, All Clinquant all in Gold, like Heathen Gods Shone downe the English; . . . I.i.16-20 (60-64) Literally interpreted according to the punctuation, the parenthetical description of the French is confined to 'All Clinquant all in Gold'. But if so, the relation of the heathen gods shining down the English is obscure. 'Clinquant' means glittering and can signify a thin plate-lace of gold or silver. Thus 'Clinquant' and 'Gold' may seem closely associated, but in fact the closest association of 'Gold' is with the heathen gods, by way of Psalms cxv.4, "Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands." 8 The full parenthesis, then, comprises 'All Clinquant all in Gold like Heathen Gods', with a sub-parenthesis in apposition to 'Clinquant' that defines 'Clinquant' by a comparison with gold heathen idols. The syntactical sense is The French (who glittered like gold heathen gods) outshone the English . The Globe adopts this reading but with typically heavy nineteenth-century punctuation, 'All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,' in which the comma after 'gold' partially obscures the close connection between the gods and gold. On the principle of using when possible the forms of the original punctuation, an unmodernized text should transfer the caesural comma after 'Gold' to the end of the line after 'Gods'. An ultra-conservative old-spelling editor might follow the lack of punctuation after 'Clinquant' on the rhetorical argument that no pause should be present, but this is valid only if 'all in Gold like Heathen Gods' is not a parenthesis after 'Clinquant'; thus the insertion of an editorial comma is not only useful as providing a slight pause but also syntactically pertinent as a mild guide to the reader. 9 A relatively common misreading of the syntax caused by the confusion of caesural and line-ending comma comes in King Henry's expostulation that Wolsey's special tax will destroy the fabric of the country, creating a true semi-substantive error: We must not rend our Subjects from our Lawes, And sticke them in our Will. Sixt part of each? A trembling Contribution; why we take From every Tree, lop, barke, and part o'th' Timber: And though we leave it with a roote thus hackt, The Ayre will drinke the Sap. I.ii.93-98 (429-433) The key phrase is 'with a roote thus hackt', which in turn depends upon preceding 'though'. If this 'though' had been 'since', the sense would have seemed perfectly clear; but 'though' quite changes the situation. It is no longer that the air will drink the sap because the root has been left in a hacked condition. No mention is made of the root in the description of the stripping of the tree, but only of the small branches (lop), bark, and part of the main wood. It is evident, therefore, that what is meant is this: although we leave the root intact for future growth, the rest has been so mutilated that the air will enter the sap and destroy the tree . This being so, the punctuation is clearly wrong by associating the hacking with the root. Instead, the line-ending comma must be moved back to the caesura so that we may read correctly: 'And though we leave it with a roote, thus hackt | The Ayre will drinke the Sap', which connects the hacking not with the root but with the rest of the tree. Most editors do insert a comma after 'roote', but by retaining the comma after 'hackt' they muddy the sense by failing to make it clear immediately that the hacking is not a parenthetical phrase to 'roote'. Instead, an old-spelling editor recognizes that he should try to repair errors in the same terms, in this case not by adding a missing comma only, but instead by transposing the punctuation signs in order to correct a misplacement. A more delicate example of such an exchange comes a little earlier in Wolsey's defense of his actions: What we oft doe best, By sicke Interpreters (once weake ones) is Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft Hitting a grosser quality, is cride up For our best Act: . . . I.ii.81-85 (416-420) Although the New Arden editor leaves the Folio punctuation intact, remarking only that editors who insert a comma after 'oft' have no authority for their action, the actual sense is contrary to the Folio. The Folio punctuation associates 'as oft' with 'Hitting a grosser quality'; but surely the 'worst' is grosser than the 'best' in any case, and the 'oft' should be linked in the first quoted line with 'best'. The sense is, thus, that as human beings we do worst as often as we do best, yet the worst although it hits 'a grosser quality' is praised by the world as our best action. When Capell recognized this meaning, he added a comma after 'as oft', but as so often with heavy parenthetical markings some ambiguity is left whether the parenthesis is to be associated with the preceding or the succeeding matter. Altering the text in its own terms by moving the comma after 'worst' to follow 'oft' is the best answer. 10 These simple illustrations of compositorial misunderstanding of whatever was the manuscript pointing, if any, definitely affect the sense by the misrepresentation of the syntactical signs that even in Elizabethan days would properly have been used to indicate the verbal meaning that would follow the correct structural relationship of words, phrases, clauses; that is, specifically, the grammatical modification of elements essential to the transfer of the intended sense. To the extent that they do corrupt meaning by producing false modification, they go at least a step beyond the ordinary run-of-the-mine faulty or inept punctuation that presents difficulties in the accidentals of seventeenth-century dramatic texts. It is customary to distinguish these accidentals of texture from essential meaning conveyed by the words themselves, that is, the substantives. But any editor will recognize that words derive meaning not only from their roots but also from their relationship to other words. When this relationship is obscured or even positively distorted, the essential meaning of the words, either in themselves or joined in phrases and clauses, may be as effectively altered as though different words had been used that an editor must emend. 11 In short, faulty punctuation can affect meaning in a substantive manner on the same level as the verbal signs. With some hesitation I use the term 'semi-substantives' to apply to these important punctuational signs 12 which merit as much editorial consideration as warranted by the selection from among faulty or variant textual verbals. Editors (and readers) familiar with erratic early punctuation may have no particular difficulty in deciding whether Lord Sands was biting or kissing like his father, or whether it was the heathen gods or else the French who outshone the English, although the ambiguity is sufficient to warrant straightening out by emendation. In a literal sense an argument can be pressed that such passages are semi-substantive in their effect on meaning. This effect is not unimportant, but insofar as there may usually be general agreement among editors as to the way to solve the problems such passages offer, they do not ordinarily qualify as cruxes, which I take roughly to identify significant editorial disagreement as to the readings that should be adopted to repair substantive damage. For purely practical purposes, in this paper, then, I should like to emphasize the sense in which the term semi-substantives can be narrowly applied to accidentals (chiefly but not exclusively punctuation) that create cruxes whereby editors of the original documents are led to disagree about the sense produced by the copy-text, and so whether emendation of the accidentals is necessary (or whether re-interpretation of the original is possible), and if emendation is necessary what is the best procedure to straighten out the difficulty and resolve the crux. 13 I offer as samples of significant semi-substance cruxes several weightier problems from Henry VIII in addition to the hacked root. The first is one of my favorites since among modern editors only Alexander and the New Cambridge follow Rowe in emending what I take to be an obvious error in the sense that is caused by the Folio's faulty punctuation. Queen Katherine is upbraiding Wolsey and Campeius who have been trying to secure her consent to the divorce by putting her cause into the hands of the King himself: Would you have me (If you have any Justice, any Pitty, If ye be any thing but Churchmens habits) Put my sicke cause into his hands, that hates me? Alas, ha's banish'd me his Bed already, His Love, too long ago. I am old my lords, . . . III.i.115-120 (1746-51) Here we have what in Rowe's (and my) opinion is a misplaced comma after 'Love' caused by compositorial misunderstanding, a comma that should be transposed to follow 'too'. 'Bed' and 'Love' are not properly balanced without their contrasting adverbs 'already' and 'long ago'. More important, 'Love' is not properly added to 'Bed' as the climactic item unless emphasized by 'too' in the sense of also , an adverb modifying the verb 'banish'd'. Katherine is not regretting merely the length of time she has lived without Henry's love, as would be the sense of 'too long ago', in which 'too' modifies 'long'. Instead, 'too' applies to the preceding words, so that 'Bed' and 'Love' are the compound objects of 'banish'd' ( OED banish 2b). The meaning Katherine intends is that she lost Henry's love long before she was banished his bed by the proceedings for divorce, a correct estimate of the order of events after Henry fell in love with Anne Bullen. Read 'His Love too, long ago.' A slenderer example of semi-substantive pointing may be mentioned. A recently raised crux comes early in Henry VIII when Abergavenny is expostulating that Wolsey's own letter laid a heavy charge on a number of individuals to contribute to the expenses of the Field of the Cloth of Gold: He makes up the File Of all the Gentry; for the most part such To whom as great a Charge, as little Honor He meant to lay upon: and his owne Letter The honourable Boord of Councell, out [130] Must fetch him in, [whom] he Papers. I.i.75-80 (126-131) Since Dr. Johnson, the standard emendation of the punctuation as it affects the sense has been to place a comma after 'Letter' (129) and to move the Folio comma (or emending parenthesis) after 'Councell' (130) so that it follows 'out', thus reading, 'his owne Letter, | The Honourable Boord of Councell out, | Must fetch him in, he Papers.' But Rossiter and Foakes (see New Arden, p. 13 note) while accepting a comma after 'Letter' retain the Folio comma after 'Councell', and argue (if I follow them correctly) that 'The Honourable Boord of Councell' is in apposition to the 'Letter' and thus is to be equated sarcastically with it (including a pun on 'Boord' as mockery). Foakes's paraphrase is, "his own letter, usurping the office of the honourable board of council (and mocking it), once sent out, compels the recipient to enter (or, brings in the person whose name he puts on paper)." As I see it, the question revolves on whether 'out' is an adverb, the sense being his letter being sent out, fetches in the recipient , or whether it is a preposition, the letter being Wolsey's own, without the knowledge or consent of the council, required the recipient to agree . This latter has been the common reading, which necessitates the transposition of the Folio comma from 'Councell' to 'out'. In either case it is acknowledged that the general sense requires Wolsey's letter to have substituted for the authority of the council, but the clarity of the usual emendation is superior since it baldly states that the letter was without the approval of the council, whereas only an inference is present, if the Folio punctuation is retained, that the letter and the council were one—that Wolsey usurped the authority of the council. Such a delicacy would be difficult to put across on the stage 14 and seems to represent an over-ingenious way of defending the faulty Folio punctuation. In another case, however, the Folio punctuation and syntax can be defended against emending editors. Describing Wolsey's death to Katherine, her man Griffith begins: This Cardinall, Though from an humble Stocke, undoubtedly Was fashion'd to much Honor. From his Cradle He was a Scholler, and a ripe, and good one: IV.ii.48-51 (2606-9) Led by the Globe (after Theobald) various modern editors have revised the Folio sentence structure to read that Wolsey 'was fashion'd to much Honor from his Cradle', which can mean only that Wolsey was brought up, or reared, with the goal that he would receive a high place in the kingdom. This emendation stems presumably from the belief that the manifestations of Wolsey's scholarship would have been difficult to discern at so early a stage as his cradle. However, Holinshed provides what would be a different gloss on 'fashion'd': "The Cardinall . . . was a man undoubtedly borne to honor," the mention of Wolsey's scholarship coming later in a separate list of his accomplishments. In the New Shakespeare, Maxwell believes that the Folio is wrong, but he remarks that a later passage in Holinshed—"being but a child, verie apt to be learned"—might offer some support for the original. Transposed punctuation is not unusual in the Folio (or elsewhere in Elizabethan dramatic prints). Compositor B, who set this page, could take a high hand with the details of the text, and on the evidence he was perfectly capable of altering the beginning of the sentence to an earlier point according as he interpreted the meaning. 15 Nevertheless, Fletcher's typical hyperbole is here not so gross that it may not stand as in the Folio, and an editor should need evidence more relevant than is present to justify a change to 'much Honor from his Cradle'. The repetition of 'undoubtedly' in Fletcher's 'undoubtedly fashion'd' from Holinshed's 'undoubtedly borne' indicates that 'fashion'd' should have the same meaning as 'borne', an association encouraged by Job xxxi.15, "Did not one fashion us in the wombe?" ( OED , vb. 1). It is true that OED vb. 3 to give a specified shape to; to model according to, . . . to shape into something would permit the sense of training, being brought up to, required by the emendation. But the 'undoubtedly borne' is heavy evidence and in Holinshed there is no suggestion that Wolsey was other than self-trained, as in "being but a child, verie apt to be learned". It follows that the source discourages emendation. The adverbial phrase 'From his Cradle' does not necessarily modify such a verb as 'fashion'd' ( bred ) but instead points, as in the Folio, to the next clause, 'He was a Scholler', which represents a more appropriate semantic and syntactical relationship ( created ). As printed in the Folio the text repeats Holinshed with quite sufficient sense. A more important example involves the establishment and application of an Elizabethan idiom. Suffolk and Norfolk, having just been dismissed the royal presence on the entrance of Wolsey with Campeius, exchange bitter words at Wolsey's influence over the King: Norff. This Priest has no pride in him? 16 Suff. Not to speake of: I would not be so sicke though for his place: But this cannot continue. Norff. If it doe, Ile venture one; have at him. Suff. I another. II.ii.81-84 (1126-31) The question is the phrase 'have at him', and especially its relation to 'I another'. No problem exists that 'Ile venture one' could mean I am ready to risk myself , and that that is the sense in which Compositor I took it, as evidenced by his semicolon. 17 'Have at him' is also a common ejaculation, as repeated in Henry VIII in 'Have at you' (III.ii.309[2205]) as well as 'have at ye' (V.iii.148[3180]). The more recent editors have conservatively followed the Folio pointing in this line with its semicolon after 'one'. But a difficulty arises in Suffolk's answer, 'I another', an agreement that in the Folio seems to refer 'another' directly back to preceding 'one'; if correct it would need to mean I shall be another to venture , but this is to strain the syntax. The difficulty can be surmounted if, more naturally, 'another' refers back to a preceding noun, an interpretation first broached in the 1821 Variorum and adopted later by Dyce. This would require Shakespeare to have invented, or utilized, a compound noun 'have-at-him'. Norfolk would then be saying, roughly, I'll venture one go at him (some overt action in opposition to Wolsey), to which Suffolk would then respond, If you do, I'll venture another such go . This interpretation may be strengthened by the relation of such a noun 'have-at-him' to the gambler's phrase for a desperate risk, 'have-at-all', the more especially since OED illustrates this gaming phrase as a noun, and provides a quotation from Thomas Randolph's Muses Looking Glass (1634), 'But you will starve yourself, that when y'are rotten, | One have at all of mine may set it flying.' In Henry VIII if, as I suggest, 'another' does indeed refer back to a noun 'have-at-him' instead of to 'one', then we have a very different sense dependent upon the presence or absence of the Folio semicolon after 'one', this constituting a true semi-substantive crux. 18 I draw certain conclusions from this study. Editors of modernized texts—influenced to follow tradition by the custom of marking up some previous text with their own alterations—have paid too little attention to the necessity to paraphrase every line of an Elizabethan dramatist (and particularly, Shakespeare). Paraphrasing requires scrupulous analysis of the sense as a means of observing its logic and true meaning. The servant of paraphrase and of meaning is accurate syntactical analysis, with especial reference to what elements in a sentence are the modifiers and what the modified. For example, paraphrase based on analysis of modification would reveal whether 'all in Gold' modifies 'Clinquant' or 'like Heathen Gods'; whether it was the hacking of the root or the mutilation of the rest of the tree, the root being left untouched, that allowed the air to dry up the sap; whether men do worst as often as best or whether their worst often hits a grosser quality than their best; whether Wolsey was fashioned to much honor, or fashioned to much honor from his cradle; whether Suffolk's 'I another' refers somehow to 'one' in the sense of for one , or whether 'I another' refers back to a compound noun 'have-at-him' preceded by the adjective 'one'. Some of the semi-substantives I have mentioned involved absolute meaning; others created delicate but nevertheless significant shades of meaning. Editors truly need to raise the level of their consciousness when dealing with Elizabethan dramatic punctuation whether they are producing unmodernized or modernized texts. There has been too much neglect of semi-substantive meaning in comparison to the care devoted to emending the words of a text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The problem of emending semi-substantive readings is essentially the same whether in old-spelling or in modernized texts. The means of emendation may differ according to the editorial punctuation system adopted, but the transmission of meaning by emendation of the accidentals will produce the same result. However, the tendency in modernized editions not to record semi-substantive emendations (except as in Foakes's New Arden), despite their importance, stifles the reader's awareness of their presence. And this relaxation in modernized editions of the old-spelling rule that all variants should be recorded sometimes hides from the modernizing editor himself the fact that a very real problem exists, the more especially since most modernizing editors (as of Shakespeare) mark up a copy of some preceding edition for their printer's copy and hence are considerably influenced by traditional editorial accidentals, particularly of punctuation concealing problems in the original. 2 Sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century dramatic texts are often printed from type-cases that did not contain exclamation marks, or with so few such sorts that they could not be employed with any frequency. Hence it was customary for the obvious emphatic to be accompanied by perfectly ordinary punctuation. (For example, the common exclamation 'Ha' could be followed by a comma, a semicolon, colon, period, or a question mark.) Compositors intent on indicating an exclamation often used a question mark, thus posing a special problem for modernizing (and to a lesser degree old-spelling) editors in cases when the context was about as suitable for a partial query as for an exclamation. For a brief consideration of some of the problems, see Bowers, "Readability and Regularization in Old- Spelling Texts of Shakespeare," Huntington Library Quarterly , 50 (1987), 213-215. Indeed, in some manuscripts, as in Ralph Crane's Barnavelt , the exact inscription whether a question or exclamation mark may be in legitimate doubt. 3 In modernized texts the neglected distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses may usually be worth imposing. The habit of early writers and their printers of forming long speeches by piling up a number of independent clauses, one after another, separated either by semicolons or colons—sometimes confusingly intermixed with stray commas—may often be worth preserving, as exemplified in R. A. Foakes's New Arden edition of Henry VIII . Forming new sentences by capitalization from such a series of clauses can produce a rather choppy effect, even when in the original a colon, say, is followed by a capitol. What is and what is not a run-on line is often in question, given the convention of line-ending commas; not all unpunctuated line-endings need be run-on, but a lack of punctuation in the original may often be given the benefit of the doubt without contrary evidence. For an old-spelling editor the conservative alteration of the dramatic punctuation should be attempted always in terms of the original system of the print with due regard for the compositor setting the lines in question. The urge to insure maximum readability in old-spelling texts by what is actually a form of modernization is one to be resisted: many old-spelling editors tinker too freely with early punctuation that is admittedly irregular but nevertheless characteristic and not necessarily in danger of being misunderstood by a reader accustomed to the system. 4 All quotations transcribe the Folio except for indented part-lines, the correction of mislining, and the modernization of i-j and v-u as well as of the old long ſ. Emended passages will be found in my edition of the play in vol. 7 (1989) of the Cambridge University Press Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon . 5 Such a good modernized edition as that of Foakes's New Arden achieves an acceptable compromise between the Folio punctuation and the requirements of a modernized-text reader. In this passage the New Arden alters the colon after 'little' to a semicolon; drops the comma after 'present'; reduces the capital of 'But' to lower case; substitutes a semicolon for a comma after 'flesh'; removes the comma after 'opinions'; and substitutes a comma for the semicolon after 'Heresies'. 6 A typical example from Henry VIII comes in I.iv.43-45 (722-724), which reads in the Folio: The red wine first must rise In their faire cheekes my Lord, then wee shall have 'em, Talke us to silence. Here it is clear that the meaning is obstructed by the formality of an end-of-the-line comma after "em' in what is obviously a run-on line. In reverse, at I.ii.203-206 (556-559) when the Surveyor is quoting Buckingham's threats against the King, the compositor seems to have switched the proper line-ending comma to the caesura, After the Duke his Father, with the knife He stretch'd him, and with one hand on his dagger, Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes, He did discharge a horrible Oath, thus distorting the sense, which is clarified in the New Arden's use of quotation marks when the Surveyor is repeating the Duke's words: 'After "the duke his father", with the "knife", | He stretch'd him'. Since this indication of quoting is a modernization, though useful, all an old-spelling editor need do is to move the comma after 'Father' to follow 'knife'. Such exchanges of position within a line or sometimes even between the ending of one line and the caesura or ending of the next are a commonplace that leads one to speculate that the compositor had settled on the punctuation but inadvertently switched positions when he was carrying too much text in his head. A more delicate transposition between line-endings probably comes in III.i.175-178 (1812-16): Qu. Do what ye will my Lords: and pray forgive me; If I have us'd my selfe unmannerly, You know I am a Woman, lacking wit To make a seemely answer to such persons. Most editors (the New Arden among the exceptions) emend to place a heavier mark, like a semicolon, after 'unmannerly' and a lighter mark after 'me'. Honest men may differ here, but by a hair it may seem very slightly better as in the Folio to associate the dependent clause 'If . . . unmannerly' as the stated reason for forgiveness. Nevertheless, the case is obscure and emendation of F is certainly not required. Earlier in this same scene Katherine furnishes another small but interesting possibility for a meaning different from F, one that also would affect the actress' delivery of her lines. A Gentleman has just announced the arrival of Wolsey and Campeius, to which Katherine responds, in the Folio: Pray their Graces To come neere: And then, in soliloquy: what can be their busines With me, a poore weake woman, falne from favour? [1640] I doe not like their comming; now I thinke on't, They should be good men, their affaires as righteous: But all Hoods, make not Monkes. III.i.18-23 (1638-43) In the F1-4 reading Katherine expresses first puzzlement, which turns to dislike; but then, after reflection, she charitably alters her feeling since the Cardinals by their office ought to be good men, and their business with her (or their actions in their priestly capacity) as well-intended as their goodness. She thus ends by reconciling herself to the visitation, albeit in a spirit of caution that these priests may not be so pure in intention as would be expected from a devout and sheltered monastic. In a transposition (adopted recently by Oxford) Capell in TLN 1641 switched the semicolon and comma so that the line read 'I doe not like their comming, now I thinke on't;'. This changes the modification of 'now I thinke on't' to apply to her dislike of their arrival: Katherine is at first puzzled by the news of the Cardinals' visitation, but on thinking it over she decides she does not like it. The reason follows, that 'all Hoods, make not Monkes.' In her delivery it is obvious that an actress will differ according as she reads the Folio or the Capell emendation of the line. One may suggest that though the Capell version is the simpler and more straightforward, the motivation or line of reasoning is less revelatory of character and that the Folio is more consistent with Katherine's established character showing a combination of charity with 'burnt child'. Yet either syntactical modification created by the line's placement of the strong semicolon stop makes sense. Nonetheless, whatever one thinks of the virtues of Capell's sense, it is not so superior in its coherence as to lead to an overturning of whatever authority the Folio has in its pointing. The Folio line would seem to be the better acting one and it better fits Katherine's capitulation at the end of the scene. A conservative editor should think twice before being seduced by the surface plausibility of the Capell semi-substantive emendation. 7 Whether mistake, rhetorical pause, or convention is doubtful in the caesural comma in III.ii.407-409 (2319-22): There was the waight that pull'd me downe. O Cromwell , The King ha's gone beyond me: All my Glories In that one woman, I have lost for ever. An old-spelling reader might perhaps be ready, after a hesitation, to see that 'In that one woman' is not the object of 'Glories' but of 'lost for ever', but it would be well to emend. The caesural convention is more glaring in V.i.131-133 (2932-34): at what ease Might corrupt mindes procure, Knaves as corrupt To sweare against you: . . . Compositorial misunderstanding or too strong rhetorical punctuation interferes with intelligibility for a moment in V.iv.17-19 (3387-89): This Royall Infant, Heaven still move about her; Though in her Cradle; yet now promises Upon this Land a thousand thousand Blessings, . . . A modernizing editor must thoroughly repunctuate to make 'Heaven . . . her' parenthetical; but for an old-spelling editor it should be enough to substitute a comma for the caesural semicolon after 'Cradle'. Alternatively, a colon could take the place of the semicolon after 'her' with no other change in punctuation. As with Wolsey in his cradle (see below, IV.ii.50 [2608]; both passages by Fletcher), the ambiguous syntax needs straightening out. 8 This information I draw from the notes to the New Arden edition, but curiously this text is unusual in preserving the ambiguous punctuation of the Folio. 9 One final gnaw at this bone. Although the description of gold heathen gods as clinquant is well enough, the real association of clinquant is with the lace the French wore. Thus the intention of the passage as developed from its imagery is best realized by the emended punctuation 'All Clinquant, all in Gold like Heathen Gods,' which clarifies the parenthesis between subject ( the French ) and direct object ( the English ), and thus the French outshone the English . 10 Another example of a subtle but necessary exchange comes at I.iii.59-62 (647-651) adopted by editors from Theobald. Wolsey's bounty is being praised, to which Lord Sands responds: He may my Lord, ha's wherewithall in him; Sparing would shew a worse sinne, then ill Doctrine, Men of his way, should be most liberall, They are set heere for examples. Superficially this might stand, but Theobald saw truly that the sense requires sparing in him , and thus an editor must move the semicolon after 'him' to follow 'wherewithall', leaving 'him' without punctuation to show a run-on line. (Incidentally, one may notice the caesural comma after 'way', which here is innocuous.) The above was in a setting by Compositor I, but at I.i.68-72 (118-122) Compositor B makes an even grosser error of understanding and of mistaken punctuation: but I can see his Pride Peepe through each part of him: whence ha's he that, If not from Hell? The Divell is a Niggard, [120] Or he ha's given all before, and he begins A new Hell in himselfe. Once again it was Theobald who saw that the query after 'Hell' (120) and the start of a new sentence with 'The Divell' resulted from a misunderstanding and that the sense requires the exchange 'whence ha's he that? | If not from Hell, the Divell is a Niggard'. 11 For example, I.iv.103-108 (812-817) ends with the enamoured King and his party leaving for a private room to continue their revels: Lead in your Ladies ev'ry one: Sweet Partner, I must not yet forsake you: Let's be merry, Good my Lord Cardinall: I have a halfe a dozen healths, To drinke to these faire Ladies, and a measure To lead 'em once againe, and then let's dreame Who's best in favour. Let the Musicke knock it. The King first addresses his party, then Anne Bullen, then Wolsey; then comes the coy hint addressed to Anne or to the company—less likely to Wolsey—followed by a general command for the music. If the Folio punctuation is followed (as it is by the fourteen modern editions since the Globe that I have collated), the address to Wolsey begins with 'Let's be merry'. But Theobald, now ignored, perceived truly that what Henry has to say to the Cardinal starts, instead, with 'I have a halfe a dozen healths, | To drinke', prefixed as usual in such address by 'good', which singles out for attention the person spoken to. Henry's 'Let's be merry' should properly be spoken either to Anne Bullen after his promise not to forsake her in the revelry, or else, perhaps a shade more likely, as a cheering interjection to the company at large after his private speech to Anne. It is worth noting that even such a formula as 'My good Lord' is more likely than not to begin an address, or at least a new sentence, as in I.iv.56-57 (744-745), 'Good Lord Chamberlaine, | Go, give 'em welcome'; but when the inversion 'Good my Lord' or its equivalent appears, it almost invariably heads a new sentence or clause, as in 'O good my Lord, no Latin', III.i.42 (1664): 'good your Graces | Let me have time and Councell for my Cause', III.i.78-79 (1703-4); 'Good my Lord, | You are full of Heavenly stuffe', III.ii.136-137 (2004-5); 'Stay good my Lords, | I have a little yet to say', V.ii.131-132 (3160-61). The various syntactical parallels (broken only by V.iii.28 [3287], 'I shall be with you presently, good M. Puppy ') suggest strongly the manner in which the actor playing Henry must manage the different addresses in this closing speech. Modern editors have allowed a conservative respect for the Folio punctuation (which in this play is far from trustworthy) to dull their sense of theatrical requirements. Read, 'Let's be merry; | Good my Lord Cardinall, I have a halfe a dozen healths, | To drinke'. In an old-spelling edition no urgent need exists to remove the line-ending comma after 'healths'. 12 Semi-substantives are most commonly found among the punctuation, but spelling can be semi-substantive as witness the frequent confusion between travail and travel . 13 In the broad sense semi-substantives certainly should identify accidentals that alter authorial intention in a meaningful manner comparable to faulty substantives, regardless of any editorial consensus. However, the most interesting editorially are those accidentals which constitute cruxes in meaning in that editors are in general not united either in declaring the original faulty for sense or in the most suitable means for repairing assumed corruption. Editorial disagreement, thus, is not necessary to turn accidentals into semi-substantives; merely, the most eligible accidentals for semi-substantive status are those that constitute cruxes. I argue only on practical grounds and on a case-by-case basis for touchstones, although with certain important considerations. A crux may be incipient in that it is potentially present although not currently admitted, as was true for the King's exit speech at I.iv considered above in footnote 11. Historicity cannot be ignored, however. For many years there appeared to be no question that Hamlet's flesh was solid and not sullied , but the reading is now debated with sullied gaining ground. Of course, not every variant may conceal future dispute, the lunatic fringe aside: it is unlikely that in I.ii.77 (258) Hamlet should address Gertrude as cold mother (Q2) instead of good mother (F1). Moreover, earlier editorial differences about a crucial reading may become so resolved by unanimity that thereafter a crux can scarcely be said to exist—at least at the present time, for the example of the close of I.iv may give us pause. On practical grounds, therefore, I suggest we may identify the most important critical sense of semi-substantives narrowly—and for purposes of discussion here—as differences of current or at least recent editorial opinion about the actual variable sense produced by accidentals, in their significance for variant meaning paralleling substantive cruxes. 14 If one tests the crux by the commonsense question what the words would signify to an ordinary audience hearing them from the stage, the answer is certainly that 'out' would mean 'without'. The exact circumstances discussed in the New Arden note would not be ascertainable or at all important; that is, whether the council was or was not sitting at the time (Johnson), or whether all mention of the council had been omitted from the letter (Steevens). It is the phrase 'his owne Letter' that shapes the audience's response, it being clear that it was this letter (written without the authority of the council) that brought in the recipient. Holinshed writes that "the peers, receiving letters to prepare themselves to attend the king in their journie . . . seemed to grudge, that such a costlie journie should be taken in hand to their importunate charges and expenses, without consent of the whole boord of the councell." This source passage may be trusted to explicate 'out' as without . Read 'his owne Letter, | The Honourable Boord of Councell out, | Must fetch'. 15 See footnote 10 and the crux at I.i.69-70 (119-120) for Compositor B starting a new sentence in the wrong place. Some transpositions are so lacking in sense as to lead me to speculate that sometimes the transposition resulted from memorial failure by the compositor. That is, as in Moxon's advice, he would have read over several lines and decided on the punctuation, but when he turned to his cases and began setting from memory, he inadvertently transposed the selected punctuation. As a typical though minor example from Henry VIII we find in F That having heard by fame Of this so Noble and so faire assembly, This night to meet heere they could doe no lesse, I.iv.66-68 (759-761) where 'assembly | This' should be the run-on line and the end-of-the-line comma should come after 'heere' instead. A more important example closer to the cradle crux, although set by Compositor I, comes when Campeius is presenting his Papal commission to Henry, a document that appoints Wolsey as the second judge in the Queen's trial. The Folio mistakenly reads: To your Highnesse hand I tender my Commission; by whose vertue, The Court of Rome commanding. You my Lord Cardinall of Yorke , are joyn'd with me their Servant, In the unpartiall judging of this Businesse. II.ii.103-106 (1150-54) Here 'The Court of Rome commanding' is a parenthesis modifying 'vertue', part of an inverted phrase before the subject of the sentence 'You my Lord'. Read 'commanding, you my Lord | Cardinall of Yorke , are joyn'd', with retention of the caesural comma. More typical is Henry's aside in the Blackfriars court scene, also set by Compositor I: My learn'd and welbeloved Servant Cranmer , Prethee returne, with thy approch: I know, My comfort comes along: . . . II.iv.236-238 (1609-11) Transposition to read 'Prethee returne: with thy approch, I know' straightens out the compositorial error caused by memorial failure, although mistaken sense cannot be ruled out. 16 One may note the ambiguity of the question mark, which poses a problem for modernizing editors more than for old-spelling. Some take the question mark to be the Folio equivalent of an exclamation, as often, and like Alexander, Kittredge, and the New Penguin print 'him!' Others, like the New Arden, follow the Globe in retaining the query. Since in my opinion only in extreme cases of possible confusion of the sense should an old-spelling editor insert uncharacteristic exclamation points in texts normally wanting them, such an editor may well retain the question mark here. Although it is likely that Norfolk's is an exclamation, it is also possible that, with ellipsis, he is inquiring Has this priest no pride in him? which might be supported by Suffolk's response, although not necessarily so. Even if an old-spelling editor chooses to interpret the line as an exclamation, the conventional question mark conveys the sense well enough in an unmodernized text. Of course, a modernizing editor must make a choice. 17 To venture one may be closely associated but perhaps not idiomatically identical with to make one : see, for example, 'Ile make one in a dance', LLL , V.i.160 (1884) or 'I see a sword out, my finger itches to make one', MWW , II.iii.48 (1108-9), where 'make one' means to join a group. 18 It is true that the Folio is our sole authority and that its reading of Norfolk's line, alone, makes sense. It is also true that Compositor I, who set the line, often introduces strong stops like a semicolon or even a period in inappropriate places ( vide 'So if that quarrell. Fortune, do divorce', II.iii.14 [1217]) so that the Folio semicolon may be an error as required by a nominal have-at-him . But general suspicion of Compositor I's punctuation, no matter how well deserved, is no demonstration of error. Nor perhaps is the interesting fact that the F2 compositor failed to understand the idiom of 'Ile venture one' and by removing the semicolon and substituting 'heave' for 'have' he indicated that he thought 'one' was an adjective. In the end, the reading is likely subject only to opinion. I opt for 'have at him' as a noun and the emended deletion of the intrusive semicolon, in part moved by a question whether, in actuality, venture one is a true parallel here to make one . If it is not, except for the possible interpretation that 'Ile venture one' means I for one will venture (and I doubt it) the phrase is idiomatically suspect. It seems probable, therefore, that Randolph's nominal 'one have at all of mine' is the true parallel, in which case the possibility of 'have at him' as a noun, also, is the stronger and emendation in Henry VIII is advisable.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Font Analysis as a Bibliographical Method: The Elizabethan Play-Quarto Printers and Compositors by Adrian Weiss *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In "Edward Allde as a Typical Trade Printer", R. B. McKerrow distinguished two classes of early printers, the printer-publishers who published books on their own as well as printing for others, and trade printers who printed almost exclusively for publishers and produced "a very large proportion of the play-quartos, the smaller volumes of verse, the prose-pamphlets . . . many of whom, it may be said, give a great deal of trouble by their casualness in the matter of imprints and dates." Perhaps McKerrow inspired the few subsequent studies of printers by commenting that "a comparatively small amount of work devoted to such minor people as these would help us very greatly in identifying the house of origin of many books which bear no printer's name" 1 ; however, the inspiration was short lived as bibliographers turned increasingly to studies of specific texts based upon now-familiar methods of analysis. Nearly a half-century later, Peter Blayney reiterated the need for attention to the matter of printer identifications not only in books lacking an imprint, but also in books assigned to one printer and shared with one or more other printers, a practice sufficiently common so as to merit classification as "prevalent". 2 The categorical necessity of detecting and distinguishing two or more printers' work in a book hardly requires comment: it is a prerequisite to the analysis of compositors and presswork. Moreover, the identity of the printer(s) of a book link it to the personnel and production methods of a particular shop(s) and how they could corrupt a text. In general, printer identifications in both categories of books have relied upon the recognition of ornaments and decorated upper-case initials, a form of evidence with limited reliability and value because of the common practice of lending among printers and because of the large number of books in which neither appear. A practical limitation in shorter shared books, particularly play-quartos, arises from the fact that printer's devices usually are restricted to the preliminaries and first letter of a text; later shared sections simply continue setting the text without an opportunity to insert ornamental stock. 3 In contrast, evidence from a printer's type fonts exhibits no such limitations and, together with identifiable types, can be considered de facto proof of his identity. 4 Hence, such evidence can be used to identify a printer's work in assigned and shared books, and distinguish sections of shared books or books printed by a printer with two or more fonts. Furthermore, it can provide a more accurate focus for compositorial and presswork analysis since, if two fonts appear in a book, at least two sets of type-cases were used. In turn, this fact implies the possibility of two compositors setting simultaneously or alternately and the consequent need for casting-off copy, factors that are considered crucial in influencing accuracy in the textual transmission process. Unfortunately, the subject of font analysis and its uses have received very little attention, despite its potential importance in bibliographical research. 5 It seems that so fundamental a physical fact such as the type fonts used in a book could hardly be overlooked by scholars habituated to working with vast amounts of minute details. But that, in fact, has happened in many cases where the presence of two or more fonts in a book has been overlooked and bibliographical analysis has proceeded as if the book were printed by a single printer in one font. 6 It seems fair to say that the discipline as a whole has suffered from the lack of a practical method of analysing fonts for the purposes of distinguishing sections of shared books and of identifying printers. One hopes that this present introduction to a method of font analysis and its use in bibliographical study will enable textual scholars to assess more accurately the impact of various aspects of the printing process upon early texts. Font analysis, although simple in nature, requires attention to the enormous amount of detail that characterizes a particular font. My discussion of font differentiae perhaps draws attention to more detail than is necessary, but I think that too much is the best option in this case despite the potential tedium for readers and I apologize in advance. Likewise, I believe that this introduction would be incomplete without an explanation of the logic that underlies the use of font analysis as a bibliographical method and comments about the kinds of problems that can be resolved by font analysis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I On the simplest level, font analysis distinguishes between two fonts in dissimilar faces with no greater difficulty than obtains, by analogy, in recognizing that a modern face such as Courier is different from Prestige. In general, typefaces can be distinguished upon the basis of differences in size, either apparent or real, and stylistic differences in the design of the letters. The width and height of the body of the types respectively determine the horizontal spacing between letters and the vertical spacing between lines, although measurements of the latter using the standard method are sometimes less than precise because of paper shrinkage across four centuries. 7 Width is generally classified in relative terms such as "condensed" or "narrow", "medium", "wide", and "expanded". Most letters (or sorts) of the S-face are set on a wider body than in the Y-face, especially in regard to 'a r' and the thin letters 'i j l t'. The effect of this body-size on overall appearance can be seen by comparing the spacing in combinations such as "are", "and", and "illusion". The type seems spread out in the S-face leaving more "white space" within words in a line of set type. The use of wide and expanded 'k x z', and a bold left-stem on the 'v y' adds to this effect. 8 In contrast, the thin letters of the Y-face are set on a narrower body, and, along with the medium 'k v x y z', produce an appearance of more densely packed type, with quite prominent white spaces between words, but little within words. The general design of the S-face (see footnote 12 for the naming of these fonts as S and Y) further contributes to its squarish, open appearance. The vertical elements of the letters are thicker than the horizontal curved portions so that the former print more boldly than the latter. In technical terms, the "weight" or relative density of blackness of the parts of a letter establishes the "contrast" between thick and thin strokes, and the orientation of thick to thin defines the "stress": thus the S-face exhibits "vertical stress" or vertical "shading". The stress is not necessarily uniform in all letters, but dictated by shape. The diagonal letters (A M N S V W X Y Z v w x y z) exhibit oblique stress with thin vertical or right-leaning and bold left-leaning (relative to the baseline) strokes. In the lower-case letters, the bold inking of shoulders (a h m n) and bowls (b d p q) at the x-line makes the typeface appear higher and wider than it actually is. On the other hand, the Y-face is relatively unstressed so that all portions of a letter print with nearly equal boldness, except for the light shading that characterizes the shoulders of the tall letters, ligatures and the curved portions of several lower-case letters. The Y-face's lighter weight and contrast is obvious to the naked eye even when heavily inked. Viewed at high magnification (30X) in original books, the metal elements that form Y-face letters (i.e., the surface of the type which makes contact with the paper) seem rounded on the edges, whereas S-face letters exhibit elements with usually sharp squared edges. An analysis of the specific differences in the structure of the letters in the two faces can clarify the relation between the stylistic design of specific letters and the overall appearance of a typeface. Font analysis is facilitated by the fact that letters can be classified in groups on the basis of shape. A major difference in design can be seen in the group consisting of the 'f' and the long-(or tall-) 'ſ' and their associated ligatures. In the S-face, the uniformly thin shoulder stroke is a rather flat arc which abruptly curves just below the h-line into the bold vertical stem. It terminates at the right with a quite small "pear". The shoulder frequently appears shaded because of the accumulation of ink along its bottom edge and around the pear; lightly inked letters and the shoulders of some ligatures reveal the actual weight of the shoulder. In many of these letters, damage has nudged the right half of the shoulder upward so that it terminates horizontally. The shoulders of the 'ſſ ff ffi' ligatures are similarly formed. Both shoulders are of equal height and the left joins the right slightly below the h-line, rather than being vertically staggered as in the Y-face. The 'ſh ſl ſt' ligatures clarify this design characteristic. A bit of the ascender of the 'h' and the 'l' in the former extend above the shoulder junction, while the 't' of the 'ſt' ligature reaches almost to the h-line before joining the shoulder. Damage frequently flattens the shoulders into a single continuous arc and nudges the right termination upward. In contrast, the tall letters of the Y-face are shaded. The shoulder of the 'f' and tall-'ſ' commences with a graceful curve just above the cross at the x-line and thins as the stroke moves through a diagonal to the horizontal, then broadens in the downward stroke that completes the shoulder. It terminates noticeably below the h-line with a large pear. The letters in the ligatures are vertically staggered: the left 'ſ' or 'f' is a bit shorter than the right letter. The shading of the downward stroke that completes the shoulder is obvious in the ſh, ſl and ſt ligatures, where the 'h l t' are shortened to accommodate the low junction with the shoulder. The junction commonly gathers ink and accentuates the shaded structure of the shoulder. The difference between the two faces in regard to shoulder structure is quite obvious at high magnification where the actual impression of the face elements can be detected without the obfuscation caused by the inking-in of the curves and joints. The overall effect of the shoulder structure in the ligatures and tall 'ſ f' is that the horizontal space between lines in the S-face is uncluttered by the bold inking produced by the shaded, staggered shoulders that characterise the Y-face. Finally, the 'ct' ligature provides an easily detected discriminant. The "open" 'ct' ligature is typical of the S-face: the body of the 'c' is slanted left and seems improperly formed since neither end of the 'c' "closes up" with the 't' and a considerable amount of white space obtains between the two letters. In contrast, the Y-face uses an elegantly formed 'ct' ligature in which the body of the 'c' is fully formed and closes up with the cross and base of the 't'; the letters are joined by a graceful link whose orientation and size balances the 'c'. The two faces are further differentiated in the lower-case by the formation of the shoulders, bowls and top-serifs. In the S-face, the counter, or enclosed white space, in the round (or "oval" to be precise) letters (o d q) appears to lean left as if the axis were rotated counterclockwise. In the 'o', for example, the thin portion of the letter occurs at 11 and 5 o'clock, rather than at 12 and 6 o'clock. The ascender of the 'b' and descender of the 'p' replace the part of the oval to the left of the thin part; the converse is true of the 'd q'. Thus the junction of ascender and bowl forms an oblique angle just below the x-line, a proportioning (less than half) that accentuates the apparent height of the ascender and makes the bowl seem smaller. The stylistic theme seen in the oval letters appears uniformly in other lower-case letters. If attention is limited to the portions of the 'b p a m n h' abutting the x-line (by covering the lower portion of the letters with a card, for example), it can be noted that the letters are nearly identical. The shoulder of the 'm n h' is formed by a thin straight line at an oblique angle that rises to the x-line, then curves abruptly downward with an angular rather than a smoothly curving stroke. The right shoulder frequently prints as an angle rather than a curve because of heavy inking. This characteristic is accentuated in two letters. The shoulder of a common variant 'n' is wider (+0.1mm) than the right shoulder of the 'm'. In undamaged samples of the 'a', the low junction of the stem (or back) and the nearly horizontal top-stroke of the bowl is considerably below the x-line and leaves the "squarish" shoulder "hanging" over a prominent amount of white space. The formation of top-serifs is identical in the 'p q m n': by analogy with hand-writing, the downward stroke that forms the stem begins on the x-line with the broad tip of the pen set at the characteristic oblique angle and bends to the vertical almost immediately. The top of these letters frequently prints as a horizontal zig-zag because of the agreement of the coincident oblique angle of the top-serif and shoulder (or bowl-top of the 'p q'). However, the 'u' violates this stylistic uniformity with its horizontal, bold, left top-serifs, although it agrees with the base-serifs of the 'a d' which are inversions of the top-serif stroke of the 'm n p'. The top-serif on the tall letters (b d h l k) is a left-pointing triangle, while the bottom serif extends on both sides of the descender of the 'p q'. The overall effect of the oblique "fineline" at the x-line in S-face lower-case letters is to "square up" the face at the x-line, with the left counter of round letters complimenting the angular shoulders of the 'm n h'. Lower-case letters are unstressed in the Y-face. The 'o' is formed by a round stroke of uniform thickness. The bowls of the 'b d p q' exhibit barely noticeable vertical stress because the portions of the bowl which join the vertical stroke are thinned slightly at 12 and 6 o'clock. In contrast to the distinct oblique junction angle of the S-face, Y-face bowl and shoulder junctions are nearly right angles at the x-line. In the 'b', for example, the round line to the left of the axis is bent upward toward the horizontal to join the ascender almost on the x-line at half the height of the ascender. At the bottom of the letter, the round line of the bowl touches the baseline and curves upward slightly to join with the ascender, which is thus displaced above the baseline. Evenly proportioned round letters result from this design concept, which is inverted in the 'p q': the baseline junction is nearly horizontal, while the top junction forms a slight oblique angle. The shoulder stroke of the 'm n h' begins nearly horizontal and immediately broadens from a thin tip at the junction with the vertical stems into a symmetrical, round curve. The width of the shoulders of the 'h n' are identical to the right shoulder of the 'm'. The graceful rounding of the Y-face is most obvious in variants of the 'a', which is well-proportioned compared to the awkward 'a' of the S-face. Its shoulder, back and base-serif are formed by a single gracefully flowing stroke, and the letter is "closed up" by the higher junction of bowl and back. Serifs of Y-face letters are frequently worn away or indistinct. The two faces can be further differentiated by lower-case diagonal letters (k v w x y z) and the 'g'. The S-face diagonal letters are commonly of expanded width which is accentuated by pronounced serifs, the right-angle crossing of the diagonals in the 'x', and the long arms of the 'z'. Pronounced serifs and heavy oblique stress of the left stem creates an impression of extra width in the 'y v', although they are of medium width. The "squat" appearance of the 'k' results from the low junction of the link of the arm-leg at ¼-height on the ascender, the right angle enclosed by the arm-leg in the common variants, and the pronounced arm and leg serifs. In contrast, medium-width diagonal letters are found in the Y-face in the 'v w x y' sorts, although a condensed 'y' variant is common. The left stem of the 'y v' exhibit minimal stress and a smaller enclosed angle than in the S-face. Several 'k' variants occur, but the junction of the arm-leg link at about ⅓-height on the ascender is always higher than in the S-face 'k' and produces a more balanced proportioning. Finally, the loop of the 'g' is noticeably larger than the bowl in the S-face; the loop-stroke begins at the base line, while the link pushes the bowl to the x-line. In Eld's version of the S-face, the left edge of both bowl and loop are vertically aligned, creating a left-slant; in another common variant, the bowl and loop are centered for an erect appearance. The bowl of the 'g' in the Y-face, in contrast, is approximately the same width as the loop, and the letter is vertically aligned. Stylistic differences are generally more obvious in the capitals, particularly with respect to several awkward, poorly proportioned letters in the S-face which contrast with the more balanced symmetry of the Y-face capitals. The gross, excessively wide and awkward 'M' of the S-face is characterised by a single left top-serif and slanted legs. The Y-face uses a symmetrical 'M' with double shoulder serifs that are integral to the 'V' stroke that connects the erect legs. The bowl stroke of round S-face capitals such as 'P B D R' begins considerably to the left of the ascender on the characteristic oblique angle and complements the accentuated shoulder- and base-serifs of other capitals, while in the Y-face, the bowl stroke is horizontal and barely overextends the ascender. The S-face uses an obtrusively large 'P' whose bowl stroke terminates far below the x-line and does not close up with the ascender; the letter clashes aesthetically with the 'B' and especially the 'R', with its aenemic bowl that terminates at the x-line and its stressed tail that extends awkwardly beyond the bowl. In the Y-face, the 'B P R' are of similar proportions. The tall rectangular 'E F' are noticeably narrow for the S-face, particularly in regard to the 'E', where the foot barely extends beyond the medial cross and arm. The cross of the 'E' appears to be high on the ascender. The two letters are square in the Y-face, with longer horizontal members and distinctive serifs. Overall, S-face capitals overwhelm the lower-case letters on the printed page; perhaps the capitals were cut by a different punchcutter who failed to integrate them stylistically with the lower-case. Conversely, S-face punctuation sorts appear small for the face. The ascender of the exclamation point and the back of the query are bisected by the x-line and do not rise to the h-line. The comma of the semi-colon rides above the baseline, with the dot at or above the x-line, and the dots of the colon are positioned between base- and x-line. The comma is positioned normally on the base-line. In contrast, Y-face punctuation marks conform to the proportions and design of the letters. The Y-face query is a gracefully formed, full-height mark, as is the exclamation point, and the other marks are positioned correctly for the height of the face. A few hours examination of the two faces in originals or high quality facsimiles of any of the books noted in later discussion will familiarize the reader with the essentials of typeface design and structure. The considerable differences between the S-face and the Y-face render them easily distinguishable even to the novice after such an exercise. It seems a fortunate coincidence that in many cases of shared printing, versions of the two faces alternate in sections of a book. In such cases, a comparative analysis need only progress through a few groups of letters before the "gross features" illustrated above distinguish the different fonts, providing sufficient cause to suggest that further bibliographical analysis proceed upon the assumption that two printers were involved. However, that is merely the beginning step in the application of font analysis. A book printed in more than two fonts almost inevitably requires distinguishing two same-face fonts, followed by an attempt at identifying the fonts in other books for the purpose of sorting out the printers. That process is facilitated by a comprehensive font composite that graphically records the distinguishing traits of a given font. 9 The identification process itself requires that the font in the target book be compared to extremely similar, same-face fonts in other books. Similarly, in many instances of sharing that involved more than two printers, two or more versions of the same typeface are encountered in different sections of a book. In both situations, the bibliographer then is faced with a more complex task of analysis, since distinguishing between fonts in the same face is a much more difficult proposition because the general stylistic traits are identical except for infrequent variants. Assuming that the two same-face fonts and their respective sections of the book have been successfully distinguished, an attempt to identify the printers is further complicated by the fact that, quite understandably, the preliminary candidates will be selected primarily because they used the typeface in their known work. Hence, the general kind of stylistic analysis described above must be supplemented by a more refined and detailed focus upon potential discriminants within the context of nearly identical fonts. As a general rule, discriminants can be detected in this situation because each font has a unique history of usage, abuse and transformation that in all probability will have produced both obvious and subtle variations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The refined evidence required for distinguishing same-face fonts can be divided into internal and external categories depending on whether a potential discriminant is imported from a dissimilar face, or whether it is a variation within the stylistic parameters of the face. In both categories, a discriminant is two-dimensional, and consists of the qualitative stylistic difference combined with the quantitative proportion of differing letters in a sort. External discriminants are easily detected because of the clash in the stylistic features noted in earlier discussion, and are imported into a font through processes of fouling, replenishment, and large-scale mixing of two fonts. The proportion of wrong-face letters in a sort usually indicates which process is involved: a high proportion of wrong-face letters in a given sort suggests a high probability of replenishment, and conversely, a small, or better yet, almost infinitesimal proportion suggests that fouling is responsible. Mixing introduces significant proportions of wrong-face or stylistically different letters into most sorts of a font. It is impossible to state fixed proportions or rules that apply to all fonts. The distinction between replenishment and fouling is based upon the assumption that replenishment is responsible for the presence of abnormal (wrong-face or miscast) letters in significant quantities in a population which retains a varying proportion of normal letters in the depleted sorts. The converse is taken to indicate fouling since the overwhelming majority of letters in a sort consists of normal letters. The distinction can have serious practical implications: the former come from outside the shop and merely provide an additional discriminant in a single font; however, the latter are from within the shop, and indicate that the font belongs to a printer with two or more fonts. In turn, this permits the narrowing of the field of candidates to such printers and provides an additional criteria to guide the search for the printer of a section of a shared book. The correct candidate will use two fonts that either could produce or actually do exhibit an appropriate degree of mutual cross-contamination. 10 The replenishment process produced four categories of external wrong-face or miscast capitals, ligatures and lower-case letters. Although many miscast letters are in the correct-face and hence internal discriminants in a technical sense, in most instances they present such a striking contrast to properly formed letters that they warrant classification as external discriminants. As a general rule, potential discriminants must be checked against the same letters in other printers' fonts to verify that they are abnormal for the typeface. The on-going process of piecemeal replenishment usually will have produced quantitative differences in the proportions of replenished abnormal and original letters in same-face fonts. Wrong-face capitals are the most easily detected external discriminants and typically are produced by replenishment of a Y-font with S-face capitals. The latter are of a slightly larger design scale but are cast on roughly the same pica body size as a Y-font and thus do not distort baseline evenness. 11 Capitals exhibiting radical stylistic differences, as noted above in regard to the symmetrical Y-face and the oversized awkward S-face 'M', are difficult to overlook even when separated by pages, and other wrong-face capitals with minor stylistic differences become obvious when juxtaposed with their normal counterparts. Juxtaposition with normal tall letters and ligatures likewise calls attention to differences in height. The difficulty of locating samples of original or replenished upper-case letters varies with the kind of text: prose texts often require a cover-to-cover search to produce a few samples while verse texts usually produce a plethora of samples of a replenished upper-case letter plus remnants of the original. Thomas Purfoot's Y-font in The Fawne Q1-Q2 (STC17483-4, A-D) provides a clear example of extensive replenishment with S-face capitals and the proportions which emerge. In this alternating verse/prose text, capitals tend to be concentrated in verse pages. The awkward S-face 'M' appears in Q2 seven times before and three times immediately after the original Y-face 'M' which is first seen at B2:33 and then at C4:38 for two appearances in contrast to 26 appearances of the replenished 'M'. In higher frequency sorts, a page or two may provide an adequate number of samples. Seventeen replenished S-face 'A', for example, appear in D2v, with one conveniently juxtaposed at D3:11 to an original 'A' at D3:10. Or, the actual count may be low but revealing, as on B1v of Q1, where two replenished 'P' (B1v:1,21) appear amidst four originals (B1v:7,15,21,34), and on C1, where two replenished 'P' (C1:23) and three originals (C1:24,31) are juxtaposed; and the S-face 'S' at (Q1) B1:12,28 vs a normal 'S' at B1:20. A difficult situation occurs when the sample population is so small in one sort that replenishment must be inferred from the contextual replenishment that is obvious in other sorts. For example, an original 'R' appears at (Q1 and Q2) B1v:32, and replenished letters at (Q1) B2v:9, C2v:23, 27, and in Q2 at B2v: 8,22, C3v:22. When no sample of the original letter can be found to provide a basis for comparison, a close examination may reveal a basis for inferring replenishment from wrong-size criteria. For example, the 'N' sort in Purfoot-Y1 appears to have been totally replenished; it is taller than the Y-face 'G' (2.8mm vs 2.75mm) and equal in height to medium S-face letters such as the 'A B D F R' and it usually rides low on the baseline. 12 However, a survey of other fonts reveals that this capital 'N' is unique in that it occurs as the normal letter in both S- and Y-fonts. All other S- and Y-face capitals differ in design and size. In some instances, proportions such as those noted in the replenishment of Purfoot-Y1 with wrong-face capitals may be deceptive. As a general rule, once the possibility of replenishment because of wrong-face capitals is entertained, the lower-case letters and ligatures must be checked to verify the correct-face and then be confirmed in another book. Nicholas Okes's S-font (1607), for example, was purchased with Guyot capitals, but the lower-case letters and ligatures are S-face except for the medium 'ſſi' and 'ffi' ligatures that somehow slipped in. 13 Similarly, the different proportions caused by fouling as opposed to replenishment can create the impression that the latter is responsible; the cross-contamination of Eld-S and Eld-Y1 illustrates this problem. The odd method of setting the speech prefixes in Sejanus (STC14782, 1605) with a pica capital followed by small capitals (as on B3v:5,6,7,8,9,21) put a severe strain on the S-font 'S A T' sorts and occasioned relatively high-frequency appearances of Y-face letters in these sorts. Without checking the font in another book, the question of whether these wrong-face capitals intruded by replenishment or by fouling remains unresolved. The compositor(s) seems to have attempted to distribute correctly, since the proportion of Y1-capitals seems to decrease noticeably in later gatherings of Sejanus , but it must be borne in mind that the demands of the text on the affected sorts can vary significantly among gatherings. Hence, the decrease can be more apparent than real. The presence of the large proportion of a Y-face 'S' in Eld-S in Sejanus is an example. This 'S' is about 0.2mm shorter (2.65mm vs 2.85mm) than the correct-face letter with a diagonal stroke that is closer to the horizontal. The letter is found throughout the book, but primarily in speech prefixes. A check of later books reveals that, in fact, fouling was the source of the Y-face 'S'. A second potential discriminant in Eld-S is seen in the shorter asymmetrical Guyot 'S' in which the bottom counter is noticeably larger than the top and the diagonal bends tightly into the shoulder (see Low Countries , Fig. 203, p. 268). Its rate of appearance of about 3-4 per gathering in Sejanus (B1v:27, B3:24, B4:28, B4v:19) suggests fouling, and indeed, that is confirmed by its apparent failure to appear in later Eld-S books ( Fearful News STC21511, 1606; A Brand Taken From the Fire STC5704, new STC5693.5, 1606) although these prose texts required fewer capitals and provide a marginally adequate sample. The appearance of this Guyot 'S' in Eld-Y1 ( The Malcontent Q1 STC17479 [1604], B1v:24, C2:21, C2v:24) in mid-1604 and later in Sejanus suggests that Eld distributed a small batch of these letters into Eld-Y1 which fouled Eld-S along with the normal Y-face 'S' during the setting of Sejanus . The Guyot 'S' could have easily been purged from Eld-S because of its radically different style; however, it remained resident in Eld-Y1 where it is equally obvious. In contrast, there is clear evidence of replenishment in the 'A' sort. In addition to the foul-case Y-face 'A' ( Sej , B2v:2,3,26), the sort includes a relatively new batch of S-face 'A' that print boldly with a sharply defined offset-right peak at the apex ( Sej , B2v:2,11,21,27,30, B3:22,26,27); the older letters have a worn, rounded apex (B2v:7,8,13,26). In the absence of obvious stylistic differences, variations in size provide the primary clue to the presence of wrong-face capitals. The general rule about cross-checking potential wrong-face discriminants against other fonts is especially relevant here, since early pica typefaces exhibit a normal range of variation of height in the capitals and ligatures which could be mistaken as potentially significant. 14 For example, a survey at high magnification of the capitals in Eld-Y1 could lead to the false impression that large-scale replenishment in the capitals produced a varying range in height of about 0.3mm, which, if unique to Eld-Y1, would certainly be a powerful font discriminant ('K' = 2.4mm, 'G' = 2.75mm). A similar but smaller variation in height can be seen in the capitals and ligatures in S-fonts amounting to about 0.15mm. S-face capitals and ligatures are taller than their Y-face and Guyot counterparts. In all instances, these variations are integral to the sets of punches from which the typefaces derived. The precise measurements of height variations in originals are somewhat affected by printing effects and four centuries of paper deterioration, but can be confirmed as integral to a typeface in a unique specimen of the Claude Garamond pica seen in Stanley Morison's John Fell, the University Press and the 'Fell' Types (p. 133). The specimen is an actual impression (not a reproduction) produced by types newly cast in the Garamond pica matrices in the Fell collection and composed by hand (and so for the rest of the book). As such, it provides a most accurate record of an early typeface unaffected by damage or deterioration. 15 Variations in size were also introduced during the copying of an original letter by a particular punchcutter hired to replace damaged or worn punches. Given the striking similarity in size variations of capitals and ligatures among many pica fonts of the period, it seems likely that they all derived from just a few sets of punches. Nonetheless, height variations in capitals and ligatures can provide useful discriminants. For example, the S-face 'I' in Eld-Y1 exhibits greater height and exaggerated serifs, but it is often indistinguishable with the naked eye from heavily inked normal letters. Its presence in nearly equal proportion to the normal 'I' is probably attributable to replenishment, even though fouling is a possibility because of the heavy strain on the sort in the highly reflective Montaigne's Essayes (STC18041, 1603). However, it is also present in two other 1603 books ( Nero STC12551, and A Treatise . . . Antichrist STC7120) and may have been introduced into the font previously, since the printing sequence of the three books is unclear. The S-face 'I' remains resident in the Eld-Y1 throughout its lifetime. Similarly, Eld-S was replenished with Y-face 'I' early on. Later replenishment with S-face 'I' has the effect of diminishing the proportion of the Y-face 'I' in a growing population of correct-face letters. This combination in the 'I' sort provides a discriminant between Eld-S and other S-fonts such as John Windet's and Richard Field's, which use a single size of correct-face 'I'. Miscast capitals and ligatures occur both as original abnormalities in a font and as products of replenishment. Antecedent to their appearance in a font is the history of the set of punches or sets of matrices from which they derived. Due to the nature of the type trade in the 16th century, a somewhat limited source of new type forced a homogeneity among fonts which sometimes levels potential discriminants from miscasting. Thus, a miscast letter is not necessarily unique to a single printer's font, since many printers were probably acquiring type from the same few founders during the period. The most obvious evidence of this consists of the small 'W', which is commonly the only version of the letter found in most pica fonts, and several miscast ligatures which are found in these fonts from the 1550's onward. However, given the number of possible combinations and proportions of normal and miscast letters across the upper- and lower-cases and ligatures, composites of same-face fonts usually reveal significant discriminants. "Miscast" is used here generically to denote several kinds of deviation from the normal that are attributable to mistakes at various stages in the type production process. 16 Technically, "miscasting" denotes a flaw in a type caused during the casting stage by the incomplete flow of molten metal into the impression of the letter in the matrix. An example of a possible miscasting occurs in Eld-S in the defective variant F2 which lacks the serif on the cross ( Sej , B1:13, B1v: 14,31, B2:5, B2v:32 vs properly cast F1 at B1:29). However, a misstruck matrix could produce a similar defect: if the punch was not perfectly perpendicular to the face of the blank matrix at the instant of impact, a shallower impression would result on the periphery of the letter opposite to the direction of the punch's slant. 17 The commonness of the defective F2 suggests a misstruck matrix rather than type-caster error, since it appears also in Creede-3 ( Romeo &amp; Juliet Q2 STC22323 [1599], B3:9,23, C2:11 vs normal F1 at B2v:5,10, B3:24) and Creede-4 ( The Regiment of the Church STC1827 [1606], H5:10); and in William White's mixed font (hereafter designated "-M") where most are defective ( Love's Labor Lost STC22294 [1598], A2:1, A3:31,34, A4:26 vs normal F1 at A3v:32, A4:34). In contrast, the 'F' sort in (John) Windet-S and (Richard) Field-S is normal. The existence of both the normal and the defective letter suggests that at least two matrices fed the 'F' sort in these S-fonts. Other kinds of flaws can be attributed to earlier stages of type production. The cutting of a new punch could produce a difference in the width of the metal elements that form the face of the letter so that it prints bolder or finer than normal, as in the fine-printing variants E2 ( LLL , B2:20,21,22) and S2 ( LLL , A3:16,21, A3v:2,21,36) that appear in White's (White-M), John Danter's (Danter-M), Thomas Creede's (Creede-2, Creede-3), and other mixed fonts. Similarly, the justification of the strike by filing down its face could produce a difference in the height-to-paper relative to the other types in a font with the result that the abnormal type protrudes beyond the normal letters after pounding and lockup in the chase and prints boldly. Numerous examples of such bold-printing lower-case letters occur in the fonts surveyed here. Danter-M was replenished with several B-face lower-case letters which are not only obviously too large, but print quite boldly because of the difference in their height-to-paper (see below). Conversely, the impression of a letter in one strike might be shallower than in the strikes of the other letters; the impression could be deepened only by further striking with the same punch. However, if the set of strikes was purchased and then justified elsewhere (a quite common practice), the letters produced from the strike would print lightly because of the reduced height-to-paper. Furthermore, the variations in horizontal and vertical orientation of letters deriving from the same matrix suggest that a matrix could shift position in the mold during the opening and closing process for jettisoning a newly cast type. 18 The most common and useful kind of abnormality consists of the misalignment of a letter in the vertical or horizontal planes so that it either leans or is positioned improperly at the baseline. For example, a strike could be taken with the punch so misaligned vertically that no amount of justifying the strike by filing its long sides could produce a matrix with a correctly aligned letter. Letters cast in the matrix would inevitably lean. A replacement strike from the original punch could be improperly justified at the ends by a new workman to produce a slight displacement from the baseline as established in the original set of matrices. Letters cast in the replacement matrix inevitably would ride high or low at the baseline when mixed in with letters cast in the original matrix. 19 However, this kind of evidence must be approached with caution. Since moveable types are free to shift in relation to other letters, especially when set without leading (a very thin strip of lead set between lines), numerous samples should be examined before concluding that a letter is improperly positioned in the horizontal plane. At times, the displacement is so exaggerated and pervasive that there can be no doubt. For example, the 'G' found in Eld-S in Sejanus and in other S-fonts is so low (0.25mm) that the baseline cuts through the white space inside the letter ("counter"). This low-rider 'G' appears foul-case in Eld-Y1 as a two dimensional discriminant: both wrong-face and miscast. The miscast E3 in Creede-3 ( R&amp;J Q2, A4:19, B1:4, B2v:18,21, C2:35) rides low (0.25mm) and leans right to the point that the adjacent letter sits on the tip of the bottom serif and is easily distinguished from the normal erect letters (B2:37, B2v:37, C1:2, D4: 14, D4v:14,22). The same miscasting appears in White-M ( LLL , A3v:28) along with the fine-printing erect E2 noted above (B2:20,21,22). In contrast, all of the 'E' sort is erect in Eld-S and Windet-S. Creede-4 has about equal proportions of a normal erect E1 and an oversized E4 (3.05mm high) ( Regiment STC1827, B1v:29) which positions correctly on the base-line. Variant D2 which leans left is quite common to S-fonts but occurs in differing proportions. It is the only version in Eld-S ( Sej , B3:4,14,25) and Creede-4, seems to be the only S-face 'D' in White-M ( LLL , A4:3, B1:29,36, B1v:10,11), and seems slightly in the majority in Creede-3 ( R&amp;J Q2, leaning: A3v:19,21, B1v: 20, D3:16; normal D1: A3v:34, B1v:29, C3v:8, D3v:3). Normal D1 is exclusive in (Simon) Stafford-EF. A fairly uncommon miscast T2, in which the thin cross slants downward to the right, seems in the majority in White-M ( LLL , A2:10,12,13,24,25), while the sort in Creede-3 is evenly distributed between the normal T1 ( R&amp;J Q2, A3v:1,2,3, A4v:5,6) and slanted cross T2 (A4v:14, 20,29); it is infrequent in (Valentine) Simmes-S ( Richard III Q1 STC22314 [1597], E4v:19,26), but dominates Danter-M ( Titus Andronicus STC22328 [1594], C1:22) along with the foul-case 68mm 'T' (C1:16), and does not appear in Eld-S, Windet-S, Field-S or Creede-4. The divergence in same-face fonts caused by acquisition and replenishment from different sources at different times is suggested by the combinations which occur. Eld's low-rider 'G' appears along with low-rider 'B C F K L M P R T', but correctly aligned 'I', in Creede-4 ( Antichrist , STC7120, [2]H—M; Monsieur d'Olive STC4983 [1606], A, B(i)). Some of these letters appear in Eld-S, but are in closer alignment with normal letters, suggesting that the two original fonts were purchased from separate foundries, one of which used several misjustified replacement matrices to produce Creede-4. Eld probably replenished from this foundry, but the misjustified matrices were, by chance, more closely aligned to the matrices used by the first founder. On the other hand, the 'G' is normal in White-M ( LLL ) and Creede-3 ( R&amp;J Q2). Windet-S and Field-S, in contrast, use all non-deviant capitals, suggesting a single uniformly justified set of matrices at one foundry. It is frequently impossible to determine whether a letter is miscast although repeated examination creates an impression of a distinct abnormality. A small portion of White's 'C' sort rides low (0.2mm) ( LLL , A3v:26, A2v:29, A2:8) while most are normally positioned (the Creede-3 sort is similar), but the effect is not so pronounced as to imply miscasting, since the baseline is normally distorted in this mixed font. Yet the fact that some print this way is a potential discriminant, since all of Eld's are aligned correctly. Moreover, the perceived difference may simply result from replenishment, since new clean-printing letters are bound to look different than old worn versions; the resulting layers of newness also are a potential discriminant. 20 In addition to misalignment in the vertical and horizontal planes, the two letters forming a poorly cut ligature can be improperly oriented with respect to each other. These are especially prevalent in S-fonts, where variants occur in which one letter leans and produces a narrower gap between the letters at the baseline, or one letter is above the baseline. The skewed letters of ligatures make clear the difficulty of cutting a punch with perfectly aligned letters. 21 S-fonts seem to vary in the number of types available in their ligature sorts. Eld-S, Simmes-S, Field-S and Creede-4 almost exclusively set an 'ſſ' or 'ſſi', while Windet-S frequently resorts to alternate settings with combinations of 's', tall-ſ, 'ſi', and 'i'. However, the 'ſſi', 'ſ ſi' and 'ſſl' ligatures occur at low-frequency so that locating one in a text is difficult at times. But the miscast 'ſt' with the leaning 't' is so pervasive in S-fonts that the discriminating factor usually is the proportion between new, bold-printing (ſt2) and older-appearing ligatures (ſt1). In Sejanus , two old letters can be seen at C1:11,12 among a dozen new samples. Damage usually consists of a flattening or distortion of the curve of the shoulder of the 'ſ' and can be seen in the "new" letters at C1:3,30. In contrast, five new letters ( LLL , A4v:18,30, B1:4, 10,34) are found among nine damaged in White-M, and the two are about equal in Simmes-S ( Mal Q3, C2:7,8). A crisper, deeper impression in the matrix(ces) probably accounts for the difference in weight and distinctness of the two 'ſt', as must be the case with the 'ſſ' ligature. Heavy inking on the inside of the left 'ſ' seems responsible for a bold apparent variant ſſ2 with the left 'f' curving inward at the baseline (White-M, Titus , B4:12). The left shoulder often prints as an oblique straight-line. The consistent inking effect suggests a variant punch although there is no measurable difference. Some erect, normal appearing ſſ1 can be found in most S-fonts (Eld-S, Sej , D1:28; Field-S, Arte of Poesie STC20519 [1589], D4:25,26,35) along with the apparent variant ( Sej , C3v:31; Arte , D4:27). A single punch doubtlessly produced all these 'ſſ' ligatures. The 'ſh' appears in S-fonts in a normal version ſh1 along with two common miscastings. In ſh2, the 'ſ' and ascender of the 'h' lean right in varying degrees, while the right stem of the 'h' is erect; the foot of the 'ſ' is above the baseline (0.15mm) while the feet of the 'h' are generally level at the baseline; the body of the type frequently seems to lean right. In ſh3, the 'ſ' and right stem of the 'h' are erect, the ascender of the 'h' slants to the right, and all three feet are even on the baseline. 22 The frequent juxtaposition of the leaning ligatures, particularly the 'ſh', with round letters (o e) in combination with inking of the base-serifs often creates an optical illusion that the left and the right foot ride respectively above and below the base line, although at high magnification this effect can be discounted. It is worth noting that Braddock-Y1 was replenished with a miscasting similar to ſh2, quite possibly the same ( MND Q1, D1v:26), which perhaps was part of the purchase that introduced the S-face 'ſt' noted below. The letters of variant ff1 are correctly aligned (spaced 1.15mm), and the long right shoulder terminates horizontally in a small pear and extends 1.15-1.2mm beyond the right 'f'; the right shoulder of miscut variant ff2 curves into a sharp tip and extends 1.05mm beyond the ascender; the broadly curved left shoulder separates the misaligned letters 1.2-1.25mm (at 0.4mm above the x-line) which then converge to a spacing of 1.1-1.15mm at the baseline; the left 'f' is slightly higher in most. Misjustified matrices contribute low-riding miscastings of both variants (ff1: Danter-M, Coblers Prophesies STC 25781 [1594], C1:7, C4v:32; LLL , B2v:11, C2:27, C3:32. ff2: LLL , B2v:11, C2:27, C3:32) as well as correctly aligned ligatures (ff1: Sej , C3:20, C3v:4; Creede-1, Selimus STC 12310a [1594], D1:32 "off"). ff2: Sej , C1v:22; Simmes-S, R3, B3:35, D2v:31; Creede-2, Selimus , D2:32 'effeminate"). Both variants that appear in the 'fl' sort are miscut with the letters converging toward the baseline. The two are easily distinguished by height (fl1: 2.75-2.85mm, see Sej , B4:24, C4:17. fl2: 2.9-3.05mm, see R3 , E3v:35, E4:6; Read-S, Cynthia's Revels , STC14733 [1601], B3v:6,14,30,35); the misalignment is less pronounced in fl1 (above x-line: 1.2mm, baseline: 1.15mm) than in fl2 (1.25mm, 1.1-1.15mm). A third variant with correctly aligned letters appears in Creede-1 and White-M although it may not belong to the S-face set of punches (fl3: 2.7-2.8mm high, 1.15-1.2mm wide; see Selimus , C4v:23 "flight", C4v:24 "flies"; LLL , G3:7). The right-leaning 'i' of miscast variant fi2 (2.85-2.9mm high) produces a width of 1.2mm at the upslanting cross and 1.05 mm at the baseline; the 'i' often appears to ride high and the ligature frequently leans right (Danter-M, Coblers , C3:5; White-M, LLL , A4:2, Fools , D1v:20). An 'ſt' with right-leaning 't' (ſt1) is common in Y-fonts, although the lean is not so pronounced as in the S-face ligature since the portion of the 't' below the cross is closer to the vertical. Short-Y contains a large proportion of the ligature in which the deviation is so slight that the 't' appears erect ( R3 , H2:26,29,33), although the shoulder over-extends the 't' so that the top-half of the 't' leans right (ſt1b). Eld-Y1 includes a small proportion of this version ( Mal Q2, C4:20,21, C4v:7). A second version in which both letters lean right and the 't' rides high (ſt2) is also common to Y-fonts, appearing in low proportion in Short-Y ( R3 , H2:13,37) and Eld-Y1, but in the majority in Braddock-Y1 ( MND Q1, D3:1,15,27,31); the latter was replenished with a significant number of S-face 'ſt' which is quite obvious because of size ( MND Q1, D3v:6,21, F3v:28,29). The 'ſt' sort in Braddock-Y2 is split evenly between the leaning 't' (ſt2) ( Antichrist STC7120, [1]B3v:1,11,18) and partially erect 't' (ſt1b) ([1]B3v:27,32), both of which equal the 'G' in height. Neither the Garamond nor Guyot 'ſt' with the tall 't' and right-angle shoulder junction seem to appear in Y-fonts. Common miscastings occur in two other ligatures. A miscast ſi2 with right-leaning 'ſ' (or left-leaning 'i') is the majority variant in Eld-Y1 ( Mal Q1-2, E2:5 "pleasingly" vs normal ſi1 E2:4 "sinne"), in the minority in Purfoot-Y, almost exclusive in Field-Y ( Observations in the Arte of English Poesie STC4543 [1602], A7:8 "sillables" vs ſi1 A7:7 "consisting") but less frequent in Braddock-Y1 ( MND , D1v:17) and -Y2, and rare in Short-Y. A miscast fi2 with a high-riding 'i' and the cross accordingly slanted upward likewise is almost exclusive in Field-Y ( Observations , B1:6,8), of about equal proportions in Eld-Y1 ( Mal Q1-2, E3:5) with the normal version ( Mal Q1-2, E2:3,25), and uncommon in Braddock-Y1 and Short-Y. Although samples of most lower-case letters are available in large quantities in a text, their value as discriminants is somewhat undercut by their size and penchant for sustaining damage and distortion through extended usage. Generally, wrong-face upper-case letters are obvious to the naked eye because of stylistic differences, but identifying miscast and wrong-size lowercase pica letters is difficult if not impossible except at high magnification, since the measurable differences often amount to less than 0.1mm. Inking effects easily obscure this magnitude of variation, especially when new types ink more boldly. Read-S provides examples of replenishment with obvious Y-face letters in several sorts. Graceful Y-face 'a' variants distinguished by the shoulder, which extends to the left of the bowl, appear in varying proportions, accounting on some pages for about 30% of the total ( Revels , B3v), and in lower proportions on others such as I2, where six (I2:4,20,23,24,26,31) are found among 72 older S-face 'a', reflecting the random recurrence of low-level replenished letters in page-length textual units. The Y-face 'k' variants and squat S-face k2 (junction height: 0.75mm) appear in roughly equal proportions, as on B3v where the ratio is 5:6, and both are in good condition, suggesting proximate replenishment without concern for stylistic integrity. Some pages show a few older S-face k1 (junction height: 0.65mm) (E1v:9,14) with worn serifs. The ratio of Y- and S-face 'p' is about 1:2 (C2v, 6:11). The fact that wrong-face letters occur in just a few lower-case sorts is a useful discriminant between Read-S and mixed fonts such as Danter-M and White-M, which exhibit variants in most sorts. The frequent skewing of type also is a pivotal factor in lessening the value of lower-case letters as discriminants and increases the need to cross-check against other fonts in order to establish whether a given letter is actually abnormal. A survey of many pages of Revels such as B3v, for example, reveals that a vertical shifting of type during the locking-up of the forme skewed many lines and as a result moved many types above and below the distorted baseline. Judgments about specific types are thus rendered difficult. In many instances, examination of such letters at high magnification in originals reveals that they actually are positioned correctly on the baseline, and the illusion of horizontal displacement is caused by inking effects. Read-S was replenished with miscast and oversized letters in several sorts. The 't' sort is about equally distributed between normal, worn letters (t1) that lean slightly to the right (height: 1.8-1.95mm depending on wear) and a new oversized, usually erect t3 (height: 2.3-2.45mm) which positions correctly and is distinguished by an accentuated hooked terminal at the baseline (see Revels , B4v:16 "that" and B4v:22 "but the" for juxtaposed samples). The new type inks more boldly, emphasizing the size difference and spreading the ink-smear below the base-line, although the foot of the letter is actually positioned correctly. The same t3 appears in White-M, where it actually does ride low (0.2-0.25mm) and leans right ( LLL , A2:7 "then", A2: 18,19). In contrast, the 't' sort of Creede-3 includes a normal, erect t1 ( R&amp;J Q2, A4:4 "it") and a normal-size replenished 't' with a severe right-lean (t2) that, even with heavy inking, is correctly positioned on the base-line (A4:4, "part"). This letter seems slightly taller than the normal because the top has not yet been worn down. In general, discriminants consisting of miscast and wrong-size lower-case letters are limited to a few sorts in pica fonts, partly because of the limited sources of new types, and certainly because of the difficulty of detecting abnormal letters with any certainty. High-frequency letters such as 'c e l r s' seem useless as discriminants because of the absence of inherent distinguishing features. The cross of the S-face 'e', for example, appears to rotate through a range of about 8 degrees above and below the horizontal, suggesting a potential discriminant. However, the simultaneous appearances of 'e' with varying degrees of rotation in fonts such as Creede-1 and Creede-2 ( Selimus STC 12310a) indicates a misstrike, misjustification, matrix-wobble during casting, or common damage. 23 Variations in inking, paper-stretch, and wear frequently obscure the stylistic differences in actual variants and abnormal letters and can be resolved only at high magnification in originals. For example, S-fonts commonly have three variants in the 'n' and 'u' sorts which differ in newness, height, width and weight (boldness). The height of vertical letter elements, particularly serifed ascenders and stems, varies according to the amount of wear and the kind of damage a letter has experienced so that dimensions must be expressed as a range of values (as in the following examples). Variant u1 (1.05mm wide, 1.7-1.8mm high) and the tall u2 (1.1mm wide, 1.9-2.0mm high) frequently appear identical because of these factors. The u2 at Revels B3v:22 inked lightly just to the edge of the top-serifs with no excess ink to blot upward as the wetted paper stretched around the top-serif during impression; in contrast, the short u1 at B3v:23 ("would") inked heavily and exhibits the stretch effect. Both types exhibit the common distortion caused by beating the type during lock-up: the left serif is depressed into the type because of the absence of support and the stem is bent inward slightly (see u2, Fools , F1:16, vs new u2, E2v:17) while the right serif is pushed upward rather than depressed because of the support provided to the malletblow by the left stem. As a result, the top of the letter slants upward, with left-stem heights of 1.7mm (u1) and 1.8mm (u2) and right-stem heights of 1.8mm (u1) and 1.95mm (u2). The printed images of the two 'u' variants (B3v:22,23) are nearly identical in height (1.85/1.9mm vs 1.8/1.95mm) and indistinguishable with the naked eye. Variant u3, which is exclusive in Eld-S ( Sej , B3:2,3), is slightly narrower (0.95-1.0mm) and of normal height (1.7mm), but when encountered in the context of other variants and the uneven inking and printing characteristics of a mixed font such as White-M ( LLL , A3:4 "but", 24 "but"), it is easily confused with a lightly inked worn u1 or the tall u4 (0.95mm wide, 1.9mm high) ( LLL , A3:2 "studie"). Similarly, inking and paper-stretch effects frequently confuse medium variant n1 (1.1mm wide, 1.65-1.75mm high) and bold, wide n2 (1.15mm wide, 1.7-1.8mm high), but since both commonly appear together, their value as discriminants is lessened. However, both can be confused with two miscastings that are valuable. Bold variant n3 is wider at the baseline (1.15mm vs 1.05mm) because the left stem leans ( Revels , B3v:2 "and"; LLL , A3:15 "blinded"), while the left stem of n4 bows outward to 1.15mm at the center ( Sej , B3:4 "mine", 11 "unto") to appear wider although the separation of stems is 1.1mm at the baseline. The 'w' especially is prone to creating an illusion of extra height and low positioning, since the paper stretches along the pointed apexes and down into the type-shoulder during impression. About 30% of Read's 'w' sort is oversized (height: 1.9mm) and usually rides low (w2) ( Revels , C2v:14,15,17), although a far greater portion merely seems oversized. The same is true of White-M, Creede-3 and other fonts in which the w2 variant occurs. A condensed "tight" 'w' (width: 1.55mm) ( Revels , B1v:16, B3v:26, C1:18,32, I3:26) that prints with distinct apexes and lacks a center serif is difficult to decipher and illustrates one kind of problem associated with pica lower-case letters. Since no equivalent variant appears in contemporary S-fonts, the likely conclusion is that it should be dismissed as undefinable. However, it is a genuine variant that appears in an S-font used by Henry Bynneman some thirty years earlier ( The Enimie of Idlenesse STC11476 [1568], prefatory letter, [unsigned verso]: 8,10,12,13,22). By 1579, the condensed 'w' had been replaced by the normal S-face letter. However, it remains in John Allde's S-font as late as 1580 ( A Warning for the Wise STC5259, C4:4 etc.). The newer majority w2 in White-M always rides low ( LLL , A2:13) and appears along with an alternate-face 'w' (A2:23) as well as low-frequency remnants of the Guyot short second-stem 'w' (A2:14, A3:10). Creede-3 uses a distinctive w3 (introduced via Creede-2) in which the outer stems print finely and seem to bow outward, with serifs inside the stems ( R&amp;J Q2, A4v:2,13); it appears oversized in some instances (A4v:16 "swoong"). This w3 occurs in White-M and Stafford-EF as well as in S-fonts and is integral to the EF-face. In contrast, Eld-S and Windet-S lack the 'w' variants found in the above fonts. Overall, the comparison of these letters in several S-fonts is necessary to distinguish miscast letters from normal letters whose appearance is modified by inking and impression. It seems that useful miscastings are even more limited in Y-fonts. Two variants of 't' were introduced into Eld-Y1, including a leaning low-rider t2 ( Essayes STC18041, Yy1v:3 "it" "their"; Antichrist STC7120, [2]A2v:2,3,4) and an erect t1 which positions correctly (Yy1v:9 "wittily"). By mid-1604, the proportion of the leaning version diminished ( Mal Q1, B4v:14 "witty" and B4v:16 "vnutterable", where it is juxtaposed to quite normal letters) with further replenishment by the normal t1. Braddock-Y1 (1598) and -Y2 (1603) show a roughly equal distribution between erect t1 and a leaning t2, both of which position correctly ( MND Q1, D1:7,8,9; Antichrist STC7120, [1]B2:5); Purfoot-Y1 is similar. Short-Y includes a low proportion of t1 ( R3 , H1:4,13, 17) and a very few low-riding t2 like Eld's that generally print more boldly ( R3 , H1:15,32, H1v:12,23,37). The 'w' sort includes four variants in Y-fonts. w2 is taller than normal (Short-Y, R3 , H2:14,15,16). The left stem of w3 is taller than the right so that the top of the letter appears to slant downward to the right (Eld-Y1, Mal Q2, C1:1,12,22). This variant is probably attributable to a misstrike with the punch leaning to the left and producing an impression with uneven lateral depth. It is difficult to explain the w4 variant in which the right 'v' is quite short (1.4mm vs a normal 1.7mm) (Eld-Y1, Fools , B4v:15,32). A severely damaged punch seems the only possibility. Finally, rather high concentrations of wrong-face and wrong-size punctuation (especially in Y-fonts) present a confusing situation. The distinction between replenishment and fouling is academic here since all printers had complementary fonts as a source of foul-case punctuation marks in black letter, italic, and larger faces. However, the appearance of several sizes of comma in Braddock-Y1 and Short-Y suggests deliberate replenishment, at least in regard to the size normally found in 96mm fonts; the 108mm variants are so grossly oversized as to suggest fouling. Commas are especially difficult to work with due to paper stretch and the effects produced by medial vs terminal justification. As a result, the 96mm and 108mm commas frequently cannot be reliably distinguished from each other, although they are usually distinguishable from heavily-inked normal commas. 24</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Despite the overall uniformity of a typeface, stylistic variations in some minor aspects of the design of a letter, the width of a letter, and serif formation occurred which provide a category of internal discriminants for distinguishing same-face fonts. These divide into two groups, depending upon whether the stylistic variation is obvious to the naked eye, or whether examination and measurement at high magnification is necessary for discrimination. 25 The latter is generally true of Y-face variants and S-face 'k' variants. In instances such as the S-face 'n' and 'u' noted earlier, a difference can be sensed because of the heavy inking of these letters, but both widths randomly appear bold, or as in the case of the 't', the actual horizontal positioning is confused by heavy inking of the underside of the foot. When the 'n u' appear amidst other wrongface bold variants as in Danter-M and Creede-3, the difficulty of sorting them out with the naked eye is aggravated. 26 In the S-face, the vertical and oblique stress along with accentuated serifs render the diagonal letters 'x y z' especially susceptible to illusions. Variations in inking and damage to the stems and serifs of the two 'y' variants often suggest stylistic differences, but the variants are identical except that the right diagonal of "tiny" y2 ("Le Be" specimens 12, 13) is shorter (2.55mm vs 2.7mm). Both exhibit an enclosed angle of 45 degrees, a heavily stressed left stem and a quite fine right diagonal terminated in an offset-left ball, with top-serifs extending 0.25mm on both sides of the diagonals. y1 usually rides correctly, although miscasting sometimes causes a left-lean so that the right top-serif extends above the x-line, while y2 seems always to ride high (as much as 0.4mm: Creede-1,2, Sel , D1:11,12, D1v:4; Simmes-S, R3 , C4v:2). S-fonts use both wide x1 and expanded x2 variants that are frequently indistinguishable without magnification because of wear, damage and inking of the accentuated serifs of the expanded variant. The left top- and base-serifs of many expanded x2 in Field-S fail to ink on the outside, making them appear narrower ( Arte , E3:22, "extraordinary" vs "extol-"), although the diagonals cross at a right angle. A faulty strike from the x2 punch produced this defective x3, which is quite common and seen in Creede-3 ( R&amp;J Q2, B1v:31) and other S-fonts. However, both the wide x1 and x2 appear in Simmes-S ( Hamlet Q1 STC22275, E1:27,34; Mal Q1, F3:4 "extinct", F3:7 "fixt") and are differentiated by the diagonal crossing angle (x2,3: 90 deg., x1: 72 deg.). Two common variants of 'z' occur. Wide z1 (1.6-1.65mm wide across tips of serifs, diagonal: 2.4mm) usually prints fine ( LLL , D3:19; Sej , C4v:13; Coblers , C2:13; Sel , D3v:7); expanded z2 (1.75mm, diagonal: 2.55mm) is squarish and bolder ( LLL , A3:14; Sej , D2:14; Sel , D3v:15; R3 , E4:35). Oppositely inked z1 and z2 are difficult to distinguish except at high magnification. Other useful obvious S-face variants occur in the 'b f g h i k' sorts. Two apparent 'b' variants (bold: b2) probably can be credited to a difference in the depth of impression in the matrices which supplied them, since both exhibit the same acute enclosed angle of the bowl-top junction with the ascender and length of oblique fineline (0.7mm), and the same bowl-width (1.3mm) and separation between bowl-junctions on the ascender (1.3mm). The junction-angle of taller (3.1mm vs 2.9mm), wider (1.35mm) variant b3 is roughly the same, but the oblique fineline is longer (0.9mm) and the bowl junctions are separated by 1.45mm; the bottom of the bowl joins the ascender almost horizontally at the baseline, whereas it curves upward to form the junction in b1-2 ( d'Olive , E1v:11 "best" vs "be"; Whore , D3:2 "ru b1 b3 ers"). Both d1-d2 are tall letters (2.9-3.05mm high) with a marked left counter and acute bowl-junction angles but differ in the separation of junctions on the ascender (d1: 1.15mm; d2: 1.25mm); the bowl-stroke of the narrower d1 (1.15-1.175mm) forms an inverted pear-shaped counter that often seems awkward; in d2, the stroke thickens as the bowl widens toward the baseline (top: 1.15mm vs 1.2mm). In both, the ascender broadens to a slanted termination sans top-serif (d1: LLL , A3v:10,11,13,14; Whore , A3v:5 "dinner", C3v:15 "heard", d2: LLL , A3v:33 "made", B4:14 "helde"; Whore , A2v:2 "behold", 9 "ashamde"). The thicker d2 almost invariably prints bold; oppositely inked d1-2 are usually indistinguishable (see LLL , B4:21 "d2 i d1"). New clean-printing samples of the tall (2.9-2.95mm) f1 variant exhibit a slightly stressed ascender which thins as it curves smoothly high above the cross (0.9mm) into the shoulder that broadens and terminates horizontally in a small pear ( Sel , D1:15, D2: 4,5). The right half of the base-serif frequently bends downward in good letters ( LLL , A2v:15, A3:9; R3 A4:4), a result either of damage or a misstrike. Flattening damage to the shoulder, downward bending of the pear, and heavy inking of the ascender and underside of the shoulder create a variety of appearances. However, a separate punch is probably responsible for variant f2 which is similar to f1 except that the bolder ascender bends to an oblique line which curves over at the h-line and downward into a larger pear ( LLL , B4:5 vs B4:6). The uncommon shorter (2.65-2.75mm) f3 variant with a bold ascender and flat shorter shoulder (1.15-1.2mm) terminated in a slight pear dominates Eld-S ( Sej , B1v:31, B2:22; Sel , H1:13,16); it probably is imported from a smaller face, also appearing in Eld-Y1 ( Fools , B4:28). The narrower EF-face 'f' appears in mixed fonts ( LLL , B2:34 "confesse") and also in S-fonts that have been extensively replenished (Simmes-S, R3 , A4:10 "if"; Read-S, Revels , D4v:4). Two 'g' variants occur. g1 leans left because the body, link and loop are vertically aligned at the left, and exhibits a left counter and extra-long ear ( Sej , B3:5; LLL , A3:7 "lyght"). The left lean is less pronounced in some letters, probably because of matrix-wobble. Creede-3 uses roughly equal portions of g1 ( R&amp;J Q2, A4v:3 "go",16,18) and the vertically aligned g2 with a smaller bowl ( R&amp;J Q2, A4v:6 "judgement") (see later discussion). Three 'h' variants occur. The smaller h1 (1.075mm wide, 2.9mm high) is common, while the larger h2 (1.125-1.15mm wide, 3.0mm high) is less frequent; the ascender usually seems to lean right although the vertical elements are parallel and, as with b2 and d2, h2 invariably prints bold because of the thick face elements (Simmes-S, R3 , F4v:4; Read-S, Revels , B4v:4; White-M, LLL , B4:14 "helde", 15 "with", Fools , C1:4 "thriftie", I3v:25 "this"). The ascender (2.85-2.9mm) of miscast h3 leans right (x-line width: 1.05mm, baseline: 1:15mm), usually prints bold ( d'Olive , E2v:9 "with", 10; Fools , I2v: 11 "have", E4v:24 "her"; Whore , A2v:17 "had") and is easily confused with the EF-face miscast (normal) 'h'. Two 'i' variants occur. In the common version i1, the dot is vertically aligned with the letter and is positioned at the tips of triangular top-serifs. In the fairly rare i2, the dot is to the left of the letter and below the h-line. Simmes-S and Field-S use the left-dotted i2 exclusively, while Creede-3 divides between the original i2 and the center-dot i1 from Creede-2 ( R&amp;J Q2, A4:21 "enemies"; A4:18 "villaine"); Creede-4 uses the common i1. Finally, three "squat" 'k' variants appear in S-fonts, but these are difficult to distinguish except at high magnification. The common k1 and k2 are differentiated by the height of the junction of the arm-leg link with the ascender (k1: 0.65mm; k2: 0.75mm); the arm and leg, oriented 45 degrees above and below horizontal, form a right angle and are tipped with accentuated serifs which, in k1, usually are worn to nubs and produce a narrower appearance. The shorter arm (0.65mm) of variant k3 is at a higher angle (52 deg.) and extends 0.9mm beyond the ascender (vs 1.0mm in k1-k2); the low (0.65mm) junction of the arm-leg link on the ascender is at an oblique angle rather than perpendicular (Simmes-S, R3 , E1v:10, E2v:13; Field-S, Arte , D4v:1, E3v:3; Creede-4, Antichrist , [2]H1:35, H2:30). The low junction permits distinguishing k3 from the EF-face oblique-junction k2 (0.65mm vs 0.85mm). Unlike the S-face, the Y-face exhibits considerable susceptibility to damage and wear which tend to obscure the stylistic features of letters. Routine battering and the beating of the type into place in the chase during locking-up of the forme wreaked havoc with lower-case letters, especially complex forms such as 'a k y' and some ligatures. The consequent changes in shape and inking caused by battering often create the appearance of variants when, in fact, the suspected variants probably derive from the same punch or matrix. This is also true of miscast letters which lean or displace from the baseline. The general principle that the form of a letter can be inferred from the combination of traits that recur consistently in most samples must, therefore, be applied with extreme caution when working from reproductions. 27 The diversity in Y-face letter appearance caused by battering and inking is no where more apparent than in the 'a'. Any page of text in old type seems to exhibit a plethora of variants, but these usually can be reduced to four or five at most by analysis of the shapes and orientation of portions of the letter. 28 The bowl's diagonal top-stroke in variants a1-2 is at a high angle (28 degrees above horizontal) and joins directly to the back with an enclosed angle that varies because of the differing back structures of the two (see list of samples in Appendix following 'k' variants). In a1, the shoulder stroke curves directly into the straight back which is usually perpendicular to the baseline, producing an enclosed junction angle of 62 degrees, although the right edge of the back gathers ink above the junction and frequently appears curved to the naked eye. In contrast, the shoulder stroke of a2 continues to curve slightly inward to the center of the bowl, then bends to the right and abruptly reverses direction at the baseline to form a "fishing hook" serif which terminates vertically. The enclosed junction angle is difficult to measure, since the straight top-stroke joins a curving back. The back of a1 curves broadly at the baseline to form a long (0.45-0.5mm) hook that points upward at about 35 degrees; it symmetrically balances the curve at the top of the back, but is frequently jammed inward to approximate the a2 hook or is blunted. Unlike the Fell and Le Be 'a', the oblique left portion of the shoulder strokes of both a1-2 are unstressed and thin imperceptibly (if at all); both are terminated with a pear (larger and longer in a2, but often blunted) that extends slightly beyond the edge of the bowl in new letters (0.05mm); damage to the terminations produces a longer, flatter appearance or a tightly curved shoulder that terminates short of the bowl's edge. Infrequent samples of both (15%) print a medial bend because of ink accumulation although the shoulder is a continuous curve. In both variants, the fine oblique top-stroke drops directly to form the oval left edge of the bowl and usually inks as a sharp angle; this contrasts with the Fell and Le Be bowls which are formed by a curving top-stroke that broadens into the bowl's oval edge. Finally, the bowl of a1 is slightly higher (0.65 vs 0.6mm) as measured between bottom and top junctions on the back; conversely, the peak of a2's shoulder is slightly higher above the top junction (0.75 vs 0.7mm). These dimensions remain remarkably constant despite the condition of the letters. The top-stroke of variants a3-4 is at a lower angle (22 deg.) and the final 0.1mm bends to form a perpendicular junction with the straight back. The dimensions of a3 are identical to a2 (bowl-height of 0.6mm, 0.75mm top junction to shoulder-peak), but the base-serif is broad as in a1. The straight back is usually vertical but appears to lean slightly right in a small number of samples. a4 appears slightly taller because of a lower bowl (0.55mm, 0.8mm top junction to shoulder-peak), and the "fishing hook" base-serif is rather tall (0.55mm). The straight top-stroke curves into the oval of the bowl to produce a rounded appearance, but not nearly as much as in the Fell 'a'. Given the susceptibility of the 'y' to damage, a wide range of appearances occurs, but just two punches supplied the 'y' sort. Variant y1 exhibits a wider apex angle (42 deg.) than y2 (38 deg.) The lightly stressed left diagonal accentuates its apparent width. The right diagonal is slightly longer than in y2 (2.7mm vs 2.65mm) and terminates at the bottom with a round ball, while the termination of y2 is oval and offset to the left of the diagonal. Flat top-serifs extend 0.25mm on both sides of the diagonals of y1; the outside of the left top-serif frequently is bent upward, and both serifs experience damage and wear which reduces the outside portion (y1: Essays , Yy1v:15 "your" [2]; MND , B1v:14 "euery"; Poetaster STC14781 [1602], B2:7 "day", 8; LLL , A3v:9 "say", 11 "day"). The top-serifs of y2 slant downward and extend 0.3mm on the insides of the diagonals; in new samples, the left top-serif has a very slight nub outside the diagonal which is quickly eradicated (y2: Essays , Yy1v:11 "by"; MND , B1v:12 "choyce", 13 "boyes"; Poetaster , B2:12 "thy", 13 "my"; LLL , A2v:2, A3:7 "whyle"). Both variants appear together in most Y-fonts, although y2 seems exclusive in Short-Y. Miscasting seems responsible for apparent variants of both in which the letter is rotated counter-clockwise on the apex. Damage to y2 produces an inward-bowing right diagonal both above and below the baseline. The variety of appearances in the 'k', unlike most other sorts, actually indicates a large number of variant letters, all uniform in style with minor but consistent differences in structure and dimensions. Vulnerability to normal bending damage is limited to the area of the letter below the link which connects the arm-leg to the ascender. While other portions of the letter have relatively broad foundations on the type-body, the counter enclosed by the leg, link, and foot of the ascender eliminated internal support so that a "knee" bend frequently occurs in the leg, and the foot bends inward. Neither element ever bends outward. In contrast, bending damage is rare in the fineline arm which seems most vulnerable; the exposed arm-serif, however, normally experiences wear, bending, and blunting, often being reduced to a dot in old letters and sometimes bent in-line with the arm. Three different size ranges occur. The height of the correct-size 'k' ranges from 2.75-2.85mm, depending upon the condition of triangular top-serif, which is rounded, blunted, or worn off in older letters. Anomalous undersized variants probably were cut for smaller faces (about 70mm bare 20-line height) and in most cases ride slightly high and usually lean slightly right. The sophistication required of a punchcutter in controlling a letter's printed appearance while working within nearly identical size parameters is evident in as much as these smaller 'k' always seem "tiny" despite the fact that the junction height (0.85mm), the length of the link (0.4-0.45mm), and the extension of arm and leg (0.85-0.9mm) to the right of the ascender duplicate the dimensions of correct-size letters. The new "tiny" 'k' at LLL A2v:13, for example, exhibits a normal height of 2.85mm, a junction height of 0.9mm, a medium length (0.5mm) link, and a quite short (0.35mm) high-angle (52 deg.) arm topped by a massive 0.95mm crescent. Yet the letter looks tiny amidst S-face letters in White-M, as does another 'k' in Read-S ( Revels , C3v:29 "lookt"). The effect is similar in Y-fonts: the small 2.5-2.65mm 'k' variants with 0.8-0.9mm arm-leg extensions look tiny in Eld-Y1 ( Mal Q2, B2v:7 "looke", C2:31 "harke"; Q3, H1v:15, H2:21; Fools , G1v:14 "knocking", G2v:23 "knowing"), in later White-M ( Fools , C2v:25 "take", C4:16 "thinke", I1v:17 "drunke"), and Allde-Y1 ( Granados Deuotions STC 16902 [1598], p. 23:17). The variety of undersized 'k' provide useful discriminants. For example, an anomalous 'k' with a low-angle arm (42 deg.) and long leg (0.95mm) which extends a full 1.0mm occurs in late Eld-Y1 ( Fools , H1v:31 "locke") but apparently not in other Y-fonts. However, caution is required in assuming that a potential 'k' discriminant is undersized. Old, very worn normal 'k' variants with reduced height-to-paper and element width, such as those encountered in late White-M in Fools (CD, I), generally look like a 2.5-2.65mm letter even in originals, but measure 2.7-2.8mm at high magnification. At the opposite end of the scale, 2.95mm 'k' variants with correspondingly high (0.95-1.05mm) junctions appear in Y-fonts. The Braddock-Y1 tall (2.95mm) variant k7 is a scaled-up version of normal elegant k1 differentiated by a higher junction (0.95-1.0mm), longer link (0.55mm), shorter (0.55mm) high-angle (48 deg.) arm, and long leg (1.0mm) which extends beyond the arm (0.9mm vs 1.0mm). The letter as often rides low and leans right ( MND , C4v:8 "makes", D2:11 "talke") as not (D1:16 "quake", D2:1 "looke") and appears in Read-S ( Revels , I3v:3 "thinke" etc.). The apex of the triangular top-serif of the tall variants is commonly sheared or blunted and prints with a flat top. The intermediate stage of the process is evident in the letter at MND C4v:24 ("skill"), where blunting has flattened the apex of the triangle and pushed the apex metal into a small spur (0.1mm) on the right of the ascender. This peculiar form of damage is uncommon in other 'k' variants where the apex of the top-serif is usually rounded by wear. The effect of newness on apparent size is obvious when new "elegant" k1 are visually compared without magnification to the tall variant k7. A new k1 in Braddock-Y2 is directly beneath a 'p' ( Poetaster , D4v:7/8), a setting which totally eliminates paper-stretch effects and permits an accurate measurement of the height of 2.8mm. Other samples measure up to 2.9mm (B2:3 "workes", B3v:4 "broken"). A folio prose setting such as Essays STC18041 apparently reduces overall paper-stretch since the new k1 in Eld-Y1 measures 2.75-2.8mm (Yy1v:19 "speake", 27 "talke" etc.). Furthermore, the new ascender element in both Braddock-Y2 and Eld-Y1 is wide with distinct edges not yet rounded by beating during lock-up. The same is true of other new Y-face 'k' variants noted in the Appendix. A few simple variants appear in Y-fonts. Short's i3, l2, and t2 are cast on a narrow body and are left-justified so that the crammed spacing is obvious in various combinations of the letters ( R3 Q1, H3v:8 "will", H3v:13 "it", H4v:4 "vnwillingnes", H4v:10 "enuie", "selfe", H4v:33 "shortlie", H2:24 "left"). The narrow 'i' dots at the tip of the triangular top-serifs of tall letters. Variants include a normally spaced i1 with high dot and i2 that dots slightly beneath the top-serif of tall letters ( Fawne , D1v:15 "vile"). The difference is apparent with crisp new letters. The left-justified t2 appears also in Field-Y where the unsuccessful kerning with the 'f' is quite obvious ( Observations , A8:16 "after"). Most Y-fonts use the normally justified letters. In general, the Y-face seems to include relatively few internal variants, suggesting a closely guarded source of matrices from the seminal set of punches. On the other hand, it seems probable that the punchcutter responsible for the S-face cut two sizes in the same style, given the striking correspondence of stylistic features in the normal b1, d1, h1 and the slightly larger but otherwise identical b3, d2 and h2; copying by a second punchcutter seems impossible in this instance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV The process of mixing produced a class of unique fonts characterized by significant proportions of letters in two or more typefaces across both cases. The simplest form occurred within a shop when the printer mixed together the cases containing two fonts to produce a third. The rationale behind this kind of mixing is obscure; however, the fact that at least a few sorts in mixed fonts contain only letters of one face suggests a cost-efficient approach to salvaging the investment in the original font which, inevitably, would have been replenished in many sorts during previous use. By melting down only the scrapheap of discarded types and perhaps the severely depleted sorts toward a new font, a possibly significant cost-savings on the metal required for the new font could be realized, the investment in the salvaged sorts would continue to produce, and the addition of the new font would eliminate the need to replenish in the near future. A reluctance on the part of some printers to acquire new fonts is suggested by what we know in this respect. One extant record of font management reveals what seems to be an enormous amount of discarded type (40%) on the scrapheap awaiting melt-down. 29 Given the amount of type needed to initially fill two sets of cases, it would be possible to make-do with a quite depleted font by setting from both sets of cases at once rather than alternating from them or by transferring all type into a single set of cases. 30 However, this cost-savings rationale is purely speculative, and there seems to be no consistency among printers. Thomas Creede progressed through four fonts in 16 years (1593-1609); significantly, mixed font Creede-3 endured for half this period (1595-1603), suggesting perhaps that mixing enhanced the longevity of the font. Creede-4 served from 1603-1609, slightly less. Eld-Y1 was replaced by Eld-S after about 2½ years, and Eld-S by Eld-Y2 in less than two years. 31 Then again, Simmes-S was in use from the beginning of Simmes' career in 1595 to about 1606, 32 a remarkable but unfortunate fact since it should have been scrapped long before. The in-shop kind of mixing is illustrated by the creation of Creede-3 by the mixing of Creede-1 and new Creede-2. The significance of W. Craig Ferguson's discovery of the initial mixing process as it progressed in a single book cannot be overstated, 33 for it provides crucial evidence of the independent existence of the hybrid set of matrices that produced Creede-2. Creede-1 is an S-font with normal variant letters throughout, including the squat k1, left-leaning g1, left-dot i2, expanded x2,3, and the miscast ſh3 and fl1,2, and erect fl3, ligatures. However, Creede-2 is in itself a mixed font, and therein lies another tale. Overall, S-face capitals, ligatures, and the majority of lowercase letters form the base of Creede-2, but stylistically uniform, slightly smaller letters fill the remaining sorts: a 'b' with a right-angle bowl junction at the x-line, a shorter oval 'd' and medium oval 'p'; erect S-face g2; center-dot i1, two variants (medium and wide) of 'k' characterised by the nearly vertical arm (74 deg.) and high junction (0.85mm) on the ascender, w3 with bowed outer stems, high-riding "tiny" y2, the EF-face high-junction 'ſh' with right-leaning ascender, and a very few smaller 'ſt'. Once mixed, Creede-3 exhibits both S-face and alternate-face letters in these sorts; later replenishment with wrong-sized, bold letters and miscastings complicated the relatively simple two-face composition of Creede-3, thereby obscuring its origin in two sets of matrices: a uniform S-face set (Creede-1), and a hybrid set with S-face matrices and the Creede-2 alternate-face subset (Creede-2). Depletion of some sorts in Creede-1 seems the probable cause of the mixing; for example, the Creede-1 k1 accounts for only about 15% of the sort in Creede-3. A second example of direct evidence of a hybrid set of matrices occurs in Nicholas Okes's mixed font purchased June, 1607 (noted earlier). Original Guyot capitals ( Low Countries , Fig. 203, p. 268) accompany S-face ligatures including the common miscastings (excepting? the 'ffi' and 'ſſi') and the S-face lower-case letters, including both the left-leaning g1 and the erect g2 as well as other variants. Similarly, Adam Islip's mixed font ( Every Man out of his Humour STC14767, 1600) uses Guyot capitals exclusively, while the lower-case combines S-face letters with most of the EF-face subset of letters and ligatures. Similar mixtures are seen in other fonts. These three examples provide insight into one kind of mixing that in all probability occurred at the type foundries which supplied mixed versions of these fonts to Creede, Okes, Islip, Allde, Stafford and other printers. For whatever reason, the founder(s) combined partial sets of matrices from two sets of seminal punches (S-face and alternate-face) to produce Creede-2. Significantly, the S-face erect g2 is integral to Creede-2. The slightly smaller bowl and vertical counter of this variant absolutely indicate a duplicate punch rather than a misaligned or a misjustified strike from the normal S-face left-leaning g1 punch. The presence of both variants in clean S-fonts is further evidence of duplicate punches in the seminal set. 34 Once Creede-2 and Creede-3 are compared with other mixed fonts, the most intriguing aspect of font history emerges: how and where in the type production and distribution processes particular combinations of dissimilar-face letters became mixed in groups, creating mixed fonts with extraordinary similarities and yet striking differences in composition. The differences probably can be explained by analogy with Creede-3 where replenishment after mixing contributed variants found in neither Creede-1 nor Creede-2. Other mixed fonts appear in the advanced state of Creede-3 so that replenishment has somewhat obscured the composition of the original mixed font as purchased or of the two fonts that were mixed. As a result, the distinction between mixing and replenishment can sometimes be resolved only with reservation, since piecemeal replenishment can plausibly produce what appears to be a mixed font. That possibility is hinted at in Danter-M, which apparently was replenished at one time with a large subset of crudely cut, poorly shaped B-face letters (a b c e h m n o p r t u) that leap from the page because of their sheer bulk. 35 Danter obviously was not overly concerned about the appearance of his work. The minor proportions of this subset clearly indicate replenishment which, if repeated several times, could tip the balance in favor of mixing given the quite large number of affected sorts. However, even if that occurred, replenishment could be inferred from the general principle that a genuine mixed font contains letters from just one typeface in some sorts, assuming that replenishment has not occurred, as in the subset of Creede-2. Although the B-face subset in Danter-M is quite extensive, it duplicates pairs of letters in the sorts that represent the pre-replenishment state of the font. On the other hand, White-M contains duplicate S- and Y-face letters in all sorts, a strong indication of in-shop mixing. Similarly, the Y-face subset in Read-S is limited to a half-dozen sorts, all containing S-face letters as well, an obvious indication of replenishment. The fact that mixed fonts are composed of the S-face and at least three other typefaces underscores the difficulty of sorting them out relative to their sources in identifiable seminal sets of punches. Except for a few instances of replacement or duplicate punches, it seems clear that the composition of seminal sets of punches endured unmodified. Hence, the stability of certain combinations of alternate-face letters suggests an ongoing process at various foundries of mixing strikes or matrices from several sets of punches. Strictly speaking, "typeface" denotes a stylistically uniform set of seminal punches and thus must be re-defined to include such stable combinations of letters as seen in Creede-2, Stafford-EF or Windet-F, where the "C2-face", "EF-face" or "F-face" label denotes a hybrid set of matrices that supplied two or more printers with a particular combination of stylistically heterogeneous letters from alternate typefaces. Ultimately, it may be impossible to relate a particular subset of alternate-face letters to a distinct set of punches and define the seminal "typeface" in a traditional sense. One problem is the difficulty of locating a specimen in which the subset appears along with the remaining letters from the seminal set of punches. A composite, as a whole, defines not only the stylistic traits of individual letters, but also the combination of letters which comprise the typeface; the design of a particular letter is clarified by juxtaposition with other letters (i.e., the cross-strokes of the 'e f t' provide reference points for judging the height of shoulder-ascender junctions). The certainty that a given letter belongs to a typeface grows in proportion to the number of letters in which the design and reference points coincide. The work of sorting out mixed fonts lies in the future and should shed valuable light on the production and distribution network that supplied type to Elizabethan printers. Nonetheless, the varying compositions of mixed fonts provide a plethora of discriminants for distinguishing them in books of the period.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V The process of font analysis aims at detecting discriminants which differentiate two or more fonts. Since White-M and Stafford-EF combine extensive S-face bases with an alternate-face (Y-face, EF-face subset), they contain far more discriminants than typical same-face fonts, a situation which, in combination with their worn condition and the poor printing quality in Fools , makes them ideal for illustrating the problems encountered in the typical search process which employs reproductions for the initial stage of comparative analysis. Font analysis, as a method, benefits from a comparison of perceived stylistic variants in a font with similar variants in other fonts in order to establish that they are genuine and historically demonstrable rather than transient effects of wear, damage, inking and printing. Ideally, variants could be verified by reference to an extant founder's specimen of a typeface so that any transformations in composition could be easily detected. 36 In practice, the appearance of a typeface in other books usually is the only kind of specimen available for comparative analysis, although these can reflect a different state of the typeface occasioned by practical circumstances. 37 Although neither White-M nor Stafford-EF correspond to any extant specimen, a preliminary examination of the two fonts in Fools CD, I, and EF reveals capitals, lowercase letters, and ligatures that obviously combine an S-font with smaller alternate-faces quite similar to the Y-face, suggesting that specimens of the two faces in other books (or other sections of the book) be used as a reference point during analysis. Similarly, Guyot-style letters ('G', short second-stem 'w', 'g k p q z fi') call for reference to the Guyot pica specimen in Low Countries (Fig. 203, p. 268) or books by Henry Bynneman or George Bishop. Previous study of fonts in other books can also suggest reference specimens; in this instance, similar fonts had been noted in Whore EF (Simmes as primary printer, others unidentified), Monsieur d'Olive EF (Creede, sharing unnoted), The Seven Deadly Sins (STC6522, 1606, Edward Allde), Every Man in his Humour (STC 14766, 1601, Simon Stafford) and Lymbo-Mastix (STC19295, 1607, George Eld). The analytical process progresses through three stages that vary in scope and precision: (1) an initial seriatim survey of the book for discriminants consisting of obvious wrong-face and stylistically variant letters and punctuation; (2) a more complete and precise survey of each possible section of a book aimed at detecting subtle stylistic variants and devising font composite(s); and (3) a comparison of variants in the two fonts to isolate both stylistic and quantitative discriminants. The analysis must proceed in an orderly fashion from gathering to gathering, first focusing upon the capitals, then ligatures, punctuation and lower-case groups. The seriatim order is essential because the divisions of labor in shared books follow no logical pattern; moreover, time pressure is a practical factor that invites such haste and must be resisted in font analysis. 38 The assumption that a shared book was printed in halves is valid in The Fawne Q1-2; however, Windet-S and Windet-F alternate in an anomalous pattern within his section (E-I). Likewise, the "two gatherings per printer" assumption is frequently valid in shared books. However, if either assumption led to a hasty survey of Pericles (STC22335, 1609, White and Creede), for example, by jumping from A to C, the presence of Creede-5 in B could be overlooked. Similarly, Fools was divided in an illogical order, with Eld doing AB, GH, K, printer #2 doing CD and then I between Eld's H and K, and printer #3 doing EF. d'Olive is an even more devious case. The shift from Creede-4 on A4v to a Y-font on B1 is obvious and presents a temptation to skip to B4v and C1, where an obvious shift from the Y-font to a mixed S-font occurs; however, yielding to the temptation would occasion the oversight that inner-B is also printed in an S-font (Creede-4 again) and then the B-outer Y-font reappears in G-H3v. Admittedly, this instance of one printer perfecting a sheet begun in another shop is almost unique but emphasizes the fact that books were printed forme by forme. As an illustration of the process, the results of the first and third stages of analysis of Fools are summarized here. While the possibility of distinct fonts in CD, I, and EF is hinted at in the first stage, the evidence that emerges at this stage usually is too general and includes potential discriminants that eventually are discarded as insignificant in the final stage of comparative analysis. In general, it can be assumed that replenishment introduces quantities of wrong-face letters that can be detected in the initial survey, while low-density foul-case letters will usually be overlooked. First Stage Capitals . Uniform Y-face capitals appear in Eld's section (AB, GH, K) except for a few foul-case S-face capitals. The presence of both S-face and alternate-face capitals in C-F, I, approximates the pattern of extensive replenishment in Purfoot-Y, and at first glance suggests a single font. The single major discriminant occurs in the oversized (height: 2.9mm, 96mm letter), awkward, right-leaning 'W' in EF, but its cogency is undercut by four appearances (F1:16, F4:12,32, F4v:20) of the normal 'W' found in CD, I, which raises the possibility of two sets of cross-contaminated cases rather than two independent fonts. Similarly, the few alternate-face symmetrical 'M' cut across the possible CD, I, and EF boundaries (C3v:18, E1v:19, E4:21, E4v:14, I2:32). However, two anomalies are limited to CD, I: three appearances of a Guyot 'G' (C2v:14, D2v:21, I3:18) and the 76mm 'Y' in D and I (D2:34, D4v:15,16,17, I1:21, I2v:25, I3v:2), which could be interpreted as transient fouling (see later discussion) of one of two cases. Alternate-face letters 'E K R V Z' are lacking in CD, I, and 'O S V Z' do not appear in EF, but these omissions must be viewed cautiously as supplemental evidence, since non-appearance does not prove non-existence. Both S-face and alternate 'I T' occur in roughly equal proportions throughout. In general, the evidence of capitals clearly indicates a distinction between AB, GH, K, and C-F, I, but is ambiguous regarding a further split in the latter section. The fact that two different styles of alternate-face capitals appear in CD, I, and EF cannot be determined from a reproduction. Punctuation . Fouling with italic query and black letter colon, query and period can be dismissed as insignificant, since these occur throughout the text; similarly, S-face query occurs throughout C-F, I. Eld's section uses the Y-face query consistently. An obvious discriminant occurs in the exclusive appearances of Y-face query in CD, I, and the large Guyot query in EF. Ligatures . Uniform Y-face ligatures occur in Eld's section. The evidence is ambiguous in C-F, I, since S-face and alternate-face variants occur in the ligatures. The S-face ligatures are obvious, but given the printing quality of Fools , it is improbable that the double variants (excluding S-face) in several ligatures would be detected at this stage, since examination in an original is necessary. Lower-case . Again, Eld's section uniformly uses Y-face letters fouled by about a dozen S-face letters. The evidence is ambiguous with respect to further subdividing C-F, I, since most obvious variants seem to appear throughout. Except for some S-face g1 (CD, I) and g2 (EF), differentiating other variants requires examination in an original, including the bold variants of 'b d f h', condensed and wider variants of 'k p u v x y', the oversized 't,' the squarish w4 and the bowed outer-stems w3, the Y-face (CD, I) and Guyot (EF) 'g', and S-face k1 (CD, I) and poorly-printing or damaged EF-face k1-k2 (EF). Overall, the lower-case evidence as seen in a reproduction could easily suggest a single font in C-F, I. Second and Third Stages The first stage of analysis, in short, clearly indicates a distinct Y-font in Eld's section, but yields ambiguous evidence as to whether one or two fonts appear in C-F, I. The few major differences seen in CD, I, and EF suggest that the second stage of analysis proceed with an awareness of a possible division at the D4v-E1 boundary. The comparison at high magnification of numerous samples of each letter within the sequence of gatherings focuses upon stylistic structure and minute variations in size in order to complete the font composites and isolate variants. In this instance, the analysis of E1 yields new variants not seen in CD, suggesting that a second font composite be devised. The division of labor in Fools , with I separated from CD by EF, automatically requires moving to the third stage of analysis which consists of a comparison of the font in I with the refined evidence accumulated in the two composites. In other cases, the font composite from a section of one book usually is compared with a font in another book. The third stage of analysis of Fools focuses on the lower-case and ligatures. A summary of the results is given in the Appendix. Overall, the comparative analysis of CD, I, and EF confirmes their separate identity and the assignment of their respective sections to two sharing printers. In addition to distinguishing the divisions of labor in Fools , the analytical process produces font composites of CD, I, and EF which are the basis for a search of other books aimed at establishing the identities of the two printers. Once a similar font is located in another book, a font composite is used to determine whether the fonts are identical in the same manner that the CD and EF composites identify the font in I of Fools . 39 In this instance, the font in EF of Whore and The Converted Courtesan (STC6501, 6501a, 1604) exhibits obvious similarities to EF, including the awkward 'W', large Guyot '?' and other discriminants. Analysis of the two fonts shows a precise stylistic correspondence in all particulars as well as some shifts in proportions attributable to time. Some discriminants appear in greater proportions such as the condensed 'fi' and 'ſſ' ligatures in Whore . The only major difference occurs in the appearance of eleven transient foul-case italic ' I ' in Whore E3v that were purged before Fools . While the same font is in both books, the unfortunate fact remains at this point (as often happens) that the font appears in shared sections of Whore, Courtesan and Fools by one unidentified printer. Nonetheless, the identification of Fools EF in Whore EF and Eld-Y1 in G-K along with previously identified Simmes-S in AB of Whore establishes the division of labor among the sharing printers and clarifies previous problems about the printing of the two editions, leaving only the identity of the printers unresolved. 40 The search process for unidentified printers is unpredictable, but once suitable candidates are located, the font composite usually easily decides the matter. Whore CD prints in an S-font characterized by low-riding capitals in many sorts and a resident cluster of foul-case italic capitals, traits which identify it as Creede-4 (see below). Similarly, the exclusive discriminants of EF link it to Simon Stafford. A comparison of Fools CD, I, to EF of d'Olive yields positive verification of the identity of this font, but again it belongs to an unidentified printer. The proportions of S-face g1 and Y-face 'g' remain the same, although the S-face k1 seems to decrease slightly; the variants in the ligatures are the same; and anomalous letters reappear such as the few Guyot 'G' and short second-stem 'w', the condensed 'ff' (F1v:34), and the Y-face 'ct' ( Fools , D1v:23, D3:11; d'Olive , E1v:5). Identification of a few damaged types completes the process. Since the font composite successfully distinguished Fools CD, I, from EF and identified d'Olive EF, the eventual identification of the printer is a virtual certainty, given a dogged persistence and a good dose of luck. In this instance, White-M's seven years of replenishment and deterioration between LLL and Fools , compounded by the poor printing quality of Fools , buried some critical evidence in the blotted images of the reproductions which were laboriously (6 weeks) examined before consulting originals. The unique 'th' ligature of White-M appeared clearly enough in the reproductions of LLL ; the equally unique 'ch' ligature, however, was totally overlooked; neither were hinted at in Fools and d'Olive . Once originals were consulted, the 'th' was easily confirmed, the 'ch' discovered ( LLL , A2:10, A2v:38, A4v:3, B1v:24), and then the remnant 'th' recognised in Fools (C2:4 "either", 7 "mirth") and d'Olive (E1:14,15); the few 'ch' of LLL seem to have been exhausted during the intervening years. Finally, the reproductions were inadequate for confirming that the alternate-face in White-M actually is a Y-face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI Relatively few same-face fonts exhibit the plethora of discriminants seen in mixed fonts such as White-M and Stafford-EF. Generally, font analysis must resort to the kind of tedious search that is necessary for detecting low-frequency foul-case letters. Foul-case pica roman letters constitute a category of discriminants between same-face fonts and are, quite simply, distinguished from the normal letters by the wrong-face and size differentiae discussed earlier. It can be generally assumed that the source of such letters is another pica roman font previously or currently used in the shop; hence, fouling of an S-font by Y-face letters usually implies the possibility of a two-font shop, although this inference must be verified by a survey of books by the printer. However, anomalies occur where the source of a foul-case pica roman letter cannot be explained in this manner; for example, Simmes-S contains a very few Y-face letters although he never used a Y-font. These include Y-face 'k' ( Mal Q1, F4v:30; Q2, F1v:33), 'M' (Q2, G3:24; Q3, C1:29, G4:26) and 'P' (Q3, G4:11); further appearances, if any, have been overlooked. 41 Similarly, Felix Kingston's Y-font contains a few Guyot 'G' ( The Works STC12312 [1599], C3v:34, C4:1, C5v:11, D2:17 etc.), and White-M uses the unique 'th' and 'ch' ligatures. The value of these letters as discriminants depends upon their rarity (either in a quantitative or stylistic sense) or longevity in the context of other same-face fonts. Windet-S is fouled with the short second-stem 'w' and B-face 'a', both fairly rare variants which also appear in White-M and Danter-M but not as a result of fouling. Both Eld-S and Windet-S show a few wrong-face medium 'z' which do not correspond in either instance to a second font in their shops and do not appear in the other S-fonts discussed here. Letters from the small capitals and shorter roman fonts (68mm, 76mm) constitute another common class of foul-case roman letters. In addition, the damaged 'ſſ' ligature distributed into the 'ſl' ligature sort and foul-case punctuation provide two kinds of valuable discriminants. It seems that compositors were little concerned with stylistic integrity in the latter area, and promiscuously set punctuation from wrong-size roman, italic and black letter sorts when shortages developed in the roman text-font. Hence, quite a few combinations resulted from mixtures of: S- and Y-face roman, black letter, and short and tall italic variants of the query and exclamation point; large Guyot query; S- and Y-face, black letter and italic (two degrees of lean) colon and semicolon; black letter period; and three useful sizes of comma. As a general rule, it seems logical to assume that foul-case italic and black letter punctuation marks are by definition a result of fouling rather than replenishment. The complementary italic font in a shop was a major contributor of foul-case letters in the strict sense (i.e., an italic letter set in a roman text), but as a practical matter, the concept should be extended to include the use of italic for emphasis in italicised titles and names, speech prefixes and stage directions. 42 Both kinds of appearances of italic letters serve the same identification function in font analysis. Generally, foul-case italic letters serve as simple wrong-face discriminants. However, italic typefaces also exhibit some major stylistic variations that can contribute complex discriminants, that is, stylistically variant (Guyot vs Granjon), wrong-face (italic) letters. An analysis of a printer's complementary pica italic font is necessary to identify such complex discriminants for use in a composite. It seems that many printers replenished the upper-case and ligatures of their italic fonts without regard for stylistic integrity and the process produced a rich lore of potential discriminants. These italic stylistic variants are usually easily detected in the upper-case and ligatures for the same reasons noted in regard to pica roman fonts. Simmes's italic font uses capitals in two typefaces and two sizes. For example, his italic ' C ' appears both in a normal-height version positioned on the baseline, and a tall version that equals the height of the typeface (i.e., extends from top of ascenders to bottom of descenders), and the italic ' S ' and other capitals come in normal and small sizes. 43 Since the italic was used primarily as an emphasis font, it is frequently necessary to survey several books by a printer in order to accumulate a sample of italic letters sufficient for determining whether or not he used a particular stylistic variant. Given a typical dramatic text with the italic font used only for emphasis and speech prefixes, it is unreasonable to reach such a conclusion exclusively from the letters in a single text. 44 For example, between Q2 and Q3 of The Malcontent , Eld purged the italic ' M ' with the swash terminating in a curl and replenished the sort with a simple swash ' M ', and also purged the italic ' w ' with the stem-strokes extending above the x-line and replenished with the variant whose stems begin at the x-line. 45 Unless books before and after Q3 were surveyed, it would seem that Eld's italic appears either in Q1-2 or in Q3, with another printer represented by the variant italic ' M ' and ' w '. In some fortunate instances, the extent of the survey required for examining an adequate sample is lessened by the appearance of long italic passages in dedications, prologues and epilogues (see Sejanus , ¶3-A1v:6; All Fools , A3-A3v:14; Romish Spider , A3-A4v), in the peculiar reversal of text and emphasis fonts in Romeo &amp; Juliet Q2 (B4-4v) and Volpone STC14783 [1607], and in rare instances, in an entire text ( Vertumnus STC12555 [1607], [2]B-H). As the Eld example implies, a composite of italic letters based upon an extensive survey of a printer's books can be valuable for dating a particular book. As noted earlier, the distinction between fouling and replenishment is quantitative, with the former implying a second font in a shop. The distinction is also important as regards the function of foul-case evidence in font identification, and beyond that, in the analysis of compositors, method of setting and distribution, standing type and sequence of printing, since the two processes have a different effect upon the manner in which variant letters reappear. A wrong-face population created by replenishment in significant proportions remains stable throughout the lifetime of the font, since it results from a deliberate choice to introduce wrong-face letters, and unless the standards about font integrity were reversed, the letters would not be purged. The average ratio of normal and wrong-face letters remains stable across a sequence of gatherings and texts; both variants of a letter will reappear consistently, although the ratios on a given page, pages or gatherings may vary because of the varying demands on a sort by a text; or the ratios may vary in a sequence of texts because of a shift in proportions produced by subsequent replenishment. In general, replenishment does not produce the kind of evidence needed in applications other than font discrimination unless, of course, just one of two cases were replenished with a variant letter. Low-level replenishment represents a special case that will be discussed below. In contrast, the very low density of foul-case letters precludes any consistency in their appearance, although in practice they usually do reappear across a sequence of gatherings or texts. However, their recurrence is both random and unpredictable in the context of predefined units such as the page, gathering, or even two texts. The patterns of recurrence will emerge in the following discussion. In general, a few foul-case letters in a sort will recur with no more regularity than identified types, which often skip gatherings and texts between appearances. But a fundamental difference between foul-case types and identified types must be recognized. The non-specific nature of foul-case evidence is a problem in itself in as much as the very concept of "evidence" is inseparable from the notion of specifically identifiable facts. Ideally, reappearing foul-case letters could be identified and their recurrence thus proven, and this is possible in some instances. For example, Braddock-Y1 is fouled with S-face 'A' (among other letters) that occurs 28 times (an average of three per gathering) in MND Q1. S-face type A1 accounts for six of these appearances (B4v:2, C2:21, D3v:4, F1:22, G4v:26, H1v:13). Three damaged 'ſſ' in the 'ſl' sort recur as well: types ſſ7 (B3:18, C3:11), ſſ8 (D4v:16, F2v:4), and ſſ9 (D4v:6, E1:18, H3:20). Damaged type ſſ2 recurs at least twice in the 'ſl' sort in Short-Y in R3 (L4:4, M3:27). Nonetheless, the use of foul-case evidence is complicated by the fact that most foul-case types are unidentifiable due to the lack of unique damage, and hence must be treated as representatives of a class of letter, that is, as members of a sort (i.e., "three appearances of S-face 'A'" as opposed to "type A1 appears in three locations"). However, the obstacles presented by the nature of foul-case evidence can be circumvented by a method of analysis based upon two concepts that render foul-case types valuable despite their non-specific identities both in font identification and more specific applications related to compositorial and presswork analysis. First, the critical distinction between transient and resident fouling must be recognized in dealing with this kind of evidence. Transient fouling, which endures for a few gatherings but not beyond a text, is of little value in font identification, but can be useful in presswork analysis, since it signifies compositorial behavior in response to conditions such as shortages in a sort. Consequently, short-term transient fouling can provide strong circumstantial evidence of the sequence of printing. The fact that only A-C of MND Q1 are fouled with black letter colons suggests that the book was printed sequentially beginning with A, and not B-H then A, as has been suggested. 46 In contrast, resident fouling endures across several texts (and frequently throughout the lifetime of a font) and is of primary importance in font identification and presswork analysis. Due to the random recurrence patterns exhibited by foul-case letters, it is necessary to establish whether fouling is transient or resident before applying foul-case evidence to bibliographical analysis. Otherwise, fundamental errors in interpretation can result. Treating the recurrences of small capitals 'I' and 'A' throughout MND Q1 as repeated responses to newly developed shortages in these sorts (transient fouling) totally distorts the picture of presswork that emerges, if, in fact, these foul-case letters are resident in the font, i.e., already in the respective sort compartments before setting began. Verification of resident fouling requires surveying the font through the target text, and then other approximately contemporary texts. "Contemporary" need not be interpreted too strictly: resident fouling endures in Eld-Y1, Eld-S, Creede-4, Windet-S, Purfoot-Y, Short-Y and other fonts during a significant portion of their lifetimes. The necessity of surveying several books in distinguishing resident from transient fouling is illustrated by the dramatic drop in foul-case 68mm roman 'Y' in Short's section (H-M3v) of R3 Q1 (1597). Eight appearances occur in H, but only one in I-L and two in M, although textual pressure on the 'Y' sort shows no similar decrease, a pattern that suggests transient fouling. However, the 68mm 'Y' fouling is resident in Short-Y at least from 1595-99 ( 3 Henry VI STC21006 [1595]; i Henry IV Q1 STC22280 [1598]; and The English Secretary STC6404 [1599]). Second, an understanding of the manner in which fouling occurs is essential to the interpretation of foul-case evidence. The non-identity of recurrent foul-case letters is compensated for by the fact that resident fouling of a font almost inevitably occurs in two or more sorts and thus produces a cluster of fouled sorts that reappears in sequences of gatherings or texts. Treating a font's foul-case letters as a "cluster" is simply an application of the statistical concept of a randomly selected sample population that is to be measured against a predefined distribution of variables in order to determine the probabilities that the sample conforms. In this instance, the variables consist of the cluster of foul-case letters in the populations of the affected sorts as a whole. A comparison of the total populations of affected sorts in two fonts reveals the order of statistical probability that the fonts are the same or not. Since resident fouling usually exhibits a fairly consistent cluster of affected sorts, it is possible to rely upon a quantification consisting of the density of the members of the cluster in a sample population whose limits are set in response to criteria suggested by the text or texts under examination. The quantification need not be overly rigorous when attempting to distinguish two same-face fonts. Each font can be treated as a whole without respect to the distinction between two sets of cases. Hence, a definition of a cluster in units of member density per gathering is entirely adequate; in practice, the cluster compositions alone will frequently distinguish two same-face fonts without reference to member density. Hence, a simple application of this approach sans statistical analysis can show that the cluster remained consistently fouled through the sample texts, thereby providing strong circumstantial evidence of the identity of a font. The random recurrence patterns exhibited by low-density fouling are determined by the dynamic relationships among at least four factors: the continuous process of fouling and purging as affected (1) by the ease of purging and (2) by compositorial skills and intention; (3) the variation in the demand upon fouled sorts by sections of a text or by different texts; and (4) the distribution of foul-case letters deeper into sort compartments or into a different case, thereby delaying later reappearances. 47 Although the first two factors seem too obvious to belabor, the standard method of interpreting foul-case evidence in compositorial analysis suggests the need for a closer examination of the interaction of the two as they affect the permanence of fouling in a font. First, the ease with which fouling types could be detected during distribution seems important. The fact that compositors distributed on the basis of a visual recognition of each type seems well established since Charlton Hinman first made the point, and is confirmed by the pervasiveness of one kind of fouling in roman pica fonts. The damaged 'ſſ' ligature which lacked the right shoulder approximated the appearance of the 'ſl' ligature and was commonly distributed into that sort. These damaged ligatures are obvious in proof because the right letter retains the spur which distinguishes it from a straight-edge 'l', but the spur would be virtually invisible during distribution. Due to the damage, it is possible to establish many of these foul-case ligatures as separate types, such as three in Windet-S ( Sophonisba , B2:34, D2:1, F4:37) and others as recurrent types, as in Windet-S ( Fawne Q1, E1:29, I2v:19), Eld-Y1 ( Fools , A4v:14, H4v:2), Braddock-Y1 and Short-Y (noted above). Eld-Y1 presents an interesting instance (unless my eyes deceive me) of visual confusion during distribution: ſſ4 first appears in the 'ſl' sort ( Mal Q1, C2:33, E3v:7) and then the 'ſt' sort ( Mal Q3, H3:20). On the other hand, foul-case italic capitals, for example, would be obvious on the stone and easily purged, but their permanence varies among fonts. Four appearances of italic ' S ' occur in Simmes's section of The Malcontent Q1 (F2v:23, F3: 10,24, H4v:1), but none in the same sections of text in Q2, nor in Simmes's section of Q3 (B-G). Obviously, textual demands on the ' S ' sort were exactly the same in Q1, Q2, and F of Q3; hence the non-reappearance of italic ' S ' fouling suggests routine purging of the sort at the natural break-point between editions. Similarly, the five variants of the query (S-face, Y-face, italic, black letter, large Guyot), the S-face and italic exclamation point, and the black letter colon and period could probably be recognised during distribution and purged, but on the whole they seem to remain resident once introduced into most fonts. But unless a compositor distributed against proofs, which seems extremely unlikely, the clash presented by oversized capitals such as the S-face 'G S E' in a Y-font (usually quite noticeable in proof) and by less obvious smaller capitals such as Y-face 'G S' in an S-font (fairly difficult to detect in proof) would go unnoticed during distribution and remain resident in a font. Thus the smaller Y-face 'S A T' which recur in Eld-S in sequential gatherings of Sejanus also are found in later texts, even when a prose text, such as The Romish Spider (STC5704, new STC5693.7 [1606]), requires relatively few capitals per gathering. 48 Windet-F 'A D G H M O T' fouling in Windet-S is seen in Fawne Q2 and Sophonisba . As noted of Eld-Y1 below, even the larger S-face letters seem to remain in Y-fonts. Small capitals presumably could be purged if a compositor desired, but small 'Y' fouling is resident in Short-Y from 1595-1599; the residence of small capital 'T' in Danter-M is probably attributable to a lack of concern about fouling in this mixed font. Finally, the stylistic clash created by wrong-face lower-case roman letters could hardly be detected without proofs whether or not a compositor was intent upon sorting them out. Thus the Y-face 'g k p' in Sejanus still reside in Eld-S in Spider despite seven(?) intervening texts which provided ample opportunity for purging. 49 Likewise, the Windet-F 'g w' reside in Windet-S at least from 1604-06. The S-face expanded x2 (and x3) seems the only likely lower-case letter that could be distinguished without proofs; nonetheless, it remains in Eld-Y1 after its introduction in Mal Q3. Not surprisingly, the compositor is the second factor responsible for the difference between resident and transient fouling. Compositors seem to vary considerably in their purging skills and attitudes. Although the intention and skill of a compositor cannot be taken as the sole factor influencing the permanence of fouling in a font, the contrasting treatment of transient vs resident fouling reveals the importance of compositorial intention. 50 That is implicit in the frequent instances where foul-case letters in previously fouled sorts are tolerated while new foul-case letters are purged. It seems that the newly fouled area of text or the kind of newly introduced foul-case letters are fresh in mind and a deliberate decision made to purge. Heavy textual pressure on the query sort in R3 K4 produced fouling with the black letter query, followed by a complete purging. The previous pages of K required six italic, four Y-face and one black letter queries, but in K4 the one italic and four Y-face queries were supplemented with 13 black letter queries. However, the ratio of black letter to Y-face and italic queries remains in LM at the previous levels, suggesting that the K4 foul-case marks were immediately purged, but the resident black letter queries earlier in the gathering left undisturbed. Since this compositor could purge 13 marks from K4, he obviously could recognize and purge the remaining black letter queries if he intended to. Furthermore, the density of black letter query fouling in Short-Y changes radically across three texts, confirming the purging ability of Short's compositors. In 3H6 (1595), black letter query appears in proportions similar to that seen in 1H4 (1598) and English Secretary (1599). 51 The persistence of resident fouling with italic capitals in many fonts suggests a decision to tolerate certain foul-case letters while purging others. Italic ' T ' fouling in Short-Y varies in a manner similar to the black letter query, appearing at moderate density in 3H6 (1-5 per 8 pages or gathering) and H of R3 . One compositor then fouled his halves of I(16 ' T '), K(11) and L(10) extensively with italic ' T '. Both cases were incompletely purged, so that no foul-case ' T ' appears in 1H4 until I3v(1), K2v(2) and K3(1), and once in Secretary (1599) (Ll4v:29). Sort-pressure is an unlikely explanation for these appearances. 52 The types were probably buried in the sort compartment when the ' T ' was purged as part of the replenishment of the sort after R3 with S-face ' T ' in about equal proportions, a factor that probably accounts for the much-delayed recurrence. 53 But the italic ' S ' in R3 (L1:21, L2:4) does not seem to reappear. In the meantime, other foul-case italic capitals are tolerated through the four texts. Fairly heavy italic ' I ' fouling occurs in all four. Other low-density italic capitals ' E F K P ' recur sporadically, skipping gatherings and texts in the typical manner. Next, the italic ' B C L S ' remain in Purfoot-Y1 after Dutch Courtesan STC17475 and Romish Spider to reappear in Fawne while the low-density ' swash-B F G swash-P V ' do not; the transient heavy fouling in DC A-E with ' I ' (76) and ' T ' (27) was purged after DC. 54 One Windet-S case (Windet-S1, see below) is fouled with ' S ' in both Fawne Q2 (H4v:6) and Sophonisba (Bv1:24, C2:29,38, D4:37, E4v:31,33, F1v:6,25), but the italic ' A B I L T ' cluster in Windet-S2 does not recur in the latter. The difference probably is attributable to the attitudes of the S1 and S2 compositors. However, the difficulty of purging even obvious foul-case letters despite the compositor's intention is revealed in instances where these letters are eventually purged, but not entirely until two or more distributions. Fouling of MND Q1 with black letter colon begins with one in A2, then B is heavily fouled with 20, most of which were immediately purged, leaving two in C1 to be purged at the next distribution; only the roman and italic colon occur in the remainder of the text. The large number of other foul-case letters in Braddock-Y1 were simultaneously ignored. Likewise, Simmes-S was fouled with italic ' I ' in A of Mal Q3 which were eventually purged by the distribution of F (A3-4v: 12, B: 5, C: 5, D: 4, E: 4, F: 3, G: 0). Compositorial intention to purge local large-scale fouling is evident in both instances. The kind of oversight implicit in the sequence of distributions of Simmes-S suggests the probable manner in which low-density obvious foul-case letters became resident in a font. It seems likely that fouling of portions of a text by one of two alternating compositors of different competence would increase the possibility of foul-case italic letters remaining in a font, especially if the second compositor distributed the fouled sections without being alerted to the need for purging them. The varying dynamics of the continuous process of fouling-purging due to differing textual demands upon vulnerable sorts, ease of purging, and compositorial intention are exemplified in Creede-4, where heavy italic fouling with ' I ' and moderate fouling with ' S T ' were tolerated as resident while other italic letters were routinely introduced and then incompletely purged. In an early book, the text was fouled extensively with italic ' A swash-A ' (26) and ' Guyot A ' (1) in Creede's section of Antichrist STC7120 (1603, [2]H-M, see [2]H2v,3,4v,6v,8,8v), and was then purged, since it does not reappear in later gatherings or books. The resident cluster begins to develop in I (two C ), then in K with ' G ' (23), ' swash-G ' (2), ' I ' (23), and ' P ' (2); the ' I ' remains in L (9), ' swash-P ' emerges (1) and ' P ' (6) increases; only the ' P ' reappears in M (10). Compositorial intention explains the localization of fouling, since sort-pressure remains constant ("God", "Priest") throughout. By Honest Whore CD (1604), the cluster is in the font. High-frequency ' I ' appears 46 times in C alone, while ' S T ' occur at moderate levels in C(9, 5) and D(7, 7). The cluster is completed by low-density italic ' C F G swash-G P W ' and Y-face 'M' that recur in the typical manner. The 68mm roman 'C' (C4:8[2], D1:5,11) and 'I' (C4:16) do not seem to reappear as part of the cluster, although this may be an oversight. Textual demands in high-frequency words such as "Bishop", "Church", "Doctor", "Epistle" and "God" in Woeful Cry of Rome STC1833 (1605) pulled italic ' B swash-B E ' and two Y-face 'D' (B3:34,35) into the text and markedly increased the frequency of appearance of resident low-density cluster members (excepting italic ' W ' and Y-face 'M') through additional fouling. An attempt to purge at some time following Woeful Cry is implied by the state of the font in Regiment of the Church STC1827 (1606). Regiment begins with italic ' I ' fouling to B4 where the first four italic ' F ' ("Father") intrude; only nine 'S' have been set, all roman. Additional fouling that persists throughout Creede's section of the book obtains by D with the full cluster, except that the italic ' swash-B swash-G E ' and Y-face 'D' do not appear by this point. It is possible that only one case was completely purged after Woeful Cry and used to set most of Regiment B, but that seems less likely than an incomplete purging of both cases. In any event, both were fouled by the completion of Regiment . Creede's section (A, B(i)) of d'Olive (1606) exhibits the same italic cluster and Y-face 'M'. The large size of the fouling cluster and the progressive fouling in Regiment suggest the sequence in which the two books were printed. d'Olive was not entered in the Stationer's Register and the date of printing has not been determined beyond the imprint date of 1606. Regiment was entered 12 August 1605 but bears an imprint of 1606. The state of Creede-4 with respect to fouling at the beginning of each book seems significant. In Regiment , the text is clean except for ' I ' (the first on B1v after five S-face 'I') until the four italic ' F ' in B4. Pressure on the sorts in the cluster varies up to and including B4. S-face cluster members appear as follows: B(5), C(9), D(5), G(9), F(10), P(6), S(9), T(22). d'Olive is fouled by the end of the second page (A2v) with italic ' B I P S ' before sort-pressure has a chance to develop. This is clear from the order in which the roman and italic capitals were set in their respective sorts. The italic ' I ' at A2:6[text] is the first of the sort to be set, the ' S ' at A2:8 is the second, the ' P ' at A2v:6 is the first, the ' B ' at A2v:29 the second, and the ' G ' at A4v:29 the second. In short, Creede-4 began d'Olive with the cluster in residence. It seems certain that Regiment was printed first, and quite likely was followed closely by d'Olive . The increased recurrence rate of some members in comparison to Whore suggests that, despite the effort, each subsequent attempt to purge the font left a few more foul-case letters in residence. 55 The importance of the compositor as a key variable cannot be overestimated, judging from the relation between Windet-S and Windet-F. The alternation of Windet-F with the two cases of Windet-S in Fawne Q2 provides confirmation of proper distribution of substituted roman capitals. One compositor set text from the Windet-F cases and from one of two Windet-S cases (Windet-S2) distinguished by fouling with Windet-F. "Dulcinea" required extensive substitutions of roman 'D' in the Windet-S2 sections of G through E of Q2. 56 For whatever reason, the compositor substituted from both the Windet-S2 and Windet-F cases. Hence, the route for possible mis-distribution was: Windet-S2 and Windet-F to speech prefixes; speech prefixes to the Windet-S2 case, into which the roman type on these pages was being distributed. Windet-S2 contained a few resident Windet-F 'D' that reappear in the text at G2(2), G3v(2), F3(1), E2v(1). The Windet-F 'D' substitutions include G2(3), G3v(2), E2v(4). If these had been distributed into the Windet-S2 case, we would expect the rate of reappearance of Windet-F 'D' to increase in the latter gatherings (F-E). Moreover, the Windet-F 'D' fouling appears in Windet-S2 sections of Sophonisba at the same low rate (C2v:19, C4:33, D2:11, G3: 15). Presuming that Sophonisba was printed after Fawne Q2, the substitutions in Fawne Q2 were transient and correctly redistributed. 57 At the same time, the resident cluster of Windet-F capitals in Windet-S2 (A D G H M O T) is tolerated and recurs in Sophonisba at about the same low rate. Given the virtual impossibility of purging fouled lower-case letters, it is not surprising that the Windet-F cluster (a b g k w x y z) remains resident in Windet-S2 in both books. Purging foul-case ligatures is equally difficult, yet this compositor exhibits the ability to sort out the S-face 'ſh' and condensed Windet-F 'ſh' ligatures. Overall, Windet-S2 sections of G are heavily fouled with about 68 Windet-F letters, including two condensed 'ſh' (G3v:36). In resetting G4v from the Windet-S2 case, this compositor substituted ten condensed 'ſh' (G4v: 23-40) and then purged them. Only three appearances occur in later S2 sections of Fawne Q2 (E1:27,33, F3:39), and in heavily fouled S2 sections of Sophonisba (E3:35, E4:1, F2:1). In general, compositorial intention must be considered a pivotal factor in determining the permanence of fouling in a font. However, the process of purging foul-case letters was subject to a deliberate choice on the part of the compositor, but that decision was not inevitable, since foul-case letters were routinely tolerated and produced resident clusters. Moreover, the effectiveness of the process was limited by the class of letters that were involved. It seems clear that deliberate large-scale fouling of a small section of text created favorable mnemonic conditions for immediate purging if the compositor so desired, although even obvious foul-case letters presented some difficulties in this situation. If a highly skilled compositor was intent upon purging foul-case letters, the kind of letters made a significant difference: purging some classes of letters was well-nigh impossible, regardless of skill or intention. Hence, the relation between the ease of purging, and compositorial skill and intention, has serious implications in font analysis and identification. Fouled lower-case letters can be trusted implicitly as font discriminants, roman capitals slightly less, and italic capitals only if they can be established as resident in the roman font over a sequence of texts. Given the difficulties of purging even obvious letters, resident foul-case roman types thus tend to reappear fairly consistently over a period of time, either in a given sort or two, or in clusters if several sorts are fouled, a fact which enhances their value as font discriminants as well as evidence of presswork despite the inherent ambiguity of their specific identities. This is also true of wrong-face letters introduced through very low-level replenishment. As will be noted below, replenished wrong-face letters can occur in such low proportions that they approximate the recurrence behavior of low-density foul-case letters even though they appear more frequently than the latter. Hence, it is expedient at this point to qualify the concept of "foul-case" to include such replenished roman letters. In general, low-density fouling exhibits a random unpredictability with respect to reappearances within a text or across several texts. Thus foul-case evidence must be approached from the perspective of the statistical principles of randomness and probability rather than in simple numerical terms. The rate of appearance in a sequence of gatherings can be described in terms of the minimum-maximum frequency per unit of text, i.e., 1 appearance per three gatherings, 2-5 appearances per gathering of approximately 300 lines and so on. Since recurrence is random, these can occur anywhere within the unit, i.e., page two of the first gathering, four within the first 20 lines and none after, none until two in lines 298-299, etc. It is surprising to find such theoretical extremes regularly occurring in texts. This random behavior of low-density fouling can present a problem in font identification if the target font is compared to a similar font in only one or two other books. Members of a cluster, or the cluster itself, can skip gatherings and entire texts and thus create a presumption that a different font is in the other book. The recurrence of the S-face 'g k x' cluster in Eld-Y1 illustrates how the principle of randomness translates into non -reappearance of foul-case letters even though they are probably in the font. S-face 'k' first occurs in Mal Q2 (1 appearance), then in Whore (3), Q3 (1), Fools (4), and Eastward Hoe ! Q1 STC4971 (4); S-face 'g' first occurs in Mal Q1 (2), not in Q2, then in the later books in increasing numbers as fouling progresses toward the end of the lifetime of Eld-Y1; S-face expanded 'x' occurs first in Mal Q3 (2), skips Fools , then recurs in Eastward (3). Although the 'k' reappears consistently across the sequence of texts, the sporadic absence of the 'g x' portion of the resident cluster could suggest that the fonts are not the same. The problem is amplified within the gatherings of a single text because non-reappearance seems much more frequent, especially with clusters of 2-3 letters. In Whore , for example, the 'k' skips H-K, the 'g' appears in all four (G-K), and the 'x' does not appear. 58 The 'w' of the Windet-F 'k w' cluster in Windet-S1 likewise skips F and I(standing) in both editions of Fawne . 59 Randomness is especially noticeable in regard to the capitals. Textual demands upon upper-case sorts vary considerably, even in play-texts, a fact which can lead to the non-recurrence of a fouling capital even though it is probably in the font. Eld-Y1 is fouled early on with S-face capitals 'D E G H K O P S' that recur fairly consistently in most texts from 1603 onward except for the 'E K P'. S-face 'K' first appears in Antichrist STC7120 (1603) ([2]B5:5) in a text with low demand upon the sort, is not seen in Mal Q1-2, but then emerges in later texts ( Whore , G2:7; skips Mal Q3; Fools , B2:27; Eastward Q1, B1v:28, B2:28, E1v:28, F3v:37, I1v:8). The 'E P' are similar. The 'E' appears in Mal Q1 (B1v:14, standing E1:30), skips Q2, then appears in Whore (I1v:33), Mal Q3 (H1v:16), Fools (G3v:6) and Eastward (B4v:27, C2:24, I1v:13); the 'P' appears in Mal Q1 (B2v:16, standing D2:3), skips Q2, Whore , and Q3, then appears in Fools (H2:14) and Eastward (C2v:13, I1v:32). It seems valid to assume that the 'E K P' sorts are continuously fouled from 1603-05 for two reasons, despite the fact that they skip texts. First, their eventual reappearance conforms to the behavior expected in the context of randomness. Second, identified foul-case capitals exhibit similar behavior. 60 The S-face type G1 in Eld-Y1, for example, appears in De Vnione STC13951 (March, 1604) (B1:29), skips several books, appears in Mal Q1 (July, 1604) (E1v:9), skips Siege of Ostend (September) and Whore (November), appears in Remaines STC4521 (November) (a1:7, e2v:4), skips two, appears in Mal Q3 (January, 1605?) (H3: 24), then Fools (?, 1605) (sig. G2) and Eastward Q1 (?, 1605) (C1:30, E1v:25, I2:7). The same rationale applies to low-density foul-case italic capitals in Short-Y. Low-density italic ' P ' fouling occurs in R3 (L3:5, L3v:19, M1:1), skips 3H6 and reappears in Secretary (P2, O2:26, O2v:25, Q2:26, R3v:20, V2:3), and swash-italic ' P ' in R3 (I1v:2), 1H4 (E3:38) and Secretary (F3:23). The frequent roman 'P' substitutions in speech prefixes in 1H4 had no effect on italic fouling in the sort, since the compositor distributed both 'P' correctly. It may cautiously be inferred from the recurrence of swash-italic ' P ' in Secretary that he organized distribution according to textual units on 1H4 E3, where seven italic ' P ' occurred in speech prefixes prior to the foul-case 'P' at E3:38, but the two types are not identifiable. ' F ' is frequent in 3H6 (B2:25 and eleven others), skips R3 and 3H6 , then reappears in Secretary (O4v:12, R1:33, Aa2:30); similarly, the ' K ' fouling in 3H6 (B3:8, D6v:16) resurfaces in Secretary (F4:12). ' E ' fouling in R3 (I3:36, I3v:4, L1:13) skips 1H4 but reappears in Secretary (Rr3v:21); ' B ' appears in 1H4 (K1:25) and Secretary (H4v:4). Identified roman capitals in Short-Y recur in similar fashion. B1 appears four times in 3H6 (A3:24, B6:4, C6:18, D6:19) and 1H4 (B2v:17, C3v: 30, E1v:27, K3:14), once in R3 (H4v:19) but apparently not in Secretary . S-face T1 from the post- R3 replenishment occurs thrice in 1H4 (C1v:9, H4:33, I3v:18) and twice in Secretary (Ee4:9, Ff1:15). Despite the probability that members of a low-density cluster will fail to reappear consistently as a whole, the odds are just as good that they will. Small capitals and low-density remnants of original capitals in fonts replenished with wrong-face capitals usually reappear, perhaps because the sorts were only partially replenished. The recurrence of normal 'W' and symmetrical 'M' of Fools EF in Whore EF and Courtesan EF illustrates the manner in which randomness influences both the numerical density of recurrences and their location within units of text, a tidy two gatherings in this instance. The normal 'W' skips E of Fools to appear four times in F (F1:16, F4:13,32, F4v:20); of the three in E of Whore , E3:21 and E4v:31 are distributed (E3v:24 left standing); a normal 'W' then is reset in Courtesan at E3:33; the 'W' at F4:24 is left standing. The appearances of the symmetrical 'M' are limited to three in E of Fools (E1v:19, E4:21, E4v:14), but four appearances occur in each gathering in Whore (E1v:18, E3:23,26, E3v:32, F1:20, F1v:12,21, F4:33); two in distributed E(o) do not recur in Courtesan . Even though the 'M' at F1:20 was distributed along with the rest of the page, Courtesan sets another symmetrical 'M' in exactly the same location—what are the odds on this happening? However astronomical, another instance occurs in reset B in Fawne Q2, where the Y-face 'R' appears again at B1:32, accounting for the only two appearances of the letter in Q1-2. The few anomalous letters of Fools CD, I, reappear in d'Olive EF with random variation: the Guyot 'G' once per gathering in Fools (C2v:14, D2v:21, I3:18) but only once in d'Olive (F3v:34); the Y-face 'M' twice in Fools (C3v:18, I2:32) but twice in one gathering in d'Olive (E1v:1, E2:14, F3v:17); the 76mm 'Y' four times in Fools (D2:34, I1:21, I2v:25, I3v:2) but once in d'Olive (E3v:31). Finally, the small, low-riding 'W' in R3 (H3:38, H4:28) skips two gatherings before recurring (L1v:32, L2v:5). 61 In short, the behavior of low-density foul-case letters must be approached in terms of a probable range of recurrence rather than in a simple numerical term, and the even probability of random non-recurrence must be borne in mind. In the instance of Eld-Y1, for example, the cluster members consisting of S-face 'D G H O S', Guyot 'S', and black letter query represent stable components of the resident population of their respective sorts. The principle of randomness indicates that, in theory, each or all may skip gatherings. But across several texts, they produce appearances per gathering consisting of usually 1-2 'D', 1-3 'G', 1-2 'H', 1-3 'O', 2-4 S-face 'S', 2-5 Guyot 'S', and about half of the time 1-3 black letter query. Even though individual letters in the cluster do skip gatherings, they all usually appear in texts of three or more gatherings. The same kind of behavior based on the probable range of recurrence can be noted in low-density clusters in Short-Y, Purfoot-Y, Windet-S1 and -S2, Danter-M, and Braddock-Y1. The principle that the recurrence of low-density fouling is independent of pressure on a sort is implicit in the preceding examples, particularly in regard to reset portions of Whore and Mal Q1-2 (' S '), where sort-pressure is identical to that exerted in the original setting. However, the minute number of foul-case types noted in these examples obscures the randomness of recurrence in short units of text, such as the page or a gathering or two, that is characteristic of independence from sort-pressure. That randomness is more obvious in the recurrence of foul-case and replenished wrong-face letters that occur in higher proportions than low-density foul-case letters. Again, proportions must be viewed in terms of a range into which numbers are distributed. In general, fouling and replenishment of less than roughly 8-10% exhibits a randomness similar to low-density fouling in an experiential context, that is, the wrong-face letters are missing much of the time and it is necessary to search for them. A transition region occurs roughly between levels of 10-20%. As the proportion of a wrong-face letter moves upward through the region, recurrence exhibits an increasingly direct correlation between sort-pressure and frequency of appearance until the wrong-face letter behaves as a dependent variable. For example, Simmes-S was replenished with a Y-face 'g' and condensed 'p' but in different proportions. The random behavior of moderate fouling and low-level replenishment can be seen in recurrence of the Y-face 'g' across four texts. Hamlet Q1 (1603), Mal Q1-2 H, and Mal Q3 A-E are unrelated texts, while FG of Mal Q1-2-3 are essentially identical (give or take a few lines in Q3). The number of appearances of Y-face 'g' vary in the sequence of gatherings, but as a variable that is independent of the total number of 'g' in the texts. The frequencies of the normal 'g' therefore are omitted in the tabulation (see Appendix, Table 1). The number of appearances is random, that is, is as likely to be low (1-2) as high (5-8). Moreover, the appearances in FG exhibit no correlation with respect to the three related and one unrelated texts. Although the 'g' consistently recurs in each sequence of gatherings set from Simmes-S, it frequently skips pages and is buried in disproportionate numbers of normal letters ( Hamlet B, 3/131). This aspect of random behavior can be illustrated by a comparison of two fonts that are fouled in the same sort, a factor which levels any skewing that might arise due to the variable frequency of letters in an English text. The low-density S-face erect g2 of Fools EF and the Y-face 'g' of Simmes-S occur as shown in Table 2 (see Appendix), which groups appearances in related ( Whore-Courtesan E and Mal Q1-3 FG) and unrelated texts ( Fools E, Hamlet E) for each font. The randomness of appearance is obvious when the locations are examined in gatherings with similar totals. The two 'g' of Q1 F and Q3 G appear both early and late, the seven of Q2 G appear in only three pages while the eight of Hamlet E in 6 pages, only one 'g' occurs in page 3 of the ten gatherings, and so on. Likewise, the 'g' in related reset texts vary both in totals and locations. Fools EF differs from Simmes-S in regard to the slightly higher frequency of appearance of the 'g'. If both were S-fonts, this would provide a potential quantitative discriminant between the two. Other members of the low-level clusters in each would probably exhibit similar differences which, when combined with that seen in the 'g', would provide strong evidence that the fonts are not the same. The Simmes-S cluster, for example, includes the replenished 'p' and S-face x1. In contrast to the Y-face 'g', the replenished 'p', which accounts for about 22% of the sort in Simmes-S, exhibits a clear dependence upon sort-pressure across the sequence of gatherings in Hamlet Q1 and Mal Q3. Hence, a positive correlation obtains between the frequencies of appearance of the replenished and the S-face 'p'. However, the frequency of appearance within the pages of a gathering is influenced not only by sort-pressure, but also by additional factors such as the order of distribution and the alternation of the cases from which type is set. Thus the appearances according to pages can vary widely and appear random to a degree, although the relative densities of the two letters are constant for the most part (see Appendix, Table 3). Textual demands differ considerably, with seven gatherings of Q3 requiring more 'p' than eight of Hamlet . Although the sort-pressure swings radically among gatherings, the frequency distributions track rather closely. The slightly higher maximum in Q3 (25 in Q3 B, 21 in Hamlet G) is not significant statistically as an indicator of further replenishment between the two texts. Taken as a whole, the low-level 'g' and moderate-level 'p x' cluster could be expected to discriminate Simmes-S from other S-fonts. For example, The Supplication of Certaine Massepriests Q1 STC14432 (1604) was assigned to the English Secret Press by Woodfield ( Surreptitious Printing ) and the new STC although Simmes shared in several subsequent editions. The S-font composite of Q1 (A2-G2r) exhibits the same variants as in Simmes's sections of later editions, including the 'g p x' cluster. The 'g p' distributions included in the Tables leave little doubt that the font is Simmes-S. Nonetheless, subsequent fouling or replenishment can shift the proportions of wrong-face letters in a sort and possibly cause confusion in comparing two fonts. For example, a moderate-level replenishment of Simmes-S with S-face 'p' after Hamlet Q1 would have this effect. In such a situation, Knowledge of compositorial fouling-purging habits as observed in other texts can support a hypothesis that progressive fouling is responsible for a shift in the number or the proportions of cluster members, as seen earlier in Creede-4. This kind of shift occurs in the progressive fouling of Windet-F with S-face 'w' between Spectres and Fawne . CD of Spectres exhibit ratios (S-face/normal 'w') of 11/187 and 10/213; the ratios in Fawne Q1 G(o) and reset portions of F (1, 2v-3, 3v-4) are 13/151 and 11/141. 62 The fouling behavior of the Windet compositor(s) in Fawne Q1-2 G, reset portions of Q2, and Sophonisba D, E4, F2, and G2v-3 leaves progressive fouling of Windet-F as the only plausible explanation for the increased level of foul-case 'w'. In another instance, progressive fouling in Eld-Y1 after Mal Q1-2 expanded the resident cluster with S-face 'A C L Y' that recur as usual in later texts. The additional letters first appear in Whore ('C': G4v:23; 'L': I1:38, I3:20; 'Y': I4v:15), then Mal Q3 ('A': H4v:12, I2v:39; 'C': H2:22; 'L': I1:14; 'Y': I2:4), and Eastward ('A': E2:12, F3v:16; 'C': C2v:22, F2v:37; 'L': E1:14, F2v:17). Finally, 'R' first appears in Eastward (A2:27, C2v:27, E1:36, F2v:22) toward the end of Eld-Y1's lifetime. Situations like this definitely require a survey of earlier texts to define the initial resident cluster and its rate of recurrence. Overall, the frequency of appearance of the original cluster is fairly consistent until Whore , when an increase can be noted along with the expansion of the cluster. That the two shifts occur together suggests progressive fouling of one font rather than two separate fonts. Eld's compositors were quite careful about fouling, setting texts in both Eld-S and Eld-Y1, and alternating the two fonts in Eastward Hoe ! Q1-3, without producing anything more than low-density fouling in a few sorts, and successfully purging most of the foul-case letters from Eld-S after Sejanus . The shift in Eld-Y1 in Whore probably is attributable to the depleted condition of the font rather than compositorial habit. A different kind of shift occurs when large-scale replenishment modifies cluster composition. The resident cluster in Short-Y includes moderate levels of italic ' T ' in 3H6 and R3 , but the replenishment with S-face 'T' and purging of italic ' T ' has a dramatic impact on the cluster. Similarly, introduction of the 'oo' ligature in Short-Y after 3H6 adds an obvious (although not wrong-face) letter to the font that is useful as a cluster member. Short-Y looks quite different as a result. A similar effect occurs in Simmes-S through normal attrition of wrong-face letters introduced by replenishment. The few Y-face 'M' in the 1604 Simmes-S (noted earlier) are remnants of low-level replenishment (4-7 appearances per gathering) around 1597 (see R3 , A-G). Finally, the relatively large number of recurrent identifiable S-face capitals in the Braddock-Y1 cluster from January, 1598, to October, 1600, reveals the effect upon cluster composition and recurrence behavior exerted by the relationship between a periodic decision to purge unwanted letters and the size of a sort-population. It should be noted that compositorial intention to purge letters perceived as not belonging in a font applies equally to foul-case and heavily damaged letters. The residence of the identifiable S-face capitals is attributable to two factors: (1) the deliberately replenished wrong-face capitals were automatically tolerated; and (2), the extent of damage was inconsequential as a motivation to purge such letters routinely within or between texts: the very bold, heavily damaged A2 and gross T1-3 are brutally obvious on a small octavo page with 3-7 capitals at most, yet were tolerated in the cluster for two years. 63 The regularity and frequency of recurrence is striking, given the size of three of the sample texts (prose octavos, 3, 11, and 13 sigs.) with their extremely low demand on capitals and the slightly higher demand of one verse octavo (7 sigs.) as compared to the two mostly-verse play-texts (see Appendix). At some point in 1599, a decision to purge removed some damaged S-face capitals with differing impact upon cluster appearance. The cluster is unaffected by the loss of letters (such as A2, A5, A6) in sorts with high populations or the non-recurrence of A3 between Edward II Q2 (STC17483, 1598; F2:37) and MND (October, 1600; E1:13, F3v:19, G1v:13). However, the eventual purging of T1-3 (probably foul-case 96mm letters) dramatically affects the cluster, since these are the only oversized 'T' in the font. Similarly, the short-term transient 96mm 'C' apparently were purged at the same time with significant impact upon the cluster ( A Short Forme STC12312, 1599, nine appearances). An earlier decision (early 1599?) to purge the large italic portion of the cluster had even greater impact upon cluster composition (see Appendix). Despite the effort, italic I 1 (and possibly I 2) escaped detection or were tolerated ( I 1: Ed.II , A3:13; C1:18, E2v:3, G1:33; Celestial Elegies STC 21225 [1598], C4v:6, D1v:10; MND , A3:13, E4:10 etc.), as was the italic Q . In the final analysis, a survey of a font across several texts or years is the only way to detect the kinds of shifts in cluster composition illustrated in the foregoing examples. 64</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII To summarise, although this kind of evidence requires a tedious searching of sample texts, the section of a font composite which indicates the kind and proportion of replenished abnormal letters and resident foul-case letters and punctuation is a potent tool for distinguishing same-face fonts. Mutually exclusive clusters of these letters usually provide adequate evidence of the identities of such fonts. 65 Fortunately, much of this evidence can be found in high quality reproductions since it consists of obvious classes of letters and marks. However, it must be approached with an awareness of the manner in which the ease of purging and compositorial intention is affected by the class of letter. Otherwise, confusion can result about the distinction between transient and resident fouling. Thus the interpretation of obvious foul-case italic capitals and punctuation, black letter punctuation, and small capitals must be preceded by a survey of the font aimed at establishing these as either transient or resident. Lower-case letters can be trusted implicitly as resident in a font. Letters introduced by moderate-to-heavy fouling and replenishment appear with such consistency across a sequence of gatherings that residence is usually not an issue. The interpretation of this evidence in font identification must be qualified by an understanding of the relations among the density of cluster members, sort-pressure and random recurrence behavior. Low-density fouling is accompanied by an even probability of non-recurrence in a sequence of gatherings and across texts. Hence, the non-recurrence of low-density letters must be approached with extreme caution when comparing two fonts, since the non-identity of the fonts cannot be inferred from non-recurrence unless this behavior is consistent across several texts. A difference in the proportions of cluster members or an expanded cluster in one of two fonts may be significant in distinguishing fonts, given the dynamics of the fouling, purging and replenishment processes. A part of the cluster will usually remain constant despite the variations in the other members. 66 Furthermore, differences in proportions provide the basis for inferring states of a font and can provide evidence of the sequence of printing if an adequate sample of cluster members is available in a sequence of books. Finally, clusters are especially valuable in initially determining whether portions of a text were printed from standing type in a sequence of editions even though the cluster letters are not identifiable. The first obvious clue to printing from standing type is that the wrong-face and wrong-size letters are always in exactly the same textual positions in both editions. Reproductions are adequate for this initial insight, but only an examination of originals can provide positive proof of printing from standing type. 67 As implied in the preceding discussion, the recurrence patterns exhibited by resident clusters suggests an obvious relevance of this kind of evidence to compositorial and presswork analysis, but the subject as a whole is beyond the scope of this paper, needs further investigation, and will be addressed later. However, the implications of recurrent patterns of resident fouling should be briefly noted in regard to the common practice of inferring the method and order of setting, and distribution points, from type shortages and substitutions. The simple fact that resident wrong-face types tend to recur in clusters argues against viewing them as repetitive acts of fouling unless the history of the font shows that these appearances result from transient fouling during the setting of the particular text in question. Given the varying demands of a text upon the variety of sorts in a wrong-face cluster, the odds against recurrent shortages that require the same limited set of substitutions in a sequence of gatherings must be astronomical. For example, this is tantamount to claiming that the text of Mal Q1 required substitutions of the S-face 'G O D' part of the resident cluster first on B3, then again on D1. Unless the distinction between transient and resident fouling and the principle of randomness is borne in mind, the locations of appearances of foul-case letters can be tortured into supporting any plausible explanation of the order of setting and distribution. As the random recurrence tables discussed above show, no particular setting order is necessary to distribute foul-case letters into the early or late pages of a gathering, nor is a distribution required to yield a normal letter after the first appearance of a foul-case letter. Random recurrence does the job without help from the compositor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix I Y-face 'k' Variants The various dimensions noted for the 'k' are measured as follows. Width is taken between points dead-center in the particular elements of the letter: (1) link: ascender to arm junction; (2) arm-leg alignment: ascender to arm-serif junction and to the dead-center of the leg at the base-serif junction. Length: (1) arm: point at the arm-link junction to the junction at the bottom of the arm-serif; (2) leg: right apex of the enclosed arm-leg angle to the center of the base-serif on the right edge of the leg, adjusted for damage to the base-serif. Height: top edge of the ascender top-serif to the bottom edge of the base-serif, measured on new undamaged letters (otherwise adjusted for damage to the serifs). Arm-angle: measured in degrees above horizontal as established by a perpendicular through the ascender. The normal 'k' sort includes several variants differentiated by subtle structural differences that cannot be attributed to the usual distorting factors. The reason for the plethora of 'k' variants is that the Y-face is doubtlessly French in origin and consequently lacked the 'k', hence the need for 'k' punches to complete sets of matrices probably supplied from France. The puzzling fact is that the Y-face 'k' is not even a close stylistic cousin of the more awkward, broader, high-angle arm (72-84 deg.) 'k' variants cut by the Dutch and German punchcutters. Paradoxically, it has more in common with italic ' k '. The major stylistic trait of "elegant" k1, for example, is the staggered vertical alignment of arm-leg, where the leg extends beyond the arm (0.95mm vs 0.85mm), a standard italic ' k ' trait that is complemented by the high-angle arm (48 degrees) topped by a right offset, wide (0.65mm) crescent serif that reaches upward like an outstretched hand. The right half of the leg-serif usually points downward like the extended foot of a ballerina. Like a Granjon italic ' k ', k1 is a flowing lively letter, totally unlike the ponderous static Dutch and German 'k'. The remaining 'k' variants illustrate the difficulty of cutting such a complex letter and maintaining balanced proportions among the various elements. The arm-leg of "bent-arm" variant k2 align vertically (0.9mm), and the serif usually extends on both sides of the leg. The structure of the high-angle (48-52 deg.) arm is evident only at high magnification: it bends to form perpendicular junctions with both the short link (0.45mm) and the centered bullet serif which frequently inks underside only and prints as a crescent. New samples of "defective serif" k3 show a full-printing, centered bullet arm-serif and full leg-serif; a shallow strike is probably responsible for the defective arm-serif which usually prints only the rear underside, if at all, as if the arm stroke jerked upward to the left. The high angle arm (48 deg.) and leg align vertically (0.85-0.9mm); an inking peculiarity gives the leg a "knee" or apparent bend, although the bend is real in many old types; the leg serif is usually missing to the right. Several low-angle (42 degree arm) variants are common. "Oblique-junction" k4 is unique in that the arm-leg link (0.5mm) forms an oblique rather the usual perpendicular junction with the ascender while the link-leg junction is nearly perpendicular; the low-angle arm is topped by a large (0.75mm) level slab serif offset right, frequently bent up on the right to approximate a thin crescent, or worn down in old letters to a much shorter length. The arm-leg align vertically (0.9mm); the right portion of the leg-serif is frequently missing. The "long-leg" k5 variant is formed with a high ascender junction (0.95-1.05mm) and a short link (0.4mm) in order to accommodate the long leg (0.95-1.0mm vs a normal 0.85-0.9mm). The low-angle arm is shorter than usual (0.5mm vs 0.65mm) and topped by a medium crescent. The ascender base-serif is quite thick, making measurements of the junction height difficult. Later White-M ( Fools , CD, I) has a 'k' (k5b) with a similar appearance due to the high link junction (0.95mm) and short arm (0.55mm) but the link is longer (0.55mm) and the leg shorter (0.9mm) than in k5 ( Fools , C1v:11 "winke", C3:25 "booke", 36 "Marke", D1:31 "kind", D2:12 "make", I1v:18 "drinke"). In "long-arm" variant k6, the quite long low angle arm (0.75-0.85mm vs 0.55-0.65mm) extends slightly beyond the leg (0.95mm vs 0.85-0.9mm), despite a short link (0.4mm). New letters exhibit a wide (0.7mm), level slab serif which, ironically, usually is worn down and prints as a dot. The letter's appearance is dominated by the arm which hangs in space somewhat like a fishing pole. "Defective-serif" k3 often approximate the appearance of k6 because of printing characteristics, but measurements easily settle the issue if no k6 is nearby for visual comparison ( R3 , I4:34, M2v:17; Fools , E1:9,33; Essays STC18041, Yy1v:5 "knots").

      <field name="fulltext">Appendix III Comparative Analysis of Fools CD, I, and EF In general, same-face fonts frequently require an extensive analysis of every variant sort. The relative lack of variants and the stylistic uniformity of Y-fonts forces the comparative analysis of two Y-fonts to focus upon subtle differentiae such as the proportions of new/old letters in various sorts, and anomalous and foul-case letters. The opposite is true of S-fonts. Letters from most of the 54 variant punches and 16 miscastings (excluding misjustified low-rider capitals: b2, h3, n3,4 t2, D2, E3, F2, fl2, ff1b, ff2b, ſh2,3, ſi2, ſſ2, ſt2) frequently appear together in normal S-fonts, making necessary an analysis of all composite groups in order eventually to isolate several discriminants that appear in only one of the two texts being compared. The S-face components of White-M and Stafford-EF are easier to distinguish than normal S-fonts, since the EF-face lacks several S-face letters (see list below). In general, the lengths of the texts affect the certainty of the results. In shared sections of 4 or more quarto gatherings, the inference that a variant is absent from one font is fairly reliable. However, in short sections of one or two gatherings, this inference must be considered tentative, especially in low-frequency sorts (see later discussion of random recurrence patterns), until verified in other texts (White-M, Witts New Dyall STC22426 [1604], d'Olive EF; Stafford-EF, Vertues Due STC20169 [1603], Genealogy STC12872 [1604], Articles of Agreement STC18455 [1607]). For example, the EF-face 'z' (width: 1.25mm) appears a few times in Whore (E2:32, F4v:10) and Gen (p. 9:27) along with Y-face 'z' (width: 1.45mm) ( Whore , E2v:22, E3:6,22,23; Gen , p. 14:35) and S-face z1. Sort-pressure is quite high in Whore (compositorial preference for "cozen", "coz" forms), but very low in Fools (EF total: 6), a possible reason for the exclusive appearance of z1 in Fools (E1:33, E1v:2, F2v:3). The EF-face and Y-face 'z' could nonetheless still reside in the cases. In instances such as the exclusive moderate-level g1 in CD, I, (about 17/gathering) and low-density g2 in EF (about 6/gathering), a consistent frequency distribution vs sort-pressure in two gatherings is a fairly reliable indication of the strong probability that a variant is absent (i.e., S-g1 vs Y-g, 17/147, 13/142, no S-g2). The low-density of ligature samples in short texts such as Fools EF requires the examination of every ligature (excepting the exclusive 'ſh' variants) to isolate and classify the S-face ligatures, but even then, the sample is minimal so that the results must be considered tentative until confirmed in other texts. Furthermore, the overall condition of letters in a sort can cause difficulty. Moderate-level (CD, I, 15/gathering) S-face k1,3 can be confused with unclear samples of replenished EF-face k1,2 (EF-k1: C4v:11, D1:19 "spark"; E2:17, E2v:35, E3:2, E4v:21; oblique junction EF-k2: D1:17 "like"); only one anomalous sample (F4:28 "like") of S-k1 in EF emerged after examining all such 'k'. Similarly, an EF-b1 (F2v:30 "tables") with a heavily-inked bowl frequently looks like S-b1 (a single anomalous S-b1 occurs at F2: 29). Finally, White-M's consistent low-riding capitals (A B C F G H K L M N P R S V Y) differentiate it from Stafford-EF's correctly justified capitals (except for some 'A B R'); similarly, Stafford-EF lacks the low-riding misjustified ligatures of White-M. While searching through a text for clean samples of letters in a given typeface, it is wise to maintain a separate composite for sketching and noting locations of alternate-face letters for reference at a later stage of analysis. The fact that both White-M and Stafford-EF are mixed fonts emerges in early stages of analysing the S-face components; each yields alternate-face lower-case letters and ligatures in the stylistically recognisable sorts. The additional "gross features" discriminants provided by the different alternate-faces (Y-face and EF-face subset) is a mixed blessing since several Y-face and EF-face letters are unresolvable in reproductions. The Y-face and EF-face variants in 'b d', for example, require precise measurements in originals to detect differences in structure and size; the EF-face b1, d1,2, and 'h p t' are easily confused with their S-face counterparts. The ovals group illustrates the problem of "too many" potential variants in mixed fonts. The wide (1.2mm) EF-p2 and the expanded S-p1 (width: 1.3mm) are difficult to distinguish, even when juxtaposed (see single sample of S-p1, F1v:26 "ap /p/ oynt"). Similarly, the Y-p in EF (F4v:19) differs from the EF-p2 (E1:2 "su /p/ pose", E4v:33) chiefly in descender-length (1.15mm vs 1.25mm). The EF-d1,2 and S-d1,2 appear together in approximately equal proportions in Stafford-EF. The two d1 exhibit similar dimensions (width: 1.15mm, junction separation: 1.15mm, height: 3.0mm) but differ in junction angles and formation, top-serif, bowl-stroke, and height of the ascender above the top junction (EF-d1: E1:30 "doubt", E4v:30 "doubt", E1:5 "doe"; S-d1: E1:13 "poynted"). The two d2 differ in bowl-width (1.225mm vs 1.2mm), junction angles and junction separation (1.3mm vs 1.15mm), and EF-d2 is a thicker letter; nonetheless, the two are indistinguishable to the naked eye when heavily-inked (EF-d2: E1:31 "day", E3:29 "diuorced", E4v:30 "day"; S-d2: E2v:5 "dycing"). Similarly, a wrong-face 'd' in CD, I (C1:18 "related", C2:26 "dayes", D3v:18 "In /d/ eede", D4v:14 "darkest") is easily confused with Y-face 'd' (C1:29 "feared", C1v:12 "good"), differing in bowl width (1.25mm vs 1.2mm) and junction separation (1.45mm vs 1.35mm). In addition to the S-face 'b' variants in CD, I, and EF, an anomalous 'b' occurs in each font. The shorter (2.85-2.9mm), narrower (width: 1.15mm) variant of CD, I (C1:25, C1v:22 "but", D2:12) with wide junction separation (1.45mm) can be confused with lightly-inked samples of the anomalous variant in EF which has the same junction separation, is slightly taller (2.9-3.0mm) and wider (1.175mm) (E1:28, E2:15 "business", E4:11,30), and both appear to be EF-b1, since all three exhibit a slight but noticeable right slant (about 3 deg.). Expanded EF-b2 (width: 1.3mm, junctions: 1.45mm) appears less frequently in CD, I (C2:3,19 "bound") than in EF (E1v:10, E3v:19) and can be confused with Y-face 'b' (C1:36 "breath", C1v:6 "be"[2nd], 17), although the top-junction is perpendicular rather than at an oblique angle. Unstressed EF-y (apex: 35 deg., E1:11,13,14) with usually non-printing serifs looks like Y-y2 (apex: 38 deg.) with worn serifs. The low-angle top-stroke of EF-a (E1:3) creates a large counter like that of S-a, but the shoulder is a tight curve and it is a thicker letter, and is usually easily distinguished from the Y-face 'a' variants in CD, I; the mixture of Y-face 'k' variants differs in the two fonts (see lists below). The cross of the EF-e actually does slant downward. Another possible source of confusion in a superficial analysis of the lower-case is the fact that both fonts contain several B-face letters which are obvious ('a', C1:26 "and"; 'd', C2:26 "dayes"; 'e', E1:3 "raigne", I3:2 "mee case"; 'm', E4:1 "shame"; 'c n' seen, not noted) as well as a massive 'o' (C3:5 "lose", F1:30 "our", F4:26 "you"). Both CD, I, and EF use a combination of S-face and alternate-face ligatures, limited to the Y-face in CD, I, with low-density remnants of Y-face 'ff' (one at C2v:30) and 'ct' (two at D1v:24, D3:11), and the unique 'oo' (C3:34) and 'th' (C2:4,7). EF uses Y-face 'ſl' (width: 1.15mm, height: 2.75mm, F3v:16, F4:28, [Eld-Y1, G1:33]), miscast ſſi2 with the short 'i' and leaning middle letter ('ſ' and 'i' spacing, x-line: 1.0mm, baseline: 1.05mm, E3v:18, [Eld-Y1, G3:8; ſſi1 with correctly aligned letters [spacing, 1.05mm] and normal 'i', G3:1]). The few Y-fi1 (width: 1.1mm, height: 2.9mm, E1:16) are taller than the EF 'f1' but usually look the same (width: 1.05mm, height: 2.75mm, E1:20, E2:4, E3:27, E4:22, F1:11, F3v:3). The 'ſi' sort includes two EF-face variants (same height: 2.7mm) that can be confused with the S-face 'ſi". EF-ſi1 is vertically stressed with the shoulder terminating in a larger pear and letters spaced 1.1mm (F4v:1) while ſi2 is unstressed and narrower (width: 1.0.-1.05mm, E4:7, 9, F1:28, F2:2,3); the three are difficult to sort out in the worn condition of Stafford-EF. The condensed 'ſſ' (width 0.9-0.95mm) is distinctive (E2:8,15, E1v:32, F1v:21,23,24), yet measurements are frequently required to distinguish it from the Y-face ligature. The EF-ſh ligature exhibits a high junction (1.5mm) and slanted ascender (spacing, x-line: [1.2mm, 1.05mm], baseline: [1.15mm, 1.15mm]) and is easily recognised. One anomalous 'fl' appears at E1:6 (width: 1.15mm, height: 2.85mm).</field>

I also thank Fredson Bowers for suggesting the approach of the paper and encouraging and guiding its progress, and Peter Blayney for commenting and sharing his vast knowledge of the subject. 1 "Edward Allde as a Typical Trade Printer", The Library , 4th ser., 10 (1929), 121-162.

Hoppe, "John Wolfe, Printer and Publisher, 1579-1601", The Library , 4th ser., 14 (1933), 241-288. These studies concentrate on printer's devices almost entirely with only passing reference to type fonts (see note 5 below). Edwin Eliott Willoughby, A Printer of Shakespeare [William Jaggard] (London, 1934). W. Craig Ferguson, Valentine Simmes, Printer to Shakespeare et al. (University Press of Virginia, 1968) was the first to describe and use a printer's type fonts in identifying his work in sections of shared books. Dennis Woodfield, Surreptitious Printing in England, 1550-1640 (Bibliographical Society of America, 1973). C. L. Oastler included quite unsatisfactory specimens of John Day's type fonts in John Day, the Elizabethan Printer (Oxford Bibliographical Society, 1975) with identifications of punchcutters where possible, pp. 40-43. Akihiro Yamada, Thomas Creede, Printer to Shakespeare and his Contemporaries (Shinsu University, 1981) catalogued appearances of ornamental stock. Clifford Chalmers Huffman, Elizabethan Impressions: John Wolfe and his Press (AMS Press, 1988). See also Peter H. M. Blayney, note 10 below. 2 "The Prevalence of Shared Printing in the Early Seventeenth Century", Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 67 (1973), 437-442. 3 This limitation does not necessarily apply to longer books, especially prose texts with chapter and section divisions which invite the insertion of ornaments and initials. Several of the quarto and folio prose texts referenced later begin sections with ornamental stock as a matter of course. 4 This is not a new idea. There are about a half-dozen extant early records of legal proceedings involving the identification of the printers of pirated or seditious books by their type fonts. For some examples, see Talbot Baines Reed, A History of the Old English Letter Founders (London, 1887), pp. 123-133. 5 McKerrow overlooked the potential of font analysis and defined what seems to have become a prevalent attitude: "Of Allde's types [type fonts] there is little to say. . . . So far at least I have observed, there is nothing in the types used to distinguish Allde's work from that of a dozen other printers" (p. 147) (Allde actually used four easily distinguished pica roman fonts between 1590-1605). Some years later, Fredson Bowers noted the potential value of the description of fonts in a book, Principles of Bibliographical Description (Princeton University Press, 1949), p. 127, and later commented (p. 305): "The font of the type used in the text, whether roman, italic, or gothic, is given; when possible, this type should be identified by reference to books on printing types, but for books of this period precise identification is usually difficult." See my comment on this problem, note 36 below. One purpose of this paper is to lay a foundation for future work leading to the "precise identification" of fonts by reference to Elizabethan books and printers' fonts. 6 This comment applies to every study of a book printed in two or more fonts that I have seen. The consequent analyses of compositors and presswork inevitably are incorrect with respect to the assignment of compositors, running titles, skeletons, number of presses, sequence of setting and printing and other aspects of printing. For example, W. W. Greg distinguished three sections in The Honest Whore on the basis of type fonts, but missed the EF and G-K division, correctly noting it in the second edition by reference to running titles, "'The Honest Whore' or 'The Converted Courtesan'", The Library , 4th ser., 15 (1935), 54-60, repeated by Fredson Bowers (see note 40 below); and G. Blakemore Evans, "Textual Introduction", All Fools , ed. G. Blakemore Evans, in The Plays of George Chapman: The Comedies , gen. ed. Allan Holiday (University of Chicago Press, 1970), 227-232. Evans attributed three compositors to Eld although two belong to the sharing printers. Even though W. W. Greg had specifically noted that a different font appears in one section, Evans begged off: "I cannot see any significant difference, but Greg's eye was sharp and trained and I hesitate to disagree with his years of experience on such a matter" (p. 229). Likewise Akihiro Yamada ignored the issue and attributed four compositors to Eld in "A Bibliographical Study of George Chapman's All Fools (1605)", The Shakespeare Society of Japan , 3 (1964), 73-99. Both concluded that All Fools was printed on one press, although they disagreed as to whether casting-off of copy was required. See also: G. K.

See my discussion of several of the above in "Reproductions of Early Dramatic Texts as a Source of Bibliographical Evidence", TEXT , 4 (1988), 237-268. 7 Two forms of measurement indicate the size of an early typeface: (1) the "20-line" measurement in millimeters is the distance from a point in one line to the corresponding point in the twenty-first line of type above or below set without leading (a thin strip of lead placed between lines in later centuries), the line from which the measurement starts being included in the count; (2) the "bare" measurement in millimeters is the distance from the top of an ascender to the bottom of a descender in a single line (i.e., top of the 'h' to the bottom of the 'y' in "thy") multiplied by 20. The complementary measurements are necessitated by the fact a given typeface could be cast on taller bodies than that for which it was designed. 8 The technical terminology for the various elements of letter-forms has never been standardized to any degree of unanimity. Philip Gaskell, "A Nomenclature for the Letter-forms of Roman Type", The Library , 5th ser., 29 (1974), pp. 42-51, is the most comprehensive attempt with a glossary of terms and a complete roman alphabet with the term for each element of each letter. Gaskell differs in some respects from the nomenclature traditionally used in historical typography. The physical space occupied by a line of type is defined by four imaginary lines: (1) letters sit on the "baseline"; (2) the "x-line" (Gaskell: "mean line") defines the shoulder height ("x-height") of lower-case letters (m, n, b etc.); (3) the "h-line" ("ascender line") defines the height reached by ascender above the x-line; (4) the "descender line" defines the lowest level reached by letters which protrude below the baseline (g p q y). In regard to other terms, I prefer the traditional "pear" to his "bulbous terminal". "Cross-stroke" (or "cross") seems descriptive of the horizontal strokes in 'A E F T'; the "arm" and "leg" (or "tail") of the 'k' seems preferable to an "upper diagonal" which is topped by an "upper diagonal serif" and a "lower diagonal" terminated by a "lower diagonal serif"; the lower part of the 'g' has always been a "loop", and calling it a "tail" seems inappropriate because it does not look like the "tail" of a 'y' or 'R' or 'Q'; it seems inconsistent to gloss "ascender" as "the extended stem of b, d, f, h, k, l, tall-s" and then use "stem" exclusively to refer to all vertical elements of both short and tall letters, especially when the latter are traditionally "ascenders". 9 A font composite is compiled by sketching the stylistic features seen in a font's several groups of letters, punctuation and fouled sorts. The value of the font composite arises from the fact that it defines a font in terms of sets of specific distinguishing features. The diagonal letters form one set, the ligatures another and so on. When comparing two fonts, the sets provide an efficient method for quantitatively estimating the chances that the two are the same. See my discussion in "Reproductions as a Source", pp. 251-255. 10 Reference will be made in the following discussion to typeface specimens of the period. The major sources of reproductions of extant founders' specimens are found in a few ground-breaking facsimiles collections specifically intended as a basis of historical study of early types and punchcutters. (1) J. Dreyfus &amp; others eds., Type Specimen Facsimiles , Vol. I, Nos. 1-15 (London, 1963). The anonymous Folger c.1565 specimen sheet attributed to Francois Guyot is reproduced as no. 1; the individual specimens of Guyot typefaces are also reproduced in their appropriate section of ref. 4 below. (2) Stanley Morison, John Fell, the University Press and the 'Fell' Types (Oxford, 1967). (3) Hendrik D. L. Vervliet &amp; Harry Carter eds., Type Specimen Facsimiles , Vol. II, Nos. 16-18, "Reproductions of Christopher Plantin's 'Index Sive Characterum 1567' &amp; 'Folio Specimen of c.1585' together with the 'Le Be-Moretus Specimen c.1599'" (University of Toronto Press, 1972). The three extant specimen collections indicated in the title are numbers 16, 17 and 18 in the two volume sequence; each of the three are independently numbered and paginated, a possible source of confusion in references. For clarity's sake, I refer to a specimen by title and specimen number within the section, i.e., "'Le Be' 12" signifies specimen number 12 in the "Le Be" section (no. 18), or by title and page number within the section, i.e., "Le Be" note 13, p. 14. (4) Hendrik D. L. Vervliet, Sixteenth-Century Printing Types of the Low Countries (Menno Hertzberger &amp; Co., Amsterdam, 1968). Specimens are both labeled according to group (i.e., "R17" signifies "roman typeface specimen number 17") and by figure number ("Fig. 186") in this sequentially paginated volume. (5) Joseph Moxon, Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing, Herbert Davis and Harry Carter eds. (Oxford, 1962). (6) Fournier on Typefounding . The Text of 'The Manuel de Typographigue' , Harry Carter tr. &amp; ed. (The Fleuron Books, London, 1930), esp. Ch. XI "Striking Matrices", pp. 81-88, and Ch. XII "Justifying Matrices", pp. 89-98. The most comprehensive application of historical knowledge about the type production process to a printer's pica roman font is found throughout Peter W. M. Blayney's The Texts of 'King Lear' and Their Origins Vol. I (Cambridge University Press, 1982). The history of typography found in the previous references is complemented in Harry Carter, "The Types of Christopher Plantin", The Library , 5th ser., 11 (1956), 170-179, which reproduces the Varia II folio specimen of the Plantin-Moretus Archives. Also valuable is A. F. Johnson, "The Supply of Types in the Sixteenth Century", The Library , 4th ser., 22 (1944), 47-65; and Paul Beaujon, "The 'Garamond' Types: Sixteenth &amp; Seventeenth Century Sources Considered", The Fleuron: A Journal of Typography , 5 (London, 1926), 131-179, reprinted in Fleuron Anthology , Francis Maynell &amp; Herbert Simon eds. (University of Toronto Press, 1979), 181-214. A frequently referenced paper by Frank Isaac, "Elizabethan Roman and Italic Types", The Library , 4th ser., 14 (1933-34), 85-100 and 212-228, is misleading in its grouping and discussion of pica roman fonts (see further comment, note 36 below). Some sources of potential confusion are worth nothing. The frequently referenced "Specimen Charactervm seu Typorum Probatissimorum" (1592) is variously designated by combinations of "Conrad Berner", "Engelnoff", "Frankfurt", and "1592". Similarly, typeface body-sizes are referenced in the English ("pica"), French ("cicero") and Dutch ("mediaan") vernacular terms that appear in extant specimens. Nomenclature cross-reference tables and measurements are found in The 'Fell' Types (p. 260), Phillip Gaskell, A New Introduction to Bibliography (Oxford, 1972) (p. 15), and Low Countries (p. 16). 11 The height of a typeface, as measured from the top of the ascenders to the bottom of the descenders, defined the shortest body that could carry the face. However, a given typeface could be cast on a taller body; the Claude Garamond "cicero" (i.e., pica) punches in the Plantin collection, for example, produced fonts with heights ranging from 80-84mm (see Type Spec. Facs. Vol. II, "Le Be" note 13, p. 14). Similarly, new punches were cut with shortened ascenders and descenders and the typeface cast on a smaller body than originally intended (see Type Spec. Facs. Vol. II, "Folio c.1585" specimens 38 and 45). In one extraordinary instance, a typeface with a bare measurement of 80mm was cast on a body with a 20-line measurement of 67mm without modification of ascenders and descenders (see Type Spec. Facs. Vol. II, "Folio c.1585", specimen 57, and note 57, p. 10). Vervliet does not explain how the type body was modified to make possible the setting of the specimen and other texts. The body of every sort had to have been kerned to allow for the overlapping of ascender and descender lines. 12 In the remaining discussion, I will label specific typefaces, variants and subsets by the printer who used them in combination with an initial that was chosen according to an imperfectly defined convention. The "-Y" was selected arbitrarily for Eld's Y-font as first studied in The Malcontent , then the "-Y" was used to designate the same typeface in other printers' work. The recognition of the second of Eld's typefaces in Sejanus suggested using the first letter of this title for the label in "Eld-S", and so on for other printers using the S-face; similarly, Windet-F was first noted in The Fawne . Lacking the identity of the printer, the short-title of the book and the sheets in which the typeface occurred seemed the logical approach, hence Fools -CDI or Fools -EF. Mixed fonts present a complex problem in that they are combinations of two or more typefaces, and ideally could be described by the printer's name and the label for the faces, as in "White-S+Y", thereby indicating the two faces that were mixed. However, the compromise "-M" for "Mixed" is most expedient until the typefaces in these mixed fonts are isolated and labeled. I rely upon W. Craig Ferguson's labeling of Creede's fonts, although consistency would call for Creede-1S, Creede-2M, Creede-3M, Creede-4S etc. This cumbersome method is necessitated by the fact that we lack seminal specimens of many typefaces that are attributable to specific punchcutters; it was suggested by Paul Beaujon: "by fixing our attention upon the identity of the type [typeface] rather than assigning anything to a definite punch-cutter , we may hope in time to establish a scientific method of approach based on actual evidence rather than rash speculation or (worse) that learned credulity that makes a printed reference a reliable authority. Most of the types [typefaces] to be mentioned cannot be assigned with confidence to any engraver; their labels, for our purposes, may be the titles of the earliest books in which their appearance has been noted," "The 'Garamond' Types", p. 146. I must note that an essential element of the bibliographical description of a font is overlooked in my labeling, namely, its physical size, because of the slant of this paper. Vervliet's discussion of his naming convention should be followed in bibliographical descriptions of the type in a book (see Low Countries , pp. 14-19). I should comment also on my line-numbering system on pages that include titles and stage directions. The line-count begins at the first stage direction, speech prefix or line of text while titling material is ignored; blank lines setting off stage directions etc. are included in the count, although this sometimes presents a problem since the blanks frequently are not equivalent to the height of a line. I use the simple expedient of inscribing a line-scale on self-adhesive labels on one edge of a six-inch ruler and numbering every fifth line. 13 See reproduction, Texts of 'King Lear' (p. 455), and Blayney's attribution (p. 500) of the font to Francois Guyot by reference to the anonymous c.1565 Folger specimen (in Low Countries , R27, Fig. 203; Type Spec. Facs. Vol. I, No. 1) and the specimen of Henry Bynneman's Guyot font in Isaac, Fig. 6. 14 Generally, high quality reproductions are useful for discriminating gross features such as the height difference of S-face vs Y-face capitals and stylistic differences (i.e., diagonal group) between two typefaces, provided the images of the letters are distinct and clear. This preliminary stage of analysis is frequently adequate for concluding that two fonts are not the same. However, precise measurements at high magnification such as are referenced in the following discussion should not be attempted in reproductions. The dimensions cited in the present study were taken in originals at The Huntington Library as follows: width is measured from points dead-center in the letter elements as established by the faint trace of the elements in the ink-blot; height is measured at points 0.025mm from the edges of elements. Angular measurements are taken with a specially designed and produced micro-protractor. Consult a graphics design/production shop with a PMT machine for reducing the camera-ready protractor to a radius of about 0.25-inch on celluloid or other suitable material. 15 The specimens in this monumental work are an extremely valuable resource for bibliographers desiring to become familiar with actual type appearance at high magnification (20X-30X). The edges of the letters are quite distinct; the only drawback is that modern printing technology has eliminated most of the distorting effects produced by early methods of hand-inking with the balls: originals have to be examined to appreciate the impact of that variable. Such crisp inking is rarely encountered in early books, a fact which renders them quite a bit more interesting in typographical study. Since frequent reference will be made to variations in size as a means of distinguishing variants, a tabulation of the Fell pica typeface (see Appendix II) will provide a useful overview of the accuracy that can be expected of a master punchcutter like Garamond while filing steel punches by hand over a period of one to two years, the time necessary to complete the entire set. 16 Bibliographers tend to think of type in terms of the two-dimensional image on the printed page. Several references provide discussions, drawings and photos of the various tools and stages of the type production process which are helpful background for the following discussion. Absolutely outstanding photos of punches and matrices appear in Stanley Morison's The 'Fell' Types , particularly plates 14, 15, 17 and 18, and decorated initials in plate 19, with a detailed glossary of technical terms, pp. 256-259. See also Low Countries for a drawing of the type-casting mold and discussion (pp. 10-11); and Harry Carter, A View of Early Typography (Oxford, 1969), Figs. 2, 3 and 5 for drawing and photographs of a mold, newly cast types, and type-caster at work. 17 A perceptive former graduate student, Mary S. Radigan-Hunter, responded to this possibility: "Of course: the punchcutter had a bad day, missed a few strikes and crushed his left thumb, so naturally he wouldn't be able to hold the punch perfectly perpendicular, would he?" Fournier explains: "It sometimes happens that the matrix has been struck more deeply on one side than the other, the punch not having been continuously held quite upright in relation to it. . . . Striking the matrix needs a steady and practised hand; which has given rise to a saying that 'A matrix well-struck is half-justified'." ( Manuel de Typographique , p. 90). 18 See Fournier's explanation of correcting height-to-paper, Manuel de Typographique , p. 90. The depth of impression obtained during the striking of the matrix was a "judgment call" as Fournier notes that the punch "is beaten in with a hammer as perpendicularly as possible until it has gone in as much as a twelfth of an inch or thereabouts [my emphasis]" (p. 83). See Blayney's explanation of matrix-wobble during casting, Texts , pp. 179-180. 19 Morison defines the justification of a matrix: "reducing it by filing to a true rectangular shape such that, when fitted to a mould, it will produce type with a level face and of standard height for a character that is optically satisfactory for uprightness, alignment, and distance from adjoining characters," The 'Fell' Types , p. 257. When the metal of the matrix was displaced during impact by the punch, the shape of the rough matrix blank was distorted by the vectorial dispersion of the impact force. In simple terms, the sides of the matrix bulged around and beneath the impression of the letter. This can be seen in the clear photo of an unjustified matrix in A View of Early Typography , Fig. 6 (between pp. 8-9). Fournier's explanation of the arduous process of striking a matrix reveals the latitude for errors in judgment and provides a possible insight into why certain letters exhibit sharp-edged elements while others seem rounded or blunted: ". . . with a gentle hammer-blow a shallow impression is made [in the blank]. If the letter is observed to slope either to right or to left, the punch is turned round a little and a second impression is made on the first, and after this a third, the punch being carefully got into the right position. So the place for the strike is gradually found. When at last the punch is shown by the preliminary trials to be in its proper position, it is beaten in with a hammer . . . ." (p. 83). Justification involved correcting the kinds of misalignments referred to in my discussion of miscast letters: "The matrix has to be reduced at the sides until it is of the right width . . . in the case of a letter which ought to be upright but leans a little to right or left through having been struck awry, the matrix must be corrected by being filed down on the side away from which the letter leans. In this example . . . where the h leans to the right, the letter must be corrected by having some of the left-hand side of the matrix towards the top filed away" (p. 93). Low-riding letters are corrected: "the distance between the end of the matrix and the head of the strike [i.e., top of the letter] is too great, and some of it [i.e., end of matrix] must be taken off"; high-riding letters are corrected: "the face of the strike is too short. This is cured by a few hammer-blows upon that end of the matrix to lengthen the copper," thereby lowering the letter on the matrix (p. 93). 20 For example, the fine S2 that seems to lean right (as if the rectangle enclosing the letter were rotated slightly clockwise) and to sit low on the baseline appears in significant proportions in White-M ( LLL , A3:16,21, A3v:2,21,36), and in Creede-3 ( R&amp;J , A4v:26, B2v:29, B3v:19, C1:32, C3:13,31) amidst normal erect-appearing letters, most of which exhibit some form of distorting damage. A very low portion of Eld's 'S' sort seems to lean although they are erect, and all sit correctly on the baseline. It may be that Creede's and White's are actually miscast, but there is no point in pursuing the issue, since they are noticeable just the same. I should note that the preceding discussion has focused upon S-fonts because, in general, Y-fonts seem free of horizontally misaligned capitals with the exception of the low-riding 'C L' in Braddock-Y2 in Book I of Antichrist STC7120. The absence of variant Y-face capitals indicates a single set of seminal punches, with the possibility of duplicate or replacement punches only in the 'S T'. The fact that the capitals are uniformly justified strongly suggests that, if several founders supplied Y-fonts, they purchased their sets of matrices already justified by the same workman. 21 Some comment by Paul Beaujon shocks the industrial-age mind into an awareness of the accomplishment of these craftsmen: "As Garamont himself wrote that he had cut punches and cast type since the end of his earliest childhood, it is possible to credit the unsupported statement of Lottin that he was practising in 1510, though our earliest firsthand news of him comes some thirty years later. It takes fifteen years, say the punch-cutters, to learn to cut a twelve-point g [i.e., large pica]: the smaller sizes are cut by men who have had more practice," "The 'Garamond' Types", pp. 132-133. 22 Normal ſh1: Eld-S, Sej , B1v:21; Simmes-S, Mal Q3, B4:13; Creede-3, R&amp;J Q2, A4v:1, 23; White-M, LLL , A4:13, I1v:21. ſh2: Eld-S, Sej , C3:5; Simmes-S, Mal Q3, A4:13; White-M, LLL , A2:10,15; Field-S, Arte , D4:34; Creede-4, d'Olive , A2v:33; Windet-S, Fawne Q1, E2:18. ſh3: Creede-4, d'Olive , A4:30; Windet-S, Fawne Q1-2, I2:5. 23 In contrast, the cross of the 'e' in early pre-Garamond romans, which the B-face subset in Danter-M resembles (see below), exhibited a upward slant of as much as 24 degrees or so, obviously an intentional stylistic feature. Similarly, the cross of the Le Be 'e' consistently slants upward, while Henry Denham's ( An Apology STC6077 [1566]) slants downward; these variant 'e' definitely derive from two punches, while the S-face 'e' from a single punch. 24 Commas are difficult to work with, given their physical shape and size. Another problem is created by medial vs terminal justification which affects the spacing between a comma and the preceeding letter. See Blayney's discussion, Texts , pp. 179-180. 25 Generally, "obvious to the naked eye" means that the presence of a possible variant can be sensed; however, some form of magnification is always useful in confirming the variant, such as a 3-inch high-quality magnifying glass. Bear in mind that improper orientation of the glass or the viewing angle distorts the viewed image. The AGFA LUPE 8X viewer, a quite useful magnification device designed for examining slides and contact prints, is pocket-portable, inexpensive and can be purchased at most photo shops. The precise resolution that is required for the kind of measurements indicated by the term "high magnification" simply cannot be achieved with "a powerful magnifying glass and a fine scale [ruler]" as one typographer suggested. In the typical steel or plastic ruler calibrated in millimeters, the tick marks are 0.2mm or wider; what's worse, the scale becomes more inaccurate as the lenght increases. Most simple high magnification devices, such as the Radio Shack or the shirt-pocket varieties, invert the image, decrease light about 75%, and distort the image. I use a Wolfe 8x30 Field Microscope with lens extender, an internal scale graduated in 0.05mm, and negligible-light-loss non-inverting optics. Since it took about two years to locate a source for this instrument, I pass along the information: Catalogue #591305, Carolina Biological Supply Company, Burlington, NC 27215 (about $125 or higher, depending upon the dollar-yen exchange rate). 26 A comment by Harry Carter, one of the great scholars of early typography, is worth noting in this context: "Some of the types [typefaces] . . . can be reduced to three or four very diverse elements, more of them than I thought at first. These conjunctions and confusions are material for another, more technical discourse, of interest to people who underrate the difficulty of identifying types [typefaces] by looking at them . . .", "Types of Christopher Plantin", p. 171. 27 I have discussed the inherent deficiencies of reproductions for typographical study in "Reproductions as a Source", see esp. pp. 238-239 regarding some of the factors that distort the image of a type; other problems of textual transmission that undermine the editorial process are detailed in G. Thomas Tanselle, "Reproductions and Scholarship", Studies in Bibliography , 42 (1989), p. 29. A more specific comment about the deficiencies of the reproduction processes upon which scholars rely may be useful at this point, since they vary greatly in their imaging fidelity. In general, regardless of the kind of process, essential information about a typeface is either obscured or lost in reproductions. This is partly due to the fact that the end-product used by the scholar is of at least "twice removed" quality, that is, an original is usually photographed, and this copy is then duplicated for the printing process. Fidelity decreases with each step of duplication. A xerox is a high-contrast image in which lightly inked areas are either cancelled or filled-in, depending upon the density of inking in the original or the adjustment of the machine. Essential information is inevitably lost. The trade-off between the usefulness of a xerox and the damage to the original that results from the duplicating process suggests the ethical principle that direct xeroxing be avoided without exception. If the point to be made is important enough, it will require the examination of an original for final confirmation in any event. When examined in a microfilm viewer, microfilms are virtually useless for typographical study except for sorting out categorical stylistic differences (i.e., roman vs italic typeface). The usefulness of hardcopy produced either with the photoflow (wet) or xerographic (dry) processes varies with the quality of the microfilm itself, of the copying machine, and the reproduction ratio, which is never "actual size". It is frequently impossible to judge the size of a typeface (i.e., 82mm vs 94mm) unless a ruler scale is reproduced along with the book (technicians are extremely erratic in this essential step), but this is useful only for distinguishing between different categories of typeface sizes such as pica (82mm) vs english (96mm), and certainly not for distinguishing fonts within one size range (i.e., an 80mm vs 84mm pica) or measuring 20-line height. Once it has been determined that a font is of a given size such as pica, the usefulness of the hardcopy depends entirely upon the clarity of the images, but it should never be considered an adequate substitute even for high-quality facsimiles. In regard to these, I am not really technically knowledgeable about the actual processes used, but note the following from my examination of the end products. Early W. W. Greg Shakespeare Quarto Facsimiles such as Pericles (No. 5, 1940), and Hamlet Q1 (No. 7, undated), and Shakespeare's 'Titus Andronicus': The First Quarto (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1936) were reproduced by the photographic unscreened collotype method and are of quite high quality; however, at high magnification, the edges of the type-images are fragmented so that details such as nicks and precise locations of bends are lost. The collotype facsimiles vary in quality. Later Greg quarto facsimiles (such as Romeo &amp; Juliet Q2, No. 6, 1949) were screened collotypes with a dot resolution of 0.18mm. Others used considerably finer screened lithographs with a dot resolution of 0.12mm ( Henry V , No. 9, 1957, and LLL , No. 9, 1957). Screened type-images, regardless of dot resolution, do not transmit details of the image between the dots (see discussion and specific examples, "Reproductions as a Source", note 13, p. 258). The Scholars's Facsimiles &amp; Reprints (New York, Gainesville) series varies widely but generally are of poorer quality, as are the hardcopy reproductions from University Microfilms. The Scolar Press Limited (Menston, England) offset reproductions are quite good, as is the Shake-speares Sonnets from the Nottingham Court Press (London, 1984) despite the fact its source is a British Library microfilm. The facsimiles in Shakespeare's Plays in Quarto , ed. Michael J. B. Allen and Kenneth Muir (University of California, 1981) were printed from screened line-negatives (as I understand the note, p. 899) with a dot resolution of 0.18mm; a very interesting editorial decision occurred at the final stage: "To avoid a disjointed appearance on the facsimile page, each Quarto page was overprinted with a faint, uniform, tint block. No loss in image accuracy has resulted [my emphasis], although the book has become easier to use." Numerous sheets such as R3 M1-3v definitely suffered from the tinting. Tanselle comments on the philosophical implications of such editorial modifications of the original in the duplication process ("Reproductions and Scholarship", pp. 30-32). 28 A mandatory exercise for the new typographer consists of recognising the effects of the reproduction process on the transmitted image of a letter by comparing the Fell 'a' with the "CICERO DE GARAMOND" screened facsimile (p. 124; also in Type Spec. Facs. II, "Le Be" specimen 10). The AGFA LUPE 8X magnifier is marginally adequate for this exercise until a proper instrument is obtained. The features of the 'a' samples are quite uniform in the Fell specimen: the pear-tipped fineline shoulder extends beyond the bowl and rises at an acute oblique angle (28 deg.); a top-side medial bend is formed where the shoulder-stroke reverses direction and broadens into the erect back; the long up-curving base-serif symmetrically balances the stressed top of the back; the bowl's top-stroke at 28 degrees produces a high junction with the back and a crimped small counter between shoulder and bowl; the top-stroke curves down to form the left edge of the bowl. A comparison with the "CICERO DE GARAMOND" facsimile reveals that, although some 'a' samples (line 7 "coagulasti") in the facsimile seem to conform to the Fell 'a' traits, the bowl's top-stroke seems more horizontal and shoulder-pear detail is lost in the others. The direction of ink-flow away from the type face and the displaced paper fibers seen at high magnification in an original usually permit detection of such features, which are irretrievable by any means in a reproduction. Next, a xerox of a xerox of the Fell specimen can be compared to the original to appreciate the "twice removed" quality of reproductions. Note particularly the cancellation and fill-in effects; examination of a xerox of the "GARAMOND" specimen reveals how the screened dot pattern is transformed into a solid image. In general, if variant letters exhibit "major" stylistic differences, an analysis of a moderately-large sample in high-quality reproductions can lead to a tentative conclusion that they derive from different punches. For example, Carter and Vervliet trace most (but not all) of the matrices of the "CICERO DE GARAMOND" specimen ("Le Be" 10) to the set of Garamond punches responsible for three other sets of matrices represented in the "c.1585" specimen 38 and "Le Be" specimens 12,13 ("Le Be", note 13, p. 14). A sufficient number of 'a' occur in the four reproductions to reveal such stylistic differences: the shoulder is formed by a symmetrical, tight curve with no medial bend and terminates short of the bowl; the back leans to the right and is frequently bent in at the bowl so that the letter seems to lean right; the bowl's top-stroke curves closer to the horizontal (junction angle of 15 degrees) and joins the back at a lower point, resulting in a larger counter and a more open letter. Although no single 'a' precisely embodies the combination of traits seen in the group of samples, the consistency of the major stylistic differences suggests a different punch. However, an examination of the Le Be 'a' in originals is necessary to confirm these differences and the existence of a second punch (Jean de Tovrnes [Lyons], De la Vie des XII Cesars 1569 [Hn Shelf No. 404078], A4v; Christopher Plantin [Antwerp], B. Svlpicii Severi . . . quae extant Opera 1574, [Hn Shelf No. 388522]). 29 See Gaskell, A New Introduction , p. 38. 30 Blayney's statistics and discussion of the approximate size of Okes's pica font is most informative. See Texts , pp. 145-148. 31 It is interesting to note the use of Eld-Y1 and Eld-S in the former's final appearance in Eastward Hoe! Q3 F3v. The compositor first drew an 'H' and two 'ſſ' ligatures from Eld-Y1 on F3, then switched to Eld-Y1 on F3v. Eld-Y1 apparently was so depleted that substitutions were required with S-face 'k fi ct ſi ſſ A C E M P S'. 32 W. Craig Ferguson notes that Simmes acquired a new font in 1606 which prints all of Eliosto Libidinoso STC13509 except for D3-E4v, the final appearance of the long-lived Simmes-S. He printed only four books in the new font before he "was officially replaced as a printer" in March, 1607. See Valentine Simmes, Printer to Drayton, Shakespeare et al. , pp. 9, 40-41. 33 See W. Craig Ferguson's discussion, "Thomas Creede's Pica Roman", p. 149. 34 Stanley Morison indicates that the set of Fell pica punches, for example, includes later replacement punches in the 'C J N R U W g' sorts: "Their presence in a uniform set of matrices suggests that a strike from Garamond's punches with these additions or replacements was justified in Holland in the seventeenth century" ( The 'Fell' Types , p. 133); the english (96mm) roman matrices were supplemented by punches cut at Oxford c.1688 to produce duplicate matrices in 25 sorts (pp. 144-145). See also Type Spec. Facs. II, "Index 1567", note 26, p. 4. 35 The letters are reminiscent of pre-Garamond early romans, especially in the bold 'e' with the up-slanted cross. These letters provide a better size match than normal S-face letters to the sometimes overwhelming S-face ligatures, especially the gross fl2, apparent ſſ2, and ſt2, which match the height of the tallest capital ('G'). 36 Modern typography benefits from the fact that a Caslon, Garamond or Times Roman letter is easily identified by reference to standard specimens. However, the current state of the history of early typography is a serious obstacle to historical font analysis since only a few early pica roman specimens are known that can be definitely attributed to identifiable punchcutters. The problem of extant specimens in font analysis merits further comment. The most frustrating aspect of working with Elizabethan and Jacobean books is that the published specimens do not match with the typefaces in these books, with few exceptions like Henry Bynneman's Francois Guyot pica font. In general, typographers have long resorted to comparatives such as "very similar to" or "a close copy of" in recognition of the fact that similarities in design, but not precise correspondences, can be detected between specimens and fonts in books. A. F. Johnson deals directly with this practice in "The Supply of Types". I believe that the old, frequently invoked, axiom "the same type can look quite different in the hands of different printers" can be rejected out of hand. The bare measurement of a typeface and individual letter sizes are constant physical facts: precise measurements of letters of a typeface simply do not vary significantly from one book to another or one printer to another. This is obvious from thousands of such measurements: a Y-face 'm' is always narrower than the S-face letter, and always by an amount that hardly varies. Similarly, referring to differences as "a later development in" an identified typeface is legitimate only if it can be shown that the seminal set of punches, or an intermediate set of matrices, is identical except for the differences. Ignoring these basic physical facts leads to nebulous references to typefaces which are a hindrance to font analysis and the bibliographical description of the typefaces in a book. Frank Isaac, for example, notes of the "extremely popular" pica roman: "most of the quarto plays are printed in this size. They were modelled on the 'Cicero de Garamond' of the Berner sheet which is also found in Plantin's Index ," "Elizabethan Roman and Italic Types", p. 89. Isaac groups these typefaces according to the styles of 'g' and 'w' and makes a few supplemental distinctions in surveying the varieties of the two letters used by some 18 printers (e.g., "A w with a short second stem . . . was used in this group by Bishop in 84[mm], Bynneman in 86, Day in 82, Orwin in 82, Purfoot in 82 . . .", p. 90). Isaac's listing lacks references to sample books and dates, a real problem. For example, Purfoot indeed used this 'w' at least from 1570 ( The Hateful Hypocrisy STC10951) in an F-font that by 1579 ( The Forest of Fancie STC4271) had become mixed with an S-font. Determining when Purfoot-Y was introduced needs further investigation, but it does not use the Guyot 'w' and appears in Fawne with Windet-F which does, an occasion for confusion. Beyond that, pica roman fonts simply cannot be grouped according to a few variants. The confusion caused by such a simplistic rationale is apparent when the six pica roman specimens are examined. Henry Bynneman's font (Fig. 6) derives exactly from the Francois Guyot punches that produced the Guyot specimen of the anonymous Folger folio sheet ( Type Spec. Facs. I, No. 1; Low Countries , Fig. 203, p. 268), except that Bynneman's font is cast on an 82mm rather than a 78mm body; the bare measurements of the two match (72mm). Richard Field's and Valentine Simmes's S-fonts (Figs. 8, 9) are stylistically distinct in all respects from Garamond's pica romans. Similarly, John Windet's pica (Windet-F) (Fig. 12) represents a different design concept and scale (the x-line is closer to the h-line) and is closer to faces cut by Ameet Tavernier (see Low Countries , Fig. 206, p. 267). Thomas Orwin's is a mixed font (Fig. 10) with assorted S-face letters; John [Henry?] Denham's font (Fig. 11) combines letters from "Le Be" specimens 12,13 with others probably cut in the Netherlands, but this font needs further study. [I append this brief reference to W. Craig Ferguson's Pica Roman Type in Elizabethan England (Scolar Press, 1989), which arrived too close to press-time to permit detailed comment on what seem to be fundamental problems in approach and documentation. Too many conflicts between this paper and Pica Roman Type occur to permit specific discussion; hence a general statement must suffice. Although my identifications of fonts and printers have been presented in the context of fonts evidence because of the focus of this paper, a fundamental principle has been tacitly followed: identified recurrent types provide the final, absolute evidence of the identity of a font. Hence, my identifications, based upon such evidence, can be trusted to either confirm or supersede those presented in Pica Roman Type .] 37 The combinations of typefaces noted in regard to mixed fonts suggests many hypothetical explanations for the minor variations in same-face fonts. For example, the fonts were purchased at different times from one founder who had replaced certain matrices in the meantime; or from two founders who were supplying type cast in hybrid sets of matrices that differed in but a few sorts; or one of the two printers was forced by circumstances to replenish the ligatures from a founder who supplied only S-face pica type. The Plantin and Le Be inventories of punches and matrices suggest another possibility. Plantin had at least four sets of pica roman matrices from two sets of punches, one by Claude Garamond; the Le Be inventory listed eight sets of pica roman matrices (see Type Spec. Facs. II, "Le Be", notes on specimens 10, 12, 13, 19, p. 14). Secondly, although it illustrates an 18th-century foundry, a woodcut of William Caslon's casting shop shows casting stalls and casters at work along two walls of the room (see fold-out illustration at the front of Talbot Baines Reed, A History of Old English Letter Foundries [London, 1887]). Taken together, these suggest a fundamental economic rationale that could explain the mixing of typefaces either piecemeal or more extensively. A temporary heavy demand for pica roman types could be met by assigning several casters to the task using available sets of pica roman matrices; or, by assigning two casters to high-frequency sorts (a e p etc.) using duplicate matrices not necessarily in the same typeface. I must admit these explanations are purely speculative although attractive. 38 The following examples are based upon my own oftentimes regrettable experiences. Trips to rare books collections inevitably place a premium on time that, at least in my case, often invites short-cuts in methodology that cause later problems. 39 The search process will be discussed in a later paper. Relevant details about this case are as follows. While previously identifying Eld-Y1 in G-K of Whore , I had noted that EF used the large awkward 'W', the Guyot '?' and several other potential discriminants. The completed Fools EF composite demanded a follow-up analysis of EF of Whore and the second edition, The Converted Courtesan . Some Fools EF discriminants emerged in sections of Limbo-Mastix during a survey of other books by Eld, but it is not the same font. Fools EF discriminants were later encountered in books by Simon Stafford and Edward Allde, leading to the former's identification. I had noted some traits of d'Olive EF while analysing Creede-4 in A, B(i), and these suggested the comparison to Fools CD, I. 40 See Fredson Bowers, "The first quarto of 1604 was set up in three sections comprising sheets A-B, C-D, E-K. . . . This final section of the play, E-K, appears to have been machined on two presses, one of which printed sheets E, F, H; and the other, sheets G, I, K" (p. 4) and other discussion of the compositors, running titles and skeletons in the two editions, "Textual Introduction", The Dramatic Works of Thomas Dekker Vol. II (Cambridge, 1955), pp. 3-14. I might note that identifying running titles is a difficult proposition simply because they are set in same-face letters. As I note in "Reproductions as a Source", most of the letters in typical running titles are unidentifiable because of the lack of specific damage (see pp. 242-244); hence, without specific evidence to the contrary, concluding that the same running titles move through a book is based upon an assumption of regularity in compositorial procedures at one press or in one printing shop . Shared printing is inherently irregular in this sense since a minimum of two compositors, two presses, two skeletons and casting-off of copy is required. The confirmation of printing in one shop by a font analysis must, therefore, precede running-title analysis. In the event that two fonts are found together within a single gathering (as in Eastward, Fawne E-I, and d'Olive B), a survey of the printer's work is an additional prerequisite in order to confirm the possibility of simultaneous printing in a two-press shop. (Aside from d'Olive , I am unaware of any instance of two printers' fonts appearing together within a gathering.) Otherwise a dangerous trap ensues when the running titles in sections of a shared book are set in same-face fonts without distinguishing peculiarities such as a distinctive damaged letter or stylistically distinct letters (e.g., italic ' swash-curl-M, swash-P ' in A-D, Granjon ' M P ' in E-I). This is evident in several of the studies cited in note 6, where the same-face running titles of one printer are assigned to another of the printers in a book. 41 Locating low-density foul-case letters such as these is especially tedious. I usually do a minimum of three searches of a text (or texts). One cardinal rule is to note the location when the letter is first detected , since a repeated search is no guarantee that it will be found again. It is worth noting again that non-appearance does not mean that the letter is not in the font. 42 The complementary black letter font was a major source of foul-case punctuation, but I know of no resident fouling with letters from this typeface except for punctuation marks. However, infrequent instances of textual fouling with the black letter 'ye' occur ( Antichrist STC7120 [1603], [2]H3v:32; The Woeful Cry of Rome STC1833, B2:3, B2v:14; Regiment STC1827 [1606], I1:18; W. Craig Ferguson noted 'ye' fouling in Creede-3 also, "Creede's Pica Roman", p. 152). This 'ye' fouling should be viewed as transient fouling resulting from the compositor's justification habit in prose texts, and not as resident in the roman cases. A rather unique kind of textual fouling with a large pre-Garamond roman font occurs in Isle of Gulls (STC6412, 1606), where the left-third or so of F4v:31-39 are set in this oversized Venetian(?) type. Fouling with 'C' occurs elsewhere throughout this section (EF) (F4v:13 etc.). The discovery of this unique font in a signed book would automatically identify the printer, given its rarity in Elizabethan printing. 43 The three styles of italic capitals in use during the period provided obvious discriminants. In the most common, stems and ascenders of the capitals are straight and terminate in serifs (as if a roman face were titled to the right); this style appears in the pica italic faces cut by Robert Granjon (see The 'Fell' Types , p. 139) and Ameet Tavernier ( Low Countries , Figs. 233-234, p. 305). Granjon also cut a second style of italic capitals characterized by extended "swash" strokes. The left stem of the ' A M ' is a long, graceful curve; the bowl-stroke of the ' B D P R ' begins with a swash, the ' G ' terminates in a descender swash, the tail of the ' K Q R ' terminates in a swash below the baseline, the diagonal stroke of the 'N' incorporates both the shoulder and base swash, and the 'E' is like a reversed numeral "3". Both styles are mixed in Eld's, Braddock's, Purfoot's, Short's and other italic fonts. Read's (and Eld's early) font included a variant ' A M ' in which the swash terminated in a curl, fairly common variants. Francois Guyot cut a third style of capitals (see Low Countries , Fig. 231, p. 301) in which the bowl-stroke of the ' B D R P ' begins almost vertically at the x-line to the left of the ascender, the left top-serif of the ' M ' hooks over, and the swash diagonal of the ' N ' extends below the baseline. The Guyot style was less common than the Granjon. 44 G. K. Hunter noted of Mal Q1: "One of the problems of printing The Malcontent seems to have been the very large number of italic Ms required for the names, and this put the printer to all kinds of shifts. But at the beginning of sheet F, and incessantly thereafter we find a new kind of italic capital M [Guyot], which we must assume to have been in one compositor's box but not in the other's. That this M was in Sims's possession is shown by its use in QC [Q3] of The Malcontent and in that part of The Honest Whore printed by Sims," "Introduction: The Text", The Revels Plays: 'The Malcontent' (1975), p. xxxii. Simmes's section (F-H) of Q1 also uses the Guyot ' P ' in large numbers, and both Granjon styles of ' B M P '. Eld's section (B-E) uses the straight-stem Granjon and the curl-swash variants of ' A M ', swash ' B D P ', and what appears to be a few Ameet Tavernier ' M ' (B3v:34, C1:29, C4v:8, D3:32, E2:19, E3:32). The Guyot ' M P ', and the curl-swash ' A M ' and Tavernier ' M ', are exclusive to the two sections of the book (and Simmes's and Eld's sections of Whore as well). Given the number of ' M ' and roman substitutions, the situation suggests two separate printers' fonts rather than two cases, and calls for a survey of a few other books by Simmes to determine whether the letters found exclusively in Eld's sections were ever used by Simmes. Unfortunately, Hunter seems not to have been aware of W. Craig Ferguson's Valentine Simmes, Printer to Shakespeare (1968). 45 I must note the possibility that the replacement of a large portion of the italic font could be responsible for the shift in these sorts. The italic of Q3 prints much more crisply than that of Q1-2, a fact which strongly suggests new type. The difference cannot be noted in reproductions. 46 See Robert K. Turner, Jr., "Printing Methods and Textual Problems in A Midsummer Night's Dream Q1", Studies in Bibliography , 15 (1962), 33-55. The major portion of the study aimed at establishing the setting and distribution sequence by correlating 115 reappearances of identified types with evidence from substitutions. Turner's use of a reproduction for the typographical identifications produced an error rate of 44% which, in combination with my identification of 47 additional appearances of damaged types, discounts his conclusions about the setting and distribution of the text and his interpretation of substitutions; see my discussion of Turner's distributions (pp. 240-242) and the Table of Identifications (pp. 266-268), "Reproductions as a Source". 47 The distribution of foul-case letters deeper into sort boxes or into a different case, or the setting of a text from alternating cases, one of which is not used after a certain point, can only be surmised from the behavior of foul-case letters which, in any event, is random. Although it can be assumed that types in a sort emerge in a "last distributed, first to be reset" pattern, the pattern is merely probable, since a certain randomness is introduced by the order in which pages of a forme are distributed: the last page to be set is not necessarily distributed first. The genuine exhaustion of a sort prior to substitutions would seem to pull all normal letters from a sort box, but in order to establish a real number, the point in the text at which setting from the sort began would have to be established, and that is possible only through an exhaustive identified-types survey to accurately pinpoint distributions. Hence, this discussion of the behavior of foul-case letters ignores the possible effects on recurrence behavior by setting from two cases and by distributions. Nonetheless, distribution factors seem responsible for recurrence in many instances. For example, the damaged 'ſſ' in the 'ſl' sort appears eight times (A2:9,12[text], A5:11, A6:15, A7v:22, B1:20, B4:11, B4v:11, C1:10) in 3H6 but not later in this book in either the 'ſſ' or 'ſl' sorts; seven times in R3 (H3v:28, I4:35, I4v:29, K2:27, L4:4, M1v:21, M3:27); none in 1H4 ; then six in Secretary (F3v:20, I1:25, L3:13, T3:36, Ff3v:8, Gg3v:10). The damaged ligatures were purged and newly damaged ones wrongly distributed in the sequence of texts except for the one which reappears ( R3 , L4:4, M3:27; Sec , F3v:20). It is worth noting that the right shoulder of the foul-case 'ſſ' at Sec I1:25 is not sheared away, but merely bent downward rather severely. This alteration of its appearance was sufficient to occasion incorrect distribution into the 'ſl' sort. 48 Recurrences of Y-face capitals across three gatherings in the verse text of Sejanus : 'S': B3:38, B3v(5), C1v:16,24, C2v:24, C3:10, D1:16, D1v:9,11, D3:2, D3v:2,3; 'T': B2:4,16,20, C3v:14, D3v:28, D4:20,21,30; 'A': B4:31, C2v:24, C4v:17,22, D3v:33, D4:18. Despite the extremely low demand on the sorts in the prose text of Spider , it was sufficient to produce the following appearances in the first gathering of Eld's section: 'S': H1:13[text], H1v:4; 'A': H2:30, H4:29; 'T': H4:20. In addition, new fouling occurs with Y-face capitals in 'F' (H4v:13) and 'G' (H3:4); 'C' also appears later (I1:3). Incidentally, the mixture of S- and Y-face 'I' occurs in both texts. 49 See Sejanus : 'g': B1:32, B1v:6, B2v:9; 'k': B2v:18; 'p': B3v:37. In Spider , the prose text requires a greater number of lower-case letters, but this does not seem to increase the appearance rate of low-density fouled letters: 'g' appears at H1:6[text], H2:28, 'p' at H2:28, but 'k' is lacking until I1:25, I1v:23. 50 I think it fair to observe that consistent performance in the purging of fouled speech prefixes, emphasis names and stage directions (roman capitals with italic lower-case) exhibits no real significance with respect to compositorial skill: the roman capitals preceding 2-10 italic lower-case letters present a minimal challenge, if any. The capitals are almost invariably distributed back into the roman pica cases as numerous compositorial analyses have shown. However, the practice of automatically interpreting roman substitutions (capitals) in speech prefixes irrespective of the italic font's history merits comment. The possibility of fouling the italic cases with roman capitals calls for caution in invariably assuming that substitutions are transient fouling. The S-face 'S' substitutions in Creede's printing of Henry V Q1 (1600) may represent an exception. The ratio of S-face 'S' to italic ' S ' is: D: 4:14, E: 6:17, F: 7:10, G: 0:4. When Creede printed R&amp;J Q2 in the previous year, the italic ' S ' sort set 20 speeches prefixes in A and 10 in B; the first apparent substitution with S-face 'S' occurs at C3:2 in a gathering which used only 8 italic ' S '. Then in Pastor Fido STC12415 in 1601, a single S-face 'S' appears among 24 italic ' S ' in B, and another at K4:15 amidst a few italic ' S '. I am at a loss to explain how the C3:2 and K4:15 appearances could be viewed as substitutions in view of the quite light sort-pressure. Even so, it is possible that Creede's italic ' S ' sort was severely depleted between 1599 and 1600, and then replenished to par by 1601 (or was being used simultaneously in another text). However, resident fouling with S-face 'S' is an equally plausible explanation. A lapse in the compositor's attention cannot be ruled out either, especially in view of the inexplicable shift of the text typeface from roman to italic in most of B4 and parts of B4v in R&amp;J Q2. 51 The density is fairly consistent throughout 3H6 which was printed in eights. Dividing into units of eight pages (equivalent to a quarto in fours) gives the following numbers of black letter queries: 0, 11, 9, 14, 5, 8, 6, 9. The numbers in 1H4 are: 0, 4, 8, 14, 16, 1, 9, 7, 8, 6. In Short's section of R3 (H-M3v): 2, 1, 15, 2, 1. The Y-face and italic query numbers are omitted to emphasize the variation that occurs in R3 , although the pressure on the '?' sort in the three texts is not significantly different. What remains, I believe, is a reflection of compositorial intention either to purge or to tolerate obvious foul-case letters. Since both cases were used to set R3 , Short-Y as a whole was imperfectly purged of the black letter query prior to setting. 52 See MacD. P. Jackson, "Two Shakespeare Quartos: Richard III (1597) and i Henry IV (1598)", Studies in Bibliography , 35 (1982), 173-190. Jackson did not consider the possible connection between foul-case evidence and the cases from which each compositor set his respective section of the text. 53 Foul-case italic T 1 occurs in 3H6 (D5:19, E6v:3?) and R3 (I1:24, L4v:9), but not in the two later texts, suggesting a purging of the text of R3 , but not the cases. The ' T ' in 3H6 and Secretary do not correspond to any seen in R3 with one probable exception ( R3 , L4:26, M2:33; Sec , Ll4v:29). 54 The former may simply skip Fawne in the manner characteristic of low-density fouling. However, the high density of the ' I T ' fouling precludes the possibility that it could skip gatherings or texts. Furthermore, both cases were fouled since the ' I T ' appear in both formes and halves of each gathering A-E. Deliberate purging of large-scale fouling is clearly indicated. The ' I ' in Fawne Q1 C2v(5) and D2v(5) is probably fresh transient fouling. DC was entered 26 June, 1605, and Spider on 4 February, 1606, about six weeks prior to Fawne . Appearances of Purfoot-Y1 italic cluster members: ' B ': DC , C3v:16, D1v:11; Fawne Q1, C4:21. ' C ': DC , D3:24, E4:13, E4v:12; Spider , C4:4; Fawne Q1, C1v:13, Q1-2, D2:10, D3:36. 'G': DC , D2v:14, E1:16; Spider , B3:37, B4v:34, C2v:9, E3v:20, F2v:17. ' L ': DC , A2v:9, B3:21, 25, C1:29, C2:18,20, C3v:15,17, D1v:38,39, D4:12,34; Spider , G1:5, G2: 31, G4v:22; Fawne Q1-2, D2v:34. ' S ': DC , B2:24, B3:3, B4:3, C1:28, C1v:1; Spider , C4v:20, D3v:31; Fawne Q1-2, D2:30. 55 Appearances of common low-density cluster members in Whore : ' C ': D1:5, D1v:37; ' F ': D4v:25; ' G ': C1v:5, D1v:31; ' swash-G ': C3v:13, C4v:7; ' P ': D2:23; ' W ': D2:32,33; Y-face 'M': D4v:31. Appearances in d'Olive : ' C ': B3v:28,30, B4:2,26; ' F ': B1v:30, B2:35; ' G ': A4v:29, B4:17; ' swash-G ': B2:15,27, B3v:15, B4:5; ' P ': A2v:6, B1v:17, B4:21[2]; ' W ': A4v:22; Y-face 'M': A3v:22. Incidentally, Windet-F prints Ee1-Ff4r of Regiment STC1827. 56 Windet-S2 sections: G1:1-8, G1v, G2, G3:1-28 except most of 17-18, G3v, G4, G4v; F1v, F2, F3; E1, E2v, [E3?], E4v. 57 The Fawne was entered 12 March, 1606, five days before Sophonisba , but this does not definitely indicate the order in which the two were printed. In any event, the resident roman fouling is the same in both and was not purged between books. 58 S-face k1: Mal Q2, C3v:24; Q3, I1v:14; Whore , G1:19, G2:18, G4:23, Iv4:8; Fools , A4:14[text], B3:29, G3v:37, K1:7; Eastward , B1v:15, B2:28, C2:4, H2v:11, H2v:35. S-face g1: Mal Q1, B2:16, C4v:28; standing type Mal Q1-2, D4v:16, E4v:11; Q3, H2:24, H2v:10, H3:24, H4:26, I1:34, I2:22, I2v:4,8, I3v:27; Whore , G1:8, G2:18, H1:5, H1v:30, H2:33, I2:6,30, I4v:7, K1:32; Fools , H1:5, H2:28; Eastward , D4v:37, E1:14, E2:5, F3:27, H3v:17,29, H4:33. Expanded S-face x2: Mal Q3, H1:8, I3:29; Eastward , E1:4, F3:20, H4:20. 59 Errors and omissions in the list of the 'k w' appearances noted in "Reproductions as a Source" (note 39, p. 264) are corrected as follows. Windet-F 'k': Q1, E3:8; type k2: Q1, F4v:30, H3:4, Q2, E3v:14, H3:14; both Q1-2: H1v:17, H3v:27, H4:17, I1v:29, I2:23, I3:6. Windet-F 'w': Q1, E2v:8,36; Q2, E3v:11, E4:15; both Q1-2, H1v:17, H3v:27. 60 The recurrence of the S-face A1 in MND Q1 has been noted earlier. The number of appearances (28) of S-face 'A' indicates that replenishment introduced this letter along with the S-face 'H S' (with a few 'Q R V') and 'ſt' to form the S-face cluster in Braddock-Y1. See also later discussion and the Braddock-Y1 Tables in the Appendix. 61 This 'W' also appears regularly in 3H6 (B6v:12,32, C3:15, C5:24, D1:30, D2v:26, E2v:12) but does not seem to occur in 1H4 or Secretary . 62 Spectres was entered 11 January 1605; Fawne on 12 March 1606. 63 The damage is of the kind that a compositor or corrector could not ignore. It is not clear whether Antony Hammond meant to imply a general principle about compositorial behavior in noting that "such types are likely to be noticed by the compositor or proofreader, and discarded rather than distributed," " The White Devil in Nicholas Okes's Shop", Studies in Bibliography , 39 (1986), p. 160. To be on the safe side, it seems wise to take his statement as true of Okes's workmen; it does not apply to every shop. 64 Implicit throughout this discussion is the categorical necessity of the survey as a prerequisite to compositorial and presswork analysis. Unless this principle is clearly understood, the potential for error is limited only by the inferential ingenuity of the scholar who misunderstands or ignores font evidence. For example, an extraordinary sequence of inferences in Akihiro Yamada's "Q1-3 of The Malcontent , and the Compositors" leads to the rhetorical question: "But was it in fact practical to use only one copy [printer's copy] when two compositors were working at different shops, as must be the case with Q3 according to the implication [actually an unqualified conclusion] of Ferguson's statement that the type used in H-I of Q3 is one 'which Simmes is not known to have used'. Or should it be believed, in order to settle this question . . . that this particular type was in fact in Simmes's possession?" (note 14, p. 130). The implicit answer is absolutely wrong. The "tail" of compositorial and presswork analysis, however ingenious and cogent, simply cannot "wag the dog" of a survey of nearly all the books (in the original) by a printer. Ferguson's survey indeed proved that Simmes did not use this type. The extreme improbability that he nonetheless possessed it is disproved by my survey of Eld-Y1 which yielded about 450 appearances of 85 identified types from The Malcontent in a dozen other books by Eld. Such simple facts as are yielded by the survey can, in effect, "trash" studies of printing which overlook font evidence. (I was tempted by insatiable curiosity to tabulate the number of pages "trashed" by the font evidence noted herein, but the thought of adding even one more statistic tipped the scale to pity, leading doubtlessly to a much-deserved mutual sigh of relief). 65 A few of the previous isolated examples can be combined to illustrate the point. Given the fact that both Purfoot-Y1 and Eld-Y1 are used in two-font play-texts 1605-1606 by John Marston ( Fawne, Eastward Hoe ! etc.), a comparison of the two same-face fonts would be the logical first step in determining whether either printer appears in both books. A-D of Fawne exhibit high-level replenishment of upper-case sorts with S-face letters, a foul-case cluster of italic ' B C L S ', both erect and leaning italic query (D4:5), colon and exclamation point (A4v:17), while the Y1-font sections of Eastward show a low-density (foul-case) cluster of S-face 'D E G H K M O P S T g k p x!?', black letter and leaning italic'?', and damaged 'ſſ' ligature in the 'ſl' sort. Or, Windet-S in E-I of Fawne could be compared to Eld-S, since Windet printed Sophonisba , another Marston book. In this instance, the fouling is in contrasting typefaces: Eld-S is fouled by Y-face 'g k y', while Windet-S is fouled by Windet-F 'a k w x y' and 'ſt' ligature as well as italic capitals. One final qualification is necessary in concluding this discussion of the random behavior of wrong-face letters. The fonts have been treated as a whole while ignoring the probability that two sets of cases fed the texts included in the examples. It seems likely that the use of statistical methods for analysing the frequency distributions by pages will distinguish the cases from which texts were set, given clusters of appropriate dimensions. However, more work is needed in this area. 66 Although the group of fonts considered in this discussion represents but a small fraction of the pica roman fonts used during the period, I believe that the cluster phenomena noted in these fonts suggests a definite possibility that two same-face fonts could include clusters with some lower-case duplicate members, although I have not encountered such an instance. The commonness of italic ' I S T ' fouling and wrong-face replenishment in sorts such as 'g k p y' certainly point in that direction. Replenishment of the upper-case suggests a second hypothetical consideration. The progressive replenishment with wrong-face capitals in an increasing number of sorts, for example, could conceivably transform a font with S-face capitals in just a few sorts (Braddock-Y1, 'A H Q R S V') into one with S-face capitals across the upper-case (Purfoot-Y1), given an adequate time interval. This is implicit in the continuum of proportions of normal and wrong-face capitals seen in mixed fonts. 67 See my discussion of the inadequacies of reproductions for typographical study of the kind needed to demonstrate printing from standing type and to identify running titles, "Reproductions as a Source", pp. 242-245. * standing from Whore</field>
      <field name="heading_text">British Plays, 1697-1737: Premieres, Datings, Attributions, and Publication Information by William J. Burling *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scholarship of early eighteenth-century British drama has long been impeded by a lack of basic information: How many original plays or adaptations actually appeared? What were the premiere dates? And who wrote (or might have written) the numerous anonymous plays? The London Stage, 1660-1800 (1960-68) provided substantial information toward resolving at least some of these questions, but I wish to offer major addenda and corrigenda to The London Stage concernings plays definitely or possibly performed in London between ca. 1697 and 1737. I gathered the information through intensive original research and reexamination of existing secondary sources, some of which have never been explored by theatrical scholars. The results are extensive. Most welcome is the identification of perhaps as many as fifteen plays and one oratorio not recorded by the editors of The London Stage , 1 more than doubling the number of "lost" plays "found" since 1968. 2 Of these plays, I have uncovered six pieces. Nine plays and an oratorio I have collected from little-known research efforts by others. Further, I have determined that first mentions of twenty plays currently in The London Stage —which usually denotes premieres or first known performances—are not so indicated therein; I have redated twelve plays and have identified or suggested attributions for forty-five plays; and I have verified the publication of eight performed plays hitherto believed to be unpublished. The findings are arranged in five sections: I. Plays hitherto unknown or believed to be unperformed; II. Unnoted First Performances in The London Stage ; III. New Dating Evidence; IV. New Attributions; V. Previously Unknown Publications. The sources employed for this study are diverse and extensive. Eighteenth-century newspaper advertisements supplied many titles, attributions, and datings. Other information appeared in advertisements in the back matter of some of the several hundred published eighteenth-century play texts which I examined. Memoirs and first-hand accounts were also valuable, particularly John Weaver's little-known The History of Mimes and Pantomimes . 3 Weaver, long the dancing master at Drury Lane, was a knowledgeable insider who has proven to be most informative. I have also found data in the standard play lists from the century, especially those by Whincop and Feales. 4 Among modern sources the most valuable has been the on-line Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue (hereafter ESTC ). 5 Of considerable interest is the emerging importance of musical sources for the identification of theatrical information, particularly the British Union-Catalogue of Early Printed Music (hereafter BUCEM ) 6 and Roger Fiske's English Theatre Music in the Eighteenth Century . 7 As Curtis Price and I have shown in independent studies and as this article hopes further to indicate, published sheet music can strongly imply or establish the existence of many ephemeral theatrical entertainments which were not published in their own right and which can be known from no other source. And the identities of the singers named often can aid in establishing a tentative date of premiere or performance, due to the superb biographical information now available for cross-reference purposes. Further, each entry is keyed to the appropriate volume and page of The London Stage (hereafter often given as LS ).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Plays Hitherto Unknown or Believed to be Unperformed Amalasont, Queen of the Goths, or Vice Destroys Itself (By John Hughes, ca. 1697-1700, Drury Lane; unpublished) Amalasont is listed as unperformed by all sources, but the BUCEM (II, 855) gives two songs composed by Daniel Purcell which imply late seventeenth-or early eighteenth-century performance: (1) "Hence ye curst infernal train. A song in the tragedy call'd Amalasont, Queen of the Goths . . . Sung by Mrs Lindsey" (London: Tho. Cross, ca. 1700); (2) "In a grove's forsaken shade. A song in the tragedy call'd Amalasont . . . Sung by Mrs. Erwin" (London: Tho. Cross, ca. 1697). The editors of The Biographical Dictionary state that Mrs Erwin sang "In a grove's foresaken shade" and indicate that no performances of Amalasont are known, but they do not mention Mrs Lindsey's song. Mrs Erwin's earliest presence on the stage is known from her inclusion in the Drury Lane roster for the season of 1695-96; she disappears until 1699-1700, then reappearing at Drury Lane; no roles are known for her after 1700. 8 The possibility that not only one but two songs from an unproduced play were performed publicly and published with mention of the originating play's title is remote. Virtually all theatre music publication relied upon public knowledge of and possible interest in the play itself. The Lyers (Anonymous, ca. 1701?, venue unknown) Found in a notice on the last page of The Czar of Muscovy (published 1701), this play was printed or said to be printed by Bernard Lintott. Its relationship if any to Mistaken Beauty, or The Lyer (1685) is unclear, and no copy has yet been located. The Tavern Bilkers (Anonymous, 1702, Drury Lane; unpublished) This pantomime and its date are given by Weaver and are also noted by Allardyce Nicoll. 9 In an attempt to confirm Weaver's titles and datings, I have checked the extant issues of the London Daily Courant (the only newspaper containing theatrical notices for this period) to no direct avail. But some clues imply that Drury Lane did not necessarily list afterpieces by title. See, for example, the notices for 2 and 9 January 1717 which describe an afterpiece as "A Mimick-Night-Scene after the Italian Manner," which may well be Weaver's Perseus and Andromeda (1716-17). The Happy Mistakes: or Self-Ruin, Self-Preservation (By Peter A. Motteux, ca. 1703; unpublished) This play is listed but not discussed in Robert N. Cunningham's biography of Motteux. 10 I have found no mention of the play in any source, and Cunningham does not say where he came across the play title. The Happy Mistakes may possibly be a ghost; I thus attribute this play to Motteux only on a "doubtful" status. The Rival Brothers; or, A Fatal Secret (Anonymous, 1704, Lincoln's Inn Fields) Long available in the Readex microcard series and not unknown in major research libraries, The Rival Brothers is also to be found in many contemporary notices and was published (London: Printed and Sold by Ben. Bragg, 1704). 11 The exact premiere date remains unknown. Further identification derives from a song, "In vain malicious fate. A song in the Fatal Secret . . . sung by Mrs Willis &amp; exactly engrav'd by Tho. Cross," BUCEM (I, 307). Very likely Theobald's play of similar title ( The Fatal Secret —4 April 1733, Covent Garden) is not the source of this song: Mrs Willis is known to have performed only at Drury Lane during the season of 1732-33. "In vain malicious fate" does not appear in the printed copies of either play. The Mountebank ; or, The Humours of the Fair (By Peter A. Motteux? 18 January? 1705, Drury Lane) This play was published with Motteux's Farewel Folly (London: James Round, 1707). As Farewel Folly premiered circa 18 January 1705 at Drury Lane ( LS 2.i.85), The Mountebank , if staged at all, may well have appeared on the same program. I cannot determine if this musical interlude is related to The Mountebank ; or, The Country Lass (unpublished, 21 December 1715, Lincoln's Inn Fields). Perseus and Andromeda (By John Weaver, 1716-17, Drury Lane) Weaver claims credit for this unpublished pantomime and provides the date in his History of Mimes . The play is briefly noted Fiske (p. 91) and is apparently related to the later Perseus and Andromeda fad of the 1720s and 30s. See discussion below of Perseus and Andromeda in Part IV. Cupid and Bacchus (By John Weaver, 1719, Drury Lane) This unpublished pantomime is dated and listed by Weaver as his own composition in The History of Mimes . The South-Sea Director (By John Rich, 1720, Lincoln's Inn Fields; unpublished) The title and date of this new pantomime are listed in Weaver, who attributes this entertainment to "Lun," i.e., John Rich. Love and Wine (Anonymous, ca. 1720-22?, Lincoln's Inn Fields; unpublished) This piece is suggested by a song, "Wine's a mistress gay and easy," sung by Richard Leveridge "in the entertainment of Love and Wine," and noted in BUCEM , II, 630. Leveridge sang only for John Rich (at Lincoln's Inn Fields and after 1732 at Covent Garden) from 1714 until his retirement in 1751. Thus a play of identical title listed by Nicoll for 1754 (III.334) cannot be the play from which "Wine's a mistress" derives. 12 The Savage ; or, The Force of Nature (By James Miller, ca. early 1737, Drury Lane; unpublished) A notice in William Havard's King Charles (1737) states that The Savage ; or, The Force of Nature , a comic afterpiece, was performed at Drury Lane and was written "by the Author of the Universal Passion ," 13 i.e., the Universal Passion being a contemporary play by James Miller (1706-1744). Miller's first play is currently believed to be The Humours of Oxford (9 January 1730, Drury Lane), and he achieved his reputation entirely after 1730. The Universal Passion appeared 28 February 1737 and King Charles on 1 March. I have not located a copy; therefore, this play cannot be positively verified. An anonymous play entitled The Savage appeared at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 27 February 1727; no evidence exists to suggest that this is the play by Miller. Robin Hood (1730, Lee and Harper's Great Theatrical Booth, Bartholomew Fair) This ballad opera, found in the William Andrews Clark Library, was "Printed for J. Watts and sold by J. Roberts," 1730. The title page supplies the venue and date. Ridotto al Fresco (By Theophilus Cibber, June 1732, Drury Lane) This afterpiece, written by Theophilus Cibber, is known by a publication announcement in the Gentleman's Magazine , June 1732 (London: J. Roberts), although the only published copy I have seen is "Printed for the Benefit of Richard Cross the Prompter and Sold at the Theatre. 1733." The London Stage (3.i.283) lists and indexes Ridotto al Fresco as the sub-title of T. Cibber's The Harlot's Progress (31 March 1733), but the 1733 text shows that the "Ridotto" section as probably performed in 1732 is simply tacked onto the mainpiece (a theatrical representation of Hogarth's famous print series) and is not dramatically connected to The Harlot's Progress (nor is "the Masque of the Judgement of Paris ," also listed in the concluding performance directions). A song entitled a "grand Comic Ballad" in the "Ridotto" is named in the script, but the lyrics are not provided as was done for the songs in the Harlot's Progress section of the text; perhaps either the publisher or Cibber himself decided that the song need not be reprinted. The Triumphs of Love and Hymen (By Edward Phillips, ca. early 1734?, unstaged?) Probably yet another of the many musical entertainments written in honor of the royal nuptials between Princess Anne, Princess Royal, and the Prince of Orange (15 March 1734), this unpublished masque is alluded to in The Dramatick Sessions (1734). 14 As was the case with the similarly celebratory Aurora's Nuptials (1734), this masque was most likely never staged, although newspaper runs listing theatrical advertisements are incomplete for this season. Performance, if any, almost certainly would have taken place at Covent Garden or Lincoln's Inn Fields: Phillips was John Rich's musical director for these theatres. The Whim ; or, The Miser's Retreat (ca. 1734, Goodman's Fields) The title page of this play, published by J. Watts (London, 1734), states "As it is Performed at the / New Theatre in Goodman's-Fields ." This anonymous ballad opera (termed "A Farce" on the title page) is found in the Readex collection (from a copy in the New York Public Library) and is discussed by Edmond M. Gagey. 15 Jeptha (By Maurice Greene [composer], ca. 1-12 April 1737, King's Theatre) This unpublished oratorio is identified by Otto Deutsch. 16 An exact performance date is not known because newspapers containing theatrical advertisements for this two-week period are not extant, but Greene's piece was apparently presented during Lent in April 1737. Although G. F. Händel prepared an oratorio of identical title in 1757, he had no hand in this 1737 production.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Unnoted First Performances in The London Stage Two principal difficulties exist when one searches The London Stage for play premieres: (1) the first mention of a play may not be the premiere, as exemplified by Susanna Centlivre's The Gamester (1705), for which the first listing is actually the twelfth night of performance; and (2) the first mention of a play may be a premiere but is not so indicated in the London Stage comments. Resolution of some of these problems constitutes the subject matter of this section. Although any user tracking down a specific play in The London Stage may ultimately be able to identify and sort out these inadvertences on the part of the London Stage editors, I present this information as a courtesy, and whenever possible, add new information in an attempt to establish premiere dates. Platonick Love ; or, The Innocent Mistake (Anonymous, ca. 1703?) The known performance of this play is for 24 November 1718 ( LS 2.ii. 516) but is advertised as "Not Acted these Fifteen Years," implying a possible 1703 or earlier premiere. No other play of this title is known, and the title sufficiently differs from Davenant's earlier The Platonic Lovers (1635) to suggest that the 1703 play is not a revival of the 1635 piece. The play is apparently unpublished, and no other information is currently available. The Maid in the Mill (Anonymous, 27 July 1704, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 2.i.73) This new three-act farce version derives from the original Fletcher and Rowley five-act mainpiece (licensed 1623). The new version, which went unpublished, is advertised in the Daily Courant (27 July 1704) as "a Comedy call'd, The Maid in the Mill. Being made into a farce of three Acts." The Unfortunate Couple (Anonymous, 17 August 1704, Lincoln's Inn Fields) The title of this unpublished play is identical to that of one act of P. A. Motteux's The Novelty (May 1697), itself derived from Edward Filmer's The Unnatural Brother (January 1697). The play was advertised (as recorded in LS 2.1.73) as "Not Acted these Six Years," indicating that this performance of 17 August 1704 represents the first known separate performance of the tragedy. The Unfortunate Couple is thus very likely either an adaptation or alteration of one act of Motteux's play. Mock Pompey (31 July 1706, Queen's Theatre) This anonymous, unpublished piece is advertised as "A Burlesque Farce" ( LS 2.i.127). Titus Manlius (4 April 1717, King's) The premiere of this little-known opera is explicitly advertised in the Daily Courant of 4 April 1717 (and for several days earlier) but is not so indicated in The London Stage (2.i.444) and is not recorded in Alfred Lowenberg. 17 The opera is mentioned but not discussed by Deutsch, p. 74; publication was concurrent with the premiere (London: J. Tonson, 1717). The Jealous Doctor (By John Rich, 29 April 1717, Lincoln's Inn Fields) This is an unpublished pantomime ( LS 2.i.448). Harlequin Executed (By John Rich, 10 May 1717, Lincoln's Inn Fields) The details surrounding this unpublished piece are somewhat muddled, but Weaver identifies it as a pantomime by "Lun," i.e., John Rich. The London Stage (2.i.428) first records performance as a dance entitled "Italian Mimick Scene between a Scaramouch, Harlequin, Country Farmer, His Wife, and others" (26 December 1716, Lincoln's Inn Fields); the piece was next presented, again as a dance, as "Harlequin Executed; or, The Farmer Disappointed" on 29 December 1716 ( LS 2.i.428). The increasingly popular diversion finally became a full-fledged afterpiece as noted on 10 May 1717 ( LS 2.i.449). I have assigned the "official" premiere to 10 May 1717 on the grounds that this is the first time that the piece is given full billing status in newspaper advertisements as an afterpiece. This piece indicates the difficulty of establishing genre designations during the early eighteenth century, a problem noted by The London Stage (2.i.cxix). The Unlucky Lover; or, The Merry London Cuckolds (18 July 1717, Drury Lane) This anonymous, unpublished play, apparently a comedy, is advertised in the Daily Courant for 18 July 1717 as "carefully revis'd," implying an earlier premiere ( LS 2.i.457). Any possible relationship to Ravenscroft's The London Cuckolds is unknown. Harlequin Turn'd Judge (By John Weaver, 5 December 1717, Drury Lane; LS 2.i.472) This pantomime went unpublished. The Stage Coach (27 February 1731, Goodman's Fields; LS 3.i.119) This anonymous musical adaptation of Farquhar's afterpiece comedy is advertised in the Daily Post for 27 February 1731 as a new ballad opera. No contemporary published London edition of the adaptation is known, but the NUC lists " The Stage-Coach; opera. As it is acted . . . in Drury Lane " as published in Dublin, 1761. 18 The Throwsters Opera (2 June 1731, Goodman's Fields; LS 3.i.144) This unpublished play is advertised in the Daily Post for 2 June 1731 as "a New Pantomime Entertainment," thus distinguishing it from The Merry Throwster (8 March 1731, Goodman's Fields; LS 3.i.121). The What D'Ye Call It (Anonymous, 11 August 1731, Drury Lane) This adaptation is advertised as a new ballad opera in a puff in the Daily Post for 2 August 1731: "We hear The What d'ye Call it? written by Mr. Gay , is made into a Ballad-Opera , and is now in Rehearsal at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane." The piece duly appeared on 11 August 1731 ( LS 3.i.150) and was advertised as "A Tragi-Comi-Pastoral-Farcical Ballad-Opera. Intermix'd with a Variety of new Songs made to old Ballad-Tunes and Country-Dances." Although no published edition contemporary with 1731 production is known, a piece entitled The what is it? A tragic-comic-pastoral-musical entertainment was published in London by W. Kemmish in 1789, which may represent a later publication of the 1731 ballad opera. The Humours of Billingsgate (Anonymous, 12 November 1731, Drury Lane; LS 3.i.168) Two details suggest that this unpublished play is probably not related to Lacy Ryan's similarly titled The Cobler's Opera; or, The Humours of Billingsgate (26 April 1731, Lincoln's Inn Fields): (1) the change of venue suggests that The Humours of Billingsgate is an entirely different piece, although perhaps a parody or sequel of Ryan's play; (2) the two patent theatres at Drury Lane and Lincoln's Inn Fields drew the line at pirating shows from each other but did not hesitate to steal plays from the unlicensed companies at the Little Haymarket Theatre (as in the case of The Beggar's Wedding (1729), simultaneously pirated by Drury Lane as Phebe ). We may also note in passing that The Cobler's Opera , a popular afterpiece, was always advertised under its main rather than subtitle. The Judgement of Paris (By John Weaver, 6 February 1733, Drury Lane; LS 3.i.269) This dramatick pantomime, with music by Seedo, is based on William Congreve's masque of identical title (1701). The play was advertised in the Daily Post of 6 February 1733 as "a New Pantomime Entertainment." The attributions may be found on the title page of the printed edition (London: J. Tonson, 1733). This entertainment is not to be confused with another and earlier new piece (anonymous) with the same title as presented at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 6 May 1731 and advertised as a "New Pastoral Ballad Opera." The Imaginary Cuckolds (Anonymous, 11 April 1733, Drury Lane; LS 3.i.286) An adaptation of Molière's Le Cocu Imaginaire , this afterpiece ran for four performances. Nothing is known concerning the identity of the adaptor, and the piece was apparently not published. King and No King; or, The Polish Squabble (Anonymous, 1 November 1733, Goodman's Fields; LS 3.i.332) Gagey remarks that this unpublished play was either a farce or a ballad opera afterpiece (p. 185). Harlequin Restor'd, or, Taste a la Mode (By Richard Charke, 12 January 1736, Drury Lane; LS 3.i.543) Loosely based on The Country Revels (1732) but not the same as the play of a similar title for 7 October 1735, this unpublished, new entertainment featured music by Thomas Arne. See BUCEM , I, 448; Fiske, p. 161. The Beggar's Pantomime (By Henry Woodward, 7 December 1736, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 3.ii.621) This is a new ballad opera. See Gagey, pp. 169, 242. Publication took place in London (C. Corbett and W. Warner, 1736). The Mirrour (Anonymous, 26 January 1737, Little Haymarket; LS 3.ii.633) Virtually nothing is known concerning this unpublished "Dramatick Satire." The Mob in Despair (Anonymous, 26 January 1737, Little Haymarket; LS 3.ii.633) No information has appeared concerning publication or attribution of this farce afterpiece.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. New Dating Evidence Dating plays performed before the advent of regular newspaper advertisements is difficult and tricky. Two methods however, provide researchers with new possibilities. The first derives from the fact that plays were routinely published only after performance. As Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume have shown, 19 the time between premiere and publication during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuies was usually a month; thus, while we cannot be precise as to day, we can approximate the month. The second method, similar to Milhous and Hume's, is based on the publication of music from a play, rather than the play proper. During 1695-1720, for example, John Walsh, an established musical publisher, published songs typically within two to four weeks after the premiere. 20 Other musical publishers followed a similar pattern. Caution must be employed in deriving dates from collections , however, as they could be composites of songs from much earlier plays. Xerxes (By Colley Cibber, March-April 1699, Lincoln's Inn Fields) A small item of Colley Cibber material in the Folger Library (MS y.d. 23 [188a]) in a late-seventeenth hand states, "Xerxes, as it is acted at the New Theatre. Cibber publ. Tr. Apr. 28. 1699." 21 Therefore, extrapolating on the basis of Milhous and Hume's theory, the play probably received its first performance in late March or early April 1699 rather than in mid-February 1699, as currently conjectured in The London Stage (1.508), although a February premiere (or earlier) is not out of the question. The Mad Lover (Anonymous, February-March 1701, Lincoln's Inn Fields) No information was available to Curtis Price (1977) to suggest a firm date for the premiere of this unpublished, early eighteenth-century "operatic" adaptation (which is not listed in The London Stage ) of Fletcher's original (1617). Lucyle Hook's research reveals, however, that eight of the songs were published by Henry Playford in the January-February 1701 issue of Mercurius Musicus , 22 and I have seen them advertised for publication by John Walsh in the Post-Boy for 27-29 March 1701. These publications thus indicate a premiere of December 1700 or possibly earlier. One other piece of evidence supports such dating: Acis and Galatea , a masque within The Mad Lover , was published in 1701 (London: R. Parker and H. Newman). A Cure for Jealousie (By John Corye, ca. April 1701, Lincoln's Inn Fields) This play is listed in The London Stage (1.520) as having premiered in 1699, but publication (London: Richard Harrison, 1701) is now known to have taken place by at least 27 May 1701 as evidenced by a publication notice in the Post-Man of that date. Although a 1699 premiere is not entirely ruled out, the 1701 publication in that case would be unusually late; the more plausible date of premiere is usually closer to the date of publication. 23 The Comical Gallant (By John Dennis, ca. late 1701, Drury Lane) Dennis' play is assigned by The London Stage to May 1702 (2.i.19), but Paisible's airs for this comedy were advertised in the Post-Boy for 11-13 December 1701, pushing the date of premiere back at least to early December and possibly even earlier. The play was published (London: A Baldwin) by 19 May 1702 according to The London Stage entry. Vestal Virgin (By Sir Robert Howard, ca. 1692-1702) Not known to have been performed after 1664, 24 the play was republished as part of Sir Robert Howard's Five New Plays in 1692, and the music is listed in a Walsh catalogue for 1703 (Smith, p. 43), suggesting a revival sometime between 1692 and 1702 not currently known. This evidence is only suggestive; Walsh's catalogue was a compilation. Still, performance records for the 1690s and early 1700s are so meager that the possibility of a revival is not ruled out. Edward III (By William Mountfort?, ca. 1702) The last known performance is 1691, 25 but the airs in the play were published in Harmonia Anglicana for 1702 suggesting a revival during that year. Cf., Fiske, p. 592. The Patriot (By Charles Gildon, ca. November 1702, Drury Lane) Gildon's play is currently assigned by The London Stage (2.i.29) to December 1702, but the airs in the play were advertised in the Post-Man for 28 November-1 December 1702, indicating a premiere in late October or early November 1702. The LS entry states that the play was published (London: William Davis and George Strahan) by 18 December 1702. Acis and Galatea (By John Eccles and P. A. Motteux, ca. 1703-05?, Drury Lane) This musical afterpiece is a section of an early eighteenth-century adaptation of Fletcher's The Mad Lover (1617; see discussion above). The 1701 edition of Acis and Galatea (London: R. Parker and H. Newman) 26 apparently led Winton Dean (p. 153) to conclude that the play had received separate performance that year; the first LS date, however, is 11 December 1702 (2.i.29). The confusion over the origins of this play is resolved by Hook's Introduction to her Augustan Reprint facsimile edition of Acis and Galatea ; she establishes that earliest performance of the masque (within The Mad Lover ) took place ca. November or December 1700 (p. v). When the afterpiece began to be played alone is currently not known, but performances may well have started not long after the newly adapted The Mad Lover was dropped from the repertory (after 1702?). The Gamester (By Susanna Centlivre, ca. January 1705, Lincoln's Inn Fields) The earliest verified date for Centlivre's comedy is for the twelfth performance: 22 February 1705 ( LS 2.i.88). The music, however, was advertised in the Post-Man for 30 January-1 February 1705, and the play itself was published 9 February 1705, as announced in the Daily Courant for that date (London: William Turner and William Davis). Both publication dates suggest a premiere in late December 1704 or early January 1705. The Siege of Troy (Anonymous, Fall 1707 or earlier?, Bartholomew Fair) This play has been known previously only by a performance of 5 September 1715 ( LS 2.i.365), but a copy of the printed text in the Huntington Library dated 1707 (London: B. Bragg) announces performance at "Mrs Mywn's Booth" at Bartholomew Fair. Further, printed comments in the 1707 copy state that it is reset from yet an earlier (currently unlocated) edition dating from 1703. The ESTC attributes this play to Elkanah Settle, indicating that it is an adaptation of Settle's The Virgin Prophetess (Drury Lane, 12 May 1701). Comparison of the two plays, however, reveals no similarity. 27 The Richmond Heiress (By Thomas Durfey, ca. 1708, Drury Lane) Two related pieces of evidence suggest a 1708 revival of this Durfey comedy (1693). Songs from the play as sung by Pack and Mrs Hudson were published ca. 1708 (see BUCEM , II, 889-890); and The London Stage entry (2.i.317) for a revival of this play on 2 March 1714 records the advertisement as stating "Not Acted these Six Years." Thus the play very likely was revived sometime during 1708, probably either between January and May or in October or November, the two segments of the year during which new plays and revivals most often appeared. The Disappointment (By Henry Carey, ca. 1732, Little Haymarket) This play has hitherto been known only by a unique performance at the York Buildings, 8 July 1734 ( LS 3.i.405). The title page of the printed edition (London: S. Slow, 1732, in the Readex collection), however, states that it was performed earlier at the Little Haymarket Theatre. (See below, Part IV, for discussion of attribution.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. New Attribution Evidence The Beau Defeated (ca. mid-March 1700, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 1.526) Nicoll (II.349) and the editors of the Annals assign this comedy to Mary Pix. 28 "Whincop," however, attributes the play to one "Barker" (p. 169). The play was published anonymously (London, 1700?). The Gentleman-Cully (August 1701, Drury Lane) The London Stage (2.i.12) and many other sources give Charles Johnson as the author of this comedy, but a convincing case is made against Johnson's authorship by Maurice Shudofsky, Modern Language Notes , 55 (1940), 396-400. The play was published (London: A. Bettesworth &amp; R. Wellington, 1702). The Stolen Heiress (31 December 1702, Lincoln's Inn Fields) Susanna Centlivre is identified as the author in The London Stage (2.i.30), but Tom Brown states in "A Criticism on Modern Plays, being a Continuation of Mr. Congreve's Essay upon Comedy, in a Letter to Mr. Dennis" (volume IV in Works [1707-09]), "For no sooner was Swansen hang'd for stealing an Heiress, but out sends Mrs. Pix a play call'd The Stolen Heiress stolen from an old play call'd The Heiress " (237). 29 The published edition (London: William Turner and John Nutt), advertised in the Post-Boy for 16 January 1703, provides no clues. A Woman Will Have Her Will (24 February 1713, Drury Lane) The author is unknown (see LS 2.i.296), and the play is apparently unpublished. The music as composed by John Eccles did see print. See BUCEM , I, 310. The Bulls and Bears (2 December 1715, Drury Lane; LS 2.i.379) Evidence from Breval's The Confederates (1717) and the anonymous The Stage-Pretenders (1720) strongly suggests that this unpublished afterpiece is by Colley Cibber. 30 The Loves of Mars and Venus (2 March 1717, Drury Lane; LS 2.i.439) John Weaver states in The History of Mimes that this piece is his own. The pantomime was published (London: W Mears and J. Browne, 1717). The Jealous Doctor (29 April 1717, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 2.i.448) "Lun," i.e., John Rich, is the author identified by Weaver. The piece went unpublished. Harlequin Executed (10 May 1717, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 2.i.449) Weaver also assigns this unpublished pantomime to "Lun," i.e., John Rich. Harlequin Turn'd Judge (5 December 1717, Drury Lane; LS 2.ii.472) John Weaver states in his History that this pantomime is his own. Nicoll asserts 1717 publication (II.374), but I have been unable to locate a copy. Amadis (24 January 1718, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 2.ii.480) This is another unpublished pantomime by "Lun," i.e., John Rich, according to Weaver. Christopher Rich, however, may have coauthored the piece: the Daily Courant for 7 February 1718 advertises that evening's performance as an author's benefit; and "Rich's Register" (as reported in LS 2.ii.481) for this date lists John and Christopher Rich as the recipients of the benefit. The Lady's Triumph (22 March 1718, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 2.ii.488) The title page states that "E. S." is the author, whom Nicoll (II, 354) identifies as likely being Elkanah Settle. The play was published (London: J. Browne and W. Harvey) as advertised in the Daily Courant for 16 May 1718. No Fools Like Wits (10 January 1721, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 2.ii.608) Presently assumed to be an alteration of Thomas Wright's The Female Virtuosos (May, 1693), 31 this play, according to Whincop, was actually a new adaptation done by John Gay (p. 185). The play's twisted publication history is yet to be sorted out. The Escapes of Harlequin (10 January 1722, Drury Lane; LS 2.ii.657) John Thurmond is identified by Weaver as the author of this unpublished pantomime. Jupiter and Europa; or, The Intrigues of Harlequin (23 March 1723, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 2.ii.715) "Lun," i.e., John Rich, is the author identified by Weaver. J. E. Galliard, Cobston, and Richard Leveridge were the composers. See BUCEM , I, 201; Fiske, p. 79. The pantomime is apparently unpublished. It Should Have Come Sooner (30 July 1723, Drury Lane; LS 2.ii.731) Mentioned by Francis Hawling as his own in his Preface to The Impertinent Lovers (1723). Cf., Nicoll, II, 335. This play was not published. The Union of the Three Sister Arts (22 November 1723, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 2.ii.745) J. C. Pepusch was the composer. The play text was unpublished, but the music saw print. See BUCEM , II, 768. Harlequin Doctor Faustus (26 November 1723, Drury Lane; LS 2.ii.746) John Thurmond has long been known as the author, but Fiske's evidence (p. 75) now shows that Barton Booth was a co-author and Henry Carey the composer. The play was published (London: W. Chetwood, 1723). The Necromancer; or, Harlequin Doctor Faustus (20 December 1723, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 2.ii.751) "Lun," i.e., John Rich, is identified as the author by Weaver. The music as composed by J. E. Galliard was published (see BUCEM , I, 288), and an "Exact Description" of the pantomime appeared in 1724 (London: T. Payne). Harlequin Sheppard (28 November 1724, Drury Lane; LS 2.ii.797) Fiske (pp. 75, 90) identifies Henry Carey as the probable composer. The pantomime was published (London: J. Roberts and J. Dodd, 1724). Harlequin a Sorcerer: With the Loves of Pluto and Proserpine (21 January 1725, Lincoln's Inn Fields) Fiske suggests J. E. Galliard as the composer (p. 75). The LS entry (2.ii. 806) attributes the pantomime to Lewis Theobald, but Weaver states the play is by "Lun," i.e., John Rich. The piece was published in 1725 (London: T. Wood). Apollo and Daphne; or, Harlequin Mercury (20 February 1725, Drury Lane; LS 2.ii.810-11) The edition of 1725 (London: J. Dodd) states that John Thurmond is the author, Richard Jones and Henry Carey the composers. Apollo and Daphne; or, The Burgo-Master Trick'd (14 January 1726, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 2.ii.850) Fiske (p. 75) identifies Lewis Theobald as the author and J .E. Galliard as composer. The pantomime was published (London: T. Wood, 1726). The Miser; or, Wagner and Abericock (30 December 1726, Drury Lane) John Thurmond is noted as the author in the LS entry (2.ii.900), but Fiske (p. 75) identifies Richard Jones as the composer. Publication took place in 1727 (London: W. Trott). The Rape of Proserpine (13 February 1727, Lincoln's Inn Fields) Conflicting attributions: The London Stage (2.ii.908) gives Lewis Theobald, but Weaver states "Lun," i.e., John Rich, was the author. Fiske (p. 75) states that J. E. Galliard composed the music. Published in 1727 (London: T. Wood). The Provok'd Husband (10 January 1728, Drury Lane; LS 2.ii.954) The authors have long been known as Sir John Vanbrugh and Colley Cibber, but we now know that Henry Carey was the composer, according to music published as listed in BUCEM , II, 164. The play was published by J. Watts (London, 1728). Penelope (8 May 1728, Little Haymarket; LS 2.ii.975) John Mottley was the author, as given in the LS entry (2.11.975). Thomas Cooke is now known as the composer as identified in BUCEM , II, 768. This "dramatic opera" was published (London: Tho. Green, 1728). The Quaker's Opera (24 August 1728, Bartholomew Fair; LS 2.ii.985) This ballad opera is attributed to Thomas Walker by Whincop (p. 299); cf., Nicoll, II, 363. The piece was published (London: Printed for J. W. and sold by J. Roberts, A. Dodd, and E. Nutt and E. Smith, 1728). Perseus and Andromeda (15 November 1728, Drury Lane; LS 2.ii.998) Fiske states "The managers . . . reengaged Weaver to revise what he had created, without notable success, in 1717. In fact Weaver revised only the 'grotesque scenes,' leaving the serious ones to 'Mons. Roger'" (p. 91). The title page of the published text confirms Fiske's attribution assignments (London: W. Trott, 1728). Love in a Riddle (7 January 1729, Drury Lane; LS 2.ii.1006) Fiske (p. 597) suggests Henry Carey as the composer of this "pastoral" authored by Colley Cibber. Publication by J. Watts (London, 1729). Damon and Phillida (16 August 1729, Little Haymarket; LS 2.ii.1042 32 ) Henry Carey was possibly responsible for this adaptation of Cibber's Love in a Riddle . See Burling, "New Light on the Colley Cibber Canon," PQ , 67 (1988), 121-122. This afterpiece was published (London: J. Watts, 1729). The Clown's Stratagem (18 May 1730, Drury Lane; LS 3.i.61) An advertisement in the Daily Post states that this play is "Written by the Author of the Contrivances," i.e., Henry Carey. It went unpublished. Wat Tyler and Jack Straw (20 August 1730, Bartholomew Fair; LS 3.i.74) or Wat Tyler; or the State Menders (19 January 1733, Drury Lane; LS 3.i.265) Sir Robert Henley is named as the author of Wat Tyler in The Dramatick Sessions (1734), p. 6. Whether this ascription refers to Wat Tyler and Jack Straw or to Wat Tyler; or the State Menders is unknown. Neither play was published. Cephalus and Procris (28 October 1730, Drury Lane) Roger is the author given in the LS entry (3.i.88), but BUCEM (I, 163) now gives us Henry Carey as the composer. Publication by J. Watts (London, 1733). The Devil of a Duke (17 August 1732, Drury Lane) Robert Drury is given as the author in the LS entry (3.i.226), but Seedo is now identified as the composer according to a notice on the last page of The Fancy'd Queen (1733). This afterpiece was published (London: Charles Corbett and John Torbuck, 1732). A Wife Well Manag'd; or, Cuckoldom Prevent'd (17 August 1732, Totten-ham Court; LS 3.i.227) This unpublished play is attributed to Henry Carey by Whincop (p. 185), but the title suggests that it may be a revival of Susanna Centlivre's farce, A Wife Well Manag'd , presented at the Little Haymarket 2 March 1724 but published in 1715 (London: S. Keimer). The Disappointment (1732, Little Haymarket) "John Randall," is a pseudonym for Henry Carey. See F. T. Wood, "The Disappointment," Review of English Studies , 5 (1929), 66-69. Earliest performance given in LS (3.i.405) as 8 July 1734, but see discussion above in Part III for redating to 1732. The play was published by S. Slow (London, 1732). The Judgment of Paris; or, The Triumph of Beauty (6 February 1733, Drury Lane; LS 3.i.269) John Weaver was the author and Seedo the composer as stated on the title page of the printed edition (London: J. Tonson, 1733). See further discussion above in Part II, "Unnoted First Performances." The Stage-Mutineers (27 July 1733, Covent Garden; LS 3.i.310) This play was written by Edward Phillips, who is given as the author in a list appended to Marivoux's La Paysan Parvenu (1735) as cited by Gagey (pp. 168, 234 n7). The play was published by R. Wellington (London, 1733). Seramis (30 October 1733, King's; LS 3.i.331) Deustch (p. 335) established that the libretto was by Pietro Metastasio with recitatives by G. F. Händel. Most of the music for this pasticcio was composed by Antonio Vivaldi. This opera was apparently unpublished. The Happy Nuptials (12 November 1733, Goodman's Fields; LS 3.i.336) Henry Carey was the composer, but the identity of the librettist remains unknown. This play was extensively revised and revived as Brittania, or, The Royal Lovers (11 February 1734, Goodman's Fields). See BUCEM , I, 163; Fiske, p. 173. This musical entertainment was published (London: Printed by H. W., 1733). 33 Cupid and Psyche (4 February 1734, Drury Lane; LS 3.i.365) The author is unknown, but the music was composed by J. F. Lampe. See BUCEM , II, 591; Fiske, pp. 160-61. This pantomime was published (London: J. Watts, 1734). Squire Basinghall (23 July 1735, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 3.i.502) This unpublished afterpiece was advertised as "Written by the Author of the Comedy" on the same bill, i.e., The Stage-Mutineers , the mainpiece with which it appeared. Thus the author would be Edward Phillips. (See discussion above for The Stage-Mutineers. ) The Royal Chace (23 January 1736, Drury Lane; LS 3.i.546) J. E. Galliard was the composer according to BUCEM , II, 905. This "dramatic entertainment" was published by T. Wood (London, 1736). The Beggar's Pantomime (6 December 1736, Lincoln's Inn Fields) The London Stage (3.ii.621) does not indicate that this pantomime is the work of "Lun, Jr," i.e., Henry Woodward, as noted by Gagey (pp. 169, 242) and so listed in the NUC. Publication by C. Corbett and W. Warner (London, 1736). Hymen's Triumph (1 February 1737, Lincoln's Inn Fields; LS 3.ii.635) Fiske (p. 91) lists Richard Jones as the composer (author unknown). This afterpiece was apparently unpublished.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">William Robinson, Contributor to Fielding's Champion by Frederick G. Ribble *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The author of the "Advertisement" prefaced to the collected edition of the Champion (London, 1741) mentions four contributors to that journal as especially worthy of note: all the Papers distinguish'd with a C. or an L. are the Work of one Hand; those mark'd thus ** or sign'd Lilbourne, of another. . . . The Letters subscrib'd Janus the Elder, are owing to a Third. The Trials of the Coxcombs, Male and Female, as likewise the Dissection of a Head and Heart to a Fourth. And the Remainder to various Correspondents . . . . (A6 v ) It has long been known that the first two sets of signatures distinguish the work of the two editors of the Champion , Fielding and James Ralph, but the identity of the last two authors has remained obscure. The identity of "Janus the Elder" (later to be joined as a contributor by a physical or spiritual son, "Janus the Younger") 1 may never be determined. It is, however, possible to identify the fourth of these contributors, the author of the " Trials of the Coxcombs " and the " Dissection of a Head and Heart " as well as of several other pieces in the journal. In 1755, a volume was printed at London, without name of publisher, entitled Essays. Written by Mr. Robinson . 2 An explanatory "Advertisement" appears on the verso of the title page: The following ESSAYS having met with a favourable Reception on their first Appearance in the Champion , a Paper long supported with Wit, Humour, and Satire, by the late Henry Fielding, Esq; and others, they are now printed together at the Request of several of the Author's Friends. This volume contains fifteen essays, at least eight of which were reprinted from the Champion : Essays I and II (the " Trials of the Coxcombs "), signed "Morpheus," reprinted from Champion Nos. 63 and 71 (8, 26 April 1740); Essay III (the " Dissection "), signed "Somnus," reprinted from C78 (13 May 1740); Essay IV, signed "Somnus," reprinted from C92 (14 June 1740); 3 Essay V, signed "W. R.," reprinted from C102 (8 July 1740; unsigned in original issue); Essay VI, signed "Morpheus," reprinted from C113 (2 Aug 1740); Essay X, written in character of "Will. Wrangle," reprinted from C386 (6 May 1742); and Essay XII, signed "Morpheus," reprinted from C409 (29 June 1742). The first six of these essays appeared during Fielding's association with the Champion . Three more of the essays in this volume (Essays VIII, IX, and XI) were probably published in the Champion , although in issues no longer extant. Essay XI, in fact, is announced in C387 (8 May 1742) as to be "published in our next," an issue that does not survive. Although Essay VI, a vision of the Palace of Lust, is published in C113 (2 Aug 1740), Essay VII, the conclusion of this vision, does not appear in C114-158 (5 Aug-15 Nov 1740) and seems to have been rejected. The collection ends with three essays not reprinted from the Champion . 4 "Mr. Robinson" identifies himself more fully in the text of the Essays as " William Robinson of the Inner-Temple, London , Gent." We also learn that his wife Anne and at least two of his children were buried at St. Mary's, Willesden, Middlesex; and that Anne died in childbirth on 20 October 1753, aged 43 ( Essays , pp. 85-86). This information, though, is not as helpful as it might appear. Robinson is not mentioned, as far as I have been able to determine, in either the published or the extant unpublished records of the Inner Temple. 5 And, although the St. Mary's parish register contains burial entries for several members of Robinson's family in the period January 1749/50 to September 1754, any previous or later connection of Robinson with that parish has been impossible to trace. 6 More helpful are certain documents in the Public Record Office and Law Society Library which clarify Robinson's connection with the Inner Temple and contain at least one example of his signature. Robinson, we discover, was Essay No. Original Champion No. Champion Date Signature Dated from I C63 8 Apr 1740 Morpheus Inner Temple II C71 26 Apr 1740 Morpheus Inner Temple III C78 13 May 1740 Somnus Gray's Inn IV 3 C92 14 Jun 1740 Somnus Gray's Inn V C102 8 Jul 1740 unsigned in orig.; signed W.R. in Essays Inner Temple VI C113 2 Aug 1740 Morpheus Otterspool VII (conclusion of VI) probably rejected Morpheus Otterspool VIII not in extant C issues Will.

Wrangle Inner Temple XII C409 29 Jun 1742 Morpheus Otterspool XIII not reprinted from C Hymen Inner Temple XIV not reprinted from C ---- Newmarket XV not reprinted from C Funereus Gray's Inn not actually a member of the Inner Temple but a solicitor and attorney who merely had chambers there. His signature appears on an assignment of Articles of Clerkship dated 4 August 1758. 7 There is only one marriage of a William Robinson and a woman named Ann(e) listed in Boyd's Marriage Index, London/Middlesex section, for the period involved: that of William Robinson, 34, of St. Dunstan in the West who married Ann Byard at St. Gregory by St. Paul on 4 May 1746. The signature of William Robinson of the Inner Temple on the assignment of Articles of Clerkship mentioned above matches exactly William Robinson's signature on the Robinson-Byard marriage allegation. 8 This identification is further supported by the fact that in 1749 William Robinson of the Inner Temple took a clerk with the surname Byard (PRO. IR1/18, fol. 192). Since, as Mr. M. J. Wood of the Society of Genealogists points out, the name Byard was an uncommon one, it is quite likely that this clerk was a relation of Ann Byard's. We may say with certainty, then, that William Robinson of the Inner Temple was the William Robinson who married Ann Byard in May 1746. 9 If Robinson gave his age correctly on the marriage allegation, he would have been born sometime between May 1711 and May 1712. He was of St. Dunstan in the West at the time of his marriage; perhaps he was the William Robinson, son of William and Mary Robinson, born 25 March 1711 and baptized at St. Dunstan in the West on 5 April 1711, 10 although in that case his age should have been 35 on 4 May 1746. The last date Robinson is known to have been alive is 4 August 1758, the date of the assignment of Articles of Clerkship mentioned above. 11 William Robinson of the Inner Temple, the contributor to the Champion , is not to be identified, I believe, with William Robinson the attributed author of a play entitled The Intriguing Milliners and Attornies Clerks , although the circumstantial evidence for such an identification may initially seem rather strong. The play was published, with miscellaneous poetry, London, 1738 (for 1737); and separately, London, 1740. Both editions are anonymous. The attribution, which is found in the British Library Catalogue and in other bibliographical sources, is based, almost undoubtedly, on a penciled inscription in the British Library copy of the second edition (shelf mark: 11775.a.18): "By William Robinson / Attorney at Law / Kirkland / Hill Top [?in] [?H]ay Westmorland." Since Kirkland has long been considered a part of Kendal, Robinson is referred to in these sources as "Robinson of Kendal." 12 The author of this play was, apparently, an attorney's clerk and later an attorney. The central character, Will. Dashwell, an attorney's clerk with whom the author identifies, gives his address as "Inner Temple" ( Intriguing Milliners , 1738 ed., p. 39). The author, like William Robinson of the Inner Temple, was an imitator of Fielding; the play is modeled not only on Fielding's Intriguing Chambermaid but also on his Covent-Garden Tragedy . The name William Robinson, however, was a very common one in this period, much more common, in fact, than might first be imagined. According to the inscription in the British Library copy, William Robinson of Kirkland was an attorney living and practicing in Westmorland, presumably by the 1740's. It is clear, indeed, that he had strong connections with the North of England at least by the late 1730's when he wrote and published his play. 13 William Robinson of the Inner Temple, on the other hand, spent his entire life, as far as we know, in and around London. 14 The personalities and interests of these writers, moreover, seem very different. The author of The Intriguing Milliners has a certain cheeky irreverence for social convention and a strong love of bawdry. William Robinson of the Inner Temple, by contrast, is very much a gentleman, a somewhat sententious writer who presents himself quite seriously, as late as August 1740, as a "Youth of [a] moral Turn" (C113 [2 Aug 1740], 1/3; Essays , p. 40). It would be a mistake, then, I believe, to identify William Robinson of the Inner Temple with William Robinson of Kirkland, the putative author of The Intriguing Milliners . Now that we have established Robinson's identity, I would like to con-sider briefly his work itself. Robinson was a specialist in writing dreamvisions, as his pseudonyms "Morpheus" and "Somnus" attest. As far as can be determined from surviving issues, he was the chief contributor of dream-visions to the Champion , other than Fielding himself, during Fielding's association with that journal. In his essays, including those few which are not dream-visions, Robinson writes, with some shrewdness, of the vanity and effeminacy of the beau monde , the perniciousness of French fashions, the ignorance and venality of politicians and pettifoggers. His style, although little more than an imitation of Fielding's, is spirited, and the short "characters" he draws (such as Sir Alamode Toupèt in C63 or Miss Trifle in C71) have a certain life. Several of the essays are dated from "Otter's-Poole," or Otterspool, Hertfordshire. 15 Robinson's depiction of this watering-place reveals a love for the country and sense of local color very refreshing in a journal so dominated by politics and London social life as the Champion : Tir'd with the Noise, Vanity, and Impertinence of the Town [he writes], I had an Inclination yesterday to steal privately into the Country for two or three Days, and accordingly, in the Cool of the Evening, took a Ride to this favourite rural Retreat , where I was welcomed by a thousand Nightingales: As soon as I had alighted from my Poney, I took a Turn amongst the Strawberries in the great Wood, and from thence into the Pool ; with which being extremely refreshed, I retir'd to my Room, and Nancy having brought me a Pint of Mead (for I can't drink any Thing strong) and a Paper of Tobacco, I lighted my Pipe. . . . (C409 [29 June 1742], 1/1; Essays , p. 67). Another attractive characteristic of Robinson's essays is the obvious warmth of his attitude to Fielding. The essay just quoted continues with an appreciation of Fielding and Young's translation of Plutus , published less than a month before: . . . I lighted my Pipe, and having been a Truant in my Greek , since I left School, pull'd out of my Pocket the new Translation of Plutus . . . by Fielding and Young , which I read over for my Evening's Amusement. The Drollery, the exquisite Strokes of Humour, Satire, and Ridicule, with the admirable Vein of Wit and Pleasantry, that run through that inimitable Piece, made me several Times burst out into a loud Laugh, tho' alone, insomuch that the People of the House, if they were not well accustomed to my way in such Cases, would certainly take me to be mad, at least for the Time; and indeed . . . I am generally so strongly agitated on such facetious Occasions, that they might guess worse. His "Reflections on the many beautiful Passages I had just been reading" bring on the usual dream in which Plutus, having recovered his eyesight, sets about to favor men according to merit. Many are stripped of wealth and dignities, but "in the midst of these Disasters, I was not a little comforted to see my reverend and worthy Friend Mr. Abraham Adams translated from his Living of twenty three Pounds per Ann. to the See of -------" (C409, 1/2; Essays , p. 70). 16 It seems to have been a delightful evening for Robinson: a "Turn amongst the Strawberries," a swim in the pool, and a chance to enjoy Fielding's latest work. In Essay IX of the collected essays, a dream-vision probably published in the Champion , although in an issue no longer extant, Robinson writes whimsically of the possibility of inheriting the virtues and abilities of his contemporaries: If it were in the Power of good Men and . . . good Women to devise their amiable Qualities to their Relations and Friends . . . what Man could be so abandoned as not to wish himself a near Relation, or an intimate Acquaintance, of an Ar [ gy ] le , Ch [ esterfiel ] d , P [ ultene ] y , P [ op ] e , or F [ iel ] d [ in ] g , in hopes to be the Devisee of their Integrity, Wit, Patriotism, Genius, or Humour, as the most effectual Consolation for their Loss? ( Essays , pp. 53-54). Even without this incentive, Robinson was, at the least, a would-be friend of Fielding's. He dispensed praise and, as a subscriber to the Miscellanies (1743), some portion also of that "fat Substance" Fielding invokes in Tom Jones . 17 It is unlikely that Fielding longed for Robinson's "Humour," but he does seem to have regarded him with respect. The first dream published in the Champion (13 December 1739; Works , XV, 97-102) 18 is by Fielding but written in the character of a specialist in dream-visions, a man of a "twilight imagination" (p. 97), who has chambers in the Inner Temple—perhaps in playful allusion to Robinson and his interests or even in acknowledgment of hints Robinson may have furnished for the essay. Fielding clearly refers to Robinson's Champion essay of 13 May 1740, the dissection of Walpole's head and heart, in a dream-vision of his own published on 24 May. The Great Man presents himself on the banks of the River Styx in a miserable state: Mercury was very curious concerning a Hole in his Breast, least he should conceal any prohibited Goods therein, but the Gentleman protested that he had nothing there but his Heart, which had been lately taken out and dissected, as well as his Head, which I observ'd looked in a very sorry Condition. (C83 [24 May 1740], 2/1; Works , XV, 320). When, in April 1740, the editors of the Champion decided to include more contributions from outside sources, Robinson was the first writer to whom they turned. The introduction, by one of the editors, to Robinson's first contribution is especially complimentary: The Captain thinks himself so much oblig'd by the following delicate Performance, and has so good an Opinion of its Merit, that he looks upon the immediate Publication of it, as the least Acknowledgment he can make to the Author, and the greatest Pleasure he can bestow upon his Readers. (C63 [8 Apr 1740], 1/1) 19 In his own way, as an occasional essayist, Robinson stayed with the Champion longer than any other writer, except Ralph. His essays, published from April 1740 to June 1742, span roughly two-thirds of the time the journal was in existence. W. B. Coley has written that "of all Fielding's major undertakings perhaps none is more surrounded by doubtful circumstance than his journal The Champion ." 20 A knowledge of William Robinson's role as a contributor to the Champion provides, I believe, some of the historical context necessary for more fully understanding that journal and Fielding's association with it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * I have received great assistance in my research for this paper from Ruthe R. Battestin who conducted investigations on my behalf at the Inner Temple Library, the Guildhall Library, the Public Record Office, the Law Society Library, and elsewhere. Her help has been so pervasive that I have not felt it possible to acknowledge it specifically on every occasion. The encouragement and expert advice of Martin C. Battestin have been very heartening and helpful. I have benefited also from the professional services of Mr. M. J. Wood of the Society of Genealogists; Michael Yelland of the Association of Genealogists and Record Agents; and T. D. Mathew, Windsor Herald. References to the Champion in this paper are to original issues, unless otherwise stated. Numerals, when given after the date, refer to page and column. 1 See Champion No. 360 (2 Mar 1741/42). 2 The Folger Shakespeare Library possesses a possibly unique copy (call-number: PR3668/R8E8/Cage). 3 Replaced in the collected edition of the Champion by the "Remarkable Queries," a very effective attack on Walpole originally published in C141 (7 Oct 1740). 4 Robinson published at least one literary work in the Champion which is not an essay and not reprinted in this collection: a poem in praise of Garrick, signed "Somnus" and dated from the "Inner Temple," printed in C380 (22 Apr 1742), 2/3. 5 A William Robinson of Gwersyllt, Denbighshire, was admitted to the Inner Temple on 17 June 1727, but he died in June 1739 (Inner Temple Library, typescript of admissions to the Inner Temple; Alfred N. Palmer, "A History of the Old Parish of Gresford," Archaeologia Cambrensis , 6th series, V [1905], 63). I am grateful to Ruthe Battestin for checking this typescript and to Mr. W. W. S. Breem, Librarian and Keeper of Manuscripts, Inner Temple Library, for checking other unpublished records of the Inner Temple. 6 St. Mary's Parish Register. In the possession of the incumbent. 7 "William Robinson of the Inner Temple, London, Gent" was enrolled as a solicitor in the Court of Chancery on 12 May 1741 (Law Society Library, MS. Roll of Solicitors, Vol. I, 1720[29]-91). He is referred to as an attorney in several apprenticeship documents (PRO. IR1/16, fol. 199; IR1/18, fols. 93, 192; IR1/20, fol. 192; documents dated January 1742, February 1747, June 1749, and May 1756, respectively). For the assignment, see Articles of Clerkship, PRO. CP5/46. William Robinson is not designated "of the Inner Temple" in this assignment, but the clerk whose articles were assigned, William Dearsly, was apprenticed to William Robinson of the Inner Temple in May 1756 (PRO. IR1/20, fol. 192). 8 Boyd's Marriage Index, which covers, I believe, about 50% of Anglican marriages in the London/Middlesex area in this period, is kept by the Society of Genealogists. Information about the marriage as given in the text is supplemented from the marriage allegation (Guildhall Library. Marriage Allegations, Bishop of London, 10,091/86, no. 231) and the register of St. Gregory by St. Paul (Guildhall Library, MS. 18,934, p. 145). I am grateful to Ruthe Battestin for first determining that the signatures on the assignment and allegation match. I have since compared photocopies of these signatures myself. 9 One record might be seen as casting doubt on the identification of William Robinson of the Inner Temple with the William Robinson of the Robinson-Byard marriage. There is a baptismal entry for a Sally Robinson, "d. of William and Ann Robinson, of Whitefriars," in the printed Temple Church Register under date 7 January 1745/46, several months before the Robinson-Byard marriage ( Register of the Temple Church , transcribed by G. D. Squibb, Harleian Society Publications, n. s. 1 [London, 1979], p. 22). This Sally would be the right age for Sally, the daughter of William Robinson of the Inner Temple, buried 1750, aged 4 ( Essays , pp. 84-85). William Robinson of the Inner Temple did baptize his son John at the Temple Church on 19 October 1753 ( Register , p. 27). Perhaps the explanation suggested by Mr. Wood is the most plausible: that Robinson's first wife died within a short time of Sally's birth and Robinson needed to remarry quickly to provide a mother for his infant daughter. Remarriages for such a purpose were, as Mr. Wood points out, rather frequent. The name Ann was a common one, and it would not be too much of a coincidence if it were the name of Robinson's second wife as well as of his first. Even if the explanation of this anomaly remains unclear, however, the evidence for the identification of William Robinson of the Inner Temple and the Robinson of the Robinson-Byard marriage is conclusive. 10 Parish Register (Guildhall Library, MS. 10,349). 11 Ms. Sarah Nichols, Assistant Librarian of the Law Society, has informed me that Robinson is not listed in the London/Westminster section of the first three editions of Browne's Law List (1775, 1777, and 1779). 12 See British Library General Catalogue of Printed Books to 1975 ; David Erskine Baker et al., Biographia Dramatica (London, 1812), I, 603; and Samuel Halkett and John Laing, Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous English Literature , new ed., ed. James Kennedy et al. (Edinburgh, 1926-62), III, 166. Robinson's first name is omitted in these sources, probably because they all derive from an earlier British Museum catalogue in which it was omitted. 13 In one of the poems published with the first edition, Robinson writes a friend about a journey northward of several days to what must have been his family home: "The Joy, the Transport I felt here / At the sweet Sight of all that's dear / I can't describe! . . . / Our Folks and yours are very well" (p. 96). Thomas Ashburner, "of Kendall, Bookseller," subscribed for twenty-five copies of this edition, by far the largest subscription ("A List of the Subscribers Names," p. 15). 14 Robinson's essays in the Champion , from his first contribution in April 1740, are clearly those of a Londoner. According to documents at the Law Society and the PRO, he was practicing law from his chambers in the Inner Temple from 1741 to at least August 1758 (see text and note 7 above). 15 Essays VI, VII, IX, and XII. The first and last of these essays appear in original issues of the Champion still extant, C113 (2 Aug 1740) and C409 (29 June 1742). Robinson also mentions Otterspool in Essay IV ( Essays , p. 28), originally published in C92 (14 June 1740). 16 This reference to Adams seems meant as a compliment to Young, the model for Parson Adams and one of the translators of the work Robinson is praising. If so, it would be, I believe, the earliest datable allusion to Young as the original of Adams. 17 Edited Martin C.

      <field name="heading_text">From the Monthly Magazine, and British Register : Notes on Milton, Pope, Boyce, Johnson, Sterne, Hawkesworth, and Prior by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">T he Monthly Magazine, and British Register (hereafter MM ) began publication in February 1796. Richard Phillips, later to be knighted, was the publisher and a contributor on political issues; the editor for the first ten years was the literary Jack-of-all-trades, Dr. John Aikin. Charles Lamb and his friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge contributed poems to the periodical, and their friend George Dyer was a regular contributor, his major effort being a series of miscellaneous prose pieces he titled Cantabrigiana . My purpose is to call attention to pieces either forgotten or totally ignored for the period 1796, when the MM began, through 1805, when the last of Dyer's series appeared, my original interest in the MM centering upon him. I proceed seriatim. Volume 4 (October), 245-247, and (November 1797), 418-420, and Volume 5 (February 1798), 84-85. 1 Gilbert Wakefield writes from Hackney: "I propose to send you such imitations or resemblances, of the ancients in Paradise Lost , as have escaped the notice of Milton's editors; persuaded, that whatever relates to so great a poem, and so illustrious a man, cannot be wholly uninteresting to our readers." Having but little Latin and no Greek, I can only refer others to these notes. I am able to add, however, on the authority of Professor Alastair Fowler, that they are of no little interest. He writes, privately: "Some have been taken up by editors, or perhaps independently discovered; many have not. The new parallels or echoes are in some cases valuable. Eg. at Monthly Mag. iv, 420, Wakefield compares PL vii. 581 'powdered with stars' with Drummond's Tears . The parallel usually cited, in Sylvester, is adequate enough, and in any case 'powdered' was a common enough word. Nevertheless, the Drummond possibility is interesting in view of Neville Davies' demonstration that at one time Milton borrowed fairly heavily from Drummond (early, in Nativity Ode ). This was unknown until quite recently." I trust other Miltonians will also find these notes worthy of examination. Volume 6 (August 1798), 88. The contributor, Rheno, of Edinburgh, takes issue with Joseph Warton's statement in his edition of Pope's poems, only recently published, that Pope's Poemata Italorum differs from the "original edition of this selection only by possessing the addition of the poem of ' Aonius Palearius de Immortalitate Animae .'" 2 Warton had written that Pope added "a very indifferent Poem of Aonius Palearius, De Immortalitate Animi , in Three Books; when he might have enriched his Collection by many more Pieces of Vida, Ant. Flaminius, Cotta, Sannazarius, Politianus, Molza , and the Strozzi , and a number of more exquisite morsels than those which he has inserted, if he had consulted the ten volumes of the Carmina Illustrium Poetarum , printed at Florence 1720, and Carmina Quinque Poetarum , Flor., 1720." The original edition from which, according to Warton, Pope "borrowed his collection" and of which he "took no notice" was published in London in 1684 under the title Anthologia . Evidently very little attention has been paid to the history of Pope's Selecta Poemata Italorum Qui Latine Scripserunt , for Maynard Mack contents himself with noting that Pope's "enthusiasm for the minor Italians who wrote in Latin was so durable as to cause him to collect and publish an anthology of their work towards the end of his life." 3 Indeed, G. B. Hill, editor of Johnson's Lives of the Poets , even gets the title of Pope's edition wrong, substituting Carmina for Poemata (III. 183n). All this despite R. H. Griffith's statement that the work "is the most interesting thing put forward this year [1740], but it has been little studied." 4 Griffith simply notes that "Pope has rearranged the poems, with additions and omissions. His two volumes contain 119 pieces, Atterbury's one volume 81 pieces. One of Pope's additions is Vida's three books 'Poeticorum'; see, further, the article on Christopher Pitt in D.N.B." (p. 414). Pitt translated Vida's Poeticorum into English. Warton printed a letter from Pope to Pitt, dated July 23, 1726, in which Pope wrote of the pleasure afforded him by the translation of Vida, adding "I am pleased to have been (as you tell me) the occasion of your undertaking that work." 5 Joseph Spence records Pope's admiration of Vida, Fracastorius, Sannazzarius, Flaminio, and the three Amalthei, especially Jerome. Pope said that "Politian is one of the first-rate modern Latin poets. Molza, very good: [Mantuan, not pure Latin.] Bembo and Sadolet write pure Latin, but very stiff and unpoetical." 6 Anthologia seu Selecta Quaedam Poemata Italorum qui Latine scripserunt , 1684 was edited by Francis Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester. It is a duodecimo with 216 pages of the actual anthology and seven pages of a prefatory address to his "Benevoli Lectori," the elegant Latin of which was omitted in Pope's edition. That edition, published in 1740, omits the Quaedam in the title of the 1684 edition but adds on the title-page, "Curâ cujusdam Anonymi Anno 1684 congesta, iterum in lucem data, unà cum aliorum Italorum operibus, Accurante A. Pope." Warton said that Pope "took no notice" of Atterbury's Anthologia from which he "borrowed his collection," and this is passing strange, as Pope and Atterbury were close friends. Yet there is no mention of the Anthologia in their correspondence, nor, indeed, anywhere in Pope's letters. Nor did the two mention any of the poets in the Anthologia in their correspondence. Pope's edition is in two octavo volumes with a total of 522 pages; hence the additions are considerable. The number of pieces from the 1684 edition not included are relatively few. First then, the additions in volume I as they appear there: Joh. Bapt. Amalthei, Corydon, Sarnus, Silis ; M. Hieronymi Vidae, Corydon ; Hieronymi Fracastorii, Alcon, sive de Cura Canum Venaticorum ; M. Hieronymi Vidae, Poeticorum ; Aonii Palaerii, De Animorum Immortalitate . The additions to volume II, again in order of appearance: Actii Synceri Sannazarii, Ad Lucium Crassum, Ad Joannen Pardum Hispanum, Ad Divum Jacobum Picenum, De Studiis suis, Ec. Libris Joviani Pontani, Ad Ruinas Cumarum urbis vetustissimae, Quod Pueritiam egerit in Picentinis, Ad Villam Mergillinam ; F. Marii Molsae, Ad Henricum Britanniae Regem uxoris repudiatae nomine, Ad Sodalem in morbo mortifero, Ad Venerem ; Andreae Naugerii, De Cupidine &amp;c. Hyella, Ad Noctem, Ad Gelliam rusticantem ; Angeli Politani, De Ovidii Exilio &amp;c. Morte ; Ludovici Ariosti, De diversis Amoribus, Ad Petrum Bembum ; Andrea Naugerii; In Vancium Vicum Patavinum amoenissimum ; Angeli Politiani, Nutricia, Manto, Ambra ; Petri Bembi, Benacus ; Hieronymi Fracastorii, Ad Danielem Rhainerium, Ad Joan. Matth. Gibertum, Ad Margaritam Valesiam Navarrae Reginam, Ad M. Ant. Flaminium &amp;c. Galeatium Florimontium, Ad Franciscum Turrianum Veronensem, In mortem Aliprandi Madrutti, Ad Alexandrum Farnesium Cardinalem, Ad Eundem, Ad Julium III. Pont. Max., Incidens, Incidens, ad Jo. Bapt. Turrianum, Hyems, ad Eundem, Incidens, ad Eundem, Aliud, Aliud ; Balthasaris Castillioni, Alcon, Prosopopoeia Lud. Pici Mirandulani, De Elisabella Gonzaga canente, Hippolyte Balthasari Castilioni conjugi, De Paulo canente ; Hier. Amalthei, Ad Hyellam, De Horologio pulvureo . The following are in the 1684 edition, but not in Pope: Danielis Heinsii, Thyrsis. Ecloga VIII ; Hugonis Grotii, Myrtilus, sive Idyllium Nauticum, Ad Dan. Heinsium. Ecloga IX ; Georgii Buchanani, Desiderium Ptolemaei Tastaei. Ecloga X, Desiderium Lutetiae. Ecloga XI (for which Pope substitutes Buchanan's In Neaeram and Calendae Maiae ); Angeli Politiani, De Alcone &amp;c. Serpente ; Hieronymi Amalthei, De Leonilla, &amp;c. Lydia ; Annibalis Cruceii, de Ersilia ; Petri Bembi, Amores ad Melinum, Ad Lygdamum . Pope has no poems by Daniel Heinsius and Hugo Grotius; the 1684 edition has no poems by Francesco Maria Molsa and Aonio Paleario (i.e. Antonio dalla Paglia). It would be foolish to try to ascertain what Rheno of Edinburgh thought were the "one or two pieces which have a tendency to excite immoral sentiments in the mind" which Pope "virtuously rejected." And Rheno was mistaken when he stated that "All the elegies of Sannazarius . . . are among the additions of Pope"; the 1684 edition includes five of Sannazarius's elegies. There are twenty-six different poets in Pope's edition; only seven of these (Ariosto, Buchanan, Castiglione, Fracastori, Politan, Sannazarius, and Vida) are mentioned, cited, quoted, or translated in the Twickenham Pope or in Pope's correspondence. 7 Daniel Heinsius and Hugo Grotius, both in the 1684 edition but not in Pope's edition, were known to him. He mentions Heinsius (Twickenham, I. 25) and he knew Grotius's Annotata in Vetus Testamentum (Twickenham IX. 183 and X. 86). He praised a beautiful episode in Politan's Ambra , one of the poems in his edition (Twickenham VII. 31), and knew Politan's Praefatio in Homerum (Twickenham VII. 43, 78, 136). Parallels to Buchanan's poetry are suggested (Twickenham III. i. l. 11n. and l. 96n.). Fracastori is merely mentioned in the Advertisement to the Dunciad (Twickenham V. 9); Pope quotes one line from Sannazarius's Epigrammata (Twickenham VIII. 353); and Castiglione's Cleopatra , one of the poems in Pope's edition, is translated by Pope under the title On the Statue of Cleopatra, made into a Fountain by Leo the Tenth. Translated from the Latin of Count Castiglione (Twickenham VI. 66-68). Dr. Johnson wrote that "Pope had sought for images and sentiments in a region not known to have been explored by many other of the English writers; he had consulted the modern writers of Latin poetry, a class of authors whom Boileau endeavoured to bring into contempt, and who are too generally neglected." 8 The Reverend W. Parr Greswell, who quoted the above sentence by Johnson, continued by suggesting that perhaps Pope "had an eye to this passage [lines 15 following of In Leonem X. Pont. Max. ] of Sannazarius, when he composed these lines of his epitaph on Gay—'Not that here thy bust / Is mix'd with heroes, or with kings thy dust, / But that the virtuous,' &amp;c." 9 Greswell also pointed out that Johnson, in his life of Pope, deplored Pope's borrowing from Ariosto in his [Pope's] epitaph upon himself [ Lives , III. 272]. Pope made use of, for lack of a better term, Ariosto's Orlando Furioso more than once in his poetry. This is also true of Vida's Ars Poetica , especially in the Essay on Criticism , lines 705-706 of which read, "Immortal Vida ! on whose honour'd Brow / The Poet's Bays and Critick's Ivy Grow." 10 Volume 7 (February 1799), 103. "Y," writing from Leicester, attributes the music for "An Ode to Charity" to Dr. William Boyce, who composed it "at the request of Mr. Joseph Cradock, of Gumley, in Leicestershire, who wrote the elegant poem for the annual performance in support of the Leicester infirmary." The music is not listed in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians . Cradock, in his Literary and Miscellaneous Memoirs (1826), states that "An ODE was written for the occasion, which was set to music by Dr. Boyce, and ably conducted by his friend Dr. Howard" (I. 123). According to "Y," Boyce was paid £300 and did not himself keep a copy of the music. Volume 13 (May 1802), 347-349. A letter by O. G. Gilchrist offering some glosses on Henry John Todd's edition of Milton's Comus . Octavius Graham Gilchrist is described as an "antiquary" in the Dictionary of National Biography . He was also a well-known book-collector. He edited the poems of Richard Corbet, among other works, and contributed to the works of other scholars. I quote only those suggestions I find convincing, omitting only two. V. 179. Yet O! where else Shall I inform my unacquainted feet . Hurd observes, that "the expression ' unacquainted feet ,' is a little hard!"—Milton, however, followed Spenser in the Faerie Queene:— She greatly grew amazed at the sight, And th' unacquainted light began to fear. P. 66, vol. 1, ed. 1590. V. 213. O welcome pure-ey'd Faith, white-handed Hope, Thou hovering Angel, girt with golden wings, And thou, " unblemish'd " form of Chastity ! The last line was originally written unspotted , but was afterwards altered, perhaps from being too like a line in Drayton's "Legend of Matilda the Faire:"—Whose form unspotted Chastity may take. Works, vol. 2, p. 546, ed. Oldys . V. 334. Disinherit Chaos, that reigns here In double night of darkness and of shades . It is not necessary to recur to the tenebrae conduplicantur of Pacuvius for this expression, which is to be met with in Drayton's Moon Calf:— And on the noonsted bring a double night . Vol. 2, p. 486, ut sup . Compare also Cartwright:— That whiles thick darkness blots the light My thoughts may cast another night ; In which double shade , &amp;c. Works, p. 223, ed. 1651. The latter extract may serve to illustrate a passage in Paradise Regained:— ---Now began Night with her sullen wing to double-shade The desert. B. I, p. 499. V. 420. Chastity: She that has that May trace huge forests , and unharbour'd heaths, Infamous hills , and sandy perilous wilds. Milton had classical authority for this expression in the Infames Scopulos of Horace; but it may be traced in the Piscatory Eclogues appended to Fletcher's Purple Island, printed the year in which Comus was writen:— And now he haunts th' infamous woods and downs . E. I, p. 4, 4 to . 1633. V. 749. Coarse complexions, And cheeks of sorry grain, will serve to ply The sampler, and to tease the huswife's wool. What need a vermeil-tinctured lip for that, Love-darting eyes, or tresses like the morn? The beauty of this passage might alone be a sufficient apology for my quoting it, but I have copied it in order to notice an elegant expression, something similar to Milton's " vermeil-tinctured ," in a forgotten poem by Quarles:— ---A sweet vermilion-tincture stain'd The bride's fair cheek. Argalus and Parthenia, p . 118 4 to 1647. V. 728. She, guiltless damsel, flying the mad pursuit Of her enraged stepdam, Guendolen, Commended her fair innocence to the flood , In Ben Jonson's "Pan's Anniversary," presented before King James in 1625, we meet with precisely the same expression as in the last line above from Milton:— Commending so to all posterity Her innocence. Works, vol. 6, p . 174, Ed. Whalley . Jonson was one of Milton's favourite poets, and at the same time the most admired mask-writer extant; and, as it is probable he would refer to Jonson while writing on such a subject, he might, however unconscious, retain some of his expressions. It will be observed that line or "verse" numbers 213, 420, 749, and 829 are 214, 419-423, 751, and 840 in modern editions. The editors of the Longman's Milton (1968) offer no parallels on these lines, with the exception of repeating Horace's infames scopulos for the "Infamous hills" of line 423. What is more, A. S. P. Woodhouse and Douglas Bush, editors of Comus in the Variorum Commentary on the Poems of John Milton , volume two, part three (1972), cite Newton and Todd for Horace's infames scopulos for line 423 and are silent on the other lines quoted by Gilchrist. Todd had added Gilchrist's parallel from Phineas Fletcher in later editions, of which I have seen the fifth (1850). Gilchrist had suggested Hebrews I.3, "the express image of his person," for Milton's "The express resemblance of the gods" (l. 69); the editors of the Variorum Commentary give Verity credit for the parallel or source (p. 867). They have no notes on lines 179 and 751, and only a textual note on line 840. They note the original reading, "unspotted" for "unblemish'd," but offer nothing else for line 214. For the "double night" of line 334 they quote "Ovid, M. ll. 550," i.e. duplicataque noctis imago est , with a cross-reference to Paradise Regained I. 500. Walter Mackellar, editor of the Variorum Commentary on that poem, writes, "The present line ["Night with her sullen wing to double-shade"] and Comus 334, 'In double night of darkness and of shades', may be echoes of Ovid, M. ll. 550: 'The image of night is doubled'," quoting Ovid's line. Gilchrist's quotation of tenebrae conduplicantur from Pacuvius 11 has also gone ignored, along with the lines from Drayton and Cartwright. Volume 15 (April 1803), 248, in the Port-folio of a Man of Letters. The assertion is made, which I have not elsewhere encountered, that Dr. Johnson was helped in his Dictionary by Lord Chesterfield, David Garrick, the younger William Melmoth, Edward Moore, Richard Owen Cambridge, Soame Jenyns, Horace Walpole and others. Also that Dr. Thomas Campbell had refused Dodsley's offer that he compile the dictionary. This almost surely belongs in the Johnson Apocrypha. Volume 15 (July 1803), 514-515. The writer suggests that Sterne plagiarized from The life of a Satirical Puppy called Nim 1657, no author given. It is attributed to Thomas May. The work, if Sterne used it or not, is not mentioned in Gardner D. Stout, Jr.'s edition of A Sentimental Journey or in the index volume to the Florida Tristram Shandy . Volume 16 (January 1804), 550-551, in the Port-folio. The printing of six letters by William Congreve is not noticed in John C. Hodges's bibliography of Congreve's letters on page ix of his William Congreve Documents &amp; Letters (1964). Their appearance in the MM considerably antedates the 1840 date listed in Hodges and necessitates revision in the history of their printing. 1840 is the date of Leigh Hunt's edition of the plays of Wycherley, Congreve, Vanbrugh, and Farquhar in which the six letters were printed. Hunt wrote, "We are not aware that these letters have ever been published" (p. xxxvi, 1851 ed.). Volume 18 (October 1804), 233, in the Port-folio. The following letter from Dr. John Hawkesworth to an unnamed correspondent, almost surely Lord Sandwich, was unknown to me and to John Abbott, the author of the definitive study of Hawkesworth. 12 The date of the letter is incorrect, as the events it mentions occurred more than two years earlier. If it is genuine, as indeed it appears to be, it should be dated around June 1773. Richard Berenger was first Equerry to George III. DR. HAWKESWORTH, Respecting his Dedication of Cook's Voyages to the King. MY LORD, I had some days ago, the favour of a letter from Mr. Berenger, that has laid me under obligations to your Lordship, which I feel too strongly not to wish at least to acknowledge as I ought. My knowledge of your Lordship, though at a very remote distance, makes me feel less solicitude about the manner which I may happen to do what my heart tells me ought to be done; if, therefore, I am now intruding improperly upon your Lordship, I flatter myself that my intention will atone for my fault. I think myself happy to be permitted to put my manuscript into your Lordship's hands, because, though it increases my anxiety and my fears, yet it will at least secure me from what I should think a far greater misfortune than any other that can attend my performance, the danger of addressing to the King any sentiment, allusion, or opinion, that would make such an address improper. As I had no copy fair enough for your Lordship's perusal, some delay was unavoidable; I have now the honour to submit the work to your Lordship, with the Dedication, from which the duty that I owe to his Majesty, and, if I may be permitted to add any thing to that, the duty I owe to myself, have concurred to exclude the servile, extravagant, and indiscriminate adulation, which has so often disgraced alike those by whom it has been given and received. I have the honour to be, with the utmost regard and esteem, My Lord, Your Lordship's most obliged Servant London, JNO. HAWKESWORTH." March 2, 1761 Volume 18 (November 1804) 323-324, in the Port-folio. "Prior's Chloe [sic] has been usually supposed an imaginary person; but the late Sir William Musgrave wrote the following memorandum in a copy of the Poems. 'Prior's Chloe went to live at Welford, near Nottingham, where she married a journeyman shoe-maker, a stranger, and died at Welford in a house of Mrs. Bates, of whom she rented it. She just lived to see her fortune spent so near as not quite to want: many curiosities were sold after her death; of which what she died worth chiefly consisted. She had something sprightly even when near dying.'" Charles K. Eves believes that Chloe was probably "the Jane Ansley to whom Prior left a bequest of a year's wages, mourning and fifty pounds. That she was a widow and a cook-maid seems certain." 13 The Chloe of three of Prior's poems was Anne Durham. She was succeeded as Prior's mistress by Elizabeth Cox who said that "Flanders Jane was his Chloe." 14 Sir William Musgrave's memorandum would seem too circumstantial to be suspect.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Manuscript of Wilkie Collins's No Name by William Baker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scant attention has been paid to a study of Wilkie Collins's manuscripts. Although S. Lonnoff in her Wilkie Collins and his Victorian readers: a study in the rhetoric of authorship (1982) offers a detailed account of Collins's working methods, she does not provide a sustained analysis of his manuscripts. A study of the holograph manuscript of No Name now in the Hugh Walpole Collection at the King's School Canterbury with the serial version in All the Year Round (15 March 1862 to 17 January 1863), edited by Charles Dickens, has intrinsic interest for students of serialized publication. It confirms Anthony Trollope's comments in his Autobiography concerning Wilkie Collins's compositional methodology: "Wilkie Collins seems so to construct his [works] that he not only, before writing, plans everything on, down to the minutest detail, from the beginning to the end; but then plots it all back again, to see that there is no piece of necessary dove-tailing which does not dove-tail with absolute accuracy. The construction is most minute and most wonderful". 1 Further, a study provides a fascinating examination of the relationship between the manuscript and parts published version, in terms of what was omitted from the manuscript, deliberately cut from it, and added for serial purposes to it. Wilkie Collins's manuscript of No Name was purchased by Sir Hugh Walpole from Maggs Brothers. The invoice now inside the front boards of the 4to. manuscript bound in full morocco gilt is dated 29 April 1937 and shows us that the manuscript cost its buyer £150. Affixed to the front papers is Wilkie Collins's holograph title page for the three-volume Sampson and Low 1862 edition of the novel with a dedication to Francis Carr Beard, and a preface—both of which did not appear in the serial form of the novel. The manuscript itself paginated "1" through "571" has black ink writing on one side of unruled paper measuring 28.5 cms. x 21.8 cms. There are printer's markings throughout, and the author indicates serial instalments in his manuscript with the note "1st Weeks' Part", "2nd Weekly Part", and so on. At the top of the opening page of the manuscript is the note in an unknown hand: "Wilkie Collins' Story. The Title was not determined on when the first pages were written", followed by three heavily erased unreadable titles. There are literally thousands of revisions, erasures, and additions observable in the No Name manuscript. Collins tampered with sentences, blotting out single words, phrases, whole sentences, and sometimes paragraphs. He added replacements in a minute script in the narrow space between the lines. He also made further changes on carefully prepared slips, which are precisely and almost artistically affixed to the manuscript page. Two main kinds of alterations are observable. Often substantial passages have been blacked out in heavy ink. Collins made a thorough job of this, and to recover any of the wording (if recovery is at all possible), ultra-violet equipment would be necessary. The second kind of alterations are legible ones. With these, Collins placed a horizontal or series of vertical ink lines through what he had written. Practically it would be a most difficult and certainly a laborious task to reproduce every alteration in the manuscript and to document in their entirety changes between the manuscript, the All the Year Round ( AYR ) serialization, and the 1862 three-volume version of No Name , which appeared in December 1862, just before the serial publication stopped on 17 January 1863. Rather, I will concentrate on the manuscript and the serial version. I will illustrate the most important example of differences between these two versions of the text. The three-volume edition, published before serialization was completed, shows in fact few substantive differences from the serial version. The reasons for the wealth of changes found in the manuscript, and between the manuscript and the AYR version, are chiefly aesthetic and practical, and often a combination of both. Collins, apparently, found writing his novels to be a race against publishing deadlines. In a letter written "presumably [in] early Summer 1860, since Collins mentioned his bargaining with the publishers for the volume publication of The Woman in White ", Collins refers to "his 'weekly race' with All the Year Round ". The author "was, for most of the novel, more than a week or so ahead of publication deadlines (i.e. a month before magazine day in England so as to get the American sheets off)". 2 The average weekly length of the serialization of No Name was 64 lines per column, two columns to a page, six pages (sometimes seven, e.g. 3 January 1863), amounting to around 5,400 words per periodical part. The average length of a holograph manuscript part is 10-11 pages, but owing to the extent of revision it is very difficult to assess the number of words actually written by Collins. A detailed comparison of the manuscript with the AYR text reveals that sometimes the serial text is longer than the originally submitted weekly section, probably for practical reasons: extra column inches of wordage were needed (these modifications Collins either made on the manuscript itself, or on the prepared slips which he affixed to the manuscript page). In other instances, however, the manuscript section was apparently too long for the weekly word allowance, so words had to be dropped, irrespective of aesthetic considerations. In an article I wrote published in Dickens Studies Newsletter , 11, No.2 (June 1980) entitled "Wilkie Collins, Dickens and No Name " I analysed Dickens's contribution to the composition of No Name . A comparison of the manuscript with the serial version for the magazine edited by Dickens and a study of Dickens's letters dated 24 January 1862, 20 September 1862, and 14 October 1862, helped to assess how much Dickens had influenced plot, character motivation, and legal details in No Name . However, Collins was not totally subject to his editor's whims and was not prepared to do all that Dickens wanted. For instance, Dickens wrote to him "If the story were mine, I should decidedly not put into it the anticipation contained in the last line or two of Norah's postscript" (14 October 1862) 3 at the end of letter four. Collins refused to alter the postscript material. On the other hand Collins accepted most of Dickens's technical advice and suggestions appertaining to character and incident credibility. Apart from these constraints, imposed by the publisher or editor, or both, Collins was probably concerned with artistic matters above all, as Trollope indicated in the words from his Autobiography already quoted. Comparative examination of the manuscript and the printed serial version reveals, for example, that in the manuscript actions in the plot had not sufficiently developed and needed clarification, and occasionally dating inconsistencies in the manuscript needed tidying up in proof for the printed text, as will be shown. Not the least of the interesting insights to be gleaned from the No Name manuscripts are passages of quite sustained writing, which Collins erased for one reason or another, and which should not be allowed to remain unvisited amongst the thick morocco binding in Canterbury. Manuscript reading reveals passages of scenic description which failed to get into print. To cite one not too lengthy example, in the opening three paragraphs of the Fourth Scene, Collins describes "Aldborough" in Suffolk, which he probably visited in April of 1862. 4 The texts of the manuscript, serial version ( AYR , number 171, 2 August 1862, p. 481), and three decker (II, 143) are the same. Collins describes "old Aldborough" where "At its opposite extremity, the street leads to a deserted martello tower, and to the forlorn outlying suburb of Slaughden, between the river Alde and the sea. Such are the main characteristics of this curious little outpost of the shores of England, as it appears at the present time". Scene painting continues in the manuscript in a passage not found in the printed texts: Of late years the great railway tree has stretched its ever-growing branches, as far as Aldborough—new houses are rising—and local opinion, cheerfully forgetful of past experience predicts a coming renewal of the ancient importance of the town. It may be so—if the sea reposes of its former conquests. If not, the bright little watering place of our time may be known, at some future day, by a ship's anchor getting entangled among the submarinic ruins of the hotel—or by fishermen's nets bringing to the surface the lighter stock in trade of the Aldborough Bazaar (Ms. 262). Of course Wilkie Collins could not have foreseen that Benjamin Britten's residence would have such an impact upon the town in the mid and late twentieth century. Collins's vision of a submerged "Aldborough" entangling anchors and nets is a startling one. His passing comment on the railway lines, which transformed the landscape of nineteenth-century England, is another document to stand alongside the more substantial accounts in Middlemarch and Dombey and Son . In spite of his caveats, Dickens recognized the value of Collins's colourfully written passages, writing to him on 20 September 1862: "There are some touches in [Wragge] which no one but a born (and cultivated) writer could get near—could draw within hail of" (Page, p. 129). An anonymous reviewer writing in the Reader noted, not without a hint of condescension, that "In the delineation of Captain Wragge and Old Mazey, Mr Collins again gives evidence, that if he chose he might go deeper, in his power of describing character, than he has ever yet thought fit to do" (Page, p. 135). The sheer extent of manuscript erasure and omission of material from the serial and the three-decker versions relating to Wragge suggests that Collins had problems with his conception of the character. Some of the omissions are difficult to justify solely on the ground of part publication requirements, and indicate that perhaps the character threatened to dominate No Name . Collins wrote in the preface to the three-decker version that his intention in the novel had been to depict "the struggle of a human creature, under those opposing influences of Good and Evil, which we have all felt, which we have all known". His aim was "to make the character of 'Magdalen' which personifies this struggle a pathetic character even in its perversity and its error" (I, vii). Wragge then had to be cut down to size and the focus centred clearly on Magdalen in both the printed editions. The most substantial of these revisions are found in what Collins in his manuscript describes as "the 15th weeks portion" of No Name —"Extracts from the Commercial library of Captain Wragge" (Ms. 188). Comparison with the serialization in AYR , number 165, 21 June 1862, pp. 337-342, entitled "Between the Scenes. Chronicle of Events: Preserved in Captain Wragge's Despatch Box. I Chronicle for October, 1846" (p. 337), i.e. the first chapter of the second volume of the 1862 first edition, reveals extensive differences between manuscript and printed text. Apart from the title change, the most obvious difference is a formal one. Wragge's "Chronicle of Events" in the printed text is divided into nine sections: "I [Chronicle for October, 1846]", ( AYR 21 June 1862, pp. 337-338); "II [Chronicle for November]", ( ibid. , 338); "III [Chronicle for December. First Fortnight]", ( ibid. , pp. 338-339); "IV [Chronicle for December, Second Fortnight]", ( ibid. , p. 339); "V [Chronicle for January 1847]", ( ibid. , pp. 339-340); "VI. [Chronicle for February]", ( ibid. , pp. 340-341; "VII [Chronicle for March]", ibid. , p. 341); "VIII [Chronicle for April and May]", ( ibid. , pp. 341-342). Section nine—"IX. [Chronicle for June]"—begins the next serial instalment in AYR (28 June 1862), pp. 361-366. In Collins's manuscript "Between The Scenes Extracts from the Commercial Library of Captain Wragge" is divided into sections "A" to "B" (188-190) and then into nine sections. The first is divided (188-190) into "A" to "D". II is "Diary for the month of November established at Derby" (191). III, "Diary for December (to the 15th of the month)"—(191-192). IV, "Diary for December (continued to the end of the month)" (193-194). V, "Diary for January 1847-" (195). VI, "Diary for the month of February. At Sheffield, and afterwards at Manchester." (196). VII, "Diary for February. At Liverpool, Preston, and Lancaster." (198). VIII, "Diary for March and April. Northwards to Stockton, Darlington, Durham" (199). IX, "Diary for May. Back again, by way of Carlisle and Liverpool, to Chester, Shrewsbury and Birmingham." "Between the Scenes" concludes in the manuscript with a section dated "May 31st" (200-202). In AYR this becomes the "29th", i.e. of June (28 June 1862, p. 204). These formal differences are a reflection of considerable changes to the content on occasions. The manuscript in this section is more than usually littered with erasures, miscellaneous markings, instructions to printers regarding capitalization and pointing, and printer's markings. Noticeable throughout is a toning down of practical detail concerning Wragge's management of Magdalen's concert parties, dates, and the actual content of her musical performances. For instance, in the manuscript, Wragge notes "I am to write the Monodrama, or Entertainment, to manage all the business in connection with it; to keep the accounts, strike the balance of profit, take half myself, and hand the other half to my niece. On her side, my niece is to appear in four changes of dress and character". These are "all female changes, all her own stipulation. She is to sing at least four songs; to play one piece on the pianoforte; and to make out with dialogue, plentifully sprinkled with safe domestic jokes about Love and Matrimony." Wragge calculates: "The whole arrangement is eminently satisfactory, except in one particular. I find it impossible to prevail on her to sign our agreement. She shows the morbid distrust of writing her name at the bottom of a document common to persons ignorant of the law; and roundly declares she will sign nothing" (Ms. 189). Only the last passage remains in AYR ; gone are details of who was to write what, Wragge's functions as her business and concert manager, how many changes of dress were to take place, how many songs to be sung, the tone of the humour. Instead all that the reader is given is Wragge's perfunctory and far less interesting: "Our arrangement is eminently satisfactory, except in one particular. She shows a morbid distrust of writing her name at the bottom of any document which I present to her; and roundly declares she will sign nothing" (p. 337). A shift of focus from Wragge to Magdalen Vanstone is seen in a comparison between manuscript "Section D: Correspondence of the Month", and the printed "I Chronicle for October, 1846". Wragge corresponds with London lawyers on Magdalen's behalf. In a reply a letter for Magdalen is enclosed. In the manuscript Wragge comments to himself, "It having occurred to my mind on reflection, that I had better look into the letter . . .," and continued: I steamed the envelope, and ran my eye over the contents. Miss Vanstone, the elder, distracted of course at not hearing from her sister; suited with a situation as governess in private family, going into the situation in a week's time; indescribably anxious to appoint a meeting privately with her sister, before undertaking her new duties and losing her freedom to go where she likes; love, tears, remembrance of old times, Etcetera, Etcetera. After closing the envelope again, I accompanied the delivery of the letter to Miss Vanstone, the younger, by a word of caution, "Opening communications with home, means placing oneself at the mercy of written persuasions to go back," I said. "Are you most sure of your own courage now, than you were when I met you?" She was ready with her answer. "Captain Wragge, when you met me on the Walls of York, I had not gone too far back. I have gone too far now." We shall see—I close this entry on the twenty-eighth of the month,—feeling, on the whole, that the wisest policy is to make a virtue of necessity, and trust her. We shall see. 29th Gone, by Jupiter! Gone to that meeting with her sister beyond all manner of doubt. A message left with the landlady, to say she will be back again, the day after tomorrow. What made me mad enough to trust her? Has my matrimonial connection with Mrs Wragge, have sympathetically affected me with imbecility? I feel almost as a [ ] 5 a fool as King Lear—I wonder I dont execute dramatic double-knocks with my feeble old fists on my salmon-coloured forehead. "Oh Wragge! Wragge! Beat at this gate that let fly thy folly in, and thy dear wisdom out!" 31st I have recovered my place in my own estimation; I have nothing in common with Mrs Wragge or King Lear. She snaps at me like a vixen fox; Attired for the work in looks and temper; pale as a sheet has come back and totally upset by her. What have I done to Miss Vanstone, the elder, that she should undermine me [ ] [ ]? Unlady like—that is what I call it—unlady like? No matter: Another major point is gained. My fair relative holds to her resolution, and goes on. On we go accordingly (190-191). The AYR text is shorter and duller; the narrative voice is not that of the present tense. Letter details are omitted, the King Lear comparison is out, so is the reference to Mrs Wragge. The suggestive confusion of Mrs Wragge with Magdalen Vanstone and her return is not present. If King Lear references have to go then so does another literary reference, which is rediscovered through the recovery of manuscript material in Collins's heavily blacked-out passages. There is extensive revision in what became the final paragraph of "III [Chronicle for December. First Fortnight]" in AYR . Cancelled passages include Wragge's account of the possibilities which suggested themself when searching for a stage name for Magdalen. He came up "with the name of the most unfortunate young person to be found in British fiction, Clarissa Harlowe", and explains that she "was the innocent victim of a scoundrel!" Magdalen's response was immediate: "She suddenly fixed me with one of her strange looks. 'So am I' she said, 'And I'll take her name. Other men might have felt hurt at this—but I am not easily offended. I merely entered a fresh protest. I was quite [ ]: she was immovable. All I could do was to get her to drop 'Clarissa' for the [ ]'" (Ms. 192). The reader does not discover what stage name she used, and Wragge's strictures, with their literary allusions have not until now appeared in print. The Clarissa echo was not strictly relevant to No Name's development. The lack of a stage name naturally provides yet another illustration of the title's reverberating significance throughout the texture of the novel. A more sustained illustration of writing removed from the printed text of No Name is found in Wragge's diaries for March, April, and May 1847. The manuscript reads: Diary for March and April. Northwards, to Stockton, Darlington, Durham, Sunder-land, and Newcastle. Book G, remains the most interesting volume in my commercial library. No changes of importance. Still excluded from the confidence of my ungrateful niece; still shamefully limited in my private surplus; still as a necessary consequence, lowered in my own estimation. I regret having written disrespectfully of King Lear in an earlier portion of these pages. I am getting old—yes, like Lear, I am evidently getting old! Diary for May. Back again by way of Carlisle and Liverpool to Chester, Shrewsbury, and Birmingham. Consulted Book G. at this last city, and discovered that Miss Vanstone (I can call her my niece no longer) has realised up to this time, the enormous sum of nearly four hundred pounds by the Entertainment. Looking at myself, as the originator of the enterprise, and finding that the profits, on my side, merely reach to seven hundred pounds, I consider my services, comparatively speaking, repaid. Figures are all very well in their way; and figures may seem to be against me. But there are rights too sacred to be disposed of by arithmetical considerations: I indignantly decline to submit my sense of inquiry to the rules of simple addition (Ms. 199). This is truncated in AYR , where the "Chronicle for April and May" relates Wragge's note that "We have visited seven more large towns, and are now at Birmingham." He consults his books and finds that "Miss Vanstone has realised by the Entertainment, up to this time, the enormous sum of nearly four hundred pounds. It is quite possible that my own profits may reach one or two miserable hundreds more. But I am the architect of her fortunes—the publisher, so to speak, of her book—and, if anything, I am underpaid" (p. 341). Gone then is Wragge's assertion of principle; this is a much more pliant character. The King Lear comparison has again met with Collins's eradication. Repetitive detail, anything over-spotlighting Wragge, anything in any way suggesting emotional attachment for Magdalen, is cut out. Wragge must appear as no more than a shrewd manipulator of vulnerable young women. Although it is tempting to do so, illustration of unpublished Wilkie Collins manuscript material should not be confined to the "Between the Scenes" section. A representative sample of other omissions is found in the Manuscript third chapter of the fourth scene of No Name . Wragge and Magdalen are speaking, and Magdalen asks Wragge: Where is Wragge? "Mrs Wragge is dressing herself (on approval) for the third time," replied the captain. "The two first times, I regret to say she entirely failed to satisfy me. Some women are born scare crows and Mrs Wragge is one of them." [three lines of heavy boxed erasures]. "Has she learnt the lesson you proposed to teach her?" "Sufficiently for the purpose," said Captain Wragge. "You may depend on her answering to her name. Don't interfere with the impression which I have purposely left in her mind, that a fine stroke of moral agriculture is at the bottom of my business in this marine retirement. She is accustomed to hold her tongue, when she understands that I am placed in critical professional circumstances. If you attempt to enlighten her you will set her talking immediately. Remember what I told you this morning. While Mrs Wragge is under my own eye, answer for her—not an instance afterwards [p. 286]. The door opened as he spoke; and Mrs Wragge timidly made her appearance, attired in a rusty old black silk gown, a [sensual] little iron-grey shawl, a bonnet of brown straw, and a faded net veil of sallow green. She came into the room with the look and manner of a child in disgrace; and shook her great head despondently as she took a chair by Magdalen's side. "A shade better," said the captain looking at his wife critically; "just a shade better. As you are a little [mouldy?] in [green?] general effect but you didn't offend the eye. Take your parasol off the table and don't sit with your feet crossed over each other. Lift your bonnet an eighth of an inch higher on the top of your head; and hide that roll of red flesh between the bottom of your cuff and the top of your glove. I object to rolls of flesh—don't annoy me by exhibiting them on any future occasion." Having delivered himself of this conjugal charge, the captain strutted to the window, and looked out. "Who is going to cheat now?" whispered Mrs Wragge, piteously addressing herself to Magdalen. "He's harder on me than ever. I've got all my London bargains upstairs; and he won't let me wear one of them." Before Magdalen could answer, Captain Wragge beckoned to her to join him at the window. "There they are!" he said, and pointed out on the parade. Mr Noel Vanstone slowly walked by . . . (Ms. 286-287). This magnificent passage exposing Wragge's cruelty to his wife and his sadism is absent from AYR and subsequent printing of No Name . The printed text is truncated and lacks the vitality of the manuscript. Dialogue and description are sacrificed to more mundane prose which will not distract the reader's attention from the unravelling of the plot and Magdalen Vanstone. Magdalen asks Wragge "Where is Mrs Wragge?" He replies "Mrs Wragge has learnt her lesson", adding "and is rewarded by my permission to sit at work in her own room. I sanction her new fancy for dress making, because it is sure to absorb all her attention, and to keep her at home. There is no fear of her finishing the Oriental Robe in a hurry—for there is no mistake in the process of making it which she is not certain to commit. She will sit incubating her gown—pardon the expression—like a hen over an addled egg. I assure you her new whim relieves me. Nothing could be more convenient under existing circumstances." He strutted away to the window—looked out—and beckoned to Magdalen to join him. "There they are!" he said, and pointed to the Parade. Noel Vanstone slowly walked by . . . ( AYR , August 9 1862, p. 510). The "addled egg" image is an arresting one: it is a natural image conveying the lifelessness and ennui to which Mrs Wragge has been reduced by her husband's bullying. Dickens in Hard Times , serialized in Household Words , the precursor of AYR , used the image to convey the sterility of the parasite James Harthouse whose heart has become a "nest of addled eggs" (Book III, ch. 2). Mrs Wragge is, on the other hand, a creature to be pitied rather than condemned. Collins's attention to dating detail evident in his manuscripts may be seen in his revisions in the thirty-second weekly part of No Name appearing in AYR , 25 October 1862. In this part there are fourteen letters. Either the dating of these or the signature and address formats are changed in AYR from the manuscript version. Thus, letter III in manuscript is dated "September 1847" (411); this appears in the serial as "September 6th 1847" (p. 147). Letters VI and IX in manuscript are signed "Ignatius De Bleriot" (415, 417); in AYR this reads "Alfred De Bleriot" (pp. 148-149). Letter X is dated in manuscript "October 27th" (418); AYR has "October 28th" (p. 150). Similarly, Letter XI, manuscript date "October 27th" (419), has serial "October 28th" (p. 151). Letter XII, dated in manuscript "October 28th" (420), has serial "October 29th" (p. 151). Again, the forty-second weekly part appearing in AYR , 27 December 1862, contains letters. The second, "From George Batram to Miss Garth," is dated in serial form, "Paris, April 13th" (p. 364); in manuscript the date reads "April 14th" (527). Manuscript inspection and comparison with serial text reveals at least one extra character not present in the printed form. Towards the end of the novel, in the final weekly part (January 17, 1863), chapter IV of The Last Scene, a new character is named. Reunited with her younger sister Magdalen, Norah tells her how she discovered the evidence confirming their claim upon the inheritance of which they had been deprived. She visited a house she had known as a girl, St Crux, where a "Mr Darwin . . . persuaded" her "to look at a singular piece of furniture" (Ms. 567). In AYR (p. 543), "Mr Darwin" is replaced by "the housekeeper", a less definite matter-of-fact name. The abstract professional generalization does not give a hint of possible previous childhood association. There is no need to describe anybody or for further explanations as there would be with a specifically named character called "Mr Darwin", who appears at such a crucial juncture, indicating the essential missing link in the jig-saw puzzle of the sisters' search. In this instance then, Collins's practical instinct as a serial writer shows through. The additional character is an unnecessary possible red-herring. Deletions in the printed text, dating amendments, are not the only differences between the manuscript and the AYR text. There are several additions appearing in the serial printing and not in the manuscript, which ought not to go unnoticed, and provide yet further testimony to the continuous re-writing in its proofs undertaken by Wilkie Collins in the production of No Name . "The Seventh Scene, chapter I, St. Crux-in-the-March" contains a paragraph: This was the man whose secret it was now the one interest of Magdalen's life to surprise! This was the man whose name had supplanted hers in Noel Vanstone's will! ( AYR , 6 December 1862, p. 290) not present in the manuscript (485). The conclusion to Chapter I of "The Last Scene, Aaron's Buildings" differs from print and manuscript. The latter finishes with "Mr Merrick was present to answer them. She was sleeping" followed by three lines of heavy erasure and the sentences "so the day ended—the first of many days that were to come" (544). The printed version reads: Mr. Merrick was present to answer them. "She was awake and wandering," he said, 6 "a few minutes since. But we have succeeded in composing her—and she is sleeping now." "Have no words escaped her, sir, which might help us to find her friends?" Mr Merrick shook his head. The doctor shook his head. 7 "Weeks and weeks may pass yet," he said; "and that poor girl's story may still be a sealed secret to all of us. We can only wait." So the day ended—the first of many days that were to come. (3 January 1863, p. 391). This addition occurs at the end of a part instalment. Collins's extra words may have been a response to Dickens's demands for filling in material to bring the instalment up to the minimum length required. Additional material might be added anywhere in the part, and not necessarily at the end of it, or at the beginning. In the middle of the final, forty-fifth weekly part, 17 January 1863, p. 435, a paragraph appears which is not in the manuscript (562). It failed to tell him the truth—but it forced a question on mind which he had not ventured to ask himself before. "Is it her gratitude or her love that is speaking to me?" he wondered. "If I was only a younger man, I might almost hope it was her love?" That terrible sum in abstraction, which had first presented itself on the day when she told him her age, began to trouble him again, as he left the house. He took twenty from forty-one at intervals, all the way back to the shipowners' office in Cornhill. This does restate and illuminate Kirke's dilemma. Further, it supplies in the final instalment a little extra element of suspense helping to retain the reader's excited attention to the very last word of the novel. To conclude, examination of the manuscript with the serial text of No Name shows that Wilkie Collins: (1) planned everything with particular care; (2) despite that, he was an obsessive tinkerer; (3) he made changes for the exigencies of publishing to satisfy the requirements of space or the wishes of his editors. Thus Wilkie Collins revised for aesthetic reasons but also for publishing ones. The text of No Name owes its features to the requirements of serial publication, i.e. the form of the novel's first publication affected its content. To repeat, the three-volume edition published before the serialization was complete, shows few substantive differences from the serial version —although I have drawn attention to a few slight verbal differences between the two. The question is raised why the three-decker version was published before serialization was complete? But serialization created the demand for the three-decker publication sooner rather than later. Publication of the first book edition whilst the serial form was still running was not uncommon Victorian publishing practice. Guinevere L. Griest in her Mudie's Circulating Library and the Victorian Novel (1970) writes that "Charles Reade's agreement with Dickens and William Henry Wills for Hard Cash spells out a typical arrangement. Reade retained the copyright and was 'at liberty' to publish the story as a complete work three weeks before the final portion . . . be printed in All the Year Round " (p. 52). Griest adds that "Mary Elizabeth Braddon corroborates this custom in a letter to her publisher, William Tinsley 'The novel can be published on February 1st and will then be six weeks in advance of its [sic] completion in the London Journal'". Griest makes the point that Mudie's profited by this, since readers were eager to borrow volume three to know the outcome of the story (see p. 241, n. 39)! The three-decker edition of No Name was published by Sampson and Low in December 1862. The last instalment of the serial version appeared on 17 January 1863. Perhaps Collins and his publishers were aiming at the Christmas market? 8 Collins's supreme mastery of the serial plot—"it is no small triumph to have constructed a story which, week after week, for nearly a year defied the divining powers of the most acute of novel readers, and surprised every-body at the end" 9 —may be dissected by comparing serial and manuscript versions. Such an analysis does not detract from Collins's brilliance in his use of form, and serves to show how he conquered its limitations and mastered its restraining influences. When necessary Collins added passages in print and also omitted passages from the manuscript. Scenic descriptive passages of lyrical beauty had to go. A character who threatened to take over, Wragge, had to be reduced to size. Theatrical reminiscences of North Country tours remain in manuscript but not until now have seen print. Wilkie Collins's "principal interest", as G. Robert Stang has appositely pointed out, was with "complication of narrative." Collins's concern with "'the details of business and intricacies of law', his exploitation of legal and forensic patterns of action are the means of projecting a coherent and impressive image of Victorian England—of a society dominated by its form, overlegalized, bureaucratized, rapacious, hypocritical." 10 To attain this object, at times some of his best passages had to go, and these are passages revealing two neglected facets of Collins's genius; his brilliance as a descriptive writer, and his superb mastery of personality quirks.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Lawrence, Garnett, and Sons and Lovers : An Exploration of Author-Editor Relationship by Mark S. Sexton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On 8 February 1913, D. H. Lawrence wrote to his friend and former teaching colleague Arthur McLeod, "I am correcting proofs of Sons and Lovers —it gives me the blues" ( Letters 573). The cause for Lawrence's gloom is easy to grasp. The publication of Sons and Lovers (1913), Lawrence's first major novel, followed a lengthy and arduous series of rewritings and revisions. Lawrence began his "Colliery novel" in 1910. In June 1912, after having rewritten the novel three times, he submitted a manuscript entitled Paul Morel to his publisher, William Heinemann, where it was rejected. Undaunted, Lawrence arranged for Edward Garnett, a friend and editor at the Duckworth publishing house, to read the work. Garnett responded with a list of editorial suggestions for yet another reworking of the book. Again Lawrence rewrote the novel, this time changing its title to Sons and Lovers . 1 Lawrence sent the rewritten book to Garnett on 13 November 1912. This version of the novel met with Garnett's approval, although the editor insisted that substantial deletions must be made from the lengthy manuscript before it could be published. Despite consternation at Garnett's proposed deletions, Lawrence was so eager to see his novel in print that he agreed to these cuts without seeing them, 2 and by early February 1913 he began to receive the book's galley proofs which revealed for the first time the explicit deletions that Garnett had made. A perusal of the Sons and Lovers facsimile manuscript graphically demonstrates why Lawrence experienced "the blues" when seeing these proofs. Although Lawrence himself had deleted considerable portions of Sons and Lovers while preparing the manuscript for Garnett, 3 the young novelist must have been shocked to behold the sweeping nature of Garnett's actual extractions. Indicated in the manuscript by huge X's drawn through the passages to be removed, Garnett's deletions comprise whole paragraphs and sometimes entire scenes. 4 Even though he suffered from "the blues," Lawrence immediately began to "correct" these galley proofs of Sons and Lovers , and by 18 February he felt so much better about the work that he wrote to Garnett: "You did the pruning job really well, and I am grateful" ( Letters 517). On 5 March, writing again to McLeod, Lawrence's mood had totally changed: "I've sent in the proofs of Sons and Lovers . It is quite a great novel" ( Letters 524). 5 Lawrence's reversal of attitude concerning his work with the galley proofs may represent little more than an exuberant young author acceding to his editor's more objective and seasoned literary judgment. 6 But a more convincing explanation for his change of mind is suggested by further examination of the Sons and Lovers facsimile manuscript. In addition to Garnett's deletions, the facsimile reveals a multitude of variations between Lawrence's manuscript and the printed text of the novel. Some of these variations represent simple and uneventful deletions of words or phrases from the manuscript. Others, however, consist of word and phrase emendations that delicately, but sometimes significantly, affect the novel's artistic merit. In fact, these emendations occasionally cluster so frequently within passages of the novel as to represent essential revisions of these passages. Since Lawrence's holograph manuscript, bearing Garnett's editorial markings, served as the printer's copy of the novel, we can conclude that these alterations must have been introduced while the book existed in galley or page proofs. We can also identify with confidence the sources of many of these emendations, even though neither the galley nor page proofs survive. 7 For instance, Mark Schorer asserts that among these variants occur "a few deletions that should probably be attributed to Duckworth's cautious blue pencil" (MS 4). As an illustration of the printer's editorial conservatism, Schorer cites the substitution of the phrase "as if he were in contact with her" (264) for the manuscript's "as if he were pressed against her, and was full of her warmth" (MS 330). Perhaps the most famous censorial deletion is from chapter 12 of the manuscript, where Paul, alone in Clara Dawes' bedroom, dons a pair of her stockings. Such alterations as these conform to a pattern: they aim at removing or neutralizing material that risks impropriety. They suggest that Duckworth, or someone at his behest, essentially suppressed material that was considered risqué, even when such textual manipulation jeopardized the novel's artistic excellence and integrity. Other emendations to the manuscript can be attributed to Lawrence's "corrections" of the galley and page proofs. For instance, when an emendation does not relate to matters of propriety, but serves clearly to enhance the novel's artistic merit and thematic meaning, Lawrence would seem the logical source. That he should be credited with many of these emendations is further attested by evidence within the novel itself. A careful comparison of the manuscript with the novel's printed text reveals subtle but unmistakable links between the passages deleted by Garnett and many of the proof emendations. In suggesting that Lawrence took an active hand in correcting the proofs that he returned to the printer, these links offer a logical explanation for Lawrence's change of mind concerning his work with the Sons and Lovers proofs. They also illuminate a dimension of the Lawrence-Garnett editorial relationship that has gone unremarked by commentators on the manuscript facsimile. In order to delineate in limited space the editorial dynamics that informed the preparation of Sons and Lovers for publication, I will present an extended comparison of a portion of the manuscript facsimile and the novel's printed text. Textual analysis, therefore, will be focused on a single chapter of the novel, chapter 7, "Lad-And-Girl Love." 8 Lawrence centers his narrative concern in "Lad-And-Girl Love" on the emotional ambivalence of Paul Morel as his life moves outward toward emotional and physical attachment to a female other than his mother. In its presentation of Paul and Miriam Leivers' adolescent love, the chapter establishes a significant feature in Paul's developing sexuality—an inability or unwillingness to relinquish a close bond with his mother. As portrayed in chapter 7, Paul exists suspended between Mrs. Morel and Miriam, not only in regard to his physical and emotional needs, but also in relation to each woman's fierce efforts to possess him. Indeed, throughout Sons and Lovers , Paul's ties to his mother powerfully affect his romantic relationships. Chapter 7's depiction of "Lad-And-Girl Love" reveals for the first time in the novel (1) the extent to which this maternal bond influences Paul's romantic affairs and (2) the subtlety with which this bond manifests itself. Against this background of thematic concerns appears the chapter's most conspicuous category of editorial changes—those passages cancelled by Garnett. 9 These passages include several scenes, or parts of scenes, which either serve no primary function in the chapter or only amplify thematic concerns taken up elsewhere in the chapter. 10 For instance, immediately following the moment when Paul compels Miriam to jump from a fence stile (154), an excised passage appears in the manuscript in which Paul, "naturally agile and very active, . . . danc[es] from one thing to another" during a country walk with Miriam. In stark contrast to Paul, Miriam "kept her regular course, almost unmovable." Paul cannot coax Miriam into altering her pace, "And gradually he fell in beside her, took her pace [my emphasis], and walked head down with her" (MS 220). The couple comes to a lake and stops, at which point Paul skims stones across the water. He asks Miriam why she does not "do ducks and drakes as well," adding, in mild criticism, "you never want to do things" (MS 220). But Paul's reproach goes no further; the narrator merely relates that Paul "did not continue the argument" (MS 220). In itself, the scene is interesting. The contrast between Paul's active physical movement and Miriam's inactive "almost unmovable" course draws attention to the basic distinctions of personality between them. Further, Paul's gradual acquiescence to the pace and demeanor demanded by Miriam exemplifies the pattern of their relationship that is developed in chapter 7: though perhaps reluctantly, Miriam nevertheless waits for Paul to finish his scampering and "come back to her." His questioning Miriam as to why she does not " do things" reflects the frustration that Paul often feels with the girl's intensity and religious temperament. Clearly the episode "works" in regard to its possessing thematic coherence to the rest of chapter 7. Yet the scene does not add discernable perception or tangible information to the chapter. Omission of such a scene justifies Schorer's general judgment of Garnett's job as editor of Sons and Lovers : "Nothing important is lost, ineptitudes disappear, and the novel emerges as tighter and more smoothly paced than it would otherwise have been" (9). Garnett deleted other passages from chapter 7, however, whose presence in the printed text contribute considerably to our view of Paul and his young life. For example, in the printed version of the chapter, just before Paul tells his mother that he intends to teach algebra to Miriam, Garnett deletes a brief conversation between Paul and his mother. Recalling Miriam's professed dissatisfaction with her role as a female, Paul asks Mrs. Morel: "Did you want to be a man, mother?" Mrs. Morel replies that, yes, she has wished at times to be a man, because "I thought I could make a great deal better job of it than most men do." Paul replies that he certainly does not "want to be a woman." He also tells his mother that he believes she would have been a successful man. Mrs. Morel responds to this remark with a "little amused sniff," asserting that "anything that is natural is pleased to be itself. And where a woman wants very badly to be a man, you may back your life she's not much good as a woman." Such desire, she theorizes, reveals that a female's "pride as a woman is pretty low." The scene concludes with the narrator's remark that "He [Paul] always came to his mother, making her the touchstone" (MS 222). In many respects this scene, like the one considered earlier, amplifies themes presented elsewhere in the chapter and novel. For instance, the insight into Mrs. Morel's momentary desires to alter her gender serves to enlarge an already firm sense of her estrangement from a drunken husband. Similarly, Mrs. Morel's opinion about a woman who wants badly to be a man, appearing in the chapter just after Miriam's expressed dissatisfaction with her role as woman (154-155), creates a stark contrast between Miriam as a woman and Mrs. Morel's concept of what a woman should be, a contrast that makes only more explicit a sense of Paul's suspension between these conflicting yet strangely similar women. In fact, the contrast suggests a telling parallel between Miriam and Mrs. Morel: each is unhappy with her role and status as a woman, yet each pulls at Paul, largely because of this unhappiness. Recognition of such a parallel, however, certainly does not hinge solely on this deleted scene; rather, the deleted scene magnifies the chapter's implicit comparison of Mrs. Morel to Miriam. 11 Yet the scene holds a thematic element largely new to the printed text of "Lad-And-Girl Love." For instance, what relation does Paul's professed desire not to be a woman bear to the scene that occurs much later in the novel's manuscript (in a passage deleted from the printed version) in which Paul puts on Clara Dawes' stockings (MS 472)? Paul's expressed dissatisfaction with the though of being a female may also help to explain his repeated irritations with Miriam, as when he helps her with algebra. Paul's annoyance stems not only from frustrated and suppressed desires, but as well from an inherent dissatisfaction with the female sex as a gender. This thematic concern is further developed in a section of the algebra scene deleted by Garnett. During Miriam's mathematical stupefaction her brother Edgar enters, looks at the lesson from behind them, and exclaims, "I see." The manuscript continues: "Paul looked round at his friend. Edgar was good-looking, and his brown eyes, sound and healthy, looked interested. It was like breathing fresh air, to explain to him" (MS 224). Inherent in Paul's response lies a frustrated dissatisfaction with the intellectual capabilities of Miriam, the female: "You don't learn algebra with your blessed soul. Can't you look at it with your clear simple wits?" he exclaims in the printed text, soon after the deleted passage (156). At the same time Paul experiences an immediate attraction to the "clear simple wits" manifested in Edgar—wits which, as the narrator in the manuscript suggests, Paul perceives in terms of physical attractiveness. Together, these two scenes add to chapter 7 a firm sense of Paul's admiration for the male sex's intellect, an admiration informed by an appreciation of male physical beauty. These elements in Paul's character contribute a meaningful dimension to our early view of him. They also offer a subtle clue as to why and how Paul manages to continue with Miriam on a plane of abstraction for as long as he does. In effect, as early as chapter 7, the manuscript reveals a complexity of sexuality within Paul that becomes increasingly fascinating as it evolves in Paul's relationship with his father and Baxter Dawes. Though a small scene, it supports Mark Spilka's judgment that some of Garnett's "deletions might have been retained" (44). 12 Garnett deletes another scene of thematic importance to chapter 7—a passage of considerable length, comprising four full pages of manuscript. This scene occurs at a point in the chapter immediately after the narrator tells of Paul's drawing "life-warmth" and strength from his mother and "intensity" from Miriam (158), just before we are told of Miriam's taking Paul through the dusk for "the communion she wanted" to experience in front of the secret "wild-rose bush she had discovered" (159-160). The deleted scene in question concerns Paul's weekly trip to the subscription library at Bestwood, where he and Miriam have established a regular point of rendezvous. The evening of the scene is a wet one. In fact, rain falls so heavily that Paul begins to fear that Miriam will not meet him that evening. Mr. Sleath and Mr. Smedley, librarians, tease Paul about using the library as a courting ground. "Hello Paul! . . . Not found what you want yet, eh!" cries Mr. Sleath. "It's not books as Paul's waiting for, I think," inserts Mr. Smedley, continuing: "I think there's a young lady at the back of it. . . . But it's a bad night to come from Willey Woods" (MS 228). While the manuscript does not disclose Paul's immediate reaction to these witticisms, a deleted passage explicitly makes the point that Paul suffers intense anxiety at the possibility that Miriam might not appear: Perhaps Miriam would not come because of the rain. He gazed at the book in his hand, did not see it for some moments, thinking of her, then saw it again. The time went by like a sleep. There were noises of people going, no one entered. If she did not come? Then at the thought, he could see the night ahead, dreary and profitless. But she would come. It still felt warm and rich, just in front, and night went no further than the moment when she would arrive. (MS 228) A footstep sounds and a young man enters the library. The manuscript continues: "When Paul saw the lad in the doorway where she should have been, he hated him. Yet she would come. She was so dependable" (MS 228). The narrator continues by explaining that Miriam's not being "held by conventions" is one of her "great charms for the youth" (MS 228). As Paul continued to wait for her arrival, "He clung to the hope of her. He could feel her, across the night, wanting to come. And she never failed him" (MS 228-29). As with every deleted passage of chapter 7, much of this scene elaborates elements already present in the chapter. In particular, the scene reminds us of the disparity between what others expect to develop naturally between Paul and Miriam and the relationship that really exists between them. In this regard, the scene weakly mirrors one in the printed text where Paul returns home from a similar evening jaunt with Miriam from the library, where his mother asserts: "'Besides'—her voice suddenly flashed into anger and contempt—'it is disgusting—bits of lads and girls courting'" (161). "It is not courting," Paul answers, but to no purpose. His mother does not hear or understand his denial. No one can understand. In this respect the deleted library scene adds nothing of vital importance to our understanding of the "chaste" relationship between Paul and Miriam. Yet Paul's intense desire for Miriam's presence represents an element of the scene not similarly developed elsewhere in the chapter. We detect enormous urgency in the youth as he ponders whether Miriam will come, and we sense that something far more important is being determined in Paul's mind than simply whether he will have Miriam's company that evening. Forces exert themselves on the young man from sources beyond his conscious realm of action and reaction. While he waits, his existence becomes so identified with the expectation of her arrival that he does not respond to Mr. Smedley's teasing. He merely gazes in a trance-like state at the book in his hands, feeling an irrational hatred for the boy who enters the library, merely because this boy is not Miriam. Such anxiety renders Paul's personality virtually impotent. His power of being, centered in the sense of communion he feels with Miriam, clings "to the hope of her" as he feels her "across the night, wanting to come" (MS 228-229). Paul's anxiety stems partly from a fear of being unable fully to control Miriam. "Yet she would come. . . . And she had never failed him" (MS 228-229), Paul thinks, suggesting that her failure to come would somehow be a failure of the bond that links the two so powerfully. If we remember that this scene occurs in the manuscript immediately after the narrator's statement that Paul draws sustenance from two opposing forces—"From his mother he drew life-warmth, the strength to produce; Miriam urged this warmth into intensity"—the essential nature of the linking bond becomes clearer. The deleted library scene depicts Paul experiencing acute need for what Miriam provides. She sparks Paul's intellectual life in a way he craves. Even though Paul's relationship with Miriam will undergo transformation as the novel evolves, the fact that here Paul intensely desires Miriam's presence signifies that she indeed fulfills a need in him—whether that need be conscious or unconscious, healthy or neurotic. Within the scope of the entire novel Miriam represents only a stage in Paul's personal development. Given his family and psychological background, Paul's anxiety during the library scene suggests that this stage represents an inevitable step toward maturity. Thus their non-sexual relationship provides a comfort and safety similar to Paul's relationship with his mother. At the same time, the narrator reports that when with Miriam, Paul is "stimulated into knowledge of the work he had produced unconsciously [while with his mother]. In contact with Miriam he gained insight; his vision went deeper" (158). The deleted library scene exposes Paul's desperate need for such vision and insight at the precise juncture of his life portrayed in "Lad-And-Girl Love." The threat posed by Miriam's momentary failure to meet Paul at the library—the threat of losing the part of his spiritual sustenance represented by Miriam—is not expressed elsewhere in chapter 7 in nearly so full and touching a manner. The manuscript's library scene does not end here, and the remaining material serves to illustrate precisely what Miriam offers Paul. The moment she arrives at the library, "A flame came up in her [eyes] that burned him too." After an exchange concerning her "usual" tardiness, the couple leaves, their conversation shifting to the discussion of a book: "He held forth passionately, she listened and her soul expanded" (MS 229). Shifting from the book, their conversation "inevitably came to a discussion of beliefs, very intimate." The manuscript continues: "It seems as if it didn't matter, one more or less, among the lot," he said. "No," she replied, gravely, questioning. "I used to believe that about a sparrow falling and hair of the head—" "Yes," she said. "And now?" "Now I think that the race of sparrows matters, but not one sparrow: all my hair, but not one hair." "Yes," she said, questioningly. "And people matter. But one isn't so very important. Look at William." "Yes," she pondered. "I call it only wasted," he said. "Waste, no more." "Yes," she said, very low. It was her belief that the more people there were, the less they mattered. But to hear him talk was like life to her: like starting the breathing in a new born baby. "Yet," he said, "I reckon we've got a proper way to go—and if we go it, we're all right—and if we go near it. But if we go wrong we die. I'm sure our William went wrong somewhere." "And if we follow the course of our lives, we don't die?" she asked. "No we don't. What we are inside makes us so that we ought to go one particular way, and no other." "But do we know when we're following the true course?" she asked. "Yes! I do. I know I'm following mine." "You do?" she asked. "Yes—I'm certain." (MS 229-30) This scene's value lies on several levels. First, it offers a concrete illustration of Paul's belief that only Miriam can at this time fulfill his special needs. More than merely echo his ideas, Miriam helps Paul to discover and articulate them. Coming immediately after Paul's moments of anxiety in the library, the deleted scene establishes a pattern of relationship that would affect our reading of every such exchange later in the chapter and the novel had it been retained in the book's text. Miriam does not merely possess or enfold Paul as she tries to enfold her younger brother Hubert, an act against which Paul recoils in repugnance and hatred (153). A genuine psychic reward exists for Paul in Miriam's presence—one powerful enough to prompt his suspension of blood passion so that the reward will continue. Within the larger context of Sons and Lovers , Paul's inability for so long to sever the relationship with Miriam lies precisely in this psychic link between them: she nurtures his inner needs. The scene deleted by Garnett makes quite clear the fact that this bond is both real and mutual. The philosophical ideas expressed in the scene—concerning the race of sparrows, the waste of human life involved in his brother William's death, and the avowal that he is following and always will follow his proper direction—add to our perception of Paul. We gain a definite sense of Paul as a being in transition. By placing his philosophy so close to the scene of his anxious waiting in the library, the narrative consciousness of Sons and Lovers foreshadows his later development. For instance, in this scene Paul reveals that he hates the waste involved in following any life direction other than the "proper" one for the individual. The disparity between what he says and what he fails to see in his own life may amuse us. Yet when we consider such disparity in light of Paul's spoken philosophy, we not only conclude that his self-realization is just beginning, but grasp that he will follow his inner promptings in a less wasteful direction when he recognizes that such emotion as he expended in the library is a waste. In essence, the scene holds the promise of Paul's movement away from Miriam, and suddenly we gain fresh insight into his anxiety in the library. Paul both understands Miriam's ability to foster his formative ideas into consciousness and words, and fears that he will be unable to vocalize these philosophical notions that contain, paradoxically, the seeds of what will eventually carry him away from her. From this perspective, the scene provides an early foreshadowing of a fundamental characteristic in Paul's relationship with Miriam: his capacity to consume from her the sustenance he needs, only to relinquish the relationship when that nourishment no longer sustains his "proper way." The two deleted scenes considered above are linked implicitly to the proof emendations made to the chapter's final scene. 13 In both versions the scene's action remains largely the same: an evening stroll with Miriam at Skegness, beneath a suddenly glimpsed red moon. In the details of the scene, however, sweeping alterations occur, particularly in the scenes' descriptions of Miriam. In the manuscript, Miriam stands beside Paul "forever like his attendant angel. Her face, slightly golden with moonlight, was lifted towards him: the same stillness, the same humility about the closed mouth, the same pure look of faith and yearning in her dark eyes" (MS 254). At this moment of the scene, intended by Lawrence to contrast the conflicting "soul" and "sense" of the young man and woman, the considerable detail of Miriam's description suggests in her a force latent with religious authority: "Her spiritual, yearning look was like an invisible power which he could not get past" (MS 254). The printed version is much changed. Miriam "was watching him unseen. But she was brooding. She was slightly afraid—deeply moved and religious. That was her best state. He was impotent against it" (178). Youthfulness and sexual longing course through Paul's veins as he responds to the ruddy moon and Miriam's physical presence. By means of her spiritual intensity, however, Miriam manages to project a barrier that Paul cannot scale. She renders him "impotent" to assert the life force that is pulsing within him. Other proof emendations also appear to have been introduced by Lawrence. For example, in both the manuscript and the printed text, during their moonlight walk Miriam expects "a religious state" to be exhibited by Paul. In the manuscript, Paul "wanted the answer of her blood to his. But it never came" (MS 254). Also in the manuscript, when Miriam asks Paul for the second time "What is it?" he answers not with a frown, but by "showing his teeth in a constrained smile" (MS 254). The published text, however, adds to the scene Miriam's intuitive knowledge that "The crisis was past" (178). The manuscript's "she seemed, in some way, better than he" (MS 254) has also been emended to "she seemed in some way to make him despise himself" (179). Finally, in the published version, Paul decides that he hates Miriam because "she spoilt his ease and naturalness" (179), not because, as in the manuscript, she "spoilt his relationship with his mother" (MS 255). These revisions represent only some of the changes made to the closing scene of chapter 7, yet they indicate the direction in which Lawrence intends to take the scene. Miriam's portrayal suggests that she is less a person than a force capable of controlling Paul, of rendering him impotent, both sexually and psychically, seemingly against his will. The conflict between the two is less a battering against an obstacle, demanding that her blood answer his, than a subtle emasculation of Paul's natural self. His actions and responses characterize a young man who is less a victim of frustration than a prisoner seeking escape. Finally, Miriam's conclusion that a "crisis" has passed reveals that during the evening walk she has perceived a very real threat to the power she holds over Paul. In effect, the scene's emendations suggest quite strongly a weakening of the influence held by Miriam over Paul, a weakening made more explicitly clear in Lawrence's revisions concerning the issue of Paul's hatred of Miriam. The emotion of hatred, of course, marks a consistent element in the intricacies of Paul's attachment to Miriam—for instance, his hatred for her when she smothers her younger brother Hubert with affection (153). The revisions pinpoint a different source for this hatred, however. In the printed text Paul despises Miriam for having "spoilt his ease and naturalness" (175) rather than for having spoiled the relationship with his mother. In effect, the textual changes clearly identify Paul as the victim of Miriam. Her religious intensity has held him physically and psychologically suspended until his natural instincts are denied, twisted, and "spoilt": He was afraid of her. The fact that he might want her as a man wants a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame. When she shrank in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul. And now this "purity" prevented even their first love-kiss. It was as if she could scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss, and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it. (178-179) The above passage is identical in both manuscript and printed text. But its impact is far more revelatory if we view the scene from the perspective that Lawrence himself is responsible for these revisions. The printed version suggests unmistakably a sense of Paul's being deeply wounded. Impotence becomes a manifestation of his self-despising. The fact that such feelings exist in Paul further suggests the possibility, if not the inevitability, that the relationship he presently enjoys with Miriam must change. Emendations made to the novel's proofs restore implicitly to the final scene many ideas that were explicitly developed in the deleted passages examined above. For instance, draping Miriam in shadows rather than the angelic aura of moonlight obscures her feminine features and makes her less a breathing young female in the moonlight than a mysterious agent capable of undercutting Paul's masculinity. Her religious brooding becomes almost masculine in its insistence on excluding the possibility of passion—as though Miriam, in refusing to be fully "a woman" with Paul, insists on playing the role of a man, refusing to allow their relationship to exist on any plane other than "platonic" abstraction. Recall the deleted passage in which Mrs. Morel warns Paul about women who want "badly" to be men. Recall also that just as Mrs. Morel declares such women to have lost their "pride" as women, Paul here hates Miriam because she has caused him to "despise himself." Miriam has "spoilt [Paul's] naturalness and ease," a statement that not only evokes Mrs. Morel's advice that "anything that is natural is pleased to be itself" (MS 222) but also Paul's profession to Miriam that "I reckon we've got a proper way to go" (MS 230). When we note the added connotations of "impotence" in the revised scene, Paul's avowed contentment with being a man echoes resonantly. How can Paul attain his masculinity with a woman who seeks with devious intensity to deny such attainment? The "naturalness" of the relationship is skewed. Miriam assumes a controlling, an almost masculine power, while Paul, though flushed with sexual desire, submits to her control. Gender roles are reversed. The idea for such a reversal, first signaled in the deleted conversation between Paul and Mrs. Morel, is here powerfully suggested precisely by those revisions made after Garnett's deletions, almost certainly by Lawrence. Lawrence can also be credited with incorporating important features of the deleted library scene into the galley revisions of chapter 7. We recall Paul's intense anxiety while waiting for Miriam to arrive at the library—in itself a kind of impotence. Miriam's ability on their Skegness walk to inspire Paul's suppression of sexual urges suggests the power of the bond between the two. Although the relationship with Miriam reaches a point of excruciating discomfort to Paul, at Skegness he cannot perceive its unnaturalness or waste. As in the library scene, Paul's wasted emotion itself holds the essential clue to the eventual disintegration of "Lad-And-Girl Love." Here, the shame that Paul feels for his shackled masculinity holds the potential, once realized, of propelling him away from the "waste" and into the "proper way" for his life. In this sense the galley revisions surrounding Paul's moonlight walk with Miriam introduce the momentum for movement away from an essentially wasteful situation. We gain from the revised narrative an increased sense of Paul as a being in transition, whose "hatred" for Miriam has been modified in its essence. From this modification the inference follows that Paul, as he declares during the walk subsequent to the deleted library scene, will follow his "proper way" as his self-awareness increases. Further, for Miriam to sense during the Skegness walk that a "crisis" has occurred and is now past informs us that she views Paul as an essentially undynamic person. She does not take fully into account his capability to change. As the narrative progresses from this point we realize that "the crisis" has actually just begun—that is, the conflict in Paul between his "soul" and his "sense" now approaches a point of consciousness within him. Significantly, following Miriam's determination that the crisis with Paul is over, Lawrence ceases almost altogether to use Miriam as a focus of narrative perspective. Instead, we are shown Miriam through the perception of Paul: "He hated her, for she seemed in some way to make him despise himself" (179). To compensate for the possibility of Paul's movement away from Miriam, as subtly suggested in the deleted library scene, Lawrence has chosen to signal this same possibility by restricting narrative point of view. Paul's search for freedom of the life-urge away from Miriam's spiritual tyranny is a process complex enough to comprise much of Sons and Lovers . Lawrence's apparent revision of the final scene of "Lad-And-Girl Love" explicitly foreshadows this development, much as the deleted library scene does. Lawrence's purpose in preparing "corrections" of chapter 7 of Sons and Lovers appears clear. Several of the scenes deleted by Garnett in the interest of saving space were considered by Lawrence to contribute meaningfully to the evocation of Paul Morel's emotional ambivalence and turmoil. In making final revisions of the galleys for the novel's published version, Lawrence worked to restore to chapter 7 something of the substance lost by Garnett's deletions. Much in chapter 7 reinforces Schorer's judgment that little is lost in Sons and Lovers as a result of Garnett's deletions. Yet we must conclude that in chapter 7, without Lawrence's emendations, something would have been lost—namely, an awareness of how the disintegration of Paul and Miriam's relationship is subtly, but unmistakably, signaled at a point in the narrative as early as "Lad-And-Girl Love." We may conclude that the power of chapter 7 indeed owes much to Garnett's editing, but not only in the editor's justified removal of narrative and thematic redundancies. Unknowingly, Garnett also challenged the young Lawrence to perfect his narrative craft. Chapter 7 reveals the success with which Lawrence met this challenge. The extent to which Lawrence's final revisions of the entire novel represent a similar effort to return much that he felt was lost by Garnett's deletions remains a subject for further exploration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Other than the Sons and Lovers manuscript itself, only two remnants of manuscript related to Sons and Lovers exist, both of which represent fragments of the Paul Morel novels. The first set of these consists of six holograph manuscript fragments from chapters 1-4 of Lawrence's final revision of Paul Morel —the version termed by Schorer the "penultimate version" of Sons and Lovers . These fragments total approximately 58 pages and are written on paper smaller in size than most of the pages used in the Sons and Lovers manuscript. Lawrence's own revisions constitute the sole editorial markings on these pages. He indicated these revisions by a horizontal line drawn through each word or passage he wished to cancel. Substitutions occasionally appear, written in Lawrence's hand over the cancellations. Schorer's edition of the Sons and Lovers manuscript facsimile reproduces these fragments, and they reside in the Rare Books Collection of the Bancroft Library, at the University of California, Berkeley, along with the Sons and Lovers manuscript. Schorer dates these fragments to the fall of 1911. Another set of manuscript fragments from early versions of the Paul Morel novel exists at the Humanities Research Center of the University of Texas. Termed by Moore the "Miriam Papers," Moore assigns these manuscripts to 1911-1912, and describes them as falling "into two parts. One of these parts comprises three manuscript sections in Jessie Chambers' own hand; the second part of the Miriam Papers consists of two sections: one is a twenty-three page fragment of manuscript in Lawrence's hand, with Jessie's interlinear comments and protests; the other is a separate four pages of comments in her hand" ( D. H. Lawrence 285). Moore also notes that one of the fragments in Chambers' hand "provides the basis for the episode which occurs in chapter 7—'Lad-And-Girl Love'—and describes one of Paul's arrivals at Willey Farm and an encounter with Miriam and her sister Agatha" (286). For a detailed assessment of the Miriam Papers see Moore, D. H. Lawrence , 285-305. 2 This scenario is based on Lawrence's letter to Garnett, 1 December 1912, in which he responds to the editor's proposed deletions: "I sit in sadness and grief after your letter. I daren't say anything. All right, take out what you think necessary—I suppose I shall see what you've done when the proofs come, at any rate. I'm sorry I've let you in for such a job—but don't scold me too hard, it makes me wither up" ( Letters 481). 3 The facsimile manuscript reproduces revisions made to the manuscript by Lawrence. Lawrence indicated deletions in the manuscript by drawing a single horizontal line through the passages he wished to cancel. These deletions are estimated by Schorer to total approximately two thousand words (Introduction 4). Occasional substitutions are written in Lawrence's own hand above the cancellations, with a pen somewhat more finely nibbed than the original. Although these revisions offer a fascinating glimpse into Lawrence's development as a writer, they represent Lawrence's final draft of Sons and Lovers and, as such, fall outside the present study's focus on the Lawrence-Garnett editorial relationship. 4 More particularly, each of Garnett's deletions is indicated in the manuscript by the editor's use of a large X crossed through the passage to be cut, a single extended brace enclosing either the right or the left side of the large X, and a delete sign placed in the page margin, outside the brace, beside the cancelled passage. Schorer estimates that Garnett's deletions total "at least ten or even fifteen thousand words" (Introduction 4). Garnett is consistent in his editorial markings, although he is somewhat idiosyncratic in their application. Differences, therefore, arise as to how Garnett's symbols should be described. According to Templeton, Garnett's markings are "marginal parentheses and the letter 'G'," a view for which he claims the authority of Garnett's son, David, who, according to Templeton, "saw the manuscript and . . . was familiar with his father's handwriting and editing style" (236). I believe Templeton to be inexact in his assessment of Garnett's markings. First, Templeton ignores the prominent X's that invariably mark the passages Garnett selected for deletion. Second, the term "brace" is more accurate than "marginal parentheses" to describe the vertical mark with which Garnett consistently enclosed a single side of the large X drawn through each deleted passage: these marks always occur singly, loop at the center, and almost always curve at their ends away from the text. Third, the marginal symbol placed outside each brace more closely resembles a delete symbol than the letter "G." Schorer agrees with this assessment of the symbol, stating that Garnett's cuts "were made with large X-figures and a signal to delete in the margin." It is interesting that Schorer also cites David Garnett as an authority for interpreting the elder Garnett's editorial markings: "Garnett's son, David, has examined a copy of this manuscript and is certain that, with the possible exception of two, these [markings] were made by his father" (MS 4). (The two exceptions mentioned by Schorer appear on MS 292-93, and are indicated by horizontal lines through the deleted text and large multiple X's. According to Schorer and David Garnett, these deletions should be attributed to Lawrence; the multiple X's represent Edward Garnett's confirmation of the cancellations.) 5 Lawrence refers here to the galley proofs. When on 14 April 1913 Lawrence writes to Garnett that he has returned "all the proofs of Sons and Lovers ," he refers specifically to the novel's page proofs ( Letters 539). None of these proofs are extant; therefore, we cannot say with certainty whether Lawrence's emendations were made to the galley or to the page proofs. Since Lawrence states that he "corrected" both galley and page proofs, however, we may infer that emendations were effected during both stages of the editorial process. 6 Commentators generally agree that Garnett's excisions meritoriously affected the final version of Sons and Lovers . For instance, Schorer asserts: "Every deletion that Garnett made seems to me have been to the novel's advantage" (Introduction 9). In a similar vein, Eggert argues that "Garnett cut not just to shorten but to improve" (56). Templeton echoes Schorer's judgment, calling Garnett's editing "masterful" and "thorough," adding the view that Garnett's "deletions rather than Lawrence's emendations are what turned a pedestrian . . . manuscript into a powerful, concise, and evenly developed novel" (243). Only Spilka disagrees with these assessments, suggesting "that many [of Garnett's] deletions reveal ideas and preoccupations which helped Lawrence to become the man whose prophetic artspeech still commands our hearing; . . . some of these deletions might have been retained. . . ." (136). The present study finds general agreement with Spilka's argument that true literary value exists in some of the scenes deleted by Garnett. As my analysis shows, Lawrence, too, must have felt the value of many of these scenes. However, in my effort to demonstrate that Lawrence actively sought to emend the galley and page proofs in such a manner as to restore much of the deleted scenes' thematic values, I offer a thesis that differs essentially from Spilka's assessment of Garnett's editorial deletions. 7 Commentators disagree in how to approach this issue. Schorer judges virtually nothing to have been lost in any of the deletions that may have been made by Duckworth (Introduction 4). Templeton's decision not to discuss these emendations, "[i]n light of their indeterminable authorship" (240), seems to me extreme. 8 Chapter 7 of Sons and Lovers is admirably suited for such an analysis. Virtually one-fifth of the printed chapter's text differs from the holograph manuscript reproduced in the facsimile. Further, these differences encompass both types of major textual differences that appear in the novel: (1) short and long passages deleted by Garnett, and (2) numerous emendations that appear in the printed text but not in the manuscript. As the initial chapter in Part II of Sons and Lovers , chapter 7 marks a thematic pivot in the novel: the first extensive effort to portray Paul Morel's emergence into emotional and sexual experience beyond the pale of his family. In its size, the chapter makes possible a detailed textual analysis in a study of this length. For a helpful, though incomplete, table of significant textual variants, see Schorer's facsimile edition, 609-624. 9 Schorer makes clear his judgment that the extensive deletions by Garnett were in no way prompted by moralistic concerns. Rather, the editor tried to keep Lawrence's manuscript to a length practicable for a one-volume publication. 10 Garnett deleted other such scenes from chapter 7, on 241, 242, 243, 251, and 252 of the manuscript facsimile. I consider these scenes, like the fence-stile scene, to be of only minor significance and will not analyze them. Without exception, these scenes consist primarily of dialogue between Paul and his friends and family about matters of little relation to the chapter's major themes. The longest of these, on 241-242, portrays Paul's friends on an Easter Monday outing and consists largely of casual bantering. 11 See, for example, Weiss 39-67. 12 Spilka, in making this assessment, argues that Schorer's "inordinate satisfaction" with Garnett's editorial excisions "betrays [the] original misgivings about the novel" voiced in Schorer's 1948 "Technique as Discovery." He objects that such alterations "merely show Lawrence in the process of overcoming fairly obvious literary deficiencies" (34), and that some of Garnett's deletions represent loss to the novel. The present examination of chapter 7 differs from Spilka's assessment in its conclusion that Garnett's editorial excisions also spurred Lawrence to develop his narrative technique in order to compensate for the loss occasioned by some of these deletions. 13 Space will not allow an examination of two short paragraphs deleted by Lawrence himself (MS 234 and 248). The first of these describes Miriam's feelings of social contempt for a field full of folk encountered on her Good Friday outing with Paul and his family. Lawrence's intention in deleting this passage appears to be the removal of an element that deflects our attention from Miriam's anticipation of Paul's return to their private realm of existence. The second cancellation reveals Paul actively seeking to kiss and embrace the girlfriends of his sister Annie, though he is still emotionally embroiled in his "Lad-And-Girl Love" with Miriam. Lawrence's removal of this paragraph renders the "soul" vs. "sense" conflict within Paul less explicit. Works Cited Eggert, Paul. "Edward Garnett's Sons and Lovers ."

      <field name="heading_text">John Greenleaf Whittier in the Critic , 1881-1892 by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first volume of The Critic (January 15 to December 31, 1881), a new periodical edited by Jeannette Leonard Gilder and her brother Joseph, featured the first of a series, "How I Get Around at Sixty, and Take Notes," written by Walt Whitman. Whitman continued to write for The Critic , a number of his prose pieces appearing for the first time there. Other well-known American writers also contributed to the periodical, among them Joel Chandler Harris, Edmund C. Stedman, Julia Ward Howe, and James Lane Allen. Book reviews, many of them written by the editors but others by a growing number of regular reviewers, James Herbert Morse and W. J. Rolfe among them, were a regular and important feature of the new periodical. Occasional reviews were by such men of letters as Edward Everett Hale and Thomas R. Lounsbury. Much American and English poetry, either reprinted or making its first appearance, was published in The Critic . The periodical appealed to a fairly limited audience, being largely caviar to the general, and hence had a circulation of only about 5,000 for much of its existence. 1 What is of paramount importance for present purposes is the fact that few scholars have mined the treasures in the form of material printed for the first time in The Critic (original letters, essays, poems) or, very often, reprinted from some not easily accessible American or English periodical. 2 Prominent among the authors who have suffered from the neglect of The Critic on the part of literary critics, historians, and biographers is John Greenleaf Whittier. It is the intent of this article to repair that neglect. Thomas Franklin Currier's Bibliography of John Greenleaf Whittier (hereafter Currier), published by the Harvard University Press in 1937, has been described by the editors of the Literary History of the United States as "one of the finest single-author American bibliographies." Whittier studies were also considerably advanced by the splendid edition of his letters, published in three volumes by the Belknap Press of Harvard University in 1975 and edited by John B. Pickard (hereafter Letters ). Finally, long in the making, the definitive biography, John Greenleaf Whittier: a Biography (hereafter Life ), by Mr. Roland Woodwell, was published in 1985 in Haverhill, Mass. by the Trustees of the John Greenleaf Whittier (hereafter JGW) Homestead. I want to add from The Critic some snippets and possibly some larger bits to these three works. I shall quote, wholly or in part, and sometimes cite, pieces which are not listed in Currier or treated less extensively in the Life . And I shall quote more extensively from those letters of JGW printed in The Critic but not appearing in the Letters . An autobiographical sketch, reprinted from the Boston Herald , appeared not long before JGW's death and has been overlooked by students of his life and writings. It deserves full quotation. Professor Pickard states in the Introduction to his edition of the Letters that "Volume III selects 527 letters from the years 1861 through 1892, representing the main aspects of Whittier's personality during these later years. Letters to the editor and brief articles or notes written for insertion in newspapers are included, except when such communications were clearly intended to be longer essays or finished prose compositions" (pp. xxiii-xxiv). I have come upon some twenty letters, quoted wholly or in part, and reference to two or three more, in The Critic in the years 1881-1892, that period in which the edition of the Letters is selective rather than exhaustive. It should be noted, for what follows, that after the first three volumes (1881-1883), each covering a full year, The Critic started a New Series, each volume covering six months. In a piece on Axel Gustafson, quoted in N.S. 2 (1884), Mr. Dole of the Philadelphia Press wrote that Axel "married Mrs. Zadel Barnes Buddington, a lady originally from Connecticut, whose 'Meg, a Pastoral,' was declared by the poet Whittier to be excelled only by Milton's 'Lycidas'." Miss Gilder, commenting in her column, "The Lounger," wrote "I wonder if Mr. Whittier did really say such a thing as that. It seems incredible. Unless I hear it directly from the poet himself, I shall give him the benefit of the doubt" (p. 174). Soon thereafter Miss Gilder wrote that JGW, in a letter to her, touched on the matter: "Mrs. Axel Gustafson, has written well in prose and verse. But her 'Meg, a Pastoral' is a simple, unpretentious poem, which could by no possibility suggest comparison with Milton by myself or any one else. Her husband's late publication, an exhaustive and able study of the 'Drink Question,' is a very valuable contribution to the literature of Temperance, and deserves a wide circulation" (p. 185). All of which brought this reply from Mrs. Gustafson and the appended statement by Miss Gilder (pp. 282-283). To the Editors of The Critic: My attention has been called to a couple of paragraphs occurring under the heading of The Lounger, in The Critic for Oct. 18, from which it appears that Mr. Whittier has been reported as saying that my poem 'Meg, A Pastoral' was 'excelled only by Milton's "Lycidas.'" Soon after my book of verse entitled 'Meg, A Pastoral, and Other Poems' was published by Lee &amp; Shepard in 1878, Mr. Whittier wrote to me as follows—I am quoting from the letter itself as it lies before me, dated 'Amesbury, 12 mo, 24, 1878:' 'I have read "Meg" with delight. It is a charming New England Pastoral, very sweet and tender, and musical as the songs of our thrushes and song sparrows.' Small wonder that The Lounger, or any one else in his senses, should fail to understand a comparison between a poem thus described, and Milton's great threnody! But concerning the second poem in my volume, a tribute to William Cullen Bryant, Mr. Whittier's very next words in the same letter, are: 'But the elegy of Bryant! I can only compare it with Milton's "Lycidas;" it is worthy of any living poet at least.' That such expressions from such a source should have been, and should continue to be, one of the precious inspirations of my life, will not astonish any one who understands how intensely the younger poet desires to deserve the recognition of the elder. I wrote to Mr. Whittier for permission to furnish to certain editors the sentences from his letter, here given, to which he most kindly consented, and the comparison of the Bryant elegy to Milton's 'Lycidas' appeared in the New York Evening Post , in Mr. George Cary Eggleston's review of my book. Other journals also included it in their notices of it. I showed Mr. Whittier's letter to Mr. H. M. Alden, the editor of Harper's Magazine , and to Mr. Edwin P. Whipple, of Boston, both of whom warmly congratulated me upon it. Mr. Whipple used these words: 'If I had received this letter, I would put it between glass and frame it in gold.' Mr. Clement, of the Boston Evening Transcript , and Mr. Whiting, of The Springfield Republican , will, I think, also remember the facts, as they were cognizant of them at the time. Naturally enough, it was not so much to Mr. Whittier as it was to me; and it is not surprising that, some six years after having written it, he should—on being asked the bewildering question whether he had ever made a comparison between 'Lycidas' and 'Meg,' a love-story of the late American War—have quite forgotten the real connection in which he did make the comparison with 'Lycidas.' I shall be grateful to such American journals as may have copied or alluded to the mistaken version of the matter in The Critic if they will release me from the odious position of one accepting spurious praise, by also copying this letter. London, Nov. 13, 1884. Zadel Barnes Gustafson. [On Oct. 11 I said that Mr. Whittier had been accused of comparing 'Meg' with 'Lycidas,' but that I should give him the benefit of the doubt until he should plead guilty to the charge. A week later I stated that I had received a letter from the poet, in which he said that no one could dream of comparing the 'simple, unpretentious poem' with anything of Milton's. I neither made nor intended any reflection upon Mrs. Gustafson's position in the matter. On the contrary, I said that she should pray to be defended from the friends who had circulated the erroneous statement. Since Mrs. Gustafson's note was received, a note has come from Mr. Whittier confirming her statement of the case. JGW was invited to appear at a number of public functions; often, unable to attend, he wrote a letter for the occasion which was read to the other participants and guests. Given his early and lasting love for the poetry of Robert Burns, it is not surprising that on at least two occasions he was asked to attend memorials of one kind or another for him. In January 1885 a letter of JGW's was read before the Caledonian Club of Boston. He wrote, I scarcely needed thy kind invitation to remind me of the anniversary of Burns. It is a red-letter day in all our calendars. There is not a logger's camp in the Maine woods, nor a miner's hut in the Sierras, that will forget it. For one day at least we will all be Scotchmen. The great poet has made all the world his debtor. But what has he not done for Scotland? He has liberalized her hard theology and made it possible of rational belief. That the inspiration of his high genius is still moving the hearts of her children is seen in Janet Hamilton's "Effie" and Jean Morrison Miller's "Books of Ballads." Through him her dialect has become a universal language; her heather blooms on all hills, and her thistledown floats on all winds. I cannot join you in person, but my sympathy, like the "double" of an East Indian adept, shall be with you. (N.S. 3 [1885] 59) Some three years later, on August 30, 1888, he wrote another letter in praise of Burns, this time for the unveiling of a statue of that poet in Albany. For that occasion, he wrote, I greatly regret that I am unable to avail myself of the invitation to be present at the unveiling of the statue of Robert Burns on the 30th inst. I yield to no one in admiration and love for the great singer whose songs have girdled the world with music, dear alike to the highest culture and the lowest poverty and toil. A born democrat, his independent thought, his ardent love of literature and hatred of tyranny in the State and bigotry and intolerance in the Church, as expressed in his life and in his immortal lyric, 'The rank is but the guinea's stamp; The man's the gowd for a' that,' give them the right to stand among our noblest and worthiest. His songs of love and home and freedom are among the household treasures of Americans, loved in our halls of wealth and fashion and in the cabins of our miners and herdsmen from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Mexican frontier to northwest Alaska. Scotland may well be proud of her most illustrious son, but she will not forbid our adopting him. We take him to our hearts as he is, with the failings we regret, with the noble traits and marvellous gifts we honor. Suffice it that he is Robert Burns the only! As such, if I may be allowed to repeat my words at his centennial, 'Be every fault forgiven Of him in whom we joy; We take, with thanks, the gold of Heaven Even with the earth's alloy! Thanks for the music as of Spring, The sweetness as of flowers, The song the bard himself might sing In holier ears than ours!' (N.S. 10 [1888] 120) In 1885 JGW was invited to a reception for his old friend James Russell Lowell, to take place in Boston on Saturday, June 21, but he was "unavoidably absent." As was his wont, he wrote a letter to be read there: John G. Whittier presents his thanks for the invitation to join the friends of James Russell Lowell to welcome him on his return. He loves and honors his old friend so heartily that nothing but illness prevents him from being one of the first to welcome him. As it is, he can only express the joy that he comes back to us bearing from the Old World such honors as were never before bestowed upon a representative of our country. Hail and welcome! (N.S. 3 [1885] 311) A few years later, in celebration of Lowell's seventieth birthday, The Critic devoted the entire February 23, 1889, number to letters written for the occasion by some sixty well-known American and English authors. Among them was JGW, who wrote There are some people we would gladly always keep young. It is a personal grievance if we find them growing old. My friend James Russell Lowell has reached his three score and tenth year, but, from my standpoint, he is not too old to add to his already splendid reputation as a poet and critic, and as a representative man, whose worth and genius are acknowledged wherever our language is spoken. I have just been reading over again the inimitable description of our New England spring in his famous 'Biglow Papers.' It has never been so well told before. Indeed, the wit and wisdom of our country life have never been so admirably rendered as in the rhymes of Hosea of Jaalam. The droll quaintness of dialect and the rollicking humor and sarcasm of his verses were a power in the anti-slavery conflict. The boomerang of denunciation sometimes came back on the heads of those who hurled it, but Lowell's arrows hit their mark and stayed there. Among those who did good service in the cause of human freedom he deserves to be reckoned. Danvers, Mass., Feb. 16, 1889. John G. Whittier. (N.S. 11 [1889] 85) In 1891 he spoke to some Englishwomen temperance advocates who had come to visit him; among the topics of conversation was the American Woman's Christian Temperance Union ( Life , p. 516). In November of that same year Charles E. L. Wingate's column in The Critic , "Boston Letter," contained the following, another example of a letter written for an occasion. A fervent letter was that which the poet Whittier sent to the World's Women's Christian Temperance Union, during its meeting this past week in Boston. Though illness confined him to his house yet it did not confine the energies of his mind. 'I am very grateful and hopeful,' he wrote, referring to the great growth of the women's temperance movement; and then he exclaimed:— 'The little one has become a thousand; the handful of corn shake like Lebanon.' * * * You are conquering Old World masculine prejudice and proving the efficiency and necessity of the work of womanhood in the world's reform and progress. You have awakened that enthusiasm of humanity which wisely directed is irresistible. If the gigantic evil is still strong and defiant, you have saved many of its victims and the blessing of thousands of afflicted families is with you. That God may continue to bless you in your great endeavor is the desire of thy friend. A most encouraging letter was this, and one expressive of its author's steadfast sympathy with good causes. (N.S. 16 [1891] 282) The first sentence of JGW's letter to Phebe Woodman, dated November 20, 1891, "The Women's Convention at Boston has passed off and I have escaped from them, on the whole very well" ( Letters , III. 588), expresses his relief at not having attended the Convention. Two of the letters in The Critic are to friends whose names do not appear in the Life . The first, chronologically, is to Mrs. A. O. Boyce, who sent him a copy of her book, Records of a Quaker Family . My Dear Friend, I have read thy beautiful book with great satisfaction. As a truthful picture of the old Friendly life it seems to me perfect, and I give thee my heartfelt thanks for the privilege of reading it. Our dear Society seems changing and becoming more and more like the Calvinistic and other Dissenting Churches, both in doctrines and testimonies. But the good work it has done, and the simple exterior of its lives in the past, will not be forgotten by the world it has made better and sweeter. Gratefully, thy aged friend, John G. Whittier. 3 The second letter was written on November 7, 1891, but was published on January 30, 1892 (N.S., p. 72), after JGW's death. Mr. Woodwell records that in 1890 JGW, "like Dr. Thomas [a Quaker minister], opposed the pastoral system which was making its way into Friends meetings and, along with the increasing use of music, was making them like other Protestants, especially the Methodists. Whittier wrote 'and the Quaker singing is dolefully bad. I am too old-fashioned to bear it with patience'" ( Life , p. 508). Next year, in the letter which, with its headnote I now quote, JGW had kind words for Methodism. I print for its timeliness the following letter from the venerable poet, Mr. John G. Whittier, addressed on Nov. 7 to his friend Mr. Thomas Snape, County Counsellor of Liverpool, in reference to the business of the Methodist Conference in Washington:— My dear Friend: I am glad to know that the all-important subject of peace and arbitration will come before the great world conference of Methodists at Washington. War involves the violation of every precept of the Divine Master. As John Wesley said of slavery at a time when it was tolerated and practised by all Christian nations, [it] is 'the sum of all wickedness.' I cannot but hope that the time is not far off, when the zeal, self-sacrifice, and indomitable energy which have made Methodism a power in the world, shall be directed against the dreadful evil. I am glad to see by the program of the conference that the English Peace Society will be represented by one so well qualified as thyself to speak for the good cause. Under circumstances of age and infirmity I can only bid thee God speed, and pray that the time may not be far distant when the Christian Churches of all sects will unite in efforts to make war no longer possible. I am, very faithfully, thy friend, John G. Whittier. (N.S. 7 [1886] 217) The Life makes no mention of the Conference or of Snape, nor does Snape's name appear anywhere in the Letters or in Currier. On November 20, 1891, JGW wrote to Phebe Woodman telling her, among other news, that he had sent two books and a letter to "a great Methodist Fair" and that they sold for a total of $400, $200 of which went to "the Methodist Mission in Alaska (I wish it had gone to the Quaker one)" ( Letters , III. 588), thus putting the letter to Snape in context. In 1830 the young JGW had become editor of the Hartford, Connecticut New England Weekly Review and, I quote the Life , "became friendly with many interesting young people, including Frederick A. P. Barnard, afterwards president of Columbia College, to whom he dedicated 'Miriam' forty years later" (p. 41). Upon Barnard's death in 1889 JGW wrote to the editors of The Critic (N.S., pp. 227-228): I have just heard of the death of President Barnard. It ends, so far as his life is concerned, the unbroken friendship of sixty years which has existed between us. I knew him first as a tutor in Yale College, and afterwards in Hartford, Ct., when he was a teacher in the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, in 1830-31. I was at that time the editor of The New England Review . We became strongly attached friends. A scholar of rare acquirements, brilliant, graceful and handsome, surrounded by admirers of both sexes, he was unassuming and unpretentious, and bore himself then, as ever after, as a perfect gentleman. He wrote occasionally for my paper in prose and verse. I remember one or two imitations of Hafiz and other Persian poets, full of grace and rhythmic sweetness. Had he devoted himself to literature, I am sure he would easily have won high distinction. But he decided otherwise, I think wisely. His life work as an educator cannot be too highly estimated, for none was ever more faithfully and successfully performed. He leaves behind him a noble reputation, and will be followed to his rest by the love and reverence of all who knew him. AMESBURY, 30th April 1889. JOHN G. WHITTIER. Barnard's biographer quotes a letter of Barnard's to a friend which reveals something of the closeness of his friendship with JGW. Barnard had loaned JGW a volume of Coleridge, Shelley, and Keats and told his friend that "Whit left the vol. in a wretched condition—and if it is not demolished by this time, I hold myself lucky." 4 Five letters remain, only three of which deal with some as aspect of JGW's poetry. In November 1890 he wrote to William Hosea Ballou to express his shock and indignation at having been "made so conspicuous as an apparent endorser of a book which seems in the interest of lottery, gambling and liquor dealers. . . . What business my name and portrait have in the book except as a lure and device, I cannot imagine." Professor Pickard notes that "Whittier's portrait had apparently appeared in a book that contained advertisements for a Louisiana lottery. Pickard [Samuel, JGW's biographer] in his notes to the letter says it was sent to Ballou, who was the publisher of the book" ( Letters , III. 580 and n.). The Critic for April 14, 1891, quoted, in part, a letter of JGW's printed in America, a Journal for Americans, Devoted to honest politics and good literature , published in Chicago, in which the poet expresses himself as "shocked and indignant" that his name was in any way "connected with a publication, which, in the guise of a story, excuses and defends lottery gambling." The book was identified as to title, The Upper Ten , and author, Ballou, and was said to be dedicated to JGW. JGW was further quoted to the effect that "There seems to be no way to protect one's self from such an outrage, but I have the consolation of believing that all who know me will feel sure that I regard it with unqualified detestation" (N.S. 15, p. 189). The existence of two strongly worded letters bears testimony to JGW's extreme displeasure. In January 1886 The Critic noted that "The date of his birth having been called in question recently, Mr. Whittier wrote 'I cannot say positively from my personal knowledge when I was born but my mother told me it was on the 17th of December, 1807, and she was a truthful woman'" (N.S. 5, p. 21), and December 17, 1807, it has remained. JGW had written to the editor of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine from "Amesbury, 6 Mo., 1886," his letter appearing in the September number (p. 783) and being reprinted in the The Critic that same month. Mr. Whittier and Barbara Frietchie. My attention has been called to an article in the June number of The Century , in which the writer, referring to the poem on Barbara Frietchie, says: 'The story will perhaps live, as Mr. Whittier has boasted, until it gets beyond the reach of correction.' Those who know me will bear witness that I am not in the habit of boasting of anything whatever, least of all, of congratulating myself upon a doubtful statement outliving the possibility of correction. I certainly made no 'boast' of the kind imputed to me. The poem of Barbara Frietchie was written in good faith. The story was no invention of mine. It came to me from sources which I regarded as entirely reliable; it had been published in newspapers, and had gained public credence in Washington and Maryland before my poem was written. I had no reason to doubt its accuracy then, and I am still constrained to believe that it had foundation in fact. If I thought otherwise I should not hesitate to express it. I have no pride of authorship to interfere with my allegiance to truth.—(N.S. 6 [1886] 130) The remaining two letters were printed in January and March, 1892. I have not identified the R. H. Howard of Franklin to whom the following letter was written, although a likely candidate is Rowland Bailey Howard, if one suspects an error in the middle initial as printed in The Critic , secretary of the American Peace Society, to whom JGW had written on Nov. 9, 1887 ( Letters , III. 539-540). An interesting letter written by Mr. Whittier three years ago is in the hands of Mr. R. H. Howard of Franklin, and the reference bears upon the poem 'Christ in the Tempest,' composed many years ago and published in one of the school-readers of 1850, but not reprinted in the poet's collected work. Mr. Howard inquired the reason for this omission and received this reply from Mr. Whittier:— Danvers, Mass., Sept. 21, 1888. Dear Friend: The poem referred to in thy letter was written by me. It was for some reason omitted by my publisher; I think because it was not thought valuable in a merely literary point of view. I had not seen it for a long time; but I have just hunted it up, and find it better than many things which are in my collected poems. The storm on the little lake may have been exaggerated; but, as a whole, the piece is not altogether unworthy, certainly so far as the sentiment is concerned. I am truly thy friend, John G. Whittier. (N.S. 17, p. 10) The last of the letters is to an unidentified English correspondent and is undated. "Whittier writes [note the tense] 'I have never desired or hoped to found a school of poetry, nor even written with the definite object of influencing others to follow my example: I have only written as the spirit came and went, often unable to give utterance to the best poems that were in my heart, the utterance being holden; but it has been the crowning joy of a prolonged old age that my life has not been completely valueless, and that I have been allowed to see the end of slavery in my country.'" (N.S. 18 [1892] 81) When in 1888 JGW learned that slavery had been abolished in Brazil by act of Parliament he sent the following cable to the Emperor of Brazil, then in Milan: "With thanks to God, who has blessed your generous efforts, I congratulate you on the peaceful abolition of slavery in Brazil" (N.S. 9, p. 83). The two had met ( Life , p. 411), and Don Pedro had translated some of JGW's poetry into Portuguese. While these letters in their totality are of no little importance, they are overshadowed by an autobiographical sketch reprinted from the Boston Herald , which has been overlooked by scholars. Although what the poet wrote about his life is known, one is grateful to have his very own words. The reprinted piece appeared in N.S. 9 (1888) 59-60. The following sketch, written by Mr. Whittier with his own hand a few years ago in response to inquiries made of him, gives the main points of interest in a long and useful life. It has never been given to the world generally: 'I was born on the 17th of December, 1807, in the easterly part of Haverhill, Mass., in the house built by my first American ancestor, 200 years ago. My father was a farmer, in moderate circumstances—a man of good natural ability and sound judgment. For a great many years he was one of the selectmen of the town, and was often called upon to act as arbitrator in matters at issue between neighbors. My mother was Abigail Hussey of Rollinsford, N. H. A bachelor uncle and a maiden aunt, both of whom I remember with much affection, lived in the family. The farm was not a profitable one; it was burdened with debt, and we had no spare money; but with strict economy we lived comfortably and respectably. Both my parents were members of the Society of Friends. I had a brother and two sisters. Our home was somewhat lonely, half hidden in oak woods, with no house in sight, and we had few companions of our age and few occasions of recreation. Our school was only for 12 weeks in a year—in the depth of winter and half a mile distant. At an early age I was set at work on the farm and doing errands for my mother, who in addition to her ordinary house duties, was busy in spinning and weaving the linen and woollen cloth needed in the family. On first days father and mother, and sometimes one of the children, rode down to the Friends' meeting-house in Amesbury, eight miles distant. I think I rather enjoyed staying at home and wandering in the woods, or climbing Job's Hill, which rose abruptly from the brook which rippled down at the foot of our garden. From the top of the hill I could see the blue outline of the Deerfield mountains in New Hampshire, and the solitary peak of Agamenticus on the coast of Maine. A curving line of morning mist marked the course of the Merrimac, and Great Pond, or Kenoza, stretched away from the foot of the hill toward the village of Haverhill hidden from sight by intervening hills and woods, but which sent to us the sound of its two church bells. We had only about 20 volumes of books, most of them the journals of pioneer ministers in our society. Our only annual was an almanac. I was early fond of reading, and now and then heard of a book of biography or travel, and walked miles to borrow it. 'When I was 14 years old my first schoolmaster, Joshua Collin, the able, eccentric historian of Newbury, brought with him to our house a volume of Burns' poems, from which he read, greatly to my delight. I begged him to leave the book with me, and set myself at once to the task of mastering the glossary of the Scottish dialect at its close. This was about the first poetry I had ever read—with the exception of that of the Bible, of which I had been a close student—and it had a lasting influence upon me. I began to make rhymes myself, and to imagine stories and adventures. In fact, I lived a sort of dual life, and in a world of fancy, as well as in the world of plain matter of fact about me. My father always had a weekly newspaper, and when young Garrison started his Free Press at Newburyport, he took it in the place of the Haverhill Gazette . My sister, who was two years older than myself, sent one of my poetical attempts to the editor. Some weeks afterward the newscarrier came along on horseback, and threw the paper out from his saddle-bags. My uncle and I were mending fences. I took up the sheet, and was surprised and overjoyed to see my lines in the "Poet's Corner." I stood gazing at them in wonder, and my uncle had to call me several times to my work before I could recover myself. Soon after, Garrison came to our farmhouse, and I was called in from hoeing in the cornfield to see him. He encouraged me, and urged my father to send me to school. I longed for education, but the means to procure it were wanting. Luckily, the young man who worked for us on the farm in summer, eked out his small income by making ladies' shoes and slippers in the winter; and I learned enough of him to earn a sum sufficient to carry me through a term of six months in the Haverhill Academy. The next winter I ventured upon another expedient for raising money, and kept a district school in the adjoining town of Amesbury, thereby enabling me to have another academy term. The next winter I spent in Boston, writing for a paper. Returning in the spring, while at work on the farm, I was surprised by an invitation to take charge of the Hartford (Conn.) Review , in the place of the famous George D. Prentice, who had removed to Kentucky. I had sent him some of my school "compositions," which he had received favorably. I was unwilling to lose the chance of doing something more in accordance with my taste, and, though I felt my unfitness for the place, I accepted it, and remained nearly two years, when I was called home by the illness of my father, who died soon after. I then took charge of the farm and worked hard to "make both ends meet"; and, aided by my mother's and sister's thrift and economy, in some measure succeeded. 'As a member of the Society of Friends, I had been educated to regard slavery as a great and dangerous evil, and my sympathies were strongly enlisted for the oppressed slaves by my intimate acquaintance with William Lloyd Garrison. When the latter started his paper in Vermont in 1828, I wrote him a letter commending his views upon slavery, intemperance and war, and assuring him that he was destined to do great things. In 1833 I was a delegate to the first national anti-slavery convention at Philadelphia. I was one of the secretaries of the convention and signed its declaration. In 1835 I was in the Massachusetts Legislature. I was mobbed in Concord, N. H., in company with George Thompson, afterward member of the British Parliament, and narrowly escaped from great danger. I kept Thompson, whose life was hunted for, concealed in our lonely farm house for two weeks. I was in Boston during the great mob in Washington Street, soon after, and was threatened with personal violence. In 1837 I was in New York, in conjunction with Henry B. Stanton and Theodore D. Weld, in the office of the American Anti-Slavery Society. The next year I took charge of the Pennsylvania Freeman , an organ of the Anti-Slavery Society. My office was sacked and burned by a mob soon after, but I continued my paper until my health failed, when I returned to Massachusetts. The farm in Haverhill had, in the meantime, been sold, and my mother, aunt, and youngest sister, had moved to Amesbury, near the Friends' Meeting-house, and I took up my residence with them. All this time I had been actively engaged in writing for the anti-slavery cause. In 1833 I printed at my own expense an edition of my first pamphlet, "Justice and Expediency." With the exception of a few dollars from the Democratic Review and Buckingham's Magazine , I received nothing for my poems and literary articles. Indeed, my pronounced views on slavery made my name too unpopular for a publisher's uses. I edited in 1844 the Middlesex Standard , and afterward became associate editor of the National Era at Washington. I early saw the necessity of separate political action on the part of abolitionists, and was one of the founders of the Liberty party—the germ of the present Republican party. 'In 1857 an edition of my complete poems up to that time was published by Ticknor &amp; Fields. "In War Time" followed in 1864, and in 1865 "Snow Bound." In 1860 I was chosen a member of the Electoral College of Massachusetts, and also in 1864. I have been a member of the Board of Overseers of Harvard College and a Trustee of Brown University. But while feeling and willing to meet all the responsibilities of citizenship, and deeply interested in questions which concern the welfare and honor of the country, I have as a rule declined overtures for acceptance of public stations. I have always taken an active part in elections, but have not been willing to add my own example to the greed of office. 'I have been a member of the Society of Friends by birthright, and by a settled conviction of the truth of its principles and the importance of its testimonies, while at the same time I have a kind feeling toward all those who are seeking, in different ways from mine, to serve God and benefit their fellow-men. 'Neither of my sisters are living. My dear mother, to whom I owe much every way, died in 1858. [His brother, Matthew Franklin Whittier, died in 1883.] 'My health was never robust; I inherited from both my parents a sensitive, nervous temperament; and one of my earliest recollections is of pain in the head, from which I have suffered all my life. For many years I have not been able to read or write for more than half an hour at a time; often not so long. Of late, my hearing has been defective. But in many ways I have been blest far beyond my deserving; and, grateful to the divine providence, I tranquilly await the close of a life which has been longer, and on the whole happier, than I had reason to expect, although far different from that which I dreamed of in youth. My experience confirms the words of old time, that "it is not in man who walketh to direct his steps." Claiming no exemption from the sins and follies of our common humanity, I dare not complain of their inevitable penalties. I have had to learn renunciation and submission, and knowing That kindly Providence its care is showing In the withdrawal as in the bestowing, Scarcely I dare for more or less to pray.' Note that "Joshua Collin" is either a compositorial error or a lapse of memory on the part of JGW, for the correct name is "Coffin." JGW has himself "hoeing in the cornfield" when Garrison came unannounced; 5 the Life has him in a pursuit of a hen under the barn (p. 12). There may be other differences. One other area of interest, particularly to bibliographers, is the appearance of sixteen of JGW's poems reprinted in The Critic from the text of other periodical reprintings. Mr. Currier's bibliography of Whittier, Part II, Poems, lists among other facts, "separate printings of a poem" (p. [193)], but none of the sixteen is included. A simple listing, with a minimum of comment, of these poems reprinted in The Critic should suffice. It is worth repeating that the first three volumes each cover a full year; a new series, each volume covering six months, then begins, its first volume being marked volume one. 3 (1883) 490, Bay of Seven Islands ; N.S. 2 (1884) 178, Adjustment , 202, Birchbrook Mill , 284, The Light that is Felt ; N.S. 4 (1885) 139-140, Reunion ; N.S. 6 (1886) The Bartholdi Statue ; N.S. 8 (1887) 309-310, My Birthday ("Beneath the moonlight"), 330, A Legacy ; N.S. 10 (1888) 21, One of the Signers , with a headnote stating that the poem had been read "at the Fourth of July celebration at Mr. Henry C. Bowen's country home of Woodstock, Conn.," a fact not recorded in Currier; N.S. 11 (1889) 225, The Vow of Washington 227, To F. A. P. Barnard ; N.S. 16 (1890) 7, To E. C. S. , 53, A Day ; N.S. 17 (1892) 10, Christ in the Tempest , "published in one of the school-readers of 1850," a fact not recorded in Currier; N.S. 18 (1892) 169, To Oliver Wendell Homes , 214, seventeen lines of An Outdoor Reception . In the rest of this article I have arbitrarily included reviews of works by Whittier, biographies of him, and one work in which he may be said to have collaborated, none of which are part of the design of the Currier bibliography. There is much biographical matter in these volumes of The Critic , and I have culled what is not in the Life or not completely covered therein. And I have a final category, a catch-all miscellaneous grouping, which includes such items as the pronunciation of "Evangeline" and an entire critical article on Whittier's poetry by James Herbert Morse. None of these is in Part V, Biography and Criticism, of the Currier bibliography. There are very few reviews of Whittier's poems in the Life or in Currier. The Critic reprinted parts of reviews of Whittier's poems as well as of biographies of him. I list these in order of appearance, again with a minimum of comment or quotation. 1 (1881) 63, of The King's Missive and Other Poems : "we are neither surprised by any originality of thought or expression, nor disappointed in our expectation of a soothing mediocrity of style and sentiment," with more in the same vein. 3 (1883) 32, largely a digest of biographical facts from William Sloane Kennedy's biography. 3 (1883) 440, of Francis H. Underwood's biography: "The writer's generous admiration of his subject is tempered by an unfailing good sense; and although here and there a superlative might be spared or an epithet retrenched, yet the critical faculty displayed is of no mean order. . . . Few now living can tell us what manner of man he was at board and hearth, what things were wont to move him to smiles or sadness, what books he loved, what foibles proved him mortal." N.S. 2 (1884) 72, part quotation of the review of Underwood in The Athenaeum : "If he lacks something of Longfellow's grace, Longfellow, on the other hand, has none of his fire; and if he is less stately than Bryant he is much more spontaneous. A writer who can be pure, yet not cold, religious, yet not didactic, who is swift of thought and sure of touch, claims—what he has so largely received—respect and admiration" (July 26, 1884, p. 108). N.S. 2 (1884) 197, of Gertrude W. Cartland's Text and Verse for Every Day in the Year , the text from the Bible with the verse from JGW: "The little book is an excellent one of its kind, and certain to please." N.S. 5 (1886) 229-230, of Saint Gregory's Guest, and Recent Poems : "The author has gone from his glad spring through the 'high light' of his long and mellow summer into his lingering autumn; and now at dusk there is more than light: there is illumination, such as hangs high up on the Norwegian saeters long after the sun is down." N.S. 11 (1889) 63 and 165-166, of the Riverside edition of the Poems and Prose . N.S. 15 (1891) 7, of At Sundown : "The peculiar fire of ante-bellum and war days may be lacking, but the true poetic note rings quite as clearly now as it did in the times when the poet's Quaker garments clothed a more actively militant soul." N.S. 18 (1892) 191, of W. S. Kennedy's JGW. The Poet of Freedom , and 341, of the last volume of his poems: "The simplicity, the dignity and the beauty of the poet's personality shone out clearly in the poems which compose his last volume." I shall take the major miscellaneous pieces about JGW in order of appearance and list the others in a footnote. 6 The first piece is worth quoting as an example of undergraduate literary criticism of JGW's poetry. The Critic , N.S. 7 (1886) 217, reprints two paragraphs of a seven-page essay in the Nassau Literary Magazine of September, 1886 (pp. 123-129), by Francis Harding White, a senior at Princeton University where the Magazine was published. Wherein Whittier is Unrivalled.—As a poet of New England's woods, streams and hills, he stands almost without a rival. It is not the hoarse roar of the storm-tossed turf, the foaming cataracts, the grandeur of towering cliffs that appeal most strongly to his soul, but the little flowers that bloom 'neath his feet, a rich summer landscape, the soft ripple of the wavelets on the beach. In his declining years he seems to have turned more and more to the companionship of nature, and, as a consequence, in these later poems we have many beautiful passages descriptive of natural scenery. His love for nature is not vehement and passionate like Shelley's, but rather deep and intense like that of Wordsworth. . . . Though Whittier does not rank with the great poets, he still holds a very honorable place among those of lesser note. Much of his poetry cannot survive, as it deals with events temporary in character that have now lost their interest. Besides, most of his slavery poems were written under the influence of indignation, and not inspiration, and while the rhetoric is impassioned the sentiments are not poetical. There is no doubt that he heroically sacrificed his poetical fame on the altar of humanity. The best years of his life were spent in laboring for the freedom of the slaves, and if this time and mental energy has been used in more poetical paths, there can be no question but that his rank as a poet would be much higher. The bubble fame, however, would be but a poor exchange for the satisfaction he must feel in having done such noble service in so good a cause. White went on to a career as a teacher of history; the essay on JGW's poetry probably was his last attempt at literary criticism. Soon thereafter, and available for comparison with White's efforts, The Critic printed an essay by James Herbert Morse, minor poet and critic, who was among those who took note of JGW's eightieth birthday (Dec. 17, 1887). The essay was simply titled "John Greenleaf Whittier. 1807—December 17-1887," and was published on the very day of that birthday (pp. 307-308). The first three paragraphs are largely taken from the biography of William Lloyd Garrison written by his sons, as Garrison was the editor of The Free Press of Newburyport, Massachusetts where Whittier's first poem was published. At the end of the third paragraph Morse compares JGW to Robert Burns: "Burns, too, was a farmer, and flashed into poetical fame early, dying only too soon; but Whittier was slow in maturing, late in developing his finest fruit, which hung long on the boughs and needed long wintering in the cellar. What nature had to give him, she gave at once, and with hands full; but poetry is an art, and art is a slow-going hand-maiden of genius." I quote parts of the rest of the essay. Morse continues In 1838, when a first volume of verse appeared, the phrasing was harsh, the passion impetuous, the torrent voluminous; but in every element it was distinctly of New England. The skies are keenly blue above the fields of northern Massachusetts. Pines clothe the hillsides; hardhack, sumach and brakes border the roads. It is a land of stone walls and rocky pastures; but the grass about the bowlders is sweet, as the cattle know, and wild vines love the sunny faces of the broad ledge rock. Autumn comes early, and its winds keep the blood astir. The farmer works hard, the poet walks fast, and farmer and poet learn to do battle with the northeasters. It was a lucky day for American verse when Whittier made the study which led up to his Legendary Poems; for, although these early poems are probably less read to-day than his later work, an original bent of mind was cultivated, and the American flavor of all his later work was assured by this study. The Indian and colonial names and events entered into his stock as a poet, and enriched his verse long after he had ceased to use the material as subject-matter. There came a time, perhaps, when he grew tired of the Indian legend, grew broader in his poetical range. Leaving the land of hackmatack and pine, For Tuscan valleys glad with olive and with vine; but the best is always the native home flavor such as one perceives in 'The Maids of Attitash,' 'Rivermouth Rocks,' 'Amy Wentworth,' 'Maud Müller,' 'Telling the Bees,' 'The Witch's Daughter,' and 'My Playmate.' The graces of his verse appeared more and more persuasively when the War was coming to an end, and the young soldiers were dragging their battered cannon home. There were many young Quakers among the soldiers, who had forgotten the drab and donned the blue. Whittier could not handle the guns; but he sounded the bugle, and none louder than he sang the jubilate of victory. Much of his broader verse has appeared since the War, and it is as grave, tender, and melodious as art, in long wedlock with genius, can make. There is a rich home quality that will endear verse and man to our American youth and manhood,—and there exists no man for whom we may more justly twine the garland which his brother poet Lowell bespoke for him nearly fifty years ago:— A wreath, twine a wreath for the loyal and true Who, for the sake of the many, dared stand with the few. Morse, it may be recalled, was one of the regular reviewers for The Critic . The moralizing tendency of the following piece of criticism might be expected from its appearance in the London Literary World , a monthly supplement of the Christian World . An English Tribute to Mr. Whittier.—America has no need to be ashamed of the productions of her Muse during the last half-century. She has not produced a great artist-poet like Tennyson, nor a profound poet-thinker like Browning; but she has given us a goodly number of poets whose words the world will not willingly let die—such as William Cullen Bryant and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, among the departed, and James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and John Greenleaf Whittier, still happily spared to us. Amongst these Whittier holds a very high and distinctive place. His poems have not the artistic finish of Mr. Lowell's, nor the popular elements to be found in Longfellow's; but in some senses they are superior to both. For a peculiar and beautiful power of pathetic expression they are unrivalled, whilst on subjects which move him deeply, such as oppression or slavery, there is a prophet-like strength of conviction and utterance which stirs the soul to its depths. Indeed, his poems are not, like so many of our age, the result of mere culture and acquaintance with poetic forms; he owes little, if anything, to these; they are the outcome of a tender, passionate, poetic heart. The man is the poet. Of him the oft-quoted dictum is true to the uttermost: 'The poet is born, not made. There is no writer of recent times with whom we are acquainted who, without moralizing, does so much to waken a really religious and Christ-like feeling as Mr. Whittier. We are convinced that a wide circulation of his works in England will do much to elevate religious feeling, to overthrow unworthy conceptions of God, and to promote that true sense of brotherhood among men and nations which more than legal enactments or the schemes of Socialists will tend to hasten on earth the coming of the kingdom of heaven. We trust, therefore, that this complete and worthy issue will lead to as wide an acceptance of his works in our country as they have already received in the United States. (N.S. 11 [1889] 201) The comparison of American poets to Tennyson and Browning smacks somewhat of literary chauvinism. The Boston Journal requested that some of JGW's friends write a few words on the occasion of his eighty-fourth birthday in 1892. The event is recorded briefly in the Life (p. 520); none of the congratulatory messages is quoted; hence, without access to the Journal one would not know what various friends wrote. But The Critic quotes from Julia Ward Howe, Celia Thaxter, Harriet Prescott Spofford, Rose Terry Cooke, Edna Dean Proctor, the Reverend A. P. Peabody, Francis M. Stanwood, Sarah Orne Jewett, Lucy Larcom, the Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, and cites Donald G. Mitchell (N.S. 16, pp. 335-336). And (pp. 371-372) there is a much more detailed account of JGW's eighty-fourth birthday than in the Life (pp. 520-521). Quotation from tributes by George W. Cable, Col. T. W. Higginson (actually he repeated a sonnet he had written to JGW), Professor Charles Eliot Norton, Mr. Curtis Guild, Bishop Phillips Brooks, a poem by Edna Dean Proctor ("Whittier in New Hampshire—Dec. 17, 1891"), a poem by "Mrs. Lothrop ('Margaret Sidney')", and "From a little Indian girl in Brantford, Ont. there came this message to the poet—'Your young Mohawk friend asks for you to-day the Great Spirit's blessing'. E. Pauline Johnson." Finally, in this miscellaneous category, an anecdote and another piece of laudatory criticism of JGW's poetry, both in 1892. Mrs. Mary A. Livermore has just celebrated her seventieth birthday, and in speaking of the event narrated in a humorous strain this anecdote:—'I was at a little gathering some few years ago,' she said, 'in which were Dr. Holmes and Mr. Whittier. The talk turned on ages. Mr. Whittier and Mr. Holmes were then about eighty, to which they confessed. "By the way," said Mr. Whittier to me, "thou hast not said how old thou art." I was then approaching sixty-seven, and when I told them, in a sad tone, Mr. Whittier quickly replied, "Get thee along, get thee along,—thou art but a giddy girl!"' (N.S. 17, p. 10) A long biographical account of JGW was printed in the September 17, 1892, number (N.S. 18, pp. 152-155), simply titled "His Life and Work" and with the explanation that "The following story of Mr. Whittier's life is condensed from a long and interesting sketch in The Evening Post ." The writer invokes Kennedy's biography of JGW for the biographical details and follows with a section labelled "Personalia," in which there is a description of JGW by a recent visitor, quotation of four sentences from the autobiographical sketch quoted above (beginning "In 1860 I was chosen a member . . ."), and a number of other bits and pieces. JGW's letter to Oliver Wendell Holmes ( Letters , III. 489) is quoted in full. The writer of the account is identified as Colonel Higginson on page 168 of The Critic . There JGW's will is reprinted in full. Of no little interest is JGW's response recorded in an account of his seventy-fifth birthday on December 18, 1882, by a reporter of the New York Herald (p. 10) who asked what work he was doing that winter. He replied: "Not much; nothing to speak of. I have done too much already, such as it is. Then I have so many letters to write that I scarcely find time to do much literary work worth the name. There is no man who ought to write much after he is seventy, unless, perhaps, it may be Dr. Holmes. He ought to write from now on until he is 100. There is such wonderful variety in his work that it seems a pity he should ever stop" (2.356). Eight years later, in 1890, The Critic printed the following short note: "Mr. Whittier writes to a correspondent:—'I have reached a time of life when literary notoriety is of little consequence, but I shall be glad to feel that I have not altogether written in vain; that my words for freedom, temperance, charity, faith in divine goodness, love of nature and home and country are welcomed and approved'" (N.S. 13, p. 111). A few more items of somewhat more than peripheral interest should be quoted or cited. In 1892 the following notice appeared: It has been recently published that Mr. Whittier would write the opening ode for the World's Fair at Chicago, the item stating that the poet, although unable to give a definite answer when the matter was first broached, was now, on account of improved health, ready to undertake the task. I find that the story originated at Newburyport, where Mr. Whittier is still staying, but unfortunately it is not true. I inquired of Mr. Whittier and he writes me [W.S. Kennedy, his biographer] as follows:—"The statement in the newspaper is entirely untrue. My state of health does not admit of any engagement of a literary kind." [The writing of the Ode was long ago entrusted to Miss Harriet Monroe of Chicago.—EDS. CRITIC] (N.S. 18, p. 19) Neither this nor the following is mentioned in the three works under discussion. In the same year, 1892, The Critic , in a fine display of editorial judgement, partially quoted and briefly commented upon a violent attack on JGW's anti-slavery poems. The short notice reads: "A writer in Fetter's Southern Magazine [published in Louisville, Kentucky] says that Whittier's anti-slavery poems were 'written with a pen dipped in the heart's blood of the South and tipped in the fire of its burning homes'; that 'the ambition of Alexander and the craftiness of Caesar combined never caused so much bloodshed as the poems of Whittier' that he wrote lines in which 'every letter meant a grave and every syllable a family bereaved.' Fetter is not a bad name for a man who believes in slaves and shackles" (N.S. 18, p. 223). This was the one discordant note in the notices of JGW's death. 7 Although the information about JGW and his works gleaned from The Critic in the years from 1881 through 1892 does not radically change what is known about him, it reinforces that knowledge and adds to it. One has his further views on aspects of his own poetry ( Barbara Frietchie and Christ in the Tempest ), of that of his contemporaries (Holmes, Lowell, Mrs. Gustafson), and of Robert Burns. There are his remarks on Methodism, and the amusing accompanying remark that "Quaker singing is dolefully bad." One has further evidence about the reception and popularity of his poetry in the reviews reprinted in The Critic . And there is the occasional longer piece, notably that by James Herbert Morse. The names of Mrs. Boyce and of Thomas Snape may now be added to the list of JGW's friends. So, too, the name of E. Pauline Johnson, the little Indian girl in Brantford, Ontario, who sent this message to the poet on his eighty-fourth birthday: "Your young Mohawk friend asks for you to-day the Great Spirit's blessing" (N.S. 16, p. 336). Finally, and most obviously, The Critic deserves, and will repay, further study.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Gilbert Sorrentino's Revisions of The Sky Changes by David Leon Higdon and Robert F. Sheard</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gilbert Sorrentino is now firmly established among those authors one invokes when discussing post-modernist American fiction. Although he may not yet enjoy the stature of Donald Barthelme, Robert Coover, or Ronald Sukenick, his metafictions, Imaginative Qualities of Actual Things (1971) and especially Mulligan Stew (1979), have created a solid reputation and drawn a wide circle of admirers. Such, though, was not always the case. When his first novel, The Sky Changes , was published by Hill and Wang in 1966, he was known as the editor of Neon and as a promising poet, author of The Darkness Surrounds Us (1960) and Black and White (1964). What attention his novel received was largely negative. John M. Carroll, reviewing it for Library Journal , concluded that "as a whole, the literary devices of no names, no inhibitions, and no continuity only result in a repetitive, tiresome, clinical prolongation of a hypothetical psychological case study," and Choice 's anonymous reviewer decided that although "a distinctive voice . . . has shaped a taut novel," Sorrentino at present only "bears watching." 1 Critical reactions addressed to Sorrentino himself were often even more pointed. He recalled that "some guy wrote me after reading The Sky Changes and said that after he had finished it he went and threw up." 2 Such negative responses did not then motivate Sorrentino to revise his novel, as he would later do in 1986. In a brief, rather disingenuous "Author's Note" to the 1986 text, Sorrentino explained that creating "a more harmonious whole" which, as a result of revision, "is now . . . as sound as I can make it" carried him towards his larger goal of "strengthen[ing] and purify[ing] the narrative strategies of the text." 3 The revisions, he adds, "are not, as they say, substantive." In actuality, they are. In addition to adding two sections to his novel, Sorrentino also made 149 other revisions, including 62 deletions, 58 revisions, 25 additions, and 4 paragraphing and break changes, which significantly reshape motivations, themes, and the larger sense of design in the novel. As early as 1974, Sorrentino had planned revisions, should the opportunity afforded by a second edition of The Sky Changes ever arise. In an interview, conducted by Barry Alpert, Sorrentino said he could not reread The Sky Changes , or any of his other published works, because rereading "recalls the weariness of composition." 4 He had, however, given considerable thought to his text. He said he saw "a lot of flaws" and knew "right off the top of [his] head. . . . There are 2 sections that are missing from The Sky Changes . . . . that should be there and are not" (Alpert, 12). He also sensed "lapses in tone . . . sentences that drag and limp—that shuffle along. . . . sentences that don't do anything except tell you things" (Alpert, 11). Clearly this novel on which he began writing in 1961 and completed sometime in 1964 still claimed his attention, especially so, it seems, now that he was in the midst of a new project, Mulligan Stew . The Sky Changes is a short novel made up of seventy-three sections (seventy-five in the 1986 edition), each but the first, "A Start," carrying a geographical place name for a heading. These identify the points through which the characters pass on their way from Brooklyn to San Francisco, during a leisurely journey which takes them south to Maryland, west through Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, south into Missouri, Tennessee, and Mississippi, before the trek west through Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. In his desire to achieve pure spatiality in form and theme, Sorrentino "splintered" the chronology so that "the past, the present, the future are mixed together in order to show very clearly that there is no past that is worse than the present and there is no future that will be better than the present" (O'Brien, 8). Even the novel's title reinforces the desire for spatial form with its muted insistence that only the sky changes. The title, taken from Horace's "Quid tibi visa Chios, Bullati, notaque Lesbos" or "To Bullatius, on There Being No Place like Home," is, in context, even more pointed: Nam si ratio et prudentia curas, non locus effusi late mares arbiter aufert, caelum, non animum, mutant qui trans mare currant; strenua nos exercet inertia. (Book I, Epistle xi, 25-28) Reason and sense dispel cares, not a lonely view of the sea; so by flying across the sea you change only your sky , Not your heart. 5 " But the climate change " is the more usual translation; however, Sorrentino, who has himself translated the Elegaics of Sulpicia, undoubtedly supplied his own translation of the line. Forty-nine of the sections (fifty-one in the revised version) treat the present journey; nineteen chronicle the couple's courtship and early marriage; five are devoted to future events which trace, in reverse order, the husband's return alone to New York. Sorrentino found both "an enormous sterility" and a "lack of hope" in America in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and his novel records both in detail (O'Brien, 10). It is a keenly pessimistic work in its topography, its marriages, and its culture. America resonates as a wasteland, changing only in the nature of its threats. A "grey sky, grey rain" (6) and "malignant clouds" (12) accompany them through the "shabby, eternally grey" (8), "inhospitable" (11), "incredible darkness" (17) of Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. The protagonist feels "as if he is moving through hell" (16) at times, in "all this dead land, this wasted heartland" (24) of the Midwest with its "bent, cruelly dwarfed" (8), "withered and sunbaked" (11) people and "barred store fronts, an anonymity of evil . . . no life behind them" (17). Memphis, New Orleans, Houston, and San Antonio offer no respite. Memphis brings "a heavy despair in the very rays of the November sunshine" (28-29); New Orleans is no more than "a lousy fucking town, a rotten, stinking town" (60), and San Antonio stands "stale, used, so dreary and grey in the rain" (64). The sparsely inhabited spaces of the West bring another kind of threat, an almost Pascalian terror of the openness, barrenness, and coldness. "His heart shriveled at the beauty, the utter barrenness of the country," (75) the narrator tells us of the protagonist's reaction to New Mexico, while Arizona looks like "a landscape of some foreign planet" (98). Only in California do the land and sky join in fertility. As they cross into the central valley, the protagonist perceives that it is "unbelievably beautiful" (122); "Biblical remembrances of a land of milk and honey seemed to find reality in the countryside" (126). The emotional landscapes visited by the travelers are equally bleak and barren. They visit several old college friends and other acquaintances who have fled New York, seeking happiness in rural America. In Urbana, Illinois, they visit S and B (no character in the novel has a name). B is now an instructor in humanities at the University of Illinois, but while in the town park he is still quite willing to spear an annoying goose in front of his small children. S and B, we are told, "slash at each other constantly" (21), as indeed do all these couples who are in flight from New York and themselves. S remains "as nervous, as strident as ever," while B remains "honed to a razor edge of frustration" (21). They have found only disappointment in the Midwest. In Santa Fe and Taos, R and M repeat the pattern. Both are jobless, depending on R's ex-husband for "gratuitous and sporadic financial assistance" (78). Their life together resembles "guerrilla warfare" (79), escaped only through drunkenness. San Francisco brings stopovers with both W and Q, whose wives never even receive initials. W's wife seems "simply grasping" (129) and greedy; her husband is resentful of having to work at a steady job, of knowing he and his wife can have no children, and of the bullying sadism of his wife's illegitimate son. The novel closes with a sombre scene of an ultimately estranged couple met in transit through Albuquerque. The husband is on heroin; the wife is an alcoholic. Together, they are sitting "decorous and serene, staring into the gentle sunlight, blunted, secure from each other, and from everything else" (139). Sorrentino said during a 1981 interview that "there's nobody in the novel who's worth a damn, nobody at all" (O'Brien, 11), not even the "whining voice" of the narrator; the characters are "zombies," he concluded (O'Brien, 11). The primary characters number six: the paranoid, sexually insecure husband, the estranged wife, their two silent children who seem to exist in the novel only to be bathed and put to bed, the mysterious, unnamed driver who eventually elopes with the wife, and a cantankerous green Ford station wagon of questionable roadworthiness. The husband and wife, both largely convinced that their marriage is a failure, are travelling to the West coast of Mexico in hopes that its isolation and romance will somehow revitalize their relationship. The trip has been made possible by the husband's inheritance of his mother's estate, a point which comes back to haunt him numerous times. As noted, the major characters are tightly clustered around one disintegrating family unit. The children remain ciphers, rarely affecting the story except as reminders of their father's essentially ambivalent feelings towards them now that he wonders if they are actually his. The parents have been married for seven years, and the husband's apparently devout Catholic mother has been dead for four months or so when the trip to Mexico begins. The husband is estranged by doubts from his children, and he feels "he can't get through to them, anything, any more" (7). Sexual uncertainties devour him almost hourly, because, as the 1966 text emphasizes, he knows of his wife's infidelities (as well as his own). His identities as father, husband, and lover have been shaken. He no longer knows if he recognizes his wife, his doubts having been awakened when she called him by another man's name during lovemaking (18). On one hand, he assures himself, "whatever else she was she was faithful. She had to be faithful" (39); on the other hand, he goads himself on through "self-imposed blindness to what he now allowed himself to consider were her probable acts of infidelity" (92). He scripts an affair between his wife and the shadowy driver, not knowing the accuracy of his imaginings. By the time the party reaches Nevada, the wife has become "so remote, she moved in a box, transparent, but sealed" (110). The trip becomes the protagonist's futile attempt to escape the realities of his existence. The escape from friends, dead love, and the inadequacies of self he confronted on the opening page of the novel have haunted him all the way to San Francisco. These four paragraphs of interpretative summary could stand fairly adequately for either the 1966 or the 1986 editions, so far as the larger structural units are concerned. The basic facts of the story remain largely identical in both editions; however, the role of the wife and especially the role of the narrating voice change considerably. Contrary to Sorrentino's assertion in the "Author's Note," the changes are substantive. In fact, they alter dramatically the way the reader perceives the characters and their relationships. Sorrentino established a greater sense of distance and objectivity between his narrating voice and his protagonist, especially as these narrative strategies affect the presentation of the husband/sometimes narrator. The role of the wife also underwent considerable alteration, probably the most crucial cluster of revisions for the 1986 edition. In the 1966 edition, the tone of the husband/sometimes narrator is much more bitter and vindictive than in the 1986 edition. Time and aesthetic distance may have softened the autobiographical ties Sorrentino had with the material. Nonetheless, in the later edition, we see the narrator displaying a less pessimistic attitude about his wife and their relationship. For example, early in the 1966 edition, the husband and wife are making love and "He feels himself coming, blinded with fury, impotent, where are his balls? What happens to them that he comes and it is vinegar?" (14). The 1986 edition deletes "impotent, where are his balls?" (5), thereby painting the wife as less of an emasculating force. The revision still shows the husband's anger but it removes some of the blame from his wife for their incompatibility. A similar change in the husband's attitude is evident in "Jackson, Mississippi" (Section 34) and the flashback, "Brooklyn, New York" (Section 35) which immediately follows it. In Jackson, the husband and wife are staying with a couple—one of their many nameless friends: "So, they talked that night in bed (in lieu of fucking, which was more trouble than it was finally worth) . . ." (64). In the later edition, the parenthetical aside is deleted. And in the next section, pondering C's troubled relationship, the narrator thinks, "Ha . . . what she and I do all the time. Put up with anything so as not to disturb the comfortable status quo " (69). Again, in the 1986 edition, the accusatory remark about the status quo is deleted (49). In both passages, then, we see a change from the accusatory, bitter husband of the 1966 edition to a more resigned, more conciliatory narrator, one who realizes that part of the blame is his. In fact, as we see from his continual attempts to have sex with his wife, it is not more trouble than it is worth. At the same time, however, we also get a narrator in the second edition who is more self-deluded. When the family arrives in New Orleans, the husband senses that a positive change in his fortunes is inevitable. Describing the hotel room in the French Quarter, he thinks: "It was a fine room, and he was delighted. The hint of better things to come in this state seemed to be flowering fully. He looked at his wife with a love he had not felt for her in years—a love and a hope for the both of them" (74). In the second edition (53), the first two sentences of the quoted passage are deleted, leaving out the external presence that provides the husband with the sense of optimism and hope. In the later version, we see the husband wanting to feel optimism, but it is an optimism based on nothing tangible—a delusion. The husband's attitude and stance are not the only ones to undergo revision though. After the husband and wife separate, the husband calls his friend, J, for advice. The 1966 edition closes the section with J's thoughts after his conversation with the husband: They spoke for another five minutes or so, then hung up. J thought, maybe he will [shoot his wife and the driver]. Maybe I can get him to come here, I mean, then talk him out of it, he'll stay on and I can con him out of a few grand and see if I can open up that little bar near Sill. We could be partners. Shit, he'd let me have a few grand with all that bread he's got. Or maybe we could go on to New York together. I could help him blow that loot. So they left together. He thought, goddamn whore, she's gotta have it. What is it, darling? his girl asked. Oh, the sap's old lady and my dear old college chum took off together on him. They might stop by here on their way to San Antone. You be nice to them. I don't like her, she said. You be nice to them, he said. Don't you be too nice to her , she said. (103) The 1986 edition, however, entirely deletes J's thoughts. The focus now remains on the husband. After he and J hang up, we get only a short paragraph: "The husband stood for a moment, his hand still on the phone, controlling the nausea that was threading through him. J's voice had filled him with loathing and horror" (77). This major revision accomplishes two purposes. First, and most obviously, it removes the terrible account of J's hypocrisy so evident in the earlier version. The second edition shows J to be concerned for the husband, not his money. The revision also provides another instance of Sorrentino's change in attitude toward the wife. The reference to her outright greed and manipulation has been deleted completely. In fact, logically, greed cannot be a motive for her to leave the newly affluent husband for the perennially destitute driver. A second instance of this type of revision occurs with yet another set of friends, M and R, during Thanksgiving in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The 1966 version gives us the thoughts of M and R as the husband and wife arrive: In two days it would be Thanksgiving and they waited for their visitors, delighted to be seeing someone from New York, although they officially hated the town, delighted too that the visitors' means would enable them to buy a turkey and its concomitants for dinner. On the whole, things had an optimistic cast and they jumped from their after-supper coffee as they heard a car in the driveway and the familiar voices of their old friends, calling and laughing above the barking of the neighbor's dog. (105) This insight into M and R's questionable enthusiasm over the visitors' arrival is eliminated in the second edition, and the centers of focus become the husband and wife: All this information and complaint flooded the visitors within hours of their arrival. But things seemed better now as they laughed in the blue dark and dust, shaking hands, kissing. The driver unloaded the car in silence. In two days it would be Thanksgiving. (78) As with the passage about J, this demonstration of M and R's greed is eliminated in the second edition, leaving us with a more comfortable and typical reunion of friends—less bitter and less vitriolic than the tone of the 1966 edition. In addition to softening the bitter tone of the first edition, Sorrentino also made several narrative changes designed to focus more tightly on the husband as the center of consciousness. The narrative employs both third person omniscient and first person point of view variously throughout the text. At times, though, third person viewpoint alters the way the reader perceives the actions of the characters, and the author has revised several of these passages to bring the husband's perception of the events into the foreground. This emphasis on the husband's observations brings up all the questions in the reader's mind associated with a first person narrator. What is real? What observations are biased? What can we believe and what must we question? On several occasions, what was an objective external observation in the 1966 edition becomes the husband's internal observation of an event. For example, during an argument between husband and wife, we are told "The driver sits, silently, a tenuous smile on his lips. He finds it all slightly amusing" (83). The second edition removes the editorial comment about the driver's amusement: "The driver sits, silently, a tenuous smile on his lips. The husband glances at him" (61). In the later version, we have no indication of the driver's real state of mind; all we see is what the husband sees and speculates upon. Another passage which changes from an actual observation to an indication of the husband's perception occurs when the husband feels a sense of the driver's growing resentment. The husband cannot substantiate his feeling, though, and decides to ignore it. The objective narrator tells us, however, "He was right in his feeling, the driver was resentful . . ." (109). The second version leaves the passage strictly in the mind of the husband: "Yet he could not help but feel that the driver was resentful . . ." (81). Again, the revision eliminates any objective indication of the driver's attitude, leaving the reader with increased doubts about the credibility of the narrator/husband. In the revised edition, the reader's view of both wife and driver is filtered through a perceptual focus of the husband. At no time in the second edition do we get any indication that the conspiracy the husband suspects is genuine; it remains only suspicion until the very end of the narrative. For instance, when the husband is contemplating his options concerning his wife's suspected affair with the driver: He had not yet formulated what he would do, but he would certainly show them that when he made his move, it would be an independent one, not one based upon their needs or desires. Or so he thought. He had not reckoned with a man and woman whose needs and desires were so submerged, so camouflaged, that their emergence sometimes took the form of altruism. (109-10) The revised version of this passage lessens the level of authorial presence. We do not see a narrator so obviously corroborating the husband's suspicions, but rather one exposing the husband's perception, again calling into question the differences between appearance and reality: What would he do? The husband, inarticulately, knew that he would think, this traveler, that his action, whatever it might finally be, would be thought by him to be an independent one, but he would be wrong, since he had not reckoned with a man and woman whose needs and desires were so submerged, so camouflaged, that their emergence sometimes appeared to be at others' bidding, but were not. (81-82, author's italics) This second group of revisions alters the reader's conviction that the husband's suspicions are valid. By removing the objective intrusions and placing the events in the eyes of the husband only, Sorrentino has allowed the reader a reasonable and necessary doubt as to the reliability of the husband as an objective observer. Nowhere is this more clear, however, than in the third set of revisions where Sorrentino eliminates every reference to the wife's actual infidelities, both in the past and currently with the driver. The first of these occurs in an early flashback scene, recalling the time in Brooklyn, New York. The 1966 edition contains a scene between the wife and the husband's friend F which confirms her early infidelities of which the husband knows nothing. Sorrentino deleted the following lines in his 1986 edition: F looks at the wife across the kitchen table; the husband has gone to work and F is staying with them for three or four days, a usual monthly occurrence, since he has no job and no place to live. I know how you feel, baby, he says, I know how great the strain must be, you feel as if nothing has ever happened to you. The children are playing in the lot next to the garden, beneath the peach trees. The wife pulls the curtains and locks the door. Oh, F, she says, I don't want to, I don't want to. He is unbuttoning her shorts, and she kneads his thighs. They both believe they feel sorry for each other. (43) The passage continues with the husband's thoughts while he is at work—a passage present in both editions—and then the 1966 edition closes the scene thus: His son digs with a trowel while his daughter pounds on the door, mommy! mommy! I have to do pee-pee! F pulls on his levis and goes to open the door for his friend's daughter. He feels depressed, thinking that it is because he has cuckolded his friend: actually it is because his orgasm was mechanical and without feeling, and she had none at all. (44) Both of the passages demonstrating the wife's infidelity are omitted in the 1986 edition (30). Although the husband suspects she has been unfaithful, the reader only sees the husband's suspicion, not any evidence of her affairs. In another recollection from their time in Brooklyn, a similar reference to actual infidelity on the part of his wife is deleted in the second edition—this time an affair with J. Staying with them for four months, J "laid his wife each weekday when the husband went off to work. The husband knew only that he was sponging off them, nothing else" (100). This becomes simply "The husband went faithfully to work each morning" (74) in the later edition. Continuing with the same incident, the 1966 edition states: "For his wife, it was a simple step from the first indiscretion to greater ones, and the step came almost naturally." And we are told a few sentences later that "The driver knew about J and his wife, J had told him" (100). Again, none of this remains in the second edition. The references to her "indiscretions" are erased, and we are left with: "His wife told him how relieved she was that J was finally gone. Getting in my way all day long, is what she said" (74-75). Yet another indictment of the wife's unfaithfulness is deleted from the second edition on the occasion of the stay with M and R in Santa Fe. The first edition recalls the wife's former close relationship with R: "His wife had in R a former confidante, someone whose advice she had sought many times on the telephone concerning her infidelities, both real and desired" (108). The 1986 edition reads: "someone whose advice she had sought many times on the telephone" (80). The scene continues with M and R looking upon the husband with pity: And, too, their pity was mixed with contempt, since they thought that the driver was acting, on this trip, as the wife's acknowledged (by them all) lover, that some madness, some perversity had seized the husband so that he would rather have his wife with him, under any conditions, than not have her at all. Although their interpretation of the situation was pragmatically wrong, it was, in spirit, most decidedly correct. But the husband, and his wife, joked along with them, lying as they had always lied. (108) Compare this with the 1986 version: And, too, their pity was mixed with contempt. But the husband, and his wife, joked along with them, lying as they had always lied. (80) While we still have a portrait of a failing marriage in the second edition, we do not get any specific indication of an attributable cause. In short, every reference to an actual infidelity on the part of the wife has been eliminated from the second edition, leaving the reader with only the paranoid suspicions of a sexually insecure husband. Not only has Sorrentino removed the references to the wife's guilt in the 1986 edition, but he has erased any evidence of the driver's guilt as well. On two occasions in the 1966 edition, the omniscient narrator tells us what the driver is thinking while in his room. In Memphis, Tennessee, the narrator tells us: The driver is thinking of the husband and the wife in the act of fornication, sodomy, all variants that he can imagine, and he masturbates, his eyes shut tight, a slight smile on his lips, the orgasm lurking at the base of his testes for the final peremptory motion of his hand. (51) This passage is omitted in the 1986 version, leaving only the husband's speculations (35). Again in the New Orleans episode, the narrator tells us the driver's thoughts. In the first edition, we read: "In his black room across the inner patio of the house the driver thinks, any time I want it, any goddamned time I want it" (79). With this deleted, we are again faced with a reinforcement of the husband's paranoia and suspicions. In the second edition, by the time the wife actually "admits" her infidelities, the reader has seen so much evidence of an overly insecure and entirely deluded male ego, that one actually begins to question the veracity of her "confession." Is she confessing because she is indeed guilty as we see in the first edition, or is she "confessing" because she has been accused and suspected for so long now that she will admit to anything to satisfy her husband and be done with the situation? Despite Sorrentino's claims, therefore, that his revisions "are not, as they say, substantive, but are for the most part intended to strengthen and purify the narrative strategies of the text" (iii), we have changes which potentially undermine the entire interpretation of the novel. In fact, we have two very different versions, each capable of being perceived differently in terms of characterization and thematic values. It is a mistake, therefore, to look at either and claim it to be the "definitive" edition. With twenty years separating the publication of the two editions, it is not going too far to suggest that the two narratives were written by essentially two different authors—one at the beginning of his career, the other writing with the benefit of several successful works behind him and the altered perception that comes with two decades' additional experience. Sorrentino told one interviewer that he cut twelve to fifteen sections from Steelwork , his second novel, an indication that deletion is one of his major tools in revision; the interviewer recalled for him, "You mentioned to me some time ago that you had to rewrite and even omit several sections from that novel [ The Sky Changes ] because they tend to arouse emotions on the reader's part which conflicted with the emotionless and sterile quality of the characters' lives" (O'Brien, 9). Rather than deleting further scenes, though, Sorrentino added two new sections to The Sky Changes , "written especially for this [the 1986] edition which serve the purpose, one hopes, of giving the geography of the journey a greater coherence" (iii). In his 1974 interview with Alpert, Sorrentino said these sections were absent in the first edition because "it's just that I didn't put them in because I didn't know enough to put them in. I was rushed and anxious. And now I know that they should be there" (Alpert, 13). This coherence is needed, particularly for the reader who wonders why the travellers go from Washington, D. C. (Section 4) to Jacksontown, Ohio (Section 5). To explain this, Sorrentino added the Hagerstown, Maryland (4A) and the Wheeling, West Virginia (4B) episodes. Hagerstown enabled Sorrentino to emphasize the shabby greyness and the malformed people a bit earlier and more emphatically; Wheeling gave him the chance to show the husband so estranged from reality that he wonders if the actors on television in the Lee Marvin movie ( Shackout on 101 ) are not more real than he is. We also glimpse the drunken sentimentality and self-pity of the husband who feels sad that he does not know anyone in either Maryland or West Virginia—one of the most deft additions to the text. The individual word bears the responsibility of conveying a sense of the artist in Sorrentino's novels. In addition, he said, "the words must also have, in their composition, a texture and design we call style. . . . The flash, the instant or cluster of meaning must be extrapolated from 'the pageless actual' and presented in its imaginative qualities." 6 In approaching his revisions of isolated words and phrases, concern for "texture and design" is immediately recognizable in Sorrentino's revisions, deletions, and additions, apart from those revisions affecting character portrayal. For example, he obviously wished to sexualize the protagonist's perception of his wife's body at various stages in the journey, because her "pants" (28), "dress" (78), and "legs" (157) became her "panties" (18), "slip" (57), and "thighs" (119), although by the end of the novel she has become "The woman" (138) rather than "His wife" (181). Sorrentino's dexterity and success in adjusting images is particularly evident if one considers his ability to refocus the image entirely by substituting a different word. For example, he changed "signs" (41) to "banners" (28), thus capturing more vividly and more accurately the "FOR SALE banners cracking in a yellow breeze" (italics added); he revised the description of the husband literally kicking his wife out of bed from "an absurd act" (85) to "a mean act" (62), thus making it less a philosophical gesture and more a consciously literal spiteful act which diminishes our sympathy for the husband, just as revision of "a riot of ideas" (97) to "a storm of plans and schemes" (72) creates a sense of a more desperate and deluded man capable of scarcely formed "plans and schemes" rather than the more in tellectual "ideas"; and in similar fashion, the substitution of "mute recriminations" (92) for "silent recriminations" (122) to describe the "torture" of the husband and wife lying together in the same bed shifts the image from one of choice, the choice of remaining silent, to a true inability to speak in the first place. Finally, replacing "blast" (158) with "shock" (120) in describing the wife's reaction to her husband's near seduction of a sixteen-year-old at a party both changes the reaction and deletes the positive connotations of "blast." These and other revisions keenly hone the presentation of the marital relationship which is at the heart of the novel. Elsewhere, Sorrentino changed W's stepson from a "drooling bastard" (75) to a "drooling brat" (55), making the perception less vindictive, though accurate, on the protagonist's part. Sometimes the revisions are as minor as changing "the husband and wife" (109) to "they" (81) or "Assuming himself" (128) to "Putting himself" (97); at others, as complex as rewording "speaking now of their daily hatred of Santa Fe" (104) to "They would soon speak to their guests of their hatred of Santa Fe" (77), or making the figurative "so loudly that it was like being in a box of noise" (113) the literal "so loudly that the car was a box of noise" (84). Not surprisingly, Sorrentino made very few additions to his text—only twelve in all. As the travelers pass through the Mojave Desert, they now see "half-finished and abandoned housing" (121), rather than just "housing" (159), a revision totally in keeping with his image of the decaying America. The husband's "desperation" (24) becomes his "absolute desperation" (15); his wife's allure intensifies as he now glimpses "Stockings, a misty flesh" (18); and the husband now silently calls the driver "the bastard!" (61). Even the mariachis (92) in San Antonio become "some shabby mariachis " (68). Only one addition is lengthy. Originally, the protagonist and his wife discussed the sponging J and decide that "You just had to forgive a guy like that" (100). To the next sentence, Sorrentino appended the ironic comment: "the husband offered, and they both laughed indulgently and with sublime generosity" (75), a generosity they cannot feel for one another. The closing phrase is particularly ironic to the reader considering what he or she knows of their relationship. As noted above, Sorrentino's favorite mode of revision is the deletion, and just as he reshaped the reader's experience of the protagonist by slashing key passages, so, too, does he attack the problem of certain sentences and phrases. Sometimes, the deletion almost involves the laughable, as in his change of "a damp worm" (153) to merely "a worm" (116); the redundant, as when "ate their food" (92) became "ate" (68); or the inappropriate, as when "It was a rather festive occasion" (107/80) disappears from the description of the first evening with M and R in Santa Fe. Occasionally, a stylistically unusual word gets cut: "motility" (119/89) and "detritus" (29/19), for example. Most of the deletions, though, simply tighten syntax, sharpen idiomatic phrasing, tame minor redundancies, though the Hopi Indian who in the 1966 edition was both "handsome and inscrutable" (141) is only "handsome" (107) in the 1986 text. While reshaping numerous passages, Sorrentino also made eleven necessary corrections. The 1966 text prints "Sante Fe" (106, 107, 107, 110) which the 1986 text corrects to "Santa Fe" (79, 80, 80, 82), while also changing "the rub" (173), an obvious misprint, to "the tub" (132). "Oakland Bridge" (167) becomes "Bay Bridge" (127), reflecting current geographical idiom, and the distance from which New Orleans becomes visible on the Ponchartrain Bridge changed from "ten miles" (71) to "five miles" (52). The phrase "arching poverty" (56), describing the workers in the Mississippi cottonfields, becomes "aching poverty" (39), either a correction or a suppression of the metaphor of the arch their bodies trace against the sky, reasoning which would be congruent with Sorrentino's desire to avoid the figurative statement. One correction seems to stem from a major misprint or the failure of a joke. As the travelers enter Columbus, Ohio, the husband thinks "This fucking town, what a perfect name. Columbus. After that businessman. The usual car lots" (25), but in the 1986 text, "businessman" becomes "failure" (15). Sorrentino may have regarded the image of Columbus as a "businessman" too strained, though he indeed was, and thus substituted "failure" since Columbus was a failure on several levels. 7 The jacket blurbs of the first edition had high praise for Sorrentino's novel. Robert Creeley, for example, hailed it as "unique, brilliantly and sparely written, absolutely without self-indulgence or embarrassment," and Robert Gover called it "a spellbinding tale that is compact, poetic and tragic. For the reader who is not afraid to be shown the tortured side of our modern style of quick dissolve, five-and-ten-cent-love." Donald Phelps' note perhaps came nearer the bone when he labelled the novel "an odyssey of spiritual onanism, movingly and brilliantly executed," because he captures the essence of the two aspects of the novel central to its success: the nature of the protagonist and the characteristics of the style. As we have suggested, it was to these two aspects that Sorrentino emphatically turned when North Point's interest in republishing his first novel offered itself to him. Here was his opportunity of revising the narrative strategy of his novel so that it would truly earn every syllable of praise directed towards its protagonist and its style in the 1966 comments and so that it would be fully in accord with his aesthetic assumptions and practices.</field>

Williams' Prose," New American Review , No. 15 (1972), pp. 196-197. 7 Any time a novel is reset for a new edition, the opportunity for changes in punctuation arises. Short of seeing marked proof or marked copy, we will probably never know if the forty changes in accidentals originated with Sorrentino, an editor, or a typesetter, especially since there are few recognizable patterns in them. Three times hyphens were added or two words became one; twice italics were deleted and once added; and parentheses were deleted twice. Commas were deleted seven times to no particular effect other than slightly more correct punctuation and, in one instance, the clarification of meaning: "I guess it is a shock to her, she's been good, to me , and" (158) loses a comma (120), thus focussing the shock entirely on the wife. All the comma deletions come in the last sixty pages of the novel, but the five additions are spread throughout, all of which pair with another comma to set off a phrase or clause within a sentence. Several times, commas were raised to question marks (seven times) or to exclamation marks (once). Each mark is technically more correct: "he shouted" (114) does seem to need the exclamation mark, and the seven other instances are phrased as questions. Finally, several commas become periods, thus changing one sentence to two, and occasional subordinate phrasing is removed, thus creating two sentences. In nearly every instance, punctuation revisions appear on pages where substantive revision has occurred. This suggests that Sorrentino is probably responsible for both types of revision. For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that Sorrentino occasionally inverted word order, changing phrasing such as "pass it by" (21) to "pass by it" (13) or "grim and gay" (162) to "gay or grim" (124), the latter possibly effected to parallel "manic and bitter" and "success or failure" which appear in the same sentence.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Correlated Type Sizes and Names for the Fifteenth Through Twentieth Century by John Richardson Jr. *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bibliographical theorists such as Fredson Bowers and G. Thomas Tanselle have noted that bibliographers record the vertical measurement for twenty lines of unleaded type as part of their analytical descriptions of printed books. 1 In addition, Bowers has advised recording the appropriate point size as well as the common name for the printing types found in books. Regrettably, however, bibliographers do not usually have the actual type in hand as do printers; rather they must deal with the printed image—the type face as it appears on the page. Nor do they always have specimen sheets or other primary sources at hand to consult regarding the common names. Furthermore, some previous efforts to reconcile this situation have been flawed in their mathematical calculations and as a result have misled unsuspecting researchers. This article seeks to alleviate those problems by providing a reliable comparative study of the sizes and names of type. Specifically, it attempts (1) to furnish extensive millimeter measurements for twenty lines of type, (2) to calculate accurately the equivalent measurements in inches and in pica as well as fournier and didot points, and (3) to correlate the common type names for seven countries over six centuries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Background and Sources At the turn of the century, Robert Proctor first employed a measure of twenty-lines of type to avoid the difficulty of the apparent size. McKerrow preferred ten-line measurements but A. W. Pollard resisted this change. Ten-line measurements make sense; they would save some time counting lines and the division by ten would be easier. John Tarr, in his 1946/47 Library article "The Measurement of Type" (5th ser. 1: 248-249) offered a useful table of 49 to 220 millimeters with the corresponding values in inches, pica points, and old bodies. Unfortunately, his sixty-one calculations, either by calculating machine, slide rule, or longhand, contain sixteen significant rounding errors and one serious typographic mistake. No one has published a correlated table since then. In 1949, Bowers codified the work of the preceding bibliographers, thereby encouraging successive generations to use the twenty-line measurement. Nevertheless, one cannot easily convert from the measurement of the printed image to the exact specification of point size. Interested bibliographers have still needed to consult a variety of sources. For the first time, this article draws together the work of many different bibliographers, including the following. Fifteenth Century Charles Enschedé, Typefoundries in the Netherlands from the Fifteenth to the Nineteenth Century . Translated by Harry Carter. Edited by Lotte Hellinga. Haarlem: Stichting Museum Enschedé, 1978. The common names for English, Dutch, French, and German typesizes are entered on the correlated table using the inch measurements from his convenient "Table of Body-Sizes" (pp. 455-456). Sixteenth Century Harry Carter, A View of Early Typography Up to About 1600 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969). A chart entitled "Old Names for [Twelve] Bodies of Type in English, French, German, and Dutch and Typical Values for Twenty Lines in Millimetres" appears on page 127 and shows the actual body and face of type alongside the common names. These names are entered into the correlated table using the millimeter measurements. H. D. L. Vervliet, Sixteenth-Century Printing Types (Amsterdam: Menno Hertzberger, 1968). The author conveniently summarizes his work in a table on page 16 labelled "Synopsis of the [20 different] Names for the Sizes of Type, Used in This Book." Unfortunately, he miscalculates the didot points in at least five of the largest sizes of type. In three instances he rounds up his pica point sizes (83, 52, and 15.5) rather than down. Nevertheless, he provides English names for several typesizes and these are entered into the correlated table based on his twenty line millimeter measurements. Seventeenth Century Joseph Moxon, Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing , edited by Herbert Davis and Harry Carter. 2nd ed. (London: Oxford University Press, 1962). Regrettably, the reproduction of his "Prove" is not an exact size facsimile so that measurements cannot be taken directly from it. On page 21, however, Moxon provides a table of ten common names and their equivalent measurement for one foot. The editors' note suggests that "names were given loosely to bodies varying very much in size. . . ." Nevertheless, these ten names have been added to the correlated table by dividing Moxon's figures into twelve to obtain the fractions of an inch. Eighteenth Century Harry Carter, Fournier on Typefounding; the Text of the Manuel Typographique (1764-1766) (London: Soncino Books, 1930). On page xxxv ff, a "Table of Body-Sizes" lists the English old body and Fournier name along with the equivalent in English inches and pica points. The names are entered in the correlated table using Carter's highly accurate English inch equivalents. Philip Gaskell, "Type Sizes in the Eighteenth Century," Studies in Bibliography 5 (1952-53): 147-151. On page 151, Gaskell records sixteen text types by name along with the body size in pica points (column B) and a twenty-line measurement in column C. Common names are entered into the table using his measurements in column C. Talbot B. Reed, A History of the Old English Letter Foundries (London: E. Stock, 1887); rev. ed. by A. F. Johnson (Folkestone: Dawsons, 1974). Drawing upon various "specimen-books of the eighteenth century" Reed presents a table on page 32 giving eighteen different names of type from England, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, and Spain along with the respective pica point size. Derivations of these names are treated on pp. 35-40 of his history. Allan Stevenson, Catalogue of the Botanical Books in the Collection of Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt , Vol. 2, Part 1: Introduction to Printed Books, 1701-1800 (Pittsburgh: Hunt Botanical Library, 1961). To create his "Common Type Sizes in the Eighteenth Century" on p. ccxxviii, Stevenson relies on many different sources. His ten-line millimeter measurements have been doubled and the eight English common names entered into the correlated table directly. Then, for six other countries, including Sweden, 2 he provides the modern pica points and the common names for nine more type sizes. Again, these names have been entered into the table based on the stated Pica point equivalent. Nineteenth Century Giambattista Bodoni, Manuale Tipografico , 2 vol. (Parma: Presso la Vedova, 1818). Bodoni's work provides twenty-two "Serie di Caratteri Latini" or common Italian names for type sizes on pages 1-144 of volume one. Twenty-line millimeter measurements have been taken directly from the original and the names entered into the table. Although several other works, such as De Vinne, base their information on Bodoni, he seems to have worked "only to please himself" 3 and must be approached with caution. See Appendix A for an indication of some of the problems encountered measuring his types. Charles H. Timperley, The Printer's Manual (London: H. Johnson, 1838; reprint ed., English Bibliographical Sources, No. 7. London: Gregg Press, 1965). Comparable names for nineteen different sizes are provided for England, France, Germany, and Holland on page 56. A second table gives the number of lines to a foot for eighteen different bodies; these have been divided into twelve inches to provide the decimal equivalent, and the common names have been added to the correlated table. Twentieth Century Theodore Low De Vinne, The Practice of Typography: A Treatise on the Processes of Type-making, the Point System, the Names, Sizes, Styles, and Prices of Plain Printing Types , 2nd ed. (New York: Century Company, 1902). His Plain Printing Types contains the common names for twenty-seven American and English types. Their respective point equivalency size is found on page 54, followed by the names of another twenty-seven French and German types and their Corps (i.e., didot) size. Finally, he draws upon Bodoni's Manuale Tipografico (1818) for the Italian names which are accompanied by the equivalent Spanish and Dutch names on page 56. In addition, the "Relation of Different Bodies of Type to each other and to standard linear measures [i.e., in inches, feet, and square feet] by the Bruce System of Geometrical Progression" appears on page 148. The discussion of common names appears in Plain Printing Types on pages 62-68. Common names are entered into the correlated table using De Vinne's pica and didot point equivalents. Lucien A. Legros and John C. Grant, Typographical Printing-Surfaces; The Technology and Mechanism of Their Production (London: Longmans, Green, and Company, 1916) provides a handy "Table 6—Comparative Table giving the names of [23 different] English and foreign type and their dimensional relationships in Fournier, Didot, and standard points, in inches, and in millimetres." The pica-to-inches and the didot-to-inches columns are quite accurate, matching the correlated table almost exactly even to the third or fourth place. Daniel B. Updike, Printing Types: Their History, Forms, and Use, A Study in Survivals . 3rd ed., 2 vol. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1962). On page 27, Updike presents a table labelled "Names of Sizes of Type in Various Countries." Covering eighteen pica point sizes, ranging from 4.5 to 48-point, he lists the equivalent names in England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Spain. The common names are entered into the correlated table using the pica point measurements.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Method of Calculation The measurements generated for columns two through four presented in the following tables are derived from the millimeter column. To calculate the inches for the second column, the millimeters were multiplied by .03937 and divided by twenty. A pica point is equal to 1/72 of inch or .013888 inch. The figures were calculated by multiplying by millimeters by 2.83482 and dividing by twenty. The Fournier point is equal to .013728 of an English inch while the didot point is equal to .0148 of an inch; millimeters were multiplied by 2.6601 and divided by twenty. A consistently high degree of mathematical accuracy for the calculations has been assured by using "1-2-3," Release 2.01 from the Lotus Development Corporation. To check these calculations, note that 508 millimeters per twenty lines equals 1.0000 inches or 72.00 pica points.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Use of the Tables Bibliographers may approach the following tables in either of two ways: (1) from their twenty-line measurements which may range from fifteen through 1088 millimeters, or (2) from the name of a specific type size. In the latter case, the table conveniently provides the equivalent common foreign name for the type already known. With Millimeter Measurements Bibliographers in the former case will be undertaking original measurements directly from books and should heed the following advice. Twenty-line measurements should only be based on lines set solid. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to know whether there is leading between the lines. A convenient test for the presence of leading is to measure the interline spacing between a descender in the top line and an ascender in the next line down. A measurement between .5 and 1.0 millimeter usually suggests that the text is set solid. Comparisons with other work may be complicated by the fact that bibliographers have not taken their measurements in a consistent manner. Some variation occurs because of ink squash—perhaps as much as one millimeter on the top and bottom of the sample. Thus, the use of a 6-10X power glass is recommended to determine the border of the type impression (Barker Interview). Additional variation can enter when one measures paper that is cockled or that has stretched or shrunk. In measurements taken for the Catalogue of Books Printed in the XVth Century Now in the British Museum (1908), for instance, A. W. Pollard notes up to a two per cent deviation ("Introduction," p. xx). Likewise, Philip Gaskell reports that "Paper shrinkage, which was more pronounced across the chain-lines than along them, generally reduced its dimensions by about 1 per cent, and occasionally by as much as 2½ per cent" ( New Introduction to Bibliography [1972; repr. with corr. 1974], p. 13). These differences can be minimized by taking measurements on several different leaves. 4 More importantly, Proctor measured "from the top of the short letters in line 1 to the bottom of the short letters in line 20, no account being taken of the tails on the longer letters." 5 As a consequence, his calculations are off by a fraction of an inch, as are measurements from the top of an ascender (e.g., h or l) in the first line to the bottom of a descender (e.g., g or y) in the twentieth line. The most accurate way is to begin any place in line one and measure to the same spot in line twenty-one. Any twenty-line measurement can be checked by measuring the type-page height and multiplying this figure by twenty and then dividing the product by the number of lines. This result should closely approximate the twenty-line measurement, although because the text type page measurement is usually taken to be the height from the text's highest ascender to its lowest descender, the result of the formula will not be precisely accurate. With the Bruce System Second, the measurement in inches will help bibliographers examining more recent books, especially American ones. Calculations in inches have been carried to four places to the right of the decimal point. Such precise information will serve those dealing with books from the nineteenth century which have been set in type measured by the so-called Bruce System of Geometrical Progression, which is calculated to at least four decimal points (De Vinne, pp. 147-149). Although a rather curious system today, it was the rational approach of George Bruce's "based on the theory that bodies of type should increase by arithmetical progression—that small pica should be made as much larger than long primer as bourgeois was larger than brevier" (Updike, p. 33). His system, however, was not widely adopted outside of his own foundry. With Point Systems In other cases the bibliographer may only know the point size. Note, however, that typefoundries in different countries use different measurement systems for body sizes of type. In Anglo-American countries, the Pica Point System, originating in 1878, has been widely adopted since England led the way in 1898. 6 One Pica point is equal to .013888 of an inch. Earlier on the continent Simon P. Fournier (generally known as Fournier le jeune) advanced his "point" system in 1737 (see his Tables des Proportions qu'il faut observer entre les caracteres or Manuel Typographique , 1764); Updike reprints the 1742 table between pages 28 and 29 in volume one of his Printing Types . Many consider Fournier's system, in which a point equals .013728 of an inch, "the first successful attempt at a mathematical systematization of type-bodies." 7 The other system advocated by Françoise Ambroise Didot is widely employed on the Continent today. Based on the pied du roi —12 French or 12.7892 Anglo-American inches—one Didot point is equal to .01483 of an inch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Common Names and Dates The common names are provided in the right part of the tables following the type measurement information. As Updike points out, "at first the name was descriptive of both body and face. Later it was applied to the body only" (p. 25). Because this table is based on other scholars' work, there are minor variations in the spelling. Of course, variation in orthography is natural in the period before dictionaries when there was no standardized spelling. In any event, no attempt has been made to rationalize this situation. If two names are used for the same size of type, then that information appears in the table in a special way. For instance in Germany, Petit or Jungfer are both used for type measuring fifty-six millimeters. Consistently throughout the table, when two names are used for the same size, then these are divided by a slash, with one exception. In France the two systems, Fournier and Didot, resulted in different names, primarily because Didot took Cicéro (like Pica in England) as the standard but changed it from twelve to eleven points. Thus, in the French column only, the slash shows from which system the name derives. More specifically, when the slash appears before the common name it means that the name is taken from the Didot system. Similarly, if a slash appears after the name, it was given by Fournier. Occasionally, within the same point system one size of type has two names. If that occurs in France, then they are so indicated by an "or"; for instance, forty-three millimeters is "Jolie or Nompareille." Elsewhere, the slash simply means either name has been used by printers. Note that these common names cover many different millimeter measurements because of variations in the books each source examined. For example, Spanish Lectura ranges from 78 to 90 mm. Sources for each millimeter figure are provided, however.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For the Future The next step should be to identify type specimens and take measurements directly from these sources. Updike in his "Chronological List of Specimens" cites 124 specimens for a start. As it now stands, the correlated tables which follow are of use primarily when there are at least two consecutive lines of the same type, and when those lines are set solid. It would be helpful to have a guide for identifying type which appeared in a single line and especially in lead ones. Another convenience would be to have the type face measurements, as do several of the sources already cited above.

      <field name="heading_text">More on the Compositors of the First Edition of Don Quixote , Part II by R. M. Flores</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In my article "The Compositors of the First Edition of Don Quixote , Part II", Journal of Hispanic Philology , 6 (1981), 3-44, I concluded that five workmen, compositors F. H, I, and J, and apprentice Z, had set the text of the first edition of Cervantes's Don Quixote , Part II (Juan de la Cuesta, Madrid, 1615). This overall conclusion still stands. I allotted the setting of gatherings as follows: Compositor F: gathering A Compositor H: gatherings B and D Compositor I: gatherings ¶, C, E-Aa, Cc, Dd, Ff, Hh, Kk, Mm, and 2N (apprentice Z: pages ¶7 r , I4 v , O1 r , O1 v , O2 r , O2 v , O7 r , O7 v , O8 r , O8 v , S1 r , S1 v , S2 r , S2 v , S7 v , V1 r , V1 v , V2 r , V2 v , V7 r , V7 v , V8 r , V8 v , Dd6 r , and Hh1 v ) Compositor J: gatherings Bb, Ee, Gg, Ii, and Ll I noted, however, that apprentice Z had probably set more pages than I was able to account for with the textual and typographical evidence at hand, and that another apprentice might have helped compositor J with his stints. The reasons for these caveats were the close similarities between the setting habits and spelling preferences of compositor I and apprentice Z, and the many puzzling typographical inconsistencies one finds throughout the book. Then I discovered that both formes of the inner sheet of gatherings A and G, and both formes of the outer sheet of gathering Q had been set anew and machined for a second printing. The copies made up entirely of sheets from the first printing were classified as belonging to family group A, and those having the three sheets from the second printing as belonging to family group B. 1 In this article I shall limit myself to re-examining the setting patterns and the distribution of labour in four gatherings of copies belonging to family group A of Don Quixote , Part II: gatherings B, L, M, and Y. All quotations are from copy Serís 12 of the Hispanic Society of America; references are by page and line. The different widths of the leading separating lines of type in formal breaks of the text set in pages belonging to the same gathering, and the countless irregularities in the numbers of quads, contractions, characters, and abbreviations used by the compositors who worked on the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II strongly suggest that many formes of this job were set from cast-off copy. 2 Non-sequential setting took place throughout most of the work and can be detected already in the first gatherings of the alphabetical sequence, some gatherings evincing this process more clearly than others. When a compositor thought that he was not going to be able to fit the text of the cast-off copy in his stint he began taking immediate, and not infrequently drastic, steps to forestall this mishap. Setting extra contractions, running words together, failing to set leading between text and titles, making pages with more lines of text than the normal number of lines, and widening the opening of the composing stick are all common compositorial practices designed to fit more text per line and per page than a stint would usually take. These measures are relatively easy to detect and explain. A practice which is difficult to uncover is when a compositor either was given or purposely took fewer pages of cast-off copy than those needed, thus altogether avoiding the possibility of having any text left over at the end of his stint. In such a case the compositor knew from the start that he did not have to worry about overrunning his stint and could, in fact, begin setting more quads, fewer abbreviations and contractions, and wider leadings than was his usual practice. All these irregularities may, if one is not thoroughly familiar with the compositor's normal setting habits, be misleadingly regarded as characteristic of the compositor. In order to illustrate the complexities of the setting patterns followed by the compositors during the setting of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, I shall first examine a gathering set entirely by one compositor. Gathering B, set by compositor H, shows clear-cut signs of having been set in an unconventional fashion; see Table 1. 3 At least five possible explanations for the irregular per-page distribution of quads, contractions, and characters, and the different widths of the leadings used in these pages could be advanced, namely: (1) inconsistent compositorial habits, (2) type shortages, (3) setting by more than one compositor, (4) setting by formes from cast-off copy, or (5) a combination of any of these possibilities. In my opinion, explanations 1 to 3 should be ruled out. I have found no textual or typographical evidence to suggest that more than one compositor might have set type for gathering B. Type shortages and compositorial inconsistencies were not uncommon phenomena during the handpress period, but one would expect such shortages and inconsistencies to occur at random and, consequently, to appear in the printed text independent of page format. In fact, only possibility 4 can fully explain all the typographical irregularities shown on Table 1 without resorting to any of the other possible explanations for further support. When one separates the figures entered in Table 1 into two groups, according to whether they occur in the inner or in the outer sheet of the gathering, and adds them up, the contrast between the numbers of quads and the numbers of contractions and characters set in each sheet becomes too striking to be coincidental. The majority of contractions and characters was set in the pages belonging to the inner sheet of the gathering, whereas the majority of quads appears on the pages of the outer sheet (the inner sheet has 81 quads, 181 contractions, and 12860 characters; the outer sheet has 127 quads, 48 contractions, and 12709 characters). The inverse relationship between the numbers of quads, and the numbers of contractions and characters set per sheet (more quads / few contractions and fewer characters; fewer quads / more contractions and more characters) suggests that compositor H altered his setting stride whilst working on this gathering. What could have happened is that the pressmen ran out of formes and asked compositor H to finish another forme for them. Compositor H might have obliged by casting off copy and begun setting in a non-sequential fashion. One can deduce from the contrast between the number of contractions, characters, and quads set in pages B1 r to B3 v and those set in page B4 r (the first line of this page has three contractions!), that compositor H began setting from cast-off copy soon after he had finished setting type for page B3 v . Because compositor H had four pages of the outer sheet already set (B1 r , B1 v , B2 r , and B2 v ) and only two of the inner sheet (each page belonging to a different forme: B3 r , outer forme, B3 v , inner forme) he apparently decided to cast off copy for pages B7 v and B8 r and set these pages first in order to complete and impose a forme for the pressmen to run (inner forme of the outer sheet). The printer's copy had a chapter division in the cast-off copy allotted to these pages; therefore he did not bother to alter his setting habits in any substantial way, and when he finished setting pages B7 v and B8 r he found himself with an extra line of type. Because the last line of Chapter 4 (B8 r , 25) consists of only one word the compositor could have pulled out the quads he had set on the upper section of the page, justified these lines of type anew, and moved up the last word of the chapter to save one entire line; but he must have been in a hurry to meet the pressmen's needs because instead he merely substituted a narrower than normal leading for the one he had initially set between the text and the chapter-title for Chapter 5, thus saving both time and a lot of work for himself. 4 If these premises are correct we could further speculate that compositor H could have begun setting type for pages B7 r and B8 v using more contractions and fewer quads than was his usual practice, in an attempt to avoid finishing with more lines than he needed for these pages. The result probably was that he ended one-half line of type short, which he could have filled out by developing some contractions and increasing the number of quads already set. Instead compositor H apparently resorted, once again, to a more practical though less appropriate manner of dealing with the problem. He introduced a paragraph division where in all likelihood none occurred in his copy (B8 v , between lines 2 and 3), even though he had to readjust thirty-two lines of type. 5 The remaining pages of the stint were apparently set in a similar fashion, pages B4 v , B5 r , and B6 v first (for the outer forme of the inner sheet) and pages B4 r , B5 v , and B6 r last (for the inner forme of the inner sheet) because of the progressive increase of contractions and decrease of quads set per page in these groups of pages. As before, the text of the cast-off copy did not fit in the assigned pages exactly, and compositor H found himself with an overrun for each set of pages. To absorb the overruns, compositor H set a narrower leading in page B5 v , and the considerable number of contractions set in this page and in pages B4 r , B6 r , and B6 v suggest that he must have pulled out a substantial number of types (vowels, m's, n's, q's) replacing them with the appropriate contractions (vowels with a tilde, q͂'s; see note 4). But the adjustments he made to the pages of the inner forme did not, apparently, suffice to absorb the entire overrun (approximately four lines of text), because there seems to have been some tampering with the text of the printer's copy. A passage from pages B5 v and B6 r reads: "Eſſo es coſa facil, y no acontecimiento | nueuo, que lo meſmo le ſucedio a Sacripãte, quando eſtã | do en el cerco de Albraca, con eſſa miſma inuencion le ſa-|cô el cauallo de entre las piernas aquel famoſo ladron lla-|mado Brunelo" (B5 v -B6 r ). In the printer's copy this excerpt must have had a reference identifying the speaker; e.g., dixo or interrumpió don Quixote . 6 But compositor H left out this textual reference in order, presumably, to make the text of his copy fit in the pages he had not as yet imposed. By omitting this clause compositor H saved an additional space equal to at least eighteen types. This typographical and textual evidence leaves no room for doubt. I am virtually certain that pages B4 r to B8 v were set from cast-off copy and that the progressive decrease in the numbers of quads and the progressive increase in the numbers of contractions and characters set per page as well as the use of narrower than normal leadings can only lead to the setting order shown in Table 2. If one accepts the non-seriatim order of setting proposed in Table 2, the pieces of this typographical and textual puzzle all fall neatly into place. More important, the unconventional manner in which pages B4 r to B8 v were set is a clear warning to the investigator that other gatherings of the first edition of Part II might also have been set in a similar fashion, as indeed they were. In "The Compositors of the First Edition of Don Quixote , Part II", I stated that because the "typographical evidence supplied by gatherings B and D" was inadequate, I could not tell "exactly whether or not [compositor H] was setting from cast-off copy", and that only six of the twenty-nine gatherings assigned to compositor I had been set from cast-off copy (p. 39). I was wrong. The two gatherings assigned to compositor H were both set in this fashion, as was the majority of gatherings assigned to compositor I. It would be somewhat repetitious and, I think, unnecessary for my purposes here to study every gathering of the first edition of Part II in the same depth as I have re-examined gathering B, but three other gatherings of this edition do beg for attention. The majority of pages belonging to gatherings L, M, and Y show, like pages B4 r to B8 v , clear typographical signs of having been set in a non-sequential order; but in the case of these three gatherings I am concerned not so much with the order in which the pages were set as with whether or not the compositors speeded the output of formes by each working on a different section of the same gathering concurrently. Striking variations in the number of quads, contractions, and characters set per page, and on the thickness of leadings used, are useful typographical data to determine whether or not a gathering, a sheet, or a forme has been set from cast-off copy, provided that the entire text of the section being examined has been set by one compositor. This kind of typographical evidence should, however, be approached with caution when it is being used to delimit the stints of different compositors each working from cast-off copy on different pages belonging to the same gathering. True, different compositors usually took different precautionary measures when setting from cast-off copy, absorbing overruns and distributing shortages of text in different ways; but one frequently finds the same compositor resorting to different solutions to solve similar typographical problems. Spelling preferences are more reliable indicators than typographical evidence because they are not last-minute responses to unforeseen typographical complications and they can, in most instances, be followed throughout a job. As I was revising my findings concerning the setting of gathering B, I noticed that compositor H had set all occurrences of the word sé (I know) appearing on gatherings B and D with a short s and an accented ê (see pages B3 v , 24; B4 v , 11; B6 r , 9 and 16; B6 v , 28; B7 v , 5 and 17; B8 v , 8 and 10; D2 v , 8; D3 v , 3; and D7 r , 21) vis-à-vis ſe/ſê , which were the forms preferred by the other compositors. When I referred to the concordance of my control edition of Don Quixote I discovered that six other occurrences of the form sê appear in a gathering which I had originally assigned to compositor I (see pages L6 v , 22; M1 r , 7 and 10; M7 r , 29; M7 v , 23; and M8 v , 5) and that these gatherings also have five occurrences of the forms ſe/ſê (see pages L2 r , 15; L7 r , 15; L8 v , 29; and M6 r , 2 and 3). Table 3 shows the distribution of these variants. The six occurrences of the variant sê appear on pages belonging to the inner sheet of gathering L and to the outer sheet of gathering M. The five occurrences of the variant ſe/ſê appear on pages belonging to the outer sheet of gathering L and to the inner sheet of gathering M. This discriminating distribution of variants cannot be coincidental. Two workmen, compositors H and I, must have shared the setting of gatherings L and M, and they were in all likelihood setting by formes and concurrently. That this highly practical manner of distribution of labour between different compositors or between a compositor and an apprentice did in effect take place during the setting of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, has already been shown in the above mentioned article (pp. 48 to 50); thus, these new findings should not strike one as unduly surprising. Nine spelling variants occurring in gatherings L and M support this theory; see Table 4. The nine spelling variants listed on the left-hand column of Table 4 clearly show that pages L5 v (variants 1 and 7), L6 r (variant 2), L6 v (variant 9), M1 r (variants 3 and 9), M1 v (variants 3 and 4), M2 r (variants 5 and 7), M2 v (variant 6), M7 r (variant 9), M7 v (variants 7 and 9), M8 r (variant 7), and M8 v (variants 7, 8, and 9) were not set by compositor I, whose characteristic corresponding spelling variants appear on the right-hand column. These pages must, therefore, have been set by compositor H, whose characteristic spellings they bear. But what about the other pages of the inner sheet of gathering L (pages L3 r , L3 v , L4 r , L4 v , and L5 r ) which show no variant characteristic of this compositor? Considering that pages L6 r , L6 v , M2 v , M7 r , and M8 r have only one variant each it is not too daring to conclude that pages L3 r to L5 r were also set by compositor H even though they have no spelling variant to back up this assumption; but the fact that the five pages showing no compositorial variant characteristic of compositor H follow one another is suspicious because one would expect to find such pages not as a group but rather interspersed amongst the other pages of the inner sheet of gathering L. The deliberate omission of some words occurring in this section of the gathering is also suspicious. The first reading of the first line of page L5 v does not tally with the catchword of the preceding page: (L5 r , 34) . . . ojos. | Con | cuchauan . . .(L5 v , 1; the printer's copy probably read, ". . . ojos. Con grandiſima atencion eſcuchauan . . .", see FCE, lines 26725 and 26726). It is unlikely that a compositor setting two consecutive pages would have made such an error. If one now refers back to Table 4 one soon realizes that the readings "eſcuſara" (L4 v ) and "deſpertara" (L5 r ) which were entered under compositor H as the only exceptions to variant 7 are, in fact, not exceptions at all but rather readings characteristic of compositor I. In other words, compositor I set thirteen pages of gathering L (L1 r —L5 r and L7 r —L8 v ), whereas compositor H set only three pages of this gathering (L5 v —L6 v ). And the presence of some outstanding typographical irregularities clearly implies that when the compositors were working on gatherings L and M they were setting concurrently and from cast-off copy. 7 Furthermore, the number and distribution of the quads set before commas and contractions appearing on page L5 r (seven of the ten quads set before commas appear on lines 4 to 8, and the sixteen contractions—seven of which are q͂'s—appear on the last twenty-one lines of the page) strongly suggest (1) that compositor I decided or, more likely, was asked to cast off copy when he was in the middle of setting page L5 r for which he had already set from thirteen to fifteen lines of type, (2) that he probably kept one entire page of the printer's copy to complete his page, 8 and (3) that he immediately began setting fewer quads and more contractions than was his usual practice. Lastly, from the type of error occurring between pages L5 r and L5 v one can deduce that despite the cautionary measures taken by compositor I he was unable to fit into the number of lines he had available the entire text of the manuscript page, whereupon he omitted the text he could not fit in his stint with no concern whatsoever for the textual gap he was creating. 9 Another compositorial error that can be explained once one realizes that casting off copy and setting concurrently were common practices at the Madrigal-Cuesta press when a job had to be set and run in a hurry, as no doubt had the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, occurs in gathering Y. On page Y2 r the text reads: "Si la ſente͂cia paſſada de la bolſa del ganadero mouio â admiraciõ a los circũſtantes, [la del labrador y el ſaſtre] les prouocô a riſa" (lines 14 and 15). The problem lies in the fact that Sancho's judgment concerning "la bolſa del ganadero", which the text announces as having already taken place, does not in fact begin until the middle of page Y3 r (line 13). This textual error cannot be authorial. In Cervantes's manuscript Sancho's judgment concerning the cattleman's pouch must have preceded that of the farmer and the tailor. Such a substantial transposition is most likely the result of an accidental shifting of manuscript pages. If this theory is correct one should be able to reconstruct a hypothetical printer's copy of the entire episode of the cattleman's pouch by assigning nineteen lines of type set for each manuscript page (see note 8) and adjusting the number of lines of type set according to the abnormal increases in the number of types saved by the use of contractions (approximately forty en types make a full line of type). Originally the episode of the cattleman's pouch must have begun and ended in a slightly different fashion than it now does in the printed text, but the words "vna | muger" (Y3 r , 13-14) and "admirados" (Y4 r , 20) encompass the entire episode without leaving any textual gaps; see Table 5. It is crystal clear from Table 5 that the episode of the cattleman's pouch fits, as was to be expected, in exactly four manuscript pages or, more pointedly, in exactly two sheets of paper written on both sides. The theory propounding the shifting of sheets can thus be taken one step further. Like gatherings B, L, and M, gathering Y shows some of the most common typographical irregularities one finds in gatherings set from cast-off copy: pages Y1 v and Y2 r each has thirty-five lines instead of the normal thirty-four lines per page; no leading was set between a poem and the text on page Y5 v nor between the text and a letter on page Y8 r ; two narrower than normal leadings appear on page Y4 r ; a leading was set between the running title and a chapter-title on page Y6 v ; an unnecessary paragraph division occurs on page Y1 r ; and the number of contractions set per page varies from 4 (Y8 v ; six types saved) to 69 (Y1 v ; ninety types saved). There is no question in my mind that the great majority of pages belonging to this gathering were set from cast-off copy. Moreover, the per page distribution of contractions and quads and the location of the pages where the other typographical anomalies occur strongly suggest that gathering Y was set by formes; see Table 6. It is no coincidence that the pages belonging to the outer formes (usually the first to be set for each sheet) have fewer contractions and more quads per page than those belonging to the inner formes. 10 It is no coincidence that the typographical anomalies that suggest that the compositor had more text than was needed occur in the inner formes (see pages Y1 v , Y2 r , Y4 r , Y5 v , and Y8 r ) and those showing that the compositor had less text than was needed occur in the outer formes (see pages Y1 r and Y6 v ). One should now be able to reconstruct a hypothetical printer's copy for the first seven pages of gathering Y; see Table 7. In addition to the displaced episode's having to fit in an even number of manuscript pages, three other conditions must be met to make the aforementioned theories watertight: 1. all pertinent pages of the reconstructed section of the printer's copy must contain approximately nineteen lines of type each. They do so with astonishing precision: one page with 17 lines (page 12), one page with 17.5 lines (page 10), one page with 18 lines (page 3), two pages with 18.5 lines (pages 7 and 11), three pages with 19 lines (pages 4, 8, and 9), and two pages with 19.5 lines (pages 5 and 6). The average number of lines of type per manuscript page is 18.55; see Table 7. 2. the manuscript page (page 3) that preceded the displaced episode had to end with wording which could easily lead to either the episode of the cattleman's pouch or the episode of the farmer and the tailor. It does: (Y1 v , 17) "A eſte inſtãte [entrô] en el juzgado | vna muger aſsida fuertemente de vn hombre" (Y3 r , 14), 11 and "A eſte inſtãte entraron en el juzgado | dos hõbres" (Y1 v , 17-18). The only change the compositor had to make to "correct" what in all probability he thought was an error on the part of Cervantes was to substitute the word "entrô" for the plural form "entraron". 3. both episodes had to begin at the top of the recto page of the manuscript sheet. They do: top of recto page 4 (Y3 r , 14; first three characters appear on line 13, "vna") and top of recto page 8 (Y1 v , 18; first six characters appear on line 17, "dos hõ—"). Furthermore, because these essential conditions have been clearly met one can be virtually certain that manuscript pages 2 and 3 had to have been the recto and verso pages of one sheet of paper (see also pages 4 and 5, 6 and 7, 8 and 9, 10 and 11, and 12 and 13; sheets iii, iv, v, vi, and vii respectively). Once the page order of the manuscript pages used as printer's copy for this section of the book has been restored one can deduce why, when, and how the shifting of manuscript pages 4, 5, 6, and 7 must have occurred. Textual and typographical evidence suggests that the compositor who set gathering Y (compositor I) cast off copy immediately after he had finished setting the first page of the gathering. He probably tried to finish his page with the last words of manuscript page 2 to cast off copy by complete manuscript pages (see footnote 10), but he apparently found himself short of text. Rather than turning to the following manuscript page for the needed text (manuscript page 3; "eſtâ eſcrito y notado el dia", Y1 v , 1), he decided to introduce an unnecessary paragraph division (Y1 r , 6-7) even though he had to go to the trouble of rearranging the type for the remaining lines of the page. He then cast off copy for pages Y1 v to Y8 v and began setting type for the other three pages belonging to the outer forme of the outer sheet (Y2 v , Y7 r , and Y8 v ). After having finished setting the outer forme of the outer sheet compositor I turned his attention to the pages of the inner forme of the outer sheet (Y1 v , Y2 r , Y7 v , and Y8 r ). Because compositor I was setting in a nonsequential order he was still unaware that two sheets of the printer's copy (sheets iii and iv) had been accidently displaced from position A (see Table 7) to a position somewhere past manuscript sheet vii. Hence he had no reason to query the misplaced reference to the episode of the cattleman's pouch (page Y2 r ). Had he noticed this textual error in time he would have in all probability deleted the misplaced reference and reworded the sentence. The excerpt "Si la ſente͂cia paſſada de la bolſa del ganadero mouio â admiraciõ a los circũſtantes, eſta les prouocô a riſa" could have been easily changed to read, Esta sentencia provocó a risa a los circunstantes . Had the compositor made this amendment readers would have never known that the order of one of Sancho's judgments had been tampered with. Compositor I must have realized that something was amiss whilst setting type for page Y3 r (first page of the sequence for the outer forme of the inner sheet), when after having set the last line of manuscript page 13 (verso page of sheet vii) he began setting the first line of manuscript page 4 (recto page of sheet iii). 12 Because the outer forme of the outer sheet was in all probability already being run and the inner forme of the outer sheet had already been, or was being run, compositor I had no other recourse than to interpolate Sancho's judgment concerning the cattleman's pouch between the judgment dealing with the two old men and the ten escudos and the closing of Chapter 45 (pages Y3 r , 13; Y4 r , 20). Given the textual corner into which compositor I put himself, his solution to the problem of the shifted manuscript pages is more than adequate. True, editors must still deal with the misplaced reference on page Y2 r , but this editorial hurdle is a minor obstacle easy to overcome. In conclusion, one can now ascertain that the page patterns followed by the compositors during the setting of the gatherings that make up the first editions of Parts I and II of Don Quixote are far more complex than appears on the surface and that they are the result of specific circumstances which arose during the setting and running off of formes. I have studied here in some detail the differing sequences in which the pages of gatherings B and Y were set (B1 r , B1 v , B2 r , B2 v , B3 r , B3 v , B7 v , B8 r , B7 r , B8 v , B4 v , B5 r , B6 v , B4 r , B5 v , B6 r ; Y1 r , Y2 v , Y7 r , Y8 v , Y1 v , Y2 r , Y7 v , Y8 r , Y3 r , Y4 v , Y5 r , Y6 v , Y3 v , Y4 r , Y5 v , Y6 r ) and the distribution of labour in gatherings L and M (compositor I: L1 r , L1 v , L2 r , L2 v , L3 r , L3 v , L4 r , L4 v , L5 r , L7 r , L7 v , L8 r , L8 v ; compositor H: L5 v , L6 r , L6 v ; compositor I, M3 r , M3 v , M4 r , M4 v , M5 r , M5 v , M6 r , M6 v ; compositor H: M1 r , M1 v , M2 r , M2 v , M7 r , M7 v , M8 r , M8 v ). It is evident that concurrent setting and setting from cast-off copy were, at least in the case of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II, the norm rather than the exception. Cuesta must have wanted to finish the job promptly and must have asked the compositors to begin setting concurrently in order to maintain a steady supply of formes to keep pace with the pressmen. The importance that typographical and textual evidence has in disentangling the different setting habits and spelling preferences of the compositors and apprentices who set type for this work of Cervantes's and, thus, in solving and explaining the countless textual queries that face editors on every page of the first editions of Don Quixote cannot be overstressed. Press conditions may in some instances be a matter of chance. Typographical and textual evidence is not. It is a permanent and reliable record of when and how a work was set and printed. When examined closely and thoroughly understood, textual and typographical data are demonstrably trustworthy and helpful sources of information.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See my article "A Tale of Two Printings: Don Quixote , Part II", Studies in Bibliography , 39 (1986), 281-296. The formula of the first edition of Don Quixote , Part II is: 4° in eights, ¶ 8 A-Mm 8 2N 4 , 1-8 1-280 281-284 (584 pp.). 2 The compositors set mainly spaces before punctuation marks, but at times they also set quads. Here I use the term "quad" to designate both pieces of type regardless of width. I use the term "character" to designate ordinary sorts of type, not special symbols. 3 In Table 1 the contraction q͂ has been counted as two contractions because its use saves two characters (q͂ que). Ligatures have been counted as one character each because a ligature is one type. Leadings and lines of type not entirely filled with characters (titles, lines of poetry, end of paragraphs) have been averaged taking into account the usual unber of characters per full line of the page under consideration. Only twelve lines out of a possible total of five hundred and forty-four have been averaged; see pages B1 v (four lines), B5 v (three lines), B8 r (four lines), and B8 v (one line). 4 By introducing eighteen contractions (including three q͂'s) to eliminate a total of twenty-one sorts of type, compositor H saved an entire line at the close of Chapter 3 (B5 v , 1 to 14). 5 Only twenty-five paragraph divisions occur within the text proper in the entire book; see my old-spelling control edition of Don Quixote , University of British Columbia Press, 1988 (FCE for Flores Control Edition), vol. 2 at page xii, lines 20 to 30. It may be worthwhile noting here that the paragraph break occurs in the middle of the line (B8 v , 2), thus greatly facilitating the displacement of text which could thus be moved by half or near-half lines of type thereby requiring only minor adjustments. 6 For other compositorial omissions of references to the identity of characters see FCE, vol 1 at page xxxvi, lines 31 to 43. 7 An unnecessary paragraph division (L5 v ), four wider than normal leadings (L1 v and L5 v ), two narrower than normal leadings (M6 v ), one extra line of type (M6 r ), and strikingly dissimilar numbers of quads (from o to 33; pages M3 r and L2 r respectively) and contractions set per page (from o to 68; pages L5 v and M6 r respectively). 8 Nineteen average full lines of type set correspond to one page of Cervantes's manuscript; see my article "Cervantes at Work: The Writing of Don Quixote , Part I", Journal of Hispanic Philology , 3 (1979), at pages 148-149. The manuscript page retained by compositor I probably ended with the syllable "eſ—". 9 The blatant disregard shown by compositor I towards the text of his copy could be the unhappy result of his having been asked to cast off copy when he was in the middle of setting a page and of his having to share with another compositor a section of a gathering which in all probability had originally been assigned to him alone. 10 The fact that page Y2 v has a substantial number of contractions suggests that the compositor was probably casting off copy by complete manuscript pages and sheets, which was the most practical, though not necessarily the most accurate, way for estimating cast-off copy; hence he had to absorb in this page an overrun which he did not want to pass to page Y3 r . Setting the pages of the outer forme of a sheet first was the most common method used when setting from cast-off copy because if an overrun occurred the compositor could leave the extra text aside to be set later on as part of the cast-off copy for the pages of the inner forme; see Table 6, cf., for instance, pages Y1 r → Y1 v -Y2 r , Y7 r → Y7 v -Y8 r . 11 The word "vna" is actually the last word on line 13, and line 17 actually ends with the readings "dos hõ—", but these minor discrepancies are to be expected. When a compositor was setting in sequential order there was usually no reason why he should strive to end a full line of type with the last word of a manuscript page unless, of course, there was a formal break in the printer's copy (paragraph division, beginning of a poem, chaptertitle, etc.) or the compositor was either casting off copy (Y1 r , 34) or setting the last line of a page belonging to cast-off copy (Y2 r , 35; Y2 v , 34). 12 When setting by formes from cast-off copy, a textual discrepancy arising from the accidental shifting of manuscript sheets can occur only between pages belonging to different sheets (manuscript pages 13 and 4) and would stand out clearly only if both pages are being set in sequential order one immediately after the other as part of either the same page of type (Y3 r ) or consecutive pages belonging to the same forme (Y3 v —Y4 r ).</field>
