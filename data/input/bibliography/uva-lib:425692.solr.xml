      <field name="heading_text">English Publishing and the Mass Audience in 1852 by Richard D. Altick *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the very beginnings of publishing as a profit-making enterprise, the publisher's estimate of the size of a book's potential audience, its willingness to pay the price he will ask, and above all its current tastes, has been the major consideration in his decision whether or not to send the manuscript on to the type-setter. The whole history of literature in the past few centuries is, in a sense, the aggregate history of such decisions. But we know very little about how publishers of various periods regarded their market. What was their conception of its numerical size? of its social composition and educational level? of its ability to pay the asking prices of books? of the manifold elements in the cultural and social background of the age which influenced the book-buying habit? Today publishers have at their disposal the results of hundreds, indeed thousands, of studies, made chiefly by library-science students and market analysis specialists, of twentieth-century reading habits and the conditions which influence them. The latest results of this continuing survey are constantly drawn upon by the publishers of mass-circulation periodicals and paper-bound books. To that degree the contemporary reading public, as delineated by modern techniques of opinion- and behavior-sampling, exerts a direct and relatively measurable influence upon what is published. Elsewhere in the trade, it is true, that influence is less direct, but it is still potent, for modern commercial publishers stake their very existence, fully as much as do the makers of detergents or deep-freeze units, upon an accurate estimate of the potential market for their product and its current likes and dislikes. When some future scholar sets out to assess the influence of the audience upon what was published in our own age, he will have a vast body of information to work upon, make of it what he will. But the present-day scholar who attempts to answer the same question for the Victorian age must deal with two quantities which are still largely unknown: x, the true nature of the Victorian reading public, and y, the average publisher's conception of it and the degree to which that conception influenced his editorial decisions. With y we shall have little to do here, except to remark that the evidence that comes down to us on the point is scanty. Shrewd though some of the Victorian publishers were, few of them, at least until the later decades of the century, seem to have bothered very much about the reading public as a whole. Most of them, with the conspicuous exception of the newcomers in the trade who unabashedly angled for the pennies and shillings of the masses, were untouched by the revolution that was going on about them. Such ideas as they had about the new audience were clouded by indifference, prejudice, and misinformation. The Victorians were statistics-conscious, even statistics-mad; they had a passion for collecting and codifying data on all sorts of other subjects—education, sanitary conditions, crime, wages, trade—but they seem never to have thought of making a thorough study of the contemporary reading public and of the place of the reading habit in the whole social scene. In this paper our business is with x . We are only beginning to understand what the Victorian audience was really like; only now are we beginning to subject to the test of original research the facile assumptions that have been so long current. 1 In the pages that follow, I shall make a retrospective audience survey for an English publisher of the year 1852. My purpose is not to measure the publishers' actual awareness of the swiftly changing audience—a task for which, as I say, our present knowledge is inadequate—but to suggest how research, aided by the perspective of a hundred years, allows us to see the mid-Victorian reading public as it might have appeared to a publisher as market-conscious as his modern counterpart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I I have chosen the year 1852 not just because there is something satisfactorily tidy in going back precisely a century. It was in the fifties, I think, that the reading public could first be called a mass public in anything like modern terms. Admittedly, people as far back as Dr. Johnson's time had been exclaiming over the increase in the number of readers, and the March of Mind was one of the most publicized phenomena of the period stretching from the 1820's to mid-century. But it was only around the fifties that the familiar phrase of "literature for the millions" ceased to be mere hyperbole and came to have a basis in sober fact. The spread of elementary education had raised the literacy rate. Popular interest in reading, generated initially by the radical press of the Reform Bill and Chartist periods, had been exploited by the proprietors of cheap sensational weekly newspapers, men like Lloyd and Reynolds, who also produced enormous quantities of melodramatic fiction in penny numbers—the famous "penny bloods." On the more decorous side, the activities of the religious denominations in spreading tracts and other edifying reading-matter broadcast among the population encouraged the reading habit. It is significant that in this decade of the 1850's one finds the first recurrent journalistic interest in the new mass market for the printed word. In 1858, for example, Wilkie Collins wrote of his discovery of "The Unknown Public" as dramatically as if he had come upon the sources of the Nile. 2 The mass audience for cheap periodicals he described had, as I have suggested, been in existence for some years before he announced his discovery of it; but the point is that it had by now become large enough and important enough to constitute an interesting and provocative subject for an article in the middle-class press, and that Collins could tell the readers of Household Words, itself a twopenny periodical for the middle classes, that there had come into being a much larger reading public lower down on the social and cultural scale. This was the era when reading first became genuinely democratized. How large was the greatest possible audience to which a publisher could appeal? By the census of 1851, the total population of England, Scotland, and Wales above the age of twenty was eleven and a half millions—an increase of more than four million adults in thirty years. 3 Of these, 31% of the males and 45% of the females were unable to sign their names to the marriage register. 4 A literacy rate based upon this test is not, of course, a reliable indication of the number who could read . Undoubtedly many men and women who could not sign their names could nevertheless master simple reading-matter. On the other hand, many who could scrawl their signatures, as a purely mechanical accomplishment, could not read at all. The two considerations may cancel each other out; in any case, evidence from other sources suggests that while a literacy rate of somewhere around 60% may be a bit low for the fifties, it is not too far off the mark. We may, therefore, write off 40% of the total adult population as not conceivably forming any market for printed matter. In addition, we must eliminate the by no means inconsiderable number of people who were on the sheer fringes of literacy and who therefore would be no more likely to buy a book or a paper than would their brethren who were in total darkness. On the other hand, we should throw in perhaps a half-million youths under twenty who might buy adult reading-matter. All these calculations are so speculative that a final figure is nothing more than a guess crowning a precarious pile of other guesses, but for the sake of hanging up some sort of goal for the ambitious Victorian publisher to strive for, let us say that, omitting the market for juvenile literature and school texts, the gross potential British reading public in 1852 was between five and six million. This optimum audience (to use a notably un-Victorian phrase) and the practising one were, of course, very different things. The only guide we have to the number of people who actually read in 1852 is sales figures, and these must always be handled with caution. For one thing, few of them are authentic beyond question; the great majority come down to us as second-hand reports or as frank guesses. For another, they include quantities of books exported to the colonies and elsewhere. But since there is no way of knowing what reduction should be made on this account, we shall have to follow the usual practice, however mistaken it may be, and let gross sales figures represent home consumption only. It must be understood, therefore, that whatever statistical conclusions are reached on this basis are bound to be on the liberal side. In 1852 occurred one of those events which periodically, perhaps every generation or so, give publishers and other students of the contemporary literary scene a fresh glimpse of the farthest limits of the reading audience. This was the amazing vogue of Uncle Tom's Cabin, the biggest sensation the English book trade had ever known. In a single fortnight in October, 1852, at least ten different editions came out, and Routledge alone was selling 10,000 copies a day. Some eighteen publishers climbed on the bandwagon; within six months of publication, the book had sold 150,000 copies, and within a year, according to one account, the total sales had reached a million and a half, a figure that includes both home and colonial distribution. 5 If we lop off an arbitrary fraction which represents export sales, and in addition exercise a measure of scholarly conservatism, we are still left with a figure of, say, a million immediate buyers. But it is obvious that a great many of those who purchased whatever edition of Uncle Tom's Cabin was suited to their particular purses seldom if ever bought any other book. These scores, if not hundreds, of thousands of nonce-readers could not by any stretch of the imagination be counted as part of a dependable audience; the figure of a million purchasers represents the ultimate extreme to which the book market could, on a very rare occasion, expand. The sales of less fantastic best-sellers of the period give us a surer indication of the size to which the market could expand at relatively more frequent intervals, the number of constant book-buyers—the irreducible minimum in the publisher's calculations—being swelled several times over by the interest of those who buy only that occasional book which is all the talk. In Memoriam is said to have sold 60,000 copies within a short time after its publication in 1850. 6 In 1852-53 Dickens' Bleak House, appearing in shilling parts, soon reached 35,000 and climbed to 40,000 before publication was completed. 7 In 1855 the third and fourth volumes of Macaulay's History of England sold 25,000 on the day of publication alone. 8 These figures suggest that the short-term sale of a highly popular book, at the original published price, could run as high as 50,000, and within a very few years, as was the case with W. H. Russell's two-volume account of the Crimean War, published in 1855-56, it could go as high as 200,000. 9 Reckoning four or five readers per copy, that again gives us an audience of, at the very most, a million— for books only of the very greatest immediate appeal . The normal book-buying audience was, of course, infinitely smaller, probably somewhere in the high tens of thousands; and of this number only a small proportion could be expected to buy a given title except in the case of a best-seller. For the ordinary book, an edition of from 500 to 1,000 copies sufficed. We must remember, though, that there was, and is, an important distinction between the book-buying public and the public which reads books but does not buy them. In 1852 the Edinburgh Review was remarking that although the demand for books had "increased tenfold upon what it was seventy years ago," "few people now buy books." The reason was, of course, that "the mass of the reading world are supplied from the subscription-library or the book-club." 10 Hence multiplying the number of copies sold by four or five to obtain the total number of readers fails to take into account the larger number through whose hands the circulating-library copies passed. Of the number initially printed of Volumes III and IV of Macaulay's History, 2,400 copies went to Mudie's Library alone; 11 and in the decade beginning in 1853, Mudie's were to buy a total of almost a million volumes. 12 Mr. Mudie himself is said to have estimated that every book in his library found "on an average, thirty readers—considerably more, in the majority of instances, as regards novels, and considerably less in the case of scientific and philosophical works." 13 So long, therefore, as a substantial proportion of an edition was sold not to individual buyers but to the libraries and to the more or less informal book clubs which then abounded, especially in the provinces, the size of the actual book-reading public could be but partially reflected by sales figures. Just as in our own day, the portion of the total reading public which habitually bought periodicals was immensely larger than that which bought books or borrowed them from the subscription libraries. As the century began its second half, the most popular periodicals were achieving circulations that greatly surpassed the record set by the Penny Magazine, which had sold 200,000 for a brief time in the early 1830's. 14 The Family Herald was in process of more than doubling its circulation, from 125,000 in 1849 to 300,000 in 1855. 15 The London Journal was approaching a circulation of 450,000, and Reynolds' Miscellany 200,000. 16 Chambers's Journal, one of the earliest successful cheap periodicals, was selling between 60,000 and 70,000. 17 In addition, there were the threepenny weekly newspapers, which were sold both to the readers of the mass-circulation periodicals and to a large class of readers who looked at nothing else. The Illustrated London News sold 140,000 a week, while the News of the World and Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper each sold in the neighborhood of 110,000 copies, and several other popular papers circulated between 40,000 and 75,000 weekly. 18 It was on the basis of such sales figures as these, reckoning three readers to a copy, that Wilkie Collins decided that the "unknown public"—the public unknown, that is, to the book publishers, the public "which lies right out of the pale of literary civilisation"—amounted to three million persons. 19 The estimate on the whole is sound, and if anything, considering the size of the typical Victorian family, conservative. All in all, there is no doubt whatever that in the 1850's Britain had an audience for printed matter immensely larger than it had ever known before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II So much for the quantitative extent of the 1852 market. But what of the economic considerations which play so vital a part in consumer analysis? In 1852 books were not quite the luxury items they had been for most of the century, but they were not, on the other hand, as readily obtainable as the reformers wished. Three years earlier one such friend of the people, the lecturer George Dawson, had told a committee of Parliament, "The fact is, we give the people in this country an appetite to read, and supply them with nothing. For the last many years in England everybody has been educating the people, but they have forgotten to find them any books. In plain language, you have made them hungry, but you have given them nothing to eat; it is almost a misfortune to a man to have a great taste for reading, and not to have the power of satisfying it." 20 The circulation figures I have just cited would seem to discredit Dawson so far as cheap periodicals are concerned, but on the score of books he was right. Original editions were priced beyond the reach of all but the distinctly prosperous. The sacrosanct three-decker novel held obstinately firm at a guinea-and-a-half, and other types of newly published literature were priced more or less to match. For the ordinary London clerk, say, who was lucky to make the thirty bob a week of which John Davidson was to sing later in the century, to buy a newly published novel would have meant the sacrifice of a week's salary. Some of the best novelists of the age, Dickens, Thackeray, and Trollope, for instance, were bringing out their newest fictions in monthly parts at a shilling apiece, and while this practice did bring the total cost of a new novel down to, say, twenty shillings, it still left the purchaser with the expense of binding up the parts. Its principal advantage was that it spread the cost over a year or two, thus making new novels available to the man who had one shilling to spend every month, but seldom twenty or thirty at a time. However, many successful works of both fiction and non-fiction were reprinted, within a few years or even a few months of original publication, in five- or six-shilling editions. Lower in the price scale was the extensive class of railway novels or yellow-backs, the forms which are now so admirably displayed in the showcase of Mr. Sadleir's affectionate bibliography. 21 In 1852 this genre was just five years old, having originated in the Parlour Library of Simms and McIntyre, whose volumes were priced at a shilling or a shilling sixpence. The immediate success of this series had forced Bentley and Colburn, the proprietors of five-shilling reprint "libraries," to come down to 2 s. 6 d. and had inspired other firms, notably that of Routledge, to compete with their own reprints at one or two shillings. 22 Though this represented the greatest movement toward cheap books since the exciting false dawn between 1828 and 1832, only current literature as a rule was published in this form, and many valuable publishers' properties—valuable both commercially and from the point of view of literature—were not made available for cheap reprints. Reprints of standard classics, best exemplified in this period by the proliferating Bohn Libraries, were 5 s. or 3 s. 6 d. These prices are list. But the year 1852 witnessed a development which for the next four decades would make the advertised prices somewhat misleading. For many years an association of publishers and certain booksellers had enforced what we today call, somewhat euphemistically, a fair-trade practices agreement, by which anyone selling the books of those publishers under the list price was boycotted. In 1852, however, the publisher John Chapman, with the powerful assistance of most of the celebrated authors of the day as well as of the Times, the Athenaeum, and Mr. Gladstone, forced the Booksellers' Association to submit their case for literary protectionism to a board of arbitration headed by Lord Campbell. The decision was that the principle of free trade, by then so firmly established in other phases of Britain's economic life, should be observed in the book trade as well. 23 As a result, down to the nineties, one could, with a little shopping about, buy a new book at a reduction of two or three pence on the shilling. 24 Hence books were not quite as expensive as the advertised prices would indicate. But how many people could afford to buy books even at this discount? It may well be that the amazing success of Uncle Tom's Cabin and the great leaps of periodical circulation were due in part to the favorable economic conditions prevailing in the early fifties. Employment was high, money was plentiful, and prices were generally low. Thus the economic barrier to book-buying was less formidable than it had been in the hungry forties or was to be in the later fifties and sixties. But it was still sufficiently high to bar great segments of the population. In 1852 about 110,000 persons had a taxable income of more than £150 a year, but of these, 75%, or about 83,000, received less than £400, 25 and one suspects that for most of them the purchase of an occasional five-shilling reprint, more frequently of a shilling railway novel, and of one or two cheap periodicals or Sunday newspapers a week would have been the extent of their spending for reading-matter. (There were no penny daily papers until after the abolition of the stamp tax in 1855.) Those who simply had to have new books about the house found it more economical to spend a guinea for a year's privileges at Mudie's than to buy books outright. In a household whose weekly income ranged from three to eight pounds little money remained after the necessities had been provided for: not even when beef was selling at 8 d. a pound. Furthermore, most of the population were worse off than those who had a taxable income. The average family of a skilled artisan had an annual income of only £90, or 34 s. a week, 26 and the hundreds of thousands of working-class families could count on far less than that. The average weekly wage in Lancashire and Cheshire was only 9 s. 6 d. a week. 27 For the great bulk of the population, then, book-buying was out of the question except for the very cheap part-issues of Salisbury Square fiction or the shilling yellow-back; what reading was done, was done in cheap periodicals, whether of the Reynolds' Miscellany or Family Herald type, and weekly newspapers, which cost only 2 d. or 3 d. As a very general conclusion, we may conjecture that the market for ordinary trade books, at the prices then prevailing, was limited to the 27,000 or so families with an annual income of more than £400, and that for the one-or two-shilling reprints, the cheapest books published, to the 110,000 families with more than £150 a year. All the rest of the readers in Britain in 1852 formed a market for cheap periodicals alone. Even among those who were financially able to be occasional patrons of the bookshop or the library, however, there were many thousands who seldom if ever stepped inside either one. In the educational experience of the great majority of the people there had been absolutely nothing to encourage a taste for reading as an adult pastime. Even among the substantial middle class, most men, and even more women, had been to school for only a few years, and while they had learned to perform the mechanical operation of reading, the books they had practised upon, books of dull, pious edification, were not calculated to give them any enduring affection for printed matter in hard covers. No incentive came from the teachers, who were themselves wretchedly uneducated. In the classroom all forces seemingly conspired to breed an everlasting distaste for reading, and anyone who knows what elementary education was like in nineteenth-century England must consider it miraculous that, under the circumstances, the reading habit was as widespread as it was. 28 Nor was this true only of the schools to which the masses of children went. The witnesses before a Parliamentary commission in the early sixties were virtually unanimous in declaring that in the great public schools of the nation no effort whatsoever was made to encourage the boys to read for pleasure or general culture, and that as a result few did. 29 Nor was the situation very much better in the universities. No doubt many readers of the Times and holders of baccalaureate degrees shared the feeling of the forthright Colonel Sibthorp, M.P. for Lincoln, when he confided to Commons in 1850 that "he did not like reading at all, and he hated it when at Oxford." 30 I am persuaded that English educational practices—which were dominated either by the Gradgrind philosophy of the age or by the decayed classical tradition—were more instrumental than any other single element in limiting the size of the nineteenth-century book-reading public. I have no illusions about the educational accomplishments of our own day, but in this respect, at least, I am certain that we do no worse than the Victorians did. In 1852, it is true, the newspapers contained what appeared to be a hopeful sign. This was the year when the first free library to be established under Ewart's Act was opened at Manchester. The orators there, as at other library dedications in the next few years, exhausted much rhetoric in hailing the public-library movement as a symbol of the spread of the reading habit among the people. But actually the movement was in no sense a popular one. Ewart's Bill was pushed through Parliament by a small band of reformers, behind whom was no strong force of opinion on the part either of the working class or of the middle class. And once local corporations were empowered to levy a small tax for library buildings, relatively few did so. Never during the rest of the century did public libraries enjoy really popular support. In town after town general apathy and, on the part of the ratepayers, vehement opposition, defeated the efforts of a minority to provide free reading facilities for the public at large. 31 Conditions of life in the Victorian era were not necessarily conducive to reading. We hear much about the way in which the sacred institution of family readings-aloud encouraged a taste for books, and undoubtedly it did. But even more powerful influences operated on the other side. For the vast majority of people, there was little time to read. Only in the textile industry had the ten-hour day been won; elsewhere the usual work week was seventy-two hours or more. Shop assistants worked eighty-five to ninety hours a week, their places of employment remaining open long into the evening. Women, unless they were well supplied with servants, had hardly any more leisure, and such leisure as they did enjoy was in inverse proportion to the number of children with whom they were blessed. The only day of theoretical rest was Sunday, but a good part of it was spent at church, and in what hours remained, one's choice of reading-matter was severely limited, in most middle-class Victorian households, by the Sabbatarian ban on any but religious books. We need not wonder, as has been pointed out more than once, that the Victorians were so well versed in Paradise Lost and The Pilgrim's Progress: they were two of the least deadly books on the list approved for Sunday reading. In fact, what with the pressure of work and the ban on secular reading on Sunday, the only extended leisure many Victorians had for reading was when they made a railway journey. It is no accident that in the early fifties the new class of cheap light literature was referred to as "railway reading", and that the biggest volume of bookselling was beginning to be accomplished at railway termini, where, in 1852, the stalls of W. H. Smith and Son were becoming familiar landmarks. 32 A long slow trip in a second-class carriage was one occasion upon which the earnest Victorian felt that a bit of self-indulgence was justified—indeed it was almost indispensable. In the railway carriage, too, the traveller might, if he were lucky, find a degree of peace not often enjoyed at home. Throughout the nineteenth century the average British family—by which I mean one of the lower middle class, probably below the income-tax level—was living in quarters far too small for it. The crowding in the homes of the working class was, of course, constantly a matter for Parliamentary remark; a missionary to the natives of Spitalfields told a committee at Westminster in 1849 that "I frequently find as many as seven or eight persons living all in one room; in that room, perhaps, there will be two looms at work, so that the noise and discomfort render it almost impossible that a working man, if he were ever so well inclined to read, could sit down and read quietly." 33 But overcrowded conditions existed among a large section of the middle class as well, because Victorian fertility notoriously had a way of outrunning Victorian income. It was a fortunate reader indeed, in any but the fairly prosperous segment of the population, who could command the solitude he needed whenever he needed it. Nor may we neglect the effect of Evangelicalism upon the size of the Victorian publisher's potential market. This most influential form of religion, which set the whole tone of life in Victorian times, immensely stimulated the reading habit, because it stressed the spiritually salutary effect of contact with the right kind of moral and religious literature at the same time that it forbade many kinds of non-literary recreation. The perusal of the printed word was as vital a part of one's journey to salvation as was listening to public sermons. The result was a huge increase in the sale of edifying works of every description. But Evangelicalism had revived and even intensified the old Puritan distrust of secular literature, and so thoroughly did this distrust permeate a great proportion of the middle class, and the church-going portion of the lower, that it remained in 1852 a strong deterrent to the reading of ordinary literature, above all fiction. 34 No Victorian publisher of ordinary trade books, in surveying his prospective market, could afford to overlook the existence of multitudes of men and women who may well have been devoted readers, but who would never think of buying the majority of titles he had on his list. These people were in the main the patrons of the specialized religious-book houses and of those general publishers who maintained strong religious lists. 35 They were, therefore, a special public, and they decreased by just so much the potential audience for general reading-matter. Much of what has been said thus far has implied a point which I now want particularly to emphasize. In some well-known discussions of English literary trends at the end of the nineteenth century and in the beginning of our own we are told that a great deal of whatever is saddening in post-Victorian literary history can be attributed to the fragmentation of what had been until recently a homogeneous public. In other words, whereas the Victorian man of letters addressed himself to the reading audience at large, his grandson had to be content with addressing a small splinter of that audience—what Arnold called, in another connection, "the saving remnant." Now as a matter of fact, no Victorian writer, no matter how popular, was read by the whole contemporary audience. 36 If any lament is to be made over the change that has occurred in the reading public during the past century, it is that the cultured minority, which normally forms the special audience of the great men of letters, has not grown apace with the growth of the total public, and indeed may have actually shrunk. But the facts forbid us to assume that the extreme social and cultural diversification of the English reading audience began, say, at the time of the Education Act of 1870, and that until then the audience was the ideal homogeneous one recalled, with a kind of wishful hindsight, in some of our literary histories. Dickens and Eliot and Thackeray and Tennyson, and for that matter G. P. R. James and Martin Tupper, wrote for only one or two publics out of the numerous ones already in existence by mid-century. Actually, however convenient the practice may be, it is inaccurate to refer to the "reading public"—singular—in any century after the fifteenth. A few moments' contemplation of the variety of Elizabethan literature, from Spenser, say, down to the lowliest chapbook, should dispose once and for all of the myth that the reading public began to break down into separate audiences only late in the nineteenth century. What the Victorian age witnessed was not the beginning of multiple publics but simply the spectacular growth in both size and influence of certain publics which had hitherto been either small or not much thought about. In 1858 Wilkie Collins distinguished four separate audiences: ". . . the religious public . . . the public which reads for information . . . the public which reads for amusement, and patronizes the circulating libraries and the railway bookstalls . . . [and] the public which reads nothing but newspapers." 37 All of these, except the last, had existed for centuries. The great difference was that the last two at least had grown prodigiously, while the cultured minority, the stable audience for the sort of writing that wins a man a place in literary history, was cast more and more into the shadows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III In 1852 publishers generally had not accommodated their policies to the various realities I have just mentioned. I am not speaking of those few firms which were busily cashing in on the development of a mass public by issuing yellow-backs, penny bloods, and other popular-priced literature. I refer to the old-line firms, the stalwarts of Paternoster Row, whose conservatism was something of a scandal in their own time, and who looked down their patrician noses at the upstart Cassells, Routledges, Reynoldses, Lloyds, and the rest. They were still firmly committed to the policy which had dominated the trade in the days of Byron. They continued to assume that the only public worth publishing for was the public that bought books at the prevailing prices or subscribed to the circulating libraries. In 1852 Gladstone told Parliament that hardly five percent of the books published in England every year sold more than 500 copies. 38 If his estimate is anywhere near correct, it means that, in the face of an enormously expanded interest in reading, most publishers remained content with selling as many copies of a given title as were normally sold in Pope's day. This means, in turn, that the editorial decisions in the old-established houses were based upon the anticipated reaction of that same small public of well-heeled buyers who had governed decisions in the past. The whole economic rationale of publishing was still what it had been a hundred years before: to make this small initial clientele pay for the cost of publishing a book. There was, of course, this difference: whereas earlier the clientele had been composed of individual purchasers, in Victorian times it was largely represented by the circulating libraries. This circumstance worked to the advantage of the publisher, and to the disadvantage of every man who wanted books for his own shelves. The publisher could, and, it is notorious, did rely upon Mudie and his confrères to take a substantial part of the initial edition of any work intended for the general reader, and the library operators, who in any event got a large discount, were not disposed to quibble about prices. So the publisher could afford to be quite indifferent to the fact that he was pricing his wares out of the reach of the ordinary purchaser. If the book subsequently had a success in a cheap reprint, well and good; that meant so much extra profit for the publisher. But, in contrast to the situation in the middle of the twentieth century, the reprint audience did not figure in the original calculations which attended the editorial decision. The silent guest at the table around which such decisions were made, therefore, was not so much the individual reader (whether a man with a guinea and a half to spend, or only two shillings) but his surrogate, Mr. Mudie. And though Mudie had immense influence on what was published, there is no proof that he was an infallibly shrewd diviner of current taste. He did not have to be; so long as the circulating library was the chief means by which the public got to read newly published books, he had the power, at least as much as did the publishers, to decide what it should be given to read. He may have been wrong quite frequently (his strong views on morality in literature are so well known as to need no comment), but there was little the public could do about it. Under these circumstances, the tastes of the audience influenced editorial decisions only at second hand. Now and again there were protests against this state of affairs—both against the strangle-hold of the libraries and against the whole resulting policy of small original editions at high prices. In 1854, for instance, a writer in the Times urged that "instead of commencing with editions of a guinea, and gradually coming down in the course of years to cheap editions of 5 s. , all good books on their first appearance shall appeal to the needy multitude, while the requirements of the fortunate and lazier few are postponed to a more convenient season." 39 If that reversal of traditional policy had come about, the whole basis of editorial decisions, and therefore eventually the whole nature of contemporary literature, would have been considerably altered. It is fascinating to speculate what would have happened to the reading public, and to literature in general, if the firms which published most of the age's great writers—the Smith Elders, the Chapman and Halls, the Macmillans and Murrays and Longmans—had seriously attempted a policy of cheap original editions. What concessions would they have asked their writers to make in order to appeal to the much larger audience they then would have had? Would Macaulay and Carlyle and Thackeray and the rest have written any differently if they had had in view an immediate audience of hundreds of thousands instead of tens of thousands? 40 As it was, however, the reading of the masses was allowed to be chiefly the concern of the handful of publishers who had discovered that publishing in cheap form and large volume, however lacking in respectability it might be, was not necessarily ruinous. But because in the nature of things they could not pay large prices to authors for original work, they were limited to the productions of hacks, or to copyright works which other publishers were willing to part with, or to translations, or, finally, to American works, which were unprotected by international copyright. It is quite true that the cheap publishers occasionally made available at three-and-six or even at a shilling books of serious content and genuine literary merit, but these were almost lost in the flood of vapid or sensational trash. Under such circumstances, the word "cheap" did not have an exclusively economic reference; it had an aesthetic, and often a moral, one as well. In this way the publishing situation contributed to the division of the total reading public into two worlds, the small one of the intellectual élite, who could pay either the publisher or Mudie for what they wanted, and the infinitely greater one of those who perforce had to want what they could pay for. It would be absurd, of course, to argue that the masses of people read what they did just because it was forced upon them by publishing conditions beyond their control, and because there was nothing better for them to read at a price they could pay. They bought hundreds of thousands of copies of cheap papers every week simply because they liked what they found therein, and most of them, even if the whole rich store of current book publications had been laid before them at sixpence or a shilling a title, would have kept on reading Reynolds' Miscellany and the News of the World to the exclusion of nearly everything else. Nevertheless, it would be unrealistic to assume that in a mass audience of this size, in an era when self-improvement was so much in the air, there were not many people who were ready and eager for reading-matter of a better sort and who suffered from what was in effect a literary disfranchisement. Such people had little opportunity to make their wants known even when they were conscious of them. The self-appointed spokesmen for the common reader were almost wholly unconcerned with the literary improvement of popular reading-matter. This is well illustrated by the whole tone of the testimony before the committee of Commons which was appointed in 1851, as the result of pressure from a few liberal members, to look into the advisability of abolishing the newspaper stamp. Opposition to the proposal was based chiefly upon the historic identification of the cheap press with radicalism. The task of the men who agitated for a removal of the penny newspaper duty was to show that the reading tastes of the masses had improved so far that there was now no danger of a revival of the "scurrilous" and "immoral" publications, such as the Penny Satirist and Cleave's Penny Gazette, which had enjoyed favor a decade or so before. A star witness before the committee was Abel Heywood, the leading wholesale newsagent of Manchester, who analyzed his business in this way: The more respectable of the mass-circulation periodicals had a weekly sale of from 9,000 (for the Family Herald and the London Journal ) down to 600 (for Eliza Cook's Journal and Household Words ). Two principal weekly newspapers, the News of the World and the Weekly Times, sold 3,500 and 4,000 respectively. At the bottom of the scale came the frankly sensational number-publications, the equivalents of today's pulps. G. W. M. Reynolds' Court of London sold 1,500 a week, while the current Lloyd penny dreadfuls— Three-Fingered Jack, The Adventures of Captain Hawk, Mazeppa, Love and Mystery, almost twenty different titles in all—sold in the aggregate 3,400. As a not wholly irrelevant footnote, it must be added that Heywood sold penny numbers of Shakespeare at a rate of 150 a week. 41 Heywood, who spoke with the authority of long experience in his trade and the prejudice of a veteran backer of popular causes, construed his own figures as showing that there had been a remarkable improvement in popular taste, and other witnesses testified to the same effect. The papers whose circulation had most benefited by the growth of the reading habit in recent years were those of a "good tendency"; the immoral and seditious ones had been driven from the market. This was, they maintained, proof of a sort of literary inversion of Gresham's law: good reading-matter, if given half a chance, would inevitably drive out bad. 42 But their definition of "good reading-matter" was determined not by any literary or cultural standards but by existing political and social conditions. When the great concern was whether cheap publications would or would not contribute to a fresh unsettling of the populace, the specifically literary qualities of the Family Herald and the London Journal were of no relevance. The criterion of acceptable popular reading-matter was, to put it bluntly, innocuousness. The ideal of the advocates of a cheap press was simply that the humble reader should be enabled to purchase a few hours of innocent recreation, without being troubled by any thoughts dangerous to his own moral welfare or the peace of the nation. There was no thought of trying to improve the general cultural tone of the people's reading; enough if it were "safe." With attention centered upon the mass reading public from this angle, it was only natural that the need for issuing works of true literary merit in cheap form in order to encourage the elevation of popular taste, and the actual existence of a market for such publications, should have been largely neglected. During the decade with which we are concerned, however, there were several signs which gave promise that the man of some intellectual ambition but little pocket-money, whose tastes were not irrevocably fixed upon the sensational newspaper and the shilling shocker, was slowly making his presence felt. Two significant events occurred in the periodical field. In 1850 Dickens began his twopenny Household Words, which immediately attracted an audience for which the half-crown monthlies were too expensive and the popular weekly papers too frivolous and crude. Both of the two major predecessors of Household Words among the cheap weeklies had failed to satisfy this audience. The Penny Magazine, whose connection with the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge limited its contents to instructional articles and discouraged the introduction of fiction, had gone under in 1845. Chambers's Journal, although it did print fiction, and for that reason still had favor among a certain clientele, was studiously following its original policy of cultivating inoffensiveness to the point of what contemporary observers called "namby-pambyness." Household Words, under Dickens' vigorous direction, escaped both pitfalls: it printed plenty of fiction, and it was not afraid, in its serious articles, to speak out on current issues. Furthermore, its contributors included many highly competent writers. The gratitude with which it was received is measured by its circulation, which ran as high as 40,000 weekly. 43 But that figure, exciting as it was for the time, was eclipsed when George Smith launched the Cornhill Magazine early in 1860, with a staff of contributors that reads today like a Who's Who of Victorian literature. No less than 120,000 men and women bought the first issue, and though the initial circulation did not hold up, during the first two years the Cornhill's average monthly sale, at a shilling, was 84,000 copies. 44 The success of these two innovations in periodical literature, at prices within the reach of at least all middle-class readers, was evidence of a steadily expanding market for serious reading-matter. In the book trade, additional evidence was supplied by the spectacular prosperity of John Cassell's publishing enterprises. Beginning in 1852 with his Popular Educator, a sort of high-school-at-home course, Cassell adapted the old technique of number-publishing to new conditions and brought out in instalments scores of excellent standard works in history, literature, and other fields. It is significant that the man who made the discovery that supplying the people with truly solid books could become a big and lucrative business had no background in publishing at all; he had entered the trade only three or four years earlier, after a career as a temperance lecturer and packer of tea and coffee. Seemingly it took a rank outsider to succeed where old professionals like Charles Knight had failed. 45 Another indication of the growth of serious taste among those who were still neglected by the great publishers is the success of the Bohn Libraries, which provided at prices that were moderate for the early fifties, but still not low enough, hundreds upon hundreds of standard works available otherwise, if at all, in impossibly expensive editions. Other publishers experimented with series of English classics at competing prices. 46 And that there was a similar market lower down in society for standard literature is shown by the prosperity of the 32mo. Cottage Library of Milner and Sowerby, a provincial firm which, in its first years at least, sold its output mainly at country fairs. The Cottage Library books were not handsome, but they offered a great deal of reading-matter for a shilling, and the list, which appealed to every conceivable taste, eventually climbed to over five hundred titles. 47 These were straws in the wind, and eventually they would be heeded by the great publishers who in 1852 held aloof from contact with the mass audience. Cheaper and better books did become available to the additional millions who were made literate by the extension of education during the second half of the century. But by that time the great opportunity had passed. In 1852 the habits and tastes of the new mass audience were not yet crystallized. The people were wretchedly educated, to be sure, and their tastes were crude; but they could still have been taught to like better things. The accidents of publishing, however, as much as any other single factor, caused the new audience to associate the reading habit with a certain type of reading-matter, a type deplored by all contemporary observers and no less by those at a distance of a century. This in turn—increasingly so as the mass audience began to influence editorial decisions—set the permanent course of publishing for the millions, with its implied dismal assumptions regarding the level of popular taste, and so a vicious circle was created, which has never been broken. Perhaps it is too late now to break it. But while we browse in the files of old periodicals and read the Victorians' ceaseless complaints of the unutterable vulgarity of "the million's" reading tastes—complaints so feelingful and comprehensive that our own seem but tired echoes—we may perhaps speculate whether, under happier circumstances, the history of English popular culture might not have taken a different turn. If a few influential publishers had had more vision, more willingness to experiment, more missionary spirit; if somehow the art of sound popularization had been learned while there was still time; if the railway bookstalls and the hole-in-the-wall newsvendors had had Penguins and Pocket Books in stock— But the realities of the Victorian situation were quite another thing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * Revised from a paper read before the English Institute in September, 1952. 1 In a book now nearing completion I am attempting to present a picture of the English mass reading public during the nineteenth century, viewing it primarily as a social phenomenon, its size, composition, and tastes being the resultant of many complex influences in the history of the times. 2 Wilkie Collins, "The Unknown Public," Household Words, XVIII (1858), 217-224. The essay was reprinted in Collins' My Miscellanies (1863), I, 169-191. In the same year, the subject was treated in an article in Blackwood's Magazine (LXXXIV [1858], 200-216), and in the next year, in the British Quarterly Review (XXIX [1859], 313-345). 3 Official returns in Census of Great Britain, 1851: Population Tables, II (Part I) (1854), p.cliv. 4 Registrar-General's returns for England and Wales only; Graham Balfour, The Educational Systems of Great Britain and Ireland (1898), p. 305. A recent article by Robert K. Webb, "Working Class Readers in Early Victorian England," English Historical Review, LXV (1950), 333-351, critically surveys the evidence on the literacy rate among the masses in the thirties and forties. 5 Clarence Gohdes, American Literature in Nineteenth-Century England (1944), pp. 29-31. 6 Charles Tennyson, Alfred Tennyson (New York, 1949), p. 248. Sir Charles's actual phrase, "a few months," must not be interpreted too strictly. There were five editions of the poem between June, 1850 and November, 1851; the first and fifth were of 5,000 copies each, and probably the others were of about the same size or slightly larger (Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., Tennyson and the Reviewers [1952], pp. 146, 156). But even if, as is likely, the figure of 60,000 represents sales over a period of several years rather than months, it is still a remarkable short-term total for a book of poetry. One must remember that the records achieved by other Victorian best-sellers in this class of literature were built up over a generation or more. Robert Pollok's The Course of Time, for example, sold 78,000 between 1827 and 1869 ( Publishers' Circular, January 16, 1869, p. 3); John Keble's The Christian Year sold 379,000 during the whole life of the copyright, 1827-1873 (John Collins Francis, John Francis, Publisher of "The Athenaeum" [1888], II, 193 n.); and the most famous of them all, Martin Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy, passed the 200,000 mark in 1866, twenty-eight years after the first series appeared (Derek Hudson, Martin Tupper: His Rise and Fall [1949], p. 40). 7 Edgar Johnson, Charles Dickens: His Tragedy and Triumph (1952), II, 752, 756, 759. Bleak House, according to Dickens, had a circulation "half as large again as Copperfield, " which sold about 25,000 a number ( ibid., II, 670). 8 Henry Curwen, A History of Booksellers [1873], p. 106. 9 F. A. Mumby, The House of Routledge, 1834-1934 (1934), p. 86. This figure may appear high, but Mumby says elsewhere (p. 77) that Theodore Wood's Common Objects of the Country (1858) sold out an edition of 100,000 in a week. 10 Edinburgh Review, XCVI (1852), 451. 11 Curwen, p. 428. Curwen also says that Mudie took 2,500 of Enoch Arden and 3,000 of Disraeli's Lothair . The latter, however, proved an unfortunate speculation. 12 "The Circulation of Modern Literature," Living Age, LXXVI (1863), 314; a rich source, incidentally, for contemporary sales figures. 13 Ibid. 14 This figure was given by Charles Knight in the preface to the first bound volume of the magazine (1832). He repeats it in his Passages from a Working Life (1864-65), II, 184. However, in 1855, replying to an inquiry addressed to him on behalf of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Knight wrote: "In the first year (1832) it sold about 100,000; in the second, 160,000. The largest sale was in the third and fourth years" (Alice A. Clowes, Charles Knight: a Sketch [1892], pp. 225-226). Since the paper was unstamped, government returns are of no help in establishing the precise facts. It is at least certain that the circulation of 200,000 was not long sustained, and by 1845 it had fallen to 40,000 ( ibid. ). 15 The 1849 figure is from William Lovett's testimony printed in [House of Commons], Select Committee on Public Libraries (1849), Q. 2787. In 1851, a witness before another committee of Parliament gave the Family Herald's circulation as 147,000, while another witness put it at "over 200,000" ([House of Commons], Report from the Select Committee on Newspaper Stamps [1851], Qq. 973, 2498). The figure for 1855, given in the text, is from Charles Knight (Clowes, cited in note 14, p. 226). To confuse matters still further, it may be noted that in the same year, 1855, a speaker in Parliament placed the Family Herald's circulation at 240,000 ( Hansard's Parliamentary Debates, 3rd ser., CXXXVII [1855], col. 783). This is merely one example, out of many which could be cited, of the contradictory evidence facing one who wishes to obtain a fairly accurate picture of the audience for mass-circulation periodicals in the nineteenth century. Since the papers were unstamped for the most part, the government returns are useless, and in any event, the stamp duty was removed in 1855. There was no Victorian equivalent of the Audit Bureau of Circulation, and so a periodical publisher's sales figures could be a matter strictly between himself and God. His public boasts are of little value, for as the Bookseller remarked (April 1, 1869, p. 298), "many of our contemporaries . . . publish particulars respecting their circulation which must somewhat astonish their printers." Lacking the actual account-books of the various publishers, the researcher must be content with such figures as were hazarded at the time, on good authority or bad, and try not to become too exercised over the frequent disagreement among witnesses. 16 Knight's figures again, as of 1855 (Clowes, p. 226). But in the same year, the Chancellor of the Exchequer told Commons that the London Journal sold 510,000 (Hansard, 3rd ser., CXXXVII [1855], col. 783). 17 An estimate as of 1849 ( Select Committee on Public Libraries [1849], Q. 2788). 18 Hansard as cited in note 16, cols. 781-782; H. R. Fox Bourne, English Newspapers (1887), II, 124, 226-227. 19 Collins, p. 218. 20 Select Committee on Public Libraries (1849), Q. 1308. 21 Michael Sadleir, XIX Century Fiction (1951). 22 On this whole subject, see, in addition to Sadleir's bibliography, John Carter and Michael Sadleir, Victorian Fiction (1947), pp. 2-14. 23 The free traders' side was presented by Chapman in an article, "The Commerce of Literature," Westminster Review, new ser., I (1852), 511-554; reprinted as Cheap Books and How to Get Them (1852). See also the Athenaeum, May 22, 1852, pp. 575-577. 24 The publishing trade's indignation over the "underselling" practice may be studied in extenso in the columns of the Publishers' Circular for the whole period. 25 Leone Levi, Wages and Earnings of the Working Classes (1885), p. 48. 26 Ibid., p. 52. 27 G.

Francis E. Mineka, The Dissidence of Dissent (1944), Chapter II, collects evidence of the Evangelicals' distrust of imaginative reading-matter. 35 Charles Knight, in his Popular History of England (n.d.), VIII, 486, decided, after an analysis of the Classified Index to the London Catalogue of Books, 1816-1851, that of 45,510 books listed in that catalogue, 10,300 were "works of divinity"—as against 3,500 works of fiction, 3,400 of drama and poetry, and 2,500 of science. 36 Not even Dickens, despite the statement so often encountered that he appealed to every class, high and low. It is true that there was great demand for cheap imitations and parodies of his earlier work, and unauthorized adaptations from the novels were popular in the cheap theatres; but that is not the same thing as acquaintance with the genuine article. Dickens' was essentially a middle-class audience.—Perhaps this is the place to add a word concerning the innumerable anecdotes one finds in the biographies of most of the celebrated nineteenth-century authors, from Scott on down, telling how a crossing-sweeper or poor mechanic or reformed prostitute plucked the great one's sleeve and offered humble testimony to the edifying effect of his writings. While they are picturesque enough (and some are doubtless true), such stories cannot be regarded as very substantial evidence of a widespread audience for distinguished contemporary writers among the lower classes of the population. 37 Collins, p. 218. 38 Hansard, 3rd ser., CXXI (1852), col. 596. 39 The Times, February 8, 1854; reprinted in Living Age, XLIII (1854), 122. The whole article (pp. 118-122) is a blunt attack on the "unsoundness of the position held by the great publishing houses." 40 In 1852 the "cheap" edition of Dickens, at 3 s. 6 d. to 5 s. a volume, was only getting under way; a title was not included in this series until six to ten years after original publication. Thackeray's Henry Esmond was available only at the standard three-decker price of 31 s. 6 d. , Pendennis was 26 s. , and Vanity Fair, 21 s. Only after a similar lapse of time would these titles be reissued at six or seven shillings. Among the principal works of Carlyle, Heroes and Hero Worship was 9 s. in 1852, Chartism (a short work) 5 s., Latter-Day Pamphlets 9 s., Past and Present 10 s. 6 d. , and Sartor Resartus 10 s. 6 d. Macaulay's Essays was 21 s. 41 Select Committee on Newspaper Stamps (1851), Qq. 2481-2493. 42 Ibid., Q.2508 ff.; cf. Qq. 598-601, 1214-1217, 1325. 43 Johnson, Dickens, II, 946. It may be instructive to compare this figure with that of the Athenaeum, which had "the largest circulation of any literary periodical," appealing to a more intellectual audience and selling at double the price. Although a recent student has estimated the Athenaeum's sale in 1853 at between 18,000 and 24,000 (Leslie A. Marchand, The Athenaeum: A Mirror of Victorian Culture [1941], p. 81), in 1855 Commons was told, on the authority of the periodical's proprietor, that its total press-run, stamped and unstamped, was but 7,200 a week (Hansard, 3rd ser., CXXXVII [1855], col. 781). 44 [Leonard Huxley], The House of Smith Elder (London, privately printed, 1923), pp. 98-100; Publishers' Circular, May 1, 1862, p. 199. 45 One of the almost countless desiderata in this field is a full-length study of the Cassell firm, both before its founder's death (1865) and during the rest of the Victorian era. G. Holden Pike, John Cassell (1894) is brief, uncritical, and reticent. Henry Vizetelly, Glances Back Through Seventy Years (1893), II, 52-53, and Curwen, History of Booksellers, pp. 267-274, provide some contemporary information, mingled, in the case of the former book, with scandal. Newman Flower, Just As It Happened (1950), pp. 50-59, adds a few further notes. 46 The best-known of the cheap series of standard classics during the fifties, other than Bohn's, was Bell's Annotated Series of English Poets, published (1854-1857) in twenty-nine volumes at 2 s. 6 d. Competing series included a reissue of the famous Aldine Poets (1857-1858) at 3 s. 6 d. or 5 s., Griffin's Standard Library (3 s. 6 d. ), and Routledge's British Poets (3 s. 6 d. or 5 s. ). Making allowance for the difference in wage-levels and purchasing power between the 1850's and, say, the early part of the present century, these prices were substantially higher than those of Everyman or the World's Classics. 47 The titles ranged from Ten Nights in a Bar-room and Queechy to Watts's Logic and Dryden's translation of Virgil. Lists can be found in, among other places, the Reference Catalogue of English Literature for 1874. I do not know when the Cottage Library began, but it was flourishing as early as 1856 ( Publishers' Circular, December 1, 1856, pp. 520-521).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The 'Private Issues' of The Deserted Village by William B. Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of the many romances which have been featured in the tabloids of the bibliophiles, perhaps the most enchanting is the tale of the "private" or—as otherwise described—the "trial" issues of Goldsmith's Deserted Village . One, or some, or all of these little duodecimos were especially printed before the first quarto, we are informed, either at the instance of Bishop Percy for presentation to the Countess of Northumberland or, according to the other hypothesis, at the request of a finicky author who wished to obtain several proofs for the purpose of tinkering with the punctuation. For evidence as to the priority of these "issues," reference is usually made to a copy discovered in 1896, which presumes to be, according to a MS inscription on its title-page, "the first privately printed edition before the 4to. of May, 1770." 1 Whether this notation is attributable to an exacting scholar of the last century, or a wishful book collector, or a zealous auctioneer, no one knows. Yet it is generally accepted, and upon this inadmissable hearsay the first elaboration, concerning the gift to the Countess, then follows on the authority of a person who, at the time he offered his conjecture, had never seen a copy, 2 and the second, concerning the necessity for proofs, on the testimony of a critic who later retracted all that he had said. 3 Though these and other considerations have led a few scholars to deny both stories, their protests have not availed against the extravagant claims of Goldsmith's bibliographers or the raucous cries of the booksellers. 4 Nonetheless, as we shall see, the reasoned opinion of the few can be completely vindicated. Even if there were no retractions and no evidence to the contrary, both theories are incredible and readily disproved. Against the first, or "private issue" version is the fact that whereas Percy, in his recollection of an event thirty years in the past, listed the date of original issue as 1769, 5 all of the early "London" editions, duodecimo and quarto, are dated 1770. Moreover, as the various title pages attest, all were printed, not for the Bishop, nor the Countess, nor the author, but purportedly "for W. Griffin," a publisher who had no connection with any of Percy's enterprises, public or private. Against the second, or "trial issue" version is the certainty that, whatever the order of editions, none of the alterations are substantial, none would concern the author, and none would necessitate such an extraordinary procedure as that involved in the composition of a series of proofs, each in a different setting of type, many in a considerable quantity, and all in a format unlike that of the published edition. If either of these false suppositions is accepted on the basis of what has been adduced, the way is open for the admission of any and all comers. Thus two undated editions "Printed for the Booksellers in Town and Country" can also be awarded precedence over the first quarto on the warrant of testimony quite similar to that previously mentioned, viz. (1) an inscription in a copy now at the University of Chicago reading "May 6. 1770"—twenty days before the publication of the quarto—and (2) in apparent confirmation, a note in a bookseller's catalogue that copies with this imprint represent "the excessively rare pirated edition made instantly on the success of the first [ i.e. , "private"] issue of the poem." 6 Here, as for the duodecimos, the ascription would seem to be indisputable. But again, as before, the witnesses are unreliable and easily refuted, in this instance, by a contemporary reference to the issuance of one of the "Booksellers" editions actually in 1784, fourteen years after the date alleged. 7 With this date established, notwithstanding several "authorities," the priority of all editions in duodecimo format can be impugned; for all have the shoddy appearance of the many chapbooks produced at the time, all are closely related to the "Booksellers" variants, all include textual matter in the initial gathering (the usual sign of a later reprinting), and all were issued—as I shall endeavor to show—under circumstances quite different from those generally assigned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. The Number and Order of Editions Besides the four "1770" editions posing as "private" or "trial issues," we may now identify at least twenty-two other separate editions of the poem. 8 All twenty-six were apparently printed within the copyright period (ranging, in this instance, from 1770 to 1784) or immediately upon its expiration; but only eleven represent an authoritative sequence repeatedly revised in the earlier editions and regularly published, first by William Griffin, then by his authorized successors, Rivington, Carnan, and Cadell. These legitimate editions will be designated hereafter by their size, either as Q (editions 1-10) or 8vo (edition 11). The other fifteen, representing with one exception unrevised texts deriving ultimately from Q1 and issued without authorization under various imprints, real and assumed, are identified by the letters assigned below. (A complete description of these is given in Section III.) Page 9 , Ed. Date Publisher Title-page points line I Scott A 1770 'W.

Richter Apart from the separate editions, legitimate and illegitimate, the textual collation offered in Section II implicates five or six collected editions. These are intermediate texts, transmitting readings from one separate printing to another, and therefore constitute a third group here distinguished by the dates on their title pages. 9 Date Publisher Title 1 1775 ?(Belfast) Poems by the Late Dr. Oliver Goldsmith 2 1775 'W. Griffin' Miscellaneous Works 1778 " " " 1782 W. Osborne and T. Griffin " " [1783] edition not extant 1784 W. Osborne and T. Griffin " " Altogether, then, we are concerned with thirty-two editions, differentiated by size, letter, or date, and now demonstrated to have a certain interrelation indicated by the following stemma: This graphic account should effectively dispose of the various figments of the legend, including the assumption that each succeeding imprint was an improvement over the one before, the inference that C was therefore the first of a series advancing through B and A toward Q1, and the wild surmise that C, as the original "private issue," was presented to the Countess of Northumberland late in 1769. On the contrary, it is now apparent that, as always with reprints, each is a further corruption of the one before, that each moves not up toward Q1 but down toward E, an edition honestly dated 1777, and—if some personality is required to displace the Countess—that it is James Boswell Esq. who is found with a copy of C, not in the winter of 1769 but in the spring of 1783. To verify this fact all the mythologists need do is to turn from the Goldsmith bibliographies to the adjoining section on Samuel Johnson and there, in the second volume of the R. B. Adam Library, examine a facsimile of a page from this edition with Boswell's comment and date. 9a Here, as opposed to an anonymous note discovered over a hundred years after the event, is reliable testimony of the time by a person known for his attention to details. Thus reassured, we may now consider the evident realities. From A to J in one sequence, from K to O in others, and doubtless for still others which have thus far escaped identification, 10 all of the separate editions represent a series of degraded texts cheaply produced at various times and places with the obvious intention of cutting in on the profits due the author and his publisher. To protect their interests, the owners of the poem relied upon their copyright; but as this was severely limited, extending in time only fourteen years from the original date of publication and in place only to England and Scotland, it hardly served to deter the more enterprising printers of the day. Anyone with a business in Ireland or on the continent, two areas beyond the reach of the law, might therefore openly identify himself in the imprint of his issue or, if he had a reputation to maintain, allow the issue to circulate anonymously. Hence all we need to know of such editions as L, M, and O is candidly admitted on the title page, and all we might want to know of the anonymous N is soon disclosed by the imprint of its copytext and its own watermark, both of which read BELFAST. With other early editions, however, the attempt at concealment is far more successful, for more than reputation is involved. Quite naturally, to avoid the penalty of the law, various subterfuges were employed, all of which must now come under examination. One distinctive feature common to many of these editions is the fictitious "Printed for W. Griffin," an imprint used to such good effect, apparently, that the publisher was never able to discover who had appropriated his name and, with it, much of his income. Yet as Griffin might have declared, and as we now perceive, none of these editions bears any resemblance to the various works which he had printed and published. Contrary to the practice in his shop, all appear without press figures, habitually use founts other than Caslon, elide the final 'e' in past participles, hyphenate compounds, modernize the spelling, ignore the revisions which appear in his later quartos, arbitrarily shift one paragraph division and create another. 11 Moreover, among the earlier editions, A—D are in 12° half-sheets, an unusual imposition for any London publication of this time; A—E persistently convert "woe" to "wo," a variant spelling not used by Griffin's compositors; 12 D—E separate the date in the imprint with commas, a practice common to provincial issues but not observed in Griffin's books; and E alone ingenuously uses the date 1777, two years after Griffin's death. 13 Of itself, this latter circumstance suggests that some of these editions were far removed from the scene described in their imprints. To all this must be added still another peculiarity. Though the five duodecimos are much alike, superficially, and so designed to pass under a common disguise, each is slightly different in size, type, and ornamentation. It is quite probable, therefore, that these are not only far removed from Griffin's shop, but removed in five different directions. Aside from the duodecimos one other separate edition is known with Griffin's address. This is F, a 1775 octavo in half-sheets, with a title page reading "By Oliver Goldsmith, M.B." and imprinted "Catherine-Street, in the Strand." Both in the use of the author's medical degree and in the spelling of "Catharine" with an 'e', this issue differs from all "Griffin" books except the Miscellaneous Works and the Select Poems, two collections of similar imposition and date. As may be demonstrated for F, and safely assumed for the Poems , 14 both owe these similarities to the fact that they are separate reimpressions or "offprints" from the collected Works . All three, then, betray some of the idiosyncrasies derived from copytext A, share among themselves a peculiar ascription and imprint not used by Griffin, and suspiciously appear as a group in the very year of Griffin's death. But again, as with the separate edition E, a deception once engaged in is practiced too often: In 1778, long after Griffin had ceased to care about the raids on his literary property, another edition of the Works was produced with his name in the imprint. So far, our survey of the 'Griffin' imprints A—F allows several conclusions: (1) that all six are textually related, (2) that some are deliberate imitations, one of another, (3) that each, nonetheless, is sufficiently distinct to suggest its origin in a different shop, and (4) that none, despite the pretensions of all, is an issue from "Garrick's Head, in Catharine-street, Strand." Furthermore, by exhibiting characteristics uncommon to London publications of the time and repeating information which had long since become invalid, it would seem that certain of these editions appeared at some distance from the Strand. Precisely where or when, however, are questions which, with the exception of one edition, may never be determined. The evidence for the one edition, the critical one in the sequence, comes providentially from the reviews. According to their usual practice, the London journals cite immediately from the original quarto edition. 15 Many of those issued in provincial towns, on the other hand, reproduce any available text, usually that offered in some other magazine. Thus in its account of the "Deserted Village" the Newcastle Literary Register quotes first from the Critical Review, then from the Monthly Review . 16 Another provincial journal, the Weekly Magazine, or Edinburgh Amusement, also offers mixed citations; and in this mixture we find the clue we seek. Three weeks after the publication of the quarto the Magazine, in two successive issues dated June 14 and 21, reprints the first 194 lines. Then, after another delay of four weeks, the citation continues, in the July 19 issue, through line 252. Apparently, as collation indicates, the earlier printing was derived from the 194 lines quoted in the London Chronicle of May 26-29, the later, from another text which had become available in the meantime. That text, undoubtedly, is the one described as A. The implications of this discovery are obvious. If Walter Ruddiman, the printer and publisher of the Edinburgh Magazine, is not the principal agent in the manufacture of the first of these piracies, as we must now call them all, he is certainly an accessory after the fact. Though slight and scattered, the evidence is nevertheless incriminating. Here, in this man's shop, seven weeks after the issuance of the quarto and 395 miles distant from London, we find a copy of the duodecimo printing. Here too we encounter a person already in contempt of the laws relating to the stamp tax 17 and therefore quite ready, we may suppose, to evade any others pertaining to copyright. And here again we observe, in abundance, the several features which distinguish many of these editions from Griffin's publications, notably the elided 'e' in participles, the interspersed commas in imprint dates, and the occasional production of books in duodecimo half-sheets. 18 Even more damning is the fact that the title page of the A reprint and Ruddiman's work is composed of the peculiar bold face letter manufactured by John Baine, a type-founder then residing in Edinburgh. 19 Before us, then, is a disreputable printer of known habits, using material similar to that found in the book, and discovered with a copy in his possession. Unless he can escape by placing the blame on some close neighbor, Walter Ruddiman of Forester's Wynd, Lawn-market, Edinburgh, should therefore be charged with pirating a copy of the "Deserted Village" on or about July 15, 1770. Once the A reprint appeared it served, not only as the copytext for Ruddiman's Magazine , but also for many of the other piracies now identified. By a kind of Gresham's law, these inferior texts, selling perhaps at sixpence a copy, and multiplying in various little shops around the countryside, must have had an enormous sale among those who could not afford two shillings for the authorized editions. The opportunity for a quick return undoubtedly attracted many unscrupulous vendors, among whom might be named Francis Robertson of Edinburgh, a notorious expert in duplications of the kind represented by B, C, and D, and Alexander Donaldson, of Edinburgh and London, a specialist in cheap reprints of work not specifically covered by copyright. 20 Donaldson's role in these depredations is perhaps not beyond conjecture. By a strange turn of events which could hardly have gone unnoticed by this publisher and others of his ilk, much of Goldsmith's property lay for awhile, if not in the public domain, at least near enough so that it could be snatched at very little risk. In 1773 the Court of Session, upon Donaldson's appeal, rendered its historic verdict against the common law interpretation of copyright; in 1774, the year of Goldsmith's death, the House of Lords sustained the ruling; and in 1775 fate again intervened to remove the publisher. All rights held by Griffin were therefore suspended from 1775 until such time as they were reinstated by his successors; and for the "Deserted Village" this was not until 1779, the date of the ninth Quarto. Yet, as suspension did not amount to revocation, it was still convenient to hide behind the name of the original publisher. Under Griffin's imprint, then, the work continued, possibly by Donaldson for the 1775 issues, separate (F) and collected, probably by a more distant and less well informed printer for those dated 1777 (E) and 1778. Thereafter, when it was finally realized that Griffin had died long before, and that his copyright was now enforced by others, the long-practiced scheme of falsification was abandoned in favor of simple anonymity. This took two forms, either as issue completely without imprint (G), or as issue "Printed for the Booksellers in Town and Country" (H, I). Of G all that may be surmised is that it derives, probably as an offprint, from an unknown collected edition intervening between others dated 1782 and 1784. 21 The known edition of 1782 is a 12° in half-sheets in which the text of the "Village" extends from R6 r to S4 r ; the one of 1784 a full 12° with text from 12 r to I10 r ; the separate printing G, of a setting different from both, but of format like the earlier, and with a vestigial signature 'S3' which points to some collection based upon the earlier text. For the other two surreptitious editions, H and I, the evidence is external and more outspoken. Apparently these were issued just before the copyright expired, when it was still inexpedient for the "Booksellers" to reveal themselves; and again with these, as with A—D, we witness the effort of one pirate to duplicate the work of another. That effort did not go unnoticed by the authorized publishers, who inserted in the 11th edition of 1784, the year which terminated their copyright, a notice designed to maintain their privilege. There being a pirated Edition of the Deserted Village, which is mentioned in the Title to be "Printed for the Bookſellers in Town and Country," it is thought neceſſary toprevent the Public from being impoſed on, to inform them, that the ſpurious Edition is extremely incorrect, and contains upwards of ſeventy Errors, which are pointed out, and may be ſeen at T. Carnan's, in St. Paul's Church-yard . The genuine and correct Editions of the Deserted Village are printed for J. F. and C. Rivington, T. Carnan, in St. Paul's Church-yard; and T. Cadell, in the Strand; and are decorated with a Copper-plate Cut in the Title-page. 22 The cut for the 11th edition is not that of "The sad historian of the pensive plain," a vignette much too large for an octavo, but a bust of the author prepared originally for the first edition of Retaliation printed for George Kearsly, and still inscribed "Published as the Act directs 18 th April 1774," though now employed for an occasion some ten years later. By 1784 evidently, if not long before, the provincial issues were encroaching upon the London market; and by then it was too late to stop them, for with the end of restrictions any publisher could safely venture into the open. Among the first to do so, it would seem, was James Barker, a former apprentice of Griffin's, and now a prolific purveyor of chapbooks. Like Carnan, Barker felt called upon, but for much less reason, to advance the merits of his own printing against the others then on sale, and accordingly warned the readers of his issue: " N.B. The Public are respectfully desired to be careful not to have an inferior Edition imposed on them, instead of that printed by J. Barker." The only thing that distinguishes this issue (J) is its appearance, which is superior to that of all preceding reprints. Barker even outdid his legitimate competitors by having the original quarto vignette reversed, reduced, and re-engraved to fit the size of his version. Unfortunately, however, he did not consult the quarto for his readings, but was content to print from one of the latest and least reliable (D) of the provincial editions. Another who crept into public view about this time was T. Martin, a tradesman who describes his proper occupation as a "Letter-Case Maker" and his place of business at "No. 11, Club Row, Bethnal Green." Of this let me say, for the benefit of those who may henceforth label it as a "private issue," that it is the only London edition immediately related to the first quarto, one containing an appreciable number of "early readings" definitely "improved" in the quarto, appearing in smaller size but of the same format as the quarto, quite exempt from any incriminating dates or reviews, and known only by a single copy. Thus, ironically enough, where the earlier reprints fail to meet a single qualification of the many which might be advanced for a "private issue," the latest scores on every count. Yet this too is beneath contempt. With this last printing we have traced the fragmentary history of fifteen separate editions of the "Deserted Village," each remarkably debased in appearance, association, and text. All are mongrels, occasionally sporting some fancy gilt and Zaehnsdorfian trappings, but essentially without pedigree, without claim to any distinction other than that accorded the common run of six-penny pamphlets often found in the bookstalls. What they were then is, all nonsense aside, what they are now.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">III. Check-List of Separate Unauthorized Editions of the "Deserted Village" with Notes on Other Piracies Though I have diligently pursued in numerous footnotes the many ramifications of this extraordinary problem, some questions still remain for consideration under this heading. For one, as Goldsmith's bibliographers have not only confused the ordering of the early "Village" reprints but occasionally provided facsimiles at variance with their descriptions, it will be necessary to preface my own list with a table converting previous notations to the established sequence. For another, while these earlier accounts do give, after their fashion, much attention to the "Village" printings, not one mentions a contemporary series of "Traveller" editions. These occur too frequently to be ignored here, but thus far not so frequently that someone elsewhere could make something of them . To prevent such an attempt, and whatever notions might come of it, I shall therefore deal with them summarily under the description of the "Village" editions with which they are associated. Separate editions A Printed in Edinburgh before July 19, possibly by Ruddiman. The Deserted Village, A Poem. By Dr. Goldsmith. [ornament] [Oxford rule] London: Printed for W. Griffin, at Garrick's Head, in Catharine-street, Strand. [short rule] M DCC LXX. 12° in sixes. A-B 6 . English type (10 lines: 46 mm.) Copytext: Q1. Size of copy (cut) 17.9 x 11.2 cm. Notes: Lines 195-252 of this edition were reprinted in the Weekly Magazine, or Edinburgh Amusement, July 19, 1770. Occasionally appearing with these earlier reprints is a "Fifth Edition" of the Traveller, a copy apparently taken from Newbery's legitimate fifth quarto edition of 1768, but now masquerading as a 12° 'Griffin' edition of 1770. Since of all the Village editions it most closely resembles A, and is bound with A in Lord Rothschild's volume, both probably have a common origin. For another combination, however, see note under C. Copies: NN (Berg), CSmH (film copy), Lord Rothschild. Other provincial editions B Printed between 1770-1777. The Deserted Village [&amp;c. as for A except] Dr Goldsmith. . . . M DCC LXX. Collation as for A. Pica type (10 lines: 42 mm.) Copytext: A. Size of copy (uncut) 17.8 x 11.4 cm. Copies: NN (Berg), BM (Ashley 798). C Possibly printed as late as 1777, at which time it served as copy for E. The Deserted Village [&amp;c. as for A except] Dr Goldsmith. [ornament] [double rule] . . . M DCC LXX. Collation as for A. Pica type (10 lines: 41 mm.) Copytext: B. Size of copy (uncut) 18.7 x 11.4 cm. Notes: Scott erroneously cites ornaments on half-title and page [5] as identical: the one line consists of diamonds, with a star at each end; the other of leaves. This, the edition most often described as the "rare private issue", is the common public reprint which, in the spring of 1783, Boswell gave to Johnson for a notation of the lines he had supplied. Again in this spring, perhaps at the same time, Johnson was asked to annotate a 12° "Fifth Edition" of the Traveller which also was dated '1770' and imprinted for 'W. Griffin'. The title and page 24 of this inscribed copy, as well as page 24 of the Village copy, are reproduced in the R. B. Adam Library relating to Dr. Johnson (1929), II, facsimiles preceding p. 19. Another copy of the Traveller, cited in the note to A, is in Lord Rothschild's library. Copies: NN (Berg), NNP (2 copies), MH, CLU-C (film copy), Lord Rothschild (2 copies). D Possibly printed as late as 1784, at which time it served as copy for J. The Deserted Village, A Poem. By Dr Goldsmith. [French rule] London: Printed for W. Griffin, at Garrick's Head, in Catharine Street, Strand. [short rule] M,DCC,LXX. Collation as for A. Small pica type (10 lines: 39 mm.) Copytext: C. Size of copy (cut) 17.5 x 10.0 cm. Note: Only A3 and B3 registered. Copies: BM (Ashley 799), CSmH (film copy). E The Deserted Village, A Poem. By Dr Goldsmith. [ornament] [ornamental rule] London: Printed for W. Griffin, at Garrick's-Head, in Catharine-Street, Strand. [short ornamental rule] M,DCC,LXXVII. 12°. A 12 . Copytext: C. Only A3 registered. Copy: Professor Ronald S. Crane. Verso of the title page bears inscription "Chris r . Moresby | Workington 1781". This topical annotation further attests the provincial origin of these earlier editions. The town of Workington, in the county of Cumberland, adjoining Scotland, is about 95 miles from Edinburgh, 312 miles from London. F The Deserted Village: A Poem. [ornamental rule] By Oliver Goldsmith, M.B. [ornamental rule] The Fourth Edition. [ornamental rule] London: Printed for W. Griffin, at Garrick's Head, Catherine-Street, in the Strand. [short Oxford rule] M DCC LXXV. 8° in fours. A-B 4 . Copytext: A. Notes: A reimpression of section X3 r -Z3 v in The Miscellaneous Works of Oliver Goldsmith, M.B. (1775). Alterations: new title, signatures, and pagination to conform to present imposition, different type preceding and following text of dedication, new rules above text of poem, reset type for the second paragraph (lines 35-50)— necessitated, apparently, by some pie in the transfer—and, below the last line of text, the substitution of "The End" for the catchword "Edwin". As this and, presumably, the Select Poems are both offprints of the Works, it is not unlikely that other sections of the book were similarly treated and may hereafter appear, with the same imprint and date, under the titles The Traveller and Select Essays . Possibly these, like the Village impression, may also occur as various "editions". Copy: Professor Ronald S. Crane. The last page of this copy has been hand-stamped "James Robison's", with the apostrophe inverted, as indicated. G [1783] [fly-title] The Deserted Village. 12° in sixes. A-B 6 . Copytext: Miscellaneous Works (1782). Notes: Page A6 v carries the signature 'S3'. Possibly this issue is an offprint of an unknown edition of the Miscellaneous Works, ca. 1783. Copy: MH. Editions deriving from provincial issues, but printed in London. H [1783] The Deserted Village. A Poem. By Dr. Goldsmith. [ornament] [French rule] London: Printed for the Booksellers in Town and Country. 8° in fours. A 4 B-C 4 . Copytext: C. Notes: C2 unsigned; with catchwords. Bound with the Bodley copy is an edition, fully titled "The Traveller: Or a Prospect of Society", also retaining catchwords, and imprinted as in H. Copy: Bodl. (G. Pamph. 1267) Vertical chainlines in all gatherings; lacks fold A2:3. I [1784] The Deserted Village. [&amp;c. as in H except] [ornamental rule] London: Printed for the Booksellers, in Town and Country. Collation as for H. Copytext: H Notes: C2 signed; without catchwords. This, apparently, is the reprint mentioned in the authorized 11th edition of 1784. Bound with the BM copy is another edition, with abbreviated title "The Traveller", also without catchwords, and imprinted as in I. Copies: BM (10602.e.4.[2]). Horizontal chainlines in all gatherings; page 16, last line: "white-wash'd". ICU. Horizontal lines in A and C, vertical in B; page 16, last line: "w hit e-wash'd". Below the imprint of this copy is inscribed "1770" and on page [6], in a different hand, "May 6. 1770". J [1784] [engraved title-page] The Deserted Village, A Poem By Dr. Goldsmith. [reversed and reduced copy of Q vignette, signed "Mutlow &amp; Woodman, sculpt"] London: Printed for J. Barker, Russell Court, Drury Lane. 8° in fours. A 4 B-D 4 . Copytext: D. Notes: Issued, it would seem, shortly after the copyright expired in 1784; containing a notice vaguely alluding to H-I and other reprints then on the market; and bearing a Britannia watermark (H218) which Heawood found in a parish document dated 1790. Copies: MH, ICU, BM (11633.aa.21). Editions copied directly from Q1, but issued in various places. K [1784] The Deserted Village. A Poem. [rule] [ornament] [double rule] London: Printed for T. Martin, Letter-Case Maker, No. 11, Club Row, Bethnal Green. 4°. i 1(=B1) A 4 B 4 (—B1). Signed leaves: A1, A2, A4, B2. Note: As indicated in collation, the first gathering appears to be inserted between the first two leaves of the second. Copy: MH. L The Deserted Village, A Poem. By Dr. Goldsmith. [ornamental rule] Dublin: Printed for J. Exshaw, H. Saunders, B. Grierson, J. Potts, W. Sleator, D. Chamberlaine, J. Hoey, jun. J. Williams, C. Ingham, J. Porter, and R. Moncrieffe. [short rule] MDCCLXX. 8° in fours. A 4 B-E 4 . Copy: CSmH (film). M The Deserted Village, A Poem. By Dr. Goldsmith. The Second Edition. Dublin: Printed for H. Saunders [&amp;c. as in L] . . .

[ornament] [short rule] M,DCC,LXXV. 8°. A 8 . Notes: The watermark in this copy, not represented in Heawood, consists of a circular band around a lyre, below which appears the designation BELFAST. Very probably the edition derives from a collection I have been unable to trace, but which is cited in CBEL (II. 637) as Poems by the late Dr. Oliver Goldsmith, Belfast, 1775. If the Poems contains all the errors given in the textual collation, then N is undoubtedly an offprint; if only certain of these, then N is of another setting. Copy: In the writer's possession, the generous gift of Mr. Philip Gaskell. Reprint based on Q4 or later edition O The Deserted Village, A Poem By Dr. Goldsmith. [reversed and reduced Q vignette, signed "Taylor del Liebe sc Lips."] [Oxford rule] Altenburgh. Printed for Gottlob Emanuel Richter, and committed to A. F. Boeme Bookseller in Leipzig. MDCCLXXIII. Notes: In the only volume I have seen, this is one of several poems, each with its own title, and bound together under the general title "Four Poems". Collation for the book: 8°. A1 : General title A 8 (-A1) B 8 C 4 : Armine and Elvira D 4 E-G 8 H 6 : The Hermit of Warkworth I 2 K 8 L 6 : The Deserted Village M 2 N-O 8 : The Traveller As each of these was obviously prepared for separate distribution, I represent the Village section as, potentially, of a distinct issue. Copy: BM (11603.d.27). Addendum: Of all the known variants of this poem only one can be properly defined as a "private issue." This is the quarto copy reported in The Library of William Andrews Clark Jr. ("Modern English Literature," III, 33-34), and there described as having a first edition title-page without vignette and a third edition text. Actually, as the press figures reveal, the text is of the fifth edition. Preceding this is a conjugate double-leaf of slightly heavier paper than usual, bearing the watermark of a crest above the initials LVG (Heawood 1743?), with half-title on i 1, and on i 2 a title in which the area normally occupied by vignette and edition reference contains an MS. reading "For Miss Polly Safe 1770, W.A." My thanks to Mr. H. Richard Archer, bibliographer of the Clark Library, for information regarding this copy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 F[rancis] G[rant], note in Athenaeum , June 20, 1896, p. 810. Notes on other editions appear in the same journal, August 8 and 15, pp. 193-194, 227. 2 J. W. M. Gibbs, ibid. , June 27, 1896, p. 844. 3 It should be observed that Luther S. Livingston's assertions, as first presented in Athenaeum (April 21, 1900, pp. 499-500) and later amplified in The Bookman (N.Y., XII [1901], 563-567), were eventually withdrawn in an anonymous communication to The Nation (August 18, 1910, p. 141)—this as the consequence of Colonel W. F. Prideaux's examination (in N &amp; Q, 11th ser., II [July 16, 1910], 41-42) of the textual relation between one of the "private issues" and the obvious reprint described as J in this study. 4 To illustrate the divergent opinion of recent years and the effect of certain statements on the rare-book market, I subtend a few quotations. First, the views of those who reject the legend: (1) Editions A, B, C "have been supposed, but without any good reason, to have appeared before the first quarto." R. S. Crane, CBEL (1940), II, 643. (2) Of edition D, "there is no evidence that it precedes the quarto and, in fact, reprints, if different in size at all, are likely and normally smaller than the original issue." W. A. Jackson, comment on item 452, Parke-Bernet Galleries Sale 1292 (Dec. 3-4, 1951). See also the present writer in Studies in Bibliography, IV (1951), 44, 48. Second, the views of those who accept the legend: (1) On edition B and later, in the same words, on D, "the first edition, privately printed." T. J. Wise, Ashley Library, II (1922), 150; VIII (1926), 140-41. (2) Apparently in reference to Wise's copy of B, "a very rare little book, privately printed." I. A. Williams, Seven XVIIIth Century Bibliographies (1924), pp. 146-147. (3) Concerning editions ranged in the order C, B, A, "the fact that there were three issues of this so-called 'privately printed' edition, somewhat weakens one's faith in a privately printed issue . . . though I can understand why [Griffin] should venture on small 'trial editions'." Temple Scott, Oliver Goldsmith Bibliographically and Biographically Considered (1928), p. 246. (4) In an account of Lord Rothschild's copy of edition C: "first edition, first issue . . . very rare, privately printed 'trial issue' of the poem." John Hayward, English Poetry, An Illustrated Catalogue (1950), item 184. It is my understanding that this description is to be corrected in the forthcoming catalogue of the Rothschild Library. Third, in consequence of these sensational pronouncements, a record of extraordinary prices realized on the market: Maggs, July 15, 1929: £640 ($3110 at the exchange rate then prevailing). Gabriel Wells, June 16, 1930: £450 ($2190). Anderson Galleries, Jerome Kern sale, Jan. 7-10, 1929: $3900 and $1200; the Roderick Terry sale, May 2-3, 1934: $1300; the Courtland Bishop sale, April 5-8, 1938: $2100. 5 Actually the reference did not originate with Percy in 1801, as commonly supposed, but in the 1777 Dublin Poems and Plays, the ultimate copytext for a series of editions extending into the 19th century. In the 1777 edition (and usually in the many reprints) the poem is mistakenly advertised on its flyleaf as "First printed in M,DCC,LXIX"; and the entire book (together with some of the reprints) claims to present "several Additions and Corrections never before printed; being the only perfect one ever published of this celebrated Author's Poems." Neither assertion is acceptable. Against the first is the specific notice in the Daily Advertiser for Saturday, May 26, 1770, that the Deserted Village was to be published "This Day at Twelve." Against the second is an evident indication that, for this one poem, the "Additions and Corrections" comprise various readings chosen at random from the earlier separate printings. Thus at lines 67, 101, 111, 184, and 315 the 1777 edition follows readings which appear only in Q1, at 108 a revision first introduced in Q2, and at 81-82 and 125 revisions first introduced in Q4. (For citation of revisions, see Section II.) This conglomerate text is followed in the 1780 London edition similarly titled, in the one volume Poetical Works (n.d.), in the Perth edition of the Miscellaneous Works (1792, vol. II), Bishop Percy's "new edition" of this (1801, vol. II), and in various anthologies such as Chalmers' English Poets (1810, vol. XVI) and the Chiswick Press British Poets (1822, vol. LXIV). 6 James Tregaskis' note, as cited by Livingston in The Nation , August 18, 1910, p. 141. 7 See later comment on edition I. 8 Beyond the scope of this inquiry, but possibly of some concern to an editor of Goldsmith, is a later octavo edition in half-sheets, passing as the "Fourteenth," and imprinted "for G. Lister, No. 46, Old Bailey, and sold by all Book-sellers, New's-carriers, &amp;c. in Great Britain and Ireland. M,DCC,-LXXXVI." Like the collected editions cited in fn. 5, this has a conglomerate text, but of quite a different kind. At 81-82, 101, 111 it corresponds to Q1; at 67, 108, 184, 315 to Q2; and at 125 and 147 to Q4. 9 Of the unrevised Miscellaneous Works —a group not to be confused with others similarly titled (cf. fn. 5)—I have not seen the two editions reported by Professor Crane (in CBEL, II, 636-37) as imprinted London 1780 and Edinburgh 1791, but presume that these reproduce the text carried through 1778. At line 248 in that edition, the earlier reading "lean to hear" is corrupted to "learn to hear". This alteration reappears in the separate edition G, in the later Works of 1782 and 1784, and in two editions of Poems, By Dr. Goldsmith published by J. Wenman in 1784 and 1786. 9a See below, section III, note under edition C. 10 That there were others now lost may be inferred from the fact that, whereas the "rare private issues" (A—D) are fairly common, only one copy is known of the six editions E—H, K, and N. Moreover, between some of these editions there are considerable intervals, ranging from two to fourteen years (C to E or D to J), which may have been filled by other texts. Even for related editions issued in the same year, such as 1775 and F, the designation of the latter as the "Fourth" presupposes others with earlier edition references. It would seem, then, that the editions I have found represent only a few of the many in existence at the time. 11 The figures normally used by Griffin's pressmen are 1, 2, and 3. Elisions, occurring frequently throughout the "Village," cumulate with each successive reprint. For typical examples of the other alterations, generally evident in all reprints, observe the hyphenation at 11, 44, 144 (never-failing, hollow-sounding, a-year) and the modern spelling at 46, 93, 128 (echoes for ecchoes, group for groupe, cheerful for chearful). Notes on quarto text and paragraph divisions will be found in Section II. 12 One edition of Goldsmith's Essays, supposedly printed by Griffin, also appears in 12° half-sheets; but this too, as Professor Friedman has demonstrated ( Studies in Bibliography, V [1952], 190-193), is doubtless a piracy. The reading "wo" occurs at lines 162, 316, 346, 374, 394, and 415. It so reads in all the earlier 12° reprints (A—E), reverts to "woe" in the succeeding 8° editions (F, H—J), and reverts again to "wo" except at line 374 in the derivative 12° G. 13 It is not surprising that the year of Griffin's death should be unknown both to the trade in that day and to scholars of our time (cf. Morison and Plomer), for it is unmarked by any obituary even in the newspapers of which he was the proprietor. It may be noted, though, that his will, proved on June 27, 1775, leaves his estate to his wife Elizabeth (the 'E. Griffin' cited below); and from the imprints of the two papers he conducted it may be assumed that he died about June 14. As there is some little variation in the earlier form of these imprints, the significance of which is not readily apparent, I reproduce all versions for both papers through the year 1775. Morning Post Jan. 2—Mar. 4. Printed for and Sold by William Griffin, No. 6, in Catharine-street, Strand. . . . Mar. 6—Apr. 7. Printed and Sold by &amp;c. Apr. 8—June 13. Printed by &amp;c. June 14—17. Printed at No. 6, &amp;c. June 19—Aug. 26. Printed by E. Griffin, at No. 6, &amp;c. Aug. 28—Dec. 30. Printed by R. Haswell, Catharine-street, Strand. . . . Middlesex Journal Jan. 3/5—June 13/15. Printed by W. Griffin, Bookseller, No. 6, Catharine-Street in the Strand. June 15/17—Aug. 3/5. Printed by E. Griffin, at No. 6 &amp;c. Aug. 5/8—Aug. 24/26. Printed by R. Ayre and G. Moore, at No. 6, &amp;c. Aug. 26/29—Dec. 28/30. Printed by R. Ayre and G. Moore, (from the late Mr. Griffin's) at No. 5, Bridges-Street, opposite Drury-Lane Theatre. From this account it would appear that Ayre and Moore occupied the premises and ran both papers (but only one avowedly) until Saturday, August 26, when they removed the office of the Journal to their new location, and were replaced at No. 6 by Haswell, who then began to print the Post . 14 Of this a unique copy was once in the possession of I. A. Williams, and described by him in the London Mercury, VI (1922), 633, and in Seven XVIIIth Century Bibliographies (1924), pp. 167-68. From the data offered there it may readily be assumed that, as the four selections (including Retaliation [6 pages], Edwin and Angelina [6], the Double Transformation [3⅔], and A New Simile [2⅓]) occupy exactly the same amount of space and occur in exactly the same grouping as in the final gathering of the Works, all four poems, like the separate "Village" (F), constitute a reimpression. Further, both in the Select Poems and in the separate poem, the dividing rules in the Works have been replaced by ornamental lines. In the Poems group, however, "Retaliation," appearing in the Works as the last of the series of four, was moved to the first position. Thus the pirate, alias "Griffin", ignorantly juggled a poem which actually belonged to Kearsly, while excluding from this selection the one poem owned by the man whose imprint he had assumed. Even if we condone the infraction of copyright, the multiplicity of impressions at this late date, and the peculiar styling of their title-pages, we may not ignore the advertisements for this year, all of which indicate that the collection the real Griffin had in press was entirely different from the one offered in these unannounced Works . As noted in the issues of his own Morning Post for April 18-21, this was to consist, not of material often printed in earlier years, but of "Poems written by the late Dr. Goldsmith, David Garrick, Esq. And the Dean of Derry. Never before published." [Advts. in Griffin's Middlesex Journal for April 18-27 read "Others" for "the Dean of Derry."] Very probably the Goldsmith items were among the papers which Griffin, as a creditor, seized at the time of the author's death. Unfortunately, however, as the publisher himself died shortly after this announcement, his intentions were never fulfilled. 15 Periodicals quoting directly from Q1 are the Critical Review, Gentleman's Magazine, London Chronicle, London Magazine, Monthly Review, and the Town and Country Magazine . As an instance of prevailing tastes I may observe that, while the extent of reprinting varies with each magazine, all cite lines 139-194 (on the village preacher), none lines 253-304 or 339-408. 16 II (1770), 168, 185-186. The same practice is generally evident and generally acknowledged in the Scots Magazine . 17 See W. J. Couper, The Edinburgh Periodical Press (Stirling, 1908), II, 118-122. 18 One such production, in my possession, is A Collection of Scarce, Curious and Valuable Pieces, Both in Verse and Prose, imprinted "Edinburgh: Printed by W. Ruddiman. M,DCC,LXXIII." 19 See T. B. Reed and A. F. Johnson, History of the Old English Letter Foundries (1952), pp. 340-341, and, for the use of this type elsewhere, John Alden, Studies in Bibliography, III (1950), 270-274. Besides its use in edition A, in the Weekly Magazine, and in Ruddiman's Collection (cf. fn. 18), it also appears in edition D, in the separate and collected issues of 1775, and, as Alden observes, in the first (Edinburgh) edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1771), Tait's Poetical Legends (imprinted London, 1775, but printed by J. Donaldson of Edinburgh) and Woty's Poetical Works (also imprinted London, date 1770, printer unknown). 20 For a succinct account of these and other suspicious characters, see F. A. Pottle, The Literary Career of James Boswell (1929), items 20, 50. 21 These two are further editions of the "unrevised" sequence under this title, but with imprint now reading "for W. Osborne, and T. Griffin, in Holborn." Unlike their predecessors of 1775 and 1778 which, as we have noted, appear to have been issued under false pretences, these were printed when the various rights were expiring and by persons who freely acknowledge their identity. Osborne was a recognized publisher, and his partner may be the "Thomas Griffin" mentioned as a brother in William's will of 1775. If the two editions were allowed, the authority certainly did not extend to the anonymously printed G nor to its (pirated?) copytext ca. 1783. 22 The reference is probably to I, by far the most corrupt of the reprints in this series. No doubt the earlier H was also in circulation, but as this appeared to be identical with I, went unrecognized.</field>

The authoritative text for the play is the earliest surviving quarto, printed by Short in 1598 and described traditionally as Q1, but known to be a reprint of an earlier edition of which only the four leaves of sheet C survive. Q1 was therefore a derivative print but has substantive status except for the eight surviving pages of its lost predecessor. Fortunately these eight pages give good ground for supposing that Q1 was, in substance, an unusually careful reprint. Each of Q1's successors was printed from its immediate predecessor and the Folio text was printed from Q5 (1613). The example of Q5 used for the Folio had been edited to serve as printer's copy in so far as act and scene divisions had been introduced and some profanity (though by no means all) had been removed. But although the Folio corrects twenty-six of Q5's known errors in the dialogue it is evident from its legacy of about two hundred errors from Q2-5 that no such systematic effort had been made to correct the Q5 readings as was made in preparing quarto copy for the Folio texts of Richard III, Troilus and Cressida, Lear, and Othello . 1 It is in connection with these four Folio texts that the Folio variants in 1 Henry IV are important. The quartos which served as Folio copy for these four plays had been purged of most of their errors by collation with authoritative playhouse manuscripts and these four Folio texts should preserve more authoritative readings than the quartos. But between the corrected quartos and the Folio an editor has to allow for the Folio compositors' errors. Some of these are self-evident and their removal is a simple matter. What an editor does not know, and cannot determine so satisfactorily from these texts as from a derivative text, is how many of the variants were authoritative corrections and how many of them compositors' errors. The following analysis of the variants in the Folio 1 Henry IV sheds some light on the question. 2 The Folio text of 1 Henry IV runs from p. 46 to p. 73 (d5 v —f6 r ) of the Histories. What should have been numbered p. 47 is numbered p. 49 and the pagination proceeded from this point without rectification. There are twenty-five and a half pages of text, of which, by my interpretation of the evidence of their characteristic spellings, compositor A set eleven pages and compositor B fourteen and a half. Their stints were as follows: B d5 v -e3 v (pp. 46-56) I. i. --II. iv. 143 A e4 r -f1 v (pp. 57-64) II. iv. 143 --III. iii. 111 B f2 r (p. 65) III. iii. 112 --IV. i. 19 A f2 v -f3 v (pp. 66-8) IV. i. 20 --IV. iv. 26 B f4 r -f6 r (pp. 69-73) IV. iv. 27 --end I shall first examine the verbal variants in the dialogue and then the variants in stage directions. By referring these to the compositor responsible for them it is easier to see what kind of alteration may have been made in the example of Q5 used as copy and what kind of alteration the compositors may have made on their own account. It will be evident from the above assignments that here, as elsewhere in the Folio, the stints of the compositors were governed by mechanical reasons and bear no relation to any literary considerations or divisions in the text. Hence the division is textually arbitrary and can serve as pure evidence. What is common to the work of the compositors may therefore have been in their copy, but marked discrepancies between the number and character of the variants in their work are more likely to represent personal idiosyncrasies. There are about one hundred and seventy dialogue readings in which the Folio differs verbally from Q5. Twenty-six of these variants are almost certainly correct since they restore Q1 readings corrupted in Q2-5. Nine of these readings occur in the pages set by A; seventeen in the pages set by B. They are as follows. I give the Folio reading in the first column, italicising the word or words restored and ignoring Folio italics.

In addition to the above, there are eight Folio variants which are generally accepted as necessary corrections of readings common to Q1-5. These are as follows. List (b) Compositor A III. i. 100 Cantle scantle IV. i. 55 is tis IV. iii. 28 ours our Compositor B I. i. 39 Herefordshire Herdforshire Q1-3; Herdfordshire Q4-5 II. iii. 3 in respect in the respect II. iv. 31 President present V. iv. 34 so defend and defend V. iv. 68 Nor Now The above Folio readings are accepted by the Cambridge editors, Dover Wilson, and Alexander. Over another five, opinion is divided, and I have therefore included them in later lists, indicating by initials in the appropriate place the editors who have preferred the Folio reading. We have in this (b) category something like the distribution of variants between A and B that occurred in list (a). With a few possible exceptions, the remaining Folio variants must be regarded as errors in view of the Folio text's derivative status; and there can be no doubt that, on an impartial view, this is indeed what they are. These variants differ strikingly in their distribution from the readings included in lists (a) and (b), since there are only eighteen in A's eleven pages but one hundred and thirteen in B's fourteen and a half. In the first place, there are only two literal errors in the pages set by A (one only if the substitution of 'pounds' for 'pound' is regarded as a normalisation), but there are twenty-four in the pages set by B. I again give the Folio readings in the first column.

Most of the above are errors of a trivial kind. Unfortunately, it was not only letters that B added, omitted and altered in reproducing his copy. Two words are omitted in A's pages (one only if 'Hart' at III.i.248 had been deleted as an oath); there are thirty omissions in the pages set by B (thirty-one if the loss of a biblical allusion at I.ii.86-7 was accidental). I again give the Folio reading in the first column, indicating the point at which the word or words were omitted by an asterisk; the second column records the Q1-5 words omitted.

There are six interpolations in A's pages. There are twenty-eight in B's (ignoring the interpolated word at IV.i.17, possibly supplied by the expurgator to compensate for the loss of 'Zounds' earlier in the line). I quote the Folio and italicise interpolations. List (e) Compositor A II. iv. 465 with 2 most most monstrous Watch III. iii. 69 giuen them away to Bakers Wiues, and they (C.)

The obstacles are that the tendency to interpolate is just as strong in prose as in verse and that there is no evidence of a metrical improver's hand in the pages set by A. Sometimes the Q5 line was halting, but at V.ii.94 the remedy was not far to seek since the two missing syllables were at the end of the preceding line. The interpolation of 'wond'rous' in I.iii.277 is particularly suspicious since the fancied need for these two syllables cannot have occurred until after the compositor had split the Folio line: Hot. I smell it. Vpon my life, it will do well is what was wanted. It is consequently not surprising that most of the verbal substitutions occur in B's pages. There are seven in A's (one a normalisation). There are twenty-three in B's, not counting a tendency, far more marked than in A's work, to substitute 'ye' for 'you' and to introduce elisions more freely. I again give the Folio reading in the first column. List (f) Compositor A III. i. 32 tombles topples III. i. 131 Candlestick cansticke III. i. 172 doe crosse come crosse III. ii. 156 intemperature (D.W., A.) intemperance III. iii. 24 thy Life my life IV. i. 85 Dreame tearme Q1-4; deame Q5 IV. ii. 31 them that haue (C.) them as haue Compositor B I. ii. 168 I,but Yea but I. iii. 26 As was As is Q1-4; As he Q5 I. iii. 27 Who either through enuy Either enuie therefore, or I. iii. 28 Was guilty Is guiltie I. iii. 60 That This I. iii. 66 Made me to answer I answered I. iii. 128 Although it be with Albeit I make a I. iii. 133 In his behalfe Yea on his part I. iii. 135 downfall down-trod II. i. 9 this that II. i. 13 is be Q1-4; to be Q5 II. i. 76 vnto to II. i. 89 purpose purchase II. i. 93 the Gelding my gelding II. ii. 10 that the II. iii. 19 if I and I II. iii. 96 thou speak'st you speake II. iii. 103 thee you II. iv. 10 telling me and tel me III. iii. 115 nothing thing III. iii. 151 if and V. iii. 11 to yeeld, thou haughty to yeeld thou proud Q5 a yeelder thou proud Q1-4 V. iv. 149 take't on take it vpon The distribution of these Folio variants is noticeably more patchy than that of any group hitherto considered. At first sight it looks as if an editorial hand had been at work on I.iii, but if there was editorial tinkering in this scene it seems to have been singularly pointless. 'I answered indirectly (as I said)', the quarto line at I.iii.66, is regular and has the briskness appropriate to Hotspur; 'Made me to answer indirectly (as I said.)' has nothing to recommend it. An alternative explanation of this kind of paraphrase (found also at I.iii.27, 128, 133) is loose memorisation; and a habit of following the matter with the mind rather than with the eye may explain why it is that we find one transposition in A's pages but eight in B's and three of them, perhaps significantly, in I.iii. List (g) Compositor A II. iv. 270 good Titles of Fellowship titles of good fellowship Compositor B I. ii. 91 now I am now am I I. iii. 112 let him not let not him I. iii. 145 was he not was not he I. iii. 233 haue poyson'd him haue him poisoned V. i. 137 Is it insensible tis insensible V. ii. 3 Then we are Then are we V. ii. 93 heere I draw here draw I V. v. 2 did we not did not we If we pause to consider what the variants so far amount to, what we have is as follows: A (11 pp.) B (14½ pp.) List (a) 9 17 Errors of Q5 corrected (b) 3 5 Errors of Q1-5 corrected (c) 2 24 Literal errors (d) 2 30 Words omitted (e) 6 28 Words interpolated (f) 7 23 Words altered (g) 1 8 Transpositions -- -- 30 135 -- -- It is evident from the above table that if, for the sake of argument, we were to suppose that all the Folio variants were introduced by the compositors we should then be forced to conclude that compositor A succeeded in restoring the correct reading on certainly nine and probably twelve occasions while introducing only eighteen errors and, much as one must respect A's normal accuracy, it seems doubtful whether he would have indulged in speculation so freely or have proved so shrewd a guesser. From A's work in the rest of the Histories it would appear that he was by habit conservative; and it is very likely that, when the veneer of compositors' spellings and of other normalisations is stripped from the Folio, the features of the copy will be much clearer in A's work than in B's. It was, for instance, compositor A who reproduced the quartos' typographical anomaly (' Rich. Ha.') in Richard III, I.iii.234 and compositor A who provided one of the strongest links between Q3 and the Folio by reproducing the 'as as' error at III.i.123. When working in haste his mistakes might be numerous, but I doubt if at any time he consciously took liberties with the wording of his copy. It is especially unlikely that compositor A would have supplied, on his own initiative, the speech prefixes for Peto and the Prince (missing from Q1-5) at II.iv.517, 522 or that he would have substituted the Prince for Gadshill and Gadshill for Russell at II.iv.166, 167, 169, 173. I judge therefore that, although the Folio compositors were probably responsible for some of the corrections in lists (a) and (b), 5 they are unlikely to have been responsible for them all. The corrections are too few and too haphazard to provide any clear indication as to when, by whom, or on what authority they were made. The considerable number of Q5 errors that escaped correction, as well as the Folio's failure to elucidate cruxes common to all known quartos, precludes our postulating even a desultory attempt at collation with a playhouse manuscript, and the Folio stage directions provide no warrant for supposing that the quarto had been used as prompt-copy. Nor, apparently, had the quarto been annotated by someone with a professional interest in flourishes, hautboys, cornets, and so on, like some of the quartos used for Folio reprints. At the same time, that the quarto came from the theatre is probably the inference to be drawn from the Folio's speech-prefix alterations in II.iv, and casual correction by someone familiar with the play would explain a few of the Folio readings in list (a) that seem too acute to be satisfactorily explained as conjectural: A's restoration of 'engrosse vp' at III.ii.148, for instance, or B's restoration of 'fat' at V.iv.107. Nor, in the present state of our knowledge, can we safely exclude the possibility that the copy was looked over when it reached Jaggard and conjecturally emended whenever a manifest breakdown in the sense or metre was noticed. That the preterite was wanted at II.iv.252 and IV.iii.70 is plain from the context and what was missing at IV.iv.16 is clear from IV.iv.14. Corrections like these might have been made editorially. Consequently it follows that some of the readings in lists (c) to (g) were conjectural emendations in the example of Q5, just as it is possible that some of the corrections in lists (a) and (b) were due to the compositors' accidental losses, interpolations, and transpositions. But, whatever we lay to the account of a playhouse scribbler or an editorial hand, we cannot bridge the gulf between the number of errors in A's work and in B's without supposing that an 'improver' happened to have lost interest in the dialogue of Q5 whenever compositor A chanced to become responsible for the Folio text; and the unlikelihood that A's portions of the copy were cleaner than B's is the greater since we should have to assume that the same thing happened in the case of Q3 copy for Richard III . The telltale list of literal errors in B's pages is, I think, suggestive of habitual carelessness and the suspicion that compositor B was unusually prone to take liberties with his copy is confirmed by an examination of the stage directions. Q1 was not, on the whole, badly equipped as regards stage directions, though it certainly lacked the finish that would be necessary in a promptbook. Its major omissions are not remedied in the Folio, though trivial alterations are numerous. In the items included in my first list below there is enough common ground in the work of the two compositors to make it probable that at least some of the changes found in the Folio had been made editorially in their copy.

Apart from the two alterations above, compositor A reproduced verbatim the stage directions of Q5. If there was some inspection of Folio copy after it reached Jaggard, it follows that some of the alterations in B's pages may have been editorial, but we cannot, I think, explain all his alterations in this way, especially as many of them are so pointless and show the same tendency to omit, add, and alter words as the variants in the dialogue set by B. We have here undoubtedly a combination of carelessness and highhandedness which may matter little in stage directions but is very serious when the validity of a dialogue reading is in question, particularly in text for which the Folio's authority is the higher. A conscientious proof-reader ought, of course, to have spotted compositor B's errors and it would be folly to generalise about Jaggard's proof-reading from the few variant formes exemplified in facsimiles. The proof-reader was sufficiently on the spot to see that something was wrong at II.iv.119 (list d), the copy was almost certainly consulted, and the correction that was made was perhaps the best that could be done in the circumstances. 7 On the same page (e3 v ), if facsimiles are to be trusted, 'Cop' was corrected to 'Cup' and 'Cowords' to 'Cowards' 8 ; but 'fatch' for 'fat' and an anomalous 'the' for 'thee' a few lines lower escaped notice or correction. Though it may be found that in aggregate the Folio proof-corrections were numerous, it is evident that, at times at least, the reader's main preoccupation was with disorders of the most trivial kind and that fidelity to copy did not enter into consideration. We have, for instance, in the Staunton and Oxford facsimiles the uncorrected and corrected versions of p. 71 (f5 r ), set by B (V.ii.79-V.iv.29). The following errors were corrected: V. ii. 100 earte to earth 101 sucond second sdch such The following dialogue variants from Q5 appear on this page in its uncorrected and corrected state: V. ii. 93 Q and here draw I F And heere I draw 94 Whose temper Whose worthy temper V. iii. 11 thou proud thou haughty 13 Lord Staffords Lords Staffords 37 and they are for and they for 40 lies starke likes starke 42 are yet vnreuengd are vnreueng'd I preethe Prethy V. iv. 6 your retirement you retirement I can see only one principle behind this kind of proof-reading and it is not a reassuring one for an editor: it is that a combination of letters should make a word, but that a combination of words ('Many a Nobleman likes starke and stiffe', 'Least you retirement do amaze your friends') need not necessarily make sense. It is therefore evident that we may find, when surviving copies of the First Folio have been collated, that an editor has been left to do much of the work that should have been done by Jaggard's proof-reader and the many obvious errors on Folio pages which are known to survive in their corrected state would make it seem over-optimistic to hope for anything better. The only reasonable interpretation of the hundred and thirteen errors in B's pages of the Folio 1 Henry IV , as against eighteen only in A's, is that they were for the most part due to the compositor's negligence; and even if we assumed that they included a liberal contribution of conjectural improvements, made in the copy and unaccountably concentrated in the parts that it fell to B's lot to reproduce, editorially the position is no better. If there was conjectural interference with the copy for one play there may have been tinkering with the copy for all, and the conjectural alterations of an erratic improver are as much a blemish on an edited text as the careless errors of a compositor. The latter is a serious proposition, but we have at least the advantage of being able to determine, from the character of his spelling and from the number of manifest errors in his work, when we should be particularly on guard; but if we are dealing with an irresponsible editor, who tinkered unsystematically and on no ascertainable principles, then the situation is desperate indeed. The question is whether we must expect to find errors of this kind, and in comparable numbers, in other Folio texts. Since the average number of variants in the dialogue of 1 Henry IV set by B is close on eight to a page, we are faced with the possibility that there may be at least two hundred errors in the Folio Lear and Othello for which compositor B was solely responsible. Must we assume that these two texts are pitted with holes and corrupted by interpolations and perversions of the wording? I think we must and that it is, in any case, plain that all is not as it should have been in these two texts. There is a lacuna in the Folio Othello (a line, phrase, or word omitted to the detriment of the metre or the sense) on between fifty and sixty occasions and this is what we should expect to find from the evidence of 1 Henry IV . The omissions may be even more numerous in the Folio Lear, since some allowance must be made for accidental omissions in the prompt-book. We must naturally expect to find some variation in a compositor's work between one play and another and even between one page and another. Haste doubtless led to excessive carelessness and prose must have been more troublesome than verse, owing to the narrowness of the Folio column. There are fewer errors in the Folio Richard II than in 1 Henry IV; nor is the discrepancy between the relative accuracy of the two compositors so striking in Richard II, though it is clear enough. Unless the context gives a clear indication of what is wanted, conservatism is inevitable in the case of Folio plays set from manuscript. However grave the suspicion of error, it is often wiser to accept what we have than to emend and run the risk of substituting one corruption for another. But in the case of plays printed from corrected quartos we are in a far more fortunate position. Though the quarto as a whole may have less authority than its Folio counterpart, by far the majority of the readings in the quartos of Richard III, Troilus and Cressida, Lear and Othello are not under suspicion. We are therefore not using these quartos to advantage if we reject what they have to offer both as a check on the readings of the Folio and as a means of correcting its errors. The errors can only be weeded out by bringing to bear on the readings all the relevant literary and linguistic considerations, but it is a help to know (even if it is only roughly) how many errors and what kind of errors a compositor may have introduced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 For an examination of the evidence substantiating my belief that the Folio Othello was printed from an annotated copy of Q1 and not from a manuscript, see my article in Shakespeare Survey V (1952), pp. 16-24 and my Textual Problems of the First Folio (1953), pp. 153-156. 2 After this article went to the printer, Sir Walter Greg most kindly provided me with photostats of the Malone copy of Q5, supplemented by photostats of G1 (defective in Malone) from a B.M. copy, so that I have been able to make an independent collation of this quarto with the Oxford facsimile of the First Folio text and to verify the collation notes of the editions used ( i.e., Hemingway's 1936 Variorum and the 1891-3 Cambridge). I have found nothing of importance to add to Hemingway's admirably full and accurate record of Q5 readings, though Q5's 'let them spake' for 'let them speake' at II.iv.164, 'you' for 'your' at V.ii.27, and F1's 'hee's' for 'he is' at III.i.233 should perhaps, in principle, have been recorded. The Malone copy, like the Jennens-Folger copy, has the uncorrected reading 'would' for 'I would' at III.iii.85 (see Hemingway's note to III.iii.82 in his edition). In view of Hemingway's reasonable conclusion that the Folio text was set up from a copy of Q5 with all know variant formes in the corrected state, I have disregarded the uncorrected readings of the Malone copy ('our' for 'your' at II.ii.64, 'would' for 'I would' at III.iii.85, and 'though' for 'thought' at IV.i. 2). In the present paper, all references are to the Cambridge edition. 3 By trivial errors I mean, of course, any combination of symbols which, through foul case or the omission, addition, or transposition of letters, failed to form a word or formed a word which, in the context, made no sense. I have also disregarded the Folio corrections (both compositor A's) of a duplicated word ('of of') at III.i.149 and an interpolated word ('tell', caught from the previous line) at IV.ii.56, since both of the Q5 errors would have been corrected by an attentive compositor. 4 Variants like 'whither' and 'whether', 'farther' and 'further', 'forward' and 'forwards', 'bore' and 'bare', and substitutions like 'ye' for 'you', 'you'l' for 'you will', and so on, are more relevant to the question of the Folio's fidelity to copy in accidentals than in substantive readings. 5 The first of A's corrections in list (a), for instance, might have been due to the unconscious transposition of the letters and the third to interpolation, but I infer that the majority of A's corrections were introduced in accordance with hand-corrections in the copy and that B's readings at I.ii.10, II.ii.104, V.i.5, V.i.40, V.i.90, V.iv.72, V.iv. 107 had probably similar warrant. 6 Disregarding A's normalisation of 'other' (Q4-5) to 'others' in the heading to III.ii. 7 The whole of the phrase could not have been restored without disturbing the following seven lines of type. 8 The abnormal spellings are those of the Oxford facsimile, which has the uncorrected reading at II.iv.119; the normal spellings are those of the Staunton facsimile, which has the corrected reading at II.iv.119.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Proof-Reading of the First Folio Text of Romeo and Juliet by Charlton Hinman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One cannot yet speak of the printing-house history of the First Folio of Shakespeare with any approximation of the finality that may soon be possible. 1 When a great many of the surviving copies of the Folio have been carefully collated throughout, so that we can be quite sure that at least most, if not all, of the variants produced in the course of the printing have been discovered and recorded—only then can we hope to reconstruct the full story of the proof-reading and stop-press correction that took place in Jaggard's shop during the printing of the volume. And only then can all of the editorial implications of the facts thus brought to light be properly understood. Few, therefore, save the most tentative of conclusions can at present be advanced as to the ultimate bibliographical and textual import of the variants in the First Folio. But the detailed collation of a mere twenty copies through about a third of the volume has already turned up variants in great abundance; and certain observations may here be made, if only to suggest some of the possible implications latent in one small group of variant readings that are evidently characteristic of some parts of the First Folio—and as evidently not characteristic of other parts. A convenient point of departure for these observations is offered by a newly found proof-sheet for one page in Romeo and Juliet . Three First Folio proof-sheets have hitherto been known, and may be briefly reviewed as follows. I. Proof-readers' marks calling for some 19 changes in one page of Antony and Cleopatra appear on the verso of a now disjunct single leaf from what was once the full sheet XXI:6. An examination of the 38 First Folios presently available for study at the Folger Shakespeare Library reveals: (a) that two of these 38 copies, some 5%, show the uncorrected state of XX6 v (page 352); and (b) that the conjugate forme-page, XXI v (page 341), is invariant. II. Folger First Folio No. 47 shows marks on VV3 r (p. 333, in Othello ) calling for nine corrections. One of the errors here marked must have required the proof-reader to consult his "copy": correction called for the substitution of one whole line for a very different one in the earlier state. Four of the 79 Folger copies, again about 5%, show the uncorrected state of both pages of the forme (VV3 r :4 v ), though neither Copy No. 47 nor any other shows proof-reader's marks on VV4 v (page 336). III. Folger No. 48 has marks on qq6 v (p. 292, in Lear ) requiring five corrections. The uncorrected state appears in about 7% of the Folger copies. The other forme-page (qq1 r , p. 381, in Hamlet ) is variant, but no Folger copy showing the earlier state of this page is marked for correction. 2 A fourth set of proof-reader's marks has now come to light. Forme ff1 v :6 r (pages 62 and 71) in Romeo and Juliet exists in two states. Nos. 24, 26, 38, 50, and 79 of the thirty-eight Folger copies at present in the Folger Library show the uncorrected state; and the two errors that characterize this state of ff6 r (p. 71) are marked for correction in Folger No. 50 (see Cut I). The variant readings of the forme are as follows (uncorrected states first; positions identified by page-number, column, and line in the Folio and within parentheses by act, scene, and line in the Globe edition): p. 62, col. b, line 5 (II, iv, 124) [qua-/] th aGentleman: [qua-/] t ha:Gentlemen, p. 71, col. a, line 8 (IV, i, 37) own now p. 71, col. b, line 38 (IV, ii, 2) Coekes Cookes On page 62, three kinds of alterations are made. "Gentleman" is made plural and both the spacing and the punctuation are changed. Yet we have in essence only one variant reading here: the good Angelica, having first reacted to the previous speech by Romeo, is made by the correction to begin with a properly deferential salutation the question that she now addresses to all three of the gentlemen before her. Although the corrected reading is substantially that of the copy from which the Folio text was set, the Quarto of 1609, the change almost certainly reflects only the independent authority of the proof-reader. (Had copy been consulted, the errors in the line above would doubtless have been mended as well.) The corruption of the first setting is only a little less simple and obvious than that in the two readings that were corrected in the other forme-page. As in the two other instances in which the marked page appears in an extant Folio, the Romeo and Juliet leaf bearing the proof-reader's marks has its normal conjugate and the whole sheet was evidently bound into the volume in a perfectly regular manner, like any unmarked sheet. And as in both the other instances the conjugate forme-page is characterized by a single reading that was corrected, although the error was not marked for correction in the copy that served as proof for the other page of the forme. Thus, it will be observed, we now have further confirmation for the hypothesis first advanced in 1942: 3 that, in effect, the proof-reading unit for at least some parts of the First Folio was normally the single page, though the correction unit was of course the forme, both pages of which were ordinarily corrected in a single unlocking operation. But the present proof-sheet is chiefly of interest for other reasons and in conjunction with other evidence of the kind of proof-reading to which Romeo and Juliet was subject. The factors that differentiate the press-correction of Romeo and Juliet from what we find (or fail to find) elsewhere in the volume may prove, indeed, to be far more significant than the common factors. It may be remarked, first of all, that the evidence for identifying ff6 r in Folger No. 50 as in fact a proof-sheet is anything but abundant. The errors marked, and those alone, were the ones corrected, to be sure; and that the marks on the Romeo and Juliet page (see Cut I) were the standard symbols for indicating transpositions and obvious single-letter errors is made perfectly clear by the repeated uses of the same marks for such errors in the other proof-sheets. (See Cut III for examples in the Antony and Cleopatra proof-sheet of both kinds of marks that appear in the Romeo sheet. Cut II shows the corrected state of p. 71; Cuts IV and V show the uncorrected and corrected states of p. 62.) Yet the ink of the Romeo proof-marks is now darker than that found in all the other proof-sheets; the transposition mark is not, as elsewhere, marginal; and there is some slight difference in the form of this symbol here and on p. 352 in Antony . 4 That these marks in Romeo and Juliet and those found in the other proof-sheets were made by different hands obviously cannot be maintained on the basis of such evidence; but the suspicion here bred is fostered by various other considerations. Certainly it is rather surprising, to begin with, that so many copies show the uncorrected state of ff1 v :6 r —five out of 38, nearly one copy in every seven: something over 13%. This phenomenon might, of course, be supposed the result of mere chance, except that it is encountered elsewhere in Romeo and Juliet . Variant forme ee3 r :4 v is found uncorrected in five copies out of 37; ff2 r :5 v in four; and uncorrected ee2 v :5 r in 21 out of 36 copies, almost 60%. Certainly, it would seem, there was no very eager concern in Jaggard's shop over the errors that might mar large numbers of the copies of the finished book in Romeo and Juliet; for it is manifest that the proof-reading for this play was frequently not undertaken until long after the first pulls on a new forme had begun to come off the press. And this lack of concern is reflected also by the small number and inferior quality of the corrections that at length were made—and by the hosts of errors, many of them apparent at a glance, that yet remain in the "corrected" pages of this play, not to mention new error sometimes introduced in the very process of correction. One of the most striking things about the Romeo and Juliet proof-sheet, of course, is that it marks only two small errors for correction; and we have seen that only one reading was corrected in the other page of the same forme. This kind of thing is not invariably characteristic of the variant formes in Romeo and Juliet, but it is certainly the general rule. One forme (ee3 v :4 r ) shows fourteen variants in one and eleven variants on the other of its two pages. Throughout the rest of the play, however, the largest number of corrections in any single page now known to be variant is a mere three; and four of these pages have but one correction each. Combined, moreover, with this paucity of individual variants is a startling abundance of variant pages. A collation of only twenty copies has turned up 12 variant pages out of the 25 pages of the play; and it is not impossible that we may eventually discover that every single page of the Folio text of Romeo and Juliet was subjected to stop-press correction. 5 The treatment accorded Romeo and Juliet during the printing of the First Folio seems to have been characterized, therefore, by a great deal of rather tardy proof-reading that resulted in very few actual corrections. 6 The remarkable contrast between this kind of treatment and the kind accorded the plays immediately before and after Romeo and Juliet in the Folio ( Coriolanus and then Titus Andronicus precede; Timon, Julius Caesar, and Macbeth follow) is perhaps best pointed up by the following three facts: (1) The first two and a half leaves of the ee quire of the First Folio contain the last five pages of Titus Andronicus, Romeo and Juliet beginning on ee3 r . Hence each of four formes of the ee quire contains one page of Titus and one of Romeo . Now every variant forme throughout Romeo in which both pages contain Romeo text is variant in both pages of the pair. But two of the twelve variant pages of Romeo, ee5 r and ee6 r , are in formes shared by Romeo and Titus . In each of these cases the Titus text is invariant, correction having been confined—at least in the copies so far collated—to Romeo and Juliet . 7 (2) The collation of twenty First Folios, though revealing numerous variant pages in Romeo and Juliet, discovers not a single variant in Coriolanus, only four variant pages in Titus, no variants whatever in Timon, four variant pages in Julius Caesar, and one variant page in Macbeth: a total of nine variant pages in these five whole plays as compared with twelve in Romeo and Juliet alone (though there are a few more individual variants in the nine pages than in the twelve). 8 (3) Perhaps most clearly indicative of the kind of printing-house treatment accorded Romeo and Juliet in contrast with that given most of the plays just before and just after it in the Folio is the inferior quality of the Romeo text notwithstanding the relatively large number of its pages now known to have been proof-read and corrected. On this last point the present writer can speak only with "a scattering and unsure observance," for he is by no means expert on the texts of the first six tragedies in the folio. Yet he could not fail to notice, while collating these plays, that Romeo and Juliet is peculiar in the abundance of obvious error that both its corrected and its uncorrected states show—and which, indeed, seems sometimes to infect the very process of correction itself. The proof-page, for example, shows the correction of two small mistakes but leaves unmarked and uncorrected at least a dozen others where corruption is just as evident. Column a alone has, among others: Godſheild: I for Godſhield I ſtreames " ſtraines heart, and " heart and ſtay " ſlay thinglike " think like Fro of " From of chappels " chapless And most of these errors originated in the Folio: only two of the seven are present in the copy, the Quarto of 1609. The other page of the forme is about equally corrupt. Even its one variant speech illustrates the carelessness and incompletenes of the proof-reading to which it was subject; for although the second line of the speech is corrected—except that the spacing is never made quite right (see Cuts IV and V)—the comma after "to" in the line above should patently come after "mar"; and it is almost as apparent that a word has been omitted before "ſaid" (Q 1609 has "well ſaid"). Probably, too, the final letter of this line should be an "o" rather than an "a", though here the copy is accurately represented. Again, the single correction made in p. 70 (ff5 v ) is of a minor error in spacing—"boſom ehenceforth" for "boſome henceforth", as in the Quarto—yet numerous equally obvious and scarcely more trifling mistakes remain: bowles for bowle ride " tide ſtraue " ſtarue Hlacke " Alacke talke for talk'd [probably; though here F=Q] Benig " Being —to mention only a few, and only one that is derived from the Quarto. Even the page that shows fourteen variants (ee3 v , p. 54) still shows in its corrected state a good many obvious errors not found in the copy: others for other Love,is " Love is Be. n " Ben. henec " hence among several others. And beside such failures to correct at all may be set examples of failure to correct correctly. In variant page 74 (gg1 v ) "Tortyrs" is changed to "Tortoyrs"—the word "Tortoys" [ tortoise], as in the Quarto, having been intended. An "o" was rightly added after the second "t" but the absurd second "r" of the original setting was not removed. Whether the marker of the proof-sheet for this page was as much at fault as the "correcting" compositor we can only guess. Finally, in page 55 (ee4 r ) the line And ſhe ſhall ſcant ſhell, well, that now ſhewes best. becomes And ſhe ſhew ſcant ſhell, well, that now ſhewes best. where what was intended was evidently And ſhe ſhall ſcant ſhew well, that now ſhewes best. (This is the reading of the Quarto, where, however, part of the spacequad between "ſhew" and "well" is slightly inked. This inked spacequad does not look much like a comma, but the Folio compositor seems to have been scarcely more alert when he set this line than when he corrected it.) Our proof-reader doubtless indicated that the word "ſhew" was to be substituted for the "ſhell," of the first setting; but it was substituted for the similar "ſhall" two words earlier instead. Here, surely the compositor nodded badly; though again it is possible that the over-casual marks of the proof-reader contributed to the ultimate muddle. In any event it is clear that the proof-reading of this line only produced, at last, a reading even worse than the one originally set. We have been considering, of course, only errors of the simplest kinds, those due as a rule to the minor lapses of a compositor. Obscure and complex errors, and corruptions resulting either from the peculiarities of the copy or from the more serious failures of the compositor, have not been in question (nor were, evidently, to the Romeo proof-reader); and it should be remembered that a text quite free of obvious errors may yet be very corrupt—though it seems but reasonable to suppose that type-setting that is full of small errors is likely to contain large ones as well. 9 Hence the phenomena described above do not of themselves provide any sound basis for final conclusions as to the essential qualities of the texts of the six plays mentioned. But the phenomena are nevertheless suggestive. The plays just before and just after Romeo and Juliet in the First Folio exhibit no such abundance of obvious error as we find here—nor so many variant formes; nor such large numbers of copies showing the uncorrected states of these variant formes; nor so much evidence that the proof-reading was characteristically as careless as it was tardy; nor such signs of badly executed correction. To some extent the typesetting, but above all the proof-reading that went into the Folio text of Romeo and Juliet, is of a special order, clearly differentiating this play from most of the plays nearby. A particular attitude toward the Romeo text would seem to have prevailed in the printing-house during the preparation of this play for the Folio—as if the compositor and the proof-reader alike, though having their jobs to do, were somehow unable to discharge their appointed tasks with their usual conscientiousness—as if they were but too well aware that they were here perpetuating only the reprint of a reprint of the play. As I insisted at the beginning of this paper, it would be imprudent to infer from the variant readings of the First Folio so far known any but very tentative conclusions. The evidence that has been presented will serve at least to indicate that different plays were treated with very different degrees of care in Jaggard's shop during the printing of the First Folio, the relative attentiveness of the proof-reader 10 being one of the significant variables. Perhaps it will indicate also that a study of all of the Folio's variants, when these have at length been found, may have a good deal to teach us, not alone as bibliographers and students of printing-house practices and techniques, but also as editors of the various plays of Shakespeare. And, finally, a very specific suggestion may be made. The conjecture was hazarded above (see note 8) that at least some of the plays printed for the Folio from manuscript copy were given much more careful treatment than were certain other plays that were set, like Romeo and Juliet, from printed copy. The basis for this inference is admittedly not yet very solid: it consists in part in the mere scarcity of variants so far discovered in such plays as Coriolanus, Timon, and Macbeth . But let no prospective editor of Coriolanus, for example, forthwith conclude that the Folio text of this play is not only remarkably good but also invariant. For if variants turn up, as they probably will, they may prove more interesting than those minor tidyings-up so characteristic of Romeo and Juliet . As in other things, the rarer the more likely to be valuable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The present writer has recently embarked on the task of collating the entire Folger collection of 79 First Folios. Twenty copies have now (April 1953) been collated throughout the "Tragedies" (including Troylus and Cymbeline ) and 79 copies through sigs. ss-vv ( Othello and parts of Lear and of Antony and Cleopatra ). About two years will be required for the collation of the Folger First Folios throughout all thirty-six plays. As a precaution against possible disaster, only about half of the irreplaceable Folger copies are being kept in the Library in Washington; but the other copies will be brought back for collation as soon as work has been completed on the copies now available. 2 E.E. Willoughby's The Printing of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1932) has as its frontispiece a full-sized reproduction of the Antony proof-sheet and, on pp. 62-63, a discussion of it. Illustrations of the Othello and Lear proof-sheets accompany my articles about them: "A Proof-Sheet in the First Folio of Shakespeare," The Library, 4th ser., XXIII (1942), 101-107; and "Mark III: New Light on the Proof-Reading for the First Folio of Shakespeare," Studies in Bibliography, III (1950), 145-153. 3 See pp. 103-104 in the Library article and pp. 150-151 in the SB article cited in note 2 above. 4 Drs. Willoughby, McManaway, and Dawson, of the Folger staff, all share my conviction that the page in question is nevertheless a perfectly genuine proof-sheet. 5 I consider this unlikely, especially in view of the four variant pages showing only one correction each: probably some pages, though proof-read, were deemed to require no correction. Yet the possibility remains lively that at least a few more variant pages are yet to be found. 6 Such peculiarities certainly tend to support the conjecture that the Romeo and the Antony proof-sheets were marked by different readers. It will be recalled that the Antony reader marked nineteen errors in the page, but that only two out of the 38 copies examined show the uncorrected state. 7 It is possible, though I believe it unlikely, that these two pages of Titus will eventually be found to be variant. If so, the uncorrected states will be found paired with other, and earlier-printed, uncorrected states of the Romeo pages than have yet turned up; and we should thus have clear evidence that the same forme was twice unlocked: first to correct errors in Titus, and then later to correct Romeo . 8 Titus contains by much the greatest number of variant formes (four, as against a total of three in the four other plays); and the uncorrected states of three of these formes appear in over 20% of 38 copies—an abundance not found in the variant formes of Caesar and Macbeth . Thus Titus is much more like Romeo than are the others. Is it mere coincidence that Titus is the only one of these five plays that was, like Romeo and Juliet, set up from printed copy? And that the two plays in which no variants whatever have yet been found were probably set from MSS in Shakespeare's own hand? 9 This could of course be checked in the case of the Folio text of Romeo, since the Quarto of 1609 from which it was set can be studied. But unfortunately the plays for which the First Folio gives us a really authoritative text are precisely those that were not set from copy now extant. 10 Or, of course, of different proof-readers. See note 6.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Shakespeare's Text and the Bibliographical Method by Fredson Bowers *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though definition of terms is dull work, any paper which attempts to discuss bibliographical method had better state what it means by that phrase, for of all modern terms for scholarly disciplines, 'bibliography' is perhaps the loosest used and the least understood. From among the various subdivisions of bibliography, two have the greatest bearing on the problems of Shakespeare's text. The first is analytical, or, as it is often called, critical bibliography . This I take to be the technical investigation of the printing of specific books, or of general printing practise, based exclusively on the physical evidence of the books themselves. Such a line of investigation may detect and explain cancels and reprinted substituted sheets of all kinds. It is especially concerned with the presswork of a book, and it may explain by the use of mechanical evidence the number of presses engaged on a book, the order of the formes through the press, the printing together as one sheet of widely separated leaves, or the assignment of parts in a book broken up and printed simultaneously in sections. In Sir Walter Greg's phrase, it treats a book not as a literary document but simply as a tangible object produced by a physical process. The evidence the method employs is correspondingly physical, and the ideal is to build up a case which could be taken to a court of law for a favorable verdict. This is analytical bibliography in its purest sense. Two illustrations may be given of its operations on Shakespeare problems. The first is the famous case of the 1619 Shakespeare editions which were falsely dated reprints, the so-called Pavier quartos . By a magnificent piece of bibliographical detective work in analysis, Greg and Neidig first showed, on the mechanical evidence of the similarity in watermarked paper and the fact that there was standing type in the title-pages, that these editions—which purported to have been printed at widely varying dates—were in truth manufactured continuously at one time, some years after the dates alleged on various titles. The importance of this discovery for Shakespearian textual criticism cannot be over-estimated. Since the dates on some of these quartos were the same as those for authentic first editions, scholars, who had previously been able to operate only by what critical acumen they possessed, had in some cases confused the correct order and had set up one or more of these late and unauthoritative reprints as the true first edition of the very highest textual authority. Although there had not been complete unanimity of opinion in this matter, there was no method by which critical judgment could positively demonstrate the correct order. Yet Greg's mechanical evidence could have been taken into a court of law. His case—being bibliographical in an analytical sense —could and did positively demonstrate the correct order by physical evidence admitting no further controversy. At one stroke questions of the relative order and authority of a number of texts were settled once and for all. My second illustration has no such far-reaching consequences, but it is an especially neat example of how strict analytical bibliography can clarify muddied waters. The quarto of Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida exists in two forms. In one, the title-page is conjugate in its gathering, and on it the play is stated to have been acted at the Globe. In the other this title-page is cancelled and is replaced by two leaves in a fold. On the first leaf, a new title-page omits reference to this public acting. An anonymous preface appears on the second leaf, which somewhat offensively, perhaps, denies that the play was ever publicly acted and hints that it is now being printed against the wishes of the 'grand possessors.' In the first investigations, the order of these two title-pages was confused and the true first was thought to be a correction of the second. However, the physical facts of cancellation and substitution were soon discovered to set that right—a piece of analytical bibliography in itself. Thereafter, it was automatically assumed that a considerable time-lag intervened between the printing of the first form and of its cancel substitute; and on the basis of this assumption a number of rather fantastic theories were evolved to explain the reasons for the printing of the new title and the preface. What exact circumstances lie behind the situation we still do not know as clearly as we should like, perhaps, but of one thing we may now be certain: the substitute title and preface were not added to the play some time after publication as a result of any set of hypothetical circumstances. Dr. Philip Williams has been able to show by purely mechanical evidence, analyzing the running-titles for what they demonstrate must have been the method of printing, that the two cancel leaves were printed as an integral part of the last sheet of the text, the full sheet then being cut apart and its two halves designed one to go at the beginning and the other at the end of the quarto. This physical demonstration does not, it is true, explain the curious statements in the preface—since these are not susceptible to attack by bibliographical evidence—but it has the virtue of severely limiting the scope of future theories by establishing that the play had not been published when the change was decided upon, and that less than a fortnight could have elapsed between the physical printing of the first title and the decision to cancel it in favor of the substitute halfsheet. Whatever explanation for the anomaly that is to be offered, therefore, must not overstep the limits set by these two pieces of evidence. It is of importance to notice that analytical bibliography in treating a book as a tangible object deliberately operates without regard for the meaning of the text contained in the book. This is not purblindness but instead a logical and necessary restriction of the discipline to its proper mechanical evidence. I may illustrate with an example of a reading from Richard II . If one is investigating the history of its text the first problem that arises when one comes to the third edition is whether this Q3 was printed from Q1 or from Q2. There happens to be sufficient textual evidence, but in fact A. W. Pollard pointed out one piece of bibliographical proof which needs no further corroboration. In a particular line the word for appears clearly printed in Q1; in Q2 the word is again for, but the f is very faintly inked. The compositor of Q3 overlooked this faint f and printed the word as or . Trivial as the example is, it has important implications for method. The point is this. If we were to rely on meaning only, no evidence could be adduced. The word or instead of for is clearly wrong, but it could have occurred as a simple misprint if Q1 had been the copy. But without regard for rightness or wrongness, we can demonstrate, on this one piece of evidence alone, that Q2 was the copy because the faint inking of the letter f provides a mechanical reason for its omission in Q3. A more pertinent use of this sort of evidence comes in Dryden's Wild Gallant where it alone is sufficient to decide the difficult question of priority for the first and second editions printed in the same year. Here, in one edition, only the tip of a letter l inked, producing a mark that could easily be mistaken for an apostrophe. And as an apostrophe it appears in the other edition. A court of law would accept this evidence, for to reverse it one would be forced to argue that in a first edition the compositor set an apostrophe and in the second another compositor in the same place set an imperfect letter l which inked so as to resemble an apostrophe. I should not myself care to be briefed for such a defense. I have spent time on these examples because they may assist somewhat when we come to the second branch of bibliography of which I spoke—this is textual bibliography . Since it may often occur that there is a difficulty in drawing a sharp line between textual and analytical bibliography in specific cases, I offer a rather over-simplified definition at the start. I take it that textual bibliography is the application of the evidence of analytical bibliography, or at least of its pertinent methods, to textual problems where meaning of some sort may be involved even though very slightly. Or if, in the strictest possible sense, meaning is not involved, textual bibliography deals with printing evidence which—in ordinary contrast to analytical bibliography—relies on cumulation for building up its case, and on some degree of interpretation. Because it is a form of bibliography, the textual method must still firmly base itself on the evidence of the printing process but it may associate palaeographical evidence with this, as well as evidence of any sort that seems pertinent. The nearer it approaches to analytical bibliography the more certain and mechanically demonstrable are its results; the farther it dissociates itself, the more its evidence becomes speculative, cumulative in its effect, and in need of interpretation. Very much in general, analytical bibliography has a tendency to find its normal material in larger questions of fact, whereas textual bibliography ultimately attempts to apply its findings to specific and even minute points. The field is so very broad that generalisations are difficult and I had better proceed to examples. Before any logical approach could be made to the problem of the King Lear text, not only did the Pavier quarto need to be cleared out of the way as having any authority, but also the precise relationship of the first quarto and folio texts had to be established. By relationship I mean specifically their tangible relationship: was the Folio text printed from a manuscript or was it printed from an annotated copy of the first quarto. On the answer to this question hinges the entire logical approach one must take to the variants between the two texts in general, as well as in any specific reading. It happens that there is evidence which is at least on the fringes of the bibliographical method, that is, evidence of the Folio making a wrong rationalization in an attempt to ungarble a quarto corruption. In King Lear an example comes at II.iv.100 where in its unproofread state the first quarto read, "the dear father | Would with his daughter speak; come and tends service". The Folio, struggling with this unsatisfactory passage, changed "come and tends service" to the scarcely more satisfactory "commands, tends, service". "Commands her service" is of course the right reading as found in the proofread state of the quarto; the point here is simply that the Folio error can be explained only on the basis that the quarto error served as printer's copy. Another example of what I mean comes from Richard II . Line I.i.77 reads in the first quarto, "What I have spoke or thou canst worse devise." Q2 corrupted the line by omitting 'worse' and reading, "What I have spoke or thou canst devise." The Q3 compositor mended the metre by adding 'what' to make the line read smoothly, "What I have spoke or what thou canst devise." This form for some reason was altered in the Folio by omitting the 'what' and changing 'spoke' to 'spoken': "What I have spoken or thou canst devise." Here the chain of rationalization is clear, as we see compositors or editors reconstructing a defective line according to their own tastes. Or one can illustrate further with the incorrect Folio "had his current" at V.iii.63, the result of the compositor's bewilderment at the spelling 'hald' in the "hald [ or 'held'] his current" of his copy. It is true that these Folio variants are readily explained by our ability to trace the printing of the text through its various forms. To this extent the method is bibliographical, but it is somewhat remotely so perhaps in contrast to the truly bibliographical form which the clinching evidence took. The first quarto of King Lear was very considerably proof-corrected during the course of its printing so that all but a few sheets exist in two states of the readings. That the Folio was definitely printed not from any original manuscript but at least basically from a copy of the quarto became clear when P. A. Daniel, and later Sir Walter Greg, pointed out that in some instances the Folio text follows the uncorrected readings of certain quarto sheets, as with "commands, tends" for "come and tends," an impossible occurrence for a text set from an author's manuscript since these readings must have been copies of the blunders and misreadings of the Q1 compositor. This is very close indeed to mechanical proof, and the example places textual bibliography as near to analytical as it can come. * Somewhat similar investigations in Shakespeare are those of Philip Williams with Troilus and Cressida, and Charlton Hinman with Othello . In the one case such printing evidence as the common variable use of italic or roman type for names, as well as the forms taken by the speech headings, settled the long-vexed question of the relation of the Folio Troilus to the quarto by showing beyond doubt that the Folio was indeed set from a copy of the quarto and not from a manuscript. In the other, similar typographical evidence established that in Othello the Q2 passages of added text, first found in the Folio, were set from the Folio and not from another manuscript. This latter I believe offers a splendid example of the certainty of the bibliographical method when operating on its proper forms of evidence as against the uncertainty of the critical method. So long as the case was considered only from the critical point of view, doubt existed whether the variants in the Q2 text from the text in the Folio were not the result of printing from different copy, a manuscript. And in fact I believe I am correct in stating that every text available today actually takes over one or more of these Q2 variants, as representing an actual recovery of what Shakespeare really wrote. Yet Dr. Hinman, using mechanical evidence from the printing, has proved beyond any doubt that Q2 is a mere reprint of the Folio for the added passages and that no reading from it can have any independent authority whatsoever. The bibliographical method, here, shows that criticism—with all its positive virtues—can indeed be fallible. But I am not interested today in listing the various horrid examples in Shakespeare in which bibliography has exposed the errors of what Sir Walter Greg calls 'metacritical' writers. I do want, however, to pursue a little more narrowly some differences between true bibliography and psuedo-bibliography, because this pseudo-bibliography has sometimes masqueraded as the real thing in Shakespearian textual criticism. 1 Earlier I emphasized that to be called textual bibliography the method of investigation must be firmly rooted in the printing process; and I distinguished between analytical bibliography in which the evidence is not textual—at least in the purest state of analytical bibliography—and textual bibliography in which the chief concern is with the printing of the text as such, and the evidence is therefore drawn from the text and its characteristics although still in a largely mechanical manner. I can illustrate now, I believe, with a concrete example which may be of assistance. If a book were set by more than one compositor, it is of the highest importance to distinguish the exact pages composed by each workman, for each in all probability will have adopted somewhat different attitudes towards the text and, at the least, each will have imposed upon the author's manuscript somewhat different spelling and punctuational characteristics. Analytical bibliography has one certain method for making this distinction on purely mechanical grounds, although the method, unfortunately, works better for Restoration than for Elizabethan times, reflecting the difference between the fixed and the adjustable composing sticks. If one compositor takes over from another and does not have a stick of exactly the same length in which he sets the lines of type, the close measurement of the variant width of the type-page will infallibly detect the presence of these two workmen using slightly different setting sticks. This is mechanical evidence at its purest, and it is certainly analytical bibliography. Textual bibliography, using evidence based on the physical features of the text as such, may also distinguish the presence of more than one compositor by its own methods. Differences in the typographical characteristics of act and scene headings, of stage directions, of turned-over versus split lines of verse, of the setting of proper names, and of the forms of speech-prefixes have all been used with success in the dramatic texts. Of a different nature is a spelling analysis which classifies the variable habits of compositors and assigns different favorite methods of spelling the same word or similar groups of words as a distinction. Each bibliographical method employs the printing process though in different ways. Now what I wish to point out specifically is that while the results may in some degree be inferential and cumulative, for textual bibliography, since the evidence is based on the variable and sometimes unpredictable characteristics of human beings as they perform their tasks, as against the result from the printer's stick which bases its evidence on a piece of equipment in the printer's shop; nevertheless, actual and physical evidence is employed, and inferences are drawn from a very large body of cumulative evidence, not—as with pseudo-bibliography—from mere speculations as to what might have happened in the course of printing. In other words, true bibliography even in its inferences building up to an hypothesis—I dare say even in its occasional speculations—must govern itself by laws of evidence of a nature very similar to those which govern a Queen's Counsel in court. These laws of evidence, I take it, concern the logical process by which a chain of ascertained facts is linked together to show a certain relation between presumed cause and indubitable effect. Circumstantial evidence welds these links together. In some cases time may show that because of certain missing evidence or of some logical fault in the series of interpretations, the ultimate case was wrong; but it is perhaps not unknown in courts for a judgment to miscarry because all evidence was not procurable, or because counsel made a particularly dazzling leap over what for a less ingenious man would have been a yawning chasm in the evidence. If miscarriages of justice occur, whether in law or in bibliography, the fault is not in the method but in the application. Parenthetically, I should remark that the most dangerous fault in bibliography is for a scholar, self-convinced, to attempt to carry his evidence further than in fact it will reach without specifying the point at which he is forsaking irreversible evidence for inference, and inference for speculation. Professor Dover Wilson's researches are frequently concerned with the bibliographical matters of the printing process and of compositorial and proofreaders' habits; but in his monograph on the manuscript of Hamlet and its printed transmissions he is prone to use personal generalizations and speculations about printing and to apply these assumptions to the text in question as if they were facts which had been previously ascertained as true by the corelation of large quantities of physical evidence derived from the actual texts under examination. This is a very dangerous method for unwary students to read, since they are often dazzled by the seemingly bibliographical display of information without recognizing that in truth the process of building up to an hypothesis through a chain of circumstantial evidence governed by strict laws has not been observed. The language of bibliography may have been used, but not the method. It is incumbent upon me to illustrate, and I choose an example each from his consideration of the Quarto and the Folio texts of Hamlet . Professor Wilson makes two assumptions about the compositor of the good second quarto of Hamlet, our basic text, which are very important for his theory. (1) Only one compositor set the whole text. (2) This compositor was an untutored dolt who was setting difficult copy at a rate far beyond his normal speed. As proof for the first, that only one compositor set the text, he asserts only that the imperfections are so uniformly distributed throughout that it is inconceivable they belong to two different workmen. This is not bibliographical evidence, or proof, and it would be thrown out in any court of law, for if the imperfections of the copy were in some part responsible for the printed results there might well be a relatively even distribution of error. But convinced that the errors are compositorial, Wilson automatically accepts as authoritative various extra words supplied by the Folio, and then uses—with some circularity of argument—the appearance of these words in the Folio as demonstration that they were missing in the quarto. This may be textual criticism of a sort, but it is not bibliography. Bibliography would use demonstrable evidence at the very start of the argument to ascertain whether in fact one or two compositors set the text. The only scientific method of demonstration, the evidence of the printer's stick failing as it does, would be to determine by a spelling test whether variable or uniform compositorial habits are found in the spelling, leading by classification into the assignment by pages of composition by different workmen or to the hypothesis that only one workman was concerned with the typesetting. This basic examination is only now being worked on. But for the sake of argument let us hypothecate (what is actually untrue) that only one compositor set the second quarto of Hamlet . If he were the illiterate numbskull that Wilson makes him out to be, it is difficult to see how he was hired except as an apprentice in a competitive and rigorously controlled trade. Wilson's confident statements that this compositor could memorize no more than one or two words at a time before turning to his cases to set the required type are, of course, absurd since a disability of this nature would certainly have prevented any printer from hiring such a workman. Moreover, the very examples of anticipation errors which Wilson provides and assigns to this compositor disprove automatically his theory. But normal or abnormal, it is of some importance to learn whether this compositor was in fact immoderately rushed in his typesetting, for such a theory has some bearing on the fidelity of his text. Wilson assumes that he was, on the basis of his errors. But this is not bibliographical evidence, since the errors may have been caused by other factors. Indeed, the evidence of analytical bibliography suggests quite the contrary, and that the compositor was under no especial pressure. The details are too technical to offer here. Suffice it to say that certain assumptions can be made about the speed of presswork in relation to compositorial speed of typesetting, at this time, on the evidence of the specific manner in which the type-formes are imposed for the press, specifically on the evidence for the number of skeleton-formes constructed to hold the type-pages. That is, for this date it seems established that the apparent inefficiency of the one-skeleton method is not actually time-wasting if the press for various reasons is ahead of the compositor. On the other hand, for the two-skeleton method to be worth attempting the compositor must be comfortably ahead of the press. Hence it is more than ordinarily significant that Q2 Hamlet is printed by the two-skeleton method, an unlikely situation if the compositor were as hurried as Wilson asserts. But the evidence may be even more specific. Sheets B, C, and D are imposed with a pair of skeleton-formes; but with sheet E two more skeletons are constructed and thereafter the two sets of pairs roughly alternate, the B-C-D pair imposing sheets F and I whereas the new pair imposes sheets G, H, K, and L, until with sheets M, N, and O the two pairs mix together according to a pattern which at the moment I have not worked at enough to comment on. This general alternation involving the use of four skeleton-formes is inexplicable for printing with one press; yet if we hypothecate two presses it follows that there must have been more than one compositor. And recently Dr. Alice Walker has communicated to me a spelling analysis she has made of Q2 in which the results in an almost uncanny fashion coincide with the sheets imposed by different skeletons to indicate with considerable certainty the presence of two compositors. This dramatic new evidence may possibly be buttressed, her preliminary further analysis shows, by evidence of these same compositors in other Roberts' quartos. If all this proves true, and there would seem to be little question of the validity of the evidence, then so much for Wilson's non-bibliographical assumptions about the uniformity of compositorial error throughout Q2 and his highly colored picture of the harried and driven single workman. If so much for these assumptions, then perhaps so much for a number of far-reaching conclusions he has drawn about the text on the basis of his false evidence. The case is no better for his consideration of the printing of the Folio text. In examining what he believes to be the remarkably higher percentage of error in the Folio Hamlet in comparison to Antony and Cleopatra, the purpose being to assign the error to the playhouse scribe and not to the Folio compositors, he writes, "So wide indeed is the disparity that assuming as we legitimately may that the texts were set up by compositors who were, if not the same workmen at least of similar efficiency, it can only be assigned to a fundamental difference in the copies supplied them." Now without regard for whether the conclusions reached are correct or incorrect, the method used to reach them was only pseudo-bibliographical since it played about with speculations concerning printing but without a single piece of strictly bibliographical evidence to back up these speculations. "Assuming as we legitimately may that the texts were set up by compositors who were, if not the same workmen, at least of similar efficiency." This is not bibliographical evidence, at least not for a court of law. Why may we assume that if there was more than one workman the two were of equal efficiency? Presumably because they were both employed in Jaggard's shop. But on this logic we should be able to argue that the much maligned second-quarto compositors for Roberts' Hamlet were the equal of the workman who set up King Lear for Nicholas Okes since all were employed by reputable London printers. Moreover, it is noticeable that the evidence is begged whether there were one or two compositors for these plays under scrutiny and whether they were the same workmen. The spelling-evidence which enables us to distinguish the two Folio compositors was known at the time Wilson contrived this passage, but he did not avail himself of it to apply such tests to the plays about which he was writing. If he had, he would have found that whereas Hamlet was set up by the two alternating compositors customarily distinguished as A and B, Antony and Cleopatra was composed by B alone. Thus, at least at the start, no inferences can be made from a comparison of the texts of the two plays in toto, but rather only by comparing that part of Hamlet set by B with his Antony and Cleopatra text. Thereupon it would be necessary to test the faithfulness to copy of both A and B. This work has recently been started independently at the University of Virginia and by Dr. Alice Walker in this country. And in her new book on Problems of the First Folio, which I have seen in proof, Dr. Walker shows that B was a more careless workman than A and was more prone to error. It could be argued, therefore, that the Wilson hypothesis for faulty Hamlet copy is correct, since Antony and Cleopatra (set in its entirety by B) is in his opinion a superior text to Hamlet (in which the more conservatively faithful A participated). But in fact, one must query the whole basis for Wilson's assignment of error in both plays. Since no previous text is available, only manifest error can be detected in Antony and Cleopatra; and we have no means whatsoever for knowing when the compositor departed from copy but yet made sufficient sense so that we cannot detect his divergence. For Hamlet divergence can be only partially known and seldom (given our present state of information) with great certainty. Nonetheless, we do have some sources for determining corruption in the Folio Hamlet which are denied us in the Folio Antony . Thus if we had the full facts about Antony, which we shall never have, the incidence of error might, Wilson to the contrary, be at least as high as in Hamlet, or even higher. After all, what should we feel if the cases were truly parallel and the only known Hamlet text were that in the Folio? To argue about the error in two manuscripts, both lost, when the materials by which the two printed results may be surveyed are so unequal is, I feel, dangerous 'bibliography.' And since Wilson's initial assumptions about the equality of the compositors have been proved wrong by Dr. Walker, one may question whether his ever was a true bibliographical argument in the first place. When we consider the millions of words and the books piled on books that have been written about Shakespeare, it is astonishing to contemplate how little of a basic nature has been done to establish his text, and how much remains to do. One reason is that the bibliographical method for textual enquiry, which was developed first in this country by such great men as A. W. Pollard, R. B. McKerrow, and Sir Walter Greg, is still comparatively new. Another is that techniques are still being invented, or refined, to bring to bear this method, at its most powerful, to an analysis of the relation of the printing to Shakespeare's text. I turn now to a brief account of what I take to be some of the central problems and the methods that I anticipate will be applied to come to grips with them. It is a commonplace of textual criticism that no editor is equipped to tackle the details of his text until he has come to some general view about its nature. What we disapprove of most at the present day in 18th and 19th-century editions of Shakespeare is that the editors almost invariably picked and chose among variants with no fixed principle except their literary taste. This taste was often excellent but it did not save them from blunders, as in the example I have mentioned where up to half a dozen readings from the unauthoritative second quarto of Othello were commonly introduced as authentic recoveries of Shakespeare's own words, which they are not. This general view of a text consists, perhaps, of two major parts. When there is more than one text available, it is important to estimate the exact relationship between them; and this leads inevitably into an enquiry about the exact process by which they descended—whether by direct derivation or collaterally—from Shakespeare's own manuscript. In this investigation it is important to attempt some analysis of what were the effects of this transmission, including the work of scribes, compositors, and possible editors. When there is only one text available, as in the plays first printed in the Folio, this investigation is of course somewhat circumscribed, but nevertheless such evidence as there is must be evaluated as to what can be determined about the process of transmission and the nature of the manuscript underlying the printed version. Some parts of this investigation concern pure textual criticism, for McKerrow was correct, I believe, in disavowing as in any sense bibliographical the speculative enquiry which is necessary to achieve an hypothesis about the nature of a lost manuscript underlying a printed text and the history of its transmission up to the point that we can first read the text in print. But such speculations often need the checkrein of bibliographical logic if they are to escape manifest falseness. The case is indeed worth a narrower scrutiny, for a principle is present which reaches its fullest flower in the Hamlet problem. If the Folio text were indeed set from a manuscript, independent concurrence of Folio and quarto in any reading would powerfully argue for its correctness. In order to demonstrate the need for emending any such reading we should be forced to argue either that the error was present in some manuscript which lay behind both the manuscript for the quarto and that for the Folio prints, or else that the X-manuscript reading was correct but that both quarto compositor and Folio compositor, or else a scribe copying the manuscript which either used, in addition to the other compositor, independently produced the same misreading. Such cases are not unknown, but an editor must be very sure of his ground and have palaeographical evidence to boot, before he engages himself to alter such a reading. On the other hand, if the Folio directly derived from the quarto, though with conflation from some manuscript source, concurrence of the two texts in any reading is no serious argument for its correctness, since the reading may perhaps represent an error left uncorrected by the scribal preparer. In fact, it is a paradox of textual criticism, as Sir Walter Greg has pointed out, that when such a derivation of texts can be established, readings in which the two texts concur are much more likely to hide errors, and to be in greater need of emendation, than readings in which the two texts differ. Of course an editorial problem still resides in the variants, whatever the relationship of the texts, since the source for those in the Folio must still be hypothecated and the authority established. It does not do to take it as axiomatic that Folio variants, coming from an authoritative source, are thereby superior to the quarto in expressing Shakespeare's final intentions. The chain of transmission which may lie behind the manuscript used to correct the quarto could have been such as to afford opportunity for errors to creep in, these errors being faithfully copied by the scribe annotating the quarto. And by no means all such errors will be apparent errors. The majority are quite plausible readings. But the case may be even stronger. Dr. Williams has argued in an unpublished paper that by and large in Troilus and Cressida , where the same situation obtains, the manuscript behind the quarto was a Shakespeare fair copy somewhat revised in the process of copying from the original, and that the manuscript used to revise this quarto for the Folio printer's copy was Shakespeare's foul papers, or original draft. Thus if one accepts a Folio reading when it differs from that of the quarto, the odds are—it is argued—that one is rejecting a Shakespeare revision in favor of a Shakespeare first thought which he had modified. The case is a very interesting one and fortunately is in process of close examination. * When we turn to 2 Henry IV, some of the problems I have cited, such as hypotheses about the nature of the manuscripts which in one way or another must lie behind the quarto text, and the Folio at least in part, are not proper subjects for truly bibliographical enquiry. But in two particular respects bibliography can, I think, be of assistance. To date, the arguments on each side—one for the independent typesetting of the Folio from a manuscript, and the other for the use as copy of an annotated quarto—have rested very largely on textual evidence of a non-bibliographical cast. There is certainly some reason to hope that a minute bibliographical examination of the formal characteristics of both texts would establish the case for direct derivation, or—with more difficulty—by demonstrating the lack of sufficient evidence for a direct relationship, the probability that the Folio was indeed set from a new manuscript. Then once the exact relationship of the two texts was determined, the problem of the variants could be tackled from a narrow and partial yet a necessary point of view. I refer to a comparison of the variants with a classification of the known habits in departing from copy of which both compositors A and B, in somewhat different ways and degrees, were occasionally guilty. It is very likely that such a minute comparison would establish the strong probability that certain variant readings in the Folio did not emanate from the authoritative manuscript which had an effect on its text, but are instead unauthoritative compositor's errors which an editor should weed out of the text. The investigation of the problem of 2 Henry IV, I think it is obvious, is still only in its elementary stages; and any scholar who tackled it with the proper rigorous method and wide sweep of evidence would be kept happily occupied for a good long time. 2 Richard III is an example of a play in which the necessary analysis has reached an intermediate stage. The main points in its textual history are these. In the late nineteenth century the estimate was correctly made that the basic source for the Folio text was a copy of the sixth quarto of 1622. Much later two further important discoveries were made. It was effectively demonstrated that the source for the text of the first quarto (all later quartos being mere reprints) was not an authoritative manuscript with some direct transmissional link to Shakespeare's own, but instead a memorially contaminated text very likely derived from the actors reciting their parts as they remembered them in order to make up a new prompt book. It was furthermore discovered that the source for the numerous Folio alterations lay in a collation of Q6 against a new and authoritative manuscript of some sort in order to revise the faulty printed text. Finally it was found that not all the play had been so collated and revised, but that several hundred lines divided between a large patch in the opening of Act 3, scene 1, and another at the conclusion of the play, were printed unannotated in the Folio from leaves detached from a copy of the third edition. By ordinary standards these facts illuminating a most complex case would be taken as sufficient to guide an editor in the recovery of as much of the true text as we are ever likely to know—parts, of course, never can be recovered and we must rest content with corrupted lines of Shakespeare which we are powerless to restore. But an editor must make every endeavor to learn the how and the why of such a situation, for his estimate of this how and why may influence his treatment of the printed results. Thus it is most important for textual criticism to learn whether the manuscript used to correct the sixth quarto was a playhouse promptbook, as most critics have maintained, or else, as Alice Walker has recently argued, Shakespeare's own foul papers. Any editor will need to come to some decision on this question, for on the answer to it hinges in part his estimate as to the odds for relative purity or else for possible corruption in the Folio revisions. But before we pass to what bibliography can do, let me point out two implications which might be missed by an editor. If Alice Walker is right in her hypothesis (and I find it a very attractive one) that the quarto was not collated and annotated by Heminge and Condell or their agents to serve as printer's copy, but instead the patched manuscript was given to Jaggard to serve as his copy and for convenience he had the collation made in his printing-house so that his compositors could work largely from printed copy, it follows that if the work were done in the printing-house an editor could estimate the annotations as ingenuous transcripts from the manuscript without any possibility of sophistication from the memory of an actor-scribe such as has been argued for some other plays. Moreover, it follows that we must re-examine all other similar printer's copy, which we have automatically assumed was revised and annotated in the playhouse, for at least some of it may also have been collated instead by Jaggard, a fact that would give us a somewhat different view occasionally of the nature and authority of the variants. At the conclusion of her case for the nature of the manuscript and the history of the text, Dr. Walker makes a very significant bibliographical analysis to guide a future editor. The specific problems are: (1) how many of the Folio variants are authoritative and how many scribal or compositorial errors; (2) how many errors in the quarto text did the collating scribe fail to correct. Her use of evidence is very interesting. On the basis of the respective shares of compositors A and B in the unannotated section set from the third quarto, she evolves some statistics to assist an editor in estimating the proportion of Folio variants which may reasonably represent compositorial errors and not scribal corrections. She then attacks the problem of the failure of the scribe to correct. With absolute logic she offers the proposition that when Q6 by the history of its transmission from the first edition varied from this first edition, and when the scribe by reference to his manuscript restored the Q1 reading, this is unassailable proof that he had correctly transcribed an authoritative reading from his manuscript. This happened a certain number of times. On the other hand, when a reading in Q6 differed from that in Q1 by reason of its printed transmission and had been passed over by the scribe without revision, he had manifestly failed to copy the necessary correction from his manuscript, either of the Q1 or of a different reading. This happened a certain number of times. On the basis of these statistics Dr. Walker arrives at an estimate that about 140 non-Shakespearian readings are still present in the Folio text. At least in part, the method is bibliographical, and it needs only a fuller and more rigorous examination of the respective characteristics of compositors A and B, as derived from other plays which can act as a control, letting us see in completeness their wanderings from copy,—it needs only this fuller analysis to provide an editor with the maximum bibliographical knowledge he can obtain before starting his work. What I find very pleasant in Dr. Walker's concluding assertion that her findings should encourage an editor to emend more boldly than is usual, is the paradox that bibliography which will sometimes narrowly limit an editor's discretion to alter his text, in cases like this actually opens the door wide for all the resources of textual criticism. Certainly this added freedom which bibliography can sometimes afford an editor to be logically bold is exemplified with King Lear , and it is not too much to say that recent bibliographical work has quite upended the conventional editorial treatment of this text, and in some respects outmoded every available edition. Professor Duthie's admirable edition published a few years ago gave the text a much needed thorough analysis. He performed a signal service in disposing of the shorthand theory to explain the peculiarities of the first quarto, and in analyzing the work of the scribe who annotated this quarto by reference to a playhouse manuscript in order to furnish the Folio copy. When he came to attack the problem of the Folio variants in constructing his own text, Duthie felt confident that critical ability alone could distinguish in the main between the authority of quarto and Folio in cases of significant readings. But when he arrived at the problem of the relatively indifferent reading, he confessed that criticism was helpless and that he had no recourse but to prefer the Folio variant since it was present in a text of generally greater authority. Some hundreds of readings in which the choice seemed indifferent, therefore, were arbitrarily accepted from a single source. Now it is clear that in all cases of variation between quarto and Folio, either the preparer scribe or the compositor must be responsible, and it seems reasonable to assume that if the Folio readings are accepted in all such cases, in a certain percentage an editor is incorporating unauthoritative compositorial departures from copy. Whatever little authority any specific reading may have in the first quarto, with its contaminated text, the possibility that Shakespeare is being accurately reproduced is at least greater than that a compositorial error in the Folio is accidentally recovering the true reading. However, nothing could be done about this problem until a method was evolved to reach some evidence to assist an editor in separating compositorial variants from scribal corrections, especially for the large body of indifferent choices. A start has now been made on the problem by the method of compositorial analysis. It would not be surprising to find that in over a hundred cases an editor is justified in rejecting a commonly accepted Folio reading in favor of the quarto. For King Lear this is an almost revolutionary prospect, but I have no doubt that the method will be the correct one to follow, no matter how much more complicated it will make an editor's life in the future by immensely broadening the number of choices between variants which he must make. I am emphasizing the need for the minute study of the compositors who set Shakespeare texts because it is through these workmen that what Shakespeare wrote was set into type and printed in the texts now preserved to us. What these compositors did with the words they found in manuscript concerns us closely, for—cumulatively—it is not impossible that in thousands of small but eventually important ways these workmen have altered the exact reading of their copy. Therefore, the textual bibliographer is deeply interested in finding—for the First Folio—to give an example—precisely which pages and columns were typeset by which compositor, and how many workmen were in fact concerned in the composition of the First Folio text. Possibly there were also compositors C and D. The case is still uncertain. By an analytical examination of the evidence bearing on the presswork, we seek to learn what parts of the Folio were printed on one press and what parts on two presses. We want to recover any evidence as to whether a compositor was hurried or at leisure in composing certain pages; and the method by which the sheets went through the press can tell us much about this. Then we want to know every last thing there is to know about the habits of spelling, punctuation, and of faithfulness or carelessness in following copy for each compositor who worked on the book. This evidence can all be applied in one place or another to help remove the veil which the printing process places between us and the manuscript, and to help recover the at least relative purity of the manuscript reading. Let me illustrate with an example which is not concerned with an especially common problem but which I think is interesting. Some years ago I heard Professor G. B. Harrison deliver a paper on Coriolanus, in which he argued—very convincingly at the time, it seemed,—that the irregular lineation found in this Folio play represented a faithful following of Shakespeare's manuscript. And by showing the results which the rough lines had on vocal delivery as against the conventional smoothing out and regularizing of the lines into normal pentameter units, Harrison carried his audience along with him most successfully to accept his point of view that the irregularities were conscious with Shakespeare and represented a part of his dramatic and poetic art. Now, however, that we know something about the compositors, and learn from Dr. Walker that whereas A more often simply turned a long line under in the Folio, compositor B was just as likely to make two lines of it, it is clear that these days before we attempt to apply critical evidence as Professor Harrison did, we must be bibliographical and must break down the typesetting of the play and see where we stand. Thus since both A and B were concerned with Coriolanus , we shall need to distinguish their work and to see if there were any marked difference, such as we find in other plays, between the way the lines were split or were turned over in their respective sections. And only then, after this systematic bibliographical examination had been made and the characteristics of the text established as deriving from the manuscript or from the compositor in small or in large part, can we have a foundation of fact on which to base a critical discussion of the irregular lineation of Coriolanus . But the need to know everything there is to know about the characteristics of the Shakespearian compositors goes far beyond questions of verse-lining and into the very words that we read as Shakespeare's—we hope. For at present we can only hope in many cases of complex doubt—we do not yet have the bibliographical facts on which to base an opinion that is worth very much. There is another gap in our knowledge of the way in which the printing process may have corrupted the text we have commonly accepted. We have very curiously never made the collation of copies that is necessary to discover which pages of an early Shakespeare text were proofread and what were the changes that took place as a result of the proofreading. I do not know of any source where a student can go to find out the facts about proof-correctors' variants in most of the Shakespeare first quartos, which are often the highest authorities for our text: so far as I know the majority have never been fully collated. This I think is a shocking state of affairs. It means that editors have been content to take their text from any random copy that was most convenient for them, without curiosity as to whether they were reprinting compositors' errors or proof-readers' sophistications. When the text has been based on the Folio the case is no better. In sorrow I quote from the preface to the latest edition of King Lear: "It has recently been suggested that a study of all the extant copies of the First Folio would reveal variants comparable in importance with those in the extant copies of the First Quarto. As no evidence has yet been produced that the Folio is made up of corrected and uncorrected sheets, I am skeptical of this theory; but I have consulted facsimiles of two different copies of the Folio as well as the two originals accessible in Leeds, without discovering any variants." To be skeptical whether there are corrected and uncorrected formes in the First Folio is to be skeptical indeed, for in 1932 in the basic study of the printing of the First Folio Dr. Willoughby reprinted a facsimile of an actual proof-marked sheet in Antony and Cleopatra , and since then three further proof-sheets have been discovered by Professor Hinman in the Folio. This editor simply had bad luck in finding no variants in the four copies he collated, since I have been shown at least one sheet for Lear in which variants exist. Fortunately future editors can no longer remain in blissful ignorance of the facts about the Folio once Dr. Hinman finishes his collation of the seventy-nine First Folios in the Folger Shakespeare Library by means of his most ingenious mechanical collating machine, which reveals press-variants by super-imposing the images of the pages from two different copies. And while I do not myself expect that variants will be discovered which rank in importance with those in the First Quarto Lear, for the nature of the copy in the two printing houses was very different, nevertheless it would be surprising if the results did not increase our ability to ladle out the dross from the gold in various passages. Because no one, except for the New Variorum editors, has been willing to engage himself to the undoubted drudgery of collation, it is a paradox that we know more about the variable factors in the text of certain relatively minor Elizabethan playwrights like Field and Massinger than we know about Shakespeare's text. But collation of the authoritative texts is not all that is needed. It is true that usually there is no textual service to the discovery of variants in late and unauthoritative reprints of the basic texts. But I should like to point out one overlooked situation in which it is important for us to know if the text was indeed altered in any respect during the course of printing a late and unauthoritative edition. Let us take Richard III as our illustration, a play—it will be recalled—in which an example of the sixth quarto was conflated with a manuscript to serve as printer's copy for the Folio. When the Folio deviates from Q6, therefore, we may take it that in ordinary circumstances the different reading came from the manuscript. But I have already commented on the fact that not all such variants will have this authority, for it is positive that some will have been made by the Folio compositors. These, of course, should be thrown out in so far as we can develop the bibliographical means to enable a textual critic to isolate them. But even if we then disregard variants made by scribal blunder (which will not always be easy to detect), one further class may remain, even though only a handful of variants could be concerned. If the formes of Q6 were proofread while the sheets were being printed, we should have some variant readings in this edition. And if some of these variants were present in the particular example used by the scribe to prepare copy, and if he left some unaltered (as we know he left a number of errors unaltered that can be detected), we should have still more concealed errors masquerading as true manuscript readings of authority. I do not know for Richard III whether this situation exists, nor does anybody else, least of all any editor of Richard III, for no one has taken the trouble ever to collate a number of copies of Q6 to determine whether there are press-variant readings in this edition. Yet no bibliographical editor would dare to tackle the text without making this elementary study, even though he anticipated what he would doubtless find, purely negative or trivial results. It is time for me to summarize what the bibliographical method can still contribute to assist with establishing Shakespeare's text. First, it can re-survey every doubtful case, such as Hamlet, Othello, and 2 Henry IV in which there is still controversy whether the Folio text, which differs considerably from that of earlier quartos, was set directly from a manuscript, or else from a copy of some quarto edition which had been annotated by comparison with a manuscript or, as I believe for 2 Henry IV, had been used as the basis for a manuscript which served as Folio copy. This is not an academic question, for the principle of one's whole treatment of the text rests on the answer to the central problem: what exactly was the nature of the Folio printer's copy. Secondly, by means of the necessary collation and the interpretation of the variants made in printed texts while they were going through the press, the bibliographical method can discover and classify these proofreaders' alterations with a view to recovering the true Shakespearian readings, or at least to distinguishing the certainly non-Shakespearian. Thirdly, since the bibliographical method is concerned with the effect of the printing process on Shakespeare's text, it can make searching analytical studies of the relationship between the compositors (those intermediaries by which the text was transmitted to us) and the actual printing. Analytical bibliography can still find material to work on in Shakespeare by investigating the speed of presswork which, if suddenly accelerated, might affect the accuracy of the compositor hurrying to keep up with the press. A combination of analytical and textual bibliography, moreover, is necessary to distinguish in every Shakespeare text the number of compositors engaged on it and the exact sections for which each set the type. Then, by a series of extremely rigorous studies, the characteristics of these compositors must be analyzed in other printed texts where proper comparisons may be made; and finally everything that we know about the care or the negligence with which they treated what they were typesetting, including what we can learn of their characteristic habits of altering text, must be applied to their work in the Shakespeare canon. Only when all this mass of investigation is done, perhaps years hence, can we say that we have honestly and thoroughly squeezed every last drop out of the possible evidence for deciding in every minute detail, as close as we can come to it, what Shakespeare actually wrote. I do not assert that this bibliographical approach can displace the critical approach, for the two methods must work hand in hand supplementing each other. But I do argue that as scholars we have been most delinquent in failing to utilize the bibliographical method to its fullest extent and in preferring the easier delights of armchair critical speculation to the rigors of first ascertaining the fullest body of facts by bibliographical investigation. Only when all the facts are known can we proceed to the necessary critical synthesis which will make of our attempt to recover the maximum of what Shakespeare truly wrote more than a thing of shreds and patches tailored according to our personal preferences.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * A public lecture delivered at Bedford College, University of London, on 4 March 1953, Professor Una Ellis-Fermor in the chair. * As this goes to press I have seen the typescript of an article by Dr. Philip Williams for the October 1953 issue of Shakespeare Quarterly in which he argues that the copy for the Folio text of King Lear was not an annotated quarto, as we have supposed for years, but instead a manuscript which utilized the quarto. From his review of Alice Walker's Textual Problems of the First Folio, in the same issue, it is evident that he now has altered his original views, as stated below, that the Folio Troilus and Cressida was printed directly from its annotated quarto and inclines to the belief that it also was printed from an intermediate transcript which preserved certain characteristics of the quarto. 1 As I understand that Professor Dover Wilson has now become philosophical about disagreements with his work, I hope he will forgive me the discourtesy if I choose my examples from his study of the text of Hamlet . If I disagree in details, or in the method by which certain results were arrived at, I do not wish to imply any lack of respect for the monograph as a whole. It was a splendid pioneering effort and though it will need to be redone in the future, we shall have to know a great deal more than we know now before the task can even be attempted. * Dr. Williams may perhaps revise this view in the light of his most recent researches. The general principle here remains the same, however. 2 I do not pretend to have made a rigorous examination, since the 'good long time' has as yet been denied me. But I may say that in the process of a preliminary collation of Q and F to familiarize myself with the problem, I have come upon the mechanical evidence of which I speak, and which in my opinion demonstrates beyond the shadow of a doubt, especially when joined to Dr. Walker's copious evidence of a somewhat different sort, that in some manner printed Q lies in a direct line behind the F text. Whether F was set direct from annotated Q, as Dr. Walker holds, or whether there was some intermediate step as I believe at the moment, still awaits further investigation.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Servius of Cassel for Aeneid III-V by Arthur Frederick Stocker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a previous volume of these Studies 1 it has been shown that there exists for the text of Servius Danielis on Aeneid III-V not only the one manuscript source ( F ) upon which Thilo placed virtually his sole reliance but also another ( G ) which, though curiously intermittent as a witness, nevertheless gives within its own limits a measure of independent testimony. The purpose of this paper 2 is to establish the value of a third manuscript for Aeneid III-V, codex Cassellanus ms. poet. fol. 6 ( C ), a fine manuscript of the mid-ninth century 3 of which Thilo took some cognizance but in the appraisal of which 4 he was partly blinded by an outmoded view of Servius Danielis as Servius plus miscellaneous interpolations. The Cassellanus consists, in its present form, of 109 parchment folia. Savage states that it was composed originally of 23 quaternions, of which eight and some miscellaneous leaves are now missing. It begins with Servius Danielis on Aeneid I 1, and ends with the words numquam aliquis deorum simul colitur in a note which is common to Servius Danielis and the vulgate Servius on Aeneid VI 830. 5 Within Aeneid I-II the Cassellanus is the principal manuscript for Servius Danielis. Thilo 6 and Savage 7 equate it with the basic codex Fuldensis, of which Daniel states in his Praefatio 8 that he received a collation just as his edition was going to press, too late for him to do more than publish the collation as an appendix keyed to the text which he had already constituted from other sources. So confident was Thilo in this equation that he employed the siglum C indiscriminately to designate readings taken either from the Cassellanus itself or from Daniel's appendix, to which recourse was and still is necessary for passages presumably once found in the now lost quaternions of the Cassellanus. The identity of these two texts has lately been challenged by Elder, 9 but surely the similarity between them was uncommonly close. For Aeneid III and following, however, the Cassellanus presents an entirely different and somewhat ambiguous aspect. It is almost completely devoid of the long passages foreign to the vulgate that most strikingly characterize Servius Danielis as represented by F G , and has superficially the appearance of a vulgate text. In notes that are substantially common to the two traditions, however, it manifests most of the textual peculiarities of Servius Danielis. The situation will become clearer with a review of the essential nature of Servius Danielis. Following upon the studies of Barwick 10 and Rand, 11 there is general agreement with the proposition that Servius Danielis represents a fusion of the genuine commentary of Servius on Vergil, as embodied in well over a hundred extant manuscripts, with some other single ancient commentary, probably older than Servius' and in certain respects more valuable. Servius', however, as the more widely known and respected, became the dominant partner in this merger of texts and served as the basis for the contaminatio which resulted. The other (which we may call the D) commentary the compiler used as a mine of interesting and clearly ancient material with which Servius' might be enriched. Some of this was entirely extraneous to Servius, keyed to lemmata about which Servius had nothing to say. This could readily be introduced, with a new lemma, where the sequence of words in Vergil entitled it to a place. Some took the form of additional comment on words or phrases already discussed by Servius. Material of this sort is loosely and often inelegantly grafted upon the Servian note, sometimes without so much as an effort to adjust conjunctions and transitional expressions to their new context. In a few cases the compiler appears to have found parallel exegesis in the two commentaries, with D offering a more expanded form of the same note that is found in Servius. 12 It is possible that D may have been Servius' direct source for these notes. In view, however, of the penchant of ancient scholiasts and encyclopaedists for mechanically transcribing the words of their sources, it is perhaps more likely that both D and Servius were drawing upon the same original. Where the compiler found notes that were parallel in this way, it was of course natural for him to adopt the fuller form. Finally, for considerably more than half of his notes, the compiler seems to have been quite satisfied with what he found in Servius. At any rate, whether because he discovered no new material in the D commentary or because he chose to reject it, he simply adopted the Servius as he found it in his Servius text. Against this background, the character of the Cassellanus emerges more plainly. In Aeneid III ff., it consistently lacks the more extensive additions made by Servius Danielis to the vulgate text, not only those notes which are new in their entirety, as, for example, the note on TRISTE PER AVGVRIVM ( Aen. V 7; Th. 589, 5-17), but also the supplements to notes occurring in Servius, for example, to the one on DARDANIVM ACESTEN ( Aen. V 30; Th. 593, 3-20). When the Danieline additions are of shorter extent, however, they sometimes appear in the Cassellanus, e.g., A. III 251 (Th. 386, 11) ne possint a se dicta contemni] Serv. ne possint (posint F ) a se dicta quasi ab irata conficta contemni (contempni F G ) F G C A. III 361 (Th. 406, 24-26) aves aut oscines sunt aut praepetes; oscines ore futura praedicunt, praepetes volatu significant] Serv. aves autem aut oscines (obscines P ) sunt aut praepetes, oscines quae ore futura praedicunt, praepetes quae volatu augurium significant cum sunt prospera (cum sunt prospera om. C ) F P C A. III 699 (Th. 455, 20-21) PROIECTA (proiectaque G ) porrecta (prorecta F proiecta G ), extenta, ut proiecto dum pede laevo] F G C non habet Servius . A. III 705 (Th. 457, 1-2) PALMOSA SELINVS civitas iuxta Lilybaeum, abundans palmis et apio] Serv. PALMOSA SELINVS (selinis F selynis P C ) civitas est iuxta Lilybaeum (lybeum F libeum P lilybacum C ), abundans palmis quibus vescuntur et apio (palmis vel ab equis nobilibus P ) F P C and when the manuscripts of Servius Danielis exhibit textual idiosyncrasies embedded within notes that are common to the two traditions, the Cassellanus oftener than not shares them. The following instances are typical of many: A. III 305 (Th. 395, 28) quia] Serv. nam F G P C A. III 621 (Th. 445, 19) et mire] Serv. bene rem F C A.

V 233 (Th. 614, 22) esse] Serv. est et F G C A. V 823 (Th. 652, 2) vitam] Serv. animam F G C On the other hand, the reverse situation (with the Cassellanus on the side of vulgate Servius) also occurs, e.g., A. III 571 (Th. 439, 3) aquarum odor] Serv. C odor aquarum F G A. III 572 (Th. 439, 14) et est poetica descriptio] Serv. et est poetica discribtio C sane tota hec poetica discriptio F A. V 135 (Th. 610, 4) numquam tectum] Serv. C quod numquam tege ( pro tegi?) solet F G and on occasion the text of the Cassellanus appears to be eclectic, as on Aeneid III 297: Servius Danielis PATRIO MARITO atqui Thebana fuit, de Thebis Phrygiis. sed aut provinciam pro patria posuit—et (aut F ) probamus pro patria—ut Sallustius, etc. Vulgate Servius PATRIO MARITO atqui Thebana fuit. sed aut provinciam pro patria posuit, ut (I 380) Italiam quaero provinciam , item Sallustius, etc. Cassellanus PATRIO MARITO atqui Thebana fuit. aut probamus pro patria, ut Salustius, etc. In this passage, it will be observed, the Cassellanus lacks the Danieline de Thebis Phrygiis and also (perhaps by a kind of homoeoarchy) the sed aut provinciam pro patria posuit which is common to the two traditions. But it concludes with Servius Danielis, aut probamus pro patria, ut Salustius . Analysis shows that the text of Servius which the compiler used in constructing Servius Danielis did not belong to any one of the three families of Servius manuscripts distinguished by the Harvard editors. Servius Danielis, therefore, adumbrates a fourth variety of vulgate text, and an attractive hypothesis suggested by the suddenly reduced state of the Cassellanus in Aeneid III ff. is that it may represent the compiler's Servius, in which case the Danieline symptoms which it betrays would derive neither from the D commentary nor from any activity on the part of the compiler but rather from an otherwise now extinct form of Servius text which the compiler used. If this could be established, the Cassellanus would assume substantial importance in what must at best be a doubtful reconstruction of the lost D commentary. The weight of probability is indeed on the side of the view 13 that some, at least, of the discrepancies between Servius Danielis and the extant vulgate do stem from the compiler's Servius. That the Cassellanus affords any clue to their identity, however, is by no means clear, and on the contrary becomes exceedingly dubious in the face of clear indications 14 that the Cassellanus, for Aeneid III ff. as well as for the books that precede, descends from a source which once embodied the full Servius Danielis and out of which the D supplements were systematically, if not entirely effectively, filtered. On Aeneid III 244, for example, where Vergil says of the harpies, celerique fuga sub sidera lapsae semesam praedam et vestigia foeda relinquunt, Servius, elucidating vestigia , explains briefly: pedum signa . Servius Danielis subjoins an alternative: vel pedum signa vel indicium sordium quibus epulas discedentes polluebant . The Cassellanus, in its customary fashion, fails to show the Danieline addition, but offers the text, VESTIGIA vel pedum signa . In the restricted context, the vel becomes utterly otiose and finds its readiest explanation in the hypothesis that somewhere in the Cassellanus' line of descent the vel indicium sordium quibus epulas discedentes polluebant was marked for deletion, probably by someone whose purpose it was to purge the text of its D elements, but the vel before pedum was overlooked. A similar situation recurs a few lines later, at Aeneid III 249, where the two traditions diverge as follows: Servius Danielis PATRIO REGNO aut Neptunio aut, sicut alii dicunt, quia Thaumas, pater earum ex Electra, Ponti et Terrae filius fuit. Vulgate Servius PATRIO REGNO Neptunio. The Cassellanus reads PATRIO REGNO ait Neptunio , omitting all that follows Neptunio in Servius Danielis. As the note on PATRIO REGNO , ait Neptunio is nonsense, and would seem to represent a clumsy emendation of an intermediate aut Neptunio , in which the aut , like the vel above, became impossible after the loss of Daniel's aut sicut alii dicunt . . . fuit . One more example may suffice. At Aeneid III 310, Vergil makes Andromache inquire of the unexpectedly appearing Aeneas: verane te facies, verus mihi nuntius adfers? Servius comments: et secundum muliebrem adfectum interrogat et bene suspicatur; nam et inferis sacrificat et in luco, in quo habitant manes . Servius Danielis carries the same note, with the addition of sicut supra dictum est after muliebrem adfectum , the allusion being to a foregoing observation found only in Servius Danielis: et opportunum principium feminae quam incertam timor fecerat . The Cassellanus, as might have been expected, omits the et opportunum principium feminae quam incertam timor fecerat , but retains the sicut supra dictum est which refers to it—a further instance of apparent oversight on the part of one whose efforts were directed toward excluding the D from Servius Danielis. From these examples, which could be multiplied, it is apparent that the Cassellanus for Aeneid III ff. constitutes not a fourth form of the vulgate Servius but a mutilated specimen of Servius Danielis. Why this mutilation came about only in Aeneid III ff., while Aeneid I-II escaped, is a matter of conjecture. Perhaps, as has been suggested, 15 archetypal Servius Danielis was in several volumes, with a break between Aeneid II and Aeneid III. Perhaps the answer may be found in the mechanics of the filter process, as, for example, if the D supplements were marked in an ancestor of the Cassellanus (call it an Ur- C ) with symbols which the copyist in Aeneid I-II either overlooked, did not understand, or had not been instructed to observe. Whatever may be the explanation, the conclusion is plain, that the existing Cassellanus represents a text that is in its essence Danieline throughout, and that, while for Aeneid III ff. the notes parallel in extent those of the vulgate Servius, the residual text is of the character of Servius Danielis. That there are a significant number of instances in which the Cassellanus reads with the vulgate against Servius Danielis has already been remarked. A few of these are of considerable extent, as, for example, at Aeneid V 241, where the two traditions diverge as follows, and the Cassellanus reads wholly with Servius: Servius Danielis indignata Iuno quod ex pellice sua Semele natus Liber pater ab Ino matertera eius esset nutritus, Athamanti viro eius, regi Thebanorum sive, ut quidam volunt, Orchomeniorum, furorem inmisit, qui cum occiso Learcho filio, dum eum feram credit, Melicertam alterum filium cum Ino uxore sua persequeretur . . . Vulgate Servius Athamas post furorem a Iunone inissum cum, occiso Learcho, Melicertam alterum filium cum uxore sua persequeretur . . . and at Aeneid III 351, where the Cassellanus reads with Servius except for the omission of ut in the third line: Servius Danielis AGNOSCO aut cognomine agnosco —nam ea cognoscimus quae iam pridem videmus—aut certe quia reparatam audierat Troiam. Vulgate Servius AGNOSCO aut cognomine agnosco aut certe quia reparatam audierat Troiam, ut (A. III 294) hic incredibilis rerum fama occupat aures. In order, however, to eliminate the D from Ur- C , it was necessary to subject that text to rather careful collation with the text of some Servius manuscript. While it was undoubtedly the additions from D for which the collator was particularly on the watch, it would not have been at all unnatural, since his whole activity was predicated on the assumption of the superiority of the vulgate Servius to Servius Danielis, for him occasionally to have noted—marginally or interlinearly—variants or larger discrepancies on which his eye might have happened to light. Such instances, therefore, need not undermine our belief in the Cassellanus as fundamentally a Danieline text. If the Cassellanus disappoints us in one hope, however, it at least partially fulfills another. As has been shown in my former article, 16 there is only one complete manuscript of Servius Danielis for Aeneid III-V, Thilo's F , and, while G seems not to have been copied from it, its relationship to F is so close that the two together comprise an exceedingly narrow base for the text. A Paris manuscript (B. N. Lat. 1750) 17 serves as a check upon F-G in the passages which it contains, but, since its text is very much abridged, its testimony is often lacking. The Cassellanus, its authority as a manuscript of Servius Danielis vindicated, considerably extends the area in which a check is available upon the vagaries of F-G , and, although not, unfortunately, in the long added notes from D on which help is particularly needed, enables the editor to dismiss some of their divergences from the vulgate Servius as the discrepancies of a single manuscript line rather than of the tradition of Servius Danielis. The writer would lay down the following principles to govern the use of the Cassellanus: a. When the Cassellanus supports F-G in a one-word variant, an inversion of word order, or the omission of an unessential word, the reading receives strong confirmation as authentic Servius Danielis. b. The shorter additions of F-G which occur in the Cassellanus are probably Danieline and were overlooked by the collator when he was endeavoring to "purge" the Ur- C . Cassellanus readings, therefore, merit almost if not quite the respect accorded to the readings of F-G . c. When the Cassellanus attests short bits of text that do not occur in F-G but are found in the vulgate, they probably belong to the tradition of Servius Danielis. Since the purge was not rigorous enough to eliminate the shorter additions of Servius Danielis which were found in the Ur- C , it is unlikely that the collation was performed with sufficient care to result in the supplying from Servius of omissions in the Ur- C of the same extent. d. In the comparatively few cases where the text of the Cassellanus diverges sharply from that of F-G or is substantially more extensive, the probability is that it is not Danieline but that it was introduced into the Ur- C from the text of Servius with which it was being collated.</field>

Stocker, "A Possible New Source for Servius Danielis on Aeneid III-V," Studies in Bibliography , IV (1951), 129-141. 2 The conclusions of this paper, like those of its predecessor, are based on a new study by the author of the text particularly for Aeneid III and Aeneid V, from photographs of all the important manuscripts. Photographs for Aeneid IV were inaccessible, being in the possession of Professor Albert H. Travis, of the University of California at Los Angeles, who is collaborating with the author and others in the preparation of Volume III of the "Harvard Servius ," soon to appear. The author has examined the text for Aeneid IV, however, carefully enough to satisfy himself that his conclusions would be valid for that book as well. 3 Written about 840 A.

From the work of an intelligent compiler, blending material from D and material from Servius into a new note of his own composition, such a product might be expected to emerge that Servius' shorter note would look like an abridgment of it. The evidence indicates, however, that the compiler was mechanical in his methods and not given to original composition. Otherwise he would certainly have improved the junctures and transitions, the awkwardness of which has been mentioned. The supposition of ancient relationship between the longer note in Servius Danielis and the shorter one in the vulgate Servius seems, therefore, the more probable. 13 Cf. Thilo, op. cit., praef.

      <field name="fulltext">In the Spring of 1952, the Pierpont Morgan Library acquired the only known copy of a previously undescribed English incunable. Such an event, especially in the case of a work of literary interest written in the vernacular, is not one of routine occurrence; it has consequently been thought proper that this new "find" be given a somewhat more extensive discussion than the familiar "previously unknown" incunabulum normally deserves. The results, it is believed, will not only fix the approximate date and the proper order in which the several editions appeared, but will also indicate to bibliographers the value of textual study in the solution of bibliographical problems. In the form advocated by the present writer ( Standards of Bibliographical Description , 1949, pp. 3-60), the new incunable may be described in these terms: The Abbey of the Holy Ghost. Westminster: Wynkyn de Worde, [1496]. Apparently the first edition. 4°. 20 leaves. a-b 6 c-d 4 . 28-29 lines. Type-page (f. 4, 28 lines): 132 x 87 mm. Type: 4:95G. Woodcut initial (I) on a2. Two woodcuts (Hodnett 313 on title; Hodnett 325 on al v ). f.

Amen. || a Enpryntyd at Westmestre by || Wynkyn the Worde. || Signature c4 is missigned c iij, and d4 is missigned d iij. Only c1 v , d2 v and d3 have 29 lines. Hodnett does not explain that the cut on the title (his no. 313) is a pictorial representation of the Allegory of the Four Daughters of God. The only recorded copy is in the Pierpont Morgan Library ( Check List , no. 1816A). It measures 193 x 138 mm. and is stitched in the remains of the contemporary half-vellum binding. Obtained by the Library in March, 1952 (Accession no. 43328). Two other fifteenth-century editions of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost have long been known and are described by E. Gordon Duff 1 under his numbers 1 and 2. I have been able to consult the edition identified as Duff 1 by using the facsimile prepared from the copy in the University Library Cambridge by Francis Jenkinson (published by the Cambridge University Press in 1907), while the Folger Library has kindly supplied me with a microfilm of their copy of the remaining edition (Duff 2). With a view towards determining the order and approximate date of the editions, it will be necessary to subject these not only to a strict bibliographical scrutiny but to a thorough textual examination as well. We may best begin by considering the physical "make-up" of the editions which, for the sake of convenience, will hereafter be cited as C (Cambridge), F (Folger) and M (Morgan). As we may see from the description given above, M was printed with only one column to the page while the other two editions were each set up with double columns. One fount of type only (Wynkyn de Worde no. 4) was used in the printing of M, whereas two different sizes of type are found in both other editions (types 2 and 4 in C; types 4 and 6 in F). Furthermore, C and F have a constant number of lines (29) to the page; M usually has 28 though thrice 29 lines were needed to accommodate the text. Similarly, on signature a4 verso of M, de Worde miscalculated the amount of text he could crowd onto a page and was obliged to set a portion of the word "ravisheth" in the position normally occupied by a catchword; thus, by printing "ra||uyssheth||", he was able to get all the text on that page. Again, while c4 and d4 are missigned in M as noted in the above description, there are no errors in the signing of the other editions. Finally, the text of M ends on the verso of the last leaf, whereas in both other editions the narrative concludes on the recto and is followed in each case by a printer's device. All these points suggest that M is the most primitive (and consequently the earliest) of the three editions. The evidence of the woodcuts, while inconclusive, at least confirms the belief that C was printed before F. The woodcut of the Crucifixion (Hodnett 374) 2 has suffered greater material damage at the top of the block in F than in C; in addition, the Folger copy shows the loss of a border-line at the top and another at the bottom of this cut. If we now turn to the textual examination, it is clear that six different arrangements for the successive order of appearance of the editions are possible. Two series (C → M → F and F → M → C) can be eliminated immediately, both for typographical and for textual reasons. Since C and F were each printed with double columns and always agree page-for-page (and mostly line-for-line), it is self-evident that the one was set from the other with no single-column edition intervening. The text too corroborates this theory, as one example will suffice to indicate. In line 4 of sig. c4 v , M has the text "þ t were callid Merci &amp; Pyte," while both C and F omit the word "callid". Now one will find it difficult, probably impossible, to believe that the second compositor could supply a needed word which in a third printing was then again omitted, thus accidentally duplicating the reading of the editio princeps. Yet one would be obliged to accept this coincidence if the order of appearance was either of those given above. No; one can only conclude, on the basis of reasonable probability, either that C was set from F or that the contrary took place. The next two possibilities (C → F → M and M → F → C) are equally unacceptable, for C and M often have the identical text from which F alone departs. For example, in M (b1, line 4) one reads: "For no man I trowe myght al fully it fele"; with this C completely agrees. In F (a6 v , β, 17-18), however, we find: "for I trowe þ t no man myght all fully it fele". To cite another example, M (a6 v , lines 14-19) prints the following: Our lorde Jhū Cryste sendyth them the oyle of comforte &amp; of mercy that gyueth the lyghte of &amp; shewyth his heuenly preuytees þ t he hydeth fro men that ben full of flesshly lustes. While C offers this same text, F (a6 v , α, 16), sensing an omission, alone supplies the word "understanding", giving the reading "lyght of vnderstandynge". That M and C are textually related—and that the one was set from the other—is convincingly demonstrated (if further proof be needed) by a curious slip common to both; this does not occur in F. On b6 v , lines 2-5, M reads: Therfore he was take &amp; put in to the pryson of hell. &amp; there hathe be now. M. yere &amp;. vi. C &amp; more. &amp; that is grete pyte. With this reading C agrees, while F, in accordance with tradition, correctly asserts that, before the coming of Christ, Adam had languished in Hell 4,600 and more years ("and there hath be now .iiij. M. yere and .vi. C. and more"). Thus, if we assume that F intervenes between C and M, we must believe that the error in time was corrected for the Folger text only to have the third edition, by sheer coincidence, make the identical error found in the first printing. 3 The points here made surely eliminate these two possibilities. We thus arrive at the last two alternatives. 4 The series F → C → M seems improbable for typographical reasons. The state of the woodcuts assures us that F is the latest of the three, and the typographical "set-up" of M is certainly more primitive than the sophisticated press-work of the other two editions. Textually too, this is unlikely, for M and C exhibit older dialectal and orthographic variants ("her", "syndre", and the habitual use of "wol") where F offers the more modern forms ("theyr", "sondry", and usually wyl"). 5 By this process of elimination we arrive at the conclusion that the order M → C → F is the only possible one for the appearance of the three editions of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost . Furthermore, there are an adequate number of pieces of evidence to support this contention. In illustration of this, the text in M (d3, lines 11-14) may be cited: Whan they wolde haue naylyd his fete to the crosse: all his body was so shronke vp togyd) for payne þ t it was to shorte to þ e hole þ t they had made by a large fote. The term "too short to the hole" had been used a few lines earlier in very similar circumstances; in that case, all three editions employed this same phrase. In the instance previously cited, however, both C and F substitute (d2 v , β, 3) "to sort for þ e hole", an apparent modernization introduced by the later printings. The gradual deterioration of the text (M → C → F) is amply demonstrated by one enlightening example. 6 In M (a6, lines 15-19) one reads: Medytacyon is thoughte in god / of his werkes: of his wordes / &amp; of his creatures / &amp; of his paynes that he suffryd. &amp; of his loue þ t he louyd vs wyth / For ofte a good thoughte is better than many indeuowte prayers. This appears in C (a6, α, 17-24), where the omission is clearly due to haplography, as: 7 Medytacōn is thought in god / of his werkes / of his wordes / &amp; of his creatures / &amp; of his paynes þ t he loued vs with. For oft a good thought is better than many Indeuowte prayers. The compositor of F, sensing a corruption of text, set about "correcting" it, and with this in mind he substituted "losyd" for "loued" (loved). In the special Biblical sense of "to loose" (NED vb. I c ) this emendation gave meaning to the passage though it did not result in a return to the original sense. The explanation for the texts of C and F can only be made evident by assuming the priority of M. Surely it is clear, from this lengthy analysis, that the newly discovered copy of the Abbey now in the Morgan Library belongs to the earliest known printed edition of this text. A fortunate set of circumstances makes it possible to supply a likely date for the several editions of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost . As we have seen, the Morgan copy of the Abbey was printed in a single column with de Worde's type 4; Duff I was set up in two columns with types 2 and 4; and Duff 2 was issued with double columns using types 4 and 6. Now the first edition of Bishop John Alcock's Mons perfectionis (Duff 12) was also printed in one column with de Worde's type 4, while the second edition (Duff 13) has double columns with types 2 and 4; a third edition was issued by de Worde after he had left Westminster (STC 281). Are we not justified in assuming that the Abbey and the Mons perfectionis , being similar tracts of devotional literature, were issued as companion pieces and that they were designed to be sold either separately or together? 8 Since the first edition of the Mons perfectionis has the printed date 22 September 1496, and the second bears the date 23 May 1497, it is with some confidence that one may assert that the first two editions of the Abbey were also produced, respectively, in September 1496 and May 1497. The third edition of the Mons perfectionis presents an added complication in that it was printed after 1500, at a time when Wynkyn de Worde had left Westminster and had moved to "the City." According to Sayle (no. 144), 9 the volume states that it was printed in London "and fynysshed the xxvii. daye of þ e moneth of Maye" 1501. We may well suppose that this book was intended to go on sale together with the third edition of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost; consequently it is likely that little time had elapsed between the printing of these two volumes. On the basis of this reasoning, there is some justification for believing that the third Abbey (Duff 2) may well have been the last book printed by Wynkyn de Worde at Westminster, just as the third Mons perfectionis is judged to be the first one issued by his new press in London; in any case, no earlier book with a London imprint has yet been discovered. 10 This discussion, then, offers what seems to be fairly conclusive evidence in support of the contention that the Morgan copy of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost belongs to the first printed edition of this work (at least, of those that are now known to us) and that this work was probably printed by Wynkyn de Worde not much later than 22 September 1496. In concluding this somewhat lengthy account, one further observation may be made. If Duff's bibliography (or if the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke ) should ever be reprinted, the present edition of the Abbey will head the list of entries as the very first number, with the Morgan copy cited as the only known example.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Fifteenth Century English Books (Bibliographical Society, Illustrated Monograph no. XVIII, 1917). 2 Edward Hodnett, English Woodcuts 1480-1535 (Bibliographical Society, Illustrated Monograph no. XXII, 1935). No certain conclusions can be drawn from the impressions of the cut of the Trinity (Hodnett 313), the only cut common to all three. Hodnett also notes that the block of no. 374 had suffered a diagonal crack through the entire length of the block by the time it was used for Duff 2. This cut also appears in the three editions of Alcock's Mons perfectionis , which will be discussed below. 3 A similar instance can be cited from a quotation from Isaiah (64.1). In M (b5 v , line 15), the citation incorrectly reads: "Vtina m diru m pera m celos et descenderes." With this C agrees while F more correctly has: "Vtina m disru m peres celos et descenderes" (b5, β, 20-21). If F intervenes between M and C, it is difficult to account for these two editions having the same mistake ("dirumperam" for the Biblical "dirumperes"). 4 It is, of course, mathematically possible (if unlikely from a logical point of view) that one edition might have served as the original for the other two, independently composed. This line of argument too can be dismissed for these reasons: C and F could not have been set up independently from M because their identical "make-up" shows obvious dependence of the one upon the other; M and C could not have been separately produced from F since they are textually related; and, finally, M cannot have been set up from C for reasons we shall now set forth in the text. 5 M contains certain anachronisms in orthography which can best be accounted for by assuming that it was composed from a much earlier manuscript. Thus M (b2, line 9) has "pine of hell" where both other editions print "payne". In the inflectional endings too, M often has "-is", "-yth", and "-yd" where the other editions have the more modern forms "-es", "-eth", and "-ed". 6 A quotation from the Bible ("Vae misero mihi!"—Jeremiah 45.3) undergoes strange mutations. In M one finds "Ve michi mis er o"; in C, "Ve michi misere"; and in F, "Ve michi miseri"!! 7 While both M and C here have "indeuowte", F (a6, α, 23) prints "vndeuowte". This is a further indication that F cannot intervene between M and C. 8 That Wynkyn de Worde followed this practice in other cases seems certain from his Treatise of Love (Duff 399), most copies of which are still bound together with the Chastising of God's Children (Duff 85). It is also known that Richard Pynson too issued some of his books in series of this sort; compare the present writer's "Notes on a Pynson Volume," Library , 4th ser., XVIII (1937-38), 261-267. 9 Charles E. Sayle, Early English Printed Books in the University Library, Cambridge (1900-07), I, 37. 10 "At the end of the year 1500, De Worde moved from Westminster into Fleet Street at the sign of the Sun, the earliest book from the new address being dated May, 1501."

      <field name="heading_text">The Editions of Robert Greene's A Quip for an Upstart Courtier (1592) by Edwin Haviland Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After R. B. McKerrow, in 1906, published the results of his examination of Robert Greene's quarto, A Quip for an Upstart Courtier (1592), it was generally accepted that only two editions of the tract appeared in the year of publication: one (collating A-H 4 ) with the attack on the Harveys, an 'issue' with the cancel of this passage, and other copies in which the collation reads A-F 4 . 1 An examination of all extant copies of the 1592 edition, however, reveals that at least six editions appeared in that year. Copies in the Westminster Abbey Library, the Harvard University Library, the Huntington Library, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and the collection of Dr. A. S. Rosenbach were found to be separate editions. Thus Greene's intemperate criticism of Gabriel Harvey and his two brothers, John and Richard, not only precipitated the vitriolic Harvey-Nashe controversy, which continued for at least the next four years, but also created a great demand for the Quip , which the printer had to meet by rushing editions through the presses. Since, beginning with the second edition, the collation remains the same, and all copies are paginary reprints, occasionally with the transfer of formes from one edition to another, the tract presents difficult bibliographical problems, especially as to order of printing. However, through scrutiny of variant readings and through a line-by-line examination of type it is possible, I believe, to establish a plausible order. The collations of the editions of the Quip examined are as follows: Q1 a A | QVIP FOR AN VP-|ſtart Courtier: | Or, | A quaint diſpute betvveen Veluet breeches | and Cloth-breeches. | Wherein is plainely ſet downe the diſorders | in all Eſtates and Trades . | [woodcut: a courtier and a country gentleman in a rural setting (6.9 x 7.7 cm.)] | LONDON | Imprinted by Iohn Wolfe, and are to bee ſold at his | ſhop at Poules chayne. 1592.

Because the catch-words in Q2-Q6 are important in determining the number of editions of this tract, and because the differences are often minute, for ease of identification of editions I have listed all significant changes in the table below. (When, because of cropping, I cannot cite catch-words in Q2, I have used question marks.)

Thus in Q1 b the last two leaves of E signature were reset, 6 and the lengthy side-note on sig. E4 of Q1 a threatening Richard Harvey with ridicule in the theater eliminated. The rest of Q1 b has the typesettings of Q1 a . In sheet F, however, two alterations were made. On sig. F1, a seventeen-line side-note was added (because of cropping I have had to reconstruct the reading in part): Wel sho[uld] | the lords [of] | the Coun[cil] | do to loo[ke] | to those b[ase] | knaue s[hoo-] | makers t[oo, who] | ioyne wi[th] | coosenin[g] | curriers [a-]|gainst th[eir] | own com[pa-] | nie to the [vn-]|doing of [ma-]|ny hones[t] | poore m[en] | of that tr[ade.] And the passage on sig. F4 v of Q1 a reading "And as for you goodman Baker, that delight to be seen where most people resort, euen on the pillory in the cheefe market place. . . ." became in Q1 b "And for you goodman Baker, you that are cosine to Christ in brooking the pillorie as hee did the crosse. . . ." Two minor verbal changes before and after the above passage were necessary in order to fill out the lines of type. Since the running-titles are the same in both states in sheet F, these changes were undoubtedly made while Q1 a was being run off. We cannot be positive on this point because only one copy of each state is extant. When demand for the tract necessitated a second printing, the work was reset in entirety: all ornaments and side-notes were eliminated, and the number of gatherings reduced from eight to six. Furthermore, except for the accidental omission of lines and the usual orthographical changes when a work goes through many printings, the text became standardized and is sharply differentiated from Q1 a-b because of five deletions made presumably before Greene's death on September 3, 1592. 7 Since all later editions follow Q1 b in removing the Harvey attack and in altering the phraseology of the allusion to the bakers, Q1 b obviously became the copy-text. 8 It should also be noted that Q2-Q5 have the same title-page and the same typesetting on sig.A2 v . Catch-words and signatures, as the collations above indicate, are practically the same in Q2-Q6. In view of these similarities, we may be certain that the different forms of the Quip were run off the presses within a short time. Because these later editions are paginary reprints, it will not be possible to prove conclusively the order of printing. Nevertheless, we can, I believe, arrive at a hypothetically correct order. First, it is necessary to cite the evidence for Q2 as the second edition: (1) As the partial list of variant readings given below reveals, Q2, more frequently than any of the other editions, retains the phraseology of Q1 b . (The first citations are from Q1 b -Q2, and the line references are from Q2; the latter readings are from Q3-Q6.) A3 l. 4 cleere: cheere 9 me: men B1 v 33 courtiers: country B3 26 seing that: seeing B3 v 1 take: takes 32 or other suts: in other sutes B4 24 of hart: of the hart B4 v 21 wars: warre D4 2 hides or backes: backs or hides 28 a little heere: heere a little 32 espied: spied (2) On sig. A4, l. 11, of Q2, we find the reading: "the the Deuill". This is an easily understood error if we turn to sig. B2 of Q1 b , where the catch-word is "the" and the first two words of the next page "the Deuill". The printer probably set up "the" in Q2, turned to the next page in Q1 b , and composed "the Deuill". (Although Q1 a-b have identical type-settings here, it seems more logical that Q1 b was being followed, since, as I have previously noted, Q2 adopts all the emendations of the second issue of the first edition.) On the basis of this evidence, although it cannot be considered conclusive, Q2 appears to be the second edition of the pamphlet. 9 To determine the order of the other printings, our best guide is the use of standing type in the various editions. The chart below shows graphically how typesettings were transferred from one edition to another, beginning with Q3. (I have not noted in this chart that sigs. A1 and A2 v are identical in Q2-Q5.) That Q3 is a later edition than Q2 is proven by the fact that in Q3 the standing type from Q2 has been altered for correction on every page, except on sig. E1, which is a new setting, and on sig F1, which is identical. 10 A line inadvertently omitted on sig. E4 v of Q2 is restored in Q3. 11 In addition, the compositor of Q3 followed the settings of signatures C and D in Q2, as illustrated by the unusual appearance of a half line of type on the signature line of sig. D1: vppon precept to arrest mee, D hath The printing history of Q3, then, can be easily reconstructed. When John Wolfe decided to run off a third edition of the Quip, he found the standing type of sheets E and F of Q2. Since the type of sig. E1 had been disturbed, he had that page reset and obvious typographical errors on the other pages corrected. Then, when the popularity of the tract necessitated a fourth printing, Wolfe found that the standing type of sheets A and B from Q3 was still intact and could be used in Q4. However, because type had been disturbed, sig. B1 in entirety, the running-titles of sigs. B2 v and B4 v , and the catchword of sig. B4 v had to be reset. Although the changes made during the resetting of sig. B1 do not necessarily indicate that Q4 is later than Q3, 12 the number of variant readings introduced in this printing points to this conclusion. Another argument for the correctness of the order of printing outlined here is the appearance of the broken h in "shall" on sig. C2, l. 29, of Q5, the inner forme of this signature being the same in Q4 and Q5. Q4 and Q5 are even more closely related than the chart above indicates. In sheet A, not only are sigs. A1 and A2 v identical settings, but also the same typesetting appears on sig. A2, with the exception of these corrections (the readings from Q4 appear first): l. 1 Burnabie: Barnabie l. 8 theit: their. The second correction indicates the priority of Q4. And, as the chart illustrates, C(i) and one-half (1 v , 4) of F(i) have identical typesettings. ("FINIS" on sig. F4 appears lower on the page in Q5.) In addition, the catch-words in these two editions are the same with these two exceptions (the readings from Q4 appear first): B3 v match: Italian; D1 mace: hath. Moreover, a tabulation of the last two words of lines toward the middle of the page (one page from each forme of each signature) reveals differences only on sigs. B4 and C2 v . (The compositor of Q5, after referring to Q1 b -Q3, restored a line omitted on sig. B4 of Q4.) 13 Q6 is easily distinguished from the editions we have examined, for on the title-page the setting of "A | QVIP FOR AN VP-| ſtart Courtier:" is different in this printing, 14 and sig. A2 v , identical in Q2-Q5, has been reset. In addition, the initial I on sig. A3 has a noticeable break in the upper left-hand corner, not apparent in Q2-Q5. Q6 is also characterized by attempts at perfection of the text in regard to orthography ("ancient" for "antient," for example), consistent capitalization of proper names, new paragraph divisions and proper indentation of the paragraph beginning on l. 16 of sig. B4 (previously not indented), and more logical punctuation throughout the tract. Since catch-words and line-endings are usually the same in Q4-Q6, it is not possible to ascertain whether Q6 follows Q4 or Q5. The line irregularities noted in the collation point to Q4, but, on the basis of the variant readings, Q5 seems the more logical candidate, as in at least twenty-four instances Q6 retains readings which appear first in Q5. Further proof that the order of printing outlined here is substantially correct is furnished by the transfer of running-titles from edition to edition. If we look at the collations, we see that "A quippe for | for an vpſtart Courtier." appears five times in Q2 and Q3, once in Q4, and not at all in Q5 and Q6. We also find that erroneous running-titles are gradually eliminated, until in Q6 there is complete uniformity. Thus, on the basis of the transfer of formes and running-titles, the introduction of variant readings, and attempts at perfection, particularly in Q6, the printing history of the Quip in 1592 appears to be clear. Moreover, after careful examination of all extant copies of the tract printed in this year, we have definite evidence that at least six editions, rather than two as heretofore supposed, appeared in 1592. Finally, this bibliographical analysis of the pamphlet demonstrates that it caused no small sensation in London literary circles, probably because of the vicious attack on the Harveys, and that Greene himself was an unusually popular writer in the Elizabethan era. 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See "Early Editions of Greene's 'Quip for an Upstart Courtier' (1592)," The Gentleman's Magazine, CCC (1906), 68-71. In Robert Greene et ses romans (Paris, 1938), pp. 474-475, n., René Pruvost discusses the editions of this tract. Because of his ambiguous terminology, it is difficult to ascertain whether he believes that there were three or four editions in 1592. Although he notes that S.T.C. entry 12301 a , collating A1-F3, supposedly in the Huntington Library, is erroneous, later he appears to accept this non-existent copy as a separate printing. Thus he identifies the editions called here Q1 a-b , Q4 (the White copy, now in the Harvard Library), and Q5 (the copy in the British Museum, which is a later state of this printing, as I indicate below.) 2 The Ashley copy differs from the Harvard copy in the following respects (the readings from the Harvard copy appear first: A3 v , l. 38, gaue: geue B2, l. 38, than: then B3 v , l. 37, tye: tie C2, CW (fa-) thers: (fa-)there C3, CW, though: through F3 [unsigned]: [signed] On sigs. B3 and C3 the signatures are placed differently, and on sig. F1 v the RT is placed differently. In the above list it will be noted that all variants occur in the last line of the text, in the direction-line, or in the running-title, except in the case of sig. B3 v , where the change appears in the third line from the bottom of the page. Thus these variants probably indicate loosened type during the course of the same run. If this was the case, then, the appearance of corrected sheets, sigs. B2 and C3 in Ashley and sigs. A3 v and C2 in Harvard, is attributable to the mixing of sheets in binding. If this explanation is correct, the use of the standing type of sigs. C2 and F1 v in Q4 and Q5 is understandable. It also becomes clear why on sig. B2 Q3 and Ashley coincide in a variant reading as against Harvard, and why on sig. B3 v Q3 and Harvard coincide in a variant reading as against Ashley. 3 The BM copy has a number of stop-press corrections (the readings from the Folger copy appear first): A3, l. 11 wanean: wantan Almongst: A mongst CW thu:thus A4 v 18 heerein: herein 25 io: to 26 thareby . . . that: thereby . . . t at 27 bralwing: brawling B2 v 8 presse: pressd 20 outlandish . . . me: vplandish . . . mee 31 when you: whenyou B3 26 faest: facst The only significant alteration occurs on sig. B2 v , l. 20, where the printer evidently checked earlier editions and restored in the BM copy the original reading "vplandish". (Q6 reprints "outlandish".) 4 This catch-word was corrected while Q5 was being run through the press. See footnote 3. 5 See footnote 2. 6 Although the Harvey passage consists of twenty-two lines in Q1 a , the second issue of this edition lacks only thirteen lines, because the printer spaced out words, eliminated contracted forms, and added words and phrases. See footnote 8. 7 See my "Deletions in Robert Greene's A Quip for an Upstart Courtier (1592)," The Huntington Library Quarterly, XV (1952), 277-282. 8 The following emendations which appear in Q1 b are retained in all subsequent printings (the readings from Q1 a appear first, and signature and line references pertain only to that edition): E3, l. 33 of: vpō E3 v 14 may see: may apparantly see 15 Pillorie: Pillory, (in the sight of a great many good and sufficiente witnesses,) 21 a cudgell: a good crab-tree cudgell E4 25 questioned them their: questioned with them of their seuerall 27 the third: and the third E4 v 2 the statutes: the aunciente lawes and Statutes F4 v 32 as: [ omitted ] 37 weight, you: weight by many ounces, you 9 Another error in Q2 is comprehensible only if this edition preceded Q3 and Q4. On sig. F4, l. 3, a new paragraph begins illogically in the middle of a sentence with "Whome". In Q1 b there is no paragraph at this point, but in Q3 and in all later editions a paragraph begins with the words "Worshipfull sir" in the preceding line. The compositor of Q2 probably misinterpreted the author's (or printer's) paragraph symbol in the margin of Q1 b . 10 Representative examples of the corrections made in Q3 are cited below (the readings from Q2 appear first): E1 v , l. 7 rhem: them 12 will: well E2 22 pradon: pardon E2 v 25 willl: will F1 v 15 mau: man F2 v 10 a is: is a 11 In Q2 the last line of sig. E4 and the first line of the next page read: breeches and Veluet breeches and that wee needed them to be | [CW] of | are my parishoners, and we haue beene drinking with a poore man (Because of cropping, the catch-word is taken from Q3.) In Q3 the first line of sig. E4 v reads correctly: "of the quest. mary (quoth sir Ihon) a good motion, know these all". 12 In the resetting of sig. B1 of Q4, the following changes appear (the readings from Q3 appear first): B1 l. 19 Fense schoole: Fence scoole 31 country: countrie 33 England Nor: England. Nor Probably because of movement of type, we find that "in costy" on sig. B4 v , l. 2, of Q3, appears as one word "incosty" in Q4. 13 The following line is omitted in Q4 on sig. B4 after l. 11: "preach the Gospell: the Lawier to reforme wronges and maintaine". 14 There are two fairly obvious alterations in the placement of the letters in the title: the A is further to the left of the O in "FOR" in Q6, and the O in "FOR" and C in "Courtier", which are directly under each other in Q2-Q5, are not aligned in the sixth edition. 15 In preparing this paper, I am indebted to the following for their generous cooperation: Mr. William A. Jackson, of the Houghton Library; Mr. Herman R. Mead, of the Huntington Library; Mr. H. M. Nixon, of the British Museum; and Mr. Lars Hanson, of the Bodleian Library. The late Dr. A. S.

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of John Webster's Plays (I) by John Russell Brown</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Anyone wishing to make a close study of the plays of John Webster will soon find himself involved in textual and bibliographical investigations. 1 For instance, F. L. Lucas' edition of 1927 deals with questions of textual authority, but since Lucas wrote, critical bibliography and the study of dramatic manuscripts have so developed that his answers can no longer be trusted. These studies have posed new questions as well as developing new techniques for answering old ones; so, while Lucas was content to follow Dyce in noting a few variants in copies of the first quartos, a present-day student will require a complete survey of the known copies and will wish to analyse them rigorously. This paper, and one which should follow shortly, attempt to bring the study of Webster's text a little more up-to-date. They will deal with The White Devil, The Duchess of Malfi, and The Devil's Law Case, the three plays which Webster authenticated by his interest in publication. Each play exists in a single authoritative text and the first task must concern the nature of the copy which lies behind these texts. Such enquiries are not strictly bibliographical, but they are necessary preliminaries and illustrate the fact that, as an applied science, Bibliography must often work in conjunction with other skills, less scientific in their method and less certain in their conclusions. Since bibliographical problems are seldom self-contained, these studies will often be hampered by the lack of knowledge about related texts; on the other hand, they may help forward other work. Nicholas Okes, the printer of The White Devil and The Duchess of Malfi, also printed the 'Pied Bull' quarto of King Lear and the 1622 quarto of Othello, and therefore knowledge about his compositors will possibly add to our knowledge of these Shakespeare texts. I hope to show that The Duchess of Malfi was printed from a transcript by Ralph Crane: the evidence for this may influence similar hypotheses about plays in the 1623 Shakespeare folio. Certain press corrections in The Duchess also relate to this problem. 2 The known facts about the publication of The White Devil can be briefly summarized. The title-page records that the play was 'Acted by the Queenes Maiesties Seruants' and 'Written by Iohn Webster'. The imprint is 'LONDON, / Printed by N.O. for Thomas Archer, and are to be sold / at his Shop in Popes head Pallace, neere the / Royall Exchange. 1612.' Following the title-page is a preface 'To the Reader' written by the author who also added a short note at the end of the text. The date of composition was probably early 1612 or the winter of 1612-13. 3 At this date there was nothing unusual in early publication or in the author providing prefatory material; apparently a custom had developed which permitted playwrights to have a 'double sale of their labours, first to the Stage, and after to the presse'. 4 Shakespeare and Beaumont and Fletcher seem to be exceptional in not taking advantage of this custom; The Faithfull Shepherdess was, however, quickly published with an epistle and three dedicatory verses by the author, after its failure on the stage in 1608 or 1609. 5 It follows that the early publication of The White Devil with an author's preface proves very little by itself; it must be considered together with other plays performed by the same company of players at the same time. There are only five other plays printed between 1608 and 1616 whose title-pages assert that they were acted by the Queen's Majesty's Servants. One of these, Heywood's The Four Prentices of London, was an old play when published in 1615. The other four were more or less recent, and, for each of them, prefatory matter explains something of how they came to be published. The earliest, Heywood's The Rape of Lucrece, was published in 1608 after it had been duly entered in the Stationers' Register on 3 June. The author, in a preface 'To the Reader', excuses the publication of his play on the grounds that some of my plaies haue (vnknown to me, and without any of my direction) accidentally come into the Printers handes, and therfore so corrupt and mangled, (copied onely by the eare) that I haue bene as vnable to know them, as ashamde to chalenge them. This therefore I was the willinger to furnish out in his natiue habit: first beeing by consent, next because the rest haue beene so wronged in beeing publisht in such sauadge and ragged ornaments. Heywood's The Golden Age, published in 1611 after entry in the Stationers' Register on 14 October, is excused as "comming accidentally to the Presse', the author only afterwards 'hauing notice thereof'. Dekker's If it be not Good, the Devil is in It was published in 1612 and dedicated to 'my louing, and loued friends and fellowes, the Queenes Maiesties seruants.' Greene's Tu Quoque, which was probably written in 1611, 6 was published in 1614 following the death of the actor Thomas Greene; this is marked by the inclusion of an elegy by 'W.R.' and a brief character by Thomas Heywood. From these four plays, it would seem that about the year 1612 the publication of a new play as from the repertory of the Queen's Majesty's Servants needed some sort of excuse, apology, or special dedication. Yet The White Devil's preface shows an independent attitude, critical of the theatre in which this company was habitually acting: IN publishing this Tragedy, I do but challenge to my selfe that liberty, which other men haue tane before mee; not that I affect praise by it, for, nos hœc nouimus esse nihil, onely since it was acted, in so dull a time of Winter, presented in so open and blacke a Theater, that it wanted (that which is the onely grace and setting out of a Tragedy) a full and vnderstanding Auditory: and that since that time I haue noted, most of the people that come to that Play-house, resemble those ignorant asses (who visiting Stationers shoppes their vse is not to inquire for good bookes, but new bookes) I present it to the generall veiw . . . . This independent attitude and Webster's desire to justify his play, do not suggest publication by common consent like the other Queen's Servants' plays; it is more like the independence of Jonson's epistles and dedications, 7 or Fletcher's justification of The Faithfull Shepherdess . This gives the first clue to the nature of the copy used by the printer; it was more likely to come from the author than from the players' company. But the real argument must be based on the bibliographical and textual peculiarities of the printed play. Lucas made deductions from one such detail; in a note on 'Enter Senate' (I.i.59-60; B2) he suggested that, 'like several others in the play', this entry may be premature and due to the text having been 'set up from a prompt-copy.' But then he pointed out that this is not certain if the play is thought of as performed continuously with no more break between Scenes 1 and 2 than the drawing of a curtain. For then the trumpets may quite well be heard at this point. 8 Whatever the verdict about this particular entry, the 'several other' entries which may be premature must be considered. Not counting grouped entries like those at the beginning of new scenes, there are some 50 entries in the play; and in 19 of these, characters are directed to enter before they are due to speak or be spoken to. The examination of manuscript prompt-books has given surer grounds for the analysis of this kind of evidence. It seems that the prompter repeating an author's direction in the left margin usually places it opposite the original, approximately at least . . ., and the reviser draws a line to mark the exact spot where they belong. Occasionally, however, he marks an entry a few lines earlier than the author had done. It is not that he writes the direction in advance of the actual entry, for his line shows that it is the entrance itself that he has advanced. Clearly his intention is to bring the characters on at the back of the stage a few moments earlier in order that they may be able to enter into the dialogue at the correct point. 9 In this way, a prompt-book copy could bring about occasional premature entries in a printed text; but so could several other kinds of copy. First, as Lucas suggested, the dramatist might have a reason for marking the entries early; plausible reasons could be suggested for all such entries in The White Devil . Secondly, a scribe could be responsible although he was not preparing a prompt-book; the Lansdowne manuscript of Middleton's A Game at Chess which is in the hand of Ralph Crane and based ultimately on Middleton's own papers, has an entry two lines before the Trinity manuscript which is in the author's autograph (I.i.212). 10 Again Crane's transcript of Demetrius and Enanthe gives directions a line or two earlier than the Folio version of 1647, 11 and yet the "evidence seems to suggest that the folio text represents the theatrical version of the play, and that Crane's transcript was made from the author's draft—probably the foul papers." 12 Thirdly, premature entries can be due to the carelessness of a compositor or writer of the copy, even when the latter is the author. The misplacing of the directions 'he writes' (IV.i.128; G2 v ) and 'Exit Flamineo' (V.iii.216; K3 v ) in the present play, where both seem to be a line or two late, could hardly derive from prompt-book copy. In the first example, there is plenty of room to the right of the text at the correct point, so the error was not dictated by the compositor's convenience. Because of the variety of ways in which they could arise, premature entries cannot indicate the type of copy used by the printers. More positive evidence comes from the suggestion that 'a copy intended for use in the theatre would surely, of necessity, be accurate and unambiguous in the matter of the character-names.' If this be so, it follows that a play in which the names are irregular was printed from the author's original MS., and that one in which they are regular and uniform is more likely to have been printed from some sort of fair copy, perhaps made by a professional scribe. 13 The White Devil has the following variations in speech directions: 1. Lodovico is signified by 'LOD.' or 'LODO.' and also by 'CAR.' which represents the name Carlo which he assumes in disguise: LODO I.i.2; B1, CAR V.i.61; I1, LOD V.i.66; I1, CAR V.ii.31; I3 v , and LOD V.iii.68; K1 v . 14 2. Gasparo likewise, is usually signified by 'GAS.' or 'GASP.', but changes to 'PED.' for Pedro. Later the disguise names of the two conspirators become confused, and he seems to be signified by 'CON.' and 'CAR.', the former probably being a misreading of the copy's Car. : GAS I.i.9; B1, PED V.i.63; I1, GAS V.iii.137; K2 v , CON V.vi.172; M1, GAS V.vi.184; M1, and CAR V.vi.228; M1 v . 3. Zanche, usually 'ZAN.', changes to 'MOO.' or 'MOORE.': ZAN I.ii.204; B4 v , MOO V.iii.224; K3 v , ZAN V.vi.23; L3, MOO V.vi.100; L4, and ZAN V.vi.123; L4. 4. Francisco, usually 'FRA.' or 'FRAN.', changes to 'FLO.' and also by error to 'FLAN.': FRAN II.i.1; C2 v , FLAN II.i.87; C4, FRAN II.i.113; C4, FLO V.iii.183; K3, FRA V.iii.215; K3 v , FLO V.iii. 223; K3 v , and FRA V.iii.231; K3 v . These variations are repeated in the character names found in stage directions, entries, and exits. Lodovico is sometimes referred to as Carlo, Gasparo as Pedro, Vittoria as Corombona, Zanche as the Moor, Francisco as Florence, and the Doctor as Julio: Count Lodouico I.i.Entry; B1, Lodouico IV.iii.Entry; H2, Car, V.ii.21; 13 v , Lodouico V.ii.75; I4 v , Lod V.vi.167; L4 v , and Carlo V.vi.167; L4 v . Gasparo I.i.Entry; B1, Gasper IV.iii.Entry; H2, Gaspar V.i.40; I1, Pedro V.ii.22; I3 v , Gasparo V.iii.125; K2 (margin), Gasp V.iv.Entry; K4 v , and Pedro V.vi.167; L4 v . Vittoria Corombona I.ii.Entry; B2, Corombona I.ii.112; B3 v (margin), Victoria I.ii.294; C2, Vittoria II.ii.2nd Dumb Show; E1, Corombona V.i.Entry; H4, and Vittoria V.iii.81; K1 v . Za n che I.ii.193; B4 v , the Moore V.iii.218; K3 v , Moore V.iii.274; K4, and Zanke V.vi.4; L2 v (margin). Francisco de Medicis II.i.Entry; C2 v , Fr II.i.147; C4 v , Francisco II.i.227; D1 v . Fran IV.i.47; G1 v , Francisco IV.iii.Entry; H2, the Duke of Florence IV.iii.Entry; H2, Fran IV.iii.81; H3(corrected state), Francisco IV.iii.134; H4, Florence disguised like Mulinassar V.i.40; I1, Francisco the Duke of Florence V.i.206-7; I3, Francisco V.iii.41; K1, Florence V.iv.43; L1, and Francisco V.iv.109; L2. Doctor II.i.287; D2 v , and Julio II.ii.1st Dumb Show; D4 v . Dr. P. Williams has shown that two compositors set the text of The White Devil, 15 but the character names vary inside the work of a single compositor; for instance 'A' was responsible for a change from Vittoria to Corombona (E1 and H4), and for that from Doctor to Julio (D2 v and 4 v ). In neither case could the change have been suggested by the occurrence of the new form in the dialogue. It is probable that the copy was responsible for these variations and, if so, it is unlikely to have been a manuscript used as a prompt-book. More evidence comes from some character names which have no significance in the text of the play and yet are found in stage directions and entries; they are 'little Iaques the Moore' (II.i.Entry; C2 v ), Christophero and Guid-antonio (II.ii. Ist Dumb Show; D4 v ), and Farnese (V.i.40; I1). These names might be accounted for in two ways: either the copy was derived from foul papers which retained undeveloped ideas or traces of an unknown source, or else it represented a theatrical abridgement of the original play. The former seems more likely as neither Iaques nor Farnese has any part in the action of the play and their presence among the entries would be an unnecessary complication which a prompter would hardly permit when a stroke of the pen could set the matter right. 16 These 'ghost' characters may, therefore, support the theory that the copy derived from a non-theatrical source, which was related to the author's foul papers. Errors in the printed text can also indicate the type of copy used. As far as the spoken word is concerned, the copy for The White Devil must have been very good, for there are only two minor points where the sense is in doubt, 17 and there is no essential correction that cannot be explained as a graphic or compositor's error. It is only in the stage directions etc. that the errors must derive from the copy itself. In the speech directions, for instance, the confusion of the disguise names has already been noticed and there are also omissions and misplacings: 'GIO' (vanni) and 'MONT' (icelso) are once given a line late (III.ii.339; F3, and IV.iii.93; H3 v ), and 'LAW' (yer) and perhaps 'BRAC' (hiano) are omitted (III.ii.11; E2 v , and V.i.60; I1). The compositor might be responsible for the omissions, but the misplacings are probably due to the copy and suggest that it was not a theatrical one: In all manuscripts intended for stage use every speech begins a fresh line of writing, irrespective of the metrical division. . . . The speakers' names are in the margin, and the beginning of speeches are not indented as is usual in print, but a short horizontal rule is drawn separating the speeches. 18 With such markings, a theatrical manuscript should be clear about the beginning of each speech. On the other hand, Addition 'D' of Sir Thomas More, the only considerable foul paper extant, shows the omission both of a speech rule and of a speech direction. 19 It would seem, therefore, that the copy for The White Devil was nearer in these respects to the foul paper addition of Sir Thomas More than to any surviving prompt-book. The inclusion of a redundant speech direction for 'VIT' (toria) (III.ii.273; F2) is most credibly accounted for in the same way. The omission of entries such as Isabella's at II.i.147 (C4 v ), Gasparo's at III.iii.79(F4), Francisco's at V.ii.44(I4), and the torch bearers' at the beginning of I.ii (B2), could be compositors' errors, but Addition 'D' of Sir Thomas More also shows this kind of fault (F. 8a,l.139). When an entry is marked for 'others' in a context which requires specific characters, the copy is more surely at fault. This occurs at the beginning of V.iii(I4 v ) where 'others' must include Francisco, Lodovico, Gasparo, Vittoria, and Giovanni, and at line 81 of the same scene (K1 v ) where Gasparo is specifically required. These omissions could scarcely be due to a theatrical manuscript, so once more there is evidence of foul papers behind the printed text. 20 The restriction of these 'copy errors' to the stage directions etc. implies the use of a copy which was fair with regard to the spoken word, but foul with regard to its adaptation for use in a theatre. Such a copy might be in the possession of the author. Webster in 'To the Reader' confesses he 'was a long time in finishing this Tragedy', and he was obviously a careful and detailed worker; he might well have made a fair copy of the text of his play before the final copy was made for the players with stage movements clearly indicated. If so, he had only to prepare this personal copy when he wished to justify his play by publication. Alternatively, the play might have been given to the players in this unprepared form and the bookkeeper then made another copy for use as a prompt-book. There are two arguments against this second theory; first, the circumstances of printing make it unlikely that the copy was the property of the players, and secondly, there are further errors in the stage directions which imply that the copy was originally less adapted to the stage than the printed text suggests. Among these further errors are five duplicate entries: 1. 'Enter . . . Camillo.' (II.i.227; D1 v ) which occurs later, and correctly, at line 280 (D2 v ). 2. 'Enter Francisco, . . . . At another dore the Duke of Florence.' (IV.iii.Entry; H2). 3. 'Enter Monticelso.' (IV.iii.86-7; H3 v ) which is made redundant by a proof correction of the text earlier (IV.iii.82; H3). 4. 'Enter Duke Brachiano.' (V.i.30; H4 v ) which occurs later, and probably correctly, at line 40 (I1). 5. 'Enter Lod. Gasp. Pedro, Carlo.' (V.vi.167; L4 v ); here the conspirators are given both their real and assumed names. These can hardly be considered as duplications made by a prompter because the redundant entry in 1. is part of a correctly timed group entry and in 3. it is later than the correct one. They are more likely to be due to foul papers or else they are signs of a hurried correction of the copy for the press. Such corrections might be necessary in a copy which had not been prepared for use in the theatre; the interest of the author in publication suggests that, in this case, he would be his own corrector. Isabella's entry at the beginning of III.ii (E2) is another error which implies a revision of the copy. More than fifty years ago, Sir Walter Greg considered this was due to a prompt-book copy; pointing out that Isabella is killed in the first dumb show of II.ii, he thought that "Zanche was intended, one actor playing the two parts, and the direction finding its way in from the stage copy." 21 But this explanation will not fit all the facts. In the first place, there is a similar confusion in the exit at the end of IV.i (G2 v ) where 'Mon.' is printed for 'Fran.' —two parts which could not possibly be doubled. Secondly, if Zanche and Isabella were doubled, it would require four changes of the black make-up. If a prompt-book is not able to explain Isabella's entry, neither can foul papers if they merely represented an original draft of the play. In the scene which follows the entry, Vittoria is tried for the murder of Isabella, and the whole trial is a direct consequence of that murder; it is therefore hard to imagine how Webster could include Isabella among the entrants in his original draft. The entry might have been added, however, during a hurried revision without reference to the prompt-book; if the author undertook this, one must suppose that it was some time after the initial composition. Only the errors of such a revision will be evident in the printed text and all the true corrections will pass unnoticed; this means that the copy must have been less fair than the quarto suggests. It is less likely to have been the copy given by the author to the players, and some kind of foul papers in the author's possession is a more probable source. The revision of the copy receives additional support from the presence of stage directions in the outside margins of the printed text: 1. 'Enter Corombona.' (I.ii.112-3; B3 v ). 22 2. 'Enter English Embassador.' (III.iii.26-8; F3 v ). 3. 'Reades the letter.' (IV.ii.26-7; G3). 4. 'The Conspirators here imbrace.' (V.i.61-3; I1). 5. 'These speches are seuerall kinds of distractions and in the action should appeare so.' (V.iii.84-90; K1 v ). 6. 'Brachiano seemes heare neare his end. Lodouico &amp; Gasparo in the habit of Capuchins present him in his bed with a Crucifix and hallowed candle.' (V.iii. 121-32; K2). 7. (a.) 'By the Crucifix.' (b.) 'By the Hollowed taper.' (V.iii.136-9; K2 v ). 8. 'In his leather Cassocke &amp; breeches, bootes, a coole, a pot of lilly-flowers with a scull int.' (V.iv.118-24; L2). 9. 'The Ghost throwes earth upon him and shewes him the scull.' (V.iv.128-32; L2). 10. 'Exit Ghost.' (V.iv.35; L2). 11. 'Enter Vittoria with a booke in her hand. Zanke, Flamineo, following them.' (V.vi.1-7; L2 v ). 12. 'Shee writes.' (V.vi.13; L2 v ). 13. 'He enters with two case of pistols.' (V.vi.24-6; L3). 14. 'Shewing the pistols.' (V.vi.106-7; L4). 15. 'They shoot and run to him &amp; tread upon him.' (V.vi.119-22; L4). Among the plays known to be printed by Nicholas Okes before 1616, there are four with similar marginal directions, and in each case they are much fewer in number. In Jonson's The Case is Altered (1609) there are two: 'Exit Oni' (sig. A4) during prose speeches where there is no room in the text space, and Exunt' (D2) more inexplicably, at the end of a scene. In the 'Pied Bull' quarto of Lear (1608), there are three marginal entries, two during prose speeches and one where the verse runs to the full extent of the text space (C2 v , D3 v , and F3). Daborne's A Christian Turned Turk (1612) has only one descriptive direction in the margin (H3) where there is no room in the text space. In Marston's The Insatiate Countess, of which Okes printed only the second edition in 1616, three descriptive directions are repeated in the margin, as in the first edition of 1613 (B1, D3, and E2). These last two plays have other long descriptive directions in the text space, so that Okes's printing house seems to have relegated directions to the margin only when there was no room to the right of the text. None of these four plays can parallel the marginal directions in The White Devil, and in The Duchess of Malfi and The Devil's Law Case the margins are not used at all. The departure from normal practice in The White Devil would mean extra trouble for the printer; directions would have to be composed separately from the main text, and added while the type for one complete forme was being fitted into its skeleton. The frisket would need to be specially cut for each forme with marginal directions. Subsequent editions of the play show how printers usually avoided such extra trouble. In the quarto of 1631, which is reproduced, with corrections, page for page from the first, four of the marginal directions are omitted altogether (1, 2, 3, and 5) and six are fitted into the text space (4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 13). In the quarto of 1665, which again corresponds page for page with its predecessors, four more are fitted into the text space (11, 12, 14, and 15). The position of the remaining one (7, a and b) is regularized in the larger quarto pages of the 1672 edition. There must have been some special reason for placing directions in the margin of the first quarto. It was not simply a question of convenience, for six of the marginal directions could easily fit into the text space (3, 9, 10, 12, 14, and 15). Nor was the practice adopted completely for a few selected formes; with one exception (F, inner) all those which have marginal directions have normally placed ones as well. The directions themselves give no clue, for no distinction in kind seems to dictate where they are placed; for instance the marginal 'Brachiano seemes heare neare his end. . . .' (6) is paralleled in the equally descriptive and normally placed 'Francisco speakes this as in scorne.' (III.ii.49-50; E3). Again, the marginal 'These speches are seuerall kinds of distractions . . . . .' (5) is paralleled in 'Cornelia doth this in seuerall formes of distraction.' (V.iv.90-3; L1 v ). The marginal directions cannot be considered as merely descriptive, for one includes an entry which marks the beginning of a new scene (11). All these factors mean that certain directions were placed in the outer margins of the printed page for reasons other than that of space or subject matter. Their position in the book can elucidate this. Both compositors placed some directions in the text space; at first only compositor 'B' used the margins, but in the last sheet but one, 'A' also adopted this arrangement. Except for two entries during prose speeches and the short direction 'Reades the letter.' (3), all the marginal directions occur after sig. G. This means that they were used more frequently towards the end of the play, and after a stage direction had been added during proof-correction ( viz. 'presents Fran. with a booke' IV.i.46-7; G1 v ). 23 They were not a product of this proof-correction, for both formes of sig. K have variant readings and yet the marginal directions are present in all states; two of them show minor corrections. The explanation which most readily offers itself is the one already brought forward to account for other peculiarities of the text—that a copy of the play which had not been prepared for use in a theatre was hurriedly corrected for the press in this respect. Possibly the corrector marked some of the additions in a distinctive way, so that after one of them had been omitted by error of the compositor (i.e. on G1 v ), the others could be easily distinguished for addition to the type when each forme was ready for imposition. They may have been written in the left hand margin, or else marked off in rules by the corrector. The nature and extent of these directions suggest that the corrector was the author himself and that he aimed at preparing the text for a reader. Numbers 5 and 6 especially bear this out: 'Brachiano seemes heare neare his end.' is clearly not a prompter's direction and is unlike an author's direction to the actors; it sounds precisely like a description of action for the benefit of a reader and is perhaps the strongest argument for the revision of the copy before going to press. It has already been implied that the marginal directions do not represent the full extent of the revision and this is borne out by the form of some normally placed directions. As well as those quoted above, one on K2 v appears to have been written expressly for a reader: 'Heare the rest being departed Lodouico and Gasparo discouer themselues.' (V.iii.148-51). Some literary directions are found copied into manuscript prompt-books, 24 and normally their presence in a printed text is no positive evidence for the nature of the copy, but in this case, the large number of directions and the special form of some of them do suggest that an attempt was made to present the action clearly to a reader. In conclusion there are two less positive indications of the type of copy used; first, the absence of act and scene divisions. In this The White Devil is different from most of the other plays performed and printed about the year 1612. Out of 33 non-academic plays first published between the end of 1609 and 1616, only five recently performed plays have no trace of either act or scene division. 25 An interpretation of this peculiarity comes from Sir Walter Greg's analysis of eighteen manuscript prompt-books: sixteen are as they stand divided into acts, and just half of these have the scenes also marked and numbered. The only two left wholly undivided are Sir Thomas More and John of Bordeaux, both early pieces, the former of which was probably never performed. 26 Because The White Devil is without any division it is probable, though on negative evidence, that its copy did not originate from a prompt-book. The second point is that no stage direction relates solely to the preparation of stage properties: such a direction would imply a theatrical origin for the copy. As a whole, the evidence leads to the conclusion that The White Devil was printed from a non-theatrical manuscript which was probably in the author's possession. This manuscript was fair with regard to the spoken word, but among the stage directions and speech directions there were marks of an author's foul papers. Before publication the copy had to be revised in these respects, and this was probably undertaken by the author in a hurried and incomplete manner. The copy for The White Devil was therefore authoritative and represented the play as the author wrote it rather than as it was performed on the stage. As a kind of foul paper, it may have been in the author's own handwriting. Most of the direct evidence about the publication of The Duchess of Malfi is contained in the preliminary matter of the first quarto. The title-page reads: THE / TRAGEDY / OF THE DVTCHESSE / Of Malfy. / As it was Presented priuatly, at the Black- / Friers; and publiquely at the Globe, By the / Kings Maiesties Seruants. / The perfect and exact Coppy, with diuerse / things Printed, that the length of the Play would / not beare in the Presentment. / VVritten by John Webster . / [Quotation] / [rule] / LONDON: / Printed by Nicholas Okes, for Iohn / Waterson, and are to be sold at the / signe of the Crowne, in Paules / Churchyard, 1623. Although similar notes are comparatively rare, the reference to the 'perfect and exact Coppy' cannot carry much weight by itself. For instance, on the title-pages of two quartos of The Maid's Tragedy there are notes on the textual authority which have no justification at all. Although quartos 6 and 7 boast that they are 'Revised and Corrected exactly by the Original', they are really reproduced from quarto 3, as quartos 4 and 5 had been before. 27 If the claim for an 'original' or 'true' copy seems justified on any one occasion, the exact interpretation of the words often remains difficult. For example, the 1604/5 quarto of Hamlet claims to be 'according to the true and perfect Coppie', and in this case there is a 'high probability that the copy . . . . was Shakespeare's own manuscript.' 28 Another interpretation is required for The Elder Brother (1637) which claimed to be 'Printed according to the true Copie'; this text derives from 'a transcript of the original MS. corrected for the press by Massinger'. 29 Another variety of meaning is shown in the title-page of the Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647, which stated that the plays were 'now published by the Authours Originall Copies'. Here other evidence shows that in the majority of cases it was 'the licensed prompt-books from which performances had been given' that were sent to the printers. 30 It is clear that even if The Duchess of Malfi 's 'perfect and exact Coppy' seems justified in a general sense, no precise meaning can be given to the words. Nor can any clear information come from the claim that the text includes 'diuerse things Printed, that the length of the Play would not beare in the Presentment'; passages omitted in performance could be found in the prompt-book as well as in the original papers of the author. Omissions were seldom marked so that the text was undecipherable; often a vertical line in the left margin appears to have been sufficient. 31 On sig. A2 v , following the title-page, there is an incomplete list of dramatis personœ and of the actors who took the parts mentioned. There are earlier lists of principal actors in plays by Beaumont and Fletcher and by Jonson, but The Duchess of Malfi was the first play from the repertory of the King's Men to be published with a list assigning parts to individual actors. Unfortunately there are no manuscript casts extant and "we are left to speculate as to the origin of the Casts printed in a few late quartos." 32 The Duchess of Malfi 's cast can therefore give no clue to the copy beyond the general inference that the actors were interested in the publication or were perhaps consulted about it. A similar inference may be drawn from the dedication (A3-3 v ) to George Harding, Baron Berkeley of Berkeley Castle. Webster here presents his excuse why, '(being a stranger to your Lordshippe) I offer this Poem to your Patronage'. Presumably he selected this unknown patron because of his family connection with the Lords Hunsdon, previous patrons of the King's Men. 33 The players might well have been those persons 'of worth, who both in contemplation, and practice' owed George Harding service, and who directed Webster to this likely patron. The general authority of the text and the author's interest in publication are also attested by the commendatory poems (A4-4 v ) and the note 'The Author disclaimes this Ditty to be his' (III.iv.11-4; H2). 34 We may therefore sum up the evidence so far considered as implying that the author and players agreed to publish a worthy text of The Duchess of Malfi, a play which had been in their repertory since 1613-14. 35 Cuts had been made in the text, but they let it be known that the printed play would aim at a complete text rather than an acting version. Textual, bibliographical, and typographical evidence must further elucidate the nature of the copy which was sent to the printers. Undoubtedly it was not a prompt-book or the author's foul papers, though it could have been based on either of these: the entries massed at the beginning of each scene make this much clear, and show that the copy was intended for readers and not for use in a theatre. It has been thought that texts with massed entries were assembled from players' parts by the help of the 'plot', but this theory has not been substantiated and massed entries are more probably due to the idiosyncrasy of a scribe. 36 It remains to investigate who made the transcript and from what sources. Evidence on the latter point is likely to be obscured by the editing of the transcriber. For instance, irregularities in nomenclature in the speech directions and stage directions can give clues to the nature of the copy; in this text they are regular and unambiguous. The abbreviated forms of Cariola and the Cardinal might cause confusion but this is carefully avoided: when both characters are on the stage together, or soon after each other, Cariola is given in full (e.g., I.i.215; B4, and I.i.393 &amp; 400; C2 v ). Such care is in contrast to the practice in The White Devil but no inference can be drawn, since the scribe who prepared the copy or the book-keeper in the theatre might equally be responsible. There is a similar doubt about a stage direction at the head of V.iii (M3 v ): 'Antonio, Delio, Eccho, (from the Dutchesse Graue.)' This is most readily explained as an author's direction, for a prompter would hardly use these words to remind himself that the actor who played the Duchess would also speak the Echo; yet, if it could not derive directly from the prompter, it might be the transcriber's interpretation of his direction. Several textual details have been adduced as signs of a prompt-book origin for the copy, but in each case the facts can bear another interpretation. For instance, Rupert Brooke drew attention to I.i.187(B3 v ); here Delio usefully questions Antonio about the other chief characters. Antonio gives a long description of the Cardinal; then a long description of the Duke, his brother; then, before going on to the Duchess, he reverts suddenly to the Cardinal, as if he had not mentioned him, with: 'Last, for his brother there, the Cardinal. . . .' Brooke suggested that this might 'point to a combination of two versions', and from the context he implied that these versions were due to a revision of the original play. 37 But such irregularities could be due to unpolished writing and derive from the author's fould papers rather than a prompt-book. Two other possible clues may be as briefly dismissed. One is the account of a play by an Italian, Orazio Busino, written 7 Feb. 1618; this may refer to The Duchess of Malfi but if so, "there must have been a good deal in the performance he saw which is not in the play as we have it—even allowing for his misinterpretation." 38 If the identification is allowed, there is nothing to show whether the play as this contemporary saw it, was the original or the revision; only if it were the original would the printed text be likely to derive from the prompt-book. The other clue was a supposed allusion (I.i.6-23; B1-1 v ) to the murder, on 24 April 1617, of Concino Concini, Maréchal d'Ancre; but now the allusion cannot be considered proved and it is no longer evidence for a revised text. 39 Professor R. C. Bald saw further evidence of a prompt-book, pointing out that the direction at the opening of the play is Antonio, Delio, Cardinal, Bosola, but, in spite of the fact that there is no new scene, there is another massed stage direction after line 8[3] 40 which contains the names of these four characters a second time, . . . . Lines [1-83] are thus, it would seem, one of those passages which 'the length of the Play would not beare in the Presentment' . . . . . . In making the cut in the theatrical prompt-book, the prompter had to make provision for the entry, along with the others at the new beginning of the play, of the four characters 41 whose opening speeches were now omitted; but, in preparing the text for the printer, a massed stage direction was put at the head of the omitted speeches when they were restored, although the direction which stood at the beginning of the play while the cut was in force has been unintelligently repeated in the massed direction that now comes after line 8[3] in the quarto text. Such confusion can hardly have arisen from anything but the state of the prompt-copy'. 42 To say that there is 'no new scene' after 1.83 is to contradict the printed text which marks 'SCENA II' at this point. Certainly there is no Exeunt at the close of 'Scena Prima', but this proves nothing, for there is no Exit when Bosola leaves the stage at the end of II.iii; Antonio and Delio might well make their exits and re-enter in the Duke's train at the beginning of 'SCENA II'. Something of the same sort is found in The Winter's Tale, which also has massed entries. Again I.ii is a 'presence' scene and it is preceded by a dialogue between two lords, Camillo and Archidamus. 'Exeunt' is marked at the end of the preliminary scene, but Camillo is in attendance on the royal parties in Scene ii. He does not speak until l.210, but editors agree that he has been present from the beginning. There is no suggestion here that the first scene was cut in performance. Professor Bald does, however, reject the evidence of the stage direction 'A Coffin, Cords, and a Bell.' (IV.ii.164-6; K1 v ) which looks at first like a prompter's direction. It has the brevity, but is probably an explanatory note to line 16[4], 'Here is a present from your Princely brothers', since one would have expected a prompter to make such a note for properties a little before the entrance of the executioners, which, though it occurs here, is not indicated by a stage direction at this point. 43 This is supported by another brief note at III.v.37(H3); Bosola has entered (l.28) with a letter which he hands to the Duchess, and, before she reads it, the text has the words 'A Letter.'. These are printed in ordinary type as if beginning a new line of verse, except that they are inset a little from the margin; the inset supports Lucas' contention that the words are a stage direction rather than part of the Duchess' speech. 44 As before, a prompter's note would have been placed before Bosola's entry; he would want to be sure that the actor entered with the letter. Textual errors cannot give any clear indication of the copy used; the only possibility is the omission of a speech by Bosola (II.iii.54; E2) which might be due to a cut being marked in the acting version in a way that rendered the passage undecipherable. But the error could also derive from foul papers or the accidental omission of the passage by a scribe or compositor. One further peculiarity should be mentioned though it too is ambiguous. In the list of actors, N. Towley is given as playing the part of Forobosco, but in the play this character occurs only when he is spoken of as keeping 'the key o'th'Parke-gate' (II.ii.31-3; D4-4 v ): he is not mentioned in the stage directions nor has he any lines to say; he need never appear on the stage. Possibly a passage which was in an acting version of c. 1620 45 is missing from the printed text; this passage might have been in Webster's text as he sent it to the players, or it might have been added afterwards. If it was original, the 'diuerse things Printed, that the length of the Play would not beare in the Presentment' cannot be inclusive of all such omissions. If it was a new addition, the reference to Forobosco which remains in the text must be so too. In either case, the ultimate source of the copy was probably the prompt-book, which would have recorded these changes. There is, however, an alternative explanation. In contrast to the care taken with the nomenclature in speech directions and stage directions, there are several irregularities among the dramatis personœ (A2 v ); ' The Marquesse of Pescara' is found rather than 'Pescara' as elsewhere, and, more significant, ' The Cardinals M is .' instead of 'Julia'. Rodorigo, Grisolan, Castruchio, and the Old Lady are omitted. These irregularities would not be remarkable were it not for the careful work of the scribe; in view of this, it is possible that the dramatis personœ and actor list were compiled from memory by someone other than the scribe, perhaps the author. Perhaps Webster originally intended Forobosco to play some part in the action of the play—the 'ghost' characters in The White Devil suggest similar changes of intention—and then, when compiling the dramatis personœ, he remembered the idea and the name. The compositor, through accident or misreading, could have placed 'N. Towley' opposite Forobosco instead of Malateste who is allotted to no actor. It is even possible that Webster thought Towley played the part and was therefore unable to remember who had played Malateste. In any case, the Forobosco irregularity cannot definitely indicate a prompt-book origin for the copy. In summing up, it must be said that the copy had been so edited that there is no clear evidence of its origin, but whatever its ultimate source, the quality of the text reinforces the belief that the quarto was fully authoritative. In trying to discover who made the transcript which served as copy, the evidence is more informative. Several factors suggest that the scribe was Ralph Crane: he worked for the King's Men from before 1621, 46 he was certainly the scribe of A Game at Chess (Bodleian, Mal. MS.25), the only extant manuscript play which completely reproduces the massed entries of The Duchess of Malfi, and, as an example of more minute evidence, the peculiar direction 'A Letter' which has already been noticed above, is reproduced in Crane's transcript of Middleton's The Witch (M.S.R., 1.646). Crane's habits of spelling and punctuation have been fairly often studied, 47 and many of them are found in the printed text of Webster's play. There are difficulties in assessing evidence for this. In the first place, compositors often changed the accidentals of their copy. However, this difficulty is not insurmountable; none of the four plays which were also printed for the first time by Nicholas Okes between 1617 and 1627 can provide detailed similarities to Crane's characteristics which are in any way comparable with those found in The Duchess of Malfi . For example, there are some 210 pairs of brackets in Webster's play, but in The Maid's Tragedy (1619) there are 14, in Philaster (1620) 1, in Thierry and Theodoret (1621) 31 and in Othello (1622) 7. 48 Secondly, Crane's manuscripts show that he was not constant in all his habits; for instance, he temporarily showed a greater pedantry when he was transcribing the two manuscripts of A Game at Chess . 49 Thirdly, there is no known example of Webster's handwriting; it is just conceivable that he had similar characteristics to Crane's. As the only available check on this, a comparison will be made with the printed text of The White Devil which, as we have suggested, was possibly based on an autograph copy. All Crane's manuscripts show a fondness for parentheses and colons, and in his transcripts of A Game at Chess he used 'emphasis capitals more frequently and more consistently' than the autograph copy. 50 These characteristics are represented in The Duchess of Malfi; compared with The White Devil, which has approximately the same number of lines, 51 capitals, brackets, and colons are all more frequent. Not counting those used at the beginning of lines and sentences, and for proper names, titles, and words of address, there are about 900 capitals in The Duchess and about 550 in The White Devil. 52 For colons and semi-colons the proportion is 984 to 476, and for brackets, 210 to 5. Hyphens are used excessively in Crane's manuscript of The Witch and although this was not a constant habit in Crane, nor one peculiar to him, it may be significant that there are 258 hyphens in The Duchess and only 172 in the earlier play. Some usages are restricted to The Duchess: for instance, 'pray-thee' (four times; III.ii.62; F4, IV.i.23; I1, IV.ii.207; K2, and V.ii.5; L2), 'cas'de-vp' (twice; II. iii.84; E2, misprinted 'caside-vp', and III.ii.162; G1), and 'to-much' (I.i.35; B1 v ), 'Tilt-often' (I.i.122; B3), and 'throttle-her' (IV.ii.262; K3). Crane's use of the apostrophe has many peculiarities, some of which are reproduced in The Duchess of Malfi . The abbreviation 'neu'r' is found eight times and 'you'll'd', for you would, is found once together with 'I'll'd' (five times), 'they'll'd' (once), and the variants, 'I'ld', 'I'l'd', and 'Youl'd' (once each). 'Neu'r' is not found in The White Devil and the closest to 'you'll'd' etc. is 'you'ld', 'Yee'ld', and 'You'd' (once each). 53 Occasionally Crane used the form '-'de' for the past tense ending, as in 'tyr'de' ( Demetrius and Enanthe, l.183), or 'liu'de' ( The Witch, l.262); this form occurs seven or eight times in The Duchess of Malfi, 54 but not once in The White Devil . The 'Jonsonian' elision, which is so marked in The Witch, is only found once in The Duchess of Malfi where the metre seems to require the elision of 'here'it' (II.v.20; E4). This provides no distinction between the two plays, for The White Devil also has 'You'are' (V.i.41; I1). One significant clue is in Crane's habit of adding the loop to an 'l' after the word in which it occurs has been completed. 55 When carelessly made it may easily be mistaken for an apostrophe, and this could well be responsible for the curious form 'Rall'y' in The Duchess (V.v.65; N2 v ). Some of Crane's characteristic spellings are found in The Duchess: 'noyce' (seven times), 'Whether' for whither (three times), and 'sencible', 'sencibly, 'doong', 'beutifie', and 'hether' (once each). His use of 'o' for u as in 'droms', 'nomber', etc. may be seen in 'somme', and 'dombe'. 56 None of these spellings is found in The White Devil, but the following Crane spellings, though found in The Duchess, can be paralleled in the earlier play: 'falce', 'Cursses', and 'wincke', 'rancke', 'Incke', 'starcke', etc. 57 This survey shows that many, but not all, of Crane's characteristics are found in The Duchess of Malfi . Normal spellings are found side by side with special ones, but, if the copy were in Crane's hand, this is what we would expect to find—especially as it is special forms of common words which are most notably lacking. Compositors might be expected to regularize 'theis', 'nobely', 'thinck', etc. The evidence for the copy being in Crane's hand is sufficient to amount to probability. To summarize, (1) he was working for the King's Men near the time of publication, (2) the only extant manuscript play with massed entries is in his hand, (3) a peculiar stage direction is paralleled in a Crane transcript, (4) the play has a large number of capitals, brackets, colons, and hyphens and this reflects Crane's usage, (5) characteristic uses of hyphens and apostrophes, and several characteristic spellings are found, (6) in these respects The Duchess differs from The White Devil, which was possibly in Webster's autograph, and none of the four plays printed for the first time by Okes between 1617 and 1627 can compare in all these details, and finally (7) the form 'Rall'y' may be a misreading due to Crane's manner of writing an 'l'. We may conclude that the copy for The Duchess of Malfi was a transcript, probably in the hand of Ralph Crane, and that the text had been so prepared that no clear sign of foul papers or prompt-book has survived. It is also probable that the author was responsible for the publication, which was undertaken with the consent of the players. The evidence for the copy of The Devil's Law Case, printed by A[ugustine] M[athewes] and dated 1623, is slight and inconclusive. The publication was undertaken with the author's help as is shown by his dedication (A2) and epistle (A2 v ) and the fact that the 'vnbeg'd Commendatory Verses' of his friends were offered for the edition ('To the Iuditious Reader'; A2 v ). According to the title-page, the text was ' The true and perfect Copie from the Originall . As it was approouedly well Acted by her Maiesties Seruants.' All this can only imply that the publication was authoritative, and the careful text bears this out; apart from some false Latin and French, there are no apparent errors in the text which need imply a fault in the copy itself. Rupert Brooke thought there was one error that implied a promptbook origin: on three separate occasions in III.3, [144, -7, &amp; 239; F3 v &amp; 4 v ] the 1623 edition has "Surgeon" where it ought to be "Surgeons," for there were two surgeons in the case. It would have lessened the dramatic effect but not hurt the plot to reduce these two to one, and it is just the kind of change that might have been made in order to use fewer actors. . . . 58 But one textual correction must be considered in conjunction with the whole play. If two surgeons were reduced to one in performance, the dialogue in III.ii would have to be entirely recast, much of it as soliloquy, and stage directions throughout the play would have to be changed. Before one deduced that the copy was a prompt-book, it would have to be shown how such a far reaching change left so few marks in the text, and none in the stage directions. A more satisfactory explanation would be that the singulars are survivals from foul papers; the need for two surgeons may not have been apparent until the play was partly written, and a few casual allusions might escape Webster's attention in the subsequent rewriting. However the singulars may not be copy errors; the third occurrence is possibly a misprint for Surgeon (cf. 'they', l.241), and, for the others, the element of gullery allows some latitude in the false description of Contarino's supposed death. In soliloquy between these passages, Romelio refers precisely to 'my two Surgeons' (l.225; F4 v ). There is clearly no firm evidence for the copy, either way. One entry looks like the kind of anticipated direction that would derive from a prompt-book. Unlike the premature entries of The White Devil, the entry of 'Contarino in a bed' (III.ii.69; E4) seems to be marked earlier than dramatic propriety demands. If the direction were followed, Contarino would appear before the bargain was settled between Romelio and the surgeons. However there are other directions which are misplaced in the play: 1. 'Enter Contarino.' (I.ii.236;C1)—a line too late. 2. 'Enter Rom. Julio, Ariosto, Baptista' (II.i.95-6;C3 v )—a line too late. 3. 'Enter Contarino, . . .' (IV.ii.4-5; H1)—2 lines too early. 4. 'Con. speaks aside.' (V.ii.15-6; K3)—a line too late. 5. 'to his mother' (V.iv.151-2; L2)—4 lines too early. Four of these misplacements could hardly derive from a prompt-book (1, 2, 4, and 5) and the simplest explanation which covers all these and Contarino's entry in III.ii, is that either the copy did not indicate the correct positions carefully or else the compositor was not accurate in reproducing them. In no. 5 there is plenty of room to the right of the text at the appropriate place, so the direction was not displaced to make the type setting easier. A direction in V.ii has some interest; it reads: Enter Ercole with a letter, and Contarino comming in Friers habits, as hauing bin at the Bathanites, a Ceremony vsed afore these Combates . (V.ii.12; K3). R. B. McKerrow noted that a mark of genuine prompter's copies is the mention, at the time of the entry of a character, of properties which he will require later in the scene, but either must not or need not exhibit to the audience at the time of entry. 59 At first sight, 'Enter Ercole with a letter, . . .' seems to conform to this type, for the letter is not mentioned in dialogue until 17 lines later. But this is not certain evidence. Ercole has to be on the stage while Contarino is speaking an aside of 4½ lines, and, although at line 30 Ercole speaks of having just received the letter, he already knows its contents. It may be that Ercole opens and reads the letter as soon as he appears on the stage. There is a parallel to this in The Duchess of Malfi, where the Cardinal enters 'with a Booke' (V.v. Entry; N2) and it is clear from the text that he is reading it. If this business is correct for The Devil's Law Case, the direction no longer conforms to McKerrow's description. Two other factors support this. First, the letter needed earlier in the play (I.i.223; B2) is not mentioned in any direction. Secondly, the reference to the Bathanites suggests that the rest of the direction is purely literary in origin; if so the first part is likely to be as well, for it all reads as one. In passing, it may be noticed that other directions are literary in tone: the reference to Romelio as Leonora's son (V.iv. 128; L1 v ), 'Enter Romelio very melancholly, . . .' (V.iv.43; K4 v ), and 'Enter Contilupo a spruce Lawyer.' (IV. i.83; G4 v ). One more direction needs special attention; A Table set forth with two Tapers, a Deaths head, a Booke, Iolenta in mourning, Romelio sits by her . (III.iii.Entry; F1 v ) This corresponds to a general feature of prompt-books: "If an author mentions properties it is as a rule only incidentally; the prompter is precise and peremptory." 60 However, further factors must be taken into account before the identification is made: (1) the precise injunction is only part of a descriptive direction in a form not specifically characteristic of prompt-books, (2) in The White Devil Webster has given specific instructions regarding properties in a form unlike that of a prompter (I.ii.193-5; B4 v ), so that he was obviously thoughtful about such matters, and, (3) the properties are not essential to the action. The occasion for the tapers, death's head, and book is clear from Romelio's first words, 'Why do you grieue thus?'; they are all tokens of Jolenta's grief which is not fully explicit in dialogue, and they have only this representational purpose. Concern for such a matter seems more characteristic of an author than a prompter, and so is the carelessness which did not mention the stools on which Jolenta and Romelio were to sit. If the direction were a prompter's, one would expect the list of properties to be complete. Having discussed, and seen reason to dismiss, some evidence for a prompt-book copy, 61 we may examine a few details of contrary evidence. First is a variation in a character name; in the list of dramatis personae (A1 v ) and in her first entry and speech directions (I.ii.190; B4 v et seq. ), Winifred appears as 'A wayting Woman', and only in III.iii. does she become 'Winifrid' (l.378; G2 v ) whereafter the earlier forms do not occur. These are very slight variations compared with those in The White Devil, and there is no fluctuation as between 'Francisco' and 'Florence'; a theory of a foul-paper copy cannot be constructed on this evidence alone. The next point concerns entries; an entry for the Capuchin and Ercole is omitted altogether (III.iii.309; G1 v ) and Sanitonella is omitted from the list of characters entering for the final scene. Either of these could be mere carelessness in the compositor, but also they may be due to the copy; if the latter, the copy could hardly be the prompt-book which should be complete in such matters. The 'ghost' character, Baptista, is one more shred of evidence pointing in the same direction. Like Forobosco in The Duchess of Malfi, his name occurs in dialogue (I.i.19; A3), but, like the 'ghost' characters in The White Devil, it is also found in the stage directions (II.i.96; C3 v , and II.ii.35; D3 v ). In The White Devil these character names were taken as evidence against the copy coming from the theatre where the prompter would probably eradicate such needless complications; on slighter grounds, the same may hold here. This seems to be the limit of evidence bearing on the nature of the copy of The Devil's Law Case; in view of the literary directions, the one variation in nomenclature, the omitted entries and the 'ghost' character, we may say that if the copy had any distinctive merits, they were those of a literary rather than a theatrical manuscript. But this must be a hesitant answer.</field>

R. C. Bald, Bibliographical Studies in the Beaumont &amp; Fletcher Folio of 1647, p. 95. 50 This, and following discussions, of Crane's habits are indebted to the previous work detailed in note 47. 51 The White Devil has 2949, The Duchess of Malfi 2931 lines. These totals represent the lines of print in the first quartos; lines used wholly for stage directions, etc. were not counted and, when two or more adjacent lines of verse could be resolved into one decasyllabic line, only one was counted. 52 These figures, and all those subsequently given, refer to the text of the plays only; the preliminaries etc. are not included. The number of capitals is to the nearest 50 because it is sometimes difficult to decide whether a particular word is used as a title or not. The printing of colons in The White Devil is not always clear; a maximum computation is given from the Bodleian copy. The number of brackets denotes all uses for punctuation, a pair counting once only. 53 The references in The Duchess of Malfi are: 'neu'r' I.i.185(B3 v ), I.i.374(C2), I.i.376(C2), I.i.505(C4), I.i.557(C4 v ), II. iii. 92(E2 v ) (misprinted as 'nea'r'), III.iii.88 (H1 v ), IV.i.169(I3).

      <field name="heading_text">A Cavalier Library -- 1643 by John L. Lievsay and Richard B. Davis</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The long Parliament was prompt in punishment of its members who remained loyal to Charles I. One member from Surrey, Sir Thomas Bludder, was particularly obnoxious to the Puritans, for he had joined the King at Oxford and had sat in the Royal Parliament. In the spring of 1643 he was "disabled," and on 27 May "An Inventary of Goods &amp; Chattell of S r Thomas Bludder delinquent sequestred by the Committee appoynted by ordnaunce of Parliment" 1 was drawn up, presumably in preparation for confiscation or evaluation as payment of a heavy fine. Unfortunate as may be its implications of the knight's material misfortune, the inventory is an interesting and perhaps significant record of the household and intellectual life of the owner of the property. It begins with a listing of the furnishings of the rooms of what was certainly a moderately-large gentleman's house. Suits of armor, pistols, rapiers, bedstead curtains and matching window draperies, cradles, tapestries, hangings and linens, as well as wooden furniture, are among them. The contents were listed by rooms, the best furnished of which were "the Yellow Chamber," the storeroom above it, "Mr. Marshall's Chamber," "the close stoole roome," "The Mans Chamber," "Mr John Bill's Chamber," "the Blew Chamber," "the dark Chamber," "the Maids Chamber," "the Square Chamber," the dining room, the scullery, the pantry, the larder, the buttery, the parlor, the "scaled Garret," "the Matted Chamber," Sir Thomas' "studye," and the storehouse. In the dining room alone there hung twenty-four pictures of varying size. The study contained, among other things, one pair of embroidered slippers and one little cellar with four glasses for strong waters, natural concomitants of its many books. A great proportion of the inventory is taken with a listing of these books and others in the house. At first glance one may feel that here is a representative Stuart library assembled by a gentleman of some means, and such it may be. More than a glance, however, will make one question it as typical, for there are certain peculiarities among the titles themselves and in their places of deposit, and the inscriptions noted as present in at least one volume are indicatory that some of the books were not present as a result of Bludder's tastes in reading material. Some books were obviously once owned by John Bill, King's Printer, whose son John Junior now resided in the house. Others belonged to a Mr. Marshall, who also resided in the house and kept a more-or-less homogeneous group of volumes in his own room. And one chest full, almost all Spanish titles, reposed in a chest in an upper hallway between the rooms of Marshall and Bill. The individual titles and the groupings take on more significance if one learns something about the persons who possessed the volumes, both as individuals and in their relation to each other. Bludder himself is in many respects the typical Stuart courtier. Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, 2 many times member of Parliament, 3 farmer of sea-coals, 4 victualler of the Navy, 5 Surveyor of Ordnance, 6 collector of rent-fines under grant from the King, 7 he should have been prosperous. Yet we have evidence that he was more than once in the 1630's on the verge of bankruptcy or of imprisonment by his creditors, for the King in 1632 granted him protection for one more year with the stipulation that he was not again to request it. 8 He was apparently a personal friend of the poet and courtier George Sandys, who presented to him a copy of the elaborate 1632 edition of Ovid's Metamorphosis, 9 soon after the book's publication. And he was again representative of the courtier's accomplishments in his own lines "Upon ye death of ye Lady An: Rich," 10 which were included in a collection of tributes to the lady, most of the poems being from the hands of more talented gentlemen such as Sidney Godolphin, Edmund Waller, and Henry King. Sir Thomas Bludder was the son of another Sir Thomas 11 of Flanchford near Reigate in Surrey, the father, a London merchant of prominence, having himself been first commissioner of the victualling office under James I. 12 Since the son became a member of the Inner Temple in 1615, 13 he was probably born in the last decade of the preceding century. This younger Sir Thomas was Knighted at Whitehall in 1618 14 a few months before his father's death, 15 and evidently succeeded his parent in several royal appointments. Apparently he married three times, for there are references to Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Brett, as his third wife, 16 who erected a monument to his memory soon after his death in 1655. Some time after 1630 and before 1636/7, Bludder married Jane Bill (born Franklin), widow of John Bill, the King's Printer, for in the latter year Bludder's wife Jane's and "infant John Bill's" share in the office of King's Printer was confirmed to them. 17 She was probably Sir Thomas' second wife, 18 and probably was living at the time this inventory was made. Little more is known of Bludder up to 1643. Whatever punishment came as a result of his loyalty to the King then or later did not deter him from further activity, for in a report of August 1649 by the Council of State to the Lord General, one learns that he had been under constant surveillance during at least a year preceding. He was the ringleader of a group in Surrey which had the year before fomented a rebellion, and was now stirring up sedition at Epsom under the pretence of taking the waters there. And, states the Council, definite proof of his subversive activity lies in the fact that he and his well-armed friends at the springs "do not drink the water." 19 The year before, probably at the end of the rebellion, he had been imprisoned in Peterhouse, and on 30 September 1648 had with his servant been transferred, perhaps on some sort of parole, to the custody of a gentleman of Southwark. 20 In 1651 he lived in a section of Southwark called the Mint. 21 And on 29 September 1655, he died, having made his will on the 17 of July preceding. 22 Residing in the same house with Sir Thomas was, as we have seen, Mr. John Bill. This was John Bill, Junior, Bludder's stepson, and the son of John Bill (1576-1630), King's Printer. 23 As the family Bible listed below indicates, young Bill was still a minor when the inventory was begun, but attained his majority before it was completed. Evidently Bludder's marriage to Jane Bill, widow, some time after her husband's death in 1630 and before 1636, 24 brought to his household many of the books listed below. A brief survey of the career of the elder John Bill offers some explanation of the presence of certain types of books in this library. Born in 1576, 25 John Bill had been apprenticed to John Norton, printer, in 1592 and had taken out his freedom in 1601. Probably between 1596 and 1602 or 1603, he traveled abroad gathering books for Sir Thomas Bodley, 26 and we know that he regularly visited the Frankfurt book fair. 27 Bill was an intimate friend of John and Bonham Norton, and with them helped to finance the printing of the King James Version of the Bible, in return becoming shareholder in the King's Printing House. Thus from 1617 to 1630 Bill was one of the King's Printers. He died on 9 May 1630, leaving the greater portion of a considerable estate to his wife Jane, daughter of Henry Franklin. 28 He bequeathed to her, for example, stock in the Company of Stationers worth £320, and an annuity of £300 to be derived from the profits from his share in the King's Printing Office. Another member of the Bludder household, a Mr. Marshall, appears to have possessed an independent library. Since the great majority of the books in his chamber are concerned with the law, it seems not unnatural to suggest that the gentleman was a barrister. It is impossible to identify him positively, for many Marshalls were admitted to the inns of court 29 during the forty years before the sequestration of Bludder's property. The most likely identification seems to be with John Marshall, aged 28 in 1623, the son of John Marshall of Southwark, Surrey, 30 and admitted a member of Gray's Inn on 29 January 1626/7. 31 Perhaps it is this John Marshall who was a member of two commissions appointed by the King in 1638 32 to enquire into the unauthorized building of cottages in 1635-8 and into the breach of laws against excessive usury. He may even be the Mr. Marshall who appeared as counsel before the Court of High Commission in 1635. 33 Such is the somewhat scanty information concerning the owner or owners of these books listed below. The inventory is signed by Ed. Edmunds, Peter Wealth, and Francis Burrows, evidently one or more of them a Welshman. And this brings us to the questions of how and by whom the list was composed, for it is obvious that the persons setting down the titles knew little Latin and less Spanish, and that the Welsh background of at least one of those making the inventory affected the spellings. Though it may be that the list was made by one or more men glancing at the titles and setting them down, the absolute illogicality of spelling and of the re-grouping of syllables into incomprehensible new "words" make this method seem unlikely. We would suggest that one man read off the titles to another who set them down, one or both these men Welsh in origin, and both little or not at all versed in Latin—beyond the ability to recognize that it was Latin—and certainly knowing nothing of Spanish. Probably most of the volumes were collected much earlier than 1643, and quite obviously all of them were not brought together as the working or recreational library of Sir Thomas Bludder. Though the nucleus of the major portion may have been gathered by Sir Thomas in his youth or even by his father, the collection had been steadily added to with current titles up to the time the inventory was taken. In other words, the indications are that Bludder was a gentleman who collected books throughout his life, or at least up to this point in it. The nature of the "collection" deserves comment. Mr. Marshall's law books were probably the working library of an active or retired barrister. The presence of so many Spanish books is somewhat unusual, and the scrambled and confused listing of them, indicates, as we have noticed, the utter unfamiliarity of the recorders with the language. That these books were placed in a trunk in a hallway would indicate that they had not been as much in use as other books. The presence of these and other foreign titles in a Stuart library, in a period when travel on the continent was a usual part of a gentleman's education, need not evoke too much comment. But the fact that the elder John Bill had journeyed abroad regularly in search of books may account for the large number of them. For their presence is one reason for supposing that Bludder's library contained either all or a portion of Bill's personal library, or even more likely, the remainders of his bookseller's stock, or both. And the presence of so many unbound and loose sheets, especially of folios, almost unquestionably confirms the supposition that some of Bill's stock reposed in the house of Jane Bill Bludder. Again, the large Biblical element in the library is natural for the period, but one also remembers that John Bill had participated in the publishing of the King James Version. Actually there is evidence that as recently as 1641, Sir Thomas Bludder, acting in one of his official capacities, had been implicated in the seizure of a number of Bibles imported from Holland. 34 The nature of the large proportion of belletristic and classical works among the "Boukes that were in the litle house in the yard of John Bills" may indicate the tastes of the younger Bill, or perhaps, though less likely, may represent a repository of unused items from the elder Bill's stock or library. Thus we may call this an assemblage of libraries of Cavalier gentlemen rather than a Cavalier gentleman's library, for here are represented the tastes of Bludder and Marshall and perhaps young Bill, and something of the stock in trade of the elder Bill, printer to the King and an active bookseller who supplied the needs of many of the nobles and notables of the Stuart period. 35 An Inuentary of Goods &amp; Chattell of S r Thomas Bludder delinquent Sequestred by the Committee appoynted by ordnaunce of Parliment The 27 of May 1643/ x x x x x x In the Square Chamber. x x x x x 1] Two mapps of Europe one of the King's of England genoligies [The genealogy referred to may possibly be STC 12872: George Owen Harry, The genealogy of James, King of great Brittayne .] 2] 2 Circuler mapps 3] one spanish Mapp of the world one other Mappe of the world 4] one other mapp of the world 4 severall p ts of the world In 5] 4 Mapps one mapp of the spanish fleete agaynst England 6] &amp; holland one Mapp of heidlebourrough two Mapps of 7] germany. one Mapp of the Low Contreys one small 8] mapp of aMerica one small mapp of England Scotland &amp; 9] Ireland one small mapp of ffrance one small mapp of 10] Jeneuah 4 other Mapps of the Liberall arts. x x x x x x Glasses. 11] Two Large Church bibles in English 12] one large Church bible 13] one Large bible in welch 14] one bible in folio 15] the whole booke of Martiris in to great uolumes.

Does the form of entry, for instance, imply that Nos. 67 and 68 are bound together ? And if so, is the same true of Nos. 66 and 67 ? They would be so found in one volume in the Lownes folio of 1613 (-1611). No edition of The Shepheardes Calender is known which also contains a "booke of English Poetts"; and the title of No. 68—if it is a title—is unrecorded in the STC . What may be intended, of course, is some separate collected work such as Robert Allott's Englands Parnassus; or the Choysest Flowers of our Modern Poets, 1600; STC 378-380. But this particular juxtaposition of entries tempts speculation in another direction. Are we here dealing with a printed form, unrecorded and now lost, of Spenser's own work, The English Poet, mentioned by E.K. in The Shepheardes Calender ? Or could the elder John Bill somehow have come into possession of the poet's original MS of this lost work and have had it bound, appropriately, with a copy of The Shepheardes Calender ? How gladly could we spare the rest of the list had our delinquent recorders been only less delinquent here ! [ a ] All things considered, however, it seems best to take these three items as one—a blundering misreading of the 1611-(1613) Lownes folio t.-p.: The Faerie Queen: The Shepheards Calendar: Together with the other Works of England's Arch-Poët, Edm.

The wording of this entry is such as to apply equally well to either of the first two English translations: Barclay his Argenis, tr. K. Long (edd. 1625, 1636) and J. Barclay his Argenis, tr. Sir R. Le Grys and T. May (edd. 1628, 1629). Cf.

John Jewel, Apologia Ecclesiœ Anglicanœ (see No. 40, above); or it may be Walter Travers, Vindiciœ Ecclesiœ Anglicanœ, 1630 ( STC 24188). But, since the item is listed in the 1632 transfer of stock, it seems most likely to be Richard Mocket, Doctrina et Politia Ecclesiœ Anglicanœ, edd. ("apud J.

A more likely candidate is Bp. John Abernethy, A Christian and Heavenly Treatise Containing Physicke for the Soule, edd. 1615, 1622, 1630; STC 73-75. Arber, Transcript, IV, 200, under date "7 Julij 1628" records an entry to "Master Beale" of "A booke called Phisicke for the soule, translated out of Ffrench by George Guilliam."

Presumably this is a reference to the Third Volume, issued by Haviland, 1631 ( STC 19653), though, as it was customary to issue the works of this famous preacher in three volumes, the reference may be to the third volume of some earlier edition (cf. STC 19649-19652). Or, since it occurs among other legal titles, it may refer to some form of John Perkins's Verie Profitable Booke Treating of the Lawes of this Realme, numerous edd., 1555 to 1639; STC 19633-19645. The fact that the entry is in English makes reference to the earlier Latin edd. ( STC 19629-19632) unlikely.] 154] The Reports of S r Edward Cooke [Sir Edward Cooke (or Coke), Les Reports, eleven parts, variously issued, 1600 to 1631; STC 5493-5524.] 155] The Booke of Entrys [Probably Sir Edward Coke's A Booke of Entries, folio, 1614; STC 5488.] 156] The Reports of S r Edward Cooke [See No. 154, above.] 157] a Booke of New cases of Judge Dier [Sir James Dyer, Cy Ensuont Ascuns nouel Cases, folio, edd. 1585, 1592, 1601; STC 7388-7390.] 158] The fin: pt of S r Edward Cooke [See No. 154, above.] 159] Riders Dictionary [ SR, 283] [Bp.

Or neither ?] 169] Aristoles 8 small bookes a small dictionary [Obviously at least two works are involved here, perhaps more. It is not clear whether the Aristotle entry refers to a set, to eight miscellaneous small volumes of Aristotle, or to one small volume divided into eight "books", as would be the case with the Politics or the Physics —or a commentary on one of them; cf. J. Buridanus, Questiones in octo libris Politicorum Aristotelis (Oxford, 1640; STC 4120). As for the "small dictionary," in a list of legal works the title that naturally suggests itself is John Cowell's The Interpreter: Or Booke Containing the Signification of Words, edd. 1607, 1637; STC 5900-5903. But the description would fit equally well several others, such as John Bullokar's An English Expositor, edd. 1616, 1621 ( STC 4083-4084) or Henry Cockeram's The English Dictionarie, six edd., 1623-1639; 5461-5466.] 170] Littletons Tenneres [One of the many editions, in Norman-French or in English, of Sir Thomas Littleton's famuos Tenures . Seventeenth-century editions in English: 1600, 1604, 1608, 1612, 1616, 1621, 1627; STC 15719-15783.] 171] A Lawe Booke. a booke of the Reigne 172] of henery the 8 &amp; Edward the 6. 173] Gautabies Cases. 174] Magna Carta in ffrench [No. 174 is presumably STC 9270, Magna Carta in F., 1529 (= 1539).] 175] A Creeke Testament [About the only thing we can be certain of here is that the entry does not mean what it says. The book described was undoubtedly a Greek New Testament.] 176] 12 small bookes bound [together ?] in Leather 177] A Booke of Anotimye &amp; other small bookes [Since the Anatomy is described as a small book, it might be Alexander Read's The Manuall of the Anatomy or Dissection of the Body of Man, 12mo., 1638; cf. STC 20784.] 178] Diuers bookes of Accompt. 179] beside diuers Mapps in quires 180] Printed bookes of the history of the 181] Church of Scotland some bibles in sheetes 182] &amp; Psalmes unbound &amp; Proclamations. [The first of these items, the history of the Church of Scotland, might possibly be A Short Relation of the State of the Kirk of Scotland (by J.

The Institution and Life of Cyrus, tr. Philemon Holland, folio, 1632; STC 26068.] 189] Patry Rama Arethmetica Publius 190] Terentius or the woman of Andrews [No. 189: Pierre de la Ramée (Ramus), P. Rami . . . Arithmeticœ libri duo, in one of the various continental editions. The "Publius" obviously belongs to the next entry, No. 23894-23897.] 190: Publius Terentius Afer, Andria, evidently in one of the English forms; cf. STC 191] A Restitution of decayed intelligence. [ SR, 284] [Richard Rowlands ( alias R. Verstegan), A Restitution of Decayed Intelligence. In Antiquities concerning the English Nation, edd. 1605, 1628 (pub. J. Bill), 1634; STC 21361-21363.] 192] Trigonometrye Tully Cicerone [The "Trigonometrye" of this entry may represent Bartholomew Pitiscus Trigonometry, tr R. Hanson, edd. 1614, 1630, 1631 ( STC 19967-19968a); or it may represent Richard Norwood, Trigonometrie, or, The Doctrine of Triangles, edd. 1631, 1634 ( STC 18692-18693). What work or works of Cicero may be intended in the second part of the entry cannot be determined.] 193] A noting of Logicke 194] A Art of diallinge Tabara [Any of several titles would fit this entry: Thomas Fale, Horologiographia; the Art of Dialling, edd. 1593, 1626, 1627, 1633 ( STC 10678-10681); John Blagrave, The Art of Dyalling in two Parts, 1609 ( STC 3116); or Samuel Foster, The Art of Dialling, 1638 ( STC 11201). We conjecture that the last word belongs with the next entry.] 195] Logarithmica The familier Epistles ["Tabara Logarithmica" could possibly be a misreading for Nathaniel Roe, Tabulae Logarithmicœ or Two Tables of Logarithmes, 1633; STC 21151. As for the second part of the entry, among various collections of "familar epistles" then current, the most likely candidates would seem to be those of Cicero (in Latin or in English, STC 5295-5305), of Antonio de Guevara ( STC 12432-12435), or of Bp. Joseph Hall ( STC 12662-12663).] 196] Petry Rama Arithmeticos [See No. 189, above.] 197] heredias of Alexandria [Presumably this represents Herodian, Herodian of Alexandria his History, tr. I.M., edd. 1629, 1634; STC 13222-13223. Cf. also STC 13220-13221.] 198] Calli Peia arish store house [ SR, 284] [Thomas Draxe, Calliepeia, or, A rich Storehouse of proper, choyce, and elegant Latine Words, and Phrases, edd. 1607, 1612, (1613, 1618, 1625 : J.

W.T., edd. 1634, 1637 ( STC 12452-12453); or New Epistles by M. d' Balzac, tr. Sir R. Baker, 1638 ( STC 12454); or A Collection of Some Modern Epistles, 1639 ( STC 12455)—or a combination of these.] 203] Publius Terenty [Possibly one of the Latin editions of Terence published in England; cf STC 23885-23889.] 204] Abraham Collmitts of Dantes 205] The victory of Patience [No. 205: Presumably R(ichard) Y(oung), The Victory of Patience, and Benefit of Affliction, edd. 1636, 1637; STC 26113-26114.] 206] Les Amores delisandrie [This seems to be intended for Vital d'Audiguier, Histoire trage-comique de nostre temps sous les noms de Lysandre et de Caliste, edd. 1616, 1624, 1633, 1637. Alternative title: Histoire des amours de Lysandre, etc. Cf. STC 906-907.] 207] Pallas armata officiis mercii Collii [The first part of this entry may represent Sir Thomas Kellie, Pallas Armata, or Militraie Instructions, 1627 ( STC 14906); or it may be intended for G.A.'s Pallas Armata, the Gentlemans Armorie wherein the Use of the Rapier and Sword is Displayed, 1639 ( STC 3). If the second part of the entry refers to some book of "Offices", we have not identified it.] 208] Textoris Epistolii [Joannes Ravisius (Textor), Epistolœ nunc recens in lucem editœ, 1635 ( STC 20762)—or some continental edition of this popular work.] 209] Rones happynesse of Arte [Francis Rous (the Elder), The Arte of Happines, edd. 1619, 1631; STC 21338-21339.] 210] Epistola obscura viror [Ulrich von Hutten ( et al. ), Epistolœ obscurorum virorum, edd. 1515, 1516, 1517; and, expanded, in various subsequent editions.] 211] Isopi fabula a gramer a Play Booke [All we can be sure of here is the Aesop, which might represent any of numerous continental or English editions of a Latin text; cf. STC 168-174. If the entry is intended to describe a single volume, we know of no such combination. However, it is barely possible that what is intended is a composite of several school works by J. Brinsley (the Elder); cf. Arber, Transcript, IV, 117, 283.] 212] Justinus Marcus Sweuius [Justin Martyr ?] 213] Derections to Pray dialectica Joan stetony [Two works: for the "Derections", see No. 149, above; the second work is undoubtedly John Seton's Dialectica, eight edd. betw. 1545 and 1631 ( STC 22250-22257).] 214] Terencie donns poemes [Again two works. The spelling suggests a Latin edition of Terence; cf. No. 190, above. The second part of the entry refers to John Donne, Poems. With Elegies on the Author's Death, edd. 1633, 1635, 1639; STC 7045-7047.] 215] Marstores Workes [John Marston, The Workes of M r. J. Marston, being Tragedies and Comedies collected into one Volume, 1633 (2 issues); STC 17471-17472.] 216] Erasmus Roterdamus [For explicitness the entry deserves a place in The Praise of Folly .] 217] The Aucadamye of Complyments [Perhaps intended for Philomusus, The Academy of Complements, 1640; STC 19883.] 218] The bibles Epitome Compendius [Probably intended for Simon Wastell, Microbiblion; or, The Bibles Epitome, 1629; STC 25102. The last word may belong to the next entry.] 219] Altickes Aristo vulequis patencubus [A puzzling entry. Perhaps two works are intended, the first some compendium of the Politics (or Ethics ?) of Aristotle. It is just possible that the second part of the entry refers to C.

Le Grys, 1632; STC 24633.] 220] Mesins Cases The ffrench schoolemaster [Two works, the first presumably a law book, unidentified; the second, Claude Desainliens (Claudius Holyband), The French Schoole-maister, wherein is most plainlie shewed, the true and most perfect way of pronouncinge of the Frenche tongue, etc., edd. 1573, 1582, 1606, 1609, 1612, 1615, 1619, 1631, 1632, 1636; STC 6748-6757.] 221] The Gate of Tonges in Locked [Jan Amos Komenský (Comenius), Porta linguarum trilinguis reserata.

Considering the small number of plays in this inventory, it is less likely to refer to Robert Greene's The Historie of Orlando Furioso, edd. 1594, 1599; STC 12265-12266. For the Tenures, see No. 170, above .] 244] Augustines Confessions [Tr. Sir Toby Matthew, edd. 1620, 1638; or tr. W.

I, 1599; Pt. II, 1604), numerous edd. in Spanish after 1600. An English tr., by J. Mabbe, The Rogue, or the Life of Guzman de Alfarache, appeared in 1622; STC 288-291.] 258] fiue singinge bookes &amp; epigrams in spanish 259] Summa de cases de conciliencia [No. 259: Several works bear this title. It may represent a Spanish version of Astesanus' Summa de casibus conscientiœ (Venice, 1480); or Juan de Pedraza, Summa de casos de consciencia (edd. 1569, 1578); or Manuel Rodríguez, Summa de casos de consciencia, 2 vols. (Lisbon, 1594-95). And there are others.] 260] Prouerbies morales Heraclito [Of the many edd. of the Proverbios morales (1608) of Alonso de Barros, this seems to be that of Baeza (1615) or that of Lisbon (1617), both of which bear the title Proverbios morales, Heraclito de Alonso de Barros .] 261] Cuna fili pica discreta toli danda [This scramble presumably represents the Genealogía de la toledana discreta (Alcalá de Henares, 1604) of Eugenio Martínez.] 262] Biandias de Liskea 263] Teatro de la Dioses 264] Varias notisias importantis penis [Cristóbal Suárez de Figueroa, Varias noticias importantes á la humana comunicacion (Madrid, 1621).] 265] Eue Cretario dell Reu.

The second item might be Francisco Guerrero's Viaje de Jerusalen (an account, of unknown date, of a voyage made in 1588), though the earliest edition of this known to Gallardo ( Ensayo, III, 135) is of 1696.] 268] 1 Spanish sermon Preached before Kinge 269] Philipp, Lisbonall.

      <field name="heading_text">Notes on the Ballad Market in the Second Half of the Seventeenth Century by Cyprian Blagden</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To turn the pages of Wing and to let one's eyes wander up and down its double columns sets in motion trains of thought that are related to one's own particular interests. Here, among the 90,000 titles, are buried the publications of the bookseller one happens to be working on; here, if one can only pick them up in the right order, are some missing pieces in the jig-saw of book-trade practice. I found, during a recent use of Wing, that my eyes were repeatedly caught by the italics of certain imprints—of the group of booksellers, for instance, with shares in the big Law books; and then I found that P. Brooksby, J. Deacon, J. Blare and J. Back were names that appeared over and over again as issuers of broadsides, and then that there was an even more formidable group of ballad proprietors, F. Coles, T. Vere, J. Wright, J. Clarke, W. Thackeray and T. Passinger . When I looked more closely I discovered that these two groups, with one or two individuals like Grove and Gilbertson, dominated the ballad trade in the latter half of the seventeenth century and, moreover, that the second group (with which this article is mainly concerned) had a shifting pattern in which now one, now two or three or four or all six of the names properly—and predictably—played their parts. It was rather like working out one of those competitions which the London New Statesman used to publish twenty years ago; but instead of the red-headed non-smoker whose wife bid "three hearts" against her uncle the admiral, I had the names of booksellers, which might be those of fathers or sons or wives, and odd pieces of information like the date of a will; and instead of having to find the order in which eight people sat at two bridge tables, I set myself to discover the sequence of imprints—perhaps a dozen and a half variations—made from ten surnames, and to find therefrom a means of dating rather more closely the (almost always) undated ballads printed for the members of the group. The personalities are Francis Coles and his wife Mary, Thomas Vere, John Wright, his wife Mary and their son John, William Gilbertson, John Clarke, Thomas Passinger and his nephew Thomas, William Thackeray, John Millet and his wife Elizabeth, Alexander Milbourn and William Onley. The results of the competition I give straight away, and I suggest that any broadside with one of the following imprints must have been printed (but not of course first printed) during the years shewn in my list against the imprint.

Milbourn 1692 Before giving my reasons for these assertions I want to make a number of points and to rehearse a piece of earlier history. (1) I am not concerned either with the authorship of a ballad or with the dating of it by reference to its content. Much research has been put into this aspect of ballad literature but it can usually tell us only the date of first publication. That a ballad was composed in the reign of James I will not help us when we come to a printing of it that obviously belongs to the reign of his elder grandson. The vast majority of the ballads on which appear the imprints I have listed were ballads with a popular but largely non-topical appeal—tales of romance and Robin Hood rather than celebrations of victory and satires on politicians. Their interest lies, therefore, as much in their continued popularity as in their origins. (2) This section of the ballad market was profitable and copyrights were jealously guarded. There are many entries in the earlier Registers of the Stationers' Company to action taken against the infringers of such copyrights; the existence of the partnership may help to account for the surprisingly small amount of evidence of infringement after the Restoration. (3) The owners of ballad copyrights were not always booksellers of the meaner sort, as is sometimes suggested; they left tidy sums to their widows and children; they played their parts in the affairs of the Company, held shares in the English Stock and became Wardens; Vere even became Master. (4) I have found no evidence to support the statement, occasionally made, that the Stationers' Company had a Ballad Stock just as it had an English or a Latin Stock. Arber is right, I think, when he refers to the voluntary formation of a common stock of ballads by certain members of the Company, and it is with this stock that I am concerned. The original confusion may have arisen from a list in the Bagford Papers of "ye names of ye pattentes for ye printing of Balletes", a list constructed, I suspect, from imprints. I want, however, to make it clear that each member of the group was at the same time "publishing" on his own account—both books and ballads, both alone and jointly with other book-sellers, sometimes with other members of the ballad group. (5) It is essential for the proving of my theory that different printings of the same ballad should be found, one printing bearing one of the imprints listed above and another printing bearing another from the list. I have therefore taken as my key the immense entry in the Registers made in the names of Coles, Vere, Wright, and Clarke on 1 March 1675. From this list of 196 titles, 90 per cent of which are ballads, there can be found examples bearing all the imprints except two, the first and the last. 1 Some of the old titles may drop out; new ones are certainly added; but there is a hard core of common stock, and it is difficult to understand why a ballad bearing, for instance, imprints A and G should have been missed from the 1675 entry. (6) A few surviving copies of ballads, bearing imprints with which I am concerned, have dates added in manuscript. The Dutchess of Ports-mouths Farewel (B. M. Luttrell II, f168) has "20 feb 1685/4" in the handwriting of Narcissus Luttrell and imprint L (my dates 1684 to 1686). Anthony Wood wrote "1660" and "Sept 1660" and "1661" on three ballads (Bodley, Wood 402, ff 174, 176, and 180) bearing imprint C (my dates 1658 to 1664). All I can say of this possible aid to dating (as of the very occasional printed date) is that I have found nothing to alter the conclusions I have reached. I would, however, like to shew its very real danger by reference to a ballad called Loves Carouse which is dated "1674" in manuscript (Luttrell II, f133); this ballad has the imprint of Francis Grove who had been dead since 1663. (7) Just as I have deliberately avoided using the contents of a ballad as a guide to the dating of a particular printing of it, so I have made no attempt to use the evidence which lies in a study of the types and cuts employed in the printing of the ballads. What I hope is that someone with expert knowledge of this subject will think it worth while to work within the dating framework I have constructed and either prove my dating wrong or dispose of some of the overlaps. Even if this cannot be done, it would be interesting to know something more of the printers who were engaged in the printing of the ballads. (8) That a ballad was a piece of paper printed on one side only, 2 like the announcement of a Jumble Sale, does not mean that it rapidly found its way into (what I am sure was not thought necessary in the seventeenth century) the waste-paper-basket. Reading matter was too scarce and valuable; besides, there was not then the sharp distinction we make between bound books which we keep and newspapers and magazines which are almost immediately expendable. Ballads, of the popular literature kind, may be "ephemeral" now, but I doubt if they were so regarded in the seventeenth century by the purchasers for whom they were printed. "O sister," says Cokes to Mistress Overdo in Bartholomew Fair, "doe you remember the ballads over the Nursery-chimney at home o' my owne pasting up?" Fortunately for us, there were—among those who normally bought books rather than ballads—collectors like Selden and Pepys, Bagford and Anthony Wood, who rescued copies while they were still obtainable; and there were educated men who enjoyed reading them. According to Hearne (8 June 1711), the Earl of Dorset, "a man of admirable sense and understanding," had a fine collection of ballads which he used to read with delight for their "simplicity and nakedness of style", and the Dean of Christ Church was ready to spend a good sum for a similar accumulation. (9) I must record the immense amount of help I have received, in my chasing of ballads, to Hyder E. Rollins' An Analytical Index to the Ballad-Entries 1557-1709 ("Studies in Phiology," XXI (Jan. 1924). This is a marvellous tool and is frequently referred to here as 'Rollins'. In addition, the publications of the Ballad Society and Rollins' edition of the Pepys Ballads, though they do not cut out the necessity of handling real ballads, do reduce the number of hours so spent. Though I have taken 1655 as the earliest date for a joint imprint, I must go back to 1618 for what I think is the beginning of the story. The idea of Patents and Monopolies was in the air, and in October of that year Thomas Symcocke prayed the King to grant him a Patent for the sole printing of everything that was printed on one side only. This was granted jointly to him (though he had no connection with the printing trade) and to Roger Wood (a real printer) for 31 years on payment of £10 a year. The Stationers' Company immediately protested 3 but it was not until 24 August 1622 that James was moved to instruct the Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench to enquire fully into Symcocke's Patent. It happened that Thomas Pavier, one of those chiefly interested in the ballad trade, had been elected Renter Warden in July 1622; it looks as if he was enabled, by his official position, to compel the Company to make a stronger appeal to the King. 4 It is difficult to discover what followed during the next two years; the only certainty is that ballads still exist with the imprint "Printed by the Assigns of Thomas Symcocke". But on 14 December 1624, 128 ballads, mostly old ones, were entered in the Registers as the joint property of six booksellers—Thomas Pavier, John Wright, his brothers Cuthbert and Edward, John Grismond, and Henry Gosson. The family ties of the group were strengthened by the marriages of Cuthbert Wright, Grismond, and Gosson to daughters of Pavier. On 19 June 1625 there was a further entry of ten ballads. This entry comes not in its chronological place but at the very end of the pages for the year 1624/5 and is the first of a series of annual entries by the partners at about this time. The principle of private ownership in ballad stock had been firmly established so far as the Company was concerned. But Symcocke was not yet finished; in 1628 his Patent was renewed. The Company immediately challenged its validity in the Court of Chancery, and a committee of enquiry appointed by the King reported against Symcocke. Finally the Patent was cancelled by a decree of the Court of Chancery dated 30 June 1629, though Symcocke was to be compensated for his expenditure on printing equipment. Meanwhile Pavier had died (early in 1626) and Francis Coles had taken his place in the partnership. 5 By the end of 1638 Cuthbert Wright and Grismond were dead; 6 Gosson disappeared about 1640 and John Wright died early in 1646, leaving everything to his brother Edward, the last of the original gang. When Edward made his will in 1651, having probably already retired to his East Haddon home, he appointed as executors Coles and his cousin John Wright, hitherto known as "junior"; and on 4 and 5 April 1655, about a year before he died, he assigned a large number of Copies to William Gilbertson. Here, then, are three out of the four names in my first imprint; the fourth, Thomas Vere, only appeared as a partner on 13 March 1656 (in an entry in the Registers), but he always took precedence of Gilbertson. 7 Copyrights which had once been owned jointly by six booksellers were now owned jointly and equally by four others. How exactly this rearrangement took place is perhaps of little importance; but I should like to be able to answer the question, "What were the imprints of those 128 ballads which were entered jointly in 1624 and printed in the succeeding 30 years?" Arguing from later practice I would have expected them to carry the names of all the partners who were active at the time of printing. But I have not come across a single example of such an imprint, and it is extremely unlikely that they have all disappeared. On those ballads which might have been printed during this dark age, overshadowed by the threat or the reality of the Civil War, the only imprints I have come across are "By the Assigns of Thomas Symcocke" or "For" one of the individual partners in the ballad stock. The most interesting examples are those ballads of which there are copies bearing different imprints. A pleasant new Court Song, beginning "Upon a Summer's time, In the middle of the morne" (Rollins 1865), appears in the Roxburghe Collection as "Printed by the Assignes of Thomas Symcocke" and in the Pepys collection as "Printed for Ed. Wright". A pleasant Court Song was entered by John Wright on 19 June 1625 as part of the annual registration to which I have referred. Again, An excellent Ballad Intituled The Constancy of Susanna (Rollins 379 and 2563), beginning "There dwelt a man in Babylon", is among the big joint entries of 1624 and 1675; some copies are found "Printed at London for Iohn Wright, neere Pye Corner" and others for Henry Gosson. (Yet other examples have imprint O or "For W[illiam] O[nley]".) I can prove nothing, but the following hypotheses occurred to me when trying to answer this question about the imprints between 1624 and 1655:— (1) That the partners, either jointly or severally, were until 1629, Symcocke's Assigns—at least as distributors; Roger Wood may have looked after the printing. This is made slightly improbable by STC 19246 which has "By the Assignes of T. Symcocks, sold by F. Grove". (2) That from 1618 to 1629 Symcocke through unknown assigns and the partners (individually until 1624 and thereafter together) were issuing the same ballads in opposition to each other. But these two alternatives only take us to 1629; and how were chapmen to know where to collect supplies of Symcocke's printings? (3) That, after the withdrawal of Symcocke in 1629, the partners issued a ballad not with a joint imprint but with the imprint of that member of the group who had first claim to its copyright, and that the main purpose of the group was not so much manufacture (and copyright protection) as distribution. (4) That—as a variation of (3)—each partner received his share of a printing with only his name in the imprint. (5) That the Wright and Gosson imprints quoted above belong to the pre-Symcocke period (or at least to the pre-1624 period). But this leaves the post-1629 period quite empty and I can only repeat that it is extremely unlikely—even allowing for the impact of the Civil War and the Puritan attitude to the singing of ballads—that no ballads registered by the partners were issued between 1629 and 1655 or that, if they were issued, none have survived. Further variations and extensions of these possibilities could be devised, but until more evidence comes to light the verdict must be left open. In view of the existence of seventeenth-century partnership books, identical in every way except that they bear different imprints for different partners, I favour alternative (4) combined with alternative (2). But I must leave speculation and produce my evidence for the imprints. A.) Printed for F. Coles, J. Wright, T. Vere, and W. Gilbertson 1655-1658 On 13 March 1656 these four entered 28 ballads, at least ten of which had been entered at various times before. This entry, like Francis Grove's of 25 the day before, was an abnormally large one and suggests either a renewal of publishing activity (a view which a sudden outcrop of booksellers' catalogues at this date supports), or a threat of infringement, or (though not with Grove) a settling down to a new partnership arrangement. Perhaps it was a bit of each. Since John Wright was buried on 11 May 1658 (Smyth's Obituary, Camden Soc., 1849, p. 47), the end of the imprint is certain; and since very few ballads have survived with this set of names I have not put the earliest date further back than 1655, which gives the partnership nearly fifteen months before the first entry in the Registers; moreover, 1655 was the year in which Edward Wright assigned a number of copyrights to Gilbertson. 8 Martin Parker's The distressed Virgin (B.M.c.20.f.14, no. 11) has this imprint. It was entered to the partners on 1 June 1629 and in the Crawford Collection there is a version with imprint G; STC 19228 is for Coles alone. It is surprising not to find it in the 1675 entry when it was obviously part of the ballad stock. B.) Printed for F. Coles, M. Wright, T. Vere, and W. Gilbertson 1658 Mary, the widow of John Wright, was left with two youngish boys, the elder of whom (another John: how often one wishes for a little more imagination in the choosing of Christian names!) was made free of the Stationers' Company by patrimony on 5 October 1663. His mother kept on the business and may have intended to take his father's place in the ballad partnership until young John could step in. The other partners, perhaps, thought otherwise; none of them is, oddly enough, mentioned in the will. By 26 July the name of Wright has dropped out of the partnership entries in the Registers. The ranting whores resolution (Wing R 255, Rollins 2238) is one of the very few ballads with this imprint; it appears in the Roxburghe Collection, dated 1672, with imprint E. 9 C.) Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, and W. Gilbertson 1658-1664 Young John Wright was free in October 1663; Gilbertson did not die until early in 1665. I have, however, come across no ballad imprint bearing both his name and Gilbertson's. The only context in which the names occur together is The famous History of Parismus . On 9 August 1664 Gilbertson assigned ¾ of his copyright in this little book (which he and Francis Grove had entered together on 10 March 1661) to Coles, Vere, and Wright; the seventh impression is recorded by Esdaile ( A List of English Tales . . ., Bib. Soc. London, 1912) as dated 1664. That is why I think that imprint C should include 1664 but not 1665. Incidentally, Francis Grove's will was proved in March 1663 (P.C.C. 44 Juxon). He was a prolific issuer of ballads, many of which are in the 1675 entry; the entry and reassignment of Parismus suggests that his ballad copyrights may have found their way into the ballad stock through Gilbertson. Room for a joviall tinker (Wing R1921, Rollins 2323) is an example with this imprint; there is another version (Wing R1922) with imprint H. D.) Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, W. Gilbertson, and J. Wright 1663-1665 If this imprint turns up on a ballad, it must be dated between late 1663 and early 1665, since Gilbertson 10 died between 29 March and 15 April of the latter year and Wright was not free until the Autumn of 1663. It must be remembered, however, that copyrights in the ballad stock were treated as separate from a bookseller's normal copyrights in books and that a partnership imprint on a book is no argument for a similar ballad imprint. E.) Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, and J. Wright 1663-1674 Though the partners, except perhaps for Pavier, seem to have survived the various outbreaks of the plague, they suffered badly in the fire of 1666. The members of the 1624 group had had shops in or around Newgate Street, except for Henry Gosson who was on London Bridge, the other main centre of the ballad trade. In 1666 the three partners were all in the Old Bailey. They were burnt out but they did not move very far. Coles went to Vine Street, on Saffron Hill near Hatton Garden, Vere to Giltspur Street, just outside Newgate, and Wright to Little Britain. Little Britain ran direct into West Smithfield; Giltspur Street indirectly through Pye Corner. It was here, in Pye Corner, that the Ballad Warehouse was finally located and it was here that the booksellers interested in the distribution of ballads congregated towards the end of the century. In spite of the disturbance of the fire a fair number of ballads with this imprint have survived. Pride's fall (Wing P3447, Rollins 2194/5) is typical. An interesting development of this period is the holding of a joint stock of small books as well as ballads. As Nathaniel Crouch was to demonstrate, the market was ready for something more solid than the single sheet. Samuel Rowlands' Doctor Merrieman, for instance, occurs as printed by E. Crowch for these three in 1671, having been printed by R. I. for Francis Grove in 1657; it also appears in 1681 with imprint G and is one of the last entries in 1675 (Wing R2081/3; since it is not a ballad there is no reference in Rollins). A similar entry is Hey for Horn Fair, of which the only edition given by Wing (H1658A) has this imprint and is dated 1674. John Clarke, therefore, who on 27 January 1673 entered some ballads which were afterwards absorbed into the partnership stock, was certainly not one of the group before 1674; whether or not he was during the year I do not know, but we must allow the possibility; just as we must allow the possibility of Gilbertson's being out and Wright in during 1663. F.) Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, J. Wright, and J. Clarke 1674-1679 We now get to the most important entry of all, that of 1 March 1675 when were "Entred by mutuall consent . . . . (and by an order of a full court of assistants) to each of them the said Francis Coles, Thomas Veere, John Wright and John Clarke, severally a fourth part of all the bookes, Ballads and copies . . . . hereafter following. . . ." The 196 titles occupy five pages in the Registers, but there is no indication of the fee paid for entering. The order in which the ballads are listed seems to conform to a rough pattern. Of the first 80, 70 were entered before to one or other of the groups of partners, four to other booksellers and six for the first time. Of the next twenty-five, fourteen were previously entered to Francis Grove, four to other booksellers and seven for the first time. Of the next fifty all but five (three to Grove and two to Jno Clarke) were then entered for the first time. Most of the rest are not ballads. It looks, therefore, as if the ballads were listed in the order in which they were acquired. Assignments were seldom recorded in the Registers and some ballads might have been first issued by the partners, or of course by others, without registration: many of the titles listed here for the first time must, almost certainly, have been originally the property of other booksellers. In the Bagford Ballads (Hertford, 1878, p. 1117) J. W. Ebsworth says that "before 1675 began the Licensing of all Ballad Singers for five years" was rented to John Clarke by Charles Kelligrew, Master of the Revels at St. Bartholomew's Fair; but he does not quote his authority. It is possible that the granting of this privilege had something to do with Clarke's joining the partnership. This partnership of four certainly lasted until 1 July 1678 when they made two entries in the Registers. Some time between then and September 1680, when Coles' will was proved, Thackeray and Passinger parted company with William Whitwood and joined the partnership. Until more evidence comes to light the dates of these two imprints must be allowed to overlap. In view of the large number of surviving ballads with the imprint of six names (at least as many as those bearing the imprint of the first four only) I am tempted to associate Vere's becoming Upper Warden in July 1679 with the introduction of new blood; Whitwood had, before Easter 1680, moved from the Smithfield area to the Strand, thereby putting the seal on his break with the ballad-merchants. A most excellent song of the love of young Palmus (Wing M2883, Rollins 1804) carries this imprint as well as a later one; it was entered in the Registers under various titles. G.) Printed for F. Coles, T. Vere, J. Wright, J. Clarke, W. Thackeray, and T. Passinger 1678-1680 I have already referred to Coles' death by September 1680. The opening date of this important partnership of six must still remain uncertain, but it cannot have been before 1678. The dying tears of a panitent sinner (Wing D2958, Rollins 658) will do as well as any other example of this imprint. H.) Printed for M. Coles, T. Vere, J. Wright, J. Clarke, W. Thackeray, and T. Passinger 1680-1682 M. Coles is Mary, the widow of Francis, whose name I have found on a few ballads only. The wandring prince and princess (Wing W700, Rollins 2842) is one and it is found entered under various titles. It is probable that Mary's name only appeared while her husband's estate was being wound up. It is possible that Vere sold out about the same time; there is an assignment of his to John Clarke dated 5 September 1681, though there is, as usual, no mention of ballads. I have no evidence that the name of Vere appeared on a ballad without that of Coles at this end of the partnership, but Parismus again provides the imprint on a book . Vol. I has imprint G and the date 1681; 11 vol. II has the same imprint and date, but without the name of Coles. Vere became Master of the Stationers' Company in July 1681 and died between the meetings of the Court on 6 and 21 February 1682, a few days after the death of Thomas Newcomb, one of his Wardens. There is a remote possibility that a ballad appeared with this imprint in January 1682; I have therefore included this year. 12 J.) Printed for T. Vere, J. Wright, J. Clarke, W. Thackeray, and T. Passinger 1680-1682 This is put in merely as a form of insurance and is on a par with imprint D. K.) Printed for J. Wright, J. Clarke, W. Thackeray, and T. Passinger 1681-1684 Though Vere did not die until early in 1682, he may have disposed of his holding in the ballad stock during the previous year. The end came with the death of John Wright between 1 and 20 October 1684. Tobias Bowne's The two faithful lovers has this imprint as well as imprint F and a later one (Wing B3898/3900, Rollins 2762). L.) Printed for J. Clarke, W. Thackeray, and T. Passinger 1684-1686 John Wright was a man of property and standing; he owned farms in several counties, houses in London and stock in the Stationers' Company. The overseers of his will were Thomas Basset, Richard Chiswell, Samuel Sprint, and Thomas Passinger, and one of his executors was a Doctor of Divinity. But all his children were minors and there was no arrangement made for retaining his share in the ballad stock. The next to go was John Clarke. He made his will on 16 August 1686 when he was "very sick &amp; weake in body", but he probably did not die till the year was nearly out. He was a widower with one minor son, Thomas; and I have the impression from his will that he did not get on well with his relatives. There is no mention of ballad copyrights but one of the witnesses was John Millet, the printer of ballads. As an example of this imprint there is A letter for a Christian family [?by John Vicars] (Wing V315, Rollins 1492), which also occurs with a later imprint. M.) Printed for W. Thackeray, and T. Passinger 1686-1688 I have included 1686 in order to be on the safe side, but the bulk of the issuing of ballads with this imprint must have been in 1687 and the first half of 1688. The bride's burial (Wing B4443, Rollins 238) will serve as a cheerful example. Passinger's will is the most interesting of all the wills because he specifically mentions "all my share in the Ballad warehouse of all the stocke and Copyes of books and ballads which I now have in partnership with Mr. William Thackeraye in a Warehouse in Pye Corner". These he leaves to his nephew and apprentice Thomas Passinger, with the instruction that the ballads are to be kept in print "as formerly in the said Warehouse" until the expiration of Thomas' apprenticeship. This should have occurred in 1690 but for some reason did not do so until June 1693. Thackeray had in the meantime taken over all the copyrights, perhaps when young Passinger came of age in 1690. N.) Printed for W. Thackeray 1688-1689 For about eighteen months Thackeray, the last of the six, had the field to himself. A most godly and comfortable ballad of the glorious resurrection (Wing M2892, Rollins 972) will stand as an example of the many issued by Thackeray alone. To him we owe the most complete printed list of seventeenth-century ballads that has survived (B.M. c.40.m.10, no.2). It is a sheet measuring 15¼'' by 12'', printed on one side only and headed "These small Books, Ballads and Histories undernamed, are all Printed for and Sold by WILLIAM THACKERAY at the Angel in Duck-lane, London; where any Chapman may be furnished with them or any other Books at Reasonable Rates." There follow six columns, 3¼ of which are taken up with 301 ballads. After a gap for adding new titles are sections for Broad Sheets, Small Godly Books, Small Merry Books, Double Books, and Histories. J. W. Ebsworth, in his introduction to the Bagford Ballads (p.liii), thinks this list was issued in late March or early April 1685 on the grounds that no. 170 of the ballads, English Traveller , refers to James II's accession and that none of the ballads issued later in the year, during Monmouth's rebellion, appear. I entirely agree with the first part of his argument, so far as first publication is concerned, but I doubt whether his second carries much weight in the Ballad Warehouse. Coles &amp; Co. were much more interested in the traditional ballad than in the topical; booksellers like Brooksby, Deacon, Dean and Bates put their names to the Monmouth ballads. I feel that if Clarke and Passinger had been partners in these ballads, as they were in 1685, their names would also have appeared in the advertisement, the normal practice when a whole block of publications is held in co-partnership. Moreover the title of English Traveller is buried, amongst old stuff, three-quarters of the way down the second column—not a good place for a recent issue. These are reasons for not dating the list 1685; my argument for dating it 1689 will come better under the discussion of the next imprint. Of the 301 ballads listed I will only say that the first twenty-one are all to do with Robin Hood, far and away the most popular ballad figure, and that a very high proportion of them are found in the Register entries, many of them more than once. It must have been a trade list compiled for use of Hawkers and Chapmen, and it is interesting to speculate how they carried a sheet of this size so that it was usable. O.) Printed for W. Thackeray, J. Millet, and A. Milbourn 1689-1692 The list of booksellers begins to expand again. In the Pepys Library, pages 439-443 of MS 2509 are a copy, which Pepys must have had made to go with his ballad collection, of "The present Adjustment &amp; Settlement of the Stock of ye Ancient Ballad Warehouse; with the Propriety &amp; Right of Print ng the same, 1689." 13 Ebsworth (p.lviii) refers to it in passing and calls it an Indenture of the Stationers' Company; it certainly reads as though it had been drawn up by an organization in order to prevent squabbling among its members. The preamble is so interesting that I quote it in full with the kind permission of the Master and Fellows of Magdalene College, Cambridge:— By Indenture of the 18th of January 1689[90], between William Thackeray, John Millet, and Alexander Milbourn, Citizens &amp; Stationers of London, it appears; That these Three being jointly &amp; aequally interested in all ye Copies, viz t . Books of 3 Sheets, 2½, Single, &amp; Broad Sheets, Tables, &amp; Ballads, express'd in a Schedule or Catalogue indented &amp; annext; and in all other Copies of Books, Ballads, Songs, Pictures, &amp;c a ., except as thereafter excepted; all which are said to have formerly belonged to Francis Coles, Tho. Vere, John Wright, Tho. Passinger, all deceas'd 14 , &amp; this Thackeray, in a Co-partnership now determin'd; whereby ye sayd Thackeray is become sole Proprietor thereof, and has sold ye sayd Millet &amp; Milbourn respectively two Thirds of ye same, excepting the Copies of the Historys mention'd in that Schedule, and those of Mother Shipton &amp; ye Protesant Guarland. And these three Persons being also become joyntly interested in several Reams of Paper, and quantities of ye said Books, Ballads, Songs, &amp;c a . already printed, being ye Stock belonging to the Ballad-Ware-house, &amp; to these Parties in respect of this their Joynt-Trade, are now become accordingly Co-partners and Joynt-Traders in ye same in the Messuage of the said Thackeray call'd ye Angel in Duck-lane, &amp; in such other Places as they shall hereafter agree-on for that Use. There follows a large number of clauses governing various aspects of the partnership: that the stock and profits shall be equally divided; that the stock shall be kept in and issued from the Warehouse, where the account books shall also be kept and be accessible to Millet and Milbourn; that all dues "shall be equally born out of ye sayd Stock and Profits"; that no partner shall dispose of his interest or introduce a further partner without the consent of the others; that the Ballads etc. shall be printed by Millet and Milbourn on paper supplied by Thackeray, and shall bear the imprint of all; that no Copyright shall be bought, no printing done and no prices fixed except by a majority decision and that the partners shall meet at least once in two months to settle accounts; that there shall be no printing or selling (save of the Thackeray Copies deliberately excepted) "but what shall be done for the Joynt Benefit of ye Whole"; that the partners shall not be liable for other partners' debts. On the death of a partner the others shall make up the accounts within 14 days and, within a month, pay his executors "a full Third of the Value of the Copies of the Books, Ballads, &amp;c a . belonging to the Partnership; the Whole thereof being now adjusted at 100 li , and 33 li 6 s 8 d the Third for the present Copys comprehended herein: And that all future Stock shall be reckon'd at 5 s the Ream for Paper, and the Cut or Half-Sheets, Broads, Songs, and Books, at 25½Sheets to a Quire, &amp; 20 Quires to a Ream" 15 . For assessing the value of Copies to be bought hereafter, two printers and two booksellers shall be chosen to value them, and if the executors refuse to accept the valuation they shall, provided they are members of the Stationers' Company, became partners for a third share. ". . . . In case Thackeray shall in his Life-time desire to assign-over his Share herein to his Son Tho: Thackeray, or that the sayd Tho: shall upon his Father's Death, desire to be receiv'd into this Co-partnership in the Room of his Father", the others shall accept him. Each partner bound himself and his executors in the sum of £200 to abide by this agreement. The Schedule attached to the Indenture might have served as the printer's "copy" for Thackeray's List described above. The only difference I have been able to find in title or order is under the heading of "Broad Sheets". In the printed version there are three titles; in the Schedule these three occur and Young-man and death has been added. This almost complete similarity is the strongest argument for giving these two lists the same date, 1689. The printed version may have been issued when the Chapman went out in the spring, the other compiled from it at the end of December, a few days before the Indenture was signed. An excellent ballad, intituled, The constancy of Susanna (Wing E3783, Rollins 379), which was first entered in 1562/3, will do as an example of this imprint, which lasted until Millet's death in the Autumn of 1692. P.) Printed for W. Thackeray, E. M [ illet ], and A. M [ ilbourn ] 1692 Elizabeth Millet was granted administration of her husband's property on the strength of a bond signed on 24 November by herself and Alexander and Thomas Milbourn. I have only found one ballad with this imprint, The Wanton Wife of Bath (Wing W722, Rollins 2962). This does not occur in the 1675 entry, but it was entered as long before as 1600 and it does occur both in the Thackeray List and with the imprint O. On 20 September 1712, almost exactly twenty years after John Millet's death, Charles Brown and Thomas Norris made an enormous entry in the Registers, which bears a resemblance to Thackeray's List. They staked their claim, a half share each, to 71 old Ballads, 6 old Broadsides, 46 old "Sheets &amp; half", along with a number of "Three Sheet Books", "Stitcht Histories", "Bound Books", and "Books in 32". With the reemergence of provincial printing at the very end of the seventeenth century, the metropolitan trade in popular literature had begun to concentrate rather on chap-books than on ballads; Brown and Norris clung to what was still worth preserving of the latter. Of what happened to the Ballad Warehouse during these twenty years I can give no account. I will, however, list the imprints I have come across from ballads of which all are included in Thackeray's List and all but two in the 1675 entry. I will also arrange them in the order in which I think they occurred, in the hope that someone may have evidence to prove the order right or wrong. I am unable to provide dates. a.) Printed by and for Alex. Milbourn at the Stationers-Arms in Green-Arbour-Court in the Little Old-Baily Elizabeth Millet probably only remained in the partnership until her husband's affairs were cleared up. Since I have not found the names of Thackeray and Milbourn together on a ballad imprint without that of a third partner, I guess that William Thackeray took the opportunity of Millet's departure to sell out to Milbourn, who tried to combine the functions of printer and distributor; hence the elaborate address. A pretty ballad of the Lord of Lorn (Wing P3322, Rollins 1547) will serve as an example. b.) Printed by and for A. M [ ilbourn ] and sold by (1) the Booksellers of London (Wing L264, Rollins 2677) 16 (2) the Booksellers of Pye Corner and London Bridge (Wing J764, Rollins 1301) Milbourn must have found distribution by himself too difficult; he therefore suggested that his ballads were available from the London trade in general and, when that failed, from the specialists in the two best known localities for the ballad trade. Even this must have been too vague, and he was forced to associate himself with a recognized wholesaling establishment, the Angel in Duck Lane—the old Ballad Warehouse. He may also have found the volume of printing too much for him. Hence c.) Printed for A. M [ ilbourn ], W. O [ onley ], and Tho. Thackeray at the Angel in Duck-Lane (Wing J1180, Rollins 1336) A large number of ballads with this imprint, some with Milbourn's and Olney's names in full, have survived. It may have started in August 1694 when William Thackeray's son Thomas was free; it certainly lasted a number of years, but I have no idea what happened to Thomas Thackeray. d.) Printed for A. M. and W. O. (Wing P2881, Rollins 2140) I have found very few ballads with this imprint, and they represent, perhaps, a period of reshuffling. e.) Printed by and for W. Onley at the Angel in Little Britain; and A. Milbourn (Wing D489, Rollins 495) Onley had two presses, one in Little Britain and the other in Bond's Stables, near Chancery Lane. Dunton, in giving this information, praises Onley's speed of work and his ingenuity; he (Onley) must have thought that he could run the distribution of ballads—from the well-known Angel—as well as the printing of them. The small number of surviving ballads with this imprint suggests that he was quicker to discover his mistake than old Milbourn. Onley's enterprise and ingenuity also led him to infringe copy-rights (see Plomer's Dictionary, 1668-1725 ), and his entry into the ballad partnership may have been due to a threat of this. The Milbourn here must be a young Milbourn, but I have not been able to trace him in the Stationers' Company records; nor have I been able to find evidence for the retirement of either of the Milbourns. f.) Printed by and for W. O [ nley ], and sold by (1) the Booksellers (Crawford Coll. 1179; entered 1656) (2) the Booksellers of Pye Corner and London-bridge (Wing E3785, Rollins 2786) (3) J. Deacon, at the Angel in Guil-spur-street (Wing P448, Rollins 2882) (4) C. Bates at the Bible and Sun in Pye Corner (Wing K698, Rollins 1384) (5) J. Conyers in Leicester-field (Wing D969, Rollins 2510) After young Thackeray's retirement and the printers' short attempt to distribute by themselves, Onley and Milbourn went through the same sort of rigmarole as old Milbourn had tried some years earlier—general trade, ballad trade, and then individual booksellers known to be expert in this kind of distribution. It would be interesting to know what extra terms Bates and the others insisted on. It is worth noting, as a pointer to the specialization in this kind of business, that Mary Wright trained Jonah Deacon, who in turn trained Charles Bates, and that Joshua Conyers was free of the Company by patrimony. I have no evidence to suggest a chronological significance in the variations of this imprint; they may have been tried concurrently, but I have come across no example to suggest that some copies of the same printing of a ballad had "to be sold by J. Deacon" while others had "to be sold by C. Bates", as might have happened before 1655. g.) Printed by and for W [ illiam ] O [ nley ] and sold by (1) the Booksellers of Pye Corner and London Bridge (Wing W697, Rollins 2835) (2) J. Blare on London-Bridge (Wing P3446, Rollins 2195) (3) B. Deacon, at the Angel in Gilt-spur-street (Wing U88, Rollins 2007) (4) C. Bates in Pye Corner (Wing M242, Rollins 1615) (5) B. Deacon, in Guiltspur-street, and C. Bates, in Pye Corner (Wing P435, Rollins 395) Alternative (1) is by far the most fully represented of these imprints. The only other comments are that J. Blare died in 1706 (will proved 3 Dec., P.C.C. 225 Eedes), and that Bridget Deacon has taken the place of Jonah, who was dead by 1704. [h.) Printed by and for W. O. for T. Norris, at the Looking-glass on London-bridge This is put in, in brackets, as a possible bridge to Norris. The one example I have found of this imprint (Crawford Coll. 258) is not in Rollins nor in Thackeray's List; the arrangement between Olney and Norris may have been purely ad hoc. ] i.) Printed by and for T. Norris, at the Looking-glass on London-bridge (Crawford Coll. 776, Rollins 2786) j.) Printed by and for T. Norris, and C. Brown, and sold at the Looking-glass on London-bridge Norris and Brown had taken the cream of the old Ballad Warehouse stock, and the Registers prove the continuity of the inheritance. But the glory has departed; you cannot expect to live on your capital for ever. Coles &amp; Co. were essentially Black-Letter merchants who pinned their faith to the conservatism of ordinary people; unlike Brooksby and his partners, they were not interested in the topical and did little to keep their list up-to-date. When people turned against Black Letter at the end of the seventeenth century, their business, as carried on by their successors, was really finished. There was, of course, no nice clean ending; it guttered out in the stronger light of the eighteenth-century chap-book and the purely topical ballad. William Thackeray was the last of the old gang and, owing to the luck of surviving documents, the most interesting to us I can find no evidence for his departure, nor for his son's. Perhaps they saw the writing on the wall and retired while the going was good; perhaps they just died. Some one else may be able to supply evidence of one or the other. In conclusion, I should like to repeat that I began this study because certain partnership imprints in Wing caught my eye. I have traced the existence, for upwards of 40 years, of a healthy partnership which was almost entirely concerned with the issuing of a single kind of publication. Whether the Ballad Partnership was ever called a "Conger" (as similar groups of booksellers were called in the eighteenth century), or whether the founders of the Printing Conger knew anything of the working of the Ballad Warehouse, I do not know. But the idea was in the air, and what was successful over a narrow publishing field was later adapted for the manufacture and sale of a wide variety of useful books.

I group here the evidence I have been able to collect about the early training of the booksellers involved in this storv. Two points of interest emerge. One is the specialist nature of the ballad market; not only is there a strong family influence but the apprentices of ballad-merchants seem to be trained to become ballad-merchants. The other is the strict seniority which is almost always observed in imprints.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See below under the analyses for imprints A and P. 2 There are, of course, examples with ballads printed on both sides. These are not pieces of double value for the purchaser but exercises in economy on the part of the booksellers, who, from time to time, and particularly towards the end of the century, used up old stock for printing more popular ballads. 3 The official attitude of the Stationers' Company seems throughout to be somewhat half-hearted. The Court, at its meeting on 23 January 1620/1, solemnly rescinded an order of 19 May 1612 by which "5 printers onely should haue the printing of all ballads", and decreed "that the sellers of ballads may print their owne copies where they thinke good". 4 This is the story given by R. B. McKerrow in A Dictionary of Printers and Booksellers. . . . 1557-1640 (1910). But it appears from the State Papers (Domestic) that as late as 1 October 1618 Marin de Boislorée, the King's agent in France, was hoping to be rewarded for his services by the grant of this Patent and that he did not get it because he was a foreigner. 5 On 4 August 1626 Pavier's widow assigned to Brewster and Bird "His parte in any sorts of Ballads " along with other copyrights and "His Interest and title to any pictures and . . . . tables ." Many of these, including the pictures but excluding the ballads, were reassigned to John Wright junior on 13 June 1642. I suspect that the ballads were reassigned without registration—as, of course, often happened, particularly where partnership adjustment was involved—before 1 June 1629 when Coles' name first appeared in the Registers as a partner. At the end of the same month the Symcocke invasion was finally cleared up. June seems to have been the regular stocktaking time. 6 See Appendix 7 See Appendix 8 It is understandable that assignees were unwilling to go to the expence of recording in the Registers small shares in large numbers of ballads; and I think that an open assignment of books may sometimes point to a private assignment of ballads. 9 There are two ballads quoted on pp. l and lviii of Vol. VIII (2) of the Ballad Society publications (Hertford, 1897) which carry the four names of this imprint but with M. Wright after T. Vere; both are topical and can be dated, for first publication, to the Autumn of 1660 and the Spring of 1661. They never found their way into the ballad stock and do not contradict what I have said above. See footnotes to imprints D and H below. 10 Oddly enough, a few ballads have survived with the initial R instead of W for Gilbertson. Rachel was William's widow but her name, so far as I have found it, only appears on topical ballads not listed in the 1675 entry. One example, which cannot have been printed before June 1665, is The loyal Victory, obtained . . . . June the 2 d and 3 d 1665 (Bod. Wood 402, f. 96). The bringing in of the widows on ballads of current interest and outside the general run of the stock, is an interesting feature. See footnote to imprints B above and H below. 11 Printed off before Coles' death but with intention to publish with Vol. II late in 1680 or early in 1681. 12 There is a topical ballad in the Pepys Collection, Rebellion Given over Housekeeping , with the odd imprint, "Printed for J.W., J.C., W.T., T.P. &amp; M.C.", where M.C. is presumably Mary Coles. But it is not in the regular ballad stock and need not disturb the pattern. Cf. the similar Mary Wright and Rachel Gilbertson imprints referred to in footnotes to imprints B and D above. 13 How he acquired it is not known; that so few ballads listed by Thackeray, are in the Pepys Collection suggests that the acquisition was much later than the date in the document. 14 I have already recorded my inability to find a record of John Clarke as a freeman of the Stationers' Company. This and the omission of his name from the partnership list in this document suggest that he was free of another Company; but his connection with Killigrew would make him a useful partner. 15 I interpret this to mean that, while unused paper carried as stock was to be valued at cost, i.e. at 5/- a ream of ?510 sheets, printed ballads, etc., which were often sold by the quire, were to be valued at twice this amount, a ream of paper making two "reams" of ballads as reckoned by the partners. This would fit in with the agreement by which Thackeray supplied the paper and Millet and Milbourn did the printing—a roughly 50-50 arrangement. 16 From now on I will only give references to and not names of ballads which are typical of the imprint. Wing gives these imprints in abbreviated forms.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Chain-Indentations in Paper as Evidence by Allan Stevenson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is clear that any variation in the materials or manufacture of printed books may provide the analytical bibliographer with useful evidence. The kinds of evidence that prove especially useful are those whose variations are definite and measurable and whose manifestations are not overly ambiguous or complex. Within the past half-century a good many forms of bibliographical evidence have been noted and analyzed, and have proved their value, singly or together, in solving problems. Still, some forms of evidence remain for notice and trial. One of these is the indentations left by the moulds (or roller) in all laid paper. Anyone who examines old handmade paper can see the ribs made by the fine laid wires and the troughs or grooves made by the chain wires, and thus can distinguish the "right" side or mould side from the "wrong" side or rough side of the paper. 1 Nevertheless, no general use appears to have been made of a characteristic so obvious and omnipresent. These wire and chain indentations are in effect watermarks; and in certain respects the chainmarks are easier to use than the designs called watermarks. Whereas watermarks and countermarks have a way of obscuring themselves within the folds of quartos and octavos, or behind layers of type in the folio page, chainlines can be seen in any margin, if the paper is "laid". Their regularity can be observed, their spaces measured, their sewing marks noted, their indentations studied for the information they may afford concerning the making of books. Though most characteristics of chains persist in machine-made laid, their evidential value is particularly clear in paper made at the vat. Usually the indented side is immediately apparent, though not obtrusive: a thing to be determined in a moment's examination. 2 When the paper has thickness or body and the chain wires are heavy, the sunken lines are easy to see. When the paper is thin and the wires are light, determination of the indented side may be less easy, may take half a minute for decision. Occasionally, indeed, the investigator may deceive himself, for portions of the indentations may appear to have fallen through. The smoothing and polishing which papers received in the mills before being folded into quires and packed in reams no doubt contributed to such an effect. Also, paper that has been washed and ironed by modern improvers of old books offers a problem—particularly in title pages, where indentation evidence can be crucial. And a well-thumbed leaf of the Bay Psalm Book may not yield an answer so readily as a plate in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Ordinarily, however, when the indented side is not immediately discernible, one need merely hold the leaf below a good undiffused light—God's sun or a 75-watt mazda bulb—with the chains parallel with the eyes and the book or leaf tilted at an angle, so that a slight shadow marks the troughs. Then some or all of the grooves will appear, particularly in the upper and lower margins of folios and the fore-edges of quartos, where the chain wires in the mould approached the frame. At the same moment the pattern of the main watermark (if present) may become clear enough to decide the question. In uncertain cases it is well to examine the opposite leaf and other leaves apparently belonging to the sheet—though this recourse may beg the question at issue. It sometimes helps to consider the relative smoothness of the two sides of the paper; for the unindented or "wrong" side may seem a bit rougher to the touch or even slightly darker of hue, because of the way the light strikes the fibers. 2a But the grooves themselves are the more dependable evidence. They are, indeed, as later paragraphs will show, among the simplest and most reliable forms of bibliographical evidence. To be sure, their testimony as regards a leaf-suspect in an individual copy of a book may prove decisive just fifty per cent of the time. This is because the grooves of an aberrant leaf will either agree or not agree with those of the sheet of which it pretends to be a part. The percentage improves when other copies become available for comparison. Three copies raise the probabilities (of usefulness or variation) to seventy-five; and four copies offer an efficiency approaching ninety. Thus, despite their half-ambiguous ways, indentations are likely to prove helpful in dealing with some types of problems. These problems have largely to do with conjugacy; with cancels and other sorts of page-substitution. Such departures from the normal include resettings, mixed editions, sophistications, restorations. Beyond these lie more subtle possibilities, but they must await a fuller understanding of paper. So far as I am aware, there were no general rules or practices as to the side of the sheet which should receive the impress of the inner or the outer forme. Certain printers may have preferred the smooth side of fine paper for title pages and plates, in an endeavor to give a pleasing appearance to their books—though surely any such intention was rare in Elizabethan and Stuart times. Other printers, when preparing engraved frontispieces, titles, plates, or maps, may have chosen instead the rougher side, as taking the ink more readily and avoiding the small hazards of the indentation-troughs. Similarly motivated selection of paper surfaces is common enough today, and was known in the eighteenth century. But few can have given it thought in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. For one thing, the French paper then imported into England, whether because of fine linen rags or the finishing process used, showed rather little difference in the two sides of the sheet, apart from the indentations, either to the eye or to the exploratory index finger. Further, paper came to the London printer variously made up into quires and reams, the order of the sheets and their orientation being due to the nature of the moulds or the habit or whim of the packer. Some mills are supposed to have made up quires with the right side consistently outside the fold. 3 But in other mills the variations in the moulds must have made consistency impracticable. As always, paper was made on a pair of moulds, and these moulds varied in the position of the main mark—some pairs having their marks in opposite halves, some having them on the same side with one reversed or even inverted. Inscriptions in the watermarks sometimes read left to right with the indented side up, sometimes with it down. 4 Further study may reveal a measure of consistency within a particular region or mill; but there is not much to count on yet. And there is no need to assume that the ordinary warehouse man or pressman gave any attention to sides as he laid out tokens for the press. 5 Bibliographers need to familiarize themselves with the way the pages fall into place in all the common formats. 6 For instance, if in a quarto or octavo the first page of a gathering shows indentations, so will the middle pages and the final page of the same sheet. Similarly, any normal opening within a folded sheet will show the presence or absence of indentations in both pages open to view: grooves opposite grooves. Exceptions naturally occur in gatherings made up of more than one sheet or partsheet or in formats with a cutoff, such as duodecimo. As the chances are perhaps against a duodecimo sheet receiving its own cutoff (in which case $4 v -5 r and 8 v -9 r would match), mismatching indentations are hardly evidence at the openings where the cutoffs fit into the rest of the sheet. All legitimate uses of indentations proceed from the basic fact that they can be found on just one side of the sheet, that of the inner or the outer forme. Now as to cancels. It is apparent that if a leaf of a book has been canceled there is about an even chance that the cancellans will not agree with the cancellandum as to the side which shows grooves. In something like half the cases the cancellans will have an indented recto and the cancellandum an indented verso, or vice-versa. The cancel will betray itself by the fact that its grooves do not fit the pattern of the sheet. The device is not necessarily one to use if other signs are clear. There is no need to doubt a stub, which can be seen afar off; though a cancel may use the wrong stub or no stub at all. Paste too may be indubitable; though it may be used also to join gatherings. Watermarks can be a sure test, if they appear in helpful positions. When a literary detective is inspecting a quarto and comes upon a fold with just half a watermark, he receives much the same shock as when he bites into a winesap and finds just half a carpocapsa pomonella . 7 But sometimes watermark evidence is not present, as in a quarto or octavo fold when the mark is elsewhere, or in paper with no mark at all—as often enough in the eighteenth century. Then indeed any irregularities or sewing-marks found in the chains may be allowed to serve as distinguishing watermarks; though their use is made awkward by the presence of pairs of moulds and the fact that a sheet can be fed into the press four different ways. Or again, as Mr. R. W. Chapman has noted, the clue to a cancel may be faulty alinement, or a change of font, or a leaf specially signed, or (in the eighteenth century) a new press figure. 8 Such evidence may give warning more abruptly than indentations; yet none of it is more conclusive. For whenever the indentations in apparently conjugate leaves do not agree, one of the leaves must be a cancel—or some other form of substitution. In rebinding, stubs may disappear, alinements may be improved, and paste may fail or deviate into ambiguity; but grooves that do not match cannot be made to match. 9 For purposes of illustration old and familiar examples may serve along with the new. I have found it instructive to check a number of recorded instances, such as those mentioned in Mr. Chapman's little volume on Cancels (1930). For thus one may test the usability of indentations and the manner in which they complement other kinds of evidence. Among well known cancels are several in Matthew Prior's Poems on Several Occasions (1709) 8°, and particularly the two at A5 and A7 of the Dedication. 10 The paper is Italian, with some sheets watermarked IT or the leg of Gambino, marks small enough to suffer from the binder's plow. 11 In the Newberry Library copy the cancels are inserted as usual on stubs; but it is worth seeing how the indentations work out. Their prevailing pattern here in sheet A is inner; that is, they coincide with the inner forme. The grooves on cancel A5 appear on its verso, opposite grooves on the recto of A6; thus those on the cancel match those of the sheet, and they furnish no evidence. Those on cancel A7, however, appear on its recto, opposite no others; thus these do not match those of the sheet; and in this instance the indentations are in themselves sufficient proof of leaf-substitution. In the University of Chicago copy the grooves in sheet A are likewise inner; but here the grooves on both A5 and A7 are recto and fail to match those of the sheet. In this manner do the two copies, indeed the Chicago copy by itself, conclusively prove the presence of a pair of cancels. The stubs, as it happens, are obvious; yet they might not show in a manicured or tightly bound copy. A promising area of employment for indentations is books printed on unwatermarked paper, such as a good many demy quartos and octavos of the eighteenth century. The reader may find it worth while to check familiar examples of cancels in such books; as those in Congreve's Amendments of Mr. Collier's . . . Citations (1698) 8°, D6 Milton's Paradise Lost (Baskerville 1758) 8°, G7 H5 P1 T5 T8 X6 Z3 Z5 2D2 Percy's Reliques (1765) 8°, II, N7 U2.7 X4 Gray's Poems, ed. Mason (1775) 4°, 2K2 2P2.3 h4 Johnson's Journey to the Western Islands (1775) 8°, D8 U4 Chatterton's Poems, ed. Tyrwhitt (1777) 8°, c4 (Advertisement) Checking readily available copies, I have found that in three copies of the Congreve (one on large paper and watermarked) the grooves in the cancel perversely match those of the sheet. The cancels in the Baskerville Milton, on laid paper with close thin chains, are sufficiently numerous to provide instructive examples in almost any copy. Those in the Newberry copy show mismatches at G7, H5, T5, X6, Z5, and probably 2D2. 12 But some leaves are made difficult by the polishing or pressing which the paper has received, usually but not always on its nonindented side. 13 In Percy's Reliques cancels N7 and X4 have special signatures; but even where such signposts exist, mismatching indentations may give final assurance. Gray's Poems, being a quarto, with horizontal chains, provides two ways of using them in the identification of substitute leaves. In the Chicago copy sheet 2K shows grooves on the versos of its first three leaves, then grooves on the recto of the fourth; in which situation the indentation pattern is obviously inner, and the misfit in the pattern is 2K2—a leaf which is stubless in this copy. It is an easy rule that when three consecutive leaves within a sheet have their grooves on the same side (recto or verso)—the middle one is usually wrong. (The Prior volume already discussed provides an interesting exception.) Leaf h4 in the Gray (the first two pages of "The Elegy in a Country Churchyard") shows, in the Chicago copy, verso indentations that break the inner-forme pattern of sheet h, and so must be the cancel that goes with the turnover between h1 and h2. Naturally, this being a quarto, one finds that the chainlines of the cancels are not prolongations of those in their pseudo-conjugates; but one notes too that, whereas the break may appear abrupt and certain in the inner fold of a quarto gathering (as in 2K2.3 in the Gray), it may not seem so certain in an outer fold (as in h1.4 of the same). Going on to the Johnson volume, I have noted nothing special; but Allen Hazen reports that in his copy the indentations prove that U4 is a cancel. In this instance, though, the cancel-leaf contains a piece of watermark—an intruder in an unwatermarked book. 14 As for the Chatterton, there are clues enough: the Newberry copy shows a special signature 'c4' on the Advertisement leaf, an irregular stub behind—and indentations that do not match those of halfsheet c. Books that have been badly bound or rebound often exhibit no stubs. Recently in examining a copy of a book of rates of the custom house, The Rates of Merchandizes (1642) 4°, printed on a mixture of pillar and pot papers, I came upon a complete pillar mark in the inner fold D2.3—and also half a pot (the lower half) in leaf D1. Obviously this leaf is an intruder. D1 v , indeed, has one more line of type than D2 r , and the two pages are a little out of alinement; but the half-watermark is certain evidence, along with a mismatch of the grooves in leaf and sheet. The copy, belonging to the University of Chicago, has at some time been carelessly trimmed (with damage to marginalia in an early hand), and barbarously stabbed and stapled—so that any stub that may exist cannot possibly show. 15 Another cancel turns up in sheet I; and this time the indentation evidence resolves an ambiguity. Here the outer fold shows no mark, but I2 has the crescent top of a Norman pot and I3 the grape top of a Norman pillar mark. 16 Obviously one of these leaves of the inner fold is a cancel; but which? The two headlines of I2 furnish more than a clue, as they read "Rates Outwards." (with a capital O) instead of "Rates outwards." as on other pages of this section (I1-L1). 17 Along with them the indentations provide certainty: inasmuch as I1, I2, and I3 all have verso indentations (in this copy), I2 is clearly the cancel. The most instructive and amusing group of cancels that I have encountered occur in a late seventeenth-century volume of Irish economics: Richard Lawrence, The Interest of Ireland in Its Trade and Wealth Stated (Dublin: Jos. Ray . . . 1682) 8°. 18 It is printed partly on foolscap, partly on shield paper. The apparent collation is *-** 8 τ-3τ 8 A-F 8 G 6 H 6 2A-2F 8 (—2F8) 2f 8 2g 2 2G-2R 8 ; but matters are not that simple. At A8 v the book has one of the most delightful errata pages that I have seen. It informs the reader that, due to the author's absence from town and the mislaying of some papers, certain regrettable mistakes have occurred in the printing, and gatherings ff and gg have now been added, without pagination. Then, after a few lines of errata, comes this revealing Advertisement to the Binder . At the end of ** in the Epiſtle Dedicatory there wants the Direction, viz. Plebeius, gg the Quarter ſheet in G Part 1. is to be placed after ff in Part 2. Ee the firſt leaf to be cancelled, the laſt leaf of Ff to be cancelled, the laſt leaf of Mm to be the firſt of Ee, Nn fol. 195, 196, and 199, 200. to be cancelled; Oo fol. 213, 214, 217, 218, 221, 222. to be cancelled; the ſaid leaves of Nn and Oo being reprinted. This does not merely show how such terms as 'direction', 'quarter sheet', and 'cancelled' were used; it shows how the printer handled his cancel problems. Most interesting is the transference of the last two leaves of G to a point 122 pages later, and of 2M8 to a point 144 pages earlier, with implications as to the order of printing and the number of presses, worth looking into. It was the Newberry copy that I held in my hand, and I could check the manner in which the binder had done his assigned work. There are no stubs. As sig. G has six leaves and its cutoff 2g the remaining two, which would presumably be printed as the innermost or outermost fold, the binder may have used the same identical sheet for both gatherings, for the indentations of G are outer and those of 2g are inner. 19 At 2E1 the binder has not done his work, for the cancellandum remains with a slash down two-thirds of its length, and [2M8] also holds its original place. The latter comes startlingly upon the eye, suddenly intruding lists of Irish lords divided into columns of Protestants and Papists between pages of regular prose. The leaf is paged 65-66 and bears the signature 'Ee'. Both sheets, 2E and 2M, show outer indentations; and that is most interesting for the present enquiry. For, obviously, if, in this particular copy, the binder (any binder) were to move the new Ee to the position of the slashed Ee, the grooves of the cancel would not match those of the pseudo-conjugate, though (or because) the two sheets as printed were grooved on the same side. Thus, if the cancellation had been carried through, the bibliographer might have known the fact, in the absence of a stub, by noting the indentations. In this instance he might have checked the substitution by observing the watermarks; but this is not easy in octavos. The prevailing mark in the sheets affected by the cancels is a crowned shield containing six fleurs-de-lis, a type of mark not shown in Heawood and not easy to make out here. 20 The paper is probably Morlaix fine crown. Now, commonly in octavos using French paper the watermark shows mainly (or at least partly) in the outer leaves of the sheet as printed, that is in 1:4 or 2:3. 21 But the shield marks in the Lawrence volume are closer to the center and show altogether in the inside fold-downs 5:8 and 6:7. As it happens, the copy under analysis has the lower part of a shield in the cancellans 'Ee' (2M8), with no mark possible in the cancellandum. Thus, for one who has acquainted himself with the unusual watermark situation, the presence of the mark in the cancel (supposing the cancellation had been carried through) would sufficiently prove the substitution; but clearly the indentation evidence is just as telling, while simple and unconfusing. The five cancels advertised as in 2N and 2O are of more ordinary import. "The said leaves . . . being reprinted" would fit—four of them—into a single forme, print-and-turn, with the fifth using 2F8 or one of the missing leaves of sheet H; but the printer does not say this. In the copy at hand leaf 2N2 (pp. 195-196) matches the (outer) groove-pattern of the sheet, in an unwatermarked part of the sheet, and thus does not show whether it is cancellandum or cancellans. Leaf 2N4 (pp. 199-200) does not match, as it has recto grooves. It also shows the lower half of a shield within a leaf which normally has none; and it precedes a leaf, 2N5, which has the lower half of a shield, legitimately. In gathering 2O [Oo], also with an outer groove-pattern, 2O3 (pp. 213-214) matches, but the type-page is misalined. Leaf 2O5 (pp. 217-218) fails to match, and shows the lower part of a shield, as does the following leaf, 2O6. Finally, leaf 2O7 (pp. 221-222) has matching grooves—but poor alinement. Interestingly enough, it shows the upper part of a shield which seems to have replaced an upper part in the cancellandum— from the companion mould . As the two moulds are not easy to distinguish, at least in an octavo, one would prefer groove evidence or stub evidence were it present, the misalinement not being in itself quite convincing. Comparison with other copies may relieve this analysis of one or two ambiguities, and throw further light on the printing history of the book; but the volume is not common. 22 The study of one copy has served to emphasize the relative simplicity of indentation evidence over some other kinds. The most familiar cancel-position is the title-page. Many titles (in publishing history) have been second guesses, on the part of author, printer, or publisher. And various old titles have given way to new, when the publishing situation changed or a need was felt to pass off an old edition as new. Sir Walter Greg has recorded a number of instances among seventeenth-century play-quartos; 23 and Fredson Bowers will record a good many more in his continuation of Greg's Bibliography . 24 Yet it is possible that an occasional title-cancel has escaped notice—and that, indeed, reissues have been accepted as original editions. Thus it is wise (over the years) to watch the indentations in titles and their apparently conjugate leaves. Unfortunately, many of the conjugates were blanks preceding the title, and now the title is a single leaf pasted to the dedication or first page of text. But wherever (as commonly) the title was the first leaf of a whole sheet or halfsheet, indentations may in time bring to light cancels and the manipulations of booksellers. And this despite the fact that titles may have become soiled and the sides of the paper difficult to distinguish. I have made no important discoveries myself, but some one else may. 25 Some cancels of course are not single leaves. They may be entire sheets. Or they may be made up of a single fold, a pair of conjugate leaves. At times such a fold replaces two similar leaves, and at other times only one. It may be difficult, though, to decide just which leaves are the cancel. An edifying example occurs in John Hopkins' Milton's Paradise Lost Imitated in Rhyme (1699) 8° in fours. Sheet B contains a parody of Book IV, on the love-life of Adam and Eve, written in heroic couplets and doubles entendres . Perchance the poetaster had an afterthought, for the gathering is made up of five leaves and a stub, after this order: 'B' 'B2', unsigned, stub, 'B3', unsigned. ($3 is not ordinarily signed.) The pagination proceeds regularly up to 10; then 9 and 10 are repeated on C1. One suspects that 'B3' and the following leaf are a cancel replacing the excised final leaf of an octavo halfsheet, represented now by the unattached stub. The paper is probably English, of poor quality, and apparently unwatermarked. 26 The indentations are not easy to see, for the mould-maker has used the same thin wire for both laid lines and chains. Still, they can be made out, and they show that the grooves on 'B3' and [B5] match. In the University of Chicago copy both [B3] and 'B3' have verso indentations. Thus the ambiguity is dispelled, and one may describe the gathering as B 4 (—B4 + 'B3'.[B5]). If, on the other hand, the two-leaf cancel replaces two original leaves, several instructive situations arise. The simplest occurs in the replacement of the inner fold of a quarto sheet, where the continuity of the matter may have made the double cancel both "necessary" and feasible. This situation is illustrated in Gray's Poems (1775) 4°, where the cancel at 2P2.3 may be determined by a mismatch of its grooves with those of the outer fold. In instances of this sort, however, it may be necessary to examine a number of copies to learn which of the two folds is the cancel. 27 A more interesting situation arises when two conjugate leaves replace two non-conjugates. Mr. Chapman cites an unusual instance in his copy of Sir John Hawkins's Life of Johnson (1787) 8°, where a pair of conjugate leaves replace canceled F3 and F5. 28 As one of the two new leaves must have grooves that do not match the pattern of the sheet, the groove evidence in this situation will prove infallible, with the two unused stubs (if still present) calling attention to the substitution. A different sort of instance occurs in William Killigrew's Imperial Tragedy (1669) F° in twos. It is printed on pot-size paper with a small grape watermark, characteristic of the Morlaix papermakers. When Fredson Bowers called my attention to the possibility that M2 and N1 might be not merely a pair of cancels but conjugate leaves, I examined the Newberry copy and found this state of affairs: Sig. Mark Indentations Pages Conjugacy L1 None recto 37,38 L1.2: fold clear L2 Grapes verso 39,40 M1 Grapes verso 41,42 Probably M1.stub M2 None verso 44,44 N1 Grapes recto 45,47 Probably M2.N1 N2 None recto 47,48 Stub recto? O1 None recto 49,50 [O2 missing] It will be noticed that the watermarks seem to show nothing amiss: it is the mispagination that makes M2 and N1 suspect. Actually, the watermarks, were they unobscured by type, would tell the same tale the indentations do; and the latter plainly show that, in this copy, M1 and M2 are not conjugate, and N1 and N2 are not conjugate either. As the stub appears to have a recto (vertical) groove, it would seem to be the remains of canceled M2; but only the one stub shows. It is obvious, at any rate, that M2 and N1 are cancels—and probably conjugate. The spacing of the chains suggests as much; but some prying finger (it seems) has cracked the paper along the fold top and bottom. It will be necessary to consider other copies to make certain. 28a But the grooves, even vertical grooves, have brought us close to the answer. After this extended discussion of cancels it seems supererogatory to discuss other types of substitution. For they may be detected in much the same way—except that such signposts as stubs and special signatures will not be present. If the inner fold of a quarto gathering is drawn from a page-for-page resetting, either the headlines or the indentations may call attention to the mixture of settings. If the repairman or forger has cleverly used paper with similar chainspaces, he will hardly have found paper from the same individual moulds, and he may have missed matching groove-sides. If the sophisticator manages to avoid leaving just half a pot as unobtrusive evidence of how he made a defective gathering "perfect", 29 or even if he has luckily brought together the top and base of a pot from the same mould, he may yet have got the grooves wrong. The improver of old books can scarcely get everything right, such are the variations in paper and print. Other uses for indentations will be found, such as will ease the life of the descriptive bibliographer. Sometimes, say in a folio, he needs to decide whether a portrait or engraved title is printed on the same sheet as the printed title. Sometimes his question is whether a blank leaf at the front (or back) of a book is a contemporary endpaper or an integral part of the first (or last) gathering. In a folio in fours, if a leaf has been deleted from a certain gathering, he may be uncertain which two of the remaining leaves are conjugate. 30 When he is dealing with a thin quarto in which he surmises that preliminary and final halfsheets have been printed together, he will want to say whether they are "outset", that is, wrapped around the other sheets, or cut apart before gathering and binding. At least this seems to be a question in dealing with eighteenth-century books. 31 In such situations, and others that will arise, where the question is partly or wholly one of conjugacy, indentations should prove a useful tool towards settling it. One frequently notices, in descriptive bibliographies or in dealers' catalogs, open questions or guarded statements that might have been resolved by this device, particularly where several copies may have been available for examination. A good and sufficient example occurs in Sir Walter Greg's Bibliography in the description of John Fletcher's play Monsieur Thomas (1639) 4°, which collates i 1 A 2 B-M 4 N1. Greg remarks: "It is almost certain that the title is really printed on N2, either detached or folded round the back ( i 1)." 32 In this and similar instances the question whether the leaf was detached is one worth investigating, as it involves a point of authenticity as well as one of book-production. In the Newberry copy of Monsieur Thomas the situation is clear. The grooves on i 1 v and N1 r match, and the chain-extensions tally. And there is more significant evidence: the title page has a very wide inner margin, and the last leaf has almost none. Curiously, the watermark, which shows in both leaves, is mainly in N1. It looks less like a case of slippage than of off-center printing. But it can hardly be doubted that, in this copy at least, i 1 and N1 are conjugate, and that the fold is "outset". It will be well to examine other quartos in which a leaf appears to be wrapped around the rest. 33 Beyond these uses of indentations in problems of conjugacy lie possible applications to further questions of method in the printing-house. When the pressman opened out the quires, did he make up the tokens and the whole heap with the fold or crease consistently below? Moxon seems to imply that he did. 34 At what date (if ever) did he sort out sheets of fine paper so that the title page might be printed on the "right" side of the sheet? In printing halfsheets together, in "twin" imposition, was it the custom to print rectos beside rectos and versos beside versos? Early nineteenth-century printers' manuals seem to indicate that the contrary method was used. 35 That procedure would be necessary for outsets; but when were halfsheet outsets first employed? Was there a paper advantage (as well as a saving of type) for those eighteenth-century printers who favored halfsheet octavo and duodecimo? When the print-and-turn method was used, be it noted, the presses produced equal numbers of halfsheets grooved on inner and outer sides; and certainly at such times the printer was expressing no preference for the right side or the wrong. Such matters may be reserved for further study. In the meantime bibliographers will test indentations as a tool for settling problems of conjugacy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 "In hand-made paper the right side is that which touches the wire cover of the mould . . . The 'wire' side . . . is, therefore, the right side . . ." E. J. Labarre, Dictionary and Encyclopaedia of Paper and Paper-Making (Amsterdam, 1952), p. 227. 2 It is difficult to generalize about seven hundred years of paper history. Some early paper has indistinct chains but clear wire marks; now and then both chains and laid lines are thin; but the grooves in some royal paper of the eighteenth century are irritatingly obvious; and this lush effect has sometimes been achieved in machine-made papers. 2a 2a McKerrow remarks: "If one leaf has the smooth surface on the inner side and the other on the outer side, one is a cancel." To this he adds a curious note: "In the case of many kinds of paper it is, however, almost impossible to detect any difference between the two sides." Introduction to Bibliography (1927), p. 225. 3 "Flat papers are usually packed with the right side uppermost; if folded . . . the right side is outwards." Labarre, p. 227. That is, the quires are folded so that the grooves are outside the fold. But this rule may not have held general acceptance before the period of the machine. It is unlikely that any unopened reams of old paper exist, whose quires might serve as evidence. Yet more than occasionally a seventeenth-century book shows such a sequence of grooves in its outer formes (say) as to suggest the agreement is no accident; though other volumes show no consistency from sheet to sheet or within several copies of the same sheet. 4 In the sixteenth century the paper used in English books frequently has the initials of the papermaker reading normally from the unindented side (the inscription having read from left to right on the mould); whereas often in the seventeenth century a pair of moulds are so made that in one the inscription reads correctly from the unindented side, and in the other from the indented side (the letters or words having been reversed on the mould). See Allan H. Stevenson, "Watermarks Are Twins", SB, IV (1951), 65-66 et passim . These and other variations suggest that the "right" side was not regularly distinguished from the "wrong" side at the time. 5 Moxon's description of how quires were set out, opened, and wet for the press shows that the job was done in an orderly manner, and that homogeneity was possible or probable if the sheets and quires had been packed consistently at the mill. "Then taking the first Quire of the Heap . . ., he lays the Quire down upon the Waste Sheet, so, as that the back of the Quire lye upon the middle crease of the Waste Sheet . . . To place [the second] Quire in an even position, he lays the back of the Quire exactly upon the opening crease of the former Quire . . . In the same manner he wets [and lays down] all the Quires of his Dry Heap ." Joseph Moxon, Mechanick Exercises, ed. De Vinne (1896), II, 303-306; and note 353-356. 6 Besides the useful diagrams in McKerrow and in various printers' manuals, there are now some handy ones in Paul S. Dunkin, How to Catalog a Rare Book (1951). Mr. Dunkin uses photographs of opened-out printed sheets in showing the folio, quarto, and octavo formats (plates IV-IX) and clear diagrams in describing twelvemo by cutting and without cutting (plates X-XIII). 7 However, he must not be deceived by the smallness of the watermark or the tightness of the binding. A small grape mark, especially one off center in its half of the mould, may appear wholly or mainly in one quarto leaf; and the greater part of a small pot may be lost in the fold. 8 R. W. Chapman, Cancels (1930), ch. VIII, "The Detection of Cancels". This book grew out of several articles on eighteenthcentury cancels published in the Library . McKerrow also lists the signs of cancels, pp. 223-224. 9 Unless—fantastic thought!—the rebinder substitutes a cancel from another copy. 10 Chapman, p. 61. 11 The initials are fairly small and appear (as ordinarily in octavos) at the top edge of the fold; and the leg appears (as often in paper made by Gambino of Genoa) in the lower outer corner of a leaf. For an illustration of legs used as corner marks see W. A. Churchill, Watermarks in Paper (Amsterdam, 1935), no. 551. 12 That is, six of the nine cancels checked violate the groove-pattern: an efficiency of 66% for one copy. 13 It is evident that Baskerville's workmen consciously selected "wrong" sides for hotpressing, missing a few; and equally evident that they paid little attention to sides while printing off cancels. But, indeed, a number of cancels would be printed off on one sheet. 14 Sometimes the watermark in a cancel appears in an unnatural position, as in the fore-edge of a quarto or the lower edge of an octavo. A curious example of such a quarto is a tract at the Newberry, The Necessity of Parliaments . . . By a True Protestant, and English Man (1689), from the fore-edge of the title page of which an exceedingly long-nosed fool looks mockingly upon the twentieth century. The title, if not certainly a cancel, is at least a leaf printed separately. Similarly, a University of Chicago octavo, Horace's Odes, Satyres, and Epistles (1684), printed on Norman demy ( carré ), has a title page with a piece of the Arms of France &amp; Navarre in its lower inside corner. As the grooves in this title leaf do not match those of its pseudo-conjugate, the paper here furnishes two proofs of the cancel. 15 This quarto is not listed in Wing, though there is said to be a copy in the British Museum. Wing does list, E 920, an octavo edition of the same year, of which I have seen the copy at Columbia University. Both quarto and octavo were printed for Lawrence Blaiklock. 16 The pillar mark is a common type with single balls atop the posts and the letters IDB between them, as can be seen in sheets A, B, E. Cf. Heawood 3492 and 3532, which are larger. The pot top has a small crescent of a sort not found elsewhere in this book. As the pillar mark with its mate is the common mark in the volume, the pot top is suspect, though in itself insufficient as evidence. 17 I1 r , however, has a head title, and L1 v is blank. 18 Wing L 680A-681. 19 The center fold, G4.5, would seem the natural pair of leaves to print for removal and transference. Fredson Bowers, Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), p. 233, cites aberrant copies of Sir William Killigrew's Three Plays (1665) 8° in which a cancel fold printed as 3 G4.5 and intended to replace leaf 1 D7 remains in place, untransfered. On the other hand, Chapman cites a different treatment in Dodsley's Collection of Poems, IV (1755) 8°, in which it is an outermost fold that is removed. For at the foot of Z6 v is printed: "Directions to the Binder. The first and last leaves of this sheet are to supply the cancels in sheets H and K." R. W. Chapman, "Notes on Cancel Leaves", Library, 4th ser., V (1924-25), 258. It will be noted that whichever fold becomes the transferred leaves the effect is the same. In Lawrence's Interest of Ireland, Newberry copy, 2g is compatible with G whether it was printed as the innermost or the outermost fold, for the grooves fit the sheet-pattern either way. 20 Except for the six fleurs-de-lis it has the general form of Heawood 644. It is not like Briquet 1860, an Italian mark with six lilies but no crown above the shield. 21 Cf. McKerrow, p. 169, fig. 18. I am using the colon as a sign of vertical conjugacy. 22 Allen Hazen has kindly examined the Columbia University copy and reports that in it all the indicated cancels have been carried out. I am grateful to Mr. Hazen for this and other helpful information on particular cancels. 23 In his Bibliography of the English Printed Drama (1939-—). See e.g. nos. 78, 116, 148, 172, 210, 224, 231, 232, 245, 246, 260, and so on. Of these, no. 246, Chapman's Bussy D'Ambois (1641) is notable in having had its title twice canceled (1641, 1646). 24 Mr. Bowers notes these title-page cancels from work-in-progress: Woodward &amp; McManaway nos. 90, 173, 195, 278, 458, 477, 484, 493, 537, 656, 724, 805, 1079; and he has kindly listed other cancels for my investigation. 25 The most interesting title-page cancel that I have examined recently occurs in the Newberry copy of James Shirley's Honoria and Mammon (n.d.) 8°. (Greg 473b1, W &amp; M 1145, Wing S 3475.) The imprint reads merely " LONDON, Printed for the uſe of the Author." The leaf is a cancel, with the stub not visible but with its indentations not matching those of halfsheet A. The special interest of this cancel arises from the fact that, as Greg points out, it seems to represent the first issue of the edition of 1658-59, and the further fact that this copy contains a few alterations of speeches and directions, apparently in the hand of the author, which suggest production in the summer of 1658. The only other recorded copy is at the Bodleian. 26 English paper was being made at this time by a considerable number of mills. This is of a poorer quality than much of that made by the Company of White Paper Makers from 1691 on. 27 Any slight discrepancy in paper or print may serve as a clue: an intrusive watermark, wider chains, weaker tranchefiles (end-chains), heavier sewing marks, thicker paper, off-color paper, foxing; new headlines, type including new sorts, peculiarities of composition, a wider printer's measure: anything that bibliographical ingenuity can hit upon. For the want of such clues or such ingenuity, no doubt numerous cancel-folds remain undetected. 28 Chapman, Cancels, p. 14. 28a 28a These establish the conjugacy of the leaves. F.B. 29 T. J. Wise shows no concern over matching paper, when, for instance, he makes up "perfect" copies of Dryden's Marriage a-la-mode, and Nash's Have With You to Saffron Walden . That is, he uses the leaves, as they come, from whatever other copy he has at hand or can procure. See Letters of Thomas J. Wise to John Henry Wrenn, ed. Fannie E. Ratchford (1944), pp. 396, 458. 30 If two moulds and countermarks are present, there should be little difficulty. 31 See Philip Gaskell, The First Editions of William Mason (Cambridge Bibliographical Society, 1951), p. viii. He says: "'Outset' is a bookbinder's term meaning a gathering, usually of two or four conjugate leaves, folded round the one or more sections that make up the body of a book, just as the wrapper encloses a pamphlet." 32 Greg no. 558. 33 Consider e.g Greg nos. 563 (Fletcher's Wit without Money ), 527 ( Luminalia ), 568b11 (Mayne's City Match ), 584 (Goffe's Strange Discovery ), 761 (Goffe's Careless Shepherdess ). In the Newberry copy of each of these, except perhaps The Strange Discovery, there seems to be evidence that a leaf was folded around and not detached. 34 Moxon, II, 303-305. 35 E.g. C. H. Timperley, The Printers' Manual (1838), p. 24.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Handlist of the Writings in Book Form (1902-1953) of Walter de la Mare compiled by Leonard Clark</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It seems extraordinary that in spite of the fact that Walter de la Mare has been writing and publishing books for over fifty years, no complete handlist of his work exists. No writer is better known, or better loved, in the English speaking world. His poems, tales, and critical articles have appeared in many journals, in many collections, and in many languages. Much has been written and broadcast about his particular contribution to letters and, for the past seven years, he has been one of the most "collected" of all English authors. He is now eighty years old, and it is therefore time that a permanent record was made of what he has written in book form. It will be for others, and at a later date, to prepare a definitive bibliography, but while its subject is still alive, this particular honour should be paid him. This does not suggest that Walter de la Mare is waiting sadly on the shores of Styx for a boat to row him over. Indeed, he continues to write in all the full power of his wisdom and maturity, and the collector must still keep his eyes open for the occasional poem and short story. During this very year he plans to publish two new books. The last bibliography of any consequence was published in the now defunct London Mercury in its two issues for March and April, 1927. This was compiled by Miss Gwendolen Murphy, and though it had a number of minor inaccuracies, it was, at least, in the nature of a halfway stage. Previously, Mr. Henry Danielson had contributed a bibliography to The Bookman's Journal in its first series of "Bibliographies of Modern Authors." This was in 1921. But many years have elapsed since Mr. Danielson and Miss Murphy performed their valuable tasks. The position at present is that very few scholars, writers, librarians, booksellers and collectors are aware of all that Walter de la Mare has written in book form. Further, it could hardly be expected that Walter de la Mare himself should remember the name and birthday of every child he has produced. The present Handlist, in fact, has served to freshen his own memory and, once freshened, it was able to produce other information. This Handlist is largely based on the collection of the compiler though, obviously, much information has been obtained from other sources. So many have been ready to help, and on both sides of the Atlantic. The List does not mention a publication on Sugar, which was the work of Walter de la Mare in 1916, when he was employed for a short while by the Ministry of Food. Although it is known that this paper was written, the compiler has seen no copy of it. Neither was it felt fitting, at this stage, with one or two exceptions, to include periodicals in the List, but when a complete bibliography comes to be written, its compiler must not forget Walter de la Mare's contribution to The Choristers' Journal in 1889, when he was still a boy at St. Paul's Cathedral School, nor his very early stories in The Sketch (after 1895) and The Cornhill (1896-1897). The files of The Saturday Westminster, The Bookman, and The Times Literary Supplement from 1908 onwards will also have to be thoroughly scoured. Poems set to music, and pieces from Walter de la Mare's books reprinted in other books have also been excluded. Foreign editions are not mentioned, except when they are first editions or editions seriously amended. However, it should be noted that many of his books have been published in French, German, Danish, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, and Japanese. It is realised that this Handlist is a modest beginning, but it chief merit lies in the fact that, to the best knowledge of its compiler, it is unique. 1902 SONGS OF CHILDHOOD (January) 1.

      <field name="heading_text">Identification of Contributors to the North American Review under Lowell by F. DeWolfe Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There appears below a complementary index to the North American Review, 1864-1872, which every researcher working with the Review for that period should consult. It corrects errors which appear in Cushing's index, gives additional information, and makes readily available much material which is difficult to locate in Cushing. If for no other reason than for the exceptional young talent which practiced in its pages, the North American Review might be considered to have enjoyed the most important period in its history during the editorship of Lowell from January, 1864, through the April, 1872, issue. For the first four years of that period Charles Eliot Norton was the co-editor and in effect the editor, while Lowell, co-editor in name, was in practice a heavy contributor whose name was apparently intended to add prestige. This arrangement, begun a year before the Civil War was over, lasted on through the reconstruction period to 1868, when Norton resigned and Lowell remained the lone editor until he went abroad in the summer of 1872. Perhaps no other magazine of the century could boast of having men like Henry Adams and his brother, Charles Francis, Henry and William James, John Fiske and Willian Dean Howells as regular contributors, not to mention the work of Lowell, Norton, Emerson, and James Parton. Until 1868 all contributions went unsigned. After that time the shorter "critical notices" (we would today call most of them reviews) continued to appear anonymously, but Lowell abandoned the long-standing custom of calling the articles reviews, and with a few exceptions the articles were signed. When William Cushing, a Harvard librarian, prepared his Index to the North American Review in 1878 he had to determine the authorship of anonymous articles published over a period of more than sixty years. In his preface he expressed a modest confidence that his work achieved a satisfactory degree of reliability. When we consider the conditions under which the Review was edited and the resultant difficulties for an indexer, we can agree that his work is quite valuable to history and to the history of literature. There are omissions, however, and inaccuracies and contradictions within the index, which because of the importance of the Norton-Lowell period, are examined in detail here. Among the various biographers, editors, and bibliographers whose work has led them into the North American before 1878 we find, even in the case of some of the most recent, varying skills in handling the index. I have previously pointed out the fact that Lowell scholars have for fifty years overlooked a significant body of his criticism which was indexed by Cushing. 1 Several men who could have used the index to advantage have overlooked it entirely, others have used it gingerly, but so far as I have discovered only one or two men have tapped the full resources of Cushing's work. Because of the peculiar organization of the index, researchers who do wish to be sure they have found everything it can give them have to check individually every item in the index, which has duplicate and many triplicate entries, and this has to be done with a file of the Review at hand. To obtain definitive results they would have had to do what I have done in preparation of the complementary index below—re-index the period in which they are working. Instead of consolidating his entries as in the card catalogue of a library, Cushing awkwardly divided his index into a subject section and an author section, the latter itself containing a subsection. Under the subject index (which I refer to below as Cushing-S) there are single or multiple entries of what in Cushing's sometimes curious opinion were the more important subjects. These entries give the subject, author, and reference to volume and first page. In the main part of the author index (designated here Cushing-A) the contributions of each writer are listed by title, volume, and first page. In the case of some of the more frequent contributors, there are subsections under the contributors' names (designated here Cushing-C), listing by issue—not volume—number and critical notice number certain of the critical notices. Cushing's sorting of items to go into Cushing-A and -C is quite arbitrary, as is also his decision to include or omit any given item under a subject heading in Cushing-S. The omission of numerous items from Cushing-S, which are nevertheless included in Cushing-A or -C, makes it necessary for the researcher who wishes to identify the author of an article omitted in Cushing-S to check each item in Cushing -A and -C until he finds his title. Omissions from Cushing-A and -C appear to be accidental rather than deliberate, for they occur in about the same proportion with other mistakes. But since they do occur, the researcher would heretofore have had to check each item in Cushing-S to be sure that his work was complete. There are other sources of information, two of them unpublished, which serve to confirm, question or complement the information contained in Cushing's index. The Harvard College Library owns a memorandum book (referred to below as NorMemo) which Norton maintained during his editorship. He used one sheet to make out a working plan for the next issue of the Review, and the following sheet for a final record of the contents of the finished issue. He was not regular in his entries and a final table of contents appears for eight issues only, or about half the number edited by him. The records are quite neat and clear. Usually the table contains the roman and arabic numerals under which the items were published, a short title, the author, and the amount of pay. When this is the case Norton must be taken as the authority when he conflicts with Cushing. Sometimes, however, Norton omits the title, leaving only a number for the identification of the item. In such instances it is possible that he made an error by transposition in sequence. Thus the critical notices in the October, 1864, issue are identified only by number and his attributions of Notices 10, 11, and 12 disagree with Cushing and cannot be accepted as final. In one issue—October, 1866—his table of contents is not in sequence. He has grouped the critical notices written by each man, identifying them by title and/or author of the book reviewed, and has placed the amount paid the reviewer after his name. An unprecedented six out of twenty-four of Cushing's attributions for this issue differ from Norton's, whose record must be considered authoritative. Norton's record must take precedence over Cushing, even though Cushing and a third source of information are found in agreement. There is in the Harvard College Library a file of the North American Review (referred to hereafter as HCL) which has been inscribed with the names of the contributors. For the period 1864-72 the inscriptions appear in at least four hands; nothing seems to be known about the origin of any of the inscriptions throughout the file. Except for the places where Cushing contradicts himself, there is no such disagreement between Cushing and HCL as there is between these two and Norton. Since Cushing and HCL sometimes make the same mistake we may suspect that Cushing used this file or that his assistants actually made the inscriptions when compiling the index. However, there are many more omissions in HCL than in Cushing, and HCL occasionally identifies items (in inscriptions which were apparently made at the same time with the others), which Cushing leaves blank. Cushing later issued a slender Supplementary Index covering the two-year period 1878-1880 and containing a correction sheet for the previous index. In the complementary index given below, the information from the three parts of Cushing's 1878 index, from his correction sheet, and from the marked copy at Harvard has been consolidated with the notes in Norton's memorandum book and with other but minor sources. An author or title entry is included wherever it is necessary to make the information from these various sources instantly available to the reader or researcher. This complementary index identifies the authors of eight articles and notices not identified by Cushing; changes completely the authorship of six; throws doubt on the authorship of twelve and reports the conflicting evidence; clarifies the authorship of seven; and assures the researcher that information about the authorship of seven other items is not contained anywhere in the sources outlined above. Under the authors' names it lists seven articles which are attributed to them in Cushing-S but omitted in Cushing-A and C, and it enables the reader to determine the authors of 147 articles and reviews, or notices omitted entirely from Cushing-S. CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS FOR CUSHING'S INDEX TO THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW FOR THE PERIOD 1864-1872 (VOLS. XCVIII-CXIV) Abbreviations Cushing-A: Subdivision of the author section of the index in which the title is listed. Cushing-C: Subdivision of the author section of the index in which the title is not listed. Cushing-S: Subject section of Cushing's index. HCL: The Marked copy of the Review in the Harvard College Library. NorMemo: Norton's memorandum book. For convenience in listing entries, the headline in the Review is used instead of detailed information heading the article. This is purely a complementary index, and it therefore includes no cross reference or information readily available in Cushing's index. ABBOT, EZRA. See "Shedd." ADAMS, HENRY. See "Legal." Cushing's Supplementary Index (1880) makes several corrections in attributions to Adams. The only corrected item falling in the Lowell period is "Denison's Letters and Other Writings," CXIV (April 1872), 426-432. Mistakenly listed under Adams in Cushing-A, this notice is correctly attributed to C. M. Gaskell in both Cushing-A and -S. AGASSIZ'S JOURNEY IN BRAZIL, reviewed by C. E.

[This, and the review of Allingham's Ballad Book immediately following (pp. 316-318), are ascribed to C. E. Norton in Cushing-C and HCL. However, Norton in his memorandum lists the two reviews as by "G. N.," who received $7 for them. After the first issue edited by him, Norton never lists the amount of money received by himself or by Lowell. These two reviews are the only others ever marked by initials, from which fact we conclude that they stand for somebody quite familiar to him. Grace Norton, his sister, was an intellectual intimate of both Norton and Lowell and is therefore apparently the author of these two items.] ALLEN, WILLIAM FRANCIS. See "Gage."

Norton, XCIX (Oct. 1864), 622-624. [There is considerable confusion about the authorship of Critical Notices 10 (this review), 11, and 12. NorMemo cannot be accepted as absolute authority, since Norton in his notes on this issue designates the notices by number only. As he does not give the title, there is no assurance that he did not confuse the numbers. This review of a book by Ephraim Langdon Frothingham and Arthur Lincoln Frothingham is attributed to Octavius Brooks Frothingham in Cushing-A and HCL, but to Norton in Cushing-S and in NorMemo. If Octavius Brooks was a brother of the authors —I cannot clearly establish that he was—it is unlikely that the book would have been assigned to him for review. Critical Notice 11 ("Tuckerman's America . . . .") is attributed to Norton in Cushing-S and NorMemo. But Cushing-C and HCL attribute it to Lowell, and Cooke lists it in his Lowell bibliography. An allusion to a trip to Germany made in the review would have at that date been possible for Lowell but not for Norton. Critical Notice 12 ("Tennyson's Enoch Arden" ) is attributed to Lowell in Cushing-C, HCL, and Cooke's bibliography, but in NorMemo it is attributed to O. B. Frothingham. Internal evidence points strongly toward Lowell and away from Frothingham.

But HCL has an inscription "W. F. Allen," followed by an "X" after each of the three reviews. The authority of the "X" as an indication that the attribution is wrong is highly questionable. Cushing in 1880 published Supplementary Index . . . , which contained a correction sheet for the 1878 index. The corrections seem to have been made by the contributors themselves (there being several corrections for some names, and none at all for other names in connection with which some errors had been made). As there were two deletions and one addition under Allen's list, it should be accurate as corrected, and all three of these reviews are apparently by him.] GILLMORE'S DEFENCES OF CHARLESTON HARBOR, reviewed by Francis Winthrop Palfrey, CI (July 1865), 241-245.

      <field name="heading_text">The British Museum's Copy of a Rare Book From Brescia: A Problem in Dating. by D. E. Rhodes</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Giordano Ruffo, a Calabrian of the thirteenth century, who describes himself as 'cavaliere' to the Emperor Frederick II, wrote in Latin a treatise on the care of horses which was many times printed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It became the standard work of reference in its field, and more than one Italian translation was made. One of these, by Frate Gabriele Bruno, entitled "Arte de cognoscere la natura d' cauael" was first printed by Petrus de Quarengiis at Venice, probably in 1492. The edition of the same translation which is to be considered in the present note came from the press of Thomas Ferrandus at Brescia, who is represented in the British Museum's fifteenth century collection by not more than three books. His known dates as a printer (or possibly as a publisher only) are from 1473 to 1493, although evidence exists to prove that he lived on into the following century. The edition which Ferrandus produced of Ruffo's book on horses seems to have become singularly rare; there is a copy in the British Museum, but I have failed to trace one elsewhere in the British Isles, and none at all in Italy. The Museum copy, unfortunately, has had its date erased and a totally false one substituted in ink. This erroneous date, 1611, was long ago accepted by the catalogue, and it is now my purpose to piece together the scanty threads of evidence provided by the book itself in order to date it more accurately. As yet, I have not found the edition catalogued by any other major library. The book is printed in a plain roman type, which can be identified with Ferrandus's early 83R, such as appears in a Ludovico de Puppio of 1493, a copy of which is in the Marciana Library at Venice. It is however impossible to place the Museum's edition of Ruffo in the last decade of the fifteenth century (tempting as it is to try to do so) for the following simple reason: there is not enough space left in the place where the true date has been erased for the requisite number of capital Roman letters to form a date preceding 1500. The colophon reads thus: "Fato stampare per messere Tomaso Ferante in citadella uechia // apresso al conte Piero da Gambara nela cita de Bressa : nel anno // del Signore. M[DC.XI] del mese de Augusto." Of this date, the 'M' is printed, while the 'DC.XI' are in ink. There seems to be no good reason why the forger should have wished to substitute a date which is clearly at least a hundred years too late for the book in question. Thus for reasons of space it seems necessary at once to assign the book to the early years of the sixteenth century. There is enough corroborative evidence respecting both the publisher and Count Pietro Gambara to make this hypothesis more than possible. Luigi Lechi, the historian of Brescian printing, has shown that Tomaso Ferrando, the date of whose birth is unknown, after publishing several books between 1473 and 1493, was still alive but in penurious circumstances in 1498. 1 More than that, he was still in Brescia in the early years of the new century, as is seen from a letter which he wrote to the celebrated humanist Marino Becichemo, a Dalmatian from Scutari who had been educated in Brescia and who returned there to teach. The letter in question is printed in Becichemo's book entitled Marini Becichemi Scodrensis Elegans ac docta in C. Plinium Praelectio , Paris, 1519, pt. 1, p. xc : 'Sequitur epistola Thomae Ferandi Veterani Grammatici . . .' Now Becichemo, who was born in 1468, after studying in Brescia as a youth, returned to Dalmatia, and afterwards lived in Venice, where he achieved such a reputation as a humanist teacher that his services were invited by many Italian towns. It was not until 1502 that he returned to Brescia, and therefore Ferrandus probably wrote to him in 1503 or 1504 the letter to which we have already referred. 2 Count Pietro Gambara's dates are not known for certain, but several facts concerning his life are available. In 1473 he shared with his brothers the inheritance of his father's property and a house in Brescia. In 1486 he gave a dowry of 6,000 ducats to his daughter Paola, who was later canonised. Pietro married Taddea, a daughter of the celebrated family of Martinengo, who is said to have been still alive in the sack of Brescia in 1512. In 1504, she had become tutrice (governess or guardian) to her two sons Federico and Lodovico. 3 The date of her husband's death cannot be ascertained, but the inference is that he was dead when his wife took upon herself full responsibility for maintaining her sons. The result of adding together the above shreds of evidence is that the most suitable date which can be ascribed to Ferrandus's edition of Giordano Ruffo's book is at the latest 1504. This date, expressed in Roman fashion—MDIIII— would also contain the correct number of letters to account for the space caused by the man who so infuriatingly scratched out the true printed date in what now appears to be the last surviving copy in a public library (at least in Europe) of this particular edition. The present writer hopes that the publication of this note will lead to the location of a perfect copy, which will then give us further proof of the curiously sporadic output of Thomas Ferrandus of Brescia.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Deception in Dublin: Problems in Seventeenth-Century Irish Printing by John Alden</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the late E. R. McC. Dix undertook his catalogue of seventeenth-century Dublin books there were for him, apart from the recording of readily recognizable Dublin imprints, two problems: those of identifying books printed there with false imprints on the one hand, or, on the other, without any place of publication at all. A half century later, we as bibliographers, with a somewhat more sophisticated approach to such a subject, might do well to reconsider the ground 1 so amply surveyed by Dix himself, profiting from perceptions heightened by the work of men like Henry Bradshaw.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. In his conviction that numerous books had probably been printed in Dublin which bore false imprints, such as Louvain, Paris, or St. Omer, Dix assumed that the Catholics in Ireland surreptitiously printed books for their own use, as was done elsewhere. Curiously enough, experience has not supported that prediction, at least to the degree Dix envisaged. Yet he was not entirely mistaken, since there are at least three works of the seventeenth century which do bear false imprints. Of these, two are indeed Catholic works, albeit Catholic works with a difference. Thus Thomas Harold's Narratio facti, jurisque disquisitio, in lite jam vertente inter Rdos Adm P. P. Franciscum Copingerum, et P. Geanor bears for imprint "Parisiis, Permissu et jussu Superioris." A mandate to print on the verso of the title-page, signed by Copinger "in loco nostri Refugy [sic] 18 May [sic] 1670" provides a date not long after which the book was probably printed, while the misreading of what was intended to be "ij" as "y" in "Refugy" and "May" points to an English-speaking type-setter. 2 Typographically the Narratio may confidently be ascribed to the King's Printing-House in Dublin, in the year 1670 in the hands of Benjamin Tooke. For on leaves [A]2 r and A2-2 r (i.e., the recto of the second leaf of a gathering the first leaf of which is signed A2) is used a headpiece frequently employed by the shop, as for instance on p. 1 of Dudley Loftus's The Case of Ware and Sherley (1669) and on leaf [A]2 r of Benjamin Parry's More than Conqueror (1673). Also used in the Narratio are two decorative initials "I" and "C" of a sort less common, yet found on pp. 58 and 280, respectively, of John Stearne's De electione of 1662, while other letters from the same alphabet are found elsewhere. A companion piece to this Narratio appears to have completely escaped recognition, although it too is by Harold, and also bears the approbation of Fr. Copinger, dated 1670. As with the Narratio, in this work, the Tractatus de recursu ad protectionem principium in necessitate, contra violentiam clericorum, the imprint is given as "Parisiis, Permissu &amp; Jussu Superioris." In fact, although no positive evidence has been found that the Tractatus was actually published along with the Narratio, the sheets, apart from the first gathering signed A, are signed K-N, in continuation of the signatures used in the Narratio, while pp. 9-26 of the Tractatus are misnumbered 73-90, again a continuation of the paging of the Narratio . However, the sequence does not provide for the titleleaf nor for dedicatory leaves to Charles II (present in the Bodleian copy but not in the Grenville copy at the British Museum): one may hazard the hypothesis that the Tractatus was planned to be printed along with the Narratio, but that while it was being set up in type, the decision was made to publish it as a separate work. Typographically the two pieces are obviously from the same shop, with a decorative initial on the dedication leaf in the same series as the "C" and "I" of the Narratio; and that they are closely related is apparent. The interest of these two items is not confined to theology, for they prove to be of considerable Irish significance, again supporting the probability of Dublin printing. The controversy between the Franciscan Fathers Copinger and Geanor sprang out of the religious and political situation in Ireland following upon the return of Charles II. It will be recalled that while a group of the regular Catholic clergy, largely Franciscan, headed by Fr. Peter Walsh, was prepared to accept the political authority of Charles II, the secular clergy, headed by Bishop O'Reilly, were strongly opposed to the Remonstrance drawn up in 1662 by Walsh, embodying his views. Copinger and Harold, both Franciscans, had signed the Remonstrance. As a consequence, Fr. Copinger was replaced by Fr. Geanor as Provincial Vicar of the Franciscans in Munster, on orders from Rome. It is against Copinger's replacement that Harold is here writing, as a rear guard action in the efforts of the Remonstrants to achieve reconciliation between Catholics in Ireland and the Crown. It was an unsuccessful action, for in the month of May, 1670, Copinger and Harold were silenced by a Chapter General of their order, meeting in Valladolid, and Harold is subsequently found in Brussels under discipline. While it is somewhat surprising to find that these works written by a Roman Catholic should be printed by the King's Printer in Dublin, it ought to be noted that they were done for a section of the Catholic clergy most favorable to the government. This may well have represented an official governmental policy, to split the Catholics by setting the secular and regular clergy at variance among themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. It is possibly to romance rather than religion that we are indebted for another false imprint on a Dublin-printed book, The Vindication of an Injured Lady, Written by the Lady Francesca Maria Lucretia Plunkett, One of the Ladies of the Privy Chamber to the Queen-Mother of England, the imprint of which is given as "London, Printed in the Year, M.DC.LXVII." Copies are to be found at the Bodleian and at Trinity College, Dublin. Ostensibly a defense by Lady Plunkett of her moral character, the work is not quite what it appears to be. According to Walter Harris's account of Dudley Loftus in his edition of Sir James Ware's The Writers of Ireland, the Vindication is from the pen of Loftus himself, writing on behalf of Lady Plunkett. As Harris remarks: "It was well known that he lived in too great Familiarity with this Lady." The attribution to Loftus is a plausible one. From what is known of his character it is quite the sort of thing he would do. A scholar with a knowledge of a score of languages, including Armenian and Ethiopic, he was notorious also for his "levity" and "want of good sense." If the Lady Plunkett existed at all—and I have not been able to verify her actual existence—Loftus was quite capable, as he has done here, of transforming her into a lady of Italian birth, sprinkling her speech with Italian phrases, and attaching her to the Queen Mother. The use of a London imprint carries out this elaborate conceit, but the Vindication was undoubtedly printed in Dublin. This conclusion is supported by the use of a decorative initial "T", embodying a boy astride a swan, used by the King's Printing-House and also found in Titus Oates's A True Narrative of the Horrid Plot printed by Benjamin Tooke and John Crook in 1679, and also used elsewhere.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. It is with a companion piece to the Vindication that we may consider another problem in Irish printing: that of works without a place of publication. For, bound with the Trinity, Dublin, copy of the Vindication is a Lettera esortatoria di mettere opera a fare sincera penitenza mandata alla Signora F. M. L. P. [i.e., Lady Plunkett]. It bears for imprint simply "Stampata M. DC. LXVII" and is signed at the end "D. L." Continuing the conceit embodied in the Vindication, the author of the Lettera purports to be Lady Plunkett's confessor, an Italian priest, advising her in the misfortunes which have befallen her due to her misdeeds and excommunication. One's astonishment at so involved a device is somewhat mitigated by the fact that in 1664 Loftus had seen fit to translate into Italian the Duke of Ormonde's speech of 27 September 1662, which was "Stampata in Dublino per Giov. Crooke, Stampatore Regio, e si vendono appresso Sam. Dancer." What practical purpose such a translation served in Dublin, other than possibly flattering Ormonde or gratifying Loftus's linguistic vanity, one can only wonder. But we are accordingly prepared for this Lettera . That it too was printed in Dublin need not be doubted: employed on p. 3 is an ornamental "M" found in John Stearne's Animi Medula of 1658, and Jeremy Taylor's Sermon . . . January 27, 1660, printed in 1661, both issued from the King's Printing-House. One is normally confronted, however, with less picturesque examples of books produced without imprints in Ireland in the seventeenth century. The period 1677-1685 saw the appearance of an abnormal number of such pieces, centering on the Popish Plot, and issued as merely "reprinted" in the appropriate year. It is apparent that the fate of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey and the accusations of Titus Oates evoked widespread interest in Ireland. In meeting the demand for reprints of English publications, both the Crook family and Joseph Ray may well have played a part in the whipping up of an "Irish Popish Plot" which led to the sentencing to death of Archbishop Oliver Plunket, whose innocence should have been patent to all. While a goodly number of such pieces on the Popish Plot bear at least the statement "Dublin printed," a substantial number do not. Their printers had sound reasons for not attaching their names to these reprints. Their republication cannot have failed to give affront to Catholics, and the pieces themselves are no credit to their printers. Broadsides or quarto pamphlets, as a lot they reveal even seventeenth-century printing at its very lowest. Old and battered types and ornaments are used; italic and roman fonts are indiscriminately mingled; while poor paper, ink, and presswork complete the degradation. The very inferiority of the printing, coupled with recognizable ornaments and types, with the imposition of many items as quartos in half-sheets, permit the identification of such works as printed in Dublin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. If we are to have a comprehensive picture of printing in Ireland in the seventeenth century, it should also take into consideration another element which became even more pronounced in the eighteenth century: the books which were printed in Ireland but published in England. Of these several are well known, among them the two works by Roger Boyle, Earl of Orrery, reissued in London by Henry Herringman: his Parthenissa, printed in Waterford, and his Poems on Most of the Festivals of the Church, printed in Cork. Both were recognized for what they are by Henry Bradshaw's keen eye. Peter Walsh's History &amp; Vindication of the Loyal Formulary, or Irish Remonstrance of 1674 is of interest not only, as Walsh recounts in his introduction, because the sheets for a large part of the book had been printed by 1669 in Dublin (a statement supported by typographic evidence), but also because, with Fr. Harold's writings, it does prove that Walsh and his Catholic friends had access to the King's Printing-House in Dublin. That by the third quarter of the seventeenth century it was considered practical to ship sheets of Irish-printed books to England for sale there sets the back-ground for less ethical developments in the following century.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. To complete the possible complications which should be considered it remains only to encounter false imprints "in reverse,"—that is, works purporting to be printed in Ireland which were not. Of such, an edition of Jacobus Sylvius's Novissima idea de febribus provides an example. Although Dix apparently accepted it as genuine, the imprint "Dublinii, MDC.XCIV. Sumptibus Zachariæ Conzatti" is unquestionably false. This edition, dedicated to "Io: Baptistæ Sylvestrino, Celeberrimo Pharmacopole" by Giovanni Baptista Conzatti, gives every evidence of having been printed in Italy, as one might deduce from such a dedication. Paper and type support this conclusion, while the copy in the Dix Collection at the National Library of Ireland is in a contemporary vellum binding which bears a manuscript inscription in Italian. Similarly, the edition of A Declaration of the Commons of England . . . expressing their Reasons and Grounds of passing the late Resolutions with its imprint, "London, Printed for Edward Husband Feb. 16, 1647. Reprinted at Kilkenny in the yeare 1648," offers no typographic evidence of having been printed there: that it is a London reprint of a later date, using the Kilkenny phrase as a screen for piracy, I have little reason to question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI. That the problems of Irish printing of the seventeenth century offer a wide opportunity for investigation will, I trust, be granted: it is not simply a matter of provincial printing with inferior craftsmen. Aside from the intrinsic interest of Irish printing itself, it is evident that if we are to have authoritative knowledge of English printing, we must establish clearly what was printed elsewhere, in Scotland and in Ireland particularly. For this all the resources of bibliographical research will be required: a knowledge of type, of paper, of binding, and of printing practices, as well as of the social background which provided the substance for the publications themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The investigation on which this essay is based has been made possible by a grant from the Penrose Fund of the American Philosophical Society. 2 Although in the Catalogue of the Henry Bradshaw Collection at the University of Cambridge the volume has already been recognized as Dublin-printed, the fact that Mr. Donald Wing, in his Short-Title Catalogue of the 1641-1700 period, has failed to include Harold's work may justify a more extended discussion of it here.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Manuscripts of Dryden's The State of Innocence and the Relation of the Harvard MS to the First Quarto by Marion H. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the Author's Preface to The State of Innocence, Dryden explains that he is publishing an opera in his own defense—"many hundred Copies of it being dispers'd abroad without my knowledge or consent: so that every one gathering new faults, it became at length a Libel against me." 1 Of the "many hundred Copies" the following five, listed here with the sigils that will be used in this study, are now extant: H MS Thr. 9, Harvard University M Add. MSS 37, 158, British Museum B Rawl. C. 146, Bodleian Library Hn 1 El. 11650, Huntington Library Hn 2 Rare Book 134219-29, Huntington Library Although all of these manuscripts have been examined by scholars, a complete comparative study to determine their derivation from the non-extant archetype and their relative authority has not heretofore been made. 2 All of the MSS are scribal transcripts and all, except for Hn 2 , which is in the same hand as Hn 1 , were made by different scribes. The Harvard MS, however, has the distinction of containing certain corrections and emendations made by Dryden himself, notwithstanding the fact that the first two pages are incomplete. 3 Textual collation of the manuscripts, in which Q1 served as the control for the study, demonstrates the following to be the ancestral tree: The evidence in support of this tree is both statistical and analytical and will be given in that order, beginning with the following Table of Substantive Variants. 4 MS 5 Unique readings Readings shared with 1 MS Readings shared with 2 MSS Total shared with individual MSS Total shared reading Harvard 43 M 4 B &amp; M 1 M 5 12 B 2 Hn &amp; B 4 B 7 Hn 1 Hn &amp; M 0 Hn 5 British 317 H 4 Hn &amp; B 66 H 5 Museum B 30 B &amp; H 1 B 97 120 Hn 19 Hn &amp; H 0 Hn 85 Bodleian 181 H 2 H &amp; M 1 H 7 M 30 Hn &amp; H 4 M 97 179 Hn 76 Hn &amp; M 66 Hn 146 Huntington 219 H 1 H &amp; B 4 H 5 M 19 H &amp; M 0 M 85 166 Hn 1 7 B 76 B &amp; M 66 B 146 Hn 2 24 On statistical evidence alone, certain probabilities are immediately apparent. First, the Harvard manuscript, with only 43 unique readings and 12 shared unique readings, 6 bears the closest relation to Q1. Since its relatively few shared unique readings are distributed almost evenly among the other MSS, there is no reason to assume either that H derived from any of them, or that it bears a closer relation to any one of the three MSS than to the remaining two. Instead, it is clearly related to Q1, although whether in radiation from a common ancestor or in a straight line of descent cannot be determined by statistical evidence. Second, the large number of unique readings in M, B, and Hn suggest that each is a terminal text, although the 31 variants that exist between the two Huntington MSS indicate that they are terminal only in relation to the other MSS since the variation between them suggests, but cannot prove until its content is examined, that one of the Hn MSS may have derived from the other. Third, the agreement of 66 readings in B, M, and Hn against H and Q1 suggests the possibility that each of the two groups may have derived from an exclusive common ancestor. Finally, the agreement of 76 readings in B and Hn against readings supported by all other texts suggests the possibility that B and Hn may owe these readings to a later ancestor than the one they presumably share with M. Since statistical evidence alone cannot prove any of these assumptions to be true, the line of descent can only be established with certainty by an analysis of the readings themselves. The results of this, too detailed to elaborate here, can be summarized under the heading of each manuscript as follows: Harvard MS The fragmentary state of the first two pages of this MS precludes the possibility that any other text derived from it. Furthermore, although many of the 43 unique readings are correctable scribal errors, others, consisting largely of omitted words, are not obvious errors and would have been followed by any MS descending directly from H. Of the 12 readings that H shares with one or more manuscripts, all are of minor significance since they involve only a simple variance such as the change from singular to plural. In no instance does an analysis of the readings indicate that H is any closer to one MS than to another. One can assume, however, since it is known that Dryden revised the text, that, apart from the first two pages, it represents a good version of the archetype. British Museum MS The 317 unique substantive readings of the MS include the omission of six lines and 11 words that appear in all other MSS. On this basis, therefore, it is evident that M is a terminal text. Of the 66 readings shared by M, B, and Hn, although many of them are minor variants of no significance, the majority involve a more meaningful change that precludes coincidence and indicates the existence of an exclusive common ancestor for the three MSS. The following three selected readings, with Q1 providing the lemma and the variant italicized, will illustrate: 1. this new created Orb] new made (II.i.30.) 2. Enjoy and blast her] blesse (III.i.95.) 3. with early care] cheerful (V.i.381.) That each of these readings is coherent in its variant form and would have been accepted by any scribe finding it in his exemplar is self-evident. It is obvious, then, that they must have originated in the manuscript that served as the exclusive common ancestor for M, B, and Hn. The identity of that ancestor, however, must be determined on the basis of two possible alternatives: (1) the readings originated in the archetype and represent the author's intentions; or (2) they originated in an non-extant MS as corruptions of the archetype and were retained by all descendents of that text. If the first possibility is accepted, the 66 readings as they are in H and in Q1 become corruptions of the original text. Since, however, the majority of the readings shared by M, B, and Hn against H and Q1 destroy the point of the line or upset the metre, this alternative must be rejected in favor of the second. On this basis one can postulate the hypothetical manuscript β, the originator of the 66 variant readings and the exclusive common ancestor of the family of M, B, and Hn. In addition to the 66 variants shared by the three MSS, it will be remembered that statistical evidence shows further agreement between M and B of 30 shared unique readings, and 19 between M and Hn. Examination of the readings, however, proves them to be without significance since they are either minor variants such as "over" for "o're", or readings that have further variation in the other MSS that obviates their importance. Bodleian MS Among the 181 unique substantive readings of B there are three hiatuses, and 15 words and one speech prefix omitted from the text but supplied by all other MSS. These omissions, together with the many unique readings that are sufficiently coherent in B to have been accepted by any derived text, offer conclusive evidence that it is a terminal MS. With the family relationship of B, M, and Hn already established, there is still the relationship between B and Hn to consider. This statistical evidence indicates, on the basis of 76 shared unique readings, might be closer than that of the family directly descended from β. Examination of the shared variants shows that they include one hiatus, the omission of four words and one speech heading supplied by M, H, and Q1, and one stage direction that differs from the other texts. Since B is a terminal manuscript, and, as will be shown later, Hn is also terminal in so far as the other MSS are concerned, none of these variants could have originated in either B or Hn and descended to the other. Three examples, selected from over 50 possible ones, will illustrate that these variants could only have originated in a non-extant MS from which only B and Hn derived: 1. I shall turn ] wing (II.i.41.) 2. to smell the flavour ] odour (III.i.62.) 3. for on this ground] I from (IV.ii.44.) Although the remaining 22 agreements between B and Hn are minor variants of no significance, since the other 54 cannot be attributed to coincidence without defying common sense, the hypothetical MS γ is postulated as the immediate descendent of β and the originator of the significant agreements between B and Hn, which become a sub-family descended from γ. Huntington MSS The 219 unique readings in the two Huntington MSS include three hiatuses, the omission of 11 lines, 19 words, and one speech prefix, and the addition of 11 words not present in the other MSS. On this evidence, it is unnecessary to present further proof that no extant MS could have derived from them. Furthermore, since the relationship between Hn and the other MSS has already been established, it is now only necessary to restore the two Huntington MSS, until now considered as one, to their original status of two documents in order to demonstrate the descent of one from the other. Statistical evidence shows 31 variant readings between them: seven unique in Hn 1 ; 24 unique in Hn 2 . All that can be determined from these facts is that one descended from the other or that both descended collaterally from the same source. Analysis of the readings, however, demonstrates that they are not collateral but did, in fact, descend one from the other with Hn 1 serving as the parent of Hn 2 . None of the seven unique readings in Hn 1 is of significance since each is a correctable scribal error. On the other hand, among the 24 unique readings in Hn 2 there is the omission of one whole line, four half-lines, and two words, as well as the addition of one word. Since all of these readings are supported not only by Hn 1 but also by all other texts, it is evident that Hn 2 is a terminal text. Had Hn 1 and Hn 2 derived independently from an exclusive common ancestor, the incidence of variation between them would have been far greater. Since Hn 1 could not have descended from Hn 2 , it is reasonable to assume that the reverse obtains and that Hn 2 , although correcting or modifying the seven unique readings of Hn 1 , descended directly from the latter, adding 24 unique readings in the process. With the derivation of the five extant MSS established, their relative authority is also indicated. Hn 2 , at the bottom of the manuscript tree, is four removes from the archetype; Hn 1 and B, both descended from γ, are three; and M, descended from β, is two. Only H is directly descended from the archetype and becomes, therefore, the most authoritative of the five extant MSS. As such, the relationship of H to Q1 is of paramount importance. Although the Harvard MS contains the least number of variants from Q1 of all the extant MSS, it did not serve as copy for the printed text. Instead, a manuscript now lost (presumably retained and destroyed by the printer) was transcribed under Dryden's supervision to be used by the printer. This manuscript, hereafter to be referred to as "q", derived independently from the archetype which itself had been revised and augmented by the author for the purpose of publication. The evidence found in H to support this hypothesis falls into the two categories of 1. Corrections and emendations in H. 2. Readings in H that differ from Q1 but are supported by all other MSS. There are 66 corrections or emendations in H which can be divided into five classifications: 7 a. Scribal corrections obviously made during the process of transcription which bring the reading into agreement with all other MSS and Q1. 32 examples. b. Scribal and authorial corrections apparently inserted after transcription which bring the reading into agreement with the other MSS and Q1. 18 examples. c. Emendations, which I believe to be authorial, that depart from the reading shared by all MSS and are retained in Q1. Seven examples. d. Emendations, which I believe to be authorial, that depart from the reading shared by all MSS and are not found in Q1, which restores the original reading. Five examples. e. Emendations, both scribal and authorial, that show further revision in Q1. Four examples. The significance of the first and second groups rests in the fact that both the scribe and the author corrected the manuscript with considerable care in order to restore its readings to what must have been, on the evidence of agreement in the other MSS, their original form. That Dryden corrected it at all is testimony that the manuscript was sufficiently close to the archetype to warrant such action by the author. The readings in the third group are important because they are clearly deliberate improvements made in H and retained in Q1 either to correct or to emend the archetype. The fourth group, more complicated than the rest, consists of five readings which I shall reproduce here as they appear in the manuscript. None of the readings in their emended form appears in Q1 but all of the crossed-out readings are not only in Q1 but also in the other MSS. 8 All that can be determined with certainty is that the crossed-out readings derived from the archetype and were revised in H by the author. Why the revisions are not retained in Q1 is impossible to establish with absolute conviction, although it is safe to assume that they were not present in the MS that served as printer's copy. It becomes necessary, therefore, to make a final decision concerning the nature of q, the MS behind Q1, and its relation to H. There are two alternatives: (1) it derived from H in the main, but was further revised and augmented by Dryden before being given to the printer; or (2) it is a MS independently derived from the archetype, revised and augmented by Dryden shortly before the play was published in 1677. In the first explanation, H becomes the initial step in the process of revision that was to culminate in Q1; and the five readings emended in H that revert back to their original form in Q1 are merely readings rejected by the author in his final revision of the play. Unfortunately, however, this theory does not take into consideration the unique readings in H which, although relatively few in number, are still sufficient to establish the MS as a terminal text as has already been demonstrated. Moreover, it is impossible to overlook the fragmentary state of the first two pages of H. Only if one assumes that the scribe of q was presented with a freshly written leaf containing the lines omitted in H, as well as all the additional material that appears in Q1, which will shortly be discussed, can even partial derivation of q from H be accepted. The obvious difficulties to this theory make the second alternative the more probable. In this, H becomes a MS that was sufficiently close to the archetype to warrant partial revision by Dryden at some time. When he decided to print the play, three years after it was written, he also decided to augment it with various embellishments designed to please an audience. One can postulate, then, that the Harvard manuscript was no longer in his possession and that a new manuscript was prepared from the archetype, which had already been revised by the author to include the several changes and additions that appear in Q1. This manuscript, deriving independently from the archetype, would not contain the unique errors of H, but would retain some of the emendations found in H either because Dryden had already noted them in his foul papers when he altered H, or because he remembered them and made them again. The group of five readings that do not appear in Q1 as emended in H were either rejected by the author in his final revision of the play or forgotten. On the evidence of the readings themselves, the first conjecture seems the more likely. The readings in the fifth group, emendations both scribal and authorial that show further revision in Q1, offer additional evidence of the care with which Dryden revised his play, first in H and later in q. Considered collectively, the five groups of corrections and emendations in H provide further proof that H did not serve as copy for Q1. The manuscript behind Q1 is q, in all probability a transcript of the revised archetype. Conclusive evidence of the existence of this manuscript is to be found by examining the readings in H that differ from Q1 but are supported by all other MSS. This material can be divided into the following eight groups: 1. The title of the play as it appears in Q1 is The State of Innocence, and Fall of Man . In all the manuscripts, with slight modification, it is The Fall of Angells and Man in Innocence, the title under which the play was registered by Herringman in 1674. Since the emphasis of the play is on Adam and Eve and their fall from grace, rather than on the fall of the angels, which is important only as it affects and parallels the human situation, the title as given in Q1 is the appropriate one, undoubtedly authorized by Dryden. 2. The character of Asmoday in Q1 is called Asmodell in all manuscripts. In view of the fact that the names of all the angels in the play end in "el", Dryden may have realized that Asmodell carried an unsuitable angelic connotation for a devil and made the change accordingly. 3. The speech prefix to Lucifer's short line on B1 v , line 26 of Q1 is omitted in all MSS. Whether this is an authorial correction made for Q1 or an inadvertent compositorial addition is debatable. On the literary evidence of the entire passage, however, I believe it to be authorial. 4. The opening stage direction of Q1 omits the two phrases "thunder is heard and flashes of lightning seen" and "A shower of fire rains over the stage". Q1 adds the direction "and a hymn sung." Since the omitted phrases also appear in the opening stage direction of Shadwell's operatic version of the Dryden-Davenant The Tempest, Dryden may have decided against repeating a device already in use at the rival theatre where The Tempest remained popular for ten years. The addition of a hymn to the printed text is clearly an attempt to meet the growing demand of the public for more music in the theatre. 5. The long stage direction at the end of Act I, the short directions on C1 v and D2 r , and the aside on C4 v of Q1 do not appear in any manuscript. Each of these is theatrical in purpose, provided in order to please an audience by offering a more colorful spectacle on the one hand, and to instruct an actor on the other. As such they are clear indications that Dryden revised his play carefully for publication not only to defend his literary reputation, but because he hoped that the play would finally be performed. 6. There are no scene headings apart from the first of each act in Q1. All manuscripts divide Act IV into two scenes. Whether this unimportant omission is authorial or compositorial cannot be determined, but it was clearly intended to preserve uniformity of scene headings. 7. Q1 lacks five lines that appear in all manuscripts: two pairs of couplets; and a single line. The first is a line that occurs early in Act II when Raphael is explaining to Adam that his single state on earth is comparable to that of the Almighty who, like Adam, has no equals, only servants. In the printed text Adam somewhat abruptly replies, "Why did he Reason in my Soul implant?" (II.i.57.) The additional line in the manuscripts provides not only a smoother but a less arrogant speech which reads Such state is far above my Humble Wish Why did he Reason in my Soul implant? It is significant that the omission of the line in the quarto breaks the pattern of rhymed couplets consistent thus far in the act and leaves a line that stands alone. The MS reading provides the couplet but the word "wish" destroys the rhyme. Since, however, the inclusion of the line is preferable both metrically and dramatically, one is forced to believe that its omission from Q1 was caused by compositorial eye skip rather than by authorial deletion. 9 The first of the two couplets is in Act III, appended to the end of Lucifer's soliloquy in which he vows vengeance on Adam and Eve. In Q1 the passage ends live happy whilst you may Blest pair, y'are not alow'd another day! (III.i.99-100.) In the MSS these lines follow immediately: Honour and Empire, where no Quarrels lye Are pleas for Universall Monarchy. Since the lines in the MSS have no bearing on the subject of the speech as a whole, which is concerned with Lucifer's terrible jealousy of Adam and Eve, it seems safe to assume that Dryden himself deleted the lines in recognition of their irrelevancy. The second of the two couplets is also in Act III in the scene of Eve's vision. Here the woman in the dream, protesting that she will die if she tastes the fruit, asks, "and who can Heav'n withstand?" (III.ii.24.) To which in Q1 the angel replies, "Why was it made so fair, why plac'd in sight?" In the MSS, however, the angel answers Sweet Creature, no Believe not so Why was it made so fair, why plac'd in sight? The result is incoherent since the words "Believe not so", if they refer to anything, go back to the woman's first statement concerning her fear of death. The deletion of the lines is a marked improvement that is certainly authorial. 8. Q1 differs from all manuscripts in 41 additional substantive readings. These readings, varying in significance, can be divided into two main categories: (a.) Q1 changes in words intended to improve the sense, the metre, or the grammar of the line that can be demonstrated as authorial. There are 26 in this category. (b.) Variants that are due to compositorial error in Q1. Of these there are 15. As it is impossible here to discuss each of these readings, two representative examples from each group must suffice. Early in Act III Eve, describing her nuptial bower, lists the flowers that grow around it: Thy Myrtle, Orange, and the blushing Rose, (III.i.60.) and a few lines later, And creeping 'twixt' em all, the mant'ling Vine, (III.i.65.) The manuscripts, however, read: The Bridegroom Orange and the blushing Rose . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . And creeping 'twixt 'em both, the mantling Vine The change from "Bridegroom" to "Myrtle" could not have been compositorial since the two words are so unlike that neither misreading nor memorial failure could have occasioned it. Far more probable is that in going over the text, Dryden realized that the original image of the orange as the bridegroom and the rose as the bride was strained and artificial. Accordingly, he substituted "myrtle," the flower sacred to Venus, and the subsequent change from "both" to "all" followed logically. The word "Thy" in Q1 is, of course, a misprint for "The". From the second category, those 15 substantive variants in Q1 which I consider compositorial errors, both examples chosen for illustration are to be found in Act III. The first comes in Lucifer's soliliquy as he listens in anguish to Adam and Eve discuss their wedding night: . . . as if Heav'n meant to shew What in base matter such a hand could do] matters Q1 (III.i.50.) The MS reading, which is consonant with the Miltonic doctrine of matter from which all creation was formed, was obviously misunderstood by the compositor who "improved" the reading by adding an erroneous "s". The second, which refers to the flowers in the arbor, reads With bending heads so nigh their blooms disclose] heaps Q1 (III.i.61.) A close examination of Q1 reveals that this is a clear example of a turned letter "d" printed as "p". Despite the nonsense that results, the compositor's error remained undetected through all the early texts and has been retained in all modern editions. When one considers all the variants between Q1 and the unities of the manuscripts, it is evident that, except for a few compositorial errors, the Q1 variants can be attributed to the author. Since the manuscript that contained them represents the author's final intentions concerning the words and action of the play, Q1, deriving from this manuscript which itself descended independently from the archetype, is clearly the text of highest substantive authority.</field>

Page 2, which begins with line 7 of the play, breaks off just before the end of line 30 and omits eight lines which the unused space could have contained. 4 "Substantive variant" means any reading variation that affects the author's meaning. A line or a passage omitted from or added to a given text is considered as one substantive reading.

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of Johnson's Journey (1775) by William B. Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After an early misunderstanding, Johnson's bibliographers are now generally agreed that the Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1775), previously described as of one or two or three states or impressions or issues, is properly identified as of two separate editions. 1 Nevertheless, as confusion still persists and, in fact, is still encouraged by those who find some advantage in the earlier classifications, it seems advisable at the outset to specify the exact nature of the variants. With this much recorded, the writer may then be indulged a few speculations as to how these variants were produced. For the latter purpose conjecture is supported by abundant evidence. Besides the material available in the Life and Letters much is to be learned from the original ledger of the printing, 2 much more from the book itself, in its paper, press figures, headlines, and offsets, still more from the information kindly supplied by those who have examined certain distinctive copies. 3 These various sources provide for the Journey a commentary more extensive and more explicit, I would say, than for any other book printed in the eighteenth century.</field>

These, it appears, were set with the title and errata leaves by half-sheet imposition, all eight of the type-pages being disposed in the forme as: During the course of printing, the man at press (identified at D8 v as number 4) interrupted his work to alter the paging of U4 v from '226' to '296'. Then, after all work had been printed, and perfected on the same forme, the two copies of each sheet were cut apart and each copy placed at the end of the pile of folded text sheets, following 2B8, as a four-leaf gathering ordered D8 r-v . 2C1 v-r (inverted). * U4 v-r (inverted). A1 r-v . When these leaves were later separated for inclusion in the book, the pages of the Virginia copy carried these traces of their original location: A1 r , an inverted offset of * U4 r ; D8 r offset of 2B8 v ; U4 v offset of 2C1 r ; 2C1 r offset of U4 v ; 2C1 v inverted offset of D8 v . From the juxtaposition of these leaves it is evident (1) that all four were printed off before issue, and (2) that as the title and errata leaves are disjoined in this imposition, their occasional appearance together must be regarded as an accident in the binding.

      <field name="fulltext">II. Chronology of Presswork. The earlier printing of the Journey can be traced most conveniently through the author's correspondence. On the 20th of June, 1774, we learn, the first sheets were put to press (356 5 ); and work then continued without interruption until the 4th of July (357), when Johnson left for his excursion to Wales. Though Boswell was assured that the press would "go on slowly for a time," it is very doubtful that much was done, for after Johnson's return on September 30 his correspondent is informed that the work had been "detained" or "suspended" (363, 360) in his absence. Now that he was again in London, however, he proposed "to drive the book forward," and forward it went until October 20, when Johnson reported that, as 240 pages were then printed, the book might be out in a month (360.1). By the 20th, then, the 15 signatures through Q had been completed and 9 remained to be finished. If we now assume that, except for an odd sheet or two, all printing was in fact suspended between July 4 and September 30, it will be observed that sustained work on the 15 signatures covered about five weeks, two before the trip, three after. This would mean that the sheets were processed at the rate of three a week, with B through G completed in the first sequence and H through Q in the second. That there was an interruption after G is confirmed in various ways, first by the appearance at I of two pressmen (1 and 7) not previously engaged; secondly by the occurrence in the outer forme of H of an imperfect headline, 6 the result, apparently of temporary storage against other formes; thirdly by the presence of numerous errors in the text. Before G, the author carefully revised his proofs, but afterwards, while the book was being 'driven forward,' he was less attentive and thus required the listing of errata for most of the signatures between H and T. So long as Johnson was pressing forward on the nine sheets H—Q he had every reason to believe that, according to the previous rate, the nine remaining sheets (R—2B) could be finished in three weeks and the book published, as he expected, within the month. But shortly after this announcement the printing was so considerably retarded that the final proofs were not corrected until November 25 (363), the first of several cancels not proposed until the 30th (364), the work on the title-errata-cancels half-sheet thus not completed, probably, before December 12, and the first copy made ready for Mrs. Thrale's inspection not until December 17 (365.2). So, as it happened, the book confidently anticipated some time in November was eventually finished by the middle of December and, as the holiday season was then in full sway, deferred for publication until toward the end of January. Much of this delay is certainly due to Johnson; some may be traced to new measures belatedly adopted in the printing house. Before the final proofs were returned there are several indications that Strahan, the printer, had already decided that the sale of the Journey would exceed his expectation; and as on earlier occasions 7 so on this he thereupon arranged that the issue of sheets for work still in hand, or still in prospect, should be increased from 2000 to 4000 copies, and that all work previously machined and distributed should be reset for another run of 2000 copies. With this arrangement in effect, no matter how long Johnson delayed the printing of the first edition, and no matter how much the Christmas season might then delay its publication, work on the increased issue—or as it should now be called, the second edition—could proceed in whatever order the convenience of the printer might dictate. Then as the proofs for the remaining sheets of the first edition were returned, these could be worked off with the others, and both editions then brought to completion one after the other. How and when all this work might have been accomplished remains to be determined. Of the sheets printed after Q but before any increase in issue there are only five: R, T, U, X, and Y. Quite probably, therefore, these were machined at the usual rate of three signatures a week, at 2000 copies a forme, and were completed by Saturday, November 5. It may have been on the following Monday, then, that Strahan, a little irked at Johnson's procrastination, decided to go ahead with the new edition. From the type, press figures, and headlines it is evident that this decision was reached at a time when all but the last page of Y had been distributed, while all of Z and 2A were still intact, and before the original printing of S, 2B, title, errata, and cancels. These several pages and sheets thus occur in an identical setting for both editions. In the second edition the pages D8 r-v , U4 r-v , and Y8 v appear as reimpressions in formes otherwise reset; the title and errata page (less five readings corrected in the second edition) as reimpressions now imposed together as a quarter-sheet; the full signature Z as a delayed impression (skeletons reversed, different figures); 2A as an interrupted impression (identical skeletons, different figures); and sheets S and 2B as a continuous impression (identical skeletons and figures). Of the full sheets it will be noted that S, containing the early charges of Johnson's mounting assault on Macpherson, was so long withheld that it was finally worked off with the last signatures of the book. Among these later sheets, however, there is one important distinction: Though S was eventually machined without alteration, the work on 2A and 2B was stopped half-way through the impression to admit an asterisk before the initial signatures. Apparently, as Strahan may have realized after the completion of S—and possibly several other sheets—some mark was needed so that the warehouse-man could segregate the heaps for the first edition from those to be reserved for the second. By this means the printer anticipated the corrections Johnson later proposed and was able to keep the amended sheets apart from the others. Since the asterisk seems to have been deliberately introduced and consistently used thereafter it may serve to identify all sheets printed before its appearance. These include not only all properly belonging to the first edition and the solitary sheet S, continuously impressed for both editions, but also E and most copies of B of the second edition. At least this number, then, were printed off before Johnson returned the last several proofs of the first edition. It will now be expedient to summarize, in tabular form, the schedule of events from the time Strahan decided to enlarge the issue until the day when Mrs. Thrale received the first copy off the press. No. of Ed. copies Sig. Comment 1 2000 Y Nov. 7? Last page salvaged for later reimpression. 1 2000 Z All pages held for reimpression. 1-2 4000 S Continuously impressed for both eds.

To the other signs of progression may be added, finally, the evidence of the headlines. As defined in Table I these recur in groups of four (two for each signature), originally combined in the sequence YEND, and then modified in the course of presswork through various other combinations. Again, unless we wish to argue for some erratic arrangement—such as a misplaced forme, in this instance—a definite order may be presumed from these gradations, and specific indications of that order discerned at those points where the skeletons are altered or replaced by others. The peculiar characteristics of the headlines and the extent to which each is used may be seen in the following summary. 8 Original occurrence Extent Key Headline * Defect 1st ed. 2d ed.

Evidently signature N preceded M; U preceded all signatures after H; and R and X, as well as others using the W 1 Y skeletons, normally came after those using a different combination. With these and all other considerations in mind, and now adjusted one against the other, we may next offer in Table II a hypothetical sequence of all printing from the first sheet of the first edition to the last sheet of the second. Admitting Johnson's own statement that the book was laid on press June 20, 1774, and allowing the presumption implicit in a later remark that the work generally proceeded at the rate of 6000 copies a week (3 sheets x 2000, or 1½ x 4000), both editions could easily have been finished by January 16, 1775, two days before the first went on sale. That Strahan had actually committed himself this far, before he had a chance to gauge the demand for the first edition, is admittedly a questionable speculation. Even this, however, is more plausible than the alternative: that having resolved upon a second, and having printed off a few sheets for this, he then lost heart and did nothing further. That the schedule is, indeed, something more than a possibility appears in two references: one a reported statement by Cadell, the publisher, that 4000 copies were sold in the first week; the other, the record of the printing, in which Strahan definitely indicates that both editions, totalling this number, were charged against the publisher before the end of the month. Some objection may be raised against the first report in view of occasional advertisements, probably for remainders, as late as four months after the time alleged. Perhaps this account represents the usual exaggeration to be expected of a publisher, or a story essentially true when first related but somewhat embellished when it was relayed by another person. 9 Concerning the second report, however, no question arises, since this is in Strahan's own hand. 10 M. r Thomas Cadell D r 1775 [£] [s] [d] January Johnson's Tour. 24½ Sheets, N.° 2000 &amp;c.mmat; £1:8:0 34- 6-0 Corrections in D° throughout 3-10-0 D° another Edit.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Undoubtedly, as Professor Hazen assures me, this is now the consensus; but I have yet to find it acknowledged in print except as a passing note in Dr. R. W. Chapman's recent edition of Johnson's Letters (1952), II, 12, n.4. In an admirable study of Chapman's earlier speculations on these variants ( New Colophon, I [1948], 179-180) Mr. H. W. Liebert moves very close to the definitions I would propose, dismisses the "second" of "three impressions" as a mixed copy, but leaves undecided the facts concerning the only later "impression" or edition of 1775. This, I am quite sure, was not corrected at press; and any exemplar which so appears may also appear, from its press figures, to be a mixed copy. In original condition the second invariably contains an errata sheet with the first 6 of the 11 errors listed in the first edition, and with the remaining 5 corrected in the text. 2 Reproduced through the courtesy of Mr. R. A. Austen-Leigh, Chairman of Spottiswoode &amp; Ballantyne, Ltd. 3 To Mrs. Donald F. Hyde I am especially indebted for an account of the six copies in the magnificent Hyde collection, and to Mr. John Cook Wyllie for his file of research on the headlines of both editions and on the series of offsets in the University of Virginia copy. Without their advice this study could not have begun; without their insistence it would not have been finished. 4 See Morning Chronicle, Daily Advertiser and other papers of this date. Preliminary announcements citing this as the day of publication appear in various papers beginning January 11; and repeated notices occur thereafter through January 21. After this there are scattered references, probably to remainders of the second edition, in the Morning Post for February 9, the Public Advertiser for February 13, and the Morning Post, again, as late as June 1. 5 References are to item number in Chapman's edition of the Letters . 6 Identified later as headline E 1 . 7 See the account of Gibbon's Decline and Fall in Miss Norton's bibliography (1940), pp. 36-45; and, for a less successful venture, my note on Fielding's Amelia in PBSA, XLVII (1953), 72-75. * [Affected letters printed in italics] 8 Where the headlines are used for a printing extending through both editions, they are counted only once. Thus E 1 , N, and W, all recurring at the end of the second edition (sigs. Z—2B), actually were printed off at the end of the first. 9 The information comes from Hannah More. Life, eds. Hill-Powell, II,310,n.2. 10 Buff quarto account book, fol. 57 v . On 58 r , under date of December 30, 1775, Strahan credits Cadell with full payment of £72-2-0 for the two editions. It may be noted that while 71 of the 386 type-pages are of the same setting in the second edition, no reduction has been made in the charge.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Publishing of Meredith's Rhoda Fleming by Richard B. Hudson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The account of the publication of George Meredith's Rhoda Fleming that has been accepted universally is based on a letter from Meredith to his friend Canon Augustus Jessopp on April 24, 1865. "Tinsley offers £400 for Rhoda Fleming. . . I don't quite like to sell it for that sum. Chapman and Hall bids me wait till November." 1 Since William Tinsley did publish Rhoda Fleming in October of 1865, 2 the impeccably logical assumption has always been that Meredith accepted his offer, however reluctantly. 3 An unpublished letter in my possession from Meredith to Tinsley, however, shows that, contrary to what one would expect in the usual author-publisher relationship, Meredith was in debt to Tinsley some years after the appearance of Rhoda Fleming , and leads me to raise some questions about this transaction. The letter in my possession is dated simply "July 3 rd ," but the paper bears the water mark "Joynson 1867." Meredith asks Tinsley to make an overnight visit to Box Hill to see "MSS in progress to completion," and appoints a time for the visit. 4 Then there occurs this crucial sentence: "The debt has been left unsettled owing to my having kept back my work to perfect it more. It was honourably incurred by me out of consideration for your house, because I doubted the chances of the novel attaining popularity: but it must not the less be paid. . . ." Meredith has work in hand that will easily pay off the debt, in other words, whether Tinsley publishes it or not. 5 The debt, however, has arisen from a published work, which can only be Rhoda Fleming, since that is the only work of Meredith's Tinsley has published. Typed copies of two other short letters to Tinsley and the original of a third are in the Yale University Library and refer to this debt; two of them add scraps of information, although one merely repeats the invitation to Box Hill in much the same terms as in my letter. The second is dated Oct. 18, 1870, five years after the publication of Rhoda Fleming . The date is important not only in dating the transaction but also in accounting for Tinsley's urgency, since he failed in that year. 6 The third tells us that the debt is in the form of a bill that has come due; Meredith asks Tinsley to take £40 and wait a couple of months for the rest. 7 But none states the reason for the debt. There are, of course, many ways in which Meredith might have got himself into debt to Tinsley even after accepting Tinsley's offer—a personal debt (highly unlikely, since Meredith and Tinsley were not intimate); a business debt incurred in buying back his copyright from Tinsley; an advance on a contract Meredith found himself unable to fulfill (he had work in progress). If the sentence I have quoted from my letter refers to any of these possibilities, however, Meredith is talking in uncommonly strange terms. This sentence can only be explained, I think, if one starts with the assumption that Meredith's reluctance prevailed and that he did not accept Tinsley's offer for Rhoda Fleming . If Meredith incurred a debt to Tinsley because he doubted that Rhoda Fleming would become popular and was afraid Tinsley would lose money by the transaction, that debt must have been the production costs of the novel. Meredith must have published the work at his own expense— "on commission terms" as it was known. Meredith no doubt signed a note for all or the major part of the production costs—printing, paper, binding, advertising, and a commission to the publisher for acting as the author's agent. 8 Rhoda Fleming, according to Tinsley, "had a poor sale." 9 It probably failed to bring in enough to cover the amount of Meredith's note, and since Tinsley was in financial trouble, he pressed Meredith for payment. The inference that Meredith published Rhoda Fleming at his own expense is reinforced by the fact that a year earlier he had, with high hopes of success, published Emilia in England on the same terms with Chapman and Hall. Of Emilia, he wrote Captain Maxse: "It's my undertaking—the risk mine and the uncounted profits. I told Chapman I should want a good sum and did not object to publish the book myself. He though the closing alternative best, and it may be for me." 10 There is no evidence as to how successful this venture was, but Emilia must have sold well enough to give Meredith confidence to undertake the risk again, a confidence that in this instance seems to have been misplaced. So far, I have taken Meredith's statement in my letter at its face value: he went into debt to Tinsley to save Tinsley from a probable loss. That this debt represents the production costs of Rhoda Fleming, I have no doubt; but it does not follow that we have to accept the reason Meredith assigns for having undertaken the debt. If he was reluctant to accept £400 for Rhoda Fleming, he was reluctant because he did not think £400 enough. If he therefore undertook to publish the work himself, he did so in the hope of making more than £400, not out of gentlemanly concern for the fortunes of William Tinsley. The tone of his defence of himself is distinctly pious. Certainly his correspondence shows no such touching desire to indemnify Chapman and Hall from possible loss. Yet Meredith was Chapman's reader and a friend of the Chapman family and had far more reason to be solicitous of Chapman's economic health than of Tinsley's. The passing of time, however, along with Meredith's sensitivity to his failures, had brought on an understandable and thoroughly human rationalization, for which we, if not Tinsley and the Comic Spirit, can forgive him.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Whitman's Manuscripts for the Original "Calamus" Poems by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the Library of Clifton Waller Barrett is preserved a wealth of holograph Walt Whitman manuscripts, much of it poetical. The heart of this group of manuscripts is the so-called Valentine Collection, which contains the manuscripts for the majority of the new poems added to the third or 1860 edition of Leaves of Grass, the first of the greatly expanded editions and the text which among present-day critics is often more highly esteemed than diplomatically altered later versions. From these manuscripts, various of which are heavily revised, much can be told of Whitman as a literary artist. On another plane, a study of the papers and the inks used for these manuscripts goes a surprising distance towards establishing a conjectural order of composition; and some collateral evidence can be utilized to assign a few dates with a fair degree of confidence. Of especial interest in these manuscripts is the light which they shed upon the growth of the biographically significant grouping of poems printed in the 1860 edition for the first time under the heading "Calamus." With Mr. Barrett's generous permission I am in process of preparing for publication an edition of all these manuscripts which lie behind the 1860 Leaves of Grass; but since the appearance of this volume may be held back for some time yet, it has seemed best not to delay further making available to students of Whitman some information which may be of immediate interest, specifically the story of the inception of the "Calamus" cluster and the original poems which comprised it. In this narrative, various flat statements will need to be made without corroborative evidence, for to document every statement with the available facts from manuscripts would involve me in evidence and considerations extending far beyond the mere twelve poems which I propose to reprint and to discuss. The bare bones of this present story will be fleshed with the proper evidence when the full texts and their appropriate introductions are published. The present paper is merely a preview and a synopsis. Briefly, the Valentine-Barrett manuscripts establish with some certainty the following outline. Between January and May, 1856, even before the publication of the second edition of Leaves of Grass, Whitman seems to have started to plan a greatly expanded third edition. From this date to June-July of 1857 ensued a period of furious poetic activity in which Whitman composed at least sixty-eight new poems. Although in June (?) 1857 he writes that his 'New Bible' will not be ready before 1859, 1 yet in July he owns to having a hundred poems ready for a third edition, which he plans to print starting with the thirty-two poems from the plates of the second edition and following with sixty-eight new ones. 2 The first part of this list of the poems which were to succeed the second-edition plates is preserved in the Valentine-Barrett papers and effectively demonstrates that at about this date Whitman had not conceived the idea for his 'clusters' like "Chants Democratic," or "Calamus," as found in the 1860 edition. The list is straightforward, in a quite different order from the 1860 edition; and in fact, various of the poems later to be grouped under "Calamus" in 1860 are here scattered among other poems, an indication that some of the printed "Calamus" poems were not composed with that theme in mind at all. Although this list breaks off after poem no. 72, the fact that many of the Valentine-Barrett manuscripts are numbered according to the system of this list enables us to reconstruct with only a gap here and there the complete original scheme for the hundred odd poems as they were planned for the third edition, and actually composed, by a date which must closely approximate the summer of 1857. Thereafter, it is the evidence of the manuscripts that Whitman (doubtless completely occupied with his duties as editor of the Brooklyn Daily Times ) wrote little poetry, although he may have done some revision on the present manuscripts as represented in the list, until towards the end of his editorship and extending into his period of freedom thereafter, about June, 1859, another spurt of poetic activity produced additional poems, many of these of a calamus nature, as well as considerable expansion and revision of the poems already written, especially of that long poem called "Proto-Leaf" in 1860 and "Starting from Paumanok" thereafter, and also of the poem "So Long!" There is good evidence to date this second period of composition in the spring and summer of 1859; and it seems to have been in the summer or early autumn of 1859 that as a unit he turned over all these manuscripts to his friends, the Brooklyn printers Rome Brothers, to be typeset and proofs pulled. The typesetting seems not to have been designed to print an edition, but instead merely for the purpose of providing Whitman with printed proofs from which he could continue with the final revision. When, later, he went to Boston to oversee the printing of the third edition by Thayer and Eldridge, this in March of 1860, he provided Thayer and Eldridge with much of their printer's copy in the form of these Rome Brothers' proofs, considerably revised, as well as with some new manuscript material. The Valentine-Barrett manuscripts represent the actual manuscripts which Whitman turned over in 1859 to Rome Brothers to be set up for proofs. They were not themselves the printer's copy for the 1860 text, since the lost revised proofs were that copy, but by comparing the final state of the manuscripts with the 1860 printed versions we can reconstruct the revisions which Whitman made in the Rome Brothers' proofs. In those manuscripts which can be dated 1857 and earlier, there is a small amount of homosexual references but no serious emphasis on it. Moreover, the poems of this period which were later to become part of "Calamus" in 1860 are not specifically directed towards this theme and are in fact reasonably neutral in their attitude and subject. "Proto-Leaf," entitled in manuscript "Premonition," was a simple patriotic poem, its sexual lines still to be inserted by 1859 revision. Although most of the poems which can be assigned to 1859 are not numbered as in the 1857 list, yet two particular poems are assigned such numbers, and one of these is perhaps the most specifically calamus poem he wrote, part of the "Scented herbage of my breast" lines printed in 1860 as "Calamus" no. 2. The evidence seems to indicate that even this frankly calamus poem was composed before Whitman designed such a sequence. In fact, with the late exception of "Calamus," there is no hint in the manuscripts that at the time the papers were sent to Rome Brothers Whitman had planned a 'cluster' arrangement for his third edition. The cluster that is exemplified seems to be unique, although there is some slight evidence that another, to be called "Droppings," was forming in his mind, this perhaps to be associated with a group on the love for women. At any rate the cluster we have consists of a dozen poems which form the nucleus from which the "Calamus" group was to develop. They are written on small pieces of white wove paper and though now separated can be demonstrated to have formed originally part of a little notebook. Each poem is assigned a roman number I to XII. They are clearly fair copies, and indeed a draft for no. III is preserved elsewhere in the Valentine-Barrett Collection. What is of interest is not alone their text, not alone the revelation they provide of a group of poems whose original close association has been lost, but also the highly interesting fact that this sequence was originally entitled "Live Oak, with Moss" and that in its genesis the live oak, not the calamus plant, was Whitman's earliest symbol for 'manly love.' This has been previously suspected from two jottings reprinted by Bucke in which a proposed sequence on "the amative love of women" is first compared with "as Live Oak Leaves do the passion of friendship for man" (Bucke, p. 169), and, later, "as the Calamus-Leaves are to adhesiveness, manly love" (Bucke, p. 150). But here in these manuscripts is the proof, and the Live Oak sequence as originally planned. The first leaf of no. II was printed by Bucke (p. 51) from a manuscript found among Whitman's papers and in a text which has only one slight variant from that in the Valentine-Barrett manuscript. What seems to be a somewhat earlier version of the same poem is preserved in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library, cancelled by Whitman's characteristic diagonal stroke. That this little notebook in the Valentine-Barrett Collection may have been copied out and kept by Whitman as a kind of memento mori of the occasion the poems commemorate may be indicated by the inscription on the verso of the Berg copy: "Poems / A Cluster of Poems, Sonnets expressing the thoughts, pictures, aspirations &amp;c / Fit to the perused during the days of the approach of Death. / (that I have prepared myself for that purpose.—/ (Remember now—/ Remember then". However, this may be a jotting for other poems. Without further ado, however, I subtend the twelve poems reprinted from the manuscripts in the final versions of their texts without notes as to the originals of the various revisions contained in them. The original section title "Live Oak, with Moss" was subsequently crossed out and "Calamus-Leaves" written-in in an ink which seems to represent just about the final state of revision before the manuscripts were sent to the printer. Live Oak, with Moss I. Not the heat flames up and consumes, Not the sea-waves hurry in and out, Not the air, delicious and dry, the air of the ripe summer, bears lightly along white down-balls of myriads of seeds, wafted, sailing gracefully, to drop where they may, Not these—O none of these, more than the flames of me, consuming, burning for his love whom I love—O none, more than I, hurrying in and out; Does the tide hurry, seeking something, and never give up?—O I, the same, to seek my life-long lover; O nor down-balls, nor perfumes, nor the high rain-emitting clouds, are borne through the open air, more than my copious soul is borne through the open air, wafted in all directions, for friendship, for love.— II. I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing, All alone stood it, and the moss hung down from the branches, Without any companion it grew there, glistening out joyous leaves of dark green, And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself; But I wondered how it could utter joyous leaves, standing alone there without its friend, its lover—For I knew I could not; And I plucked a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and twined around it a little moss, and brought it away—And I have placed it in sight in my room, It is not needed to remind me as of my friends, (for I believe lately I think of little else than of them,) Yet it remains to me a curious token—it makes me think of manly love, For all that, and though the live oak glistens there in Louisiana, solitary in a wide flat space, uttering joyous leaves all its life, without a friend, a lover, near—I know very well I could not. III 3 When I heard at the close of the day how I had been praised in the Capitol, still it was not a happy night for me that followed; Nor when I caroused—Nor when my favorite plans were accomplished—was I really happy, But that day I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, electric, inhaling sweet breath, When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morn- ing light, When I wandered alone over the beach, and undressing, bathed, laughing with the waters, and saw the sun rise, And when I thought how my friend, my lover, was coming, then O then I was happy; Each breath tasted sweeter—and all that day my food nourished me more—And the beautiful day passed well, And the next came with equal joy—And with the next, at evening, came my friend, And that night, while all was still, I heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands, as directed to me, whispering to congratulate me,—For my friend I love lay sleeping by my side, In the stillness his face was inclined towards me, while the moon's clear beams shone, And his arm lay lightly over my breast—And that night I was happy. IV. This moment as I sit alone, yearning and pensive, it seems to me there are other men, in other lands, yearning and pensive. It seems to me I can look over and behold them, in Germany, France, Spain— Or far away in China, India, or Russia—talking other dialects, And it seems to me if I could know those men I should love them as I love men in my own lands, It seems to me they are as wise, beautiful, benevolent, as any in my own lands; O I think we should be brethren—I think I should be happy with them. V. Long I thought that knowledge alone would suffice me—O if I could but ob- tain knowledge! Then the Land of the Prairies engrossed me—the south savannas engrossed me— For them I would live—I would be their orator; Then I met the examples of old and new heroes—I heard of warriors, sailors, and all dauntless persons—And it seemed to me I too had it in me to be as dauntless as any, and would be so; And then to finish all, it came to me to strike up the songs of the New World— And then I believed my life must be spent in singing; But now take notice, Land of the prairies, Land of the south savannas, Ohio's land, Take notice, you Kanuck woods—and you, Lake Huron—and all that with you roll toward Niagara—and you Niagara also, And you, California mountains—that you all find some one else that he be your singer of songs, For I can be your singer of songs no longer—I have ceased to enjoy them. I have found him who loves me, as I him, in perfect love, With the rest I dispense—I sever from all that I thought would suffice me, for it does not,—it is now empty and tasteless to me, I heed knowledge, and the grandeur of The States, and the examples of heroes, no more, I am indifferent to my own songs—I am to go with him I love, and he is to go with me, It is to be enough for each of us that we are together—We never separate again.— VI. What think you I have taken my pen to record? Not the battle-ship, perfect-model'd, majestic, that I saw to day arrive in the offing, under full sail, Nor the splendors of the past day—nor the splendors of the night that envelopes me—Nor the glory and growth of the great city spread around me, But the two men I saw to-day on the pier, parting the parting of dear friends. The one to remain hung on the other's neck and passionately kissed him— while the one to depart tightly prest the one to remain in his arms. VII. You bards of ages hence! when you refer to me, mind not so much my poems, Nor speak of me that I prophesied of The States and led them the way of their glories, But come, I will inform you who I was underneath that impassive exterior—I will tell you what to say of me, Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover, The friend, the lover's portrait, of whom his friend, his lover, was fondest, Who was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of love within him—and freely poured it forth, Who often walked lonesome walks thinking of his dearest friends, his lovers, Who pensive, away from one he loved, often lay sleepless and dissatisfied at night, Who, dreading lest the one he loved might after all be indifferent to him, felt the sick feeling—O sick! sick! Whose happiest days were those, far away through fields, in woods, on hills, he and another, wandering hand in hand, they twain, apart from other men. Who ever, as he sauntered the streets, curved with his arm the manly shoulder of his friend—while the curving arm of his friend rested upon him also. VIII. 4 Hours continuing long, sore and heavy-hearted, Hours of the dusk, when I withdraw to a lonesome and unfrequented spot, seating myself, leaning my face in my hands, Hours sleepless, deep in the night, when I go forth, speeding swiftly the country roads, or through the city streets, or pacing miles and miles, stifling plaintive cries, Hours discouraged, distracted,—For he, the one I cannot content myself without —soon I saw him content himself without me, Hours when I am forgotten—(O weeks and months are passing, but I believe I am never to forget!) Sullen and suffering hours—(I am ashamed—but it is useless—I am what I am;) Hours of torment—I wonder if other men ever have the like, out of the like feelings? Is there even one other like me—distracted—his friend, his lover, lost to him? Is he too as I am now? Does he still rise in the morning, dejected, thinking who is lost to him? And at night, awaking, think who is lost? Does he too harbor his friendship silent and endless? Harbor his anguish and passion? Does some stray reminder, or the casual mention of a name, bring the fit back upon him, taciturn and deprest? Does he see himself reflected in me? In these hours does he see the face of his hours reflected? IX. I dreamed in a dream of a city where all the men were like brothers, O I saw them tenderly love each other—I often saw them, in numbers, walking hand in hand; I dreamed that was the city of robust friends—Nothing was greater there than manly love—it led the rest, It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city, and in all their looks and words.— X. O you whom I often and silently come where you are, that I may be with you, As I walk by your side, or sit near, or remain in the same room with you, Little you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake is playing within me.— XI. Earth! Though you look so impassive, ample and spheric there—I now suspect that is not all, I now suspect there is something terrible in you, ready to break forth, For an athlete loves me,—and I him—But toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me, I dare not tell it in words—not even in these songs. XII. To the young man, many things to absorb, to engraft, to develop, I teach, that he be my eleve, But if through him speed not the blood of friendship, hot and red—If he be not silently selected by lovers, and do not silently select lovers—of what use were it for him to seek to become eleve of mine? It seems clear that in these twelve poems, with somewhat franker text than Whitman allowed to be printed, we have the start of the later greatly expanded "Calamus" cluster. In connection with this little series three points may be mentioned. (1) The poems appear to be unified and to make up an artistically complete story of attachment, crisis, and reconstitution. (2) They are manifestly fair copies and may not represent the earliest form of such a notebook, if the inscription on the Berg manuscript is to be credited as referring to a previous copying-out of the cluster. The present texts were copied in a made-up notebook and written fair at the same or very nearly the same time.(3) The calamus symbol is nowhere mentioned in these poems, which instead, in no. I but especially in no. II, refer to the live oak. It is significant that the earliest sequence title was "Live Oak, with Moss" and that "Calamus-Leaves" was substituted shortly before the manuscripts were sent to the printer. The notebook of which these now separate leaves originally formed a part was made up of twenty leaves: by the contours of the paper it can be established that these poems were copied in the present order and that the present poems represent original leaves 1-17, leaving three blank leaves. That these leaves were originally blank and therefore that the sequence ended with no. XII can be demonstrated by the fact that later, in a different ink, what in 1860 were numbered "Calamus" 44 and 38 but which are unnumbered in manuscript were copied on paper that by its contours shows it was leaf 18 of the notebook, and no. 39 on what was leaf 19. Leaf 20 seems to have been used as part of a revision of the poem "So Long!" in the collection. The pen and ink used for the added poems on leaves 18 and 19 also appear to have written various other manuscripts on the same kind of white wove paper, including what was to become "Enfans d'Adam" no. 1 and "Calamus" nos. 1, part of 2, and 4. The writing of the section of no. 2 consisted of prefixed leaves to what was to become "Scented herbage of my breast", a poem the earliest part of which is chiefly written on the back of material that can be dated a few days before 15 March 1859. It is clear, therefore, that the roman-numbered Live Oak poems may have been copied out in their present manuscripts before March 1859, though a later date is not impossible, and that Whitman's true calamus-symbol poems come after mid-March of this year and on slender other evidence perhaps about June or July. Since it may seem plausible to believe that the calamus symbol was not contemporary with the live oak symbol but that one replaced the other as the theme for a sequence, and since the earliest known version of a calamus-symbol poem comes between March and June of 1859 when it was still planned to be part of a numbered non-cluster long sequence, the fact Whitman did not give his twelve Live Oak poems numbers in this sequence, and copied them in a form different from other manuscripts of about this date, may just possibly indicate some doubt in his mind whether he should print them. 5 If so, the doubt was soon removed, because within a comparatively few months he had cut the leaves apart, separated the poems (as indicated by fragmentary puzzling foliation) by dispersing them into some other order; and finally, apparently just before sending them off to be set in type, replaced the heading of the first sequence poem with the title "Calamus-Leaves" although in fact he had composed two new calamus poems which, in the same manner as nos. I and II of Live Oak introduce the symbol, and by any standards should have been placed at the beginning of the sequence as indeed they were in 1860. The original continuity, if not consanguinity, of the twelve Live Oak poems thus destroyed, Whitman's original 'sonnet' sequence to manly love went unrecognized until the Valentine-Barrett manuscripts became available for study.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Richard Bucke, Notes and Fragments (1899), p. 57; see also Camden Edition (1902), IX, 6. 2 Rollo Silver, "Seven Letters of Walt Whitman," American Literature, VII (1935), 76-78. 3 An earlier version of this poem is preserved on the verso of a leaf of one of the late additions to "Premonition" i.e. "Proto-Leaf." The final three verses in the present manuscript were revised on a paste-over slip. These and similar details will be presented complete in the edited text of these manuscripts. 4 This number VIII is a revision, written above an original IX. Whether this was an inadvertent mistake, or a reflection of an earlier numbering system, is not certain. However, from the tip of the IX of the next poem found on the bottom cut-off of the last leaf here, it is clear that there has been no misplacement and that the intention was to copy this in the notebook as VIII. In the right-hand portion of the text of the second verse is the erased pencil note "(finished, in / the other city)" in Whitman's hand. Owing to the position, however, this reference could possibly apply to the end of poem VII. 5 In truth, the difference in the form of the manuscript may have some significance, but the lack of numbering could have none. Most of the 1859-composed poems are not numbered, though some have foliation to indicate that some arrangement(s) had been essayed.</field>
