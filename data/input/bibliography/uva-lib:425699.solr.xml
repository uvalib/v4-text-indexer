      <field name="heading_text">The "Company" of Printers by Cyprian Blagden</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Christopher Barker was perhaps the first to perceive, as he was certainly the first to record, the shift of power in the Stationers' Company away from the printers who had worked for the charter of incorporation and towards the booksellers who were the chief beneficiaries by it. In his "note of the state of the Company of Printers, Bookesellers, and Bookebynders comprehended vnder the name of Stacioners" 1 he regretted firstly that, by the charter, printing had not been confined to " Printers-Stacioners " but had been allowed to any member of the Company; and secondly that, by the operation of economic necessity, the valuable copyrights had passed from the printers to the booksellers who "keepe no printing howse, neither beare any charge of letter, or other furniture but onlie paye for the workmanship, and haue the benefit, both of the imprinting, and the sale" of such books. Barker did not presume to offer his detailed solution of the problem unless Lord Burleigh were to ask for it; but he put his finger on the two main grievances of master-printers for the next 100 years: the practice of the printer's craft by those not trained to it, and the power of the booksellers—dominance in the trade leading to dominance in the corporation—to make rules for what had taken shape in 1557 as a Company of Printers. Some of the new group of 'trade' printers, like Danter and Creede, staked claims to the printing of certain books, regardless of who owned the 'copy', and recorded these in the register. 2 This was an ingenious way of stopping the rot, but it could operate only under the supervision of the Court of Assistants and it was perhaps likely to operate only while printers still exercised power on the Court; by 1603 they were already outnumbered and in 1640 there were only two. The possession of patents for classes of profitable books maintained the prestige and prosperity of a few big printers, like Bynneman and Marsh, during the greater part of Elizabeth's reign. But by the 1590s the Day and Seres patents were being worked by assigns under the general control of the Court, 3 and in 1603 these two privileges, with the almanack patent, were regranted to the Company by James I. This grant was the basis of the English Stock which the booksellers, as the commercial element in the Company, quickly came to dominate. 4 George Unwin has shown 5 how similar developments occurred in other London companies during the sixteenth century and how, for instance, an industrial section, the Feltmakers, rebelled successfully against the dominating merchant interest in the Haberdashers' Company and won, by Act of Parliament in 1604, independent corporate existence. It would be surprising if the printers had not worked for their separation from the Stationers, but the evidence for such a movement in the first half of the seventeenth century is limited to one document. This is "The Petition of the Masters and Workmen Printers of London" to the knights, citizens and burgesses then (probably 1628) assembled in Parliament. 6 It refers to the incorporation in 1557 of the "Printers together with some Booke-Binders and Booke-Sellers" and to the later investment of the government of the Company "(by what power we know not) . . . [in] divers persons under the name of Assistants, who together with the . . . Master and Wardens being Booke-Sellers . ., have assumed . . . the sole . . . Ordering of the Science and Mystery of Printing", to its detriment and (as usual) to the danger of Church and State. The masters and workmen printers, in apparent agreement, pray that the King in Parliament will give them power to regulate printing and printers and will cancel patents granted to those who have no knowledge of the printing craft. This document, whatever its date, is the first public acknowledgment, not that there were too many presses, or too little reputable work for journeymen, or too many foreigners, but that the interests of printers and booksellers were different, that the latter were in control of the former and that the employer and the employed were for once united against a common danger. The appeal for assistance was in the vaguest terms, except that "We the said Artificers may alone be stated in all those lawfull immunities and priviledges" which by right belonged to them. This might, I suppose, have been achieved within the pattern of the Stationers' Company, but at no time do the Court minutes give any indication of official reaction. The Star Chamber Decree of 1637, a neat piece of cooperation between the central government and the Company against heretical, seditious and piratical printing, limited the number of master-printers in London to twenty and the King's Printers, and to the three each allowed at Oxford and Cambridge. But on 5 July 1641 Charles I gave his consent to the abolition of the Court of Star Chamber and removed the basis for the authority which the booksellers had exercised, with some success, over the printers. For the next few years the printers flourished and multiplied; when the Council of State was constrained in the autumn of 1649 to take recognizances from printers against the production of seditious and unlicensed books, the twenty in London had grown to thirty-six and the printers were strong enough to break, more blatantly than before and often with impunity, the rules of the Company—particularly by binding, at Scriveners, apprentices in excess of their permitted number and by employing, as journeymen, those not free of the City. That the printers as a group made no attempt in 1645 to exploit the Sparke-led revolution in the Company 7 shows, I think, not weakness but a determination to go their own way; and in the course of 1651 they petitioned the Committee for the Regulating of Printing that they might be made a Fraternity or Company distinct from the Stationers. I know nothing more of this petition than that it was unsuccessful and that when William Ball wrote A briefe treatise concerning the regulating of printing 8 (received by Thomason on 24 November 1651) he devoted a section to condemning "their not only unsound, but even dangerous Petition, and desires", and to refuting their argument that, since the Apothecaries had successfully broken away from the Grocers, the printers could exist apart from the Stationers. With the return of Charles II in May 1660 the Stationers looked to see "their wonted power confirmed", the absence of which they had admitted to Thomason in Court on 5 February 1655; and the printers, scenting a return to pre-1641 conditions, made another bid for separate incorporation. The first bill for the regulation of printing was dropped in July 1661 because the House of Commons would not accept a Lords amendment that the houses of peers be exempt from search. 9 But early in 1662 a new bill was introduced and, after representations to the Lords from certain printers and a counter-petition from the Company 10 , "An Act for preventing the frequent Abuses in printing seditious . . . Books . . . and for regulating of Printing and Printing Presses" 11 received the royal assent on 19 May and put the clock firmly back to 1637. 12 On 20 June the printers were summoned to Stationers' Hall to hear the new Act read and to learn that, as occasion occurred, the number permitted to keep a printing house was to be reduced to twenty. The success of the bookselling element was probably achieved by two letters from the King to the Commons—letters which Secretary Nicholas wrote and for which he was rewarded by a fee, representing in equal proportions the gratitude of the Company, of the English Stock partners and of the King's Printers. On 11 May 1663 the printers were again ordered to present themselves and their journeymen at the Hall at ten o'clock the following morning, so that a count of printing houses and operatives could be made. "59 Mr. Printers were acknowledged; some of ym seemed to be angry at their sumons." 13 Within the next few months, and probably before 15 August when Sir Roger L'Estrange was appointed Surveyor of the Press, eleven of them had petitioned the King to grant them independence. This petition, which is in manuscript and which has three manuscript enclosures 14 , has been tentatively dated 1660/1. The third of the enclosures, the "Reasons", refers to "the last Act for Printing"; I am sure that this must be the Act of 1662 since it would hardly be tactful, in a document addressed to Charles II, to refer to that of 1653. Moreover, the two printed references to incorporation, both of 1663, 15 point to this year and the incident at Stationers' Hall to the early summer. 16 The second enclosure, the "Expedients", reads as if it were addressed to Parliament rather than to the King and is possibly a copy of the memorandum (now lost) sent by the printers to the Lords in January 1662; it suggests that twelve printers be appointed to conduct searches "untill the Affair of Printing be settled by Act", and it prays that the printers, after incorporation, be given certain powers by Act of Parliament. The first enclosure outlines the machinery by which the incorporated printers would control the press and obviously goes with the petition. The watermarks on all three enclosures are the same but the "Expedients" paper is an inch shorter than the others. It is quite understandable (if I am right in my dating) that the earlier document, or a copy of it, should be added to the later papers on the same subject and it is not surprising that it should be in the same handwriting as the "Reasons". In the petition itself the eleven signatories, pointing out that men will always find ways of avoiding rules laid down by Act of Parliament, appeal directly to the King that the printers may be incorporated and thereby provide the only possible answer to irregularities in the press. The supporting "Reasons" can be divided into those which might carry weight with the King and his advisers and those which were important to the printers themselves. The former were, first, that only printers had enough technical knowledge to make effective searchers of printers' premises for seditious and heretical books, papers and pamphlets; second, that only by incorporation will printers be sufficiently encouraged to expose these dangerous publications and that twelve months' good management will show results; third, that the Stationers' Company had grown so large that a man reached a place of responsibility only when he was too old for active searching; fourth, that searches were conducted for the discovery rather of copyright infringement than of heretical or seditious printing; fifth, that such printing disturbs the mind and takes it "off from solid reading of Divinity, History or Romance"; sixth, that there were plenty of precedents for separating one mystery from control by another where there were conflicts of interest—the Apothecaries from the Grocers, for instance, and the Feltmakers from the Haberdashers; and seventh, that the printers were ready to forfeit their privilege if they did not discover all illegal printing. The real reasons were that the booksellers dominated the Stationers' Company and contrived "daily the hurt and detriment of the Printers"; the latter hardly ever reached the highest offices; 17 and the former, who stood to gain most from the sale of illegal books, encouraged a superfluity of printers whose need would compel them to undertake dangerous work. These fundamental reasons were elaborated in A brief discourse concerning printing and printers , which was printed "for a Society of Printers" in 1663. The charter of 1557 "and concorporation, . . were without doubt made in favour of Printers, and for their encouragement and security . . . [and] might conduce to their well-being then, when the Book-sellers were very few, and as inconsiderable, and so the Printers sufficient to hold the balance even." But in 1663 the booksellers "are grown so bulkie and numerous (together with many of several other Trades that they have taken in) and so considerable withal (being much enriched by Printers impoverishment . . .) that there is hardly one Printer to ten others that have a share in the Government of the Company". Moreover, few young master-printers had in recent years been able to make a bid for the copies of an old printer and "the Booksellers having engros'd almost all, it is become a question among them, whether a Printer ought to have any copy or no: or if he have, they (keeping the Register) will hardly enter it. . . ." Worst of all, "to compleat the abuse, and to encourage others in the like, they erect a Printing-house by a joynt stock of their own, and call it, The Companies House ". 18 The only solution was that the printers be independent, for, the writer concluded, "as reasonably . . . may the Buyer have the Rule of the Seller, as the Book-seller govern the Printer". The most interesting of the enclosures (no. I) sets out in twenty-four clauses the methods by which incorporation would lead to efficient management of the press. The new company would have power to draft by-laws for the approval of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London in addition to the statutory approval of the Lord Chancellor and the Lords Chief Justice, and power to search not only printing houses but, because a protectionist policy would encourage the printing of, for instance, the classics rather than dangerous pamphlets, any shop or warehouse suspected of harbouring imported books. Master-printers would have to enter into bonds of b 300 and journeymen into bonds of g 50 not to print seditious matter and to report any rumour of such printing known to them; for a first offence the bond would be forfeited and for a second offence a printer would suffer disfranchisement and further fines if he continued printing. Everyone engaged in the craft would have to serve a seven-year apprenticeship, and thereafter to be free of the new company and licensed before setting up (penalties b 100 per press and b 50 per month). The corporation would be fined if it allowed the binding of an apprentice in excess of the agreed numbers. The high cost of serving "the King and the Kingdom" would be met by fines and by remission of all dues to the City, and the King would be financially responsible for prosecutions. The new Society would be incorporated as a "ffellowship of Master, and Wardens, and Assistants", 19 who would hold a Court at least once a month; but one Warden and six Assistants would be chosen commissioners for three months at a time, to meet every Monday, to conduct searches, to bring offenders against Church or State before a Justice of the Peace, and to provide evidence for offences against copyright. Records would be kept of the homes and working places of all printers, with changes of address, so that "every particular mans Actions and ffootsteps may be the better observed and traced" (an echo from the earlier "Expedients" in which one of the duties of the new corporation would be "to trace the ffootsteps of every Member"); there would be weekly declarations by masters of work put in hand and annual reports by the company of all legal proceedings taken. The names of the author and the printer would appear on every piece of printing. The corporation would have a register for all new copies (and a transcript of the old Stationers' registers) and the right to print, in a joint stock or not, copies of deceased proprietors and manuscripts in any public library. Most important of all, at least one third, and preferably one half, of the shares in the English Stock should be made over by the Stationers to the new company, with the right to elect a proper proportion of Stock-keepers to watch their interests; it was argued that at least one third of the Stationers were printers and that at least one third of the Stock was owned by printers. Why was the appeal unsuccessful? In the first place, there was opposition from the Stationers' Company; any corporation would protest against the breaking away of a third of its members and the booksellers were able not only to muster an overwhelming majority on the Court but to make direct approaches to those close to the King—to Secretary Nicholas, for instance, as I have already mentioned, and to Lauderdale (over the patent for printing in Scotland). Moreover, there would be a strong temptation for the King's advisers rather to pin their faith to an arrangement which, but for the Civil War, might have worked satisfactorily than to sponsor a quite untried method. The Star Chamber Decree of 1637 may have seemed to them, as it did to the author of The London printer his lamentation , 20 "the best and most exquisite Form and Constitution for the good Government and regulation of the Press"; and the Decree had been supported by, and could only be worked with the aid of, the Stationers' Company. In the second place, L'Estrange was not in favour of a Printers' Company, and he had sufficient influence at Court to obtain the post of Surveyor of the Press in August 1663. On 28 May he procured a licence for his Considerations and proposals in order to the regulation of the press , 21 just over a fortnight after the meeting at Stationers' Hall when the printers had been 'angry'. L'Estrange says some hard, and interesting, things about the booksellers, and he maintains that there "must be some way to Disengage the Printers from that Servile and Mercenary Dependence upon the Stationers , unto which they are at present subjected". But, in his opinion, the solution was not, as the printers proposed, by separate incorporation, for "It were a hard matter to Pick out Twenty Master-Printers , who are both Free of the Trade , of Ability to Menage it, and of Integrity to be Entrusted with it"; moreover, "it would be with Them , as 'tis with Other Incorporate Societies : They would be True to the Publique , so far as stands with the Particular Good of the Company . But Evidently Their Gain lyes the other way." In the third place, the printers themselves were not united. Why did only eleven out of about sixty master-printers sign the petition to the King? Even if the eleven were acting on behalf of a majority of their fellow employers, how far were their journeymen, for whom they said they were speaking, in favour of the break? Between 1650 and 1658 there were seven complaints to the Court by workmen printers against various malpractices of their masters, and in 1660 the London Printer in his Lamentation bewailed the excessive number of printing houses and the complete lack of training and experience in some of those who ran them. It is possible that the grumblers no more represented the general body of workmen than the eleven spoke for the masters; but the existence among the printers of even a small element which was inclined to seek support from the booksellers on the Court would provide a further argument, for anyone looking for such, against giving the masters even more power over their employees. Support was sometimes sought from higher authority than the Court of the Stationers' Company. In a petition, 22 probably to the Archbishop of Canterbury, the journeymen hark back nostalgically to the provisions of the 1637 Decree, with particular reference to the limitation in the numbers of apprentices, and draw attention to the increase, since the abolition of the Star Chamber Court, both of presses and of Dutch and other unfree workmen, some of whom were trained in the University printing-houses. The foreigners are said to outnumber free workmen Stationers and to be preferred for secret printing because they had sworn no oath to obey the rules of the Company. The purpose of the document is obscure; it is headed "The Grievances of The Workemen Printers . . . by Way of affermation of their Pettition" and begins with the statement that the manual work in all regular printing houses is done by compositors and pressmen, while the master's job is to provide and oversee the work. But it concludes with the more interesting statement that "There be 35 Printing Houses above the Number alowed of By the Decree of Starre Chamber . . ." and it lists both these thirty-five (with comments on some of them) and also seventeen legitimate houses which have not "crep up by reason of the late troubles". In the accompanying Table I have arranged these fifty-two masterprinters in alphabetical order and, in an attempt to discover who were the fifty-nine acknowledged to be active in 1663, I have added those whose names occur in L'Estrange's four search warrants of 1667 23 and in his survey of 1668. 24 To make the picture a little fuller, I have given the dates of freedom (with a note if this was achieved other than by service) and indicated those whose businesses were officially approved in 1637 and gave recognizances in 1649, those who were summoned on 30 November 1664 to give the Assistants their opinion about the control of printing, and those who did work for and had shares in the English Stock between 1660 and 1668. My tally of the fifty-nine masterprinters in 1663 consists of those whose names appear in the 1660 list (fifty without Hunt, who died in 1660, and the Greek House) and Henry Bridges, Andrew Coe, Edward Crouch, John Darby, John Owsley, George Purslowe, John Rawlins, Roger Vaughan and the other Wood. 25 I had hoped that the Table would separate the printers into groups with recognizable patterns of behaviour; but I can see no correlation between any two—or more—of the classes into which they can be divided: those whose presses were licensed, those who held shares in the English Stock, those who printed Stock books, those who put their names to the petition for incorporation, those who were summoned to give advice to the governing body of their Company. Official recognition, investment opportunity, economic necessity and gild ambition were so inextricably confused in a printer's life that it was impossible for a sufficient number of masters and journeymen to agree for long enough to win independence. The Plague and the Fire put the possibility still further into the background, and in 1667 Charles II granted the Stationers' Company a new charter which was an exact recital of the 1557 original. But L'Estrange kept alive the idea of a Printers' Company. On Tuesday 10 June 1679, the very day on which the Printing Act (in spite of the efforts of the Stationers) was allowed to lapse, he wrote to Henry Coventry, Principal Secretary of State, and enclosed "The Printers Reasons" for separate incorporation. 26 The previous Friday, according to L'Estrange, over a score of printers had voluntarily offered to serve the King on condition that they be incorporated and be given the normal powers of a company, and that they have their share of the English Stock according to their numbers. The business cannot be finished till after the King's return, but L'Estrange urges Coventry to encourage the printers to think more about it (revealing thereby that L'Estrange was keener than the printers) and to continue the observance of the licensing rules laid down in the Act. If this opportunity be lost it may never occur again, "ffor ye Booksellers (especially ye ffactious Part) fall foul upon ye Print rs allready, and upon my self too; and ye Printers are utterly ruin'd for their Loyalty, if they be not protected in it." This time the precedent quoted is that of the Tinmen who, because of oppression and ill-usage at the hands of the Ironmongers, achieved separate incorporation "as to the working part of their Trade" and continued to enjoy the privileges of the Ironmongers. The printers' "Reasons" contain the usual arguments that, by their experience, they are better searchers of printing-houses than booksellers and less tempted by profit (the ratio of temptation being b 5 to b 50) not to suppress libels. It is now suggested that the number of printing-houses be thirty, which can be more easily searched and kept in order than 800 Stationers, "especially when every one is a spy upon his ffellow". The conclusion is an assurance to justify, on oath, that the booksellers give private warning of impending searches, refuse licensed work to those printers who will not print unlicensed, and deny informers their promised rewards for discoveries. Two days later L'Estrange again wrote to Coventry. Both parties had been ordered to prepare their proposals for press control and to attend the Attorney General on Thursday, the day on which L'Estrange was writing; but, though the printers turned up, the booksellers waited till Tuesday—perhaps because they thought they would do better if the King had left town. Poor L'Estrange could sense the opportunity slipping while he was confined to his bed with gout; and the printers, whom he must have been nursing against the booksellers, were beginning to weaken. "There has been great Art and Industry used by fair words and by menaces, to corrupt ye Printers"; and one of them, a "prating" fellow, had reported to L'Estrange, with evident satisfaction, the dictum of the Attorney General that "he would neither meddle nor make in ye matter". L'Estrange's only comfort is that a "Sober Person"—of possible future use to his lordship—has promised to put him on his legs again in a couple of days. And there the story of the printers' bids for independence comes to a whimpering end or disappears for want of evidence. When the City Companies were compelled in 1684 to surrender their charters to the King, the printers and booksellers stood together and the Stationers' Company was the first to receive a new grant from Charles II. 27 The divisions were then along political and religious lines rather than along those of trade rivalry, and they continued so until the accession of William III. The Printing Act, revived by James II, lapsed finally in 1695 and made possible the nation-wide expansion of printing which had been bottled up in London. The next hundred years brought an interesting reversal of attitude; while the printers grew reasonably contented within the Stationers' Company, the booksellers resorted to combinations outside the antiquated gild framework. 1660-1668 Eng.

Of the two copies known to me, one is in the Bagford and the other in the Thomason collection (B.M. Harl.5910, i, ff. 142-3 and 669.f.4 no.79); the latter is undated in manuscript but catalogued among the broadsides received in March 1642. Four patents are referred to in it: (1) that of Christopher and Robert Barker, the reversion of which was granted, on 16 September 1635, to Robert's sons, Charles and Matthew; (2) the Law Patent "lately confirmed to Iohn More", the date of this confirmation being 19 January 1618; (3) the privilege for books in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, the property of Roger Norton who, according to the Court Book, was active at least as early as 1633; and (4) the patent "lately granted to one Thomas Symcocke", for briefs etc. printed on one side of a sheet, which was dated 30 October 1619 and terminated by agreement in October 1631 (see pp. xvi ff. of Wm. A. Jackson's Introduction to the Records of the Court of the Stationers' Company, 1602 to 1640, 1957). I cannot believe that the petitioners could have been ignorant of the Symcock settlement and I find it difficult to believe that, as late as 1642, they would have referred to the others in the terms quoted. Antedating the petition to April 1640, when the Short Parliament met, will not help; the last Parliament before this was dissolved in March 1629. It is possible that Thomason received a copy only in March 1642 and that he did not date it because he was not sure when it was printed. I favour 1627/8 for the printing, the first gild year in which neither the Master nor the Wardens were printers; the Master, George Cole, was a Proctor in the Court of Arches (see the reference to outsiders, p. 9 below). It was during this gild year (3 March 1628) that the printers engaged on English Stock work were censured by the Court. 7 See The Library , 5th ser. xiii, 1958, pp.10-3, for a full account of this. 8 Reprinted in The Struggle for the Freedom of the Press , 1934, by William M. Clyde. It is possible that Henry Hills, who had the ear of the Army leaders, was involved in the failure of this attempt to form a Company of Printers. On 22 August Fleetwood's third letter (in three weeks) to the Stationers about Hills's admission to their Company was read to "divers Printers" who resolved to appeal to the Lord Mayor; there is no sign that they did. 9 A compromise was reached on this clause the following year. Among the House of Lords Papers, under the date 27 July 1661, are two petitions relating to copyrights. The first is from Thomas Clarke and his wife Jane, the late wife and executrix of Nicholas Bourne, and prays that the right to print bills of lading and Virginia indentures be specifically covered in the Act; this was successful, for an interlinear amendment to the draft (filed under 16 January 1662) reads "or formes of blanke bills or Indentures for any his Majesty's Islands". The other is from Peter Cole (see the comments on him in f.n.5 to the Table). He has invested £5000, partly his own money and partly from the estates of thirteen orphans, in printing books of Anatomy, Surgery and Medicine and fears that the expense of licensing will ruin him. He appends firstly, lists of the books already printed and of those in the press with their retail prices, and secondly, a draft clause to excuse him the formality of getting licenses provided the work is done by a licensed printer (which Cole was not) and provided Cole's name and address are given on all books. No notice was taken of this. These petitions, and those mentioned in the following footnote, illustrate the fears which the prospect of the Act aroused, the pressures brought to bear on the legislators, and the dependence of the Stationers' copyright control machinery on government support. 10 House of Lords Papers, 16 January 1662. The Company refers to "some addresses . . . lately made . . . by certaine printers" and prays to give reasons, by counsel or otherwise, against these and against Chetwind's suggestions. The printers may have put forward a plea for separate incorporation along the lines of the "Expedients" of 1663 (see p. 8 below), but all the Stationers told the Lords in 1662 was that the printers aimed to obstruct the passing of the Bill and to gain the estates of the petitioners. Philip Chetwind, a Clothworker who had married Mary, the widow of Robert Allot, claims in his petition to have been swindled out of Allot's copies (he does not mention Shakespeare) by John Legate and Andrew Crooke, who acted as trustees because Chetwind was not a Stationer; and he submits a draft clause to allow him and his wife to enter in the register and to enjoy copies like other booksellers. A draft clause extending the principle to all widows and orphans is also attached; but, in spite of the Bishop of Durham's support, the amendment was not adopted. See the printers' comments on the owning of copies, p. 9 below. 11 To come into operation on 10 June. See A. W. Pollard's article in Trans. Bib. Soc. n.s. iii, 1922, pp. 100-2. 12 The 1661 draft is filed under the date 16 January 1662 and amendments to it under 19 May, when the Bill received the royal assent. In the draft the printers at the Universities were to be allowed as many apprentices as they thought fit but to find work for their own journeymen and not allow them to clutter the London labour market. In spite of an instruction to the Attorney General to compare this with the corresponding clause (no.XXII) in the 1637 Decree, it was deleted. Only by amendment was Cambridge to be treated like Oxford and receive a free copy of every book published. By amendment too, the filling of vacant places among masterprinters and letter-founders was altered from the presenting of candidates by the Company and the printers for approval by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, to straight nomination by the latter, who probably insisted, also, on the limitation in the number of masterprinters; the booksellers would have liked to control the appointment of new masterprinters and would have benefited from the competition which a large number of presses would ensure. 13 This revealing phrase occurs only in the 'Waste' Court Book and was not transcribed in the fair copy. 14 S. P. Dom. Car. II, vol. 22, nos 8 and 8 I-III. The titles of the enclosures to the petition are: I. "In Order to the better Regulating of the Press, for the Prevention of Treasonable, . . . . . Books . . . . . , It is humbly offered." II. "Expedients for the Prevention of Printing Treasonable . . . . Books, . . . . &amp;c." III. "Reasons humbly offered to his Most Sacred Majesty . . . . . Why the Printers (Masters and Workmen) should be Incorporated . . . ." H. R. Plomer, in his Short History of English Printing , 2nd ed. 1915, pp. 167-9, gives a brief summary of these documents. 15 See below, p. 9. 16 Another small pointer is a reference in clause 1 of enclosure III to the incorporation of the Distillers as a separate entity "since yr Maties happy Restauration". Mr Kellaway, of the Guildhall Library, has kindly verified for me that the Distillers received their charter in 1638 but obtained approval of their ordinances only on 20 June 1663; the confusion between charter and ordinances is understandable. 17 Only two printers were Master of the Company between 1635 and 1668: Felix Kingston in 1635/6 and 1636/7, and Miles Flesher (whose press was managed by his son James from about 1650) in 1652/3, 1653/4, 1662/3 and 1663/4. Only four others served as Warden in the same period. George Miller, John Legate, Roger Norton and Evan Tyler. 18 I do not know what this means. It cannot be an allusion to the warehouse of the English Stock (which was at the Hall), but it may refer to the printing-house at Leith, which had been bought in 1647 as part of the Scotch Patent and was run, on the Company's behalf, by Christopher Higgins until he died in 1668. In the Court minutes for 3 June 1647 there is reference to "the new printing house" in London, where Bibles were being printed; this must, I think, have been the King's Printing House, of which the Company had bought Bill's share and were renting the Barker share. 19 It reads almost as if, after their long exclusion from the Court of the Stationers' Company, the printers were determined that all should be Assistants! In the petition the number of Wardens is given as two and a space is left for the number of Assistants. 20 September 1660. 21 "Printed by A[ndrew] C[oe] June 3 d M.DC. LXIII." but not entered, according to clause 3 of the Act, in the Stationers' register! 22 Lambeth MS 941, nos 61 &amp; 62, probably 1660. 23 S.P.Dom. Car.II, vol. 99, nos 162-5. These are tentatively dated June 1664, but the absence of those who were ruined by the Fire puts the date after September 1666 and the presence of Ibbitson, who died in 1667, puts it before 1668. The four lists are differentiated as a, b, c and d. 24 S.P.Dom. Car.II, vol. 243, no.126, 24 July. Plomer, op.cit. , pp. 185-6, prints the list as it appears in the original. 25 The list is based first on the individuals , men or women, whose surnames (but not, alas, Christian names) occur in the Lambeth list of 1660; the freedoms are those of the men in this list and of the men listed by L'Estrange in 1667 and 1668. Only an old printer like Richard Hodgkinson and Thomas Ratcliffe runs right through the thirty-one years covered by the Table; in many cases there is a concealed succession from master to widow, from father to son, or from brother to brother. There is a tear in the Lambeth manuscript which has removed the name of an unlicensed printer; it is probably that of Henry Hills who is mentioned in the body of the document. 26 Coventry Papers, vol.

      <field name="heading_text">The Compositors of Henry IV, Part 2, Much Ado About Nothing, The Shoemakers' Holiday , and The First Part of the Contention by W. Craig Ferguson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first quarto of 2 Henry IV was set by a single compositor. This can be demonstrated from several typographical and spelling peculiarities, but most forcefully by a single idiosyncrasy not generally observed in books of the period. When the compositor of an Elizabethan dramatic text set speech-prefixes, whether abbreviated or unabbreviated, it was usual for him to put a stop after the prefix, thus setting it off from the following text. An examination of the dramatic texts printed from manuscript in the three years 1599, 1600, and 1601 illustrates the general acceptance of this convention. There were 28 plays 1 printed for the first time in these years, 22 of them by printers other than Simmes. Prefixes without stops after them did occasionally appear: there were two in Two Angry Women of Abingdon , and two more in Jack Drum's Entertainment . In two of the plays where numbers were used as prefixes, there were occasional unstoppedtags. 2 No other unstopped prefixes appeared in the 22 texts. In the first quarto of 2 Henry IV , printed in Valentine Simmes's shop, this convention was completely reversed; in almost every case where a full name is used as a speech-prefix there is no mark of punctuation after it. Unabbreviated prefixes appear in 69 of the 80 pages of the text; there are 335 such prefixes and in all but five of these occurrences there is no stop after the prefix. The speech-prefixes occur in the text as follows: A2 v 3 v 4 v v B1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v C1 v Abbreviated: -- 4 3 3 4 6 10 12 18 2 8 10 6 full, unstopped: -- 3 4 4 2 1 2 3 8 3 5 8 1 8 full, stopped: 1 2 v 3 v 4 v D1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v E1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v 9 7 13 5 2 3 3 3 5 10 8 13 13 13 6 8 8 8 16 13 13 7 5 15 9 14 11 19 4 3 4 2 2 1 3 9 10 7 5 1 1 1 1 1 F1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v G1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v H1 v 2 v 3 v 22 18 16 12 7 2 2 4 5 4 3 3 7 4 7 8 2 8 3 2 9 11 2 5 1 2 3 6 3 3 1 2 3 8 7 7 1 4 3 2 7 1 4 v I1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v K1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v L1 v 6 1 5 7 10 11 5 1 8 14 9 7 14 7 8 -- 5 3 1 1 7 7 5 3 1 8 9 10 6 3 2 8 -- 1 There are other typographical features in this text which, in their uniformity, both attest to setting by a single compositor and exhibit some of his typographical characteristics. We note first that the compositor does not distinguish names, titles, or territories by setting them in a contrasting type-fount. Thus the body of the text is in roman with no italic type introduced into it (except for four Latin words), and on the other hand the speech-prefixes and stage directions are set wholly in italic. In 2 Henry IV there is a sparing use of emphasis capitals and of parentheses: both are found where a reader would expect to find them in a modern text. The result is that the type-pages have an even and regular appearance; the body of the text is set in a single fount unbroken by the interspersal of italic type or superfluous capital letters. It is always a neat and well planned page. The stage-directions are treated in a regular way. Apart from exits, there are 58 stage-directions in the text. Forty-two are centred on the page, and in all but two of the centred directions the initial letter is a capital. Where the directions are flush right, half have capitals and half have lower-case initial letters. All directions end with periods. There are 17 exits in this text, all in correct Latin. They consist of the words exit or exeunt (occasionally abbreviated) and sometimes the names of the characters concerned. No exits are centred; most (13) are placed at the end of a line, but four are set slightly in from the right-hand margin. Only three exits do not end with stops. Whereas the centred stage-directions almost invariably begin with capitals, the practice with exits is to use a lower-case ' e .' Only one exit begins with a capital. The catchwords are notable for brevity. Only one word is used as a catchword, and in the one instance where the rather long word, "inuincible" is to be the catchword, only the first two syllables, "inuinare" given. As often happens in a dramatic text, speech-prefixes form many catchwords; in no case is the first word of the speech also given in the catchword. The signatures are regular throughout the book. They consist of a roman capital, arabic numeral, no stop, and a narrow quad between letter and number. The signature is always set with the catchword on a separate line, but there is no set positioning of the signature in relation to margins or the beginning of the catchword. A spelling analysis of this text yields results which support the view that it was set by a single compositor. Where two or more compositors are at work in a text, spellings peculiar to each man tend in analysis to separate out and occur mainly on the pages set by that workman. In 2 Henry IV the spelling variants occur at random throughout the text and fail to conform to any bibliographical units. An examination of the verse passages alone also produces a random scattering of variants; ten words occur in this text in which the spelling variations make little or no difference to their length, but these again provide no recognizable pattern. Another method of attempting to distinguish compositors by spelling habits is to examine classes of variants which are subject to habitual treatment. This is especially valuable in a prose text, where large numbers of variants will form a definite pattern. Three classes of variants were examined: the use of a final letter ' e ', - ie/ - y variants, and - ll/l variants. An examination and tabulation of all variants in these classes shows that throughout this text there is a marked preference for one form of the variant over the other. In the cases where the final ' e ' could be retained or dropped, the preference was to drop it; this was observed in 296 out of 441 cases, a 65% preference for the shorter form. With - ie/ - y the preference again is for the shorter form. Final '- y ' was used 115 times and final '- ie ' 52: a 69% preference for the '- y ' variant. With - ll/l on the other hand, the longer form is preferred with even higher consistency. Single '- l ' is used 115 times and the double form 340. The percentage preference is 74%. There is a slight pattern exhibited by some of the variant classes, but none is very pronounced. With the final ' e ' variant there is a slight tendency for the longer form to be more prevalent in prose than in verse passages. A faint pattern emerges with the - ll/l variant. Occasionally in verse passages there is a tendency for the '- ll ' form to drop slightly. The - ie/ - y variants show no pattern. The spelling analysis of this text does not show a pattern of two or more compositors, but rather shows that in the three classes of variant a preferential pattern pervades the entire text, supporting the hypothesis that one man set the entire play. On similar evidence the first quarto of Much Ado about Nothing can be assigned to one compositor. As the points observed coincide exactly with those observed in 2 Henry IV , it is almost certain that the same compositor set both plays. Again unabbreviated speech-headings give the strongest evidence. Unabbreviated headings appear on all but four pages of text; there are 489 of them, and only two have stops after them. The speech-prefixes occur as follows: A2 v 3 v 4 v B1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v C1 v Abbreviated: 9 13 13 13 10 9 7 2 7 6 3 4 20 6 3 Full, unstopped: 2 5 2 6 9 7 6 6 6 12 10 14 4 9 11 Full, stopped: 2 v 3 v 4 v D1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v E1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v 1 9 3 6 4 6 9 10 6 1 1 10 11 11 3 1 11 14 6 15 8 10 6 3 6 5 7 17 9 1 7 6 10 6 9 8 13 13 6 1 1 F1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v G1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v H1 v 2 v 3 v 8 11 13 11 6 2 5 1 5 1 1 13 23 9 8 1 16 7 4 10 5 3 7 13 13 12 12 3 5 2 1 9 13 12 4 14 13 6 4 11 1 4 v I1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v 8 2 14 11 14 2 13 13 15 5 6 4 3 1 8 5 4 2 This alone is conclusive evidence that the single compositor of 2 Henry IV set this play as well; all other evidence is corroborative. Again there is no unnecessary mixing of roman and italic type in the text of Much Ado . Only when a Latin tag is used on F2 is italic type introduced into the roman text. Similarly there is no roman type used in the stage-directions. The same even appearance of the type-page due to sparing use of emphasis capitals and parentheses is seen here as in 2 Henry IV . The regular treatment of the stage-directions (again excluding exits) is more pronounced in Much Ado than in 2 Henry IV . There are 43 stage-directions, 38 of which are centred and begin with capital letters. Of the five directions which are set flush right, four begin with capitals and one with lower case. There are 24 regular exits in the quarto and their treatment is the same as in 2 Henry IV . Twenty-two of these begin with a lower case ' e '. Eight exits are at the end of a line, while 16 are slightly indented. Full stops are usual, appearing after all but five. In four additional cases the exit is treated as a regular stage-direction, centred and capitalized. This possibly reflects some influence from the copy. Catchwords again are brief. Only one word is used as a catchword; the first word of a speech is never added when a speech-prefix forms the catchword. Again, as in 2 Henry IV , there are cases where long catchwords have been shortened: "mortifying" is cut to "mor-" and "Conuerting" to "Con-". A complete spelling analysis again corroborates the evidence pointing to single-compositor setting. Variants throughout the text, variants in verse passages, and variants involving little or no change in the length of the word all appeared at random. An examination of the three classes of variants — final ' e ', - ie/ - y , and - ll/l — shows again a strong preference for one form of the variant over the other. In 73% of the variant cases the final ' e ' was dropped, in 75% the longer '- ll ' was preferred to '- l ' and in 77% of the variant forms '- y ' endings were preferred to '- ie '. The second quarto of The First Part of the Contention was printed by Simmes in 1600 from a copy of Q1, which had been printed by Creede in 1594. Since most of Q2 exhibits the same typographical features as 2 Henry IV and Much Ado , we may infer that most of it was set by the same compositor, but that formes A outer, A inner, and B outer were set by an alternate workman. Again the speech-prefixes provide the strongest argument for identifying the compositor. On B inner and from sig. C to the end of the text there are 338 unabbreviated speech-prefixes, of which 276 are unstopped and 62 stopped. On three pages of the text there is no evidence as no unabbreviated prefixes appear. The distribution of prefixes is as follows: A2 v 3 v 4 v B1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v C1 v Abbreviated: -- 2 2 6 3 2 4 1 5 1 6 9 2 2 6 10 Full, unstopped: -- 1 3 6 1 5 4 1 4 5 Full, stopped: -- 8 2 2 2 4 2 3 3 7 1 2 4 4 1 2 v 3 v 4 v D1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v E1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v 15 7 8 4 1 3 2 6 8 3 4 1 5 5 4 5 4 4 8 6 3 1 7 25 6 5 2 2 5 8 3 3 6 5 3 3 8 8 2 6 3 2 2 3 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 F1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v G1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v H1 v 2 v 3 v 4 3 5 11 12 1 3 4 1 1 3 5 3 4 1 7 7 4 4 3 5 5 1 9 16 8 7 7 7 7 10 4 2 6 5 6 8 9 3 3 1 1 7 4 5 2 2 2 5 1 5 2 1 It should be pointed out that in this text the compositors were working from printed copy, and were sometimes influenced by it. The speech-prefixes in Q1 were all stopped, except for three tags on C3. Signature A and the outer forme of sig. B are distinguished by stopped prefixes. In sig. A there are 15 unabbreviated prefixes, 14 of them stopped. In outer B, 18 of the 20 unabbreviated prefixes have periods; by contrast inner B has 26 unabbreviated prefixes and the pattern is reversed, only 8 being stopped and the remaining 18 unstopped. Other evidence indicates a change of compositors between B inner and outer. In 2 Henry IV and Much Ado the exits are usually begun with a lower-case ' e '. In sig. A and outer B of The Contention there are eleven exits, seven of which begin with a capital ' E '. In inner B and from sig. C to the end of the text there are 54 exits, and all but one begin with a lower-case ' e '. The single exception can be dismissed as it is the beginning of a lengthy stage-direction. Both 2 Henry IV and Much Ado are characterized by the use of a single fount of type in the body of the text, without any use of a contrasting fount for names or titles. This practice is followed consistently in inner B and succeeding sheets, and is a deliberate departure from the copy-text where names are regularly set off in a contrasting typeface. In sheet A and outer B italic type is introduced into the roman in setting 25 names. Throughout this text the treatment of the stage directions and catchwords follows the patterns seen in 2 Henry IV and Much Ado . Most stage-directions are centred and begin with capitals; both compositors occasionally follow their copy and set stage directions in roman. Catchwords are brief, and again there are cases where a single word has been cut: "Prefageth" to "Prefa-", "Warwicke" to "War-", and "Immortall" to "Immor-". Enough evidence has now been adduced to support the inference that two compositors were at work in Simmes's shop. The workman in 1600 who set all of 2 Henry IV, Much Ado , and most of The Contention and whom we have distinguished through his unusual habit of leaving unabbreviated speech-prefixes unstopped, may be referred to as Compositor A. The workman who set sig. A and outer B of The Contention may be referred to as Compositor B. Although only three formes of his work, involving ten pages of text, have been examined, his work can be distinguished from that of Compositor A by his tendency to capitalize his exits. Q2 of The Contention offers an opportunity of examining the work of the Simmes compositors more closely, as it was set from a copy of the first quarto of 1594, with which it can be collated. A collation reveals several tendencies shared by the two compositors. Both, for example, failed to reproduce emphasis capitals in their copy. This is a practice expected of them after the even, unbroken type-pages of 2 Henry IV and Much Ado . In Q1 of The Contention there are many words, such as Lord, Lady, Prince, and Crown, which are regularly capitalized. Just as regularly both compositors of Q2 replaced these emphasis capitals with lower-case, changing 278 in the course of the play. There are 31 cases in which capitals have been added, but these were mostly where punctuation changes demanded it. Throughout the text punctuation marks were changed seemingly at the compositors' discretion. The following table records all changes in punctuation, indicating whether the changes were toward heavier or lighter punctuation, or in the case of changes in full stops, retained the same value. The first number indicates changes in A's stint; a second number denotes B's. HEAVIER no stop to comma 109-20 no stop to colon 1 no stop to full stop 4 comma to colon 13-2 comma to full stop 17-1 colon to full stop 1 — 178 LIGHTER full stop to colon 52 full stop to comma 42-4 full stop to no stop 4 colon to comma 5-2 comma to no stop 39-8 — 156 FULL-STOP VARIANTS period to question mark 16-8 period to exclamation mark 6-1 question mark to period 1 — 32 There is a tendency here toward heavier punctuation, but it is cancelled out in large measure by the removal of stops or their reduction. The most obvious increase is that while 51 stops have been removed entirely, 144 have been introduced into the text, a net increase of 93. The colon and comma are the preferred stops, with a net increase of 60 colons and 112 commas. Q1 had been lax in its use of question marks, but Q2 supplied them regularly. These observations help one give a qualified yes to Alice Walker's query, "Did Simmes normally pepper his texts with the heavy metrical pointing exemplified in the verse of 2 Henry IV and Much Ado ?" 3 It is also important to an editor of a Simmes quarto to know that these compositors did take such a free hand with punctuation, especially with the less common colon. Changes involving final ' e ', - ie/-y , and - ll/l variations were made by both compositors. In 152 cases the compositors dropped the final ' e ' of their copy, and 57 times they added it. The - ie/-y changes were more marked, for 71 times the - ie ending of the copy was changed to - y : only once was the opposite change made. Both practices are to be expected from the compositor who set 2 Henry IV and Much Ado . But the tendency in treating - ll/-l variants runs counter to the practice of the other texts. The shorter form is preferred to the longer, with 78 - ll forms being shortened and only 26 - l forms being lengthened to - ll . All three tendencies were noted proportionally in the work set by each compositor, thus reducing the value of ending-preferences in determining compositors. Although admittedly slim evidence, it is observed that Compositor B was responsible for slightly more than his share of added final ' e ' forms, and was responsible for the single - ie to - y change. Several spelling changes were made by the compositors, most of them modernizations. The most important are tabulated below. The number of times the change was made appears beside each variant. Where only one number is given, it denotes the number of occurrences in Compositor A's stint; where two numbers, the first represents A and the second B: eye(s) to eie(s) 8-3 bene to bin 7 bene to beene 8-3 proud(e) to prowd 12-7 blood to bloud 14 cleare to cleere 4-1 unkle to unckle 5 honour to honor 7 soldiers to souldiers 5 troopes to troup(e)s 4 Distinguishing the two compositors is rendered more difficult because they had similar spelling habits, and both treated emphasis capitals, full stage-directions, and catchwords in the same ways. These similarities throw greater importance upon the treatment of speech-prefixes and exits as means of distinguishing them, and the evidence these afford must be backed up by any other idiosyncracies which occur in a particular text. A fourth dramatic text set in Simmes's workshop in 1600 was the first quarto of The Shoemakers' Holiday . It was set by two compositors. One of the compositors was A; there is only slight evidence that the other compositor was B. On the basis of the treatment of speech-prefixes, the following passages can be assigned to Compositor A: four speeches on B4, all of C1 and C1v, the bottom of G1v and the remainder of the inner forme of sheet G, and from sig. H to the end of the play. The remainder of the play was set by another compositor, with the possible exception of sheet A which cannot be assigned for lack of evidence. Professor Bowers in his compositorial analysis of this play has noticed the spelling and speech-prefix evidence and used it in helping to assign some of the pages to an alternate compositor. He writes: . . . the compositor of B1-3v carefully placed full stops after each speech-heading, but suddenly in the middle of B4 four such headings in a row are not punctuated. The stops return on B4v but they are totally absent in all speech-prefixes on C1 and C1v; thereafter, the tags are consistently punctuated until towards the foot of G1v again no stops are found, and this lack of punctuation continues on G2, skips to G3v, and is found sporadically on G4. Full stops are consistent on G4v, but sporadic from H1 to the end of the play. On B4, in the section wanting stops, for the first time a character's name is set in roman instead of black letter, and on C1 and C1v all names are in roman but thereafter in black letter until roman appears again on G2, H3v, and I4 inconsistently, but consistently on K3. The fact that on G2 occurs the spelling Rafe (5 times), and Sibil (8 times), but on G2v Raph (5 times) and Sibil (5 times; Sibil once) seems to confirm a change of compositors at this point, in spite of the fact that the variant spellings of these names are of little assistance elsewhere. 4 The four speeches in the middle of B4 are characterized by the absence of stops after the prefixes, and by some spelling changes which are in addition to those noted by Bowers. The usual ' Lord ' is twice dropped to ' lord ', the spelling ' Mayor ' is introduced in place of the usual ' Maior ', and ' Lacie ' becomes ' Lacy .' Bowers also correctly identifies C1 and C1v as the work of this compositor. On these pages there are ten speech-prefixes — all unabbreviated and unstopped. There is a continuation of the practice of setting names in roman, with 7 examples on C1 and 4 on C1v. 'Lacie' becomes 'Lacy' the four times it appears, ' Lord ' is reduced to ' lord ' once, and once ' Maior ' becomes ' Mayor .' The usage is not consistent as both ' Lord ' and ' Maior ' appear as well. Compositor A began again at the foot of G1v. Bowers follows him to the end of G2, but the evidence of the unstopped prefixes takes up again on G3v and G4, thus completing the inner forme. The last five speeches on G1v have unabbreviated unstopped speech-prefixes, but no further evidence. On G2, in addition to all of the 17 unabbreviated prefixes being unstopped, there is one name set in roman and the spelling ' Mayor ' is used both times the word appears. Bowers points out the importance here of the Raph/Rafe spellings which seem to confirm a compositor change at G2/G2v. By the same evidence Compositor A took up again on G3v, for on G3 the spelling ' Raph ' appears six times and on G3v ' Rafe ' appears five, thus providing the pattern: G2 G2v G3 G3v Raph 5 6 Rafe 5 5 The three sheets, H, I, and K can be assigned to Compositor A on the evidence of speech-prefix treatment. There are 189 unabbreviated speech-prefixes on these pages, and 177 are unstopped, with only 12 stopped prefixes appearing sporadically. The pattern of speechprefixes for the entire text is as follows: B1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v C1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v Abbreviated: 1 2 3 Full, unstopped: 1 4 5 6 Full, stopped: 3 2 5 5 11 10 8 6 3 9 11 15 9 7 D1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v E1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v F1 v 2 v 3 v 12 6 1 1 4 5 2 8 2 1 1 4 1 1 2 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 14 13 10 10 12 9 7 3 6 11 4 10 12 10 11 7 9 9 4 13 7 9 4 v G1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v H1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v I1 v 2 v 7 5 8 1 3 4 1 2 5 3 7 7 6 8 4 4 9 10 5 17 1 1 9 3 2 7 6 3 5 6 6 6 14 6 6 8 7 5 8 11 8 5 3 6 3 1 1 2 1 1 1 3 v 4 v K1 v 2 v 3 v 4 v 5 2 5 6 2 1 7 7 11 10 7 7 10 14 6 9 12 1 1 1 The absence of abbreviated speech-prefixes in large sections of the play is due, of course, to the short names of Eyre and his apprentices, which are rarely abbreviated. Spelling evidence in determining the compositors of this play is weak, as might be expected from the results in The Contention . A few preferences do stand out, however. Compositor A always uses the spelling ' Rafe ' and it appears 41 times in his stint. The other compositor is not consistent in his usage, setting ' Rafe ' 21 times and ' Raph ' 20. Compositor A occasionally lapses into setting names in roman within a black letter text, doing so 26 times; the other compositor did this only once on B4v. Compositor A uses the spelling ' Mayor ' nine times, although he preferred ' Maior ': the other compositor spelled ' Maior ' consistently. There are marked preferences between the two compositors in their usage of - ie/-y and - ll/l . Compositor A preferred the - y form, employing it in 104 of 172 cases, a 60% usage. The other compositor preferred the - ie form, using it 126 times out of 214, a 41% usage of the - y form, markedly different from that of A. The two men were not as far apart in their use of - ll/l ; both preferred the longer form, Compositor A using it 64% of the time, the other compositor 52%. In the short passage of The Contention which had been set by Compositor B we noticed only one characteristic which might help in identifying him elsewhere. He capitalized seven of the eleven exits in his stint of The Contention . In Shoemaker there are 44 exits. The twelve which fall in Compositor A's stint are, with the exception of the final exit, begun with the customary lower-case ' e .' Of there 32 exits in the remainder of the text 13 are capitalized. This practice suggests slim evidence upon which it might be assigned to Compositor B.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Playhouse Interpolations in the Folio Text of Hamlet by Harold Jenkins *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the numerous variants between the Second Quarto and the Folio texts of Hamlet is a large group consisting of words and phrases which occur in the Folio (F) but are absent from the Quarto (Q2 or Q). I do not here refer to five extended passages totalling some eighty lines, 1 but to textual matter ranging from single words to passages no more than a line in length. Q is reasonably held to have been printed from Shakespeare's own foul papers, and Professor Dover Wilson, who demonstrated this, explained its lack of numerous words and phrases by a hypothesis of a bungling and inexperienced compositor with a habit of careless omission. 2 Now that it is known, however, that Q was in fact set by two compositors 3 and that the instances are equally divided between their shares, it is clear that this explanation will not do. It is still true that many missing words and phrases have to be explained as compositors' lapses either because their absence leaves Q deficient in sense or metre or because — like the King's 'lawful espials' (III.i.32) or Hamlet's sudden 'and more strange' return (IV.vii.47) — they are so unlike accretions due to a scribe or player that they can only be accounted for as part of Shakespeare's original composition. But in many cases the question naturally arises whether a word or phrase was in fact omitted by the Q compositors or whether perhaps it never stood in Shakespeare's manuscript at all. Through his discovery that Q was the work of two compositors Mr. John Russell Brown was led to the suggestion that many instances of apparent omission in Q might instead be additions in F having 'no stronger authority than that of a scribe or the players' prompt-book'. The likelihood of this is of course greatest with all those words and phrases which add nothing material to the context in which they appear. I give below, without any claim of completeness for the list, 4 sixty-five examples which incur suspicion. I. ii. 132 O 135 fie 185 Oh 224 indeed 237 very like iii. 120 Daughter iv. 45 oh v. 29 hast 104 yes 107 my Tables 122 my Lord 132 Looke you II. i. 53 At friend, or so, and Gentleman. 55 with you ii. 85 very 174 excellent 190 farre gone 219 Sir 287 Why 323 no 527 Inobled Queene is good. 610 Oh Vengeance! 611 I sure III. i. 76 these 92 well, well 142 Go 146 O 147 too ii. 41 Sir 107 And 191 Wormwood 263 Pox 288 two 289 sir 315 rather 319 farre iv. 5 with him 6 Ham. within.

That some of these words and phrases in F are additions to the dialogue by the actors who spoke it on the stage is not a novel hypothesis. It was conveniently resorted to by eighteenth-century editors to explain phrases they disliked; and it was arrived at after careful examination of the texts by Mommsen in the nineteenth century and again by Van Dam in the twentieth. 5 But it cannot be said that the labours of these scholars bore much editorial fruit. It is true that most nineteenth-century editors recognised some interpolations in practice if without comprehending them in theory, but what they omitted usually amounted to no more than a few exclamations which were seen to disrupt the metre. Thus of the 65 words and phrases I have listed as suspicious the Cambridge and the Globe editions omitted 15 and 16 respectively; and of the 14 they omitted in common Dowden, one of the few editors to acknowledge explicitly that F contained 'some actors' additions', nevertheless restored two. Of course the extent of the intrusive matter could not possibly be assessed so long as F was regarded as the more reliable of the two texts. What is surprising is that after its deposition by Dover Wilson a quarter of a century ago, editors of Hamlet have continued to give a place to most of the 65 F readings under discussion. Those editions which have not done so are either freaks like Van Dam's, which, while omitting 56 of them, also omitted and rearranged much besides, or else, like Dover Wilson's Cranach edition (with 37 omissions) and the edition of Parrott and Craig (with 46) were so committed to following Q wherever possible as to seem, if the phrase may be allowed, editions à thèse . Moreover, this last group of editors recanted later. For Parrott in his Twenty-three Plays and the Sonnets (revised 1953) restored 12 of the most conspicuous items, including 'O Vengeance', 'Mother, mother, mother,' and 'this skull', and Craig, in his edition of the Complete Works (1951), reverted to the Globe text. As for Dover Wilson himself, after confronting the problem with characteristic boldness and recognising that many of F's extra words and phrases were 'of the actor variety' ( MSH , pp.77 ff., 256), he finally decided that most of them were sufficiently Shakespearean for it to be 'safer to include them' (p.245). One cannot help suspecting that they seemed Shakespearean partly because they had been made familiar by that very preference for F which Dover Wilson was attacking. Ironically, F, even while he was deposing it, contributed to his view of the 'skipping compositor' from whom he held Q to have suffered. He concluded that 'the Q2 compositor is indeed so prone to omission that we are justified in accepting all extra words and phrases in F1 which are not clearly unnecessary or incorrect' (pp.178-9). In this vexed matter of the interpolations, if in no other, his work has left us very much where we started. Of the 65 suspected readings his New Cambridge edition (1934) relinquished only two more than the old Globe. The principal Shakespearean editors since, Kittredge, Alexander and Sisson, concur in rejecting another of them, Alexander and Sisson together reject another, and Sisson alone rejects four more. 15a The present position is, then, that of the words and phrases which are open to suspicion as unauthorized F additions at least two-thirds still remain in the standard modern texts. The time seems ripe for a further appraisal of this matter. One may begin with the two examples of what Dover Wilson called 'within-speeches'. When the Queen is waiting with Polonius in her closet for Hamlet to come to her she says, 'With-drawe, I heare him comming' (III.iv.7), and this is preceded in F but not in Q by the line ' Ham.within . Mother, mother, mother'. Something similar happens two scenes later when Hamlet has just managed to stow away Polonius's body before he hears the courtiers coming after him: 'What noyse, who calls on Hamlet ? O heere they come'. In F but not in Q we find ' Gentlemen within. Hamlet , Lord Hamlet .' (IV.ii.2). Twice, then, when a character speaks of hearing someone coming, F provides, though Q does not, for the audience to hear it too. Dover Wilson saw the correspondence between these passages and the possibility that both were added by a scribe. Yet he concluded that 'because they are just the sort of thing our compositor might omit, and because their inclusion does clarify the situation, we are justified in adopting them' ( MSH , p.246). Yet surely it would be too great a coincidence that Q should each time (and with a different compositor involved) omit the off-stage shouting accidentally. I infer that Q omits it because it was not in Shakespeare's manuscript and that the actors put it in. Indeed this is the sort of literalism in production from which we sometimes suffer in the modern theatre, as though we are not capable of imagining that the characters in their world of the play may see or hear things that are not made visible or audible to us. Such things are at best superfluous and at worst merely crude. What sort of prince is this who cannot come to his mother's chamber without announcing his arrival by calling 'Mother' three times in the corridor? It is a small thing, but it degrades the play for a moment, and, like Dyce, 'I certainly am not disposed to find fault with those editors who have omitted this speech.' The second instance is dramatically less objectionable; but textually the position is the same. It does not seem very logical for Parrott and Craig to reject the first as 'an actor's interpolation' while retaining the second as perhaps 'carelessly omitted by the Q printer'. This is not the only case where additions in F afford mutual condemnation. When Hamlet kills Polonius, the Queen cries in Q 'Helpe how', but in F 'Helpe, helpe, hoa'; and her cry is echoed by the victim, in Q with 'What how helpe', in F with 'What hoa, helpe, helpe, helpe' (III.iv.22). Dover Wilson thought these extra cries 'assist both the run of the verse and the excitement of the situation' ( MSH , p. 254) and listed them as probable Q omissions; but granted that to omit the repetition of a word is an easy error for a printer to make, is it not asking too much to suppose that a printer in mere carelessness omitted the word help three times in two lines? It is not Q that has omitted but (as Parrott and Craig saw) F that has elaborated. Coincidence seems equally incredible with the extra 'and' that F inserts in the speeches of the Clowns in the graveyard. It occurs in F but not in Q twice in the first dozen lines of the scene (V.i.) and again at line 135: 'I tell thee she is, and therefore make her Graue straight'; 'an (Q to) Act to doe and to performe'; 'I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine'. Dover Wilson put these three examples into three different categories: omission was regarded as only doubtful in the first case, but certain in the second and probable in the third. Yet they appear to be a single phenomenon and attributable to the same cause. They must be additions in F, as Parrott and Craig, Alexander and Sisson recognised by dropping the and consistently. Dramatically these are small matters, but textually they are indicative. Now that we begin to see what lies behind some few of the extra words in F, others perhaps fall into place. Twice when the dialogue refers to a sound being heard F supplies it 'within'; and the same principle operating the other way round is detectable when a stage-direction for 'a noise within' provokes in F a piece of dialogue. This stage-direction at IV.v.96 denotes the arrival of Laertes with his rabble. Q itself draws attention to the noise by the King's next word, 'Attend', but this is not enough for F, which substitutes a more obvious exclamation from the Queen: 'Alacke, what noyse is this?' This seems a palpable playhouse addition but editors have always taken it for an omission from Q and conflated the two texts. Laertes' return to the Danish court is heralded by a noise off-stage. Hamlet's is heralded by the arrival of a messenger with letters. But in the same way, lest the messenger's appearance should make insufficient éclat, F but not Q has the King inquire, 'How now? What Newes?' and the messenger reply, 'Letters my Lord from Hamlet ' (IV. vii.36). In Q the King is not told the letters come from Hamlet; he is left to find this out as he reads, and his cry 'From Hamlet ' betokens his astonishment on doing so. I think Hamlet would not have approved of the F messenger who robs his bomb of the full force of its explosion. Shakespeare's messenger did not even know he carried such a bomb, for the letters had reached him via sailors who were ignorant of their sender. They took him for 'th'Embassador that was bound for England ' (IV.vi.10). F, with its too knowledgeable messenger, by seeking to enhance the effect, destroys it. When extra dialogue in F embellishes the stage-business, then, it does so in a crude and obvious way. Another unfortunate example occurs when F makes Hamlet say 'Let me see' (V.i.202) as though to take the skull from the grave-digger. This looks innocuous enough, but is found on examination not quite to fit its context. For the skull should have changed hands two lines before. The grave-digger has ceased to call it 'this' and, in response to Hamlet's 'This?', has already referred to it as 'that'. F again, though its addition is accepted by all modern editors save Van Dam and Parrott and Craig, is manifestly wrong. Similarly condemned by its context, I believe, is the famous cry, 'Oh Vengeance', which F but not Q inserts extra-metrically in the middle of one of Hamlet's soliloquies (II.ii.610). To be sure it works him up to a fine theatrical outburst but at some risk of incongruity. For, though passionate, his speech is not incoherent. He has just mocked himself as a coward (l.598) and 'pidgion liuerd' (l.605) and he will go on in the same vein to sneer at his conduct as 'most braue' (l.611). He has just called the King a 'bloody, baudy villaine', with four more epithets to boot, and he will now complain that this is merely to 'fall a cursing' (l.615). So he abandons his self-reproaches and plans action. But the point at which the shift occurs is clearly marked a few lines later: 'fie vppont, foh. About my braines' (l.617). The crisis of his passion comes in this cry of self-disgust, not vengeance, and it is here, not earlier, that his thoughts, till now directed inwards, turn 'about' to confront his task in the world outside himself. F, by introducing his call for vengeance while he is still absorbed in self-reproaches, both anticipates and misconstrues this crisis. This subtle perversion of the pattern we may derive from the rest of the speech gives plausibility to the notion of Parrott and Craig that 'Oh Vengeance' might have been added by an actor in reminiscence of the notorious 'Hamlet, revenge' of the old play. Another of F's extra phrases which seem to disturb the dramatic effect comes when Hamlet has received the Ghost's command and, sending his companions about their business, adds 'for my owne poore part I will goe pray' (I.v.131-132). This is crucial to the understanding of the tragedy. Hamlet separates himself from his fellows because henceforth their way is not his. They have the common business of men to attend to while he is enjoined to a holy task. If this in one aspect is to kill his father's murderer, in another it is to restore order to a time that is 'out of ioynt', to free the world from the satyr and redeliver it to Hyperion. So in the midst of what seem to Horatio 'wilde and whurling words' the will to pray has a solemnity which a theatrical colloquialism in F does not enhance: 'for mine owne poore part, Looke you, Ile goe pray'. All the words that F adds do not of course cheapen the action. Often indeed they do no more than reduplicate what is already present in Q. But when they do no more than this they may still spoil the verse. When Hamlet swears that the Ghost's command shall live in his brain 'Vnmixt with baser matter, yes by heauen' (I.v.104), F interjects a second 'yes'. Three lines below Hamlet exclaims 'My tables, meet it is I set it downe' and the F repetition, 'My Tables, my Tables', deepens the impression of uncontrollable emotion only at some metrical expense. Similarly with the extra 'fie' at I.ii.135 and the repeated 'hast' at I.v.29. These are instances in which the metrical clue has regularly led editors to reject the repetition. But it does not seem consistent to regard repetitions in verse lines as F interpolations and those in prose as Q omissions. It is true that Hamlet is not normally made to say he knows Polonius 'excellent, excellent well' (II.ii.174) with the repeated adverb of F—Dover Wilson lists this among 'Burbadge's additions to his part'. But other instances he defends. When Ophelia asks Hamlet how he does, he answers in Q 'I humbly thanke you well' (III.i.92), which F expands into 'I humbly thanke you:well, well, well'. In this repetition Granville-Barker heard 'princely irony', Dover Wilson boredom, and Dowden impatience. 6 Where they seem to agree is in accepting some nuance beyond what is present in Q. But if we regard Q as the more authoritative text, should we not regard the F reading here as an unwarrantable exaggeration? So too, when Osric leaves Hamlet saying, 'I commend my duty to your Lordshippe' and Hamlet mocks him, 'Yours', one may see F exaggerating by repeating, 'Yours, yours' (V.ii.190). Yet almost all editors, including Parrott and Craig, have accepted these repetitions as authentic. In another instance, when the Player Queen says something that strikes at the Queen who is watching the performance, Q makes Hamlet interject 'That's wormwood' and F shows an access of venom with 'Wormwood, Wormwood' (III.ii.191). Here Dover Wilson supposes both texts 'guilty of omission' ( MSH , p.302) and, followed by Alexander and Sisson, to my mind unjustifiably conflates. Whereas editors tend to reject those repetitions in F which break the regularity of the verse, they tend correspondingly to accept those which they can employ to preserve it. Examples occur in the dialogue after Hamlet has first heard about his father's ghost. Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me. (I.ii.224) Very like, very like: staid it long? (I.ii.237) The editorial regard for the pentameter will be dangerous if it confers status on inane repetitions like these. But Dover Wilson justifies them —along with the repetition in I humbly thanke you:well, well, well —as 'essential to the metre' ( MSH . p.82). Two of these three lines, however, even in F are not regular blank verse. 7 In the early scenes especially, there are many speeches of less than a line in length which have taxed the ingenuity of editors to arrange them so as to look like pentameters, which in the result they rarely do exactly. The truth, I think, is that in these scenes extended blank-verse speeches are interspersed with staccato dialogue for which no regular scansion should be sought. McKerrow has a clear-sighted discussion of the 'short lines which often occur in rapid interchange of speech' and concludes that 'little regard, even in what is clearly verse, seems to have been paid to the formation of complete lines'. 8 So there is no need to regard these repetitions as other than interpolations like the rest. The reiteration of little phrases like those discussed above has sometimes been thought to be a trick of speech that Shakespeare gave to Hamlet. Bradley in particular made a point of this, 9 but of four examples that struck him as 'intensely characteristic' two are in F only. It has to be conceded that there are some in Q. After hearing the Ghost's story Hamlet says, 'hold, hold my hart' (I.v.93) and then 'Rest, rest, perturbed spirit' (I.v.183). When he sees the Ghost in his mother's closet and she asks what he is gazing at, he replies, 'On him, on him' (III.iv.125). To Polonius's question, 'What doe you reade', he answers, 'Words, words, words' (II.ii.194), and when Polonius takes his leave, 'You cannot take from mee any thing that I will not more willingly part withall: except my life, except my life, except my life' (II.ii.221). But such repetitions are closely related to the moment and the mood and it is doubtful whether from Q alone one could reasonably infer that they are an idiosyncrasy of Hamlet's speech. Is it not the accumulated repetitions of F that have given this impression? At least one must beware of accepting the F instances as authentic, as Parrott and Craig do several times, because they are 'characteristic'. Dover Wilson, as one would expect of him, perceived the difficulty; he decided that some of them are due to Burbage. But as he thought Burbage only exaggerated what was already a feature of his role, 10 he declined to attribute to him all that are not in Q. Whether Burbage was quite so thoroughly inside his part may be left an open question. But the phenomenon is not confined to Hamlet's role. F suggests that other actors too made the most of their lines. There is the grave-digger with the skull. It is only in F that he repeats 'Heres a Scull now:this Scul. . .' (V.i.190) and a few lines later 'This same Scull Sir, this same Scull sir' (V.i.198). One might think this a case where two additions are mutually damning. It does not seem consistent for the majority of editors to accept, and Dover Wilson to argue for, the first and then reject the second ( MSH , p.257). The part of Polonius has several examples. Shaking his head over Hamlet's strange behaviour, he says, 'A is farre gone', and F repeats 'farre gone' (II.ii.190). Joining Hamlet in savouring a phrase in the Player's speech, he pronounces, 'That's good' (II.ii.527), which F renders 'That's good: Inobled Queene is good' ('Inobled' for 'mobled'). Van Dam is, as far as I know, the only editor to have rejected the repetition here, but it is not fundamentally different from the others. An actor can duplicate something in his part less obviously than by a simple reiteration of what immediately precedes. F's extra-metrical vocative in 'For (Q from) this time Daughter' (I.iii.120), which almost all editors dispense with, must be an echo from 'these blazes daughter' three lines before; but the usual explanation that the eye of a scribe picked up the word a second time—what was there to confuse the eye?—is less likely than an actor echoing himself. An illuminating passage is that where the rambling Polonius loses his thread and Reynaldo has to prompt him. Q reads: By the masse I was about to say something, Where did I leaue? Rey . At closes in the consequence. Pol . At closes in the consequence, I marry, He closes thus. . . (II.i.50-55) The speaker is away again, but F, reading 'He closes with you thus', makes him more exactly repeat what he had said before ( cf. l.45). The extra words are again condemned by the metre, and though here a copyist might have been confused, again it is more probable that an actor was responsible. This may have been a deliberate expansion, for Reynaldo's prompt is amplified from the preceding dialogue in exactly the same way. F makes him give Polonius back his words more fully: Where did I leaue? Reynol . At closes in the consequence: At friend, or so, and Gentleman. But since what Polonius seizes on is the first part of the cue and not the second, the extra words in F make the dialogue run not more naturally but less. They have, that is to say, the stamp of theatrical interpolation and not of original composition. Editors since the eighteenth century have almost always kept them, but the Furness Variorum quotes a significant comment by Elze, 'For this unmistakable interpolation we are probably indebted to some actor who wished to repeat the laughable gestures which accompanied it'. A similar explanation is available when the grave-digger, breaking into song, sings in F two lines instead of one (V.i.130). The second line is supplied from the complete stanza which he has sung before, but its inclusion is not an improvement. After his offhand answer to Hamlet's question the grave-digger may effectively sing one line, but not two, before Hamlet cuts in with his retort. F's 'Hey non nony, nony, hey nony' in one of Ophelia's songs (IV.v.165) is comparable but less objectionable. It is unnecessary to consider in detail all the tiny words that are suspect in F. Ands and buts smooth out the dialogue and many little exclamations occur — 'why', 'la', and on several occasions 'O'. A few of these which fall outside the verse have been regularly discarded by the editors, and after Hamlet has ended his death-speech with 'The rest is silence', hardly any one since Rowe 11 has been willing to add the 'O,o,o,o' with which F represents his dying groans. But if we reject this as an actor's interpolation, should we not logically do the same elsewhere? It would be in the nature of an actor to heighten Hamlet's impatience with the player who acts the murderer, ' Pox , leaue thy damnable Faces, and begin' (III.ii.263), and to increase the emphasis in 'Man delights not me; no , nor Woman neither' (II.ii.323). Dover Wilson upholds F's 'Why' at II.ii.287 because it 'adds something to the effect of Hamlet's half-suppressed outburst of indignation' ( MSH , p. 254), and Sisson thinks it 'irresistible' 12 ; but if Hamlet's use of 'why' on other occasions gives it some plausibility, this might equally be a reason for an actor to put it in. A striking ejaculation which only F gives occurs when the Queen supposes that Hamlet's seeing his father's ghost is the result of 'extacie' (III.iv.139). In F Hamlet takes up the word in an extra-metrical cry, 'Extasie', before replying in a regular blank-verse speech. This is a theatrical touch which no editor but Van Dam seems to have relinquished; but there is too much of this sort of thing for an assumption of an omission in Q to be at all acceptable. Again it seems clear that what we are faced with is interpolation in F. There are inevitably some doubtful cases. The redundancy in the 'good' turn Hamlet was to do (IV.vi.22) and the 'two' Provincial roses he wanted for his shoes (III.ii.288) could easily have come from Shakespeare's pen and as easily been dropped in the printing of Q. But of the sixty-five examples listed, I believe all can, and most must, be explained as interpolations. It has sometimes been suggested that some of the variants in F — those which an editor may happen to prefer — may be revisions made by Shakespeare working over his play. 13 This is not an opinion which I share. But it is not in any case a hypothesis which could account for the kind of expansion in F which has been demonstrated here. For we cannot suppose that all these little repetitions, interjections, and similar small elaborations show the way in which Shakespeare would have gone about revision. They never add to the sense nor introduce any significant word which the surrounding context does not supply. Many of them will no doubt seem harmless: perhaps we need not grieve if some continue in performance. A producer will do small damage to the play if he permits the grave-digger to make an extra reference to the skull or Polonius to shriek for help three times instead of once. But their cumulative effect is to modify the dialogue in a direction which is not towards subtlety. If they sometimes make a moment more dramatic, at others they cheapen or corrupt it. We should not have a messenger who lets his cat out of its bag. Hamlet should not tear a legitimate passion to tatters by a melodramatic cry for vengeance nor be held up for a retort because the Clown insists on singing more than is set down for him. All these things, no less than the dying groans, should be recognised for the stage accretions that they are. As such they have no claim to be admitted into an edition of Hamlet which aims at fidelity to its author. It is true that by the time F was printed some of its additions had already a tradition behind them. For, as was observed by Dover Wilson and Parrott and Craig, many of them are present in the text of the Bad Quarto (Q1). But I do not understand why Parrott and Craig should have thought the concurrence of Q1 somehow authenticated F. It means of course no more than that the words and phrases added in F, or some of them, were already being spoken on the stage in 1603. The only difficulty that arises here is that in 1603 Shakespeare was still active in the theatrical company that performed his plays. Is it possible, even though we discount any suggestion of a literary revision, that F's additions to the dialogue were suggested by Shakespeare in rehearsal? Did he at least acquiesce in what the players did? An editor who thought so might have a pretty problem on his hands, though it would still be possible to hold that acquiescence is not equivalent to composition. But since, as I have tried to show, the tendency of the additions in F is to distort or weaken the effect of Q, a text printed as is now believed from Shakespeare's own manuscript, one cannot reasonably conclude that Shakespeare had any responsibility for them. And that being so, they should in my judgment be eliminated from future editions. So far I have proceeded by a comparison and analysis of the two main Hamlet texts, with reference to what editors have made of them. But the argument for spurious additions in F finds corroboration in other texts which are agreed to show contamination by the players. In this matter of interpolation the memorially reconstructed text Q1, far from authenticating the readings of F, serves to confirm the verdict against them. For besides including some of the words and phrases which F has and Q2 has not, it has other examples of precisely the same kind. In this observation, as in others, I am anticipated by Dover Wilson; to the four examples of reduplicated phrases which he cites ( MSH , p.81) I need only add the following: I.v.110 Q2 So Vncle, there you are Q1 So vncle, there you are, there you are. II.ii.452 Q2 come a passionate speech. Q1 a speech, a passionate speech. 543 Q2 prethee no more. Q1 no more good heart, no more. 545 Q2 Tis well Q1 T'is well, t'is very well III.i.157 Q2 to a Nunry go. Q1 to a Nunnery goe, To a Nunnery goe. Similarly, with the expletive 'Pox' which occurs in F in Hamlet's speech to the player-murderer we may compare from Q1, 'A pox, t'is scuruy, Ile no more of it' (III.i.153), and 'A pox, hee's for a Iigge, or a tale of bawdry' (II.ii.522). It is clear that the actors made additions to the dialogue on the stage, which sometimes got into F and sometimes did not. The Folio version of Hamlet has, therefore, some of the characteristics of a reported text. Nor need one stop at an examination of the Hamlet texts to show this. Other touchstones are available and a convenient one is provided by the quarto text of Richard III . That this is a memorial reconstruction by the actors has been generally acknowledged since the demonstration by D. L. Patrick, 14 whose classification of its features facilitates comparison. Particularly relevant is his list of 'exclamations and interjections added . . . by the actors', which often 'add extra syllables to regular blank-verse lines' (pp 91-92). He shows, too, that many tags for which the corresponding Folio text offers no equivalent can be explained only as actors' additions (pp.137-142). Among them are some phrasal repetitions and some intrusive 'sirs' resembling those in the F Hamlet : Richard III IV.iii.456 F My minde is chang'd: Q My mind is changd sir, my minde is changd. 467 F Well, as you guesse. Q Well sir, as you guesse, as you guesse. There is also an interesting example of the practice of supplying dialogue to emphasize or clarify what is already indicated by a stage-direction. In the scene (III.iii) where Ratcliff enters 'carrying the Nobles to death' the reported text, as though to make sure that the import of this shall not be missed, begins 'Come bring foorth the prisoners'. We may perhaps compare in Hamlet the F addition of 'Alacke, what noyse is this?' or the dialogue which accompanies the entry of the messenger with Hamlet's letters. A text derived from acting will be likely to vary from the authentic dialogue not only in what an actor adds but also in what he substitutes for his original. An article on interpolations can touch on substitutions only briefly. And in general they present in Hamlet a smaller obstacle: for with Q accepted as the more authoritative text, even editors who retain F's additions may be expected to discard its equal and inferior variants. Actors' substitutions, therefore, whether recognised as such or not, have a natural tendency to disappear from modern editions. Difficulty will arise when a reading in F which may very well be due to the actor is taken to be superior. A case occurs in Hamlet's outburst on the player's tears. For Hecuba . What's Hecuba to him, or he to her . . . (II.ii.585). Q is perfectly satisfactory, but F of course substitutes ' Hecuba ' for 'her', and the threefold repetition of the name is usually held powerful. So Dover Wilson, maintaining on the one hand that Q followed Shakespeare's manuscript and determined on the other to preserve F's three Hecubas intact, supposed that Shakespeare wrote the third one in the abbreviated form 'hec', which the printer misread as 'her' ( MSH , p. 107). This also implies that he wrote a line a foot too long, which the printer fortuitously made regular. The 'her', though Dover Wilson calls it 'curious', is surely less so than the explanation. Once the presence of stage corruptions in F is recognised, it is more natural to attribute the third ' Hecuba ' to an actor's rhetorical emphasis. Where F's substitutions are important is in illuminating for the editor the kind of text he is faced with. F tends to inaccuracy in prepositions: it gives ( Ioyntresse ) of for to (I.ii.9), ( flushing ) of for in (I.ii. 155), in for of ( the afternoone ) (I.v.60), at for in ( graue-making ) (V.i. 74), and several more. Similarly, the unaccented ending of a word may show a commonplace approximation: Eastward becomes Easterne (I.i. 167), nighted nightly (I.ii.68), grissl'd grisly (I.ii.240), knotted knotty (I.v.18), and so on. The conjunctions and and but are interchanged; pronouns are often substituted for one another, the definite article or a possessive for a demonstrative, singulars for plurals and vice versa . Tenses are altered; and there are many inversions of the will I for I will type. These are of course all features that could arise through scribes' and compositors' carelessness, but their prevalence suggests that something more may be involved and they correspond to what is found in the memorial text of Richard III . One of Patrick's categories concerns forms of address (pp.88-90). These can often be varied without loss and the evidence shows that actors' memories tended to hold them loosely. An example from Richard III defines the type — My gracious for Most mightie ( Soueraigne ) (IV.iv.433). The F Hamlet gives us among others my sweet Queene for my deere Gertrard (II.ii.54), my good Lord for mine owne Lord (IV.i.5), Dread my Lord for My dread Lord (I.ii.50), and in similar manner in good faith for good my Lord (V.ii.108). With these variants may be linked another common kind of memorial error, the replacement of a word by its synonym ( cf. Patrick, pp.84-88). The F Hamlet has ground for earth (I.v.162), Chamber for closset (II.i.77), buriall for funerall (IV.v.213), and so on. Sometimes the synonym is weaker, as in tunes for laudes (IV.vii. 178), or less apt to the context, as when all the court is said to waile instead of mourne for Hamlet's madness (II.ii.151). Such synonyms cannot be explained as misreading or mishearing; not eye nor ear but memory is at fault. And though this kind of error can be perpetrated by copyists who carry too much in their heads, a kindred category strongly suggests the actor. This is that in which a failure of memory has been made good by a word of different meaning ( cf. Patrick, pp. 96-104). In Hamlet F corrupts their Lords murther to their vilde Murthers (II.ii.483), his owne conceit to his whole conceit (II.ii.579), the proude mans contumely to the poore mans Contumely (III.i.71), this madde knaue to this rude knaue (V.i.109). In these and other cases a gap is hastily filled by a word which satisfies the rhythm but gives inferior or even defective sense. Though Dover Wilson and Sisson take madde to be a mere misreading of the manuscript, the almost universal preference among editors for the trite word rude I find incomprehensible. Substitution by anticipation is a well-known phenomenon in memorial texts ( cf. Patrick, pp.46-68), and is found in the F Hamlet in one of the examples just cited. In 'his whole conceit' the stop-gap word was evidently suggested by what was to come three lines later: ' his whole function suting With formes to his conceit '. Similarly, the Folio cock became 'Trumpet to the day' instead of 'the morne' (I.i.150) no doubt through a confusion with 'the God of day' that it was to awake two lines below. Such local confusions are not beyond a scribe. But a further agent has to be postulated when a word seems to have been suggested by a distant context. When in F Hamlet speaks of a satirical 'slaue' instead of 'rogue' (II.ii.198), this is perhaps because he has to say 'a rogue and pesant slaue' nearly 400 lines farther on (II.ii.576); and when Fortinbras 'claimes' instead of 'craues' a passage over the kingdom (IV.iv.3), this may be because he will 'clame' the kingdom at the end of the play (V.ii.401). These instances are discussed by Dover Wilson in a notable passage of textual analysis ( MSH , p.59), and if his explanation of a confusion of memory is accepted, the confusion must, as he observes, have arisen in a mind which had an 'active memory' of other parts of the play. But whereas Dover Wilson thought this 'active memory' belonged to a scribe who was familiar with the whole play, it now seems more likely that the source of the confusion lay in the memory of an actor and that the variants in F represent what was actually spoken on the stage. 15 In F, then, we may find parallels for many characteristics of texts which are recognized as deriving from actors. This confirms, what is of immediate concern, that many of the little words and phrases which F has in excess of Q are in fact actors' additions. It also goes to show, what of course we should expect, that the textual corruptions of the players are not confined to interpolations. One further point should be added. In showing signs of corruption through performance the F Hamlet is not unique, except possibly in degree, among substantially 'good' Shakespearean texts, and these may be mutually illuminating. Interpolations and other marks of the actor have recently been pointed to in the first quarto of Richard II , 16 and several scholars have remarked them in the quarto of Othello . Among Q additions in Othello the repetition in Othello's 'false to me, to me?' (III.iii.333) corresponds to the repetitions in the F Hamlet , and Desdemona's cry 'O Lord, Lord, Lord' when Othello stifles her is comparable to the fourfold 'O' when Hamlet dies. Granville-Barker noted the first of these examples as a possible 'actor's interpolation' and suspected there were others. 17 Alice Walker has particularly stigmatized that dialogue fragment, again in Q only, in which Desdemona asks 'To night my Lord?' and the Duke replies 'This night' (I.iii.279). Holding further that many variants are 'memorial perversions', she concludes that the Q Othello 'was a memorially contaminated text . . . based on the play as acted' and she duly notes its resemblance to the F Hamlet . 18 A complete history of the Folio text of Hamlet , which is not here attempted, 19 would have of course to explain how additions and deviations of the players came to be incorporated in it. But the difficulty of explaining how this happened should not prevent the recognition that it did.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Rationale of Old-Spelling Editions of the Plays of Shakespeare and his Contemporaries by John Russell Brown</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a time, in the days of Pope and Dodsley, when editors 'modernized' the spelling of Elizabethan and Jacobean printed plays without thinking twice about the matter, but in more recent years, especially after the first volume of McKerrow's critical edition of Nashe in 1904 and the first issues of the Malone Society's diplomatic reprints in 1907, editors have seemed to prefer the 'old spelling' of original first editions with just as little thought. 1 While the Malone Society has issued its reprints for over fifty years, its editorial policies have remained unchanged in all essentials; and its list of subscribers continues to grow. At the present moment scholars are engaged on large-scale, critical editions of the plays of Peele, Greene, Dekker, Heywood and Massinger, and all have chosen to prepare old-spelling editions. So far the only old-spelling editions of Shakespeare's complete works have been facsimiles or diplomatic reprints, but work is now in progress on an old-spelling, critical edition. The decision made by McKerrow and others in the early years of this century has become an orthodox decision, and few editors seem to question its validity; apart from the more or less popular editions of Shakespeare and some text-book anthologies, very few modern-spelling texts of Elizabethan or Jacobean plays are now being published. When a technical decision of this kind remains orthodox for more than fifty years it might be supposed that those years were a time of modest, conservative effort in the particular branch of studies involved. But this is far from the truth. Since McKerrow's first editorial work there have been great advances in textual studies; editors now know far more about Elizabethan printing practices and Elizabethan dramatic documents, and, on some aspects of their task, they now know that less is known than was once assumed. Advances in knowledge and technique have affected editorial principles in almost all aspects; the preference for 'old spelling' is exceptional in being unchanging and almost unchallenged. Yet if McKerrow's decision on this point is still valid, it must be valid for reasons which need to be re-stated in the light of new facts and new editorial principles; if his decision is now out-of-date or in need of modification, a new orthodoxy will be established only after much consultation and scholarly debate. After fifty busy, successful years there is good cause for reconsidering the rationale of the most basic and seemingly obvious practices; the choice of old or new spelling should be made in the light of today's knowledge and what can be guessed of tomorrow's requirements. The choice cannot be completely isolated from other choices, as whether or not to retain the original punctuation, capitals, type-variation and lay-out. Nor can the choice be made without considering the readers for whom a projected edition is intended. The problem may best be examined by reference to two distinct kinds of old-spelling editions, each exemplified by a particular example, and by confining the discussion to Elizabethan and Jacobean printed plays, omitting the special problems of manuscript originals.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Facsimile Reprint The simpler kind is the facsimile reprint, as represented by the Malone Reprints. The aim of the editors of these texts was summed up by A. W. Pollard at the inception of the society, and this aim has recently been endorsed by Professor F. P. Wilson, the present General Editor; it is to do work of permanent utility . . . . by placing in the hands of students at large such reproductions of the original textual authorities as may make constant and continuous reference to those originals themselves unnecessary. 2 Pollard was concerned with specifically 'textual' authorities, and, by producing 'type-facsimiles of the editions chosen for reproduction', without changing errors, irregularities and arrangement except within very clearly defined limits, the society produced texts which could answer almost all the demands which a textual student might make. The bibliographer, of course, would not be satisfied; he would wish to see the original print and paper, and to judge the original workmanship. Occasionally a textual critic was also a bibliographer—it was McKerrow, a founder-member of the Malone Society, who wrote the classic and indispensable Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students (1927)—but as 'textual authorities', back in 1907, the society's reprints satisfied, and 'constant and continuous reference' to the originals was no longer necessary. This kind of old-spelling edition must be judged today by the same yard-stick. Yet the answer will not be the same, for this particular measure has changed: the textual student now asks questions which, in 1907, concerned only the bibliographer, and he has won for himself the new and barbarous name of 'biblio-textual student'; increasingly he needs textual and bibliographical authorities. When he considers a crux he must consider not only the sense, spelling, punctuation and other details that can be reproduced in type-facsimile; he must also be on the look-out for the slightest irregularity in the original printing. So he may be able to argue that the type has been tampered with during some stage of proof-correction, and thereby discern the cause of an error and, perhaps, its most plausible correction. An example of this is found in The Honest Whore, Part 2 (1630) where the first edition reads: Hip . What was he whom he killed? Oh, his name's here; old Iacomo , sonne to the Florentine Iacomo , a dog, that to meet profit, would to the very eyelids wade in blood of his owne children. (A4) For this, Professor Bowers' edition of Dekker reads: Hip . What was he whom he killed? Oh, his name's here; Iacomo , sonne to the Florentine Old Iacomo , a dog, that to meet profit, Would to the very eyelids wade in blood Of his owne children. (I.i.123-127) Professor Bowers has noted that the transposition of Old at the start of two lines of verse best emends the original difficulty of having Matheo kill an old man who was son to a still living father of the same name. But since in the quarto the passage in question is set as prose, we must suppose that though the manuscript was correctly lined, the compositor mistook or ignored the fact in his typesetting. An examination of the original edition adds to our understanding of this passage: there, 'old Iacomo sonne to the Florentine Iacomo , a dog, that to' is set as one line of prose but with a few abnormally long spaces between words; it would seem that the compositor set 'old Iacomo' twice in error, and then a corrector, sensing a redundancy, removed the wrong 'old'. Now an editor of a Malone Society Reprint must always normalize the spacing of his text and may allow a 'space . . . after a point even if there is none in the original'; 3 so from such a reprint a student could not easily learn that there may be an omission from the line as originally set, and certainly he would not be in a position to say that the irregularity was of such dimensions as might be accounted for by the removal of the one word 'old'. Nor would he be able to compare the setting of this line with the setting of the book as a whole, to judge whether this is indeed a sign of type-correction or a trivial example of poor printing. An examination of press-variants among copies of an original edition can provide many examples of how irregularities, not only in spacing but also in the disposition of the type within a word, can sometimes betray the handiwork of a press-corrector; an editor, or a textual student, should be able to recognise such signs elsewhere and be prepared to use them in reconstructing the authority of any particular line, word or comma of his text. For such work an edition like the Malone Society Reprints is not an adequate 'textual authority'; either the original edition or a photographic reproduction of it is required. As more press-variants are discovered between different copies of the first and authoritative editions of Elizabethan and Jacobean plays, the textual student is tied more firmly to the necessity of consulting those originals. Even the examination of the variants which other students have discovered requires at least some form of photographic reproduction; sometimes the order of two states can only be determined by observing displaced or damaged type, or some irregularity in lay-out. An example of this is found in the outer forme of sheet H of John Webster's The White Devil (1612): here the differences between two states are very considerable, involving the addition or deletion of a whole line, an entry and an exit, and the substitution of one perfectly acceptable word for another; yet the argument for the order of printing, and hence for the authority of the two sets of readings, rests on the exact arrangement of type for H2 v and 3—the precise disposition of the lines of type on both pages, and an irregularity in the indentation of the first line of one of the speeches. 4 Both spacing and indentation are normalized in a Malone Society Reprint, 5 and so such an edition would be an insufficient authority for a student working on the variants of this text. For work on plays with press-variants, the most convenient, and generally available, textual authority would be a photographic reproduction of a composite copy made up of the preferred states of each variant forme; 6 this would be more convenient than a copy of the original edition—even if one could be found which contained all the chosen readings—because such a photograph could be taken for comparison, without risking the loss or damage of an irreplaceable object, to wherever a new original was found. A counsel of perfection would be to add, to such a composite, photographic copy, photographs of alternative states of each variant forme; many plays of the period—perhaps the majority of them—have press-variants on only a few formes, so the duplication would not often be very great. Another important advance in textual studies has been the development of techniques for distinguishing the type set by individual compositors in Elizabethan printing-shops. By undertaking spelling-tests, and by tracing the recurrences of identifiable pieces of type, Dr. Alice Walker, 7 Dr. Hinman 8 and other scholars have been able to evaluate more precisely than before the authority of a text set by any known compositor, and the varying authority of one set by two or more of them. This means that a student will now wish to apply any and every test for distinguishing the identity and number of compositors employed on the text he is studying. For applying spelling-tests, the Malone Society Reprints are barely satisfactory—their shortcoming in this respect is that, in prose-lines or full lines of verse, their normalized spacing makes it more difficult to judge whether words have been shortened as an aid to justification. But there are other tests for which such old-spelling editions are no use at all; such are the analysis of variations in indentation or in centering of stage-directions, details which are always normalized in the Malone Reprints. 9 A student will be very unwilling to be deprived of these tests, for they are among the easiest to apply. He will be unwilling, too, to be prevented from judging the 'look' of a whole page as set in the original, for sometimes one of two compositors will give a looser, sharper or more regular appearance to a page of print than his fellow, and such a distinction can be discerned by a trained eye in a moment and, sometimes, greatly facilitate the establishment of further, more accurate distinctions. For compositor identification and for a study of compositors' habits and practices, a textual student will wish to work with the original text, or with a good photographic reproduction of it. Progress has also been made in the bibliographical problem of reconstructing the press-work of early books, and, again, the textual student has learned these techniques. From a study of the press-work of a book, he can sometimes find help towards identifying the work of two or more compositors, discovering the method of proof-correction used, or adding to his understanding of the authority of a complex text; occasionally it can help him to argue that a text was set hurriedly or leisuredly, and this in turn can influence his assessment of the accuracy of its compositors and hence of the authority of the whole work. 10 These investigations depend almost wholly on evidence which is not, and could not be, reproduced in any facsimile reprint: identification of skeleton-formes, for instance, involves the precise size and position of headlines, or minute variations in the length or width of rules, or imperfections in types and ornaments; proof that a printer used two cases of type, as James Roberts did for Hamlet (1604/5), 11 may depend on minute variations in the forms of type such as only a photograph could reproduce. More recently, new knowledge has been gained about composing methods and it is now known that, both for folios and quartos, an early printer might cast-off his copy and set by formes, not by consecutive pages. 12 This is of considerable importance to students who wish to analyse compositors' habits and to make editorial judgements: inaccurate casting-off might cause a compositor to change his habitual spellings in order to lengthen or shorten a passage of prose at the foot of a page, or it might cause him to modify the lining of the verse as found in his copy. All textual students will wish to know precisely when and where they should expect such interference and here again a facsimile reprint is of no use to them. Such investigations involve a knowledge of press-work, the identification of odd pieces of type and the analysis of occasional intrusions of italic type, and for all this a student will require as his authority nothing less than a copy of the original edition or a photographic reproduction of it. 13 The influence of inaccurate casting-off on the lining of verse plays is one aspect of a problem which confronts most students working on Elizabethan and Jacobean plays. It is widely known that the availability of text-space influenced the line-arrangement and the exact position of stage-directions in early plays, but the extent of this kind of textual interference may be properly appreciated only by working continuously with original editions or photographic reproductions of them. The Malone Society has high standards in this respect, asking its editors to ensure that the line-endings of the verses fall approximately in the same relative positions in the reprint as in the original. It is not necessary to be meticulous in this respect, but the distinction between full lines and those not full should be strictly observed, and it is well to retain so far as possible the relative indentation of lines running to within say two ems of the end. The position of stage-directions should be preserved as exactly as possible. 14 But this degree of accuracy is insufficient to enable a student to cope with some of the particular problems of lining that may confront him. The closest possible reproduction of the original lay-out is especially necessary when he is dealing with a lengthy play, like John Webster's White Devil , in the setting of which two compositors attempted to save space on almost every page: in this play both compositors habitually misplaced directions and frequently ran two lines or one-and-a-half lines together in order to save space. 14a To gauge the extent of this sort of interference, a student has to work to closer limits than editions like the Malone Society Reprints can provide. If the facsimile reprint were the only alternative to a copy of an original edition, it would be good sense to try to improve the standards of reproduction of such reprints. But there is an alternative in the photostat or some other mode of photographic reproduction. Professor R. C. Bald suggested some years ago that with the development of cheap photographic processes the facsimile reprint will be less and less in demand, except on those occasions where it is desirable to furnish a literatim transcript of a manuscript, either to preserve the peculiarities of an individual writer or to aid those unskilled in palaeography . . . . 15 But it is not on the grounds of price alone that the type-facsimile is now less desirable than formerly. With every year textual students become more and more bibliographers as well, and for 'biblio-textual' authorities no reproductions short of photographic ones can serve; only by providing either photographs or else books printed from photographic plates such as collotype or fine-screen offset could the Malone Society continue to 'make constant and continuous reference to [the] originals themselves unnecessary'. Of course even photographs have their limitations. But it would be unwise to be deterred from issuing them by the ill-informed practices of J. S. Farmer in preparing his Tudor Facsimile Texts , or by a knowledge of the kind of errors which can be introduced by the retouching of some kinds of photographic plates. The needs of the textual student would best be served by issuing some reliable form of photographic reproduction, which had been overseen by a responsible scholar, as Sir Walter Greg oversaw the excellent series of Shakespeare Quarto Facsimiles which are now being published by the Oxford University Press. Such an overseer could select the cleanest available copy of the first edition and, where press-variants had been discovered, prepare a composite copy which would give the preferred states of all variant formes, whether 'corrected' or 'uncorrected'. In addition, it would be good to adapt the Malone Society's current procedure and print the overseer's report on press-variants (if possible, with reproductions of the rejected variant formes) together with his lists of misprints and doubtful readings (which would be informed by a scrutiny of all available copies). Finally there could be a brief introduction, again on the model of the Malone Society Reprints. 16 The various photographic processes have differing advantages and disadvantages: prints made from microfilms are, for instance, very inexpensive, but books printed from photographic plates are easier to handle and might prove more susceptible to editorial supervision. Considerable experiment would be required before the best way of providing a large number of high-grade photographic facsimiles is discovered, and this may not prove to be the cheapest method of reproduction. If its cost cannot be kept low enough, some form of subvention or special subscription would be required: those who gave their support to such a venture would know that they were providing the fullest possible 'textual authorities' which could not be superseded as, inevitably, any old-spelling edition must be in the eyes of the fully-trained textual student. 17 It might be contended that many Elizabethan and Jacobean plays do not present problems complex enough to justify the provision of photographic facsimiles. But as textual students learn more about the working of compositors in the early printing-houses, so 'unimportant' plays come into prominence in their studies; thus, for example, The Two Maids of Moreclack has become necessary for a study of the Pied Bull quarto of King Lear because it was partly set by the compositor who, a year earlier, had set King Lear . 18 When one is working on a complex dramatic text, it can be a great help to observe one of the compositors of that text working on another play, no matter how trivial the textual problems of that second play may be. The ideal for a textual student is the complete corpus of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama in photographic reproductions, overseen and commented upon by responsible scholars. And with advances in cheap photographic processes there is little reason why concerted effort should not provide this in the course of fifty years or so. The sooner the student's needs are recognised and the mechanical possibility acknowledged, the sooner the ideal can be realized.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Old-Spelling Critical Edition A far more complicated problem is the rationale of old-spelling critical editions of Elizabethan and Jacobean plays. And here also it must be expected that the advances in textual studies have modified both purposes and achievements. At the beginning of this century it might have been supposed that these editions were especially prepared for the textual student; now, in the introductory remarks to his old-spelling edition of Dekker's Dramatic Works , published in 1953, Professor Bowers has stated clearly: A critical edition is neither a diplomatic nor a facsimile reprint addressed principally to those who need to make a close study of the most minute formal characteristics of a text, and hence some degree of silent alteration is advisable. 19 If a facsimile reprint is now of limited use to a textual student, an old-spelling critical edition will be even less able to satisfy him. In Professor Bowers' admirable edition of Dekker, which may be taken as an up-to-date example of such texts, the editor's silent alterations disregard the lining of prose, destroy the evidence that any verse-line is a full line of type, expand contractions, regularize the position and typography of stage-directions and speech-headings, and emend 'faulty punctuation' at the end of complete speeches. Moreover Professor Bowers has not indicated the relation his printed text bears to the pages of the original editions. Such procedures make it impossible for a textual student to use this kind of edition for a close study of any Elizabethan or Jacobean play, for an attempt to decide how its spelling, punctuation, lining and general arrangement were modified in the printing-house; he would never know whether he was in possession of all the relevant facts for debating the value of an emendation or discovering the presence of textual corruption. Such a text is not designed for him but for 'a modern reader accustomed to [sixteenth- or] seventeenth-century usage' 20 and who is willing to take the editor's work on trust. The simplest example will help to show how some modern readers are served. Let us neglect, for the time being, all occasions when there may be some doubt about what old-spelling an editor should print or when there is an ambiguity in the meaning of the text, and let us suppose that a 'modern reader familiar with seventeenth-century usage' is confronted with an old-spelling, critical edition of a play of that period: what will it mean to him? Let us take, for example, the word owl . When Mr. F. L. Lucas, the learned editor of Webster, found 'Oowle' in the original edition of The Duchess of Malfi , he wished to keep that spelling in his edition of the play, commenting: "Oowle can only mean "Owl" and is far too expressive to be given up." 21 Another reader, of a more precise turn of mind, might seize on the same spelling as an example of ME 'Q' becoming late ME 'ū', under the influence of the 'w', 22 and might presume that Webster required such a pronunciation. But someone familiar with both seventeenth-century usage and recent textual studies will know that these readers are making unwarrantable assumptions; at once several questions arise: 1). Was this spelling in the printer's manuscript copy, or did a compositor introduce it? Or, to put this another way, is this a characteristic spelling of Nicholas Okes' 'Compositor A' who set 'Oowle' on El (II.iii.9) but 'Owle' on K4 (IV.ii.360), 23 and was the position in which the word occurred on the printed page such that his spelling might have been influenced by the need to justify the line of type or a desire to emphasise the beginning of a line or speech? 2). If 'Oowle' was in the copy, did the scrivener, who prepared this manuscript, 24 introduce this spelling, or was it in the author's manuscript? 3). If 'Oowle' was in the author's original manuscript, was the spelling just a flourish, or an accident, or the result of a significant, though probably unconscious, act? 4). If 'Oowle' was a significant authorial spelling, how should it be pronounced and how should this pronunciation contrast with the author's pronunciation as a whole? 5). Is the capital 'O' authoritative and significant? The fact is that only a specialist could attempt to interpret such a spelling in terms of Webster's original intentions: the most that can readily be proved from it is that 'Oowle' passed the proof-reader of the first edition of The Duchess of Malfi . To deduce anything further of the author's intentions the reader must be a textual, literary and linguistic student, well acquainted with other books from the same printing-house and other works by the same author, and in possession of the original edition in which it appeared, or a photographic reproduction of it. The same is true of wider divergences from modern usages: anyone who has examined the work of Elizabethan and Jacobean compositors in reprints, or has collated scriveners' transcripts, will know that lanthorn might be substituted for lantern, Bermoothes for Bermoothas, and so forth, in accordance with a workman's predilections or the exigencies of justification or type-shortage; the presence of any of these forms in a modern, old-spelling edition can tell the reader nothing certain about the author's intentions. Those scholars who have prepared a modern edition reproducing the spelling of a first edition would claim that its spelling is nearer to the author's original spelling than that of a modernized text. 25 This, of course, is true, for some of the author's spellings will survive the modifications of scribes, compositors and proof-correctors, and the number of survivals may be high, especially in books printed before 1600. 26 But, nevertheless, as soon as a reader of a modern old-spelling edition puts his faith in any single spelling as due to his author, he is making assumptions which cannot be warranted without recourse to further evidence than that provided by the text before him. Now that this is fully realised, is it not preferable to leave old-spelling to those who can begin to appreciate it (and prepare photographic reproductions for their convenience), and not give other readers a mass of in-formation which they must—if they know their limitations—ignore? If a 'modern reader familiar with sixteenth- and seventeenth-century usage' cannot (or, rather, should not) take the spelling of an old-spelling critical edition seriously with respect to the author's intentions, there must be some other reasons for presenting him with such a text. One reason that has been advanced is that it is appropriate to read an author in the spelling of his first edition, even if that was not the author's spelling—an old play in an old spelling. Sir Walter Greg has said: To print banquet for banket, fathom for faddom, lantern for lanthorn, murder for murther, mushroom for mushrump, orphan for orphant, perfect for parfit, portcullis for perculace, tattered for tottered, vile for vild, wreck for wrack, and so on, and so on, is sheer perversion. 27 —a perversion that is of Elizabethan English, not necessarily of the English of the particular author. But it is also a perversion to recognise these particular forms as antique or special: lanthorn, murther, parfit, vild , and so forth were every-day spellings in the sixteenth- and seventeenth-centuries and presumably represented every-day pronunciations; often they had no associations differentiating them from the alternative, now standard, forms. 28 There were some authors, as Jonson and Spenser, who took special care to ensure an individual form of spelling in their printed works; but these were exceptional in Elizabethan and Jacobean times and most authors and readers (each of whom always spelt to please himself) must have accepted the irregular spelling of their printed books with something close to the unthinking ease with which we accept modern, regular spelling. 'Old-Spelling' was neither old nor odd nor distinctive to them, and it is impossible for us to read a play as they did. The 'Elizabethan flavour' of an old-spelling text is a modern phenomenon (as the term 'old spelling' is itself), and its dissemination can do no service to the original authors or their works. Of course if it could be shown that for a particular author parfit or vild had particular connotations compared with perfect or vile, and that the occurrences of that word in particular contexts were not due to scribal or compositorial interference, then a reader would wish to have the old form in the edition he was using—it would take its place with those old words which have no satisfactory modern equivalent in sense or metrical value and must be retained on that account. But such occasions are likely to be infrequent. A perversion of Elizabethan English is inevitable in both old-spelling and modern-spelling texts, and so it may seem advisable to choose that kind of edition which dispenses with the risky impression of the 'real' thing, to avoid a text which is anachronistically unusual and full of minute distinctions which the inexperienced reader might easily observe too curiously and the experienced one must ignore or else seek more information to interpret. It is hardly relevant to bring up the question of pronunciation in this connection, for if it would be hard to make a consistent attempt to speak the speeches from an autograph manuscript as the author would have pronounced them, it would be impossible to pronounce them in any meaningful fashion from the doubly or trebly confused orthography of a printed book. And failing a consistent Elizabethan pronunciation, there seems little point in restoring a partial 'Elizabethan' pronunciation to those few words whose old spellings more clearly suggest a sound different from the customary modern ones. Perhaps one of the chief reasons why scholars prepare modern, old-spelling editions is the difficulty of preparing modern-spelling ones. The ambiguity of the original spelling presents the most intractable problems. Not that a reader familiar with seventeenth-century literature will be perplexed by 'lose' for 'loose' and 'lose' in modern- or in old-spelling texts; nor 'curtsy' for 'curtsy' and 'courtesy'; he needs to be watchful for such ambiguities in both kinds of texts. But sometimes the ambiguity of an original edition embraces two modern words which are not clearly related in form or sense: so in 'How now brother what trauailing to bed to your kind wife' 29 , 'trauailing' is an old spelling for both the modern 'travelling' and the modern 'travailing'; or 'Machiuillian', 30 besides being the equivalent of the modern 'Machiavellian', may also allude to the word 'villain'. For such words a modernizing editor would either have to make an exception and keep these few, old forms unchanged in his text (thus giving them false prominence, along with words retained because there is no acceptable 31 modern equivalent), or, with greater consistency, he would have to content himself with printing the primary modern spelling in his text and noting the ambiguity of the original spelling in a footnote. The old-spelling method of reproducing the spelling of the copy-text seems easier here, but the advantage is not all on that side. If the compositor of the first example had set 'trauail' on all other occasions in the text where modern 'travel' was required and modern 'travail' could not possibly be implied, or if, in reprints, he was known to have changed 'trauel' to 'trauail' with no cause to do so, then the chance that the author wrote 'trauail' is considerably diminished; then 'travel' in the text and a footnote suggesting the slight possibility of a quibble would seem to be all that was required in order to present the author's intentions for a modern reader. The chief difficulty with an old-spelling text, in this respect, is that, while it keeps all the allusive ambiguities of the original, it gives equal importance to those which, on further study, are almost certainly authorial and those which are almost certainly accidental and impertinent—unless, of course, the old-spelling editor resorts to explanatory footnotes like a modernizing one. So far only ambiguous spellings actually found in first editions have been considered, but the argument must be taken further. Several facts need to be remembered: firstly, that a compositor could remove ambiguous spellings as well as introduce them; secondly, that some spellings were ambiguous to Elizabethans which are now understood in one sense only; thirdly, that ambiguity of spelling does not necessarily imply ambiguity of meaning, even if it could be proved that the author himself was responsible for it—he could have used the ambiguous form unintentionally. It follows that an experienced reader of an old-spelling text knows that many of the author's ambiguous spellings may have been lost and that any ambiguous spelling in the text may be fortuitous; he would in fact be on the look-out for double meanings at all points, regardless of the spelling of any particular word. Old spelling is therefore no guarantee that a reader will appreciate all the author's meanings: its ambiguities will often mislead the inexperienced reader and must always be questioned by the experienced in the light of his own ever-watchful literary awareness. In view of this, some editors may wish to accept the situation frankly and present a fully modernized text, placing the burden unequivocally on the reader and aiding him by such textual and interpretative notes as an editor can add from his detailed study of the original printed text and of the author's complete works. Early dramatic texts have some ambiguous spellings which could not possibly imply ambiguity of meaning, but rather two mutually exclusive meanings. Such are Old Spelling Modern Counterparts heare, etc. hear, here I I, Ay of of, off the the, thee then then, than to to, too whose whose, who's The use of an apostrophe before or after final s raises similar problems: cats in an Elizabethan text may stand for modern cats, cat's cats ', or, with elision, cat is, and occasionally the sense of a passage can bear two or three of these exclusive meanings. The old-spelling editor is here at a disadvantage, for, keeping the ambiguous spelling, he must make its meaning plain, or draw attention to its ambiguity, in a footnote. The modernizing editor judges each case on its own merits and prints the preferred modern spelling, adding a footnote to explain his decision; the meaning of the text itself will not be dependant on a footnote unless the editor can find no clear preference between the alternative meanings of the original text. It has been said that an old-spelling, critical editor 'could console himself' in difficulties such as these 'with the knowledge that his scholarly readers were in possession of sufficient evidence to make up their own minds'. 32 But this is no longer true: a choice between two exclusive meanings, as between modern to and too , may often depend on a knowledge of a compositor's predilections, of text-space and type-shortage, and so to attempt a decision in any particular instance, a 'scholarly reader' must be furnished with a copy of the original edition or a photographic reproduction of it. Without provision for all this, no reader should dare to make up his mind. Clearly this is an editor's responsibility, and the most convenient way of assuming it is to give the modern, unequivocal form in the printed text wherever possible; it is only the fully equipped textual student who can travail on these strange seas alone. The time has come for editors to consider whether they should not adopt the policy of 'all and nothing' with regard to the spelling of Elizabethan and Jacobean plays: for those who can attempt to interpret the old-spelling, there can nowadays be the photographic reproduction of a first edition; for those who cannot (or in the time at their disposal do not wish to exert themselves to that extent), there should be a critical edition, as fully modernized as possible—one that can be relied on not to give meaningless or erroneous detail, and one that interprets the ambiguities of the original text in the light of the fullest possible knowledge. Anything between these two extremes would be incomplete for the specialist, and misleading for other readers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Photographic and the Modernized Edition Problems of spelling must be considered with other problems, of which the choice of punctuation is the most important. At first, spelling and punctuation seem to offer very much the same difficulties: as early compositors altered the spelling of their copy so they altered its punctuation in accordance with their own predilections, the availability of type, and the exigencies of justification; and the author's punctuation, like his spelling, may have been modified by professional scriveners, and printing-house editors and correctors. Moreover there are some ambiguities in Elizabethan usage, notably the use of '?' where a modern writer would use '!' and the occasional omission of queries. So it may be said that the right place for the 'old punctuation' is the first edition or a photographic reproduction of it. There is no point in reproducing it in a modern, critical edition, because only a reader who knows how and where the compositor may have modified the author's original punctuation can begin to interpret it properly; if he does not know, for instance, that Nicholas Okes' 'Compositor A', around 1612, very frequently added unnecessary punctuation to the ends of verselines or that William Jaggard's 'Compositor B', around 1622, frequently introduced parentheses, 33 and if he does not know where these compositors have been working and under what conditions, the punctuation of a first edition from either of these workshops would seriously mislead him with regard to its author's intentions; a reader of a modern edition with 'old' punctuation can take no single punctuation mark on trust. In failing to interpret to those who require interpretation, and in failing to present all the evidence to those who can interpret for themselves, an editor reproducing the old punctuation in a modern edition is ignoring his responsibilities in two directions. But there is one important difference between spelling and punctuation, namely that there is no one, standard, modern punctuation, as there is a standard spelling. This means that an editor may punctuate to please himself, but not to conform to any generally accepted model; so he needs a further directive than simply the call to modernize. When patient analysis of an original edition discovers no trace of the author's punctuation the modernizing editor must be told to modernize in the light of his own taste and his own knowledge of his author's style and artistic intentions. But when circumstances are more favourable and the editor can distinguish some individual marks of punctuation that were probably in his author's manuscript, then he may be counselled to attempt to develop a kind of punctuation for that particular text which will retain—or, better, represent—those authorial elements. This will never be an easy task but anyone who has taken part in a theatrical performance will know how radically a change of pointing can alter the speed, tone or force of almost every line of dialogue; in comparison the choice between lanthorn and lantern is often trivial. For this reason special care should be taken with the punctuation of dramatic texts and an editor should not rely solely on his own ideas of standard modern punctuation until he has tried every means of discovering the nature of the pointing of the author's manuscript behind the first authoritative edition. Very occasionally it may be possible for him to attempt a 'restoration' of the original punctuation; often he may be able to evolve a mode of punctuation that reflects some traces of it. Spelling must be either 'old' (reproducing the copy-text exactly) or 'new' (in accordance with the modern standard), but punctuation, by its nature, can have many variations, and therefore admits a compromise solution. The use of italic type and capitals, and the treatment of compound words and elisions, may occasionally allow similar compromises, for a reader can accept modifications of standard modern practices in these respects without much difficulty. Capitals were usually used, not where emphasis was required (as A. W. Pollard once suggested they were 34 ), but wherever a word began with 'C', 'T', 'M', or 'A', or some other group of letters depending on meaningless tricks of the author's hand-writing or the compositor's setting, or on the availability of type; an editor will therefore usually conform entirely to modern usage. Likewise, when elision is clearly erratic, counteracting the metre at many points, then an editor will allow himself considerable freedom in this respect. But where any of these details, or the use of italics or hyphens, appears to be authoritative, there it is the responsibility of a modern editor to present his own text in a manner which will reflect as fully as possible what, in his judgment, the author intended. And in all these details, the only place for a complete acceptance of the 'old' usage—the usage of the book, not of the author—seems to be a photographic reproduction in which the student may have all the evidence by which to judge and interpret it. An editor can assume no responsibilities and show all the evidence by photographic means, or else he should assume all the practicable responsibilities. The principles suggested for the treatment of spelling would hold good for punctuation and all these other details of an editor's task—with some modifications in favour of the restoration of the author's usages wherever an editor judges that he can undertake this with a fair chance of success. These principles are different from those which underlie most of the editorial work in progress today. Yet they have been determined in the light of new and developing textual and bibliographical techniques and take advantage of new techniques for preparing cheap photographic reproductions of the original editions; these are factors which have become important after the present orthodoxy was established, and therefore the alternative editorial principles might well be worth serious consideration. They have only been stated in simple form in this paper; elaborations would have to follow. Fortunately, experience of modern-spelling editions has been gained in preparing the multi-volume editions of Shakespeare, like the Yale, New Cambridge, and New Arden Shakespeares, and in the new complete editions by Professors Alexander and Sisson; here many different editors have experimented with ways of collating the spelling of the original edition where this affects the choice of an emendation, of restoring and interpreting what they judge to have been the author's punctuation, lining and so forth, of representing ambiguities and, generally, of being both fully responsible and fully interpretative. Their methods have not always been informed by up-to-date textual and linguistic understanding, but, when they have been, these editors have achieved useful work. The highly developed methods for editing type-facsimile reprints would likewise aid the preparation and overseeing of the new photographic reproductions. For complex textual authorities, involving more than one substantive text, photographic reproductions would be required of each text, and a convenient method would have to be developed to provide, with them, a collation of their differences, substantive and, perhaps, accidental. These difficulties need not stand for long in the way of preparing modern photographic reproductions and modern, fully interpretative, critical editions, if such texts would truly fulfil the present-day needs of students and readers, and what can be guessed of those of tomorrow. In considering these alternative principles for editing and reproducing Elizabethan and Jacobean plays, each reader should consider his own experiences and ask how frequently he has wished for a closer approximation to the original edition than a type-facsimile reprint or an old-spelling, critical edition could provide, and how frequently he has wished that obscurities had been resolved when he has been reading an old-spelling, critical edition, without a primary concern for textual matters. He should ask, too, whether a photograph and a fully responsible, modernized, critical text would not answer all his needs.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Rationale of Old-Spelling Editions of the Plays of Shakespeare and his Contemporaries: A Rejoinder by Arthur Brown</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If there is only one point on which my namesake, John Russell Brown, and I are agreed, it is a very important one — the necessity for full and frank discussion of editorial methods, and for a clear understanding on the part of editors of what they are about. Several years ago, in a discussion of 'semi-popular' editions of Shakespeare, 1 I pleaded for a greater sense of responsibility from those engaged in the preparation of such editions, and much of what John Brown says seems to me to reinforce my plea; although perhaps not always in ways which he intended. Since he has declared his own vested interests — I do not, of course, use this phrase in any pejorative sense — as editor of a forthcoming modernized spelling edition of Webster, I should declare my own, as a member of the Council of the Malone Society, and as editor of a forthcoming old-spelling edition of Thomas Heywood. I do not think that in either his case or mine these interests have yet induced a state of positive prejudice. Any form of reproduction of a sixteenth or seventeenth century play, whether it be by photography, by type facsimile, or by an edition in old or modernized spelling, must involve some degree of compromise, and it seems to me that one of the first considerations of an editor must be how far he is prepared to compromise in the presentation of his original. What is disturbing in John Brown's article is his apparent disregard, apart from one brief sentence ('Of course even photographs have their limitations'), of the degree of compromise involved in photographic reproduction. When he emphasizes, quite properly, that the textual student 'must be on the look-out for the slightest irregularity in the original printing', 2 that he must consider possible disarrangement of type in assessing the evidence of press variants, that he must consider the possible needs of justification in collecting evidence from spelling tests for identification of compositors, that he must be able to identify odd pieces of type in his examination of the method of casting off copy, Brown almost invariably concludes with the formula 'for such work either the original edition or a photographic reproduction of it is required'. Occasionally he specifies 'a good photographic reproduction', but the point I wish to make is that he seems to find the original and the photographic reproduction of equal value in these matters. In spite of the mass of evidence to the contrary, far too many people still have a touching faith in the notion that 'the camera does not lie'. From one point of view photographic reproduction is, for a textual student, the most dangerous thing of all, for the very method of producing it and its 'likeness' to the original lull him into a sense of false security, and put him off his guard against the multitude of tiny errors — the very things he ought to be interested in — which may creep in despite all the precautions of the photographer. It is no doubt unnecessary to warn Brown against the slight curve in the surface to be photographed, which may easily distort letters and spaces, particularly those near the margins; against badly inked letters and punctuation marks which assume a different form in the reproduction; against letters which have not inked at all, printing 'blind' in the original but disappearing altogether in the reproduction; against any haphazard ink mark or fly spot in the original to which a reproduction may give a new lease of life. All these hazards are known to textual students, or should be, and many more besides. And I feel that it is particularly risky to attempt to identify odd pieces of type from reproductions subject to hazards such as these; in this matter surely, if nowhere else, only the original will serve. Undoubtedly Brown is aware of the dangers; but in making such an eloquent plea for the provision of photographic facsimiles, to the extent of practically equating them with originals, it might have been fairer not to gloss over them entirely. It is remarkable, incidentally, that he makes no reference to the importance of a study of watermarks to the textual student, for which even the best photographic reproduction will not afford him much help. Lack of space no doubt prevented Brown from enlarging on what he means by a 'good' or 'reliable' facsimile, but he quotes with approval 'the excellent series of Shakespeare Quarto Facsimiles which are now being published by the Oxford University Press' and which were being overseen by the late Sir Walter Greg. In general I share his approval, but he cannot be unaware that the Press has abandoned the original method of collotype reproduction for a less satisfactory one, and that it was possible for Professor Bowers, in his review of two of the most recent volumes, Loves Labours Lost and Henry V , to make some quite serious criticisms both of the methods and of the results. 3 'Considerable experiment would be required before the best way of providing a large number of high-grade photographic facsimiles is discovered, and this may not prove to be the cheapest method of reproduction,' says Brown. If for may we substitute will , we shall be in less danger of understatement, especially if these facsimiles are to be composite copies, giving 'the preferred states of all variant formes' and 'if possible, reproductions of the rejected variant formes'. If the work is to be done in such a way that these facsimiles are even to approach rivalry with the originals, it is no use talking about 'advances in cheap photographic processes' (italics mine); nor do I share Brown's optimism about subventions and special subscriptions. He envisages a 'complete corpus of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama in photographic reproductions, overseen and commented upon by responsible scholars' in the course of fifty years or so. He may be right; but I hope that we shall both be in a position to take a more detached view of the problem by then, and meanwhile we have to face present day realities. But from the point of view of the textual critic, why all this pother about photographic facsimiles? He knows, if he has had any experience at all, that in his heart of hearts he must not trust them in the last resort in any matter of significance, that with the best he can get at the moment (or is likely to get in the foreseeable future) 'constant and continuous reference to the originals' for his special purposes will still be necessary. It was said of one of the pioneers in this field that 'in matters of bibliography he would not take the word of the arch-angel Gabriel on trust', and in the present rapid, almost bewildering, development of bibliographical techniques I see no reason for departing from this principle. When the textual critic has admitted, as he must, that his photographic facsimile is no more than a compromise and a convenience, it seems to me to matter little in principle whether he is using microfilm, positive or negative photostat, or a 'good' photograph; he will still consider himself bound, one hopes, to check all his findings against the original before committing himself to any statements. Further, human nature being what it is, even amongst textual critics of Brown's calibre, the more help he is given in the way of lists of variant readings, doubtful readings, misprints, and the like (all of which are envisaged by Brown as having a place in the kind of facsimile he wants for textual work), especially if these have been provided by 'a responsible scholar', the more he will be tempted to take on trust things which he should work out for himself. This may sound like a counsel of despair; but the textual critic must realize that his is a hard and exacting task, often unrewarding, and that more often than not he works out his own salvation or perishes. A photographic facsimile, whatever its quality and whatever kind of commentary is attached to it, is still a compromise and a convenience on which the critic relies at his peril; and the more he is encouraged to rely on it, the greater the peril. For the purposes of the textual critic, then, in the last resort access to the original is the only answer, and I find much of Brown's theorising about facsimiles irrelevant from this point of view. The world is not, however, composed entirely of textual critics, not even the scholarly world, and I find much of his discussion of type facsimiles and old and modernized spelling editions coloured by the apparent assumption that it is. It is for this reason that I feel he has done less than justice to the type facsimiles of the Malone Society. For while it may be true that the modern textual critic is working now in fields which the older editors of the Society did not, for obvious reasons, fully appreciate, yet the Society's editorial principles have always been so clearly defined and so strictly enjoined upon its editors that, provided the reader is aware of these, there is little danger of his being misled. Even for the textual critic I do not feel that these volumes are as useless as Brown seems to think. Supposing that he has no easy access to the original that he wishes to study, and supposing that he has either no facsimile, or only a poor one, or even quite a good one; he can be sure that his Malone Society edition has been prepared by someone carefully chosen for the job, that this editor has had access to the original, that he has spent many hours working on it, that his introduction will contain much, if not all, of the information that a textual critic needs at least to help him on his way to his own examination of the text in question, that all departures from the original have been carried out within carefully defined limits, and that the editor's work has at all stages been checked by another carefully chosen person. I freely admit that we are again faced by compromise and convenience; but I cannot feel much more grief for the textual critic who has only his Malone Society edition to work on than I can for one who has his photographic facsimile. For their special purposes they will both be forced back to the original. Once we leave the textual critic working in his specialized field, questions of compromise and convenience become in some respects rather more acute, for there exists a variety of readers whose needs can only be properly met by some degree of editorial intervention. I find myself at a loss to understand, still less appreciate, Brown's attitude towards edited texts of any kind, since his own words seem to imply that he has only one class of reader in mind: 'If a facsimile reprint is now of limited use to a textual student, an old-spelling critical edition will be even less able to satisfy him.' To my mind, as I have tried to suggest in my discussion of photographic facsimiles, it has always been true that for the textual student as such nothing is satisfactory but the original edition or editions of the text with which he is involved. From this point of view, therefore, Brown's strictures upon the silent alterations in the Cambridge old-spelling edition of Dekker are irrelevant, for the genuine textual student will not, in the last resort, go to such an edition to decide how 'the spelling, punctuation, lining and general arrangement' of his play 'were modified in the printing house'. On the other hand Brown is surely guilty of exaggeration when he suggests that such a student 'would never know [from such a text] whether he was in possession of all the relevant facts for debating the value of an emendation or discovering the presence of a textual corruption'. I use the word 'exaggeration' deliberately, because of course it is in a sense true that no one will ever know this, whether he is using originals for himself or relying on facsimiles or using an old-spelling edition or ( pace Brown) a modernized edition. But surely the most casual glance at the textual introductions to the plays in Bowers's Dekker , at his lists of copies examined, at his lists of variants found in these copies, at his lists of emendations of accidentals, should convince the most hardened textual sceptic that here was material collected and presented under the control of a rigid discipline and a strict sense of responsibility, the conclusions drawn from which he might well be 'willing to take on trust' — unless he wished to do the whole job again for his own satisfaction; as, of course, he well might for his special purposes as a textual student. 4 Nor do I understand, from the point of view of the reader for whom these texts are being produced, the fuss that Brown makes about the uncertainties of authorial spelling as opposed to compositorial spelling. Of course 'a workman's predilections or the exigencies of justification or type-shortage' might account for variations in spelling, and might effectively disguise the author's own spelling, although unless we are to suppose that the average Elizabethan compositor, maliciously or otherwise, went out of his way to vary the spelling of every other word in the copy before him this factor might be much less important than Brown seems to imply. But are there many intelligent people reading these plays nowadays who are not aware of this and who would put their trust 'in any single spelling as due to the author'? We must keep a sense of proportion about these things and realize that a statement such as 'the modern reader. . . . cannot (or, rather, should not) take the spelling of an old-spelling critical edition seriously with respect to the author's intentions' is again a serious exaggeration. We know that the compositor interfered; but we need to know a good deal more about compositors and their habits before we can assume, as Brown seems to do, that they interfered to such an extent as to put the author out of the picture altogether. In the whole of his discussion of 'old spelling' Brown seems to raise an entire field of hares; of course the retention of old spelling will result in a number of ambiguities; of course we shall have the chaff along with the wheat, although I feel that for a student of literature any spelling from a text of this period, whether it be authorial or compositorial, should have an intrinsic interest of its own and the distinction between chaff and wheat is not an entirely fair one. But in our present state of knowledge I do not see how this can be avoided; nor do I think any serious damage is done provided that the student does not misuse the evidence presented to him, and on this point Brown seems to be unduly pessimistic, to take it for granted that most people will misuse this evidence. Again, surely a question of editorial responsibility is raised: he will not interfere with the spelling of his edition, but as a result of his training and of his intimate knowledge of the text, its author, and its method of production he should be in a position to guide and warn his readers against making unjustifiable assumptions. I do not quite see the force of Brown's rather casual remark that these ambiguities will remain unresolved in such an edition 'unless, of course, the old-spelling editor resorts to explanatory footnotes like a modernizing one'. It had not occurred to me that such notes were ever considered to be the prerogative of a modernizing editor. 5 I can see no reason why an old-spelling editor should feel himself debarred from including such notes; I have a suspicion that he will also use them more judiciously than his modernizing counterpart. Quoting one of my own remarks against me, Brown seems to suggest that it is no longer true that the scholarly reader of an old-spelling edition will be in possession of sufficient evidence to make up his mind in a case of ambiguity; what I have quoted of Bowers's theory, and what can be seen as his practice in his Dekker surely justifies my original comment. It is a matter of editorial responsibility, as Brown himself remarks and as I tried to make clear in my original paper; but I cannot understand that the most convenient way of assuming this responsibility is 'to give the modern, unequivocal form in the printed text wherever possible', the words 'unequivocal' and 'wherever possible' coming rather strangely after Brown has spent so much time in explaining how tenuous these concepts may be. I cannot understand how a responsible editor can conceive it to be part of his duty to erect more barriers than are absolutely necessary between his reader and the text. I cannot understand how anything between the 'extremes' (perhaps not the best word in this context, but Brown's own) of a photographic reproduction and a fully modernized critical edition must of necessity 'be incomplete for the specialist and misleading for other readers'. A responsible editor of a Malone Society edition is presenting a type-facsimile of a single copy within clearly defined limits, including in a scholarly introduction variants from other copies and any other material of textual significance, and making no changes in the spelling or punctuation of his original; a responsible editor of a critical old-spelling text is presenting a text based upon an examination of all available copies of his original, with emendations of spelling, punctuation and actual words resulting either from this examination or on his own editorial responsibility, feeling himself bound to give reasons for such emendations and to present the evidence upon which he has based them. What can be either incomplete or misleading about these two methods, provided that the user of the volumes has taken the trouble to acquaint himself with the principles involved, passes my comprehension. I have elsewhere expressed my opinions on modernized editions (see note 1 above), and have since seen no reason for modifying them in any important respects. It is a pity that Brown did not elaborate a little more the principles upon which he is proposing to work ('they have only been stated in simple form in this paper', he says), for although it may be true that experience of such modernized editions has been gained from the various series which he mentions, it is also sadly true that so far these have for the most part proceeded by lack of principles rather than by the formulation of consistent ones. To remark, as Brown does, that 'their methods have not always been informed by up-to-date textual and linguistic understanding' is again to be guilty of understatement, as a perusal of some of the recent scholarly reviews of the volumes he cites will make abundantly clear. It will be interesting to see his modernized edition of Webster, not least in order to find out to what extent his apparatus has had to be increased in order to allow him to justify the extra editorial responsibilities that he is apparently prepared to take upon himself. Meanwhile I shall continue to go back to the originals for textual purposes, even if my study is crammed with good photographic reproductions for the occasions when I cannot easily get to a library, and for all other purposes, and even occasionally for textual ones, I shall continue to rely on my Malone Society editions and my critical old-spelling editions, confident that in these I shall find editorial responsibility of a high order and the minimum of editorial intervention between myself and the author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Studies in Bibliography , VIII (1956), 15-26. 2 I do not feel that Brown has been particularly fortunate in his choice of an example to enforce his argument here. He cites a speech by Hippolito from The Honest Whore, Part 2 (1630, sig. A4, in Bowers's edition of Dekker I.i.123-7), calling attention to 'a few abnormally long spaces between words' in the line (set as prose) 'old Iacomo sonne to the Florentine Iacomo , a dog, that to'. I find nothing significant in the spacing of this line, which seems no more 'abnormally long' in this respect than many other lines on the same page and on adjacent pages. Although he makes play with the fact that a Malone Society editor 'must always normalize the spacing of his text' (which seems to me to be an eminently sensible thing to do in a text which is also meant to be read by people not primarily interested in purely bibliographical matters), he does not, apparently, admit that any Malone Society editor worth his salt would, on noticing a genuine and significant example of abnormal spacing in his text, draw attention to the fact in his Introduction. In fact, on almost all occasions on which Brown quotes Malone Society Rules agains the Society, he seems to overlook the fact that these are concerned with the actual presentation of the text, and that editors have very considerable powers of discretion concerning what shall go into their introductions; powers of which a good editor will take full advantage. 3 Modern Language Review , LIII (1958), 235-236. 4 When I reviewed the first volume of Bowers's Dekker ( The Library, IX (1954), 139-142) I raised some points not unlike those raised by Brown now. Bowers was kind enough to reply ( The Library , X (1955), 130-133); the whole of his letter is important, but one sentence is particularly relevant here: 'I hold it incumbent on a critical old-spelling editor to provide for the reader the entire body of evidence from which he derived his text in so far as this relates to the pertinent early documents.' Later in the same letter he adds: 'Any critical scholar utilizing the text should appreciate having all pertinent information within his grasp so that he is not at the mercy of the editor's judgement as to what he will be told of editorial alterations from the most authoritative original document(s) containing the text.' This position I now accept, along with its implications of editorial responsibility; for the notion of 'every man his own bibliographer', which seems to be in Brown's mind in his emphasis upon the provision of photographic facsimiles to all and sundry, is, in the circumstances of modern bibliographical knowledge and technique, untenable. 5 It is true, that so far such explanatory notes have been kept to an absolute minimum in Bowers's Dekker , but in the letter to which I have already referred (note 4 above) Bowers has explained the reason for this and has stated (a statement which is supported by the Cambridge University Press) that it is the intention to follow the text in later volume(s) with appropriate critical and historical essays and notes by another hand.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (V) by Cyrus Hoy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In this fifth section of the present study, the shares of Fletcher's collaborators loom larger than do Fletcher's own. Of the five plays considered herein, his work is clearly evident in only one, The Maid in the Mill , written in collaboration with William Rowley. There are traces of Fletcher in a single scene of The Fair Maid of the Inn , but they are faint, and the supposition would seem to be that Fletcher's share in this, presumably the last play on which he worked, was assumed by Ford who, writing in collaboration with Massinger and Webster, brought the play to completion after his death. In the three remaining plays, I find traces of Fletcher in only one, The Nice Valour . Studies of the authorship problem prior to this one have suggested the possibility of Middleton's presence in this play, and I think that the extant text is, in all essential respects, his work, though whether he is present in the play as Fletcher's reviser or collaborator is impossible to say. But to prove his presence on the basis of linguistic evidence alone is not possible. There is nothing inconsistent between the linguistic pattern of The Nice Valour and that which emerges from Middleton's unaided plays, but evidence of a conclusive sort is lacking. So it is with the fourth play considered, The Laws of Candy . Previous studies of the authorship problem have suggested Ford as the sole or partial author of this play, and I am personally persuaded that it is his; but again the linguistic evidence is such that, while it does not rule out the possibility of attributing the play to Ford, neither does it establish his presence in it. And so, while I have attributed the major share of The Nice Valour to Middleton, and all of The Laws of Candy to Ford, I cannot suppose the authorship of either play to be proved on the basis of the evidence set forth below. With regard to the remaining play that is considered here, Wit at Several Weapons , I feel on somewhat surer ground, for I am able to adduce some linguistic evidence which connects this play with the acknowledged collaborations of Middleton and Rowley, whose joint work I think it is.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The claims of Middleton and Rowley to a share in the plays of the canon will be dealt with first. Linguistic evidence for the unaided plays of Middleton, together with a selection of his city entertainments, is given in tabular form at the end of this section of the present study. Of the thirteen plays listed there, only two, The Widow and No Wit, No Help Like a Woman's , raise any question as to Middleton's unaided authorship. The Widow was published in quarto in 1652 with a title-page ascription to Middleton, Fletcher, and Jonson. The Simpsons can find no trace of Jonson in the extant text, and as they observe, 1 Fletcher is no less difficult to discover in the play. To set the linguistic forms that the play exhibits against those displayed in the body of Middleton's unaided work is to show how much of a piece they are, and how uncharacteristic of Fletcher the language pattern of The Widow —with its 3 ye 's, its 35 y' s, its 26 ha' s—is. No Wit, No Help was first published in the 1657 octavo edition of Middleton's Two New Plays . The play is generally held to have undergone certain revisions by Shirley, the reference in III, 1 to the year 1638 as the present year (a date eleven years after Middleton's death) being the clearest sign of a non-authorial hand. 2 But while the 1657 octavo text does not exhibit what, to judge from the quartos printed during the first three decades of the seventeenth century and from his autograph manuscript of A Game at Chess , seem some of Middleton's most characteristic language forms, these forms, as we shall see, often suffer loss (and in the case of the Middleton a'th' for the contraction o'th' the loss is total) in the texts printed in the 1650's. On the other hand, the extant text of No Wit, No Help does contain occurrences of two forms ( sh'as for she has , and 'tad for it had ) which, on the evidence available, seem to be Middleton's. Thus, the extant text of the play appears to retain traces at least of Middleton's linguistic practices; and since there is nothing anomalous in the pattern of linguistic usage that the text exhibits, there seems no reason why such confirmatory evidence as is to be gathered from it should not be taken into account. About a number of Middleton's language practices, there is nothing very singular. The occurrence of ye in his plays is negligible; it occurs not at all in three plays, and is found no more than 8 times in a single play. Contractions in y' , however, occur more frequently, though the variation between plays is extreme, from the single y'are of A Chaste Maid in Cheapside to the 51 instances of a variety of such contractions ( y'are, y'have, y'ave ) in Women Beware Women . Middleton's use of hath ranges from the 14 occurrences in A Chaste Maid and The Witch , to no occurrences in Women Beware Women and The Widow. Doth occurs no more than 4 times in a single play, and not at all in 5 plays. The typical Middleton practice with regard to both forms is perhaps most clearly seen in his autograph manuscript of A Game at Chess , when hath is used 4 times and doth does not appear. In twelve of Middleton's thirteen unaided plays, the contracted ' em exceeds—and often greatly exceeds—the expanded them . The contraction i'th' occurs regularly throughout his unaided work, and his use of it is indistinguishable from that of any number of his contemporary dramatists. It is with regard to the contraction o'th' that we find what appears to be a distinct linguistic practice. The evidence is fragmentary, but such as it is, it indicates clearly that the contraction which generally appears in early seventeenth century drama as o'th' was spelled by Middleton at'h' . The a'th' spelling is a perfectly normal variant of the o'th' contraction, and the sporadic occasions when it has occurred in the midst of a predominantly o'th' pattern in the plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher canon have been duly noted in the various linguistic tables in previous sections of the present study. 3 But in Middleton, the a'th' spelling is not sporadic, but is evidence of a prevailing feature of his linguistic practice. The basis for regarding the a'th' spelling as authorial is the fact that it appears 3 times in the autograph manuscript of A Game at Chess ( o'th' does not occur). In four printed texts as well, a'th' is found alone: 7 times in Your Five Gallants , 3 times in A Trick to Catch the Old One , once in the Inner Temple Masque , once in Entertainment III of the Honorable Entertainments . Elsewhere, the two forms appear together, so pointing up the truth that compositors did not always distinguish between them. 4 But the a'th' spelling is found in each of the other Middleton quartos printed during the first three decades of the century: 9 times in Michaelmas Term , as against a single occurrence of o'th' ; 8 times in A Mad World my Masters ( o'th' 7 times); 5 times in The Phoenix ( o'th' once); once in A Chaste Maid ( o'th' twice). 5 Thereafter, the form appears no more, for the printed texts of Middleton's unaided plays published during the 1650's ( The Widow ; No Wit, No Help ; Women Beware Women ; More Dissemblers Besides Women ) do not preserve the a'th' spelling. When it appears in the plays of which Middleton was a joint author that were printed during this period, its occurrence is undependable. The form appears twice in the 1656 quarto text of Middleton, Rowley, and Massinger's The Old Law, once in a part of II,1 (sig. D4) that seems to be Middleton's, once in a scene (IV,1; sig. G3 v ) that is certainly Rowley's. And in the 1662 quarto of Middleton and Webster's Anything for a Quiet Life the form occurs twice, but both times in a section of V,1 (sig. G1) that is usually attributed to Webster, who, as has been seen in an earlier section of the present study ( SB , XII, 103), occasionally employs the form. As I have already observed, the a'th' spelling in Middleton is but one feature of a general linguistic practice that is evident in all his work. He regularly employs a , the weakened form of the prepositions on and of , in a variety of phrases, and not alone in the standard contraction for on/of the . 6 In this, of course, he is not alone among his contemporary dramatists, and it is the sheer frequency with which such phrases as the following occur in his unaided work that gives them any significance as authorial evidence: "a tother side" ( A Trick , sig. G1 A Game at Chess , III,1,56); "a my troth" ( A Trick , sigs. G2, H1 v ; A Mad World , sigs. H1, H2 v ; Phoenix , sig. B1); "a my life" ( A Trick , sig. H2); "a my credit" ( A Mad World , sig. G4 v ); "a horseback" ( A Mad World , sig. H3 v ; A Chaste Maid , sig. G2); "a Sundaies" ( Michaelmas Term , sig. E1 v ); "a purpose" ( A Trick , sig. A4; Hengist , IV,2,22; No Wit, No Help , sig. E4 v ); "a one side" ( World Tost at Tennis , sig. D4 v ); "a this side" ( A Trick , sig. D4; World Tost , sig. D3); "a both sides" ( Honorable Entertainments , sig E1 v ); "a this fashion" ( A Trick , sig. C4 v ); "a such a nature" ( Michaelmas Term , sigs. F3 v , F4); "a pound a Beef" ( No Wit, No Help , sig. D6 v ); "peece a plate" ( A Trick , sig. C4 v ). Middleton's use of the contraction h'as for he has is very like Fletcher's; 7 but he uses as well a series of related forms that are rather more distinctive. Of these, the most significant is sh'as for she has , which appears in ten of his thirteen unaided plays, in The Triumphs of Integrity , and in Entertainments VIII and X of the Honorable Entertainments . The corresponding past tense forms— h'ad for he had , and sh'ad for she had —Middleton makes less use of, but they are worth noting in his work because they are so infrequent elsewhere. Sh'as does not occur in the unaided plays of either Fletcher or Massinger. In the plays of the canon considered thus far in the present study, it occurs but a single time in two: in The Double Marriage , and in the Lambarde manuscript text of Beggars' Bush. H'ad occurs in six of Fletcher's unaided plays: twice in The Pilgrim , a single time in The Mad Lover, Valentinian, A Wife for a Month, Women Pleased , and in the Lambarde manuscript text of The Woman's Prize . It occurs a single time in one of the unaided plays ( Believe as you List ) of Massinger. Elsewhere among the plays of the canon considered thus far, there are single occurrences of h'ad in The Scornful Lady, The Maid's Tragedy, Love's Pilgrimage, The Coxcombe, The Honest Man's Fortune, The Queen of Corinth (plays connected with either Beaumont or Field). Sh'ad is found in none of the unaided plays of Fletcher; a single time in one ( The Duke of Milan ) of Massinger; and elsewhere in the canon to this point, a single time in The Knight of Malta and in the manuscript text of Beggars' Bush . The contraction 'tas for it has is found in eight of Middleton's unaided plays, and there is a single occurrence as well in Entertainment X of the Honorable Entertainments . The corresponding contraction 'tad for it had appears in five of the unaided plays. Both forms are found twice in Middleton scenes of The Old Law . For all the fact that 'tas is found no more than 4 times in any one play, and 'tad no more than twice, Middleton's use of both contractions is worth noting, again, because of their infrequency elsewhere. Fletcher uses 'tas twice in a single play ( Rule a Wife ); Massinger never uses the form in his unaided work. Elsewhere in the canon 'tas appears twice in Wit Without Money ; once in The Lovers' Progress, Thierry and Theodoret, The Noble Gentleman, The Honest Man's Fortune . Neither Fletcher nor Massinger uses 'tad in his unaided work; and elsewhere it is found in only four plays of the canon: twice in Cupid's Revenge , and in the manuscript of Beggars' Bush ; once in Thierry and Theodoret , and in The Little French Lawyer . There is nothing significant in Middleton's use of contractions in 's for his . The final feature of his linguistic pattern that does possess value as authorial evidence is his use of the contraction ha' for have . The form has been found in the work of other dramatists whose shares in the plays of the canon have been previously examined, notably in the work of Beaumont and Field. 8 Ha' is found in nine of Middleton's thirteen unaided plays, in the Inner Temple Masque , and in the Honorable Entertainments . Although the form seems to have suffered no diminution in the 1652 quarto of The Widow , it appears in none of the plays printed in octavo in 1657. Even in the plays in which the form does appear, its rate of occurrence varies widely, from the 33 occurrences in Michaelmas Term to the 2 in A Game at Chess ; but, with the exceptions already noted, and the manuscript text of Hengist, King of Kent , from which it is wholly absent, the persistence with which ha' appears in Middleton's unaided work makes it worth noting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Rowley's unaided plays are usually said to be four in number: A Shoemaker A Gentleman; A New Wonder, A Woman Never Vext; All's Lost by Lust; A Match at Midnight . That the last of these is indeed a work of Rowley's sole authorship, I seriously doubt. When the linguistic pattern which it displays is set against that exhibited by the other three plays, as in the table for Rowley's plays that is given below, it is soon apparent that, linguistically at least, A Match at Midnight is not of a piece with the others. 9 Linguistically, A Match displays too much of nearly everything: too many i'th' s, too many o'th' s, much too many ye' s. The matter is of some importance, because to posit a pattern of linguistic usage for Rowley that takes into account A Match at Midnight , with its near-Fletcherian incidence of ye , is to assume what none of the available evidence will bear out. That ye has no significant place in Rowley's language practices is clear from the evidence of the three plays that can be regarded as unquestionably his, and is corroborated by the evidence of those plays of which he was a joint author. In the linguistic patterns of these, ye is far from prominent. The whole of Middleton and Rowley's A Fair Quarrel yields but 7 ye' s; their World Tost at Tennis displays but 6. Rowley and Webster's A Cure for a Cuckold has 5 ye' s, as does the Rowley-Middleton-Massinger Old Law ; Rowley and Heywood's Fortune by Land and Sea contains two. In the Rowley-Dekker-Ford Witch of Edmonton, ye occurs 9 times, but a number of these, especially the d'ye/t'ye combinations, are clearly Ford's. The Birth of Merlin , a play in which Rowley's hand is usually said to be the principal one, contains but 16 ye' s. Most significant of all, for the purposes of the present study, is the fact that, as we shall see, ye occurs but 4 times in his share of The Maid in the Mill ; were the form to occur on the scale indicated by A Match at Midnight , there would be no telling Rowley's share of the play from Fletcher's. Rowley's use of such contracted forms as i'th', o'th', h'as , and 's for his has no significance as authorial evidence. There is nothing to distinguish between his use of hath and doth , and the practice of such a dramatist as Middleton. The contracted forms— a'th', sh'as/sh'ad, 'tas/ 'tad, ha' —to which I have drawn attention in the work of Middleton either do not occur in Rowley's unaided plays, or are found there to a negligible degree (there is a single occurrence of 'tas in A Woman Never Vext , and 4 instances of ha' in All's Lost by Lust , not counting the 15 occurrences of the latter form in A Match at Midnight , which are suspect). The most significant feature of Rowley's language practice is one which is not immediately discernible from the table of linguistic evidence for his unaided plays. This involves his use of the contracted pronominal form 'em , and sundry variants thereof. In only one of his unaided plays, A Shoemaker , is there a clear cut distinction between the 'em spelling of the pronominal contraction (which is used 23 times) and the expanded form (used 33 times). In A Woman Never Vext , the form of the contraction that is regularly used is 'm (30 times), as against 45 them 's. 10 In All's Lost there are 17 them' s, whereas the contracted form appears 5 times as 'em , once as 'm , 8 times as 'um . Here the variation of contracted forms seems almost certainly to have been influenced by difference in compositorial practice. The single 'm occurs near the beginning of the play (sig. B2 v ). Thereafter, the form of the contraction that is regularly used (sigs. B3-E4) is 'em . But before the last 'em we have had the first 'um (sig. E3), and that form continues in use through sig. H1 v , the last time that a contracted form of the pronoun appears in the play. Did the matter end here, we would be dealing with nothing more than a compositorial spelling variant of a common enough sort. But there is evidence outside Rowley's unaided plays which proves conclusively that 'um was a form which he employed. Whether he also, on occasion, employed 'm is less certain. I would like to think that he did, because the 30 'm' s of A Woman Never Vext explain what is otherwise inexplicable: the appearance of 2 'm' s—a form that has not previously occurred in the play—near the end of The Maid in the Mill , when the Fletcherian ye' s have abruptly broken off and Rowley's hand is once again discernible (as all students of the play agree) with the entrance of Antonio, Constable, and Officers. But our experience with the occurrence of 'um elsewhere in the plays of the canon has made this much clear: that a dramatist's tendency to use this less familiar form, rather than the more common 'em , is likely to lead to compositorial confusion. We have seen this in Thierry and Theodoret and The Scornful Lady , where 'em and 'um occur together in the same scenes. If Beaumont used the 'um form of the contraction—as the evidence of Philaster, The Scornful Lady , and A King and no King seems to imply—then it came out variously as 'em and 'am (in The Knight of the Burning Pestle and The Woman Hater ), and 'm (in The Maid's Tragedy ). 11 Thus it is not surprising to find Rowley's 'um appearing as 'm —assuming that his preference in the matter was fixed, and he did not occasionally write 'm himself. But the form by which Rowley is known is 'um , and it now remains to demonstrate this. First, 'um is the form that occurs in Rowley's dedicatory letter (sig. A2) "To the Nobly Disposed, Virtuous, and Faithful-Breasted / Robert Grey, Esq." that prefaces the 1617 quarto of A Fair Quarrel . But the real proof lies in the linguistic evidence which this Middleton-Rowley collaboration displays—evidence that provides the key for distinguishing their shares in a play of their joint authorship. A Fair Quarrel — Q 1617 sigs. ye y' 'em 'um 'am them i'th' a'th' o'th' h'as sh'as ha' B-B2 1 4 1 [I,1(a) B2 v -C3 v 2 3 8 1 4 3 1 [I,1(b) C3 v -D3 2 1 2 1 1 2 [II,1 E-E2 v 1 2 1 [II,2 E3-F1 v 4 1 [III,1 F3-F3 v 7 [III,2 F4 v 1 [III,3 G1 v -G4 1 2 1 [IV,1 G4 v -H 4 [IV,2 H2 v -H3 v 2 1 1 1 1 [IV,3 H3 v -I2 v * 15 1 [IV,4 H4-K2 1 2 6 1 [V,1 Here the alteration of 'em and 'um gives us our principal clue to the respective shares of the two dramatists. Middleton's 4 'em' s mark his presence through the opening pages of I,1, to Russell's speech beginning "How now Gallants?" (sig. B2 v ) where we find the first signs of Rowley's presence. With the change of author comes a change in the form of the pronominal contraction that is immediately apparent. One of Rowley's 'um' s has been reproduced as 'am , as it is again in the next scene (II,2) in which his hand is present. But thereafter the compositor would appear to have the spelling under control. I doubt that the appearance of 'em and 'um together in IV,3 is a mistake; both dramatists' work has been traced in the scene. The 15 'um' s of IV,4 confirm what we know, that this, the "roaring" scene added to the second impression of the first quarto, is the work of Rowley. His work is evident throughout the remainder of the play. As for the remainder of Middleton's share: the occurrence of 'em, a'th', sh'as , and ha' together in II,1 points to his linguistic practice. The y' s and ha' s give evidence of his work in Act III. The only scene of the play that offers no shred of linguistic evidence for its authorship is IV,2. For proof that the alternation of 'em/'um in the 1617 quarto of A Fair Quarrel is not the result of mere compositorial caprice, but does in fact point to two distinct linguistic practices, there is the evidence of another Middleton-Rowley collaboration, their Courtly Masque of The World Tost at Tennis , printed in quarto in 1620. The linguistic evidence exhibited in that edition is as follows. The World Tost at Tennis — Q 1620 sigs. ye y' 'em 'um them i'th' a'th' o'th' h'as sh'as 'tas ha' [Ent.Five B2 v -D2 6 1 13 6 3 1 [Starches D2 v -E4 1 7 2 4 * 1 ** 1 2 1 1 1 [Ent.King,etc. E4 v -F2 2 2 2 * F2 v 1 [Last speech Linguistically, the masque breaks into two main divisions, with 'um occurring regularly as the preferential form of the pronominal contraction through sig. D2, after which 'em begins to appear, to recur through most of the remainder. It is pleasant to note that the authorial division thus indicated by the linguistic evidence accords exactly with the division agreed to on the basis of verse tests by all those who have examined the Middleton-Rowley collaborations. Miss Wiggin, Stork, and Robb 12 are at one in attributing to Rowley everything from the beginning of the Induction to the entrance of the Five Starches. The Starches enter near the bottom of sig. D2; the last of the 13 'um' s in this first division of the play occurs at the end of the stage direction which brings them on (". . . White-Starch challenging precedency, standing vpon her right by Antiquity, out of her iust anger presents their pride to vm."). About what follows, the students of Middleton and Rowley are not of one accord. Miss Wiggin would assign to Middleton everything from the entrance of the Starches to the end of the masque. Stork and Robb would exclude from this the prose speeches of Simplicity, which they attribute to Rowley. Without going into the details of the matter, which do not concern us here, it is sufficient for our purposes to note that all the linguistic evidence for Middleton's work is quite clearly confined to the second half of the masque. The one possible exception is the characteristically Middleton ath' which occurs (sig. B4 v ) in Rowley's share. But the evidence to be derived from the occurrence of the a'th'/o'th' contraction in the text is confusing at best; it occurs three times, and each time it is differently spelled; in addition to the ath' in Rowley's share of the masque, there are an oth' (sig. E1) and an a the (sig. E3) in Middleton's. The i'th'/i'the variants evident in the text may point to a kindred compositorial indecision. But the 7 'em' s, and the use, for the first time in the text, of the contractions sh'as, 'tas , and ha' , are evidence for Middleton's presence through sigs. D2 v -E4. I detect the return of Rowley with the stage direction "Enter King, a Lawyer, and Deceit as a Pettifogger," at the bottom of sig. E4. The 2 'um' s in the Lawyer's speech beginning "I grant my Pils are bitter," on sig. E4 v , together with the evidence of the verse, point in his direction. But Middleton has returned by the end of the masque, as all the commentators agree; and the 'tas in the final line (sig. F2 v ) provides us with a trace, however faint, of his linguistic presence. 13 Still further evidence that the respective shares of Middleton and Rowley can be distinguished, in a general way at least, in a play of their joint authorship by the occurrence of 'em/'um is available in the 1653 quarto text of The Changeling , as the following table shows. The Changeling — Q 1653 sigs. ye y' 'em 'um them i'th' o'th' ha' B-B4 1 3 1 2 1 2 1 [I,1 C-C3 1 1 3 1 [I,2 C4-D 2 2 1 1 [II,1 D-D3 2 7 3 [II,2 D3 v 1 [III,2 D4-E3 v 4 2 2 1 1 [III,3 E4-F1 v 4 1 1 [III,4 F2-F3 1 2 2 [IV,1 F4 2 [IV,2(a) F4-G1 v 1 2 1 [IV,2(b) G2 v -G4 v 1 7 4 1 [IV,3 H-H2 3 2 1 3 [V,1 H3-H4 1 4 [V,2 H4 v -I3 1 1 2 1 [V,3 Here, as elsewhere, Rowley's 'um first appears as 'em (sig. B1 v ). 'Em and 'um appear together on sig. C3. But thereafter throughout Act I, which all students of the play agree is Rowley's, the pronominal form is 'um. 'Em , on the other hand, is the form that prevails throughout Act II, and this, by general scholarly assent, is Middleton's. Neither them , or a contraction thereof, occurs in the brief III,1 and 2. In Rowley's III,3, the form of the contraction varies in a manner that is familiar; it first appears as 'em (sig. D4 v ), then as 'um (sig. E1), again as 'em (sig. E2), finally as 'um as (sig. E2 v ). Middleton's III,4 displays a single occurrence of 'em ; his IV,1, two occurrences of the form. The extent to which this particular piece of linguistic evidence can point to two distinct authorial practices when it has been faithfully preserved in the printed text is shown in IV,2. Miss Wiggin, Robb, and Stork concur in giving the entire scene to Middleton, but the linguistic evidence displayed here makes possible a more precise attribution. Rowley opens the scene with the first five speeches that comprise the exchange between Vermandero and the servant; and 'um occurs twice in Vermandero's speech beginning "The time accuses 'um" (sig. F4). But immediately thereafter, with the entrance of Tomazo, Middleton's hand appears, and the Vermandero who has said 'um a few lines earlier now says 'em on the same quarto signature. The play's most striking cluster of 'um' s (7 in all) occurs in IV,3, and this, one of the scenes in Alibius' madhouse, is acknowledgedly Rowley's. 'Em is the preferential form of the contraction throughout Middleton's V,1-2. The single occurrence of a contraction for them appears as 'em in Rowley's V,3. The evidence of the contraction ha' tends to corroborate the evidence of 'em/'um ; of the 12 occurrences of ha' in the play, 10 appear in Middleton scenes. There is no trace in the quarto text of the Middleton contraction a'th' . The remaining one of Middleton and Rowley's acknowledged collaborations, The Spanish Gipsy , like The Changeling , was printed in 1653, but the quarto text in which it survives displays none of the linguistic features that serve to distinguish their work in collaboration —a fact that may support the view that the play has been revised by Ford. We have seen how the more distinctive features of Middleton's language practices are absent from his work that was not printed until the mid-seventeenth century; and, with the notable exception of The Changeling , this tends to be true as well for such of Rowley's work as was first printed at this period. As no 'um' s are to be found in the 1653 quarto of The Spanish Gipsy , neither does the form appear in Fortune by Land and Sea (Q 1655), The Old Law (Q 1656), A Cure for a Cuckold (Q 1661), The Birth of Merlin (Q 1661). But the single occurrence of 'um in the 1658 quarto of The Witch of Edmonton occurs (sig. H3 v ) in a speech of Young Banks, the Clown, and it is generally acknowledged that Cuddy Banks is entirely Rowley's creation. Having shown the extent to which, on the evidence of linguistic criteria, the respective shares of Middleton and Rowley can be distinguished in their acknowledged collaborations, we return to the Beaumont and Fletcher canon, and the comedy of Wit at Several Weapons . Wit at Several Weapons Middleton: I,1; II,1; III; IV. Rowley: I,2; II,2-4; V. Since the time of Fleay, Middleton and Rowley's names have been associated with this play. The comic intrigue, with its premium on trickery not alone sedulously practiced but actively encouraged, has obvious affinities with the pattern of the action in Middleton's city comedies; and the Clown Pompey Doodle, a role that Rowley doubtless acted, has seemed to many Rowley's creation: "own brother" in the words of Robb, (p. 138) "to Cuddy Banks and Bustopha [in The Maid in the Mill ]." But one wants grounds more relative than this in attributing Wit at Several Weapons to Middleton and Rowley, and in the linguistic pattern which the text of the play in the 1647 folio affords, I think it is available. The pattern is by no means perfectly preserved, but the traces of it that persist are enough to make it clear that it is identical with the pattern we have found to exist in the quarto texts of A Fair Quarrel, The World Tost at Tennis , and The Changeling . Here, as in the acknowledged Middleton-Rowley collaborations, the pattern consists in fact of two alternating ones: that of Middleton being distinguished by an occasional occurrence of a'th' and the steady appearance of the contraction ha' , while the pattern of Rowley is again marked by the here sporadic but significant appearance of 'um . In his portion of the play, Rowley used a contraction for them 24 times. This has been reproduced as 'um on 7 occasions which are distributed over three scenes (II,2; V,1-2). On the evidence set forth above, I submit that 'um is the form that Rowley used, and that its occurrence in the 1647 folio text of Wit at Several Weapons can therefore serve as evidence for determining his share in the authorship of the play. Here there is no question of the 'um contraction representing a compositorial spelling variant. 'Em and 'um occur together in each of the three scenes designated above; often they occur together in the same folio column (as at 72b, 73a, 89a). And it is important to note that 'um appears in no scenes but Rowley's; it is never found in scenes where either the Middleton a'th' or ha' contractions appear. Five instances of Middleton's a'th' have been preserved; since there are no occurrences of o'th' , this would appear to be all of them, unless of course the a'th' spelling is held to be compositorial. But this seems unlikely, if for no other reason than that the precise form of the contraction is so various: it is found as a the in column 69b, just as it is on sig. E3 of Middleton's share of The World Tost at Tennis (above, p. 86); elsewhere in the text it appears as a'th (twice, 84a), and a'the (84a, 86a). The i'th/i'the variant that is evident in the text may point here, as in The World Tost at Tennis , to a similar compositorial indecision. The play's single occurrence of h'ad appears in Middleton's I,1; of sh'as and sh'ad in his III,1. In view of Middleton's pronounced use of contractions in y' in his unaided plays, it is not surprising that all 7 occurrences of such contractions here are found in scenes which bear other evidence (either ha' or a'th' or both) of his authorship. Finally, there is the evidence of the interjections, push (or puh , or pish ) and tush . Of these, Miss Wiggin (p. 38) notes that Middleton's favorite exclamation is Push! or Pish! while Rowley regularly used Tush! Robb (p. 133) comments that, while this "appears trivial grounds for discriminating between two men as author of a scene; nevertheless what [Miss Wiggin] says is true, and in conjunction with other evidence it is a perfectly sound basis of distinction." The fact is, Middleton's favorite exclamation appears almost as often in the form puh as it does as either push or pish . For instance, in A Trick to Catch the Old One , there are 4 occurrences of push , 3 of puh ; in A Mad World, push 6 times, puh 10 times, pish once; in Michaelmas Term, push 3 times, puh 4 times, pish once; in The Phoenix, puh twice; in A Chaste Maid in Cheapside, push once, pish 3 times; in More Dissemblers Besides Women, pish twice. I note but a single occurrence of tush in Middleton (in A Chaste Maid ). In Rowley's All's Lost by Lust , on the other hand, tush appears 13 times; in A Shoemaker A Gentleman , 3 times. These preferences are reflected, though not exactly, in the two shares of Wit at Several Weapons . For the single occurrence of puh in Rowley's V,1, there are two in Middleton's I,1. The single occurrence of pish in Rowley's V,2 and the single occurrence of push in Middleton's III,1 might be said to cancel each other out; but at least the play's 6 occurrences of tush appear in Rowley scenes. The play is unique among those in the Beaumont and Fletcher canon for the great number of phrases employing a , the weakened form of the o' contraction for on and of . I have already drawn attention to this as a characteristic feature of Middleton's linguistic practice, and I cite the following examples of such phrases from Wit at Several Weapons as further evidence for his presence here: "Would a' my life" (III,1; 79a); "bang'd a' both sides" (III,1; 80a); "take heed a that" (III,1; 80a) "few men dye a beating" (III,1; 80b); "beaten a both sides" (III,1; 80b); "could a yeelded" (III,1; 80b); "take it off a my finger" (III,1; 81b); "Sessions a Thursday, / Jury cul'd out a Friday, Judgment a Saturday, / Dungeon a Sunday, Tyburne a Munday" (IV,1; 82a); "a man a' wit" (IV,1; 82a); "spite a your teeth" (IV,1; 82b); "think . . . / A' your poch't Scholler" (IV,1; 83a); "modesty a top of all your vertues" (IV,1; 83b); "A my troth" (IV,1; 83b); "out a' your wits" (IV,1; 83b); "for your cast a manchits out a'th Pantry, / Ile allow you a Goose out a'th Kitchin" (IV.1; 84a); "I ha' / kept out a Towne these two daies, a purpose" (IV,1 85a); "Oh that whores hat a' thine, a' the riding block" (IV,3; 86a). A few points regarding the vocabulary of Middleton's scenes are worth noting. Sir Gregory's query in III,1 (81a), "Is Pompey growne so malepert? so frampell?" employs a word ("frampold") that occurs as well in the Inner Temple Masque ("frampole", sig. A3 v ), and in what, according to Bullen (I, xxxv), is a Middleton scene (III,1) of The Roaring Girl ("phrampell", sig. E3 v ). There is a reference at IV,1 (82a) to the Polychronicon , mentioned in the Prologue to Hengist, King of Kent by its author, Raynulph of Chester, who serves as the presenter of that play. The Neece's lines at IV,2 (85a): "After I have pelted you sufficiently, / I tro you will learne more manners," employs a verbal particle, the obsolete "tro" for "trow", that Middleton uses often (e.g., A Trick , II,1; A Game at Chess , II,1; Hengist , V,1; Women Beware Women , III,2; No Wit, No Help , I,3). The fact that the form occurs again in Rowley's V,2 (90a), within six lines of the pish that is found in that scene, may point to Middleton's presence at this point. Robb (p. 137) notes that "there is a good deal of composite writing in the play, scenes in the main by Rowley showing also signs of Middleton, and vice versa." Thus, in designating any given scene as the work of one or the other dramatist, it will be understood that I imply nothing more than that, in the scene in question, that dramatist's hand is the dominant one. A word should be said regarding the possibility of Fletcher's presence in the play. I agree with Oliphant ( The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher , p. 454) that such a pair of lines as these from V,1 (87b) have a decidedly Fletcherian ring: "Upon my life the Knight will love you for't, / Exceedingly love you, for ever love you." And when, later in the same scene (89a), Witty-Pate says to his father: "You were not wont to slubber a project so," it is necessary to remind oneself that the mere appearance of a word with which a known author regularly signs his style is not an infallible warrant of his presence, so inured am I to Fletcher's use of "slubber" (e.g., in The Mad Lover , V,3; The Wild Goose Chase , II,2; Rule a Wife , IV,1; Monsieur Thomas , IV,1; Wit Without Money , I,1; Cupid's Revenge , II,3; The Custom of the Country , I,2; The Spanish Curate , II,2). The Epilogue subjoined to the first folio text was spoken at the play's revival; with its anxious assurance that a little of Fletcher counts for much, it seems clearly to imply that his share in the authorship was never more than partial (Beaumont is not mentioned): 'Twould be but labour lost for to excuse What Fletcher had to do in; his brisk Muse Was so Mercuriall, that if he but writ An Act, or two, the whole Play rise up wit. It may be that what we are dealing with in the extant text is a Middleton-Rowley revision, undertaken when the play was revived, of an original by Fletcher and one or more unknown dramatists. But to seek to identify and apportion the shares of the original dramatists in a play that has been as extensively revised as this one (if there is a question of revision) seems gratuitous. Among other things, it raises the nice question: at what point does a revised play cease to be the play that was originally written and become a different play? Is the ship of Delos, after its every spar and plank have been replaced with new ones, the same ship or another? The only conclusions we can reach concerning the authorship of Wit at Several Weapons must be based on its only extant text, and the extant text represents, in all essential respects, the work of Middleton and Rowley. The Nice Valour Fletcher and Middleton: I,1; II,1; IV,1; V,2-3. Middleton: III; V,1. Oliphant (pp. 449-450), after making a complicated division of The Nice Valour between Beaumont, Fletcher, and Middleton, concludes: "As it stands, the play is almost entirely Middleton's." I believe this is right, but it is hard to establish Middleton's claim to the play on the basis of linguistic evidence alone. There is only one linguistic feature of the extant text that points strongly in his direction, and that is the steady occurrence of ha' throughout the whole of the play, to the total of 23 times. This is the greatest number of times that ha' is to be found in any play of the canon, and is approached only by the 21 instances of the contraction that Beaumont brought to Love's Pilgrimage . The 18 contractions in y' , together with the infrequent use that is made of ye , which appears but a scant 2 times, accord well with the practice revealed in Middleton's unaided plays. There are 'em 's in abundance (29 in all), and this agrees well too with Middletonian practice, but avails nothing in establishing his claims to the authorship over those of such other dramatists as Beaumont or Fletcher. There are 11 occurrences of contractions in o'th'/o'the , but none in a'th' . But 'tas is found twice, and there are single occurrences of 'tad and h'ad . Evidence of a sort might be derived from the interjections used in the play, which as so often in Middleton, appear in a variety of forms: here, in single occurrences, are found pish, puh, pah , and pha . It can be fairly said that the pattern of linguistic evidence found in The Nice Valour is no more uncharacteristic of Middleton than is that found in several of his undoubted plays (e.g., A Chaste Maid, Women Beware Women ), and rather more typical of his established practices than the pattern found in certain others (e.g., The Witch, Hengist ). But in the absence of any external evidence linking the play with Middleton, the linguistic evidence is not strong enough in itself to prove the play his, and one turns perforce to such internal evidence as is supplied by the play's thematic material and the treatment thereof. The question of authorship is here bound up with the unsatisfactory state of the extant text. Oliphant (p. 441) pointed out that The Nice Valour is the shortest play in the canon, and he enumerated some of the dislocations in the action that have resulted from abridgement. But whether the play as we have it has not only been abridged but has also been revised is by no means clear. The Prologue speaks of a revival, and this, together with the alternate title, The Passionate Mad Man , that the folio supplies, has generally been taken as evidence for revision. Since, however, Professor Baldwin Maxwell has shown 14 that the reference to Fisher's Folly (V,3) is an allusion, not to the pamphlet published in 1624, but to Jasper Fisher's London mansion, erected during the reign of Elizabeth, one of the chief reasons why, in Oliphant's words (p. 444), "the play is not to be looked upon as of a single date," has disappeared. Professor Maxwell gives evidence for dating The Nice Valour c. 1615/1616, and it is with Middleton's work at this period that the play has its closest affinities. Shamont's idealization of the Duke's sister, in The Nice Valour , is reminiscent of the Lord Cardinal's exaggerated regard for the widowed Duchess of Milan's vow of constancy, in More Dissemblers Besides Women ; "her goodnesse is my pride," says Shamont of the Lady (II,1); "I make her constancy / The holy mistress of my contemplation," says the Cardinal of the Duchess (I,2). When Shamont overhears his brother conversing with the Lady, he denounces him for the sacrilege: "Has Honour so few daughters, never fewer, / And must thou aime thy treacherie at the best?" (IV,1). When the Duchess confesses to the Cardinal that she has come, after seven years, to love again, his first wrath is directed against the lover who has tempted her: "better the man / Had never known creation, than to live / Th' unlucky ruin of so fair a temple" (II,1). Over the whole of The Nice Valour is an air of noble gravity, as in the speeches about virtue as the true nobility ("it is not in the power of Monarches / To make a Gentleman, which is a substance / Only begot of merit" [I,1]; "I cannot make you gentlemen, that's a work / Rais'd from your owne deservings; merit, manners, / And inborne vertue doe's it" [V,3]), and in Shamont's high-minded regard for the dignity of man ("How faine would I preserve mans forme from shame, / And cannot get it done?" [I,1]; "It afflicts me / When I behold unseemelinesse in an Image / So neare the Godhead, 'tis an injurie / To glorious Eternity" [I,1]). The reflective quality of these utterances is similar in kind to the detached sobriety that sets apart certain of the speeches in The Old Law; More Dissemblers; No Wit, No Help ; and The Witch . But there is as well a note of grotesquerie in The Nice Valour that is also prevalent in the plays of what I suppose is to be termed Middleton's middle period. 15 In The Nice Valour this is to be principally found in the scenes concerning the Passionate Madman and his mistress who follows him through the period of his madness disguised as Cupid. As has been often noted, this sub-plot parallels closely the sub-plot of Beaumont's The Noble Gentleman , where the Lady solicitously follows the mad Shatillion, whose wit has been "turn'd . . . wild" by her "coy deniall" of his favors. I entirely agree with Professor Baldwin Maxwell (p. 161) that the scenes in The Noble Gentleman "dealing with the mad Shatillion and the faithful Lady who attends him are so much better conceived and so much more convincingly executed than the scenes of the Passionate Madman and his lady (Cupid) in The Nice Valour that one can hardly question that the Passionate Madman is an imitation or hardly believe that the same author conceived both situations." The Cupid of The Nice Valour , unlike the Lady of The Noble Gentleman , is pregnant, and this, as much as anything else, accounts for the very different tone that characterizes the proceedings here. The Cupid is accompanied by her two brothers who, concerned for her shame, are anxious to have her married, lest she "be a mother before shee's known a Bride" (V,1). The efforts to bring the Passionate Madman to his senses thus take on a particular urgency; he must acknowledge the lady as his wife, and quickly (a marriage ceremony has already been performed). The very dubious humor of the sub-plot consists, then, in a literal race against time ("Her shame growes big, brother; / The Cupids shape will hardly hold it longer," says one to another [V,1]). This, I am afraid, is rather too typical of the lower reaches of Middleton's humor in the plays of this middle period. The Cupid here can join the ranks of other Middleton ladies who bid fair to be mothers before they're known brides: Francisca in The Witch , Lactantio's mistress in More Dissemblers Besides Women , Philip Twilight's wife, whom he has unwisely passed off as his sister, in No Wit, No Help . There is no more grotesque scene in Middleton than the one in More Dissemblers where Lactantio's mistress, disguised as a page, is forced to take a dancing lesson in an advanced state of pregnancy. It is grotesque in the way that "the Dance of the old women, maskt" in IV,1 of The Old Law is grotesque; and the masque-like scenes wherein the pregnant Cupid dances in The Nice Valour have precisely the same grotesquerie. She enters "like a Cupid offring to shoot at [the Passionate Madman]" (II,1), just as the Cupids literally shoot at Hippolito in the masque at the end of Women Beware Women . And The Nice Valour is even furnished with a kind of antimasque when the cowardly courtier Lapet enters (V,1) with the Clown "and foure other like fooles, dancing, the Cupid leading." She is bearing the "Table" that accompanies Lapet's newly published book, "The uprising of the kick and the downfall of the Duello." The Table sets forth "all your Blowes, and Blow-men whatsoever, / in their lively colours, givers, and takers," and the Cupid holds it up to Lapet "at every strain, . . . acting the postures." Lapet reads from it as the seven strains follow, a blow for each strain ("Twinge all now," "Sowse upon Souse," "Douses single," "Justle sides," and so on). It is all very like the second antimasque of The Inner Temple Masque , where Dr. Almanac reads from his catalogue of days—good, bad, and indifferent ("here's Cock -a-hoop, This The gear cottons , and this Faint heart never ;" etc.) a scene which itself has a parallel in III,1 of No Wit, No Help , where Weatherwise reads from his almanac ("Fifth day, neither fish nor flesh," "Sixth day, privily prevented," "Seventh day, shrunk in the wetting," and so on to the twelfth). This same Weatherwise is the subject of a passage, the phrasing of which may have its parallel in The Nice Valour . In I,1 of No Wit, No Help , the servant Savourwit says to his master: "Betwixt your son and master Sunset's daughter / The line goes even, . . . / But, sir, there's no proportion, height, or evenness / Betwixt that equinoctial and your daughter." The equinox and the even line appear in the fourth gentleman's account of the ideal courtier in I,1 of The Nice Valour : "Give me a man . . . / Can play at Equinoctium with the Line, / As even as the thirteenth of September." The possibility of Fletcher's share in The Nice Valour should be raised. Certainly there are individual lines in the play that have a Fletcherian ring: "Has a good stroake at Tennis, and a stiffe one" (I,1); "Which makes an excellent husband, and a fond one" (II,1); "This is my feares construction, and a deep one" (IV,1); "that's my suit, / To part from Court for ever, my last suit. / And as you profess bounty, grant me that, Sir" (IV,1); "The chusing of these fellowes now will puzzle me, / Horribly puzzle me" (IV,1); "This is a brave Coward, / A jolly threatening Coward" (IV,1); "To performe one good office, nay a deare one" (V,2); "Beare witnesse heaven, this man destroyes his brother / When he may save him, his least breath may save him" (V,2); "It brings me hither still; by maine force hither" (V,3). The structure of the first three of these lines is especially typical of Fletcher (cf. e.g., "a close ward, and a sure one" [ The Loyal Subject, III,2]; "she is a right good Princes, and a just one" [ Women Pleased, I,1]; "This is a new way of begging, and a neat one" [ The Pilgrim, I,2]; "I long to be a Husband, and a good one" [ Rule a Wife, I,1]; cf. also below, p. 101). But these lines are embedded in a text that, taken as a whole, is not Fletcher's. Whether or not it is Middleton's is beyond final proof. I think that it is; and so I have designated as his all those scenes which reveal no traces of Fletcher. Scenes which display seemingly Fletcherian lines in a non-Fletcherian context I have designated as the work of both dramatists. Beyond this, it seems unwise to attempt any differentiation in the shares of the two authors, just as it seems unwise to speculate how it was that Middleton came to be associated with Fletcher in a single play, whether as reviser or collaborator. However it was, Middleton's hand in the extant text is decidedly the predominant one; and the play as we have it in every way bears his stamp. The most telling argument in favor of this is that The Nice Valour, which is surely one of the oddities of the Beaumont and Fletcher canon, with its anomalous mixture of elements satiric and romantic, makes most sense when it is viewed by the light of the tragi-comedies Middleton was writing during the second decade of the seventeenth century—the decade from which, in its extant state at least, The Nice Valour apparently dates. The Maid in the Mill Fletcher: I; III, 2-3; V,2a (to entrance of Antonio). Rowley: II; III,1; IV; V,1,2b (from entrance of Antonio to end). In his Office-Book under date of 29 August 1623, Herbert records the licensing of "a new Comedy, Called, The Maid in the Mill ; written by Fletcher, and Rowley" ( Herbert, p. 25), and the attribution has never been challenged. Linguistically, the play can be divided into two readily distinguishable parts. The share of Fletcher contains 175 ye 's. In the share attributed to Rowley, the form occurs but 4 times. The Fletcherian portion displays the usual preference for 'em (used 20 times) to them (4 times); and the occurrence of the contractions i'th' (9 times), o'th' (8 times), h'as (3 times), 's for his (twice) is typical. Hath and doth do not occur. It is the greatly reduced occurrence of ye that serves most clearly to distinguish Rowley's share of the play from Fletcher's. The fact that hath is found 6 times in the Rowley portion affords another contrasting feature in the shares of the two dramatists. Attention has been drawn (above, p. 84) to the two occurrences of 'm for them in Rowley's share of V,2—a contraction that appears 30 times in his A Woman Never Vext, and once in his All's Lost by Lust . The 1647 folio text of the play appears to derive from a manuscript prepared by the scribe Ralph Crane. Evidence of this is afforded by the preservation of the Fletcherian ye, by the division of the text into scenes, and by the use of parentheses for enclosing proper names or forms of address in the vocative. Examples of this last practice can quite literally be found on every page of the first folio text. A few illustrations will suffice: "I have done (sweet Lady)" [1b]; "am I not able (Cosen)" [3b]; "Well (my Lord)" [5b]; "You had the better luck (Sister)" [6a]; "no more (sweet Beauty)" [9a]; "no grace (Gentlemen?)" [12a]; "I hear you (Sir)" [16a]; "pardon (my Soveraigne)" [21b]. The Laws of Candy Ford: I-V. Oliphant (pp. 476 ff.), following the lead of Mr. William Wells, attributed almost the whole of The Laws of Candy to Ford, reserving only the concluding dialogue of I,2 as Fletcher's. Certainly there is nothing in the play of Beaumont's or Massinger's, whose names have been associated with it; and I find nothing particularly Fletcherian about the end of I,2. On the other hand, the play has a number of affinities with Ford's unaided work, and in the state of our present knowledge, it seems best to regard The Laws of Candy as wholly his. Not the least of the resemblances which exist between this play and Ford's seven acknowledged ones is the linguistic pattern which, it is not too much to say, they share in common. Linguistic evidence for his unaided plays is given in tabular form at the end of this section of the present study. From there it will be seen that his use of ye varies from the 11 occurrences of the form in The Broken Heart and 'Tis Pity She's a Whore , to the 65 ye' s of The Fancies Chaste and Noble ; The Laws of Candy contains 37. Hath occurs in Ford from 22 times (in Love's Sacrifice ) to 45 times (in 'Tis Pity ); it is found 39 times in The Laws of Candy. Doth occurs 9 times in The Laws of Candy , just as it does in Love's Sacrifice and The Lover's Melancholy ; the 10 instances of 'em here match the 10 occurrences of the form in The Lady's Trial. I'th' occurs no more than 5 times in a single play of Ford's; it occurs twice in two plays, and not at all in one; it is used a single time in The Laws of Candy. O'th' does not appear in this play, as it does not appear in 'Tis Pity. H'as , which is used once in The Laws of Candy , appears but a single time in three of Ford's unaided plays, and not at all in the remaining four. Ford employs contractions in 's for his no more than 4 times in a single play, and not at all in four plays; none are used in The Laws of Candy . Whatever is to be said about the value of the linguistic evidence here, it cannot be denied that the pattern of language usage displayed by The Laws of Candy accords at every point with the pattern of similar forms displayed by Ford's acknowledged work. The pattern would be complete, and the evidence would be wellnigh conclusive, if The Laws of Candy displayed any of the contractions in 'ee ( d'ee, t'ee , and the like) that are found in all of Ford's acknowledged plays, but none appears here. A feature of Ford's rhetoric is his use of the phrases "for instance" and "in a word" to effect a transition within, or to summarize the import of, one of his long verse cadences. The following from The Broken Heart (I,2) is typical. My speech hath other end; not to attribute All praise to one man's fortune, which is strengthened By many hands: for instance, here is Prophilus, A gentleman—I cannot flatter truth— Of much desert; and, though in other rank, Both Hemophil and Groneas were not missing To wish their country's peace; for, in a word, All there did strive their best, and 'twas our duty. Both phrases are employed in The Laws of Candy : I gave life To quicken courage, to inflame revenge, To heighten resolution; in a word To out-doe action: (I,2) This gentleman, (as humble as you see him) Is even this Kingdomes treasure; In a word, 'Tis his chiefe glory that he is not wiser Then honest, (III,1) Then in a word, my Lord, your visitations Shall find all due respect: (III,2) Loves courtship is familiar, and for instance, See what a change it hath begot in me . . . . (IV,1) There is a tendency in the play for the characters to punctuate their speech with multiple auxiliary verbs. Thus the heroine, when asked by a rejected suitor if it is indeed possible that she should combine such beauty with such cruelty, is made to reply: "I can, I doe, I will" (II,1). This represents the practice in its baldest form; elsewhere it can serve as the basis for a more elaborate statement, as here: the service that he ought to owe, Must, and does owe to you, his friends, and countrey. (II,1) With this it is worth comparing the following, from Ford's The Fancies Chaste and Noble (IV,1): Trust me, I must not, will not, dare not; surely I cannot for my promise past; or this, from The Lover's Melancholy (III,1): you never can be mine, Must not, (and pardon though I say) you shall not; or finally this, from The Lady's Trial (III,1): oh't cannot be, must not, and shanot. And the tendency, also evident in The Laws of Candy , to ring a some-what similar set of changes on the degrees of comparison, has its parallel in Ford as well. Such a passage as this from The Laws of Candy (III,1), The policy was little, the love lesse, And honesty least of all, seems cast in the same verbal mould as this, from The Lover's Melancholy (III,1): to question The least part of your bounties, or that freedome Which Heauen hath with a plenty made you rich in, Would argue me vnciuell, which is more, Base-bred, and which is most of all, vnthankefull. Ford's fondness for directing his characters to bring properties onto the stage is worth noting in connection with the following stage direction from The Laws of Candy (III,3): "Enter Hyparcha (placing two chaires)." In The Broken Heart occurs this stage direction (IV,1; sig. I2): Enter Christalla and Philema, bringing in Penthea in a chaire vaild: two other seruants placing two chaires, one on the one side, and the other with an Engine on the other. And in Love's Sacrifice is found this (II,1; sig. E3 v ): Enter Colona with lights, Biancha, Fiormanda, Iulia, Fernando, and D'auolos; Colona placeth the lights on a Table, and sets downe a Chesse-board. The Fair Maid of the Inn Fletcher and Ford: IV,1. Ford: III. Massinger: I; V,3a (to entrance of the Host). Webster: II; IV,2; V,1-2, 3b (from entrance of the Host to end). Massinger's share in the play has been recognized since the time of Boyle. Ford's presence was first suggested by Wells, Webster's by Sykes. The latter's division of the play is accepted by F. L. Lucas, who includes The Fair Maid of the Inn in volume four of his edition of Webster. Here it remains simply to show the extent to which the linguistic evidence corroborates the shares that have been claimed for Massinger, Webster, and Ford, and to draw attention to such evidence as exists for the presence of Fletcher. Three distinct linguistic patterns are discernible in the 1647 folio text of the play. The first of these, evident through Act I and the first 297 lines of V,3, displays no ye' s, no such contracted forms as i'th' , o'th' , or 's for his , and but single occurrences (in I,3) of h'as and 'em . The second pattern, to be traced through Act II, the second scene of Act IV, the first two scenes and the last 38 lines of the final scene of Act V, displays but a single ye , a decided preference for the expanded them to the contracted 'em (32 occurrences of them as against 8 of 'em in this section of the play), and all the occurrences of i'th', o'th' , and 's for his that the play affords. The third pattern, which extends from III,1 through IV,1, displays an occasional ye and an occasional 'em (7 of each), and 7 occurrences of contractions in 'ee ( d'ee and t'ee ), forms that are found no where else in the play. 16 The first pattern, barren as it is of ye and of all the normal contractions, is recognizably Massinger's. Pattern number two, with its paucity of ye 's and 'em 's, and its concentration of forms in i'th' , o'th' , and 's for his , displays the very qualities that, in an earlier section of the present study ( SB , XII, 103-104) were noted in the linguistic pattern that emerged from an examination of the unaided plays of Webster. There it was found that ye occurs no more than twice in any one of Webster's three unaided plays; that 'em appears but thrice in a single play, and not at all in the remaining two; but that in a single play i'th' , on the other hand, will occur from 31 to 46 times, o'th' (with the variant form a'th' , which Webster also employs) from 19 to 22 times, and contractions in 's for his from 15 to 20 times. Webster employs i'th' , o'th' , and 's for his more frequently even than Fletcher does, and his practice has left its mark on his share of The Fair Maid of the Inn . The most significant single feature of pattern number three is the appearance of the contractions in 'ee , and these, as the linguistic table at the end of this section of the present study shows, are to be found in each of Ford's seven unaided plays. The infrequent use of ye and 'em in pattern three, and the absence from it of i'th' , o'th' , and 's for his , accord further with the pattern of linguistic usage established by Ford's unaided work. Although the play, as it stands, is substantially the work of Massinger, Webster, and Ford, there is, I think, no doubt that traces of Fletcher are to be discerned in at least one scene (IV,1). No line could be more typically Fletcherian than Bianca's "Ile pray for yee / That you may have a vertuous wife, a faire one," with its schematic pattern of article-adjective-noun-article-a second adjective-"one," a recurrent rhetorical formula in Fletcher's unaided work (cf. e.g., "A dainty Wench, a right one," [ Monsieur Thomas , I,1]; "a pretty Ring, a right one" [ The Pilgrim , III,4]; "a Turkish man of War, a stout one" [ A Wife for a Month , V,1]). As this accounts for one of the scene's 4 ye 's, the following passage, also possessed of a Fletcherian ring, accounts for another: Call to minde Sir. How much you have abated of that goodnesse Which once raign'd in ye, they appear'd so lovely That such as freindship led to observation Courted the great example. The "they" (line 3) of both folios is usually emended: to "which" by Seward, "nay" by Dyce, "yea" by Lucas. The latter, in his note on the passage, suggests that "the confusion may be due to two alternative versions— Those virtues . . . they appear'd and that goodnesse . . . which should have been followed not by they , but it " ( The Works of John Webster , IV,236). It is possible that we are in the very presence of a passage that has been worked over by the revising hand of Ford (the verb "abates" occurs in his III,1). The play was licensed by Herbert on 22 January 1626 as the work of Fletcher alone ( Herbert , p. 31). Lucas adduces evidence for dating it subsequent to 27 March 1625. Fletcher died in August of that year. Oliphant (p. 471), struck by the smallness of Fletcher's contribution, saw in the play an early Fletcherian original revised by one or more unknowns in 1625 and at least once thereafter; he detected the presence of Webster, Massinger, and Ford, but being unable to find a period at which all three were writing for the King's Company, to which the play belonged, was unwilling to regard the play as of a single date. Fletcher's share in the play is much too small to admit of any judgments as to whether the work is early or late. There being no evidence to the contrary, I would suggest that the work is late—that it is, indeed, the last play on which Fletcher worked; that his share in it was never brought to completion; that it was finished by the trio of Webster, Massinger, and Ford. Massinger may have been present from the beginning, as perhaps was Webster; Ford, to judge from the evidence of IV,1, where he is overwriting Fletcher, was not. Whether all three were writing for the King's Company at this time we have no way of knowing. Massinger was; his Roman Actor was licensed for that company later in the same year as The Fair Maid (11 October 1626). There is nothing inherently impossible in supposing that Webster and Ford were too; and to do so involves us in less of a quagmire of speculation than to posit several layers of revision in order to account for their presence in the play. I have not credited Ford with a share in Webster's II,1 of The Fair Maid , there being no linguistic evidence for doing so; but the fact that one passage therein echoes fairly closely a passage of similar import from III,2 of The Laws of Candy raises the possibility, given Ford's connection with both plays, that his work is present in that scene as well as in those that I have indicated. At one point in each play, a young man is sent to effect a reconciliation with an irascible older man who refuses to be placated, and in his wrath comes near to killing, or maiming, the emissary. In each case he desists from the same consideration of hospitable behavior, but not before he has made the emissary aware of his danger. Here is the pertinent speech from The Laws of Candy (III,2): Rash young man, But that thou art under my owne roofe, and know'st I dare not any way infringe the Lawes Of hospitality, thou should'st repent Thy bold and rude intrusion. And this is the comparable passage from The Fair Maid of the Inn (II,1): rash young man, Thou tak'st me in an ill Planet, and hast cause To curse thy Father; for I doe protest, If I had met thee in any part o'th world, But under my own roofe, I would have killd thee. Unless we have here a case of direct borrowing, I find it hard to believe that two such essentially colorless passages, completely lacking in imagery that could give them a common source, could so nearly reproduce each other if they were not the work of a single dramatist.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 C. H. Herford, Percy and Evelyn Simpson, Ben Jonson (1950), X, 340. 2 F. G. Fleay first noted Shirley's connection with the play in his "Annals of the Careers of James and Henry Shirley," Anglia , VIII (1885), 408. Cf. A. H. Bullen, Works of Thomas Middleton (1885), I, xl and IV, 374; and Allan H. Stevenson, "Shirley's Years in Ireland," RES , XX (1944), 19. 3 In the unaided plays of Fletcher, a'th' is found 17 times (twice in The Mad Lover , once in The Island Princess , 10 times in the Lambarde Manuscript of The Woman's Prize , where the form would seem to be scribal, since it does not occur in the folio text of the play, even as the 4 appearances of the form in Knight's transcript of Bonduca have no equivalent in the folio). A'th' does not occur in any of the unaided plays of Massinger. It is found in none of the Fletcher-Massinger collaborations. In the plays connected with Beaumont, the appearance of the form becomes noticeable: twice in Cupid's Revenge , 10 times in A King and no King , twice in The Scornful Lady , once in Thierry and Theodore , twice in The Woman Hater . There is a single occurrence of a'th' in Wit Without Money ; and the form appears twice in the manuscript—but not in the folio text—of The Honest Man's Fortune , again the work of the scribe Edward Knight. 4 Neither, it would appear, did the scribe Ralph Crane, since o'th' , not a'th' , is the form of the contraction used in his manuscript of The Witch . 5 Of the 7 occurrences of o'th' in A Mad World , 6 occur in the contraction vpo'th ; doubtless, in combination with upon, Middleton employed the o and not the a spelling. 6 The NED explains a for on as a worn-down proclitic form of the Old English Preposition an (I, p. 2); a for of as "worn down from of, f being dropped before a cons[onant], and the toneless o sunk into the neutral ß, which being the ordinary sound of toneless a , . . . was here also written a " (I, p. 3). 7 Cf. SB , VIII, (1956), 145. 8 For Beaumont's use of ha' , see SB , XI (1958), 88 ff. For Field's use of the form, see SB , XII (1959), 92 ff. For the occurrence of ha' in the Fletcher-Massinger collaborations, see SB , XII (1959), 92, footnote 6. 9 Dewar M. Robb, in his "The Canon of William Rowley's Plays," ( MLR , XLV [1950], 129-41), observing that A Match at Midnigh was accepted as Rowley's till the time of Fleay, states that "no sufficient evidence has yet been adduced to deprive him of its authorship" (p. 140). But elsewhere (p. 133, footnote 9) he comments that it is "perhaps significant" that Rowley's commonest exclamation, "Tush!" does not appear frequently in this play. 10 It is surely significant that the 'm contraction, which appears steadily through sigs. A2-F3 (just before the end of Act III) is used only once (IV,1; sig. G4) thereafter. In what follows (Acts IV and V; sigs. G3-I3) occur 9 of the play's 10 occurrences of ye . This may either point to a difference in compositorial practices, or it may bear out Fleay's suggestion ( Chronicles of the English Drama , II, 102) that the last two acts of A Woman Never Vex were borrowed from an older play. 11 Fletcher seems to have used the 'um spelling too. For a full discussion of the whole vexed matter of 'em/'um and its occurrence in the canon, see SB , XI (1958), 97-98, and the linguistic tables at the end of that section of the present study (pp. 100-106). * Figures for IV,4 are based on Q 1622. * The form occurs once as i'the . ** The form occurs once as a the . * The form occurs once as i'the . 12 Pauline G.

      <field name="heading_text">A List of Printers' Apprentices, 1605-1640 by D. F. McKenzie *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the extant but still unprinted records of the Stationers' Company of London are two volumes of particular significance to students of the book trade in the seventeenth century. These are the Register of Apprentices, 1605-1666, and the Register of Freemen, 1605-1704. 1 It is from these two volumes that I have compiled the following list of apprentices either bound to or made free by printers between July 1605 and December 1640. I hope that it may eventually be possible to follow it with a similar list of apprentices bound to members of the Stationers' Company other than printers in this same period. This is not the place for a detailed discussion of apprenticeship in the Stationers' Company, but one or two considerations which have determined the form of the present list ought perhaps to be mentioned. Apart from the paramount purpose of making more readily available the important biographical information contained in the Registers, one important aim has been to show the rate of recruitment into individual printing houses and the kind of men employed. For this reason I have departed from the chronological order of the Registers and have regrouped the entries alphabetically under masters. To do this is to gain much and to lose little (annual intake into the printing trade as a whole can still be calculated either from the dates of entry in the Register or, more properly, from the dates on which apprentices began their service). Also it is possible to see at a glance something of the social composition of a particular establishment. Since then this was not to be a transcript so much as an edited calendar, it seemed only logical as well as more economical to combine in a single entry the information provided by the two Registers. In this I have perhaps erred at times. It is usual to find beside the name of an apprentice taking up his freedom the name of the master to whom he was originally bound (even although he may have been long dead); frequently it is the name of the master whom he is serving on (duly recorded) transfer; often it is the widow of his original master, whether or not she is actually carrying on the business (she may even have married again outside the Company and yet still present him); occasionally it is the new husband of the widowed mistress; and sometimes, when two or more names appear together, these may indicate either successive masters or masters in partnership. In all these cases there is a verifiable link, but there are numerous instances of an apprentice being bound to one man and made free by another without there being any such connection. Since there were many unrecorded transfers I have chosen to assume that such an apprentice simply changed his master rather than to make the double assumption that he was bound but never made free and that another apprentice of the same name and at the appropriate time was made free but never bound (although this, I fear, might very well have happened). Although I have rigorously abbreviated the original entries, apart from a note of the fee paid no actual information has been omitted and some has occasionally been added. The substance of any marginal or foot notes has of course been given. The formula varies little: William Smith son of William Smith (late) of Bottisham in the County of Cambridge Yeoman (deceased) doth put himself an apprentice to William Smith Citizen and Stationer of London for the term of seven years from the feast of Saint Bartholomew next (or last past). In this list then the information and the order in which it is recorded are: (a) Masters, in alphabetical order, and (b) Apprentices, again in alphabetical order, 1. apprentice's Christian and surnames; 2. his father's Christian name, adding (d) if dead; 3. his town or village, and county, of origin; 4. his father's trade; 5. the date of entry in the Register; 6. the date, or the date of the feast day, from which the term of binding runs; 7. the date of freedom, if any; 8. the term of binding in years. The first two items and the name of the town or village are given as they appear in the Register; the remainder are abbreviated. I have not attempted to correct the ascription of counties in the text (some are wrong and some have been made so by altered boundaries), but I have consistently altered the legal dating to normal calendar year dating. The numbering of the apprentices is a purely arbitrary device to facilitate indexing; thus the same apprentice may be assigned two different numbers when he is listed under two different masters. Names recurring in a slightly different spelling reflect the variant entries of the two Registers. A word is necessary about the additional information supplied. Where an apprentice is made free in the period covered but bound before it, I have given the reference to the original entry of binding in Arber's Transcript (as Arber II. 250), and I have also normally completed entries for apprentices bound during the period but made free after it. Cross references are given for apprentices turned over or made free by someone other than the original master. Occasionally I have referred (as Jackson 169) to the Book of Fines or Court-Book C as printed by W. A. Jackson in Records of the Court of the Stationers' Company 1602 to 1640 , to "Court-Book B" as printed by E. Boswell and W. W. Greg in Records of the Court of the Stationers' Company 1576 to 1602 (as Greg 73) and to wills (as Plomer, Wills 42) printed by H. R. Plomer in Abstracts from the Wills of English Printers and Stationers from 1492 to 1630 . Besides an index of apprentices I have added an index of place-names for the separate counties. Most research into the book trade in this period has understandably been centered on London, but I believe that there is likely to be much information still awaiting discovery in provincial records. In this respect this index to the places of origin of printers' apprentices is not likely to be so useful as one recording the places of origin of booksellers' apprentices, but it will possibly assist those who may wish to delve further into, for example, the educational and social background of printing-house employees. Finally it should be noted of course that not all the masters listed here were printing for the whole time that they were taking apprentices; that about some there is still doubt whether they ever printed; and that there may just be someone who both printed and took apprentices in the period whom I have inadvertently omitted.

      <field name="heading_text">The Problem of Indifferent Readings in the Eighteenth Century, with a Solution from The Deserted Village by Arthur Friedman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The arguments in recent years in favor of using the first edition as copy-text have been concerned to a considerable extent with showing that the accidentals of the author's manuscript will thus be most closely approximated. For the substantive readings it would seem in theory to make very little difference what copy-text is chosen. The editor who selects the first edition will introduce into his edited text all changes in later editions for which he thinks the author is responsible, and the editor who chooses the last edition revised by the author will revert to earlier readings when he is sure the changes were made by the compositor or printinghouse editor; so the difference would seem to be largely one of emphasis. In practice, however, the choice of copy-text may be of great importance for the substantive readings, for when he comes to the actual business of making his text the editor finds himself strongly influenced by two sometimes conflicting considerations: he wants to depart from his copy-text as little as possible, and he wants to include in the edited text all revisions made by the author. Now when the last revised edition is chosen, these two considerations merely reinforce each other, since—except for obvious misprints—all the readings of the copy-text may possibly be authorial. The editor, consequently, is likely to avoid decisions by reproducing his copy-text with a minimum of change, and he can then assume that by placing the earlier readings in the textual notes the reader—who can have no detailed knowledge of the textual problems involved—will in some obscure way be able to make up his own mind about difficult variants. When, however, the first edition is chosen, the two considerations oppose each other, for to depart from the copy-text may be to introduce compositorial error and to follow it may be to neglect authorial revision. Thus each variant reading offers a new problem to be solved, and the excellence of the edited text will largely depend on the skill with which these solutions are made. This argument for the use of the first edition as copy-text rests on the assumption that it is possible in most cases to distinguish with a high degree of probability between substantive revisions made by the author and changes made in the printing-house. Unless this assumption is correct—unless, in other words, the distinction can be made on the basis of something more certain than personal taste or vague questions of style—then it would be better to print with a minimum of change the substantive readings of the last revised edition. In attempting to distinguish between author and compositor, one kind of variant that proves most troublesome, in part because of the frequency with which it occurs, is what may be called the indifferent reading, where one reading is not obviously superior to the other. 1 These changes are usually small and most frequently consist in the alteration of a single word or a change in word order ('soldiers and sailors' or 'sailors and soldiers') or the addition or omission of a word ('in town and in country' or 'in town and country'). This kind of change is one that authors often make deliberately, but it is also one that compositors frequently make through carelessness. By their very number these variants take on an importance that they do not have singly; at least if we believe that the excellence of an author depends in some degree on small points of style, we cannot consider these readings truly indifferent. We do not wish to reject a large number of authorial revisions, but equally we do not want to load the text with compositorial errors, and for any particular reading there is usually no good basis for choice. Fortunately, in the case of Oliver Goldsmith—and, I imagine, of some other authors of his period—what cannot be done with any degree of confidence by considering single instances can be done with a high degree of probability by treating this kind of reading as a class. In the third quarter of the eighteenth century compositors of authorized editions followed their copy with great care, and in unrevised reprints of Goldsmith's writings they introduced on an average one substantive change only every five or ten or even twenty pages. In most revised editions of his works, on the other hand, new substantive readings occur on an average of two to five or more a page. If we assume that compositors were as careful in revised as in unrevised reprints, then the compositor would introduce on an average only one new substantive reading while Goldsmith was introducing anywhere from ten to a hundred; and if we were to limit ourselves to indifferent readings I think the proportion of authorial changes would be at least as high. To be particular, in the revised 1762 edition of The Citizen of the World there are literally hundreds of new indifferent readings; but in the unrevised edition of 1774, though the compositor introduced substantive changes of all sorts on an average of one in five pages, there are hardly more than a dozen new indifferent readings in the two volumes (I exclude from the count of indifferent readings here the very frequent expansion of contractions of the kind discussed below). In editing the text of Goldsmith I have consequently—except in special cases where I was reasonably sure of compositorial intervention—admitted into the edited text all indifferent readings that first made their appearance in revised reprints. By so doing I have no doubt followed a few errors, but I was willing to spare an occasional compositorial enemy for the sake of preserving a host of authorial friends. This is my general practice, but I have been able to refine it by taking certain other habits of Goldsmith and his printers into account. 1. Although it may be an author's practice to make very numerous changes when he revises, he may not give equal attention to all parts of a text. In revising for the second edition of his Essays , for example, Goldsmith made extensive alterations in some of the pieces, but the only changes that appear in some of the others are infrequent new indifferent readings. These latter changes I have tended to ascribe to the compositor, as I have all occasional indifferent readings in an extended section of a revised text which shows no other signs of having received the author's attention. 2. In a particular period compositors may show a curious uniformity in making certain kinds of changes. In Goldsmith's writings the expansion of contractions such as 'I'm 'and 'he's' and 'can't' and the change of 'an' in such a phrase as 'an horse' to 'a' appear with approximately equal regularity in unrevised and revised reprints made for various booksellers. I have consequently assigned all such changes to the compositor and retained the original readings from the edition set from manuscript. 3. In The Deserted Village analytical bibliography has come to my aid in the case of two difficult indifferent readings, and I imagine the method of my solution is applicable to many works of the period. In recent years Professor Todd has made us increasingly aware of the fact that in the later eighteenth century type was frequently left standing, particularly for shorter works such as poems, plays, and pamphlets, to be reimpressed when a reprint was needed. Of course changes that originated either with the author or in the printing-house could be made in the standing type before it was reimpressed. The author could request any changes he liked, though he might be asked not to call for additions or deletions that would seriously disturb the make-up, just as a modern author is warned not to make extensive revisions in page proof. An editor employed in the printing-house might order various kinds of changes to be made—corrections of misprints, regularization of punctuation and spelling, alteration of what appeared to him to be errors or infelicities; it is extremely unlikely, however, that he would introduce new indifferent readings, where the new readings did not appear to be obviously superior to the old. The compositor, finally, would not, except in most unusual circumstances, introduce new readings through carelessness, since any changes he made in standing type would be deliberate. When, therefore, new indifferent readings are introduced in standing type, we can with a very high degree of probability assign them to the author. Of the five editions of The Deserted Village that followed the first edition in 1770, each was printed in part or in whole from type left standing from the edition that preceded it. 2 Of these editions Goldsmith revised only for the second and the fourth. In the second edition there are two new indifferent readings (p. 7, l. 4: 'the' for 'his'; p. 11, l. 2: 'steady' for 'ready'), but both appear in sections where the type was newly set. In the fourth edition there are four new indifferent readings. One of these (p. 19, l. 5: 'Through' for 'To') occurs where the type was reset. A second— 'sweet' for 'soft' (p. 8, l. 1)—does not seem to be the kind of change that a compositor would make carelessly, and consequently the fact that the alteration was made in standing type merely confirms our belief that the author was responsible. The other readings would, without the aid of analytical bibliography, offer difficult choices. In the first three editions the last line on page 20 reads: "And left a lover's for her father's arms"; in the fourth edition the reading is 'a father's.' The change from 'her' to 'a' is just the kind of repetition (from 'a lover's') that compositors frequently introduce through faulty memory; but since it was made in standing type, we can be confident that it was ordered by the author. Finally, there is a more important change. In the first three editions a passage on page 5 appears as follows: Here as I take my solitary rounds, Amidst thy tangling walks, and ruined grounds, And, many a year elapsed, return to view Where once the cottage stood, the hawthorn grew, Here, as with doubtful, pensive steps I range, Trace every scene, and wonder at the change, Remembrance wakes with all her busy train, Swells at my breast, and turns the past to pain. In the fourth edition the penultimate couplet is omitted. The passage is certainly satisfactory without the couplet; on the other hand, it would be hard to show that the couplet is more redundant than many left standing in the poem. Certainly it is not so obviously bad that an editor in the printing-house would have had it struck out. Again, it does not seem probable that the type fell out by accident, for in the third edition the couplet does not appear at the very top or bottom of the page, and the lines that preceded and followed it do not appear in the fourth edition to have been disarranged. If the passage had been newly set, it would seem not improbable that the compositor omitted the couplet through negligence; but since it was printed from standing type, the most probable solution is that Goldsmith marked the couplet for deletion when he revised for the fourth edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I do not wish to suggest that a change can be assigned to author or compositor merely according to whether or not it is an improvement, for the kind of change I find no satisfactory way of assigning is the one where improvement is most obvious. This is the correction of a mistake or in felicity—usually of a slip in grammar or a violation of idiom. Should we, to choose examples from Goldsmith's Essays , assign the correction of "one of his legs were cut off" or "I would desire . . . to imitate that fat man who I have somewhere heard of" to the author or the compositor? All we could say, if the corrections first appeared in a revised edition, would be that Goldsmith probably changed the readings if he noticed them and that the compositor changed them without hesitation if Goldsmith left them uncorrected. Actually Goldsmith let the first reading stand through two revisions and passed over the second while revising the sentence in which it appears; the compositors of two authorized editions left the readings unchanged; and they were corrected only in a pirated edition. An editor will almost inevitably admit into the edited text the corrections of mistakes and infelicities if these corrections first appear in revised editions, but in so doing he may be following the compositor as frequently as the author. Indeed we may set it down as a rule that the more obvious the change, the more impossible to assign it either to author or compositor. 2 All the early editions of The Deserted Village have the same collation: 4°, A 2 a 2 B-G 2 . In the second edition all of a, B, and G and probably E2r are from the same setting as the first. In the third edition a-G are from the same setting as the second with no alterations in the text, but the evidence, as far as it goes, suggests that the sheets for the two were not continuously impressed: both have the same press figure on E2r, but in the second edition either E1 or E2 is a cancel; and G1v has a figure in the third but not in the second edition. In the fourth edition all of C and D, F2v, and probably F1r are from the same setting as the third. In the fifth edition all of a and B and E1r and E2v are from the same setting as the fourth. In the sixth edition all of D and F are from the same setting as the fifth. It may be noted that the third edition of The Traveller is all from the same setting of type as the second except for F2r-v.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The History of A Poem: Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington by Edgar F. Shannon, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Despite Professor Paull F. Baum's assertion that the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington "leaves modern readers cold," Laurence Binyon considers it a "fine example" of the Horatian ode in English and one of three such pieces worthy of a place with Marvell's ode upon Cromwell. Sir Harold Nicolson refers to Tennyson's ode as "magnificent"; Sir Charles Tennyson thinks it "perhaps his greatest . . . poem." 1 No doubt nationality, as well as temperament and training, affects a reader's response to this poem; but whether or not one can prove the Ode upon one's patriotic pulses, certainly it represents a notable technical achievement and a significant, though frequently over-looked, profession of Tennyson's faith — not alone in country, but in man and God. Yet the unity of tone and grammar of assent that characterize the ultimate text are the result of sustained application by the poet. Manuscripts and proofs testify to his assiduity; and three successive versions appeared (1852, 1853, 1855) before the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington neared its final form. The definitive text is thirty lines longer than that of the first edition. Six of the lines originally published have been omitted; and, exclusive of changes in punctuation, over thirty of these have been altered or entirely recast. An account of the composition, reception, and revision of the poem and an appendix of variorum readings will illustrate Tennyson's scrupulous craftsmanship and his increasing willingness, as poet laureate, to speak affirmatively to the people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I On September 14, 1852, the Duke of Wellington died in Walmer Castle on the Channel coast near Dover, a place of residence that he enjoyed by virtue of his office as Warden of the Cinque Ports. His son and heir, Arthur Wellesley, Marquis of Douro, was at the time traveling with his family on the Continent; and until he had been notified no arrangements for the disposition of the body could be concluded. 2 Owing to the Duke's austere mode of living, both press and populace feared that he might have prohibited a state funeral. Hence there was general satisfaction over the information provided on the afternoon of September 17 that there was no such proscription and that his will placed his remains "at the disposal of his Sovereign." 3 As the Illustrated London News declared, "Throughout the realm of Britain, all questions and topics of conversation and discussion have temporarily merged into one — when, where, and with what state and ceremonial the great Duke of Wellington shall be buried?" — a concern which Tennyson reflected in the opening line of his second strophe, "Where shall we lay the man whom we deplore?" 4 On September 20, in a letter from Balmoral to the Home Secretary, the Prime Minister, Lord Derby, hastening, as he said, "to relieve the public anxiety," announced the Queen's wish that the Duke of Wellington, "with all solemnity due to the greatness of the occasion," should be buried in St. Paul's cathedral, "there to rest by the side of Nelson — the greatest military by the side of the greatest naval chief who ever reflected lustre upon the annals of England." In order to honor the Duke with the will of the people, however, the Queen had determined to await the approval of her decision by both houses of Parliament, which were not expected to assemble until November 11. 5 Preparations began for an elaborate ceremonial, but it was clear that the funeral could not take place until almost two months had elapsed. Two months seem ample time in which to prepare a poetical tribute to the departed hero; but Tennyson's habitually deliberate composition and his characteristic diffidence lend credence to Thomas Kibble Hervey's assertion in the Athenaeum , based he said on personal knowledge, that the poet was hurried in writing the ode and that in commemorating the occasion he "yielded reluctantly to arguments." 6 At any rate, he accepted the challenge that circumstances had provided and can scarcely have found the task uncongenial — mere "Laureate work," as some of the reviewers implied. Doubtless, he was genuinely moved by the Duke of Wellington's death and by the implications of his life, symbolizing as it did England's heroic past, public service, devotion to duty, courage, simplicity, integrity. Alarmed over the possibility of a French invasion, after Louis Napoleon's coup d'état of December, 1851, Tennyson, "in a white heat of emotion," as Sir Charles says, had dashed off a series of newspaper verses in which, under assumed names, he had exhorted his countrymen to vigilance and valor. 7 He had been a fervid proponent of the Militia Bill, which augmented the national defenses by 80,000 militiamen and which the Duke of Wellington had championed in the House of Lords on June 15, 1852. 8 From the beginning of his literary career in 1830, Tennyson had shown a predilection for the patriotic strain. 9 Everyone is familiar with the conservative liberalism of "You ask me, why," "Of old sat Freedom," and "Love thou thy land" (1842). "Hail, Briton!" and "The Queen of the Isles," written in the '30's and until recently unpublished, further evince his response to public events — a response so fully developed and consistently maintained that he could appropriate six lines from "Hail, Briton!" for his ode to Wellington. 10 The civic muse recurs in "Walking to the Mail" and "Locksley Hall" (1842), in "The Golden Year" (1846), in the "Conclusion" to The Princess (1847), and in In Memoriam (1850). In 1851 the seventh edition of Poems had opened with laudatory stanzas "To the Queen." Yet if, once committed, Tennyson embarked upon the project with some verve, he must have labored under handicaps. Besides having undertaken to meet a deadline, he had obligated himself to demonstrate his qualities as laureate. "To the Queen" had actually been his initial song as court poet, but the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington would be his first separately published venture since In Memoriam and his acceptance of the bays. Two years of domesticity, with its concomitant house-hunting, travel, child-birth, and visitors, had not been conducive to poetry; and now Hallam Tennyson, born on August 11 and christened October 5, was both a fascination and a distraction. 11 Tennyson, generally acknowledged to be the leading poet of England, had a reptutation to maintain; and The Times' belated review of In Memoriam and George Gilfillan's recent diatribe in the Critic provided no grounds for complacency. 12 For the first time in his literary life Tennyson was truly under pressure. In the latter half of October a royal proclamation officially scheduled the Speech from the Throne and the opening of Parliamentary business for November 11. Approval of Wellington's obsequies presumably would soon follow, and the burial was projected for the period from November 17 through 19. 13 Meanwhile Tennyson persevered at his work. Devising an original prosodic form and a unifying scheme of monologue, dialogue, and action, he largely surmounted the impediments to poesy that confronted him. On November 6 the poet's publisher, Edward Moxon, wrote as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Putney Heath Nov. 6 th 1852 . My dear Tennyson: For an edition of 10,000 copies of your Ode on the death of the Duke of Wellington I beg to offer you two hundred pounds, the amount to be paid at Christmas, or, should you wish it, on the day of publication. faithfully yours Edw d . Moxon. 14 The selling price to be s 1/ —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tennyson noted his acceptance of Moxon's offer in the margin of the letter. Finally the funeral was set for November 18, and the elegy was ready within the available time. Although Tennyson had not brought it to the perfection that he would afterwards attain, it possessed the authentic cadence. He wished to honor the great Duke and was apparently satisfied to submit his lines to the verdict of readers and reviewers. A single octavo, bound in gray paper, the Ode , consisting of 251 lines of varying lengths, was published on November 16, two days before the funeral. 15 Undoubtedly Sir Charles is right that his hopes for the success of the poem were high. 16</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II It was hardly to be expected that the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington would fully satisfy the reviewers' preconceptions, but their verdict was not unanimously hostile, as has generally been supposed. 17 Anticipating the date of publication by a day, the magisterial Times , on Monday, November 15, treated the ode to a full column, which was widely reprinted, paraphrased, and plagiarized by metropolitan, provincial, and Scottish newspapers. 18 If "The Thunderer's" approach was somewhat condescending — "There is no affectation . . . in any of the lines . . . . [The poem] has more beauty than force, more sweetness and feeling than dignity and magnificence" — it found Tennyson "faithful to his mission" and quoted almost half of the poem. To introduce strophe VIII the reviewer wrote, "Never has . . . [the path of duty] been more simply and faithfully drawn than in the following lines." On Wednesday, November 17, the Guardian , a liberal weekly, announced that the poem was not up to Tennyson's reputation. The subject was too grand and stern for his genius. Yet, though marred by some eccentricities of versification and "not a great production," the Ode was "dignified and graceful, full of tender and picturesque expressions, and in . . . metre generally melodious." The critic then quoted more than a third of the poem, commenting on several selections with such words as "a fine address to the two great men [Nelson and Wellington]," "a beautiful passage," "a striking one." 19 Thursday, the day of the funeral, a short notice in the Fife Herald called the poem "a failure" — except for seventy-one lines comprising strophes VII and VIII, which were reprinted as a "noble passage." 20 But the impact of the Fife Herald upon public opinion was necessarily limited. Extensive critical attention to the Ode began on Saturday, November 20, when eight London weeklies reviewed it. Among them Tennyson's reception was mixed. 21 The Court Journal , which doted, it said, on "Locksley Hall," "The May Queen," "The Gardener's Daughter," and In Memoriam , found The Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington "somewhat redeemed by scattered lines of great beauty and power" but "very far inferior to anything" that the poet had yet written. "Disdaining all rules of rhythm and metre, Mr. Tennyson has strung together a series of expressions, which read more like dislocated prose than verse, full of endless repetitions and sing-song rhymes." 22 The Weekly News and Chronicle was prepared to be disappointed and duly found itself so. "Why, there is not a provincial newspaper in any of our large cities that has not, within the last three months, received dozens of such lines. . . ," it declared. 23 The Leader , a sophisticated and liberal journal, founded two years earlier by Thornton Hunt and George Henry Lewes, judged the poem "an intrinsically poor performance." 24 The paper that had lauded In Memoriam and would welcome Maud believed the Ode a tissue of "common-place reflections," unrelieved by the "splendour of imagery befitting a great event." 25 Both conception and execution struck the critic, probably Lewes himself, as "insignificant." 26 In the Athenaeum , T. K. Hervey maintained a cordial tone but could not accept the poem as a poetical offering "commensurate with those other forms of honour which in life were lavishly bestowed" on the Duke of Wellington. Excusing Tennyson on the ground of haste, Hervey looked for the poem to "be expanded into nobler proportions under the influence of longer time and added reflection." 27 The Spectator informed its readers that Tennyson's ode was "hardly equal to its theme." While reverting to its recurrent complaint about Tennyson's mannerisms, affectation, and babyism, this periodical, nevertheless, contradicted both the Leader and the Weekly News and Chronicle . If there was nothing profound about the poem, there was nothing about it "poor or commonplace. . . . The ode, be its faults what it may, is the work of a poet; its structure, its treatment, its thoughts, its style, all are removed from mere versifying." 28 Three other influential weeklies, the Atlas , the Examiner , and the Literary Gazette tendered unqualified praise. The Atlas asserted, "This ode will not disappoint the admirers of Mr. Tennyson's genius." Finding some of the stanzas equal to any in In Memoriam , the reviewer let the poet speak for himself in three passages totalling seventy-one lines. 29 The critic for the Examiner , presumably Tennyson's friend John Forster, assured his readers that, as poet laureate, Tennyson had been true to the occasion. As "grand and solemn" as the work was, so also was "the poet's simple strain of music . . . Exquisite for grace, pathos, and poetic fire, is the whole passage to Nelson; masterly the rapid and brief description of Wellington's victories." Forster contented himself with quoting only fifty lines, since "all Englishmen will read" the poem. 30 The Literary Gazette was panegyrical. The task of giving "voice to the emotions of the nation's heart, and the matured convictions of its judgment, in strains worthy of the great theme" was one to daunt "even the genius of Tennyson." But with a "lamentation simple, majestic, well-attempted, like the man himself," the poet had tendered a "fitting death-song" for the Great Duke. By every hearth-fire in England should this noble ode be read; — and read it will be, wherever English is a familiar tongue, and tear-dimmed eyes and swelling hearts will attest that England's greatest son has found a worthy bard. No extracts can convey an adequate idea of an ode so perfect in all its parts, and the music of which should be heard to develope itself in all its variety of mood and measured cadence. 31 Yet in order to illustrate the general nature of the poem, the Literary Gazette quoted in full six of the nine strophes of the poem and a part of a seventh — 166 lines in all! In spite of this encomium Tennyson took a bleak view of his prospects and wrote to Moxon, "if you lose by the Ode, I will not consent to accept the whole sum of £200 . . . . I consider it quite a sufficient loss if you do not gain by it." 32 Responding, on November 23, to a letter of congratulation from Henry Taylor, Tennyson exclaimed: "Thanks, thanks! . . . In the all but universal depreciation of my ode by the Press, the prompt and hearty appreciation of it by a man as true as the Duke himself is doubly grateful." 33 The poet's vulnerability to derogatory criticism seems to have given him a distorted notion of his reception. Possibly he had not seen the Atlas and the Literary Gazette . Since he had counted on Forster's loyalty, perhaps the Examiner was little consolation. 34 He may have read too impatiently to discover favorable comments in other papers; and as he later remarked to James Knowles, " I remember everything that has been said against me, and forget all the rest ." 35 Probably his hopes for a decisive critical success would have left him satisfied with little less than undivided acclaim. The equivocal reaction was a severe disappointment. 36 When he wrote to Taylor, however, the response to the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington was not complete. The same day the Ayr Observer pronounced it worthy of the unique event it celebrated and evidence of "very considerable power"; 37 but on November 26 the Dumfries-shire and Galloway Herald asseverated that the poem was not "equal to the occasion" and that Tennyson lacked the power "to smite a nation's heart" — though the paper succeeded in quoting more than half of his lines. 38 The next day the Illustrated London News , in a detailed critique signed J. A. H., deplored the laureate's ode. 39 Although this reviewer admitted that "in the midst of . . . poverty and humility of thought and style, there is an occasional beauty of phrase" and had no doubt that with time and leisure Tennyson would produce "a fine poem" on the subject, he scorned the present offering: "the sentiments scarcely ever reach to the elevation of the theme," and "the injudicious style of expression lowers the best of them to the level of contemptuous familiarity, offensive to well-educated taste." Yet within four days, on December 1, the Critic , which only ten months before had printed George Gilfillan's excoriation of Tennyson, came stoutly to his defense. 40 The Ode had "been received with a very divided opinion — hearty praise and immoderate dispraise"; but fear of abuse from Tennyson's detractors would not prevent the Critic from registering its appreciation of a work which it found "perfectly Aeschylian. Thoughts too large for regular metre, but not less poetical on that account, lie heaped with all the gorgeous profusion of a Greek chorus." Finally, in January, 1853, the High Church English Review printed another enthusiastic critique of the ode — "in our judgment, a most masterly composition." 41 For this reviewer the poem displayed a union of "magnificence and sobriety" characteristic of Wellington; and the essay concluded with the following eulogy: Despite some mannerism and, perhaps, some affectation, there are power and beauty, grandeur of sentiment and felicity of expression, sound and sense, combined in this noble composition, which has been received far too coldly by the public, and with the most preposterous affectation of patronage by many of the sensible critics of the day. All honour to England's laureate, say we , who has amply justified the choice of England's Queen! Obviously the severity of the critical reaction to the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington has been considerably overstated. When Tennyson wrote to Taylor of "the all but universal disparagement of my ode by the Press," he seems excessively to have discounted such friendly reviews as those in the Atlas , the Examiner , and the Literary Gazette , and characteristically to have disregarded many favorable remarks in other papers. At this time, moreover, the articles in the Critic and the English Review , which must have been balm to his wounded spirit, had not yet appeared. Even the derogatory reviews had, in every case, found some lines to quote with praise, and the newspapers had disseminated substantial excerpts from the poem throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. From his letter to Moxon, Tennyson apparently assumed a reduced demand for the poem, owing to adverse criticism; but it seems likely that extensive quotation in the newspapers may have lessened desire for the complete text. In the middle of January 1853, Tennyson wrote somewhat dolefully to his wife that "only about 6000 of the Ode" had been sold. 42 Certainly, this figure was far short of the 10,000 that Moxon had anticipated, but it was not a meager one. After the author's honorarium and the costs of printing and distribution, the publisher still probably realized a small profit. At any rate, he was willing to hazard a second edition. At the end of February or early in March 1853, he issued at one shilling another paper-bound octavo almost indistinguishable from its predecessor, except for a slight variation in the color of the binding and the words on both cover and title page — "A NEW EDITION." 43</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The new edition was twenty-nine lines longer than the first and contained numerous alterations. Exactly when Tennyson began to revise is unknown; but he probably started not long after the funeral and continued his efforts until near the date of publication of the second edition. 44 Although Henry Taylor wrote, "I hear you are going to see the Duke buried," Tennyson did not actually witness the interment. 45 From Somerset House in the Strand he watched the magnificent procession that conveyed Wellington's body from the Horse Guards to St. Paul's and pronounced it "very fine." He may have visited the interior of the cathedral after the funeral; and he later read an account of the burial. 46 To commemorate a great public event is easier than to anticipate it. After Tennyson had been stirred by pomp and pageantry and had shared with his countrymen the emotions of the occasion, he could more effectively strike the appropriate mood than he could possibly have done beforehand. It was inevitable that he would make additions and corrections to the Ode , especially since circumstances had forced him to publish without his customary period of testing and perfecting. Certainly he wished the poem to take its place as a fitting and enduring memorial to "England's greatest son." The reviewers' objections indicated that he had not attained his goal and may have crystallized his determination to silence his detractors. His severest critic, J. A. H. in the Illustrated London News , had predicted that the future would bring from Tennyson a suitable tribute to the Duke. T. K. Hervey had envisaged a longer and nobler poem as the result of time and further reflection. Such opinions were earnest of a favorable predisposition toward a revised edition. While it seems unlikely that Tennyson would have emended his Ode so fully as he did if the reception of the first version had been entirely laudatory, he paid scant attention to the strictures on his versification or to condemnation, for one reason or another, of specific passages. Among a dozen such passages his treatment of only one implies a possible reaction to criticism. The Illustrated London News had cited the opening seven-line strophe of the poem — Let us bury the Great Duke With an empire's lamentation, Let us bury the Great Duke To the noise of the mourning of a mighty nation, When laurel-garlanded leaders fall, And warriors carry the warriors pall, And sorrow darkens hamlet and hall. — as an example of "what one of Shakespeare's fools calls 'the false gallop of verse' — most full and most facile in its rhymes." The Spectator had commented that this strophe betrayed "strong traces of Tennyson's mannerism and affectation of simplicity, pushed almost to babyism" and "might have been suggested by the well-known dirge of 'Who Killed Cock Robin?'" Even the friendly English Review said, "We like least the opening, which is abrupt. . . ." Although Tennyson left the rhyme scheme and the first four lines unchanged in the second edition, he altered lines 5 and 6 so that the last three lines read, Mourning when their leaders fall, Warriors carry the warrior's pall, And sorrow darkens hamlet and hall. Thus he improved the syntax of the strophe, intensified the attitude of mourning by reiterating the participle, and avoided a sing-song repetition of "And" at the beginning of lines 6 and 7. "Laurel-garlanded" was a trite and awkward epithet with inappropriate implications. Its omission silenced the insistent alliteration and assonance of the line and shifted the associations from those of classical triumph to modern leadership. If Tennyson disregarded censure of other passages, he seems to have taken into account several general objections that the critics registered. For example, The Times had remarked, "The severe old soldier on the battlefield is not before us — the stern, unbending statesman — inflexible till inflexibility became a fault — does not strike our minds with awe." To the celebration in strophe IV of Wellington's qualities as a statesman Tennyson prefixed the following two lines: No more in soldier fashion will he greet With lifted hand the gazer in the street. (ll. 21-22) 47 To the account in strophe VI of the Duke's military exploits he added five lines on Wellington's activities in the peninsular campaign (ll. 103-107). With some justification the Leader had complained that the ode was not about the death of the Duke but about his burial — "which it neither describes nor calls up before the reflective eye, suggesting grand and mournful images." Tennyson had given structure and movement to his poem through presenting his eulogy against a background of action — the decision upon a place of burial, the procession through the streets, the entrance to St. Paul's, the awakening of the shade of Nelson, the entrusting of the soul to God. But he had omitted the climax toward which the poem moved — the committal of the body to the earth. Now after the event and after reading a report of the ceremony, he skillfully supplied this lack. The inserted lines 251-253, concerning the "tides of Music's golden sea/Setting toward eternity," and the alteration of line 254 from "For solemn, too, this day are we" to "Lifted up in heart are we" shifted the mood from solemnity to exaltation. Four additional lines, concluding with the words from the order for burial in the Book of Common Prayer , provided a specific description of the descent of the coffin: Hush, the Dead March sounds in the people's ears: The dark crowd moves: and there are sobs and tears: The black earth yawns: the mortal disappears; Ashes to ashes, dust to dust . . . . (ll. 267-270) There can be no doubt of the extent to which these lines enhance the resolution of the poem in the second and all subsequent editions. The English Review took strenuous exception to the ending of strophe III: "The last great Englishman is low." Tennyson had qualified this dictum as he began strophe IV: ". . . for to us he seems the last: / Our sorrow draws but on the golden Past"; but the English reviewer cried, "Let us hope that the assertion of the last line will not be verified by future events" and digressed from literary analysis long enough to write fourteen lines of verse declaring: Our hearts are true, our souls are sound, Liberty yet on earth is found, Truth on her Island throne sits crown'd, And viewless walls are reared by Heav'n Britannia's shores around. Apparently in response to this critic, Tennyson clarified his qualifying lines to read, ". . . for to us he seems the last: / Remembering all his greatness in the Past." The poet also suppressed five lines in strophe VII suggesting the possibility of an apocalyptic future for England: Perchance our greatness will increase; Perchance a darkening future yields Some reverse from worse to worse, The blood of men in quiet fields, And sprinkled on the sheaves of peace. (ll. 170/171) Possibly two lines added near the opening of strophe VII, concerning England's natural strategic advantage — Thank him who isled us here, and roughly set His Saxon in blown seas and storming showers, (ll. 154-155) owe something to the reminder in the English Review of "Truth on her Island throne" and the "viewless walls" that Heaven had reared "Britannia's shores around." 48 The direct injunction to thank the Divinity in the lines Tennyson added here are symptomatic of an intensified religious note in the second edition. As he revised, Tennyson may simply have found himself in a more confident mood than he had experienced when he first wrote the ode. Possibly, upon extended reflection, he felt obliged to express emphatically what he though that he and the people of England ought to believe; but he may have been stung by the charge in the English Review that he tried to be "all things to all men," that he seemed to offer some lines for Christians and others for "the transcendental deist or pantheist, Carlyleite or Emersonian." Quoting from its review of In Memoriam , the English Review had reiterated the opinion that Tennyson's poetry contained "a little Christianity . . . , a little infidelity, and a good deal of scepticism." To his original passage attesting the pre-eminence of the human soul — Tho' world on world in myriad myriads roll Round us, each with different powers, And other forms of life than ours, What know we greater than the soul? — (ll. 262-265) Tennyson prefixed, in the new edition, three lines concerning geological evolution: For tho' the Giant Ages heave the hills And break the shore, and evermore Make and break, and work their will . . . . (ll. 259-261) In this way, he stressed the permanence of the soul by contrasting it with terrestrial flux; and while acknowledging the discoveries of science, he proclaimed an unshaken faith in the spirit. And to conclude the passage he inserted the line: On God and Godlike men we build our trust. (l. 266) Whatever influence the reviewers seem to have had upon Tennyson, he was never subservient to them, and his corrections of the Ode , like those in his previous poems, went far beyond anything that his critics had to suggest. Other significant alterations in the 1853 text of the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington appear to be entirely independent of criticism. Some of these produced improvements in tone, others in force of expression. For instance, in strophe V, after the admonition "Let the bell be toll'd," the subsequent line, "A deeper knell in the heart be knoll'd" (l. 59), imposed upon all the necessity of inner, personal grief as well as external acts of respect. In strophe VI, by calling the French forces "banded swarms" instead of "bandit swarms" (l. 110), he increased the accuracy of his modifier and the dignity of the Duke's activity. At the same time he muted the shrill anti-Gallic note. Opening this recast line with "Back to France," which the next line repeated, strengthened the reader's sense of the irresistible pressure that the Duke exerted against his adversaries. "Boundless reverence" in line 157, was obviously superior to "Most unbounded reverence" (see note 44 above). "And help the march of human mind" became "And drill the raw world for the march of mind" (l. 168). Still other alterations underlined aspects of the poet's message. For And O remember him who led your hosts; Respect his sacred warning; guard your coasts . . . Tennyson substituted Remember him who led your hosts; Revere his warning; guard your coasts: Your cannon moulder on the seaward wall . . . . (ll. 171-173) Eight lines later he expanded his eulogy of the Duke to include Whose life was work, whose language rife With rugged maxims hewn from life. (ll. 183-184) And in the succeeding strophe he changed He has not fail'd: he hath prevail'd . . . to read Such was he: his work is done. (l. 218) Besides suppressing any implication of possible failure and dispensing with redundancy and a chiming internal rhyme, Tennyson accentuated a Carlylian doctrine of work, which adequately prepared for the conviction, expressed in the first and all later editions, that in the afterlife Wellington must have "other nobler work to do / Than when he fought at Waterloo" (ll. 256-257). The theme of the ode — twice stated in strophe VIII of the first edition — had been that devotion to duty, not self-aggrandizement, is the way to earthly glory. In the second edition, singing this thematic refrain for a third time, Tennyson expanded the text to embrace a prophetic hope for universal acceptance of the moral of the Duke's life — and of the poet's words: But while the races of mankind endure, Let his great example stand Colossal, seen of every land, And keep the soldier firm, the statesman pure; Till in all lands and thro' all human story The path of duty be the way to glory . . . . (ll. 219-224) The new version of the Ode was a different poem from that which had displeased a majority of the reviewers in 1852. In the Athenaeum , on March 5, 1853, John Abraham Heraud pointed out a number of Tennyson's revisions and applauded the superiority of the second edition: "There are a completeness and compactness, produced by what is added and what is subtracted, that satisfy and fill the imagination with a sense of harmony that was previously wanting. . . . The poem as it stands has the mature stamp of the artist upon it." 49 Heraud's only cavil was over the imperfect rhyme of "priest" with "guest" and "rest" in the first three lines of strophe VI. He hoped to see a line subsequently added that would rhyme with "priest." In this desire he was disappointed; and despite his approval of the contrast that the poet had introduced in strophe II between the isolated situation of the Duke's death, "on Walmer's lonely shore," and London, his place of burial, Tennyson recognized that the line about Walmer interfered with the direct antiphonal reply to the question "Where shall we lay the man whom we deplore?" and deleted it when the poem next appeared in Maud, and Other Poems , 1855. Other corrections for the text of 1855 are not extensive, but they indicate continued care for exactness and felicity of phrase. The very first line gained by the shift from "Let us bury" to "Bury." The piece also benefited by the deletion of an unnecessary line between the initial defeat of Napoleon and the return from Elba that too specifically relaxed the enumeration of the Duke's exploits: "He withdrew to brief repose" (l. 118/119). The debt that England owes to great men Tennyson expanded from one "Of boundless reverence and regret" to that "Of boundless love and reverence and regret" (l. 157). The admonition "Revere his warning; guard your coasts" became explicitly "He bad you guard the sacred coasts" (l. 172). Three additional lines augmented the picture of the Duke's character in strophe VII: Who let the turbid streams of rumour flow Thro' either babbling world of high and low; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Who never spoke against a foe. (ll. 181-182, 184) In 1853, after hearing the music in St. Paul's "Setting toward eternity," the poet had declared, "Lifted up in heart are we." In 1855 the line had been expanded to "Uplifted high in heart and hope are we" (l. 254). In 1853 "the Dead March sounds in the people's ears"; in 1855 it "wails" (l. 267). These and other emendations brought the poem to a nearly final form. The Ode reached its permanent length of 281 lines in 1855, and after that date Tennyson's alterations were few. In the second edition of Maud, and Other Poems , 1856, he changed the phrase "worlds on worlds" to "world on world" (l. 262). The text of A Selection from the Works of Alfred Tennyson , 1865, reveals emendation of five words and two initial letters from lower case to capital. With the reading "world-earthquake" for "world's-earthquake" (l. 133) in volume III of the Library Edition of the laureate's works, 1872, the text had attained its definitive state. Yet, as slight as these modifications are, each minutely contributes to the finish of the poem — and attests the poet's extended search for perfection. As a discussion of the revisions indicates and scrutiny of the text confirms, the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington is far from a perfunctory funeral panegyric. It is a diligently wrought piece of artistry and, Janus-like, facing both Tennyson's poetical past and future, is an epitome of his mature thought. His views on such subjects as common sense, freedom, love of country, public virtues, constitutional monarchy, and social progress echo the patriotic and political poems of the '30's and early '40's, "Locksley Hall," and "The Poet's Song." His insistence upon duty, work, and personal immortality recall the burden of "Love and Duty," "The Golden Year," and In Memoriam . Military devotion to country anticipates the conclusion of "Maud"; and the paramount value of the soul foreshadows the central allegory of The Idylls the of King . Although Tennyson suppressed the lines concerning "some reverse from worse to worse," they survive as a brief reminder of his consciousness, years before he became obsessed with the idea in "The Last Tournament" and "Locksley Hall Sixty Years After," that a society may as easily disintegrate as advance and that progress may be retrograde as well as ameliorative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX The Development of the Text In addition to the published versions of the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington already discussed, evidence of the development of the text appears in manuscripts, in uncorrected proof for the first edition, a first edition with the author's autograph corrections, and a proof copy for the second edition with autograph corrections. Among the MSS formerly belonging to Sir Charles Tennyson, now in the Harvard College Library, there is no complete manuscript for the Ode and none that can have provided printer's copy. Those that exist (Tennyson Papers, bMS Eng 952.1:170-173) I have designated 1 through 6. MS 1, a working draft in Tennyson's autograph, is written on a half leaf of plain blue wove paper, no watermark, 4 1/16" x 6½". The recto bears the earliest variant lines of strophe IV, ll. 28-42. Two of the lines have been inserted in the margin. The verso contains the earliest version of strophe VI, ll. 142-150: Here will [? words partially cut away ] be seen no more But let the people voice in full acclaim From shore to shore, The proof &amp; echo of all human fame Loudly attest his claim With honour honour Etc The handwriting is hurried, almost scribbled. MS 2 in Tennyson's autograph, carefully written on a slip of plain blue wove paper, unwatermarked, 1⅝" x 6½" (the same paper as that of MS 1) carries on the recto a revised state of the passage above: Let the people's voice in full acclaim A people's voice the proof &amp; echo of all human fame Loudly attest his claim With Honour honour honour honour to him Eternal honour to his name. The verso is blank. MS 3 is in the hand of Emily Sellwood Tennyson, the poet's wife, but contains his autograph corrections. Written on both recto and verso of two folio leaves of plain blue laid unwatermarked paper, 13⅞" x 7⅞", formed by folding a single sheet which is still partially joined, this MS runs consecutively from line 1 through the first five lines of strophe VI (l. 84), lacks the rest of this strophe, strophe VII, and the first eight lines of strophe VIII, resumes with line 9 of strophe VIII (1. 200), and continues without omission to the end of the poem. MS 4 is in Tenynson's hand and has autograph revisions. It is written on a folio leaf and the top one-third of a separate folio leaf of the same plain blue laid unwatermarked paper as that of MS 3. The recto of the first leaf (13⅞" x 7⅞") includes the first four strophes of the poem, and the verso strophes V-VI, l. 90. The recto of the truncated leaf (5¼ x 7⅝") contains strophe VII, ll. 91-120, 122-133; the verso begins with strophe VI, l. 150 and continues through strophe VII, l. 169. MSS 3 and 4 appear originally to have represented identical states of the text; but in the parallel passages that have survived Tennyson's emendations bring MS 4 to a slightly later condition than MS 3. There is one notable exception, however. In the right hand margin of MS 4, f. 1 v , the poet drafted and indicated for insertion an early version of present ll. 53-57 (words printed within brackets he wrote initially and excised): Let the bell be toll'd, And [by themselves controll'd] a silent city behold Let a silent sea of the people behold Him that follows &amp; him that leads The towering car, [the stately] &amp; sable steeds: Bright let it be with its blazon'd deeds Dark in it's funeral fold. Then he deleted the entire passage and redrafted it: Let the bell [the] be toll'd, And a silent city behold The host that follows, y e host that leads, Banner &amp; baton &amp; mourning weeds, The towering car &amp; sable steeds. Bright let it be with his blazon'd deeds Dark in its funeral fold. But he inserted in the margin of MS 3, f. 1 v , a third and later version that varies only slightly from the text published in the first edition: Let the bell be toll'd And a reverent people behold The towering car &amp; [stately] sable steeds. Bright let it be with his blazon'd deeds Dark with it's funeral fold MS 5 consists of six autograph lines representing strophe VI, ll. 91-97, written parallel to the long dimension of the paper, on a leaf of plain white laid paper, with part of the watermark design showing in the lower left hand corner, 7⅛" 4¾". This passage replaces l. 91, "His foes were thine: he kept us free," in MS 4 and adds five new lines: His heart &amp; hand have kept us free Warrior Seaman this is he Worthy of our gorgeous rite And worthy to be laid by thee, He that never lost a fight, He that never lost a Gun, The verso is blank. MS 6 is an autograph draft on plain white laid paper, watermarked [Jo]hnson/1852, 7 1/16" x 4⅞", of strophe IX, ll. 251-254, which Tennyson inserted, somewhat altered, in his autograph corrections to the Pierpont Morgan copy of the first edition (see below). MS 6 reads as follows: We revere, &amp; while we hear Falls &amp; flows of harmony Tides of music's golden sea Breaking on Eternity Uplifted on those waves are we Until we &amp;c In the Morgan copy of the first edition Tennyson deleted l. 251, "For solemn, too, this day are we," and substituted the following: We revere, &amp; while we hear The tides of Music's golden sea Setting toward Eternity Lifted up in heart are we Until &amp; This version appears in the printed text of the corrected proof copy for the second edition in the Widener Collection (see below) and in the second edition. The verso of MS 6 is blank. The uncorrected proof for the first edition is in the Harvard College Library (*fEC 85.T2586.8520a). It prints the Ode in four columns on a single sheet of white wove paper, unwatermarked, 17⅜" x 223/16". Collation shows that this proof cannot have been set from either MS 3 or MS 4 and that it varies by two capitals from MS 5. It is, however, considerably anterior to the text of the first edition and cannot represent a final state of proof. There are several printer's errors — "ambition's" for "ambitious" (l. 28), "here" for "have" (l. 91), "But" for "But (l. 278); and lines 53-57 follow the emended reading of MS 4 instead of the later reading of MS 3. The first edition with Tennyson's autograph alterations is in the Pierpont Morgan Library (W27/B copy 1). Most of these changes found their way into the text of the proof copy for the second edition (see below) and the second edition, but Tennyson did not adopt "Bury" for "Let us bury" (l. 1) until 1855. For the first line of strophe II, "Where shall we lay the man whom we deplore?" (l. 8), he substituted Soldiers, ye with measured tread Shall follow now his fallen head To his last home among the dead. Your chief shall rest in London's central roar. Yet he did not use this version in any subsequent state of the text. The proof copy for the second edition with author's corrections (erroneously catalogued as a second edition) is in the Widener Collection of the Harvard College Library. There are instances of light inking, and there is some smearing of the impression on the title page. This copy is without covers; the single gathering is not sewed, but it has been opened. It is inscribed on the first page of the text, "Walter White / from / ATennyson." The printed text reveals a new experiment with the first lines of strophe II: The people's friend, the monarch's guide, The mate of kings, the man who bore Batons of eight armies, died, . . . But Tennyson deleted them and returned in autograph to the original reading of MSS and first edition: "Where shall we lay y e man whom we deplore?" Two lines concerning the Duke's character that occur in the letterpress — Who let the turbid streams of rumour flow Thro' either babbling world of high and low; though unaltered in autograph, and included without modification in the text of 1855, did not appear in the second edition. This example and numerous variants in punctuation, typography, and spelling from the second edition prove that this proof copy as emended was not the state of the text immediately preceding the second edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Variant Readings Below I provide variorum notes, in which I indicate all variants — exclusive of punctuation not accompanying a change in phraseology — from the authoritative text in the annotated Eversley Edition ( The Works of Tennyson , ed. Hallam Tennyson [London: Macmillan and Co., 1908]: Poems , II, 210-221). 50 Since the final text of the poem is readily accessible, considerations of space preclude reprinting it here. Variations in punctuation disclose Tennyson's attention to detail and his tendency to add punctuation marks and to increase the formality of earlier punctuation as he revised. Thus punctuation is sometimes helpful in establishing the order of existing texts; but the instances of change in punctuation without a change in wording are too frequent and critically unimportant to warrant reproduction. Variations in punctuation occurring along with variant phraseology, I have included in the notes. I have not considered an ampersand, "w h ," or "y e " in MS a variation from an "and," "which," or "the" in a printed text; but when a variant line or phrase in MS includes an ampersand, "w h ," or "y e ," I reproduce it in my note. Of the six minor alterations in diction that took place after the second edition of Maud, and Other Poems , 1856, five appear in A Selection from the Works of Alfred Tennyson (London: Edward Moxon, 1865) and one in Volume III of the Library Edition of The Works of Alfred Tennyson (London: Strahan and Co., 1872). Since it has not been feasible to examine all the numerous editions between 1856 and 1872 that printed the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington , I cannot say incontrovertibly that the five changes apparent in 1865 and the one in 1872 first entered the text on those dates; but the likelihood is strong that they did. Tennyson arranged and revised his work carefully for both A Selection and the Library Edition; and they are significant terminal points in the development of the text.

Corrected trans . Transposed MS 3 -- 1852 Reading appears in MS 3 and in all subsequent states that include the line through the first edition, 1852 The numerals introducing the notes are the line numbers of the final text. A word or phrase to the left of the lemma is the reading of the final text. All known variants from this reading are listed to the right of the lemma. If the symbol for one of the states of the text listed above does not appear to the right of the lemma, the reading in that state is the same as that of the final version. There is an exception concerning the manuscripts, however. Since none of the manuscripts contains a complete version of the poem, omission of the symbol for a MS to the right of the lemma may mean that the line in which a variant reading occurs is not extant in that MS. This possible ambiguity seems preferable to cluttering the notes with incessant reminders under any variant line that it is missing in several MSS. Anyone using the notes should bear in mind that portions of the poem are missing in the MSS as follows: MS 1 lacks ll. 1-27; 43-141; 151-281 MS 2 lacks ll. 1-141; 151-281 MS 3 lacks ll. 85-201 MS 4 lacks the last two words of l. 120 and l. 121; ll. 134-149; 170-281 MS 5 lacks ll. 1-90; 98-281 MS 6 lacks ll. 1-250; 256-281 When there is a variant reading of at least a line for an entire line in the final text, I do not repeat in the notes the line of the final text and do not use a lemma. I give the variant line or lines immediately following the line number.

Twenty early lines related to final lines 171, 185-186 (which exist in Tennyson's wife's autograph on a half-leaf of white laid note-paper, tipped into the Pierpont Morgan copy 1 of the first edition of the Ode ) show the topical antipathy to Napoleon III which was no doubt part of the inspiration of the poem, but which Tennyson subdued in the published version: But O remember him who led your hosts And take his counsel ere too late. There sits a silent man beyond the strait Guard guard guard your coasts. His are all the powers of the state His are all the passions of the rabble A man of silence in a world of babble. Sudden blows are strokes of fate Yet to be true is more than half of great. By the hollow blatant cry Half-godded underneath a scornful sky Their great Napoleons live and die With rolling echoes by the nations heard. But shall we count them Gods who break their word The word is God: thou shalt not lie. Was our great Chief (his life is bare from youth To all men's comment till his latest hour) A man to dodge and shuffle with the Truth And palter with Eternal God for power?

I am grateful to Lord Tennyson for permission to quote from it. 43 The new edition appears in the list of PUBLICATIONS RECEIVED during the week of Feb. 26 to March 5 by the Spectator , XVI (March 5, 1853), 230. For a bibliographical description, see Wise, Bibliography of . . . Tennyson , I, 123. 44 The manuscripts now in the Harvard College Library fail to sustain Hallam Tennyson's contention, "Many of the alterations which appeared in the second edition of the poem were in the original MS." — Poems ( The Works of Tennyson , Eversley Edition, London, 1908), II, 366. "Boundless" for "Most unbounded" (l. 157), "His foes were thine" for "His martial wisdom" (l. 91), and "He" for "The man" (l. 271) are the only instances of return in the second edition to an earlier MS reading that I have discovered. In the light of the extensive corrections and additions that Tennyson made for the 1853 edition, these examples are inconsequential. 45 Correspondence of Henry Taylor , p. 201. In the Memoir , I, 362, Hallam Tennyson omits, without signal, the paragraph of Taylor's letter containing this remark. 46 Memoir , I, 362; Poems (Eversley Edition), II, 366. 47 All line numbers refer to the final text in the Eversley Edition ( Poems , II, 210-221). 48 The germ for ll. 154-155 exists in a deleted passage in MS 4, "Thanks to the high hand of that God who set / This land apart." But this fact does not detract from the possibility that Tennyson's decision to embody the idea in new lines and insert them was influenced by the English Review . 49 Pages 280-281. I am indebted to Professor Leslie A. Marchand for identifying Heraud as the author of this review from the marked files of the Athenaeum , now in the offices of the New Statesman and Nation . For a commentary on Heraud and his reviewing for the Athenaeum , see Marchand, The Athenaeum , pp. 214-215. 50 The text in the Eversley Edition was set up, electrotyped, and copyrighted in 1893. First published in May 1893, six months after Tennyson's death, it includes his last revisions. Hallam Tennyson's notes contain extensive commentary by the poet upon his own works.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Reading of Joseph Carrington Cabell: "A List of Books on Various Subjects Recommended to a Young Man . . . ." by H. Trevor Colbourn</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The variety of source material available to the scrupulous historian is enormous, but for writers on aspects of modern history the greatest reliance has long been upon letters and written documents. Occasionally a biographer might mention that his hero owned a library and could read, but generally the tendency has been to ignore an historical source frequently as revealing a personal correspondence. It should be obvious that to some historical figures a library was fully as personal a thing as a diary — and potentially more honest since many diaries are aimed deliberately at posterity. Certainly it is remarkable that only in the past decade have historians become really conscious of the importance of books as reflecting not only the tastes of a person or an age, but also suggesting much of the origin of ideas and ideals. The most encouraging evidence of such an awakening is perhaps found in the recent Three Presidents and their Books , in which Arthur Bestor looked enquiringly at the reading of Jefferson, David Mearns sought hopefully for the reading interest of Lincoln, and Jonathan Daniels observed the magpie-like reading habits of Franklin Roosevelt. Arthur Bestor was fortunate in having the material to indicate some of the significance of Jefferson's bibliomania, and was immensely aided in this by the prodigious Catalogue of the Library of Thomas Jefferson compiled by Millicent Sowerby. 1 Catalogues, expertly compiled, can be both revealing and instructive to the careful scholar, but taken alone they can be as misleading as the slanted diary. Few people are without unread books on their shelves, and ownership of an unread volume means little. But there are other ways of assessing the importance of books in advising and forming the ideas of the reader: marginalia, or separate note-taking; the bodily transplanting of a passage from a favored book to support a political argument. Franklin, for example, indulged in extensive and critical marginal comments on some of his books; 2 John Adams was occasionally guilty of plagiarism; 3 Jefferson revealed his literary indebtedness in other ways, including protracted notes in his Commonplace Books , 4 and comments and recommendations for reading offered to his correspondents. The worthy recipient of two of Jefferson's book lists was a young fellow Virginian, Joseph Carrington Cabell. Cabell actually received four lists of books for his educational guidance in 1800, and while these lists have long reposed in the Cabell Deposit at the University of Virginia's Alderman Library, none have hitherto been published. Cabell, who has born in Amherst County, like Jefferson attended the College of William and Mary, and was to become best known for his work with Jefferson in securing vital legislative aid for the successful establishment of the University of Virginia. A post-revolutionary Virginia intellectual, Cabell's reading has high relevance to his later career of public service, and it is interesting to note that many of the books he read were also included in the first library of the new University at Charlottesville. Of course, there is an obvious common denominator here: Jefferson (with Madison) largely determined the contents of his University's library, and Jefferson also offered advice to Cabell on books to be read. The first of the Cabell lists of books came from the Virginia jurist, St. George Tucker, who in 1800 was beginning his tenure of three years as professor of law at the College of William and Mary. The Tucker list, as fits its legal origin, leans heavily on the standard law books of the time, volumes studied with varying diligence by all would-be lawyers at the end of the eighteenth century. There is nothing unusual about the volumes cited: everyone knew the writings of Sir Edward Coke, Jean Jacques Burlamaqui, Samuel Pufendorf, and William Blackstone. Alongside the body of reliable legal works, Tucker recommended to young Cabell some interesting and significant political selections. Locke's Essay on Civil Government was a natural choice for an eighteenth-century gentleman, but more curious and revealing was the inclusion of James Burgh's Political Disquisitions , and De Lolme's Constitution d'Angleterre , volumes frequently passed over by scholars unaware of the true political perspective of this revolutionary generation. These same volumes, with many others of similar outlook, are to be found in the two lists sent Cabell by Thomas Jefferson. These lists supply a fascinating insight into the legal, political, and particularly the historical ideas that Jefferson admired and wished others to subscribe to. This is not to suggest that Jefferson wanted to indoctrinate others so that they might share his democratic faith, but rather that he wanted others to be suitably educated so that their reason would be free to recognize the merit of his ideals. Often this Jeffersonian attitude made for a situation perilously akin to propaganda, but in fairness Jefferson was relying ultimately on the exercise of reason—properly equipped—for the right outlook. Jefferson's lists to Cabell are longer and more extensive in their scope than that sent by Tucker. The list outlining a course in English History is thorough and enormously valuable in indicating the books Jefferson relied upon for his historical knowledge. There is a useful chronological coverage supplied by the volumes of Lyttleton, Habington, Herbert, Camden, Macaulay, Clarendon, Ludlow, Burnet, Dalrymple, and Belsham. Other books by Rapin and Baxter, on the second longer list, offered a broader survey, and a guaranteed antidote to the tory heresies of David Hume. The net result was not merely a list of history books for Cabell to read, but a list which would supply a very definite and politically partisan view of the past. Jefferson's historical ideas are not an appropriate topic for extended treatment here, 5 but it must be noted that his reading had led him to a complete adherence to the whig interpretation of history. It was an interpretation deriving from a mistaken reading of Tacitus in part (included in Jefferson's second list to Cabell), where the Roman was found to praise the noble Germans for their simple and democratic existence in the Northern forests. These same Anglo-Saxons then migrated to England, taking along the habits of freedom, and, according to Jefferson's whig historians, would probably have lived happily ever after had it not been for the treachery and subversion of William the Norman in 1066. From that date on, the whigs claimed that English history rang with oppressions, while the virtuous noble Saxons struggled to regain their liberties. Minor gains were reported from King John with Magna Carta (much exaggerated by Coke), more were secured from Charles I, but were lost at the hands of the military despot Oliver Cromwell, and a final if abortive advance had been made towards the pre-Norman, pre-feudal times, with the Glorious Revolution in 1688. However, according to the whigs, this proved a shortlived victory since political corruption in the eighteenth-century demonstrated that septennial parliaments could subvert the popular will as easily as a divine-right monarch. 6 For an American, this view of the past held great attraction and significance. Americans in the eighteenth-century regarded themselves essentially as transplanted Englishmen, with the rights of Englishmen. Their law books, such as Coke's Institutes , and Blackstone's Commentaries , gave a clear if academically erroneous outline of an Englishman's legal status. Faced with printed evidence that the ancient democratic rights of their Anglo-Saxon ancestors were still unrestored as of the 1770's, and indeed were suffering grievously at the hands of parliamentary tyranny, Americans enjoyed a comforting historical justification for revolution and independence which received its classic exposition in Jefferson's Summary View of the Rights of British America in 1774. It matters little that modern scholarship has demonstrated the fallaciousness of the whig interpretation. What does matter is that it was believed implicitly by many Americans, and exponents like Jefferson were determined that the new generation, which included Cabell of course, should be properly read in their ancient heritage of freedom. Whig historians dominated the lists of recommended reading Jefferson sent out, 7 and the two lists received by Cabell were clearly no exception. However, this view of the past was hardly confined to history books. It permeated the philosophizing of Algernon Sidney's Discourses on Government , and James Burgh's Political Disquisitions . Burgh's work is especially interesting since it was published initially in London in 1774, and so impressed American readers that it was promptly reprinted by subscription in Philadelphia. Among its subscribers were most of the Continental Congress, some of whom ordered several of the three-volume sets. 8 Burgh, it might be added, not only preached whig history, but graphically depicted the rottenness of eighteenth-century England as he saw it: he even suggested that if all adulterers in England were flayed alive and their skins cured and sold by the government, the alarmingly large national debt could be paid off forthwith. 9 The last of the four book lists in the Cabell collection was that supplied by Joseph Priestley, and it is the least rewarding. Priestley's "Course of History" is but roughly sketched out, frequently suggestive and unspecific. There is, interestingly, a heavy emphasis upon early English history, and Tacitus would furnish material of a whig background nature. Priestley's suggestions for study are much less political than Jefferson's, and there is more stress on original sources where available. The general content indicates Priestley's greater political disinterestedness, and his unconcern for recent history is a reflection of his antiquarian leanings. But since the antiquarians supplied so much of the material for the whig histories recommended by Jefferson and the whig lawyers urged by Tucker, it is clear that Priestley was also bolstering the historical perspective already evident from the earlier lists. Common historical denominators remain: Tacitus, Verstegan, Rapin, Horne's Mirrour of Justices , Coke, Blackstone, all led in the same whig direction. The preceding remarks constitute only a few hopefully suggestive comments on the contents of the Cabell reading lists. The literary variety so generously offered the young Virginian is such that these lists will mean many things to many scholars: indeed the singular significance of the Cabell lists lies in the many clues to the eighteenth-century mind to be thus gleaned. A political scientist might note, for example, that Rousseau's Social Contract is included in the Tucker list, but not in the Jefferson lists. For those concerned with the French influence upon Jefferson, this is helpful. Montesquieu's Spirit of the Laws figures in both Tucker and Jefferson lists, which would suggest something again of the attraction of a systematic study of the past and present legal structures for the builders of a new American nation. Even a superficial glance at the Cabell lists indicates among other things that the study of history and law went hand in hand with the abstractions of political theory. Further study of the books read and recommended by America's revolutionary generation can supply substantial insights into both the intellectual origins of the American Revolution and the pitfalls consciously avoided by its leadership.

      <field name="heading_text">The Optical Identification of First Formes by Kenneth Povey</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The careful analyst will occasionally wish to identify the first formes in a book under investigation; often, perhaps, to check someone else's assumption that the inner forme was regularly printed first, or to verify a plausible interpretation of skeletons or press-figures. In a crisp, unpressed copy it is usually possible to recognise the first forme by the indentations of the second — a little hillock with ink on its surface occurs wherever a letter in the first-forme page has been indented by a letter of the second forme. This is the easiest way to tell whether an incunable was printed page by page; if, for example, the four pages of a folio sheet were printed in page order, both rectos will bear first-forme impressions and both versos second-forme. In the detection of cancels and similar problems of conjugacy, the method is an alternative to the use of evidence from the indentations of the mould on laid paper and a substitute for it if wove paper is in question. 1 It is the best means of distinguishing concurrent from consecutive perfecting, a matter of great importance in the study of variant formes. If the two formes of a sheet were laid on by two presses at the same time and the pressmen exchanged heaps half-way through the impression, each perfecting the other's work, half the sheets will have first-forme impressions of the outer forme and half of the inner. 2 And as I have pointed out elsewhere, the relationship between indentations will serve to distinguish common imposition in half sheets from the imposition called 'two half sheets worked together'. 3 It is usually very difficult to find a copy in which the unaided eye can recognize the first forme, and the difficulty is more than doubled in some cases by the necessity of comparing two such copies. I have to thank a colleague, Mr. D. G. E. Martin, for advice on the use of optical apparatus to increase the amount of evidence that can be extracted from reluctant-looking material. The requirement is a parallel beam of light which can be directed onto a page of the book, lying within the beam and parallel to it. The effect is to intensify the shadows cast by the convexities of the second-forme impression, thus making them more clearly visible. The apparatus recommended is a microscope lamp, such as a geologist would use, with or without a microscope, to examine a slightly irregular surface. These lamps, generally with a built-in transformer, can be easily obtained from manufacturers of scientific instruments. But microscope lamps are expensive and not easily portable and they depend on the availability of a suitable source of current. It is simple to make a collimator without these disadvantages and effective enough if it is used in a nearly dark room. Bibliographers may, if they wish, call it the Martin Lamp. The device consists of (1) an ordinary front bicycle lamp with a head about 2⅜" in diameter; its normal battery and bulb are used but the glass must be removed and the reflector blackened; (2) a tube, which can be made of rolled paper, to fit on the head of the lamp; (3) a convex lens of similar diameter fixed in the front end of the tube with adhesive tape. A cheap reading-glass with a focal length of about 7" will do very well. The distance between the lens and the source of light (A-B in the diagram) must be equal to the focal length of the lens, and that can be found by measuring the distance from a sheet of paper at which the lens gives the sharpest image of a distant object, for example, some detail of a building across the street. A piece of lead should be put in the slot at the back of the lamp to balance the weight of the tube and lens. No more apparatus is needed because the book can if necessary be supported on another of convenient size and the lamp can be held in the best position by hand. *</field>

Moreover, considerable care is necessary to make sure that inked hillocks are not mere paper irregularities instead of the crucial embossing from the types. For example, it may be that a more powerful light source would materially increase the ease of distinguishing the ink on the rounded tip of a hillock from the contrary examples where the type of the perfecting forme has indented the top of the embossed hillock made by the white-paper forme. Fortunately, an English optical manufacturer has interested himself in the problem, and as this volume goes to press is in process of perfecting a lamp powerful enough to use in daylight and materially more efficient than the home-made model.

      <field name="heading_text">Ralegh and Ayton: The Disputed Authorship of "Wrong Not Sweete Empress of My Heart" by Charles B. Gullans</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of all the disputed poems of the early seventeenth century, "Wrong not, sweete Empress of my heart" presents for several reasons one of the most severe problems. First, there is the fact that in some versions, but not all, the poem begins with a six-line pentameter stanza, riming ababcc , the -c rime being feminine, while the rest of the poem is in quatrains of alternating tetrameter and trimeter lines, riming abab , the -b rime being feminine. Second, the number of copies is very large; and the texts are radically divergent from one another, showing the nicest gradations of corruption and contamination. Any attempt to establish a more or less definitive text would have to suppose the problem of authorship more or less definitely settled, since the chain of authority of the texts would depend on attribution. If one believes Sir Walter Ralegh to be the author, those copies which attribute the poem to him would be taken to form the most authoritative group, and the "ideal" representative of the group, if there is one, would be chosen for a copy-text. But we have a third complication in that there are four claimants for the poem, Sir Walter Ralegh, Sir Robert Ayton, Sir Benjamin Rudyerd, and Lord Walden. In what follows, the available texts of the poem have been treated from the viewpoint of an editor of Ayton; and it is the Ayton MSS., Nos. 1 and 2 below, from which other MSS. are considered to diverge. This is not a mere assumption, but it is necessary to state the fact so that the procedure will be clear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Texts The starred texts below contain the introductory stanza of six lines, "Our Passions are most like to floods and streams," sometimes given as "Passions are likened best to (unto) floods and streams." It will be noted that in every instance where the preliminary stanza is found, the poem is attributed to Ralegh. 1. British Museum, MS. Additional 10308 , fols. 9 v -10. This is a MS. of Ayton's poems compiled at some time shortly after 1660 by his nephew and heir, Sir John Ayton, who has frequently corrected the MS. at whim. His corrections in this poem are supported by manuscript tradition. See the notes to lines 26 and 28 of the poem. A transcription is given in The Oxford Book of Seventeenth Century Verse , pp. 85-86. 2. B. M. MS. Additional 28622 , fol. 18 r-v . This is a MS. of Ayton's poems, compiled perhaps in the 1670's by a "naive" copyist. It represents a different MS. tradition from No. 1 and, at least for some poems, an older tradition before authorial revisions. For this poem it gives a text in substantial agreement with No. 1, but with a few errors of transcription. 3. Edinburgh University Library, MS. Laing III, 436 , pp. 20-21. Headed: Songe. This is an early seventeenth-century poetical miscellany which is unusual in that it gives copies of 18 poems by Ayton, the largest number contained in any such miscellany. Some of the poems it gives are known otherwise only from the Ayton MSS., a fact which suggests that the compiler had unique access to Ayton's work. The texts of the poems given frequently differ substantially from the Ayton MSS. This may suggest either that the versions are early or that the copyist was careless. On the whole the former seems more likely, since the variant readings are always possible and sensible readings. The text which it gives of this poem is fair, but it introduces some unique readings and some blunders of transcription. * 4. B. M. MS. Additional 25303 , fol. 118 r-v . Subscribed: Sir W: R. * 5. B.

Huntington 198 , p. 165. The text of this poem and its ascription present the most difficult problem of the entire canon. Who wrote the poem and what text to print are questions which admit of no certain answer. At best one can advance solutions which appear to account for the facts, but such solutions must be taken as provisional. The number of manuscript texts of the poem is very large, but must nevertheless represent a mere fragment of the number of copies which were made, for the texts that we have are contaminated, one with another, to such an extraordinary degree that the relationship of the texts does not allow of accurate definition. A collation of three miscellany, and six fragmentary, and seventeen complete manuscript versions (Nos. 16, 18, 19; 22-27; and 1-15) shows that, while the texts have a tendency to break down into groups, a large number of them shift from one group to another on different readings and display no consistent pattern in doing so. The texts which show a more or less constant affinity are Nos. 1-3; Nos. 4-6; Nos. 8-10; and Nos. 11-12. Nos. 1-3 are the only texts which show a constant uniformity in themselves (although No. 3 gives a number of unique readings). Naturally on some readings where the number of variants is small, the other groups or single manuscripts sometimes fall in with them. Nos. 4-6, for example, although they constitute a definite group of readings, are not consistent; No. 6 introduces, like No. 3, several readings peculiar to itself, and on occasion falls in with other groups. Nos. 7-9 are another fairly constant group with which No. 10 falls in as often as it diverges from it. What I am arguing then is simply this: it is impossible to construct a definitive text for poems derived from such sources as we are considering by any method of collation and comparison of the texts themselves, for there is nothing to provide the principle that determines which reading is a variant and which the original. This is particularly true of MSS. that do not fall into definite groups, but it is also true of MSS. which form definite and apparently derivative groups. 2 For example, there are 16 MSS. and printed texts of another Ayton poem, "Thou sent to mee a heart was Crown'd," which fall into six groups, the "first and true" state represented by the Ayton MSS., and five states of progressive corruption. The corruptions of Group Two are not found in Group One. The corruptions of Group Three include those of Group Two and new ones of its own. The corruptions of Group Four include those of Group Three and new ones of its own. And the Fifth Group derives from the Third without contamination from the Fourth. But it might be just as conveniently argued that Group Three was the "first and true" state and that three lines of corruption emerged from it. It is only by the assumption that the poem is by Ayton and that the version of the Ayton MSS. is the most authoritative text that the progressive line of corruption and the derivation of groups can be shown. There is no doubt about the authorship of this poem, so that the assumptions have a certain necessary force; without them, there would be no possibility of a definitive text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Copy-Text and Notes I have taken for my copy-text MS. Add. 10308 which is generally supported by MS. Add. 28622 and Laing . Sir John has made some emendations which cannot be dismissed, since they are supported either by MS. Add. 28622 or by Laing . The variant readings for this poem will generally be cited by a number which indicates how many manuscripts give that reading; since there are so many texts and since they are of such shifting loyalty, it would be confusing rather than helpful to cite them individually in the notes. Only texts 1-15 are included in the notes. Texts 22-27, being fragmentary and otherwise corrupt, are of no textual validity. Texts 16-19, the miscellany texts, are late, partially corrupt, and in any case representative of texts included in the manuscript versions cited. No. 27 I have seen but not collated. Nos. 28-31 I have not seen, although they have been collated by Miss Latham in her text of the poem.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Authorship of the Poem There are four claimants to the poem, Ayton, Ralegh, Rudyerd, and Walden. The last two claims can be dismissed offhand. Rudyerd's claim cannot stand because the volume purporting to contain his and Pembroke's poems is in fact a carelessly edited anthology of seventeenth-century poems. It does contain poems by both Pembroke and Rudyerd, but the mere presence of any poem in this volume constitutes evidence of nothing but the taste of the editor. Walden's claim we may dismiss, since it is advanced by two fragmentary texts (Nos. 22-23). 3 Nos. 1 and 2 give the poem to Ayton. Nine manuscripts give the poem to Ralegh; six of these have the preliminary stanza (Nos. 4-5, 10, 11, 13, 16), and three do not (Nos. 6, 7, and 9). The editor of Wit's Interpreter gives it to him in one instance, also (No. 16). Thirteen manuscripts (and two miscellanies) assign the poem to no author; of these, seven manuscripts have all eight stanzas of the second part of the poem (Nos. 3, 8, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 19), and six give partial texts (Nos. 21 and 24-28). The number of texts in any category here is of little significance. Nos. 4-6 are the same text, as are Nos. 21-23, Nos. 24-25, and Nos. 26-27. Thus, Nos. 4-6 each give the poem to Ralegh, but their attribution has only the force of one, since they are texts of the same group; and No. 5 is actually a transcript of No. 4. This is the familiar principle of agreement in error, the formulation of which is due, I believe, to Dr. Johnson. If we were to settle the problems of authorship merely on the quantity of manuscript ascriptions to a given author, we should have to reassign half the poems of the early seventeenth century, and frequently in the face of superior evidence. My argument is briefly this: (1) the preliminary stanza is probably by Ralegh; (2) it is not part of the longer poem, (3) but became confused with it for fairly obvious reasons such as similarity of subject; and (4) the poem beginning at "Wrong not . . ." is probably by Ayton. The preliminary stanza cannot be considered part of the poem, regardless of one's opinion of the authorship of either part. It differs with respect to form in rime scheme and line length from the rest of the poem; and with respect to genre and the procedure that any given genre enforces, for it was conceived as an epigram, a concise expression of a general idea, and is complete in itself. An argument from form concerning any Renaissance poem should be convincing in itself; such a combination of rime schemes and line lengths is almost unknown in the Renaissance and is completely unparalleled by any other poem by Ayton or Ralegh. The argument from genre is at least as important: the second part is a discursive lyric, a song, written in a style which is diffuse in comparison with that of the preliminary stanza. The following text of the epigram is from MS. Rawl. poet. 160 (No. 11, above). Our passions are most like to floodes &amp; streames The shallow murmur, but the deep are dumb Soe when affections yield discourse it seems the bottome is but shallow whence they come they y t are rich in wordes must needes discover that they are poore in y t w ch maks a lover . . . It has been suggested to me by Dr. C. F. Main that the two poems became confused as one through the habit of noting poems into commonplace books under topic headings, such as Woman's Love or, in this instance, Passions. The practice was sufficiently frequent for the suggestion to be convincing; such an explanation would account for the consistent attribution to Ralegh when the two parts are given and for the frequent omission of any author in those manuscripts which give only the second part. Furthermore, such an explanation seems to have occurred even in the seventeenth century, for some texts which give only the second part belong to groups which give both parts: No. 6 constitutes a group with 4 and 5, and No. 8 a group with 7 and 9. The only conclusion that can be reached is that the copyists of Nos. 6 and 8 thought the two parts two distinct poems and separated them. If we assume for the moment that the second part is by Ayton, such an explanation helps to explain why some texts of the second part only are subscribed Ralegh . By far the most weighty evidence, however, is the fact that Nos. 1 and 2 are compilations of Ayton's poetry alone, and that they are of the highest possible authority, barring a holograph, for the poems which they contain. They give very few doubtful poems, and the doubts about such poems as have been disputed have been raised by very late evidence, such as the ascriptions in Lawes's song books, or suppositious evidence, such as the ascription by modern editors of poems found in manuscripts associated with other authors such as Drummond or Fowler. Miss Latham argues that "neither of the manuscript books professing to contain his [Ayton's] poems has his authority" ( op. cit. , p. 116), but this is more of an argument against Ralegh than for, since none of the manuscripts of which we know is devoted to Ralegh's poetry alone. It should in fairness be said, however, that Miss Latham states the case for Ayton's authorship of the second part as fully and dispassionately as she states the case for Ralegh's authorship of the whole. In conclusion, it must be said that the whole argument advanced here is suppositious itself, and in the extreme, but that it appears to account for more of the facts presented by the available texts than any other argument that has been presented. This is not to say that it is true nor that it will prove persuasive; an editor hopes that his arguments are true, but it is not for him to decide whether they are persuasive or not.

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of Beaumont and Fletcher's The Maid's Tragedy Q1 (1619) by Robert K. Turner, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although nine editions of Beaumont and Fletcher's The Maid's Tragedy appeared before 1700, critical attention is centered on the first two. Q1, which was printed in 1619 by Nicholas Okes for Francis Constable and Richard Higgenbotham, has been labelled "curtailed and frequently corrupt." 1 It is about eighty lines shorter than subsequent editions; yet it contains a few lines that do not appear elsewhere. Q2, printed in 1622 by George Purslowe for Constable alone, supplies the lines which are not in Q1, and, in addition, makes a number of other changes in single words and phrases throughout the play. The texts of all subsequent editions derive from Q2. 2 All of the editors of The Maid's Tragedy , from Dyce to Hazelton Spencer, have based their editions on Q2 while occasionally introducing readings from Q1 on eclectic principles. But, as I have argued elsewhere, 3 such a procedure is not acceptable for an old-spelling critical edition, since it can be shown that Q2 was printed from an annotated copy of Q1. 4 Therefore, to the Beaumont and Fletcher critic the printing of Q1 is a matter of some concern. In addition, the shop which produced Q1 also printed within a period of a few years Othello Q1 (1622), The Duchess of Malfi Q1 (1623), and those monuments to editorial frustration, Philaster Q1 (1620) and Q2 (1622). It is hoped, then, that the insight into Okes's operations provided by this study will be of interest to students of those plays. Of The Maid's Tragedy Q1, Greg notes, "The text was printed in two sections, B-G and H-L, in slightly different types: in the first the speakers' names are set in small-caps, in the second in italic, but they are not indented in either. This might suggest that the copy was divided between two compositors, and that there had been an earlier edition. It is, however, more likely that composition was interrupted, and that on resumption the original type was not available, or possibly that the work was completed at another press." 5 Since the compilation of the Bibliography , many investigators have found that copy can be divided between two compositors, and as a result of this division different parts of a printed book can exhibit different characteristics, without there having been an earlier edition. No edition of The Maid's Tragedy seems to have appeared before 1619 and it is not necessary to assume that there was one to explain the differences between the two sections. That the second section of the book was printed simultaneously with the first is a possibility that must be considered; however, if it turns out that this was the case, Okes could not then be the printer of the second section because it is very unlikely that he had more than one press in 1619. 6 The two sections are clearly set apart from each other not only by the differences in the typography of the speech-prefixes but also by a variation in the speech-prefix abbreviations: the tag for Calianax is predominantly Cal. in the first section and Call . in the last and that for Aspatia is invariably Asp. in the first section and Aspat . in the last. In addition, there is a clear break in the running titles between the two parts: the skeleton forme (I) that was used to impose B(i) was also used for C(o), D(i), E(o), F(i), and G(o), whereas a second skeleton forme (II) was used for B(o), C(i), D(o), E(i), F(o) turned, and G(i). At sheet H, however, two new skeleton formes (III and IV) were constructed and were used as follows: III H(i), I(o), K(i), and L(i); and IV H(o), I(i) turned, K(o), and L(o). The only irregularity in the transfer of the formes from sheet to sheet occurs when skeleton I was moved from D(i) to E(o): here the same running-titles that were used in D(i) reappear but their arrangement in the forme has been changed. Additional information about the printing of the book can be obtained from typographical evidence, derived principally from a shortage of the small capitals used in the first section for the setting of the speech-prefixes and an occasional stage direction. Okes ordinarily reserved this font for such purposes as the composition of chapter headings, subordinate lines in title-pages, and proper names in stage directions, and in these instances the supply of type was adequate for the demand placed upon it. But when the small-capital font was used for speech-prefixes, as in The Maid's Tragedy Q1, Albumazar Q2 (1615), and Lingua Q1 (1617), the frequency of occurrence of identical speech tags was so great that certain sorts ran low. In order to make up these deficiencies, letter from a smaller font of small capitals was introduced in all three plays. In Albumazar Q2 there is a mixture of l's, a's, r's, and e's, whereas in Lingua Q1 a mixture of e's and m's is found. In Albumazar Q2 the substitution of the small for the large small capitals was systematic enough in some instances to permit an insight into the method of composition. 6a Similarly, the pattern of shortages in The Maid's Tragedy Q1 reveals a good deal about the way in which its compositors worked. Before this matter is examined further, the effect of type shortages on quarto printing practices should be clarified. Professor Bowers has made the point that the supply of type available to the compositor could dictate the choice between one- or two-skeleton printing. 7 When the latter method was employed, and when proof was to be obtained, it was necessary under normal conditions to have a minimum of fifteen type pages standing at any time during the course of printing (four on the press, four on the distributing bench, and seven on the imposing stone), but when the former was used the minimum number of type pages standing could be reduced to eleven (four on the press and seven on the stone). To a compositor setting from a low case, the one-skeleton method would be attractive for this reason, but in one-skeleton work the press was forced to stand idle not only while corrections were made in the type of the forme being machined, but also while any forme was being imposed. When two skeletons were used, however, one was always free to impose the next forme to be machined, and the interval occasioned by the correction of the forme being machined could be used to proof the next forme. 8 When proof was to be taken, two-skeleton printing was therefore more efficient and more desirable than one-skeleton, if the supply of type was adequate to permit its use. Professor Bowers' count of fifteen standing pages in two-skeleton proofing supposes that the compositor would not ordinarily distribute type from a wrought-off and rinsed forme before he had a new forme ready for the press, that is, until type page $4 had been set. Indeed, in order for any advantage to be gained in proofing by two skeletons rather than by one, the perfecting forme of a new sheet had to be imposed by the time the corrected proof of the first forme had been returned. But if the supply of type was insufficient to allow fifteen pages to be standing, special measures had to be adopted. Professor Bowers indicates that the compositor of Lear Q1, when faced with a type-shortage problem, stripped the quarters of the wrought-off forme before composition of the next sheet was completed, imposed the old furniture and running-titles about the new type, and then distributed the type from the stripped quarters of the wrought-off forme. If this method was used and the composition was in perfect balance with the presswork, there would be four pages of the new sheet ($1, 1v, 2, and 2v) on the stone at the end of the machining of the first forme of the preceding sheet; therefore, it would be possible to reduce the number of standing pages to twelve. 9 However, there was a further refinement of the two-skeleton method which enabled the printer to reduce the minimum number of standing pages to this number while retaining all of the advantages of two-skeleton printing. Professor Bowers' analysis was based on the assumption that the compositor would set seriatim, but, if the copy was cast off so that pages could be set out of order, the pages of the new sheet on the stone at the end of the machining of the first forme of the old could be either the inner or the outer forme of the new sheet ($1, 2v, 3, 4v or $1v, 2, 3v, 4) rather than the first four pages. In this case the pages on the stone would correspond in their position in the forme to the pages of the wrought-off forme, and all four quarters of the wrought-off forme could be stripped and the type distributed immediately. The standing-type pages could in this manner be reduced, before distributing, to a minimum of twelve, and the amount of type in the boxes could be kept at a maximum. Of course, before the compositor could set by formes it was necessary that his copy be cast off with some accuracy. 10 Moxon described two methods for casting off manuscript, 11 but implied that neither permitted very accurate fitting of the copy, particularly if the manuscript was in an irregular hand. In addition, both methods were complicated and must have required a considerable amount of time to perform for a book of any size. However, it is obvious that Moxon described the casting off of prose; the entire procedure must have been much less complex when the copy consisted substantially of verse lines. Once the copy was cast off, the compositor could fall to setting at any convenient point, and one imagines that this fact alone would have been enough to recommend setting by formes in instances where there was no question of a type shortage. Not only could the first forme to be machined be delivered to the press at the earliest possible moment, but also the relationship between the speed of composition and the speed of the press became more flexible since an alert workman could take advantage of a choice between setting more or less difficult matter if such a choice existed. 12 The compositor of the first section of The Maid's Tragedy Q1, perhaps influenced by a shortage of the small capitals chosen for setting the speech-prefixes as well as of certain sorts in the roman font used for the text of the play, apparently elected to set by formes. In order to show that this method was adopted, it is first necessary to consider the difficulties that would have arisen if the book had been composed seriatim. The text of the play begins on sig. B1. In sheets B and C the following distribution of small capitals is found (the number to the left of the slash represents capitals of the larger size; that to the right the smaller): B 1 1v 2 2v 3 3v 4 4v e 4/0 3/1 6/0 3/0 3/1 2/1 0/7 0/3 l 4/0 4/0 5/1 3/0 4/0 5/3 2/10 0/9 C 1 1v 2 2v 3 3v 4 4v e 0/1 2/0 6/0 0/0 2/0 1/0 0/0 0/0 l 0/2 0/0 4/1 1/0 0/2 6/4 0/8 0/2 This pattern may have resulted either from seriatim setting or from setting by formes. If seriatim setting is posited, it must be argued that the one small e on B1v and the small l on B2 were used accidentally rather than deliberately substituted. Then, while setting B3 the compositor noticed that his supply of large e's was running low, and he attempted to eke them out by the occasional substitution of small e's in B3 and B3v. However, his stock of the large letter was gone when he began B4, so that B4, B4v, and C1 were composed with the small e's exclusively. About the same situation obtained for the l's. The substitution of small for large letters commenced on B3v, but by the time half of B4 was set all of the large type was used. Small l's then were employed exclusively from about the middle of B4 through C1. At C1v, however, large e's reappear and no more small e's appear in sheet C. Large l's reappear at C2 (there having been no occurrence of l on C1v) and throughout the rest of the sheet show a pattern of depletion similar to that of sheet B. It appears that between the setting of C1 and C1v a new supply of large e's and l's was obtained, and it seems possible that the source of these letters was the first forme of sheet B to be sent to the press. And indeed several pieces of type which were used in B(o) reappear in C: the " S " of " Scœn ." (B1) is found in " Secundus " (C3v); the "m" of "time" (B1, l. 21) is found in "Madame" (C4v, l. 9); and the "y" of "your" (B2v, l. 17) is found in "my" (C3, l. 15). The forme distributed after the setting of C1 must, then, have been B(o), which, it follows, would have been delivered to the press before B(i). However, if the outer were the first form of B to be printed, problems arise in connection with the hypothetical seriatim setting of B unless a long delay is posited between the setting of B4v and the time of distribution of B(o). Under ideal conditions a compositor should have been able to set and distribute about four type pages in the same amount of time required by the press to machine one forme, but in this case the interval that elapsed during the machining of B(o) would have been occupied only by the setting of C1. Such a long press delay (the time required for the compositor to set three pages) was, of course, possible, but another hypothesis which accounts for the evidence while eliminating the delay would be preferable to one including it. It may also be argued that sheet B was set by formes, in which case the pattern of small caps is B 1 2v 3 4v 1v 2 3v 4 e 4/0 3/0 3/1 0/3 3/1 6/0 2/1 0/7 l 4/0 3/0 4/0 0/9 4/0 5/1 5/3 2/10 Here it must be assumed that the type used in another book 13 was distributed between the setting of B4v and B1v. If this assumption is allowed, it is seen that a clear pattern of depletion and resupply of the large letter emerges. It should be mentioned that there is no clear line of division between the use of the large type and the small on pages where the two are mixed. On B3, for instance, the small e is the next to last of the four e's used on the page, and on B3v the small l's are numbers three, seven, and eight of the eight l's appearing. It has been noted earlier that the two sizes do not appear mixed except in the three plays where the demand for particular sorts was abnormally high; the large font appears unfouled in several books produced in the years between the printing of the plays. Moreover, if the sizes were kept mixed in a single case one would have expected to find at least an occasional small r in the speech prefix Stra. of The Maid's Tragedy since small r's had appeared previously in Albumazar Q2; but Stra. appears with large r's throughout. One concludes that after the earlier plays were printed the two sizes were sorted out and returned to their own cases. When the small type was needed once more for The Maid's Tragedy it was again added to the case of the larger type a few sorts at a time. The more-or-less random mixture of the two sizes on certain pages would indicate only that the compositor did not completely exhaust his supply of large type before replenishing his stock with the small. Since no other explanation for the distribution of the two sizes of type in sheet B presents itself, it seems that, on the evidence, one must decide in favor of the setting of that sheet by formes rather than seriatim. The method of composition was, of course, intimately related to the order of imposition of the formes and the order of the formes through the press, evidence relating to which is available from the pattern of running titles. If B(o) were the first forme to be machined, the pattern of running titles indicates that the order of imposition of the remaining formes of the first section was B(i)-C(i)-C(o)-D(o)-D(i)-E(i)-E(o)-F(o)-F(i)-G(i)-G(o). Such a regular alternation between the prior imposition of the outer and then the inner formes of succeeding sheets can hardly have been fortuitous, and, since there was a shortage of type, one can be reasonably sure that the order of imposition was also the order of composition. If the first sheet were set by formes, it is reasonable to suppose that there was some connection between this procedure and the rather curious order of composition of the remaining formes. It must be remembered, first of all, that the printing of a play was a commercial venture in which there was probably a fairly narrow margin between profit and loss, and that one of the major items of expense in such a job was the paper required. If one edition-sheet could represent the difference between making money and losing money, we would expect the master printer or compositor to cast off the copy with some care so that the exact amount of paper needed for the book could be purchased or otherwise obtained. Only in this way could the risk of wasting paper be minimized. 14 One supposes that the whole book would have to be cast off for this purpose; therefore, when typesetting began, it is probable that a typical manuscript was marked in such a way as to show what portion of the handwriting was to "get in" a specific page. 15 When the casting off had been done properly, it then became the compositor's responsibility to make sure that the typeset text stayed within the estimated total number of sheets. The marks on the manuscript would serve to warn him at the end of every page of the degree of conformity between his actual and estimated progress. If he was running over or under, it behooved him to conserve or waste space in some way so that the actual space consumed would be brought back into line with the estimate. If the book was being set by formes, however, special problems would arise. Assume that composition began with the outer forme of the first sheet. The text of sig. $1 of the outer forme would, of course, have to adjoin the text of sig. $1v of the inner forme, and sigs. $2v and $3 would have to adjoin respectively the text of sigs. $2 and $3v of the inner forme. Sig. $4v, in its turn, would adjoin sig. $4. By setting in the order $1, 2v, 3, 4v the compositor established very definite limits for the beginning and ending of the pages of the inner forme. Later, in setting consecutively from the top of $1v to the bottom of $2 and from the top of $3v to the bottom of $4, he was forced to adjust the white space, make double lines of type of single MS lines or vice versa, or take other steps to come out exactly on the line, or in prose passages, the word, dictated by the previously set outer forme pages. Opportunities to adjust space could be created by a good workman in a number of places, but these opportunities were not limitless. Obviously, if an adjustment had to be made, there was a much better chance of making it smoothly in two pages than one. Therefore, it would have been to the compositor's advantage to arrange, wherever possible, to set consecutively pages the text of which would adjoin one another in the finished book. If the priority of the setting of the inner and the outer formes of succeeding sheets were alternated, every third sheet the compositor would find an additional opportunity to set adjoining pages consecutively ( e.g. , C4v-D1). The following graph shows how this procedure would work out (adjoining pages that would be set consecutively are underlined): B1, 2v-3, 4v, 1v-2, 3v-4, C1v-2, 3v-4, 1, 2v-3, 4v-D1, 2v-3, 4v, 1v-2, 3v-4. On the other hand, if the outer (or inner) forme were always set first, this arrangement could be produced: B1, 2v-3, 4v, 1v-2, 3v-4, C1, 2v-3, 4v, 1v-2, 3v-4, D1, 2v-3, 4v, 1v-2, 3v-4. When the priority of the setting of the outer and inner formes is alternated, it is seen (as Professor Bowers has suggested to me) that pages the texts of which adjoin are set consecutively ten times every three sheets; when the outer (or inner) forme is always set first the number of adjacent pages set consecutively is reduced to nine. Thus, in six sheets alternate prior setting of the inner and outer formes of succeeding sheets would produce twenty such opportunities as opposed to eighteen produced by the regular alternation, in nine sheets thirty as opposed to twenty-seven, and so on. For the first section of The Maid's Tragedy , which consisted of only six sheets, the advantage given by this method was slight, but the pattern of the running-titles argues strongly for its use. If sheet B was set by formes, outer first, and the compositor maintained something near the ideal time relationship with his press, he should have just completed the setting of B(i) when the machining of B(o) was completed, provided of course that B(o) had been put on the press shortly after its imposition. He would have had time, then, to set only four more type pages before B(i) was returned from the press, and, if a press delay was to be avoided, these four type pages should have been the right ones to make up a new forme. In other words, once he started to set by formes the odds are that a compositor would continue to set by formes as long as the press kept pace with him. Hence, one has some reason to suspect that sheet C was also set by formes, and, from the running-title evidence, that C(i) was set before C(o). Thus, the assumptions previously made about the time of distribution of B(o) must be revised. With the summary rearranged by formes, the distribution of e's and l's in sheet C is C 1 v 2 3 v 4 1 2 v 3 4 v e 2/0 6/0 1/0 0/0 0/1 0/0 2/0 0/0 l 0/0 4/1 6/4 0/8 0/2 1/0 0/2 0/2 If this table represents the correct order of composition, there is evidence, small though it is, for two distributions rather than one as previously supposed. The resumption of the use of large e's on C1v indicates that one distribution was made before the setting of that page; the appearance of a piece of type from B(o) on C3v, mentioned earlier, shows that the forme distributed must have been B(o). This forme contained fourteen e's, ten large and four small, and twenty l's, eleven large and nine small. All indications are that the compositor, seeing no point in keeping the two sizes separated, distributed both into his case on top of the small e's and l's remaining after the setting of B(i). Obviously, as this indiscriminate distribution of the two sizes continued they would tend to become more thoroughly mixed and hence would be of progressively less value as evidence. In sheet C, however, the pattern of depletion and resupply that characterized sheet B has not yet been entirely obscured, and one can see ten of the eleven large l's provided by the distribution of B(o) being used up before the small l's appear exclusively on C4 and C1. Moreover, the shift from small to large l's at C2v (reinforced by the appearance of large e's on C3) suggests that another distribution may have taken place before the setting of C2v. But would these times of distribution be consistent with the progress of the press during the time required to set the formes considered so far? As I have said, under ideal conditions the press could machine one forme in about the amount of time required to set one forme and distribute another. If B(o), the first forme composed, were delivered to the press soon after its imposition, it would have been printed and returned to the compositor for distribution by the time he distributed type from the unknown book which preceded The Maid's Tragedy through the press and set B(i). B(o), then, would have been available for distribution before the setting of C(i) began. While B(i) was being machined, the compositor would have been occupied with the distribution of B(o) and the setting of C(i). Under these conditions, B(i) would have come from the press at about the same time as the imposition of C(i), or, if the evidence of the small capitals in sheet C can be trusted, probably after the composition of C1 began. The relationship between the compositor and the press may be graphed: In sheet D, which is nearly devoid of e's and which required but two l's (which are of the larger size), another type shortage is manifest which supports the method of composition advocated so far. In this instance the shortage appears in the roman capital I's of the text rather than the speech-pre-fixes. The following table shows the pattern of roman I's from the font used in sheets B and C (on the left of the slash and from a smaller font (on the right): D 1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 I (text) 13/0 16/0 9/0 6/9 17/1 8/11 10/1 12/1 On D4v five large I's appear in the first eight lines of letterpress. The first small I's show up in lines 9 and 11 and are followed by one more large I in line 12. From line 12 through the rest of the page small i's appear exclusively. The text of D1v is set entirely with the larger sort; the one small I is found in the catchword. On D2 all of the large I's are clustered in the lines from 14 through 22; before and after that point small I's are found. On D3v and D4 the small I's appear near the bottom of the page. The pattern of I's suggests that two distributions took place during the composition of D, one between the setting of D4v and D1v and the other between D2 and D3v. However, if this were the case, a long and inexplicable delay in the presswork would have occurred. Resuming the graph of the relationship between the press and the compositor, one sees that C(i) would have come off the press at about the time of the imposition of C(o) and would have been succeeded on the press by that forme. Then, if composition and presswork stayed in balance, C(o) would have been machined during the time interval occupied by the distribution of C(i) and the setting of D(o) and should have been ready for distribution before the setting of D1v. Under these conditions the shortage of I's in D(o) can be explained without difficulty since C(i) contained only thirty-one pieces of the large sort, whereas forty-three I's were required to set the text occupying D1, 2v, 3, and the first eight lines of D4v. But since C(o) contained thirty pieces of the large sort and none of the small, it is hard to understand why there is evidence of short supply at the bottom of D1v when that page had required but seventeen pieces. Moreover, if C(o) were distributed between the setting of D4v and D1v, the next forme available for distribution would have been D(o). Had this forme been distributed between the setting of D2 and D3v, D(i) could not have gone to press before at least a part of D(o) had been distributed and D3v and D4 had been composed. All things considered, this is not a very encouraging picture. It is possible, however, to account for the evidence on other grounds if it is supposed (1) that the distribution of C(o) was delayed until after the setting of the first thirteen lines of D2, and (2) that the small I's were added to the compositor's case in two steps (the first at the time of setting the ninth line of D4v and the second at the time of setting the catchword of D1v) rather than one. In this case the graph would appear: C(o) should have been off the press and available for distribution at about the time of the imposition of D(o). However, the textual matter contained in D(o) and D1v would probably have presented little difficulty in composition, and indeed a number of short lines are found on the five pages. At any rate, there is nothing in these pages which would have precluded the possibility of the compositor's gaining on the press to the extent of a page and a third. Probably a page or two of C(o) 16 was distributed as soon as the forme came from the press and during the setting of D2, thereby accounting for the cluster of large I's on that page, and the remaining pages were stripped and disposed of before the setting of D3v. The distribution of C(o) before the setting of D3v is further substantiated by the fact that two pieces of type which had been used in C(o) reappear on D3v: the "m" of "Madame" (C4v, l. 9) is found in "me" (D3v, l.9) and the "h" of "lighten" (C3, l. 24) is found in "hot" (D3v, l. 18). 17 After sheet D the e's, l's, and m's of the speech-prefixes appear in a random mixture, as do the I's of the text except upon one occasion which will be mentioned later. However, in sheet E several more letters from the small-capital font make their debut. Their arrangement is E 1v 2 3v 4 1 2v 3 4v I 3/0 9/0 7/6 4/13 0/0 6/6 1/6 10/1 N 1/0 3/0 9/0 16/0 1/3 7/2 6/0 9/2 P 3/0 6/1 0/5 0/0 3/2 0/3 0/1 0/0 S 3/0 1/0 0/0 0/0 2/3 0/0 0/0 0/0 T 1/0 2/5 0/2 1/0 0/3 0/0 0/1 0/0 Here it is once again possible to see a gradual depletion of the large letter and a resultant increase of the small until type was distributed after E3. However, there is evidence indicating that D(o) was distributed before this point: the "s" of "seeme" (D4v, l. 20) appears in "spare" (E2, l. 32); and the "y" of "you" (D1, l. 23) is found in "my" (E3, l. 25). If the graph of composition and presswork is continued, it is seen that D(o) was probably distributed either just after E1v was set or perhaps just after the setting of E began, and that it was D(i) which was distributed between E3 and E4v: From D(o) the following small capitals would have been distributed into the case: twelve i's, eleven n's, three p's, four s's: (three large and one small), and one t. If, as the time-schedule indicates, the distribution of D(o) took place at about the time that E1v was completed, the shortages that appear on E2, E3v, and the remaining pages of the sheet can be explained by the fact that an insufficient number of pieces of the large type was made available by the distribution. However, these data also indicate that the workman did not wait until the last piece of type was gone before he replenished his stock. The only sorts that should have been in short supply when the composition of E began were i's and n's: thirty-four large i's and thirty-three n's had been used in the composition of D(i) (at this time on the press) and E1v. This was a far greater number of both sorts that required in sheets B and C. But there should have been a fair number of large p's, s's, and t's on hand. Fifteen large p's had been used in sheet C and only three were in D(i) and E1v; fifteen large s's were used in sheet B and again three were standing; and eighteen large t's were used in sheet C and once more three were standing. Nevertheless, small letters seem to have been added to the p, s, and t boxes before the point on E2 where dialogue between Strato and Diphilus (speech prefixes, Stra. and Diph.) begins, probably in an effort to keep the type in these boxes at a convenient level. It is possible that small s's were added to the boxes at the same time. 18 One other evidence of type shortage in sheet E is worthy of comment. The roman capital of the speech-prefixes was of the same font as the capitals used in the text; therefore, a severe demand was imposed on certain sorts in this font when a number of speech-prefixes beginning with the same letter happened to occur in conjunction with portions of the text that also required that letter to be capitalized. The speech-prefixes and text of D(i) and E1v had required a total of fifty-five roman A's, a larger number than had been used in any previous forme. The distribution of D(o) added twenty-nine A's to the box, but these pieces were quickly consumed, for, as luck would have it, the remainder of sheet E contained dialogue between Aspatia and Antiphila as well as lines belonging to Amintor. Setting the speech prefixes for these characters and capitalizing the requisite text letters seem to have exhausted the supply of roman A's, so that when the compositor reached the bottom of E3 he was forced to set three speech-prefixes as A min rather than Amin. The substitution of italic for roman A's in speech-prefixes occurs only in this place; therefore, it appears that type must have been distributed, and the supply of A's augmented after the setting of E3. The forme distributed, as it has been shown, was probably D(i). In sheet F the sizes of the small capitals are indiscriminately mixed in the speech-prefixes and, therefore, provide no evidence for the order of the composition of the pages. However, one would expect the sheet to be set in the same manner as the preceding sheets: That this arrangement is at least partially correct is shown by the fact that type from E(i) appears on F3v: the "o" of "no" (E3v, l. 4) is found in "know" (F3v, l.29), and the second "p" of "Suppose" (E1v, l. 15) is found in "friendship" (F3v, l. 30). E(i), then, was distributed at some time before the setting of F3v was completed. That this time was probably between the setting of F4v and F1v is indicated by the pattern of roman and italic A's in the sheet. In the following tabulation the number of roman A's is shown on the left of the slash and the number of italic A's substituted for roman on the right. F 1 2v 3 4v 1v 2 3v 4 A/ A 8/0 3/0 6/4 3/5 9/0 10/0 7/5 9/2 The method of substituting the italic for the roman type was unusual. It will be recalled that on one previous occasion, on E3, the compositor substituted italic for roman in three speech-prefixes, but one judges that this use of the italic was not to his taste. In setting both formes of sheet F he seems to have attempted to save his decreasing store of roman A's for the speech-prefixes by substituting italic for roman in the text only, while there were still roman A's in the box. The resumption of the exclusive use of roman A's on F1v would indicate that the supply of this sort was probably augmented by the distribution of E(i) after the setting of F4v; the fact that italic for roman A's do not appear after F4 would indicate that E(o) was distributed after the setting of that page. The reason for the shortage of roman A's in F3 and F4v, as well as F3v and F4, is not far to seek. The substitution of italic for roman A's in the speech-prefixes of sheet E took place when there were 116 roman A's in the standing type. 19 When the composition of sheet F was commenced, both E(o), containing thirty-seven roman A's, and E(i), containing forty-two, were standing. F1 required eight pieces of this type and F2v three; thus the total standing was raised to ninety. It was at this point (on F3) that the compositor first began to stretch his supply of roman A's by the fairly consistent use of italic for roman in the text. Nevertheless, by the time the composition of F(o) was completed, ninety-nine roman A's had been used. The distribution of E(i) provided thirty-seven pieces, thus reducing the number of standing roman A's to sixty-two before the composition of F(i) was begun, but F1v and F2 consumed nineteen pieces. The number standing, then, was eighty-one when the second round of substitution began on F3v. On both occasions when this measure was introduced, composition could have continued with the roman type without completely exhausting the supply, although F(o) would have very nearly drained the box. It seems clear, however, that in neither instance was the compositor willing to risk running so low, probably because he could not have been absolutely sure of the time when the forme on the press would have been available for distribution. In the next sheet a different problem presents itself. One characteristic which marked the composition of sheets D through F was the appearance of a wrong-font roman capital I of the text. It seems strange, therefore, that the wrong-font I's are found in sheet G on G3 only, in spite of the fact that sheet G required 125 I's, more than any other sheet in the first section of the book. If the compositor ran low enough in sheet D to introduce small I's when seventy-two large I's were standing (twenty-nine in C(o), thirteen in D1, sixteen in D2v, nine in D3, and five in the first few lines of D4v), he also should have run low during the setting of G2. 20 If a sudden supply of new type is excluded from consideration, these explanations suggest themselves: (1) type from one forme of G was distributed before the setting of the other began, (2) some pages of G were set from a different case from that used for sheets D through F, or (3) some pages of G were set by a different compositor from the one who set D through F — a man who felt strongly enough about the use of wrong-font types to eschew them deliberately even when the stock was low in the box. The first explanation can be rejected without further consideration on the grounds that the press delay involved would have been intolerable; the second can be rejected because type which appears in earlier sheets of the book reappears in sheet G. 21 Only the third seems to have been possible under the circumstances. Spelling evidence indicates that the third explanation is probably correct. In sheets B through F the word "honor" occurs eleven times, eight times as honour and three times as honour . Honor occurs once in sheet B, once in sheet C, and once in sheet D. In sheet G, however, the word is found eleven times, always as honor , in this pattern: G 1 1v 2 2v 3 3v 4 4v honor 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 In addition, in sheets B through F the word "again" appears sixteen times, four times as agen and twelve times as againe . The distribution of the two forms appears to be random. But in sheet G there is this distribution: G 1 1v 2 2v 3 3v 4 4v againe 1 1 agen 2 2 1 1 In view of the B—F workman's previous record of againe/agen spellings, the occurrence of both forms on G3 is not surprising; however, the predominance of agen in the other pages of sheet G argues against his presence there. To these words a third may be added, although its occurrence is too infrequent for it to bear much weight as evidence. The word "young" appears four times in sheets B through F as young but on G2 and G3v as yong . In sheet G, then, at least two preferred forms, honour and againe , are discarded in favor of honor and agen , except on G3 where the word "honor" does not occur and where both spellings of "again" are found. On G2 the combination of the two spellings of "again" might suggest an assignment to the original workman, but the occurrence of honor and yong on the same page makes his hand unlikely. Moreover, it is only on G3 that the wrong-font I's appear in the text. From this evidence it may be inferred that, while G3 was set by the same workman who set sheets B through F, a different workman composed G1v, 2, 3v, 4, 1, 2v, and 4v. Apparently the B-F compositor (whom I designate Compositor S) was called off the job for some reason and was replaced by the G workman (Compositor T) for the composition of the first six pages of the sheet to be set. He then returned to the job to compose G3 and was then relieved once more by his colleague who completed the first section of the book by setting G4v. There is nothing to show why this rather curious method of alternation was adopted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III As Greg remarked, the second section of the book (sheets H through L) is set in a slightly different letter from that used in the first section, a fact which suggests that it was composed by a workman different from the two working there. Unfortunately in this section there are few of the typographical peculiarities of the kind found in the first; nevertheless, there is enough evidence available to permit an estimate of the probable order of the setting of the formes. The pattern of running titles indicates that, with the exception of sheet L, the method of composition employed in the second section was the same as that employed in the first. Unless a press delay is hypothecated, the order of imposition (and probably of composition also) must have been either: (1) H(o)-H(i)-I(i) -I(o) -K(o) -K(i) -L(o) -L(i), or (2) H(i)-H(o) -I(o) -I(i) -K(i) -K(o) -L(i)-L(o). In the last line of H3 there is a distinctive capital T (in the word "The") which reappears in the word "To" on I3 (l.19). Had the inner forme of H gone to press before the outer, it is unlikely that the outer could have been set, imposed, wrought off, and distributed before the composition of I3; therefore, it seems reasonable to reject the second order shown above and to accept the first. The inverse order of the composition of the formes of sheet L can be accounted for if it is supposed that the compositor wished to take advantage of an opportunity to get a forme ready for the press somewhat earlier than usual: since L4v was blank, L(o) could be imposed after the setting of only three type pages rather than four. The analysis of the printing of the first section of the book indicated that the method of composition by the prior setting of alternate formes of succeeding sheets could be employed by one compositor. To ascertain whether or not there was indeed only one man at work in sheets H through L and whether S's or T's characteristics appear there, spelling evidence must again be adduced. A total of thirty-one variant spellings in the play was tested by the method advocated by Hinman 22 and used by such investigators as Williams 23 and Brown. 24 Of the thirty-one words, eight were found to be significant, but of this number some were of greater value than others for the purpose at hand. The pattern of their occurrence indicates that the last four sheets of the book were probably set by a single workman (designated Compositor U) who had different spelling characteristics from those of Compositors S and T. The evidence may be summarized as follows: B-F/G3 G1-2v/G3v-4v H-L againe 13 1 10 agen 5 5 9 blood 13 4 0 bloud 0 0 9 deere 5 0 1 deare 3 1 4 eye 17 4 3 eie 6 0 5 safty/safety 2 1 0 safetie 1 0 4 sweete 5 3 1 sweet 2 0 3 to ( i.e. , also) 0 2 0 too 0 1 8 yeare 7 2 1 yeere 0 0 2 From this tabulation it is clear that the case for the presence of Compositor U rests largely on the spelling of bloud as opposed to blood . The other spellings, although weak as evidence in themselves, tend to confirm the division suggested by the bloud spellings; the presence in sheet H of deare, eie , and safetie permits the addition of this sheet to U's stint even though bloud does not occur there. A cluster of againe and eye spellings in sheet L is somewhat disconcerting since both are S's preferred forms, but L also contains three bloud spellings and for this reason the entire sheet is assigned to U. Indeed, the consistency of the typography of the last four sheets and the spelling evidence lead to the conclusion that the second section was set without assistance by one compositor. He is distinguished from S and T by his strong bloud preference and by less pronounced preference for eie, safetie, sweet , and yeere . He differs from T alone in showing no preference for either agen or againe , in preferring honour to honor (his stint contains seventeen honour and two honor spellings), in preferring too to to , and possibly in preferring young to yong (there is one young on L1, while yong does not appear). Greg's suggestion that The Maid's Tragedy Q1 may have been printed in two shops has been noted above. Compositor S was clearly Okes's man because on B1 he used an ornament and an initial known to have belonged to Okes. The work of Compositor T is linked to that of S by his use of skeleton formes which were previously used by S and his sharing of the same font of small capitals. But U used different running-titles and set from a different case. Nevertheless, I believe that there is ample evidence to show that he worked in Okes's rather than another shop. First, the roman letter of sheets H through L of The Maid's Tragedy is the same as that used in Daniel's Whole Workes (STC 6238), which was printed by Okes in 1623. Second, the type of the act head which appears on sig. H4v of The Maid's Tragedy appears to be of the same font as the act heads used in Philaster Q2, which was printed by Okes in 1622. Third, the running-titles of both sections of The Maid's Tragedy , although different settings, appear to be from the same font, which was also used by Okes for the composition of the headlines of Thierry and Theodoret Q1 in 1621. Last, U's preferred spellings, bloud and eie , appear in The Honest Whore Q4, a one-compositor play printed by Okes in 1616. One may conclude that The Maid's Tragedy Q1 was printed entirely in Okes's shop, and it also seems probable that a delay occurred between the printing of the first and second sections of the book. Before leaving this examination of the printing of Q1, there is one further matter of importance which requires consideration. The method used for printing a book was, as it has been pointed out, closely related to the method used for obtaining proof. Since The Maid's Tragedy Q1 was composed and printed in an unusual way, it seems possible that the proofing might also have had some unusual features. The essential difference between one- and two-skeleton printing, as far as proofing was concerned, lay in the increased efficiency of operation which resulted from the proofing of forme II of sheet X while corrections were being made to the type of forme I. 25 But if a book was set by formes, and, as in the case of The Maid's Tragedy Q1, forme I was imposed and sent to the press before the composition of forme II began, the machining of forme I would have been completed at about the same time as the locking-up of forme II, provided no great disparity between the speed of composition and the speed of presswork existed. Under these circumstances forme II could not have been ready to go on the press when forme I was removed for correction. The only advantage gained from using two skeletons was that forme II could be imposed when forme I was still on the press; the taking of proof and the correcting of the type must have been done exactly as if only one skeleton were being employed. There is every reason to believe that press delays were abhorrent to the 17th-century printer. One-skeleton proofing procedure necessarily caused the press to wait while corrections to the type were being made. Therefore, although there is no evidence bearing directly on the point, it seems likely that the proofing of a one-skeleton book, or a two-skeleton book printed in such a way as to cause one-skeleton proofing procedure to be adopted, may have been a more hurried, and perhaps a more casual, affair than the proofing of a two-skeleton book. 26 At any rate, the proofing of The Maid's Tragedy Q1 seems to have been haphazard. Collation of the six extant copies of The Maid's Tragedy Q1 reveals the following press variants: Extant copies: Bodl. (Bodleian Library), CSmH (Henry E. Huntington Library), DFo (Folger Shakespeare Library), Dyce (Dyce Collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum), MB (Boston Public Library), and MH (Harvard University).

B(o) (a) First stage corrections: the correction of two spelling errors. (b) Second stage corrections: the removal of an erroneous comma and the correction of a reading which made sense in the line but which did not make sense in terms of the action. 2. C(o) The correction of what may have been a foul case error; the removal of a comma; three spelling corrections; the correction of a spacing error. 3. E(o) The correction of a spelling error. 4. L(i) The correction of a reading (or perhaps a spelling error) which did not make sense in the line; the correction of a spacing error. It seems evident that, in spite of the delay, Okes was not unwilling to stop his press to make minute corrections: indeed, one or two of them may even have been overzealous. On the other hand, nearly every forme in the book, including the formes with variants, contains other and more obvious errors, such as the following (the lemmata are those of a hypothetical corrected state): 27 B(o) B1 1 sir, ] sir. 20 forbad ] fotbad B(i) B3v 27 there, codes, codes.] there, [space] codes, codes B4 6 this ] rhis C(o) C1 1 King, Evadne ] King ˄ Evadne 15 day. ] day, C4v 4 credulous ] credulons C(i) C2 6 vernall ] veranll 25 floud ] flould C4 18 a side ] aside D(o) D1 35 luster ] lnster D3 9 Instruct ] Instant 13 thunder ] thundet D(i) D1v 22 againe, ] againe.

Had the proofreading been carefully done according to the standards suggested by the press variants, it seems unlikely that many of these mistakes would have gone uncorrected. One may conclude, then, that the reading of the first impression to be pulled from the uncorrected formes, the "proof," was done hastily and incompletely. 29 A few errors, some almost trivial, were noticed and corrected, probably without removing the forme from the bed of the press. 30 The total effect of the proofreading on the text of Q1 seems to have been very slight; the compositors were almost entirely responsible for the text as it now stands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 P. A. Daniel, The Works of Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher (1904), I, 4. 2 Q3, printed in 1630 by Augustine Mathews for Richard Hawkins, is a reprint of Q2, but a few minor alterations are made in the text. 3 "The Relationship of The Maid's Tragedy Q1 and Q2," PBSA , 51 (1957), 322-327. 4 For a discussion of the principles of handling texts in an ancestral series, see W. W. Greg, "The Rationale of Copy-Text," Studies in Bibliography , III (1950-51), 29. At least two recent critics' views of the text of The Maid's Tragedy have been clouded by their failure to recognize the relationship between the two quartos. In 1942 D. G. Stillman in "A Critical Textual Study of Beaumont and Fletcher's The Maid's Tragedy " (unpub. University of Michigan diss.) held that Q2 was set from a "fair copy made early in the career of the play" (p. 249). Stillman's conclusions are accepted by Kirschbaum ( Shakespeare and the Stationers [1955], pp. 242-243 and 365, n. 84). 5 W. W. Greg, A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration , II, 499-500. 6 See C.

If the inner forme of this sheet contains four solid pages of matter and the outer contains three and a blank, it would obviously be to the compositor's advantage to "gain on" the press by setting the outer forme before the inner. The compositor of the second section of The Maid's Tragedy Q1 seems to have done just this. A similar example is found in The Menechmi Q1 (1595), a play printed by Creede. Here the normal order of composition was inner forme-outer forme. After setting E(o), however, the workman composed a half-sheet (F) before E(i), apparently in an effort to readjust his time-balance with the press. See George Walton Williams, op. cit. , pp. 46-49. 13 The STC lists twelve books printed by Okes in 1618 and sixteen in 1619. I have been able to examine five of the 1618 books ( STC 543, 6020, 6248, 18278, and 23136) and four of the 1619 books ( STC 544, 17871, 17873, and 17902). None of these books makes any extensive use of either small-capital font. 14 If the manuscript were written in a regular hand, even prose could be cast off with such accuracy that estimated and actual page-beginnings differed by only one line of type or less. See William H. Bond, "A Printer's Manuscript of 1508," Studies in Bibliography , VIII (1956), 156. 15 This is the case in manuscript reported by Bond. 16 Most likely the pages of C(o) distributed were either C1, which contained nine large I's, or C2v and C3, which contained a total of eight. C4v contained 13 of the large sort. 17 It should be mentioned that the pattern of m's in the speech prefixes also argues for a distribution before the setting of D3v: D 1 2v 3 4v 1v 2 3v 4 M 1/0 3/0 2/0 2/0 4/10 0/6 7/0 2/0 Unfortunately nothing can be learned from this summary regarding the question of whether or not C(o) was distributed after the setting of D4v since that forme contained no m's. 18 The small s appearing on D1 was probably the result of foul case rather than deliberate substitution. 19 When the composition of sheet E began, there were 46 roman A's locked up in D(i) and 29 in D(o), a total of 75. Fifteen more A's were used in setting E1v and E2, thus raising the total standing to 90. The distribution of D(o) reduced this number to 61, but the setting of E3v, E4 E1, E2v, and E3 to the point where the substitution began, required 55 more pieces. There were, then 116 pieces of roman type standing when the substitution of the italic was made. 20 Assuming that F(i) was standing when the composition of G began and that G was set by formes, inner first, the following count of I's standing is obtained: F(i) 45, G1v 17, G2 17 — a total of 79. If, as the pattern of substitution in D would indicate, 69 was near the limit of the supply of large I's, it is reasonable to suppose that small I's would begin to appear on G2. 21 The "m" of "me" (G1v, l. 31) is found on E1v, l. 18 and F3v, l. 10; the "i" of "knowing" (G2v, l. 18) is found on E4v, l. 28; the "y" of "Nay" (G3, l. 12) is found on D1, l. 23; the "o" of "to" (G3v, l. 32) is found on E3v, l. 4 and F3v, l. 29; and the "l" of "leprous" (G1, l. 9) is found on D1, l. 5. 22 Carlton Hinman, "Principles Governing the Use of Variant Spellings as Evidence of Alternate Setting by Two Compositors," The Library , 4th ser., XXI (1940), 78-94. 23 Philip Williams, Jr., "The Compositor of the 'Pied Bull' Lear ," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia , I (1948-49), 61-68. 24 John Russell Brown, "The Printing of John Webster's Plays (II)," Studies in Bibliography , VIII (1956), 113-127. 25 See Bowers, "Elizabethan Proofing" p. 574. 26 Bowers ("Elizabethan Proofing," p. 573, n. 6) points out that "possibly certain books which began with only one skeleton and later shifted to two may result from a printer's discovery that more proofing was necessary than he expected . . . ." 27 I include here only errors in spelling, conventional punctuation, spacing, and those readings so obviously wrong that the proofreader should have noticed them without consulting manuscript. 28 The question of whether or not any of these mistakes stood in the manuscript is beside the point here, because it is quite unlikely that the proofreader would have considered a dramatic manuscript as representing the standard to which the printed book must be made to conform in such details as punctuation, capitalization, and so on. Many cases have been reported which indicate that the MS was consulted during proofreading only when the corrector would make no sense whatever out of the compositor's version. 29 Strictly speaking, we can tell little about the proofreading of G(i), H(o), I(i), and L(i) since they contain no obvious errors of the kind found in the other formes: they may be entirely uncorrected, in which case we reason that the compositor made an excellent job of them, or they may be corrected, in which case we reason that the corrector, either because he had more time or because chance was in his favor, caught all of the mistakes. In the case of sheet G it is possible that proof was taken by the two-skeleton method since both formes were available for nearly simultaneous imposition. I can see no reason, however, why it would be decided to exercise more care with these formes than any others, and therefore I am inclined to believe that they received about the same degree of attention as the others. 30 That the corrections were made early in the machining of the formes is suggested by the fact that in most cases (excluding the second-stage corrections) only one or two uncorrected states of each forme are found as compared with four or five corrected.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">"The Unspeakable Curll": Prolegomena by Robert L. Haig</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1879 W. J. Thoms reprinted for private circulation some "Stray Notes on the Life and Publications of Edmund Curll" which had previously appeared in Notes and Queries . The earliest evidence for Curll's activity as a publisher that he adduced there was in John Spinke's London's Medicinal Informer (1710) where Curll was designated as publisher of a rival medical treatise, The Charitable Surgeon . In Spinke's work, too, there appeared the only known reference to Curll's apprenticeship under one "Mr. Smith, by Exeter Change" and the enigmatic suggestion that Curll had not served Smith "honestly during the whole of the time for which he was bound 'prentice to him." Thirty years ago, in his biography of Curll, Ralph Straus cited evidence from contemporary newspaper advertisements for Curll's having been in business as an auctioneer and publisher as early as 1706. 1 The fact that Curll's name appeared with that of a Richard Smith in the 1706 imprint to a "second edition" of Bladen's translation of Caesar's Commentaries (apparently a reissue of the sheets published in the preceding year by Smith alone) 2 led Straus to conclude, as H. R. Tedder had earlier concluded in the DNB , that this Richard Smith was the "Mr. Smith" later referred to by Spinke, and that the former master and his old apprentice were partners in the publication of what was "probably the earliest book to bear Curll's name." Of Smith, Straus could say only what Dunton had said: that he had been "born with auspicious Starrs . . . and increases daily, both in Fame and Riches." Straus did not press his researches into Curll's early career further. A document has now come to light which not only substantiates fully the inference of Tedder and Straus that Spinke's "Mr. Smith" was the Richard Smith of the imprint to Bladen's "Caesar," but provides some possible justification for Spinke's hint that Curll had wronged his old master, and suggests the manner by which Curll may have acquired his "interest" in the Bladen volume. Further, it supplies information upon the career of Richard Smith which indicates that Dunton's testimony to his affluence was somewhat premature. Finally, the document gives evidence of one of Curll's earliest activities as a full-fledged member of "the trade." On 3 June 1708, Richard Smith, bookseller, of the parish of St. Paul's, Covent Garden, exhibited in Chancery a Bill of Complaint against Thomas Brookhouse, chandler, Thomas Hues (or Hughes), bookbinder, and Edmund Curle [ sic ], bookseller, in which he accused the defendants of conspiracy to defraud him. 3 The allegations of Smith's complaint are lengthy and complicated, but a bare summary will adequately convey what is relevant here. In 1702, requiring money to carry on his business, Smith had borrowed fifty pounds from Brookhouse. Hues had become bound with Smith for one hundred pounds security on the loan. In the four years following, Smith had obtained other loans, so that by May, 1706, he was indebted for seven hundred pounds "and upwards," and several of his creditors were demanding immediate payment under threat of arrest. As a result of the pressure of their demands, and in fear of arrest, Smith "did . . . unadvisedly abscond and withdraw himself from his dwelling house." On 3 May 1706, a commission of bankruptcy was issued against him, authorizing seizure of his "goods[,] effects and estate." The "auspicious Starrs" that Dunton had ascribed to him were hardly influential in 1706. Sometime after the conveyance of his assets into trusteeship, Smith's creditors, "upon cooler thoughts," and believing him to be "an honest and industrious man," decided to forbear prosecution of the bankruptcy proceedings and to allow him to pay fifty pounds quarterly toward the full discharge of his debts. Subsequently, the property that had been seized under the bankruptcy commission had been made available for his use. Before his abscondence, Smith had sent to his security, the bookbinder Thomas Hues, "a great number and severall parcells of books in quires to the value of one hundred pounds and upwards to be by him bound. . . ." Hues, in 1708, had not yet returned those books. Moreover, Hues and Thomas Brookhouse, after Smith had "withdrawn himself as aforesaid," and apparently while he was still in hiding, had taken from Smith's warehouse one hundred unbound copies in folio of "Bull's Works or Bulli Opera," and one hundred copies "in quires" of Bladen's Commentaries . In addition, the two men had taken, "or caused to be taken and carryed away in sacks or baggs from the Marine Coffee House in Birchin Lane" a large quantity of other books, valued at one hundred pounds "and upwards." These books were probably the stock for Smith's auctions. Hues and Brookhouse had seized the books, Smith complained, without the authority of the bankruptcy commission. The value of the books had been much greater than his debts to the two men. They still, in 1708, refused either to cancel his debts to them and pay him the difference between the debts and the value of the books, or to surrender the books to the trustee for Smith's other creditors. Smith was, he declared, both able and willing to pay his debts to Hues and Brookhouse in full. At the time he instituted proceedings in Chancery, Hues and Brookhouse were denying that the books they had taken were of sufficient value to discharge Smith's debts to them. The principal dispute arose, therefore, over the accuracy of their appraisal. And it is in connection with the process of appraisal that the name of Edmund Curll enters the affair. The value of each set of the sheets of Bishop Bull's Works , according to Smith, was £1 5 s. o d. Hues and Brookhouse, after seizing the sheets, had engaged appraisers who placed their value at seven shillings per volume. The names of the "two understanding and indifferent . . . booksellers" whom Hues and Brookhouse had employed in the appraisal were Edmund Curll and Robert Halsey, "a partner with the said Edmund Curle in buying and selling of books." The value that they had assigned to the Bull volumes, Smith claimed, was less than half what they might have been sold for to other booksellers, and their printing had cost twice the amount at which Curll and Halsey had appraised them. Edmund Curll, Smith declared further, "well knew and knoweth," that the subscription price of the volumes, "with all allowances," was £1 1 s. 6 d. each, and that the wholesale price of each volume in quires was 18 s. 9 d. , for Curll had been Smith's own apprentice, and he was at the time of the appraisal "but lately out of his service and apprenticeship." If Smith's valuation of the Bull volumes was accurate, and perhaps he would not have insisted on what he could not prove, then this transaction may be part of the basis of John Spinke's innuendo against Curll in 1710. Smith declared that Curll had been bribed by the other "confederates," Hues and Brookhouse, to submit a low appraisal by the promise that he would be allowed to buy a part of the stock at the price he himself should place upon it. Moreover, according to Smith, Curll actually had bought a considerable portion of the stock soon after the appraisal, and he and the "conferedates" had by 1708 already "sold great part of the books that were bound," and "raised great sums of money thereby." Among those designated as having been sold by the "confederates" were "the said books called Bladen's Commentaries." This would account for the new title-page and imprint that proclaimed a "Second Edition Improv'd" of Bladen in 1706. A search has failed to produce Curll's answer to Smith's complaint, if indeed he ever made one. This account of his activities in the Smith-Hues-Brookhouse affair is therefore deeply biased. The document does suggest, however, that if he was not guilty in 1706 of the unscrupulous business practices for which he later became notorious, he was at least susceptible, at that early date, to accusations of them.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The False Alarm and Taxation No Tyranny : Some Further Observations by D. J. Greene</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This note is an addition to William B. Todd's article "Concealed Editions of Samuel Johnson" ( The Book Collector , Spring, 1953, pp. 59-65). Todd's differentiation of the various issues of Johnson's two pamphlets by means of the press numbers is most useful, and my own recent examination of a dozen or so copies of them produced nothing to add to his findings on this point. There are a few other matters, however, mostly arising out of a closer study of the variant readings, that may be worth reporting. Of The False Alarm , Todd says, "The four impressions comprise the initial issue, generally recognized as the first edition, and three reimpressions of the type originally composed for the first edition, all labelled THE SECOND EDITION and therefore regarded, until now, as a single publication . . . the order of the four impressions may be determined by the progressive deterioration of the type and by certain other peculiarities common only to variants immediately related." The variants he mentions are the disappearance, in his issue 2, of a line that reads in issue 1 "felony, is not eligible in Parliament. They," and its restoration in issues 3 and 4, with "parliament" substituted for "Parliament"; and differences in the make-up of the title-pages. This account might leave the reader with the belief that the words "THE SECOND EDITION" appearing on the title-pages of issues 2, 3, and 4 are no more than a piece of bookseller's salesmanship. There were, however, a few editorial improvements made to the text of the first edition that do perhaps entitle the later issues to that designation. They are Issue I (" first edition ") Issues 2,3,4 (" second edition ") P.8, 1.12 controul control P.9 1.23 co-ordinate they co-ordinate, they P.47, 1.9 retain reclaim P.53, 1.14 to, reflexion to reflexion One of these changes is important: "retain" is one of those bad misprints that make just enough sense so that the casual reader may pass over them but nevertheless ruin the meaning of the passage (the sentence runs "the poacher whose gun has been seized, now finds an opportunity to reclaim it"). We do not have to assume that Johnson himself was responsible for this correction: a good corrector of the press might have been able to make the emendation. But along with the three other minor corrections it does, I think, to some extent justify the use of the designation "second edition" for issues 2, 3, and 4, and rescue Cadell from a possible imputation of sharp practice. The mythical third edition of The False Alarm was apparently John Wright's mistaken deduction from the advertisement of issue 4, in the London Chronicle for March 13 and 15, 1770, as "a new edition," 2 and 3 having been previously advertised as "the second edition." It is worth noting that in the Public Advertiser for March 12, 13, and 14 Cadell's advertisement reads, as before, "the second edition." The usual date given for the first publication of The False Alarm , January 16, 1770, seems to be one day too early. The first occurrence of "This day was published" in the London Chronicle is, to be sure, in the number for January 16-18; but it appears there in the section of the newspaper headed "January 17." This date is confirmed by the series of advertisements in the Public Advertiser , where we are told, in the January 16 number, "Tomorrow at Noon will be published" The False Alarm , and on January 17, "This day is publish'd." The textual history of Taxation No Tyranny is puzzling. I append a fairly full list of the variant readings found in the first four editions, all published during March, 1775. Todd discusses at length the two most striking sets of variants (numbers 38 and 47 in my listing). In the first edition, the phrase "and as a seditious conventicle, punishable by law" is used of the Continental Congress in Philadelphia; in the second edition, it is eliminated; in the third, it reappears, with "conventicle" changed to "meeting"; in the fourth, it disappears agains. And the paragraph "It is difficult to judge with what intention such airy bursts of malevolence are vented: if such writers hope to deceive, let us rather repel them with scorn, than refute them by disputation" appears in the first, second, and fourth editions, but is missing from the third. If Johnson was responsible for this changing back and forth, he is certainly open to the charge of vacillation that Todd makes against him. But Johnson was not noted for vacillation: as Todd says, "It was . . . somewhat extraordinary for the author— this author—to change his mind and debase his text." Must we assume that Johnson was responsible for all this textual inconsistency? A closer look at the nature of the other variant readings in these editions may give some clues as to what happened. To take, first, the variations of the second from the first edition. Many of them (1, 5, 8, 10, 11, 35, 36, 59, 60, 64) are unimportant changes in capitalization and punctuation, that no doubt represent merely the different practices of different compositors. Some presumably represent attempts of a printing-house editor to improve the text—one (18) is the correction of an obvious misprint, others (4, 13, 61) substitute a preferred spelling for an older and less preferred one. But in other places the text deteriorates: the compositor, setting up new type, manages to introduce new misprints that were not in the first edition (31, 39); a slip in punctuation (63) is made; one mistake (57), perpetuated in subsequent editions, was probably the work of an officious but ill-informed printing-house reader. One variant (2), "has never been" in place of "never has been," could conceivably be interpreted as the effort of a conscientious author to make a subtle improvement in the rhythm of his prose; but in view of the triviality of the change, and in the absence of any other specifically stylistic changes in this edition, it seems more reasonable to consider it merely the result of compositorial inattention. In sum, the changes in the second edition, apart from the major one under consideration (38), do not seem to me to make it necessary to postulate Johnson's correcting hand. They can be fully accounted for by the behavior of compositors and proofreaders. The third edition, however, gives a different picture. There are, to be sure, many changes of a similar nature to those encountered in the second edition. Some (1, 5, 8, 10, 11, 35, 36) represent a return to the practice of the first edition in the use of capitals and punctuation marks. Others (14, 24, 41, 49, 50) represent improvements of less preferred spellings found in both the first and second editions. Some misprints introduced in the second edition (31, 39, 63) are corrected and the readings of the first edition restored. Do these facts indicate that the first rather than the second edition was used as the copy-text for the parts of third edition newly set up in type? It is true that some readings of the third edition (4, 13, 57, 60, 61, 64) agree in preference for spelling or punctuation with the second rather than the first edition. But the last four of these occur in signatures L and N, which Todd tells us were printed from standing type of the second edition; and the first two, 4 and 13, could be explained as independent corrections of the text of the first edition—the spellings "desart" and "controll" were, I imagine, very seldom used in 1775. The changes so far noted in the third edition are all capable of being attributed to compositors and proofreaders. But the third edition also contains, what the second edition does not (with the possible exception of 38, one of the two major textual changes into which we are inquiring), a number of changes for which only the author, Johnson, could have been responsible. Two corrections of substantial errors common to both the first and second editions, 22 and 29, could indeed conceivably have been made by a good proofreader. But 44 (made to avoid the repetition of "dreadful" at the beginning of two consecutive paragraphs), 45 (because "stream" occurred two sentences before and occurs again in the next sentence), 46 (to emphasize that the word is part of the quotation from the American address that Johnson is attacking), 55 and 56 can only be Johnson's. If so, I think we can safely say that the readings of the third edition in variants 38 and 47 were what Johnson, at that point, wanted. How then are we to account for the discrepant readings at these two places in the second edition? The history of variant 47 is easily enough explained. The paragraph "It is difficult . . . by disputation," which occurs in the first and second editions, is a tasteless little piece of bad temper, which certainly does not forward Johnson's argument, and indeed contains a position—that the appeal to reason may on some occasions be justifiably abandoned—which in his soberer moments would have been repugnant to him. So he though better of it and, when he came to revise the piece for the third edition, struck it out. The history of variant 38 in the first three editions, it seems to me, is probably this. The deletion in the second edition of the passage about the seditious conventicle was not ordered or authorized by Johnson at all, but by a representative of the Government for whom he had written the pamphlet—perhaps Sir Grey Cooper, one of the Treasury secretaries, who had drastically edited the original copy for the pamphlet, or Wedderburn, the canny Solicitor-General, or even Strahan himself, who was an M.P., a supporter of the Administration, and eager for Government patronage. Johnson, who prided himself on his knowledge of law, was probably very pleased with his discovery that the Continental Congress could be proceeded against under the obsolescent legislation against Dissenters. Even if this were good law—and it sounds too neat to be true—Wedderburn and Cooper would hardly care to have the fact insisted upon in a piece of Government propaganda: they themselves would have been responsible for the prosecution of any such ridiculous action, and no doubt they did not relish being taught their professional duty by the enthusiastic amateur Johnson. So the edict went out to Strahan (Johnson may still have been in Oxford when the second edition was printed off) and the offending passage was expunged. When, however, Johnson came to revise the copy for the third edition, he could not bring himself to part with his darling child, and insisted on bringing it to life again, though with the substitution of the milder word "meeting" for the offending "conventicle." One can imagine Johnson arguing with the reluctant Wedderburn that seditious meetings were at any rate properly actionable, whether or not conventicles were. If this seems an odd proceeding, or if seems shocking to modern notions that Strahan and the Government should take such a liberty with Johnson's text as I suggest, it should be remembered that virtually the same thing had happened four years earlier with Johnson's Thoughts on . . . Falkland's Islands . After a number of copies of the first issue had been publicly sold, the sale was stopped and a revised text issued, without Johnson's knowledge or consent, in which a politically offensive reference to George Grenville was eliminated. In a later edition (1776), Johnson doctored the emended passage so as to restore a little at least of the original pungency. So far, then, I have postulated a first edition of Taxation No Tyranny printed from copy supplied by Johnson, though heavily revised, in proof, by Government direction; a second edition corrected in the printing house, with one major deletion ordered by higher authority; a third edition revised by Johnson, with some stylistic changes, and the deleted passage restored in a softened form. What, finally, of the fourth edition? The type for it, Todd tells us, was completely reset—Strahan must have underestimated the sale of the pamphlet and ordered the type distributed after the third edition was printed off. Todd suggests that the second edition was used as the compositor's copy text for the fourth. In much of the pamphlet the nature of the variants supports this theory: Johnson's careful stylistic corrections to signature K of the third edition are lost; so is his restoration, in signature H, of his remark about the seditious nature of the Philadelphia Congress. But in other signatures, substantial corrections made in the third edition are retained in the fourth—22 and 29 in signature F and 55 and 56 in signature L. The last two were certainly Johnson's, and the first two were very possibly his. The conclusion to be drawn appears to be that the fourth edition was composed from a mixed copy in which signatures F and L were from the third edition and at least signatures H and K from the second. There seems no reason to assume that Johnson himself had any hand in preparing the fourth edition. Johnson did, however, thoroughly revise the text of Taxation No Tyranny for its reprinting in his collected Political Tracts , 1776. For this he obviously used the fourth edition of 1775 as his copy text, with the result that his third-edition corrections of variants 38 and 47 continued to be abandoned. By this time Johnson had probably forgotten all about them. Taxation No Tyranny , as revised by the Government, was not one of his favorite compositions: "The changes [made by Sir Grey Cooper in the proofs of the first edition] are not for the better, except where the facts were mistaken," he wrote Strahan; but "why should I in defense of the ministry provoke those whom in their own defense they dare not provoke?" It is not likely that he would waste much energy on a work that was botched, in his opinion, even before it had been published at all. True, on the two occasions when he had an opportunity to revise the text, for the third edition of 1775 and the edition of 1776, he did so with a certain display of conscientiousness. But for the revision of 1776 he apparently fell into the well-known trap of assuming that the latest edition of a work is textually the best. He would have been better able to recapture his own intentions had he taken the third instead of the fourth edition as his copy text in 1776.

      <field name="heading_text">Two Notes on Goldsmith by Arthur Friedman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. The First Edition of Goldsmith's Life of Bolingbroke There is a curious lack of agreement among Goldsmith's biographers, editors, and bibliographers concerning the form in which his Life of Bolingbroke first appeared. In the Percy Memoir we are told that Goldsmith wrote "the Life of Lord Bolingbroke, which he prefixed to the Dissertation on Parties, which was printed by T. Davies in 1771." 1 Cunningham in his edition of Goldsmith says that the work "was prefixed to an edition of the . . . Dissertation on Parties published by Davies in 1770. It also appeared the same year as a separate publication . . ."; and this account is followed by later nineteenth-century writers. 2 Goldsmith's twentieth-century bibliographers say, however, that although the Life was intended to be prefixed to an edition of Bolingbroke's Dissertation upon Parties , it was first published as a separate pamphlet on 19 December 1770 and did not appear with the Dissertation until 1775. The only edition described by Williams and by Scott in their bibliographies is the separate Life of 1770. 3 The history of the publication of the Life is easily traced in the newspapers. In the General Evening Post for 8-10 November 1770 Davies advertises: " The 22d inst. will be published , A NEW EDITION (being the TENTH) of A DISSERTATION upon PARTIES . . . . To this edition is added the Life of the Author." The next advertisement I have seen, in the Gazetteer for Thursday, 29 November 1770, shows that the publication had been delayed and the designation of the edition altered and also that the Life was to appear separately: "Saturday next will be published, . . .

The separate Life is advertised as published "This day" in the London Evening Post for 1-4 December. Since apparently no recent student of Goldsmith has seen a copy of the ninth edition of A Dissertation upon Parties , I give a description of it.

Copies examined: Cambridge University Library; Forster Collection, Victoria and Albert Museum; University of London. Notes: In the Forster copy the folding of A 2 is reversed. In the University of London copy the half-title for the Life (d4) and the text of the Life appear immediately after A 2 and before Bolingbroke's long dedication. Although this arrangement would seem to be more convenient for the reader, the catch-words on pp. lv and 113 show that it was not the order intended by the printer. With this description may be compared that of the separate Life . THE / LIFE / OF / HENRY St. JOHN, / LORD VISCOUNT / BOLINGBROKE. / [type ornament] / LONDON: / Printed for T. DAVIES, in Russel-Street, / Covent-Garden. 1770. Collation: 8°, A 1 B-G 8 H 8 (±H7) I 1 [$4 signed], pp. [2] 1 2-113 114 . Contents: A1 title, A1 v blank, pp. 1-113 text of Life , p. 114 books printed for Davies. Press figures: 43-4, 52-4, 84-6. Copies examined: British Museum (2 copies), Cambridge University Library, University of Chicago. As is suggested by the descriptions and confirmed by examination, sheets B-H in the two publications were printed from the same setting of type; and since the press figures are the same and there is the same cancel, these sheets were no doubt continuously impressed. Leaf I1 is of different impressions for the two publications: I1 r has a catch-word in the Dissertation and FINIS in the separate Life ; and I1 v is blank in the Dissertation , while in the Life it has the advertisement which in the Dissertation appears as A1 v . Only the title of the separate Life is from a new setting. From this study the following conclusions may be drawn: (1) the Life was apparently first published on 1 December 1770 in the ninth edition of A Dissertation upon Parties , dated 1771; (2) the separate Life probably was published a few days later, on 4 December; 4 (3) the two publications of the Life may best be described as different issues not only of the same edition but also—for almost all the work—of the same impression.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. The 1772 Edition of Goldsmith's Traveller In the Daily Advertiser for Thursday, 27 February 1772 appears the following advertisement: " On Saturday next will be published , . . . With a Copper-Plate Title Page, . . . the Eighth Edition of THE TRAVELLER . . ."; and the poem is duly announced as published "This Day" on 29 February. The difficulty is that no edition of the work between 1770 and 1774 is known. To make up for this lack there is (in addition to a duodecimo piracy called the fifth edition) one superfluous edition dated 1770. The sixth edition, with a title printed from type as in all earlier editions, was published 29 June 1770. The seventh edition, "With a Copper-Plate Title Page," was advertised as published on 8 December; 1 and certainly no further edition was needed in 1770, since the seventh edition was still being advertised on 26 February 1771. There are, however, two unnumbered editions with titles printed from the same engraved plate dated 1770. The probable explanation is that one of these is the missing eighth edition of 1772, for which the title-page plate was left unaltered. The plate appears to have been changed by the addition of two roman numerals to the date only for the edition (called on the half-title the ninth) of 1774. Although the two unnumbered editions with the engraved title dated 1770 have the same collation and are without press figures, they can be readily distinguished, perhaps most easily by the line-endings in the prose dedication. The following are the endings for page i , lines 4-8: 70b 70c But as a But from Switzer- from only inscribed to only in- it, when it man, who, man, Although 70b and 70c both derive from 70a (the sixth edition), since they follow the new readings of that edition, they are not independent reprints of 70a, for they agree against 70a in two substantive readings and in a large number of variants in accidentals; consequently one of the two must have used the other as copy. That 70b is the earlier is established by the fact that it agrees with 70a against 70c in a number of readings in accidentals and more conclusively by the fact that the prose dedication of 70b is a line-for-line reprint of 70a while that of 70c is not. 70b can thus be identified as the seventh edition published 8 December 1770 and 70c as the eighth edition published 29 February 1772.

      <field name="heading_text">The Missing Third Edition of Wheble's Junius (1771) by G. Blakemore Evans</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his recent valuable bibliography of The Earliest Editions of the Letters of Junius (1957), published by the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, Mr. T. H. Bowyer questions the existence of a third edition of Wheble's 1771 collection. An edition described as "this third edition" was advertised in the Public Advertiser on 29 February and 2 March, 1772 (Bowyer, p. 44). Mr. Bowyer, however, says that he has "not found any edition specifically stated to be the third" and feels that the "advertisement looks like an attempt to forestall an anticipated fall in sales on the publication of AE [i.e. the author's edition printed by Woodfall, published 3 March 1772], possibly with sophisticated earlier editions" (pp. 44-45). In the absence of a clearly marked third edition this would seem a likely explanation, but for once it is possible to exculpate Wheble. An entirely reset third edition of Volume I does exist. The problem of Volume II will be treated separately later. Two copies of Volume I, third edition, have been found: (1) a copy in my own library (Copy A), in original calf binding, with the (?contemporary) signature of the owner, Nicholas Rogers, on the title-page (also on the title-page of Volume II); (2) a copy in the Library of University College, London (Copy B), mistakenly described by Mr. Bowyer in his "Addenda" (p. 147) as belonging to the second edition. 1 Following Mr. Bowyer's collational formula, the collation for Volume I (Copy A) is: [engraved title (date 1771); plate mark 141.5 x 82 mm.; engr. tit. with lettering 46 (121) x 59 mm.; see Bowyer's reproduction, p. 51] 2 8°; π1 π A 4 A 4 B-Q 8 R 4 , pp. [2] i-viii [8] [1] 2-247 [248] [=248] π1 a t.p.; π1 b blank; π A1 a [double rule / 'DEDICATION / TO THE / English Nation.'; A1 a-b 'ADVERTISEMENT.'; A2 a 'CONTENTS.'; A4 b blank; B1 a text, headed 'LETTERS.'; on R4 a 'THE END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.'; R4 b blank. The collation for Copy B is the same, except that sig. π A 4 ('DEDICATION.') is lacking. One point immediately distinguishes the third edition from the second as described by Mr. Bowyer, #[13], p. 52. Sig. A1 b is not blank as in the second edition; it contains the following 'Advertisement': ADVERTISEMENT. / TO THE THIRD EDITION. / This edition has been carefully read with the / former, and again compared with the Public / Advertisers, in order to render these elegant / written papers still more correct, and to obtain / the same opinion in favour of this edition of the / Letters of Junius (from the press of Dryden / Leach and George Bigg) as hath been shewn by / the Public to the two preceding editions. A page for page comparison of the two editions establishes beyond question that Volume I has been completely reset. Detailed evidence of various kinds (position of running-titles, ruler test, etc.) could be cited for every signature, but it will be sufficient to record the following differences. (a) The third edition is not a line for line reprint (compare sigs. B1 b , C1 b , D2 a , L4 a , R2 a ). (b) In dating letters the second edition regularly uses roman for the month; the third uses italic (the second edition also tends to use abbreviations for the month; for example, sig. O4 b 'Feb.' for ' February ' [third edition]; (c) The first two words of most of the letters in the third edition are in caps and small-caps; in the second they are usually in lower case, following the initial capital. 3 Copy A contains one unique feature. Preceding sig. A Junius' 'DEDICATION TO THE English Nation.' has been inserted. The four leaves are signed A on the recto of the first leaf (the other leaves are unsigned and there is no catchword on sig. [A4] b ) and paged i-viii. Copy-text for the 'DEDICATION' is clearly Woodfall's first edition (1772), though the contents is here reduced from ten to eight pages. It is printed on a bluish-tinted paper with one of the common 'Pro Patria' watermarks (cf. Heawood, Nos. 3695-3718), a paper which appears again in Volume II (Copies A and D) in both the typographical title-page and the inserted sig. 2C. Wheble first included the 'DEDICATION' as a regular part of Volume I in his 1775 editions (Bowyer, #[21]), #[22], the last dated 1771), where, however, it is from a different setting of type. So far as Volume II is concerned it is only misleading, I think, to talk about second or third editions. There is only one edition of Volume II, a volume put together from five parts each separately issued by Wheble, the first part advertised in the Public Advertiser for 20 November 1770, the fifth part for 29 February 1772 (Bowyer, p. 48). Now it will be recalled that Wheble advertised the third edition of the Letters (i.e., Volume I) in the same issue of the Public Advertiser in which he announced the publication of the fifth part of Volume II. As a complete volume then we should expect to find Volume II most often associated with Volume I of the third edition; such, on the evidence of the scant known copies, is the case. Only four complete copies of Volume II are recorded: two (Copy A, paired with Copy A of Volume I above; Copy B, University College copy [Bowyer, p. 147]) are paired with Volume I, third edition; one (Copy C, British Museum copy #i [Bowyer, p. 59]) with Volume I, second edition; and one (Copy D, Mr. Bowyer's private copy, pp. 59, 105) with Volume I of the 1775 Wheble edition (Bowyer, # [21]). The other two known copies of Volume I, second edition (British Museum copy #ii and King's College, London) are paired with part one (sig. B) of Volume II only (Bowyer, pp. 59-60). The problems connected with Volume II are concerned with the title-page and sig. 2C. In Copies B and C there is an engraved title-page, adapted from Volume I (see Bowyer's illustration, p. 56), and sig. 2C is lacking. Copies A and D, however, have typographical title-pages, essentially identical, 4 and contain sig. 2C inserted in sig. 2B. Moreover, the typographical title-page and sig. 2C of both copies are printed on the same bluish-tinted paper used for the 'DEDICATION' in Volume I (Copy A) of the third edition, and, like the 'DEDICATION', sig. 2C is set directly from a copy of Woodfall's 1772 authorized edition. 5 From this it would seem clear that, as with the 'DEDICATION', sig. 2C was an afterthought. Whether Wheble surreptitiously obtained advance sheets of Woodfall's edition, or whether at some later time he purloined the 'DEDICATION' and the contents of sig. 2C from Woodfall's published text, must remain an open question. The second possibility makes it easier to account for the omission of sig. 2C in Copies B and C, though such an omission is not in itself fatal to the first. Whichever view we may take, fraud was obviously in Wheble's mind, a fraud to which he may have hoped to give some shadow of substance by retaining the date 1771 on his newly set typographical title-page (the bluish-tinted paper on which the title-page is printed links it with the materials cribbed from Woodfall's edition). 6 In this way Wheble, not Woodfall, would appear to be the first to present Junius' 'DEDICATION' (and the portion of the letter on sig. 2C) to a grateful public. Ironically, however high-minded his intentions, Wheble was over-zealous. The 'new' material on sig. 2C was already included in Wheble's own fifth part of Volume II in a more complete form as Letter XVI!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Mr. T. H. Bowyer has been most kind in answering questions about his own copies and in re-examining the University College, London, copy. My friend Professor Bruce Harkness unselfishly took on himself the burden of collating my copy of the third edition with the British Museum copies of the second edition (Volume I). Mr. Bowyer writes me that he has recently acquired a copy of the third edition from Sotheby. Volume I appears to be identical with Copy A as described below; Volume II is also identical with Copy A except that (a) the means used to convert 'I' to 'II' on the typographical title-page may be different, and (b) sigs. 2C4 and 2B2 (blank recto and verso) are wanting. 2 The slight differences between these measurements and those recorded by Bowyer (p. 52) for the second edition may be accounted for by paper shrinkage. The plate seems to be the same in both editions. 3 All eight typographical errors listed by Bowyer (pp. 54-55) for the second edition have been corrected in the third. The third, of course, adds some of its own; for example; sig. A1 a , line 4 'withour' for 'without'; sig. B8b, line 1 'whithout' for 'without' (catchword correct); sig. C3 a , the heading 'LETTER III.' omitted; sig. D2 b 'brided' for 'bribed'; sig. G5 b , 'ETTER XVI.' for 'LETTER XVI.'; sig. Q4 b (catchword) 'member,' for 'member.'. 4 The title-page of Copy D is identical except that the 'II' of 'VOL. II.' has been converted from 'I' by a penstroke instead of being handstamped as in Copy A. Copy B appears to lack the catchword 'LET-' on 2B1 b ; Mr. Bowyer, however, tells me that the paper is noticeably thin at this point, suggesting that the catchword has been scratched away. Another copy of this typographical title-page appears in a copy of Volume II of the 1775 edition (Bowyer, p. 105) in the British Museum. Mr. Bowyer assures me that it is too browned to determine whether it too is on the same bluish-tinted paper. 5 The material in sig. 2C (a selection from one of Junius' letters to John Wilkes, 7 September 1771) appears at the end of Woodfall's second volume and was there, too, apparently an afterthought; there is no reference to it in Woodfall's index. 6 Wheble tried the same trick in the edition listed by Mr. Bowyer as #[22].</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Text of Burns' "The Jolly Beggars" by John C. Weston, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Robert Burns advised George Thomson against suggested changes in one of Allan Ramsay's poems: "Ramsay, as every other Poet, has not been equally happy in his pieces: still I cannot approve of taking such liberties with an Author. . . . Let a poet, if he chuses, take up the idea of another, and work it into a piece of his own; but to mangle the works of the poor Bard whose tuneful tongue is now mute forever in the dark and narrow house, by Heaven 'twould be sacriledge." 1 Ironically enough, just such mangling has, I think, taken place in Burns' posthumous "The Jolly Beggars." This poem, perhaps Burns' greatest, is ordinarily printed with a passage about a Merry Andrew, consisting of a recitative and a song, which it is the contention of this paper Burns did not want included in the final version of the poem and which only got into the poem when Burns' "tuneful tongue" was "mute forever" and unable to protest its intrusion. 2 Two holograph copies of the poem survive, one at the Burns Museum at Alloway and the other in the Laing Collection of the Library of the University of Edinburgh. The history of the first is the more interesting because it is fuller and because it concludes with the posthumous printing of the poem. In the autumn of the year 1785, Burns, along with his two most intimate friends of that period, John Richmond and James Smith, after a meeting at John Dow's Inn, went to an alehouse operated by one Mrs. Gibson, otherwise known as Poosie Nancy. There they witnessed noisy merry-making by a group of vagrants and after a short time departed. 3 This information was given by Richmond himself to Robert Chambers, the Scottish author and publisher, and is almost the only information we have of the occasion of the poem. In a few days, Chambers continues, Burns recited a part of the poem to Richmond, who remembered that there were songs by a sweep and a sailor, now lost. Richmond moved to Edinburgh about Martinmas, 1785, and took with him the Merry-Andrew portion of the poem, which Burns had given him. 4 Some time later Burns gave a copy of the poem without the Merry-Andrew section to the obscure David Woodburn, factor for Mr. M'Adam of Craigen-Gillan, a wealthy Ayrshire gentleman with whom Burns seems to have had some acquaintance. Woodburn gave his copy of the poem to a merchant in Glasgow, from whom it passed through a series of hands to Thomas Stewart, who was coincidently the nephew of Burns' friend John Richmond, the poet's companion during the evening at Poosie Nancy's. 5 Stewart published this manuscript in the first of the famous Stewart and Meikle tracts on July 13, 1799, without authorization; and there followed in the same year a second and a third edition of the first tract. The tracts were gathered together and published by Stewart and Meikle in 1800 in one cover. 6 "The Jolly Beggars" was printed again in 1801 by Stewart in a more widely circulated Glasgow volume, Poems Ascribed to Robert Burns, the Ayrshire Bard (HH, II, 286). All of these printings of the poem in 1799, 1800, and 1801 derived from the Woodburn manuscript descending to Stewart, which did not, to repeat, contain the Merry-Andrew portion. Thomas Stewart evidently in 1801 received from his uncle John Richmond the single sheet containing the Merry-Andrew portion which the latter had taken to Edinburgh in 1785. The single sheet Stewart thus received was mechanically different from the manuscript he had been printing from: it was written in a larger character, with a different tint of ink, and on a different quality of paper. 7 Stewart printed it separately in another Glasgow volume which appeared February, 1802, entitled Stewart's Elegant Pocket Edition of Burns's Poems . 8 As far as I can determine, the first editor to print the poem with the Merry-Andrew section included as part of the poem was R. H. Cromek, who published Select Scotish Songs in 1810. Cromek says that he used the Stewart manuscript as a source (although, as we shall see later, there is evidence that he had access to another manuscript); he presents this footnote to the title: "The present copy is printed from a MS. by Burns, in 4to, belonging to Mr Stewart, of Greenock. This gentleman first introduced it to the public." The Merry-Andrew section is found in this edition in its now-traditional place (after the second song). Stewart, before he loaned his manuscript to Cromek, or indeed anybody having access to it, could have made the decision to place the Merry Andrew after the second song, for Stewart's manuscript, now in the Burns Museum, contains the single-sheet later addition in its traditional place. Or Stewart or another could have followed Cromek's example in placing it there. Although an edition the next year (1811) by Josiah Walker, Poems by Robert Burns , prints the poem without the section in question (because Walker used Stewart's 1801 versions of Burns' posthumous poems as a source), all subsequent editors, beginning with Allan Cunningham's edition of 1834, print the poem with the Merry-Andrew section in the place where Stewart or Cromek inserted it. Probably one or the other of these two men started the tradition which it is the purpose of this paper to question. The history of the second surviving holograph copy of the poem, now in the Laing Collection at the University of Edinburgh, is less full and more conjectural. This copy bears the title "Love and Liberty." Like the original version of the only other surviving autograph copy of the poem, the Laing manuscript does not contain the Merry-Andrew section and, further, has no possible place for it, the beginning of the "raucle carlin's" recitative following immediately on the same page after the end of the "martial chuck's" song. It is part of a miscellaneous collection of Burns' autograph letters and poems bound into one volume. Although David Laing unfortunately did not record how the poem came into his possession, Burns probably copied it to present to one of the Glencairn family, because most of the other items in the volume in which it is bound are endorsed to the Earl, Lady Henrietta Don (his sister), or Lady Elizabeth Cunningham (another sister). 9 It is also probable that this copy of the poem is the one that Dr. James Currie inspected and rejected as morally unsuitable for inclusion in the first printing of Burns' complete works, the four-volume edition of 1800. At least the following letter of Alexander Cunningham, September 17, 1796, shows him, as Burns' literary executor who collected manuscripts which he later turned over to Dr. Currie, referring to this title; and since the Laing copy is the only surviving one with this title, there is some warrant for believing Cunningham held it when he wrote the following: "There has been put into my hand a poem entitled Love and Liberty . I presume you have seen it. Were the pruning-knife applied to some of the broad humour it might be published without incurring much censure—at least it would be admired by many and is surely too valuable to be thrown aside" (HH, I, 305). There is evidence that other manuscripts of the poem existed. An "early draft" of the poem, which is now evidently lost, was sold in 1861 (HH, II, 306). And R. H. Cromek in his printing of 1810 evidently had access to a different copy, perhaps the "early draft" just mentioned, because although he states he used the Stewart manuscript as a basis for his version, he presents one distinctive difference ("A Sailor" for "The fiddler," l. 230), a variant found in the Laing manuscript to which he evidently did not have access. Further, he presents a variant for lines 211-212 which is not found either in the Stewart or the Laing manuscripts. 10 Probably the title of this version was, like that of the Laing version, "Love and Liberty," because Cromek adds that title as an alternative to the traditional title in his printing of the poem, an alternative not present in his ostensible source, the Stewart manuscript. But nothing pertinent to our problem can be gained from speculations about these lost versions. We can conclude, however, from the evidence of the only two surviving autograph copies of the poem, that since the Merry-Andrew section was originally not a part of the one and never a part of the other, it has very little warrant for being where it is in almost all printings of the poem. 11 There is a less strong but additional line of argument possible based on evidence of the manuscript Burns considered as fit for publication. Chambers started a tradition that Burns thought poorly of this poem because of the adverse criticism of the Mossgiel household. And Wallace says, "There is no evidence that Burns contemplated giving it ["The Jolly Beggars"] to the world." 12 This statement is untrue. Between his arrival in Edinburgh and March, 1787, Burns submitted the manuscript of the poem to Hugh Blair. Burns was considering including this poem in the forthcoming Edinburgh volume as an addition to the poems which appeared in the Kilmarnock edition and wanted Blair's opinion. In a memorandum Blair says, "The Whole of What is called the Cantata, the Songs of the Beggars &amp; their Doxies, with the Grace at the end of them, are altogether unfit in my opinion for publication. They are much too licentious; and fall below the dignity which Mr Burns possesses in the rest of his poems &amp; would rather degrade them." 13 If we could absolutely determine the identity of the manuscript which Burns submitted to Blair, we would know what version Burns wanted to publish and whether that version contained the Merry-Andrew section. But we cannot so determine because Blair does not refer to the poem by title and thus allow us to point to either the Laing or the Stewart versions. Both surviving versions have "A Cantata" as sub-title. Evidently the "Grace" of which Blair speaks is the last song that the Bard sings and leads the others in singing, a sort of drinking song in thanksgiving for the joys of the outcast's life. It is possible, perhaps probable, that when Blair condemned the poem, Burns gave the rejected manuscript either to Woodburn or to one of his new Edinburgh friends in the Glencairn family. And we have seen that the Woodburn (Stewart) manuscript did not have a Merry Andrew when Woodburn received it and that the Glencairn (Laing) manuscript never has had him. Although Burns obviously wrote the Merry-Andrew fragment to be inserted in a version of this poem, it is my contention that after writing he it excised it in the process of revising the poem to a later form which had no place for it. There are numerous ways of demonstrating this proposition. There is evidence, to begin, that a more complicated version of the poem did at one time exist. We have heard of songs of a sailor and of a sootyman or a sweep that Burns evidently wrote and discarded upon reconsideration. The Laing manuscript of this poem shows evidence of an incomplete revision from an earlier version which included the sailor: "A sailor" stands in place of the obviously correct "The fiddler" in line 230. 14 The "tinkler hizzie" (84), the Merry Andrew's companion, probably had in previous version some relation, quite naturally, with the tinker, who figures in the action of the existing version. For in the existing version she is, unlike all the other female characters, unrelated to the action of the poem. She does not figure in the exchange between the soldier laddie and the camp follower, which forms the overture; nor in the operetta itself, which involves, first, the dramatic conflict between the pigmy fiddler and the tinker over the affections of a woman pickpocket and, second, the resolution provided by the beggar poet's giving the loser of the rivalry one of his three doxies; nor in the finale, which consists of the last recitative and the bard's final climactic song making magnificently explicit the revolutionary theme. 15 Perhaps Professor Snyder's feeling that the poem is "possibly incomplete" 16 results from the presence of the Merry Andrew and his wench, who are inorganic to the poem and who give evidence of an earlier version. It may be argued that the Merry-Andrew section is a later addition, but it is certainly more likely that Burns worked from imperfection to perfection than from perfection to imperfection, for the later addition of the Merry Andrew impairs the poem. It is unlikely that Burns would have intended to add to a tightly and carefully structured poem a section which seriously impairs the dramatic continuity and the tone. The Merry Andrew is clearly a part of an earlier, more complicated version. Given the earlier version containing the Merry Andrew, there remains to show that he does not belong in the present one. My first point is a negative one. The Merry Andrew is the only singing character who can be removed, who is not tied by cross references to other parts of the poem. He and his companion are alone not mentioned in other sections than their own: the campfollower is not only mentioned in the recitative of her song but in that of her soldier laddie (18); the fiddler is not only mentioned in the recitative of his song but in those of the campfollower's (54-55), the tinker's (188-202), and the bard's (230-31), and so on for all the characters in the poem except the Merry Andrew and his companion. Second, we turn from how the Merry Andrew can be removed to why he should be. The Merry Andrew, like his "tinkler hizzie," does not advance the action of the drama, that is, does not form a part of the pickpocket-fiddler-tinker triangle nor of the group which provides the resolution, namely, the bard and his three doxies. 17 Perhaps one might say that the Merry Andrew provides an additional song in the overture and that the maimed veteran and the campfollower do not advance the action either. But there is no dramatic need for the Merry Andrew, the scene and tone and theme having been set adequately by the soldier and his lass. Indeed—and this is the third point—the Merry Andrew actually destroys the dramatic situation by singing his song when he does. The campfollower has just explained how she has been cured of her "despair" by having met her "old boy in a Cunningham fair" (75-76) and she now rejoices at having a soldier laddie once again (78). The pickpocket immediately reacts to the campfollower's song of joy by manifesting her own unrelieved grief, for, unlike the campfollower, she has not found another man. If one inserts the Merry Andrew between the two, one blunts the dramatic effect of this reaction; and since the reader will have forgotten about the campfollower's joy because of the intervening song of the Merry Andrew, the pickpocket appears to be unmotivated in her wailing and in offering to explain the cause of her grief. 18 If we accept this explanation for the pickpocket's narrative, we can establish the fourth point: the Merry Andrew is alone unmotivated. He is the only character who has no particular reason for advancing to sing his song, with the exception of the soldier, who because he sings the first song can be excused for beginning the proceedings from mere general ebullience. Not only does the Merry-Andrew section, then, not belong where it stands, but the first editor to have included it could not have inserted it anywhere else: the Merry Andrew could not appear between the soldier and his lass; could not interrupt the continuous working out of the conflict which constitutes the drama and to which the Merry Andrew is irrelevant; and certainly could not appear between the bard's first and second song, because the opening lines of the last recitative tie the last section inviolably to the bard's first song: "So sung the bard . . ." (274). And my final point is perhaps the most conclusive of all: what the Merry Andrew says and how he says it are all wrong for the poem. The other characters, with the exception of the pickpocket whose character is determined by the requirement of the little plot, are not bitter against society; they do not ridicule it by showing its absurdities and corruptions; they merely show a hearty approval of the outcast's life and an equally hearty contempt for the life of lawful respectability. Compare the satirical, self-pitying (107-108) Merry Andrew, who makes fun of himself by mockingly justifying his ignorance and who satirizes society (preachers [111-12], jurists [92], politicians [109-110]) by claiming that they do not know they are fools. The bard's attack upon society in the song that he leads at the end is not satirical, that is, not ironic and ridiculing; the line, for instance, "A fig for those by law protected!" expresses magnificent contempt, not the publing sarcasm of the Merry Andrew. Of course, one finds different kinds of characters in a dramatic poem but not, without special dramatic reason, one character whose attitude is completely at variance with the common attitude of all the others. Further, the Merry Andrew, since he does indulge in satire, is the only character whose song is intellectual, whose song turns upon an idea: the distinction between artificial and natural fools. 19 By way of summary, this can be said. In the absence of a version of the poem which Burns printed in his life, there is a difficulty, admittedly, as to what the text should be. We do not know the identity of the manuscript which Burns submitted to Blair as a possibility for the Edinburgh edition, although it is perhaps either the Stewart or Laing manuscript. And even if we did know that either surviving manuscript was the one Burns submitted to Blair, we might not want to use it alone as a text because Burns could have bowdlerized it for publication. Henley and Henderson's solution was to take the best readings from both manuscripts, clearly an esthetic textual proceeding, but probably the best course to follow. But even on this esthetic principle the Merry-Andrew section does not belong in the poem. It does not form a part of the original Stewart manuscript, and it is not found at all in the Laing manuscript, where the two sections which adjoin the traditional location of the Merry-Andrew fragment are continuous on the same page. Consequently, the only two surviving manuscript versions which Burns copied out himself as complete poems do not have the passage in question. He must have had reasons for omitting it from the two finished versions, and these reasons I have tried to show in my discussion of the poem. I think, then, that editors of Burns would be more respectful to the poet if they would print the text of "The Jolly Beggars" that Burns probably considered final and not a text that never received his approval in any extant version.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 J. DaLancey Ferguson, The Letters of Robert Burns (1931), II, 161. 2 William Scott Douglas' distinguished edition, Edinburgh, 1877-79, prints the passage in brackets and gives a rather full account of the history of the manuscript. W. E. Henley's and T. F. Henderson's Centenary Edition, Edinburgh, 1896-97 (hereafter cited as HH), prints the passage without brackets but in a lengthy bibliographical note presents the fullest account of the manuscripts and printings of the poem to be found. J. Logie Robertson, in his Oxford Edition, 1904, prints the passage without brackets and mentions, in an account of the poem, its first printing in "incomplete form" and its subsequent appearance with the questioned passage. To my knowledge, the only twentieth-century printing of the poem without the passage is C. A. Moore, ed., English Poetry of the Eighteenth Century (1935); and Professor Moore does not explain its omission. The one special study of the text of Burns' poems (George Marsh, "The Text of Burns," The Manly Anniversary Studies in Language and Literature [1923], pp. 219-228) does not deal with the posthumous poems. 3 William Scott Douglas, ed., The Complete Works of Robert Burns (1877-79), I, 180. 4 Douglas, I, 181. Most of this information is verified by an independent witness, Richmond's nephew, Thomas Stewart, who obtained, as we shall see, the Merry-Andrew portion of the poem in 1802. He wrote on the margin of the single sheet containing the portion in question: "The scene of the Merry Andrew was presented to the publisher by Mr. Richmond [ ] Mauchline after the first Ed. of the Jolly Beggars was published. Mr. Richmond who was with the Bard in Poosie Nancy's on the night he saw some of the characters who are drawn in the admirable production, says that there were three [sic] scenes more which are now totally lost, viz a Sailor, a Sootyman and [ ]----T. Stewart." A photograph of this single-sheet section of the ms can be seen in Memorial Catalogue of the Burns Exhibition (Glasgow, 1898). The ms itself is in the Burns Museum, Alloway. 5 J[ames] G[ibson], The Bibliography of Robert Burns (1881), p. 272. Gibson evidently got his information from the preface to the facsimile printing of the poem by James Lumsden and Son (1823); see HH, II, 306. Woodburn is difficult to identify and probably was only a slight acquaintance of Burns. Burns mentions the M'Adam family three times: (1) he wrote, probably in 1786, a poetical epistle to M'Adam "in answer to an obliging letter he sent in the commencement of my poetical career," (HH, II, 87-88); (2) he referred to the marriage of M'Adam's daughter in a letter of 1787 (Ferguson, The Letters , I, 63); and (3) he praised M'Adam's son briefly in the "Second Heron Election Ballads" (HH, II, 196, 404). To Woodburn himself we find no allusion made by Burns. It is unlikely this is the Capt. Woodburn, born at Adamton Mill by Ayr, whom Mrs. Dunlop mentions in her letter to Burns of 9 Jan. 1787 ( Robert Burns and Mrs Dunlop , William Wallace, ed., [1898], I, 8). 6 J. W. Egerer, Robert Burns, An Exhibition of Some Early Editions of his Work (Dartmouth College Library, 1946), pp. 15-16; HH, II, 284. 7 Douglas, I, 181; Fac-Simile of Burns' Celebrated Poem Entitled The Jolly Beggars (1838), p. 7. I have personally inspected the Richmond-Stewart ms in the Burns Museum at Alloway ( The Burns Cottage, Alloway: Catalogue [1950], Item 188). Since I have been unable to get a photoprint of this ms for detailed study, I have used the excellent facsimile edition noted above. 8 Egerer, p. 16; HH, II 287. Since this volume was printed in parts (all but one evidently now lost) beginning in July, 1801, the Merry-Andrew section probably first appeared, in fact, between that date and Feb., 1802. But since Stewart claimed to have published it for the first time, the printing of it in a rare edition by Duncan (1801) must have come from Stewart's printing and not from a separate and now lost ms (HH, II, 286-287). 9 I can find no clear evidence for the statement in HH that "this copy [of the poem] was sent to a lady—Lady Harriet [sic] Don" (II, 307). A number of coarse words are changed from the Stewart ms (e.g., "fuds" to "backs," l. 278) but the most salacious stanza (ll. 71-74) and the most ribald line (230) remain intact in spite of HH's claim that the stanza was omitted (II, 309) and that the Laing ms represents a version modified for the presentation to a lady (II, 307). Here and hereafter I use the line numbers of J. Logie Robertson's Oxford edition (1904). 10 That monkey face, despise the race Wi' a' their noise an' cap'ring. 11 I shall hereafter present my reasons for believing that the Merry-Andrew fragment is a part of an earlier version and is not a later addition. 12 Robert Chambers, ed., rev. William Wallace, The Life and Works of Robert Burns (1896), I, 248. 13 J. DeLancey Ferguson, "Burns and Hugh Blair," MLN , XI (1930), 444. 14 HH, II, 311. "The fiddler" appears correctly in the Stewart ms. Note that nautical imagery remains associated with the fiddler in that ms. 15 Two songs printed in Johnson's Museum (1790) appear to be early versions of the tinker's song and the bard's first song (Robertson, Poetical Works , pp. 17-18). 16 F. B. Snyder, The Life of Robert Burns (1932), p. 164. 17 Some may at first be led to believe that the "fairy fiddler frae the neuk" (54) and "Poor Merry Andrew in the neuk" (83) refer to the same character because they are both specifically located in the corner of the tavern. Thus an attempt might be made to equate the Merry Andrew with the fiddler, who figures in the drama. But this equation is impossible (1) because the Merry Andrew is neither presented as a fiddler nor as diminutive, whereas the character referred to in ll. 54, 155-202, 223, 230 distinctively is; (2) because the characters of the two as seen in their songs are markedly distinct (the one witty, satirical, and self-justifying; the other good natured, emotional and carefree); and (3) because Burns would not likely present a single character singing two songs in the "plotted" part of the poem. The passing confusion which results from specifying so pointedly the corner location of both characters is eliminated by removing the Merry-Andrew section from the final version of the poem and is another indication of the difficulty of including it. 18 Can one argue that the Merry Andrew's satirical attack on institutions prepares, in the spirit of Gay's Beggar's Opera , for the female pickpocket's curse upon them? Perhaps one can, but such an argument is based on a notion of a sequence of themes, whereas here Burns has written primarily a little drama: this argument does not supply dramatic motivation for the Merry Andrew at all, and it supports a reading of the poem with no dramatic continuity between the end of the campfollower's song and the beginning of the next. 19 The only other critic, to my knowledge, who has noted the inappropriateness of the Merry-Andrew fragment is the anonymous writer of the "Advertisement" to the facsimile edition of the poem (1838, op. cit. ), "W. W.," who writes after summarizing the poem withou the passage in question (p. 7): "We have, as yet, said nothing of 'poor Merry Andrew i' the neuk,' and that for a reason which we shall be better able to make good to the satisfaction of the reader, after he has carefully examined the facsimile of the original MS. of the masterly poem. . . . The first four pages [i.e., the overture], and then the seventh, and from it to the close [i.e., the drama and finale], are apparently written at one stretch; the fifth and sixth [i.e., the Merry-Andrew section] are manifestly 'intercalated.' The hand-writing of these two is of a different time, and also of a different mood; so is the hero. That good-humoured, listless, selfrespectless creature could not have been fashioned by the bard when he was in the vein enthusiastic of the old soldier. Andrew is the jaded joker by profession, seen behind the scenes; the others are mumpers, giving a loose to the superfluity of gladness which has accumulated during a week of feigned suffering. Theirs is the fresh circling blood, and theirs are the crowing lungs of habitual wanderers in the pure air, over hill and by hedge side; his is the lassitude of one constrained to laugh when he has little will to it; he is the exception to which we alluded above [all but one of the characters in the poem "possess untamed, unbroken energy"]—he is, indeed, of 'the lowest of the low' [Walter Scott's phrase describing all the characters, to which W. W. took exception]. He is clearly an afterthought—the creature of another inspiration; he pleases by way of contrast: by himself he would be too much. There is the soul of melancholy in his— 'The chiel that's a fool for himsel'— Guid Lord, he's far dafter than I.'" The Merry Andrew is, as I have argued, not an "afterthought" but a part of an earlier version, a part discarded in favor of the existing version.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Harold Frederic: A Bibliography by Robert H. Woodward</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harold Frederic's career as a novelist lasted for only eleven years, from the publication of Seth's Brother's Wife in 1887 to his death in 1898, at the age of forty-two. Yet, all the while living the life of an active man-about-town in London and serving as the correspondent of the New York Times , he published three novels of contemporary Mohawk Valley life, two of which have been acclaimed as minor classics of realism; a historical novel about the American Revolution, considered by some critics as one of the most accurate historical novels to be written by an American; a series of Civil War stories, important for emancipating the genre from the romantic themes which still pervaded it; a book of critical sketches about English life; a novel about Ireland; three novels set in England; two books on current political affairs; and a modest list of short stories and essays. He also turned one of his novels into a play, almost completed a second dramatization of one of his works, wrote a play on mesmerism, and tried his hand at other dramatic pieces. Frederic was born in Utica, New York, on August 19, 1856, a child of the artisan class. His formal education terminated with his graduation from the Advanced School, on July 6, 1871, after which time he worked for local photographers as a printer and negative retoucher. From 1873 to 1875 he was in Boston, supported by his trade, and in 1875 he began his career in journalism as proofreader on the Utica Morning Herald . Soon he was employed by the Utica Observer , and worked his way to the position of editor in 1880. In September, 1882, he became editor of the Republican Albany Evening Journal ; when the newspaper changed hands in March, 1884, he obtained a place with the New York Times as London correspondent. In June, 1884, he sailed with his family for England; except for two visits to New York and occasional trips to the Continent and to Ireland, he spent the remainder of his life in England. His weekly cable letters to the Times earned him great respect as a correspondent and news analyst. He died October 19, 1898. Frederic is best remembered today as the author of the controversial The Damnation of Theron Ware , misread in its own time as an attack upon the clergy. He has been linked with the early naturalists and considered a pioneer in the revolt against the farm. At the present time, Frederic is receiving belated critical recognition. The present checklist of Frederic's writings fulfills a need which the recent attention to him is creating. There has been no published full-length study of Frederic, but he has been the subject of two doctoral dissertations: Paul Haines, Harold Frederic (New York University, 1945), and my own Harold Frederic: A Study of His Novels, Short Stories, and Plays (Indiana University, 1957). I wish to acknowledge the pioneer work done by Dr. Haines. It should be realized that I do not claim that the present checklist is complete; I will be grateful to others who may be able to add to my list. Frederic's newspaper writings are not considered in the present compilation.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Bibliographical Notes on F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Beautiful and Damned by Matthew J. Bruccoli</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although Collectors and Dealers Have Long Recognized the existence of a crux in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Beautiful and Damned (1922), the situation has been confused by the inexact application of bibliography using guesswork in place of analysis. When the copies of the novel are examined closely, the problem resolves itself. 1 Let us first look at the account as it now stands. Depending upon which catalogue one consults, two states or issues or variants of the first impression are said to exist, presumably resulting from the stop-press addition of the Scribner seal to the copyright page. The so-called second state has two additional leaves at the end of the novel, but these cannot be accounted for by any stop-press theory. The crucial, overlooked fact is that these two forms of the novel are gathered differently—the one without the seal is in 8's; that with the seal is normally in 16's. Thus we are dealing with a concealed impression. This is supported by the Scribner records, which indicate delivery of two pre-publication impressions. The only way by which the existence of two states of the first impression could be established is the discovery of a copy gathered in 8's, with the seal but without the extra leaves. No such copy has come to my attention, 2 and there is no reason to suppose that one exists. The priority of either of these pre-publication impressions cannot be established with any real certainty. But from the fact that subsequent impressions retain the seal and the extra leaves and are bound in 16's, it seems likely that the impression in 8's without the seal precedes the impression in 16's with the seal. The only copy available at the Library of Congress has been rebound, but its copyright page is without the seal. Binding states (that is, variants in the form of the casing) are of almost no bibliographical significance and should never be used to differentiate impressions; however, since collectors have given some attention to the binding variants of The Beautiful and Damned , no harm will be done by discussing them. The second impression includes two binding states, one in the standard Scribner B cloth, the other in FL cloth. 3 The FL-cloth binding state exists in two substates. 4 Substate A, which has the normal second impression make-up, is fairly common; the preliminary matter is in a gathering of 8 leaves, and the text is gathered in 16's. Substate B must be extremely rare. It is a composite made up of three gatherings from the first impression and 24 gatherings from the second impression. In order to avoid duplicate pages, two leaves had to be cancelled in the 16-leaf third gathering. 5 First Impression Copyright page : COPYRIGHT, 1922, BY / CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS / [rule] / Published March, 1922 / [rule] / COPYRIGHT. 1921, 1922, BY THE METROPOLITAN PUBLICATIONS, INC. / PRINTED AT / THE SCRIBNER PRESS / New York, U.

No advertisements. FL cloth. Although no textual alterations were made in the plates of The Beautiful and Damned, an interesting textual problem was introduced when the novel was republished in 1958. Since the original plates had been destroyed, and since the publisher wanted to avoid the expense of re-setting the novel, the new copies were manufactured by photo-offset. Before the pages of the book were photographed, 78 corrections were made in the text by pasting the printed corrections over the offending lines or by opaquing out some of the hyphens. 6 By strict application of the vocabulary of bibliography, the 1958 photo-offset copies represent only another impression (though a revised one) of the first edition of 1922, for they reproduce the original setting of type.
