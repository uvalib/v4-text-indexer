      <field name="heading_text">The Historiography of American Literary Publishing by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has now been fifteen years since William Charvat made his important comments on "Literary Economics and Literary History" before the English Institute. 1 Those remarks suggested a great many lines of inquiry into publishing history which were then virtually unexplored and indicated their undeniable relevance— indeed, their crucial significance—for meaningful literary history. However difficult the facts may be to come by and however frequent the crossing of disciplinary boundaries that may be required, one should not have to insist on the essential importance of technological, geographical, and economic factors, or of publishers' policies and copyright laws, or of the facilities for mass education and for book distribution— the importance of such areas as these for an informed study of the course of literary history. But if the relevance of these matters is obvious, what, one may ask, has been done to pursue the various lines mentioned by Professor Charvat? Or, to put the question more bluntly, how does it happen that, with so many graduate students searching for seminar and thesis topics, so few are directed toward work in a field where the labors of many men for many years to come will make only a beginning? It may be that the current fashions in literary scholarship are such that the instructor who must get out another article will choose to explicate a given poem for the fiftieth time rather than survey the output of a given publisher for the first time. Or it may be that fewer members of English departments are interested in publishing history than in explication, and that fewer members of history departments are drawn to the history of publishing than to the history of labor organizations or steel companies. But surely one cannot argue that publishing history is less "literary" than the biography of an author or less "historical" than the analysis of a statesman's oratorical style. And in any field the accomplishment of certain basic tasks is a prerequisite to progress in more inclusive tasks—which is not to say that publishing history cannot be considered a legitimate subject of endeavor in its own right, but simply that literary scholars may think of it at times only as the groundwork for other investigations. At any rate, the fact remains that the history of American literary publishing can still be called, in relative terms, a neglected field. To be sure, certain scholars, notably Professor Charvat himself, have drawn their graduate students into this area. In addition, American bibliographical journals have been hospitable to such research. 2 It is true also that, if the English had Cyprian Blagden to examine Elizabethan publishing, we have Rollo Silver and Lawrence Wroth to furnish us with details of the colonial publishers; if for nineteenth-century British publishing there are Edmund Blunden and Royal Gettmann, for American there are David Kaser, Warren Tryon, and Madeleine Stern; if the general course of British book production and distribution has been surveyed by Frank Mumby, the American has been treated by Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt. 3 We have our listings of regional imprints, our index to Evans, our histories of individual houses, our registers of printers and booksellers in a given book-trade center, our editions of cost-books. But we do not have a complete inventory of regional imprints, nor histories of all significant publishers, small and large, nor analyses of all book-publishing centers, nor edited versions of all important surviving records of publishing firms. We have, in other words, made an encouraging beginning, but we must recognize that the work of a handful of scholars, however dedicated and productive, can be no more than a beginning on a task of such magnitude. Comprehensive histories of American book production have been attempted, 4 and no one would deny that works like the Lehmann-Haupt volume have their usefulness—but it seems to me equally evident that further general histories would, at this stage, be pointless. Before anything approaching a full-scale history of American publishing can be embarked on, we must have the complete story of the individual publishers that make it up. It is helpful, as I say, to have had some of the broad outlines sketched in for us first; but the next step must inevitably be a return, for more intensive study, to the details on which those outlines were based. The writing of history always moves in such cycles, but in the writing of American publishing history we have arrived only at the beginning of the second stage, looking forward to the next level of synthesis and generalization. How are we to talk with authority about the characteristics of a particular publisher until we have listed every title he issued and discovered the circumstances of the publication of each title? How are we to comment, in any but pat generalizations, on the publishing of a particular period until we have made such a study of every publisher operative during that time? And how are we to trace with insight the course of American publishing from one period to another until we have examined each period in this way? It is my contention, therefore, that the small areas must be staked out next, before we can proceed to survey the wider, if only slightly greener, fields.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I What I am saying has, of course, been often recognized—as one can see by glancing at past achievements. Until recently the principal activity, understandably enough, was concerned with colonial printing and bookselling. For the early period, the study of literary publishing per se has been, because of the nature of colonial book production and its utilitarian purpose, subordinate to a study of printers and their types, though one should not, for that reason, fail to examine the booksellers (or the bookselling function of the printers), for their techniques of promotion and distribution lie more nearly at the center of "publishing" (as opposed to "printing") history. It is natural that the presses of Stephen Daye, Benjamin Franklin, William Bradford, and William Parks would be among those which have attracted the most attention, 5 and natural, too, that the first printers in various colonies have frequently been the subjects of research. 6 As comprehensive guides to the period we do have the work of Lawrence Wroth, Douglas McMurtrie, and Rollo G. Silver, 7 which have supplanted the earlier more casual commentaries; 8 and we have, in varying degrees of thoroughness, the inventories of imprints for particular areas 9 —but these can be construed as histories of literary publishing only in the most undigested form. We still need to have detailed accounts, with full descriptive bibliographies, of the work of other printers and booksellers—such as Robert Bell, Thomas Fleet, Samuel Kneeland, Benjamin Edes, Timothy Green, David Hall, Hugh Gaine, Benjamin Eliot, Daniel Henchman, and John Allen (of Boston), to name only a few out of hundreds. 10 If less has been done generally with the literary publishers of the turn of the nineteenth century, when Philadelphia was replacing Boston as the center of publishing and when the functions of printer, publisher, and bookseller were vaguely beginning to take their present shape, at least the two leading figures, Isaiah Thomas and Mathew Carey, have received their due in the researches of Clifford K. Shipton and E. L. Bradsher. The study of Carey has proceeded, in the hands of Lawrence Wroth, to one of Carey's traveling salesmen, the illustrious Mason Weems, and has moved on, led by David Kaser, to the years when the firm was known as Carey &amp; Lea. 11 But in neither of these cases do we have attempted a complete catalogue of the imprint. Nor do we have studies of other interesting firms like Isaac Riley, Joseph Nancrede, Robert Aitken, West &amp; Greenleaf, Samuel Hall, or James &amp; Thomas Swords. The nineteenth century has been the field of greatest activity in recent years. William Charvat's Rosenbach lectures of 1957-58 survey brilliantly the whole field of literary publishing for the first half of the century, and Donald Sheehan does the same thing for the Gilded Age. Madeleine B. Stern covers the entire century with a series of short well-documented accounts of seventeen important publishers, 12 including James P. Walker and Horace B. Fuller (publishers to the transcendentalists), John Russell of Charleston, Robert Fergus of Chicago, A. K. Loring, Frank Leslie, G. W. Carleton, and Dick &amp; Fitzgerald. The house that assembled the greatest galaxy of literary figures was, of course, Ticknor &amp; Fields, which has, accordingly, been studied most intensively—by Warren Tryon, William Charvat, and James Austin— while James Osgood, one of the later partners of the firm that descended from Ticknor &amp; Fields, has been treated by Carl J. Weber. 13 The later history of that company, as it transformed itself into Houghton Mifflin, has not been told in detail, nor have the literary activities of the other important Boston house, founded in 1837 by Charles C. Little and James Brown. In fact, one may say that the literary aspects of the large general publishers have been dealt with much less fully than have those of certain smaller, experimental (and perhaps more exclusively literary) firms. Our principal source of information about the great general houses of the nineteenth century, such as John Wiley (1807), Wiley &amp; Putnam (1838), James and John Harper (1817), Daniel Appleton (1825), J. B. Lippincott (1836), and Charles Scribner (Baker &amp; Scribner, 1846), is still only the commemorative or anniversary volumes which the firms themselves have issued from time to time. 14 Scholarly researches, including accurate catalogues of publications, have scarcely touched these firms (to say nothing of Jewett &amp; Co., Derby &amp; Jackson, and so on), nor the other large literary firms prominent later in the century, like E. P. Dutton (Ide &amp; Dutton, 1852), Henry Holt (Leypoldt &amp; Holt, 1866), Dodd, Mead (Taylor &amp; Dodd, 1839), Thomas Y. Crowell (1870), Century (1881), and Frederick A. Stokes (1881). Certain features of the literary book trade during this time have not gone unnoticed, however. Cincinnati, as the leading Western publishing center for much of the century (partly because of McGuffey's Readers ), has been investigated by Walter Sutton, 15 and there have been briefer studies of other regional publishing activity, as well as regional book-trade directories. 16 But the phenomenon of the Bobbs Merrill Co. (Hood &amp; Merrill, 1838) at Indianapolis, or of David McKay (1882) —known best perhaps to Whitman collectors—and John C. Winston (1884) at Philadelphia, has not been studied, nor have the numerous Chicago firms of this time, notably the forerunners of A. C. McClurg (W. W. Barlow, 1844). The whole problem of the geographical shifts in leadership, with New York assuming first place after midcentury, and with various outlying centers flourishing and declining, requires much further investigation, as does the popularity of reprints of British literature and the repercussions of edition binding. The relationships between authors and their publishers are important for understanding literary, as well as publishing, history, and they are beginning to be studied for the nineteenth century—in greatest detail, thus far, for Prescott, though that story involves English publishers as much as American. 17 This was also the age of dozens of companies producing cheap reprints on the worst of papers but in the most flamboyant of bindings. That general movement has been surveyed, 18 but it needs more detailed study—though for the Beadle dime novels we can hardly expect anything more detailed than Albert Johannsen's three-volume work. 19 Raymond Kilgour is making important contributions to our knowledge of individual publishers of this time with his work on Roberts Brothers and on Estes &amp; Lauriat, and we have some material on Mark Twain's publishing ventures, though not enough. 20 But the literary taste of the Gilded Age can never be adequately analyzed until we have thorough accounts of such publishers of subliterary works as Lee &amp; Shepard, D. Lothhrop &amp; Co., Porter &amp; Coates, and Henry Altemus. American literary publishers of the 1890's and the turn of the century were a colorful lot, but, despite their appeal (the piracies of Mosher and the Toulouse-Lautrec posters for Stone &amp; Kimball were among the more glamorous, but not uncharacteristic, episodes), they have not been treated so fully as they deserve. If one thinks first of Stone &amp; Kimball, it is partly because the history of that firm has been so thoroughly detailed by Sidney Kramer, in a book that includes bibliographical descriptions of all 309 titles issued and illustrates the use to which trade catalogues, advertisements, and book reviews may be put. 21 Hardly less influential as publisher to the American fin-desiècle (and the British, too, since it was the American publisher of the Yellow Book ) was the Boston firm of Copeland &amp; Day, whose history and output have been studied by Joe Walker Kraus in a Master's thesis (modeled on Kramer's work) at the University of Illinois in 1941. 22 Mention of Illinois brings to mind how indebted we are to the Library School there for much of the knowledge we do have of this period. Particularly under the supervision of P. L. Windsor and Anne M. Boyd, Master's candidates and students in Library 102 prepared a series of pioneering theses and term papers in the 1930's (available at present in the stacks of the University Library). 23 We owe also to an Illinois doctoral dissertation our most thorough study of Thomas B. Mosher, the Portland publisher of limited editions, whose firm, though extending beyond the nineties, was in its heyday at the turn of the century. 24 English literary publishers had begun to establish American branches by this time (the earliest was Macmillan in 1869, followed in 1875 by Longmans Green and in 1896 by the Oxford University Press); but we have no detailed treatment of these branches, and the American branch of the principal British avant-garde publisher of the nineties, Elkin Mathews &amp; John Lane, has been treated only peripherally in J. Lewis May's book. 25 Beyond these, what do we have for the nineties? Where can we go for information about Way &amp; Williams, or Lamson, Wolffe, or R. H. Russell? Where do we learn about the important general publishers established during the nineties, such as L. C. Page (1892) and Frank N. Doubleday &amp; S. S. McClure (1897)? 26 The story of that period still has to be written, and it will depend for its information on careful studies of all these publishers. For the twentieth century, the scholarship is even more meager. The works that exist deal not so much with particular firms as with special subjects, such as private presses and fine printing, 27 best sellers, 28 university presses, 29 book clubs, 30 and even (though hardly literary) textbook and reference work publishers. 31 There is also no end to the general surveys of the state of the book industry—largely economic studies, not literary, though they will be useful to future historians of the literary economics of the mid-twentieth century. 32 But what solid work has been done on the individual publishers of literature in this century? Despite the logic of attempting to establish the record of these firms while it is still possible to consult the files or interview the persons involved, almost nothing has been achieved. Seemingly, no one has yet been attracted to those large publishers particularly associated with the first three decades of the century, like Frank N. Doubleday, George H. Doran, Stanley M. Rinehart, John Farrar, Alfred Harcourt, Donald Brace, Harold Guinzburg, W. W. Norton, Richard L. Simon, and M. Lincoln Schuster. But, perhaps more surprisingly, the smaller, more experimental, more militantly literary or artistic or socialistic firms—the real representatives of the personal publisher in twentieth-century America—have not been studied either: such men as Mitchell Kennerley, B. W. Huebsch, Alfred A. Knopf, Albert and Charles Boni, Horace Liveright, Thomas Seltzer, Lincoln MacVeagh, Robert McBride, and Pascal Covici. There can be no question that the story of a great deal of the most important twentieth-century American literature is bound up with these men, and with other even smaller publishers, like Lieber &amp; Lewis, Frank Shay, Egmont Arens, and the Sunwise Turn. 33 The facts which author-bibliographies have turned up about some of these publishers cannot substitute for full-scale treatments of them as important men in their own right (not simply as the publishers of James Joyce, or Sherwood Anderson, or Edna Millay, and so on). The task is an essential one, and the materials for performing it are becoming more difficult of access every day, as anyone who has tried to compile a catalogue of a twentieth-century firm will testify. In absolute terms, of course, the materials are far more plentiful than for earlier periods, but that is to be expected; what is decidedly discouraging, however, is that scholars are not currently utilizing the masses of papers which, in the minds of too many publishers, are not worthy of preservation. We do at present have the means, if we have the will, to write the history of the publication of modern literature in America— and to write it fully, not as loose surveys of miscellaneous facts or as fanciful embroiderings of conjectured details, which some of our past histories of earlier publishers have had to be (or have been). Even a brief sketch of what has been accomplished in the historical study of American literary publishing reveals, besides the industry of a few dedicated scholars, the huge gaps, in all periods, which remain to be filled. And even a brief perusal of the prefaces to the studies mentioned here should provide a large enough record of difficulties, not to drive away future students, but to attract more of the same caliber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The differences which one discerns between the kinds of research into publishing history performed for different periods—the emphasis at one time on typography, at another on sales and distribution, or at another on biography—constitute an index to the changing categories of materials available for various periods, as well as to the changing nature of the publisher's calling. There are basically five kinds of materials for the study of American literary publishing: 1) records, papers, and other files of the firms themselves; 2) the published trade catalogues of the firms; 3) contemporary national or regional bibliographies, or retrospective lists; 4) reminiscences and memoirs of publishers and others associated with the book-trade; 5) contemporary references, ranging from the publishers' own advertisements or posters to book reviews, columns of literary gossip, and lists of "books received." On the basis of the relative availability or scarcity of the materials in each of these categories, we can divide the study of American publishing into certain periods, in terms of methodology. It should go without saying that the books themselves, which the publishers produced, form the central material of study, toward which these five categories are various routes; but the scarcity of the books to be studied (or, for modern periods, their great proliferation) remains another factor, beyond but not unrelated to these five, which affects the methodology and the reliability of publishing historiography. Because the third category listed above, consisting of the national bibliographic registries, is generally at the center of all attempts to establish the output of a given publishing firm, it is well at the outset to be aware of the peculiarities of the records available for different periods. For American bibliography, the chief retrospective lists are Evans, Shaw-Shoemaker, and Sabin, and one must, of course, rely on retrospective (rather than current) lists for the early period. The original twelve volumes of Charles Evans' American Bibliography , published between 1903 and 1934, cover the years 1639 through part of 1799, chronologically by year and alphabetically by author within the year; each volume has two indexes, one of authors and one of subjects, and a list (but not index) of printers. Clifford K. Shipton published a thirteenth volume in 1955, bringing the record through 1800, and Roger P. Bristol has now provided an author-title index (1959) and an index of printers (1961) for the entire set. Though Evans (with 39,162 titles) supersedes the only previous record, the famous "Haven list" (a 350-page supplement prepared by Samuel Foster Haven for the 1874 edition of Isaiah Thomas' History of Printing ), there are still a great many omitted items—so that, until these are all brought together, a number of other lists and articles, like the Waters list, must be consulted. 34 The years 1801 through 1819 (amounting to 50,192 items) are now covered, in nineteen yearly volumes, by the most recent of these retrospective researches (1958-1963), the work of Ralph R. Shaw and Richard H. Shoemaker; these volumes are not as yet indexed. The third of these great catalogues, Joseph Sabin's Bibliotheca Americana: A Dictionary of Books Relating to America . . . , with 106,413 entries in 29 volumes (published between 1868 and 1936, and completed by such eminent bibliographers as Wilberforce Eames and R. W. G. Vail), is not, technically, a national bibliography, since it includes works relating to America published in other countries, but it is useful both because of its large scope and because of the additional bibliographical references it gives for many items. In using Sabin one should keep in mind the reductions in its scope made in 1929, 1932, and 1933. Before volume XXI (1929) the scope was Sabin's original one—to attempt the listing of everything connected with the Americas (North and South) down to the date of the current volume itself; beginning with volume XXI, only works to 1876 were listed. In 1932 (with part 130, beginning with "South Carolina") the date was pushed back to 1860, and in 1933 (with part 141, beginning "Stuart") to 1840. For certain categories, the cut-off date was considerably earlier in each case, and literary scholars should remember that, from 1932 on, most poetry, drama, and fiction published after 1800 was omitted. 35 For most of the nineteenth century, one may use contemporary bibilographies, chiefly Roorbach, Kelly, and the American Catalogue . Orville Roorbach's original publication was partially retrospective, since he first issued his Bibliotheca Americana in 1849, covering the years from 1820. He brought out a current supplement in 1850, followed by a new consolidated edition in 1852; thereafter, three supplements (in 1855, 1858, and 1861) brought the record to 1861. His work consists of an author-title alphabet (no subject index), and one peculiarity (aside from the errors and omissions) is that the various elements of each entry are arranged in columns, so that, if one has the patience, it is possible to search for a particular publisher's books by running one's eye down the publisher-column of each page. James Kelly's American Catalogue (2 vols., 1866, 1871) is the companion work, using the same arrangement, for the years 1861-1870. National bibliography in the last three decades of the century is bound up with the official trade journal, Publishers' Weekly , founded in 1872 by Frederick Leypoldt—but actually a continuation of various earlier journals like Charles B. Norton's Literary Advertiser, Literary Gazette (1851-55), Literary Register (1852-56), and Literary Letter (1857-62), the American Literary Gazette and Publishers' Circular (1855-72), and the Trade Circular and Publishers' Bulletin (1869-71). 36 Leypoldt's first American Catalogue (2 vols., 1880) lists, in two alphabets (author-title and subject) the books in print on 1 July 1876; one feature of interest to students of publishing is that there is an appendix of publishers' lists of their books published since 1876. Under the editorship of R. R. Bowker, the office of Publishers' Weekly put out seven permanent supplements to the American Catalogue (covering 1876-84, 1884-90, 1890-95, 1895-1900, 1900-05, 1905-07, 1908-10). It should be understood that the American Catalogue is based on the weekly record of new publications as listed in Publishers' Weekly ; and it should be remembered that there are two alphabets in each volume before 1900, one after. Publishers' Weekly , of course, continues to the present, but the American Catalogue was replaced at the turn of the century by two new publications of the now well-known H. W. Wilson Company, the Cumulative Book Index and the United States Catalog . The first of these was published monthly, beginning in 1898, and then cumulated annually into one author-title-subject alphabet. The difference between this publication and the United States Catalog is that the latter does not record all books produced in a given period but only those still in print at a particular time. The first volume (1900) lists the books in print at the beginning of 1899 (in two alphabets, one for author, one for title); the second edition (1903) does the same for 1902 (now in one author-title- and -subject index), the third (1912) for 1912, and the fourth (1928) for 1928 (there was also a supplement to the second edition in 1906 covering the books published 1902-05). After 1928 there is only the Cumulative Book Index , brought together in huge four-year cumulations (beginning with 1957-58, two-year cumulations); at that time its scope was increased to include all books published in the English language. 37 The student of publishing should not fail to notice the value of the comprehensive lists of publishers and their addresses in each of these volumes. The historian of twentieth-century American publishing has one further national bibliography at his disposal, one that is far more important for his purposes than the Cumulative Book Index —the Catalogue of Copyright Entries issued by the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress. Though this record is limited to works copy-righted in the United States and is therefore not a complete record of publication, it is of obvious usefulness for establishing the core of a publisher's output and dating the titles, since it has an index that lists, in addition to authors, the copyright holders—who are, frequently, the publishers. Thus, while the Cumulative Book Index can be used only to check on titles after they are known (since it has no publisher index), the index to the Catalogue of Copyright Entries can at times be used to establish a basic, though almost certainly partial, chronological catalogue of a given imprint (basic in the sense that these listings constitute proof of the existence of the books, recorded as they are from the actual deposit copies). Theoretically, copyright records should not be limited in their usefulness to the twentieth century, because the first American copyright law was passed in 1790. But the story of the repeated efforts of dedicated men to establish a national copyright catalogue is a very discouraging one. 38 Our principal copyright laws are those of 1790, 1870, 1891, and 1909. The 1790 law did provide for the deposit and registry of copies, but this procedure was to be handled by the various district courts, resulting in inefficiencies and inaccuracies even for those books which the authors or publishers decided to register. Our fragmentary published record of early nineteenth-century copyrights consists, then, of only two lists: 1) the 1822, 1823, 1824, and 1825 supplements to S. A. Elliot's A List of Patents . . . (1820), containing about 950 titles deposited between 1796 and May 1825; 2) Charles Coffin Jewett's "Copy-right Publications," in the form of two appendixes to the 1850 report of the Smithsonian Institution, listing 2,057 titles deposited between 1846 and 1850. 39 The only other related published record for these years is the Library of Congress catalogues of holdings, then issued complete at ten-year intervals with annual supplements. The copyright-deposit books are incorporated into the alphabetical listing in the complete catalogues, but some of the annual volumes (like the one in 1846) have copyright entries listed separately; for the first part of the alphabet, the Alphabetical Catalogue of the Library of Congress: Authors (1864-80) is a place to check for the period after mid-century. In using these catalogues or the Smithsonian's records, however, one must keep in mind the shifting status of these places as depositories. Deposit copies went (from the district courts) to the Secretary of State until August 1846; to the Smithsonian, the Library of Congress, and the Secretary of State from 1846 until early 1859; to the Department of the Interior and nowhere else from 1859 to 1865; and to the Library of Congress as well as to the Department of the Interior from 1865 until the act of 8 July 1870, when the Library of Congress was made the sole depository. The importance of the 1870 act lies in the fact that it consolidated the entire copyright administration, including the function of registry formerly assigned to the district courts, into one central office. It was not, however, until the celebrated "international" copyright law of 3 March 1891 that official provision was made for a published catalogue of copyright entries. Beginning 1 July 1891—and continuing to the present—these records have been published, but their early years were so experimental in form that one is justified in thinking of the copyright Catalogue as a twentieth-century reference tool. From the beginning it has recorded (like the two earlier brief catalogues) books deposited and therefore physically existing (in contrast to the district court records, which listed registrations of forthcoming books that may never have appeared), and the Catalogue was declared by law in 1909 to constitute prima facie evidence of the facts it contained. But this weekly Catalogue of Title-Entries , as it was first called, did not include the dates of receipt of deposit copies until during its seventh year (beginning 13 September 1897), did not give the official copyright dates until 1898, and did not provide cumulated indexes until 1901. As a matter of fact, it did not become really satisfactory for reference until July of 1906, when the responsibility for publication of the Catalogue was shifted from the Treasury Department to the Copyright Office itself; at that time Thorvald Solberg, to emphasize the improved form which the Catalogue was to take on in his office, began a new series in the volume-numbering and changed the title to the Catalogue of Copyright Entries . 40 From that time on, a search of the copyright records is relatively easy and can be accomplished by recourse simply to the printed Catalogue ; but information about earlier copyrights remains very difficult of access, though it is all available in the Copyright Office, since the record books of the clerks of the district courts for the period 1790-1870 (transferred to the Copyright Office in 1870) 41 and the records of the Office itself for the period 1870-1897 are imperfectly indexed. 42 The Catalogue from 1906, then, until 1940 (when the War made necessary, unfortunately, a very abbreviated form of entry and index) 43 is a most remarkable work of reference. The entries, printed from the linotype slugs used for the Library of Congress cards, contain all the information (as to date, pagination, title-page transcription, and so on) available on those cards, plus certain other facts, usually three: 1) the copyright date; 2) the date of deposit of two copies in the Copyright Office; 3) the date of receipt of an affidavit of American manufacture. 44 It should be understood that, before the Act of 1909, the official date of copyright was the date on which the title was entered for registry, not the date on which it was published or received; since that time the date of copyright has been construed as the official date of publication reported by the publishers. Clearly, the appearance of any book may have been delayed beyond the predicted publication date, and the actual publication date may differ from the copyright date listed; but the fact remains that, since 1909, the copyright records do give the intended (and often actual) publication date, while before that time they provide only a terminus a quo . The date of deposit of copies is usually later than the copyright date, but with different significance for the pre- and post-1909 years. Before 1909 it was required that copies be deposited not later than the publication date— a fact which pushes forward the terminus a quo ; after 1909, since the copyright date is identical with the publication date, the copies, obviously, were generally deposited after publication. The Catalogue lists, for published books, only those actually received and not simply all the titles registered in the Office records. 45 The third item, the affidavit of American manufacture, was required only after 1909 and often differs (if at all) from the deposit date by a matter of days. 46 With this information about national bibliographies as a background, it is possible to divide American publishing roughly into three periods, in terms of the methodology required for historical research: 1) the period before the copyright law of 1790, in which only retrospective lists are available; 2) the years between 1790 and the early 1870's, in which fragmentary copyright records may sometimes be used to supplement the somewhat unreliable Roorbach and Kelly lists; and 3) the time since the early 1870's, which saw the establishment, not only of the Copyright Office as the consolidated central agency, but of the Publishers' Weekly , the Publishers' Trade List Annual , and the American Catalogue . One should remember, too, for each of these periods, to refer to whatever national bibliographies of other countries (particularly England) are available; for one's task in the study of an American publisher must include, for each title, information as to whether it originated with him, was reprinted from an earlier British edition, or consisted simply of the British sheets with an American (or joint) title page and casing. The English Catalogue is especially helpful since it provides, from 1800 on, the month, as well as the year, of publication for each book and since it has generally been cumulated quinquennially. 47 The whole area of the relation between English and American publication dates (for both English and American works) needs to be investigated, as David Randall has tantalizingly implied by entering American publication dates in his catalogue of the Lilly Library exhibition (1963) of books on the Grolier List. For the first of these periods, since the function of printer and publisher was not always distinct, publishing history is almost identical with typographical history. Papers and records of colonial printers do not, as a rule, survive (though there are occasional documents like the Franklin &amp; Hall account book at the New York Public), and printers' catalogues of publications for this period are scarce (though Franklin, Hugh Gaine, Samuel Hall, and others did issue them). The index to Evans can be used to establish a basic list for a given printer, one that may then be supplemented by reference not only to other lists of early imprints but to contemporary newspapers. The printer who published a newspaper was likely to advertise his own books prominently, and booksellers' notices also appeared regularly. Though the latter will probably not contain names of printers, they are useful for approximating publication dates of particular titles and sometimes for ascertaining prices. For example, John Mein inserted extensive lists of books for sale in his shop in the Boston Chronicle , which was published by Mein &amp; Fleeming. 48 Kneeland &amp; Green's announcements in their own paper, the New England Weekly Journal , are another case in point—as when they say, on 4 April 1738, that "In a few Days will be Published" an Essay Concerning Silver and Paper Currency and then report, on 11 April, that the Essay "This Day is Published." One does not, however, expect great accuracy in these notices: the same paper announced Eliphalet Adams' Sermon . . . on . . . the Execution of Katherine Garret as "Just Published" on 4 July and again on 18 July. Nevertheless, when the Massachusetts Gazette , on 24 November 1786, lists a new edition of Webster's Spelling Book (for sale by Peter Edes and John Boyle) as "this day published," one does at least have a rough indication of the time of publication. But more advertisements, unfortunately, will be for runaway slaves or tea than for books. Reviews may occasionally furnish needed information about a work, but much of the time the reviewing was not extensive enough to be a substantial guide nor prompt enough to be useful for dating. Reminiscences are scanty, too, but there are the journals of Hugh Gaine or Franklin's Autobiography to provide some insight into the workings of the book trade and printing establishments at the time. 49 The next period, 1790-1870, offers more materials for investigation. If the papers of publishers are not exactly plentiful for these years, they are much fuller than for the preceding period—the Lea &amp; Febiger Papers in the Pennsylvania Historical Society, further Carey papers in the American Antiquarian Society along with the Isaiah Thomas material, the Fields Papers at Huntington, the Dix &amp; Edwards Papers and the Ticknor Papers at Harvard, the large collection of papers concerning the publishing industry in the Harvard Baker Library 50 —and our two published cost books, of Carey &amp; Lea and Ticknor &amp; Fields, pertain to this time. The practice of binding catalogues or announcements into the backs of published volumes became widespread (thus preserving many which would otherwise be lost), and their very usefulness, occasionally, in distinguishing between printings of a book is also indicative of their value as a guide to the chronology of an imprint. Advertisements are still a help, but once the boundary of 1790 is crossed the copyright ledger books of the district courts offer a possible source of corroboration. The fact that Royall Tyler's The Contrast , for example, was advertised as "just published" in the Massachusetts Centinel for 22 May 1790 brings one at least to the vicinity of the publication date —supported by the copyright entry in the Pennsylvania district court record book on 15 June 1790. As the century moved on, the proliferation of magazines and newspapers which reviewed books, like the Knickerbocker, Democratic Review, Burton's, Graham's, Atlantic Monthly, Scribner's , and Broadway Journal , provides further possibilities for checking dates. The first publication of "The Raven" in book form can thus be pushed back as far as April 1845, since Vandenhoff's Plain System of Elocution , in which it appeared, was reviewed in the New York Weekly News on April 19. 51 Of course, the whole perplexed copyright situation at this time must be taken into account in any explanation of a publisher's decisions. 52 A good source of technical information for mid-century is Jacob Abbott's The Harper Establishment (1855). And the reminiscences of publishers or their friends are always worth consulting—especially such storehouses of information as Joseph T. Buckingham's Personal Memoirs and Recollections of an Editorial Life (1852), J. C. Derby's Fifty Years Among Authors , Books , and Publishers (1884), John W. Moore's Historical , Biographical , and Miscellaneous Gatherings . . . Relative to Printers , Printing , Publishing and Editing . . . (1886), Samuel G. Goodrich's Recollections of a Lifetime (1857), and James T. Fields' Yesterdays with Authors (1871) and Biographical Notes and Personal Sketches (1881). Douglas McMurtrie has reprinted (1929) Henry Lemoine's Present State of Printing and Bookselling in America (1796), and Mathew Carey's Autobiography (1829) has been reissued (1942). Less well-known memoirs can be turned up, too, like Walter Carter's Autobiography and Reminiscence (1907), Uriel Crocker's Memorial (1891), John C. Holbrook's Recollections of a Nonagenarian (1897), or Hubert H. Bancroft's Literary Industries (1891), and an important series of 41 reminiscences of American publishers appeared in the New York Evening Post between November 1874 and September 1875. To the extent that booksellers in the earlier years more nearly performed the promotional function of the publisher than the printer did, one may find much relevant information in book-trade directories of a given area, especially the retrospective ones issued by the New York Public Library. 53 The really distinguishing feature, however, about this period is the great number of retrospective lists of regional imprints that are continually being made available. To be sure, for the Atlantic coast the checklists of early imprints take one back into the preceding period and for some western states take one up as far as 1890, but in general one can say that the bulk of this work has dealt with the first three quarters of the nineteenth century. The undisputed dean of regional imprint recording was Douglas C. McMurtrie, who had issued checklists of imprints for Chicago (1836-50), Colorado (1859-76), Louisiana (1764-1810), Maine (1792-1820), Michigan (1796-1850), South Carolina (1731-40), Tennessee (1793-1830), Utah (1849-60), and Wisconsin (1833-50), in addition to numerous briefer studies of imprints, between 1927 and 1935, before the work of the American Imprints Inventory began. He was the natural choice as director of that phase of the WPA's Historical Records Survey. Between 1936 and 1942, under his leadership, with a central office in Chicago, the Imprints Inventory brought out 37 checklists which cover early printing in Alabama (1807-40), Arizona (1860-90), Arkansas (1821-76), California (1833-55), Chicago (1851-71), Florida (1784-1860), Idaho (1839-90), Iowa (1838-60), Kansas (1854-76), Kentucky (1787-1820), Massachusetts (1801-02), Michigan (1796-1850), Minnesota (1849-65), Missouri (1808-50), Nebraska (1847-76), Nevada (1859-90), New Jersey (1784-1800), New Mexico (1784-1876), Ohio (1796-1820), Tennessee (1793-1850), Washington (1853-76), West Virginia (1791-1830), Wisconsin (1833-63), and Wyoming (1866-90). 54 These lists represent the work of 2000 staff members who amassed fifteen million slips by searching 5000 libraries; the original intention was to record all pioneer imprints to 1876 (when the American Catalogue began)—or to 1890 in eight western states—but the project was unfinished at the time the WPA terminated. Four later volumes growing out of the Inventory have appeared under the auspices of the Bibliographical Society of America: the Dakotas (1858-89) and Arkansas (1821-76), edited by Albert H. Allen in 1947; Rhode Island (1727-1800) by John E. Alden in 1949; and Oklahoma (1835-90) by Lester Hargrett in 1951. McMurtrie himself also continued to issue volumes separately from the WPA series, such as those for Chicago (1835-50), Indiana (1804-49), Mississippi (1798-1830), Montana (1864-80), North Carolina (1749-1800), North Dakota (1874-90), Oregon (1847-70), and a number of New York towns. In addition, he had a few distinguished forerunners, such as Charles R. Hildeburn on Pennsylvania, 1685-1784 (1885), Stephen B. Weeks on North Carolina (1890), J. H. Trumbull on Connecticut, 1709-1800 (1904), and Lawrence C. Wroth on Maryland, 1686-1776 (1922); and, since 1935, several other states have found able recorders, notably Alabama (1807-70), California (1833-62), Maine (1785-1820), Maryland again (1777-1810), South Carolina, Tennessee (1861-66), and Texas (1795-1860), along with work on Vermont (to 1820) and West Virginia (to 1863). 55 Since 1950, students in the Department of Library Science at the Catholic University of America have turned out over forty regional imprint lists as theses, covering Connecticut (1801-10), Delaware (1801-62), Maine (1821-35), Maryland (1811-76), Michigan (1851-55), Mississippi (1831-40), North Carolina (1801-20, 1866-76), Rhode Island (1821-50), and a number of cities and other areas. 56 Though far from complete, and published in a maddeningly inconvenient way, these imprint records furnish our most reliable guides to the publications of this period and should always be consulted in addition to the considerably less trustworthy Roorbach and Kelly. When indexed by imprint, they can be used (like Evans) to establish a basic list for a given firm. The essential difference, however, between the recording of imprints and research into the history of publishing should be borne in mind. The student of imprints is interested in the development and spread of printing; the student of publishing history is concerned partly with printing, but also with the economic factors entering into relations with authors, public taste, book distribution, and the like. The distinction between printing and publishing, important for all periods, becomes so pronounced during this period that the recording of imprints by locality can be no substitute for the further analysis of imprints by publisher. Imprint recording has been pursued industriously and has provided raw material for the historian of publishing, but it in no way reduces his obligation to rearrange that material in other patterns which reveal other kinds of significance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Since my own recent work has been concerned with publishing in the third of these periods, the years since 1870, I should like to comment on the available materials in somewhat greater detail and illustrate some common problems in reconstructing a publisher's list with examples drawn from this period. Further, the publishing history of these years is in greatest need of scholarship—though much remains to be done in the earlier periods as well—and perhaps a fuller description of possible procedures and approaches is therefore in order. If the period is less challenging to the mind which enjoys a maximum exploitation of a minimum number of facts, it should be all the more attractive to the temperament which delights in finding order in an overwhelming mass of information. The huge increase in the volume of books produced makes this the most complex of the periods and necessitates an even greater amount of study in individual firms before a meaningful pattern of trends and movements can be discerned. Of the three chief tools for the period, two began in the early 1870's (both originating in the office of Frederick Leypoldt), and it is their indispensability which largely justifies dating this third methodological period from their inception. One is the Publishers' Trade List Annual , a device for making permanently accessible the yearly catalogues of nearly all publishers. Its basic purpose is obviously to make current catalogues conveniently available to booksellers, but the accumulation of non-current volumes on library shelves is a great boon to the student of publishing, who would otherwise have to contact the individual publishers he was concerned with, only to find, perhaps, that the ephemeral catalogues for various years had disappeared from the files. Most publishers of any significance have inserted their annual catalogue of publications in PTLA , and those who issued only a few titles in a given year often have a portion of a page in a special indexed supplementary section. In the early years there was an index and then the Publishers' Weekly annual list as well, but by the late 1880's the index was abandoned, to be revived only in 1902-04 before the inauguration in 1948 of Books in Print ; in the 1890's the PW list was also discontinued as duplicative, so that the Annual by the turn of the century had evolved into its present form, consisting only of publishers' catalogues. The practice certain publishers have had of listing even their out-of-print books, as well as their forthcoming publications, makes this work the obvious and basic tool for research on a firm's output; the difficulties encountered in establishing the list for a publisher who did not submit his catalogues (such as Samuel French in the 1870's or Mitchell Kennerley for most of the period of his firm's existence) is testimony of the degree to which the information in this work is both essential and taken for granted. Since a publisher's intentions, as reflected in his catalogues, do not always coincide with the facts as they turn out, one must therefore have recourse to the second of these tools, Publishers' Weekly . Established in January 1872 as the Publishers' and Stationers' Weekly Trade Circular , and changing its name to Publishers' Weekly on 2 January 1873, it is the chief source of book-trade news as well as of weekly lists of new publications. At first called "Order List of Books Just Published or Forthcoming" (arranged by publisher), this weekly list became, by mid-February 1872, the "Alphabetical List of Books Just Published" (by author), followed by an "Order List" (by publisher), and, by 18 August 1877, simply the "Weekly Record." From the beginning, the first issue of each month carried an "Alphabetical Reference List" of all books listed during the preceding month (with reference to the week of full listing), and sometimes these lists were placed together as an annual record, though the usual annual record through 1885 was an author and title index to publishers' summaries of their output (and each publisher was urged to make his first advertisement each year a complete list of the preceding year's publications). In 1887, however, the last January issue contained a full annual list (for 1886) with reference to the full weekly listing of each title, a feature that continued through January 1911 (for 1910). The "Order List," a rearrangement of each week's listing by publisher (and of obvious value to the student of publishing) was discontinued with the issue of 1 February 1908. Though not handled consistently, the years 1900 through 1911 generally had quarterly cumulations as well as monthly and annual ones—that is, the April issue would list, not simply books of March, but those of the first three months of the year; July would contain a six-month cumulation; and October would put together the publications of July, August, and September. 57 But after October 1911 there were no more quarterly cumulations, only monthly; and the monthly lists ended with December 1918 (in January 1919). These cumulations—whether annual (through 1910), quarterly (through October 1911), or monthly (through December 1918)—are easier to consult (as indexes to the weekly lists) than fifty-two weekly ones (and better, too, since they contain titles not present in the weekly record), but after 1918 (until 1935) one has no choice but to search each weekly list (not facilitated by the weekly title index instituted 1 July 1922). In July of 1935 a monthly title index began, serving the function of the old monthly cumulation, but it has now been replaced (as of January 1960) with the very efficient, separately published American Book Publishing Record . For the years in which there is no other form of cumulation, the indexes to announcements of fall and spring books can be helpful (in more recent years containing predicted publication dates). The third main tool, the Catalogue of Copyright Entries , has already been described. But one should remember the significance of entries both in it and in Publishers' Weekly —particularly since some scholars have used one or the other as direct and reliable evidence of publication dates. A book may not actually appear until long after the publication date given in the copyright record, or it may be out (in some cases) long before its entry in Publishers' Weekly . Both records are quite accurate, as much as it is in their power to be, but everything depends on the habits of the publishers. One publisher may never meet his announced publication dates; another may always meet them. One may not get his books delivered to the office of Publishers' Weekly promptly (and then deliver a large batch at one time); another may have them sent immediately upon publication. Disagreements among scholars as to the relative reliability of these records have usually arisen from the relative promptness and efficiency of the publishers on whom they were working. 58 It is possible to construct a fairly efficient procedure, based on the nature of these tools, for establishing a chronological catalogue of a given firm's output. Such a procedure would consist, basically, of four steps. First, one should check the catalogues of the firm (for every year of its existence) in the Publishers' Trade List Annual , making a card for every title listed and keeping a record in one corner of each card indicating the years in which that title was listed. It is essential that every annual catalogue be examined, even for those firms which attempt to list all their publications, past as well as present, for certain titles inevitably are overlooked or dropped from year to year (or transferred to another publisher—these are, after all, order catalogues). Thus if one looked only at the last catalogue or two of B. W. Huebsch (which do in fact list most of his publications), one would miss Carl D. Thompson's Municipal Ownership , Melville Anderson's Happy Teacher , and Robert Aitken's Beyond the Skyline . Record should also be made on these cards of any other information supplied in the catalogue, such as descriptive remarks about new books or the fact that a book is "forthcoming" or "Ready in November." The completed set of cards will, in this way, be a presumably full listing of a firm's output, as announced by the firm itself, with an indication of the length of time each book remained in print. Since these catalogues more often than not are arranged alphabetically by author, it is an easy matter to finish this first stage of work with the cards also in alphabetical order. Before proceeding to the second step, one should take the time to make a typed list of these authors and titles: this list will serve as a brief reference guide for the imprint, since the cards will not be in alphabetical order again but will be transformed through succeeding stages into a chronological arrangement; it will also serve as the basis for the index to the imprint catalogue and will obviate a final re-alphabetizing of the cards. This much accomplished, one's second stop should be at the English Catalogue shelf. The arrangement there is alphabetical by author in five-year cumulations. One can tell from the first date recorded on each card the probable publication year, and one simply starts through the cards checking each title that falls within the span of the English Catalogue volume for the earliest years of the firm's existence. For each of these titles published in England, one should record the publisher and month and year of publication (and perhaps the number of pages, a rough clue—later—to whether or not the English and American sheets are identical). Any good catalogue of an American imprint must contain information about English publication and its relation to the American publication by the firm involved, and this information might as well be entered on the cards while they are in alphabetical order. If the cards falling within each volume of the English Catalogue are separated from the others after being checked, one not only will be sure of having checked all the cards but will have them arranged alphabetically within five-year groupings. It is true, of course, that certain titles coming near the beginning or end of each five-year span, if not located in the first volume consulted, should be checked in the preceding or succeeding volume, since they may have been published in England several months before or after their American publication. Common-sense shortcuts, too, suggest themselves: if one knows a particular author to be British, for example, one expects to find that his books have been published earlier in England than in America. The third stage of this process, for publishers after 1891 (and especially after 1906), is a search of the Catalogue of Copyright Entries ; for publishers in the two preceding decades this step must of necessity be omitted, but in those cases some attempt should be made to secure copyright information directly from the Copyright Office. One starts through the cards again, this time checking the titles for any one year in the index to the appropriate annual volume and entering the index numbers (in use through 1945, as described above) on the cards. Any copyrighted work will be listed under its author, but any work copyrighted in the name of the publisher will be entered also (through 1938) under his name; it is therefore simpler to check the authors' names first, so long as one does not fail to glance at the publisher's listing before leaving the index, to make sure that no books are recorded here which were not announced in the publisher's catalogues and for which one thus has no card. The cards are then arranged by index-numbers, the index-numbers looked up, and further data placed on the cards: accurate title-page information, number of pages, size, price (sometimes), official date of publication, date of deposit of copies, date of affidavit, and name of copyright holder. Naturally one checks the unlocated items, as before, in the next succeeding volume. At this stage one's cards are roughly in chronological order according to copyright (publication) date. The fourth round takes one to Publishers' Weekly , where one's task is lighter or heavier depending on the kind of cumulations made in the years involved (as explained above). In any case one's job is to locate the "Weekly Record" in which each title is listed. If the year is one with an annual cumulation, the work is relatively painless; if it is one without even monthly cumulations, it is indeed exasperating, but the chronological arrangement of the cards offers some guidance. For the years before 1908, with the weekly "Order List," one can search each issue without great effort and should certainly do it, as a further check on the possibility of previously unnoticed titles. The date of the "Weekly Record" will be placed on each card, with any other new information found in the listing (generally, the price and a brief description of the contents of the volume). Before each volume of Publishers' Weekly is closed, there is a general, as well as an advertisers', index to be consulted. Each of the firm's advertisements should be studied and the date of each advertisement for any title entered on its card (along with such phrases as "Ready Soon" or "Published last Tuesday"). 59 It is only after one has accumulated all these dates—copyright date, deposit date, date of Publishers' Weekly listing, and advertising dates—that one can make an informed judgment about the actual time of the appearance of the volume; and it is likely that very little further shuffling of the cards will be necessary to place them in the most exact chronological order. The final task is simply to number the cards consecutively and enter the numbers on the alphabetical index sheets already prepared. Unless one is particularly fortunate, however, the process does not operate quite this smoothly, and one will usually end up with a number of problem cards—titles found in the publisher's catalogues or advertisements and nowhere else, or titles first encountered in the copyright record or in Publishers' Weekly but seemingly never announced by the publisher. In the first of these cases, one may suspect that the books were announced by the publisher but never actually issued; still, one cannot be sure, since the works may not have been copyrighted and may not have been sent to the Publishers' Weekly office for record. So one begins searching for evidence of their existence—in the Library of Congress Catalogue , American Catalogue , United States Catalog , or CBI . If the LC catalogue has the book with the desired imprint, the question is answered; if not, but one of the other three has it, one must be wary. Unlike the copyright record, entries in those catalogues are not proof of a book's existence. The H. W. Wilson Company in the early years made a careful attempt to examine every book listed (a more attainable goal then than later), but in some cases it had to rely on information requested from a publisher (though never simply from his catalogue); 60 the publisher could report a book as "almost ready" which never in fact appeared. For example, Thomas Seltzer's 1924 catalogue lists Babette Deutsch's Honey out of the Rock ; his 1925 does not. The copyright entry is for 4 September 1925 in the name of the Appleton company; the LC copy has the Appleton imprint, as have the copies in the New York Public and Yale—yet the United States Catalog for 1924 lists the book as Seltzer's. A similar difficulty arises when a publisher who is currently issuing a given author's works decides to reprint all his earlier works. In such a case the publisher may announce for publication many titles which he never gets around to issuing—yet it is difficult to tell just which ones appeared (in the absence of conclusive information in Publishers' Weekly or the copyright records), since libraries are more likely to have the original editions. So the problem of tracking down the publication dates of some of the Huebsch reprints of Veblen's work is a taxing one. In addition to checking the card catalogues in as many libraries as possible, one should turn to any other reference works that list large numbers of books—such as dealers' or auction catalogues, or a work like Book Review Digest . (It may be that one will want the dates of some early reviews on each card, anyway, as a further aid to an accurate chronology—in which case one should go to this work between steps two and three above, when the cards will be alphabetical in five-year groupings; they will emerge in one-year groupings, equally convenient for the ensuing work with the copyright catalogue.) The second possibility—that a certain title is found in Publishers' Weekly or the copyright record but not in the publisher's announcements—is less serious, for if it is in the copyright record, it definitely once existed, even if no large library seems to have it today. If the source of the title is only the Publishers' Weekly , one must be more cautious. Entries in the "Weekly Record" are generally made from the books themselves, but sometimes they are not (in these cases there is fortunately an indication that the book has not been seen). An illustration of the problem this situation can create involves Jean Parke's Psalms of the Heart Restored . Because the book was listed in Publishers' Weekly for 8 November 1919 as published by Scott &amp; Seltzer, I had assumed it to be the first book bearing the imprint of this short-lived partnership, though I did wonder why it was not listed in the Scott &amp; Seltzer catalogue. The book is not in the Library of Congress, but I came across it in a bookshop and discovered that it bears the imprint of Temple Scott alone. While Publishers' Weekly transcribes from title pages if a book is at hand, the listing does serve the purpose of telling book dealers where a book can be ordered, and a firm's new name may therefore be used when the old one still appears in the imprint. (A useful feature of the PW record is the "c." which indicates that a book is copyrighted; if one has missed it in his previous search of the copyright entries, he can return.) A similar confusion in imprints may occur when, instead of inserting a cancel title page with the British sheets, an American publisher simply pastes his own label over the original imprint, as Huebsch did with some of E. D. Morel's works. Even an actual joint imprint may be recorded in America only under the name of the American publisher—which emphasizes, all the more, the necessity of personally examining every book. A final disturbing point about this second category of discrepancies is that it is conducive to nightmares in which one catches vague glimpses of still further entries, for books unannounced by the publisher himself, in some of the more inaccessible reaches of a file of Publishers' Weekly . To compile a catalogue of an imprint, as this procedure illustrates, one must extract from the basic tools a category of information which they are not designed to yield up easily. The whole process, of course, has assumed that the publisher's own records are not available; but, even if they are, the same steps should be followed, both as a check on errors or omissions in them and as a source for information which they will usually not contain. The principal facts which only the publisher's files can supply are the dates of later printings (unless one can secure a late copy with a printing record on the verso of the title page) and the size of each printing. For the post-1870 period the papers of a great many publishers are still in their own offices. The appearance of the useful American Literary Manuscripts in 1960 revealed that at least Bobbs-Merrill, Longmans Green, McGraw-Hill, Norton, Prentice-Hall, and Viking have important holdings for the study of relations between literary authors and their publishers, but not all firms are desirous of being turned into research libraries (or even of having their papers housed in one), as the recent dispersal of material by Appleton-Century-Crofts demonstrates. If the records of some of the smaller firms of this period have perished through neglect, there is an increasing desire on the part of the libraries, vying in the manuscripts race, to acquire what remaining documents there are, while it is still possible. The Bentley Papers at Illinois, though not of an American house, are a case in point, as are the Henry Holt Papers at Princeton. 61 The New York Public Library has a number of important manuscript collections for this period, especially of the Century Company (1880-1914), Knopf (since 1930), Crowell-Collier (since 1935), the publishers of many New York newspapers, and the National Association of Book Publishers; the Library of Congress has some Harper material, both Huntington and Houghton some Thomas B. Mosher, the American Antiquarian Society some Copeland &amp; Day and some Lee &amp; Shepard, and Columbia some Putnam. One may also, most of the time, track down some important manuscript material about a publishing firm by looking into the papers of its leading authors (which are more likely to be housed adequately). Thus the Sherwood Anderson Papers at the Newberry Library (like the Colonel House Papers at Yale) contain material relating to B. W. Huebsch, including a 1924 letter of Huebsch's when Anderson was considering moving to Liveright, that seems to me one of the significant documents in twentieth-century literary publishing. As with the other categories of materials, there are far more (and far more useful) volumes of reminiscences for this period than for any previous one. The huge, basic books are Joseph Henry Harper's The House of Harper (1912) and I Remember (1934), George Haven Putnam's Memories of a Publisher (1915), George Palmer Putnam : A Memoir (1912), and Authors and Publishers (1897), George P. Putnam's Wide Margins (1942), George H. Doran's Chronicles of Barabbas (1935), 62 Henry Holt's Garrulities of an Octogenarian Editor (1923), and Walter Hines Page's A Publisher's Confession (1905) and Life and Letters (1925). Publishers of magazines have frequently furnished some of the best views of the publishing world, as L. Frank Tooker in The Joys and Tribulations of an Editor (1924), S. S. McClure in My Autobiography (1914), John Adams Thayer in Astir : A Publisher's Life Story (1910), and Edward Bok in The Americanization of Edward Bok (1920). But there are many other important firsthand accounts, among which the most revealing are Ferris Greenslet's Under the Bridge (1943), William W. Ellsworth's A Golden Age of Authors (1919), George Terry Dunlap's The Fleeting Years (1937), Robert Barrie's My Log (1917), John Barnes Pratt's Personal Recollections (1942), Theodore Bliss' Publisher and Bookseller (1941), Ralph Fletcher Seymour's Some Went This Way (1945), Alfred Harcourt's Some Experiences (1951), E. Haldeman-Julius' The First Hundred Million (1928), Donald Friede's The Glittering Angel (1948), and Edward Uhlan's The Rogue of Publisher's Row (1956). Frederick A. Stokes, B. W. Huebsch, and Alfred Harcourt have delivered reminiscent lectures in the Bowker series, 63 and other publishers have at times written articles or sketches in a nostalgic vein. 64 At least two publishers, Alfred Knopf and B. W. Huebsch, have responded to interviews for the Oral History Research Office at Columbia, under Louis M. Starr, and have in this way provided voluminous material not otherwise available. 65 One other related category consists of the commemorative volumes issued by various firms to celebrate their anniversaries. Some of these are quite distinguished, like the 1899 and the 1905-06 Houghton Mifflin volumes, Appleton-Century-Crofts' Fruit Among the Leaves (1950), and Knopf's Borzoi 1920 and Borzoi 1925 , while others are nothing more than pamphlets presenting a brief sketch of a firm's history; but whether they represent staff hackwork or considerable research by a signed author (such as Roger Burlingame's histories of Scribner's and McGraw-Hill, Grant Overton's of Appleton, Charles Morgan's of Macmillan, or Quentin Reynolds' of Street &amp; Smith), 66 there is an enormous array of them, 67 and they often can provide a starting point for further work. At any rate, the problem for the post-1870 period is evaluating so much evidence and cutting through so many documents, in order to build up, slowly and carefully, a history of each firm and its influence book by book. If the emphasis in this discussion has been on publishing historiography as the construction of documented publishers' catalogues, I have not meant to imply that there are no other important areas of investigation. Mention of publishers' reminiscences and of correspondence with authors suggests in itself some of the relations between the history of publishing and the cultural, political, and economic conditions prevailing at any particular time. Moreover, a thorough picture of publishing cannot fail to notice publishers of periodicals as well as of books. Publishers and editors of avant-garde magazines, in Greenwich Village, say, in the 1910's, offered important outlets for writers, existing side by side with experimental publishers of books and occupying an important place in the publishing scene; similarly, the full story of American publishing will deal with the pioneer newspaper publishers and editors of each locality, who often served a large group of people as its sole publisher and symbol of the publishing world. Some book publishers, like Fields or Harper or Huebsch, established important periodicals, but other magazines of great significance for literary and intellectual history, like the Port Folio or McClure's or the Little Review , are important in their own right as forces in publishing and deserve to have their stories told as part of publishing history. 68 As for newspapers, certainly there is no dearth of memoirs by pioneering editors, waiting to be utilized and the data incorporated into larger patterns of frontier publishing. 69 Another area which constitutes a whole field in itself, but with which the student of literary publishing should be familiar, is that of bibliopoly—for the autobiographies of book dealers, as well as their catalogues and those of auction houses, often prove to be convenient storehouses of information. 70 The emphasis here, as I say, has been on the detailed history of individual imprints. It should be a truism, but apparently is not, that a knowledge of the lists of individual publishers underlies all broader investigations into publishing history. Generalizations about the out-put of any publisher, about the characteristics of publishers in any period, or about the trends in American publishing from one period to another, must begin there. When George Parker Winship, forty years ago, was surveying the scholarship of American printing history, he felt obliged to defend the calling of bibliography: Much has already been published which the future historian of American printing will find useful. Enough for a few foot-notes, and for one important section, as well as for some minor paragraphs, is in shape to be used without further research. For the most part, however, what is already available consists of data through which the investigator must search and sift in order to gather the significant, undigested facts. Bibliography has served a long apprenticeship as the scullery-maid to the established subjects of scholarly pursuit, condemned to the patient sweeping together of scattered fragments into storage piles, wherein some one with imagination as well as knowledge might find the odds and ends which could be woven into an intelligible narrative. It is therefore natural that those who began the exploration of bibliography's own special field should find it particularly difficult to overcome the traditions of the subject. 71 Bibliography has come a long way since then, and it is surely no longer necessary to shun the "sweeping together of scattered fragments" simply in order to demonstrate that bibliography's "own special field" consists of more than that. The fragments must in any case be swept before the "intelligible narrative" can come, and we are now in the fortunate position of being able to do the sweeping without being demoted to scullery-maids. It may even turn out that the man who has no compulsion to hide his broom will be the very man who can use it with imagination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 English Institute Essays 1949 (1950), pp. 73-91. Charles Fenton has more recently expressed a similar point of view in "The Lost Years of Twentieth-Century American Literature," SAQ , LIX (1960), 332-338; he says that English departments should offer more courses which provide opportunities for "an unhurried investigation of the history of American publishing houses, the role of editors and literary agents, and the nature of literary art in a democracy" (p. 338). It has also been nearly twenty-five years since Rollo G. Silver, in "Problems in Nineteenth-Century Bibliography," PBSA , XXXV (1941), 35-47, pointed out the need for lists of imprints of every publishing firm (p. 45). 2 Examples are J. Albert Robbins, "Fees Paid to Authors by Certain American Periodicals," SB , II (1949-50), 95-104; B. W. Korn, "Benjamin Levy: New Orleans Printer and Publisher," PBSA , LIV (1960), 221-264; William Charvat, "Melville and the Common Reader," SB , XII (1958), 41-57.— It should be emphasized, at the outset, that the footnotes in the present essay do not attempt to provide an exhaustive checklist of relevant material, a task impossible in many times the space; rather, they aim at presenting a representative sampling of the various approaches which have been used in research on American publishing and of the various types of materials available. 3 Blagden, The Stationers' Company (1960); Blunden, Keats's Publisher (1936); Gettmann, A Victorian Publisher: A Study of the Bentley Papers (1960); Mumby, Publishing and Bookselling (1930; rev. 1954). The American titles will be referred to below. Other well-known British studies are Ralph Straus, The Unspeakable Curll (1927); Dorothy Blakey, The Minerva Press (1939); E. V. Lucas, Charles Lamb and the Lloyds (1898); Falconer Madan, Oxford Books (1895-1931); Stanley Morison, John Bell (1930); F. A. Mumby, The House of Routledge (1934); Marjorie Plant, The English Book Trade (1939). Three other famous British books, useful for American studies as well, are Stanley Unwin's The Truth About Publishing (1926), Michael Joseph's The Commercial Side of Literature (1925), and Grant Richards' Author Hunting (1934). 4 The most inclusive is Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt, with Lawrence C. Wroth and Rollo G. Silver, The Book in America (rev. 1951). Earlier attempts to cover this ground were made by Isaiah Thomas himself in his History of Printing in America (2nd ed., 1874), J. C. Oswald in Printing in the Americas (1937), and Douglas C. McMurtrie in what would have been the most comprehensive of all, A History of Printing in the United States (but only volume II, on the middle Atlantic and southern states, was published, in 1936). The principal short survey is E. L. Bradsher, "Book Publishers and Publishing," in Cambridge History of American Literature , III (1921), 533-553; and a useful assemblage of material is Henry W. Boynton's Annals of American Bookselling 1638-1850 (1932). Though the influence of binding on sales and types of literature produced has not been sufficiently explored, an invaluable work is Bookbinding in America (1941), by Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt, Hannah D. French, and Joseph W. Rogers. 5 Work on Franklin begins with the pioneer effort of that industrious and notable American bibliographer, Charles R. Hildeburn, in A Century of Printing: The Issues of the Press of Pennsylvania 1685-1784 (2 vols., 1885-86); it continues with L. S. Livingston's Franklin and His Press at Passy (1914), J. C. Oswald's Benjamin Franklin, Printer (1917), William J. Campbell's Short-title Checklist of Franklin Imprints (1918), and the work of Randolph G. Adams; and it is now being carried on by C. William Miller, in such articles as "Franklin's Type: Its Study Past and Present," Proc. Am. Philos. Soc. , XC (1955), 418-432, and "Benjamin Franklin's Philadelphia Type," SB , XI (1958), 179-206. A recent Drexel Institute Master's thesis, by C. P. Crowers, took up the "History of the Franklin Printing Company, Philadelphia, 1728-1954" (1954). The Stephen Daye press has been treated most frequently in discussions of the Bay Psalm Book and Eilot's Indian Bible—see especially George Parker Winship, The Cambridge Press 1638-1692 (1945); but its history and list of publications are given in R. F. Roden, The Cambridge Press 1638-1692 (1905), George E. Littlefield, The Early Massachusetts Press 1638-1711 (1907), and Lawrence G. Starkey's 1949 Virginia dissertation, "A Descriptive and Analytical Bibliography of the Cambridge Press" (also SB , II, 79-93; III, 267-270). The Grolier Club in 1893 issued a Catalogue of the William Bradford press (see also H. L. Bullen's account of the Bradfords in the Americana Collector in 1926 and J. A. Gallagher's 1930 study). Lawrence Wroth has told the story of William Parks (1926) and has listed the issues of his press. 6 For example, Dorothy L. Hawkins, "James Adams, the First Printer of Delaware," PBSA , XXVIII (1934), 28-63; Bradford F. Swan, "The First Printing in Providence [William Goddard]," in Essays Honoring Lawrence C. Wroth (1951), pp. 365-369;—or, later, Lota Spell, "Samuel Bangs: The First Printer in Texas," Southwest Historical Quarterly , XXXV (1932), 267-278. 7 Wroth, The Colonial Printer (rev. 1938) and Part I of Lehmann-Haupt (1951), pp. 3-59 (as well as works like Abel Buell of Connecticut [1926]); McMurtrie, A History of Printing in the United States (1936); Silver, many articles such as "Financing the Publication of Early New England Sermons," SB , XI (1957), 163-178, and "Publishing in Boston 1726-1757: The Accounts of Daniel Henchman," Proc. Am. Antiq. Soc ., LXVI (1956), 17-36, and (with Wroth) the second part of Lehmann-Haupt (pp. 63-136). 8 Such as John T. Winterich's Early American Books and Printing (1935), Samuel A. Green's Remarks on the Early History of Printing in New England (1897), Charles R. Hildeburn's Sketches of Printers and Printing in Colonial New York (1895). 9 The imprint records are discussed below in connection with a later period, but of course those listing the earliest imprints for all the Atlantic coast states and for Louisiana and Kentucky do concern the pre-1790 period. 10 Lists of the issues of a few other presses have appeared; examples are Carl J. Weber, "Portland Printer [Benjamin Titcomb, Jr.]," in In Tribute to Fred Anthoensen (1952), pp. 3-16; and R. W. G. Vail, "A Patriotic Pair of Peripatetic Printers: The Up-State Imprints of John Holt and Samuel Loudon 1776-83," in Essays Honoring Lawrence C. Wroth (1951), pp. 391-422. And some studies of these printers mentioned have appeared—as Rollo G. Silver, "Benjamin Edes, Trumpter of Sedition," PBSA , XLVII (1953), 248-268. 11 Shipton, Isaiah Thomas (1948); Bradsher, Mathew Carey, Editor, Author and Publisher: A Study in American Literary Development (1912); Wroth, Parson Weems (1911); Kaser, Messrs. Carey &amp; Lea of Philadelphia (1957) and The Cost Book of Carey &amp; Lea 1825-1838 (1963). In addition, see E. S. Bradley, Henry Charles Lea (1931). Thomas has also been treated by Annie Russell Marble, From 'Prentice to Patron (1935), and Charles L. Nichols, Isaiah Thomas (1912), which contains a checklist of imprints, pp. 37-144. Other material about Carey appears in K. W. Rowe, Mathew Carey (1933), Rollo G. Silver, "Matthew Carey's Proofreaders," SB , XVII (1964), 123-133, and David Randall, "Waverley in America," Colophon , n.s. I (1935), 39-55; and Chester T. Hallenbeck draws largely on Carey to illustrate "Book-Trade Publicity Before 1800," PBSA , XXXII (1938), 47-56. E. E. F. Skeel edited the bibliography and letters of Weems (3 vols., 1929). 12 Charvat, Literary Publishing in America 1790-1850 (1959); Sheehan, This Was Publishing (1952); Stern, Imprints on History (1956). Miss Stern has also written on the colorful wife of Frank Leslie in Purple Passage (1953). Studies of lesser publishers of this period are Luke M.

A further important source of such information is the official Census Report on manufactures for various years; see also John G. Glover and William B. Cornell (eds.), The Development of American Industries (3rd ed., 1951). 33 I should perhaps point out that I am currently preparing studies and catalogues of the firms mentioned in these two sentences. 34 Willard O. Waters, "American Imprints, 1648-1797, in the Huntington Library, Supplementing Evans' 'American Bibliography,'" Huntington Library Bulletin , no. 3 (1933), 1-95. A more recent supplementary list is the one by Lewis M. Stark and Maud D. Cole (NYPL, 1960); Roger P. Bristol is preparing the comprehensive list of such additions. 35 The explanation of the changes in scope is made in the last volume, XXIX (1936), ix-xi. Another similar work is the Elihu Dwight Church Catalogue , edited by G. W. Cole (5 vols., 1907). 36 The story of the evolution of these journals is told in LeRoy Harold Linder, The Rise of Current Complete National Bibliography (1959), pp. 129-144; Linder takes up all the attempts at American national bibliography, pp. 95-101, 127-155, 173-186, 211-217. The standard historical survey of this area is Adolph Growoll, Book Trade Bibliography in the United States in the Nineteenth Century (1898; reprinted 1939); an extensive list of national bibliographies appears on pp. xxiv-xxxvii—but see also the tabular analysis in Linder, pp. 251-254. Cf. two H. W. Wilson publications, Cumulative Bibliography: A Brief History (1912) and A Quarter Century of Cumulative Bibliography (1923). 37 Our present, more efficient, replacements for the United States Catalog are Books in Print (1948- ) and Subject Guide to Books in Print (1957- ), which are actually indexes to the annual collection of publishers' catalogues, the Publishers' Trade List Annual . Recently a publication resembling the old American Catalogue , in that it consists of cumulations of the weekly record in Publishers' Weekly , has been started, the American Book Publishing Record (1960- ). 38 This story has been fully told by Joseph W. Rogers in U. S. National Bibliography and the Copyright Law: An Historical Study (1960). A 28-page pamphlet, covering in summary form some of the same ground, was issued by the Copyright Office: Elizabeth K. Dunne and Joseph W. Rogers, The Catalogue of Copyright Entries (1960). Standard histories of copyright developments are Thorvald Solberg's Copyright in Congress 1789-1904 (1905) and R. R. Bowker's Copyright: Its History and Its Law (1912). 39 For the later part of the century there does exist a published record in one area, drama: Dramatic Compositions Copyrighted in the United States 1870-1916 (2 vols., 1916, 1918), with its 56,066 entries. 40 Issued in four parts, of which Part 1, "Books," concerns us here. But Part 1 is divided into two groups (gathered into separate annual volumes, with separate indexes), and the literary scholar should not fail to check both groups: while Group 1, covering published volumes, will be of principal help, Group 2 does contain pamphlets and plays, among other lesser works. (This arrangement changes slightly with the third series in 1947.) 41 For a useful survey of these copyright record books and an inventory of the ones surviving in the Copyright Office (315 original registers plus 300 more volumes of duplicate clerks' records, totalling about 150,000 entries), see Martin A. Roberts, "Records in the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress Deposited by the United States District Courts, 1790-1870," PBSA , XXXI (1937), 81-101. Though these records are highly important, few of them have been published. Among those few are Virginia Copyright Entries 1790-1844 , ed. J. H. Whitty (1911); Norfolk Copyright Entries 1837, 1851-3, 1856-7, 1858-9, 1864, 1866-71 , ed. Barbara Harris and J. C. Wyllie (1947); Douglas C. McMurtrie, "Early Illinois Copyright Entries [1821-50]," Chicago Historical Society Bulletin , II (1936-37), 50-61, 92-101; and William L. Jenks, "Michigan Copyrights [1824-29, 1837-70]," Michigan History Magazine , XI (1927), 110-143, 271-287, 445-458, 630-652; XII (1928), 108-124, 584-589, 740-743; XIII (1929), 121-126, 555-559; XIV (1930), 150-155, 311-313. See also Ruth Leonard, "A Bibliographical Evaluation of the Copyright Records for the United States District Court of Massachusetts, 1800-1809," Columbia Master's thesis (1944). Evans used some of this copyright information for the last decade of his coverage: see, for example, entries 33849, 33865, 34377, drawing on the records of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York. Further discussion of those years is in F. R. Goff, "The First Decade of the Federal Act for Copyright," in Essays Honoring Lawrence C. Wroth (1951), pp. 101-128. 42 Between 1898 and 1901 the index is thorough but not published—it exists on cards in the Copyright Office (though a weekly index of proprietors did appear); from 1898 on, however, the Catalogue contains all the essential information about each entry that is available in the Office records and is thus an effective instrument for search, even though not indexed in its published form until 1901 (quarterly before 1906, annually after). 43 In fact, the last nine volumes of the second series, 1938-46, are unsatisfactory when compared with the preceding three decades. The form of entry was first abbreviated (by omitting certain facts, like pagination, to be found on the LC cards) in 1938; beginning with 1939 the index contained only authors (making it less useful for work in publishing history); from 1940 on, only the copyright date was given in the entry (not the deposit or affidavit dates); and in 1946 no index numbers were used, though an attempt was made to use LC cards again and give more information. The third series, in expanded format, began in 1947, with entries alphabetical by author (in two alphabets per year) and a title (but no publisher) index; the more recent volumes, however, do incorporate cross-references from the copyright proprietors (including publishers) into the main listing. 44 The significance of these items is not explained clearly in the Catalogue itself; the information in this paragraph is from a letter to me from Mr. Richard S. MacCarteney, Chief of the Reference Division of the Copyright Office, 31 July 1963. An example of the form these items take in the Catalogue is as follows: "© Dec. 13, 1919; 2 c. Dec. 29, 1919; aff. Jan. 5, 1920; A 559288; Stratford co. (20-364)." 45 Mr. MacCarteney points out that this may not be true for 1908 and 1909, since he says the statement about deposit as well as registration was omitted from those two catalogues. 46 The only other information provided is that for ad interim copyrights, when an American publisher wishes to declare his intention to publish in America a work first published abroad (it includes the date of his declaration as well as the date of original publication); there will be a later entry of the usual kind, if he actually does publish it. 47 If one needs to date an English edition more precisely than by month, one can then search the appropriate month of the Publishers' Circular to get a rough idea of the part of the month (with all the same qualifications expressed for Publishers' Weekly below). 48 See, for example, the Boston Chronicle , I (2, 16 May 1768), 191-192, 214-215. Mein has been discussed by J. E. Alden in PBSA , XXXVI (1942), 199-214. 49 Hugh Gaine's Journals were edited by Paul Leicester Ford in 1902; Franklin's Autobiography has, of course, appeared in many editions, and his Account Books were published by G. C. Eddy in 1928-29. Letters relating to Franklin and David Hall from William Strahan have been published in the Pennsylvania Magaine of History , X (1886), 86-99, 217-232, 322-333, 461-473; XI (1887), 98-111, 223-234, 346-357, 482-490; XII (1888), 116-122, 240-251; LX (1936), 455-489. 50 Papers of prominent editors, like the Griswold Papers in the Boston Public and the Duyckinck Papers in the New York Public, will also yield important publishing material, as will, frequently, the papers of individual authors. The Adolph Growoll Collection in the office of Publishers' Weekly provides further information, particularly in the form of clippings. 51 See G. T. Tanselle, "Poe and Vandenhoff Once More," AN&amp;Q , I (1963), 101-102; cf. T. O. Mabbott, "The First Book Publication of Poe's 'Raven'," BNYPL , XLVII (1943), 581-584. This use of reviews is well known. Since it was the policy of most reviewers to print large extracts from the books reviewed, it is possible that the technique of using extracts to date revised versions, described for eighteenth-century work by William B. Todd in SB , IV (1951-52), 41-55, will be helpful here, too. 52 A good discussion of it is in Sidney P. Moss, Poe's Literary Battles (1963), pp. 337. See also, especially, Walter L. Pforzheimer, "Copyright and Scholarship," English Institute Annual 1940 (1941), pp. 164-199; and Andrew J. Eaton, "The American Movement for International Copyright: 1837-1860," Library Quarterly , XV (1945), 95-122. One of the main effects of the situation was, of course, the pirating of British works—hence the relevance of Lawrence H. Houtchens, "Charles Dickens and International Copyright," AL , XIII (1941), 18-28. 53 These include directories for New York (1633-1820) by G. L. McKay (1942), Boston (1800-25) by Rollo G. Silver (1949), Philadelphia (to 1820) by H. G. and M. O. Brown (1950), Baltimore (1800-25) by Rollo G. Silver (1953), Rhode Island (to 1865) by H. G. and M. O. Brown (1958), and St. Louis (to 1850) by David Kaser (1961). A related NYPL publication is Benjamin Lewis' A Register of Editors, Printers, and Publishers of American Magazines 1741-1810 (1957). Thomas Galvin prepared a thesis at Simmons College in 1956 on the Boston book trade, 1760-1790, G. A. Gaskill did one for 1825-1835, and R. W. Flint for 1835-1845. 54 A convenient account of this undertaking is McMurtrie's "The Bibliography of American Imprints," Publishers' Weekly , CXLIV (20 November 1943), 1939-44, which includes a complete list of these imprint inventories (they are also listed in Winchell's Guide to Reference Books , entry A163). McMurtrie's writings have themselves been listed to 1942 by Charles F. Heartman, McMurtrie Imprints (1942). See also The Douglas C. McMurtrie Manuscripts Collection at the Michigan State University : Some Possibilities for Research and Publication (1963). 55 These were done, respectively, by R. C. Ellison (1946); Robert Greenwood (1961); R. W. Noyes (1930); J. T. Wheeler (1938), A. R. Minick (1949), and R. P. Bristol (1953) —all for Maryland; Robert J. Turnbull (1956); Eleanor D. Mitchell (1953); Thomas W. Streeter (1955-60); E. F. Cooley (1937) and Marcus A. McCorison (1963); Delf Norona (1958). 56 A list of these theses, as of June 1953, appears in the Secretary's News Sheet (No. 28, p. 2) of the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia. One of the theses is itself a useful record of imprint lists: C. G. LaHood, Jr., "A Survey of Regional Bibliographies and Checklists of Early American Imprints" (1956). See also Thomas W. Streeter, "Notes on North American Regional Bibliographies," PBSA , XXXVI (1942), 171-186. Some imprint lists are also being issued by the University of Rochester Press in the ACRL Microcard Series, especially for Virginia towns; and a series of lists, especially for Illinois (to 1871), were done as theses at the University of Illinois in the 1930's. Such lists also occur in periodicals, as Constance H. Humphrey, "Check-List of New Jersey Imprints to the End of the Revolution," PBSA , XXIV (1930), 43-149. 57 In the first half of 1901 a still different system was tried, in which each monthly list was a cumulative listing of all previous months that year. The inconsistency in the cumulations during these years may be simply due to individual libraries' policies about binding, since these cumulations seem frequently to be absent in April, July, and October, the very months when one would expect quarterly, instead of monthly, cumulations. (One is thus led to suspect that the cumulations were actually prepared but sometimes omitted in binding so as not to over-extend the volume—yet there seem to be no pages missing.) Rose Weinberg, Librarian of Publishers' Weekly , writes to me (18 October 1963) that, to her knowledge, the quarterly cumulation was never issued as a separate, and she can supply no further information about the cumulation policy at that time. 58 James B. Meriwether, in "The English Editions of James Gould Cozzens," SB , XV (1962), 216-217, shows that he is aware of this problem when he points out that publishers may change publication dates after sending the original one (with an advance copy) to the Copyright Office and when he says that he has checked "the generally reliable advertised dates in Publishers' Weekly ." What he leaves unsaid, however, is that advertisements (and the listing in the "Weekly Record") depend on the whim of the publisher just as much as the copyright records and that he happened to be dealing with a publisher whose advertisements were "generally reliable." 59 The general index, on the other hand, may not yield information of the kind to be included on the cards, but it will certainly lead one to notes about the organization, location, and finances of the firm not usually available elsewhere, as well as to extensive information about the general state of publishing. An example of the way in which material exclusively from Publishers' Weekly can be rearranged into narrative history is the 1949 Windsor Lectures at Illinois: John T. Winterich, Three Lantern Slides (1949). 60 This information was supplied to me by Mr. Edwin B. Colburn, Chief of Indexing Services at the H. W. Wilson Co., in a letter of 23 August 1963. 61 See Princeton University Library Chronicle , XIII (1952), 164-168. A description of the Holt archives, as well as those of Scribner's, Harper's, and Dodd, Mead, is given by Donald Sheehan in This Was Publishing (1952), pp. 273-275. Occasionally, part of a firm's files will get published, like the letters of Scribner's famous editor, Maxwell Perkins, in Editor to Author (1950), or Sinclair Lewis' letters to Harcourt, Brace, in From Main Street to Stockholm (1952). Charles A. Madison, of Holt, is preparing a book to be entitled The Owl Among the Colophons ; for his account of the relations between Holt and William James, see Saturday Review , 16 November 1963, pp. 24-25. 62 See also Grant Overton's When Winter Comes to Main Street (1922) and Publishers' Weekly , CII (30 September 1922), 1212. 63 Stokes, "A Publisher's Random Notes," and Harcourt, "Publishing Since 1900," in Bowker Lectures on Book Publishing (1957), pp. 3-27, 28-41; Huebsch, Busman's Holiday (1959). 64 Alfred Knopf, "On Making a Few Books," New Colophon , II (1949), 120-134; Alfred A. Knopf at 60 (1952), which includes an essay by B. W. Huebsch. 65 See Starr's "History, Warm," in the Fall 1962 Columbia University Forum and the general index to the collection. The Office also maintains a card index of names alluded to in all the interviews. 66 Burlingame, Of Making Many Books (1946) and Endless Frontiers (1959); Overton, Portrait of a Publisher (1925); Morgan, The House of Macmillan (1944); Reynolds, The Fiction Factory (1955). 67 Only a few can be mentioned, to indicate the range of these volumes: Book Publishing at 34 Beacon Street and One Hundred and Twenty Five Years of Publishing (Little, Brown, 1951, 1962); The Harper Centennial (1917); Thomas Young Crowell : A Biographical Sketch (1926); The Country Life Press (Doubleday, 1919); Seventy-Five Years, or the Joys and Sorrows of Publishing and Selling Books at Dutton's (1927); The House of Stokes (1926); One Hundred and Fifty Years of Publishing (Lea &amp; Febiger, 1935); The First One Hundred and Fifty Years (Wiley, 1957); A Century of Book Publishing (Van Nostrand, 1948); The Hoosier House (Bobbs-Merrill, 1923); Two Score Years and Five : Quality and The Story of the Century Company (1915, 1923); The House of Appleton-Century (1936); One Hundred Years of Publishing (William Wood &amp; Co., 1904); Seventy-Five Years of Book Publishing (Barnes, 1913). 68 A number of individual magazines have, of course, been studied, and work is now going forward on histories of "little" magazines—witness the publication, in 1963 alone, of books on the Freeman (by Susan J. Turner; originally written 1956), Reedy's Mirror (by Max Putzel), and the Dial (by William Wasserstrom). The standard history is Frank Luther Mott, A History of American Magazines (1938-57); and see James P. Wood, Magazines in the United States (2nd ed., 1956), and Frederick J. Hoffman et al., The Little Magazine (1946). 69 An enormous amount of work has been done in the history of American journalism. There are Frank Luther Mott's standard work, American Journalism (rev., 1950) and detailed histories of individual newspapers, such as Harry W. Baehr on the Tribune (1936), Frank M. O'Brien on the Sun (1918), Joseph E. Chamberlin on the Boston Transcript (1930), Richard Hooker on the Springfield Republican (1923), Philip Kinsley on the Chicago Tribune (1943-45), and Elmer Davis on the New York Times (1921). But there are hundreds of pioneer editors who have written autobiographies and who offer opportunities for significant research into publishing history—see the memoirs of these men, for example (by area and date of the memoir): Midwest—Ebenezer S. Thomas (1840), Eber Howe (n.d.), Jefferson J. Polk (1867), Marcus M. Pomeroy (1890), Hans Mattson (1891), Samuel A. Lane (1892), Edwin C. Manning (1911), Frank M. Mills (1911, 1924), John West Goodwin (n.d.), Tacitus Hussey (1919), William Dyer (1919), Frederick W. Allsopp (1922), Young Ewing Allison (1935), Lucien M. Harris (1937), Ira A. Nichols (1938), Arthur J. Russell (1943), A. B. Wood (1945); Far West—Abigail Duniway (1914), Jaret B. Graham (1915), Carlyle C. Davis (1916), James J. Ayers (1922), Fremont Older (1926, 1931), George F. Weeks (1928), Charles H. Leckenby (1945); East—Nelson Dingley (1874), Asa McFarland (1880), George W. Childs (1890), Marcus M. Pomeroy (1890), Adam C. Sandford (1909), Albert S. Pease (1915), George W. Oakes (1933). 70 One of the best is Charles E. Goodspeed, Yankee Bookseller (1937); see also Madge Jenison, Sunwise Turn (1923), Walter T. Spencer, Forty Years in My Bookshop (1923), D. L. Mann, A Century of Bookselling (1928), and William Brotherhead, Forty Years Among the Old Booksellers of Philadelphia (1891). For earlier periods booksellers and publishers are often identical, and book-trade directories or works like Worthington C. Ford's The Boston Book Market 1679-1700 (1917) offer useful guides. Book dealers' catalogues in all periods can be important, from John West's list of 1797 or the Americana catalogues of Robert Clarke of Cincinnati in the 1880's to the recent catalogues of Philip C. Duschnes which provide complete lists, for example, of the Limited Editions Club (No. 155) or the Gregynog Press (No. 161); see Archer Taylor, Book Catalogues : Their Varieties and Uses (1957). There are many famous catalogues in this field, among them Henry Stevens' A Century of American Printing 1701 to 1800 (1916) and (an exhibit catalogue) A. S. W. Rosenbach's One Hundred and Fifty Years of Printing in English America 1640-1790 (1940). Bookshops provide other aids, like the Month at Goodspeed's , which sometimes has valuable articles. 71 "The Literature of the History of Printing in the United States: A Survey," Library , 4th ser., III (1922-23), 288-289.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Chaucerian Proverbs by George B. Pace</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The so-called Proverbs of Chaucer constitute a trouble-some puzzle to anyone interested in the totality of Chaucer's work, for they may well be authentic but are unlike any of Chaucer's unquestioned writings. Robinson, the latest editor (1957), places the Proverbs in a group of five "doubtful" poems which he feels cannot be proved not to be by Chaucer and which he accordingly prints. 1 But Robinson's opinion is not the only one. For example, the Brown-Robbins Index labels the Proverbs "pseudo Chaucerian"; Brusendorff asserts that they are genuine beyond "serious doubt"; the Globe Chaucer includes the Proverbs among the undisputed writings; and Skeat is of two minds, finding the Proverbs authentic in his Chaucer Canon but doubting their authorship in the Oxford Chaucer. 2 Only one thing seems really certain about the Proverbs : either they are by Chaucer or they are not. The present paper offers a detailed textual analysis of the Proverbs , partly because no such study seems to exist but also because this fundamental aspect, the textual, has a bearing upon the question of authenticity. Specifically, the paper reclassifies the textual authorities in the light of a previously ignored copy of the Proverbs , gives the text which results from the reclassification, and explores the matter of authenticity as it is modified both by the reclassification and by the new text. The paper does not settle the authorship of the Proverbs , but it does, I believe, alter the grounds upon which any opinion may be based.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Robinson classifies the three texts he considers as follows: 3 I take this classification to be the same as Heath's in the Globe Chaucer: 4 Neither of these classifications considers a fourth text: S Stowe's edition (1561). 5 S is the first printed copy of the Proverbs . Although not a MS., S seems to have the authority of a MS.; that is, its readings do not suggest that it is copied from any of the extant MSS. I include it among the authorities for the text of the poem as representing a lost MS. 6 The shortness of the Proverbs and the small number of authorities permits giving the text of the MSS in full, arranged comparatively: 7 A Prouerbe F Proverbe of Chaucer H Prouerbe of Chaucers S A prouerbe agaynst couitise and negligence 1 A What shal þees cloþes þus many fold F What shul these clothes / thus manyfolde H What shulde these clothes thus manyfolde S What shal these clothes thus manifolde 2 A Loo þis hoote / somers day F Loo / this hoote somers day H lo this hote somers day (written as part of l. 1) S Lo this hote somers daye 3 A Affter heet / komeþe cold F After grete hete / cometh colde H After greet hete cometh colde S After grete heate cometh colde 4 A No man cast his pilchche away / F No man caste / his pilch away H no man kaste his pilche away (written as part of l. 2) S No man caste his pilche away 5 A Of þis worlde / þe wyde compas / F Of al this worlde / the large compace H Off alle this worlde the large compas / S Of al this world the large compasse 6 A Hit wol not / in myn armes tweyne / F Yt wil not / in my Armes tweyne H it will not in my armes tweyne (written as part of l. 3) S It will not in myne armes tweine 7 A Who so mychel wol embrace / F Whoo so mochel wol / embrace H Who mekel wille enbrace S Who so mokel wol embrace 8 A Lytel þer of he shal distreyne / F litel therof he shal distreyne H litel therof he shal distreyne (written as part of l. 4) S Litell cher of he shall distreine (followed by Explicit ) The differences between these texts are expressed by the table below, which gives every variant reading. Readings found in only one text (unique readings) are italicized. A F H S Prouerbe Proverbe of Prouerbe of A prouerbe agaynst Chaucer Chaucers couitise and negligence 1 shal shul shulde shal 3 heet grete hete grete hete grete heate 5 þis al this alle this al this wyde large large large 6 wol wil wil will myn armes my Armes my armes myne armes 7 Who so Whoo so Who Who so mychel mochel mekel mokel wol wol wille wol 8 þer ther ther cher I shall comment on certain of the variants: Shal , shul , shulde , line 1; wol , wil , line 6. These are all possible Chaucerian forms (cf. S. Moore, Historical Outlines of English Sounds and Inflections , rev. by A. H. Marckwardt, 1951, pp. 57-58). Mychel , mochel , mekel , mokel , line 7. Although these are italicized above as unique variants, they can offer little evidence as to the relationship of the MSS; all are essentially forms of the same word (cf. the treatment in the OED , s. v. Mickle ). However, two of the variants, mekel and mokel , have textual significance of another kind: they are dialectically inappropriate for Chaucer (the k , from ON mikill , being characteristic of the north and north midlands; cf. the OED , ibid.; Robinson, one may remark, includes neither mekel nor mokel in his Glossary). As a Chaucerian form, mokel is especially suspect. The OED entry, a lengthy one, contains only one citation in which mokel occurs. Ther , cher , line 8. The second variant, which occurs in the printed text S, may be only a compositor's error. However, the misreading of t as c is distinctly characteristic of MSS; cf. C. Johnson and H. Jenkinson, English Court Hand, A. D. 1066 to 1500 , I, xxxviii: " c and t. These are constantly written one for the other." Below, cher is regarded as a MS. variant, since there is no positive evidence that it is not. The variation is substantive if cher is accepted at face value: "He who attempts too much will get little cheer [ chere ]." The remaining variants do not appear to need separate comment. In classifying the texts I make the following assumptions: that the texts are all ultimately descended from the same archetype; that readings found in only one text (unique readings) were not in the archetype; that shared errors indicate close relationship; that the simplest tree which will explain the distribution of the variants is to be preferred. This is not the place to elaborate upon these assumptions, which are usual operational assumptions of textual criticism. 8 When applied to the variants in the table they produce the following analysis: 1. The first assumption, that the texts are all from the same archetype, is borne out by the variants in that there is nothing to suggest a problem of states or versions. 2. The second assumption, that none of the unique readings were in the archetype, prevents any of the extant texts from being regarded as the archetype, as they all contain unique readings (see italicized variants). This assumption also says, in effect, that a text with a unique reading cannot be the direct ancestor of a text with a supported reading (i. e., it is unlikely that a supported reading is descended from a unique reading). Therefore, the following observations can be made: (a) No text can be derived from A because of A's unique readings in lines 3, 5, and 6. (b) No text can be derived from H because of H's first and third unique readings in line 7. (c) No text can be derived from S because of S's unique reading in line 8. (d) Neither A nor S can be derived from F because of F's unique reading in line 1. Note that this observation, which omits mention of H, implies the likelihood that (e) H is derived from F. In line 1 both F and H read uniquely; in line 7 the first and third unique readings of H contrast with supported readings in F. Thus F cannot be derived from H, but H may be derived from F. 3. The third assumption, that shared errors indicate close relationship, involves only F and H, as the other texts have no errors in common. In line 6, F and H agree on the reading, my armes . Chaucer's practice, however, is to use myn before vowels, my before consonants, and this is also the practice of his time. 9 My armes is therefore regardable as an error implying a close relationship between F and H. 4. The fourth assumption, that the simplest tree is to be preferred, requires the derivation of H from F, thus resolving the problem of 2.e and 3. One might assume, with Heath, that F and H are sister MSS, deriving from a lost MS. This supposition will account for the shared error and H's unique readings but must be rejected because it produces a more complex tree. 5. Paragraph 2.a has shown that neither F nor S can be derived from A; paragraph 2.c, that neither A nor F can be derived from S; paragraph 2.d, that neither A nor S can be derived from F. Paragraphs 2.e, 3, and 4 have shown that H is derived from F. Therefore, we have the following tree: The choice of a basic MS. is limited to F and S, A being discredited because of the number of its unique readings and H because of its derivative nature. The choice between F and S, however, depends upon a problem posed by the title. This problem is more conveniently handled in the next section.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The major reason for believing that Chaucer wrote the Proverbs is the ascription of them to him in the titles of two of the MSS, F and H. 10 What effect does the reclassification have on the testimony given by these titles? One effect is clear: H's testimony has been shown to have no independent value, for H has been demonstrated to be a copy of F and it is reasonable to presume that the scribe of H simply copied the ascription (title) in F along with the text. Even so, the reclassification strengthens the argument for authenticity. The removal of H is more than balanced by the addition of S, for the inclusion of the Proverbs in Stowe's edition of Chaucer is tantamount to an ascription and S has been shown, unlike H, to derive independently from the archetype. 11 Accordingly, in one line of descent an actual ascription appears (F's title); in another line of descent occurs the quasi-ascription of S. This situation allows only the conclusion that the Proverbs were probably ascribed to Chaucer in the archetype itself. The phrasing of the ascription can be tentatively reconstructed. The fact that the word proverb occurs in the titles of all three lines of descent (A, F, and S) implies that this word was in the title of the archetype, and in the singular form. It is plausible to assume that the ascription was made in the simplest way, by the phrase, of Chaucer . Combining these two elements yields, of course, the title of F: Proverbe of Chaucer . Since there are two proverbs, F's title is less appropriate than the plural title used in this paper, which follows popular custom. But the inappropriate singular form would seem to go back to the archetype. The choice of a basic MS. can now be made. If F is chosen, only shul , line 1, and my , line 6, require correcting; if S is selected, mokel , line 7, and cher , line 8, must be changed, and the title also. The preference is thus in F's favor. With F as the basic MS., the following text results: Proverbe of Chaucer What shal these clothes thus manyfolde Loo this hoote somers day After grete hete cometh colde No man caste his pilche away Of all this worlde the large compas It wil not in myn armes tweyne Who so mochel wol embrace Litel ther of he shal distreyne Looked at objectively, with no presuppositions as to the kind of poem Chaucer might or might not write, what grounds remain for doubting the authenticity of the Proverbs ? I can see none. But I would not argue that matters of authenticity can be determined wholly through objectives means. Before concluding, I should like to call attention to a striking difference between the text just given and the version of the Proverbs found in modern editions. 12 In the latter it has become customary, since the nineteenth century, to place a Roman numeral I between the title and the first line and a II between the fourth and fifth lines. The effect is attractive, giving an appearance of form to what, objectively speaking, is hardly a poem at all — merely two stanzas juxtaposed, unrelated except that each expresses a proverb. There is no basis for numerals of any sort in the MSS . Moreover, the numerals would seem to imply an assumption which I am not sure the text will bear out: that the Proverbs were intended as a completed work. With the numerals removed, the Proverbs look more to me like what they may well in actuality be: a fragment, a work begun but abandoned, or, alternatively, quotations, appealing because of their sententious cast, from a work now lost. This latter possibility receives support from such quoted stanzas as the following, itself a kind of proverb, found in MS. Trinity College, Cambridge, R. 3. 20: A. whestone is no kervyng. instrument And yitte . it makeþe / sharpe kerving toolis If þow . wost ought / where þat I haue miswent Eschuwe . þow þat / for suche thing to þee scolle is / þus wyse men / beon offt / ware by foolis If þowe do so / þy witte is wele bewared By his contrarie . is every thing declared 13 This stanza, which is Troilus and Criseyde I.631-637, occurs by itself, as a separate item, in two MSS, both by the scribe John Shirley, who wrote MS. A of the Proverbs . Other such stanzas exist. 14 The suggestion that the Proverbs may have had a similar origin, but in a work now lost, has at least as much basis as the alternate hypothesis, that the Proverbs are a poetic whole complete with Roman numerals. Furthermore, it explains one troubling aspect of the Proverbs , their slightness. No one need expect a fragment to be highly satisfying artistically, not even a fragment by Chaucer. This paper has not set out to prove the authenticity of the Proverbs , which is probably unprovable. What it has done is to furnish a text based upon a classification of four authorities, not three, and to set the record straight, perhaps, on certain matters connected with authenticity.</field>

Kuhn ("Plan and Bibliography," 1954, p. 33), includes the Proverbs in its list of Chaucer's works but precedes the title with a question mark. 3 Page 920. 4 Page lii; I have redrawn Heath's tree. 5 The workes of Geffrey Chaucer , ed. John Stowe (1561), fol. cccxl. 6 For an early printed text to possess "MS. authority" is of course nothing unusual; the names Caxton, Thynne, and even Stowe occur frequently in Robinson's textual notes. Skeat, who did not use the Stowe copy of the Proverbs , had, however, a good opinion of it: "There is a fair copy of them (but not well spelt) in the black-letter edition of 1561" (Skeat, I, 564). 7 The readings for S are from a copy in the British Museum, those for the MSS from my own transcriptions made from the MSS; the three MSS are also printed in the Chaucer Society's Parallel Texts of Chaucer's Minor Poems , Ser. 1, no. 58, p. 431. 8 The assumptions are, for instance, either stated or implied in the rationale of textual criticism by A. A. Hill, "Some Postulates of Distributional Study of Texts," SB , III (1950-51), 63-95. 9 The OED , s. v. Mine , states the normal practice: "Already in the 13th c., the rule in southern and midland Eng. was to use myn before vowels and h , and my before consonants, and this subsisted until the 18th c."; exceptions exist to this "rule," but the Tatlock-Kennedy Concordance to the Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer (1927) does not show a single instance of my before a vowel in Chaucer's writings. 10 There is also the following internal evidence: the Proverbs exhibit no positively non-Chaucerian features (cf. Robinson, p. 865); the second proverb occurs, with rather similar phrasing, in The Canterbury Tales (B 2 2405; "For the proverbe seith, 'He that to muche embraceth, distreyneth litel'"). The recurrence of a proverb, in the sense of popular saying, might mean nothing; however, B. J. Whiting ( Chaucer's Use of Proverbs , 1934, p. 43) says the Proverbs of Chaucer are not of a "popular" variety (the second proverb, even so, resembles M 1295, p. 484, in Tilley's A Dictionary of the Proverbs in England in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries , 1950). 11 Since Stowe attributes to Chaucer poems which are now known definitely to be spurious, his word with regard to the Proverbs might seem to deserve little weight. My point is not that Stowe was right in his attribution but that he must have had a reason for it. 12 As for other differences, I shall limit myself to a collation with Robinson's text, which is also based on F (Robinson's readings are given first): Proverbs , Proverbe of Chaucer ; shul , shal ; thise , these ; manyfold , manyfolde ; Lo , loo ; hote , hoote ; greet , grete ; cold , colder ; world , worlde ; Hit , it ; wol , wil . Some of these differences, but not all, result from Robinson's decision to normalize spelling. 13 Printed in the Chaucer Society's Odd Texts , p. x. 14 The Cantus Troili stanza (I.400-406) appears as a separate item in five MSS (see G.

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of Spenser's Faerie Queene in 1596 by Frank B. Evans</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At least three compositors produced the two volumes of Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene printed in 1596 by Richard Field. 1 Within each volume two hands are clearly distinguished by different skeleton-formes, different ornamental boxes surrounding the canto "arguments," different type-cases, different spelling habits, and different stylistic preferences in such matters as capitalization in the "arguments" and the use of italic or roman fonts for certain catchwords. Although some links between type-cases prove that the two volumes were printed not simultaneously but consecutively, the volumes themselves differ from each other in skeleton-formes and ornamental boxes and display no two entirely parallel patterns of stylistic and spelling preferences. The evidence shows that the two pairs of compositors could not have been identical, but does not conclusively prove or disprove the possibility that one compositor may have worked on both volumes. I shall refer to the compositors as A 1 and B 1 (first volume) and A 2 and B 2 (second volume). The two volumes of Field's 1596 Faerie Queene , printed for William Ponsonbie, have different provenance as well as distinct bibliographic identities. The first, commonly referred to as the "First Part" although not actually so designated on its title page, is substantially a page-for-page reprint of the volume containing Books I-III which John Wolfe printed, also for Ponsonbie, in 1590. Field's second volume, designated "The Second Part" on its title page, prints the new Books IV-VI from now-lost manuscript copy. Like Wolfe's 1590 edition, the two Parts of 1596 are quartos in eights, separately paged and quired. The collation of the First Part is 4°: A-Z 8 , Aa-Oo 8 . That of the Second Part is 4°: A-Z 8 , Aa-Ii 8 Kk 4 . To distinguish the parallel series of signatures, I employ prefixed superscript numerals except in tables where the distinction can be made obvious by other means. I designate individual whole formes by the signature letter or letters followed by "I" or "II" (denoting the outer and inner sheets respectively) and the symbols "(o)" and "(i)" denoting the outer and inner formes of the sheet. Thus, for example, " 2 C II (o)" means the outer forme of the inner sheet of gathering C in the Second Part. Skeleton-formes I denote by letters a through h . Eight different skeleton-formes can be identified in the two volumes. Four skeletons were employed in each Part. They appear in pairs, each pair turning up normally in alternate gatherings. Almost invariably, one skeleton of a pair was used to print and perfect the outer sheet of a gathering and the other to print and perfect its inner sheet. These four pairs of skeletons are the primary but not entirely sufficient means of distinguishing the compositors. In the First Part, the two pairs of skeletons emerge slowly. Formes of gatherings 1 A and 1 B reveal a series of changing combinations of headlines; some of their running-titles turn up in each of the skeletons that eventually take shape. Skeletons a and b (used by Compositor A 1 ) become recognizable in gathering 1 C, attain constant sets of titles in gatherings 1 E and 1 G respectively, and appear in alternate gatherings thereafter. Skeleton a is found on both sides of outer sheets, b on both sides of inner ones. These skeletons are characterized by occasional diagonal switches in the relative positions of either the recto or verso headlines, a phenomenon that can be explained only if the compositor sometimes varied his usually fixed routine of stripping and reimposing. The other pair in the First Part, skeletons c and d (used by Compositor B 1 ), are markedly more irregular. They become recognizable in gathering 1 D and appear in alternate gatherings thereafter, but continue to show shifting combinations of titles and introductions of new titles. At times titles pass from one skeleton of the pair to the other. Although these shifts and migrations obscure their identities and indeed make it impossible to define them strictly as consistent skeletons throughout the volume, each is nearly always recognizable as the same skeleton on both sides of a given sheet. That is to say, sheets were printed and perfected with the same skeleton just as is true almost invariably of sheets printed and perfected in the other three pairs of skeletons. Skeletons c and d however, unlike the other pairs, frequently change between gatherings. Thus, for this pair, it is impossible to align one skeleton with outer and the other with inner sheets. To illustrate, a title with the error "QVEEENE" first appears on an inner sheet (page 1 D3), switches to an outer sheet on both sides (pages 1 F1 and 1 F2), reverts to an inner sheet (page 1 H3), and subsequently appears corrected on various formes. Fortunately, in the present study no question arises which involves the order of printing formes in this pair of skeletons. In the Second Part, all the skeleton-formes are easily identified. Skeletons e and f (Compositor A 2 ) appear in gathering 2 A and invariably thereafter show constant sets of running-titles. Skeletons g and h (Compositor B 2 ) appear respectively on the outer sheet of gathering 2 C (both formes) and on the inner forme of the inner sheet of gathering 2 D. When first set up, skeleton h curiously duplicated on pages 2 D6, 2 G5, 2 G6, and 2 I5 the erroneous title "QVEEENE" found in the First Part. These errors are coincidental so far as the settings themselves are concerned, for the settings in the two Parts are distinct. After correction of this error, skeletons g and h have constant sets of running-titles, but the relative positions of the headlines are occasionally transposed when the forme was turned end-for-end between impositions. All four pairs of skeletons in the two volumes differ in the manner of their handling as well as in their physical identities. Excluding the formes of gatherings 1 A and 1 B (where the skeletons cannot be identified) and grouping skeletons c-d together as a pair (since they cannot be consistently distinguished from each other throughout the volume), the following table indicates the formes imposed in each skeleton. Because the same skeleton nearly always appears on both sides of a sheet, only the sheets are discriminated in the table except in the few irregular instances. First Part Second Part Skeletons Skeletons Skeletons Skeletons a b c-d e f g h C I C II D I-II A I A II E I E II F I-II B I B II G I G II H I-II C II C I I I I II K I-II D I L I L II M I-II E I E II D II(o) D II(i) N I N II O I-II F I F II G I G II P I P II Q I-II H I H II I I I II R I R II S I-II K I K II L I L II T I T II V I-II M I M II N I N II X I X II Y I-II O I O II P I P II Z I Z II Aa I-II Q I Q II R I R II Bb I Bb II Cc I-II T I T II S I S II Dd I Dd II Ee I-II V I V II X I X II Ff I Ff II Gg I-II Y I Y II Z I Z II Hh I Hh II Ii I-II Aa I Aa II Bb I Bb II Kk I Kk II Ll I-II Cc I Cc II Dd I Dd II Mm I Mm II Nn I-II Ee I Ee II Ff I Ff II Oo I Oo II Gg I Gg II Hh I Hh II Ii I Ii II Kk (i) Kk (o) With some exceptions which further evidence will elucidate, these four groups of formes represent the work of the various compositors. Recurring impressions of identifiable type prove that within each volume the two compositors employed separate type-cases for most but perhaps not all fonts. In the italic used for the "arguments," some identifiable types are confined to one or another of the groups of formes produced by each compositor; but a few may occur in both groups of the same volume. The fineness of this type and the relative brevity of this part of the text make trustworthy evidence hard to find. But one instance at least is quite clear. The italic 'B' damaged in two places which appears in the "arguments" on pages 1 F6, 1 Cc6 v , and 1 Ee7 v (skeletons c-d ) is identical to that on page 1 N8 (skeleton a ). If the compositors began with different type-cases for this font, they did not keep them entirely separate. On the other hand, I have found no examples indicating a common type-case when the same italic font is used for names in the main body of the text. Several large display types at canto beginnings recur often enough to show that each group of formes is independent with respect to this font also. In the main body of the text, including both the normal roman and the italic used for names, distinctive types are frequent and show that each group of formes in a volume reflects a different type-case. Two examples from each group will suffice for illustration. In formes imposed in skeletons a and b : (1) A roman 'B' showing a break in the vertical near the middle and a smudge within the upper loop: pages 1 N2 v , 1 P6 v , 1 X6 v , 1 X7 v , 1 Hh8, 1 Kk1, 1 Mm7, 1 Mm8, 1 Oo7 v . (2) A roman 's', its lower curve bent downward and separated from the tip: pages 1 C3 v , 1 C6 v , 1 E3 v , 1 E6 v , 1 L2 v , 1 N1, 1 N2, 1 P1, 1 T3, 1 X1 v , 1 X4 v , 1 Bb4 v , 1 Dd4 v , 1 Dd7, 1 Ff2 v , 1 Kk4 v , 1 Kk5 v , 1 Mm5 v . In formes imposed in skeletons c-d : (3) A swash italic 'M', its bottom serif at the right separated from the vertical and, beginning with the second impression, a break at the juncture of the right-hand slanting and vertical strokes: pages 1 S1 v , 1 Y4 v , 1 Aa4, 1 Ee5, 1 Ii4, 1 Ll4, 1 Nn1 v . (4) A swash italic 'M' showing a break in its left-hand slanting stroke: pages 1 A2 v , 1 K1 v , 1 O2, 1 Ll8, 1 Nn6 v . In formes imposed in skeletons e and f : (5) A roman 'L', its horizontal broken near the juncture with the vertical: pages 2 B6 v , 2 B8, 2 C5, 2 E4, 2 F8 v , 2 H1, 2 K4, 2 O5 v , 2 Q3 v , 2 Ii6. (6) A roman double 'ff', the second letter broken above its cross-bar: pages 2 A5, 2 C6, 2 E7 v , 2 F5 v , 2 O1 v , 2 Q5 v , 2 T6, 2 V1 v . In formes imposed in skeletons g and h : (7) A roman 'g', its serif missing and the lower loop broken in three places: pages 2 C1, 2 C2, 2 D6 v , 2 D7 v , 2 I3 v , 2 L5 v , 2 L6 v , 2 N5 v , 2 S2 v , 2 X4 v , 2 X5 v , 2 Bb4 v , 2 Dd4, 2 Ff4. (8) A roman 'l', its bottom separated from the vertical: pages 2 D3, 2 D3 v , 2 I2 v , 2 L4 v , 2 X2, 2 Bb3 v , 2 Bb6 v , 2 Dd2, 2 Dd8 v , 2 Ff4, 2 Hh5, 2 Hh5 v , 2 Kk2, 2 Kk2 v . Perhaps as many as eight distinctive types found in the first two gatherings of the First Part subsequently diverge into either group of formes: example (4) is an instance. In the Second Part, one type found first in a forme imposed in skeleton e next appears in skeleton g , probably the first and second times that skeleton was used: (9) A roman 'A' with a broken bar: pages 2 B1 v , then 2 C8 and probably also 2 C8 v , 2 D2. I have discovered no other type in the main body of the text which occurs in both groups of formes within either volume. Of the seven types I have found common to both volumes, three disappear for suspiciously long intervals between their last occurrences in the First Part and their first in the Second. One of these links the type-cases of Compositors A 1 and A 2 : (10) A swash italic 'M', its lower right serif separated from the vertical and showing a break near the top of its left slanting stroke, similar to examples (3) and (4) but not the same: pages 1 E6 v (skeleton b ); 2 H4 v , 2 K5, 2 O4, 2 T3 v , 2 V2, 2 Aa6 v , 2 Cc5, 2 Ee8 v , 2 Gg4 v , 2 Ii4 v (skeletons e-f ). The other two link the type-cases of Compositors B 1 and B 2 : (11) A roman 'g' with a distorted lower loop: pages 1 B4 v , 1 F6 v , 1 M1, 1 M8, 1 O3 (skeletons c-d ); 2 X2 v , 2 Z1, 2 Bb4 v (skeletons g-h ). (12) A roman 'e', its tail distorted: pages 1 A6, 1 D1 v , 1 D8 v , 1 F2, 1 F7, 1 H8 v , 1 K7, 1 M8, 1 Aa7 v , 1 Cc8, 1 Nn1 (skeletons c-d ); 2 P4 v , 2 Bb6, 2 Dd8, 2 Ff1 v (skeletons g-h ). One of the remaining examples also links the type-cases of Compositors B 1 and B 2 : (13) A roman 'w', its left-hand 'v' higher than the right and broken to the right of the point: pages 1 F4, 1 H1 v , 1 K1, 1 K3 v , 1 M6 v , 1 O1, 1 O7 v , 1 Q2 v , 1 Q3 v , 1 S2, 1 V3, 1 V3 v , 1 Y6 v , 1 Aa4, 1 Aa7, 1 Cc5, 1 Cc6, 1 Ee8, 1 Gg3, 1 Gg4, 1 Ii4, 1 Ii6 v , 1 Ll5 v , 1 Ll6 v , 1 Nn1 v (skeletons c-d ); 2 D2 v , 2 D8, 2 G1, 2 G2, 2 I1 v , 2 I7, 2 P1 v , 2 P8 v , 2 R2 v (skeletons g-h ). The other three examples contradictorily link the type-cases of Compositors B 1 and A 2 : (14) An italic 'B', its lower loop broken at the bottom: pages 1 Cc8 v , 1 Ee6 v , 1 Nn4 v (skeletons c-d ); 2 A4, 2 B5, 2 E1, 2 O7, 2 Y8 v (skeletons e-f ). (15) A swash italic 'M' damaged across the tops of all but the right-hand vertical: pages 1 A8 v , 1 S6 v , 1 Y4 v , 1 Ee1 v , 1 Gg1 v , 1 Ll4 v , 1 Nn5 (skeletons c-d ); 2 K7, 2 O3, 2 T8, 2 V4, 2 Gg6 v , 2 Ii1 (skeletons e-f ). (16) A roman 'c' showing a dot above a downward bent tail: pages 1 Ee1, 1 Ll5 (skeletons c-d ); 2 A5 v , 2 B4 v , 2 O4 v (skeletons e-f ). Four patterns of canto divisions paralleling the four pairs of skeleton-formes provide another means of distinguishing the compositors. Each pattern has several characteristics. The ornamental boxes enclosing the canto "arguments" are different repeated settings identifiable by the arrangement of the individual type-units composing them. Three patterns show duplicate boxes (employed because two cantos sometimes begin on the same forme) and the fourth has one box in four states. Both boxes used by Compositor A 1 have an ovoid scroll design in obvious contrast to the floral scroll designs of all the others. The box in four states used normally by Compositor B 2 is also easily recognizable by the position of its bottom border within rather than under the sides. Over a box appears the word "Canto" or "Cant." (followed by the appropriate number) which is usually a repeated setting associated with that box. Compositor A 1 employs a normal 'C' in this heading with his first box, but a swash 'C' with his second box on its single occurrence. Compositors B 1 and A 2 employ swash forms consistently; B 2 employs the normal. The "arguments" within the boxes provide a third identifying feature. These "arguments" are heptameter couplets printed as four lines, the even lines indented and not requiring initial capitals unless of course they begin with names or titles. In two instances words are split between lines (1.7 "great-/ly" and 2.6 "bro-/ther") so that capitalization would be quite awkward. Yet capitals occur in the second and fourth lines of some "arguments" both in 1590 and 1596. Each compositor in 1596 has a clear preference in this matter which is obvious from inspection and (in the First Part) comparison with his copy. Compositor A 1 altered 1590 eight times to lower-case and preserved only four unnecessary capitals. Compositor B 1 altered his copy four times to capitals; otherwise he merely reproduced 1590 with its preponderance of capitals. Disregarding for the moment two "arguments" of dubious provenance, Compositor A 2 set only three unnecessary capitals in thirty-three opportunities, never using two in the same "argument." Compositor B 2 , on the other hand, never set a lower-case initial in at least twenty-five chances. The final feature of the patterns of canto divisions is the font used for catchwords referring to new cantos when these begin at the top of a page. Compositors A 1 and A 2 print them in roman capitals ("CANT.") but B 1 and B 2 in italic (" Cant. "). The pages on which features of each pattern appear are shown in the lists below. The various boxes and their accompanying headings are indicated by roman numerals followed by "a" or "b" to distinguish duplicate settings or by arabic subscripts to distinguish states. Initial words of the even lines of "arguments" are given to show each compositor's practice with respect to capitalization. It may be remarked that two unnecessary capitals in the "arguments" of Compositor A 1 may have been introduced for the sake of symmetry when a name occurs in the other line, although this consideration does not seem to have influenced the other compositors.

The four exceptions are: (1) the roman catchword of Compositor A 2 on page 2 C2 v occurs in skeleton g , on its first or second use; (2) the same compositor's box IIIa occurs on page 2 R6 v in skeleton h , where its "argument" contains two unnecessary capitals characteristic of B 2 rather than A 2 ; (3) the same box occurs again on page 2 X1 v in skeleton g , where proper names make the capitals inconclusive; and (4) box IV4 of Compositor B 2 , with two unnecessary capitals characteristic of him in its "argument," occurs on page 2 Y3 in skeleton f . The fifth irregularity is that the catchword on page 2 X6 v , although in B 2 's normal italics and his skeleton, is erroneous: the predicted canto begins not on page 2 X7 but on 2 Y3. Explanations of these irregularities will be given in due course. Spellings offer still another means of comparing the compositors. In the First Part, the habits of Compositors A 1 and B 1 can be ascertained quite precisely by observing their alterations and reproductions of the known copy. The spelling of 1590 is itself inconsistent, because (as there is evidence to prove) Wolfe like Field employed more than one compositor and they did not uniformly follow the manuscript of Books I-III. Since the division of 1590 between compositors does not parallel that of 1596, Compositors A 1 and B 1 each found in their copy the same variants in roughly the same proportions. If a compositor consistently rejects one variant offered by his copy in favor of another, he obviously exercises a genuine preference. If he tolerates more than one variant, especially if he sometimes alters his copy inconsistently, his lack of a real spelling preference is equally clear. Knowledge of his rejections and tolerations serves as a check on the significance of mere totals, which in themselves may be accidental. In citing statistics for Compositors A 1 and B 1 , I use a system of notation which distinguishes between alterations and reproductions of copy and also indicates totals. Thus, for example, "71&gt; farre = 88" means that in seventy-one instances the spelling of 1590 has been altered in 1596 to farre , resulting in a total of eighty-eight occurrences of this spelling (seventeen having been reproduced). If either symbol is given alone, all instances are alterations or reproductions. It is usually unnecessary to specify the spellings of 1590. Excluding a very few and very minor exceptions, only two variants are involved for most words, and the spellings of 1590 can be inferred from the symbols. Spellings in the first two gatherings of the First Part are not counted, of course, when there is a question of discriminating between Compositors A 1 and B 1 , because the assignment of formes in those gatherings is uncertain. Not knowing the copy for the Second Part, we have no certain check on the significance of total variants in the work of Compositors A 2 and B 2 . But even if the manuscript was not Spenser's holograph—which it quite likely was—there is good reason to believe that it contained a high proportion of spellings known to be his. 2 Although known Spenserian spellings generally diminish between 1590 and the First Part, they often increase in the Second even for some words which both compositors almost certainly prefer to spell differently from Spenser. A particularly striking example is the fate of Spenser's medial -oo- in blood and bloody . In 1590, except in the first few gatherings, Spenser's spelling occurs almost invariably. But in the First Part of 1596, 65&gt; bloudy ( -ie ) = 70. The adjective is never spelled as Spenser spells it. When the noun appears in non-rhyming positions, 96&gt; bloud = 101 and blood = 1. In rhymes, for the sake of conformity with wood , good and so forth, 1&gt; blood =21 although 1&gt; bloud = 2. Both compositors in the Second Part also prefer -ou- (which appears five times even in rhymes), but instances of -oo- increase in the adjective and in the noun when it does not form a rhyme. The adjective is bloud- 29 but blood - 9. In non-rhyming positions, the noun is bloud 42 but blood 8. Compositor B 2 insists on -ou- somewhat more than does A 2 , but he contributes three -oo- spellings in the adjective and one in the non-rhyming noun. Other Spenserian spellings which similarly diminish in the First Part but increase in the Second are abrode , admyre , doe , farre , fynd ( e ), mynd ( e ); these will be cited in detail later. If we should suppose that Compositors A 2 and B 2 actually preferred the Spenserian forms of these words but found the non-Spenserian in their copy (or that they tolerated inconsistent copy), we should have to concede immediately that they could not be the same individuals as A 1 and B 1 . But the more plausible explanation is that Spenserian spellings predominated in the manuscript. If this deduction is sound, we have a good clue to the significance of total variants in the Second Part when Spenser's spelling of a word is known. Variant spellings of eighteen words are given below as they occur in the work of each compositor in 1596. Spenser's known preferences are marked by asterisks. Although his practice was not entirely consistent, his preferences for most of the words in this list are well-established. Compositor A 1 Compositor B 1 Compositor A 2 Compositor B 2 abroad = 6 2&gt; abroad = 10 *abrode 4 *abrode 8 *abrode = 4 *abrode = 1 abroad 1 abroad 2 *admyre = 2 2&gt; admire = 3 *admyre 9 admire 8 admire = 2 admire 6 *admyre 2 3&gt; find(e) = 30 11&gt; find(e) = 48 find(e) 34 find(e) 15 1&gt; *fynd(e) = 3 *fynd(e) 9 *fynd(e) 8 4&gt; mind(e) = 38 12&gt; mind(e) = 43 mind(e) 46 mind(e) 28 1&gt; *mynd(e) = 1 *mynd(e) = 2 *mynd(e) 8 *mynd(e) 18 1&gt; alwaies = 6 4&gt; alwayes = 7 alwayes 5 alwaies 9 alwaies 2 alwayes 1 4&gt; dayes = 16 10&gt; dayes = 24 dayes 18 daies 13 daies = 4 daies 3 dayes 5 1&gt; wayes = 14 9&gt; wayes = 16 wayes 9 waies 12 waies = 2 waies 2 wayes 1 25&gt; bl(ou)die = 27 2&gt; *bl(ou)dy = 31 bl(ou)die 17 *bl(ou)dy 14 *bl(ou)dy = 2 2&gt; bl(ou)die = 3 *bl(ou)dy 6 bl(ou)die 1 17&gt; mightie = 35 13&gt; *mighty = 38 mightie 29 *mighty 26 1&gt; *mighty = 3 2&gt; mightie = 8 *mighty 3 mightie 1 Compositor A 1 Compositor B 1 Compositor A 2 Compositor B 2 14&gt; do = 40 94&gt; do = 116 *doe 124 *doe 104 6&gt; *doe = 90 do 28 do 17 71&gt; *farre = 88 3&gt; far = 51 *farre 69 *farre 25 far = 3 1&gt; *farre = 17 far 1 far 23 4&gt; *honour = 20 5&gt; *honour = 28 *honour 21 *honour 12 honor = 6 honor 7 honor 5 3&gt; horror = 15 13&gt; *horrour = 19 horror 5 *horrour 8 *horrour = 4 *horrour 3 5&gt; *litle = 29 5&gt; little = 15 *litle 48 little 25 5&gt; little = 13 *litle = 17 little 6 *litle 12 *whiles = 62 9&gt; *whiles = 55 *whiles 23 *whiles 20 whyles 9 3&gt; *whil(e)st = 11 2&gt; *whil(e)st = 14 *whil(e)st 20 *whil(e)st 26 whylest = 1 whylest 16 whylest 1 3&gt; whylome = 14 6&gt; *whilome = 15 whylome 18 *whilome 12 1&gt; *whilome = 2 whylome = 2 *whilome 3 whylome 5 A final set of variants is too complicated to summarize in a table. In 1590, usual spellings are suddein ( e ) 36 and suddeinly 15. Suddain(e) occurs twice and suddenly four times in the first two gatherings; in the corresponding gatherings of 1596, these spellings and three instances of suddein ( e ) are reproduced. In gathering 1 C, the first known to be Compositor A 1 's, the usual spellings of 1590 are all changed: 3&gt; suddaine and 1&gt; suddainly . In the rest of his work, suddein ( e ) = 17 and suddeinly = 6, but 7&gt; suddenly = 8. Compositor B 1 in work known to be his invariably reproduces suddein ( e ) = 13 and suddeinly = 6. In the Second Part, Compositor A 2 's spellings are suddain 1, but sudden at least 9 and suddenly at least 8. On formes 2 C I (i) and 2 D I (i), among the first to be printed in skeleton g , the spellings are sudden 4 and suddenly 3. On forme 2 D II (o), also printed in skeleton g , * sodein occurs once. This is Spenser's preferred spelling, although he also spells soddein . Compositor B 2 's invariable spellings in subsequent formes in skeletons g and h are sodaine 9 and sodainely 6. Several of these variant spellings confirm the other evidence which distinguishes two compositors within each volume. In the First Part, Compositor A 1 exhibits strong preferences for - ie and for * farre . Though less positively, B 1 prefers *- y and far . Compositor B 1 's overwhelming rejection of * doe contrasts sharply with A 1 's nearly equal retention of this spelling. Compositor A 1 's alwaies , * litle , and whylome balance B 1 's alwayes , little , and * whilome . In the Second Part, regardless of what spellings appeared in the copy, it can scarcely be chance in every case that Compositor A 2 's majority spellings are * admyre , alwayes , dayes , wayes , bloudie , mightie , * litle, sudden , and whylome ; whereas B 2 's are admire, alwaies , daies , waies , bloudy , * mighty , little , sodaine , and * whilome . Neither compositor is consistently Spenserian. Whichever may have been more faithful to the copy in spelling any one of these words, the other generally departed from it. If we make the likely assumption that the manuscript spellings were Spenser's, A 2 shows no clear preference in merely reproducing * farre ; but then B 2 shows a strong liking for far . Other examples which on this assumption can be added to the list of differences are A 2 's relatively stronger preference for find ( e ) and mind ( e ), honor and horror , whyles and whylest . Comparisons between the two volumes do not yield equally positive results. On grounds of other evidence as well as spellings, the only pairs of compositors likely to be identical are A 1 -A 2 and B 1 -B 2 . Several particular spellings such as - ie or - y and * litle or little suggest this alignment. Compositors A 1 and A 2 parallel each other not only in nearly every specific spelling but also in their general pattern of tolerating a relatively high proportion of minority variants. For some words, in fact, the real preference of both may have been not a particular spelling of their own but fidelity to the copy. Thus Compositor A 1 generally reproduces either do or * doe , * litle or little , and inconsistently changes to both forms of both words. If his personal preference was actually for little , even though this is his minority spelling, so too very likely was A 2 's. All six of A 2 's minority spellings little occur within the first nine instances of the word in his work; after gathering 2 E, he consistently spells * litle . In contrast, ten of Compositor B 2 's twelve minority spellings * litle occur within the first fourteen instances; he spells little consistently after gathering 2 N except in two instances near the end of the volume. One or the other of these compositors began by expressing his personal preference but suppressed it in favor of adherence to the copy; if the copy spelled * litle , this compositor was A 2 . The evidence would permit a similar argument that both A 1 and A 2 may have preferred do , which they employ frequently, even though * doe is their majority form. Regardless of the force of these arguments, however, the tolerance of Compositors A 1 and A 2 is sufficiently marked that the few apparent discrepancies between them bear little weight. Only abroad - * abrode, alwaies-alwayes , and suddein-suddain fail to fit into a consistent pattern. But fidelity to the copy readily explains the first two exceptions. If the copy for the Second Part spelled * sod ( d ) ein , it is perhaps difficult to understand why a compositor who usually reproduced suddein ( e ) in the First Part should offer -ain in the Second. But Compositor A 1 had also spelled suddain , and A 2 uses it only once. The more telling fact is that both also spell sudden . No significant differences in spelling distinguish these compositors. Although similarities cannot prove their identity, the parallels are sufficient in the absence of any clear negative evidence to raise the presumption that A 1 and A 2 were the same individual. Compositors B 1 and B 2 , however, can scarcely have been the same man. A compositor who ruthlessly altered all ninety-four instances of * doe in 1590 to do in the First Part is not likely to have introduced or reproduced * doe one hundred and four times in the Second. It is hardly any more plausible, in the face of Compositor B 1 's obviously strong bias toward alwayes, dayes , and wayes , to suppose that he would have tolerated the preponderance of alwaies, daies , and waies in the Second Part even if these forms appeared in the copy. Although Compositor B 1 practically eliminated * fynd ( e ), * mynd ( e ), honor, horror , and whylome (which appear rather frequently in his copy), both the Spenserian spellings and the non-Spenserian - or and whylome show up with relatively high frequencies in the work of B 2 . When B 1 merely reproduces suddein from his copy, he discloses no certain preference. But B 2 , who reproduced Spenser's * sodein the first time he encountered it and then settled on sodaine , does reject - ein . With the evidence now set forth, it is possible to clarify the irregularities already noted in the two volumes and draw certain conclusions about their printing. Formes and even individual pages in the first two gatherings of the First Part show signs of both Compositors A 1 and B 1 . Most of the running-titles found in the skeletons diverge and reappear in either of the pairs which eventually emerge. Several distinctive types found scattered on six of the eight formes likewise recur later in either group of formes. Compositor B 1 's ornamental box or his italic canto catchwords appear on all four outer formes. Unfortunately, reliable spelling clues are rare. The only persuasive ones are eleven alterations of the copy to do , indicating Compositor B 1 , scattered on six pages of five formes. Since Compositor A 1 's spelling preferences are less definite, they cannot be recognized even if he also had a hand in the composition. On some of the same pages and formes, however, occur types which later turn up in the case of Compositor A 1 . Although the evidence is meager, it suggests that Compositor B 1 may have set most of the type, perhaps under A 1 's supervision, but that both compositors cooperated in distributing. Commencing with gathering 1 C, the compositors worked independently throughout the First Part. If the Second Part was printed immediately after the First, it is difficult to explain why the skeletons and boxes were not continued in use for the second volume and indeed why the same pair of compositors did not continue. But it is quite possible that Ponsonbie arranged for the reprinting of Books I-III in advance of Spenser's arrival from Ireland with the manuscript of the new Books IV-VI. We do not know exactly when he reached London. Ponsonbie entered the new books in the Stationers' Register on January 20, 1596, and it is reasonable to suppose, first, that Spenser would have brought so long and important a manuscript himself and, second, that he would have lost no time in arranging for its publication. On the other hand, Ponsonbie's dedicatory letter in Amoretti and Epithalamion implies that Spenser sent the manuscript of this volume to London and states that Ponsonbie published it "in his absence." The copy was entered in the Stationers' Register November 19, 1594, and the title page is dated 1595. In the same year, also probably while Spenser was still in Ireland, Ponsonbie published Colin Clouts Come Home Again . Since the only substantial revisions of the First Part of the Faerie Queene in 1596 were one added stanza (1.11.3) and five new stanzas substituted for the three originally concluding Book III, Spenser may well have sent ahead the necessary copy and entrusted his publisher with the reprinting. If the First Part was completed before Spenser arrived with the new manuscript, we have an explanation of why new skeletons and boxes were set up and why there are relatively few links—some apparently contradictory—between the type-cases employed in the two volumes. 3 When printing did begin for the Second Part, Compositor A 2 was apparently using the type-case used by B 1 in the First Part. Distinctive types (14), (15), and (16) quite closely link the cases of B 1 -A 2 . On the other hand, three of the four types— (10), (11), and (12) —which seem to link A 1 -A 2 and B 1 -B 2 disappear for long intervals between their appearances in the two Parts and are probably only strays. The fourth, type (13), actually transferred to the case of B 2 through the hands of A 2 early in the Second Part. Compositor A 2 produced gatherings 2 A and 2 B and sheet 2 C II (both formes), using skeletons e and f . He also composed formes 2 C I(i) and (o) and 2 D I (i), imposing them in skeleton g . Type (9) is first found on forme 2 B I (i) in skeleton e and then recurs on forme 2 C I (i) and probably on 2 C I (o) and 2 D I (i). The canto catchword on forme 2 C I (o) is in A 2 's characteristic roman capitals. Three instances of his spelling sudden ( ly ) occur on forme 2 C I (i) and four on 2 D I (i). At this point, forme 2 D I (i) was transferred to and stripped and distributed by B 2 . His box, with characteristic unnecessary capitals in the "argument," occurs on forme 2 D I (o), the next imposed in skeleton g . Along with this skeleton, type (13) transferred from its appearance on forme 2 D I (i) to 2 D I (o) and subsquently continues in B 2 's case. He set up a new skeleton h , containing the misprint "QVEEENE" in one of its titles, and imposed in it forme 2 D II (i), which shows the spelling * sodein . He completed gathering 2 D by imposing forme 2 D II (o) in skeleton g . The order in which Compositor B 2 began to produce formes has an important bearing on the irregularities later in the Second Part. Since the stanzaic form of the poem made casting-off the copy relatively easy, any order would have been possible. Actually, the way in which B 2 began to work seems to have led him, starting with gathering 2 G, into the sequence (alternating between skeletons) inner sheet outer forme, outer sheet outer forme, inner sheet inner forme, outer sheet inner forme. Errors in his headlines imply in five out of six instances that he imposed outer formes before inner ones, and the single exception is itself part of the chain of later irregularities. 4 If he imposed outer formes first, it can be deduced that inner sheets must conversely have preceded outer ones, for otherwise he could not have managed as long as he did with only one canto heading and box: the opposite sequence would have required canto beginnings on some consecutive formes. The sequence he did follow was probably a result of his poor workmanship on the first forme he produced, that is 2 D II (i). This is the only forme in the 1596 edition known to exist in as many as three states and it contains nine variants besides the still-uncorrected "QVEEENE" in a title. It was composed by B 2 simultaneously with A 2 's composition of 2 D I (i), imposed in skeleton g . When skeleton g was transferred to him, B 2 used it for forme 2 DI (o) and also—since skeleton h was still tied up during the correction of 2 DII (i)—for 2 DII (o). The use of g twice in succession led to the priority of inner sheets, though not inevitably, as the skeletons could have been switched between sheets. The sequence may be represented thus: Skeleton g : 2 D I (o) 2 D II (o) 2 G I (o) 2 G I (i) Skeleton h : 2 D II (i) ............ 2 G II (o) 2 G II (i) If this sequence is projected it and it alone will be found to accommodate all the evidence of errors in headlines, recurring type, and repeated settings of canto headings up to gathering 2 X. This sequence accounts for the first irregular appearance of Compositor A 2 's box IIIa on B 2 's forme 2 R II (o). Compositor B 2 's box IV was on the press in the immediately preceding forme 2 P I (i), and rather than set up a new one he borrowed his colleague's. He reverted to his own box IV on 2 S II (o). Compositor B 2 's second use of box IIIa on forme 2 X I (i) is another borrowing connected with the erroneous canto catchword on page 2 X6 v and the anomalous appearance of his own box IV and "argument" in skeleton f when the predicted canto does begin on page 2 Y3. This "argument" for Canto 12, Book V, announces as a topic of the canto Artegal's rescue of Sir Burbon; but this episode has already been related in stanzas 44-65 of Canto 11. None of the explanations of this discrepancy hitherto offered has been entirely plausible on literary grounds or has taken into account all the relevant bibliographic evidence. 5 A hypothesis which does fit and explain the facts is that Spenser inserted stanzas 37-43 of Canto 11 into the poem after some of the copy originally intended at this point was already in type. These stanzas relate Artegal's meeting with Sir Sergis. In one sense at least, Sir Sergis is clearly a newcomer to the poem. Although Artegal (and Spenser) declare in this passage that he attended Irena when she appealed to the Faerie Queene for aid against Grantorto, Irena actually seems to have been alone on that occasion (5.1.4) and Sir Sergis has not been mentioned earlier. He appears in Canto 11 to inform Artegal that Irena's plight has become urgent while her champion has been distracted by other matters. Spenser may have inserted this passage to stress the urgency of protecting Ireland against Spanish Catholicism. Whatever the poet's motive, Compositor B 2 did not expect these stanzas or those relating the rescue of Burbon. The stanzas about Sir Sergis now exactly occupy pages 2 X7 and 2 X7 v . But B 2 set his catchword " Canto. " after stanza 36 at the foot of page 2 X6 v . He composed the "argument" for Canto 12, announcing the rescue of Burbon, and imposed it in his box IV with the expectation that it would appear on page 2 X7. On this view, in the original copy Canto 11 consisted of Prince Arthur's rescue of Lady Belge from Gerioneo (stanzas 1-35) and a final stanza (36) making a transition to the titular hero Artegal, who proceeds on his delayed quest to aid Irena. The narrative of Canto 12 began with the Burbon story. Let us put the closing and opening lines of these narrative portions together: So forth he [Artegal] fared as his manner was, With onely Talus wayting diligent, Through many perils and much way did pas, Till nigh vnto the place at length approcht he has. (5.11.36.6-9) To which as they approcht, the cause to know, They saw a Knight [Burbon] in daungerous distresse Of a rude rout him chasing to and fro . . . (5.11.44.1-3) Excepting the parenthetical tag "the cause to know," these stanzas link together with perfect narrative and rhetorical consistency. The parenthetical words refer to the "rout of people" that (as the text now stands) caught the attention of Artegal and Sir Sergis in stanza 43. But the same phenomenon of "a rude rout" is given independently in stanza 44. There is no other connection with stanzas 37-43. If we suppose only some other tag than "the cause to know," Spenser could have written stanzas 36 and 44 consecutively. His practice may well have been to write narrative portions without stopping to consider canto divisions, "arguments," and reflective introductory stanzas. When he introduced a canto division between stanzas 36 and 44 (as I think he originally did), the close rhetorical connection between them was broken and the beginning of stanza 44 would have become abrupt unless the original introductory stanzas of Canto 12 supplied some immediate antecedent for "To which." The present second stanza of Canto 12 refers to both the Burbon and Gerioneo episodes as past and only the Grantorto episode as imminent. In other words, it fits the text we now have (unlike the "argument") and therefore must have been written or revised after the Burbon incident was shifted to Canto 11. All that need be assumed to reconstruct a smooth original text is a somewhat different version of this stanza and some other tag than "the cause to know" in the first line of stanza 44. 6 The hypothesis that Spenser inserted the Sir Sergis passage during printing fits and explains the bibliographical evidence. If the sequence in which B 2 was producing formes is projected into gathering 2 X, it would be: Skeleton g : 2 X I (o) 2 X I (i) Skeleton h : 2 X II (o) 2 X II (i) Having completed the first of these formes, 2 X II (o), which contains the catchword, B 2 began to compose forme 2 X I (o), which would have contained the beginning of Canto 12. This forme was ready for imposition or nearly so, I believe, when Spenser decided to insert the Sir Sergis passage after stanza 36, that is on pages 2 X7 (of this forme) and 2 X7 v . Most if not all the text on forme 2 X I (o) could be salvaged as soon as the necessary re-arrangement of pages became clear. Pending this, B 2 suspended work on the outer forme and proceeded to compose the inner forme 2 X I (i). Pages 2 X1 v and 2 X2 of this forme were unaffected and could have been composed before Spenser supplied the new copy. But for the opening of Canto 11 on page 2 X1 v Compositor B 2 borrowed box IIIa, because his own box IV was already set up with the "argument" for Canto 12. As soon as new copy was at hand and it had been decided to shift the Burbon episode to Canto 11, forme 2 X I (i) was completed and imposed. As an error in a headline shows, this inner forme exceptionally preceded 2 X I (o). (If the new sequence for formes of outer sheets thus established is projected, it accommodates all the facts in the rest of his formes.) Forme 2 X II (i), which was entirely unaffected by the textual changes, was produced, and then 2 X I (o) was completed. Box IV, with the "argument" for Canto 12, was transferred to A 2 for use on page 2 Y3. No reason appears for shifting the Burbon incident to Canto 11, unless it was to balance the canto lengths more nearly. Although Spenser seems to have made the necessary revision of the second introductory stanza of Canto 12, the concurrent need to revise the "argument" was overlooked. The erroneous catchword may have been on the press and beyond the trouble of correcting when the shift was made. Minor revisions in the narrative of Canto 12 must have been attended to, for Sir Sergis is meant in the tag "that old knight" (5.12.6.1) and is once explicitly named (5.12.10.7). All the significant irregularities in the printing of the 1596 Faerie Queene have now been accounted for. Each volume was produced by a pair of compositors, whose hands can be differentiated except in the first two gatherings of the First Part. The two pairs of compositors were not identical and may have been four individuals. The First Part may well have been printed in Spenser' absence, but the Second reveals a clear instance of his intervention during printing. These conclusions open the way for a more critical edition of the Faerie Queene than now exists.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 For this study, I have used a copy of 1596 (both Parts) in the Library of the College of William and Mary, with reference also to copies of both 1590 and 1596 in the Folger Library and the libraries of Haverford College and Princeton University. F. R. Johnson, A Critical Bibliography of the Works of Edmund Spenser (1933), lists accurately the pagination and other errors in headlines (including variants) of the 1590 and 1596 editions. 2 Roland M. Smith, "Spenser's Scholarly Script and 'Right Writing,'" Studies in Honor of T. W. Baldwin , ed. D. C. Allen (1958), pp. 66-111, examines Spenser's spellings in official letters in his hand. 3 A. E. M. Kirwood, "Richard Field, Printer, 1589-1624," The Library , 4th series, XII (1931), 24, states that Field's output in 1596 reached a maximum of "over 4,400 pages," more than twice his average production. Roughly one-quarter of this total would be accounted for by the Faerie Queene . He could not have let his presses and workmen stand idle waiting for copy. The Faerie Queene was completed before November 12, 1596, when King James in Edinburgh "conceaued great offence" over the "publishing in prynte" of what he deemed slanders against himself and Mary Stuart in the allegory of Book V; see F. I. Carpenter, A Reference Guide to Edmund Spenser (1923), p. 41. 4 The misprint "QVEEENE" in an early running-title was corrected between pages 2I5 (outer forme) and 2I6 (inner forme); the erroneous canto number on page 2 R5 v persisted from its correct appearance on the previous outer forme; the erroneous canto number on page 2 Ff3 (outer forme), carried over from 2 Dd4 (inner forme), was corrected on 2 Ff4 (inner forme); and the errors on outer forme pages 2 N1 and 2 Hh8 v (not traceable to previous uses of the skeletons) would not have been likely if inner formes had been printed first, for they show canto numbers which would have been correct on the outer formes if left unchanged. The only exception is that forme 2 X I(i) was imposed before 2 X I(o), for the uncorrected state of the outer forme shows an erroneous canto number on page 2 X1 which persisted from the inner forme. 5 See E. Greenlaw et al. , The Works of Edmund Spenser (1932-1949), "The Faerie Queene, Book Five," pp. 259, 262, 331. J. G. McManaway ( ibid. , pp. 372-373) attempted to explain the erroneous catchword but was unaware of the related bibliographic evidence. J. W. Bennett, The Evolution of the Faerie Queene (1942), pp. 201-205, cited the catchword in support of her argument that the attack on Artegal by Envy and Detraction (stanzas 28-40 of Canto 12) is a last-minute addition to the text. The catchword has no connection with this passage, nor is there any other bibliographic evidence related to its possible insertion during printing. 6 For a similarly neat possible revision, prior to printing, see Rudolf Gottfried, "Spenser Expands His Text," Renaissance News , XVI (Spring, 1963), 9-10.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Dr. Donne and the Booksellers by R. C. Bald</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. Stationers and Publishers From 1624 until his death in 1631 Donne was vicar of St. Dunstan's in the West, and there is a good deal of information about his activities in connection with the parish in the surviving accounts and vestry minutes, which are now preserved in the Guildhall Library in London. 1 To search these records for references to Donne is a rather eerie experience, for by the way the investigator comes upon a number of names familiar in other contexts. At first he is inclined to pay scant attention, for experience has taught him that there were often two, three, or even more individuals of the same name in seventeenth-century London, but at last their cumulative effect forces him to believe that there are limits to coincidence. So he turns aside to do a little checking. Then he soon realizes that there have been no coincidences, and that the John Smethwick and John Jaggard who were elected constables of the parish in 1619 and 1620 were in fact the well-known stationers, and so he goes on to investigate the possibility of a group of other stationers living in the parish. It is well known that St. Paul's Churchyard was the centre of the London bookselling trade because of the concentration of stationers' shops there. St. Dunstan's might well have been called a little St. Paul's because of the number of stationers' shops either in the churchyard or close by. The reason for this is not difficult to discover. Though the present church is an early nineteenth-century edifice, it stands on the same site as the old one, on the north side of Fleet Street close to Temple Bar, between Chancery Lane and Fetter Lane. The Temple itself is on the other side of Fleet Street opposite the church; Clifford's Inn abutted on the north side of the church. Round the corner in Chancery Lane close by were Sergeants' Inn, the Office of the Rolls and, a little further north, Lincoln's Inn. The church of St. Dunstan was, in fact, in the very heart of the legal district of London; not merely were there the senior members of the profession who probably spent more time with law books than with any other kind of reading, but also even larger numbers of young students whose tastes in reading ranged far beyond the law books to which they were supposed to be giving the major part of their attention. There were seven shops on the street side of the church within the actual churchyard, as is shown by an entry in the vestry minutes: The xvi th of ffebruary 1623 [/24]: whereas the Tenants of the shops and shedds in the churchyarde haue this day offered twenty shillings a man (which cometh to sevon pounds) toward the charge of paveing the said Churchyard next the streete . . . Whether all these were stationers' shops it is impossible to say, but there were probably more than seven stationers who had shops in the churchyard or its immediate vicinity. The most important of these were John Smethwick and the two Marriots, John the father and Richard the son. William Jaggard had been in St. Dunstan's churchyard from 1594 to 1608, when he moved to the Barbican, where his son Isaac carried on his printing business after his death. John, his brother (who appears in the records of Donne's time), had his shop at "the Hand and Star in Fleet Street, between the two Temple Gates." As well known as any of these was Matthew Lownes, who carried on his business at "St. Dunstans Churchyard in Fleet Street" from 1591 to 1625. Others, not quite so well known, who also gave St. Dunstan's Churchyard as their address, were Richard Moore, Thomas Dew, Ann Helme, William Washington and George Winder. With some or all of these men Donne must have been acquainted, especially with those that held parish office. Smethwick and John Jaggard were not only elected constables in 1619 but were chosen again in 1621 and 1622 respectively "for the wardmote inquest." Smethwick became junior churchwarden in 1627 and senior churchwarden in the following year. As churchwarden he was entitled to a seat in one of the new pews recently erected in the chancel of the church, and the accounts show that he paid the vicar 6s 8d rent in return for this privilege. 2 Another who held parish office in Donne's time was Richard Moore, elected to the wardmote inquest in 1627, and chosen sidesman and overseer of the poor in April 1631, a few weeks after Donne's death. In addition, Moore was the publisher in 1626 of the second edition of Ignatius his Conclave . He was not, however, the only stationer at St. Dunstan's to publish a book by Donne; Thomas Dewe brought out the 1621 and 1625 editions of the Anniversaries . Thus there were two reminders of his unregenerate days to greet the vicar from the booksellers' stalls when he crossed the churchyard on his way to enter the church. Another name, not that of a stationer but one with literary associations, that occurs frequently in the records of St. Dunstan's at this period is that of Robert Gomersall, who became junior churchwarden in 1626. This is not the author of The Tragedy of Ludovic Sforza , who after leaving the university became a Devonshire parson, but (very probably) his father. The dramatist is known to have been born in London, and the fact that all four of his books were published by John Marriot strongly suggests an association with the parish of St. Dunstan. The elder Gomersall, who became churchwarden and whom Donne must have known, is described as "Citizen and Painter Stainer of London." 3 Less information is available about Donne and the stationers whose shops crowded the churchyard of St. Paul's cathedral, and who dwelt in property owned by the cathedral. A register containing copies of all leases of cathedral lands is extant for the period during which Donne was dean, but it principally reveals the fact that the stationers did not hold the properties they occupied directly from the cathedral authorities, but as sub-tenants. Matthew Lownes secured two leases on 23 June 1625, but as his shop was at St. Dunstan's, he probably expected to sublet, and secured these leases as an investment. On the same day William Legatt secured the lease of a shop belonging to the Almoner's House; whether he was connected in any way with John Legate, the Cambridge printer, is unknown. Similarly, Ann Hebb secured a lease of a shop in Paul's Alley, but it is uncertain whether she was related to Andrew Hebb, the bookseller who had his shop at the Bell in St. Paul's Churchyard from 1625 to 1648. 4 Dewe had not been the original publisher of the book by Donne he had acquired, but it is worth attempting a review of Donne's relations with the booksellers who brought out the original editions of his books. His first published work was Pseudo-Martyr , published at the end of 1609 by Walter Burre; why Donne went to him is not known, but he must have thought him a suitable publisher for the kind of book he brought him. Burre published a fairly wide range of literature; an occasional sermon or work of piety alternated with books of travel, news pamphlets, and even plays. He had been the original publisher of Every Man in his Humour and Cynthia's Revels ; it is conceivable that Donne had heard of him through Jonson, but it can be said at once that the typography of most of the books published by Burre is better than average for its period. Stansby, who printed Pseudo-Martyr , often printed for Burre, and the same two names are found together in the imprint of Ralegh's History of the World . Donne also took his second book, the Latin Conclave Ignati , to Burre; though there is no publisher's name in the imprint, it was Burre who entered the book on 24 January 1610/11 in the Stationers' Register. The entry is unusual in that it records the names of two licensers, Dr. Morton and Dr. Mockett, instead of the usual one. As Greg indicates, Thomas Morton's name appears only twice in the Stationers' Register as licenser, once when he authenticated his own refutation of Theophilus Higgons, and once here. 5 Morton, then, was not one of the regular licensers, but Donne evidently took his manuscript to his friend to read before it went to the official licenser, and Morton must have added some note of approval or recommendation, which was thus recorded in the Stationers' Register. The English version of the book, Ignatius his Conclave , had only a single licenser, the same Dr. Mockett who with Morton licensed the Latin version. The publisher was no longer Burre, but Richard Moore of St. Dunstan's, who also brought out the second edition of 1626. The Anatomy of the World , 1611, and the two Anniversaries , 1612, were not entered on the Stationers' Register, but were both published by Samuel Macham. Sir Geoffrey Keynes is undoubtedly correct in suggesting that the choice of the publisher was due to Joseph Hall, whose writings Macham had been publishing for several years. 6 Hall and Macham both came from Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and they had apparently known one another from boyhood. Hall, it will be recalled, wrote introductory verses for Donne's two poems, and seems to have seen them through the press. The Anatomy of the World was actually published before Donne left England for France with the Drurys, for Mr. A. L. Rowse has recently brought to light the fact that Sir Arthur Throckmorton had acquired a copy by 21 November 1611. 7 Donne, however, had expected to leave earlier, and had therefore apparently entrusted his manuscript to Hall. The manuscript of "The Progress of the Soul" was sent to England from France, and came out in the spring of the following year while Donne was still abroad, for on 14 April Donne, then in Paris, was already replying to criticisms of the book which had reached his ears. The second of the two volumes was certainly seen through the press by Hall, since Donne was not only out of England but, as his letters for the period show, in very uncertain communication with his family and friends. During the years of Donne's ministry his regular publisher was Thomas Jones, whose shop was "in the Strand at the blacke Raven, neere vnto Saint Clements Church." Jones dealt largely in theological literature and lived in the same parish as Donne had lived in before he moved to the Deanery of St. Paul's. Jones's shop was probably the nearest bookshop to Donne's house in Drury lane, and one imagines he often dealt there. Jones published six separate sermons for Donne between 1622 and 1626, and reissued them in various collections as Three Sermons, Foure Sermons , and Five Sermons . The only sermon Donne published in his lifetime that was not brought out by Jones was the Sermon of Commemoration of the Lady Danvers (1627) but, as this little book also contained a collection of Greek and Latin verses in memory of his mother by George Herbert, it was probably he rather than Donne who made arrangements for its publication. Jones, however, was also the publisher of Donne's Devotions , and brought out all three editions (two in 1624 and one in 1626) that appeared in the author's lifetime. The interest of the Marriots in Donne's work did not begin until after Donne's death. There is no doubt that Walton was a friend of both father and son, and that he almost certainly had some part in entrusting to John Marriot the publication of the Poems in 1633. The younger Donne, after he secured control of the publication of his father's remains, was satisfied to stay with the Marriots, so that in succession they brought out the 1634 and later editions of Ignatius his Conclave, LXXX Sermons (1640), Fifty Sermons (1649), Essays in Divinity (1651), and Letters to Severall Persons of Honour (1651). This list includes the great bulk of Donne's surviving writings, and practically everything by which he is remembered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Speed of Publication in the Early Seventeenth Century Donne had a habit, whenever he published anything, of presenting copies not merely to friends but to patrons and other important people from the King downwards. The presentations copies of Pseudo-Martyr given to Lord Chancellor Ellesmere and his old friend Rowland Woodward have survived; his correspondence makes it clear that other copies were presented to the King, Prince Henry, and Sir Robert Cotton's "lord"—presumably the Earl of Northampton. Some of this information is contained in a letter from Donne to Cotton, written from Royston on 24 January [1610], informing him that he has an appointment with the King to present his book that evening (after the day's hunting was over, no doubt), so Cotton may now safety present the copy left with him for his lord. 8 Obviously, the copy presented to the King would be the first copy in circulation, so that in effect one can determine precisely the date of publication of Donne's book. It consists of 54 sheets, and was entered in the Stationers' Register on the previous 2 December. Presumably the interim was occupied by the printing of the work, though whether printing was begun before registration is uncertain. More precise information is afforded by some of Donne's sermons. One knows the date of the delivery of the sermon, the date of the entry in the Stationers' Register, and the date on which a copy was presented. With a letter of 1 December 1622 to Sir Thomas Roe at Constantinople Donne sent copies of two of his sermons, one preached at Paul's Cross on 15 September and the other to the Virginia Company on 13 November. The dates of the presentation of two others ( Encaenia and A Sermon preached at Whitehall ) are derived from the Bridgewater copies in the Huntington Library. The Earl of Bridgewater has written his name on the title pages, followed by "ex dono authoris" and the date. Further examples which provide the same sort of information are to be found in two of Laud's sermons and in the speech he delivered in the Star Chamber at the sentencing of Bastwick, Burton, and Prynne. The principal source here is Laud's Diary , as printed in The History of the Troubles and Tryal of William Laud , 1695. 9 The data are best presented in tabular form. DONNE Delivered Entered S. R. Presented No. of Sheets Sermon on Judges, 20.15 at Paul's Cross 15 Sept. 1622 31 October 1 December 9½ Sermon on Acts, 1.8 to the Virginia Company 13 Nov. 1622 28 November 1 December 10 7 Encaenia 22 May 1623 13 June 20 June 6½ Sermon preached at Whitehall 24 Feb. 1625/26 6 March 12 March 7½ LAUD Sermon at the opening of Parliament 6 Feb. 1625/26 (no entry) 26 February 7 Sermon at Whitehall 5 July 1626 18 July 16 July 7 Speech delivered in the Star Chamber 14 June 1637 1 July 25 June 11½ There was a certain immediate interest in all these pieces, and one realizes that many of these sermons had the same sort of appeal as a pamphlet on one of the more engrossing issues of the day. Donne's Sermon on Judges, 20.15 , preached at Paul's Cross, was a defence of the Directions concerning Preaching which James I had recently issued; Laud's Sermon at the Opening of Parliament was intended (unavailingly) to induce a properly submissive state of mind in the Commons and persuade them that it was their duty to supply the King's financial needs; and his Speech in the Star Chamber was an extreme statement of the royalist point of view. All these pieces were published "by command," usually by royal command; the exceptions were Donne's Sermon to the Virginia Company , and Enaenia , preached at the dedication of the new chapel at Lincoln's Inn. Only in one instance is the date of "command" known; Laud's diary states that it was on 8 July 1626 that the King told him to publish the sermon he had preached three days previously. The letter from Viscount Doncaster conveying the command of James I to Donne to publish his Paul's Cross sermon is extant, 11 but unfortunately it is not dated. James, however, could not be expected to read maunscripts as fast as the official licensers, and Donne's letter to Roe, already cited, mentions that the King still has the sermon (on 1 December) that he had preached on 5 November, the anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot. One suspects, therefore, that a large part of the interval between 15 September and the entry of the Paul's Cross sermon on 31 October 1622 was due to the time it took James to read Donne's manuscript. Charles I heard Donne's sermon at Whitehall and Laud's two sermons, so that in these instances the command came without the necessity of reading any manuscript. In spite of such royal approval the sermons still had to receive the imprimatur of the regular licensers before they could be entered in the Stationers' Register and secure copyright. Whether the licensers conscientiously read through the sermons under such circumstances is another question; nevertheless the securing of their approval must have consumed a certain amount of time, especially when rapid publication was urgent. The one occasion when the regular licenser was dispensed with was in the case of Laud's Speech in the Star Chamber ; as Archbishop of Canterbury, and therefore the supreme authority with licensing power, Laud licensed his own manuscript. The size in sheets of each publication has been given, and it will be noticed that any of the better printers of the period could have produced these pieces, especially if the authorities insisted on their urgency, in the time specified. Laud's Sermon at Whitehall was produced in eight days; it consists of seven sheets, and a sheet a day was within the capacity of two compositors and a single press. Similarly, the Speech in the Star Chamber , consisting of 11½ sheets, was produced in eleven days, perhaps more hastily and with a sense of greater urgency. One comes to realize, however, that the date of entry in the Stationers' Register is not as reliable an index as it was once thought to be. In the examples considered it is always closer to the date of publication than the date of delivery. It is clear that entry could not be made until the licenser had set his hand to the manuscript, and if he were conscientious the time he took to read it must always be reckoned with. On urgent occasions, one would guess, the printer may have taken a chance and gone ahead, provided more than one manuscript was available. Even so, the time taken by the licenser will not explain all the dates of registration in the examples cited. Donne's Virginia Company sermon was entered only three days before publication, and two of Laud's pieces were actually presented to the king before they were entered. We probably have to reckon also with the simple fact that publishers did not enter works immediately they received the licensed copy or began to print it; they waited until it happened to be convenient to drop in at Stationers' Hall and go through the formalities of registration. Some further works remain to be considered, most of them longer than the pieces already discussed. Donne's Pseudo-Martyr has already been mentioned; here only the date of entry and the date of presentation are ascertainable. The work consists of 54 sheets, and it might just have been possible to print it between 2 December (the date of entry) and 24 January (the date of presentation) especially if additional compositors and more than one press were made available for the book. Nevertheless, the copy for the King would no doubt have needed a special binding, which would have consumed a few extra days. Still, Pseudo-Martyr was hardly the kind of book to cause the presses to work overtime, so the entry was probably made when the printing was well along. Walton says that Pseudo-Martyr was written in six weeks; this is possible, but only if the author had already assembled the greater part of his materials. That Donne may have done this in advance is suggested by the fact that, as the "Advertisement to the Reader" makes clear, "the Heads and Grounds handled in this Booke" had been in circulation for some time before the book appeared or, apparently, was even written. Donne had first shown the outlines of his intended argument to a few friends, and then they had been passed on to others. A letter to Sir Henry Goodyere contains the request: "I pray send to my lodging my written books; and if you may stay very long, I pray send that letter in which I sent you certain heads which I purposed to enlarge, for I have them not in any other paper," 12 and this letter to Goodyere seems to have been the kernel from which Pseudo-Martyr grew. Unfortunately, neither the letter asking for the return of the earlier letter nor another written soon afterwards in which Donne reiterated his request is dated. All we have is his statement that "these Heads have beene carried about, many moneths." There are more details available for a longer work by Laud but, as will be seen, they do not satisfactorily answer all the questions a modern enquirer cannot help asking. The work is A Replie to Iesuit Fishers answere to certaine Questions propounded by his most gratious Maisetie King Iames , by Francis White, Dean of Carlisle, to which was annexed A Conference of the right R : B : of St. Davids with the same Iesuit , 1624. On 24 May 1622 Laud had debated with Fisher in the presence of the Duke of Buckingham and his mother. The event is duly noted in his Diary . Then, on 18 September, he received information that "Mr. Fisher had spread certain Copies of the Conference had between him and me, May 24. into divers Hands." Soon afterwards he got a copy of Fisher's report, and "made an Answere to it." Then, during the Christmas season following, Laud was at court, and he reported: I was three times with the King this Christmas ; and Read over to him the the Answere I had made to Fisher ; which he commanded should be Printed; and I desired it might pass in a third Person, under the name of R. B. 13 Then follows a gap of just over a year; the next mention of the work is on 11 Janaury 1624, when Laud notes that he showed the King the prefatory epistle to his book, and that James approved of it. On 4 February he supplies the unusual information that the work was "this day put into the Press: being licensed by the Bishop of London," and on 16 April there is the note that "My Conference with Fisher the Jesuit Printed , came forth." The dates here are apparently precise enough, but the complicating factor is due to Laud's work having been printed as an appendix to White's larger one. The two works have separate signatures and are occasionally found separately, but they were entered in the Stationers' Register together and are usually found together, preceded by a general title page which names them both. One would guess that the long delay between Laud's writing of his reply and his prefatory epistle was caused by White rather than by Laud himself. But when Laud says that his book was "put into the Press" on 4 February one cannot even be certain whether this refers to White's book as well as his, or whether White's was finished and only Laud's part now remained. When he says that his work was licensed by the Bishop of London (and there is, of course, no reason to doubt his word) he makes a statement that is not confirmed by the Stationers' Register. The Bishop of London possessed licensing authority second only to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and his imprimatur was made use of from time to time. When Archbishop Abbot refused to license Montague's Appello Caesarem and Sibthorpe's assize sermon at Northampton the authorities made use of the Bishop of London (George Mountaigne) to get both books into print. Nevertheless, the Stationers' Register entry reads: 14 Aprilis 1624 . . . Master Islip Entred for his Copie vnder the handes of master Doctor Featly and master Doctor Goad and master Bill warden A booke called A Reply to Iesuit Fishers answere to certaine questions propounded by his Maiestie, by Francis White D[ean] of Carleile and a conference of ye B[ishop] of Saint Dauids &amp;c. vjd One would guess that there were two licensers because one approved White's part of the book and another Laud's. But the Bishop of London did not appear in the matter as far as the Stationers were concerned. Finally, it may be noted that the book was not registered until more than two months after it had gone to press, and only two days before publication. If some books such as the Conference with Fisher were not entered until publication was imminent or had already occurred, Donne's Sermon of Commemoration of Lady Danvers was entered at the earliest possible moment. Lady Danvers was buried on 8 June 1627, but because of other engagements Donne was not able to preach the commemoration sermon until 1 July. The sermon was entered "vnder the handes of Master Doctor Worall and both the Wardens" a little less than a week later, on 7 July. The little book also contained a collection of verses to the memory of his mother by George Herbert. It has already been suggested that, since the book was not issued by Donne's usual publisher, the arrangements for publication were probably made by Herbert. It can be further inferred, I think, that, first, Herbert's poems were composed during the weeks between his mother's death and the memorial service at which Donne preached, and secondly, that Donne knew from the beginning that the commemorative volume was planned and that, while he normally preached from notes only, this was one of the occasions (though not by any means the only one) when he wrote out his sermon in full, with the result that he was able to hand it over to the printer as soon as it had been preached. How long the book was in the press is uncertain, since the publication date is not known. The final example, Donne's Devotions , is at once the most spectacular and the most fully documented case. Now that Mr. Shapiro has diagnosed the nature of the illness that gave rise to the Devotions 14 one can speak with a degree of precision not previously possible. Donne's illness, Mr. Shapiro shows, was relapsing fever, a fever that ends by a crisis on the fifth to the seventh day of the fever. Constance Donne was married to Edward Alleyn on 3 December 1623, and we have Alleyn's word for it that the marriage occurred while Donne was ill: "Thus past itt on till the beginning off your sickness and then you desire[d] our maryag showld bee performed with as much sped as might bee." 15 If Donne had not passed, or had only just passed the crisis of his fever by 3 December, he must have fallen ill during the last few days of November. The Devotions were entered in the Stationers' Register on 9 January, presumably after having been scanned by the licenser and, if Donne's correspondence is to be believed, after having been seen by more than one of his friends. There is an undated letter in which Donne enquired of his friend Sir Robert Ker (who was in the service of Prince Charles) whether the Prince would accept the dedication of the book. I have used this leisure to put the Meditations, had in my sickness, into some such order as may minister some holy delight. They arise to so many sheets (perchance twenty) as that, without staying for that furniture of an Epistle, my friends importuned me to print them, I importune my friends to receive them printed. That being in hand, through this long trunk that reaches from St. Paul's to St. James's, I whisper into your ear this question . . . The friends who importuned Donne to print the Devotions and had presumably seen part at least of the manuscript were probably Henry King and Dr. Mountfort, both canons of St. Paul's and in daily touch with Donne. When the letter was written printing had already begun ("That being in hand") although a draft of the dedication in manuscript was enclosed with the letter to Ker, since Donne requests him to "cast your eye upon the title and the epistle, and rectify me in them." Yet, in spite of all this activity, Donne opens his letter by declaring, "Though I have left my bed, I have not left my bedside. I sit there still, and as a prisoner discharged sits at the prison door to beg fees, so sit I here to gather crumbs." 16 On 1 February Donne was able to send a presentation copy to the Queen of Bohemia enclosed in a dated letter to one of her ladies, who was to hand it to her. 17 The book turned out to be larger than Donne anticipated, as it consists of 27 sheets, and thus would have taken about a month to pass through the press. If we assume that the book was in the printer's hands for the whole of January, we must then assume that the book was written during December. Yet this forces us to believe that the book was written in only a few weeks by a man who had very nearly died, whose body was weak and exhausted by his illness, and who was in the early stages of a long and slow convalescence. 18 Even when the book was in the press, he was barely able to sit up in a chair in his bedroom, but had been unable as yet to leave it. For the circumstances of its composition Donne's Devotions can have few, if any, parallels in the annals of literature.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Bibliographical Account of The Gentleman's Magazine , 1731-1754 by William B. Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Excepting the several numbers examined by Professor Leed only last year in these Studies (XVII, 210-214), the bibliographical history of the Gentleman's Magazine is entirely conjectural, with all editions undefined, early printings unlocated, piracies and counterfeits undetected and—excepting again the work of a few Johnsonians—all textual revision completely unnoticed. The matter last mentioned obviously depends upon a determination of those preceding and may therefore await a later report. Of primary concern now is the citation of data which will assist readers not only in identifying the significant variants which have come to my attention but in spotting others as yet unseen. For this purpose the report is limited to volumes originally printed during the term of Cave's proprietorship, a period extending just short of the date when Johnson withdrew his services but, I believe, just beyond the time when conditions later necessitated some resetting. Within this range there are 24 annual volumes, comprising 312 separate numbers, 1 some printed at least nine times, all occurring in states differing in every set, and many thereafter confused in mixtures of several sets. Short of providing a facsimile of the whole series, together with a description of equal length, the only practicable means of dealing with these infinitely varied combinations is first by a general survey of the problem, then by three groups of tables, each with an appropriate commentary. The problem is immediately apparent in the first number. Of the original January 1731 title, described the upper part by Carlson, 2 the lower by Nichols, 3 there are presumably three essential features: (a) a peculiar subtitle "Trader's Monthly Intelligencer"; (b) an original cut of St. John's Gate; (c) an imprint reading "Printed for the Author; and sold at St. John's Gate; by F. Jefferies, in Ludgate-street; and all other Booksellers, and by the Persons who serve Gentlemen with the Newspapers." The fact is that no two of these particulars can be found together in any 18th-century publication. Subtitle (a), said to occur in the first number only, appears seventeen times: in the original edition of the first eight numbers, in eight early reprints of numbers 1-6, and in the first setting of the general title for the entire volume. Woodcut (b), not represented in any of the editions just cited, if considered in relation to the imprint, is either the third or fourth in a series of eight, all used for original and many again for reprinted work. Imprint (c) is fifteenth in a series of twenty-four and, in this form, occurs not before August 1733 in an original edition, and thus not before the same date in a "fifth edition" of the earliest number. Hence it may be surmised that Francis Jefferies, instead of being the earliest collaborator in Cave's enterprise, ranks after eight booksellers previously recorded (imprints 1-6, Table III) and along with fifteen others who now and then join him (imprints 7-14) in various arrangements prior to the one specified in the August 1733 printing. Even so, it is comforting to realize that Nichols was here citing as first what may be duly certified as an authentic fifth edition, and not a counterfeit of this (with earlier woodblock but later imprint, issued ca. 1753), nor a legitimate sixth (issued earlier than the spurious fifth, ca. 1742), nor a counterfeit of that (with identical imprint but issued, apparently, ca. 1786), nor at last a mongrelized type-facsimile of the first edition, reproducing the original 1731 subtitle, a block-style appropriate for 1732, but honestly dated 1806. Evidently if this Magazine represents "an epoch in the Literary History" of England, 4 the first chapter has yet to be written. For what has already been reported some extenuation is now in order. No doubt Mr. Carlson, the more recent authority, eventually discovered that among the eighteen libraries mentioned in his preface not one contained any edition of the original number earlier than the fourth—not even such venerable institutions as Harvard, Yale, the British Museum or the Bodleian—and thus, it seems, came to rely on the 1806 fabrication (the only one combining the a and b features) which he perhaps examined either in the reading room at Yale or in the Douce Collection at the Bodleian. For John Nichols, writing as the proprietor of the Magazine in 1821, there was somewhat less excuse, since he was probably well aware that his own file copy represented a late substitute for volumes previously destroyed, some in the fire of 7 May 1786, others in the holocaust of 8 February 1808. 5 After the latter date the only copy readily available was the two-volume "facsimile" souvenir issued by another publisher in 1806; but even this appears to have had a very short existence, for on 27 May 1809 the printer, Joseph Smeeton, and his wife, together with all their worldly goods, were "entirely consumed" in flames. 6 In 1837 an original edition of these two volumes was reported in the Dresden Library; 7 yet that too, presumably, disappeared in the conflagration of 13-15 February 1945. No wonder, then, that the "first chapter" of this history is still unwritten: the whole matter is highly combustible. Nonetheless a few copies of the earlier issues have recently been identified, and from these and others we may now speculate on such general topics as original conditions of sale, factors affecting reissue, size of total issue, and present state of the volumes examined. When the Magazine was first issued, at 6 d in blue wrappers, 8 its sale at once and for months to come exceeded all expectations. Notices below original imprints announce in March 1731 a second edition of the first number, in May a reprinting of the two earliest numbers, and in July a reprinting now through five numbers. Thereafter all numbers remained available until November 1733, when it was reported that those for 1731 "are reprinting some of them the Fourth time"—a statement immediately amended in December to "the Fifth time." 9 Meanwhile the February 1732 imprint advertised a few copies "printed on fine Royal Paper, large margin , for the Curious, at 1 s each Month." This issue, offered first in marbled wrappers, 10 was also reprinted at least once, 11 apparently without further notice to that effect. Thus far, through 1733, the original settings appear not to have been held for any later reprint, and the increasing demand for back numbers thus necessitated, at frequent intervals, ever larger issues of new editions. However closely these may resemble original printings, the later editions can easily be differentiated and their occurrence tabulated as follows: Volume date 1731 1732 1733 1734 First editions 12 12 13 13 Regularly numbered reprints 29 12 2 1 Counterfeits without edition label 24 14 -- -- Counterfeits with edition label 4 3 8 1 ---- ---- ---- ---- Totals: 69 41 23 15 After 1733, apparently, the issue of the original edition had been so considerably expanded that later settings were required only occasionally, and then long after the initial printing. Along with this steady expansion it becomes evident, however, both from press figures and headlines, that type is now being retained, perhaps for two or three months at a time, and reimpressed as often as necessary for any number in sudden demand. An "increased and unexpected demand of 3,000 Magazines monthly" is remarked in the Preface to the 1746 volume, where defaulting booksellers were excused on the grounds that "since several months of this year being twice entirely sold, they were obliged to wait for further impressions, which could not be so speedily worked off, as might be desired, several former months being at the same time in the press, in order to make compleat sets." The occasion here, of course, was the rebellion of '45, now at St. John's Gate resulting in a number of undifferentiated impressions, with some of them partially revised and reset to up-date the historical chronicle. As there was no other event of comparable interest throughout the remainder of the century—or none which a larger press could not handle—I rather suspect that, while some reimpression may continue, this is the last occasion for any major disturbance in the text. For an estimate as to the size of the earlier editions Cave provides in the number for November 1734 (p. 620) a single clue, this in a fine-print notice to a disappointed contributor that "our Time is limited, and every page in our Bo6k [ sic ] is a Guinea Charge to us." At that rate the total issue of each 1734 number must have approximated 9000 copies, 12 a count somewhat more, we may presume, 13 than the combined total of all smaller editions (1-5) of the first number issued before that time. Hence, judging by the number and ratio of copies known to me, the extent of these earlier editions may have been about as follows: 14 Edition: 1 2 3 4 5 Copies: 3 16 7 28 30 Issue: 250 1250 500 2250 2500 If the issue was some 9000 in 1734 it may well have reached 10,000 several years later (when Johnson began to edit the "Debates") and in the period July 1741-March 1744 (when he was the sole author of this section) gradually increased to 15,000. 15 Thereafter, as already noted, alarums to the north possibly extended it, temporarily, several thousand more or, if all these earlier estimates are correct, to 18,000. Such a figure, or any other approaching it, would explain why, after so many incendiary events of later time, perhaps a thousand sets are still extant; and why again, in relation to the very small beginning, the earliest editions of the earlier numbers are practically non-existent. The mere presence of a set, however, is no guarantee of its condition. Though Cave regarded the wrappers as only temporary ( GM , 1738, p. ii), he did consider the monthly title, with all its supplementary information, as an essential leaf " which the Binder is therefore by no means to throw away " (1735, p. [786]). Ten years later he was still repeating this injunction (1745, p. [728]), but all to little purpose, for many copies are without these leaves, and some indeed without annual titles as well. Even more distressing is the pillage of inserted illustrations. For these expensive attractions Cave proceeded very cautiously, venturing at first only a single engraving in the volume for 1735 (facing p. 661), another for 1736 (p. 733) and two folding maps for 1739 (pp. 4, [55]). Then, encouraged no doubt by a favorable response to these efforts, he (or his son) offered five more maps in 1740 (pp. [3], 242, 350, 359, 659), thereafter issued plates for almost every number, and for awhile (June 1752-July 1755) even lavished upon his delighted readers a series of colored illustrations. Yet, excepting the copy later identified as "C", all the sets I have examined now exhibit only remnants of this grand array. Most often the damage was done, I suspect, by the earliest owners, and done so effectively that Samuel Ayscough in his general index of 1789 (reprinted without alteration in 1818) listed only about half the illustrations and, among the colored ones, only two of the seventeen originally included. Possibly it was at his suggestion that, from 1789 onward, the annual volumes, instead of providing occasional "directions" to the binders, regularly incorporate in their own indexes a list of these inserts, and thus preserve a record lost in former years. However delapidated, the volumes still serve to exemplify the bibliographical record, and to this we may now direct our attention. The commentary is in three parts applicable (1) to all variants and data presented in Tables I-III, (2) to the numbers for 1731-1733 and relevant Tables IV-V, (3) to the numbers for 1734-1754 and accompanying Table VI.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tables I-III: General Information Table I (Register of Copies) lists in nine groups the 175 sets examined or reported. 16 Of these the last two groups, one of series commencing with the two-volume 1806 facsimile edition, the other of indeterminate sets, are not further considered. Each of the seven earlier groups is headed by several copies, labelled A through P, which appear to be of a typical unmixed sequence and therefore serve to represent the issue in later analyses. 17 The "Q" also listed is a strangely atypical combination, apparently of sheets mixed within certain numbers. 18 Collation has extended, for "A" and "B" first edition sets through 1731, 19 for others not readily accessible through 1734, but for control copy "C" and others immediately available through 1754. 20 Table II (Order of Woodcuts) records, whenever possible by some mnemonic reference, a succession of eight title-blocks (b-i) employed in original editions from September 1731 through June 1790. Of those re-used, sometimes after a considerable interval, for the reprinting of earlier numbers, the one to be especially noted is the defective wheelbarrow variant (h 2 ), a twice-broken cut occurring in original editions of 1781-1782 before it was diverted to variously labelled 1731-1733 reprints issued, I suspect, about 1786. 21 As sets issued at that late date (N-Q) are all made up of various sheets old and new, certain of the newly prepared material—particularly of gatherings within a number—may have escaped notice. In any event, even if not betrayed by cut (h 2 ), these sheets may be identified by paper of a bluish cast, a variety first used in the Magazine for October 1778. Table III (Order of Imprints) lists the 24 various readings appearing through February 1760 and occasionally reappearing, though no longer applicable, in the reprinting of earlier numbers. Any such recurrence, however, may be exposed by woodblocks of a kind or state postdating original issue. Thus certain imprints appropriate only for 1731-1732 editions (6B, 7A, 9A) accompany a cut (h 2 ) which, as already noted, does not appear until fifty years later.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Tables IV-V: Analysis of Numbers 1731-1733 Within the first several years the variation is of such complexity that it is expedient to consider separately two kinds of evidence. Accordingly the tables pertain, IV to issue-sequences immediately recognized by title-points, V to supplementary data identifying the state of numbers now lacking titles. Table IV successively records, for each number, three features of the title: 1. A blank for original edition, a hyphen for an unlabelled reprint, a "2", "3" or "N" etc. for "Second", "Third", "New" or other edition so identified. 2. Within parentheses, a letter indicating the woodblock (as described in Table II), together with a superscript figure for cuts in later state. 3. After parentheses, a number identifying the imprint (as defined in Table III), together with a letter for variant states and, when this is given, a subscript figure representing the number of volumes cited, in the imprint, as then available. Among these varying features the imprint alone may indicate earliest dates of issue. Thus, in the absence (a) of a woodblock, it would appear that imprint 3, used originally from March to May 1731, establishes within that period the issue of second editions similarly imprinted. So also imprint 5, in July-August 1731, determines the issue of second and third editions of identical reading. Once the earliest block (b) appears, two criteria are available, and time of issue therefore established, usually, by the conjunction of these two. Hence the fourth edition earliest number could not have appeared before February 1732 since the cut (b), though extending from September 1731 to April 1732, is not associated with imprint 9 before February. Upon the juncture of two or more points, however, any discrepant factor must necessarily fix the date. Thus while the two "fifth" editions earliest number would seem to be of the sequence (d)-(e), displaying in order the "dog" (1732) and "equestrian" (1733) block, this order is reversed by imprint sequence 15 and 22, occurring respectively in 1733 and 1753. Thus again the counterfeit "sixth" edition, though also seemingly of the year 1742 (when 11 volumes were available), and also bearing imprint 20 (one appropriate to that time), is betrayed by its woodcut (h 2 ) as of an issue not appearing in any original edition before 1781—and, as already suggested (note 21), not evident in any reprinting before 1786. In checking the variants of a certain number it will be noted that, excepting the first two, the "edition" sequence, if any, is quite disorderly. For July 1731 early accumulated sets exhibit three different "first" editions: A-F the original setting (a) 5; G-H a second setting -(b)9, prepared apparently about the same time as the G-H fourth edition first number [4(b)9]; and I-J a third setting -(e) 17, issued it would seem about a year after I-J fifth edition first number [5 (e) 15]. Then in K-P comes a typographical arrangement appropriate only for 1746 [(e 1 ) 20 15 ], now in the July reprint improperly labelled "fifth" edition; in February, however, correctly described as "sixth" edition; but then, when used three years later for an August number [-(e 1 ) 20 18 ], passed off as another "first" edition—here as the second of three "firsts" following an actual second edition. Apparently in some instances the reprint arrangement is that of the title then being used for first editions; in others, an imitation of the copy now being reprinted; in others still, a combination arbitrarily devised. Since these irregularities diminish with each passing year, it is convenient to reduce the 16 copy-sequences, in 1732 to 7, in 1733 to 4, and in later years (as noted Table VI) to 1. Throughout, however, notes have been appended to signify other peculiarities either in form or setting.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Table V: Text Points 1731-1733 The edition of copies lacking titles is here determined by the position of signature letter in the first (and, if necessary, the second) signed gathering. For each number this account records, in order, a page reference (which, however, may be applicable only to original setting); citation of several copies already identified by title, or by the present means, in Table IV; notice in italics, by caret, or by punctuation mark, of the point in text above initial letter of the signature.

      <field name="fulltext">Table VI: Analysis of Numbers 1734-1754 In the first three years both woodblock and imprint went through numerous changes (a-e for the one, 1-16 for the other), all disclosing in one combination or another a number of variants easily classified and ordered. Over the next twenty-one years, however, these features change much less frequently (d-f, 17-24), and any one combination may persist for a considerable period: (d) 19, for example, extending over 25 months without interruption, and (e 1 ) 21 lasting once for 17 and once again for 26 months. As these points become stabilized it is therefore necessary to introduce new variables, these preferably of a kind exhibiting, in editions now of greatly enlarged issue, reimpressions from standing type. Whatever its extent, no list of points will encompass every contingency. Press-figures, the most convenient index, have occurred only once before, in May 1732, and then as a single asterisk dropped in the course of printing. Figures again appear several times in 1734, there signifying all sorts of confusion, 22 but then disappear forever. Broken headline types, cited last year by Mr. Leed to differentiate certain 1742 variants, provide no clue as to the order of printing and—as I have already determined—fail to distinguish the revised impressions of 1745-1746. Certain other evidence, though also ineffective for rapid reimpressions of the 1745-1746 type, does provide, usually, a ready means for ordering the variants. Apart from the two points now considered (woodblock and imprint), this may be discovered in three other features: (3) last entry to left of woodblock, ordinarily recording the most recent periodical issued in London; (4) last entry to right of woodblock, noting papers—but not by name—printed elsewhere; (5) ornamental block heading first page of text, hereafter identified by central figure. With some exceptions all five points remain in a certain combination, or in a typographical skeleton, only from one to three monthly numbers. 23 Hence original editions set within that particular skeleton will establish the date of reprints similarly enclosed. A resetting precisely defined by these means appears in the January 1741 number: Points 1-2 3 4 5 (d)20 10 Englishman Sherborn head [Copy C] (e)20 11 Champion Sherborn cherub [Copy G] The later edition, citing 11 volumes available, indicates an issue in 1742 (1731+11), and reference to The Champion further limits the issue to May or June of that year. The several 1742 variants identified by Mr Leed are also susceptible to this approach. These are listed in his sequence, but with key letters reordered, if necessary, to account for the point latest occurring in the combination (signified by an asterisk) and the date of that occurrence (entered to the right). January 1742 (three editions) A. (e)20 11 Hyp Doctor Sherborn sun C. * (e 1 )20 Whitehall Ev Post Cambridge vase [April 1746] B. (e)20 11 *Champion Sherborn cherub [May 1742] Edition "B," it will be noted, displays the same combination as that used in the later edition of January 1741. Edition "C", though representing elements all occurring as early as April 1746, doubtless was not printed until 1747, for it still mistakenly carries, in the skeleton first page of text, a reference to that year. February 1742 (one edition partially reimpressed 24 and, as now determined, a second setting) A1-2. (e)20 11 Hyp Doctor Sherborn sun B. (e 2 )20 11 *World Glasgow rose [Jan. 1753] Though edition "B" again cites 11 volumes as then available, the reference now merely imitates the earlier imprint proper to 1742. The woodblock also is the same, though here deteriorated to state 2, first evident in December 1751. At this later date entry to right of block is invariant (Glasgow being represented from September 1749 to January 1767), but the one to left, The World , occurs only from January to October 1753 and thus among these points becomes the limiting factor. Less significant but still differentiated are the two numbers next cited. March 1742 (one edition twice partly reimpressed 25 ) A1. (e)20 11 Hyp Doctor Sherborn sun A2-3. (e)20 11 Hyp Doctor Sherborn *cherub [April 1742] October 1742 (one edition reimpressed) A1. (e)20 11 Westminster Journal Sherburn sun A2. (e)20 11 Westminster Journal *Birmingham sun [November 1742] Not to be distinguished by either means, Mr. Leed's or my own, are two other numbers in 1742. Here the first signed pages (401 and 457) have as further references in direction line: August [1] none [2] ( August 1742) September [1] ( August 1742.) [2] September 1742.) To discover these, and perhaps other variants of greater consequence, one must resort to direct collation. For certain numbers in 1734-1736 the several variables occasionally reveal, in the two leaves to which they apply, a duplicate setting simultaneously printed of these leaves only . This situation may arise whenever, in half-sheet imposition, there is an extra two-leaf fold which, if unduplicated, would occupy only half a forme. Thus in the three successive 1734 collations given below an alternate setting should not be expected in August (with two doubletons, probably imposed together), but may be found both in September 26 (with three) and in October 27 (with only one). August September October π 2 3D-3H 4 3I-3K 4 π 2 3L 2 3M 4 3N 2 3O-3S 4 3T 2 3U-3Z 4 3A-3C 4 For these and other monthly numbers with duplicate preliminaries (and hence differing woodblocks, letterpress, and ornaments), I list first the points in control copy "C". 28 Entry to right of block, invariably Barbados throughout this series, is omitted. 1734 September (e)17 York 2 News bowl (d)16 Gen.

Gazetteer head In Supplements, where the only point is the ornament above caption title first page of text, this point alone will suffice, for no ornament can be used more than once in a duplicate setting. Thus the Supplement for 1750 exhibits in C and P copies respectively, a head and urn. At first glance it would appear that this number, like the one for August 1734, is not subject to duplication, since there are two quarter-sheets 32 which could be combined: 1 2 2-3 4 4 2 5-6 4 . However, it must be remembered that the annual title and preface fold is printed with this extra number, and was here doubtless imposed with gathering 4, leaving 1 as an odd doubleton to be set twice. With due reference to the several matters cited above, the following Table denotes, throughout by the symbol τ, some thirty-seven variants from the main impression as represented by "C" and equivalent copies. Among other variants yet undisclosed an appreciable number, I suspect, may be identified and ordered by the criteria now established.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Apart from the 288 monthly numbers (1731-1754) some copies have, after July 1735, a "Magazine Extraordinary" and, beginning with the 1733 volume, all include—or should include—an annual "Supplement." Another special number on Baronets Arms, cumulating in parts from 1750, is noted in Table VI under entry for 1754, the year it was completed. 2 C. Lennart Carlson, The First Magazine (1938), p. 13. 3 John Nichols, "Preface" to General Index to the Gentleman's Magazine (1821), III, v-vi. 4 Andrew Kippis, as cited in Carlson, p. [v]. 5 Nichols, pp. lxvi, lxxiii. The earlier fire, as reported in GM (May 1786, p. 437), levelled the house of Mrs. Elizabeth Newbery, whose name thus is omitted in the imprints to the general titles for this year. The later disaster reduced to ashes Nichols' own printing-office, all of his extensive warehouses, and with these "the Entire Stock of the Gentleman's Magazine from 1782 to 1807" ( GM , February 1808, p. 99). 6 GM , May 1809, pp. 474, 486. Smeeton was then 50, his wife Elizabeth only 25, and the two of them married just three months before. The 1806 edition, printed for Machell Stace, reproduces on titles two different woodcuts, the one to be identified as (b) in the numbers for January-April 1731, January-June 1732, and the other described as (h) in the numbers for May-December 1731, July-December 1732. As this division would indicate, the printing was split, the first part of each volume representing the work of Smeeton (whose imprint appears on the two general titles), the second part the labor of W. Smith (imprint on last page of the indexes). 7 F. A. Ebert, A General Bibliographical Dictionary (1837), II, 635. 8 The price is given in the imprint for all the earlier editions. The only copy I have seen in wrappers is the number for June 1752 at the Boston Public Library (*7227.16). 9 In Table IV it will be noted that the typographical state of an original edition later number establishes the same chronology of later variants first number: 2d ed. in March, 3d ed. in July, 4th ed. (not cited in these announcements) about February 1732, and 5th ed.—the reprinting for the "fourth time"—not before August 1733. As for the "fifth time," the reference perhaps is to some resetting, as indicated first note to the Table. 10 These wrappers, not seen, are mentioned in the preliminary notices, verso of titles for November and December 1731. 11 Like the regular issue of February 1732 (see note 9), the first number original large paper issue is labelled "Fourth Edition." In the only specimen seen of this, the Texas-Griffith copy (G), the chainlines are 30mm. apart as against 26mm. for ordinary paper. The later large paper issue, bearing "Sixth Edition" label, is known to me only by a cut-down specimen, the Yale-Lewis copy (L). In volumes I-IV this is appreciably thicker than ordinary paper issue, bulking 39, 45, 50, 53mm. 12 This estimate derives from various prices entered for other but similar work in Strahan's printing ledger. In 1734 the Magazine was normally issued in seven half-sheets, or 56 pages a number. For 3½ full sheets, &amp;c.mmat; 1000 copies, the basic cost would therefore be about 18 s. 4 d. for composing and reading, 9 s. 4 d for presswork, £4-16-0 for 14 reams of paper, £1 for stitching, 2 s. 6 d for wrappers. Retaining the first figure as a constant, and multiplying the others by 9, gives a total £58-8-10 for 9000 copies, or slightly less than a guinea a page. 13 More because the new subscribers of 1732-1734, besides outnumbering the dropouts, would many of them have little interest in back numbers, or any reprints of these. 14 This count is less the three certain and two suspected "Fifth Edition" copies printed later for E. Cave. The "Sixth" editions (30 and 7 copies), as well as the 1806 facsimile (18), are also, of course, of later date. 15 Boswell's Life of Johnson , ed. G. B. Hill and L. F. Powell (1934), I, 112, n.1; 152, n.1. The first reference also indicates that the fifth edition came out in the ninth year, or 1740. The first number so labelled, however, is of a typographical state appearing only between August and October 1733. 16 The reports, limited to a description of the January 1731 title, come from an extended postal campaign undertaken to discover the whereabouts of any first edition copies. The three specimens eventually disclosed are described in note 19. 17 It is of course impractical to take into account widely variant mixtures as these may occur (1) from number to number, in later replacements before binding, or (2) from volume to volume, in sets made up from different bound collections. The PPL-R copy illustrates both conditions: 1731 consists of February-December numbers in first edition (sequence A-B) but January of a sixth (L-M); 1732 volume is of still another order, corresponding throughout to sequence J. 18 Though also issued, like N-P, about 1786, series Q does not conform even to this irregular pattern, exhibiting in the following numbers a mixture of settings appropriate to the copies identified. 1731 1732 1733 Title gathering: Jan Feb Mar May July Aug Sep May July Feb Mar N-P G-H G-I G-H G-H G-H G,I L-M CDF CM N 1st signed gathering: I-J I-J J-K I-K I-J I-K J-K J L-M L,N L Points for first signed gathering are recorded in Table V. 19 Set "A," at North Texas State University, is the only one displaying both a first edition of the original number and the earlier issue of the second number. This copy, now in modern library buckram, is of unknown provenance. Set "B," at Syracuse University, New York, is in 18th-century binding and bears on front endpaper, first volume, a pencilled note "The Gentlemans Magazine belonging to Thomas Gellman August 13 in the year 1762." The third set, at Smith College, Massachusetts, was purchased by James Bain 22 March 1881. An accompanying note indicates, however, that volumes 1 (1731) and 42 n.s. (1854, July-December) were supplied at a later time, and presumably from another source. 20 Copy "C," in my possession, apart from representing (as previously remarked) a complete set of illustrations, has stabholes throughout as evidence of a monthly accumulation, the first two numbers of a second edition, the third and all later numbers apparently of the first impression or edition. This is also, so far as I am aware, the only set not once but doubly certified as of an unbroken and unmixed sequence extending from the 18th century. The first owner of record was Charles Wigan of Stanford, Middlesex, who on 3 April 1776 purchased the 45 volumes already cumulated and signed the first page of text in every volume then and thereafter completed to the time of his death 23 May 1802 ( GM , p. 586). Apparently the set was then bequeathed to a granddaughter Mary Wigan who, on 29 September 1803, also signed and with few exceptions dated the whole series, all this it would seem with the intent of establishing the collection as a dowry offered at the time of her marriage 8 October to George Daniel Harvey ( GM , 1803, p. 1252), a barrister-at-law and commissioner of bankruptcy. Harvey then affixed his bookplate to the first volume only and maintained the subscription to 1810, about the time of his death. Compared throughout against "C" are sets G, the I-K specimen at Texas, M, and P. 21 Nichols' recollection (pp. lix, lxii) that 100 sets were perfected in 1783 would appear to be confirmed by his Magazine preface dated 22 January 1783 (in the 1782 volume): "On the First of February next will begin to be republished in Monthly Volumes (Price Six Shillings and Six Pence each Volume, neatly sewed in Boards), the Gentleman's Magazine from . . . M.DCC. XXX [ sic ] to M.DCC.LXXX. with an Index complete." Apart from the 100 he intended to perfect it was also noted, in a postscript, that "a Few will be printed over, to perfect the Sets of former Purchasers." However, Nichols seems to have forgotten the subsequent delay curiously excused in 1786 (p. vi of preface to 1785 volume): "The Perfidy of knavish Servants, who stole, and sold for Waste Paper, what will cost much Time and Expence to prepare again for the Public, has unavoidably occasioned a longer Interruption than we could possibly foresee." Thus the (h 2 ) reprints could not have been issued before 1786 and may have been further delayed to 1789, the date the Index finally appeared. 22 January : gathering B, 7 none or 1; C, none or 15-1 or 18-1; D-E, invariably 24-1, 39-1. Half-sheet C, when figured, has pages 13-14 reset, with catchword "no" now first introduced. February : 15 combinations so far observed with none or one or other of these figures: 66-6 or 9, 74-6 or 2, 75-6, 82-2 or 3, 90-2 or 3 or 9, 110-3, 3 reversed, or 9. December : mostly invariant, title-3, 641-τ, 660-τ or none , 668-τ or ¶ or none . 23 There are twelve periods still ranging from four to six months: May-August 1736, June-December 1737, September-December 1738, July-December 1739, March-June 1740, June-September 1744, February-June 1745, September-December 1746, March-July and August-December 1750, January-July 1752, May-October 1753. In the present analysis several variants issued within these intervals may therefore go undetected. 24 Now evident, as Mr. Leed notes, in headline breakage first several gatherings and also, it might be added, by the position p. 61 of gathering number 1 (A1) below and after of , (A2) below i of Difference . 25 Between A2-3 Mr Leed notes in head-lines only one broken T , (A2) at p. 144, (A3) at p. 148. 26 Some copies of the September number have second doublet inserted within the first. Perhaps to obviate such disarrangements the GM , beginning with this number, carries for each issue a separate sequence of gathering numbers. 27 In October only, the fold is signed on 2d leaf, and in both settings, Ttt appearing, in one (d) 16 under and to the left of H in Hence , in the other (e) 17 under a of any . 28 Unlike the reimpressions or resettings previously considered, where the later variant (as a limited supplementary issue) appears only once or twice in a score of copies, an alternate setting will occur in about every other specimen and, through a sequence of numbers, in various combinations. As it happens, copies C and N regularly alternate between (e) and (d) settings. The reverse alternation, also coincidental, is exhibited for 1734 in copies E, L, P, for 1735-1736 in copy G. 29 "Pramsteer", though possibly representing (like certain others in these lists) a periodical no longer extant, is more likely to be a misreading of, or punning allusion to the paper correctly spelled in alternate title. 30 The warning applicable everywhere, and implicit in an earlier note (18), may here be registered against sophisticated copies. The TxU set now has titles affixed to leaves once conjugate to the alternate, September (d) 17 to 'vase' and November (d) 18 to 'vase'. 31 Copy G, (d) 18 variant, is also reimpressed in first half-sheet, p. 629 gathering number 1 originally below g in general , here to left of g . 32 As several signatures are omitted, I now cite the gathering number register. * Signature lacking; position of gathering number. † Other points: 1734 .

      <field name="heading_text">Tennyson's The Lover's Tale , R. H. Shepherd, and T. J. Wise by W. D. Paden</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In one of the more puzzling portions of his Bibliography of Tennyson , 1 T. J. Wise asserted that Richard Herne Shepherd had caused to be printed and distributed, in 1870 and 1875, no less than six separate piratical editions of The Lover's Tale . Carter and Pollard proved that what Wise called the "First Pirated Edition" was produced after 1880, and showed that there was no evidence to connect it with Shepherd. 2 The present paper argues that what Wise called the "Second Pirated Edition," though such an edition was produced by Shepherd, has heretofore been misdescribed; that something produced by Shepherd is represented by what Wise called the "Third Pirated Edition"; but that the last three of Wise's six editions must be dismissed as imaginary. In somewhat distant relation to his account of the Tale , Wise described The New Timon (1876) as another piracy by Shepherd; the present essay attempts to show that this pamphlet was in fact a forgery produced about 1898, three years after Shepherd's death</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Some of the facts related to Shepherd's production of piracies of Tennyson's Lover's Tale have long been known, but the whole story has never been told. For the purposes of this essay the story must be given in exact detail from the documents connected with the poet's chancery suit, of 1875-1876, to stop the piracy. One publication dated 1870 must be examined in the light thrown by the documents; and similarly, several publications dated 1875; and also a publication dated 1876. As the exposition will be burdened with a multitude of details of widely varying kinds, the reader must be so courteous as to accept a somewhat artificial arrangement, designed to present together the documentary and bibliographic evidence concerning the publications of each particular year, in turn, in the order of time. Specifically, the events of 1870 will be presented by passages drawn from legal documents of the year 1875, and this will be done a number of pages before the chancery suit and its connected documents are themselves fully exhibited. The entire affair will be more easily comprehended if the exposition is preceded by a history of the poem, The Lover's Tale , prior to July 1870. According to Tennyson's own statement, he wrote The Lover's Tale in his nineteenth year, that is, in 1827-1828. In 1832 he included the poem in the manuscript for his second volume of verse, to be published by Edward Moxon. 3 At the last moment he became convinced that the Tale was too full of faults for publication, and directed Moxon to omit it from his volume. Seventy-five years later Wise quoted 4 a letter written by Arthur Hallam in 1833 to the effect that, subsequent to his decision, Tennyson caused six copies of the poem to be printed at his own expense, and directed that these be placed in Hallam's hands for distribution among their college friends. 5 Though the letter is otherwise unknown, one may perhaps venture to accept the quotation as genuine; but one must add that it is rather more than probable that Moxon, who was generous with his authors, sent several additional copies to the poet at Somersby. The known examples, though they were issued in brown paper wrappers, are not mere proofs or offprints, for in them the poem is provided with a formal titlepage bearing Moxon's name and the date 1833, on the first leaf of the first gathering. That Tennyson himself received some copies from the publisher seems to be indicated by the fact that, though there is no particular reason to suppose any of his Cambridge friends ever returned their copies, he was able to present examples to at least two men with whom he became intimate considerably later than 1833, namely, John Forster and William Ewart Gladstone. The copy which the poet presented to John Forster is of particular interest. Forster gave it to Robert Browning, who lent it to Thomas Powell. The last gentleman probably sold it before the time in 1849 when he fled from the accumulating consequences of his dishonesty to New York, 6 for though he mentioned Tennyson's youthful poem in his Living Authors of England (N.Y., 1849), he haughtily declined to quote from it (p. 41: "it is decidedly unworthy of his reputation"). On 16 June 1870 the copy was sold in London by Sotheby, Wilkinson, and Hodge, as item 493 in "the Library of a Gentleman Deceased," to Basil Montague Pickering, the bookseller and publisher. This was the first time the Tale had emerged from the seclusion of private ownership; before then its existence had been only vaguely known. In the Fortnightly Review of October 1865 (II, 393) the Hon. J. Leicester Warren had remarked, after a discussion of Poems Chiefly Lyrical (1830), "It is worth noticing that a poem entitled A Lover's Story [sic] was about this time privately printed. Only a few copies were issued. I know not if any are still in existence." And R. H. Shepherd, a devoted student of the Laureate's work, therefore had tentatively listed A Lover's Story among "Poems attributed to Tennyson" in his Tennysoniana (London: Pickering, 1866; p. 158). Now the public sale of a copy caused a minor stir of publicity, of which one bit may be quoted from the Athenaeum of 2 July 1870 (p. 19): A LOST CHANCE.—A copy of the rarest of Mr. Tennyson's works, The Lover's Tale , written when he was eighteen years old, and published, with a half-apologizing Preface in 1833, was sold a fortnight ago at Sotheby's, in one volume with the Laureate's scarce Poems, Chiefly Lyrical , 1830, and Poems , 1833, and fetched £4 12s. The Lover's Tale is not in the British Museum, and the authorities let Mr. B. M. Pickering buy it away from them, doubtless for the author of Tennysoniana , which contains no notice of the poem. No scholar who has worked on literary periodicals will have much doubt as to the source of the squib; it came, in all probability, from the author of Tennysoniana , Richard Herne Shepherd, himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. At this point we may turn to the legal documents of 1875 and extract their evidence concerning the year 1870. Before he instituted his lawsuit Tennyson had written to Pickering, as the owner of the only copy of the Tale known not to be in private hands, and had received in reply an account of some events of 1870. In consequence the Bill of Complaint composed by Tennyson's solicitors contained the following passages: 5. The Plaintiff has recently [i.e., in 1875] discovered that the Defendant Richard Herne Shepherd of No. 5 Hereford Square Brompton has procured the said Poem to be reprinted from a copy obtained by him in a surreptitious manner. . . . 6. . . . Some years ago [i.e., in 1870] the said Mr. Pickering lent his copy to the Defendant. The Defendant without Mr. Pickering's knowledge or sanction took a copy of the said Poem and caused it to be reprinted. On discovering what the Defendant had done Mr. Pickering remonstrated with him and called upon him to give up all the copies of the said Poem in his possession. The Defendant pretended to comply with this demand but it appears that he kept back one or more copies. . . . The reprint of 1870 was made the subject of a magnificently thorough set of Interrogatories by the poet's solicitors. Only the latter half of them need be quoted here. Shepherd was required to say 7 6. . . . Who were the Printers (by name and address) employed the Defendant to reprint the said Poem? and how many copies were ordered by the Defendant, and how many copies were in fact printed and for what price, and what did the Defendant pay for the same? Did not the said Mr. Pickering (and when, and how, and under what circumstances) discover that the Defendant had caused the said Poem to be printed? Did not the said Mr. Pickering then remonstrate with the Defendant on the subject? And did he not call upon the Defendant to deliver up all the copies of the said Poem in his possession or power? Did not the Defendant pretend to comply with such demands? 7. Set forth how many copies were printed by the Order of the Defendant before the said Mr. Pickering called upon the Defendant to deliver up all copies in his possession or power. Set forth what has become of all such copies of the said Poem, and if any were sold by the Defendant; set forth when, and to whom, and for what price or consideration each and every copy was sold. Set forth how many copies were delivered to the said Mr. Pickering, and when such delivery took place. Were any of the copies disposed of in any other manner? and if so, how, and to whom? Was any copy (or were any copies, and if so how many) retained by the Printer, and what has become of the same (and of any copy so retained)? In his Answer Shepherd replied at length: 5 — I admit that the plaintiff has recently discovered, and that it is the fact, that I have procured the said poem to be reprinted; but I deny and it is entirely untrue that such imprint was from a copy obtained by me in a surreptitious manner. . . . 6— . . . . In the month of June 1870 a copy of the said poem was included in a sale by auction. . . . The library was on view for many days prior to the day of sale and I inspected the poem during such time. The copy of the said poem was put up for sale with two other early volumes written by the plaintiff, and was at the auction knocked down to and ostensibly purchased by Mr. Pickering of 196, Picadilly. A number of booksellers (amongst them the said Mr. Pickering and Mr. John Pearson of No. 15, York Street, Covent Garden) attended the said sale, and entered into an arrangement (commonly known as a knock out) by which they agreed not to bid against each other at the auction, but that any lot knocked down to any one of them should afterwards be put up for sale amongst themselves, and that the sum obtained in excess of the amount bid at the auction should be equally divided amongst the several parties to the arrangement. In pursuance of this arrangement the copy [of the] poem in question was some two or three day after the sale put up by the said booksellers; and as the said Mr. B. M. Pickering offered the highest price, he became the real purchaser thereof. Before, however, the resale mentioned took place, the volume was taken charge of by and remained in the custody of the said Mr. Pickering. Whilst in such custody and possession, and with the knowledge and sanction of the said Mr. Pickering, and at his request, I transcribed the said volume upon his own premises. After the said volume had been secured by the said Mr. Pickering by such resale as hereinbefore mentioned, he on two or three occasions lent it to me in order that I might correct my transcript therefrom, and at the time of making such loan I was placed under no promise or limitation with regard to the said volume; no limitation was attempted to be placed upon my use of the said book except as an afterthought later in the same year. 8 7 — I caused the said poem to be reprinted in August 1870. Such reprint was from the transcript made by me as hereinbefore mentioned. The printers I employed were Messrs Strangeways and Walden of 28, Castle Street, Leicester Square. I ordered 50 copies to be struck off but I believe the actual number printed was 54 or 55. Of these, 25 only were delivered to me; the rest remained in the printers' hands. The fact of such reprint came to the knowledge of the said Mr. Pickering in or about the month of October 1870, and through information supplied by John Wilson of 93, Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury. Mr. Pickering complained to me upon the matter and asked me to deliver up all copies in my possession, and this, although in no wise bound so to do, I agreed to and performed. I however at the same time informed Mr. Pickering that I was unable to recall certain copies that had been given away, and he consented that such copies should be retained by their possessors. I also gave to Mr. Pickering an order upon the printers to enable him to obtain possession of the copies remaining in their hands, some 28 or 29 [ read , 29 or 30] in number, Mr. Pickering agreeing at the same time to discharge one-half of the printers' bill. I also succeeded in persuading some of the second-hand booksellers who had purchased copies to return the same upon being refunded the price they paid. The copies so returned were delivered to the said Mr. Pickering. 8 — As hereinbefore stated 54 [ read , 54 or 55] copies were printed by my order before Mr. Pickering called on me to deliver up all copies in my possession or power. Of these 12 copies were sold to Messrs. Walford Brothers of 320, Strand, for £2. Ten or eleven of these were afterwards given up to Mr. Pickering by Messrs. Walford, and the money paid for them refunded. 1 copy was sold to Mr. Pearson of 15, York Street, Covent Garden, for 3s. 6d. This was afterwards given up to Mr. Pickering and the money paid for it refunded. 1 copy was sold to Messrs. Willis &amp; Sotheran of 136, Strand, for £1. This copy had been bound in morocco at an additional cost of 6s. 1 copy was given to E. R. Tenison, Esq., M.D., of 9, Keith Terrace, Shepherd's Bush. 9 3 or more copies were given up by me to the said Mr. Pickering. 6 copies were given to Josiah Temple, Esq., of Grecian Cottage, Crown Hill, Upper Norwood, for himself and friends. 10 1 copy was given away by me but to whom, I am unable to recollect. The distribution of the said copies both by sale and gift occurred in or about the month of September 1870. 28 or 29 [ read , 29 or 30] copies were delivered by the printer on my order to Mr. Pickering. . . . To the best of my belief such delivery took place in December 1870. I retained a copy of the rough proof of such reprint and the same is now [1875] in my possession, and I am am ready and willing and hereby offer to deliver up the same to the plaintiff. As the reader may calculate, at most 11 copies escaped destruction by Pickering. (To anticipate, there is nothing to suggest he did not destroy the copies he impounded.) Because the pamphlet received no publicity of any kind, which would have advertised its rarity and desirability, for five years; because only one copy that was sold had been bound; and because the known recipients of gift copies were not likely to possess bibliographical expertise, one would not expect more than 2 or 3 copies to have survived until the present day. Much later, Shepherd wrote 11 that his reprint of 1870 was "without title, table of contents, or monograph, and it lacked completeness in regard to the collection of Minor Poems, while including some others afterwards acknowledged and restored." The consequences of the remark are radical. The reprint did not contain Shepherd's monograph on the Tale : Wise's "First Pirated Edition: 1870," which does contain it, is thereby proved to have been no production of Shepherd but, as Carter and Pollard proclaimed on other grounds, a forgery. The reprint possessed no titlepage; Wise solemnly announced the titlepage of the "Second Pirated Edition: 1870" in full: one must conclude that Wise's description of the edition is, to say the least, unreliable. The matter of the minor poems will be discussed at a more convenient place. Meanwhile, one is left without any technical description of Shepherd's reprint of 1870 beyond the sentence that has been quoted, and an inference from another of Shepherd's remarks 12 that the Tale itself exactly filled 3 gatherings, paged [1]-47, [48]. The census conducted by the present writer has turned up an example of one component of the 1870 reprint, 13 but no complete copy. The auction record, in Book Auction Records, Book Prices Current , and American Book Prices Current 14 requires close inspection. There are 26 records of sales of copies of the Tale said to be dated 1870. On reference to the sale catalogues, one of these turns out to have been dated 1875; on the other hand, two examples said to have been dated 1868 and 1875, respectively, turn out to have been dated 1870, 15 so that the total rises to 27. Of these, according to the sale catalogues, 19 contained the monograph and were therefore examples of the forged "First" edition. 16 One record is too perfunctory to allow any deduction. 17 In the remaining 7 cases, reference to the sales-catalogues shows that the copies lacked titlepages. A similar example may be added, from the list of copies said to be dated 1875, and also a ninth listing of a copy which, being sold in a batch with other books, was not recorded by BAR or BPC . The 9 records 18 may be shown to deal with 5 different examples; but because of the mainly negative character of our knowledge of the 1870 reprint, we cannot be sure that any of the 5 represent it. The subject will be resumed below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. We may now advance to the year 1875. In the interval, Shepherd (1842-1895) 19 had decidedly risen in his field. He had begun to edit the poetical works of Shelley for J. C. Hotten; later, he had edited Coleridge's Osorio and the works of Dekker (in four volumes), Glapthorne (in two volumes), and Thomas Heywood (in six volumes) for John Pearson; and he had finally continued his edition of Shelley for the firm of Chatto and Windus, the successors to Hotten, for whom he also undertook to edit the works of Charles Lamb (in one volume) and of George Chapman (in three volumes). His editing began in complete anonymity, broken by the signature of "The Author of Tennysoniana" beneath a monograph prefixed to Coleridge's play. Only at the end of the period, under Chatto and Windus, was Shepherd allowed to sign his work. The total of his publications for the five years from 1871 to 1875 amounts to twenty-one volumes. One may hope that such industry had brought him a glimpse of security and independence. On 21 April 1875 he sold to the British Museum for one pound a pamphlet of 48 pages, with only a half-title, containing his second reprint of The Lover's Tale . 20 He advertised his wares in several journals; two of his notices 21 may be here reproduced: Athenaeum (24 April 1875; p. 538). SUPPRESSED POEM by Alfred Tennyson. — A printed copy of 'THE LOVER'S TALE,' a blank verse Poem of nearly fifty pages, written by THE POET LAUREATE in his nineteenth year, and withdrawn from publication, is FOR SALE. — Apply, by letter only, to W. C. Clifford, Auctioneer and Estate-Agent, 18, Lower Belgrave-street, Eaton-square, W. S. [i.e., S.W.] Academy (15 May 1875; p. iii). Early Work by the Poet Laureate. — A Poem of 48 pages, entitled THE LOVER'S TALE, written by ALFRED TENNYSON at the age of 19, and withdrawn before publication, is FOR SALE. Address Z., care of Mr. W. C. Clifford, Auctioneer and Estate Agent, 18, Lower Belgrave Street, Eaton Square, London, S. W. It is of some importance to notice that in his advertisement of 15 May Shepherd made no reference to an accompanying or available monograph upon the Tale , though that composition had then been printed, or was in the process of being printed, for Shepherd had advertised it the week before: Athenaeum (8 May 1875; p. 636). A MONOGRAPH on the LOVER'S TALE. By the Author of 'Tennysoniana,' being a supplementary Chapter to that Work. Fifty Copies only printed. To be had by sending 25 stamps or post-office order to the Author. Address R. H. Shepherd, 5, Hereford Square, Brompton, S. W. It seems clear that at the time Shepherd thought of his monograph only as a supplement to his volume on Tennyson, rather than as an accompaniment to his reprint of the Tale . Indeed, when on 19 May he gave a copy of the monograph to the British Museum, he seems to have suggested that it should be bound up with the museum's copy of Tennysoniana ; in any case, the monograph was so bound. 22 Later Shepherd caused some examples of his second reprint to be bound. The volume contained a preliminary fold, the monograph, the Tale , and a gathering of 16 minor poems. (The exact form of the preliminary fold will be discussed below). One such volume he sent to Swinburne 23 with a suitable inscription: A. C. Swinburne, Esq. With kindest remembrances from R. H. Shepherd. Aug. 1875. In memory of a very pleasant morning spent at the Orchard, Niton, I.W. But before August, as has been already related, the Laureate had learned that the Tale had been pirated, and had written to Pickering to demand an explanation. "I am in a great rage at this scandalous business," he wrote, with truly Victorian emphasis, and received a reply, dated 29 June, that extended over three anxious pages. 24 At this point we may turn again to the legal documents. 25 On 1 July the poet instructed the firm of Lawrance, Plews, Boyer, and Baker, of 19, Old Jewry Chambers, to make inquiries and take proceedings. They placed the matter in the hands of Henry Joseph Smith, their efficient clerk. Smith discovered the advertisement of the Tale in the Athenaeum of 24 April (which has been quoted), and on 6 July he wrote to W. C. Clifford inquiring the price of the reprint and asking, incidentally, whether Clifford possessed a manuscript of the poem. Smith also discovered that the reprint had been advertised in a catalogue issued by Bartholomew Robson, bookseller. 26 On 19 July he bought a copy of the reprint from Robson for 15 shillings and sixpence; three days later he called again at Robson's shop and induced the bookseller to admit that the copy was one of three Robson had purchased from Shepherd. On 28 July, in reply to his inquiry sent to Clifford, Smith received a letter from Shepherd, who offered to sell, as Smith later testified, "a printed copy of The Lover's Tale, 47 pages" for one guinea; and in turn Smith sent a postoffice order, amount unspecified, "for the said Poem and other poems mentioned in his [Shepherd's] letter." On the same day, having obtained conclusive evidence, the solicitors filed with the Court of Chancery a manuscript Bill of Complaint , praying for the restraint of Shepherd, his surrender of all copies of his reprint, damages, the costs of the lawsuit, and "such further or other relief as the nature of the case may require." On 29 July Tennyson made an affidavit of the facts known to him, at Godalming in Surrey; on 30 July Smith received from Shepherd the poems he had ordered. On 31 July, a Saturday, Smith made an affidavit concerning his activities and discoveries, and Mr Vice-Chancellor Bacon, on the interlocutory application of Elliot Macnaghten, barrister for the plaintiff, granted an Interim Injunction : Upon Motion this day made unto this Court by Counsel for the plaintiff . . . This Court doth Order that the defendant Richard Herne Shepherd, his Agents and Servants, be restrained from printing, publishing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any Copy or Copies of the Poem called The Lover's Tale in the Bill mentioned, until the hearing of this Cause or until further Order. The injunction was served upon Shepherd on 5 August; two days later he appeared before the Court, in the person of his solicitor, Charles Armstrong, of 33, Old Jewry. On 12 August the plaintiff's solicitors filed the Interrogatories for the Examination of the Defendant , which have been quoted in part. Shepherd did not file his Answer , which has also been quoted in part, 27 until 5 October, when it was entered by his barrister, Cornelius Marshall Warmington. To this recital of the august processes of the law it is necessary to add a note. Only one document, the affidavit of Henry Joseph Smith, mentioned that any of Tennyson's poems other than the Tale had been reprinted and offered for sale by Shepherd; and that reference (which has been quoted above) was inconspicuous. It was in fact an afterthought, inserted between the lines of the concluding paragraph of Smith's affidavit, and as an insertion correctly initialled on both sides by the notary. This fact may partially explain why the reference to "other poems mentioned in his [Shepherd's] letter" was not caught up into the Bill of Complaint , the Interim Injunction , or the Interrogatories . Therefore after 5 August 1875, though Shepherd was under an injunction not to print and distribute copies of the Tale , he was still (comparatively) free to produce and sell reprints of other poems by Tennyson. In any case, one may suppose that it was in a rather defiant mood that on 21 January 1876 Shepherd sold to the British Museum copies of a preliminary fold and the gathering of minor poems. (The exact form of the preliminary fold will be discussed below.) Neither item was mentioned in the Interim Injunction , of course; and bound in the correct order with the reprint of the Tale which he had sold the Museum nine months before, they made up a complete example of what will be called, below, the third issue of the 1875 reprint. The three items were so bound, and the resultant volume now reposes on a shelf in the Museum. 28 On 29 January 1876 the case was tried before Mr Vice-Chancellor Bacon; Warmington appeared for the Defendant, Macnaghten and Edward Ebenezer Kay, Q. C., for the Plaintiff. The matter of Shepherd's reprinting of Tennyson's minor poems having been ventilated, the Court took account of it in the Perpetual Injunction : This Cause coming on this day for Trial before this Court in the presence of Counsel for the plaintiff and defendant; upon debate of the matter, and hearing the Answer of the defendant; and the plaintiff waiving any Inquiry as to damages; and the defendant admitting he has without the plaintiff's authority printed, published, and offered for sale, as being first collected by the defendant, other Poems by the plaintiff besides the Poem in the Bill mentioned called "The Lover's Tale": This Court doth Order that a perpetual Injunction be awarded to restrain the defendant Richard Herne Shepherd, his Agents and Servants, from printing, publishing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any copy or copies of the Poem in the Bill mentioned called "The Lover's Tale" or any copy or copies of the said other Poems printed, published, and offered for sale by the Defendant as aforesaid. And it is Ordered that the defendant Richard Herne Shepherd do on or before the 5th day of February 1876 deliver up on oath to the Plaintiff Alfred Tennyson, or to such person as he may appoint to receive the same, all Copies of the said Poems in the possession or power of the defendant. And it is Ordered that the defendant Richard Herne Shepherd do pay to the plaintiff Alfred Tennyson his costs of this suit as between Solicitor and Client, to be taxed by the Taxing Master in case the parties differ. On 30 June the Taxing Master ordered Shepherd to pay, as Tennyson's costs, approximately one hundred pounds, but this charge the poet himself paid "since he heard that Mr Shepherd was very poor and that his aged mother depended on him for her livelihood." 29 In order to discuss the 1875 reprint of the Tale , we may now resort to the relevant portion of Shepherd's Answer . The Interrogatories concerning it, as full, searching, and incoherent as those concerning the reprint of 1870, need not be quoted. Shepherd deposed as follows: 9 — Subsequently [to 1870] and once only, and in the spring of this year [1875], I caused the said poem [ The Lover's Tale ] to be reprinted. This last-mentioned reprint was from the rough proof of 1870 retained by me as hereinbefore mentioned. 30 This reprint was executed by Messrs. Ogden and Co., 172, St. John's Street, Clerkenwell, who at my order delivered to me 100 copies, and for which I paid the sum of £7 4s. Of these 100 copies the following have been sold to the persons whose names and addresses are set forth, and for the prices annexed, namely, £ s d 2 copies to Mr. John Pearson, bookseller, York Street, Covent Garden ... 1 0 0 5 copies to Mr. J. R. P. Kirby, 27, Bloomsbury Street, Bedford Square ... 3 18 0 3 copies to Mr. B. Robson, Bookseller, 43, Cranbourne Street, Leicester Square ... 15 0 1 copy to the British Museum ... 1 0 0 1 copy to Macmillan &amp; Co., Cambridge ... 2 2 0 1 copy to John Adam, Greenock, N[orth] B[ritain] ... 2 2 0 1 copy to W. H. Doeg, Esq., Heywood's Bank, Manchester 2 2 0 1 copy to Henry J. Smith, Hoxne House, Lillieshall Road, Clapham ... 1 1 0 ------------ Total proceeds of sale £ 14 0 0 1 copy was also given to D. Barron Brightwell, Esq., of 38, Oakley Square, N.W., in exchange for a copy of his 'Concordance to Tennyson.' The following copies were given away gratuitously: 6 copies to Josiah Temple, Esq., Grecian Cottage, Crown Hill, Upper Norwood, for self and friends 1 copy to W. Evan Franks, Esq., 8, Thurlow Place, Tulse Hill 31 1 copy to H. Curwen Esq., The Rectory, Workington, Cumberland 32 1 copy to W. T. Waite, Esq., Macaulay House, Upper Richmond Road, Putney 33 1 copy to A. C. Swinburne, Esq., 3, Great James Street, Bedford Row 1 copy to Andrew Chatto, Esq., 14, St. Mark's Crescent, Regent's Park 1 copy to W. C. Clifford, 18, Lower Belgrave Street, Eaton Square 18 copies were given or lent (and not returned) to various persons whose names and addresses I do not know or cannot recollect. 30 + 15 sold = 45 34 100 printed The remaining 55 copies are now in the possession of the defendant at 5, Hereford Square, Brompton. 10 — I admit that the copies of the said poem so reprinted by my order as hereinbefore mentioned do not bear the name of any printer or publisher; the said copies were however offered for sale in the most open manner. The principal means by which the said copies were offered for sale was through advertisements inserted during the months of April and May 1875 in the 'Times,' the 'Athenaeum,' 'Notes and Queries,' and the 'Academy.' I disposed of no copies in an underhand manner nor except as aforesaid did I sell any to a second-hand bookseller. To the best of my knowledge, information, or belief no such bookseller with the exception of Mr. Bartholomew Robson has inserted in his catalogue an advertisement of the poem either as a suppressed work by the plaintiff or in any other manner. I deny that any ready sale has been found for such copies among purchasers of rare or curious books or otherwise. Indeed the contrary is the fact, as is shown by the few copies which as hereinbefore appears I succeeded, even after issuing advertisements as aforesaid, in disposing of. I did not employ Mr. Bartholomew Robson of 43, Cranbourne Street, Leicester Square, in the Bill mentioned to dispose of the said reprint or otherwise. I sold to him three copies, as hereinbefore mentioned, and at his request supplied him with a note thereupon in the terms or to the effect set forth in the ninth paragraph of the said Bill. I asked Mr. John Salkeld, 1, Orange Street, Red Lion Square, to insert a similar advertisement in his catalogue and I left with him three copies to dispose of on commission. I also left one copy with Mr. [ ] George, a second-hand bookseller in Castle Street, Leicester Square, to be exposed in his window for sale on commission. However, in both these last-mentioned instances I withdrew the copies before any sale was effected, and Mr. Salkeld did not issue any advertisement with reference to the said reprint in his catalogue. I think it possible that Messrs. Willis and Sotheran may have inserted in one of their catalogues a notice of the said reprint. The only other person whom I employed to dispose of copies of the said reprint was Mr. William Charles Clifford, auctioneer and estate agent, 18, Belgrave Street, Eaton Square. His name and address were affixed to the advertisements in the public journals before mentioned in this paragraph. Through him as above stated I disposed of three copies at £2 2s each . . . . 12 — I admit that in the matters aforesaid I have acted most improperly, and as soon as I was served with the plaintiff's Bill I wrote to him a letter, dated the 5th August 1875, containing a full explanation and apology. To such letter, and to the letter of the same date written by my solicitor to the solicitors of the plaintiff, I crave liberty to refer. The copies of the reprint now in my possession I am ready and willing and hereby offer to deliver up to the plaintiff. 13 — I do not think the plaintiff has sustained any damages whatever, but I submit to have the interim injunction granted herein on the 31st July made perpetual. To this deposition may be added two passages from Shepherd's Bibliography concerning his reprint: (p. 50) "The Lover's Tale" was originally printed (1870) by Strangeways and Walden, and again (1875) with the Minor Poems, by Ogden. The latter reprint is disfigured by two clerical errors unobserved in the final proof-sheets and which had to be corrected by errata. The former reprint is therefore preferable (where procurable) as regards the principal poem: as the pagination is the same either will fit into the volume. The contents and monograph were printed in 1875 by Messrs. Brawn; and the copies bound in boards and otherwise were bound by De Coverly. Where Shepherd thought that examples of his 1870 reprint could be procured in 1875 must be acknowledged a mystery. Smarting under Pickering's attempt to dodge all blame, did he cherish a suspicion that the publisher had not destroyed all the copies of the earlier pamphlet turned over to him by Shepherd, the booksellers, and the printers in 1870? It is more likely that when Shepherd wrote the passages he was thinking of his own friends, who might still possess the copies of the earlier reprint he had given them. As we shall see, one such friend did make the substitution here suggested. (p. 9) [The 1875 reprint] contained twelve pages of preliminary matter (with title, contents, indicating the sources of the minor poems, and "a Monograph . . .") and sixty-four pages of text, of which forty-eight were occupied by the principal poem, and sixteen by the minor poems. . . . Some of the copies were done up in blue and white boards, entirely uncut; others were bound in vellum or half roan, with edges cut and tops gilt; others remained loose or stitched, in the original sheets. It will be advantageous to sum up the matter concisely. In the spring of 1875 Shepherd caused Messrs Ogden &amp; Co. to produce, from the rough proof of his 1870 production, 100 copies of The Lover's Tale , consisting of 47 pages of text followed by a blank page [48], or three gatherings, sewn. He sold a copy to the British Museum on 21 April, and advertised copies for sale, specifically described, as late as 15 May. Later he caused other items to be printed: (a) by Messrs Brawn, his monograph, of which he gave a copy to the British Museum on 19 May; (b) by Ogden &amp; Co., again, some minor poems, which he offered for sale to H. J. Smith in a letter dated 27 July; and (c) by Messrs Brawn, again, a preliminary fold, which (to anticipate) was printed three times in slightly differing forms, and of which the form probably last in the sequence occurs in the volume sent to Swinburne between 1 and 5 August. There is no particular mystery about his employment of two different printers: Ogden &amp; Co. were obviously the more skilled and better able to cope with verse, the Messrs Brawn were the less expensive and good enough for prose. In his Answer Shepherd made no reference to his monograph (because it was a strictly legal production, untouched by the lawsuit) or to his reprint of Tennyson's minor poems (because the poet's solicitors had failed to mention them in the Bill of Complaint ). For this reason, in his Answer Shepherd accounted for the 100 copies of the poem, The Lover's Tale , without making any distinction between copies sold without accompaniment of any kind (such as that purchased in April by the British Museum); copies sold with examples of the minor poems (such as that ordered and obtained in July by Herbert Joseph Smith); and copies bound up with examples of both the monograph and the minor poems (such as that received in August by Swinburne). The three varieties, of which the second must be divided into two, will henceforth be termed issues 35 of the edition. All Shepherd's statements in his Answer refer to the reprint of the Tale in 48 pages, only. It seems clear that the 55 examples held by the defendant were surrendered to the solicitors of the plaintiff, and destroyed; and that the court likewise turned over the two examples offered in evidence, which were likewise destroyed. Therefore, 43 examples at most remained extant. Fortunately, any available example of the reprint of 1875 can be identified as such by means of the two misprints (italics supplied): p. 4. Mine utterence with lameness. Tho' long years (for utterance) p. 15. The drowned seamen on the shore? These things (for seaman). The issues may now be considered in sequence: First issue . No titlepage. Collation: half-title, reading The Lover's Tale , on recto of initial leaf (verso blank), pp. [1]-[2]; text of the poem, pp. [3]-47; page [48] blank. The collation has been taken from the pamphlet 36 sold by Shepherd to the British Museum on 21 April 1875, since that fits exactly the descriptions in Shepherd's contemporary advertisements. Like all the other publications here discussed, it is a small octavo. As already related, the example in the British Museum has been bound up with other materials; the pages of the volume have been cut. Other examples, sewn, are held by Trinity College, Cambridge (presented by Mr. R. Bowes in 1926) and by Yale (acquired at an unrecorded date from an unknown source). The present writer possesses an example bound in half green morocco; it is uncut, and the leaves have slightly irregular shapes. In the past, similar irregularities caused both the Cambridge and Yale examples to be catalogued as proofs. Such an item, of three gatherings stitched together, may be termed the central component of the later issues of the 1875 reprint. Some examples of these issues which were distributed unbound may have lost their preliminary and appended gatherings and therefore became indistinguishable from examples of the first issue. The possibility is unimportant, for our figure for the number of surviving copies of the 1875 Tale concerns the total of the issues taken together. But we know that in the 1870 reprint the Tale was also contained in three gatherings paged [1]-47, [48]; and as copies of that edition were distributed unbound, some of them may have lost their appended gathering (or gatherings) and also have become indistinguishable from examples of the first issue of 1875 — except for differences in type and setting, of which the most notable is the fact that they contain a correct text, without misprints on pages 4 and 15. The four copies of the first issue of 1875 listed above all contain the two misprints; none of them can be of 1870. Only the first can be said with certainty to have been originally issued alone; the fourth, being bound, probably was issued without other gatherings. The examples held by Trinity College and Yale may have once been parts of examples of later issues. At this point one may recur to the 5 examples of the Tale without title-pages which are recorded as sold at auction. They are not available for inspection; one cannot tell whether or not they contain the two misprints. Consequently, one cannot assign them between the editions of 1870 and 1875. Second issue . The Lover's Tale and Other / Poems by Alfred Tennyson / Now First Collected / London / Fifty Copies Printed for Private Circulation / M.D.CCC.LXXV. Collation: Titlepage, as above (verso blank), pp. [i]-[ii]; table of contents, pp. [iii]-iv; [ The Lover's Tale , 48 pp.]; text of sixteen minor poems, pp. [49]-64. Mr John Carter has kindly allowed me to examine a remarkable volume in his possession, from which I have drawn the above description. The Lover's Tale itself is printed on three gatherings of paper slightly yellower than that in the preliminary fold and final gathering; it does not display the misprints on pages 4 and 15. On the blank verso of the half-title to the Tale appears an inscription in the hand of Shepherd: [name erased] / from The Editor of Tennysoniana / Sept. 3. 1870. Under an ultra-violet lamp Mr Carter has deciphered the erasure as "M rs O F Frank"—that is, one may scarcely doubt, either W. Evan Franks, Esq., of 8, Thurlow Place, Tulse Hill or the "C.S.F. (Norwood" mentioned in Shepherd's dedication of the second edition of Tennysoniana. 37 The three gatherings bearing the Tale have been detached from the appended gathering (or gatherings) of minor poems in an example of the 1870 reprint, and have been substituted for the similar gatherings, identically paged, in the reprint of 1875. Shepherd's recommendation of such a substitution, in order to obviate the disfiguring misprints in the 1875 reprint of the Tale , has already been quoted; and we may suppose that he had made it orally to his friends in 1875. The volume has been neatly bound by Kaufmann in half-calf; the edges have been cut, and the top edge gilt. On the spine, in a label of red leather, the legend appears running upwards: "The Lover's Tale. — Tennyson." The preliminary fold and the gathering of minor poems represent the 1875 reprint. The absence of errata on the verso of the titleleaf indicates that this form of the fold was printed before Shepherd discovered the two misprints in the Tale ; the form is therefore clearly prior to those contained in the issues described below. The gathering of minor poems is identical with those in the later issues. No other example of the second issue, complete or partial, has been found. Third issue .

The leaves in the preliminary fold are conjugate; there are five gatherings in all. Fourth issue . The Lover's Tale and Other / Poems by Alfred Tennyson / Now First Collected with / a Monograph / London / Fifty Copies Printed for Private Circulation / M.D.CCC.LXXV. Collation: the same as for the third issue except for the presence of the monograph, separately paged [1]-8, after the preliminary gathering. Though the monograph is mentioned on the titlepage, as above, it is not listed or referred to in the table of contents. The leaves in the preliminary fold are conjugate; there are six gatherings in all. The order here imposed upon the two last issues requires a word. Except for the presence in one issue of the monograph, which was separately printed and sold, the difference between the two issues consists of the absence or presence on the titlepage of the words "with a Monograph." The order of the two issues has no bearing upon any further point. As it seems reasonable (though it cannot be demonstrated) that the issue lacking the monograph preceded the issue containing it, they are here termed the third and fourth issues, respectively, for convenience in reference. One may note that the fourth issue was the one described by Shepherd in his Bibliography of Tennyson ; and, so far as one can tell, it was the only issue of which he caused examples to be bound. Only two examples of the third issue have been located, and these might be questioned by a hypercritical opponent. As has been recounted above, the (first) British Museum copy (shelfmark C.28.c.10) consists of three items sold by Shepherd on two different occasions, and subsequently bound together. The Museum also holds a second copy, exactly the same in every detail, which forms part of a volume of Tennysonian reprints (shelfmark C.58.b.10) bearing annotations by Shepherd. As one of the notes mentions the sale of Pickering's copy of the 1833 Tale , in 1879, he must have written in or after that year. The Museum purchased the volume in November 1895 from one Alpheus Sherwin Cody, of 4 Montague Street, London, W.C. But though the integrity of the first copy, and the date of the second, might be questioned, it seems unnecessary to question the issue which is represented by them both. Three examples of the fourth issue are known: (1) the copy that Shepherd sent to Swinburne early in August 1875, now at Harvard; 38 (2) a copy bought by Harry Buxton Forman on 27 January 1876, according to his pencilled date on the flyleaf, which when sold with his library in 1920 was acquired by the Huntington Library; and (3) a copy bearing the bookplate of Henry Francis Redhead Yorke and the pencilled inscription, on the front flyleaf, "wa/s rhs Sept. 18/1875" — which one may suppose to indicate that the copy was purchased from Shepherd at the coded price on the date given. The third copy was bequeathed by Owen D. Young in 1941 to the Berg Collection. All three copies are in the original dark blue-gray paper boards with white paper spine. The auction record is not illuminating. There are 18 records of examples of the Tale dated 1875. Recourse to the sale catalogues shows one of these to have lacked a titlepage, and another to have born the date 1870; but as in a similar operation one record has already been transferred from 1870 to 1875, the total becomes 17. Of these, 11 are shown by the sales catalogues to have mentioned the monograph upon their titlepages; they refer to the fourth issue in between 4 and 7 examples other than the 3 located above. 39 The remaining 6 records seem to refer to the second or third issue in 5 examples, which are distinct from Mr Carter's copy and of course from the 2 copies held by the British Museum. 40 CENSUS, The Lover's Tale , unauthorized reprints produced by R.

      <field name="fulltext">IV. At this point one may turn to consider Shepherd's little monograph: The Lover's Tale / A Supplementary Chapter to Tennysoniana. / (Only Fifty Copies Printed.) On the verso of the titlepage appears the legend, "Price Two Shillings"; the text fills pages [3]-8. Though the pamphlet bears no date, Shepherd's actions in advertising the edition in the Athenaeum of 8 May, and in presenting an example to the British Museum on 19 May 1875, prove conclusively that he produced it in that year. In his Bibliography of Tennyson (II, 9-10) Wise implied that the monograph was printed in 1870, but later in a rare absentminded moment, he gave the pamphlet its true date of "[1875]", in his Ashley Library (VII, 1925, p. 161). Copies are held by the Clark Memorial Library in Los Angeles (bound with a copy of Tennysoniana , 1866), Princeton, and Texas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. The evidence concerning the pamphlets of minor poems is not easily understood. To recapitulate, the only available evidence concerning the minor poems in the 1870 reprint consists of one sentence by Shepherd (p.9): in comparison with the 1875 reprint "it lacked completeness in regard to the collection of Minor Poems, while including some others afterwards acknowledged and restored." In other words, in 1870 Shepherd did not reprint all the minor poems which Tennyson had published before that time only in periodicals and the like, and he did reprint some minor poems which before 1875 Tennyson gathered from their places of first publication into his collected works. As no complete copy of the 1870 reprint has been located, and the standard description has been proved unreliable, we cannot be sure exactly what Shepherd's sentence means. Turning to the year 1875, we may recall that Shepherd made no reference to any pamphlet of minor poems in his advertisements of April and May. In his letter of 27 July he offered to sell to H. J. Smith not only a copy of the Tale , but some "other poems." The volume which Shepherd sent to Swinburne in the first days of August contained a gathering of 16 pages, numbered [49]-64, which bears 16 minor poems. Shepherd sold an exactly similar gathering, similarly paged and containing the same poems, to the British Museum on 21 January 1876. In his Bibliography of Alfred , Lord Tennyson (1901), a description of a set of the poet's works gathered together by Dodd, Mead and Company, Luther S. Livingston announced the existence of two undated pamphlets of minor poems (pp. 58, 66). He gratefully acknowledged the assistance he had derived from the proof-sheets of Wise's Bibliography in which, seven years later, more detailed descriptions of both pamphlets appeared (II, 10-12, 14-16). As neither pamphlet appears in the catalogue of the Ashley Library, or now exists among Wise's books in the British Museum, one is thrown back upon the Dodd, Mead set of Tennyson, which was acquired by George H. Richmond, a book-dealer, and then purchased in 1904 by Pierpont Morgan. The two pamphlets may be separately considered. (A) According to Livingston, Shepherd issued with his 1870 reprint of the Tale an undated second part of sixteen pages, containing sixteen minor poems by Tennyson, which he also sold separately, at 2 shillings. Livingston gives the collation as "Title and text, pp. 1-16"; reference to Wise's bibliography shows that the pamphlet of sixteen pages should be described as having no title or half-title, but a dropped head on the first page, reading Poems . One is surprised to discover that the Morgan Library holds no example of the pamphlet, nor according to its records did it receive one in the Dodd, Mead set. Yet Richmond wrote to Morgan on 9 December 1904, referring to himself in the third person, "The set sold you comprises everything purchased by Mr. Richmond from the former owners, and every addition made by him to it. . . . 41 Again, one should suppose that any ordinary entry in Livingston's list was unquestionable evidence that an example of the item was included in the Dodd, Mead set, for though his titlepage promises "notes referring to items not included in the set," these notes are distinguished not only by smaller type, but by the prefixed warning, NOTE. Livingston's entry for the 16-page pamphlet is certainly not a note. But if a copy of the pamphlet existed in the Dodd, Mead set, it does not seem to have passed to Richmond, and certainly did not pass to Morgan. One may consult neither the example described by Wise, nor that described by Livingston. Unfortunately, the census conducted by the present writer has not located any other copy. A look at the list of minor poems subjoined by Livingston is even more perturbing, for the poems are exactly the same as those in the 1875 gathering. Shepherd remarked that his 1870 reprint, in comparison with that of 1875, "lacked completeness in regard to the collection of Minor Poems": it is therefore clear that the pamphlet cannot be considered the second part of Shepherd's 1870 reprint. Further, the pamphlet cannot have been printed by Shepherd before 1875, because it includes one poem, beginning "Here often as a child I lay reclined," which he said (p. 22) he did not know until it was reprinted by another man in 1875. Wise lists the poems, of course, as occurring on the relevant pages of his "Second Pirated Edition: 1870." His description of the edition has already been termed unreliable because it includes a titlepage, whereas Shepherd said his 1870 reprint had none; we now have a second reason to doubt the description. The minor poems which it lists cannot, according to Shepherd, have been those he reprinted in 1870; and the list includes one poem which Shepherd had not heard of before 1875. Returning to the pamphlet, one must reject the date of 1870 given it by Livingston and Wise. Did it appear in 1875? It differs in only one point from the gathering Shepherd sent to Swinburne (as part of a volume) in 1875 and sold to the British Museum in January 1876: its pages are numbered [1]-16 rather than [49]-64. No such gathering exists in any known example. The only auction record of the Tale which mentions that in the copy the minor poems have separate pagination, also asserts that the minor poems are preceded by a half-title; 42 and the gathering here in question has no half-title. The auction record of separate pamphlets of minor poems is also disappointing. Of the 6 records, 5 turn out on recourse to the sales catalogues to refer to pamphlets containing not 16, but 32 pages, so that they must be considered under (B), below. The single remaining record concerns the sale at Sotheby's, in the B. B. MacGeorge sale (#1305), on 1 July 1924, of a copy of Shepherd's 1875 reprint of the Tale , including his monograph. The catalogue adds, "At the end of the vol. appears a Collection of Minor Poems, 16 pp., issued in 1870. . . ." 42 After the first moment, one recollects that the fourth issue of Shepherd's 1875 reprint does include his monograph and, at the end, 16 pages of minor poems — paged [49]-64; and according to the standard accounts of Livingston and Wise, the last item had appeared in 1870. The record may conceivably refer to an example of a gathering paged [1]-16, but it is far more likely to refer to one paged [48]-64. In sum, the evidence for the existence of an undated pamphlet, paged [1]-16, containing 16 minor poems, consists at present of Livingston's entry and its probable source, known to be unreliable, in Wise. The evidence is insufficient. At present, one must suppose no such pamphlet to have existed. (B) According to Livingston, Shepherd issued with his 1875 reprint of the Tale an undated second part of 32 pages, containing 18 minor poems by Tennyson, which he also sold separately. The pamphlet has a half-title, reading Poems , with blank reverse. The Morgan Library holds two examples (one unopened), received as part of the Dodd, Mead set. The auction record consists of the five sales already mentioned, of which one refers to the example now held by the Huntington Library, and all five possibly may so refer. 43 Only the three examples have been located. There are also records of two sales which conceivably referred to other copies. 44 An examination of the poems in the pamphlet causes cheerful confusion. It lacks 3 poems which the known 1875 gathering contains. 45 It contains 5 poems which the known 1875 gathering lacks, and which were published by Tennyson in the Imperial Library Edition of his works, in 1872. 46 In other words, in comparison with the known 1875 gathering the 32-page pamphlet lacks completeness in regard to the collection of minor poems, while including others acknowledged and restored to his canon by Tennyson in 1872. The 32-page pamphlet fulfills the fragmentary description, the only one we possess, of the second part of Shepherd's 1870 reprint. For the moment its identity seems clear. But one further matter remains. Livingston and Wise not only dated the 32-page pamphlet as of 1875, they listed "an absolute reprint" of it: The New Timon and the Poets (1876). 47 When examples of the 32-page pamphlet and The New Timon are placed side by side for close inspection, it is immediately clear that they were printed from the same rather careless setting of slightly battered type. Many botched overprintings and occasional cracked types appear in the same places in both. 48 It seems advisable to consider the known history of The New Timon .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI. Harry Buxton Forman acquired a copy of The New Timon — or placed it, bound, upon his shelves — on 25 September 1899, when he wrote his initials and the date within it. There was an example in the Dodd, Mead set of Tennyson's works which Livingston described, with the aid of advance proofs of Wise's Bibliography , in 1901. A gap of almost twenty years separates these two dates from the next appearance of an example, in the sale of Part I of Buxton Forman's library in March 1920, when the first copy mentioned above sold for $410. At the sale of the second part of the library, in April, a second copy of The New Timon sold for $250. In 1921 the Huntington Library acquired a copy from Quaritch, Yale obtained a copy from an unrecorded source, and Lord Esher bought a copy, no doubt in London. In 1922 Cornell purchased an example; at some time prior to 1923 A. C. Chapin, who was to bequeath his library to Williams College, bought a copy through Lathrop C. Harper. 49 Not until 1926-1927 did any copies, other than Buxton Forman's, appear in the auction rooms; then two were sold, and another in 1930, and a third in 1932; after the last year, one must remember, the Depression damped down the trade in rare books. In or before the later 1930's an example was bought by Wesleyan University (Middletown, Connecticut); in 1939 a copy was sold at auction; in 1945 a copy was bought by the University of Michigan from Quaritch. One further example was sold at Sotheby's in 1946. This narrative is somewhat surprising, for Wise had remarked in 1908 (II,21) that The New Timon and the Poets , 1876, and the first (1870) issue of Mr. Herne Shepherd's reprint of The Lover's Tale , possess far more interest and importance . . . than can usually be claimed for any pirated book. . . . Both . . . have become extremely uncommon, and are increasingly difficult to meet with. And he later opined ( Ashley Library , VII, 1925, p. 139) that Shepherd's issue of The New Timon "must have been a small one, for the pamphlet is now by no means easy to find." The comments read oddly when one recalls the sudden appearance of 5 examples in 1921-1923, after the two very high prices ($410 and $250) attained by copies in the sales of Forman's library. As most of the known copies appeared subsequent to the sale of Buxton Forman's library, it seemed conceivable that after Forman's death his son, Maurice Buxton Forman, might have released one of those small parcels of pamphlets that his father had long been in the habit of "salting down," as he termed it. Since, as I have been informed, Mr Mudie of Quartch's, together with Wise, made the probate valuation of Forman's library, and since the firm of Quaritch sold examples of The New Timon in 1921 and 1945, it seemed natural to ask them whether they had, in fact, bought a small batch of copies from the younger Buxton Forman about 1920. In a courteous and candid reply, of 22 January 1963, Mr A. R. Newton of Bernard Quaritch Ltd. wrote, in part, Our records show only the copy that we sold in May 1945, apparently the one that went to Michigan. We have a note that 8 copies in all had previously passed through our hands, but no record as to their provenance or to whom they were sold. The writer of this letter believes that we did purchase some oddments from the library of Buxton Forman and it is just possible the 8 copies we sold previous to 1945 may have been acquired from his books that did not go to America for sale. Unfortunately, however, there is no-one at present with the firm who recollects such a transaction. One need not say that, whatever the provenance of their first eight examples, Quaritch purchased and sold them in entire good faith. In view of the extremely slender record of the pamphlet, it seems clear that the firm must have obtained a "remainder" from someone. Mr Newton's letter provides no distinct evidence to connect the remainder with Maurice Buxton Forman, and any suggestion that he was its source must here be explicitly withdrawn. The available data concerning The New Timon may be arranged as follows: The New Timon : (1) Buxton Forman's first copy: "full [green] levant morocco, Jansen style, inside dentelles, uncut, by Riviere"; according to his pencilled note, acquired (?or shelved) on 25 September 1899; sold with his library at the Anderson Galleries (Part I, #865) on 15 March 1920; then or later obtained by C. T. Crocker; presented in the Crocker Collection to the University of Virginia in 1961. (2) Buxton Forman's second copy: "sewn, uncut, in slip case"; ?also acquired in 1899; sold with his library at the Anderson Galleries (Part II, #1089) on 26 April 1920.? Resold at the Am. Art Assoc. Galleries, sale of Thomas Ogden Amelia (#192), on 27 October 1930; "stitched, in half red morocco case." ? Acquired by Connecticut Wesleyan "in the late 1930's": "paper, uncut, enclosed in red case with morocco back" [MS addition to the library's copy of the printed catalogue card, by courtesy of the librarian]; subsequently stolen. (3) T. J. Wise's copy, described in the advance proofs of his Bibliography , which were consulted by L. S. Livingston in or before 1901; Ashley Library VII (1925) 139: "bound in red levant morocco by Riviere"; now in the British Museum. (4) Dodd, Mead &amp; Co.'s copy, obtained in or before 1901: "stitched, uncut"; purchased by George H. Richmond and by him sold to J. P. Morgan in 1904; now in red leather solander case, uniform with most of the Morgan Tennysons. (5) [1] Huntington copy, bought in 1921 from Quaritch: "stitched, without wrappers." (6) [2] Yale copy, acquired in 1921 from an unrecorded source: "stitched and uncut." (7) [3] Harvard copy; acquired by Lord Esher in 1921, according to his pencilled note; obtained by Harvard at Sotheby's in 1946: "stitched, without binding or wrapper"; still partly unopened. (8) [4] Cornell copy, bought in 1922; condition when acquired not recorded; since acquisition, bound by the library. (9) [5] Copy acquired by J. A. Spoor (1851-1926); sold with his library, which had been held in storage since his death, at the Parke-Bernet Galleries (Part II, #1003) on 4 May 1939; "stitched, uncut, small stain on upper margin of title-page, in a half green levant morocco solander case." (10) [6] Williams copy, purchased for A. C. Chapin before 1923 by Lathrop C. Harper: "sewed, uncut, [partly unopened,] in cloth folder, [brown quarter-] morocco slip case" — bracketed information by the courtesy of the Custodian of the Chapin Library. (11) [7] Copy sold at the Am. Art Assoc. Galleries in a miscellaneous sale (#897) on 23 November 1926: "sewn, uncut, enclosed in quarter red morocco slip case and inner cloth folder." ?? Sold at Hodgson's, as the property of John Drinkwater, on 25 May 1932 (#127): "stitched." ? Sold by Quaritch to Michigan in 1945: "stitched." (12) [8] Copy sold at the Am. Art Assoc. Galleries in the sale of the library of Major W. van R. Whittall (#1279) on 14 February 1927: "stitched and uncut, as issued in quarter brown levant morocco slip case, inner cloth wrapper"; then or later acquired by Owen D. Young, who bequeathed it to the Berg Collection in 1941. Though some of the details are speculative, as they have been marked, the table shows that in 1899-1901 The New Timon is recorded only in connection with Wise and (no doubt through Wise) with Forman and the Dodd, Mead set of Tennysons. (We may push the date of its probable production back one year, for a copy of the associated 32-page pamphlet of minor poems was sold in New York in 1898). The circumstances are disquieting. One is not surprised to discover that the text of the poems is set in Miller and Richards 17 Long Primer, which Carter and Pollard designated as "C" and identified in eleven forgeries ( Enquiry , pp. 67, 379). It is of some importance to note that the type dissociates the pamphlet from the "First Pirated Edition" of The Lover's Tale , for that is printed in Clay's Long Primer No. 3, which Carter and Pollard designated as "A"; had the two productions been printed in the same type, it would have been fairly probable that they were printed at the same time, in some conjunction of purposes. As it is, the "First Pirated Edition" must have been produced before 1894, when the firm of Clay shifted from type "A" to type "C" ( Enquiry , p. 64); and The New Timon must have been produced (assuming that Clay's produced it, like the rest of Wise's forgeries) in 1894 or later. Of the display types in the pamphlet, it may suffice here to remark that the first line on the titlepage of The New Timon is set in the same type as the word "London" on the titlepage of William Morris, The Two Sides of the River , a possible forgery; and similarly, the fifth line on the same titlepage (i.e., "with other omitted") is set in the same type as the word "by" on the Morris titlepage. The paper consists of almost exactly two-thirds esparto and one-third chemical wood. Esparto had been introduced into papermaking in 1861. Chemical wood was first produced in Sweden, in 1874; the English imports were 485 tons in 1874, less than a thousand tons in 1875, and slightly over a thousand tons in 1876. 50 It is therefore impossible that the 32-page pamphlet of minor poems and The New Timon were printed in 1870. It is possible that they were printed in 1876, but very unlikely. A much later date seems indicated. Though the evidence of the paper, the types, and the known history of The New Timon does not provide an absolute proof that the pamphlet was produced by Wise, and (therefore) that the associated 32-page pamphlet of minor poems was also his work, the circumstances blend too well with the known facts of Wise's career to leave room for serious doubt. The argument may be said to lead to a virtual certainty. In the succeeding pages Wise's responsibility for both pamphlets will be assumed, for the sake of brevity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII. It is now time to consider Wise's descriptions of Shepherd's supposed reprints. "First Pirated Edition: 1870." A forgery. One cannot be sure that Wise had ever seen a copy of Shepherd's genuine 1870 reprint; but if he had not, one may suppose he was aware 51 of Shepherd's casual account of it as "without title, table of contents, or monograph" and lacking "completeness in regard to the collection of Minor Poems, while including some others afterwards acknowledged [by Tennyson] and restored [to the canon of his collected works]." In either case, Wise must have known that the genuine reprint of 1870 had no titlepage and therefore bore no date, so that he could confer priority on his forgery by a dated titlepage. But if the forgery was to contravene Shepherd's account by the presence of a titlepage, in ordinary prudence the account should be discredited as thoroughly as possible; therefore, perhaps, Wise decided to exclude all minor poems from his production and to include the monograph. 52 "Second Pirated Edition: 1870." Whether or not Wise ever saw an example of Shepherd's genuine edition of 1870, he did not attempt to give a description of it compatible with Shepherd's remarks. In the description he invented, he asserted that the minor poems were separately paged, in order to make more plausible the 32-page pamphlet, separately paged, which he had produced himself. This was the important point, so far as Wise was concerned; all his other details do no more than suggest that in 1875 Shepherd sent a copy or proof of his earlier production to the printer. "Third Pirated Edition: 1875." Wise drew his description from an example of the third issue of Shepherd's 1875 reprint. If he inspected the two copies held by the British Museum, it is odd that the numerous tell-tale stamps in the first of them did not cause him to infer the existence of the first issue. Apparently, he did not know the second issue of the reprint. The fourth issue he described cursorily, at the end of his account of Shepherd's reprints (II, 19): These proceedings [the lawsuit] seem to have had the desired effect, for Mr. Shepherd does not appear to have made any further attempt to reprint The Lover's Tale . At intervals, however, during later years, he put single copies into circulation. These were copies which remained in his hands when the sale of them was stopped in January 1876. They were invariably put up either into paper boards, or in a 'half-calf' binding by De Coverly, and usually had the separate ( Two Shilling ) issue of the Monograph inserted between the Title-page and the Text. This passage implies that Shepherd in defiance of the Court of Chancery retained copies of his 1875 reprint after 5 February 1876. Only one bit of available evidence might be considered to support Wise's charge. This is the second of the copies held by the British Museum, which contains an example of Shepherd's reprint of The Window [1869], an example of the third issue of his 1875 reprint of the Tale , and pages bearing Timbuctoo which have been extracted from some edition of Cambridge Prize Poems . One of Shepherd's notes proves that he had the volume in his hands after 1878. As it was bought by the British Museum in 1895 (shelfmark C.58.b. 10), it may have been known to Wise, and have furnished a practical basis for his implied charge. But one may suppose that Shepherd had given his two reprints to a friend at the times they were produced; and that the friend later caused them to be bound up, together with the pages bearing Timbuctoo , and asked Shepherd to enrich the volume with his comments. Therefore, the volume does not prove that Shepherd retained an example of his 1875 reprint in defiance of the order of the Court. The evidence suggests, on the contrary, that Shepherd stayed carefully within the letter of the law. He produced interleaved copies of the authorized edition of the Tale (1879), in which he wrote a brief historical preface and noted the variants of the 1833 text. No doubt he took the variants from his original transcript, made at Pickering's request in 1870; this, it is a bit startling to notice, he did not offer to surrender in his Answer of 1875. Examples of the interleaved and annotated form are held by Harvard, the Huntington Library (two), Princeton, and the present writer. The copies of the fourth issue to which Wise referred were those described by Shepherd as bound in "blue and white paper boards, entirely uncut" and in "half roan, with edges cut and tops gilt". Wise may well have known the example in boards held by his friend Buxton Forman since 27 January 1876. By disregarding the fact that the fourth was the issue described by Shepherd in 1896, and the only issue mentioned by him, he not only increased the confusion surrounding the subject, but generated more suspicion of Shepherd's good faith. "Fourth Pirated Edition: 1875." Wise wrote that "The only differences between the Third and Fourth editions are (a) that the two errors occurring in the text were corrected, (b) that the list of Errata was accordingly omitted from the reverse of the Title-page." As Shepherd swore that the Tale was printed only once in 1875, it is impossible to suppose that an edition (or issue) such as Wise described can have existed. At the same time, a copy here and there may have been made up, at Shepherd's suggestion, in such a way that it would fulfill the description — that is, several of Shepherd's friends may have caused to be bound together in the proper order the three gatherings bearing the Tale from the 1870 reprint, and the preliminary fold and final gathering from the second issue of the 1875 reprint. Mr Carter's copy is such a made-up example; a few others — 10 at most — may have been produced by Shepherd's other friends, and some of these may in time appear. Such copies were made up without fraudulent intent of any kind. Their owners desired to arrange a volume containing both a text of the Tale without disfiguring misprints and an anthology of Tennyson's minor poems still (in 1875) not gathered into his collected works. It is possible that Wise inspected such a made-up copy which (unlike Mr Carter's) bore no betraying inscription dated 1870, and based upon it his description of the "Fourth Pirated Edition." He may have been bewildered by the apparent multiplicity of Shepherd's editions (or issues), and convinced that Shepherd's accounts of them were incomplete and misleading. But it is also possible that Wise saw no made-up copy, and created his "Fourth" pirated edition out of the whole cloth, as another production discreditable to Shepherd. "Fifth Pirated Edition: 1875." According to Wise, the final component of this edition is the pamphlet of 18 minor poems, paged [1]-32, 52a which we know to have been printed from the same setting of type as The New Timon ("1876"). If the arguments of this paper are accepted, one must believe that Timon was produced by Wise after 1893, most probably in 1898. The "Fifth" edition therefore cannot have existed. "Sixth Pirated Edition: 1875." According to Wise, this edition was exactly the same as the "Fifth" except that the minor poems were paged not [1]-32, but [49]-64. The list of the poems shows that Shepherd would have published the collection before, rather than after, 1872; indeed, because no complete example of Shepherd's 1870 reprint has been located, we cannot prove that these 18 poems were not the ones he reprinted in it. Be that as it may, it is impossible to suppose that Shepherd included these 18 poems in his 1875 reprint, in any circumstances. Wise must have invented his "Sixth" Pirated Edition" out of the whole cloth. His motive seems clear; he wished to multiply the pirated editions supposedly distributed by Shepherd in order to discredit Shepherd's statements about his reprints. The New Timon ("1876"). One may suppose that Wise invented his "Fifth Pirated Edition" in order to provide a plausible reason for the existence of the 32-page pamphlet of minor poems; and that he produced the 32-page pamphlet in order to explain the existence of The New Timon . But why did he produce The New Timon ? It cannot have been an ordinary commercial venture, since (so far as we can tell) he sold only one example in twenty years. The matter is not clear; however, had circumstances made it advisable for Wise to insist upon Shepherd's irrepressible dishonesty, he would not have been able to produce any examples of the "Second," "Fourth," "Fifth," or "Sixth" pirated editions of the Tale — but he could have produced an example of The New Timon . He may have created it as a bit of irrefutable evidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VIII. As these pages have sought to explain a number of Wise's decisions and actions by reference to his desire to discredit Shepherd and Shepherd's bibliographical work, the matter should be briefly considered. In the later 1890's Wise was enjoying his fabulous career (1886? 53 -1905?) as a forger of literary rarities. According to the latest tally, by 1896 he had produced 40 forgeries (he was to add 22 more), 54 and there had already been some slight unpleasantness about one of them, the forged edition of Swinburne's Sienna . 55 In these circumstances, it does not seem unreasonable to suppose that Wise, who was both an imaginative and a prudent man, decided to erect a lightning rod — or, to speak more plainly, to arrange matters so that if his fraudulent productions should be denounced, and his connection with them intimated, the blame could be easily and convincingly placed upon another man. For the position of lightning-rod Shepherd possessed exceptional qualifications. 56 He had been involved for over a quarter-century in bibliographical chores and adventures. He had had slight and usually unfortunate relations with such authors as Browning, Tennyson, and Swinburne. He had been publicly charged with producing and distributing unauthorized and illicit pamphlets, he had admitted his guilt, and he had died. A number of questionable aspects of Shepherd's career had been broached and confirmed by his admissions under cross-examination in the trial of Shepherd v. Francis , the libel suit which he preferred against the Athenaeum in 1879 ( Times , 17 July, p. 6). After the verdict went in his favor the Athenaeum , in its issue of 21 July, had vengefully broadcast whatever it could draw from the cross-examination to his discredit. The account included references to the Laureate's suit to stop the piracy of The Lover's Tale , and the resulting decision of the Court of Chancery. The affair was quietly mentioned by Shepherd, with full details about his illicit reprints, in his Bibliography of Tennyson , which his surviving brother published in 1896, to his memory. That document, indeed, gives a general impression of candor and of a selfless enthusiasm for literature. But what if matters could be so arranged that Shepherd's candor would show as shameless lying, his enthusiasm as a pursuit of petty gain? Wise had already (about 1890) produced his forgery of Shepherd's 1870 reprint of the Tale ; his effort to compose a convincing account of it for his bibliography of Tennyson may have brought the larger opportunity to his mind. He need only increase Shepherd's supposed editions of the Tale to the number of six, and provide ocular evidence of these farcical activities in the shape of The New Timon , whose date seemed to make clear that Shepherd had cocked a snook at the Court of Chancery: once these were accepted as evidence of Shepherd's conduct in the affair of the Tale , who could doubt that in his time he had achieved many shadier feats never called to the attention of the law? If these speculations are correct, by the turn of the century Wise had prepared and held in readiness a defence against any suggestion that he had been the source of certain nineteenth century pamphlets. For about thirty years — from about 1905 to 1934 — he refrained from further illicit productions, his bibliographical authority rose to towering heights, and his earlier apprehensions naturally diminished. In 1934, when confronted by Messrs Carter and Pollard's Enquiry , he promptly brought forward the old defence. In his first public statement, in the Times Literary Supplement of 12 July 1934, he quoted a letter recently sent him by Maurice Buxton Forman, whom (he wrote) he had asked "for any information he could give me regarding his father's store of manuscripts and pamphlets." The son of his old friend had written, in part, I wonder whether Herne Shepherd, and possibly others, knowing how keen he [HBF] was, manufactured small pamphlets with the sole object of planting them on him? It is not a nice thought, but it seems to me by no means improbable. The cost of printing them would not be much, and the few pounds obtained from my father and others would have been ample reward. . . . But the defence, like the Maginot Line, was ineffective. It could not withstand the evidence of text, printing-types, and paper that Carter and Pollard brought forward. It was, in fact, so ineffective that no one has thought to define the careful preparations that seem to have lain beneath it.</field>

Wise, Bibliography of Tennyson (2 vols., 1908), II, 8-19; hereafter cited as Wise. 2 John Carter and Graham Pollard, An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain 19th Century Pamphlets (1934), pp. 307-314; hereafter cited as Enquiry . 3 In his affidavit of 1875 (see below) Tennyson swore that in the year 1830 he had employed Effingham Wilson to print the Tale with a view to its publication. He confused the matter with the printing of his first volume of verse, Poems, Chiefly Lyrical (London: Effingham Wilson, 1830). 4 Wise, I, 27. 5 Six copies are now known; that Hallam mentioned the same number must be regarded as a coincidence. The last census of examples ( Ashley Library , VII, 1925, pp. 106-7) may be briefly indicated, with the necessary additions: (1) W. H. Thompson—Ashley Library; (2) According to the autograph letter by Browning which accompanies it, given by Tennyson to Forster—Browning—Thomas Powell; later Pickering—Locker Lampson—Spoor; sold at the Parke-Bernet Galleries in the W. P. Chrysler, Jr, sale (#344) on 26 February 1952; present location unknown; (3) Tennyson—Gladstone—W. H. Arnold—Huntington Library; (4) Crocker Collection, University of Virginia; (5) Tennyson—D. M. Heath—Heath family—Wise—Maggs—Kern—Owen D. Young—Berg Collection; (6) Name of original recipient erased from titlepage; sold as the property of "an English owner" at the Parke-Bernet Galleries on 10 May 1955 (#440)—Harvard. There exist some proofs of a second printing of the Tale [1868]; since all the three known examples remained in private hands until after Shepherd's death, they can have no significance for this paper. 6 Edgar Johnson, Charles Dickens (1952), pp. 597-598, 671-672. 7 For the reader's convenience I have henceforth punctuated the legal documents I quote, and have introduced capital letters at the beginnings of some sentences that lack them. For my knowledge of the legal documents, and the identification of a number of individuals, I am happy to thank Miss V. J. Ledger. 8 Interpreted, these statements suggest that Pickering asked Shepherd to transcribe the Tale in order that he might describe and quote it in a second edition of Tennysoniana (a Pickering property), whether or not Pickering was successful in retaining the volume in the ensuing re-sale. Shepherd's account throws into extremely debatable territory the ultimate responsibility for his transcription. The second edition of Tennysoniana , published by Pickering in 1879, contains a cautious description of the Tale (pp. 47-51). 9 Edward Tenison Ryan Tenison, M.D. (1829-1904). 10 Josiah Temple of Crown Hill, Norwood, Surrey (1835-1915) was the second son of Frederick Temple, of the Chamberlain's Department in the Guildhall; "he was a man of leisure, and his tastes were literary" ( Norwood News , 12 February 1915). He left an estate of about seven thousand pounds to be divided between a niece and four nephews—one of whom, William Temple Franks, was at the time Controller of H. M.'s Patent Office (P.P.R. 773/1915). In 1875 Shepherd gave a copy of his second reprint of the Tale to W. Evan Franks, Esq., of 8 Thurlow Place, Tulse Hill (i.e., Lower Norwood), and six copies to Josiah Temple, again "for self and friends." In 1879 he dedicated the second edition of Tennysoniana "To J. T., E. H. T., and C. S. F. (Norwood) in token and record of gratitude and affection to themselves and to those who have gone before." 11 R. H. Shepherd, Bibliography of Tennyson (1896), p. 9; hereafter cited as Shepherd. There is a peculiar difficulty connected with the book. In his preface the editor wrote, "Four or five years ago . . . declining health necessitated his [Shepherd's] retirement from active life, and in a retreat at Camberwell his last days were spent in compiling for Notes and Queries a bibliography of Coleridge, and in preparing for the press a bibliography of Tennyson." He had retired to the residence of his brother, James Francis Hollings Shepherd, at "Fern Bank," 35, Broomhouse Road, Fulham, but he died on 15 July 1895, of cancer of the testis and liver, in the Camberwell House Lunatic Asylum. His brother, who had set up in 1892 as a bookdealer under the name of Frank Hollings, published and no doubt edited the posthumous bibliography of Tennyson. The book is slightly confused in method: the important remark here in question has not hitherto been noticed because it appears in an entry concerning The Gem (1831); in the entry concerning his own 1875 reprint of the Tale the minor poems are not listed in quite the correct order; and the collations are not adequate, by modern standards. But Shepherd's explicit statements seem trustworthy. The basis of the work was probably a notebook which Shepherd had kept over many years, prior to his final troubles. 12 Shepherd, p. 50; a statement that the 3 gatherings containing the Tale in the 1870 reprint could be substituted for those in the 1875 reprint "as the pagination is the same". 13 See pp. 129-130. 14 These will be cited as BAR , BPC , and ABPC . 15 For the first, see note 40, (A); for the others, the next note, (3) and (8). 16 (1) Anderson Auction Co., Lapham sale (#1371), 1 Dec 1908 [see (7)]; (2) ditto, H.

Wise in the Original Cloth (1946), pp. 199-204. 20 See note 28. 21 Shepherd later declared that he had also advertised his reprint during April and May 1875 in the Times and Notes and Queries ; these notices have eluded me. 22 The volume (shelfmark 11902.a.36) contains a copy of Tennysoniana (1866) bearing the museum's accession stamp in blue (for an accession under the copyright act) dated 24 August 1867. On the back of the titlepage is pasted a strip bearing inscriptions in two different hands: (a) This had better be inserted in Mr. Shepherd's "Tennysoniana" (b) Presented to the Trustees of the British Museum by Richard Herne Shepherd, 5 Hereford Square, Brompton. May 19th, 1875. At the back of the volume is bound in a copy of the monograph bearing the museum's accession stamp in yellow (for a gift) dated 22 May 1875. Obviously, Shepherd's inscription was intended to refer to the monograph, not the book; and the inscription in another hand was intended to refer to the monograph, not the strip. 23 This volume was among a group of books purchased from Maurice Buxton Forman by Elkin Mathews, Ltd., who advertised it in their catalogue No. 102, of 1948, as item #623. They affirmed that it contained "the poems as recorded by Wise for issues [i.e., editions] 5 and 6"; the statement is incorrect. The volume was purchased by Harvard. In 1874 Swinburne had written an introduction for the second volume of Shepherd's edition of Chapman, and plied him with a good deal of knowledgeable advice and help concerning the texts to be included. Not long before 21 August 1874 Shepherd visited his collaborator at Niton, in the Isle of Wight, and on his return to London he sent back as a gift the 12 volumes making up his (anonymous) editions of Dekker, Glapthorne, and Heywood. After that warm if disproportionate gesture, it is sad to discover that on 9 January 1875 Swinburne wrote of Shepherd to a friend as "a literary hack or a drudge of all work." —Cecil Y. Lang, ed., The Swinburne Letters , II (1959), 192-193; 307-344; 367-368. No doubt Shepherd despatched his gift of The Lover's Tale to Swinburne in August 1875 as a kind of anniversary remembrance. 24 Rowfant Library , Appendix (1900), p. 99. 25 The documents drawn upon are as follows: P.R.O., C.32/338 T.111 (a Register of Documents); C.31/3024/1878 (Affidavit of the Plaintiff); C.31/3024/1877B (Affilidavit of H.J.Smith); C.16/1042/111 (Bill of Complaint); C.33/1244/128 (Interim Injunction); C.16/1042/111 (Interrogatories); C.16/1042/111 (Answer of the Defendant); J.15/1286/150 (Perpetual Injunction); and J.57/3363 (Note of the Taxing Master). The two copies of the 1875 reprint of the Tale which Smith procured in his search for evidence were produced in court. I have been informed by an official that "Exhibits are normally returned to the interested party on completion of the action in which they are brought into court. No unclaimed exhibits of the appropriate date [for Tennyson v. Shepherd] are preserved here." The two copies were therefore claimed by the poet's solicitors, and destroyed with those surrendered by the plaintiff. 26 The entry in Robson's catalogue was quoted in the Bill of Complaint : "420. Tennyson (Alfred). The Lover's Tale, a Fragment (in blank verse), pp. 47; edges uncut, reprint, very neatly bound in half red morocco, 15s. 6d. The above Poem was printed in 1833 and withdrawn before publication; only one copy of the original has ever occurred for sale. The present reprint has now become as scarce as the original; it is believed to have been superintended by the author of 'Tennysoniana.'" In his Answer , Shepherd said that he had himself written the description. 27 In the Answer Shepherd (that is to say, his solicitor) seized upon Tennyson's misstatement mentioned in note 3, and alleged that as the Tale had first been printed by Effingham Wilson and privately distributed in 1830, (a) it was the production of a minor, who could not hold copyright, and (b) a reprint earlier than Shepherd's had been made and distributed—namely, Moxon's, which bears the date 1833. 28 Shelfmark C.28.c.10; the disposition of the museum's stamps dictates the account of the two purchases in April 1875 and January 1876, and makes certain the exact extent of each item involved. The museum's records show that both purchases were made from Shepherd himself. One may suppose that, if Shepherd had not already presented a copy of his monograph to the museum, he would have sold an example of it in January 1876, together with the gathering of minor poems and a copy of the third, rather than the second, version of the preliminary fold, so that the volume made up by the museum from his wares would have been an example of what will be called, below, the fourth, rather than the third, issue of his reprint. 29 Hallam Tennyson, Alfred Lord Tennyson, a Memoir (2 vols. 1897), II, 240. 30 See page 116. 31 See note 10. 32 The Rev. Henry Curwen (1812-1894), Rector of Workington, Cumberland (a family living) from 1837 until his death. Or, more probably, his son of the same name (see DNB). 33 William Thomas Waite (1834-1883), a schoolmaster who took up the study of law in 1870. He was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn in 1876 and "soon rose to notice in criminal practice at the Old Bailey"; in 1879 he won for Shepherd the libel suit which the latter had instituted against the editor of the Athenaeum .— Law Times , 75 (1883-1884), p. 285. 34 As the statement stands, the total should be 31 (not 30) given, plus 15 sold; that is, 46 (not 45) in all. No doubt Shepherd remembered and inserted the name of one recipient of a gift copy, and forgot to change the total of gifts unrecollected. 35 Mr John Carter has written ( ABC for Book Collectors , 3rd ed., 1961, p. 120), "the onus of proof that an observed variation derives from a deliberate action taken after publication lies, or should lie, like an iron weight on the conscience of anyone who begins to write the word issue ." I define the date of publication, somewhat arbitrarily, as 21 April 1875, when Shepherd sold an example to the British Museum. The gathering of minor poems may reasonably be supposed to have been produced in the latter half of July. 36 Some ambiguity of terminology seems unavoidable in the unusual circumstances; namely, that this group of three gatherings was both (a) sold separately, when it should be called a pamphlet, and (b) sold as a component of a volume, when it should not. The monograph presents a similar case. 37 See note 10. 38 Mr W. H. Bond informs me that the four component parts of the Harvard copy can be distinguished by their papers. That of the preliminary fold is yellowest and has the closest-woven graining; that bearing the monograph is smoothest and whitest; that bearing the Tale itself is heaviest, roughest, and stiffest. These distinctions are observable in the Berg copy. 39 (A) (1) Sotheby's, Dr Seward Bliss sale (#295), 26 March 1900—"mor. extra, g.t., by Riviere"; (2) resold Bangs, misc (#543), 14 Nov 1900.

This could have been an example of the second issue of the Tale , 1875, in which the final gathering had been replaced by a copy of the 32-page pamphlet of minor poems, the only such collection possessing a half-title. (2) See note 18, (D). The editor of BAR, after a personal inspection, referred huffily to the note in BPC and described the item as an example of Wise's "Fifth Pirated Edition: 1875." If this decision was just, the item consisted of an example of some reprint of the Tale , lacking any preliminary fold, with a copy of the 32-page pamphlet of minor poems. But see below. 45 "Here often as a child I lay reclined"; The War ; 1865-1866 . 46 "Ah, God, the petty fools of rhyme" [called Afterthought , and Literary Squabbles ]; On a Spiteful Letter ; The Third of February , 1852 ; Ode for the Opening of the International Exhibition ; On Translations of Homer [i.e., Experiment in Quantity ("These lame hexameters the strong-wing'd music of Homer")]. 47 Livingston, p. 68; Wise, II, 20-21. 48 For example: Overprintings —p. 5, line 2, old Rhodes (both o's and the first d overprinted); p. 15, line 7, yours (diagonal blur to upper right within u); p. 18, line 1, part (last three letters overprinted); p. 23, line 16, manly (all letters overprinted).

Parsonage of Lathrop C. Harper, Inc., has kindly confirmed the sale to Mr Chapin. He was unable to tell me the source of the copy. "I can say quite certainly, however, that we never handled another copy, as Mr. Harper dealt exclusively in American History and Incunabula, handling literature but rarely on an occasional courtesy basis for a special customer." 50 Enquiry , pp. 44, 46-47; Graham Pollard, in Thomas J. Wise: Centenary Studies (1959), p. 39. 51 See Wise, II, 8, note. 52 The monograph itself is undated. Wise seems to have sought to create further confusion by appending to it in his forgery the date " August , 1870." This was the correct month for the production of Shepherd's 1870 reprint, as we know from Shepherd's Answer ; it does not seem possible to say how Wise can have known it. 52a As has been related above, the list of of poems in the 32-page pamphlet seems to have been copied from the second part of Shepherd's 1870 reprint or (more probably) arranged to fit Shepherd's casual description of that reprint. It is difficult to see why this group of poems was used in the manufacture of a pamphlet supposedly of 1875. Perhaps the list was made out about 1890 for use in the forged "First Pirated Edition"; its use then decided against; and the list found and used about 1898 when its exact nature had been forgotten. 53 Partington, p. 79. 54 William B. Todd, ed., Thomas J. Wise , Centenary Studies (1959), pp. 117-121. 55 Todd, p. 70. 56 The point was envisaged by Carter and Pollard ( Enquiry , p. 314).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Quantitative Solution of the Ambiguity of Three Texts by Antonín Hrubý</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The traditional critical methods founded more or less on the principles of the Lachmanian school are unable to deal with the difficulties encountered by a textual critic. Awareness of this fact has had a profound influence on editorial practices of our times, especially in the field of medieval literature. Present practice favors the printing of a basic manuscript; and, if a contemporary editor tries at all to reconstruct a critical text, or if he tries to base certain theories and explanations on the results of textual criticism, he does so with the greatest apologies for his method and cannot refrain from stressing the subjective character of such an attempt. 1 Studies in textual criticism are not lacking, but a closer examination shows that with few exceptions scholars are today mainly concerned with the practical difficulties of applying the old principles of textual criticism and show a rather limited interest in purely theoretical problems. 2 This attitude seems to be the result of a radical skepticism over an objective method in textual criticism, independently expressed in about 1913 in two related disciplines of philology. At that time, a series of students of classical philology based their criticism of the traditional Lachmanian system on their experiences with papyruses, 3 and in the field of modern philology, Joseph Bédier explained in the introduction to his second edition of Jean Renart's Le Lai de l'Ombre the reasons which led him to repudiate the editorial practice of his time, his own previous attempts to establish the stemma of the lai and his decision to base the new edition mainly on a single manuscript. 4 Though only a classical philologist can really judge the intricate questions raised by the papyrologists, even an outsider can recognize that classical philology reacted to the skepticism over method in a quite different manner from the medievalists. It is the general conclusion of the former that textual criticism is based on sure methods, the validity of which has not been weakened by denials of its authority; that the criterion of "common error" is only one of the indices which permit an objective criticism, and that its admitted inadequacy must be overcome by the strictest restriction of its use and definition 5 and by a systematic study of all the other indices which are available for retracing the history of the text. 6 Many studies, following the examples of A. C. Clark and Louis Havet, 7 proceed therefore to a systematic investigation of indices permitting one to retrace the history of the text and to arrive at a critical canon. 8 The most interesting result of this evolution of classical studies is the almost unanimous agreement of the critics that objective criticism can be achieved and that the notion of "basic manuscript" and the practice of editing the so-called "best" manuscript in the most conservative manner has to be rejected. 9 The medievalists are quite unanimous in a contrary view. Their practice favors following the "best" manuscript as closely as possible, and even such exhaustive studies of manuscript tradition as those by A. Micha, A. Henry or B. Edwards, result finally in a conservative reproduction of the basic manuscript. 10 The editing of a basic manuscript is based on the opinion that even the corrections of a scribe have their historical value and, at the same time, on the disbelief that the modern editor could achieve a better text through methodical recension than his medieval colleague could through sheer inspiration. 11 The opinion that any attempt to evolve a methodical reconstruction of a text with the present knowledge can only do damage to its authenticity, has been stated most explicity by Mario Roques, 12 but almost the same argument against the critical reconstruction of the text and the same methodical skepticism had been expressed already fifty years ago by Joseph Bédier: " Bref, nous renonçons à proposer un classement de nos manuscrits; non pas qu'il soit difficile d'en proposer un, . . . mais au contraire parce qu'il est trop facile d'en proposer plusiers " ( Op. cit. , p. xli.) The main reason for the pronounced skepticism of the medievalists lies, to be sure, in the fact that in modern philology the traditional criterion of common error is even less applicable then in the classical branch. The impossibility of using the notion of error in medieval texts as a discriminatory criterion for establishing the manuscript families has been stated again and again. A. Micha indicates, for example, that in all the numerous manuscripts of the no less numerous romances of Chrétien de Troyes he has found not one single clearly erroneous passage which has the necessary discriminatory value; 13 and, B. Edwards has made a similar statement concerning the eight manuscripts of Gui de Cambrai's Vengement Alixandre ( A classification , p. 241). In A. Henry's introduction to the works of Adenet Le Roi, one can read of the difficulties of searching for a "discriminatory passage" in words which attest the professional honesty and care which the editor lavished upon the work of his choice ( Adenet le Roi , I, p. 89). Although the attitude of all the students of medieval philology is not always equally negative, 14 it appears nevertheless, that the skepticism of the medievalists is due not only to the difficulties of the problem, but equally to the fact that they think and work under the spell of the powerful personality of Joseph Bédier and leave unexploited the truly revolutionary innovations of the method, introduced into the matter namely by dom Henri Quentin, Sir Walter William Greg, and Jean Fourquet. Joseph Bédier has treated the problems implied by textual criticism and the establishment of the genealogical stemma twice; first, in his introduction to the second edition of Jean Renart's Lai de l'Ombre and, fifteen years later, in his well known article in Romania . 15 In both studies, he explains the reasons which induced him to repudiate the traditional critical method and to reproduce as closely as possible one single manuscript. One of his reasons is revealed by his unusual observation that the application of Lachmanian principles almost inevitably leads to the construction of a dichotomous stemma. Since it is extremely unlikely that all of our extant manuscripts should invariably belong to only two genetical groups, Bédier concluded that there is a hidden fallacy ( un vice caché , as he says) in the method itself, which allows the editor to construct a dichotomous stemma, whenever he wishes. Bédier's second argument against the Lachmanian system is even more revealing. When Gaston Paris proposed a three-branch stemma in his review of Bédier's first edition of the Lai de l'Ombre ( Rom , XIX, 611), Bédier, his confidence shaken in his own dichotomous solution, discovered to his surprise that he was able to construct as many as eleven different stemmata, all of which explain the facts equally well. As a reason for this profusion of different hypotheses, he reveals correctly the basic impossibility of establishing the genealogical relationship of three witnesses without using a qualitative criterion: Unless the criteria obtained by the internal critique of the variants are opposed to it, one may always suppose two points of connection, rather than one, between two manuscripts or two groups of manuscripts; in other words, one may represent by a straight line or by a broken line any one of the lines which connect the extant manuscripts to the archetype X; thus, one may write ( Rom , LIV, 338): It is extremely interesting to note that Bédier describes here a basic fact which he discovered more or less intuitively and which, only a year before, W. W. Greg described and analyzed in his Calculus of Variants . 16 It is beyond doubt that both scholars discovered this principle, called by Greg quite appropriately the ambiguity of three texts , independently of each other. W. W. Greg formulated the principle of the ambiguity of three texts as a result of a thorough analysis of the problem of interpreting the variational groupings of manuscripts and has shown that it is impossible to determine the lineage of three extant manuscripts on logical grounds alone: "where three manuscripts only are concerned, no merely formal process can throw light on the relationship between them. Either the readings will be all divergent or else the variant will be of type 1 [i.e.: A : BC, B : AC and C : AB], and since, in the latter case, the reading of the single divergent manuscript may always (theoretically at least) be unoriginal, it will never be possible to establish a common source for any pair of manuscripts to the exclusion of the third. Given three manuscripts, therefore, it is impossible either to prove or to disprove independent derivation. This fact, which I call the ambiguity of three texts , we shall find, meets us at every turn of the discussion, and it largely determines the nature of the calculus" ( Calculus , p. 21). We have quoted both passages in some length because they both reveal very clearly the essential problem implied by any attempt to apply a rigorous method in establishing the genealogical relationship of extant manuscripts. Since the problem remains basically the same whether we deal with three, four, or more manuscripts, it becomes apparent that an objectively valid methodology can be developed for this branch of philology only to the extent to which it will be possible to overcome the ambiguity of three texts. Unfortunately, however, neither Bédier nor Greg attacked directly the problem which they recognized with such a clarity. Bédier concluded that, due to the inadequacy of the textual evidence, the problem is in practice insoluble; he therefore elevated the critics own taste, his knowledge and education, the goût as the only valid criterion of textual criticism, and had the fortune to form a school. Greg's Calculus on the contrary, has never been in favor with the textual critics. 17 The truly revolutionary importance of Greg's achievement, however, lies in the fact that Greg presented for the first time in the history of textual criticism a complete theory of interpreting the variational groupings and thereby created conditions for further investigation. Yet, he did not push his analysis far enough to recognize the intricate complexity between the frequencies of the variational groupings and their genealogical causes. Greg therefore overestimated the indicative value of certain variational groupings which he called simple or also, quite symptomatically, constant significant groupings. Believing that there is no formal solution to the problem of the ambiguity of three texts, Greg accepted as a practical expedient the notion of originality, although he knew from experience that this criterion has only exceptionally the required distinctive value ( Calculus , p. 53f). Both quotations also show that given three extant collaterals, the critic will have to decide almost invariably between four hypotheses and it is generally recognized that with the help of the present techniques and criteria such a decision is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Greg's analysis of the ambiguity of three texts, on the other hand, reveals that the problem is completely insoluble on logical grounds alone. There is a tacit agreement among the critics that with a growing number of witnesses the decision might become eventually less difficult and for this reason Greg himself uses a group of six manuscripts to demonstrate his method of interpreting the variational groupings. This belief, however, is based on an incomplete analysis of the problem and is in reality unjustified. If, for instance, four collaterals are given and if they offer the variational evidence of two branches, i.e., they show a persistent variation AB : CD, then the number of hypothetical solutions grows to twenty, seven of them being significant with regard to the genealogy of the witnesses: In the absence of some clearly distinctive criteria, any of the seven above stemmata accounts equally well for the variational evidence, obtained by the comparison of four collaterals. If there is insufficient evidence for the two branches, the number of possible significant stemmata grows to twenty-five. In the case of six collaterals, with variational evidence of the branches AB : CD : EF, the number of significant solutions is twenty-one and it grows to over three hundred in case the branches cannot be distinctly determined. Since our distinctive criteria remain equally unreliable in either of these cases, the difficulty of the solution obviously does not decrease, but increases with the growing number of witnesses. There is evidently little hope that the present criteria of common, peculiar, indicative, conjunctive and separative errors, the notions of originality and of directional variation, or even the different indices obtained from external evidence, will help the critic to eliminate several hundred hypothetical possibilities, especially if usually he does not even suspect their existence. We see thus that in the absence of a formal way of overcoming the ambiguity of three texts, any system designed for the purpose of establishing the genealogical relationship of a given group of extant manuscripts is condemned to remain a mere technique, the validity of which will be determined by the validity of the assumptions introduced by the critic at the outset. It is therefore of great interest to investigate whether the unreliable and often subjective qualitative criteria may be excluded and whether a different approach to the problem permits us to overcome the ambiguity of three texts by a formal distinction. Since the only objective information with which the critic is left after excluding the qualitative criteria consists of statistical data concerning different types of agreements and disagreements between the compared witnesses; since this kind of information is of a distinctive quantitative character; and, finally, since the absolute majority of the changes introduced by the different scribes is random, an interpretation of the statistics of variational groupings by means of probability calculus appears at the outset a rather appropriate method for approaching the problem. The idea of using statistics and probability calculus in textual criticism is not new. Statistics were used, to the best of my knowledge, for the first time by Dom Henri Quentin in 1926, whereas the probability calculus was used as far back as 1876 by Hermann Paul. In 1945, Jean Fourquet reintroduced the calculus of probability into the matter; atfer Fourquet, the probability calculus has been applied by Whitehead and Pickford and more recently by Castellani. 18 In all these cases, the quantitative approach has served as a means of demonstrating an argument of a highly speculative character, and their results are therefore of no help for us. 19 However, although no attempt has been made as yet to attack the basic problem of the ambiguity of three texts, the following demonstration would have been impossible without the methodological innovations of Greg, Quentin, and Fourquet. Reduced to its basic form, our problem is thus the following: is it possible, given three extant manuscripts, to obtain evidence about their way of descent from their common ancestor? To save time, we exclude all ancestral and mixed genealogies from our consideration. Excluded are thus the following types of descent and their permutations: The types 1-3 can be easily identified by the fact that the extreme members of these groups cannot possibly agree (in theory at least) against their intermediary. Type number 4 can be determined only by a judgment of value concerning the originality and the directional value of the variations A : BC. 20 After these exclusions, there are then for us only two possible types of derivation of three extant manuscripts: 21 We see at the first glance that none of the six possible permutations of the first scheme (namely: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA) is genealogically significant. In successive derivation, three out of the six possible permutations are significant, since in the second scheme ABC, BAC, CAB are genealogically identical to ACB, BCA, CBA, respectively. The character of the problem, however, remains the same in all three significant permutations of the successive derivation. It follows that the problem of the ambiguity of three texts will be solved if there is a formal way of distinguishing between independent and successive derivation. By comparing three extant manuscripts, the critic gathers complete statistics of five different types of agreements and disagreements between the readings of the witnesses. Let us call them variations (not variants) and assign to them the symbols v 1 , v 2 , etc.: v 1 = ABC v 2 = AB : C v 3 = AC : B v 4 = CB : A v 5 = A : B : C These five variations remain the same when we deal with three collaterals whether they are derived independently or successively. The observable phenomena contain therefore, as we already pointed out, no indication of the genealogy of the manuscripts, if the critic abstains from using a judgment of value. 22 We know, however, that the observable variations must be produced in quite a different way in either type of derivation. In order to be able to proceed to a phenomenological analysis of our five variations, we have to introduce at this point a certain number of postulates and assumptions which have the function to eliminate, at the outset, extreme logical and technical complications: 1. The postulate that all extant manuscripts of a given work are derived by transcription from a single original. 2. The assumption of universal, persistent, and spontaneous variation. 3. The assumption of an archetype with no recognizable errors. 4. The postulate of impossibility of convergent variation and of uncontaminated tradition. The extent of this report forbids me to comment on the implications of the preceding assumptions and postulates, but even without any additional explanation their character as mere working hypotheses is sufficiently clear. None of them is necessarily true, and every critic knows that especially the last one has very little chance to correspond to the reality; their only function thus is to permit us to create a scale of hypothetical norms which gives us the possibility of stating and defining, at a later stage, the "irregularities" of real cases. Our assumptions and postulates should therefore by no means be accepted as principles and the ultimate elimination of their implications becomes a necessity before attempting to establish the stemma of any actual group of extant manuscripts. We shall now analyze, under the aforementioned assumptions and postulates, the generation of the observable variations in the hypothetical case of independent derivation. In such a case of derivation, all three witnesses descend directly from the archetype "A". They are not necessarily direct copies of it and we know that an undetermined number of lost hypothetical manuscripts may be placed on the lines connecting "A" with A, B, and C. However, since all the changes introduced by the hypothetical manuscripts appear to us as changes of their terminal descendants, we can disregard the existence of the hypothetical manuscripts without affecting the correctness of our analysis. We can then say that, in case of independent derivation, all three scribes copy a certain given number of words contained in their common exemplar "A", the archetype. Since, from the point of view of the descendants, all words of "A" are "original", let us assign to them the symbol o. According to assumption two, the scribes of A, B, C, preserve a certain number of o and they change another number of them to, say, a , b , and c , respectively. The variation v 1 is then generated whenever all three scribes preserve accidentally—according to 2 and 3—one and the same word of the archetype without change. The variations v 2 , v 3 , v 4 , are produced whenever two scribes preserve o and the third introduces a change of his own in any particular word of the archetype. The variation v 5 arises whenever at least two, or else all three scribes, introduce a change in any particular word reading o . In successive derivation, the manuscripts A and X, descending directly from the archetype, will preserve a number of o and change another number of them to a and x , respectively. The scribes of B and C then find in their common exemplar not only o , preserved by X, but also a certain number of x . They will then preserve a number of o and change another number of them to, say, b o , c o , respectively; also, they will preserve a number of x and change another number to, say, b x , c x , respectively. It must be noted that the generation of b x and c x is genealogically determined by the existence of x ; as a consequence, one may very well find them, when comparing three witnesses, in variation with o or a of A, but obviously they never can be found in variation with o , b o , c o , of C and B. We then can observe that in successive derivation, the variations v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , are generated in exactly the same way as the identical variations of independent derivation. The variation v 4 , however, will be generated in two additional cases, namely, whenever x , preserved both by B and C, meets through collation either with a or o of A. Compared to independent derivation, the variation v 5 has in successive derivation six additional chances of arising, namely, whenever b x c x , b x x , xc x , of BC meet through collation either with a or with o of A. Graphically we can express these facts in the following way: The table shows clearly that the five observable variations represent in either case of derivation quite different combinations of original and nonoriginal readings. Since in practice it is difficult or impossible to distinguish the original readings of the archetype and the changes of the different scribes, these combinations cannot be observed by the eye; but, they can be distinguished conceptually, and we know with certitude that they exist. We called the observable combinations variations ; let us call those which can be distinguished only conceptually variants . We then can say that v 1 , v 2 , v 3 , are in both types of derivation identical; we shall call them simple variations , because they each represent only one possible variant. In independent derivation, v 4 also is a simple variation, whereas in successive derivation v 4 is a compound variation and represents three possible variants. The variation v 5 represents four possible variants in independent derivation and ten variants in successive derivation. The preceding statements already show the importance of the quantitative factor in our problem. We can expect that the difference between a simple and compound variation, although not observable by the eye, must be reflected by a difference in its frequency. We also notice that, with regard to independent derivation, in successive derivation the presence of X changes the character and therefore the frequencies of the variations. Finally, we see that the observable data obtained by a comparison of the witnesses, i.e. the variations, are causally determined, on the one hand, by the changes introduced by the scribes, and, on the other hand, by the genealogical relationship of the different extant and lost manuscripts of the group. If we then can express the expectancies of the different variations in both our types of derivation in mathematical terms, we should be able to "observe" the difference in the frequency of the variations produced by the presence of X. Such a possibility appears to be secured by the fact that all the extant manuscripts are descendants of one archetype, no matter how they are derived, and the total number of variations therefore may be conceived of as equal to the total number of potential changes contained in the archetype; the sum of the rates of variations is then a constant in any case of derivation. Thus, we can expect that the problem of the genealogy of three extant manuscripts will be soluble mathematically under the condition that the number of unknown factors does not exceed the number of independent bits of information offered by the statistics. 23 To illustrate the preceding reasoning by a less abstract example, let us assume that we compared three states of one text and that we found the variation v 1 six hundred times, and the variations v 2 , v 3 , v 4 , v 5 , one hundred times each. We then know that the total number of potential changes contained in the archetype of our three witnesses was: 600 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 1,000. Since it is more convenient to use rates in computations rather than integers, we express the preceding statement by saying that the rate of v 1 is 600/1,000, and that the rates of the remaining four variations are 100/1,000 each. The same can be expressed even more conveniently in decimal numbers, and we then can write that, in our case, the sum of the rates of the five possible variations is: 0.6 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 1.0. In order to express this statement in general terms, we set the rate of v 1 = f 1 , v 2 = f 2 , etc. We then can state that in any case of derivation of three manuscripts the following must be true: f 1 + f 2 + f 3 + f 4 + f 5 = 1. Let us now consider the case of a single scribe and let us again assume that his exemplar contained 1,000 potential changes; let us also assume that this particular scribe actually realized 100 out of the 1,000 possible changes and therefore necessarily preserved the version of his exemplar in the 900 remaining cases. The rate of the realized changes is then in our particular case 0.1, and the rate of unrealized changes is 0.9. One of the two possible variables is thus determined by the fact that the sum of the realized and unrealized changes of any particular transcript must be equal to the total number of potential changes contained in the exemplar (in our hypothetical case: 100 + 900 = 1,000), and that the sum of these rates must therefore be equal 1 (in our case: 0.1 + 0.9 = 1). To express this fact in general terms, we set the numerical value of potential changes contained in any archetype as n , the value of changes introduced by any transcript as p , and the value of its unrealized possible changes as q . The following relation then must be true: p + q = n . The immediate consequence of this definition is that P p + P q = 1, where P p represents the rate of realized, and P q the rate of unrealized changes of a particular transcript. The preceding statement implies that the following must be equally true: P q = 1—P p . If we then set the P p rates of our three witnesses as Pa, Pb, Pc, respectively, we know that the corresponding rates of preservation must be (1 — Pa), (1 — Pb), (1 — Pc), respectively. To make the quantitative analysis of our problem possible, we have now to introduce the notion of probability. Mathematical probability may be defined most conveniently for us as the ratio of the number of actual occurrences of an event to the number of possible occurrences. The laws of probability tell us that if two events occur independently of each other, and if each event has a certain probability of happening, the chances of the events combined occurrence are equal to the product of their respective probabilities. Applied to textual transmission this means that if the scribe A preserves his copy readings at the rate of 0.9, and the scribe B preserves his copy readings at the rate of 0.8, the chance that A and B will preserve the copy reading at any given point is calculated by multiplying the two probabilities: 0.9 X 0.8 = 0.72. In other words, any given point of the copied text has the probability 0.72 of being preserved by both our scribes. That is to say that, in such a case, the rate of variation AB (that is: oo , say v 1 ) is f 1 = 0.72. This implies that one may expect the variation v 1 to appear in the statistics 72 times, in case the archetype contained 100 potential changes, 720 times, if the archetype contained 1,000 potential changes. Since the chances of the combined occurrence of any number of independent events are equal to the product of their respective probabilities, we can easily spell out the expectancies of the different variations in independent as well as in successive derivation. The variation v 1 , for instance, can be expected to appear in the statistics produced by the comparison of three witnesses at the rate f 1 = (1—Pa) (1—Pb) (1—Pc), when dealing with independent derivation, whereas in successive derivation the expectancy of f 1 is only (1 — Pa) (1 — Px) (1 — Pb) (1 — Pc), because the preservation rate of B and C is, as shown by our preceding analysis, in such a case determined by the preservation rate of X. Analogically we then know that the expectancy of f 2 is (1—Pa) (1—Pb) Pc, in independent derivation, and only (1—Pa) (1—Px) (1—Pb) Pc in successive derivation. In order to illustrate the different frequencies of the variations by a less abstract example, let us consider the hypothetical case of three collaterals and assume that we know all the unknown facts and factors. Let us thus assume that the archetype "A" consisted of one thousand words and that each of these words constitutes one potential change. 24 Let us further assume that every scribe changes a constant number of words, say one hundred out of thousand. The rates of change Pa, Pb, Pc, Px, are thus in our hypothetical case all equal and have the numerical value of 1/10; the respective rates of preservation (1 — Pa), (1 — Px), etc., must therefore in our case all be: 1—1/10 = 9/10. This is to say that in independent derivation the expected rate f 1 is: 0.9 X 0.9 X 0.9 = 0.729; whereas in successive derivation the expected rate f 1 is only: 0.9 X 0.9 X 0.9 X 0.9 = 0.6561. Similarly, we can expect v 2 to appear in the statistics at the rate of 0.081 in independent, and only at the rate of 0.0729 in successive derivation. If then the archetype really had only 1,000 words and all scribes really realized the identical rate of change of 1/10, the critic comparing three witnesses derived independently would find the variation ABC 1,000 X 0.729 = 729 times, the variation AB : C 1,000 X 0.081 = 81 times. If, on the contrary, the critic was comparing three witnesses derived successively, he would find the variation ABC only 1,000 X 0.6561 = 656 times, and the variation AB : C only 1,000 X 0.0729 = 73 times. In our hypothetical case, he would thus be able to identify easily independent and successive derivation by the respectively higher and lower rates f 1 and f 2 . In reality, however, the rates of change are variables, and the identification of the two types of derivation is therefore somewhat more difficult to carry out, although its principle remains basically the same. We noticed already that the most characteristic difference between the two types of derivation lies in the fact that the variation v4 is simple in independent and compound in successive derivation. If we then estimate the frequency of v 4 in successive derivation, we must not assume—as we did in the preceding simplified hypothetical case—that the scribes B and C realize the same rate of change in copying the errors and changes introduced by their exemplar X, as in copying the readings of the archetype, preserved by X. Such an assumption is, to be sure, most unlikely to correspond to reality; first, because even the most inattentive scribe will introduce a certain number of his own emendations, and second, because there might be another number of changes and emendations caused by the scribe's recollection of other versions of the text. Whatever the scribe's psychological reasons might be, however, they are irrelevant with regard to the frequency of v 4 in successive derivation. The only relevant factor in our context is the fact that the presence of X in successive derivation may influence the rates of B and C, whereas in independent derivation such a possibility is not given at all . We thus express this new fact by adopting, in successive derivation, the rates Pb 1 , Pc 1 , for changing o , and the rates Pb 2 , Pc 2 , for changing x ; the corresponding rates of preserving o and x are then: (1—Pb 1 ), (1—Pc 1 ), and (1—Pb 2 ), (1—Pc 2 ), respectively: 25 The preceding table shows very clearly that the case of independent derivation must be soluble mathematically, because the statistics offer four bits of independent information (namely: the frequencies f 1 , f 2 , f 3 , f 4 ), and the case has only three possible variables. In successive derivation, on the other hand, it is impossible to compute all variables, because there are six possible variables and still only four independent bits of information. The case of successive derivation is then mathematically insoluble, and this fact, secured by our analysis of the observable phenomena, permits us to make the desired distinction between the two types of derivation. We see, for instance, that the four equations of independent derivation can be solved for the values of the three variables by straight computation: It is more convenient for us, however, to solve the equations for the corresponding rates of preservation: In the same way, we compute: The case of successive derivation is different. Given the four equations of table III and six variables, we can compute the two following variables only: The third operation, however, which in independent derivation allowed us to compute the variable (1-Pa), will in successive derivation yield the following result: The preceding facts, secured by our analysis, offer us the possibility of making the desired distinction between independent and successive derivation. For instance, as far as independent derivation is concerned, we know that: Therefore, we know that in independent derivation the following relation must be true: The same relation is expressed by writing: On the other hand we know that in successive derivation, the same operation cannot possibly yield the result equal 1, because we are unable to compute the correct value (1—Pa). The operation will therefore give the following result in successive derivation (compare Table III): We see thus that the above operation can be considered as a test operation and that the result equal 1 identifies the independent, whereas the result not equal 1 identifies the successive derivation. We shall now demonstrate in theory the functioning of the identification test by comparing one hypothetical case of independent and one of successive derivation. Let us again assume that the archetype contained 1,000 potential changes and that we know all the unknown facts and factors. The examples thus show that, in agreement with our theoretical expectation, the test result allows us to identify the case of independent derivation as well as the case of successive derivation. This simple test therefore permits us to prove or disprove independent derivation and thereby overcome the ambiguity of three texts. Since the ambiguity remains the same whether we deal with three or more texts, we may conclude that the quantitative solution, demonstrated here on three manuscripts only, may be applicable to any number of extant manuscripts. From Joseph Bédier's demonstration and W. W. Greg's analysis of the problem, we retained that neither the methods based on qualitative criteria nor the application of logic permit us to make a formal distinction between the two basic types of derivation. The application of probability calculus, on the contrary, promises to place the methodology of textual criticism on a different ground because it offers, in theory at least, the possibility of overcoming the ambiguity of three texts by a formal distinction. In order to illustrate the preceding abstract reasoning by examples which speak more directly to our imagination and to demonstrate at the same time the practical applicability of the proposed method, we shall now apply the identification test to four manuscripts belonging to the family of Jean Renart's, Le Lai de l'Ombre . 26 It is the same family which served Bédier as a basis for his repudiation of the traditional methods. Although we are using an actual case to substantiate the following demonstration, our interest remains predominantly theoretical. It is not our concern here to analyze the problems and intricacies of the practical application of the proposed method, and we shall therefore concentrate on those aspects of the actual case only, which permit us to verify the validity of the preceding deductions. In order to save lengthy explanations and to allow us a better control of the demonstration, we shall create a hypothetical group which, according to my results, is analogous to the manuscripts A, B, D, F, of the actual Lai de l'Ombre family. A simple comparison of both cases will then provide a sufficient basis for judging the verification value of the different operations. Let us thus assume that we are faced with the manuscripts A, B, D, F, and that we again know all the unknown facts and factors. We then assume that the genealogical relationship of our four witnesses is defined by the following stemma: We therefore know that the four witnesses, considered by groups of three manuscripts, must form two groups independently and two groups successively derived: We also know that in such a case, the comparison of the witnesses by groups of three manuscripts will produce the usual five variations which we define in the following way: 2. Group ABF The variations, variants and rates of group ABF are analogous to the ones of group ABD. We obtain them by using Table VI and writing: F, f o , f x , Pf 1 , Pf 2 , instead of D, d o , d x , Pd 1 , Pd 2 , respectively. 3. Group ADF The definition of group ADF is obtained by following the model of successive derivation, Table III, and by writing D, F, d, f , Pd 1 , Pd 2 , Pf 1 , Pf 2 , instead of: B, C, b, c , Pb 1 , Pb 2 , Pc 1 , Pc 2 , respectively. 4. Group BDF The definition of group BDF is obtained by following Table III and by writing in addition to all the substitutions of group ADF: B, b , and Pb, instead of A, a , and Pa. If we now assign specific values to all the variables, we can easily compute the expected rates of variations in all four groups by following the above indications. Let us therefore assume that, in copying their respective exemplars, the scribes A, B, D, F, and X, realized the following rates of change: Under these circumstances then, the statistics will read as follows: As a next step, we apply the test operation and obtain the following results: --&gt; The results of the tests allow us, as we see, to identify the four partial stemmata which we have drawn in diagram 6, and thereby to determine exactly the genealogical relationship of the manuscripts A, B, D, F, because we are able to draw the composite scheme which, in this hypothetical case, we chose as a definition of our example. Now, we want to compare the hypothetical case to the four actual manuscripts of the Lai de l'Ombre family. Before dealing with actual manuscript groups, however, we must deal, at least briefly, with the implications of our postulates and assumptions. 27 Postulate number one need not concern us here, because its specific implications do not affect the validity of our analysis nor the possibility of applying probability calculus for interpreting the statistics. 28 Assumption number two also creates no additional problem, since any transcript failing to satisfy it is identical with its exemplar and therefore mechanically assumes its function and position in the genealogical scheme. Different are the implications of assumption number three, because the possibility of a heavily corrupted archetype certainly cannot be ruled out. If such were the case, the critic would encounter complications which would make it difficult or even impossible to identify the genealogy of the witnesses. Since we are not concerned here with the limits of the application, but rather with the correctness of the theory in general, I have chosen, in order to prevent lengthy explanations, an unproblematic example in which the corruption of the archetype is so small that it has no effect on the calculus. Assumption number four has little chance to correspond to reality because uncontaminated families and families without convergent variation seem to be extremely rare in practice. The problem of contamination and convergent variation is therefore a major problem of any critical method. I must here refer to my report on "Statistical Methods in Textual Criticism," where I have analyzed the problems of the practical application of this theory and proposed a technique of dealing with contamination by mechanical dissolution of the conflicts. 29 In order to give to the reader the possibility of judging the extent of the dissolution as well as its effect on the calculus, we shall list the statistics and the results of the test both before and after the dissolution of the conflicts: In the last line are listed, under the heading test , the differences with regard to the test value one. The comparison of the tables shows that even in the undissolved form, the test result has a tendency to approach much closer to the value one in groups ABD, ABF, than in groups ADF, BDF. Since, on the other hand, the test result for ADF, BDF, remains practically the same before as well as after the dissolution, it appears from our example that the dissolution of conflicts does not radically change the results, but rather clarifies and specifies their meaning by eliminating, at least partially, the irregularities caused by contamination or convergent variation. 30 In the dissolved table, the difference from one is in groups ABD, ABF so small that it can certainly be disregarded without forcing the results. 31 The test result being .999 on the one side, and .965 on the other, we have in our case a comfortable difference of .034, which at any rate gives us the right of reading the former as equal one, and the latter as not equal one. On this basis, then, we can infer the existence of the exclusive common ancestor X for the manuscripts D and F, and its absence for A and B. Our four groups therefore appear to have the following partial stemmata: These four partial stemmata can be overlayed only in one possible way: The stemma of the actual Lai de l'Ombre group being the same as the stemma of our hypothetical case, we have obtained a solid basis of comparison and can now investigate whether the results of the tests can be verified. Actually, there exist additional ways of crosschecking the result of the quantitative solution. The principle of the ambiguity of three texts suggests, for instance, that from the standpoint of logic any three manuscripts successively derived may be regarded as manuscripts derived independently; we know from our preceding analysis that a higher frequency of the variation A : DF, or B : DF can be produced by the changes introduced by X in successive derivation, as well as by a higher rate of A, or B in independent derivation. For this reason, independent and successive derivation are, logically, ambiguous and our result: can therefore be also represented in the following way: These graphs then indicate that, if the groups ADF and BDF are really successively derived; and, if we compute the variables under the wrong hypothesis that they form an independently derived group, we must expect to compute an apparent rate of change for A and B, augmented by the changes introduced in reality by X. On the other hand, we also know that, if our resulting stemma for ABDF is to be correct, the inferential manuscript X actually lies on the line between "A" and DF and remains undetected in groups ABD and ABF only because the manuscripts D and F are compared, in these groups, with AB without the other member of the branch X. We therefore must again expect that the rates computed for D and F will be apparent rates, augmented by the number of changes introduced by X. If we then base our schemes on logical analysis only, we may represent the relationship of our four witnesses by the following graphs: These graphs then indicate clearly that we may treat any group of three manuscripts as independent derivation and proceed to the operations which are expected to produce the values of the variables: --&gt; However, if the results of our identification tests are to be correct, we must expect that the above operations will yield in our actual case: 1. the correct values Pa, Pb, if computed from the groups ABD, ABF, because these groups actually are independent groups and because X does not lie between "A" and A or B (comp. table II, under f 4 , f 3 ). 2. the correct values Pd 1 , Pf 1 , if computed from groups ADF, BDF, because these groups actually are successive groups, allowing the computation of the rates of change realized by the copies of X (comp. table III, under f 3 , f 2 ). 3. the apparent values Pd 1 , Pf 1 , augmented by the changes introduced by X, if computed from groups ABD, ABF, because these groups actually are independent groups in which X lies between "A" and D or F (compare table VI, under f 2 ). 4. the apparent values Pa, Pb, augmented, more or less, by the changes introduced by X, if computed from the groups ADF, BDF; these groups actually are successive groups, but by treating them as independent groups, we ascribe to A and B the changes introduced in reality by X (principle of the ambiguity of three texts). In other words: The reality being: v 4 = a o o + a x x + o x x , or: v 4 = b o o + b x x + o x x , we interpret it incorrectly as if it was: v 4 = a o o o + a x o o + x o o , or: v 4 = b o o o + b x o o + x o o (compare Table III, under v 4 and Table VI, under v 2 . The preceding deductions offer us a rather wide possibility of verifying the correctness of the proposed theory, since—if the theory is to be correct—the results of the computations, in the hypothetical case as well as in the actual group, must confirm the conclusions of our speculation. We are listing in the left column of table X the results of the operations as obtained in the hypothetical group, and in the right column the results of the actual case. The two tables show at the first glance that there is a full agreement between the hypothetical case and the Lai de l'Ombre manuscripts on the one hand, and between both cases and the theory on the other. According to the theoretical expectation as well as to the testimony of the hypothetical example, it is always possible, in our case, to compute the correct rates of change from two different groups of three witnesses, whereas the value computed from the third group appears, as expected, to be augmented by the changes introduced by X. The lines marked number 3 show these apparent rates. We are thus able to decide with certitude that the four scribes copying the archetype of the Lai de l'Ombre realized the following rates of preservation: (1—Pa) = .994; (1—Pb) = .972; (1—Pd 1 ) = .898; (1—Pf 1 ) = .846 (we again neglect the small inaccuracy of .001 in two of those rates). The result of the experiment thus seems to indicate that our theory correctly describes the reality and that it is well applicable in practice. Yet, the statistics contain still more information which may serve as a basis for an additional verification. According to our analysis, for instance, f 1 is expected to have in the four different groups the following expectancies: If then our analysis and the computations of table X are to be correct, we must be able to compute four times the correct value (1-Px) by dividing the numerical value f 1 of each group by the product of the three complementary rates of preservation constituting the expectancy of this particular variation. In group ADF, for example, one divides .680 by .755 which, according to table X, is the product of (1 — Pa) (1 — Pd 1 ) (1 — Pf 1 ); one proceeds analogically in all remaining groups. A simple computation thus again confirms our theoretical expectation because we obtain four times the result (1 — Px) = .900; that means that the corresponding rate Px is equal to .100. To carry out the same operations for the hypothetical group, we use tables XI and X and obtain four times the value (1 — Px) = .600 which we chose, as we know, to represent the numerical value of this particular variable. The consistency of our results as well as the repeated confirmation of our theoretical expectations seems to indicate first, that our analysis of the observable phenomena is basically correct, second, that our mathematical formulae correctly describe the facts of the reality and, finally, that the calculus actually permits us to detect the existence of the inferential manuscript X and even to estimate its rate of change with great accuracy. Our next concern is to verify the decisive question whether or not the proposed method is able to locate the position of the inferential manuscript by a formal procedure. According to the results of the identification tests, the inferential manuscript X is, in our group ABDF, located on the side of DF: If this result is actually correct, we represented the reality adequately by drawing the two following schemes: However, we completely misrepresented reality by drawing: Since the original source of our information is the archetype, and since from this source the information comes to us in a direction determined by the genealogical and "historical" relationship of the lost and extant manuscripts of the group, the correct representation of our four groups, expressed by a three branch scheme, is the following: The arrows indicate the direction in which the information is delivered to us and point out the fact that the reality will remain unchanged whichever way we may bend our diagrams. This implies the obvious fact, to be sure, that the reality will remain unaffected by our misinterpretation of the data and that we therefore can expect to obtain the correct values of the variables only if we are computing them under the correct hypothesis. In other words: The correctness of the hypothesis under which we are working will be verified by proving the identity of a given variable. Let us therefore consider now the groups under the hypothesis that they, all four, form an independently derived group. If then our identification tests correctly establish the genealogy of the four groups, this hypothesis will be correct in two instances and wrong in the other two instances; the unchangeable fact of the reality being the circumstance that the critical variations v 2 = AB : D, and v 2 = AB : F, will be composed of variants different from v 4 = DF : A, and v 4 = DF : B. Let us recall these facts and list the theoretical expectancies of the four critical variations (comp. table III, for groups ADF, BDF, and table VI, for groups ABD, ABF): The relationship between f 1 and f 2, established by our analysis and defined in table VI, indicates that, if the identification tests correctly established the position of the inferential manuscript X, we must expect to obtain the correct values (1—Px) (1—Pd 1 ) and (1—Px) (1—Pf 1 ), if we compute them from the groups ABD and ABF, respectively. Because in We obtain an analogical result in group ABF. On the other hand, the relationship between f 1 and f 4 , defined in Table III, indicates that we must not expect to compute the correct values (1—Px) (1—Pa) and (1—Px)(1—Pb), if we apply the analogical operation to groups ADF and BDF, respectively. Because in One obtains an analogical result in group BDF. We then can easily verify the correctness of these theoretical expectations by dividing the product of the four above operations by the value (1—Px), identified previously by four different operations (compare Table XI), and by comparing the result with the values: (1 — Pd 1 ), (1 — Pf 1 ), (1 — Pa), (1 — Pb), respectively, identified previously by two different operations each (compare Table X). In the following table, we list the results of these operations and comparisons: The full agreement between the result of the test operation in groups ABD, ABF and the correct values (1 — Pd 1 ), (1 — Pf 1 ) proves that we have worked under the correct hypothesis; the incorrect or even nonsensical result of the test operation in groups ADF, BDF, on the other hand, shows that we have worked under a wrong hypothesis. In other words, we have verified that the inferential manuscript really lies on the line between "A" and DF, and that it certainly does not lie on the line between "A" and AB. I have included the last demonstration in my report, although I am fully aware of the fact that it does not add any really new information to the one obtained by the application of the identification test. It does, however, spell out the mechanics of the test and thereby clearly describe the principle on which the test is based. The intention was to show that the method of inferring the existence and position of the inferential manuscript by means of probability calculus is based on rigid logic and not merely on a numerical coincidence. We share Housman's contention that in textual criticism, as indeed in any branch of knowledge, everything which conflicts with either common sense or reason should be rejected as mere hocus pocus. 32 If then our reasoning contains no basic fallacy, we hope to have demonstrated, that the quantitative method offers us the possibility of overcoming the ambiguity of three texts by a formal procedure.</field>

Le Lai de l'Ombre par Jean Renart (Paris, 1913). 5 It is interesting to note, in this connection, that Paul Maas, after more than thirty years of practical experience which lay between the first and third edition of his Textual Criticism (1958), judged it appropriate to restrict the notion of peculiar error to the more limited notion of indicative error and even more restrictively to notions of separative and conjunctive errors (op. cit., supplement). 6 Comp. for instance: J.

Dain's exhaustive collection of the information which is available to the critic through the study of manuscripts: Les Manuscrits (Paris, 1949). 9 Compare for instance the vehement rejection by A. Dain, op. cit., pp. 154-171. It is, however, interesting to note that the same views were proclaimed more than a half century ago by the distinctly antitraditional critic A. E.

The Calculus of Variants, An Essay on Textual Criticism (1927). 17 The only appreciation which acknowledges, although with many restrictions, the merits of this concise study seems to be the review by F. M. Salter [ RES , XIII (1937), 341-352]. Current objections to Greg's methods are that their practical results are as limited as those of any other method, which indeed was acknowledged by Greg himself ( Calculus , 53 seq.). The reasons for the misunderstanding of Greg's Calculus may have been the title of the work and its unusual symbols and formulas. The study, however, has no connection with mathematics; its basis is wholly logic, and very sound logic, hardly expressible by means other than symbols. 18 Dom Henri Quentin, Essais de critique textuelle ( Ecdotique ) (Paris, 1926); Hermann Paul, "Zur Nibelungenfrage," BGDSL , III (1876), 337-490, was first to apply probability calculus in attempting to answer a number of questions pertaining to versification and rimes. Paul's study escaped my attention and therefore I attributed in GL , V, 3, Supplement 1962, p. 78, the priority to Jean Fourquet, "Le paradoxe de Bédier," in Mélanges 1945 , II, Etudes littéraires, Publications de la Faculté des Lettres de l'Université de Strasbourg (1946), 1-16; F. Whitehead and W. Pickford, "The Two-branch Stemma," BBSIA , No. 3 (Paris, 1951), 83-90; Jean Fourquet, "Fautes communes ou innovations communes," Rom , LXX (1948-49), 85-95; Rev. by Mario Roques in Rom , LXIX (1946-47), 116-118. Arrigo Castellani, Bédier avait-il raison? Discours Universitaires, Nouvelle Série, XX, Fribourg (Suisse): Editions Universitaires, 1957. 19 In his article in Mélanges , Fourquet attempted to prove with probability calculus that a dichotomous stemma is more plausible than a three-branch stemma. Later, persuaded by the reasonings of Whitehead and Pickford, that there had been fallacy in his demonstration, Fourquet revoked—according to the testimony of H. Niewöhner ["Kunst oder Methode," BGDSL, LXXIX (Halle, 1957), 422]—his original thesis. In response to Mario Roque's review, Fourquet attacked the problem in a different manner, concluding that in a series of cases in which the witnesses do not offer sufficient evidence, the stemma would remain undetermined; secondly, that in many cases, and under seriously limiting conditions, a dichotomous stemma can be proved; and finally, that a three branch stemma can never be proved. Our demonstration will show quite the opposite of Fourquet's conclusion. However, the importance of Fourquet's studies lies in their innovation in method for he attempts for the first time to evaluate the plausibility of a hypothetical solution by probability calculus. 20 For a detailed analysis of the problem comp. V. A. Dearing, A Manual of Textual Analysis (1959), p. 18 seq. 21 We shall use from now on the symbol "A" for the archetype, the symbols X and Y for inferential manuscripts and A, B, C for extant manuscripts. 22 Archibald A. Hill, "Some Postulates for Distributional Study of Texts," Studies in Bibliography , III (1950-51), calls this approach distributional study, and distinguishes it from genealogical, external and literary study. The following analysis intends to demonstrate that an adequate interpretation of the distributional data permits us to establish a unique genealogical stemma. In this decisive point, our stemmata differ from the trees constructed by A. Hill, since the latter ones, admittedly, are non-unique and the author does not claim to describe by them the genealogical and "historical" relationship of the manuscripts. 23 The mathematical part of the proposed method has been designed with the constant help of Professor Roger Pinkham of Rutgers University, later reexamined by Professor Ronald Pyke of the University of Washington. I wish to express my thanks to both of them for the help they have given me. Nevertheless, I myself must assume full responsibility for any errors which there may be. 24 It is, of course, impossible to evaluate the number of potential changes contained in any particular exemplar. In practice, however, we can overcome this difficulty by the proper definition of the potential changes. In our calculations, we shall for instance assume that the number of potential changes contained in an exemplar is equal to the number of words of its text. We thereupon postulate that a scribe copying an exemplar can introduce one, but only one, change per word. As a consequence of our postulate, we must count one difference per word even when the comparison shows two or more differences in a particular word of the text; also, we must disregard the transpositions, omissions and additions of verses, because it is impossible to estimate their potential number. Since the omissions and additions of different states are usually very indicative for the genealogical relationship of the texts, we must expect that a properly established stemma will not contradict the evidence contained in these indices. The definition of a difference is a difficult problem which cannot be discussed here. Generally one may say, however, that the definition itself matters less as long as it is one which can be applied consistently. 25 The equations of the following table are based on a "reasonable" estimate of the true probability; in order to estimate what values of the unknown would make the observed quantities as probable as possible, it would be necessary to introduce the principle in statistics called maximum likelihood. The resulting equations are rather complex and can be solved only by an adequate computer. In the following, we shall work with the "reasonable" estimates of the probabilities because we had no machine at our disposal. The unmaximized equations which we shall use have the advantage of being easily controllable by a non-mathematician. Compare Roger Pinkham's explanation of the principle of maximum likelihood in my report, "Statistical Methods in Textual Criticism," General Linguistics , Vol. 5, no. 3 (Supplement, 1962), p. 83 seq. 26 Our statistics are based on the text as established by Joseph Bédier, ed. Le Lai de l'Ombre par Jean Renart (Paris, 1913), and John Orr, ed. Jehan Renart, Le Lai de l'Ombre (Edinburgh, 1948). 27 Comp. above, p. 157. 28 The fact that some texts or parts of them may be the product of memorial transmission affects the texts in a similar way as contamination. The fact that other texts again are transcripts of dictation, affects, to be sure, the character and the extent of the changes introduced by the scribes, but evidently has no bearing on those factors which constitute the genealogical relationship of the witnesses nor on the possibility of applying the probability calculus. Finally, the proof that the one or the other line of descent may be based on an exemplar reedited by the author himself escapes in any case textual criticism in the strict sense of the word. 29 General Linguistics , Vol. V, no. 3 (Supplement, 1962), 100-122. 30 The table also indicates that, in our case, the archetype contained a very small number of recognizable errors, it shows namely that the important deviation from one (.034 and .035) is not produced by a corrupted archetype, since it appears only in the groups ADF and BDF. It must therefore be caused by a factor which is common to DF only; the archetype, being common to all four manuscripts, would necessarily cause a similar deviation in all four groups. 31 This small deviation from the test value may be caused either by a very light corruption of the archetype, or by the fact that we did not introduce the principle of maximum likelihood into the calculus, or finally, and most likely, by the imperfect dissolution of the conflicts. 32 A.

      <field name="heading_text">A Description of "Paterna": The Unpublished Autobiography of Cotton Mather by William R. Manierre II</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his review of Larzer Ziff's The Career of John Cotton , Everett H. Emerson remarks that "a comparable study of Cotton Mather is now the most needed addition to our knowledge of Puritanism in colonial New England." 1 Whether Barrett Wendell's life of Cotton Mather: The Puritan Priest 2 needs replacement is perhaps less certain than Mr. Emerson suggests, but one matter is beyond dispute. Whoever undertakes to rewrite Mather's life must use as his primary sources the autobiographical records left to posterity by the highly self-conscious Boston minister. Of these, the heretofore unpublished, "lost" Diary of 1712 has recently been published by the University Press of Virginia; 3 whereas Worthington Chauncey Ford's two-volume edition of the Diary of Cotton Mather 4 has long since made easily available all other Mather diaries presently known to exist. In addition to these obvious sources of biographical information there remains the little known and never published autobiography which Mather wrote for his son and to which he gave the highly characteristic title of "Paterna." Surprisingly enough, however, for a variety of reasons, our hypothetical biographer would benefit little by consulting "Paterna," 5 could safely ignore the existence of this curious, dull, and remarkably uninformative document. It is my intention here so to describe "Paterna" as to suggest that its publication is anything but needed, that an edition would serve no useful purpose. Most of the book is already in print either verbatim or in close paraphrase; and owing to the nature of Mather's procedure it is invariably the case that when differences exist between alternate versions "Paterna's" is the least informative. I believe it is fair to say that the document adds not one scrap of significant information to our knowledge of its author. One primary reason is the kind of material Mather saw fit to record. An early allusion to "Paterna," his Diary entry of Feb. 16, 1712, conveniently defines this for us. "7.G.D. That I may the more Effectually Remember my many Projections, to improve in Piety, I would hasten to Cull the Chief of them, out of my Memorials, and insert them in my Paterna ; that I may often peruse them, and by the perusal thereof imprint them on my memory." "Paterna" consists, then, not of newly written autobiographical material but almost entirely of passages selected and copied from what he delighted to term his "Reserved Memorials"—the diaries; so that the autobiography is itself little other than a version of the diaries edited by Mather himself. But the passages selected for inclusion are precisely those that above all others are least provided with factual information. It was Mather's custom each morning to ask himself the "Grand Question, What Good may I do?" 6 His answers to this question he recorded in the diaries under the heading "G.D." or "Good Devised." On Saturday morning the particular question asked was " What more have I to do, for the Interests of God, in my own Heart and Life? " In very large part his method in "Paterna" was simply to copy selected answers to this question, the seventh "G.D." of each week. As he says in "Paterna," "You are sensible, My Son , That Very much of the Book now in your Hands, is but an Answer to this Question " (p. 269). His answers take the form of prayers or of itemized systems for spending his time or for setting aside special days for various forms of worship. In short, "Paterna" is considerably more a manual of devotion than a typical Puritan spiritual history; far more a record of pious exercises intended and/or accomplished than autobiography in the usual sense. As he remarks in the Diary (March 22, 1712): "I Perceive I must, in my Paterna , make a Recollection, of my Principal Projections and Intentions to carry on my Christian Asceticks , that so I may frequently have Recourse unto it, and not Lose the Remembrance and Influence, and Performance, of any of my Proposals and Resolutions." One can, then, gain an excellent notion of this work merely by reading various Diary entries under the "7.G.D." heading. Or, better still, one can consult Samuel Mather's Life of his father, the longest and dullest chapter of which, the sixth, is taken almost word for word from "Paterna." The full title of this chapter adequately describes its contents and those of its source: " An account of the Christian Life and Practice of Piety of Dr . MATHER, in which there is a particular Delineation of his Devotions and Asceticks, together with his Methods in observing his private Fasts, Thanksgivings, Vigils, etc ." 7 Of Samuel's work, W. B. O. Peabody observes, "he seems to have admired nothing in his father, not even his industry, energy, and various learning, so much as the fasts, vigils, and other forms which he so religiously observed. . . . Those who are interested to know something of Cotton Mather, consult the book with a perpetual feeling of disappointment and unfeigned sorrow that he had not left it to some other writer." 8 Barrett Wendell finds Samuel's book "colorless," a fact ascribed to Samuel's "genius for dullness" which appeared to Wendell to be "ultimate." 9 But the dullest pages in Samuel's book were written by Cotton Mather himself. Mather did not begin until 1711 to organize his diary entries in terms of the answers to different questions asked on each day of the week. In subsequent diaries, however, he continued the practice with minor variations in the numbering of entries. But the earlier diaries also contain numerous proposals and descriptions of methods of prayer, fasting, and self-examination and for the conduct of days set aside for vigils or other devotions. These entries are identical in kind with the later answers to his question for the seventh day, and it is from them that he invariably draws materials for "Paterna." Once having arrived at 1711, Mather relies almost exclusively on his answers to this question when using the diaries as a source. Of the approximately thirty-one pages of this work which I have located in these later diaries, twenty-nine are composed entirely of such answers. Unfortunately, of the seven questions Mather proposed to himself each week the seventh was by a considerable margin the least productive of informative replies. A further cause of "Paterna's" relative worthlessness as a source of historical fact is, simultaneously, one of its most fascinating features. Somewhat improbably, its author determined to write his autobiography in such a manner as to conceal his identity from the reader. "Because I know not what Hands, besides Yours ," he tells his son, "this Work may fall into, I Will be careful to insert not One word, that shall discover unto any One man Living, who I am " (p. 2). And the "First Part" opens with the somewhat less than hopeful statement that "Being desirous to Discover myself unto None, but You , My SON, I Must here leave Unmentioned, When and Where (as well as, of Whom ) I was born, Lest the mention thereof should afford some Light unto the Discovery, against which I Would be Cautious" (p. 3). As a consequence of this perverse decision, whatever is specific, detailed, or concrete is expunged from passages copied into "Paterna." Since the diaries are themselves annoyingly generalized and since "Paterna" is in large part transcribed from them the result is a document almost incredibly abstract and vague. Time and again he seems about to let slip some pertinent bit of information but remembers at the last moment and declines to impart it. He is admitted to "a College," which of course cannot be named (p. 5); he cannot divulge at what age he became a minister (p. 15) lest he "be discovered." For the same reason, he can reveal neither the names nor the number of books he has written (pp. 24, 46, 112, 115, 129, 219); nor his " Experiences . . . [and] . . . Contrivances to glorify ye Lord Jesus Christ" (p. 117); nor the various " Public Circumstances" of his life (p. 127); nor the "Marvellous and Amazing Answers , ye Strange Providence of Heaven, hath given to these Prayers of a Vile Sinner before the Lord" (p. 141). Only once does he forget and that while quoting from a letter written him by "an Holy Servant of that glorious LORD": "You'l Pardon my Troubling You, with a Line or two, to Thank you for your Maschil " (p. 203). Here Mather marks the identifying word and writes in the margin, "The Title of a Book, which I had Published." It might be argued that the pursuit of anonymity is justified by Mather's proper sense of Christian humility. This argument, however, is nullified by the fact that, in spite of his protestations to the contrary, Mather was anything but a humble man, something that "Paterna" does little to conceal. In fact, his burgeoning vanity leads Mather to include more than sufficient information to enable anyone familiar with his life and personality to identify him as the author. He is "Related unto above Twenty Several Societies " (p. 265). Not only has he written books in "More than Two or Three . . . Languages " (p. 265), but "no Non-Conformist Minister now surviving in ye Nation hath . . . written . . . so many books" (p. 46). His library has he knows "not how many more than Thirty Hundred Books," and his father's is "not much Less" (p. 46). He cannot even estimate "How many Hundreds , yea, how many Thousands , of Good Books " he has given away (p. 45). As " Pastor of a Church" and " Collegue . . . [of] . . . an Elderly and Eminent Person" (p. 86) he serves the Lord "in as Great a Place, as any in these Parts of the World," and he knows no " Non-Conformist " who preaches to larger congregations (p. 20). He preaches in fact "to greater Congregations, than most preachers of ye True Gospel in this world" (p. 82). Even apart from the inadvertent reference to Maschil the author of "Paterna" is easily recognizable. But anonymity and absence of particulars do not really conflict with the book's intended function as a guide to holy living. The punning title has reference both to matters paternal and to the concept of an imitable pattern as well. 10 I Must Meditate much on my SAVIOUR, and Especially Employ Serious &amp; frequent Meditations on ye Pattern of my SAVIOUR. This will be ye Changing of my Soul into His Image from Glory to Glory . A Soul full of a CHRIST, and Like to a CHRIST, is an Healed Soul .

(p. 310) What he attempts to describe is a life based on the highest conceivable ideal and pattern. His concern is with principles of behavior which he describes in the most abstract and general terms. Or we may put it another way and simply say that in "Paterna" Cotton Mather attempts to record the life of an abstraction. It is essentially this that Samuel tells the reader in a remark immediately following the long, descriptive title of his sixth chapter. "In . . . [this] . . . Chapter you will read the Christian of the highest Rank." Neither a sense of humility nor the nature of his subject dictated to Mather the intention to keep his identity secret. The only explanation he vouchsafes is that he does not know into whose hands besides those of his son the document might fall. The suggestion is of course that darkly mysterious plots are afoot, that machinations by the forces of Satan are at work, that what he elsewhere calls his "contemptible Enemies" are anxiously waiting to get their hands on the autobiography in order to use it against him and against others who serve the Lord. The effect is to exaggerate for Mather and by intention for the reader too the importance of the work and of the man whose "life" it records. The pitiful thing is that there is nothing in "Paterna" that could conceivably be used against anybody in any conceivable circumstance. Its contents are blandly innocuous. Moreover it contains virtually nothing not already present—and in more detailed, and hence more incriminating, form—either in the "Reserved Memorials," which he clearly hoped would one day be published, or in works which he himself saw into print. Perhaps most pitiful of all in this respect is his frequent advice that the son consult the diaries for more specific information on various matters at which "Paterna" only hints. The intention of secrecy clearly reflects, on the one hand, Mather's marked sense of his own importance and, on the other, what is itself a reflection of the same sense, his persecution complex. His rather large enjoyment of the game of cat and mouse he plays is obvious; he loved the curious, the unusual, and equally too, the oblique, the indirect, the hidden and secret. To create a mystery where none existed before was his delight. The pleasure he derived from making, in Bonifacius , a veiled and deliberately misleading allusion to "Paterna" is perfectly transparent: "But some have chosen the way of PASTORAL VISITS. And from the Memorials of One who long since did so, and then left his PATERNA, to his Son upon it, I will transcribe the Ensuing Passages." 11 Then follows a passage taken directly from "Paterna" (pp. 96-98), a passage dutifully copied by Samuel in 1728 when writing his father's Life . The sly unction of Mather's reference needs no comment. To such behavior he owes, in part at least, his reputation for hypocrisy. That "Paterna" is a redaction of other of his writings is thoroughly characteristic both of the man and of his methods, as is the fact that he sometimes reversed the procedure by copying from "Paterna" into other works. His penchant for copying and recopying his own words was as marked as was his practice of reading and rereading them for personal guidance. As W. C. Ford remarks, "there is no way of telling how often he went over his writings, and how many times he saw fit to recast . . . them. . . . That a man should so carefully work over these attempts to express what is passing in his religious experience offers good evidence of his self-absorption and morbid conception of his own importance." 12 But again, these facts, like others revealed by "Paterna," though often curious, tell us nothing of Cotton Mather that we did not know before. They are entirely in accordance with the known peculiarities of his strange personality. That he left conflicting accounts of the person for whose benefit his autobiography was written is also characteristic. We have seen his express statement that he intended "Paterna" for his own use, that, as he put it in 1712, he might "improve in Piety" by perusing its various "Projections." That he continued to consider its usefulness to himself as its purpose is suggested elsewhere. The Diary entry for Feb. 26, 1721 reads, "I am collecting into my Paterna several Methods of conversing with my Admirable SAVIOUR . . . that so having them together before me, for a frequent Perusal, I may keep in the lively Exercise of them" (II, 603). But there is no hint of this purpose in "Paterna" itself in which Mather insists again and again that he is writing entirely for the benefit of his son. 13 Obviously the book might have served both functions equally well, but when Mather describes the one he does so in terms that exclude the other—for what reason it would be difficult to say. "Paterna" exhibits yet another curiosity of the sort Worthington C. Ford had in mind when he warned Thomas James Holmes to keep out of the "Mather bog." 14 Scholars, Barrett Wendell 15 and Holmes 16 among them, have always taken for granted that Mather wrote "Paterna" for Samuel Mather. Their assumption was perfectly natural. Samuel alone of Mather's sons survived his father; his name with the date 1727 appears on the title page of "Paterna"; he used the book extensively when writing his father's life; and he was both a pious minister and a doting son, precisely the kind of man whom Mather could assume would use "Paterna" in the way it was intended. The truth is, however, that Cotton did not write "Paterna" for Samuel at all, but for Increase, for the scapegrace son who in almost every respect seems to have been the exact opposite of his younger brother. Although he apostrophizes his "Son" over and over again in "Paterna," Mather never once identifies by name the son he has in mind. In spite of this and even though it does not contain really demonstrative evidence, I believe that anyone who read the work with care would be convinced that Mather originally intended it for Increase. The long unpublished "missing" Diary of 1712 presents conclusive testimony. The entry for Feb. 25 reads explicitly: "My Son Increase , I will now have to sit by me, especially on the Lords-day Evenings; and Read over to me, first the Paterna I have written for him; and Such other things as may be most Suitable to him; and make them the Arguments of my most Winning Discourses with him." But the intractable "Cressy" who died at sea in 1724, continued to resist all efforts at reform. "Paterna's" account of "Cressy's" birth (pp. 186-187) was not originally composed for that document at all but was copied with minor changes and deletions from the Diary entry for July 5, 1699 (I, 307). As usual, the "Paterna" version is the less informative. It omits such mundane particulars as the date of birth and the name given the infant, while concentrating on the father's condition of soul and identifying by reference and quotation the Biblical texts from which he drew the "Meditation" and the "Doctrine" with which he "Entertained" his "Family" before and after the happy event. Following Increase's death, Mather returned to the autobiography to make the newly necessitated revisions. He crossed out one passage of six lines and another of about a line and a half. What the latter originally said is impossible to determine. Enough of the former is sufficiently legible, however, to identify it as one in which is described Mather's reception of "a wonderful Advice from Heaven, that this my Son, shall be a Servant of my Lord Jesus Christ throughout eternal Ages." The cancellation demonstrates Mather's horrified awareness of his son's failure to cooperate with the heavenly prediction; while a newly added passage consigns him to the fate reserved for "Castaways." "But tho' this were a Son of Great Hopes , and One whom Thousands &amp; Thousands of Prayers were Employ'd for him [sic]; Yett after all, a Sovereign God would not Accept of him." After adding that this lad, for whom he always held a very special place in his heart, "was Buried in the Atlantick Ocean," Mather reassigned "Paterna" to the altogether more hopeful, if less inspiring, Samuel—without of course identifying him by name. "And You, my only Son, Surviving, are the person for whom these Memorials are intended &amp; reserved." Several other minor revisions were made elsewhere in the document at about this time evidently in an effort to give the impression that it had all along been written for Samuel. The book's prevailing vagueness, combined with the fact that the "Son" is neither individuated nor named, made this misleading impression all the easier for Mather to convey. It is impossible to say whether or not Samuel was aware that "Paterna" was written for Increase. It is also impossible to prove that Cotton intended to deceive Samuel into thinking he had written it for him; although I believe he did so intend. Whether intentionally deceptive in this respect or not, the book was sufficiently ambiguous to convince Barrett Wendell and Thomas James Holmes that the younger, duller Mather was the object of his father's paternal ministrations. The passage concerning Cressy's death must have been entered in or after 1724, a fact which raises the problem of dating the manuscript. Typically, Mather's own assertions tend to confuse the issue. The earliest known reference to "Paterna" occurs in Bonifacius , a book Mather published in 1710. Here, in the curious passage previously quoted in this study, Mather implies that "Paterna" is not only a finished work but that it was written many years before by a man no longer alive. Having befuddled matters to his satisfaction he then proceeds to quote from pages 96-98 of "Paterna." This is sufficient proof that as early as 1710, Mather, then in his forty-eighth year, was well along with the autobiography. Since neither the Diary for 1709 nor any of the earlier diaries mentions it, we may assume with some safety that Mather began "Paterna" in 1710; but since the diary for that year is missing we cannot go to it for final confirmation. As did Bonifacius , the Diary entries for May 1, 1711, and for Feb. 25, 1712, speak of "Paterna" as if it were already finished. Other, and in some instances, later, Diary entries, however, allude to it as to a work which Mather is still engaged in writing. The latest of these, dated Feb. 26, 1721 states, "I am collecting into my Paterna , several Methods of conversing with my Admirable SAVIOUR . . . that . . . I may keep in the lively Exercise of them, and may not lose them in my feeble and broken Conversation" (II, 603). This, the last Diary entry to mention "Paterna" by name, refers, I believe, to a lengthy passage in that work (pp. 337-350) describing "Some Very Singular Methods . . . [for maintaining] . . . Life by ye Faith of ye SON of GOD ," a passage which is largely a discussion of the complex nature of the "GOD - MAN . . . who has the Fulness of the Godhead Personally dwelling in Him ." The entire passage ultimately found its way, and virtually without change, into Samuel's Life (pp. 90-101). Subsequent to this particular passage only five more pages of "Paterna" remain. We can conclude, therefore, that the manuscript was in a continual process of composition—as Mather laid it aside, occasionally thinking of it as a finished work and even referring to it as such, and then again picked it up for additions—over the period of better than ten years between 1710 and 1721. Characteristically, the last Diary entry to name "Paterna" is not the last Diary reference to that work. This final allusion provides yet another illustration of Mather's taste for vagueness, of his unwillingness to identify in specific terms the object he has in mind. On the twenty-third of July, 1721, he proposes to himself a "Question" which few human beings other than Cotton Mather would ever have entertained. " What would be my Dispositions; what my Exercises . . . if I were fastened unto a CROSS, and under all the Circumstances of a Crucifixion ?" (II, 633). To this he subsequently adds, "My Answer to it, is written down on a separate Paper" (II, 633). Since "Paterna" puts the same question in the same words and then provides two pages (352-354) 17 by way of answer, we may assume that it is the "separate Paper" to which Mather refers. Since not quite a full page of writing remains, we may take July 23, 1721, as an almost certain terminal date of composition remembering that Mather did return to the work on occasion for minor and, after the death of Increase in 1724, for relatively major revision. Of some interest too is the fact that Mather continued to use the manuscript as a source of materials to be incorporated and on one occasion at least to be copied directly into later works. Pages 199-200 of "Paterna," for instance, constitute a kind of précis of pages 15-21 of Signatus , a sermon preached and published in 1727. Pages 47-48 of Baptismal Piety , also published in 1727, are identical with pages 207-209 of "Paterna." Thus, once again, we find "Paterna" to exemplify characteristics of Mather's methodology which, though perhaps interesting in themselves, have long since been recognized and more than adequately confirmed. Before its acquisition in 1952 by the McGregor Library of the University of Virginia's Alderman Library, the "Paterna" manuscript had had a number of different owners. First was Cotton Mather himself who, as we have seen, was still using it in the conduct of his ministry as late as 1727. Next came Samuel, for whom it served as a primary source for his father's Life . The title page bears the inscription "Samuel Mather's" with the date "1727" written just below. Although this would seem to show that Cotton presented the document to his son in the year preceding his death, the conclusion is not necessary. It was Cotton Mather's practice to use the legal year instead of the calendar year as the basis of his dates. According to this system, March is the first month of the year and February, accordingly, the last. Since Mather died on February 13, the year of his death could be considered 1727 or 1728 depending on the system used. It is perfectly possible that Samuel signed the document between the time of his father's death and the end of February, in which case the inscribed "1727" would represent the legal rather than the calendar year which would of course be 1728. On Samuel's death in 1785 the manuscript became the possession of his daughter, Mrs. Hannah (Mather) Crocker, who later gave it to the Reverend Doctor William Jenks of Boston. Conveniently, another inscription on the title page provides a date for this transaction. The inscription reads, "A Gift of Madam H. Crocker" and, on the line beneath, "June 1, 1814." When Dr. Jenks died in 1866, the manuscript became the possession of Judge Mark Skinner of Chicago. 18 Part of the remaining story is to be found written on "Paterna's" inside back cover. "[This (?)] belongs to Elizabeth Skinner, formerly belonging to her father—Mark Skinner—presented by her to the Chicago Historical Society, of which he was one of the charter members—June 23rd, 1915." The Chicago Historical Society sold "Paterna," in the fall of 1951, to Goodspeeds shop in Boston from which it was purchased by the McGregor Library in the summer of 1952. The "Paterna" manuscript is an octavo volume with leaves 17.2 cm. long and 11.3 cm. wide. The leaves vary in length between about 17.15 and 17.3 cm., but the width remains almost constant. Its make-up is as follows: a single leaf (unwatermarked); 2 conjugate leaves, with the binding thread evident in the fold; stubs of about 11 torn-out leaves; 12 8-leaf gatherings; a single leaf (unwatermarked); a single leaf (unwatermarked); 9 8-leaf gatherings; an 8-leaf gathering in which the bottom part of the seventh leaf has been torn out and the eighth leaf is missing; stubs of about 33 torn-out leaves; a single leaf showing part of a watermark. Thus, an appropriate collational formula for the volume is: [unsigned: 1 1 2 2 3-14 8 15 1 16 1 17-25 8 26 8 (-26 8 ) 27 1 ]. The manuscript contains 181 leaves, and the pages are numbered, in Mather's hand, as follows: the first six pages and the last three are unnumbered; the rest are numbered consecutively from 1 through 355 except that pp. 7 and 60 lack numbers and the numbering skips from 161 to 164. Thus, an appropriate formula for the pagination is: pp. [ 6 ] 1-6 7 8-59 60 61-161 164-355 356-358 [=356]. The paper is laid watermarked paper all of one lot. The watermark —a horn—is most similar to numbers 2724 and 2725 (and possibly 2738) in Edward Heawood's Watermarks , plates 347 and 349; these watermarks occur in books dated respectively 1671, 1668, and n.d. Precise identification of the "Paterna" watermark is rendered impossible, however, by the smallness of the octavo format. Furthermore, there is a barely discernible countermark—some sort of flower (between initials?)—which differs from the countermarks of Heawood 2724 and 2738. The manuscript is bound in old calf, with gilt ornamentation around the edges of the front and back covers. On the spine there are eight sets of gilt double rules and the handwritten title "C. MATHER'S / PATERNA', / MS.". The mark after "PATERNA'" may be a period rather than a comma. On the inside front cover a slip of nineteenth-century (?) wove paper is pasted-in with the note "Cotton Mather's Life in his own handwriting written / for his son—". 19 One matter—that of the approximately 33 missing leaves at the end of the document—demands further comment. So many torn-out pages here suggest that at one time the book extended beyond page 355 and that, quite possibly, Mather continued adding to it after the year 1721, which I have taken for the terminal date of composition. Moreover, the verso of the single unnumbered leaf which follows the stubs of missing leaves at the very end of the book contains Mather's epigraph. This might seem to show that the intervening pages which Mather tore out also had writing on them. On the contrary, however, though I cannot prove my point, I am convinced that, except for this final leaf, "Paterna" never did extend beyond page 355 and that the pages torn out were entirely, or for the most part, blank. About two-thirds of the last page of text (p. 355) has been carefully cut away. The other side of the sheet is both unnumbered and blank. In view of "Paterna's" other blank pages this is not demonstrative, but it does raise the possibility that following pages were also blank. 20 Moreover, the nature and tone of the concluding pages as they now stand distinctly support this view. They have the ring of finality. There is an Illustration of the Glorious TRINITY in the Eternal GODHEAD, which apprehends GOD propounding to Himself an Infinite Satisfaction ; And here is GOD the FATHER. Then, GOD Reflected on Himself, that so He may have that Satisfaction ; And here is GOD the SON. Lastly, upon this Contemplation wherein GOD Beholds and Enjoys Himself, arising a Love , a Joy , an Acquiescence , and a Satisfaction of GOD within Himself; And here is GOD the Holy SPIRIT. Now, I sett before me my Admirable SAVIOUR, that I may See GOD in Him , and Live . From this View of GOD in my SAVIOUR, my Soul is filled with Love to Him, with Joy in Him, with an Incomparable Satisfaction from Him. What a Communion with the Glorious GOD, and the Three Subsistences in Him, is Dust &amp; Ashes herein raised unto! What a Demonstration will this Exercise of Piety give of ones having the Holy SPIRIT of GOD filling and acting of Him! Yea, what Prelibation here have I of that Final Blessedness wherein all the Gracious Designs of my SAVIOUR for me terminate! This is the way that I take . And in this way of Living by Faith of the SON of GOD , I keep Looking for His Mercy to me in Eternal Life . 21 It is my belief that this passage marks the final conclusion and that the missing pages never formed part of the book at all. Nor is the epigraph on the last leaf difficult to conjure with. It is precisely the kind of thing to appeal to Mather's every instinct—whether he ran across it in his multifarious reading or drew upon his own vast fund of learning in order to write it himself. " Plancus being told, that Asinius Pollio had written certain Invective Orations against him, that should not be published until after Plancus's Death, to ye end they might not be answered by him. There is none , saith he, but Ghosts &amp; Goblins, that fight with ye Dead !" No compelling reason exists to assume that because this passage is written where it is there must have been writing on the preceding pages. My belief is that Mather, delighted with it, simply inscribed it in the appropriate place in the manuscript sometime during the course of composition. He might even have placed it where it stands before beginning actually to write the autobiography. Such little practices—a goad here for him to keep at the autobiography and by filling the empty pages to make it large—were by no means untypical of him. "Paterna" is then, I believe, complete in its present form. In the first 184 pages, which carry the account of his "Poor Pilgrimage" through its thirty-fifth year (1697) and which constitute the first part of "Paterna," Mather adheres, with a few unannounced violations, to a chronological organization. Although in accordance with his design of secrecy he includes not a single date, he does specify his age at the beginning of each year. The years are treated both as units in themselves and as parts of larger units of five years, or "Lustres," as Mather calls them, which provide the basic structural pattern for what is almost exactly the first half of the work. In "The SECOND Part" (pp. 185-355) Mather drops both the chronological order and the division into lustres. He presents his reasons for doing so in words which delightfully propose a complete renunciation of system. And now, because I may upon my Looking back, meet with several passages yett unmentioned, that may be as Instructive to you, as those whereof I have already made mention; and others are occurring in that part of your Father's Life, which is now running; I shall proceed without any Method at all, 22 to Sett before you what I may think proper &amp; useful for you. And it may be, the Less of Method there is in this Work, it will be but ye more Natural , and Beautiful , and it may carry ye more of a Parental Authority upon it. (p. 187) In spite of the promise this holds forth, the character of the book remains much unchanged as Mather continues to record one "7.G.D." after another. Lack of chronology does, however, deprive this half of the only structural pattern that really operates in the first half. Moreover, it compounds what has throughout been "Paterna's" most serious fault by rendering the second half even more abstract than the first. One source of interest in "Paterna" is that it contains materials—and fairly extensive materials at that—from missing diaries that may well never turn up. It is possible to identify these by year in those portions of "Paterna" in which Mather informs us of his age. The following chart, in addition to providing a kind of chronological index to "Paterna," indicates the diaries from which the passages cited were originally taken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chronological Summary Mather treats the first three "Lustres" of his life as a unit (pp. 3-9). Thereafter, the account is as follows: Age as identified in "Paterna" Year Diary Pages in "Paterna" 16 1678 Mather says he finds nothing recorded for this year 17 1679 11-17 18 1680 17-20 4th Lustre 19 1681 1st extant 20-42 20 1682 no 43-59 Age as identified in "Paterna" Year Diary Pages in "Paterna" 21 1683 yes 61-77 22 1684 no 77-80 23 1685 yes 81-102; 130-132 5th Lustre 24 1686 yes 102-106 25 1687 no 106-109 26 1688 a frag. 111-112 27 1689 no 113-115 28 1690 no 116-121 6th Lustre 29 1691 no 30 1692 yes 73-74; 125 31 1693 yes 127-130; 133-134 32 1694 no 135-148 33 1695 no 148-161 7th Lustre 34 1696 yes 165-174 35 1697 yes 175-184 Second Part; "no longer distinguished into Lustres" 1698 yes 188-193 1699 yes 186-187; 193-196 1700 yes 122-123; 196-199 1701 yes 1702 yes 197; 200-205; 209-210 1703 yes 210-215 1704 no 1705 yes 217-232 1706 yes 232-236 1707 yes 1708 no 1709 yes 259-265; 268-270. These pages differ vastly from the Diary version. Samuel repeats the "Paterna" version almost word for word. 1710 no 1711 yes 273-275; 279-288 1712 yes 278-279; 282; 285-286; 288-295 1713 yes 1714 no 1715 no 1716 yes 323-325 1717 yes 312-316; 324-325; 328-329 1718 yes 311-312 321-322 325-328; 339 1719 no 1720 no 1721 yes 352. This is the last datable entry from the Diary . For the last 7 years of Mather's life only the Diary of 1724 remains. "Paterna" thus records approximately seventy-five pages from diaries no longer available. These passages, identical in kind with the rest of "Paterna," are similarly unrewarding. Then too, somewhat better than thirty of these pages have been available to the interested ever since 1729 when Samuel copied them into his book. As the chart shows, 1681 is the first year for which "Paterna" contains a really extensive passage. This year is also the first for which the Diary is still extant, a fact that might suggest that the earlier diaries were either remarkably thin or that they were already missing when Mather began his autobiography. 23 Barrett Wendell's remark that "until 1681 I find nothing concerning him beyond what his son tells" 24 is similarly indicative of the nature of "Paterna's" opening pages. In view of the fact that Judge Skinner had made it available to him, Wendell's remark and the extremely sparing use he made of "Paterna" would seem to verify my own conclusions regarding the value of this unpublished document as a source of significant historical or biographical information. Nevertheless, "Paterna" does offer certain negative information about missing diaries for years that were crucial in Mather's life. It will be noticed that whereas some years (1682, 1694, and 1695) provided "Paterna" with rather lengthy passages, others (1687-1691) provided it with very little. Mather's explanation is revealing. In 1687 he writes, "Partly from ye provision which I had already made, of Methods to Serve God &amp; to Do Good ; and Partly from ye Variety of Publick Employments , whereinto I was now fallen, after those Methods had somewhat fitted me; but Partly, and, I doubt Cheefly, from ye Sinfulness and Slothfulness of my own Heart, I find Very Little Recorded, in ye Twenty Fifth year of my Pilgrimage" (p. 106). And he begins the account for 1688 with an even more inclusive statement. " My Son ; For Some following Years, my Memorials were not so filled with Varieties of Contrivances for my Private Walk . My Public Work was indeed so very much, that I could not be so Various in my Private Walk , as heretofore. And it may be an useful Hint unto you, if I tell you; That God, who intended me for Very much Public Work , did strangely prepare me for it, by Putting me upon ye Excogitating of such Methods for my Private Walk , in ye dayes of my Youth, while I had more Leisure for them" (p. 111). In other words, these missing documents were never more than skimpy and we may assume the extent of our loss to be negligible. 25 Of text proper "Paterna" has three hundred forty-seven pages. 26 Of these I have been able to locate approximately two hundred fifty-five in books that are still available. 27 Moreover, the bulk of the remaining pages can be tentatively accounted for in one way or another with a fair degree of certainty. Most of these, some forty-two pages, apparently once formed parts of diaries now missing but which "Paterna" enables us to date. There is convincing evidence that eight pages (329-336) were taken from a sermon which Mather delivered on December 8, 1717, on the text " The Son of God hath Loved me ." Evidently he failed to get this sermon published. Four additional pages (307-310) apparently once were part of the sermon entitled " Raphael: The Blessings of an Healed Soul Considered ," which he delivered on January 30, 1717. He succeeded in getting this work into print shortly thereafter, but there is no known existing copy. Another page and a half Mather himself untypically tells us are from "Ye Application" of a sermon on " The Shepherds Keeping a Watch on their Flocks ." Chronological structure provides us with 1695 as a tentative date for this unpublished work. Thus, of the approximately ninety-two unlocated pages slightly better than fifty-five are found to have at one time formed parts of lost or unpublished works which "Paterna," with the help of the Diary , enables us to identify both by nature and by date. As has been consistently the case, the contents of these pages resemble Mather's answers to his persistent query regarding " the Interests of God , in [ his ] own Heart and Life " and are equally incapable of providing us with new and significant knowledge of their author. Of the remaining pages, five and one-half have already been identified: the two (352-354) quoted at the end of this article and the three and one-half (313-316) concerning the "Heavenly Affections" of the inspired writers of Scripture. It would appear that, except for necessary transitions and frequent admonitions that his "Son" heed the paternal instruction, these two brief passages are the only ones which were first written into "Paterna" and never formed part of some other work. Since they constitute the development of ideas mentioned in the Diary they too can be approximately dated. We are left with a total of but thirty-one pages so far unaccounted for. Some twenty of these consist of passages, for the most part brief, whose function is primarily transitional rather than informative. The following example is typical. Now, My Son , I hope you will not need any Annotations , on ye passages which I thus Transcribe one after another, out of my Reserved Memorials , to make you understand ye Directions which I intend for you, in singling out these Passages from Very many others, which I do not in this place and way Expose unto your Notice. If you Consider , you will Easily understand , as you go along, what those Points of Piety are, which I would have you from hence Directed unto. My Dear Son: The Lord give thee understanding in all things . (p. 166) I am unable to date or otherwise positively to identify the few remaining pages; but since they are of the same nature as the rest of the book it is a fairly safe assumption that they were not originally composed for "Paterna" but were copied from some "Reserved Memorial" that has not been "preserved."</field>

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX (Mather composed this passage exclusively for "Paterna." See page 192 and footnote 17.) I think, If I were fastened unto a Cross, and under all the Circumstances of a Crucifixion, what would be my Dispositions, what my Exercises ? I should Look on my approaching Death , as Unavoidable; and the Approaches of it would now be Welcome to me, not having any Prospect of being any other way delivered from Numberless Uneasinesses. I should Look on all the Delights and Riches and Honours of the World from which I am departing, as things of no Use and no Worth unto me. I should have done Expecting of Satisfaction from any thing of This World ; and no more propose a Portion in any thing that is done under the Sun. I should be Extremely Sick of a world, which I saw filled with such Unreasonable, Unrighteous, Barbarous Things, where the Most Holy City is full of Murderers . I should Expect a Series and Succession of Many Killing Things , to be with Repeated Strokes inflicted on me; And Mightily beg of GOD, that I may not be Left unto any Impatience or Miscarriage under them. I should, as One Free among the Dead , forbid any Disturbance of Mind upon it, if People treat me as if they had Free Liberty to Do what they will to me, and Speak what they will of me; and as I should Pursue no Personal Revenges on them, So, I should pray for them, Father, Forgive them . Tho' I should have done with This World, Yett I should Express a Concern for the Relatives which I Leave behind me, in a Land of Pitts &amp; of Droughts , &amp; fiery flying Serpents . I should utter Words , that may be for the Instruction and Advantage of People that are about me; and Lay hold on Opportunities to say what I could for the Advancement of Piety among them. I should fly to Passages in the Word of GOD that may be Suitable for me; and fetch Support and Comfort from thence, in the Multitude of my Thoughts within me . I should, with Continual Acts of Resignation , Committ my Spirit into the Hands of my FATHER, and my SAVIOUR; with Assurance of my Speedy Reception into a Paradise , where I shall be Comforted . I should Endeavour to Look into the Heavenly World , and Rejoice in the View of the Joy Sett before me there, and Count the Light Afflictions here which are but for a Moment , abundantly Compensated in that far More Exceeding &amp; Eternal Weight of Glory . In these Things I should Propound a Conformity to my Crucified JESUS. Thus Dying , Behold, I Live ! And finding myself brought into these Dispositions and these Exercises , the Faith of what must most certainly follow hereupon fills me with Joy Unspeakable &amp; full of Glory .</field>

This work has been frequently reprinted, most often under the title Essays to do Good . 12 Diary , I, 532, n. 13 The Diary entry for May 1, 1711 (II, 68) describes yet another possibility. "What if I should be so communicative, as to lodge my Paterna a while in the hands of my Brother-in-Law, Mr. Walter ; but with a due Care to preserve Modesty and Concealment? It may sensibly assist him to discharge his Ministry, and improve in experimental Christianity!" 14 "Mr. Holmes, you are getting into that Mather bog. I warn you, you will never get out of it again." Quoted by Holmes in "The Mather Bibliography," PBSA , XXXI (1937), 67. 15 Cotton Mather: The Puritan Priest , p. 33. 16 Thomas James Holmes, Cotton Mather: A Bibliography of His Works (1940), III, 1306. 17 The evidence indicates that these pages contain that rare thing—a passage composed originally for "Paterna" and unique to it. For this reason and since they have a kind of morbid fascination in themselves and are rather typical of the book as a whole, I have appended Mather's answers at the end of this article. I have found only one other similar instance. The Diary records (October 13, 1717) Mather's intention to consider and meditate upon the "Heavenly Affections . . . and Impressions . . . made on the Minds of the Writers . . . [of the Scriptures] . . . [when] . . . inspired . . . by . . . the holy Spirit of GOD." Mather adds, "This Design must be pursued. It will be elsewhere more largely spoken to" (II, 479-480); "elsewhere" turns out to be pages 313-315 of "Paterna" where the "Design" is "pursued" in somewhat greater detail. The Diary provides what amounts to a summary of the more fully developed, later passage. 18 I am assuming that the year of Dr. Jenks's death is also that of the sale. The only evidence I have of his ownership is the following passage from Justin Winsor, Memorial History of Boston (1881): "A MS Autobiography by Cotton Mather was sold in the library of the late Rev. Dr. William Jenks of Boston, and is now in the possession of Judge Mark Skinner, of Chicago" (II, 302). 19 I am indebted to Mr. Kendon Stubbs of the University of Virginia's Alderman Library for the bibliographical details presented in these four paragraphs. 20 Possibly, but improbably, p. 355 at one time concluded some kind of structural division and p. 357 began yet another. With the exception of page 206, this is true of all the other blank pages in "Paterna." Page 10 immediately precedes the beginning of "The Fourth Lustre"; page 60, "The Fifth"; page 110, "The Sixth"; and page 126, "The Seventh." But except for page 60 these other blank pages are all numbered. See page 197 and footnote 22 for additional indirect evidence. 21 In the text of "Paterna," this concluding passage immediately follows Mather's description, quoted in the appendix at the end of this article, of his proposed state of mind while " under all the Circumstances of a Crucifixion." 22 This further confirms that the missing sheets at the end did not constitute some new part. From this point on no structural principle is operative and there is simply no basis for division. 23 His statement of September 7, 1683, cannot be taken as conclusive. "My Diaries , wherein I had written the Course of my Study and preaching, and the Resolves of Piety upon my Daily course of Meditation , I have thrown, as useless Papers into the Fire" (I, 73). In spite of this assertion the Diary of 1681 is still with us and the chronological chart gives evidence that the "Diary of 1682" was not only extensive but still available to Mather when writing "Paterna." 24 Cotton Mather: The Puritan Priest , p. 48. 25 One is inclined after close acquaintance with "Paterna" to share the extreme vexation that Ford's cryptic comment on a Mather allusion to "some other papers" nicely reveals. Ford's note merely says, "fortunately not preserved" ( Diary , II, 584). 26 Excluding blank (10, 60, 110, 126, [164 x'd out], and 206) and missing pages as well as the six unnumbered preliminary pages which consist of title page, three blank pages, and two pages in which Mather quotes authorities on the values of parental autobiography. 27 The table which concludes this study identifies all such passages and their location in other works. 28 All of the located passages are marked in my typescript which is available at the McGregor Library. 29 These passages concern what Mather called "Particular Faiths" in a number of which he had been "so baffled" as to necessitate his entering into the margin of "Paterna" a "Caution" against placing too much confidence in them. He states that he added this warning "Several Years" after writing "the Pages of this Book" (p. 125). The date of Parentator , then, has no bearing on our conclusions regarding the terminal date of "Paterna's" composition.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Emily Dickinson and the Machine by S. P. Rosenbaum *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The use of a high-speed, electronic, data-processing machine—more commonly known as a computer—to make a concordance was described by Professor Stephen M. Parrish, the general editor of The Cornell Concordances, in the 1962 volume of Studies in Bibliography . 1 Drawing on his pioneering work in preparing computer concordances to the poetry of Matthew Arnold and William Butler Yeats, Parrish lucidly set forth the particular uses of such concordances as well as the processes involved in making them. He also anticipated and, it is to be hoped, relieved the fears of literary scholars who tend to confuse electronic means and humanistic ends. The third poet scheduled for publication in The Cornell Concordances is Emily Dickinson. Deo in machina volente , a concordance of her complete poems will appear in 1964. In preparing this concordance I have encountered a number of editorial problems, some of which did not arise with the Arnold and Yeats concordances; these problems have to do with the variorum nature of the definitive text, the punctuation and spelling in the poems, the absence of titles, the limitations of IBM type and formats, and the selection of "nonsignificant" words to be omitted from the concordance. The purpose of this paper is to discuss these problems along with the procedures of preparing the poetry for the computer in the hope of shedding some light on the editing of future computer concordances and on the uses of such a concordance for the study of Emily Dickinson's art. But before confronting Emily Dickinson with the machine, it is necessary to explain the background and special features of the definitive text of her poetry on which the concordance was based. Unless the maker of a concordance attempts the extraordinary task of re-editing a text in and through his concordance, his work will be only as good as the editions on which it is based. The history of Emily Dickinson's poetry is a case in point. The state of her manuscripts, the "creative editing" of her first editors, and the feud between the poet's editors and relatives combined to produce a remarkable chaos in the editions of her poetry. Despite this chaos, a combination word-index and concordance 2 to Emily Dickinson's poetry was done by Louise Kline Kelly as a doctoral dissertation in 1951. 3 In a listing confined to nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, Dr. Kelly gives the line-contexts of only those words occuring less than ten times in Emily Dickinson's poetry; words occurring more frequently are simply given a list of references to where the word may be found. Because practically none of Emily Dickinson's poems have titles, these references had to be to the page and line numbers of particular volumes rather than to the poems themselves. And of the five volumes of Emily Dickinson's poetry, only the last— Bolts of Melody —adhered with fidelity to the original manuscripts. Dr. Kelly's dissertation was used by Thomas H. Johnson in preparing the three-volume variorum text, The Poems of Emily Dickinson , 4 which finally ordered the manuscripts and editions of her poetry. But with its addition of forty-one new poems, its arrangement of the poems, and its inclusion of their numerous authorial variants, Johnson's edition rendered Dr. Kelly's concordance obsolete; it can be used only with the older inaccurate editions, just one of which attempts to record important manuscript variants. Yet as various acknowledgments testify, Dr. Kelly's work has been of invaluable aid to scholars and critics, and she has put users of Johnson's edition and of the concordance based on it considerably in her debt. The nature of Johnson's The Poems of Emily Dickinson and the problems it poses for a concordance can best be appreciated by reviewing the states of the manuscripts from which the edition was constructed. Holographs exist for all but 119 of the 1775 poems in the edition, and these manuscripts according to Johnson's analysis exist in one or more of three stages of composition: there are fair copies which Emily Dickinson appears to have finished, there are semifinal drafts which also appear to be finished except for alternative choices of words written between the lines or at the sides or bottoms of the manuscripts, and finally there are worksheet drafts which range from rough jottings to elaborately reworked drafts. Many of Emily Dickinson's poems are to be found in more than one manuscript state, and a number of them exist in slightly different fair copies. The problem of arranging all these manuscripts, grouping versions of the same poem together, and then selecting the main text for each poem was perhaps the editor's most challenging task. In his introduction to The Poems of Emily Dickinson Johnson wrote that the purpose of the edition was "to establish an accurate text of the poems and to give them as far as possible a chronology." 5 As a basis for an accurate chronology Johnson used Theodora Van Wagenen Ward's analysis of Emily Dickinson's changing handwriting. 6 Once a chronology was established and the manuscripts of each poem grouped together, the poems were assigned numbers according to their chronological sequence. The major problem in grouping and numbering the poems was the selection, from among the poems that existed in more than one manuscript, of texts to be given what Johnson calls "principal representation" 7 in large type under the given poem numbers. In order to maintain the chronological order of the poems, Johnson chose, wherever possible, the earliest fair copy of each poem; 8 other versions were given in smaller type below the main text. This decision has resulted in some misunderstanding and misuse of Johnson's edition because the text selected for principal representation is not necessarily the best version of the poem. A later fair copy or an earlier semifinal draft may contain variants that are poetically better than the readings in the earliest fair copy; or the alternative words written at the bottom of a semifinal draft may be preferable to those in the body of the poem. 9 Subsequent users of Johnson's edition—particularly the editors of anthologies—have too often used a poetically inferior text, given principal representation in the definitive edition, when there was no chronological reason for doing so. 10 At times it appears that the size of the type alone confers some special authority or poetic quality to the main texts. Next to the ordering of manuscripts, the most difficult problem in editing Emily Dickinson's poetry must have been the transcribing of her manuscripts into print. When Emily Dickinson's first editors transcribed—perhaps translated is the better term here—the notation of her manuscripts into forms that could be found in a printer's font, the poet's sister Lavinia Dickinson remarked on the result that "The rules of printing are new to me &amp; seem in many cases to destroy the grace of the thought but of course this can't be helped, I suppose." 11 Although Lavinia seems not to have been the reader that her sister was, this comment might well have come from Emily Dickinson herself, had she permitted the printing of her work. But because she remained essentially a private poet, she could indulge her whim—and this she did, particularly in capitalization and punctuation. She not only capitalized with Germanic abandon, she also used several sizes of letters in between capitals and small letters. In punctuation her favorite mark was, of course, the dash, and she used it in a variety of places and in a variety of ways that ranged from slightly elongated commas to what can only be called short lines. Critics who have speculated on the function of these marks usually agree about their importance but disagree about their purpose. It was inevitable that Johnson's transcriptions of Emily Dickinson's capitalization and punctuation would be criticized, 12 but apart from minor errors it seems clear that the only alternative to the impressive accuracy of his transcriptions would be a facsimile edition. Apart from the small detail that it would be impossible to base a concordance on such an edition, a facsimile edition would merely postpone the problem of presenting Emily Dickinson's poetry to any other readers than a small circle of Emily Dickinson experts, bibliographers, and perhaps a cryptographer or two. 13</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Emily Dickinson's capitalization proved to be no problem at all in editing her poetry for a computer because IBM type is all upper case, and her punctuation provided only minor difficulties. The special print wheels that were purchased for The Cornell Concordances equipped the IBM printing machine that would produce the final pages of a concordance with all the punctuation marks in Johnson's edition. 14 Three minor changes in the definitive text were required in fitting Emily Dickinson's punctuation to the machine, however. First, the brackets that Johnson occasionally used to indicate his insertion of a letter or reconstruction of a word in a torn manuscript were silently dropped because brackets were needed for other purposes in the concordance. Secondly, the numbers that Emily Dickinson used twice in her poetry had to be changed from figures to words because the punctuation in her poetry had to be coded by numbers in order to prepare it for the computer. Finally, the eight occasions on which Emily Dickinson used single quotation marks—none of which followed double quotation marks—had to be changed to the double quotation marks usually used in her poetry; this was necessary because the computer's processes of alphabetizing treated single quotation marks as if they were apostrophes and apostrophes as if they were letters. Thus the computer would have alphabetized separately any word preceded by a single quotation mark. If Emily Dickinson's punctuation offered no interestingly difficult problems, the variorum nature of The Poems of Emily Dickinson did. Johnson's edition included not only variants inserted in the manuscripts by the poet, but also variants to be found in differing manuscript versions of the same poem, variants in transcriptions of the poems made by friends, relatives, and editors, and finally variants in the published versions of her poems. The extent of these variants ranges from single words or phrases through lines and stanzas to what can only be called variant versions of complete poems. The inclusion of all of them is the most valuable feature of Johnson's edition, and a concordance that was to utilize them would have to be a variorum concordance. It is important to remember that Emily Dickinson was a private poet, that her poetry was not "finished" and the final choices between variants not made. To ignore the variants and make a concordance only of the earliest versions of the poems would seriously misrepresent the text of the poems that Johnson established and severely limit the value of the concordance. Yet not all kinds of the variants given in The Poems of Emily Dickinson were worth including in the concordance. Since the concordance is to the poet's words, variants only in spelling, 15 punctuation, and word-order were excluded; but when any of these types of variants accompanied a variant wording, they were retained in the concordance. Variants in line and stanza order were omitted because there was no way of representing them in the single lines that are the units of a concordance. Also excluded were published variants in poems for which there were manuscripts or reliable transcripts. Johnson's inclusion of all published variants makes a fascinating record of editorial corruption, but there was no point in perpetuating these corruptions in a concordance. 16 Variants deriving from transcripts of poems which also exist in holograph manuscripts yielded a thornier group of problems. The sources of these transcripts and their varying degrees of reliability are matters too involved to summarize here. Suffice it to say that variants in transcripts noted by Johnson as probably deriving from manuscripts now lost were included. Determining what variants to include was of little help in the much more difficult problem of deciding how they were to be included. In The Poems of Emily Dickinson the variants are given either in the separate versions 17 listed after the principally represented text or at the end of the poems in which variants appear as alternative choices in manuscript. The principal editorial problem was how to present these separately noted variants in the individual lines of poetry. The simplest solution would have been to treat all variants as if they were variant lines. This could be done by filling out the variant word or phrase with the parts of the line that were invariant and then marking the line with the letter "V", next to the line number, as an indication of a variant line. This procedure, while obviously the way to handle variants that were complete lines, had serious disadvantages when used with parts of lines. To produce a variant line when there was in fact only a variant word is a somewhat misleading representation of the text that would increase the automatic word-frequency counts to be made by the computer and included as an appendix to the concordance. Given the number of Emily Dickinson's variants, the changes in frequencies could be extensive. Such a solution would also fail to show a very important aspect of the variant's context: the word or words for which the variant was introduced. A single method for handling all variants was abandoned, therefore, and the kinds of variants were treated in different ways according to whether they were single words, phrases, stanzas, or versions of an entire poem. 18 Variant words, then, were included in the concordance by enclosing them in brackets and inserting them into the line of the principal text after the word for which they were variant. When more than one variant was given for a word, the alternative variants were separated from each other within the brackets by a slash mark. Thus Emily Dickinson's description of despair in the next to last line of poem #640 ("I cannot live with You—"), together with the two variants written in the manuscript for the last word in the line, appears as follows in the concordance: AND THAT WHITE SUSTENANCE—[EXERCISE / PRIVILEGE] Here as elsewhere in the concordance the word or words that the variants replace can usually be determined simply by noting the number of syllables in the variant and in the words preceding the bracketed insertion. By including variant words in this manner it was possible for the concordance to juxtapose different variants with the words for which they were variants and—most important—to index the variant as well as the invariant words. 19 Editing variant phrases for inclusion within the line, alongside the phrases for which they were variants, proved to be the most difficult problem in preparing Emily Dickinson for the machine. Variant phrases cannot be treated merely as variant words because frequently the phrases cannot be matched, word for word, with the phrases in the main text. Even if they could be always matched, breaking up the phrases would mean ignoring the unity—and hence often the meaning—of the phrases. Sometimes it was impossible to do otherwise. But in many instances the words of a variant phrase could be kept together. The variants, for example, to the phrase "so eminent a sight" (poem #1265, line 4) in a worksheet draft are "Another such a might", "So adequate", and "So competent a sight". To treat these phrases merely as variant words would obscure the relationships between the adjectives and nouns—and thus partly defeat one of the principal purposes of a concordance which is to provide the contexts of the indexed words. By keeping the words of the phrases together and by separating alternate variants with slash marks, it is possible to indicate which adjectives go with which nouns. The line, then, as it was edited for the concordance, appears as follows: I FAMISH [PERISH] TO BEHOLD SO EMINENT A SIGHT [ANOTHER SUCH A MIGHT / SO DELICATE A MIGHT / SO ADEQUATE A MIGHT / SO COMPETENT A SIGHT] 20 In this line, as in most of the others where variant phrases were worked in, it is again possible to see how far back in the line the phrase refers by counting syllables. When the variant phrase differs in the number of syllables from the phrase in the main text, the sense of the phrase usually makes clear what it is a variant of. When on occasion even this does not occur, the user of the concordance must have recourse to Johnson's edition which, in any case, should never be very far away from the concordance. Sometimes the editing of variant phrases for insertion into the lines of a principal text involved the deletion of words in the main text that were repeated in the variant, or the repetition of words in the main text that were omitted from the variant phrase, as in #1265. In poem #1448, for example, the two variant phrases for "Intent upon it's 21 own career" are "Intent upon it's mission quaint" and "circuit quaint". In fitting these words into the line, the first three words of the first variant phrase were not repeated in the variant after appearing in the main text. In the concordance the line reads as follows: INTENT UPON IT'S OWN CAREER [MISSION QUAINT / CIRCUIT QUAINT] And in poem #1343, line 2, Emily Dickinson wrote as variants for the phrase "Was all that saved", first "alone sustained—" and then simply "upheld—". Johnson, to make the variant clearer, uses a bracketed "Alone" with "upheld"; here as elsewhere this clarification of variants was followed, and the line appears in the concordance as, WAS ALL THAT SAVED [ALONE SUSTAINED— / ALONE UPHELD—] A BEE It should be stressed, however, that this editing procedure does not involve adding or removing words from Emily Dickinson's poetry, but simply filling out elliptical phrases with words from the main text or removing repetitions that were used to indicate the place of a variant phrase in a line. Even with these procedures, it was not always possible to avoid all repetition, as is seen in the example from poem #1343. Nor was it always possible to keep the different words of a variant phrase together. Sometimes the various combinations requiring insertion were too complex to be fitted together as one or more variant phrases; in these cases the phrases were treated as separate words or combined into separate variant lines. The texts that involved this kind of editing were almost always worksheet drafts whose definitive reconstruction is impossible for an editor, let alone a concordance-maker. 22 Sometimes the inclusion of a variant phrase would have meant the repeating of nearly an entire line in order to keep the words of a variant phrase together. In these cases it seemed advisable to separate the words rather than swell the bulk of the concordance and the totals of the word-frequencies. When a variant phrase was in effect a variant line—when, in other words, it lacked only a word or two of being a completely different line—it was treated as an independent variant line and the missing words were supplied from the original line for which the phrase was a variant. In addition, then, to bracketed variant words and variant phrases, a variorum concordance to Johnson's edition had to make use of variant lines. A given variant was handled as a variant line when all, or nearly all, the words in the line differed from the corresponding line in the principally represented text—or when complicated variant phrases could not be fitted into the lines of the main text. Two different kinds of variant line were used: numbered and unnumbered. Numbered variant lines consist of lines clearly variant to a given line in the main text; the number of the variant line is the same as that of the line for which it was variant, the only difference in the identification of the two lines being a "V" alongside the number of the variant line. Unnumbered variant lines—lines marked with a "V" but given no line number—were used for unplaced variant lines to a poem and for lines and stanzas of poems that were not included in the text chosen for principal representation by Johnson. In poem #1393 ("Lay this Laurel on the One"), for instance, a draft of the poem has an opening four-line stanza that Emily Dickinson omitted from the fair copy that was sent in a letter. In the concordance each line of the omitted stanza is given as an unnumbered variant line. The distinction, in short, between numbered and unnumbered variant lines in the concordance is difference between alternative and additional lines of a poem. The Poems of Emily Dickinson includes not only variant words, phrases, lines, and stanzas, but also what amount to variant poems. For ten poems in Johnson's edition the main texts are given as double versions of the same poem; since these constitute two poems under one number, it was necessary to combine them in some way for the concordance. 23 This was done either by listing certain words of one version as variants to the other—as in poems #494, #1213, and #1282 where the differences are quite minor—or through the use of numbered and unnumbered variant lines. How this was done can be seen in the way the most famous double-version poem—#216 ("Safe in their Alabaster Chambers—")—was handled in the concordance. The 1859 version of this poem was taken as the main text in the concordance, and the lines of both the 1861 fair copy and its worksheet draft were treated as variants to the 1859 version. The additional lines and stanzas of the 1861 manuscripts were clearly not variant to specific lines of 1859 manuscript, hence they had to be listed as unnumbered additional variant lines. And just as the arrangement in Johnson's edition does not imply any evaluation of the quality or authority of the two versions, so in the concordance the unnumbered variant lines are not any less significant or valuable than the numbered ones. Other editorial problems involved in making a variorum concordance to Johnson's edition centered around the punctuation of variant words and phrases. When the manuscript punctuation of single-word variants differs from the main text, the difference is usually a dash following the variant. These were not reproduced in the concordance because Emily Dickinson seems to have used the mark mainly to separate alternative variants. The punctuation of variant phrases was followed exactly in the concordance because of the greater potential significance of punctuation in the meaning of phrases. When the final punctuation of the phrase was identical with that in the main text, it is given after the bracketed variant phrase or phrases—thus indicating that the punctuation is the same for both readings. When the terminal punctuation of variant phrases differed from that in the main text, the variant punctuation follows the variant phrase in the brackets, and the final punctuation of the principal-text phrase precedes the bracketed insertion of variants. Two types of variant "punctuation" had, nevertheless, to be omitted from the concordance. Even with the special printwheels made for the Cornell concordances, it was impractical if not impossible to write a program and set up an IBM printer to print lines either under or through words. Thus all cancels and italics in the manuscripts had to be dropped. This is not a particularly serious sacrifice with the cancels because they are so infrequent in Emily Dickinson's manuscripts. Less than one per cent of the more than 100,000 words in her manuscripts are crossed out. There are even fewer instances of underlined variants, yet these have greater significance because Emily Dickinson appears to have indicated to herself—at the time of composition or revision—the alternative choices she preferred by underlining them. Yet Johnson notes instances where later fair copies of poems did not adopt the underlined variants to be found in earlier semifinal or worksheet drafts of a poem, and he concludes that "the mood of the moment played itspart." 24 The inability of the computer and its peripheral equipment to convey the results of these moods is one of the small but unfortunate sacrifices involved in combining Emily Dickinson and the machine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Before the variants were edited into the lines of the main texts in Johnson's edition, certain corrections had to be made in the edition itself. As Jay Leyda notes in his valuable review, 25 the thoroughness of the edition throws the smallest errors into sharp relief. Because these errors and other new discoveries affecting Johnson's edition are not widely known, it is perhaps worthwhile to detail here the modifications made in The Poems of Emily Dickinson for the concordance. The edition actually used for the concordance was not the 1955 first printing of the first edition, but the 1958 second printing. The differences—with one important exception—are to be found in such minor alterations as the change of "Appendixes" to the less grammatically controversial "Appendix" and the printing right side up of a line of type that appears upside down in the first printing. The important exception is the list entitled "Corrections" that is hidden away on the verso of the appendix title page of the second printing. The substantive changes in the poetry itself to be found in this list are the corrections of "teases" to "teazes" (#319, l. 6), "has" to "had" (#1254, l. 1 of the worksheet draft), "revelry" to "revery" (#1526, l. 12 of the Todd transcript), "the" to "a" (#87, l. 2). 26 Also adopted in the concordance were corrections of errors noted by Charles R. Anderson; these include changes of "the" to "this (#1068, l. 11 of the copy sent to Niles), the addition of a dash at the end of a line (#1271, l. 7), and the addition of "swift" to the list of variants for the phrase "sudden legacy" in the worksheet draft of #1333. 27 Corrections I have made while preparing Johnson's text for the computer include changes of "unknow" to "unknown" (#78, l. 8 of the pencilled copy), "Feet" to "Fete" (#794, variant note to l. 16), "world" to "would" (#1133, variant note to l. 8), "he" to "her" (#1496, variant note to l. 11), and "departure" to "departing" (#1773, variant note to l. 3). 28 In his review of Johnson's edition, Leyda also noted that the number of poems in Emily Dickinson's canon was less that the 1775 given by Johnson because in three instances, poems numbered separately are actually versions of other poems. 29 After writing his review Leyda discovered that the last poem in the canon was a stanza from a variant version of #1068 ("Further in Summer than the Birds"). 30 These important modifications of Johnson's edition are noted in the preface to the concordance, but Johnson's original numbering was not changed because of the possible confusions that would result for the reader if all the numbers after #331 were changed. The principle followed in emending Johnson's text was to adopt substantive corrections involving the addition or deletion of words in the poems, but not to include corrections of the ordering of words or the numbering of poems. Another editorial problem related to Johnson's numbering of the poems was the difficulty of identifying the poems merely by their numbers. Only twenty-six 31 of the poems in Emily Dickinson's canon have titles supplied by the poet herself. Contrary to the prevalent thinking in telephone companies and the Post Office, numbers alone are not particularly easy things to remember. Not very many readers know the Psalms by their numbers and even fewer can identify Shakespeare's sonnets by theirs; it did not seem reasonable, therefore, that there would be any more readers familiar enough with Emily Dickinson's poems to identify them simply by their numbers. And to identify the lines of a poem only by number would render the concordance practically useless for any one using it with an edition or an anthology that does not give Johnson's numbering of the poems. The alternative for the editor of a concordance of making up titles for 1,749 poems was also unattractive—particularly since this had been tried with rather horrible results in the first editions of Emily Dickinson's poems. The problem of identifying her poems in the concordance was solved by using as a "title" as much of the first line of each poem as the format of the concordance allowed. This turned out to be twenty-four spaces. In these were put all the complete words of the first line that would fit. In several cases this solution meant that two poems had similar titles,—as, for example, with "The Butterfly's" (#1244) and "The Butterfly's Numidian" (#1387). Another possible solution to the problem of titles was to use parts of words in handling similar first lines, but this was abandoned; besides creating ugly and non-existent words, this method had rather ambiguous possibilities when applied to the shortening of, for example, the third word in "The Butterfly's Assumption". The twenty-six titles that Emily Dickinson herself used were treated as lines in the concordance and indexed along with the lines of the poems. The only difference here was that in place of a line number the symbol "T" was used to indicate the "line" in question was actually the title of a poem. The following excerpt from the concordance illustrates the manner in which the shortened first lines were used to identify the lines of the poems. It also shows how brackets and the "V" were used to handle variants in the concordance. INDEX WORD TEXT FIRST LINE POEM LINE DRUM AND BRING THE FIFE, AND TRUMPET, AND BEAT UPON THE DRUM-- AWAKE YE MUSES NINE, 1 39 A SERVICE, LIKE A DRUM--.............. I FELT A FUNERAL, IN MY 280 6 FIRM TO THE DRUM--.................. UNTO LIKE STORY—TROUBLE 295 18 THE EARTH HAS SEEMED TO ME A DRUM,....

DID YOU EVER STAND IN A 590 14 This excerpt also indicates how the format of the concordance takes care of lines longer than forty-six spaces by doubling them back and omitting the spaced dots that link a single line with its first-line title. Lines longer than sixty-nine spaces—all that an eighty-space IBM card could consistently handle in addition to poem and line numbers—had to be divided. The shortness of Emily Dickinson's lines, even when extended with inserted variants, seldom made this procedure necessary—and then only when variants had been inserted into the lines. Line 6 of #1420, for example, appears with all its variants as follows: BEFORE THE QUICK [ RIPE / PEAL / DRUM / DRUMS / BELLS / BOMB / BURST / FLAGS / STEP / TICK / SHOUTS / PINK / RED / BLADE] OF DAY The first part of this line, followed by an ellipsis, is given in the excerpt from the concordance. The second part of the line would be preceded by an ellipsis in the concordance; in this particular example, however, the line had to be divided into three parts, and the middle section of the line is both preceded and followed by ellipses. One very important feature of the format of the concordance is the arrangement of lines under an index word. As the excerpt reveals, the lines are arranged according to Johnson's numbering of the poems, and this means that they appear in approximate chronological order. A table keying the poem numbers to their assigned dates of composition in Johnson's edition will appear in the preface to the concordance, thus permitting the user to examine at a glance the chronological use of any indexed word in Emily Dickinson's poetry. 32 The last major editorial decision that had to be faced before giving Emily Dickinson to the machine concerned the kinds of words to be omitted from the concordance. For reasons primarily of cost it is not feasible to index every occurrence of non-essential words such as "a" and "the". To list every occurrence of these two particular words in Emily Dickinson's poetry would involve the addition of 2,680 and 6,134 lines respectively to the concordance—an increase of approximately ten per cent in the bulk of the concordance. The number of these kinds of words omitted from the concordance is quite small, compared to the number customarily omitted from manual concordances; the only consideration here was space, whereas the sheer labor involved in a hand concordance makes it desirable to omit as many words as possible. The following is a list of the principal words omitted from the indexing of the concordance; in addition, all forms of these words—plurals, contractions, etc.—were also omitted: a although an and another at both but can could each either for from here how however if in into it itself must no nor not now of on or other should so than that the their them then there therefore these they this those though through thus to too upon what when where whether which who why would Also deleted were all forms of the verbs "do" and "have", and all forms of the verb "to be" except "be" itself which was kept because of Emily Dickinson's unusual and extensive use of its subjunctive form. "Like" and "as" were retained to provide lists of Emily Dickinson's similes. Also kept in were pronouns that are almost always omitted from concordances, manual or machine. All occurrences of "I", "we", "you", "he", and "she" together with their other forms will appear in the concordance because of their relevance to biographical and "persona" studies. Some recent studies have shown, however, that these so-called "non-significant" words omitted from the concordance are actually very important in analyses of style. 33 But for those who need these words in studying Emily Dickinson, all is far from lost. It is possible to retrieve them from the complete tape of the concordance which will be stored at Cornell University and available to anyone who wishes to analyze Emily Dickinson's poetry in ways beyond what the concordance allows. 34</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV In order to explain the remaining editorial problems that arise when the poetry of Emily Dickinson is finally confronted by the machine, it is necessary to outline the processes by which a computer can be used to make a concordance. After the text has been edited for the computer, the first step in transmitting it to the machine is to have the poetry punched, a line at a time, on IBM cards. Also punched with each line are identifying poem and line numbers. These cards are the basic data of the concordance, each card with its line providing the context for any indexed word within it. Because the concordance will be only as accurate as the cards, the punching of Emily Dickinson's poetry was, in effect, done twice. The first operator of the machine that punches the cards reproduces the text by "typing" it, but instead of printing the letters, the machine punches holes in the IBM cards. Another operator then repeats this procedure with the same cards on what is called a "verifier". The verifier checks electromagnetically to see that the holes already punched in a given card are the same as the operator of the verifier indicates through his keyboard that there should be. Any discrepancy between the two operators' work is caught by the verifier and has to be corrected—or the card marked as defective—before the operator of the verifier can proceed. The only errors, then, that can survive this operation are identical mistakes made by the two operators. In order to check on these, all the cards were run through the printer—a machine that prints out the contents of the cards—and proofread against the text. Some idea of the accuracy obtainable through this method of punching and verifying—a method much more accurate than the ordinary routines of printing and proofreading—can be seen in the fact that only six errors were discovered in a text of over 100,000 words. Three of these mistakes, incidentally, were due to the editor's handwriting; the other three were identical mistakes made by the two operators. The total amount of time needed for punching and verifying was about 200 hours. After the complete text of Emily Dickinson's poems was punched, an additional 1,775 cards consisting of the shortened first-line titles of her poems were punched. Each of these cards was placed before the cards containing the lines of the poem for which it was the identifying title, and then the entire deck of cards—some 25,000 of them—was transferred onto magnetic tape. Emily Dickinson was now ready for the machine. The following summary of what happens when the text is fed into the computer is based on the explanation given by the concordance's programmer, Mr. James A. Painter, in his preface to the Yeats concordance. 35 The program—the instructions written by the programmer to tell the machine what to do and when to do it—consists of four phases: input, sorting, output, and correction. During the input phase of the program, the computer first scans the magnetic tape and breaks each line of poetry into its component words, attaching to each word the complete line from which it comes as well as the line's identifying poem title and poem and line numbers. These words are then checked against a list of words to be omitted that was previously stored in the magnetic-core "memory" of the computer. The machine then transfers the words to be indexed, together with their lines, titles, and numbers, to a new series of tapes called "word blocks". In the sorting phase of the program each word block is alphabetized, 36 and then the individual word blocks are merged and alphabetized with one another. The amount of time taken by the input and sorting parts of the program was around ten hours: six for indexing and four for checking. In the third, or output, phrase of the program, the results of the final tape—which now contained all the words together with their contexts in alphabetical order—are listed by an IBM printer. Such features of the format as indentation of the entries after an index word or the use of spaced dots to separate these entries from their titles were also automatically done by the printer. The amount of time needed to print out the whole concordance was approximately ten hours, printers being among the slowest of a computer's auxiliary equipment. In the final phrase of the program, editorial corrections involving the addition, replacement, or deletion of words and lines were made from this printing out of the tape. But before they could be made, two final editorial problems had to be met: the discrimination of homographs and the use of cross-references. Because the user of a concordance can distinguish homographs for himself from the contexts of their lines, the only homographs that had to be separated were those involving omitted words. The nouns "art", "will", "might", and "may", the verb "wilt" and the adjective "wont" turned out to be the only homographs included with omitted words; they were all separated from the non-essential verbs of the same spelling and retained in the concordance. The problem of cross references is particularly troublesome with Emily Dickinson's poetry because of her erratic spelling. Painter had worked out for the other computer-concordances a program for automatically cross referencing hyphenated compounds, but this was of little help because Emily Dickinson rarely used a hyphen. Her non-hyphenated compounds were cross-referenced by the editor when the compounds were unusual enough so that a user in search of all occurrences of a word could not be expected to anticipate it. "Ashine", for example, was cross-reference from "shine" but there is no reference from "stir" to "astir". Misspellings and uncommon variant spellings were cross referenced, but only when they were not either alphabetically adjacent to each other or separated merely by different forms of the same word. Thus "woe", which comes right after "wo" in the concordance, was not cross referenced, but "conceive" and "concieve" were. Much of the cross referencing was only one way, from the usual to the unusual; "eye" is cross referenced to "e'e", but not vice versa. In cases where more than one spelling appears in the text, the cross referencing was done both ways, lest the user suppose Emily Dickinson was a consistent misspeller. There is, of course, no end to cross referencing, but for the user who wants to be certain he has all the forms of a given word, there is a record of the poet's vocabulary included as an appendix of word-frequencies at the end of the concordance. Here all the words in the concordance are listed according to their frequencies. 37 After the corrections and the cross references have been decided upon, they are punched onto cards, transferred to tape, and then fed into the computer to modify the final tape of the concordance. The results of the final tape are listed by the printer and its special print wheels. Ideally, the total time involved from the first punching of cards to this printing is about a month of eight-hour days. Unfortunately, however, more time is needed in the still unautomated part of the procedure that involves cutting the pages of the concordance apart and pasting page-numbers on each sheet. But once this throwback to the scriptorium is overcome, the pages can be delivered to the press which publishes them by photo-offset, reducing the size of the original IBM type in order to fit the concordance into a manageable volume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V If, as Dr. Johnson maintained with unimpeachable authority, the making of dictionaries is "dull work," it would seem to follow that the making of concordances is deadly dull work. With an electronic computer, much of the dullness can be left to the machine to endure. The problems remaining for the maker of the concordance, while numerous, complex, and often undeniably irritating, are really not dull. For some, however, they may appear to be trivial problems; whether or not they are depends largely upon the ends that their solutions serve—upon, in other words, the uses of a computer concordance to the works of Emily Dickinson. Most people who know what a concordance is assume that its primary function is to locate poems or parts of poems that the user has forgotten. In the case of Emily Dickinson's poetry this service is not quite as insignificant as it might be for other poets because of the history of the publication of her manuscripts. As a tool, then, for restoring lines and stanzas, appearing elsewhere as complete poems, to the poems from which they were originally taken, the concordance is useful. Yet this function hardly justifies the human and inhuman labor and expense involved in preparing a computer concordance. A much more important value appears in the fact that a concordance to Emily Dickinson's poems is an index to the words, and consequently the images and ideas, of her art. 38 And unless the words that present these images and ideas are given in their contexts—contexts which include the poet's alternative choices for these words—they remain, as one critic has put it, "inert". 39 Through the inclusion of variants and through the chronological order of the entries under a word, the concordance could be indispensable for studies of Emily Dickinson's poetic development. The concordance is also potentially valuable, if used in the right ways, for biographical and canonical studies, and the preservation of the tape of the concordance makes it possible to go on to metrical and variorum studies. The usefulness of the concordance extends even beyond the poetry of Emily Dickinson, for the uniform features of the Cornell Concordances of Matthew Arnold and W. B. Yeats invite a variety of detailed comparison studies—studies which will be extended with the subsequent appearance of concordances to such poets as William Blake, Ben Jonson, and Andrew Marvell. It must be admitted, however, that one use of a concordance has been inevitably lost by collaborating with a computer. This function was eloquently described by F. S. Ellis in the preface to his lexical concordance of Shelley published in 1892: To those who would induce time to spread his wings, and who would drive from their spirits the cloud of minor vexations with which life is beset, I can heartily recommend the making of a concordance. The day when I began this work, six years since, seems but yesterday. It is, alas, no longer feasible to ignore six years of minor vexations by making a concordance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * This paper is based on the preface to my forthcoming A Concordance to the Poems of Emily Dickinson (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press). 1 "Problems in the Making of Computer Concordances," XV, 1-14. See also the next paper in this volume (pp. 15-31) "Electronic Computers and Elizabethan Texts" by Ephim G. Fogel. 2 The distinction between a word-index and a concordance is often blurred—as in the definition of a concordance given by Webster's Third New International Dictionary : "an alphabetical verbal index showing the places in the text of a book or in the works of an author where each principal word may be found often with its immediate context. . . ." The last part of the definition equivocates on the key issues; the definition also fails to note the existence of concordances to languages. For a clear distinction between word-indexes and concordances see Roberto Busa's introduction to Varia Specimina Concordantiarum of Aquinas's liturgical hymns (Milan, 1951). According to Father Busa a word-index is "a list which gives for each entry the numerical listing of quotations only" whereas "when under each word all the lines that contain this word are transcribed, one by one, we have the 'concordance'" (p. 8). 3 A Concordance of Emily Dickinson's Poems, The Pennsylvania State College. 4 Cambridge, Mass., 1955. 5 Poems , I, lxi. 6 Poems , I, xlix-lix. 7 Poems , I, lxi. 8 For the sequence of selection when no fair copy existed, see Poems , I, lxi-lxii. 9 The most famous example of this is to be found in "I taste a liquor never brewed—" (poem #214) in which the variant last line, "Leaning against the—Sun—" adds a perfectly appropriate concluding image that is absent from the original line, "From Manzanilla come!" which, in effect, adds only a rum name. 10 Johnson's own one-volume edition, The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson (1960), unfortunately also does this. In his preface Johnson says he has adopted only those variants underlined by the poet, but his practice here is inconsistent. 11 Quoted in Millicent Todd Bingham's Ancestors' Brocades (1945), p. 60. 12 Edith Perry Stamm, for example, in her article "Emily Dickinson: Poetry and Punctuation," Saturday Review , March 30, 1963, pp. 26-27, 74, criticizes Johnson for not recognizing that the dashes are elocution marks to guide the reciter of the poems. Her theory is easily disposed of simply by trying to read facsimiles of the poems according to these supposed marks. 13 As a supplement to Johnson's edition a facsimile edition of at least the best poems would be welcome. With the current techniques of electroprinting, however, the individual student of Emily Dickinson can make a good beginning for himself by reproducing the facsimiles in Johnson's edition, in Bolts of Melody , and in Charles R. Anderson's Emily Dickinson's Poetry (N.Y. 1960). 14 The ordinary print wheels used by the IBM "printer" consist only of periods, parentheses, hyphens, and commas for punctuation marks. The Arnold concordance, which was printed before the costly print wheels could be purchased, was done without punctuation, but the Yeats concordance is fully punctuated. 15 But variant spellings that perhaps indicated different words—"straight" and "strait", for example—were included. 16 Three exceptions were made in applying this principle. Published variants for poems #59 and #160 were included because they appear to derive from manuscripts now lost. And the published second stanza of #57 was retained because it poetically complements the stanza of a poem whose manuscript had been torn off at the top. Poems in Emily Dickinson's canon that exist only in their published forms were, of course, included as such. 17 Johnson often notes in his edition the nature and location of variants in another version of the poem—but not always. Consequently it was necessary in preparing the concordance to collate all variant versions with the main text. 18 This classification of variants had to ignore whether the variants were from single worksheet or semifinal drafts; from worksheet, semifinal, and fair copies of the same poem; or from differing fair copies, semifinal drafts, and worksheet drafts. To indicate the provenance of each variant in the concordance would have entailed a bewildering system of signs; the only sensible alternative seemed to be to combine them, regardless of their sources, and to refer the user of the concordance to Johnson's edition for their origins. 19 One result of combining variants was that words repeated in different manuscripts were not repeated as such in the concordance. The concordance could not represent within the limits of a single line the stages of composition beyond the including of different variants after the word used in the earliest finished version. Thus, for example, in poem #329 ("So glad we are—a Stranger'd deem") there are two manuscripts, the fair copy represented in large type and a semifinal draft from which it was redacted. In the semifinal draft the last line of the poem, "Could not decide between—", is given as "Could not discern between—" and then variant choices for "discern" are listed as "conclude" and "decide". In giving this line in the concordance as COULD NOT DECIDE [DISCERN / CONCLUDE] BETWEEN it seemed unnecessary to repeat "decide" in the brackets to indicate that the word had also been a variant choice at one stage of the poem's composition. 20 An example of a variant in lining not handled in the concordance also occurs in this line—or in these lines, to be exact. In the worksheet draft of the poem the line is given as two lines: "I perish to behold" and "Another such a might". If the lining of the worksheet draft were kept in the fair copy, the variants would have been handled as variant lines. But as the concordance has to follow the lining of the main texts in Johnson's edition, what was a variant line in an earlier draft is a variant phrase in the fair copy and in the concordance. 21 The eccentricities of Emily Dickinson's punctuation were, of course, followed in the concordance. 22 See, for example, poem #533 ("Two Butterflies went out at Noon—") where a fair copy was later turned into a worksheet draft. Johnson's own ordering and lining of the variants in this manuscript have been questioned by William H. Matchett, PMLA , LXXVII (1962), 436-441. See also poem #1591, a worksheet draft so rough that Johnson attempted no reconstruction; in preparing it for the concordance, all that could be done was to group together the phrases that appeared to be variants of one another. 23 Nine of these poems—216, 433, 494, 824, 1213, 1282, 1357, 1358, and 1627—are labelled as versions I and II or earlier and later versions; poem #148 simply has an "or" separating the two versions given in a single manuscript. Johnson's editorial practice in giving double versions of these poems seems inconsistent, for in some of them he seems to have abandoned his procedure of giving principal representation to the earliest version of the best manuscript. In other cases, the minor differences between the double versions hardly make the distinction worthwhile, unless it was also to be applied to more radical differences between two or more versions of a poem given only a single representation in the edition. There was, at any rate, no way of including the double versions as such in the concordance without modifying in some way Johnson's numbering of the poems in the canon. 24 Poems , I, xxxv. 25 New England Quarterly , XXIX (1956), 239-245. 26 The list of corrections also adds dashes at the end of #290, l. 4 and #299, l. 4 of the copy sent to Susan Dickinson. 27 Emily Dickinson's Poetry , pp. 312, 321, 324, and 325. 28 There are also some very minor errors in the line numbering used to key variants to poems. These errors and their corrections are as follows: # 532, for 20] read 19] # 577, " 25] " 26] " " 26] " 27] " " 27] " 28] " " 28] " 29] #1479 " 7-8] " 7-8 #1508 " 15] " 11] #1646 " 6. " 5. 29 #331 is an early variant of #342, #992 is an adaptation of #937, and #1616 is a slight adaptation of #1525. See NEQ , pp. 242-243. 30 The version found by Leyda is given in Anderson's Emily Dickinson's Poetry , pp. 324-325; it has one new variant—"candles" for the "candle" given in the Norcross transcript—and this new variant was included in the concordance. 31 Johnson's list of these in Poems , III, 1206, gives only twenty-four, but his edition shows additional titles for #1 (Valentine Week") and #1545 ("Diagnosis of the Bible, by a Boy—"). 32 The table will also incorporate the changes in order and date made after the text of the poems went to press and given by Johnson in his preface, Poems , I, lxv. 33 See, for example, Frederick Mosteller's and David L. Wallace's use of "while", "whilst", "upon", and "enough" in analyzing the authorship of the Federalist papers, "Notes on an Authorship Problem," Symposium of Digital Computers , Annals of the Computation Laboratory of Harvard University , XXXI (1962), 163-197. 34 It should be possible, for instance, to instruct a computer to search the tape and print out all of Emily Dickinson's variant words and lines together with their poem numbers and consequently their approximate dates. Such information could be of considerable value in studying the composition of her poems. 35 "Programmer's Preface," A Concordance to the Poems of W. B. Yeats (1963), pp. xxix-xxxvii. 36 The computer is really working with numbers in binary arithmetric rather than letters, and the words are alphabetized by comparing the numbers of the letters of a word with another word, arranging the two words in numerical order, and then proceeding to another word. If this operation suggests the way an idiot might alphabetize something, it is important to remember that the computer is a highspeed idiot, capable of comparing some 42,000 numbers a second. 37 Frequencies of all the omitted words are given in the preface. 38 Even used merely as a word-index, the value of the concordance extends far beyond the limited but useful "subject" index at the end of Johnson's edition. There are ways, however, in which Johnson's index complements the concordance. 39 Anderson, p. 318.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Red Badge of Courage Manuscript: New Evidence for a Critical Edition by William L. Howarth</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On January 27, 1896, Stephen Crane mailed his original manuscript of The Red Badge of Courage to Willis Hawkins, a longtime friend. 1 Hawkins had the loose sheets sewn and bound, and the manuscript survives today in this condition as part of the Barrett Collection at the University of Virginia's Alderman Library. Crane used five different kinds of legal-cap paper in this manuscript, which represents the second draft of The Red Badge . 2 The two editors who based their texts on manuscript examination 3 have testified that the novel was written on sheets of identical paper. Winterich gives the following uniform specifications: "176 sheets of blue-ruled paper, 12 x 7 11/16 inches, with a red line at the side of each sheet setting off a one inch margin" (Folio, 21). Stallman, who had access primarily to photostatic copies ( Omnibus , vii, xv), repeats that the entire 176 leaves were "written on blue-lined paper having a one-inch red-lined margin at the side of each sheet" ( Omnibus , 202). His dimensions differ slightly from Winterich's, but he emphasizes uniformity: "each sheet measures 12 11/16 by 7½ inches." A close examination reveals that there is actually a great deal of variance in the five papers' dimensions, lineation, and margins. Each paper has its distinctive physical characteristics, and there is no feature that is uniformly shared by all five. They have been labeled alphabetically here because they appear in this general sequence in the manuscript's foliation. A sheet of paper A is 320 mm. long and 195-197 mm. wide. It has 28 horizontal lines, each separated by a 10 mm. space, and a vertical rule of three lines: pink, blue, pink. Its marginal column is 30 mm. wide and unlined. Its head space is 45 mm. wide, and its tail space is 5 mm. wide. The paper has no water mark, chain lines, or water lines. Crane used 53 sheets of this paper in the second draft, but only 49 are extant: pages 1-40, 45-50, 137, 139, and 193. 4 Pages 41-44 are missing from the bound manuscript, and a presumably different text appears in the 1895 edition, pp. 49-52. A sheet of paper B is 318 mm. long and 200 mm. wide. It has 29 horizontal lines, each separated by a 9.75 mm. space, and a vertical rule of three lines: pink, blue, pink. Its marginal column is 40 mm. wide and lined. Its head space is 37.5 mm. wide, and its tail space is 6 mm. wide. The paper has a water mark which reads HURLBUT | PAPER | MFG. | CO., nine vertical chain lines that are 18.5 mm. apart, and seven horizontal wire lines per 10 mm. space. Crane used 26 sheets of this high-quality paper in the second draft, but only 25 are extant: pages 53-59, 61-65, 90-96, and 98-103. Page 66 was removed from the manuscript, and its text does not appear in the 1895 edition. A sheet of paper C is 316 mm. long and 203-205 mm. wide. It has 28 horizontal lines, each separated by a 9 mm. space, and a vertical rule of only two pink lines. Its marginal column is 40 mm. wide and lined. Its head space is 43 mm. wide, and its tail space is 9 mm. wide. The paper has no water mark, chain lines, or wire lines. Crane used 52 sheets of this cheap paper in the draft, but only 47 are extant: 52, 60, 67-85, 97, 104-125, 127-128, and 132. Pages 86-89 and 126 were all removed from the manuscript, and their text does not appear in the 1895 edition. The versos of paper C are pages of a shorter first draft which Crane had already transcribed into the present (second) draft. Paper C represents 47 first draft pages, with sheets numbered as low as 13 and as high as 92. A sheet of paper D is 317 mm. long and 200 mm. wide. It has 29 horizontal lines, each separated by a 10 mm. space, and a vertical rule of three lines: pink, dark blue, pink. Its marginal column is 42.5 mm. wide and lined. Its head space is 40 mm. wide, and its tail space is 4 mm. wide. The paper has no water mark, chain lines, or wire lines. Crane used nine sheets of paper D in his second draft, and all of them are extant: pages 51, 129-131, 133-136, and 138. Like paper C, the versos of D are canceled first-draft pages, numbered as low as 2 and as high as 12. A sheet of paper E is 320 mm. long and 200 mm. wide. It has 29 horizontal lines, each separated by a 10 mm. space, and a vertical rule of three lines: pink, dark blue, pink. Its marginal column is 40 mm. wide and lined. Its head space is 39 mm. wide, and its tail space varies from 5 to 2.5 mm. wide, since the last horizontal line runs on a downward bias from left to right. The paper has a water mark which reads 'HURLBUT | PAPER | MFG. | CO.', but it has no chain lines or wire lines. There are 51 sheets of paper E extant: pages 140-144, 146-164, and 166-192. Crane may have originally used 52 sheets, for page 165 now appears to be missing. Crane's composition of The Red Badge can be reconstructed by distinguishing the five different papers and noting their appearances in the manuscript. His earliest writing, of course, is in the first draft, where he used only two kinds of paper. He began with paper D, but after twelve pages switched to the cheaper C stock for the pages numbered up to 92. Pages 2-92 of the first draft constitute fragments of chapters I-XIII. Whether or not Crane completed this draft is uncertain, since it would be impossible to guess at what point after page 92 he began his second draft. Stallman mistakenly estimates the length of the first draft "from the fact that one of its pages is numbered 149" ( Omnibus , 216). Yet '149', although it appears on the verso of page 163, is merely a false start for 149 of the second draft, not the first: '149' is on paper E, a paper which does not appear in the first draft. There are several instances of false starts in the second draft which Crane inverted for later use; these are not to be confused with first-draft pages. Crane wrote his second draft of The Red Badge by copying and expanding the shorter first draft. He began writing on paper A and used 51 sheets to transcribe the contents of 44 first-draft pages. Because one sheet, a false start for page 33, was removed and later used for page 139, the paper A "run" consists of only 50 sheets, pp. 1-50. He wrote his first five chapters on these sheets before the supply ran out. Four additional chapters—Six, Seven, and what eventually became Eleven and Twelve—were written on 26 sheets of paper B. But, then in order to conserve paper, Crane canceled the first-draft material on the C and D paper and turned over each sheet to write on its clean back side. Evidently he had not stacked the first-draft sheets carefully as he finished copying, for their old pagination rarely appears in sequence in the second draft. Pages 81-85 of the second draft, for instance, have the following first-draft pages on their versos: 29, 67, 66, 71, 61B. Crane wrote chapters Eight to Ten, Thirteen to Fifteen, and half of Sixteen on 49 sheets of Paper C; the second half of Sixteen and all of Seventeen were written on 8 sheets of paper D. He obtained a fresh paper supply for the final third of his novel, and wrote chapters Eighteen to Twenty-five on 51 sheets of paper E. Some time after he had completed his second draft, he removed a few sheets from the manuscript and replaced others with substituted new material. These insertions and deletions require some critical attention, since they help to outline the growth of the Red Badge text. Throughout his revision of the novel, Crane was preoccupied with the problem of developing effective conclusions for each chapter. Sometimes he dropped pages of exposition and did not replace them, preferring instead to close the chapter with an explicit bit of dialogue or action. This procedure accounts for most of the missing second-draft pages: 66, the last page of chapter Seven; 86-89, the end of chapter Ten; 126, the final page of chapter Fourteen; and 165, the last page of chapter Twenty-one. Crane also removed an entire chapter, pp. 98-103, because it detracted from the dramatic pace of his novel. At other times he re-wrote chapter endings on the backs of first-draft sheets (paper C and D) and inserted them in the place of his original endings. Physical evidence indicates that these sheets are later additions to the manuscripts, and thus underscores the significant fact that each appears as the final page of a chapter. Crane re-wrote the endings of chapters Five, Six, Eleven, and Eighteen on paper C, and the ending of chapter Twenty-five on paper A. For most of the chapters these facts are uninformative, since there is no way of knowing to what extent Crane revised the original ending. In chapters Five and Six, however, the revised endings can be compared with their surviving first-draft counterparts. Page 60, the end of chapter Six, corresponds to the text of page 52 in the first draft. The variants between these two versions are critically significant, because they indicate some of Crane's developing sense of theme and method. Besides softening the general's enthusiasm from "eternal damnation" to "blazes", Crane added a significant paragraph in the revised second draft: As another officer sped his horse after the first messenger, the general beamed upon the earth like a sun. In his eyes was a desire to chant a peaen [ sic. ]. He kept repeating: 'They've held 'em, by Heavens.' This added comparison of the general and the sun links the officer to the awesomely indifferent Deity that broods over the novel's battleground, and the suggestions of his exultant worship introduces a recurring motif that Crane builds around his personification of War as a "blood-red god". Paper differences in the manuscript testify only partially to Crane's revision of The Red Badge . There is more substantial evidence, of course, in the actual changes he made in the text: the deletions, cancellations, and insertions. An editor must understand the genealogy of these changes, especially if he wishes to print those variants which represent Crane's final intentions. Seven different states of writing appear in the two manuscript drafts: six are in Crane's hand, and the other one is in a later non-authorial hand. 5 In the first draft, there are two authorial states: Crane first composed with a blue ink in medium strokes, and later revised with the same. For purposes of distinction, "1st-I" will stand for the composition, and "1st-II" for the revision. Any changes made within the same state will be indicated by lowercase letters: Ia, Ib, Ic, etc. There are four authorial states in the second draft: 2nd-I—original composition (transcription and expansion of 1st-II): a brown-black ink in thin strokes; 2nd-II—first revision of 2nd-I: a blue-black ink in broad strokes; 2nd-III—last revision of 2nd-I: black pencil in Crane's hand; 2nd-IV—pagination changes and large textual deletions: blue pencil or crayon in Crane's hand. The second draft also contains one non-authorial state: 2nd-V—marginalia and typographical changes: black pencil in either a typist's or later reader's hand—not Crane's. The growth of Crane's text from its earliest (1st-I) to its latest (2nd-IV) authorial state can be reconstructed by noting the succession of states and the kind of revision that each makes. A similar study of the non-authorial revision can determine how much the manuscript was altered after it left Crane's hands. Each writing state displays its particular concerns in the revision. For instance, 2nd-II shows the earliest changes from realistic to allegorical characters: "Henry Fleming", "Wilson", "Jim Conklin", and "Simpson" become "a youthful private", "a blatant young soldier", "a tall soldier", and "a corporal". II also begins the task of altering much of the young hero's dialect. III helps to refine some of the name changes ("a blatant young soldier" becomes "a loud soldier"), makes large deletions in some of the novel's "philosophical" chapters, and initiates some inconsistent revision of dialect that survived in the 1895 edition. The dialect changes created a major textual problem that will be discussed below. IV, Crane's blue pencil, appears in only five chapters (Ten through Fourteen). It is used there to cancel extensive passages and renumber both chapter and page numbers. On one occasion, the blue pencil changes a "Fleming" to "the youth", but ordinarily it does not make "literary" revision. V appears infrequently throughout the manuscript. The identity of this hand is extremely doubtful, but it seems to be that of a typist or publisher's reader, because most of the notations are concerned only with typographical matters: capitalization, spelling, or punctuation. Crane's revision of The Red Badge was methodical, yet not particularly thorough. He transcribed the entire first draft by copying and revising (2nd-I). Then he began changing names of characters in II, but upon reaching chapter Nine, he also decided to normalize the dialect of Fleming and Wilson. From chapters Nine through Twelve, Crane made both the name changes and dialect revision in II. He skipped over chapters Thirteen through Seventeen and continued the revision from Eighteen to Twenty-Five. When he finally began touching things up in III, he corrected those chapters that were neglected in II, but also decided at this time to make some additional major revision. In chapters One through Four, he smoothed out a few name changes and, in addition to Fleming and Wilson, normalized the dialects of other major characters. He canceled long descriptions of Fleming's thoughts at the ends of chapters Seven and Ten and completely removed chapter Twelve. In chapters Thirteen through Seventeen, Crane made name and dialect changes in III because he had not touched these chapters during his earlier revision. Possibly he had not revised them in II because he had decided to re-work them extensively, or was already doing so. By this time he had evidently decided against normalizing the dialects of other characters, for only Fleming's and Wilson's were altered here in III. He canceled another descriptive passage at the end of chapter Fourteen and removed its final page. There are paper changes and editorial markings in this section of the manuscript which indicate that Crane did some re-writing on it before and after revision II. When he later decided to insert the section, he tried to bring it into accord with the rest of the text by making the name and dialect changes in III. His effort was casual rather than scrupulous, for some names and dialect passages were left unchanged, and a few of them reached the 1895 edition in this form. Crane's soft blue pencil (IV) was later busy in this area marking canceled passages and re-ordering chapter or page numbers. These changes seem to have been made for someone—a printer, perhaps—who was not familiar with the manuscript. IV canceled only those long passages which had already been canceled in III; the blue pencil may have been emphasizing that this material was not to be copied. Wherever he had removed pages, III or IV supplied "bridges" to make the pagination sequence clear: 66/7, 86/90, 98/104, 126/7, and 165/66. Crane dropped his original chapter Twelve, pp. 98-103, and then later moved up chapter numbers to cover the gap. For some reason he stopped after changing Sixteen to Fifteen, and as a result the final chapter of the manuscript is numbered Twenty-Five, whereas only 24 chapters appear in the corrected 1895 edition. V, the final revising hand, appeared in chapters throughout the manuscript to make occasional marginal notations and grammatical or typographical corrections within the text itself. These markings could have been made by a typist, editor, or possibly even a later scholar. The physical details which have been described in the preceding sections of this paper support the kind of textual evidence that is needed for a critical edition of The Red Badge of Courage . Any editor who assumes the responsibility of examining the novel's manuscript will have to recognize the existence therein of five different papers and seven writing states. These facts are important textual testimony, for without them he could not follow the manuscript's stages of growth. The importance of paper types as evidence of revision has already been discussed. A similar study of the writing states would be of great value to Crane's readers and critics. There are at least three kinds of substantive variants in the manuscript that have definite literary significance: variants between the two drafts, between the three authorial states, and between the authorial and non-authorial states. The changes Crane made between his first and second draft need to be closely examined. He composed the second draft, as it has been said, by copying and expanding the first draft. Although his changes were usually extensive, he frequently transcribed the early version without revising. Sometimes he transcribed too closely, and his new version became garbled. On page 68 of the second draft, for instance, appears the sentence, [All canceled in I ] His accumulated thought upon such subjects were used to form scenes. The error here was not due to Crane's ignorance, but to his scribal fallibility. In the first draft he had written the sentence as follows: All his accumulations upon such subjects were used to form scenes. He had copied the first two words into the second draft when the slightly different version occurred to him. He stopped, canceled "All", changed "his" to "His", wrote the new variant "accumulated", and then continued to copy the sentence without further revision. Crane may have had his grammatical lapses, but he was not always incorrigible. Other errors appear in the second-draft text that resulted from inaccurate transcription. For instance, on page 55 of the second draft is this puzzling sentence: A man near him who up to this time had been working feverishly at his rifle [period canceled ] suddenly and ran with howls. The Appleton editors emended the passage as follows: . . . at his rifle suddenly stopped and ran with howls. (1895, p. 68) Although this reading is sensible and fairly clear, it does not match Crane's first-draft version, which he evidently miscopied in the second draft: . . . at his rifle suddenly dropped it and ran with howls. A full-scale collation of the first draft might reveal other readings that were unintentionally dropped from the second draft and need to be restored. The changes made between early and late authoral states (I, II, III) need to be studied, since the readings Crane canceled are often just as significant as those he inserted. Sometimes the variants demonstrate his stylistic manipulation of even the most ordinary phrases: This advance of the enemy had seemed to the youth like a ruthless hunting . (Ic) . . . pitiless hunting. (Ib) . . . pitiless hunt. (Ia) At other times, they show his conscious effort to replace explicit statements with suggestion: It was merely his habit. 'Oh!', he [merely canceled ] replied in the same tone of calm derision. (Ib) . . . 'Oh,' he merely said as if relieved, 'I thought mebbe yeh did.' (Ia) Crane's revision did not always do his text justice. On one occasion, the meaning of an image was obscured by his cancellation: The little narrow roadway now lay lifeless . There were overturned wagons like sun-dried boulders. The bed of the former torrent . . . (Ib) . . . lay like a lifeless torrent. (Ia) If he had preserved the earlier version, the image of wagons as "sundried boulders" would seem more appropriate than it does now. The alterations Crane made in his climactic scenes are particularly important, because they demonstrate his ability to develop or subdue thematic implications. Critics who have written interpretations of the Jim Conklin death scene will be interested in the following revisions: There could be seen a certain stiffness in the movements of his body, as if he were taking infinite care not to arouse the passion of his wounds. (1895, p. 92) . . . passions . . . (2nd-I) The youth had to follow . (II) . . . follow after. (I) There was a singular race. (Ib) . . . grotesque . . . (Ia) The same purpose was in the tall soldier's face. (II) . . . mysterious purpose . . . (I) And there was a resemblance in him to a devotee of a mad religion . . . (Ib) . . . a priest of some mad religion . . . (Ia) He was waiting with patience for something that he had come to meet . (Ib) . . . that was coming. (Ia) ' God !' said the tattered soldier. (Ib) 'Gawd," . . . (Ia) The youth had watched, spellbound, this ceremony at the place of meeting . (Ib) . . . these rites, this dance. (Ia) The red sun was pasted in the sky like a wafer . (1895, p. 99) . . . like a fierce wafer. (2nd-I) The red sun . . . like a fierce wafer. (1st-Ib) The fierce red sun . . . like a wafer. (1st-Ia) Another series of revisions demonstrates Crane's ability to improvise variations on a symbolic refrain. In the unforgettable "chapel" scene, the youth discovers the corpse of a soldier seated upright against a tree. The corpse's eyes repel him, but he is particularly horrified by its ant-covered mouth: The eyes . . . had changed to the dull hue to be seen on the side of a dead fish. The mouth was open . (1895, p. 80) . . . opened. (2nd and 1st) Only a few pages later, the youth stands on a hill above the furious battle-ground and gazes downward: His eyes had an awe-struck expression. He gawked in the direction of the fight . (2nd-Ib) His lower jaw hung down. (2nd-Ia and 1st) Crane probably revised the second passage because the youth's similarity to the corpse had become too obvious. Then, too, it was more to his purpose to ally the corpse and the "tattered soldier", since the youth later abandons the tattered soldier to a certain death. Crane's initial description of the tattered soldier, which occurs within a few pages of the chapel scene, deliberately echoes his earlier description of the corpse: His lean features wore an expression of awe and admiration . . . He eyed the story-teller with unspeakable wonder. His mouth was agape in yokel fashion. The serjeant, taking note of this, . . . administered a sardonic comment, 'Be keerful, honey, you'll be a-ketchin' flies,' he said. The most significant revision Crane made in his second draft was the change from specific to anonymous characters. In state I there are four characters who are identified by name: Henry Fleming, Jim Conklin, Wilson, and Simpson. These were all changed in states II and III to "the youth", "the tall soldier", "the loud soldier", and "a corporal". The proper names were allowed to remain only when they were spoken by other characters. In state I everyone calls the hero either "Flem" or "Flemin'". Crane changed these forms to "Henry" and "Fleming" only once in the manuscript, yet the change appeared consistently throughout the 1895 edition. There are many unchanged names in the manuscript that were "silently" corrected when published, but Winterich's assertion that Crane made name changes only on a few pages and left the rest up to a typist (Folio, 23) is inaccurate—and unfair to Crane, who was a reasonably industrious reviser. In the entire manuscript there are actually only a few pages that bear no sign at all of name revision. As the rest of the manuscript attests, Crane's hand was directly responsible for at least 80 per cent of the several hundred name changes that appeared in the first edition. Some of the changes he made raise interesting critical questions. Why, for instance, was he so careful to make his hero the only "youth" in the book? In state I of the second draft, "Fleming" was "a youthful private" who listened to the debates of Jim Conklin and "young Wilson", and marveled at the profane powers of "the youthful lieutenant" of his company. In state II "Fleming" became "the youth" and Wilson temporarily became "the blatant young soldier" or "the loud young soldier". Crane had decided to isolate his young hero by the time revision in II reached chapter Five, for he changed "the youthful lieutenant" there to "the lieutenant". He skipped over that crucial block of chapters, Thirteen through Eighteen, and continued revising in II. He canceled "youthful"—the lieutenant's familiar epithet—throughout chapter Nineteen, but was less consistent in the following two chapters. In Twenty he canceled "youthful" twice but neglected to change it three other times, and in Twenty-one he did not alter its single appearance. Somehow these four unchanged "youthful lieutenants" reached the 1895 text, despite their obvious inconsistency with Crane's recorded intentions. In the remaining chapters Crane was careful to remove all suggestions of youth from the lieutenant. When he began final revision in III he went back to the early chapters (One through Four) and made similar changes on Wilson, who went from "the blatant young soldier" and "the loud young soldier" to "the blatant soldier" and "the loud soldier". Moving then to the unrevised chapters, Crane changed a few more of the "loud young soldier" epithets. Although he canceled several "youngs" in chapter Thirteen, he left a few in the text, perhaps in preparation for the ironic contrast that he was developing between Fleming and Wilson. A single revision in chapter Fourteen may explain his deliberate effort to make Fleming the book's only "youth": The youth took note of a remarkable change in his comrade since those days of camp life upon the river bank . . . . He was, no more, a loud young soldier . (III) . . . a youth. (I) On the battle-field that is the world of The Red Badge , a man's character is measured by his ability to profit from experience. Wilson moves toward a maturity that Fleming will never grasp, and Crane chose to indicate his hero's pathetic inadequacy by labeling him the only "youth" in a company of men. After Fleming's recognition of Wilson's accomplishment, Crane bestowed upon the latter a distinctive new title: "the youth's friend" or "comrade"—never again was he to be known as "loud" or "young". In chapters Fifteen through Eighteen, Crane made the isolation of Fleming complete by canceling "young" or "youthful" in III wherever they were used to describe the lieutenant. The most puzzling revision Crane made in his second draft was an added change of dialect in the early chapters. When he first wrote The Red Badge , Crane tried to imitate in his characters' speech the contemporary rural dialects he had heard in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. 6 In state I of the second draft all of his characters, including Fleming and Wilson, spoke this curiously-spelled English. In the early stage of revision II, Crane maintained the uniformity, but in chapter Nine he decided to normalize Fleming's dialect. He probably did so because he wanted to emphasize, either for purposes of irony or verisimilitude, Fleming's educational background. Interestingly enough, he had decided only four chapters earlier to make Fleming the book's only "youth". Throughout the rest of state II, Crane seems to have changed only the dialect of Fleming and Wilson, possibly because he hoped to suggest contrasts within the characters' external similarity. When he returned to the early chapters with a black pencil (III), he brought the dialect of Fleming and Wilson into conformity with the normalized standard of the other chapters, but for some reason he also decided to revise the dialect of Fleming's mother, Conklin, and the lieutenant. This revision was quite inconsistent with the preceding state (II), but Crane may have envisioned making such changes throughout the entire manuscript. He did not proceed beyond chapter Three, however, for in chapter Nine Conklin's dialect was left untouched—despite the fact that his symbolic role was at its height there. While the lieutenant's dialect was altered by III in chapter Three, it was left unchanged in chapter Seventeen (where Crane revised only in III) and for all of his later appearances. The dialect changes Crane made for the additional characters were far from consistent, as the following passage from the 1895 text indicates: ' You watch out Henry, an ' take good care of yer self in this here fight ing business. You watch out, an ' take good care of yer self. Don't go a-think- in ' you can lick the hull rebel army at the start, because yeh can't. Yer jest one little feller amongst a hull lot of others, and yeh 've got to keep quiet an ' do what they tell yeh. I know how you are , Henry.' (1895, p. 8) The later changes made by Crane and another hand (IV and V) in the manuscript also require critical analysis, because they are related to some of the omissions and corrections that appeared in the 1895 text. As a whole, the later blue-pencil cancellations (IV) seem to be consistent with other changes that Crane made in III. In state I of the second draft, he had written several interior monologues for Fleming which he later canceled in III. He probably made these cuts because he realized that the novel's themes could be presented more dramatically in action rather than exposition. He must have realized also that the high bombast and "philosophical" pretension of the monologues were inappropriate for his young hero. The cancellations made Henry seem more probable because his thoughts became compatible with his age and education. Most of these passages appeared at the ends of chapters. If they covered more than one page, Crane would cancel the portion that appeared on the first page and simply remove the second. He did this at the end of chapters Seven, Ten, and Fourteen. Chapter Twelve was so impossibly grandiose that he decided to drop it completely. 7 Of the three chapters that dwell on Fleming's "dark night of the soul" (Ten through Twelve), Crane left only Eleven unrevised to carry the burden of the soldier's lofty introspection. Because the blue pencil canceled only those passages that Crane had already canceled in III, there seems to be no contradiction between the two states. The final manuscript state (V) deals only with a few of the text's accidentals; therefore its relation to critical problems is of lesser importance. The identity of this non-authorial hand is extremely doubtful; it may be that of an Appleton editor, a typist, or some other contemporary of Crane's. The markings consist of penciled marginal question marks, grammatical corrections, and a few insertions that Crane later re-traced in ink. The latter markings may indicate that someone read parts of the manuscript before Crane had completed its revision. The question of a critical edition of The Red Badge of Courage hangs upon its editors' choice of a copy-text. Every text since 1895, including the Winterich and Stallman "manuscript editions", has been based on the Appleton first edition as a copy-text. 8 Winterich and Stallman add to their editions a few manuscript passages that are missing from the copy-text, but they do not attempt a full-scale collation of the manuscript. Winterich briefly notes the existence of a first draft, but he prints none of its significant variants. Stallman reproduces some canceled passages from the first and second draft in footnotes, and he corrects a few—very few—of his copy-text's errors by inserting readings from the second draft. In instances of conflict between the second draft and the 1895, and even when both versions are obviously incorrect, the two editors usually prefer to reproduce their copy-text. They follow this practice because they assume that the 1895 represents Crane's final intentions. Any argument for a new copy-text of The Red Badge needs to be prefaced by a brief history of the documents that reportedly stand between the second draft and first edition: a typescript, a condensed newspaper version, a printer's typesetting copy, and a set of page proofs. The testimony in this matter is scanty and usually contradictory. The major sources are in reminiscences by Hamlin Garland and Irving Bacheller, the Beer and Berryman biographies, Stallman's somewhat disjointed survey in his Omnibus (201-217), and the volume of Crane's collected letters. 9 In the early months of 1894, Irving Bacheller, later of the Bacheller-Johnson newspaper syndicate, read the second draft and advised Crane to have a typescript made (Bacheller, p. 276). Hamlin Garland reports that Crane visited him with one-half of a typescript. When Garland asked about the other half, Crane said that it was in pawn with a typist for $15. Garland lent the money, and Crane returned shortly with the typed second half (Garland, p. 501). He then took the first half, which Garland had finished reading, to the editors of McClure's Magazine , who allegedly accepted the book—for serial publication—on the condition that the later chapters met with their approval. Crane's finances must have been abysmally low at this time, for he was borrowing from any available source—without any particular scruples about obtaining money under false pretenses. He wrote to a friend named "Dicon" (John Henry Dick) and asked him to . . . beg, borrow, or steal fifteen dollars. [McClure's] like the Red Badge and want to make a contract for it. It is in pawn at the typewriter's for fifteen. ( Letters , p. 30) Shortly after April 22, Crane borrowed another $15 from Garland ( Letters , p. 36), presumably to repay Dicon; but according to one of Dicon's associates, the trusting friend was never repaid ( Letters , p. 30n). Years later, writing from England to his brother William, Crane recalled: I believe the sum I usually borrowed was fifteen dollars, wasn't it? Fifteen dollars—fifteen dollars—fifteen dollars. I can remember an interminable row of fifteen dollar requests. ( Letters , p. 148) On February 24, 1894, Crane wrote to a friend that he had sold the book, that "the syndicate people" thought "several papers could use it", and that his New York friends thought "that some publisher ought to bring it out when [i.e., after ] it has been shown as a serial" ( Letters , p. 41). Beer and Stallman both interpret "the syndicate people" to be Bacheller-Johnson, but that syndicate (as Stallman notes) was not formed until late in 1894 ( Omnibus , p. 604). Although "it was in the planning stage much earlier", it seems hardly probable that Bacheller would buy a novel for serialization nine months prior to the actual formation of a syndicate. Furthermore, Crane does not indicate in his letter that he had sold to the syndicate, but that the syndicate had thought "several papers could use it". It would seem, then, that the typescript had been "sold" to McClure's , and that Crane had received some advice from Bacheller on possible newspaper publication. Stallman silently shifts to this position in Letters because of evidence that McClure's held the typescript for over six months ( Letters , p. 30). Whether or not McClure's ever actually paid for the novel is uncertain. Berryman conjectures, plausibly enough, that McClure's was enthusiastic, but that Crane's talk of a "sale" was merely a flight of optimism. No one had really bought The Red Badge , and no one would for several months (Berryman, p. 80). McClure's never published the book, and probably even lost that oft-pawned typescript, for it was not returned to Crane. After nine months of waiting in vain for McClure's to publish his book, a disgusted Crane took the second-draft manuscript to the newly-formed Bacheller-Johnson syndicate. In a letter written to Crane's wife, Bacheller says that he was given "a bulky manuscript" ( Letters , p. 298), and in a later recollection he says that it was "a rather worn and dirty manuscript" (Letters, p. 322). Crane was paid $90 for the novel. "They use it in January in a shortened form", he wrote to Garland on November 15, 1894 ( Letters , p. 41). It appeared sooner than he had expected, however: first in the Philadelphia Press , December 3-8; then in the New York Press on December 9. According to Stallman, this shortened version (abridged from 55,000 to 18,000 words) of the second draft appeared in "several other newspapers which have not been identified" ( Omnibus , p. 604; Letters , p. 41). Berryman estimates that this version appeared "in 200 small city dailies, 250 weekly papers, and as patent insides in some 300-350 more" (Berryman, p. 94n.). On December 18, Crane mailed the clippings of the newspaper version to Ripley Hitchcock, an editor at Appleton and Company ( Letters , p. 46). 10 In January of 1895 Bacheller sent Crane on a Western reporting trip. Before Crane left he gave the second-draft manuscript to Hitchcock. On the 30th, he wrote the editor from St. Louis, asking for an opinion on the novel, and citing some of the favorable reviews that the newspaper version had received ( Letters , p. 49). Hitchcock decided to buy the book, and on February 12 Crane wrote from Lincoln, Nebraska, to accept his terms. He was going on to New Orleans shortly, and suggested that the manuscript "could be corrected there by me in short order" ( Letters , p. 51). Hitchcock sent the manuscript by express to New Orleans on February 25 ( Letters , p. 52). Crane revised quickly but thoroughly; on March 8 he wrote Hitchcock from Galveston, Texas, to say that he had sent the manuscript back before leaving New Orleans ( Letters , p. 53). Stallman once speculated that the manuscript Crane sent to Hitchcock was "probably the typescript copy or page proof, rather than the actual hand-written manuscript" ( Omnibus , p. 645n.). Yet the fact that Crane took the manuscript to Bacheller in November, and submitted newspaper clippings to Hitchcock in December, is good evidence for assuming that the typescript no longer existed and had probably been lost at McClure's . When Hitchcock expressed some interest in the novel after reading the newspaper version, Crane got the manuscript back from Bacheller and gave it to the Appleton editor just before he left New York in January. As for whether page proof or the manuscript was sent to New Orleans, Hitchcock himself says that publication of the book was held off until Crane had returned to New York to correct the proofs (Hitchcock, p. vi). It seems hardly probable that Hitchcock would have had proofs made before major authorial revision, for this procedure would have been expensive and impractical. In all probability, he sent the second-draft manuscript to New Orleans, not proofs. In a later account, Stallman abandons his conjectural typescript and adopts this position ( Letters , pp. 45, 51, 53). Hitchcock says that the 1895 edition was printed after corrected proof sheets, but he does not explain what document was used by the printer as a copy for the typesetting. Winterich and Stallman both assume that the typescript was used (Folio, p. 23; Omnibus , p. 216), but the typescript seems to have disappeared at the McClure's office, since Crane never submitted it to any other publishers. Winterich rejects any proposal that the manuscript was used, on the grounds that: . . . it lacks the honourable stigmata that would otherwise have embellished it—the smudged thumb-prints, the pencilled directions, the marked points of division and stoppage, to say nothing of the corrected spellings. (Folio, p. 23) Yet this objection has little factual basis, since these markings do appear—infrequently—on the manuscript's pages. A printer would scarcely have taken time to stop and record all of his changes on the copy. Furthermore, the 1895 edition reproduced a number of literal errors from the manuscript. Crane returned from the West in late May. After a few weeks rest at Port Jervis, he went to New York and began correcting the proofs that had been set from his revised manuscript. Hitchcock's testimony is the only evidence that Crane saw the proofs, but it is obvious that he was in New York through June and July from the return address on his letters, "The Lantern Club", 165 West 23rd Street. If Crane did read proof, he was amazingly docile—or perhaps just hasty—about the obligation. All of the non-authorial revision that was added to the manuscript (presumably after state IV and before the proofs) and in the typesetting (generally in the form of accidental variants) survived in the 1895 text, despite its inconsistency with Crane's intentions and habits. 11 By late July the job had been completed, and in August Crane left New York for a favorite camping spot in Pike County, Pennsylvania. Hitchcock sent the title-page proof to him there, and Crane sent back his approval on August 26 ( Letters , p. 62). A copyright application was filed on September 27, 1895, and a deposit made in the Library of Congress on the following day. Publication of The Red Badge of Courage was announced in The Publisher's Weekly on October 5, 1895. 12 Without the proof sheets, which carried Crane's last revisions, Winterich believes that ". . . it would be as presumptuous as futile to attempt anything like a variorum edition of the text" (Folio, p. 23). Yet a critical text is a definite possibility, since a thorough collation of both drafts and the 1895 edition would provide a complete history of the novel's revision. This evidence might, in turn, enable an editor to distinguish between authorial and non-authorial variants in the 1895. The first edition contains variants that are, on the basis of the second draft as copy-text, obviously non-authorial. There are perhaps hundreds of incorrect 1895 substantives that can be emended by merely substituting the manuscript reading. A few of the more interesting variants are given below: The level sheets of flame developed great clouds of smoke that tumbled and tossed in the mild wind near the ground for a moment, and then rolled through the ranks as through a gate . (1895, p. 66f.) . . . grate. (2nd-I) . . . his eyes had the expression of those of a criminal who thinks his guilt and his punishment great . . . (1895, p. 77) . . . his guilt little and his punishment great . . . (2nd-I) After a time he began to sidle near to the youth, and in a different way try to make him a friend. (1895, p. 88) . . . in a diffident way . . . (2nd-I) In the fog-filled air their voices made a thudding sound. The reverberations were continued . (1895, p. 154) . . . continual. (2nd-I) This noise, following like the yellings of eager, metallic hounds . . . (1895, p. 159) . . . yelpings . . . (2nd-I) The winds of battle had swept all about the regiment, until the one rifle, instantly followed by others , flashed in its front, (1895, p. 165) . . . brothers . . . (2nd-I) These 1895 variants may have come either from printer's errors that Crane did not catch in proof, or from changes made in proof after Crane's corrections. There are also substantive omissions in the 1895 text that seem to be authorial, since they indicate consistent "literary" revision. These silent omissions from the manuscript probably represent Crane's final revision on the lost proof sheets, for they eliminate nothing from the text that needs to be preserved. Winterich and Stallman have both felt that this omitted material should be bracketed and placed in the text; as a result they include dialogue which is clearly irrelevant or redundant, and expository passages which are either similar to or refer directly to the interior monologues that Crane cut out of the manuscript. 13 If the manuscript in its final authorial state (2nd-III) were taken as a copy-text, the editor could emend all of the 1895 corruptions without denying the authority of the 1895 omissions. 1 Stephen Crane : Letters , ed. R. W. Stallman and Lillian Gilkes (1960), p. 107: hereafter cited as Letters . 2 On the backs of 57 leaves there are portions of an earlier draft. R. W. Stallman (see note 3) refers to the two drafts as SV (Short Version) and LV (Long Version); they will be cited here simply as the first and second draft. In two separate accounts, Stallman reports that there are 56 and 58 first-draft leaves. 3 Stephen Crane, The Red Badge of Courage , ed. John Winterich for The Folio Society (1950): hereafter cited as Folio. Stephen Crane, The Red Badge of Courage , in Stephen Crane: An Omnibus , ed. R. W. Stallman (1952): hereafter cited as Omnibus. 4 There is a distinct possibility that pages 137 and 193 are not sheets of paper A, since the blue line in their vertical rule is darker than the rule in all other A sheets. Whereas the versos of paper A are all clean, except for a few false starts which Crane inverted, the verso of 137 is page 3 of an unpublished short story. Page 193, the manuscript's last page, contains the novel's "second" ending. Its verso is clean, and like 137 it is identical in every way with A except for the dark blue line. 5 Neither of the editors who examined the Red Badge manuscript has noted the textual significance of this physical evidence. Winterich does not acknowledge the existence of different writing states, but he does discuss some of Crane's more obvious revision. Stallman mentions only four of the states, and he does not distinguish between authorial and non-authorial changes. Evidently he was unable to recognize the different states from his photostatic copies, for he assumes that Crane alone was responsible for all notations appearing in the manuscript. 6 John Berryman, Stephen Crane (1950), p. 79. 7 Stallman has assembled five pages of chapter Twelve since 1952. In the "Textual Notes" to his Signet Classic edition (1960), pp. 207ff., he labels them "Houghton 98", "Berg 98", "Columbia 99", "Columbia 101", and "Houghton 102". Chapter Twelve was written on six pages of paper B, and it bears the revision of states I and II. I am indebted for this information to Mr. William H. Bond, Curator of Manuscripts, Houghton Library; Mr. John D. Gordan, Curator of the Berg Collection, New York Public Library; and Mr. Roland Baughman, Head of Special Collections, Butler Library, Columbia University. 8 Four editions since 1952 have reprinted the unpublished passages which first appeared in the Winterich and Stallman editions; but their copy-text has remained the 1895 edition.

He rarely used exclamation marks, for instance, but the Appleton printer inserted hundreds —thereby destroying the dramatic effect of a rare outburst in the midst of ironic understatement. Crane's grammar was criticized in his own time (see Berryman, pp. 141-142), but readers today may think that his punctuation is actually modern: he keeps the page "clean" and the prose free from distracting symbols. 12 Ames W. Williams and Vincent Starret, Stephen Crane: A Bibliography (1948), p. 18. 13 Two of the recent editions (Lettis, et. al.; Bradley, et. al.) have adopted the sensible practice of printing all unpublished passages in an appendix. There are critical advantages to Winterich's and Stallman's practice, of course. The superfluity of these passages becomes all the more obvious when they are seen in context.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The First Edition of Ficino's De Christiana Religione : A Problem in Bibliographical Description. by Curt F. Bühler 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first edition of the De christiana religione by Marsilius Ficinus 2 was produced at Florence, some time within the month following 10 November 1476, by Nicolaus Laurentii, 3 a German printer who had emigrated to Italy from his native diocese of Breslau. The book itself is an unsigned quarto, and the collation given in the British Museum's monumental incunabula catalogue reads: [a b 10 c-f 8 g 6+1 h-p 8 q 10 * 2 ]. A manuscript entry in the Museum's own "working copy" of this catalogue 4 notes that "[g]1 was occupied by the same text as [g]2 in a different setting-up &amp; was cancelled. The Phillipps copy (Sotheby sale cat. 25 Nov. 1946 no. 122) contained both leaves. Sold to Harvard Univ. Lib." Accordingly, it would seem proper to emend the collation of this copy so that the seventh quire would be described as [g] 8-1 .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A thorough consideration of the problem presented by this irregular quire poses such questions as to WHY the duplication of text came into being, WHAT would be the true make-up of an ideal copy of this printing, and HOW should the seventh quire be properly listed?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Turning, then, to the redundant text, a close comparison of the two settings shows that for fifty lines the two agree, line for line; 5 the only difference between the two occurs in lines 5-6 of the verso, where [g]1 divides "criſti∥ana" and [g]2 has "chriſtia∥na." Such agreement can hardly be accidental! 6 Of even greater significance, at least in the opinion of the writer, is the fact that both settings offer the identical misprints or errors: in line 4 (recto), both copies have "ſactio" where "ſanctio" is required; in line 12, "elegi" for "elegit"; in line 12 (verso), "denu(m)ptiat" for "denunciat"; and in line 14, both read "permictit" where "permittit" is wanted. 7 Of course, the archetype itself might have been corrupt at these several places—but it seems strange that no emendation was attempted for these rather obvious mistakes by the compositor of either setting. Then, too, neither setting is any real improvement on the other; on the verso, setting [g]1 has the slip "exrahi" for the "extrahi" on [g]2, while [g]2 incorrectly has "ſeruari" where "ſeruare" is preferable. 8 In any event, minor corrections of this sort could have been made in the forme without the necessity of resetting two entire pages of type. Significantly enough, the two rectos display only orthographic variations, 9 so that it cannot very well be argued that the printer reset the type in order to correct his text and then, by some mishap, used both settings in the printing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before analyzing our chief problem, it would be best to examine briefly Laurentii's printing practices at this time, which marked the very outset of his career as an independent printer. 10 His two earliest productions appear to be the work under discussion and an Italian version of this same text (HCR 7071; Stillwell Census F135), both being quartos. The evidence of the watermarks suggests that these books were printed by half-sheet imposition, for in some five quires of two copies, 11 watermarks are found in six of the eight leaves. Again, it is clear that Laurentii possessed at least two presses; the BMC (VI:625), for example, remarks that, in the Italian version, "a miscalculation of the length of ch. 28 has resulted in the greater part of 81 b and the whole of 82 (end of quire [k]) being left blank. Possibly the book was set up on three presses, ending with quires [e], [k] and [o] respectively." That quire [l] was probably printed before [k] seems reasonable enough, and two presses may, therefore, be postulated. However, a third press could hardly have started with quire [f], since this begins in the middle of the word "[absti]nentia." Finally, it seems certain that Laurentii was not printing from cast-off copy but that he was setting type seriatim by pages. Of the 27 quires in the two volumes which come into consideration, 10 begin in the middle of a sentence and 16 in the middle of a word. 12 Since he was following this practice (in effect, printing as in folio), it is likely that he was working "from inside out"; that is, in the order: [g]4-[g]5, [g]3-[g]6, [g]2-[g]7, and [g]1-[g]8</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Only one explanation for the redundant text—and not a very good one at that—has occurred to the writer. For the printing of the two innermost sheets, there was, of course, no problem, but either with the third or with the outermost one, Laurentii may well have suddenly discovered that, by some miscalculation, he did not have enough pages to fill out the formes. Clearly, there was some excellent reason for his not being able to use two pages from the next quire as type-high supports—and one may consequently assume that quire [h] was then either printing or had already been printed off. Thus, one may again assume that Laurentii was working with at least two presses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now if the printer did not realize that he was short of type-pages till he was machining [g]2-[g]7, then it is self-evident that [g]2 must be the earlier setting. For some reason not clear to us, Laurentii apparently had no standing type [or blocks, furniture or quads] to make up the two pages necessary to fill the formes. His compositor was, therefore, obliged to supply him with two duplicate pages, which he set up quickly from the already printed copy. If, however, Laurentii was working with more than one press, he might have been machining the two sheets simultaneously, in which case it would be impossible to determine whether [g]1 or [g]2 was set first.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The purpose of these two reset pages was, of course, to act as "bearers" which were probably never meant to be inked but simply to serve as a support during the printing. Normally, they would have provided a blank leaf, subsequently to be cut out. Here, however, they were inked and printed, and thus escaped excision. 13 Examples of accidental inking and printing of "bearer" type, and the consequent survival of such, are not unknown in the incunabula period. 14 In any case, one cannot assert with any degree of certainty which pages were set first or which leaf was supposed to have been excised. 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For the descriptive bibliographer, of course, the perplexing problem is what will here constitute an "ideal copy" and what index number shall be given to the seventh quire. According to Professor Fredson Bowers 16 (and all will agree with him on this), "an ideal copy is not a redundant copy." With this in mind, one may well argue that [g] 8 would not be, in the least, acceptable. Equally, any bibliographer of the Greg-Bowers school would argue that an "index figure should represent the number of conjugate quired leaves in the original gathering, with all abnormalities accounted for by other means." 17 An uneven index-number is repugnant to this school of bibliography, 18 and for very excellent reasons too, since a sheet could not very well be machined with an odd number of leaves. Therefore [g] 7 , too, is inadmissible. One could, of course, write [g] 8 (-g1) if one were positive that the publisher wished the first leaf to be cut out, or [g] 8 (-g2) if it were the second which Laurentii might have wished to suppress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since the ideal copy is that which represents the "most perfect state of the book as the printer or publisher finally intended to issue it," 19 one turns to the surviving copies to see if a clue as to what Laurentii's intention was might be discovered there. The make-up of the seventh quire in the sixteen copies known to the writer provides the following information: Four copies have only [g]1: Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale [A.7.8] Oxford, Bodleian Library [Auct. 1 Q 5.59] San Marino, Huntington Library [Mead 3578 and 3579] 20 Four copies have only [g]2: Bryn Mawr, Bryn Mawr College Library [Goodhart, p. 59] 21 Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale [D.7.6.6] London, British Museum [IA. 27111] Venice, Biblioteca Marciana [Incun. 903] Eight copies have both: Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Library Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale [B.5.18] Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana Naples, Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III [S.Q.V.C.9] New York, Curt F. Bühler Oxford, Bodleian Library [Auct. 1 Q inf. 1. 7] Rome, Biblioteca Corsiniana Rome, Biblioteca Vaticana [Stamp. Ross. 1026]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What can be deduced from this? Perhaps the not unreasonable assumption that Laurentii may have been quite indifferent to [possibly even ignorant of] the true state of affairs. It is certainly unclear whether such excisions as there are were made in the shop or by the individual purchasers. That one or the other leaf should have been deleted is quite self-evident, but this does not get us very far. One may still wonder (1) whether the publisher [as distinct from the press-man or compositor] was aware of the repetition, (2) whether, being aware of it, he had any interest in what the purchaser did about it, or (3) whether he himself cut out one or the other of the offending leaves in those copies still unsold when he discovered the duplication, without caring very much which of the leaves he removed. In view of such uncertainties as these, how can the ideal copy be identified and what should be the index number of the seventh quire?</field>

Olschki, Enrico Rostagno ("Di un esemplare del De christiana Religione di Marsilio Ficino," La Bibliofilia , II [1900/01], 399) was aware of the repetition in the seventh quire but offered no explanation for the presence of the repeated text. 5 If the text had twice been set from the manuscript quite independently, then there surely would have been some differences in the line-endings through the differing use of contractions. 6 Proper names are either capitalized or not in identical fashion in both settings, and both have identical major contractions at the same places. The chapter-heading on the verso is entirely in capitals in both settings, whereas elsewhere (save for that of chapter 18 on [e]2) the headings are in upper and lower case. All this could scarcely be the result of simple coincidence. 7 I have consulted the Columbia University Library copies of the editions of Venice, 1518 (878 F44 P5); Basel, 1561 (B 878 F44 I); and Basel, 1576 (facsimile reprint, Torino, 1959—878 F44 I3). The text of the Venice: Otinus de Luna, 1500, edition has been made available through photostats of the copy in the Walters Art Gallery ( Census F134). All these copies have sanctio, elegit, denunciat and permittit . 8 The four later editions all have servare . 9 In line 20, recto, of [g]2, a turned "n" provides the misprint "uudecies," this being the only major difference between the two texts. 10 That Laurentii was still quite inexperienced at his trade is shown by the fact that, in these books, he made no use of signatures or register, foliation or pagination, title-page and colophon, running-heads, etc. 11 The Morgan copy (Accession number 397) of Census F135 and the writer's example of Census F133. 12 Only one quire—the second one in the Latin version—begins with a new sentence. 13 In my article "Caxton Studies" ( Gutenberg Jahrbuch , 1940, pp. 169-176), I set forth reasons for suggesting that Caxton, for his smaller folios, might have been able to print two pages with but one pull of the lever—and that thereby bearer-type might have received ink by mistake. Similarly, Laurentii could certainly have printed two quarto pages with a single pull—and a careless press-man might have inked the type where he should not have done so. [Unfortunately, due to the outbreak of war and the consequent break in communications, the figures which were meant to illustrate the points I was seeking to make were never printed with the Caxton article. For the same reasons, I was unable to read proof and a few gross misprints have crept into the printed text.] 14 Compare also my articles: "A Note on a Fifteenth-Century Printing Technique," The Library Chronicle , XV (1949), 52-55 and "A Misprinted Page in a Fifteenth-Century Book," ibid. , XXI (1955), 3-5. 15 If he were printing page by page (a most unlikely circumstance at this late date), why would he have reprinted on his second leaf the texts which he had just printed on the first one? 16 Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949), p. 115. 17 Bowers, p. 227. 18 Compare Bowers, p. 488 ff. 19 Bowers, p. 113. 20 Herman R.

      <field name="fulltext">The printer and the date of the fourth quarto of Romeo and Juliet (n.d.), STC 22325, "Printed for Iohn Smethwicke ," have so far eluded investigators, but identification of the tailpiece on L4 and analysis of its progressive deterioration have supplied both. The printer was William Stansby, a favorite printer of Smethwick's; he used the tailpiece in many of his quartos and folios in the first decades of the seventeenth century. The breaks which progressively occur in the ornament make it reasonably definite that the quarto was printed in 1622.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The first four breaks and the smudge provide cumulative evidence of deterioration; the last two breaks bracket Romeo and Juliet ( STC 22325). The six copies of Q4 Romeo and Juliet 2 I have examined exhibit the first four breaks and the smudge. The sixth break does not occur in STC 22634 (1621) or STC 13717 (1622), but it does occur in four copies of Romeo and Juliet (DFo, CtYEC, CSmH [2 cops.]). Romeo and Juliet Q4 was probably printed therefore after STC 13717 in 1622. At break #7, all six copies of Romeo and Juliet exhibit the left ribbon on the left pendant clearly unbroken; copies of STC 7151 (= 7143, pt. 2), printed in 1622, show the ribbon clearly broken. 3 This item, John Downame, A Treatise of Securitie , was entered in the Stationers' Register on November 1, 1622 (Arber, IV.84); it thus reveals the tailpiece late in the year. Romeo and Juliet Q4 must therefore have been printed before November 1622.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Bent Juel-Jensen, noting the omission of the date in Stansby's edition of Drayton's Poems ( STC 7219), suggests that the omission was deliberate and not accidental. He observes that this octavo edition of the Poems was undated probably because "the folio edition [of 1619] was already being planned, and the octavo might sell less well once that was published, and the absence of a date would be an advantage." 4 The imminence of the Shakespeare First Folio 5 would explain the desire to present a quarto of Romeo and Juliet which would not soon become dated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The tailpiece appears on these signatures: 3143 (B4,S2 v ), 3144 (A4,K2,Cc3), 3150 (Ee7 v ), 4496 (A5 v ), 7151 (A4), 13717 (Xx1 v , Fff4 v , Ggg5 v , Hhh6, Iii3,8), 22214 (d6,E2 v ), 22325 (L4), 22634 (¶¶4,6 v , C3 v , 5,E6,G4 v ,L3 v ,T3 v ), 22772 (B2 v ).

It appears unbroken on Ii6 of volume I of the same work. It follows that the preliminaries of this massive compilation were printed in 1625 (as they acknowledge), but that the first volume was sent to press shortly after the entry in the Stationers' Register on Dec. 11, 1621, and was being printed in 1622 concurrently with Romeo and Juliet . 4 Works of Drayton (Rev. ed., London, 1961), V, 288. On the basis of break #2, STC 7219 is certainly in or after 1617; on the basis of no break on the inner curl of the topmost frond at the extreme left, it is before or in 1618. 5 Charlton Hinman dates the beginning of composition on the Folio at February 1622; Romeo and Juliet was composed in the Folio in the late spring of 1623 ( The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare [Oxford, 1963], I, 363-365; II, 513-529).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of A King and No King Q1 by Robert K. Turner, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As an increasing number of Elizabethan play quartos are subjected to bibliographical analysis, it begins to appear that these books were more often than not composed by formes. Recent studies have described the bibliographical characteristics of books set by one or more compositors using this technique, and, more important, it has been shown how detailed information about such printing procedures can directly affect the way in which an editor will deal with the text preserved by the quarto. 1 It is in this context that I will discuss the printing of Beaumont and Fletcher's King and No King Q1, a matter that is of interest because the volume appears to have been set up not by formes but seriatim and because this fact has a bearing on editorial problems, one of which will be considered here. The copy of A King and No King was entered to Edward Blount on 7 August 1618; Q1 made its appearance in the following year, having been printed by John Beale for Thomas Walkley, the stationer who was about to undertake the publication of Philaster (1620), Thierry and Theodoret (1621), and Othello (1622), all, like A King and No King , plays from the repertory of the King's Men. 2 Walkley's dedication to Sir Henry Neville deserves to be quoted in full for the information it reveals about the copy from which Beale worked: 3 Worthy Sir, I present, or rather returne unto your view, that which formerly hath beene received from you, hereby effecting what you did desire: To commend the worke in my unlearned method, were rather to detract from it, then to give it any luster. It sufficeth it hath your Worships approbation and patronage, to the commendation of the Authors, and incouragement of their further labours: and thus wholy committing my selfe and it to your Worships dispose I rest, ever readie to doe you service, not onely in the like, but in what I may. Thomas Walkley. The conventionality of Walkley's language according to the dedication formulas is revealed not only by his phraseology but also by his reference to the authors' further labors: when he wrote these words Beaumont had been dead for at least two years. Yet it is clearly implied that Walkley had obtained a text of the play from Neville, and, as no business connection between Blount and Walkley is known, Greg was led to speculate that the entry in the Stationers' Register was made by Blount at the instigation of the King's Men to deny rights of publication to Walkley. 4 Presumably such blocking entries were a device by means of which the company through the agency of a cooperative stationer retained control of or an interest in a property of actual or potential value which was about to be printed, and it looks as though Walkley, who may at first have stolen a march on the actors by obtaining a text from a private person, would have had to reach terms with them, and perhaps also with Blount, before he could have published A King and No King . These circumstances suggest that the text which Neville gave to Walkley was a transcript of some kind, and the uniformity of act headings, speech prefix abbreviations, and other such details of Q1 accords with an assumption that a scribal copy underlay the printed text. As Q1 does not contain stage directions in the technical language of the theater or other indications of relationship with prompt copy but does contain a ghost character (Mandane, who is brought on by the stage direction introducing II.i, but who never speaks or is spoken to), it seems that the scribe probably worked from late-stage foul papers or from the authors' final draft. One problem which has troubled editors of A King and No King , and indeed of other Beaumont and Fletcher plays, has been the lineation of certain parts of the text. Beaumont and Fletcher often wrote fluid, idiomatic lines which are either metrical prose or irregular verse. The speech of Mardonius which begins III.iii will serve as an example. The quarto prose is reprinted here; the virgules indicate the lineation of R. Warwick Bond, one editor who decided to treat the passage as verse: 5 Ile move the King, hee is most strangely alter'd: / I guesse the cause I feare too right, Heaven has / some secret end in't and tis a scourge no question / justly laid upon him: Hee has followed mee / through twenty roomes, and ever when I stay / to await his command, he blushes like a girle, / and lookes upon me, as if modestie / kept in his business: so turnes away from me, / but if I goe on, hee followes me againe. / See, here he is, I doe not use this, yet / I know not how, I cannot chuse but weepe / to see him: his very enemies I thinke, / whose wounds have bred his fame, if they should see him now, / would find teares in their eyes. A decision as to the lineation of material such as this can be based neither on the nature of the character speaking nor on the tone of the scene in which it occurs, for in Beaumont and Fletcher verse-speaking characters sometimes lapse into what is obviously prose, and scenes in which prose predominates sometimes contain lines which seem obviously to be verse. In the scene from which this passage is drawn, Mardonius speaks lines which must be regarded as prose (e.g., Bond, III.iii. 97-111) as well as dubious verse. When the editor has no clear choice, his best course is to line doubtful matter as he thinks the playwrights themselves lined it, but because compositors and perhaps scribes sometimes altered lineation, the editor cannot take it for granted that the lineation of the copy-text corresponds with authorial lineation. To estimate the probable extent of the compositors' interference, the editor ought to know as much as possible about the printing of the copy-text, in the case of A King and No King , the printing of Q1. 6 The book collates A-L 4 M 2 ; leaf A1 is a blank, A2 is the title page, A2 v bears the dedication, and A3 carries the head title and the beginning of the play itself. The text, which ends on M2 v , is set in ordinary roman, with speech prefixes and stage directions in the usual italic. Thirty-eight lines of type to the page prevail, but on B3, Il, Il v , and L4 v thirty-nine are printed by the expedient of running a few words into the direction line. The pages are correctly numbered. In general, typographical details seem to have been carefully looked after; the appearance of the book is quite clean. An examination of the running titles ( A King and no King . on recto and verso) shows that both formes of Sheets B through F were machined in a single skeleton forme (I), but that at Sheet G a second skeleton (II) was introduced and used to impose the outer formes of Sheets G through L while Skeleton I imposed the inner. Sheet M was printed in Skeleton I by half-sheet imposition. Sheet A, which seems to have been machined late in the course of printing, perhaps last, uses two running titles from Skeleton I in its inner forme and one from Skeleton II in its outer. 7 If Sheet A was not printed in sequence, the copy which it contains must have been cast off, yet the rest of the book seems to have been set seriatim . Type from distributed formes of A King and No King Q1 normally reappears in both formes of the succeeding sheet; in a quarto set by formes, type from the first forme of each sheet normally reappears in both formes of the succeeding sheet, but type from the second forme only in the second forme of the succeeding sheet. 8 Evidence from type reappearances tallies well enough with evidence from type substitutions (VV or vv for W) 9 to permit the following indication of the order of the formes and the approximate times of their distribution. In a few instances the pattern of type substitutions suggests that the distribution took place a page or two in advance of the point indicated by type reappearances: Forme Distributed between Forme Distributed between Forme Distributed between B(i) C2-C2 v E(o) F4-F4 v I(i) K2 v -K3 B(o) C4 v -D1 F(i) G2 v -G3 I(o) K4 v -L1 (?) C(i) D3-D3 v F(o) G4 v -H1 K(i) L1 v -L2 C(o) D4 v -E1 G(i) H1 v -H2 K(o) L2 v -L3 D(i) E3-E3 v G(o) H4 v -I1 L(i) M1 v -M2 D(o) F1-F1 v H(i) I2 v -I3 L(o) no evidence E(i) F3-F3 v H(o) I4 v -K1 M no evidence 10 The fact that Sheets B through F were machined in one skeleton forme indicates that they were composed by one workman (Compositor A). He signed three of the four leaves in each gathering. At Sheet G, however, a second skeleton was introduced, and in Sheets H, I, K, L, and A all four leaves are signed. 11 It seems probable, therefore, that a second compositor (B), who apparently set type more quickly than A and thus could use another skeleton, entered at Sheet H, and, as type reappearances and substitutions show that he used the same cases from which earlier sheets had been set, he must have relieved Compositor A and not worked simultaneously with him. 12 The introduction of Skeleton II at Sheet G is probably related to the change of workmen; it may have been constructed by Compositor A after Compositor B began setting. The distribution of wrought-off formes within three or four pages after the distribution of preceding formes suggests that both compositors worked methodically and that no particular difficulties were encountered in setting up the text. The only thing that might give one pause is the extra line of type on the pages mentioned above, for such extra lines were sometimes made necessary by faults in the casting off for composition by formes. In this instance, however, these lines are all very short, and it appears that both workmen, simply to avoid wasting space or creating widows, occasionally set a few words in the direction line. We are now in a better position to consider the question of lineation that was raised earlier. If they had been setting by formes, the compositors may sometimes have lined verse as prose, just as they may sometimes have set extra lines in a type page, in order to adjust the actual space being consumed by text to the estimated space. But as they were setting seriatim , there would seem to be no very strong reason why they should deliberately misline Mardonius' speech, or any other for that matter. This is not to say that they may never have changed the lineation of their copy, but it is clear that they would have had no compelling mechanical reason for doing so. There is, then, a reasonably good chance that the compositors of A King and No King Q1 reproduced the lineation of the scribal transcript which was their copy. The scribe himself evidently wrestled from time to time with the lineation of the papers from which he worked, most notably in the scenes involving Bessus and the Swordmen (IV.iii and V.iii); but in the absence of evidence that he made changes, the lineation of the quarto should be followed when the editor is uncertain whether to print verse or prose.</field>

The printer, whose name does not appear in the imprint, is identified by means of ornaments used in the book. 3 This Sir Henry Neville (1588-1629), the son of an eminent Elizabethan courtier and diplomat of the same name, was at Lincoln's Inn in 1614 (Joseph Foster, Alumni Oxonienses , III [Early Series], 1058). C. M. Gayley suggests that the elder Sir Henry may have been the original owner of the manuscript to which Walkley apparently refers ( Francis Beaumont: Dramatist [1914], pp. 145-149.) 4 Shakespeare First Folio (1955), p. 154, n. 1. Greg points out that some ten years earlier Blount seems to have obliged the players in a similar fashion by entering Pericles and Antony and Cleopatra , neither of which was printed at the time. 5 In The Works of Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher (Variorum Edition: London, 1904), I, 301-302. 6 That Q1 must be the copy-text is shown by Berta Sturman, "The Second Quarto of A King and No King , 1625," Studies in Bibliography , IV (1951-52), 166-170. 7 See Appendix: Table I. 8 See Appendix: Table II. For a discussion of the pattern of type reappearances in a quarto set by formes, see my "Printing Methods and Textual Problems in A Midsummer Night's Dream Q1," Studies in Bibliography , XV (1962), 35-55. 9 See Appendix: Table III. The compositors seem often to have substituted when they had W's in the case, but they also tended to use W's rather than VV's or vv's just after a distribution was made. 10 In Sheet A I find no types from L(o) or M but the following from L(i): M L1 v ,25-A3 v ,13; h L2,16-A4,30; b L2,31-A3 v , 30; d L4,15-A3,15(?). I suppose, therefore, that Sheet A was composed after Sheet M and before the distribution of L(o) and M. 11 Sheet M has only two leaves, both signed. 12 Aside from the difference in signatures, I find no means to distinguish the work of the two compositors. Their spelling characteristics are very similar, and neither, as far as I can tell, had any preference in details of typography not shared by his fellow. From the editor's point of view, this likeness is probably all to the good, for it may mean that both men followed copy closely, thus producing a relatively unsophisticated print.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Date of the Separate Edition of Milton's "Epitaphium Damonis" by John T. Shawcross</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Recently Professor Harris F. Fletcher suggested that the separate, undated eight-page edition of "Epitaphium Damonis," Milton's elegy to Charles Diodati, the unique copy of which is in the British Museum, was published after the first edition of Milton's minor poems, which includes the elegy, in 1645. 1 His conclusion derives from comments in letters of 1647 and 1648, which may refer to the separate publication, and from a similarity of its type to type used by Matthew Simmons (a frequent printer of Milton's prose tracts), but not to that used by Ruth Raworth in the 1645 volume. Professor Fletcher's suggestion does not seem to be tenable not only because what evidence he adduces is uninstructive and indistinct, but because certain textual and compositorial matters show that the separate printing was a source for the text of 1645. 2 The undated and the 1645 texts of this elegy show many similarities of spelling, pointing, and capitalization, despite a number of differences. But for the most part similarities do not point out precedence: for example, the spelling "Deodatus" in the argument (but the regular "Diodatus" in line 210), or the odd "Hy-/lan" in line 1, or "facili" (rather than "facile") in line 145, or "Imus?" (where a question mark is unnecessary and not really correct) in line 148, or the paragraph at 198 (the only paragraph, other than the first, not beginning with the refrain; a passage of twenty-two lines, grammatically and subjectively a continuation of the previous paragraph, lines 179-197) 3 —none of these can be said to indicate the priority of one printing over the other. Such similarities, however, do imply a relationship between the two printings. On the other hand, one may note that the undated edition sometimes uses a vowel with a cedilla for a ligature, sometimes the ligature itself. This vowel with cedilla in the undated printing seems to account for the 1645 spelling "Letáque," line 216 (rather than "Lætáque"). Perhaps the printer of the undated copy meant to use the cedilla with "sepe," line 54 (for "sæpe"); regardless, 1645 has the same form, "sepe." Significantly, these are the only two occurrences in the poem in which 1645 prints "e" when the ligature is desirable. Although the 1645 printer usually set capital ligatures, two examples with distinct letters come through: "Aegon," line 70, and "Aegle," line 88. These are the forms of the undated edition, which never employs capital ligatures; hence the 1645 readings appear to be slips from following printed copy too exactly at these two places. Line 78 should probably show a strong terminal stop, but the undated text uses no punctuation and the 1645 printer seems to be trying to emend by using a comma. It is unlikely that the compositor of the undated text would not replace the comma by some point, if that were the order of editions, rather than just delete it. Helpful also are other frequent differences. Errors aside, would the printer of the undated text simply delete the colon after "carmen", line 3; the apostrophe after "mihi", line 19; the periods at the end of paragraphs in lines 34, 49, 67, 80, 160, 161, 178? (Milton's manuscripts frequently offer evidence of such omissions, suggesting that a text with such omissions is related to a manuscript. As example, let us take lines 165-193 of "Lycidas" in the Trinity MS. Necessary strong punctuation is not found in lines 171, 177, 181, 182, 185, 187, 189, 191, 192, 193, although there is a colon at the end of line 173.) Certainly the 1645 punctuation of lines 19 and 20 (a comma rather than a question mark, and a semicolon rather than an exclamation point) is preferable to that of the other text, which requires emendation. The long and regular "s" combination of "clarissimisque" in the undated argument would hardly replace the double long "s" of the 1645 argument. It would seem that noteworthy similarities and differences point to a close relationship between the two texts and to the priority of the undated printing, which is frequently altered in 1645 to improve certain readings. The question of the printer may also be raised, although the answer does not establish the publication date. The fonts of the texts of the undated elegy and the 1637 A Maske ("Comus"), excluding title pages, introductory material, etc., are the same, measuring two and three millimeters respectively for lower and upper case. The font is English, fourteen point. Some of the titling types of A Maske are those in the elegy, measuring five millimeters. Matrix characteristics such as the double cuspated "A" of "Ast" ( Epitaphium , 14), and of "And" ( A Maske , 870) in the text and the double cuspated "A" of "DAMONIS" (A1 r ) and "A MASKE" (A1 r ) in the titles establish the fonts as identical. This particular font regularly uses a question mark that looks battered; it appears five times in sig. B of A Maske , sixteen in sig. C, ten times in sig. D, and six times in sig. E, and thirteen times in Epitaphium . But it is interesting to note that the italic question mark of A Maske (see lines 237, 494, 512) appears, perhaps through foul case, four times in the elegy (lines 22, 147, 171, 200). The type used in the two poems is very well-worn. It seems to be identical, but distinct letters are few and difficult to discern because of poor presswork. The damaged "C" of "Cassibelauni," Epitaphium , 149, is found in "Comus," A Maske , direction between 658-659; the bent and battered "M" of "Musæ," Epitaphium , 13, was used for "My," A Maske , 2; and the broken "g" of "dignumque," Epitaphium , 24, was that of "gladly," A Maske , 413. It may be significant that the texts of both Epitaphium Damonis and A Maske use only capital "V," never capital "U." (1645 does use "U.") And perhaps most important is the similar row of type ornaments (national emblems) of the elegy (A1 v ) and the epistle to A Maske (A2 r ). This consists of various type ornaments (each ornament here designated by a letter) printed in a row; we can diagram these ornaments as ABCDEABCDFABCDE for the epistle and ABCDABCDABCDABCE for the elegy. That is, the epistle to A Maske is headed by five ornaments printed one after the other in a row three times except that what would have been the fifth ornament in the second grouping is a different (or sixth) ornament, probably as a result of foul case; and the elegy is headed by the identical first four ornaments printed one after the other in a row four times, except that what would have been the fourth ornament in the fourth grouping is the identical fifth ornament used in the A Maske row. If the printer of Epitaphium was the printer of A Maske , as seems likely, then he was Augustine Mathewes, as William R. Parker has shown. 4 Mathewes was still publishing in 1653, although he had run into difficulties as a result of the licensing act of 1637. The lack of colophon for Epitaphium may thus be due to Mathewes' particular situation as an unlicensed printer. The poem was probably written in October (or perhaps November) 1639. 5 Prior to this time the only printer whom Milton seems to have had direct contact with 6 was Mathewes, and then only a short while before. ( A Maske was apparently published in early 1638, despite the date 1637 on the title page, which must have been legal-year dating; 7 shortly afterward Milton started his tour of the continent, returning a few months before the elegy was written.) It is natural that he would have sought out his "recent" printer for this special and limited job. Had the epitaph been published between May 1641 and March 1645, we would expect the printer to have been one of the various men who produced his eleven prose works of that period. In this way only does the identification of printer suggest a publication date: the eight-page edition would probably have been produced by Mathewes before Milton had become acquainted with other printers in 1641 and probably soon after its composition. Therefore, the usual date of 1640(?) seems acceptable but not unquestionable, although 1639(?) has by the same reasoning much to offer as publication date.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Shirley's Coronation and Love Will Find out the Way : Erroneous Title-Pages. by T. J. King</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Studies relating to printing house practice have shown that compositors did not always distribute title-page type immediately after the printing of the forme in which this type was first used; sometimes all or part of the title-page was left standing for later use in the printing of advertisements or another issue of the work. Here we note how this practice may have contributed to errors in title-page inscriptions for two plays by James Shirley. 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">i Although Sir Henry Herbert records a Revels license for " The Coronation by James Shirley" on February 6, 1634/5, 2 the authorship of the play is not specified in the Stationers' Register entry of April 25, 1639: "M r Crooke w m Cooke Entred for their Copyes vnder the hands of M r Wykes &amp; M r Rothwell warden these five playes vdlt Night walters [ sic ], Opportunity. Loues Cruellty, The Coronation witt without money. ij s vj d ." 3 Moreover, the title-page of the 1640 quarto reads as follows: "THE / CORONATION / A COMEDY. / As it was presented by her / Majesties Servants at the private / House in Drury Lane. // Written by John Fletcher . Gent. // [ornament] // LONDON, / Printed by Tho. Cotes , for Andrew Crooke , and / William Cooke . and are to be sold at the signe / of the Greene Dragon , in Pauls / Church-yard . 1640." Allen H. Stevenson notes that The Night Walker and Wit without Money were written by Fletcher and suggests that the error on The Coronation title-page came about because "all five plays arrived in one package and the instructions concerning them were misunderstood." 4 This may be true, but it should also be noted that of the five plays listed in the Stationers' Register entry only Wit without Money was printed in 1639; the others were not printed until 1640. Furthermore, there seems to have been no misunderstanding when Cotes printed Love's Cruelty and The Opportunity , since the title-pages of both plays correctly credit Shirley. A possible source of the printer's error may be seen by comparing the title-page of The Coronation with that of The Night Walker : "THE / NIGHT- / VVALKER, / OR THE / LITTLE THEIFE. / A COMEDY, / As it was presented by her / Majesties Servants, at the Private / House in Drury Lane. // Written by John Fletcher . Gent. // [ornament] // LONDON, / Printed by Tho. Cotes , for Andrew Crooke , / and William Cooke . 1640." Collations of the title-pages of the Pierpont Morgan Library copies of the two plays, as well as those found in the Henry E. Huntington Library, reveal the following similarities and differences: (1) Four lines, "A COMEDY. / As it was presented by her / Majesties Servants at the private / House in Drury Lane." appear to have been printed from the same setting of type. Minor differences should be noted, however. The Coronation title-page carries a period after "COMEDY", whereas The Night Walker has a comma in the comparable position. The Night Walker has a comma after "Servants" and an upper case "P" for "Private", whereas The Coronation omits this comma and uses a lower case "p". (2) Both pages carry three two-part rules. The top rules are identical in both printings; the lower two rules appear to have been turned end to end and are set at differing vertical intervals from the top rule and from each other. (3) The author designations appear to have been printed from the same setting of type, but the ornaments are not the same and the imprints are from different settings. These similarities indicate that at least five lines of type and three rules were left standing after one of the plays was printed; with minor changes these elements were used again in the printing of the second work. There is no evidence to establish the order in which the plays were printed; nevertheless, it is possible that the use of type left standing after the printing of The Night Walker may have led to the erroneous designation of author on the title-page of The Coronation .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ii There is no record of a Revels license for Shirley's The Constant Maid . The Stationers' Register entry of April 28, 1640 and the first quarto printed by R. Raworth correctly credit Shirley, but the title-page carries no information concerning acting company or playhouse. Nason suggests that the work was probably written for a Dublin acting company during Shirley's stay in Ireland. 5 There is no reason to suppose that the play was performed at the Phoenix, the playhouse for which Shirley had been the regular dramatist earlier in his career. Scholars have therefore found it difficult to account for the title-page inscription for the second quarto printed in 1661 with a variant title: "[within rows of ornaments] LOVE will finde out the Way . / An Excellent / COMEDY. // By T. B. // As it was Acted with great Applause, / by Her Majesties Servants, at / the Phoenix in Drury Lane . // [lace ornament] // LONDON: / Printed by Ja : Cottrel , for Samuel Speed , at the Signe of the / Printing-Press in St. Paul's Church-yard. 1661." Bentley notes the initials "T. B." are also affixed to the epilogue of this printing; he therefore suggests that they were carried to the title-page through a printer's error. 6 In this paper we note that the inscription concerning performance at the Phoenix may have been a printer's error brought about by the use of standing type. An advertisement following the epilogue offers evidence concerning the circumstances under which the play was printed in 1661: "There is lately Printed two excellent Comedies, en-/tituled, The Old Couple : By Thomas May Esquire. / The City-Night-Cap , or Crede quod habes &amp; habes . / By Robert Davenport . / Both these, with variety of other Playes, are to be / sold by Samuel Speed , at the Printing Press in St. / Pauls Church-Yard. 1661." If we examine the works mentioned in this advertisement, we see that The Old Couple is dated 1658 and that its title-page carries no information about acting company or playhouse. 7 The title-page of The City Night Cap , however, shows some obvious similarities to the title-page of Love Will Find Out the Way . The title-page of the Davenport play reads as follows: [within rows of ornaments] THE / City-Night-Cap: / Or, / Crede quod habes , &amp; habes . / A / Tragi-Comedy. // By Robert Davenport . // As it was Acted with great Applause, / by Her Majesties Servants, at / the Phoenix in Drury Lane . // LONDON: / Printed by Ja : Cottrel , for Samuel Speed , at the Signe of the / Printing-Press in St. Paul's Church-yard. 1661." Two reliable contemporary references corroborate this title-page inscription: (1) Sir Henry Herbert's office-book notes a license on October 14, 1624: "For the Cockpit [Phoenix] Company; a new Play, called, The City Night Cap : Written by Davenport." 8 (2) The records of the Lord Chamberlain for August 10, 1639 include this title in a list of plays protected for the King and Queen's Young Company who were then performing at the Phoenix. 9 Thus The City Night Cap was probably first produced at the Phoenix and remained in the repertory of that playhouse for at least fifteen years. Collation of Henry E. Huntington Library copies of the two title-pages reveals the following similarities and differences: (1) Both pages are set within flower borders of the same design, but the individual elements of the borders are in entirely different settings. (2) The titles and author designations differ, except for the word "By" which appears to have been printed from the same setting of type. (3) The City Night Cap title-page carries three rules; Love Will Find Out the Way carries four. The first and third rules in The City Night Cap exactly match the second and third rules of Love Will Find Out the Way . (4) The three-line inscription referring to the Phoenix appears to have been printed from the same setting of type. (5) The three-line imprint is also derived from the same setting of type, but with a minor variation in the horizontal position of the lowest line. It is therefore evident that after the title-page of one of the plays was printed, six lines of type were left standing, as well as the word "By" and two of the rules; these were used again in the printing of the second work. A clue concerning the order in which the plays were printed is provided by comparing the advertisement cited above with a similar advertisement appended to The City Night Cap : "There is lately Printed an excellent Comedy, enti/tuled, The Old Couple : By Thomas May Esquire. / Also another called, Love will finde out the Way : By / T. B. / Both these, with variety of other Playes, are to be / sold by Samuel Speed , at the Printing Press in St. / Pauls Church-Yard. 1661." Collation of the two advertisements indicates that the same setting of type was used for the last three lines and for the reference to " The Old Couple : By Thomas May Esquire." The wordings of the first lines are significantly different, however. Although the advertisement in The City Night Cap mentions both The Old Couple and Love Will Find Out the Way , the first line refers to "an excellent Comedy." The first line of the advertisement found in Love Will Find Out the Way states specifically that two plays have been printed. This difference suggests that The City Night Cap was printed first, and that when standing type for the advertisement was emended for inclusion at the end of Love Will Find Out the Way , the wording of the first line was changed from singular to plural form so that it would agree with the text that follows it. If this conjecture is correct, it lends support to the following hypotheses concerning the sequence of events in Cottrel's shop: (1) The printer's copy for The City Night Cap correctly identified the author, playhouse, and acting company. This information was set for the title-page; after the printing of that forme at least six lines of type, two rules, and the word "By" were left standing. (2) The manuscript (or heavily emended quarto of The Constant Maid ) used as copy for Love Will Find Out the Way carried no information concerning author or playhouse. The compositor found the initials "T. B." signed to the epilogue of the revised text and used these for author designation on the title-page. The imprint was needed again; when this standing type and two of the rules were set in the forme, the compositor also included the standing type for the inscription concerning the Phoenix. This part of the title-page statement may therefore have as little basis in fact as the statement that "T. B." is the author of the play.</field>

Bentley observes that the two printings of the play differ considerably in text; he summarizes the problem as follows: "A rough collation shows that it [Q2] is several hundred lines longer and that some pages seem to be completely revised; more of the songs are given in 1661 than in 1640. A more thorough collation might indicate whether this text would seem to have been revised for production at the Phoenix—where the title-page says it was acted but where Shirley did not work after his return from Ireland—or revised for Restoration production. There seem to be objections to either alternative. The T. B. [Theophilus Bird?] who appears as author on the 1661 title-page is unknown. . . . If he revised for a Restoration performance, why was not the Restoration performance used for advertising on the title-page?" 7 Greg 784. 8 As cited in Herbert , p. 29. 9 Malone Society Collections II (1931), 390.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Checklist of the Writings of Albion W. Tourgée (1838-1905) by Dean H. Keller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Albion W. Tourgée was born in Williamsfield, Ohio, on May 21, 1838. In 1847 he moved with his family to a farm near Kingsville, Ohio, and there he attended the Kingsville Academy. He entered the University of Rochester in 1859 and remained there, except for a short time in 1861 when he taught school in Wilson, New York, until the outbreak of the Civil War. Tourgée enlisted in the 27th New York Volunteers on April 19, 1861, but was discharged after receiving a severe wound on July 4, 1861. By July, 1862, he was well enough to rejoin the army. This time he received a commission in the 105th Ohio Volunteers and saw action in several major engagements. He was captured and spent several months in Confederate prisons before he was exchanged and discharged in 1864. The wound he had received left him in poor health, so at the end of the war he decided to try the warmer climate of the south. He moved with his wife, Emma, whom he had married in 1863, to Greensboro, North Carolina, in October, 1865. The nursery business in which he engaged failed in 1867, but by this time Tourgée was deeply involved in politics. During his stay in the south he was a judge of the Superior Court, a prominent member of the Constitutional Convention of 1868, a member of the Code Commission, and a Pension Agent. Life for Tourgée and his family was not pleasant in North Carolina. As a very active and outspoken "carpet-bagger" he was often the target of the Ku Klux Klan. In 1879 he decided to return to the north and support himself as a writer. Tourgée had contributed articles and poems to the North Carolina press and had published his first novel in 1874. In 1879 he published A Fool's Errand , based on his experiences in North Carolina, and it became one of the most successful novels of the time. The success of A Fool's Errand having established Tourgée as a literary figure, he spent the remainder of his life as a writer of fiction, essays and political articles. He edited two unsuccessful journals, Our Continent (1882-84) and The Basis (1895-96) and made several lecture tours. In 1897 he was appointed United States Consul at Bordeaux. He died in France on May 21, 1905. Tourgée was a prolific writer, and his interests and contacts were many. Today both the historian and the literary critic will find much of interest in his life and writings. It is hoped that this checklist will prove to be useful to scholars interested in Tourgée and that these scholars will be able to make significant additions to the list of Tourgée's works here presented. The checklist is divided into four main parts: I. Books II. Periodicals III. Publications Edited by Tourgée IV. Selected Biographical and Critical Material about Tourgée.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Whitman's Leaves of Grass : Notes on the Pocketbook (1889) Edition by William White</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of the scarce editions of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass was published by the poet himself in 1889, especially printed (with addenda) from the 1881 edition, as this is the copyright date printed on the verso of the title-page. The title-page reads: Leaves of Grass [irregular, ornamental letters] / with Sands at Seventy / &amp; A Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads. / May 31, 1889. / [8-line note by the poet on his 70th birthday] / Walt Whitman [signed in ink] / Portraits from Life. Autograph. Special Ed'n. / (300 copies only printed—$5 each.) /. The new edition was printed by Ferguson Bros. &amp; Co., Philadelphia, according to a legend below the copyright. Carolyn Wells and Alfred F. Goldsmith, in their Concise Bibliography of the Works of Walt Whitman (1922), pp. 32-33, describe the 1889 Leaves , citing the number of copies (300): "12mo, limp leather (black morocco), marbled end-papers, made in regular book form and also with flap, pocket-book style with inner pocket for papers, gilt edges, photographic portrait frontispiece, and other illustrations." Frank Shay, The Bibliography of Walt Whitman (1920), p. 29, is briefer, mentioning the 300 copies and adding: "Duodecimo, black morocco, with and without flaps, gilt edges." Gay Wilson Allen, The Solitary Singer (1955), p. 533, refers to this edition: "With Traubel's assistance, Whitman realized a long-cherished ambition on his seventieth birthday by publishing a handy pocket-size edition of his Leaves bound in leather, compactly printed in thin paper, with photograph tipped in, and autographed with a prefatory note on the title page." From unpublished documents in the Feinberg Collection, Detroit—here printed with the kind permission of Mr. Charles E. Feinberg—we can tell what happened and why we have two styles of binding of the 1889 Leaves , and how many copies of each. Whitman sent a "model" copy of the book to Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke, the London, Ontario, psychiatrist, who wrote to Horace L. Traubel on 16 June 1889: I have the little book and am charmed with it—seems to me perfect, "Divine am I inside and out." I want a copy exactly like the one I have except that the flap , and of course the tuck on front cover be left off and the letters on cover and be put on front instead of back cover. Same flexible leather used, same color &amp;c but made up in common book style. 1 Would it be possible to get one and have it bound so? If you could manage it for me I would send you the $5. for it and thank you besides. Whitman apparently liked the idea of copies "in common book style," for we have his instructions to his binder, written in blue pencil on heavy buff paper: "20 Autograph / First Sheets for Bindery / for 20 copies L of G / bound in green morocco ordinary / mode / ( without the pocket book flap / trimm'd close—full gilt)". In the upper right-hand corner, written in ink in Whitman's hand, is "Oldach &amp; Co: / Binders 1215 Filbert St / Phila:"; and in the upper left-hand corner, in Traubel's hand, is the legend, "See Notes July 3, '89". This refers to an as yet unpublished volume of Traubel's With Walt Whitman in Camden : it contains the date Whitman sent the sheets to be bound in the "ordinary mode." Thus we know that, of the 300 copies Whitman mentions on the title-page of the 1889 Leaves of Grass , 20 were bound without flaps, leaving 280 with the flap and the tuck. We cannot, however, be absolutely sure there were 280, for we have an initial binding order of only 104 copies. We do know that there were no more than 300 in all, which was all that Whitman intended to issue; in this respect he was scrupulously honest.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Blake's Jerusalem : Plate 3 Fully Restored by David V. Erdman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Studies in Bibliography , XVII (1964), 13-15, I presented a restoration of the deleted portions of Plate 3 of Blake's Jerusalem which left lines 36-37 incomplete. Quite extensive remnants of the deleted words, however, are visible in the reproduction of this plate that was printed opposite page 10, and one reader promptly supplied a clue to their recovery. Mr. Michael J. Tolley, of Massey University College of Manawatu, Palmerston North, suggested that the word above "I" in line 38 "looks very like Και" and that the whole passage might be a quotation of the "words of Jesus" in Greek . It is. I had noted the apparent Και but had failed to consider it as anything but the accidental shape of a deleted English text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a matter of a few hours, with Greek New Testament and concordance, to track down the quotation. With correction of "best words" to "last words" the whole passage may now be read with complete confidence as: We who dwell on Earth can do nothing of ourselves, every thing is conducted by Spirits, no less than Digestion or Sleep. to Note the last Words of Jesus, Eδοθη μοι παναζ εξουζια ουoαυω Και επι γηζ.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The line is Matthew 28:18, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth" (King James version). The style of the lettering is that of the inscription on the title-page of Vala , with a vertical ligature for the ου.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With this restoration of the whole Preface to Jerusalem we are at last in a position to make out what the full message of the Preface was—and to speculate as to Blake's probable reasons for emasculating it. Did the very ambiguity of the quotation from Matthew lead to its deletion? Was Blake saying that he had yielded up his will to the dictation of an all-powerful Saviour? Or was he saying that, having become "wholly One in Jesus" (line 13), he felt that all power had been given unto him, as it had been in the end given to Jesus, by the Divine Imagination, the God of books? Did Blake find, before publication, that the bold identification of his poetic genius with divine power was shocking to others—or to himself? Or that his "dear Christian Friends" tended to interpret his words in orthodox, Urizenic terms? Or did he first intend a somewhat orthodox message and then change his views?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am pleased to be able to raise these questions, while accepting the justice of the remark of Blake's mathematician, Obtuse Angle, that "A query &amp; an answer are as different as a strait line &amp; a crooked one."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Note on Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington . by Christopher Ricks</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The 'Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington' has been the subject of the most scrupulous textual study yet devoted to a poem by Tennyson: 'The History of a Poem', by Mr Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., in Studies in Bibliography (1960), volume XIII. It therefore seems worth offering a few corrections to Mr Shannon's invaluable account of the text. He wrote: Since it has not been feasible to examine all the numerous editions between 1856 and 1872 that printed the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington , I cannot say incontrovertibly that the five changes apparent in 1865 and the one in 1872 first entered the text on those dates; but the likelihood is strong that they did. (p.171) But this is not so with four of the five changes apparent in 1865 (that is, A Selection from the Works of Alfred Tennyson ). In line 56, the final reading 'its' for 'his' is to be found before 1865, in Maud, and Other Poems , 'A New Editon', 1859. Three further final readings are to be found before 1865, in Maud , and Other Poems , 'A New Edition', 1864: in line 113, 'Beyond' for 'Past'; in line 155, 'Briton' for 'Saxon'; and in line 278, 'Speak' for 'But speak'. Yet let me follow Mr Shannon's wise example, and make no claim to have examined all the printings of the 'Ode'.</field>
