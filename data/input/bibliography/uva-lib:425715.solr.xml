      <field name="heading_text">The Reviser Observed: The Last Volume of Sir Charles Grandison by Jocelyn Harris</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is, indeed, quickly discoverable, that Consultation and Compliance can conduce little to the Perfection of any literary Performance. . . . ( Rambler , No. 23, 5 June 1750). The last volume of Samuel Richardson's Sir Charles Grandison (1753-54) is decidedly odd. The story does not end in any obvious way, for the hero has already married the first heroine, Harriet Byron, in the sixth and penultimate volume. The second heroine, Clementina della Porretta, is left drifting and purposeless; a third candidate, Olivia, does not appear at all. Sir Charles's ward, Emily Jervois, remains single and unhappily devoted to her guardian; Harriet, after a near-miscarriage, is not yet delivered of her child; and scenes meant to show the shrewish Charlotte Grandison in her tamed state are simply not convincing. Conversations are arbitrarily renewed from earlier volumes, and two characters whom we have virtually forgotten, Sir Hargrave Pollexfen and Sir Rowland Meredith, suddenly reappear. The result is a seventh volume half a volume over-measure (Carroll, p. 301) 1 which has amply fulfilled Richardson's own predictions of debate and confusion (Carroll, p. 296). That the last volume of Grandison is aesthetically wayward, digressive, and often distorting to characterisation and probability could be explained first if Richardson had not made up his mind how to end the work, and second if he had revised hastily in the months before publication of the first duodecimo edition and the second quarto edition on 14 March 1754. (For a printing history of Grandison see the Chronology of the Oxford English Novels edition, ed. Jocelyn Harris, 1972). Certainly there seem to be remarkably close links between the material of the last volume and the letters that Richardson exchanged with his friends from August 1753 to February 1754. It looks very much as though he were consulting them in order to revise in proof. Such behavior would be entirely typical. In his own mind, Richardson was not primarily an artist: he saw himself as a moralist for whom the fable was significant as a vehicle for the message; if the fable did not make its point, then it must be changed completely and in detail. To succeed, the work must be morally invulnerable. To this end, he had answered the criticisms made of Pamela I by Fielding and others in the explanatory and defensive Pamela II (Owen Jenkins, "Richardson's Pamela and Fielding's 'Vile Forgeries'", PQ , 44 [1965], 200-210); he checked Clarissa even as he wrote it, against the opinions of his friends (T. C. Duncan Eaves and Ben D. Kimpel, Samuel Richardson, A Biography , 1971, pp. 205-213); he responded to the furor consequent on that novel's publication by a quantity of remedial revisions to the second, third and fourth editions, some under the guise of "restorations"; 2 and he altered both Pamela and Clarissa extensively for later editions (T. C. Duncan Eaves and Ben D. Kimpel, "Richardson's Revisions of Pamela", SB , 20 [1967], 61-68; Kinkead-Weekes, supra; Eaves and Kimpel, pp. 317-318). He would compile an Index for Grandison that tried to control the reader's moral response, and he would refine character and situation right out of existence in the Moral Sentiments of 1755, to the same purpose. Grandison itself would be revised five times, the substantive revisions usually corresponding to the comments he had received (see the Textual Note to the O.E.N. Grandison ). In the writing of Pamela and Clarissa , Richardson had enjoyed some measure of imaginative freedom: Pamela I occupied only two months (Carroll, p. 41), and Clarissa , vastly more ambitious, was in first draft within two years, although the revising took a year and a half more (Eaves and Kimpel, pp. 205-213; also their article, "The Composition of Clarissa and Its Revision before Publication", PMLA , 83 [1968], 416-428). But the wrangling over Clarissa induced in Richardson an almost paralyzing caution. He had moreover no irresistible plot, and at first starting on Grandison he could only attempt to clarify in the new book the unresolved issues of the last, that is, the nature of a good man, and the parent-child relationship. During the four long years while Richardson wrote his final work, he consulted his friends anxiously and continuously (see Introduction to the O.E.N. edition). He read the manuscript to his family and to friends in residence, he sent excerpts to absentees, he encouraged visitors to sample portions. Sometimes Richardson begged help for his balky muse, sometimes he needed a corroborating authority, but usually he treated his friends as representatives of the public to come. That is, he sought their response that he might anticipate trouble after publication. For instance, he could place suitable remonstrances in the mouth of an authoritative figure, or, more subtly, expand a rebuttal into an anecdote, a scene, or even a new character. Within the manuscript, Richardson could have the last, definitive word. But once printing had begun, this was no longer true. What was done in the first six volumes was done, and Richardson's very last chance to answer criticism of the whole lay in the last volume. Certainly we find him pressing his friends to comment on earlier volumes with an urgency that is otherwise inexplicable. His fear of appearing vulnerable he showed openly to Lady Bradshaigh: "I shall be half afraid, that if you are so reserved as you mention, with the two first Vols. that you are ashamed of them, and keep them from your select Friends, till I have exposed myself by a general Publication, that it may not be your Fault" (FC XI, f.35). He invited comment from a number of his acquaintances in London, Lancashire, Ireland and even Holland by sending them single proof sheets, bundles of proofs and unbound pre-publication volumes (for information about his friends, see Eaves and Kimpel), begging, for instance, volume and page references for the "kind Hints of Correction" offered by Patrick Delany, Dean of Down, and his household (Carroll, pp. 260-263). But it was Lady Bradshaigh, unsuccessful pleader for Clarissa's life, and constant enthusiast during the composition of Grandison , who was in October 1753 most closely urged to chronicle her reactions to Clementina (Carroll, p. 244) and again, in November, when he did not know that she had responded with thirty-two pages, to Clementina, Harriet, Charlotte, and Sir Charles (Carroll, p. 248). This long letter, finally dated 27 November 1753 (FC XI, ff. 41-48), Richardson answered with the utmost scrupulousness on 8 December (Carroll, pp. 249-260), drawing up friends on one side and the other of her argument. He repeated his request not to be spared, particularly on the matter of the "divided love" of Sir Charles, torn between Harriet and Clementina. But most significant is his promise that the last volume would leave her complaints about Sir Charles's divided affection without foundation. Lady Bradshaigh, dashed by his counter-arguments, was reluctant to write, and had to be encouraged to give her opinion on the "Catastrophe" (4 January 1754, Carroll, p. 270). But why should he want to know, unless the "Catastrophe" were not yet in print? In his first draft of the ending he had been indecisive, telling his friend Thomas Edwards on 25 October 1752 that he thought he was at "a Period of my Story: Except I change the Catastrophe on going over it again" (Carroll, p. 220), and even as he began printing the first volume informed him on 20 February 1753 that "The Story, however, is not yet concluded" (Carroll, p. 221). Much later in the year, on 5 October 1753, Lady Bradshaigh was told that the catastrophe still lay in the "unprinted Part of my Story" (Carroll, p. 244). Lady Bradshaigh responded vehemently on 14 January 1754, with material that Richardson appears, from echoes in the last volume, to have used to discuss the divided love and for the resolution of the whole story (FC XI, ff. 62-65). He complained to her a month before publication, on 8 February 1754, "I have a great deal to do, and but one Volume to do it in" (Carroll, p. 279), and six days later still wanted to know whether the means taken to impel Clementina into marriage with the Count of Belvedere, her second choice, were "natural" (Carroll, p. 291). It looks as though the ending could still have been changed. Richardson had, then, actively sought advice about his conclusion for at least a year. There was plenty of time to act on suggested alterations: the printing of almost six volumes and part of the seventh occupied him for six months, and when the book was pirated in Dublin, he had an excuse to postpone publication of the seventh volume for seven months more. From the beginning of August 1753, when he stopped his press, to the end of February 1754, Richardson was free to reconsider and, if necessary, to rewrite. Richardson originally planned to publish the seventh volume in early February 1754 (Carroll, p. 237), but the delay extended to 14 March. His reasons were two-fold, he said: the town was empty, and he wished to prevent the Irish pirates from completing their edition. "But", he added mysteriously, "this I am at present silent about for Reasons" (Carroll, p. 242). He repeated to Lady Bradshaigh on 4 January 1754 just as mysteriously that there were "Several Causes conspiring to delay [publication], perhaps till some time in the next Month" (FC XI, ff. 58-61). If the "Reasons" and "Causes" were his revising activities, all would become clear. Certainly the circumstantial evidence suggests that he revised in response to correspondence during this period, and two pieces of evidence prove that he was certainly tinkering with the proofs as late as 8 February 1754. Could this be possible? How many sheets were involved? And could they be printed in the time? In the Case of Samuel Richardson, Printer , published 14 September 1753 to attack the Dublin pirates, Richardson estimated that the pirates had "Five entire Volumes [12°], the greatest Part of the Sixth, and . . . several Sheets of the Seventh and last; but the Work being stopt when the Wickedness was known, they cannot have the better half of the concluding Volume". By 5 October he thought that they had less, "[no] more than three or four Shts. of Vol. VI and about half of Vol. VII (for I stopt, as soon as I was apprized of the Villainy)" (Carroll, p. 242). That is, the first half of the Vol. VII was already set, by August, and only eleven sheets remained to be composed. Printing need not have begun, only proofing. This the bibliographical evidence supports: when Richardson printed his third edition 12°, which he decided upon early in December 1753 (Carroll, p. 260), he used the formes of the first edition, revised, for signatures K-U in the third edition (William Merritt Sale, Samuel Richardson, A Bibliographical Record of his Literary Career with Historical Notes , 1936, p. 68). Both editions have substantially similar contents and identical pagination, except for signatures B and C. That the formes were still standing suggests that they had recently been in use, for the first edition. Signatures B-I (presumably, the "several sheets" the pirates stole, and the place that Richardson stopped) he printed from different settings of type in the two duodecimo editions because of the necessity of inserting into the third edition the "unlucky omission", as he called it, that had been tacked on to the end of the first. (The pirated edition, which came out some time later, is identical with Richardson's first edition. Presumably the pirates discarded the "half of Vol. VII" they had in stolen proofs, in order to appear legitimate by copying Richardson's published version.) The last two thirds of the eleven sheets K-U could have been set and proofed at any time between August 1753 and February 1754, for they contain the Index which Richardson was already drawing up in July 1753 (Carroll, p. 238); the four-page list of Similes and Allusions; the Concluding Note written in December 1753 (Carroll, p. 264); and Richardson's Address to the Reader , which was printed off the same formes (with obvious changes in pagination and signatures) as the pamphlet he published about the piracy on 1 February 1754. These addenda occupy O6 v -U5, leaving only four and a half sheets of actual story to be revised at the last moment. By 26 December 1753 an extensive change could no longer be made to signature B in the first edition, presumably because it would unduly put out all those sheets already set ("about half of Vol. VII"). Instead, Richardson had to print it as an "unlucky omission" at the end. For two smaller revisions, though, Richardson reprinted a whole signature, C (which contains no cancellans), to insert first an apology on shell-taste and second an assertion by Sir Charles that he loved Harriet before she loved him. Both revisions were to please Lady Bradshaigh, as he told her in his letter of 8 February 1754 (FC X1, ff. 66-68, Carroll, p. 281). And when on 5 February she sent a scandalous interpretation of Olivia's conduct which applied only too well to Clementina's actions in the last volume, Richardson almost certainly rushed to contain the inevitable criticism by extensive alterations from signature I onwards. It is perfectly feasible that Richardson, in order to receive as much comment as he could, printed his last volume at a very late date, that is, the 19½ duodecimo sheets in the first edition and the corresponding 30 (A-Z, Aa-Ff1) octavo sheets in the second edition. He was indeed busy at the time with House of Commons records (Carroll, p. 247), but he refused or parted with at least five pieces of work (Barbauld, V, 237), and sent out the first six volumes of the third edition to seven other printers (Carroll, p. 301). The seventh, vital, volume he kept to himself, and he kept it secret. No-one, it appears, saw either the manuscript or the proofs of the seventh volume, nor were prepublication copies circulated in the manner of the former six. "None of my own Family", wrote Richardson to Lady Bradshaigh on 4 January 1754, "nor more than One Family, and two Persons more, have any Notion of the Ending (necessary Workmen excepted); and they are all as secret as the Night" (Carroll, p. 272). Even these few, whoever they were, apparently had only a "Notion", and had not viewed the manuscript. Richardson the printer could offer extraordinary privileges to Richardson the author in the way of revising, and so long as he kept strict secrecy, he had perfect freedom. Twenty days elapsed between 5 February 1754, when Richardson received Lady Bradhaigh's alarming letter that applied to Clementina, and 25 February, when Richardson sent her the last volume in the first and second editions (Carroll, p. 295), more than enough time for the requisite printing, gathering, and distribution. Richardson had plenty of men: for the earlier volumes work went on "at convenience" with "30 or 40" workmen ( An Address to the Public ), and he "took in help" (numbers unspecified) for the seventh volume (Barbauld V, 237). So at least 13 men, on average, must have been employed in each of his three printing-houses (see his Case ), working on most or all of the nine presses that Richardson used near the end of his career (William Merritt Sale, Samuel Richardson, Master Printer , Cornell Studies in English 37, [1950], 29). His workmen's swift fingers could set 1000 or even 1500 letters an hour (Eaves and Kimpel, p. 166)—and we are only concerned here with revision, not with the first setting of the whole. His pressmen must have been equally able. Working for piece-rates, they might well go all out for a week's rich reward: Joseph Moxon's figure for a two-man press of 250 impressions per hour ( Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing , ed. Herbert Davis and Harry Carter, 1958, pp. 343-344) might well be exceeded, since at the Bowyer Press in the week ending 28 September 1734, six men handling forty-three formes appear to have averaged three hundred and forty-seven impressions an hour, allowing a week of sixty hours (Bowyer printing ledger, Grolier Club accession number 19472, on loan to the Bodleian Library. Drawn to my attention by Keith Maslen). For the duodecimo volume there were 3000 copies to be printed, 1000 for the octavo (Carroll, p. 259). If we consider only the sheets that were definitely printed after the August piracy, signatures K-U and C duodecimo occupy 12 sheets, or 24 formes, and thus 72,000 impressions were required. The corresponding signatures in octavo, Q-Z, Aa-Ff1, occupy 14 sheets, or 28 formes, requiring 28,000 impressions. The total for the two editions is 100,000 impressions. One press working at 250 impressions per hour could accomplish the whole in 400 hours, or nine presses in almost 45 hours. With an eight-hour day (or longer) and a six-day week, this would fall well within the twenty days that passed between Lady Bradshaigh's seemingly influential letter and Richardson's dispatch to her of the last volume. Indeed, it would have been possible to alter and print the other five signatures, D-I, in addition. It was, then, physically possible for Richardson, the habitual and secret reviser, to have altered the proofs of the last Grandison volume. But what did he think he had to change? Most of the evidence for revision is circumstantial, that is, the text of the last volume wears on occasion uncanny resemblance to letters that Richardson had received. But the case is supported by the two items that I have already mentioned as certain proof of revision: the second, Sir Charles's assertion of love, I shall discuss shortly, but the first arose from Lady Bradshaigh's complaint on 27 November 1753 that she was "half affronted" at Lord G. giving his shells to Emily, since she was but a child (FC XI, ff. 41-48). Richardson apologised flippantly on 8 December 1753 (FC XI, ff. 49-53), and only remembered in his letter of 8 February 1754 why she would not be mollified: Lady Bradshaigh was herself a shell-worker, and had condescended to donate a piece to the Richardson's lesser parlour at North-End. The blunder was dreadful, and he could only offer her, within the work, an impeccable authority. "What is done, is done", he wrote, "But I have thrown into the last Volume, a Hint, that the excellent Mother of Sir Charles Grandison delighted in Shell-works" (FC XI, ff. 66-68). This hint appears on p. 29, C3 r , and proves absolutely that signature C (which contains no cancellans), though an early sheet of the volume, was rewritten and printed after 8 February. With such definite proof of tinkering in mind, it is legitimate to suspect other things in signature C. For instance, an anonymous letter received about 26 December 1753 attacked Sir Charles for abandoning his tenants and living abroad (FC XV, 3, ff. 25-26). In the reprinted signature C can be found what seems to be a defence of Sir Charles, for it appears that, though he was indeed an absentee landlord, he took a close personal interest in his estate and tenants, and for their sake had managed to study husbandry and law on his busy continental tours (VII, 44-45). If these debatable matters in signature C could be changed, why not miscellaneous things in other signatures? Alterations need not, of course, all have taken place as late as 8 February 1754, and close correlations between the text and letters received over this period suggest that they could have been made at any time. For instance, one of Richardson's main reasons for writing Grandison had been his dismay at the favourable response accorded Lovelace and Tom Jones, so that he set out in the new book to show the true horror of rakery once again. But his flighty ward, Sophia Wescomb, confessed in July 1753 that she liked the gay figure of his anti-example, Sir Hargrave Pollexfen (FC XIV, 3, ff. 94-95). Reproved (Carroll, p. 241), she suggested provocatively on 28 August that a punishment for her indelicacy about Sir Hargrave "shou'd be to Marry her first to [him] &amp; afterwards bring her acquainted, &amp; make her terribly in Love with [Lovelace]" (FC XIV, 3, ff. 102-103). The allusion to Madame de la Fayette's Princess of Cleves must have been instantly recognisable, and in an odd scene of Volume VII the book is discussed. Mrs Shirley, until now a stiff allegory of Resigned Old Age, suddenly waxes eloquent about her life and love. As a girl she had wondered, "Suppose, after I have vowed Love to a man quite indifferent to me, I should meet with the very one, the kindred soul, who must irresistably claim my whole heart?". "A Duke de Nemours!" says her friend Mrs Eggleton (a character introduced merely to answer her back), "taking up the Princess of Cleves , that unluckily lay on my table". Thus the moral, that the Princess should not be copied (Letter 42, K4 r -K9 r ). Another young lady, Susanna Highmore, the painter's daughter, was equally incorrigible in her admiration of rakes (see Richardson's response, Carroll, pp. 272-275), and it may well be for her sake that Greville, a rake from the first volume who made threats on Sir Charles's life in the sixth, suddenly and unsuitably applies for Lucy Selby's hand in the seventh. He is rejected perfunctorily (p. 191, I12 r ) so that she can marry an Irish peer hastily found for her before the book ends. But Greville's proposal allows of a discussion in which occur several concepts and phrases from Richardson's letter answering Miss Highmore: where he had rebuked her for being diverted with rakes, for judging too charitably, and for failing to perceive their vanity, Harriet Byron reproves in similar terms a sullen Lucy, until now a characterless good girl (pp. 71-74, D12 r -E1 v ). Another item is equally suspect: Richardson knew by December 1753 (Carroll, p. 255) that some readers objected to the Grandison sisters' way of finding out Harriet's love for Sir Charles (II, Letter 5), and the episode is unexpectedly defended in the last volume (p. 96, E12 v ). Other comments seem to have affected characters. Lady Bradshaigh loathed Olivia, for example (FC XI, ff. 41-48), and except for a letter from her which does not appear, Olivia is conspicuously absent from the last volume. This in spite of the fact that Richardson had originally planned her story in considerably more detail than appears in the book (Carroll, pp. 278-279). Emily had also been attacked, for her " Love " of Sir Charles when it should have been, Lady Bradshaigh thought, the "wholey filial " affection proper to a ward (FC XI, ff. 41-48). Mrs Delany sent Mrs Dewes a similar criticism on 3 December 1753: "she ought not to have been in love! She was too young to be won by the shining virtues of her guardian; they should rather have given her an awe for him as for a parent, unless he had not been the man he was, and had courted her love, for he always treats her as a favourite child". She repeated on 21 December 1753 that Richardson was wrong to show Emily in love so young, "unless he means to show young women how they may by resolution and proper endeavours get the better of any passion ". This comment she planned to deliver in person, "when I see Mr Richardson" ( Autobiography and Correspondence of Mary Granville, Mrs. Delany , ed. Lady Llanover, 1861, III, 1st series, pp. 251, 256). These three points, the suspect nature of Emily's affection, the part Sir Charles might have played in encouraging it, and the method of escape from her compromising situation, are all to be found explicated in the last volume. Harriet points out to Emily (pp. 64-69, D8 v -D11 r ) the curious precocity of her love, but Emily accuses Harriet of jealousy, insisting that her love is admiration only. Richardson can then, typically, turn on the "censorious" who accuse Emily of a love more than filial. Emily accuses herself, with pretty ingenuousness, of indelicacy in loving a married man, but she may be forgiven by Harriet ("Don't hate me", cries Emily to Harriet, and to us). She is freed from Sir Charles in the next half-signature (pp. 83-96, E6 r -E12 v ) by Mrs Delany's solution: she resolves to leave. Her behavior on departure is beyond reproach; that of Sir Charles shows "The Brother, the affectionate Friend, and Father, I may say" (p. 153, H5 r ). References to her extreme youth make it impossible for her to love Sir Charles in any culpable way, but for the same reason she cannot marry Beauchamp, a loose end annoying to the tidy-minded reader. From Richardson's point of view, a situation may have been saved. "Thank God," says Emily, "that I made my escape in time." Did she really mean, before the last volume was printed? The third character to be attacked was Charlotte Grandison, now Lady G. Mrs Donnellan had complained as far back as 9 November 1752 about Charlotte's coarseness (Barbauld IV, 76-77), criticism echoed on 3 December 1753 by Mrs Delany ( Autobiography , III, 1st series, p. 251), and by Lady Bradshaigh, who on 11 December 1753 particularly specified her "contemptible usage of her Husband" (FC XI, ff. 54-57). With unusual meekness, Richardson agreed on 4 January 1754 that "her Sauciness to her Husband is inexcusable" (FC XI, ff. 58-61). Because of his last-minute capitulation, it is interesting to observe that Charlotte, while really bad in signatures B-I (especially p. 7, where she pretends Lord G. has a breeding fly in his mouth; and pp. 167-168, where she remains petulant), undergoes a radical reformation from signature K onwards, the sheets that remained to be set after the piracy. Her reconciliation with her husband follows the usual defensive pattern: self-reproach met by absolution from the victim (Letter 43, pp. 209-213, K9-K11 r ). The whole scene also provides a timely "proof" that prudence, not self-willed romanticism, is the best guide in marriage—a theory elaborated by Charlotte in Letter 42. This is a new Charlotte, and Harriet anticipates the general surprise: "Such a Setting-out in matrimony; who would have expected Charlotte to make such a wife, mother, nurse!" (p. 295, O4 r ). Who indeed, and the character suffers for it. Harriet also was criticized by Mrs Delany for "telling her love to so many !" ( Autobiography , III, 1st series, p. 252; also Carroll, pp. 244-245). Lady Bradshaigh agreed (FC XI, ff. 41-48), especially over the choice of old Sir Rowland Meredith, the Welsh knight, as confidant. "I think her frank-heartedness , hurts her delicasey ", she complained. "Miss Byron's declarations of love , for a man who had not made her any . . . will for Ever remain a blemish in the Character". Only Sir Charles's addresses should have drawn her from her reserve. By return post Richardson stressed Harriet's adoptive relationship to Sir Rowland (Carroll, pp. 251-257): to her "father" Sir Rowland and to her "mother" Lady D. Harriet must tell the truth. Richardson was thus clearly anxious about Harriet's openness, and when Sir Rowland, by now long lost to the reader, reappears in signature D (pp. 56-62) officiously to stress the relationship, one can at least be suspicious that these scenes were late insertions. On the second point, that Harriet loved first, there is definite proof that Richardson tampered with the text at a late date, for he wrote to Lady Bradshaigh on 8 December 1753, "And is Love then a vincible Passion, that a Lady must have an Example set her by the Man? I wish it were so. I have made this Nicety taken notice of between Sir Charles and Harriet in the last Volume" (Carroll, p. 257). This "Nicety" must be the revelation in signature C, reset for the shell-taste insertion, that Sir Charles fell in love with Harriet in the fraction of time before she could fall in love with him (pp. 38-39). At one stroke Richardson answered all who objected to Harriet's loving first, and to some extent made her immodest prattling allowable. "You know not", says Sir Charles, "the struggle it cost me . . . to conceal my Love", and indeed we do not. From his first sight of Harriet, we are now told, Sir Charles was a striking example of the vincibility of passion. Beside this circumstantial evidence, this inner contradiction, Richardson's open admission of revision is almost redundant. Two clear pieces of evidence, then, one on the shells and one on the "Nicety", together with the close relationship of correspondence to printed text, suggest that C was reset as late as 8 February, and that B, D-O6 r may also have been revised in proof before printing, affecting various topics and some characters. A second group of revisions may have concerned the catastrophe The novel was doomed to dullness once the fortunate couple were married, and Richardson knew it. As early as June 1752 he had startled the young ladies by threatening violent extinction to the hero (Carroll, pp. 215-217), and distinct traces of this fright are left in Volume VI. Nearer the time of printing, Richardson obviously longed to finish the work with the éclat of Clarissa rather than the ordinariness of Pamela II , and to Lady Bradshaigh on 5 October 1753 he hopefully revived the notion of disaster: "The unprinted Part of my Story, hurries on the Catastrophe, the strange, perhaps, unnatural Catastrophe" (Carroll, p. 244). She was just reading of Sir Charles's return to Italy in the fourth volume, and guessed at once that Richardson must have a polygamous solution in mind (they had debated the topic on previous occasions). Now affairs must be wholly tragical, unless "your Hero is to be reserv'd, to honour the Frumping body of old Batchalors" (FC XI, ff. 41-48). Richardson, having sent her the fifth and sixth volumes, told her on 8 December 1753 not to be frightened, a good part of the difficulty would be over by the end of the sixth, where the marriage takes place. But he insisted that a polygamous scheme for sharing Sir Charles might still be magnanimously proposed by a first wife, elaborating enthusiastically on a wholesale slaughter of Clementina's family (Carroll, pp. 252-253). "Good Heaven! are you Mad?" cried Lady Bradshaigh (FC XI, ff. 54-57). But Richardson kept his secret, only telling her on 4 January 1754 (Carroll, p. 270) that some readers objected to the possibility that Clementina would marry the Count of Belvedere, her parents' choice, and some wanted to see her in a nunnery. Laurana, her next inheritor, should be killed, to prevent her fortune going out of the Porretta family. Another group wanted to kill the noble lady herself, and others guessed Harriet would die, to make room for Clementina. (Thomas Edwards reported on 28 February 1754 that the rumour of Harriet's child-bed death "is got abroad pretty much", but discounted it [MS Bodl. 1012, pp. 155-156]. Maybe he had inside knowledge.) Or, he repeated, he could have them both, "by Consent". "Now, Madam", Richardson concluded, "you will oblige me (tho' the Catastrophe, whatever it be, is decided) if you will favour me with your Choice, and your Reasons for it". But why should he offer her such a range of alternatives if he had indeed decided upon every detail of the conclusion? He did say that "in my murdering, and other Schemes", he only intended to amuse her, but Lady Bradshaigh was appalled. Reasons against such a tragedy she gave in plenty and in detail on 14 January and 5 February 1754, and if the ending did not come out as she wished, "I shall kick, and flounce and be very ungovernable " (FC XI, ff. 69-74). Excited by her vehemence, Richardson wrote teasingly on 8 February 1754 that it was Harriet's very success that had made her enemies among the readers, so that a child-bed death would promote sympathetic grief (Carroll, pp. 276-278). Again on 14 February 1754 he reminded Lady Bradshaigh of his options, that Clementina should be thrown into a nunnery, or be stuck "among the stars", or that Harriet should die in child-bed. Some too had suggested that Sir Charles should be drowned, "But that is not his death. In such a death he could not be great. . . . Such a hero cannot fall alone, that's certain" (Carroll, p. 291). Lady Bradshaigh was devastated. Writing on 22 February 1754 she burst out, "Death, Death, Death, is your Darling ! Misery, Deep Distress , is what your Soul pants after". Utterly vexed that he had apparently paid no attention to her, she suggested bitterly that he might as well kill everyone in the book (FC XI, ff. 83-86). Richardson was at last contrite, and rushed to make amends on 25 February 1754, arguing that the contemporary time-scheme made too much "Business" impossible (Carroll, p. 296). But it is ridiculous to say that fictional work is subordinate to actual time. So why did Richardson loose his imagination in this way? It could well be that he was prepared to change the ending if Lady Bradshaigh had shown the slightest sign of approval. The point at which the story could have been sent off on its new track still survives in the last volume: the pregnant Harriet faints, and people hear that "Lady Grandison was dying". She develops fever, only to be saved by blood-letting and the devoted nursing of Sir Charles. The episode begins and ends arbitrarily (pp. 235-238, L10 r -L11 v ), and Charlotte reports it whimsically to prevent concern, but its very presence suggests a ghostly and tragical dimension into which the story could have shifted at one stroke from Richardson's "murdering Pen". A third group of probable revisions concerns the double love of Sir Charles for Clementina and Harriet. Richardson's lack of story had led him to the desperate expedient of introducing a second heroine, and for long enough he could not decide which one to elevate (Carroll, pp. 194-195). In the sixth volume he had hopefully elaborated on the concept of the divided heart, without, however, revealing in what proportions that heart was divided. But opposition to what Mrs Donnellan had called in 1752 the "unnatural affair" of the double love (Barbauld, IV, 75) ran high, and certain oddities in the last volume look like the belated products of a half-hearted compromise. Richardson had canvassed opinion thoroughly, questioning whether he should make his heroines equal in status, or one superior to the other. When Mrs Chapone sympathised on 10 December 1753 (FC XIII, 1, ff. 94-97), he confessed that he was "much acustomed to the Attacks of very excellent Women on this head" (Carroll, p. 264). These he described as "Enthusiasts in the Theory of Love", but he could not similarly dismiss the anonymous report of 26 January 1754 that "The general Cry among the Men is, how much they despise a Man who could be in Love with two Women at once" (FC XV, 3, f. 32). Lady Bradshaigh's wavering sympathies settled now on one heroine, now on the other, but she was adamant by 27 November 1753 about the main issue, that it was impossible "for a man to be Equally in love with two angells at the same time, do not suppose I can ever come into that" (FC XI, ff. 41-48). How could he ever marry, "for a devided heart he must ever have". Richardson claimed to relish her confusion on 8 December, but he asked anxiously for her opinion of the fifth volume octavo, which contains careful explanations of the delicate situation by having Sir Charles repeat his proposal to Harriet three whole times. These, he said, were "some Parts of my Management, which will be seen in a fuller Light than before". She would find Sir Charles, though a good man, "apprehensive of the Consequences of the Female Foible, double or divided Love &amp;c., and like a good Man, indulgent to its Weaknesses" (Carroll, p. 259). His suggestion that only a silly woman would care about the double love, Lady Bradshaigh staunchly repelled, insisting that an unequivocal choice should be made for Harriet (FC XI, ff. 54-57). Sir Charles should offer her the greater part of his admiration, and not allow any of his heart to Clementina. The proposals delighted her ("now he appears as free in his Choice, as if he never had seen Clementina"), with the reservation that his change of heart had happened in the twinkling of an eye. Richardson denied this hotly on 4 January 1754, drawing from detailed textual references a time-scheme that decently allowed the double love to become single. He still defended affection distributed where it was due, but admitted that in company with Mrs Donnellan, Miss Mulso had "exulted, by clapping her Wings . . . on your Ladiship's Censure of the divided Love" (Carroll, pp. 267, 272). Lady Bradshaigh pursued her advantage on 14 January, and again on 5 February 1754 (FC XI, ff. 62-65, 69-74). The divided love was then an important issue not only during the composition of the book, but also while the seventh volume was being set. It would not be surprising that under such pressure Richardson might be convinced, and that he should attempt to suggest in the space left to him (contrary to earlier evidence) that Sir Charles preferred Harriet in the past and for the present, and that he would always do so in the future. The ways to convey this impression, together with the definitive exaltation of Harriet over Clementina, appear to have been derived from the letters of correspondents. First, the establishment of Harriet's prior claim. Lady Bradshaigh, reading the first four volumes, was naturally puzzled by Richardson's indecision over the two heroines. On 27 November 1753 she thought he had explained himself satisfactorily before setting out for Italy ("Now we are to suppose him prepossest in favour of Miss Byron?"), but the emotional scenes with Clementina left her baffled: "He was actually in love with Miss Byron when he left England, he is now professedly so, with Clementina. I never heard of the like" (FC XI, ff. 41-48). Richardson was astonished (Carroll, p. 252), and demanded proof of her assertion that Harriet had always been first in Sir Charles's mind. This Lady Bradshaigh provided, drawing most of her items from the three proposals, which, as I have suggested, were very carefully written by Richardson in order to cast exactly this interpretation over past events. Clementina's love was "in a Manner forc'd upon him", whereas he loved Harriet and could not help it. Most clearly in the library at Colnebrooke (III, Letter 15) she saw his preference in his embarrassment and his silence, as well as in his statement to Dr Bartlett (VI, Letter 18) that he would have been pursuing his own inclinations if he loved Harriet (FC XI, ff. 62-65). Richardson, grateful for the support she gave his creative consistency, wrote on 8 February 1754, "I will for the future have recourse to your Ladiship's Letters, when I am called upon to explain Passages to less attentive Readers". As a reward he promised her that in the last volume she would find Sir Charles owning to Harriet that he had loved her from the moment he saw her, and before she could possibly have loved him. "I know you will be pleased when you come to this Place" (Carroll, pp. 281-282). This is the confession I have already referred to as a late alteration in C, the signature that was certainly reprinted on account of the shell-taste insertion. But consistency suffers (Sir Charles had declared himself impervious to personal attractions, in VI, Letter 18), as does morality, for Sir Charles attacks love at first sight as indelicate in a man, and worse in a woman (IV, Letter 18). Both Sir Charles and Harriet stand condemned by the revision. Second, the preference of Harriet in the present. Lady Bradshaigh again provided a useful record of response, first being jealous of Clementina and then "over head and ears in love" with her (FC XI, f. 37). Soon she was writing, "I cannot conceive how Miss Byron can ever appear preferable to Clementina in the Eyes of S r Charles. . . . Take care you do not make Har t . appear mean " (FC XI, ff. 41-48). She demanded the reinstating of all the " Insipid " Harriet's perfections, and that she be exalted above Clementina to be the first choice of Sir Charles, for Clementina's religion and country made her impossible as a wife. Richardson pointed out that Harriet's main glory was to "prefer the noble Enthusiast to herself", blaming Lady Bradshaigh for being swayed by Clementina (Carroll, p. 252). She answered only that she had always preferred Harriet, the patient sufferer (FC XI, ff. 62-65), which made him complain on 14 February 1754 of an otherwise insensitive world: ". . . surely they were at least equally great. Clementina renounced the same man, in favour of her supreme duties , that Harriet gave up in favour of a Rival Sister; tho' she had reason to think he loved her; and had actually drawn a parallel between their two cases, in which religion, country, and almost every worldly and unworldly consideration gave her the Preference, were the happiness of the man so equally beloved by both my children to determine" (Carroll, pp. 288-289). The inflated style is suspect enough, but the arguments are also faulty. Richardson himself, as I have said, had been equally amazed by the blazing of the Italian lady's magnanimity, and had been tempted to make her the principal heroine (Carroll, pp. 194-195), while the claim that Clementina's noblest actions were the product of her insanity was an idea suggested recently by Lady Bradshaigh (see later). Harriet had no reason to believe that Sir Charles loved her on his return to Italy, in spite of Richardson's attempts to suggest that he did in the sixth and seventh volumes. The parallel Harriet drew (III, Letter 23) does not make the points he says it does. And finally, the argument of incompatible religions and countries is only stressed late in the story. So long as Clementina ran mad in romantic Italy, and Harriet pined passively in the cedar parlour, there could be no question about who was the more attractive. But in the seventh volume Richardson cunningly brought the two women face to face on Harriet's own territory, Clementina lowered in her own eyes by her flight, and Harriet exalted by her generosity. No chances are missed: I was raised. It was making me great, my dear Ladies, to have it in my power , as I may say, to convince Sir Charles Grandison, that my compassion, my love, my admiration of the noblest of women, was a sincere admiration and love. . . . What, my dear Ladies, was there of Peculiarity in my generosity, as your brother was pleased to call it? (pp. 105-106, F5). After their confrontation, both Clementina's father and her brother Jeronymo can pointedly prefer Harriet (p. 182, I7 v ; p. 284, N10 v ). Clementina's flight to England was probably not an insertion in proof, but the establishment of Harriet's primacy may well have been. Third, the guarantee that Sir Charles would love her best in the future, which came from Mrs Chapone. The "fine conceal'd moral or Doctrine" she guessed on 10 December 1753 to be that the fluctuations in even the best man's heart would be allayed by "the Sacred Tye of Marriage" (Carroll, p. 265, n. 90). This phrase Richardson used first to answer Sophia Wescomb's idea that fancy could affect her after marriage (the "sacred engagement of marriage forbids it to be her tormentor", says Mrs Shirley, Letter 42, K4 r -K9 r ), and again for the protection of Harriet, on the first page of the last sheet of text (p. 290, O1 v ): [Harriet] was prepared to expect that he would recognize, in the face of the sun, obligations that he had entered into at the altar: And both knew, that he was a good man; and that a good man cannot allow himself either to palliate or temporize with a duty, whether it regarded friendship, or a still closer and more sacred union. Sir Charles's integrity and his marriage vows would thus keep him from straying—reasons that scarcely endear him to a romantic reader. Sir Charles's divided heart was scrutinised by Lady Bradshaigh even at a verbal level on 27 November 1753 (FC XI, ff. 41-48): Sir Charles had praised Clementina in superlatives which excluded Harriet, "The best , the noblest , the most amiable". Richardson tried to put her off (Carroll, p. 254), but she persisted that Harriet had been preferred for her frankness above all women " but one " (VI, Letter 8), while Clementina was always unique (FC XI, ff. 54-57). Richardson explained uncomfortably (Carroll, pp. 265-266) that Sir Charles could not make an exception of an English lady of whom Clementina had never heard, making Lady Bradshaigh come out firmly that "if a little of the Strength of those Expressions had been soften'd, S r Charles's Character wou'd not have appear'd the worse for it" (FC XI, ff. 62-65). Richardson defensively returned on 14 February 1754 that to praise equally would be to suggest a divided heart. To make "cool Reserves" in his admiration of Clementina would have shown him to be weak—but he admitted that to have a good man reward merit where he found it was a delicate situation, even uncommon (Carroll, p. 283). In the light of Richardson's unhappiness, it is at least interesting to hear Sir Charles remark in the last volume, almost casually, that he is the happy husband of "the best and most generous of women" (p. 108, F6 v ), or to watch him being exceptionally cautious about his comparisons between the two rival Queens (pp. 124-125, G2 v -G3 r ): "My Harriet is another Clementina! You are another Harriet! Sister -excellencies I have called you to her, to all her relations. . . . My admiration of her greatness of mind, so similar to that of my own Harriet. . . ." Most important of all, Richardson at least twice makes the ultimate decision about his suffixes: "this dearest and most generous of women", Sir Charles calls Harriet (p. 76, E2 v ), and "the noblest of all women" confirms the Marquis (p. 182, I7 v ). I hope Lady Bradshaigh was pleased. For the lowering of Clementina, Lady Bradshaigh sent a particularly inspired suggestion on 27 November 1753 (FC XI, ff. 41-48). The Italian lady, she wrote, was "certainly well-inclined, her mind is great , but does it not appear chiefly in her narrow zeal. her Enthusiasm ?" Richardson seems quickly to have seized on the idea that religious mania, not natural elevation of character, was the cause of Clementina's best actions, for he made Harriet remark, "But could the noble Lady have thus acted . . . had not she been stimulated by that glorious Enthusiasm, of which her disturbed imagination has shewn some previous tokens; and which, rightly directed, has heretofore given the palm of martyrdom to Saints?" (p. 136, G8 v ). Similar comments appear later (p. 195, K2 r ; p. 242, M1 v ). By implication, a Clementina cured would be incapable of greatness, undeserving of public popularity. Sir Charles's heart must not be divided, argued Lady Bradshaigh in the same letter, because he had said his " whole heart " must be given to the woman he married. Richardson rebuked her for selfishness (Carroll, p. 252), but when she stood firm against "deviding the Conjugal , the tender love of two hearts, united by one Soul " (FC XI, ff. 62-65), a generous apology came by return post (8 February 1754): "Surely I am a very coarse Jester. I would enlarge upon this Subject (of the Preference due to Harriet as the Wife of Sir Charles) But I should ill express myself, if I did, were I not to transcribe your very words on this Subject for near two Pages together" (FC XI, ff. 66-68). With his late conversion in mind, several passages in the seventh volume are striking. When Clementina comes to England, Sir Charles hastens to assure Harriet, the "absolute mistress" of his heart, of "the continuance of my tenderest Love . . . my unalterable, my inviolable Love to you. . . . I will not leave a doubt upon the mind of any one of [our friends], that my Harriet is not, as far as it is in my power to make her, the happiest of women" (pp. 104-105, F4 v -F5 r ). Whose friends, Sir Charles's or Richardson's? Indeed, Sir Charles almost protests too much (pp. 81, 108, 114, for example). When Harriet says that to enter on his hand would be to insult Clementina, Sir Charles quickly rebukes her: "My dearest Life! forget not your own dignity . . . nor give me too much consequence with [the] Lady. . . . I glory in my wife: I cannot desert myself" (p. 139, H10 r ). Harriet's near-miscarriage provides her with a splendid opportunity to gloss his feelings (p. 238), and on the very last sheet of text, she demands congratulations for his "inviolable affection": So peculiarly circumstanced as he was, how unaffectedly noble has been his behaviour to his Wife, and to his Friend, in the presence of both! How often . . . have I silently wished him to abate of his outward tenderness to me, before her, tho' such as became the purest mind.—Nothing but the conscious integrity of his own heart, above disguises or concealments, as his ever was, could thus gloriously have carried him thro' situations so delicate (pp. 289-290, O1 r -O1 v ). "And this blessing [Sir Charles], this joy, your Harriet can call more peculiarly her own!" she cries triumphantly in the penultimate paragraph of the book (p. 299, O6 r ). Surely she must be reassuring Lady Bradshaigh as well as herself. One final point concerning the double love. Lady Bradshaigh, on 27 November 1753 (FC XI, ff. 41-48), would not allow Clementina "one bit of his heart, but what he can bestow in Compassion , gratitude , friendship , Esteem , and the like". These sentiments are carefully copied into the seventh volume (pp. 36, 81); Harriet observes that "The tender friend in her, the beloved wife , were with the nicest propriety, distinguished by him" (p. 256, M8 v ), and approves the plan for a "little temple" commemorating their triple friendship (p. 288, N12 v ). Lady Bradshaigh's vocabulary is most elaborately used, though, in the passage about the Wife and Friend, near the end of the book: He had, from the first, avowed his friendly, his compassionating Love, as well as Admiration, of this noble Lady: That generous avowal prepared his Harriet to expect , that he should behave with tenderness to her. . . . Sir Charles assures me, that he left the dear Sister of my heart not unhappy. . . . He took leave of her with tenderness worthy of his friendship for her; a tenderness that the Brave and the Good ever shew to those who are deserving of their Love (pp. 290-293). Thus the letters of Lady Bradshaigh and others seem to have influenced the defining of Sir Charles's separate affections for the two heroines. Another contention which may have led to revision concerned Clementina's future. Lady Bradshaigh rejected all suggestions: taking the veil, death, a single life affectionately linked to Sir Charles. Instead, she proposed that, since only Clementina's perverseness, the product of her malady, prevented her from marrying the Count of Belvedere, it should be removed by persuasion and the cessation of opposition. She would be helped towards matrimony by absence from Sir Charles, by his example in marrying first, by the insignificance of a first love being pointed out, by her gratitude to a worthy object who deserved reward for his adoration, by filial duty, and by the probability that her mind would afterwards settle, to the happiness of all. Every one of these arguments Richardson used in the seventh volume to prepare the reader for Clementina's marriage, although opposition from other quarters ultimately prevented its occurrence within the book. Lady Bradshaigh said sarcastically as late as 5 February 1754 (FC XI, ff. 69-74) that to sequester Clementina from the world in a nunnery would be to "run the hazzard of Making [herself] a useful Member of Society ". These very same points are made in the agreement that Clementina draws up with her parents: Article I is a promise not to withdraw from the world, and Article II provides for her immediate control of her estate, "that she may be enabled to do that extensive good with the produce, that she could not do, were she to renounce the world" (pp. 169-172, I1 r -12 v ). This is repeated several times, most importantly in an episode where Clementina is argued into a final renunciation of the veil (p. 253). Clementina's fortune was to go to the wicked Laurana if she were professed, so that friends who wanted to see Clementina a nun suggested that Laurana should be killed (Carroll, p. 270). Laurana obligingly commits suicide (p. 275), but since by now Clementina has decided against the veil, her deed may simply have been a concession to vengeful readers. Some were "for killing the noble Lady herself" (Carroll, p. 270), but Lady Bradshaigh in her letter of 5 February 1754 would allow nothing tragical: "O—dose that Savage live who wou'd kill Either of [the heroines]. He shou'd not , if I cou'd Come at him" (FC XI, ff. 69-74). Remembering her despair when Clarissa died, Richardson must let Clementina live. Staying single, the third alternative, was attractive, for one of the main issues of the Clarissa debates had been the child's right to a negative. But in the same letter Lady Bradshaigh suggested a dreadful new interpretation of Clementina's intransigeance: . . . for where love has been declar'd , the world wou'd not be so good natur'd, to give wholy to friendship, what realy might be only due to it. It Cannot be a very desirable thing to have it said, such a Lady will never Marry , she is in love with such a one's Husband . This is the plain fact. tho' it might be prettily ornamented , to suit the taste of the Female Quixotts [ The Female Quixote , by Richardson's friend Mrs Charlotte Lennox, had been published in 1751]. The charge of indelicacy was all the more glaring because of an event in the seventh volume still unknown to Lady Bradshaigh, Clementina's flight to England and to Sir Charles. In the first half of the volume Clementina had blamed herself for a lack of filial duty and for rashness, but in important passages from signature L onwards she is suddenly made aware that her motives could be seen as much culpable. The detested Olivia provides the hint—a clever move, since she could be abused with impunity. The "severe reflexions" arrive in a letter (p. 225, L5 r ) that does not appear: Harriet is indignant and Clementina appalled, but the wise Mrs Beaumont makes Lady Bradshaigh's observation that "What Olivia has hinted, the world will hint. It behoves you to consider, that the husband of Lady Grandison ought not to be so much the object of any woman's attention, as to be an obstacle to the address of another man really worthy" (p. 227). Clementina is convinced, and in Letter 49 she too echoes Lady Bradshaigh: [. . . And is Clementina in the house of the man whom she has been known to regard above all men; and whom she still does regard; but not as Olivia supposes?] . . . please God to return me, with reputation, to my native country. My eyes are now opened to the impropriety I have been guilty of in taking refuge . . . with a man I am known to value. The world has begun to talk : Cruel Olivia! she will lead and point the talk, as she would have it believed. . . . At present I hate, I despise myself. With how little reason, my dearest sister, . . . What has Olivia dared to report? But did she ever forbear her rash censures? She complains pointedly that "The world and Olivia will not let me be, in that world, a single woman, and happy". The awareness of her misdemeanour, she says, "flashed full upon me" (p. 248, M4 v )—perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it flashed full upon Richardson. But various excuses are made: Sir Charles ascribes the charge to "ill-will and slander" (p. 249) and Clementina pleads her wounded reason, which "allowed me not to consider, that there were improprieties in my scheme, of which the world would judge otherwise than I did". Olivia's "vile and undeserved reflexions" will be defeated by the true integrity of her heart (p. 254). The vehemence of these repeated expressions, the use of Olivia as a scapegoat, and the defensive attack on the opinion of the world might together suggest some external influence. But when Lady Bradshaigh's letter is included in the evidence, it is virtually certain that here, not in the novel, is to be found the cause of Clementina's awakening. This is particularly important for confirming a date after 5 February for radical revision of the seventh volume before its printing and publication. The single life once made impossible for Clementina by Olivia's "vile reflexions", Richardson attacked spinsterhood as such in a discussion (Letter 42, K4 r -K9 r ) between Mrs Shirley and the young girls. (It may well be a study from the life, from Richardson's own domestic circle at North End.) Although the girls sympathise with Clementina, Mrs Shirley discourses on the lonely life of a single and unconnected woman, adding uncharacteristically spiteful touches to Nancy's malicious picture of "a single woman in years". Mrs Selby defends women single through no choice of their own, but the debate opts decisively for prudential marriages and against romantic notions of love that keep one unmarried. By the luckiest chance, Charlotte has consulted Lady Gertrude, an exemplary spinster who has not, however, written before: "I will fairly own", writes the Sage, "that I think a woman is most likely to find her proper happiness in the married state". But she does reopen some options for Clementina, saying that a fortune by which one might act beneficently, many connexions, or extreme unsuitability make refusal a virtue (pp. 218-219). The existence of a prior love was, however, a powerful argument against Clementina's marriage, so that Richardson welcomed Mrs Chapone's attack, sent 10 December 1753 (FC XIII, 1, ff. 94-97), on the romantic notion "that it is some degree of unchastity, or however want of Delicacy should they Enter into Covenant with any, Except that very individual, whom they think they could prefer to all the World besides". Richardson, approving, praised Mrs Chapone on 29 December for not allowing her childhood reading to affect her as an adult (Carroll, p. 265). This exchange appears to have close connections with the love debate just mentioned, for Mrs Shirley's argument is against "romantic" ideas of love, by which she means specific romances read by young women, like the Princess of Cleves , and La Calprènede's Cassandra (she mentions the hero, Oroondates, p. 204). She denies that Harriet would have remained faithful to her "first-sight impressions", just as Charlotte, in Letter 43, also believes that Harriet would have married "before my Brother and Clementina had seen the face of their second boy". She, who once loved a Captain Anderson, can pour ridicule upon the notion of an ineradicable first love, and she is not denied her request to "enumerate a few chances that may render a first Love impracticable". In other words, Clementina need feel no shame in deserting the man she first loved, and in turning to another. Still ignorant that Clementina had thrown herself into temptation by renewed propinquity with Sir Charles, Lady Bradshaigh had suggested on 5 February 1754 that Clementina would be helped by an absence from him of "one, two, or three years" (FC XI, ff. 69-74). It is therefore not surprising to find Clementina glancing at Emily's example of flight from temptation, and immediately after the "calumny" longing to be in her own country again (p. 226 onwards). Within the month, the Porrettas are gone. Their invitation to the English circle to visit Italy is accepted for a year away. But in his Letter to a Lady , printed by Richardson on 15 March 1754 to answer numerous requests to know what happened to the characters after the book ended (see Appendix of O.E.N. edition), Richardson would use Harriet's pregnancy as an excuse to prolong the period of separation, until the child was "at least a year old". It seems likely that Richardson adopted Lady Bradshaigh's idea to remove Clementina from Sir Charles, as well as her notion of a helpful lapse in time. So much for the disentangling of Clementina from Sir Charles. The next step, that of getting her married to the Count of Belvedere, was not so simple. Opposition was strong: Mrs Donnellan had as long ago as November 1752 begged him not to "marry the angel Clementina to the hair-brained Count de Belvidere . . . let not the sweet enthusiast . . . sink into a common woman" (Barbauld IV, 78). John Chapone, son of Mrs Chapone, demanded "Give not an Angel to a mortal man!", declaring roundly that he would rather see her dead (FC XV, 3, ff. 19-22). Richardson had been "very warmly entreated by more than one, two or half a Dozen," he wrote, "that Clementina may not (for the sake of dear Romance) be given to the Count of B.", a number he later enlarged to twenty (Carroll, pp. 270, 290). Miss Mulso and her "Favourites" were among them, and "One Lady assures me, that the Moment she gets the concluding Volume, she will turn to the Fate of Clementina, and if she finds her married, down shall go the Book" (Carroll, p. 272). Given his belief that he must please in order to instruct, Richardson had to heed such vehemence. Already in the sixth volume he had characteristically side-stepped, saying through Sir Charles that the Porrettas were not wrong in urging her to marry, but in "precipitating" her (Letter 54). Moderating the speed of the compulsion scarcely affected the fact of the compulsion, but it was a line that Richardson would cling to. He explained the advantages of gradual persuasion towards marriage to Lady Bradshaigh on 14 February 1754 (Carroll, pp. 290-291): he could show indulgence combined with parental authority, "without making it necessary to call in an Harlowe violence to oppose their child's inclinations"; he could disappoint Laurana's expectations; the "hasty temper" of the General could be dismissed; the physician had hopes that her malady, being not hereditary, would be cured by marriage; the family's desire to see her united with the worthy Count and cured of her "rambling notions" would be answered; and the Count himself deserved some merit for his perseverance "notwithstanding Some of my Girls will not allow it any". "But", he concluded flatteringly ". . . your judg t . is worth more than that of 20 girls, who too generally are prepossessed with notions of ideal Love, that never can be carried into Practice". These arguments are curious because they only have weight within the last volume. At this last moment, the Porretta family is considerably improved, not to appear Harlowesque. Lady Bradshaigh had made the danger clear on 27 November, 1753, when she said that she hated them all, except the Marchioness and Jeronymo (FC XI, ff. 41-48): certainly they were not acting in Clementina's best interests when they threatened her, and let Laurana, her next inheritor, put her in a strait waistcoat. But in the last volume, even the blustering General is the most affectionate of brothers, and Father Marescotti, whose sectarian threats had turned her brain, becomes an amiably innocuous latitudinarian. So radical is the alteration to her family that poor Clementina can only conclude that previously she must have seen her relatives through the eyes of insanity (p. 281, N9 r ). The hopes for Clementina's cure likewise only appear in the last volume, and the Count of Belvedere assumes neither prominence nor value until this late stage. There is no need to disappoint Laurana's expectations, since in the last volume she is killed off. No wonder that Richardson was anxious to know if "these Considerations, and others that may be drawn from the Story, are . . . sufficient to render natural the Precipitating Spirit of Clementina's parents" (Carroll, p. 291). The marriage does not in fact take place; instead, time is allowed Clementina to reflect and to choose. With typical obliquity, though, Richardson propels events towards a near-commitment by Clementina, using methods proposed by Lady Bradshaigh. For instance, she had said that Clementina was both spoilt and perverse (FC XI, ff. 41-48), a description endorsed by Charlotte and by her brother Giacomo (pp. 215, 275). She was, after all, mad, said Lady Bradshaigh, so that when Clementina accuses herself of irrationality in her flight to England, may she not be mad in everything? Opposition engendered opposition, she argues, and several times in the last volume we are assured that Clementina's resistance will diminish when she is humoured (e.g. p. 215). A tale of a "heroic" girl tricked into marriage by her guardian's pretence to oppose the match (pp. 215-217) points the moral, and with all trace of Harlowe erased from the Porretta features, Clementina has no cause to deny the family's wishes, unless her mind is irrationally determined. Lady Bradshaigh on 11 December 1753 (FC XI, ff. 54-57) anticipated "all the approaching, and hoped for happiness of Clementina". The Count of Belvedere would be the man, and from gratitude she would give him her hand "with the remainder of her heart". The way is certainly cleared for Clementina to marry the Count, and one passage in particular discusses gratitude as the motive for marriage. It brings upon itself the suspicion of being a late insertion because it purports to be a recollected quotation from a letter of Lady D. to Harriet: yet no such passage appears in the only letter that Lady D. writes in the book (V, Letter 18). The advice is ostensibly addressed to Harriet, but it applies perfectly to Clementina, being an elaboration of Lady Bradshaigh's hint (p. 219, L2 r ). Gratitude, then, would draw Clementina to the Count, as well as " Time , and assiduities, from a worthy object" approved by everyone, said Lady Bradshaigh on 5 February 1754 (FC XI, ff. 69-74). It is certainly striking to see in the last volume the Count brought forth to play off, as she suggested, "his artillery of adoration , vows , tenderness , love-gentle , love violent , and Every assiduity that is likely to gain her affection". Until now he has been less than a secondary character, but suddenly he is the centre of attention for Harriet, Sir Charles, the Porretta family and their attendants. Praise and pity are showered upon him, he prostrates himself adoringly at his mistress's feet, and Clementina herself has to admit his worth. Final "proofs" of his worthiness appear in his benevolence and utter devotion, so that even Harriet, a previous supporter of Clementina, asks, "Shall I wish the noble Clementina may be prevailed upon in favour of this really worthy man? Should I , do you think, be prevailed upon in her situation?—A better question still— Ought I?" (pp. 239-240). But this question has already been answered by Mrs Shirley, that goddess of wisdom: she cannot agree with the hardship of Clementina's situation, in which she was "from reasons of family convenience, and even of personal happiness, urged to marry a nobleman, who, by all accounts, is highly deserving and agreeable, and every-way suitable to her: A man, in short, to whom she pretended not an aversion" (VII, Letter 42). The Count and Clementina part, but the scene closes with the words of Lady Bradshaigh: Sir Charles makes him promise that he will "make his court to her only by silent assiduities, and by those actions of beneficence and generosity which were so natural to him, and so worthy of his splendid fortune" (p. 294). Two last suggestions remained for the complete happiness of all. First, Lady Bradshaigh wanted to see Clementina restored to "Tranquility" (FC XI, ff. 41-48)—all the more acceptable to Richardson because she had also remarked that Clementina's chief charm lay in her madness. Hopes of a cure appear in the last volume from Mr Lowther, the surgeon, who has fortuitously gained the supporting "opinions of the most noted London physicians" (p. 257, M9 r ). He expresses surprise, as well he may, that Clementina's merely circumstantial insanity had been a cause of her not marrying Sir Charles, and he predicts that marriage will make both her family and herself happy. Sir Charles also anticipates tranquillity and happiness for all (p. 242, M1 v ), and Harriet remarks complacently that "Every thing that can be adjusted, is. . . . How joyfully do we all, in prospect, see a durable tranquillity taking possession of her noble heart! The Marquis and the Marchioness have not one care written on their heretofore visibly anxious brows" (p. 289, O1 r ). Second, Clementina could copy the example of Sir Charles, who, wrote Lady Bradshaigh on 5 February 1754, had "hasten'd to Marry, upon [her] request , and for [her] Satisfaction " (FC XI, ff. 69-74). And so we find Sir Charles coolly informing Harriet in the last volume that the Porrettas' urging him to give the example of marriage to Clementina had been "the occasion . . . of accelerating my declaration to you" (p. 81, E5 r ). The marriage, as I said, does not take place, but everything points to a union at a later date. Attacked on all sides, Richardson wished on 14 February 1754 that he had received sooner Lady Bradshaigh's "reasonings in favour of the Count of Belvedere" (Carroll, p. 291). All that he dared offer in the work are the opinions of the characters: Charlotte thinks she will be married "a year or two hence" (p. 215, K12 r ); and the Bishop has no doubt that Clementina will "now complete her triumph" by acquiescence in filial duty, foreseeing "happy prospects" (p. 284, N10 v ). For the sake of the morality and for Lady Bradshaigh's pleasure, Richardson would have preferred, I think, to marry off Clementina by the end of the book. But his own affection for her, risen upon him beyond the expectation of both Sir Charles and the reader (Carroll, p. 252), the first conception of the character as persecuted which Mrs Delany had offered in 1751 from her own life (Carroll, p. 24), and the certainty that this match would be unpopular, these together forced him to compromise. "Every thing", to echo Harriet, "that can be adjusted, is ", but Richardson's postponement of the decision to a time outside the work must be compared with his steady refusal to compromise on the fate of Clarissa. Lady Bradshaigh, at least, saw after publication of the seventh volume what had been done for her, writing on 22 March 1754, "I Cou'd not have imagined, you Cou'd possibly have done so much in one vol me and am much better satisfied than I expected" (FC XI, ff. 90-95). She had little reason to kick and flounce and be ungovernable when she saw how often Richardson had deferred to her. Samuel Johnson, less naive, saw exactly how Richardson had managed it, observing in him on 28 March 1754 "a trick of laying yourself open to objections, in the first part of your work, and crushing them in subsequent parts. A great deal that I had to say before I read the conversation in the latter part, is now taken from me" ( The Letters of Samuel Johnson , ed. R. W. Chapman, 1952, Letter 51.1). There are two final oddities in the seventh volume, the Concluding Note from the Editor and the "unlucky omission", both of which the surprised reader of the first edition found ahead of him after the story was done. If the fable part of Volume VII was the last chance to forestall criticism, the gloss in the Concluding Note provides a very last chance. In it Richardson discusses three issues: Sir Charles's promise to bring up as Catholics any girls he might have by Clementina; the impossibility of copying anyone so perfect as Sir Charles; and his suspicious facility in duels. All these had been complained of by correspondents, the first by Mrs Donnellan ( Autobiography , III, 1st series, p. 256) and Mrs Chapone (FC XIII, 1, ff. 96-97), the second by Mrs Chapone (ibid.), the third by Lady Bradshaigh (FC XI, ff. 41-48, 54-57) and others (e.g. Dr Will Webster, FC XV, 3, f. 18). For the last issue Lady Bradshaigh had offered a model defence, upon which Richardson based his own argument—including a suggestion that patterns of Christian behaviour were to be found in the sermons of Bishop Tillotson (a quotation from him ends the Note) and a statement that separates out the private and questionable aspects of Sir Charles's behaviour in loving two women at once from the public and imitable. That is, Richardson was answering specific and individual comments in the Concluding Note, and to some extent basing his reply on the letters of his friends. At least this response was honestly declared, even if still behind the "umbrage of the editor's character", as he once put it (Carroll, p. 42), but the "unlucky omission" is, I think, entirely fraudulent. It purports to be a piece of text mistakenly left out, and thus of necessity slipped between the hundred-page Index and the Address to the Public (itself a bitter charge of fraud hurled at the pirates). In the first place, it is unlikely that Richardson's able and accurate men would have overlooked a page and a half of manuscript, and in any case the last sentence has had to be altered to weave it into the context: "His new-taken house in Grosvenor-square . . ." becomes "Whither have I rambled! I was going to tell you, that if this Italian family comes over, his newtaken house, &amp;c." Second, it corresponds too closely to two letters, one of 11 December 1753 from Lady Bradshaigh and another received from an anonymous writer on about 26 December 1753 (FC XI, ff. 54-57; XV, 3, f. 32), to be part of the original manuscript. Lady Bradshaigh had begged "pray Sir let S r Cha s declare, that Har t is indisputably the more desireable woman, for a wife to an English man , and a protestant". In the "omission" we find Lucy Selby asking, "How could Sir Charles, so thorough an Englishman, have been happy with an Italian wife?" And she "recollects nearly his Words" (a suspicious circumstance itself, in a work written "to the moment") strongly defending his patriotic and protestant principles. The terrified anonymous, as Richardson called him in his own index to the correspondence, had similar chauvinist fears, and just how seriously Richardson took this criticism may be seen by his careful answering in the "omission" of attacks made on Sir Charles's disloyalty, dangerous fondness for papists, and preference for foreign goods and services: His heart indeed, is, generously open and benevolent to people of all countries: He is, as I have often heard you say, in the noblest sense, a Citizen of the World: But, see we not, that his long residence abroad, has only the more endeared to him the Religion, the Government, the Manners of England? You know, that on a double Principle of Religion and Policy, he encourages the Trades-people, the Manufactures, the Servants, of his own Country. Do I not remember a charmingly lively debate between you [Lady G.] and him, on the subject of those Elegancies in Dress and Appearance which you said (and I thought you naughty for saying it) were only to be acquired by employing the better taste of Foreigners? He concluded it seriously. I recollect nearly his Words: "The Error, Lady G. is growing too general, is authorized by too many Persons of figure, not to make one afraid of fatal consequences, from what in its beginning seemed a trifle. Shall any one pretend to true Patriotism, and not attempt to stem this torrent of fashion, which impoverishes our own honest Countrymen, while it carries Wealth and Power to those whose National Religion and Interest are directly opposite to ours!" Good Heaven, thought I, at the time, how was this noble-minded man entangled by delicacies of situation, by friendship, by compassion, that he should ever have been likely to be engaged in a family of Roman Catholics, and lived half of his days out of his beloved Country! And the other half to have set, as to the world's eye, such an Example in it! Poor Lady G., always the scapegoat. But Richardson's little deceit has serious consequences, for the principal advantage of the epistolary method is its immediacy, and to have Lucy "remember" and "recollect nearly his Words" undermines the consistency and realism of the whole. This study has been then an account of the peculiar way that one volume of Richardson's work came to be as it is, an unravelling, so far as is possible, of just "how much advantage, in my proud heart, is given me, of peeping into the hearts of my readers, and sometimes into their heads, by their approbation, and disapprobation, of the conduct of the different persons in my Drama" (Carroll, p. 289). It also tells us much about the man's habits of mind, his readiness to compromise small aesthetic points for the sake of a larger moral whole. And it reveals his hopes for an absolute communication with his readers: Fielding's similar concern for the "corrupting and corruptible" word (Glen W. Hatfield, Henry Fielding and the Language of Irony , 1968, p. 4) was itself part of a contemporary desire to link purity of meaning and purity of morals. There are two further implications to be drawn. Richardson wrote at a time critical for the transference of literary patronage from a small group to a vast and amorphous reading public, of which "nine parts in ten" were in hanging-sleeves, that is, young (Carroll, p. 42). He wanted to reach the masses, using the forms of popular prose to attract them, but despaired at the same time of his "Accommodation" to a wicked world (Carroll, p. 117). Longing to be considered a serious writer, he sought the approbation of reasonable people, the educated élite who could recognise the loveliness of truth naked, and agree with him about it. By energetically sending proofs or complimentary copies to friends and literary figures he tried to enlist a community of understanding worthies for his book, but even they saw different draperies. It is an illuminating contrast to recall that Fielding, grateful recipient of "princely benefactions" from the Duke of Bedford and the Hon. George Lyttleton, read aloud from the manuscript of Tom Jones a few weeks before it was published to just such a group of reasonable men as Richardson yearned for, the elder Pitt, Lyttleton and George Fielding, at the house of an educated squire, Sanderson Miller. Ralph Allen, Fielding's frequent host at Prior Park during the composition of Tom Jones , must have been similarly favoured (Wilbur L. Cross, The History of Henry Fielding , 1963, II, 112-113). He asked for comment on the final revision, but there seems to have been no disagreement, only the warm commendation he speaks of in the Preface. Such happy uniformity of response was not granted to Richardson. A man of independent means, he neither sought nor received patronage of the old financial kind (Eaves and Kimpel, pp. 35-36; Carroll, pp. 174-175). But he would dearly have loved approbation of the civil kind offered to Fielding, and was deeply hurt when his new patrons, the voluble, fickle, opinionated readers, did not behave as the old would have done. Both he and his creation, Grandison , were affected by the change. The second point is shown by the shift in sense of "sentimental". It may be precisely dated, because Lady Bradshaigh asked Richardson in 1749, just when he was embarking on Grandison , "What, in your opinion, is the meaning of the word sentimental , so much in vogue among the polite. . . ." (Barbauld, IV, 282; in OED as the first example of the usage). Richardson had built his work around a "sentimental design", that is, around a set of maxims, cautions and sententiae animated by particulars. The construction of Grandison was thus originally intellectual, a work of reason. But Richardson's wayward readers chose to relish for their own sakes the very particulars, those "Nugatories of Girls and Boys" (Carroll, p. 195), that he used as a means to the end of communicating general truths, and in so doing, agitated themselves in a manner that would rapidly be known as sentimental in its new sense. Instead of the intuitive head corroborating and controlling the passions of the heart, rule passed, with this change in meaning, to the blind, unreasoning heart. With the semantic change from the old to the new, with the alteration of literary patronage from an élite to the masses, Richardson's distressed and distressing compromises in Volume VII of Grandison became inevitable.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Whitney's A Choice of Emblemes Revisited: A Comparative Study of the Manuscript and the Printed Versions by Mason Tung</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first facsimile reprint of Whitney's emblem-book was edited in 1866 by Henry Green, who as one of the founders of the Holbein Society pioneered the modern study of emblem literature. 1 Continuing his interest in reviving the study of Renaissance iconography, Green edited, between 1868 and 1872, many reprints ranging from Hans Holbein the Younger's Icones Historiarum Veteris Testamenti and Les Simulacres de la Mort (1869), to Henry Godyere's The Mirrour of Majestie (1870), and to the principal early editions of Alciati's Emblemata . Except in his last work, Andrea Alciati and His Books of Emblems (1872), nowhere did Green lavish as much effort as in the reprint of Whitney. In addition to the "Introductory Dissertation," "Index to the Mottoes," and "Postscript to the Introductory Dissertation," which traces the ancestry of Whitney, Green appended four "Literary and Bibliographical" essays, close to one hundred pages of "Notes" and "Addenda" as well as sixty-three plates, most of them title-pages and selected emblems from early emblem-books. Yet more recent scholars of emblem literature have paid only passing attention to Green's edition as a whole. Rosemary Freeman notes briefly that "H. Green in his edition of Whitney's A Choice of Emblemes . 1866. p. 252. has shown that 202 out of 248 woodcuts were printed from identical blocks." 2 In Studies in Seventeenth-Century Imagery , Mario Praz also notes tersely: "Edited in facsimile by Green for the Holbein Society, 1866, with a survey of the first emblem-writers, and various observations on sources, etc.; all with little method and less accuracy." 3 It is with Green's study of Whitney's sources that the other recent treatises on Choice have concerned themselves. John Franklin Leisher, in his 1952 Harvard dissertation, "Geoffrey Whitney's Choice of Emblemes and Its Relation to the Emblematic Vogue in Tudor England," corrects several of Green's oversights, discovers a new source in Georgette de Montenay's Les Emblèmes ou devises chrestiennes (1571), and eliminates all of Green's "similar" sources as irrelevant. In her 1964 Saint Louis University dissertation, Sister M. Simon Nolde reaches conclusions similar to those of Leisher, even though working apparently without knowledge of the latter's study. 4 Perhaps the first person ever to study the manuscript original of Choice (the presentation copy to the Earl of Leicester now in the Harvard College Library, designated, and hereinafter referred to, as MS. Typ 14), Leisher unfortunately made only perfunctory use of it. MS. Typ 14 is more fully described by Frank Fieler in his introduction to the 1967 reissue of Green's edition published by Benjamin Blom. 5 The general nature of this introduction, however, precludes any detailed treatment of the similarities and differences between the MS and the printed edition and the drawing of meaningful conclusions as to the process of converting from one to the other. The story of how Whitney produced the printed edition of Choice from the MS remains to be told. 6 Moreover, in view of the fact that the two recent revisions of Green's attribution of sources both appear in unpublished theses, a few readers still regard Green's edition as the sole authority and do not hesitate to rely on his findings, inaccurate though some of them have been proved to be. 7 There is a need, therefore, for a fresh study of Whitney's A Choice of Emblemes , in light especially of its manuscript, and of those aspects that have been neglected both by Green and by recent studies of Choice . This need is all the more urgent now that Whitney's emblem-book is rapidly becoming more available because both Choice itself and Green's edition of it have been reproduced by many enterprising reprint presses. For example, in 1969, just two years after the reissue of Green's edition by Blom, Choice was reprinted by the Scolar Press of Menston, England, as No. 3 of its English Emblem Books series with a note by John Horden, as well as by Amsterdam's Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (distributed in New York by Da Capo Press) as No. 161 of its English Experience series; and in 1971, Green's edition was again reprinted by Olms of Hildesheim, Germany (distributed in New York by Adler's Foreign Books). Although most of the biographical and bibliographical details in Green's edition remain useful, his neglect of Whitney's woodcuts, verses, annotations, and "newly devised" emblems must be remedied, and his treatment of Whitney's sources and mottoes reviewed and revised. The purpose of this essay, then, is to provide a more accurate and comprehensive study of Whitney's A Choice of Emblemes . It will concern itself with these areas: 1. source, 2. motto, 3. woodcut, 4. verse, 5. annotation, and 6. "newly devised" emblems. In each area the manuscript version will be compared with the printed version in order to disclose the process by which one is converted into the other, assuming of course that MS. Typ 14 was, if not the copy, at least the basis for the copy, of the printed edition. Comparison of the two versions will also reveal the number of emblem-books that were available to Whitney during the composition of the manuscript in England and the number of new sources he used in producing the printed version at Leyden. Of especial interest are those twenty emblems in the MS that have no known emblematic sources; ten of them were copied and made into woodcuts at Leyden by an artist/engraver who, under Whitney's instruction, added five more such emblems. A study of these fifteen "newly devised" emblems along with an examination of the other five areas will go far toward rescuing Whitney from the common modern estimate of him as merely an emblem-collector/translator of little originality and discovering him to be an emblem-writer of considerable ingenuity and skill. Above all, such a study will provide a more enlightening background for relating Whitney's emblem-making to poetic imagery of such English authors as Spenser, Shakespeare, Daniel, Chapman, and Donne. Before proceeding with the six areas of concern, it would be helpful to give some general ideas concerning the composition of both MS. Typ 14 and Choice , together with a brief account of the circumstances under which the latter was printed. Bound in sixteenth-century vellum, MS. Typ 14 contains 98 folios, written on both sides of each leaf. Presented to the Earl of Leicester on 28 November 1585 (according to the date in the printed version of the "Epistle Dedicatorie" since the MS epistle is undated), it is decorated with 197 emblematic drawings in pen-and-ink, sepia, and blue water-color. Offered for sale in December 1899 in Quaritch Catalog 194, No. 1395, and bought by William Augustus White on 2 January 1900, it was presented to the Harvard College Library in 1941 by Harold T. White and Mrs. Hugh D. Marshall. 8 It has two parts. The first part, written in ink now turned brown, begins on fol. 1 v with the arms of the Earl of Leicester and continues with the epistle dedicatory (fols. 2-5), the dedication to Jove (fol. 6 v ), and 91 drawings (fols. 7-50). The second part, written in violet ink, follows a blank page (fol. 50 v ) and has a half-title which has in the middle the Leicester crest of a muzzled bear chained to a ragged post surrounded by a knotted belt with the famous motto, "Honi soit qui mal y pense," and a six-line Latin quotation from Nicolas Reusner. Following this half-title are verses in praise of Leicester and his brother Warwick (fols. 51 v -52) and 106 drawings (fols. 52 v -98 v ). There is a missing leaf in the MS between fols. 43 v and 44. On fol. 43 v is a drawing with the motto "Quicquid delirant reges, plectunt r Achiui" and a stanza of ten iambic pentameter lines which correspond to the emblem "Non dolo, sed vi" on p. 58 of Choice . On the first half of fol. 44, instead of the beginning of the next emblem with its motto and woodcut, are the last two sextets of the missing emblem "Silentium" which in the printed edition appears on p. 60. The woodcut of "Silentium" pictures Harpocrates holding an index finger over his mouth while reading a book at his desk; it is supported by a seven-sextet verse, the first half of which appears on the same page with the woodcut. The remaining three and one half sextets continue on the next page, p. 61; separated from these verses by a horizontal bar of a decorative border, the alternate emblem, without woodcut, entitled "Video, &amp; taceo" in eight lines of poulter's measure fills out the rest of this page. Correspondingly, the identical alternate emblem also fills out the second half of fol. 44. The missing leaf should then contain on its recto the emblem "Nimium rebus ne fide secundis" identical to that on p. 59 of Choice and on its verso the motto "Silentium," a drawing corresponding to the woodcut on p. 60 of Choice , and a verse of five sextets that is continued by the two sextets on fol. 44. 9 The MS measures 270 x 190 mm. (10 ¾ x 7 ½”). The drawings in the first twenty folios are enclosed in heavily lined (the rest in thin-lined) rectangular frames. The dimensions of the drawings vary, depending on whether they appear alone on a leaf, fill out half a leaf, or share a leaf with another drawing. The single drawing on a leaf measures 64 x 86 mm. (2 ½ x 3 ⅜”); the double drawings on a single leaf 44 x 80 mm. (1 ¾ x 3 ⅛”); drawings used to fill out the lower half of a leaf sometimes measure 58 x 83 mm. (2 ¼ x 3 ¼”). The changes in size between a model and an MS drawing, and between the latter and the woodcut in Choice , tax the ability of the copying artists and sometimes produce interesting results (see Section 3 below). These changes also reflect the progressive differences among designs of the model, the MS, and the printed version. Just ten days after he received the manuscript of Choice from Whitney, Leicester went to the Low Countries on 8 December 1585 as the Queen's Lord Lieutenant and Captain General of the English forces to help the Dutch States General against Spain. Whitney followed him there shortly as a supernumerary in the party of Janus Dousa, one of the ambassadors sent to England after the fall of Antwerp in August by the States General to seek Elizabeth's intervention. At the beginning of the new year (1586), the Dousas, father and son (to each of whom Whitney dedicated an emblem, and the younger Dousa also wrote the first commendatory verse, in Choice ), along with Whitney were at the University of Leyden, where the senior Dousa was the rector and where on 11 January the Earl of Leicester was entertained as the honored guest. Leicester stayed in Leyden until the twentieth. It is not inconceivable that it was on this occasion that Whitney was persuaded to publish his collection of emblems from the MS, as he said that he was ". . . earnestlie required by somme that perused the same, to haue it imprinted. . ." ("To the Reader," sig. **3 v ). "By somme" might very well refer to the Dousas, who had taken a great personal interest in Whitney and his talents. 10 Perhaps to facilitate his task Whitney was matriculated at the university on 1 March 1586 and lived close to both the university and the Plantin printing shop, whose printer Francis Raphelengius later became professor of Hebrew at Leyden. Whether or not the printing of Choice by Raphelengius was also motivated politically to popularize Leicester's name so as to enable him to assume sovereign power in the Low Countries, as has been suggested by Fieler (p. xiii), may not be as relevant to our purposes here as the fact that Whitney had less than three months in which to publish the book—in which to select from the Plantin stock over 200 woodblocks, instruct an artist/engraver to copy 35 additional emblems and to devise five new ones, compose or translate verses for at least 62 emblems that were not in the MS, and to add a large amount of marginalia. The text of the verses in the printed edition shows signs of haste in the many punctuation and spelling errors by an illiterate compositor. Although Whitney caught nine of the "Faultes escaped in the Printing" (sig. ***2 v ), and although he mentioned that he had already corrected most of the faults, there are legions of others—particularly the overuse of commas and the atrocious use of the question marks. Yet, on the whole, the printed Choice , completed on 4 May 1586, is comparable in execution and attractiveness to the best of the continental emblem-books of the period. A Choice of Emblemes follows the two-part division of the MS, but with the addition of the epistle "To the Reader" (sigs. **3 v -**4 v ), seven commendatory verses (sigs. ***1-***2), the errata already mentioned and on the same page the same verse dedicated in the MS to Jove now addressed to D.O.M. (Deo, Optimo, Maximo). Part one has 113 emblems, one of them, on p. 61, as has been mentioned above, is a "naked" emblem, an emblem without woodcut, and one of them, on p. 95, is a "newly devised" emblem. Of the emblems in this part, 17 contain no marginalia; 31 are dedicated to Whitney's acquaintances. Part two has 135 emblems; 14 are "newly devised," 31 without annotation, and 60 are dedicated. All emblems in Choice are surrounded by decorative borders; those dual emblems that occupy the same page sometimes have borders only on two sides. The size of woodcuts is more uniform than that of the MS drawings; a vast majority of them measure in a square of 57 mm. (2 ¼”), although those from Sambucus and Junius vary in height from 47 to 51 mm. (1 ⅞ to 2”). The most noticeable exceptions in size are those woodcuts borrowed from Paradin which are unframed and measure as high as 83 mm. (3 ¼”). In changing these vertical rectangular models into his horizontal rectangular drawings, the MS artist produced a number of inferior copies. With this general description of both MS. Typ 14 and Choice , the full story of their conversion is now ready to be unfolded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1. Review of Sources In the "Epistle Dedicatorie" to Leicester, Whitney reveals the nature of his collection: ". . . most humblie presente theise my gatheringes, and gleaninges out of other mens haruestes, vnto your honour. . . ." The printed title-page also announces that Choice is "For the most parte gathered out of sundrie writers." The extent of his acknowledged sources may be deduced from his references to them in the letter "To the Reader" and from his annotations in both the MS and Choice . Apologizing for having dedicated his emblems to his friends, he cites the practices of Reusner, Junius, and Sambucus; and in referring his readers to further discussion on the meaning of the word emblem , he lists those by "And. Alciatus, Guiliel. Perrerius [i.e., La Perrière], Achilles Bocchius" (sigs. **2 v -**3). Annotations on some of his sources further show his use of Alciati's Emblemata , especially the Plantin editions (after 1573) with copious commentaries by Claude Mignault (or Minos), Barthélemy Aneau's (or Anulus') Picta Poesis , and Gabriel Faernus' Fabulae Centum . With these clues as to Whitney's possible sources, and anxious to show Whitney's familiarity with as many contemporary emblem-books as possible, Green establishes three categories of emblem according to their sources; those untraced which he classifies as Whitney's "original" or "newly devised"; those identical to their sources because they were struck off from the same woodblocks used in printing their source emblem-books; and those similar to and suggested by their sources. To quote from his summaries: "Thus the devices in Whitney , which are similar to those of other emblem writers of his own era, and which might be suggested by them, are 103—to be thus distributed: to Brant, 7; Perrière, 13; Corrozet, 11; Horapollo, 9; Aneau, 12; Coustau, 8; Giovio and Symeoni, 13; Freitag, 13; Beza, 4; and Reusner, 13. Probably, however, he did not borrow from these sources above 23 emblems"; and "Now, ascertaining the results of inquiry after the devices in Whitney , struck off from the same wood-blocks, and therefore identical with those of other emblem writers, we count up—for Alciat 86 instances, Paradin 32, Sambucus 48, Junius 20, and Faerni 16; in all, 202. In Whitney's work there are 248 devices [i.e., emblems], and we have accounted for the whole; 23 were original, 23 suggested, and 202 are identical with those of the five emblematists last named. Thus in 'The Choice of Emblemes' 225 have been 'gathered out of sundrie writers,' and 23 is the number of the 'divers newly devised.'" 11 Green's method generates two types of confusion. First, in tracing sources of device and motto together, Green identified one source for the motto of an emblem, though without so specifying, and explained in the notes that for device (i.e., wooduct) another source was used. 12 Secondly, in distinguishing the 23 "suggested" sources from the 80 merely "similar" by italicizing the emblem descriptions of the former group, Green neglected to italicize five descriptions so that only 18 were "suggested." Moreover, after going through the separate lists and 103 emblems, a reader then is told that Whitney did not use them as models except in 23 instances; he feels cheated and frustrated. In reviewing Green's source attributions, Leisher rightly criticizes the artificial distinction between "similar" and "suggested." "It should be noted," he writes, "that the other source-books listed by Green—Brant, Corrozet, Horapollo, Coustau, Giovio, Freitag, Beza, and Reusner—do not, despite careful study, yield a single design which can for any reason be considered a source-device" (p. 394). He goes too far, however, in combining the "suggested" with the "identical" into a single "actual source" category. For him the emblems in Choice have either "actual" or "untraced" sources. This failure to recognize the 25 emblems that are "copied" and "recopied" from other emblem-books causes Leisher to be inconsistent. Those emblems from Aneau that are copied by Whitney's artists, regardless of the minor differences in design, are listed under the "actual" category, whereas the two emblems copied from La Perrière and Montenay admittedly with greater differences in design are put under the "untraced" category. For instance, in the text of his dissertation he lists Whitney's emblem on p. 225 as having an actual source in Montenay's No. 63. However, in Appendix F, "The Sources of the Devices," he omits it from the list under Montenay, adds it instead to the "untraced" list, and at the same time notes parenthetically that it may be modeled in part on Montenay's No. 12. Similarly, assigning Whitney's emblem on p. 108 to the "untraced" list, he notes in parentheses that it may be based on La Perrière's first emblem (p. 393, n. 18; cf. pp. 506, 508). The truth of the matter is that both were copied from their respective sources with considerable modifications, so much so, especially of Whitney's emblem on p. 225, that it should properly be considered as a "newly devised," having been modeled partially on more than two emblems from Montenay (see Section 6 below). The only other serious lapse in Leisher's revision is in identifying Whitney's emblem on p. 62 as from Alciati's No. XXIV and Whitney's emblem on p. 133 as from Alciati's No. CLIX. These pairings are incorrect because Leisher followed the woodcuts alone and paid no attention to the mottoes and the verses. He had based his comparison on the 1577 Plantin edition of Alciati's Emblemata , without noticing that the woodcuts for these two emblems were switched in printing by mistake (Figs. 1 &amp; 2). The correct pairings should be: Whitney, p. 62, "Withered elm and fruitful vine" with Alciati's No. CLIX, "Amicitia, etiam post mortem durans," and Whitney, p. 133, "The vine and the olive" with Alciati, No. XXIV, "Prudentes vino abstinent." The MS artist and Green were both misled by the same printing error; however, Whitney made the right switching in Choice . (More on this in Section 3 below.) To date, the tabulation of sources has always been made in separate lists according to emblem-writers, not infrequently resulting in inconsistencies, as in the case of Leisher's tables, and discrepancies as in the case of Green's more than fifteen lists. As a remedy a master list of the sources for the emblems with their mottoes is constructed here as Appendix II. (Henceforth references to Whitney's emblems and to those of his sources will follow the format as explained in the headnotes to that appendix.) At a glance, the preponderance of emblems whose woodcuts are identical to those of their sources can now be better appreciated. Even more significant are those "copied" from their sources and those "newly devised"; for despite their small number, 40 in all, they are more revealing of Whitney's method of collecting and devising emblems. But because of the inaccuracies in the previous source attributions, their exact number cannot until now be established. Green's misattributions may first be summarized: Wh Source Assigned by Green Revised Source 1 Par 72 Jun (14) 31 Newly Devised Sam [249] 131 Horapollo 124 or Coustau 178 Newly Devised 133 Newly Devised Alc (24) 166a Newly Devised Mon (72) 184 Freitag, 69 Newly Devised 186 Reusner, III, 21 Sam [234] 188a Per (47) or Reusner, II, 12 Par 226 189a Freitag, 177 or Reusner, II, 22 Sam [269] 216a Newly Devised Mon (42) 216b Newly Devised Mon (70) 218a Newly Devised Ane 91 221 Per (19) Mon (39) 223 Newly Devised Mon (56) 224a Newly Devised Mon (67) 224b Newly Devised Mon (90) 228 Newly Devised Mon (61) 229a Newly Devised Mon (65) It must be noted that the total misattribution made by Green is remarkably small; eight instances are real, one is the result of confusing motto with woodcut sources, and the remaining nine are due to his overlooking Montenay's emblem-book, even though he referred to it later in his Shakespeare and the Emblem Writers (1870). Coincidentally, Montenay was not available to Whitney when the MS was being composed. In addition, Faernus' Fabulae Centum was not among those emblem-books that Whitney owned or had access to during that time. For in the printed edition, Whitney found the woodblocks used to print the Plantin edition of Faernus and chose from them thirteen new emblems. Furthermore, he replaced three drawings in the MS—one based on Sam [216], one on Ane 80, and the third on one as yet untraced source—with three identical woodcuts from Faernus (more on this later). Besides these 25 emblems from Faernus and Montenay, Whitney added 40 more emblems that are not in the MS, but excluded 13 emblems in the MS from the printed edition. It may be instructive to parallel the frequency of source uses in the MS with that in Choice so as to epitomize the process of converting from one to the other: Source MS Choice Alc 78 87 Sam 44 51 Par 22 32 Jun 17 21 Fae 0 16 Per 9 8 Ane 7 8 Mon 0 9 Newly Devised 20 15 ___ ____ Total 197 247 13 All except one in the MS from Alciati are used in Choice , to which 10 more from the same source are added. All except one from Sambucus are used in, and 8 more are added to, Choice . Ten more are added to all of Paradin, whereas all except one from Junius with 5 more added. All except one from La Perrière are used in Choice , while all except one from Aneau and two more added. Ten "newly devised" are used in the printed edition with five new ones added. The order of emblems in both the MS and Choice seems to follow neither topic nor subject. The order in the MS seems to have been based on the desire to space the sources, permitting no more than three consecutive emblems from the same one source, with only two exceptions in the second part. If the order of Choice was in some way based on that of the MS, Whitney took great pains to shuffle it thoroughly. For a visual demonstration of Whitney's intentional shuffling of the order of emblems in the MS so that (with the exception of the beginning three emblems in the first part and the first emblem in the second part) the order in Choice little resembles that of the MS, a list of MS emblems, their sources (a few of them have never before been identified), and their corresponding emblems in Choice is provided here as Appendix III. Even to a cursory eye, the repetitive cycle of placing the MS emblems in a widely scattered order in Choice is immediately apparent. The rationale of the order in Choice may thus be Whitney's desire to present a different appearance from that of the MS. Such a desire is not hard to appreciate, for as a result of the shuffling, the MS version would maintain its uniqueness, hence a worthy gift for a noble patron. Also as a result of the shuffling, another pattern emerges in terms of the distribution of sources in the two parts of Choice . Not only the new additions copied from Montenay and the "newly devised" (all but one) are found in the second part, but those emblems that are recopied from La Perrière and Aneau also are now collected in this part, leaving the first part with all but one emblem struck off from identical woodblocks (see Appendix II). By contrast, there are in the MS four "newly devised" emblems, five emblems copied from La Perrière, and five from Aneau in the first part, while six "newly devised," four from La Perrière, and five from Aneau are in the second part. It seems as though in reassigning the MS emblems to Choice Whitney wanted to start the first part quickly with blocks chosen from the Plantin stock and put in the second part the woodcuts that had to be copied from the three sources (i.e., La Perrière, Aneau, and Montenay) and the "newly devised" from the MS—a task obviously requiring much longer time. Be that as it may, this review of sources has produced a series of new totals: there are in Choice 207 identical emblems, 25 copied from their sources, and 15 "newly devised" emblems. With this new count, the study of the component parts of these emblems—motto, woodcut, and verse—may now begin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2. Changes in Mottoes Green's contribution to the study of mottoes in Choice is limited to the "Index to the Mottoes, with translations etc.," placed immediately after the "Introductory Dissertation" (pp. lxxv-lxxix) and the list of motto changes, about sixty-five in all, as part of the "Addenda" (pp. 404-405). Like the borrowing of 207 identical woodcuts from his sources, Whitney retained a vast majority of their mottoes as well. In the MS, among the 184 emblems which appear later in Choice , 155 have the same mottoes as those of their sources; in the printed edition, only 79 mottoes differ from their source emblems. Of these 11 are of minor changes. A few examples will suffice: Wh 29 "Amor in filios" from Alc (193) "Amor filiorum"; Wh 94 "Inuidiae descriptio" from Alc (71) "Inuidia"; Wh 67 "Murus aeneus, sana conscientia" from Sam 14 "Conscientia integra, laurus"; Wh 155 "Indulgentia parentum filiorum pernicies" from Fae 119 "Exitium natis parti indulgentia patrum"; Wh 158 "Post fata: vxor morosa, etiam discors" from Fae 49 "Morosa, &amp; discors vel mortua litigat vxor." These changes involve nothing more than adding or dropping inconsequential words or verbals or replacing the originals with synonymous phrasings. For the major motto changes among emblems in the MS, Choice , and their sources, a list is provided here as Appendix IV. The eight different types of changes in varying degrees of significance may be gathered into two groups, depending on the number of times a motto change is made. Changed once from their sources are three types: those emblems in Choice but not in the MS (20 instances represented by a dash under MS in Appendix IV), those from the MS without source mottoes (4, by a dash following Per under Wdct &amp; Motto), and those belonging to "newly devised" emblems (3, by two dashes under Wdct &amp; Motto). Examples of the first type are mostly from Faernus, with a few of each from Montenay and Paradin; a single illustration from Faernus will suffice. Fae 128 "Alia dicunt, alia faciunt hice mortales, ait," which is less a motto than a quotation, is based on the Aesopic fable "Lupus et Mulier." The disappointed wolf is saying, "Men say one thing, do another," on his departure after having waited for the mother to fulfill her promise of throwing her crying baby to the wolf if it does not become quiet. Whitney transformed the speech into a direct moral: "In eos qui multa promittunt, &amp; nihil praestant" (Wh 162). The most interesting change of the second type occurs in the emblem based on Per (1), which like all emblems from La Perrière contains no motto of its own. The MS describes the subject of the woodcut with "Janus quid" (fol. 52 v ), but Whitney changed it in Choice , accentuating the moral, to "Respice, &amp; prospice" (Wh 108). Once more for moral specificity Whitney changed the "newly devised" MS emblem "Furius Camillus" (fol. 95) to "Habet &amp; bellum suas leges" (Wh 112). Also changed once but involving all three—MS, Choice , and source—are three types: Choice motto follows MS change from source (22 instances represented in the list by ibid. under MS); Choice motto differs from that in the MS which retains source motto (7, by ibid. under Wdct &amp; Motto); Choice motto differs from that in the MS by returning to source motto (as in Wh 58, Wh 90, &amp; Wh 171). A few examples will demonstrate the variety of ways of changing the mottoes in this group, beginning with the last type first. In the emblem of "Dolphin aground" the motto from Alc (166) "In eum qui truculentia suorum perierit" is changed in the MS (fol. 42 v ) to "Exilio saepè mulctantur optimè de patria meriti." Alciati's verse supports his motto by emphasizing the fact that the sea, through its many storms, causes its own, the dolphin, to perish. Although Whitney rendered Alciati's tetrastich fairly closely, he emphasized the fact of exile and applied it to men: "The raging sea, our countrie doth declaire; | The Dolphin fishe, those that exiled are. . . So famous men, that longe did beare the swaie, | haue bene exil'd, and liu'd in habit pore" (Wh 90). However, Whitney restored Alciati's motto in Choice even though the MS motto conforms more closely to his verse. As an example of the second type, the MS (fol. 21) retains the motto "Restat ex victore Orientis" from Par 53, which depicts the de casibus theme with Saladin's shirt on a lance. Following Paradin's moral: "Auertissement à tout homme, tant soit puissant &amp; riche, qu'il lui conuient soy despouiller de tout, au pas de mort, &amp; s'en aller aussi nù hors de ce monde, que fait le plus indigent, ou le plus poure," Whitney changed the original "Restat ex victore Orientis," which is more descriptive of Saladin's shirt in the woodcut, to the terser but more universal "Mortui diuitiae." Three examples from the first, and by far the largest, type of changes show Whitney's expanding and reducing the original mottoes once more for greater moral specificity. Wh 9 follows the MS (fol. 15 v ) in shortening Sam 28 "Plus quam Diomedis et Glauci permutatio" to "Experientia docet," which specifies the moral in the story of "Prince, astronomer &amp; husbandman." Because of his experience the farmer is able to predict the weather more accurately than is the astronomer; as a result, the prince orders the two to exchange their tools of trade and says, ". . . henceforthe wee will allowe, | That learninge shall vnto Experience bowe." What Whitney did was simply to convert the last line of his verse into a brief but lucid motto, more direct than the allusive original. Instead of Par 159 "Infringit solido" Whitney expanded it to "Calumniam contra calumniatorem virtus repellit" (Wh 138a and fol. 28 v ) for the emblem of an arrow broken in halves when shot at a marble wall, taking his clue once more from Paradin's wordings: "Voulant calomnier un personnage, ferme, magnanime, &amp; constant, la Calomnie retourne contre le Calomniateur. . . ." Again, the expanded motto is more explicit of the moral in its supporting verse: "So slaunders foule, and wordes like arrowes keene, | Not vertue hurtes, but turnes her foes to teene." Finally, a unique motto change takes place in Wh 140 (fol. 78), whose motto "Feriunt summos fulmina montes" differs entirely from its source in Sam 183 "Canis queritur nimium nocere." This new motto, however, is not descriptive of the woodcut, which depicts the ban-dog being whipped by its master whereas the lap-dog being pampered by its mistress is closer to Sambucus' original motto. The source of the new motto is strangely found in the end verse to Wh 59, a quotation from Horace (Carm. 2. Od. 10): Saepius ventis agitatur ingens Pinus, &amp; celsae grauiore casu Decidunt turres, feriuntque summos Fulmina montes. This end verse fits the moral of Wh 59 "Nimium rebus ne fide secondis" which deals with the whirlwind breaking the lofty and proud pine trees. To conform the new motto to the verse of Wh 140, Whitney added a third sextet which is not in Sambucus: The loftie pine, with axe is ouerthrowne, And is prepar'd, to serue the shipmans turne: When bushes stande, till stormes bee ouerblowne. And lightninges flashe, the mountaine toppes doth burne. All which doe shewe: that pompe, and worldlie power, Makes monarches, markes: when varrijnge fate doth lower. Although the moral suggested by the new motto is not unrelated to the misfortune of the ban-dog, the change from Sambucus' original motto necessitates the addition of an extra sextet (more on the verse see p. 61) in order to justify the change—a sign of Whitney's conscientious workmanship. Changed twice are nine instances which reflect Whitney's dissatisfaction with the changes from his source mottoes in the MS. A simple example is Alc (189) "Dives indoctus," which becomes in the MS, fol. 71, "In diuitem idiotam," but is changed again in Choice to "In diuitem, indoctum" (Wh 214). A more elaborate change occurs in the emblem based on Sam 198, whose motto "Fictus amicus" is made more explicit in the MS to stress the foxiness of false friendship, "Non vulpina vestis sed cor prauu sub amici specie latens, periculosissimu" (fol. 76 v ). 14 It is, however, changed again and simplified into Wh 124 "Amicitia fucata vitanda." Unlike the motto change in Wh 140, which Whitney borrowed from the end verse of Wh 59, Wh 58 rejects the change made by its MS counterpart, fol. 43 v , "Quicquid delirant reges, plectunt r Achiui," from Sam 110 "Non dolo, sed virtute" and returns to the original with "Non dolo, sed vi." Nevertheless, Whitney retained the MS motto by quoting it as an end verse in Wh 58 and annotated it as taken from Horace (Lib. 1. Epist. 2). The most drastic modification takes place in Wh 48 "Labor irritus," which epitomizes the moral but eliminates the wordy restatement in the MS, "Fatuitas delirantium meretrises, quibus donant quod in bonos vsus verti debeat" (fol. 68 v ), of the equally lengthy and allusive original in Alc (91) "Ocni effigies, de iis qui meretricibus donant, quod in bonos vsus verti debeat." Two emblems, Wh 51a and Wh 91, in this group share another feature with five others (represented in Appendix IV by quotation marks surrounding sources) which constitute the eighth and last type of motto changes: one of the changes has been traced to the motto of another emblematic source. A simple illustration will clarify this rather involved process. Wh 1 "Te stante, virebo" is identical in woodcut with that of Jun (14), whose motto "Principum opes, plebis adminicula" the MS rejects in preference to the motto of Par 72, which Wh 1 retains. Paradin's device is unframed and pictures the obelisk tipped with a crescent moon and entwined by ivy. Another example is where the MS, fol. 29 v , retains the motto of its source, Par 154 "Vlterius ne tende odijs," but Wh 143 changes it to "Vindice fato," which is borrowed from Sam 206. A more complicated change is that in Wh 51a "Vitae, aut morti" with marginal reference to St. Paul's discussion of the letter versus the spirit in 2 Cor. 3:6. The MS, fol. 59a, differs, having changed the source motto "Boni adulterium" of Jun (33) into "Litera occidit," which is no doubt based on the verse from Second Corinthians. Wh 91, along with Wh 39, borrows not only its motto but also its drawing design from one emblem source in the MS, but in Choice is represented by an identical woodcut from a different emblem source. Detailed explanation of this intricate conversion process will be deferred until the next section on woodcut design. Suffice it to summarize the motto changes: all changes are in the main for the better. Whether they expand or shorten their originals, they are made usually for clarity and precision of moral and for closer conformity with the verses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3. Variations in Woodcut Designs Even more so than mottoes, woodcut designs help to determine emblem sources and reveal the interplay among the three components of an emblem. Not only did Whitney change mottoes for more specific moralizing and for greater conformity with the verses, but he also modified the designs and altered details of his models to bring about greater harmony between the verses and the woodcuts. A comparison between the MS drawings and the woodcuts in Choice is particularly revealing of Whitney's penchant for greater harmony among the three components. Apart from the 20 drawings whose sources have not been traced (see Appendix III), the majority of the remaining 177 in the MS follow their models fairly closely. In the printed edition, the 207 identical woodcuts of course present no variation from their sources; however, some of the MS copies from 158 of these same models do show some interesting variations. Of greater significance are 16 emblems in the MS whose drawings were modeled on the woodcuts of La Perrière and Aneau. And because these emblem-books were not printed by Plantin and therefore no blocks were available, these same emblems were copied again and made into new woodcuts for the printed edition. In other words, for these the MS artist copied them into the pen-and-ink drawings and later the Choice artist copied them again for the new woodcuts. The resultant differences in the two sets show that the Choice artist modeled his designs not on the MS drawings except when there was no other model, but directly on the woodcuts of La Perrière and Aneau (see Figs. 20-22). Whether or not the MS artist might have been Whitney himself is indeterminable. The monogram [HA] appears on three drawings: fols. 34, 36, 39. The last is one of the 13 emblems which Whitney did not use in Choice ; the other two become Wh 145 and Wh 148 respectively. All three belong to the 20 "newly devised" emblems in the MS. A relatively safe assumption is that Whitney commissioned [HA], whoever he might be, to draw or devise these three emblems. Whether the same [HA] also drew the other 17 "newly devised" emblems or whether he might be the MS artist who drew all of the 197 emblems is a matter of conjecture. The identity of artists for the source emblems has been perfunctorily mentioned and conjectured by Green (p. 248); overlooked by him are a number of emblems that are signed with the monograms [ A ] and [G]. Eleven from Faernus (Wh 31, 93a, 153a, 153b, 154, 156a, 156b, 158, 159, 160, 162) are signed with [ A ]; three (Wh 91, 98a, 157) are signed with [G]. Three from Sambucus (Wh 9, 43, 142) are signed with [ A ], one (Wh 206) with [G]; and from Junius two (Wh 3, 44) are signed with [G]. 15 [ A ] is the monogram of Arnold Nicolai, who worked for the Plantin press from 1555 to 1596; [G] is that of Gerard Jansen van Kampen, who also worked for the same press from 1564 to 1584. 16 Perhaps the most unusual accident in the MS artist's copying from his source occurred when he modeled the drawing on fol. 20 after the woodcut in Sam 164 which contains the monogram [G] among other symbols on a brick wall (see Wh 206). The copyist obviously did not realize that it was the engraver's monogram and copied it along with other symbols. It will be the main concern in this section to examine two types of variation in design: one the result of the MS artist's deviation from his models in emblem-books whose identical woodblocks are later used in Choice , and the other that of the MS artist's copying from La Perrière and Aneau, from which the Choice artist copied again for the printed edition. The copying of the 10 "newly devised" emblems from the MS by the Choice artist and his devising of five new emblems will be dealt with in Section 6 below. Of the first type of variations only the most significantly divergent designs between the MS copies and their originals will be discussed. Among those based on Alciati (77 drawings) the single most significant change in one detail is on fol. 23 v . Based on Alc (71), later Wh 94, "Inuidiae descriptio," the MS drawing shows properly the thorny staff, whereas the woodcut in the 1577 Plantin edition pictures Envy's staff without thorns. 17 Although Whitney expanded Alciati's original tetrastich into three sextets, he kept the last important detail and rendered the Latin "spinosaque gestat | Tela manu" in his final couplet: "And laste of all, her staffe with prickes aboundes: | Which showes her wordes, wherewith the good shee woundes." 18 Similarly, though the addition is more noticeable, in the drawing on fol. 86 v the MS artist places an ape on the back of an ass, whereas the printed woodcut pictures only the ass along with the goat, the dog, and the swine. The ape is however not directly mentioned in Alc (76), but is added in Whitney's translation: "See here Vlisses men, transformed straunge to heare: | Some has the shape of Goates, and Hogges, some Apes, and Asses weare" (Wh 82). In adding the ape onto the back of the ass, the MS artist was forced to move the tree from the left to the right side so that the tree would not obstruct the ape from behind. Thus, the demand for greater conformity between the verse and the drawing caused the artist to add one detail which in turn necessitated further modification of the design of the model. Another such modification appears on fol. 45, modeled on Alc (54) and later Wh 33 "Swallow's nest and Medea." The MS drawing is faithful to the verse which changes the question in Alciati's original "Cholchidos in gremio nidum quid congeris?" into a direct statement: "The swallowe yet, whoe did suspect no harme, | Hir Image likes, and hatch'd vppon her breste." It depicts a nest on the breast of Medea's statue with a swallow hovering over the nest as if preparing to enter it (Fig. 3). The design of the 1577 Plantin model, however, pictures the nest clinging to the edge of the niche over the head of Medea, and the swallow is flying toward its nest from some distance to the right (Wh 33). Clearly, the MS drawing is more faithful to its verse. In using identical woodblocks from the Plantin press and in not revising the verses later, Whitney left three emblems (i.e., Wh 33, 82, 94) in Choice with discrepancies between their verses and woodcuts. As a result of the mistaken switching of woodcuts in the 1577 Plantin edition, the drawing in fol. 72 (Fig. 4) is based on the wrong woodcut of Alc (24) which later became Wh 62 through Whitney's correction. Green, although correctly identifying Wh 62 with Alc (159), placed Wh 133 among the "newly devised" emblems; it is likely that he was consulting the same 1577 Plantin edition and discovered that the woodcut of Alc (24) showed a different design from that of Wh 133. The most uncommon variation in design from Junius occurs on fol. 75 v a, later Wh 93b. This is an emblem on wifely virtues based on Jun (50) and is represented by a woman standing on a tortoise and holding a bunch of keys in one hand and holding the other hand over her mouth. The MS artist added a dove prominently to the right of the figure to support the verse, in particular, line 3 of the single sextet: "The turtull shewes hir pure &amp; honest lyfe." But for the printed Choice Whitney took the trouble of revising this line to "The modest lookes, doe shew her honest life," thereby removing an otherwise puzzling discrepancy between the verse and the woodcut which, as does its original in Junius, shows no dove at all. The most accidental difference among drawings based on Paradin is the one on fol. 55 v , which shows the crab on top holding a butterfly with its claws. As indicated in the headnotes to Appendix II, this emblem "Festina lentè" belongs to the group of 36 designed by Gabriel Symeoni and form the last part, pp. 271-316, of the 1567 Plantin edition of Paradin's Symbola Heroica (see Appendix I). On p. 273 the woodcut for this emblem which the MS copied also pictures the crab on top and the butterfly in its claws below (Fig. 5). It is obvious that the MS artist modeled his drawing on this particular edition with the upside-down woodcut. All the other Symeoni "Festina lentè" woodcuts customarily show the butterfly on top as it is in Wh 121. 19 Of a greater and more significant variation in design from that by Symeoni (Par [311]) is the drawing on fol. 70 v later Wh 169. In expanding the original woodcut of 58 x 50 mm. (2¼ x 2”) to a much elongated frame of 64 x 86 mm. (2½ x 3⅜”), the artist added some more building to the right of the center house, from the second-storey window of which an ape is scattering its master-miser's gold pieces (Fig. 6). To the left of this house, two more details are added, each of which is supported by the verse. An ape is pictured chained to a low fence at the rear of the house to the left; it is described at the end of the first sextet: "And to his clogge, was chained in the courte." A man is bending over and collecting the gold pieces that the ape is scattering from the upstairs window: "The sight righte well the passers by did please, | Who gathered scrappes that after bought them croommes" (the second line is subsequently changed in Choice to "Who did reioyce to finde these goulden crommes"). The last new detail is an ironical extension of the miser's sin of avarice, as reflected in the motto "Malè parta malè dilabuntur," especially when these passers-by were poor people and the gold pieces "all theire life, theire pouertie did ease." The first new detail is most interesting in that it enables the MS drawing to tell a fuller story, a two-stage action as it were, of how the miser keeps the ape in chains for his daily sport and how one day it gets loose and makes sport of his master's avarice. In replacing this drawing with the identical woodblock from the 1567 Paradin (see Wh 169), a great deal is lost, not to mention the resultant discrepancy between the verse and the woodcut. This case excepting, the use of identical woodblocks from Paradin in Choice is otherwise an improvement over the drawings in the MS. This is so because many of the woodcuts in Paradin are, as has been mentioned in the introduction, of a vertical rectangular design, measuring 83 x 50 mm. (3¼ x 2”). In converting these to a horizontal rectangular frame, the MS artist is invariably forced to modify the original design, frequently resulting in inferior copies. This is particularly true of fol. 42a, where the original design measuring 74 x 51 mm. (2⅞ x 2” as seen in Wh 88) must be drastically flattened and elongated into a frame of 44 x 80 mm. (1¾ x 3⅛”; see Fig. 7). Out of the 44 drawings based on Sambucus only three diverge significantly from their models. The design in fol. 43 v differs from its model in Sam 110 "Non dolo, sed virtute." The original woodcut (as seen in Wh 58) depicts in the left foreground an ape forcing an unwilling dog to retrieve chestnuts from an open fireplace; the right half of the woodcut pictures what appears to be a sculptor's studio, with the artist carrying a bust and walking out of the room. The MS artist retains the main subject of the ape and the dog, but changes all things else, including a much more elaborate fireplace on the left, a shelf under a window in the center background, and a man entering the room from a door on the right (Fig. 8). These changes, however, affect neither the moral nor the verse. In fol. 64 v the much more drastic changes are induced by Whitney's desire to conform the drawing to the verse. The original woodcut from Sam 177 "Frontis nulla fides," later Wh 100 "Dog, bull &amp; painter," shows a man fleeing from a barking dog at his heel while watching the chase is a bull whose body from neck down is blocked from view by a seated painter drawing on a tablet which is held by a man seated opposite him. In Sambucus' verse, five creatures are named to illustrate the fact that these all reveal their true characters by their God-given traits: Latratibus canis sic Suae indicem dat irae. Taurus monet furorem Quod cornibus petendo Laedat, venena caudis Serpens gerit, timendus Et scorpius cauetur. Sambucus' artist, however, chose to present only the dog and the bull and to portray the moral lesson of the emblem with the painter—a lesson carefully prescribed in the verse also. In translating the list of animals, Whitney omitted the scorpion and added in its place the lion and the griffin in the first quatrain of the verse: The lions roare: the Boares theire tuskes do whett. The Griphins graspe theire tallantes in theire ire: The dogges do barke; the bulles, with hornes do thrett. The serpentes hisse, with eies as redd as fire. In order to be faithful to this list the MS artist retained the fleeing man, the pursuing dog, and the watching bull—all in their respective positions in the model. The two seated men he replaced with two men standing, facing one another, with the man who blocks the view of the bull's body from neck down stabbing the other man in the abdomen with a long sword. Then he added a griffin in the upper left corner, a boar's head and one of its forelegs in the lower left corner, a coiled snake in the lower right corner, and a roaring lion at the back of the stabbing man (Fig. 9). The stabbing scene, in lieu of the original painting scene, has its support from the MS quatrain: And hipocrites, have godlie wordes at will And rauening wolues, in skinnes of lambes do lurke; And Caine dothe seeke good Abel for to kill, And sainctes in shewe, with Judas do worke. (The third line is changed in Choice to "And Cain doth seeke, his brother for to kill.") So the two men are to represent Cain and Abel in the MS drawing. Moreover, since the drawing omits the painting scene, the MS verse ends with the fourth quatrain (the two versions are identical in their first four quatrains) to which Whitney added a final couplet: Nowe, since the good no cognizance do beare, To teache vs, whome wee chieflie should imbrace: But that the same the wicked sorte do weare, And shewe them selves like them, in euerie case I do affirme that man maie better scape The savage beasts, then foes that beare his shape. All in all, the MS drawing is closely supported by its verse, whereas the woodcut in Choice is not. Unwilling, as it were, to rewrite the entire MS verse so as to support the woodcut better, Whitney simply removed the final couplet and added an extra quatrain before concluding the Choice verse with the last sextet. As a result, the lion, the boar, the griffin, and the serpent along with Cain and Abel are not illustrated by the printed woodcut. The last example of variation in design in the MS drawing taken from Sambucus leads to a special category in which the woodcuts in Choice are all from Faernus although in the MS drawings, in addition to Sambucus, one is based on Aneau and the other on an uncertain model. As has been mentioned in Sections 1 and 2 above, these drawings appear in fol. 33, based on Sam[216] later Wh 39 whose woodcut is identical to that in Fae 90; on fol. 9, based on Ane 80 later Wh 91 identical to Fae 95; and on fol. 92 v , based on a model similar to Fae 56 which is identical to the woodcut in Wh 93a (see Appendix III). For fol. 33 Whitney based its motto and drawing on those of Sam[216], "Mediocribus vtere partis," which is based ultimately on one of Aesop's fables, "Canis &amp; caro." The MS drawing follows Sambucus' model closely except the details surrounding the dog. Instead of the dog standing, as in Sam[216], on what looks like dry land, the MS artist added a bridge and on top of it put the dog which looks down at his own reflections in the water below (Fig. 10). Now in Choice the identical woodcut (Wh 39) from Fae 90 shows in an entirely different design the dog standing on the river bank with its forepaws in the water; its verse remains unchanged from that of the MS. Next, the MS drawing on fol. 9 is based on Ane 80, "Tecum habita," which is ultimately the Aesop's fable "Iuppiter et Cochlea." Although Whitney changed the motto to "Conuiuare raro," the MS artist followed the woodcut of Aneau closely, again with one exception. In addition to the tortoise near the lower left corner, he pictured a snail in center foreground (Fig. 11). This is done obviously to conform to Whitney's translation of Aneau's verse in which testudo was rendered "snail": Cuncta simul venere. epulo Testudo secundo Venit eamque morae Iupiter increpuit. Quaerenti caussas. . . . Tardigradam cochleam domiportam, sanguine cassam Ex illa edixit Iuppiter esse die. At lengthe, when all weare in their cheifest cheare: At seconde course, the snaile crepte slowlie in, Whome Iove did blame, cause hee so slacke had bin. Who aunswered thus, oh kinge behoulde the cause? I beare my house, wherefore my pace is slowe: Which warneth all, in feasting for to pause, And to the same, with pace of snaile to goe. . . . This verse remains unchanged in Wh 91, which has the identical woodcut from Fae 95 where Jupiter is seated on his throne, surrounded by a deer, a horse, a bull, an ass, his eagle, and a lion. At the foot of the dais is the snail, looking up at Jupiter and responding to his question. The Latin distich below the two sextets in Choice is from the last two lines in Aneau's verse; these are the only clues to Ane 80 as the source of both the verse in Wh 91 and the MS drawing. It is apparent that Whitney was not entirely satisfied with the MS drawing, containing as it did both the snail and the tortoise, and gladly replaced it in Choice with the identical woodcut from Fae 95, which fits his verse equally nicely. Finally, the drawing on fol. 92 v diverges from the woodcut in Wh 93a and its source in Fae 56 not only in background but also in the representation of the mole. Unlike the sure-footed creature in Wh 93a, the MS mole is somewhat misshapen; at first glance it might resemble a tortoise, as if the MS artist really had no pictorial model in front of him when he drew the small blind beast (Fig. 12). So much for the first type of variations in design. Now the second type. Aside from the emblem on fol. 9 which is modeled on Ane 80, there are five more MS drawings copied from Aneau's Picta Poesis . These the Choice artist copied once more directly from Aneau, not from the MS; as a result, the Choice woodcuts are closer to the original than they are to the MS drawings, which differ from their models only in minor ways. Folio 96 omits a small dog at lower left corner and the tree in the center foreground; fol. 81 v adds trees on the hilltop to which Sisyphus is rolling the restless stone and some farm buildings in the distant background to the left; fol. 90 v b omits the pond in front of the ass-eared Midas, who awards the palm to the bagpipe-playing Pan instead of to Apollo. The copying and recopying from La Perrière's Le Théâtre des bons engins are more interesting in that the exact models have not hitherto been determined. Green and Henkel and Schöne, who follow him, assume that the models are from the 1539 Paris edition. The truth of the matter is that both the MS drawings and the Choice recopies are so consistently and significantly different from the models in 1539 that they must have been based on models from a later edition. According to both Robert Hoe and Praz, there is at least one edition later than 1539 that might have been used as model for Whitney's artists. Hoe lists a 1554 edition in Paris by Estienne Groulleau, in addition to Thomas Combe's English translation published in London by Richard Field in 1614, whereas Praz mentions two editions in 1545: one published at Angiers by P. Trepperel, the other at Lyons by Jean de Tournes, "who in 1583 issued a cheap edition 16mo, 56 leaves." 20 My attention was first drawn to the possibility that Whitney's artists worked with an edition later than that of 1539 when I compared Whitney's woodcuts with those in Combe's edition. Their obvious close resemblance leads to the inevitable conclusion that Combe's edition must also have been based on one of the later editions of Le Théâtre . Professor Praz, who has, upon my request, compared Whitney's emblems with the woodcuts in his personal copy of the 1583 Lyons edition, is convinced that Whitney's artists must have modeled their copies on the cuts either in the 1583 or the earlier 1545 Lyons edition which, with its decorative borders, must have been the copy for Combe's English edition as well. 21 A few examples will show that Whitney consulted either the 1545 or the 1583 instead of the 1539 edition, using woodcuts reproduced from Combe's edition to represent the 1545 edition. Per (100) is copied by the MS artists in fol. 46 v , later by the Choice artist for Wh 175 (Fig. 13), and portrays, in the 1545 edition, Diligence seated on a throne-like chariot drawn by six ants with Idleness squatting in front of her out-stretched right leg, and the chariot progressing through an open field with mountain and trees in the distance (Fig. 14). The 1539 cut, however, pictures Diligence standing on a flat car drawn by six ants with Idleness half sitting and half standing on the front edge of the platform, and the procession passing by an elaborate building in the background to the right (Fig. 15). 22 The copying from La Perrière is as a rule fairly faithful; however, because of the need to conform the drawing to a verse substantially altered from its original, a great deal of modification is seen in the copying of the first emblem from Le Théâtre . In the 1539 edition, Janus is pictured as standing, wearing a crown, holding a large key in his left hand, a blazing mirror in his right, with simple mountains as background (Fig. 23). The 1545 edition portrays a crowned Janus, holding the key in his right hand and the mirror in his left, standing to the right of a large tree, with buildings in the background to his left (Fig. 24). The MS artist retained the building and the mirror in the left hand, but removed the crown, changed the blazing mirror to an ordinary looking glass and the key to a scepter, and replaced the tree to the left with some rather indistinguishable hillock. Janus' costume was also changed to a Roman military toga (Fig. 25). In Wh 108, further changes from the MS are noticeable: the building has been moved from right to left, and the lower part of a tree trunk, following the 1545 model, added to the right. The most interesting addition made by the Choice artist is that of Mars's sword, as if the military garb in the MS were insufficient to support the verse, where Janus is, in the third sextet, "Call'd the God of warre, and peace" (Fig. 26). As a result of these modifications, in seriatim, Wh 108 differs not a little from the model in the 1545 edition. But if examples of variation in design have thus far proved anything, they have confirmed the indebtedness of the artists to their models so long as the changes are dictated by the desire to bring about greater conformity between the verse and the woodcut. From Montenay's Emblèmes ou devises chrestiennes the Choice artist copied nine emblems; in the process he had to reduce the original large 90 x 98 mm. (3⅛ x 3⅞”) copperplates designed by Pierre Woeiriot to a square of 57 mm. (2¼”). Moreover, since each original cut, except Mon (72), contains within its design a motto plaque, he had to remove it. As a result, there are more minor variations in design from this source than from any other sources. In two copies, however, he kept the original mottoes in Mon (72) and Mon (65). By retaining the original mottoes and by adding new mottoes of his own to Wh 166a and Wh 229a, Whitney caused these emblems to have dual mottoes: Wh 166a has the motto "Veritas inuicta" along with the words on the open Bible, "Et vsque ad nubes veritas tua" (Figs. 27, 28); similarly, Wh 229a has "Dominus viuit &amp; videt" in addition to "Vbi es" in which the Choice artist replaced the plaque in the original with a radiating sun (Figs. 29, 30). Such a minor change enables the artist to bring about an ingenious improvement over the original. For "Vbi es" in the midst of a radiating sun—representing God's voice walking in the Garden seeking out the fallen Adam who hides himself behind a tree—more nearly conforms to the biblical account of the aftermath of the Fall. In other words, through this change "Vbi es," no longer an extrapictorial addition as in the original design in Montenay, becomes an integral and dramatic part of the emblem. The study of variations in design and the comparison between the MS drawings and the Choice woodcuts have produced one interesting conclusion. The ability of the MS artist in modifying his drawings to bring about a closer conformity with the verse is clearly demonstrated in fols. 23 v , 86 v , 45, 70 v , and 64 v . When these drawings were replaced with woodcuts identical to their models and when Whitney did not have time to revise their verses accordingly in Choice , there resulted discrepancies between woodcuts and verses as seen in Wh 94, 82, 33, 169, and 100. Apart from these last instances, Whitney was as a rule conscientious in preserving harmony between the woodcuts and the verses in Choice , as will further be seen in the next section.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4. Survey of Verses Because of the close interplay among the three main components of an emblem, the motto and woodcut changes have, in the two foregoing sections, been shown to influence the verse and vice versa. Whitney, especially in the MS, changed the mottoes and pictorial designs of his sources to conform to the verses, or altered the verses to bring about greater conformity to the other two components. In this section, discussion of the verses will concentrate on both their physical and quantitative, as well as on their substantive and qualitative, aspects. Those aspects that have not hitherto been studied are: the variety of stanzaic forms and its relationship to the structure of the verses, the drastic expansion and abridgement of the verses from their originals, and the changes made in the verses in Choice from those in the MS. By far the most frequently used stanzaic form is the sextet, and the most popular verse form consists of two sextets—83 instances in the MS, 103 in Choice . Verse of a single sextet is next in frequency: 29 in the MS, 38 in Choice ; the largest number of sextets in a verse in the MS is six, that in Choice is eight. The poulter's measure, a couplet of iambic hexameter and iambic heptameter, is next to the sextet Whitney's favorite form of versification. Because of its line length it is most frequently used as a space-saver; particularly when two emblems are sharing a page, the space below the woodcut would not permit the printing of a sextet even using the smallest type face, but would allow one couplet, sometimes even two couplets, of poulter's measure. In the MS Whitney used the measure 28 times, the one-couplet and two-couplet forms most often with the highest number of couplets in one verse being 25; in Choice , 44 times, again the one- and two-couplet forms dominating, with the highest number of couplets in a single verse, 30. Rhyming ababcc the iambic pentameter sextet lends itself well to emblematic versifying. In a single-sextet verse, the first four lines are usually expository of the woodcut; then the concluding couplet rounds off the moral in epigrammatic terseness. In a two-sextet verse, the first sextet is usually given over to exposition, the second to moralizing. Often the first four lines of a second sextet are devoted to an interim application to the human situation of the exposition in the first sextet before the final couplet sums up the emblematic moral. In a three-sextet verse (which is used 23 times in the MS, 27 in Choice ) Whitney revealed his talent for variation by giving the first sextet to generalizing or philosophizing before illustrating the commonplace concretely in the second, and applying and concluding it in the third. Constantly, he varied this tripartite arrangement so that the first sextet may be exposition, the third may be generalization, and the second may be application, and so on. Unlike the sextet, the poulter's measure gives a weightier impression and provides less variety. Again, because of its space-saving feature, it is frequently used to present a sustained disquisition of considerable length, especially when Whitney drastically expanded the verse from its original in other emblem-books. One interesting change in verse form from the MS to Choice occurs on fols. 40 v and 41, which contain verses made up of three quatrains. Each quatrain contains three lines of iambic trimeter and one line (the third) of iambic tetrameter, rhyming abcb; but in reality each quatrain is but a couplet of poulter's measure in disguise. In Choice these two emblems, Wh 77a and Wh 142, are made to occupy half-page spaces, and the same verses are printed in the form of three couplets of poulter's measure. The situation is different when in Wh 22 the verse contains four quatrains of the poulter's measure in disguise, but in the MS, fol. 25 v , it is also written in four quatrains. The reason appears to be that neither emblem lacks space in either version. Quatrains of four lines of iambic pentameter are rarely used. Rhyming abab, one appears in Wh 100, where, as has been pointed out in the previous section, the need to follow the original verse in Sambucus caused Whitney to expand the three quatrains and a sextet in the MS to five quatrains and a sextet in Choice . It seems as though this form of quatrain is the result of withholding the couplet, the addition of which would change it instantly to a sextet. In addition to this ingenious use of the quatrain, the only other time it is used is in fol. 74 v where the emblem "Potentia amoris," taken from Alc (106) and later Wh 182a, has the unique combination of a verse in quatrain, rhyming in couplets, followed by a thirteen-couplet poulter's measure, entitled "The description of loue by Marullus &amp; Augerianus." But because Wh 182a occupies the top half of that page, the long poem in poulter's measure is discarded. More frequently used than the quatrain, the 10-line iambic pentameter verse appears 11 times in both versions. Once, a double 10-line verse is used on fol. 82, later Wh 136. Once, in converting from the MS to Choice , the 10-line verse on fol. 36 becomes a two-sextet verse in Wh 184; the fact that there is an empty space between the fourth and fifth lines in the MS strongly suggests that Whitney added a couplet to the first four lines to convert them into a sextet. Compared with their originals, better than half of the verses in Choice are close to their source verses. This is especially true of those emblems which share a page with another emblem; the four main groups of double emblems on each page are pp. 50-55, 138-139, 182-183, and 188-191. Because of the limitation of space below each of the two woodcuts, most of the verses take the form of a single sextet or of a couplet of poulter's measure; consequently, little room is left for much expansion. Verses varying from their sources are of two types; abridgement and expansion. Because of the set patterns in the source verses—e.g., Junius' verse is always in tetrastich, La Perrière's always in dizain—Whitney tended to expand on Junius' verse but held to a length similar to that of La Perrière. Verses from Alciati and Sambucus vary greatly in length—e.g., as short as a distich to a verse of 26 lines in Alciati, whereas no verse from Sambucus is shorter than 18 lines. Thus, some of the most drastic abridgements as well as expansions in Choice are from these two sources. As always, abridgements keep the essential morals of their sources; only the details and allusions have been eliminated or simplified. Expansion outnumbers abridgement three to one, and is used most commonly for amplification of moral and its application. Whenever the subject of the emblem is a commonplace, therefore inexhaustible in its classical allusions and illustrations, Whitney tends to enlarge his verse extensively. For instance, the subject of Wh 60 is "Pythagoras enjoining silence," that of Wh 65 is "Aeneas carrying his father out of Troy," that of Wh 79 is "Lais with musk-cat," that of Wh 122 is "Chaos," that of Wh 141 is "Brasidas' shield," that of Wh 194 is "Terror after death" —all are commonplaces and offer a chance for Whitney to exhibit his learning. In particular, on the subject of chaos, he expanded the verse from Aneau's 8-line stanza to 25 couplets in poulter's measure. On the subject of false friendship, he expanded Aneau's tetrastich into 6 sextets, following Aneau only in the first sextet where Brasidas' death through overtrusting his shield is recounted. Of greater originality are expansions which are the result of editorial and personal demands. Wh 1 and Wh 108, introducing respectively the first and the second parts of Choice , differ not only in length but also in substance from their sources. Ostensibly with its motto from Par 72 and its woodcut and verse from Jun (14), Wh 1 is given over to praising Queen Elizabeth, comparing her to the "mightie Spyre" and the Anglican church to the entwining ivy. The ivy is made to speak: I, that of late with stormes was almoste spent, And brused sore with Tirants bluddie bloes, Whome fire, and sworde, with persecution rent, And nowe sett free, and ouerlooke my foes, And whiles thow raignst, oh most renowmed Queene By thie supporte my blossome shall bee greene. Based loosely on Per (1), the first sextet in Wh 108 tells what Whitney intends to do in the second part of Choice : The former parte, nowe paste, of this my booke, The seconde parte in order doth insue: Which, I beginne with Ianvs double looke, That as hee sees, the yeares both oulde, and newe, So, with regarde, I may these partes behoulde, Perusinge ofte, the newe, and eeke the oulde. As admonished by Janus to improve upon the past, Whitney says in the second sextet that he is determined to make improvements: "Euen so, my selfe suruayghinge what is past; | With greater heede, may take in hande the laste"—a promise that is not unfulfilled in Choice . This is especially true in view of the large number of emblems he added to the second part along with many "newly devised" emblems. A purely personal note is added towards the end of Wh 134, which has expanded the 20-line verse in Alc (117) into 5 sextets. On the subject of different colors, some are national; others are local and professional. Since the woodcut depicts a dyer, and since England was known for exhibiting few colors, Whitney added two more sextets to brag about England's having Edward Dyer, "Who, alwaies hathe so fine, and freshe, a hewe, | That in their landes, the like is not to vewe." In the same vein, Wh 196 is dedicated to Dyer and he is praised along with Surrey and Sidney. What is striking in this emblem is the extent of the expansion; Whitney expanded the usual tetrastich in Jun (60) into a verse of 30 couplets in poulter's measure. Equally extensive is the change of the tetrastich in Alc (148) into 8 sextets, praising Richard Cotton (to whom Wh 200 is dedicated) and his family seat at Cumbermaire (or Combermere), around which Whitney spent his youth. The beehive in the woodcut is compared to Combermere and Whitney himself to the bee, and the emblem elicits from him a nostalgic longing. Dedicated "To my countrimen of the Namptwiche in Cesshire," the familiar emblem of the phoenix rising out of its funeral pyre (Wh 177 "Vnica semper auis") is used to commemorate the rebuilding of the town of Nantwich which was razed by fire (see Green, p. 372). These verses, then, not only differ drastically in length from their respective sources, but also diverge in substance from their models. Indeed, the source verses are nothing more than an excuse for Whitney to launch his original versifying at great length. This is not to infer that Whitney could not have written original verses on his own; for in fact, the two verses in praise of the two Dudley brothers (one of 5 sextets, the other of 4 sextets and its alternative verse of 6 couplets in poulter's measure [ Choice , pp. 106-107]), the 11 sextets in honor of Sir Philip Sidney (pp. 109-110), the alternate naked emblem Wh 61, and the last emblem Wh 230 are all of Whitney's own composition. Although Whitney's originality varies according to the demands of his emblems, he could be as faithful to his source as he wished. A good example of this flexibility is Wh 133, where the verse is short and may be quoted in full: Loe here the vine dothe claspe, to prudent Pallas tree, The league is nought, for virgines wise, doe Bacchus frendship flee, Alcia. Quid me vexatis ramis? Sum Palladis arbor, Auferte hinc botros, virgo fugit Bromium. Englished so. Why vexe yee mee yee boughes? since I am Pallas tree: Remoue awaie your clusters hence, the virgin wine doth flee. The literal English translation of the distich from Alciati is considerably improved when the direct discourse is changed into the indirect statement above the Latin lines. A verse of identical formula is in the MS on fol. 72 v , which is not used in Choice ; the Latin distich is first rendered into a literal English translation and then rewritten in a freer paraphrase. A similar instance in Choice is Wh 139b, where the original distich from Alciati is recorded in the margin: "Spes, simul &amp; Nemesis, nostris altaribus adsunt; | Scilicet vt speres non nisi quod liceat," and is translated into English: "Here Nemesis, and Hope: our deedes doe rightlie trie, | Which warnes vs, not to hope for that, which iustice doth denie." Lack of space, in this case, seems to have forced Whitney to quote the original in the margin; nevertheless, he obviously intended for his reader to appreciate his rendering of the original. Whitney's ability to continue to improve upon what he had written can be seen nowhere more clearly than in his revising the MS verses for the printed edition. Significant improvements are made when single lines are altered to render their meaning more explicit. Folio 10, "Sithe tyme at lengthe will sett hir vp alofte" is modified to "Bycause at lengthe, shee shall be sett alofte" in Wh 4, avoiding the needless repetition of "Tyme" in the previous lines. Similarly, "And vp alofte Vulcanus dothe incroache" (fol. 14) from Sam 206 "Mulciber intus agit" is changed to "And to the Toppe, deuowring flames incroache" (Wh 7); "For thie, his houndes did make him straight theire praie" (fol. 26 v ) to "But straighte his howndes did rente hym, for their praie" (Wh 15); "Yit hurtefull weedes emongst the same do growe" (fol. 30 v ) to "The hurtfull tares, and dernell ofte doe growe" (Wh 68); "No foe so fell nor halfe so full of spite" (fol. 34 v ) to "No mortall foe so full of poysoned spite" (Wh 144); and "Theie slippe, &amp; downe in duste theire glorie lyes" (fol. 35) to "Their fall is wrought, by thinges they doe dispise" (Wh 78). This last change is especially well thought out because "dispise" rhymes with "skies" of the previous line—"Leste when theire mindes, so mounte vnto the skies"—in a causal relationship; i.e., because they despise meaner things, their minds do mount towards the skies. Better rhyming is the cause for modifying an entire couplet: e.g., "Thus hoape of life, &amp; feare of future lack | Houldes vp his chinne though loaden with his pack" (fol. 10 v ) to "Thus, hope of life, and loue vnto his goods, | Houldes vp his chinne, with burthen in the floods" (Wh 179). Aside from the greater emphasis on the avarice of this merchant through "loue vnto his goods" instead of "feare of future lack" and the closer description of the woodcut through "with burthen in the floods" instead of "though loaden with his pack," the rhyme "goods | floods" avoids the clumsy repetition of "wracke | back" in the previous lines. Similarly: "First trye, then truste: all sugred speeche eschue | The snake oft lyes in flowers of fresshist hue" (fol. 67) to "First trye, then truste: like goulde, the copper showes: | And NERO ofte, in NVMAS clothinge goes" (Wh 150); here the last line appears to have been changed first to add a historical allusion, necessitating the change of the second half of the previous line for the sake of rhyme. As these lines are the final couplet, normally containing the moral of the emblem, the changes made by Whitney tend to bring greater terseness and finality to them. Other such examples are: "Then, thoughe thou be like beares misshapen whelpe, | Yit haue no doute for arte maie nature helpe" (fol. 55) to "Then haue no doubt, for arte maie nature helpe | Thinke how the beare doth forme her vglye whelpe"—the finality achieved simply by reversing the order of these two lines and rewording the last line (Wh 92); "Oh freendes refraine the sentence of this iudge, | Like what he loath'de, though you have Venus grudge" (fol. 71 v ) to "But yet the wise this iudgement rashe deride, | And sentence giue on prudent PALLAS side" (Wh 83); "Theise are the foes that moste our hartes appall, | The other foes wee wey them not at all" (fol. 76 v ) to "No foe so fell, (as BIAS wise declares) | As man to man, when mischeife hee prepares" (Wh 124). More extensive changes, involving an entire sextet, are equally frequent (see fol. 15 v &amp; Wh 9, fol. 29 v &amp; Wh 143, fol. 38b &amp; Wh 125, fol. 41 &amp; Wh 142, fol. 52 v &amp; Wh 108). Two examples suffice. In Wh 140, the first sextet is revised from the version in the MS (fol. 78): The dogge, whose strengthe dothe other dogges surpasse, And dare assaie the bruttissh bull or beare, Is lod'ned ofte with burthens like an asse Or drawes the carte, &amp; forc'de the yoake to weare; Where little dogges do lende him manie a snatche, When as, before, theie durste not with him matche In Choice , the sextet reads: The bandogge, fitte to matche the bull, or beare, With burthens greate, is loden euery daye: Or drawes the carte, and forc'd the yoke to weare: Where littell dogges doe passe their time in playe: And ofte, are bould to barke, and eeke to bite, When as before, they trembled at his sighte. The economy resulting from combining the thoughts in the first four lines in the MS into three lines in Choice enabled Whitney to devote three, instead of two, lines to the behavior of the little dogs. The revision renders the sextet much more descriptive of the woodcut; indeed the entire verse is closer to the woodcut than that in the MS. For instance, in the second sextet, the last couplet "For they maie sleepe vppon their mistris lappes | And at the board be fedd with daintie scrappes" is changed into "For they maie sleepe vppon their mistris bedde, | And on their lappes, with daynties still bee fedde" (see Wh 140). Despite these changes both sextets in both versions follow Sambucus' original fairly closely. The third sextet, as has been dealt with above, is Whitney's own to support the motto. Finally, in fol. 69 v the second sextet on the image of Bacchus receives extensive rewriting in Wh 187; especially, the final couplet had to be changed else Whitney would have offended his host countrymen: Then shunne the sorte that bragge of drinking mutch, Thou, English arte, leave that vnto the Dutch. Keeping the first line intact except altering the spelling of "mutch" to "muche," Whitney cleverly substituted for the second "Seeke other frendes, and ioyne not handes with suche." Apart from these because of necessity, the majority of changes in verse are made to improve readability and bring about greater harmony among the emblematic components. Frequently, moreover, expansions of verse are to exhibit Whitney's learning which can also be seen in his marginal annotations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5. Purposes of Annotations The stated purposes of marginal annotations in Choice are given in Whitney's letter "To the Reader." "I haue now in diuerse places, quoted in the margent," he writes, "some sentẽces in Latin, &amp; such verses as I thoughte did beste fit the seuerall matters I wratte of. . . . First I noted the same in Latin, to helpe . . . some of my acquaintaunce wheare this booke was imprinted, who hauinge no taste in the Englishe tonge, yet weare earnestly addicted to the vnderstandinge hereof: and also, wheare I founde any verse, or sayinge agreable with the matter, I did gather the same of purpose for my owne memorie, not doubtinge but the same may bee also frutefull to others" (sig. * * 3 v ). The first objective, to help his Dutch friends, is interesting. Although he stayed in Leyden only about a year—having arrived there in the new year of 1586 and left with Leicester in mid-November of the same year—Whitney made a number of friends among the literati associated with the University of Leyden: besides the Dousas and Francis Raphelengius, the printer of Choice , there were the Greek professor Bonaventura Vulcanius, the famous historian Justus Lipsius, and Peter Colvius, the editor of Apuleius; each of these scholars wrote a commendatory verse for Choice . Since the majority of the woodcuts in Choice had been used by the Plantin press previously in printing the emblem-books of Alciati, Sambucus, Junius, Paradin, and Faernus, these Dutch friends of Whitney would no doubt have been familiar with most of the woodcuts in Choice . Together with the Latin mottoes, the Latin marginalia would, moreover, enable these readers to appreciate its contents, even though they might not be able fully to understand its English verse. The second objective, to help Whitney himself remember those Latin verses and sayings which "may bee also frutefull to others," is a common practice. That it was the humanists' task to edit ancient texts, to provide glosses, to write erudite commentaries, and to compile illuminating compendia by ancient authors is also well known. The practice of adding copious marginalia to a text by the author himself or notes by a commentator is also widespread. Beginning with the 1549 French, Spanish, and Latin editions of Alciati's Emblemata the emblems were accompanied with brief notes, epimythiae or "affabulationes" by Barthélemy Aneau, Franciscus Sanctius, and Sebastian Stockhamer. 23 Claude Mignault's copious commentaries (written in 1571) began to accompany the Emblemata with the 1573 Plantin edition, and further expansions were made by Pignorius, Morell, and Thuilius to the massive 1621 Padua edition. As usual, the simple notes and glosses begin with the modest aim of elucidating the obscure, but soon develop into copious commentaries belaboring the commonplace by amassing, ad infinitem , quotations from ancient authors. Frequently, marginalia become a means, and often the unstated purpose, of exhibiting the author's or the commentator's knowledge of the common funds of learning. By far Ovid is the most frequently cited author: 75 times, covering all of his major writings. He is followed by Horace (40), the Bible (22), Reusner (22). Cited 16 times are Virgil and Alciati, 14 times is Propertius, 13 times are Aelianus and Pliny, and 12 times are Claudius and Seneca. A majority of the authors are those of Greek and Latin classics well-known to every sixteenth-century educated reader. 24 Among Renaissance authors are Aeneas Silvius (Pope Pius II), Angelo Poliziano Ambrogini (Politianus), Coelius Augustinus Curio, Joachim du Bellay, Antonio de Guevara, William Lily, Sir Thomas More, Erasmus, Georgius Sabinus. Emblematists directly quoted, besides Reusner and Alciati, are Aneau 5 times, and Junius and Sambucus each once. Over five-sixths of the total 414 annotations are the result of Whitney's direct gleaning from his authors; in the remaining one-sixth, some 66 times, Whitney borrowed from commentaries and marginalia of his source emblem-books. Six times he acknowledged borrowing from Claude Mignault, but 57 other times he did not credit Mignault for his annotations, and 3 times he took from Paradin's marginalia without acknowledgement. A few examples of his unacknowledged borrowings from Mignault will reveal Whitney's interesting ways of culling from others. To begin with the simplest. Wh 33 has an end verse of two lines by Borbonius; both the author and the verse are noted by Mignault, who introduces the quote thus: "Sed breuissime Borbonius noster, vno disticho etc." (p. 300). 25 Mignault's comment on Alc (167)—"quod Laocoon apud Virgil confirmat, cum a Troianis equum dole relictum nequaquam in vrbem recipiendum censet"—is simplified by Whitney into a marginal note: "Lacoon apud Virgilium lib. Aeneid.2. sic de equo, loquitur Troianis," and the original quote from Virgil by Mignault (pp. 751f. misnumbered for 758f.) O miseri, qua tanta insania, ciues? Creditis auectos hostes? aut vlla putatis Dona carere dolis Danaum, &amp;c. . . &amp; deine Quicquid id est, timeo Danaos, &amp; dona ferentes, is reduced to ". . . aut vlla putatis | Dona carere dolis Danaum, &amp;c." as an end verse in Wh 37. Wh 99 from Alc (197) notes in the margin two lines from Virgil's Aeneid , which may have been borrowed from Mignault, whose notes run as follows: ". . . hoc factum Mezentio dignum, qui mortua , vt inquit Maro, -----iungebat corpora viuis Componens manibusque manus, atque oribus ora." (p. 884) With a slight editorial interpolation, Whitney identified the specific book from the Aeneid , Book 8, and quoted in the margin the entire distich. Not infrequently, Whitney went beyond the simple reference given by Mignault as to his source and provided detailed and at times pedantic documentations. For Alc (148) on the beehive, Mignault cited Aelian.historiae anima.1. &amp; 5., but Whitney in Wh 200 gave more in his margin: Aelian. de anima.lib.1.ca.59. &amp; 60. Et lib.5.cap.11. Et Plin.Natural.hist.lib.11.cap.5. &amp; 16. At times, Whitney's use of Mignault may be in doubt, especially when Mignault cites verses from Aneau's Picta Poesis from which Whitney copied six emblems for the MS and two more for Choice . Whereas he certainly could have copied these verses still from Mignault, it is perhaps more likely that he went directly to Aneau (see Wh 15 and Wh 57). At other times, along with Mignault's reference, Whitney added his own. For instance, Whitney added Erasmus and Tertullianus to Wh 202 in addition to Diogenes and Gellius cited by Mignault in Alc (86). Instead of following Mignault's lead in commenting on Alc (159) with a quotation from Ovid's Ponti (III, i) to illustrate the theme of "Amicitia, etiam post mortem durans," Whitney chose as his end verse a passage from the next epistle (to Cotta, III, ii) which, because of its reference to the famous friendship between Orestes and Pylades, better elucidates the thought in the second sextet of Wh 62. 26 Whitney can work independently. When the annotations are used, however, to gloss a name or an object, and when these are found in Mignault, Whitney did not hesitate to borrow silently from the commentator. In glossing the names of Epaminondas and Simonides in the second sextet of Wh 60, Whitney copied from Mignault's gloss: "Meaito apud Pindarum celebratur, . . . &amp; illud Simonidis, Locutum fuisse poenitur, tacuisse vero numquam" (p. 98). In glossing Pittacus' flower in Wh 130, Whitney borrowed part of Mignault's long note: "Symbolum autem prioris est gith, nigerrimum semen optimumque, excitatissimi odoris, quo minomo sumpto in cibis dat saporis gratiam: Largius autem, venenum exhibet. Plerique suspicantur esse minutulum piper, quod poyuretum nostri vocant &amp; pharmacopolae Nigellam Romanam" (p. 842). In addition to these unacknowledged borrowings from Mignault, there are authors or passages Whitney neglected to identify. For example, in Wh 14, the end verse from Horace is taken from Carmina , 3.6; in Wh 17, the end verse from Ovid is taken from Ars amatoria , Book 3, lines 373ff. The quotation from William Lily in Wh 60, "Est vitae ac pariter ianua lingua necis," is taken from "carmen de moribus" in A Short Introduction to Grammar (sigs. D6 v -D8 r ). The end verse in Wh 138a is from Martial's "Falx," in Epigrammata , 14.34. Quotations without proper identification are, however, infrequent. Despite these minor oversights and unacknowledged borrowings, the majority of Whitney's annotations do reflect his familiarity with the common funds of learning of his day. Furthermore, the marginalia serve yet another purpose; for the modern student attempting to trace the literary or pictorial sources of Whitney's "newly devised" emblems, the marginal notes sometimes provide the only clues.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6. "Newly Devised" Emblems Whitney took great pains in calling attention to the fact that a number of emblems in both the MS and Choice were newly devised. In the "Epistle Dedicatorie" to the Earl of Leicester, he writes: "I hope it shalbee the more delightfull, bicause none to my knowledge, hathe assayed the same before: &amp;, for that diuers of the inuentiõs are of my owne slender workmanship." In the title-page to Choice , the new inventions are underscored after the derivative nature of the entire collection is announced: "For the moste parte gathered out of sundrie writers, | Englished and Moralized. | AND DIVERS NEWLY DEVISED, | by Geffrey Whitney." Unwilling, as it were, to let the fact of his having devised some new emblems slip past his reader going into the second part of Choice , he emphasizes it again in the half-title, this time by reducing the statement "For the most parte gathered out of sundrie writers" to simply "gathered." The fact that fourteen out of the fifteen "newly devised" emblems appear in the second part is therefore accurately reflected in "And diuerse newlie deuised" on the half-title. In the order in which they appear in Choice , with MS folio numbers following in square brackets, these fifteen emblems are: 95[29] 112[95] 114 129[77 v ] 131[80] 145[34] 161 167[94b] 168a[60 v a] 184[36] 185 198[19] 203[98 v ] 225 230 Strangely, little study has hitherto been made on these emblems, beyond listing them either as "untraced" or "newly devised"; especially lacking is an attempt to trace their non-emblematic pictorial or textual sources. The present effort will begin with those emblems that are based on simple, definite pictorial or textual sources, continue with those that are based on more complex and eclectic sources, and end with those that are based on less certain, textual sources only. Since ten of the fifteen are in the MS, any changes in the process of converting from one version to another will again be noted. Two "newly devised" emblems that have definite pictorial sources are Wh 203 and Wh 112. Wh 203, "A ship drawn by Providence," is based on the crest to Sir Francis Drake's coat of arms. According to Arthur Charles Fox-Davies in The Art of Heraldry , the arms are: "Sable, a fess wavy between two stars argent. Crest: a ship under reef, drawn round a terrestrial globe with a cable by a hand issuing from clouds all proper." 27 The last detail signifies divine assistance given to Drake during his circumnavigation (1577-1580) and is highlighted above the ship by the motto "Auxilio divino" (Fig. 31), 28 which Whitney borrowed for his emblem. The emblem in praise of Sir Francis Drake is dedicated to his cousin, Richard Drake, and concerns itself with celebrating Sir Francis' seamanship and God's providential help. The MS artist simply transposed the crest into a drawing, which the Choice artist copied faithfully (as is the case of all the "newly devised" emblems when there are no other models). The surrounding sun, moon, stars, and clouds were apparently added to support the verse. Written in poulter's measure, the poem begins by emphasizing the meteorological dangers that beset Drake's voyages: "Throvghe scorchinge heate, throughe coulde, in stormes, and tempests force, | By ragged rocks, by shelfes, and sandes: this Knighte did keepe his course." The reason for Drake's constancy is that "God was on his side," and the reason for his success is that he made it "By helpe of power deuine." Whitney goes on to compare the enchantment by which Medea helped Jason win the golden fleece (marginal note: Ouid.Met.lib.7) with the divine help given to Drake and belittles the small conquest of Jason. He concludes by challenging other world explorers to bring golden sands back from Ganges and by urging those stay-at-homes to give maximum praises to Drake for his incomparable feats. Wh 112, "The Schoolmaster of Faleria," with its motto of "Habet &amp; bellum suas leges" is based upon Plutarch's life of Furius Camillus. Specifically, Whitney took the motto out of a speech by Camillus, which he quotes in toto in the margin, a portion of which reads: ". . . &amp; tamen apud bonos viros, habentur etiam belli quaedam leges. . . ." Of greater significance is the fact that Whitney also cited in the margin the precise edition from which this speech was extracted: "Verba Camilli apud Plutarchum. Xylandro interprete." This edition of Plutarch is probably that published by Sigismund Feyerabendt at Frankfort on the Main in 1580. It is decorated with large woodcuts designed by Jost Amman. Whitney followed this Latin version of Plutarch's account closely, especially in the first three lines of the last sextet, describing the whipping of the schoolmaster by his students on orders of Camillus: "Haec postquam dixit, lictoribus mandauit, vt proditori vestes deriperent, manusque in tergum revincirent: pueris autem virgas flagellaque darent, quibus eum ferientes in vrbem compellerent" (fol. 43 v ). This may be further compared with the equally faithful rendering from Amyot's French version by Sir Thomas North: "Therefore he commaunded his sergeants to teare the clothes of the backe of this vile schoolemaster, and to binde his hands behinde him: and that they should geve the children roodes and whippes in their handes, to whippe the traitour backe againe into the cittie . . . that had thus betrayed them and grieved their parents." Although in Whitney's verse the binding of the schoolmaster's hands has been omitted, the MS artist included this detail in his drawing as he copied faithfully from Amman's design. In reducing the original large woodcut of 109 x 148 mm. (4¼ x 5⅞”) into 67 x 95 mm. (2⅝ x 3¾”), he lessened the number of students from eight to six and eliminated the troops on the battlements as well as a burning town in the background (Figs. 32, 33). In further reducing the MS drawing into a square of 57 mm. (2¼”), the Choice artist had to eliminate further the city gate and a soldier standing in front of it, but he managed to restore the number of students to the original eight—another instance of his copying directly from the original model (Fig. 34). As a result, the woodcut of Wh 112 differs much from the original; yet, with Camillus on horseback in the background and the whipping of the schoolmaster by his students in the center unchanged, it represents adequately both the verse and the moral of this "newly devised" emblem. 29 There are four emblems whose pictorial sources are not so definite; all of them are however related in a greater or lesser degree to Aesop's fables or their analogues. Wh 184 and Wh 95 may have been based on contemporary Aesopic illustrations even though their woodcuts differ significantly from their models, whereas Wh 145 and Wh 161 are only analogus to two extant fables. The woodcut in Wh 184, "Ox &amp; the cur," diverges noticeably from the design in Freitag's Mythologia Ethica (1579) which Green suggested as a source. The etching in Freitag depicts this Aesop's fable of "dog in the manger" as taking place out of doors. Outside a farmhouse, the snarling dog occupies a haystack under what appears to be a lean-to, whereas Whitney's woodcut shows the two animals indoors with the dog inside the manger, refusing to allow the ox to feed. Since illustrated editions of Aesop's fables were readily available in Whitney's days—in fact, no fewer than five editions were printed by Plantin between 1560 and 1581 30 —it is highly likely that the MS artist modeled his drawing after one of the illustrations in Aesop of the same fable. The fact remains, however, that the resultant woodcut of Wh 184 has a unique design unlike any of its probable models (Figs. 36-38). 31 It is not inconceivable that the MS artist who signed the drawing with his monogram [HA] devised it deliberately differently from his Aesopic models. Similar to Wh 184 in having a ready-to-hand model in Aesop is Wh 95, "De Inuido &amp; Auaro, iocosum," although its woodcut differs even more significantly from its model than that of Wh 184. "Cupidus et Invidus," one of the five fables by Avianus, begins with Jupiter sending Phoebus to learn the dubious minds of men, and its illustration shows the envious man, his one eye plucked out, talking to Jupiter while a man (Phoebus in disguise?) with a dagger is plucking out both eyes of the covetous man lying on the ground (Fig. 39). The MS motto differs from that of Wh 95 in that it is more explicit of the moral: "Mutua auaritiae &amp; inuidiae pœna," but the drawing is faithfully copied by the Choice artist. It depicts the envious man pointing at three eyes on the ground in front of him to the covetous man who is blinded in both eyes (Fig. 40). Moreover, the verse differs from the text of the fable in that Wh 95 plunges into the terms right away: "The Goddes agreed, two men their wishe should haue. . . ." According to Whitney's marginal annotation (Auth. de Gueuara in Epistolis suis), his verse is based on the retelling of the same fable in one letter from Antonio de Guevara's collection of familiar epistles. In a contemporary English translation by Geffray Fenton entitled the Golden Epistles (1575), this letter has the caption of "One friend writeth to another of the rage of Envie, and the nature thereof," in which the original fable is greatly expanded and extensively moralized. Since this particular letter is not found in the original Spanish collection nor in subsequent Italian, French and English translations except in Fenton 32 and since, more importantly, the wordings in Fenton are at times similar to those of Wh 95, it is highly probable that Whitney used this version. Quoted below is the relevant portion with similar wordings from Whitney in quotes interpolated in square brackets: . . . Whereupon he [the angel] willed them to aske what they would, and who made the first demaund should not onely haue fully all that he required, but the other should haue forthwith double as much. The one of these . . . was a couetous man, and the other an envious man, betwene whom this offer of the Angell bred no small contention ["They longe did striue, who shoulde the firste demaunde"]. For, the couetous man, who dwelles alwayes insatiable in the desire of gaine, would not make the first demaund, hauing regard to the wordes of the Angell promising double to the second ]"The Couetous man refus'de, bicause his mate, | Shoulde haue his gifte then doubled out of handes"[. The envious man, on the other-side, whose condicion is to desire that no good happen to an other, vsed scilence, determining rather to loase the benefite of the first demaund, then that his companion should enioye the double of his gaine. . . . For, being in this conflict who should aske first, and that of necessitie a demaunde must be made, the enuious man, thinking by the sufferance of simple harme in himselfe, to bring about double hurt to his fellowe, desired of the Angell that one of his eyes might bee put out, wherewith at the instant he lost one eye, and his companion was made blind of both (fol. 139 r-v ). Apart from the obvious difference in Whitney, who has the gods compel the envious man to begin: "Wherefore the Goddes . . . did commaunde, th'Enuious man beginne," the most important similarity is that the two men receive instantaneously what they have been promised: "Which beinge say'd, he did his wishe obtaine: | So but one eye, was lefte vnto them twaine." In the original fable, Phoebus laughs on hearing the envious man's request and goes back to Jupiter to report on that man's malice, and the moral of the fable weighs heavily against the sin of envy: Tum sortem sapiens humanam risit Apollo, Invidiaeque malum rettulit ipse Iovi, Quae, dum proventis aliorum gaudet iniquis, Laetior infelix et sua damna cupit. Although the purpose of the letter in the Golden Epistles is also to illustrate the evils of envy, in its conclusion the writer introduces the element, borrowed by Whitney, of the envious man being used by the gods as a scourge of the covetous man: "So that where the one refused to bee satisfied with that which sufficed, the other was raysed as a scourge of his insatiable desires ['Wherefore the Goddes did plague him for his sinne'] and the one as wretched in spite ['who did not craue, what Midas cheife did choose, | Because his frende, the fruite thereof should finde'], as his companion in couetousneese, the one became the iust instrument of reuenge to another: A iustice of due force against such as striue in the quarrell of enuie and couetousness, both which, being contagious infections in the nature of man, the one poysoneth his soule, and the other consumes and dries up his body: of all other vices in the world, enuie is the most auncient, of most custome, and of greatest continuance, yea euen to the end of the world" (fols. 139 v -140 r ). Touching also upon the evils of both sins, Whitney however singles out covetousness: See heare how vile, theise caytiffes doe appeare, To God, and man: but chieflie (as wee see) The Couetous man, who hurteth farre, and neare. Where spyteful men, theire owne tormentors bee. But bothe be bad, and he that is the beste, God keepe him thence, where honest men doe reste. Quoting thus at length from the textual source of Whitney's verse in Wh 95 and finding no similar pictorial source for its woodcut leads to but one conclusion: the MS artist drew his picture on the basis of Whitney's verse alone. The genius of the artist is nowhere more cleverly seen than in the drawing of the three eyes on the ground, symbolizing the instant fulfillment of sinful retribution. This same artist who signed his name with [HA] also drew the picture of "In curiosos" on fol. 34, later Wh 145. This emblem is not based on an Aesopic fable but represents perhaps an analogue of the fable about an ape imitating the fishermen and getting entangled in their nets. 33 Interestingly enough its woodcut is similar to one of the 60 emblems in Hernando de Soto's Emblemas moralizados . 34 It is not entirely improbable that Hernando de Soto might have copied from Choice , even though it is more likely that both artists based their emblems on a common source now untraceable. Nonetheless, it is equally possible that the MS artist drew the picture solely on the basis of the verse in Wh 145, as he had done for Wh 95. Wh 161, "The sick fox &amp; the lion," is unique in that it borrows its motto "Ars deluditur arte" from Sam 42, yet its woodcut has nothing in common with that in Sambucus. The latter shows a frog holding a stick in its mouth in order to avoid being swallowed by a menacing fish, whereas Wh 161 depicts a lion trying to trick a sick fox into letting him lick the patient with his allegedly "medicinal" tongue. It is probable that Whitney turned to his own Wh 210, "Lion feigning sickness," for an indirect pictorial model. While Wh 210 is based on one of the standard Aesop's fables, 35 the reversing of roles in Wh 161 is not to be found in Aesop or in any of its later additions. The nearest analogue could be the fable concerning a wolf and a sick ass which normally follows the sick lion and the fox in most collections of Aesop (Caxton, Book IV, Fable 12). Unlike Whitney's fox, however, the sick ass, true to his nature, allows the wolf to lick his wounds and so loses his life. Moreover, Wh 161 and Wh 210 have similar outcomes, the fox outwitting the lion in both instances, as they are given similar mottoes: "Ars deluditur arte" and "Fraus meretur fraudem." It is highly probable, therefore, that Whitney instructed the Choice artist to devise a new emblem by exchanging the positions of the lion and the fox in Wh 210 for the woodcut of Wh 161. Two "newly devised" emblems (Wh 198 and Wh 114) base their woodcuts on textual sources, although both might have partial emblematic sources. Diogenes' living in a "tonne" and King Alexander's visiting him are the subject of one of the 74 copperplates engraved by Geerhardt de Jode, in a collection of scenes from human lives called Μιχροχόσμοζ or Parvus Mundus . 36 It is probable that the MS artist could have modeled his design partially on the plate by de Jode. However, Whitney's emblem is far from being simply a lesson on Diogenes' contentment alone. "Animus, non res" is illustrated in the second sextet with the lives of three wisemen, Diogenes, Bias, and Codrus. The four sextets, other than the first, all have copious notes to suggest the sources of Whitney's ideas. Especially, the third and fourth sextets are no more than translations of quotations respectively from Horace's Epistle to Lollius Maximus (I, ll. 51-53) and Ausonius' Septem Sapientum Sententiae (1. Bias Prieneus). But the design of the drawing is based on the second sextet and the last two lines of the fourth sextet: Diogenes, within a tonne did dwell, No choice of place, nor store of pelfe he had; And all his goodes, coulde Bias beare right well, And Codrvs had small cates, his harte to gladde His meate was rootes: his table, was a stoole, Yet these for witte, did set the worlde to school? . . . . . . . . . Which proues: the man was ritcher in the tonne, Then was the Kinge, that manie landes had wonne. The first two and the last two lines above form the basis of Diogenes and King Alexander for which Whitney cites in the margin Erasmus' adage "vita doliaris" as his source. Codrus and his stool, to the right of Diogenes' tun, are more difficult to identify. Whitney's marginal note suggests Juvenal's Satyre (III, 10) as source: "Tota domus Codri rheda componitur vna." There is no mention in Juvenal of Codrus' meat being roots and his table being a stool. It is possible that Whitney found the ideas about the roots and the stool in sources other than Juvenal. Anyway, in designing the picture of contentment in poverty, the MS artist added Codrus and his stool with roots scattered in front of it to a rather commonplace emblematic representation of Diogenes. Inasmuch as Codrus is new, this emblem may properly be considered as "newly devised." According to the marginalia, the account in Wh 114 of Attilius' heroic suffering of torture and death as a result of his keeping faith even with his enemies, as reflected in the motto "Hostis etiam seruanda fides," is based on those of Nepos, Eutropius, Italicus, and Gellius. From Cornelius Nepos' De viri illustres (Paris, 1500, Cap. xl) Whitney took for the first sextet of his verse the details of Attilius' success in overcoming two hundred thousand men, three score ships and two hundred towns in his African campaigns. The capture of Attilius by Xantippus and imprisonment at Carthage, and his return to Rome for the truce and exchange of prisoners of war, and his advice against the enemy's proposals are also elaborated in Flavius Eutropius' Breviarium historiae Romanorum . In a contemporary translation of the brief history by Nicolas Haward, Eutropius' account is rendered as follows: "And as for him, he was not worthye to be so muche esteamed (being now very aged) that for his cause, and the redeminge of a fewe others whyche were detained prisonners, at Carthage, so many thousand of their enemies should be restored. Regulus sone after, returned to Carthage: whome the Romaynes offered to detaine still at Rome. But hee denied that he woulde remayne in that city, in which he could not haue the name of an honest Citezen, sith that he had so long bene among the Carthaginiens. Whom (after his returne to Carthage,) the Carthaginiens with most cruel tormẽts put to death." 37 In adapting this account for his second and third sextets, Whitney omitted several interesting details concerning Attilius' refusal to consider himself an honest Roman citizen because of his long captivity in Carthage, his unwillingness to live with his wife Marcia, and his persuasion of the Roman Senate not to grant a truce to the Carthaginians; instead, he emphasized Attilius' love for his own country and his insistence on returning to Carthage to keep his words. For the details of Attilius' torture, which Eutropius did not choose to elaborate, Whitney had to rely on the story of Aulus Gellius' Noctes Atticae , especially for the statement in his verse on Attilius' "mangled eies, the Sonne all daye assailes"; for the details of his death, Whitney borrowed from both Nepos and Italicus. These two details, the manners of torture and death, are extremely important because they form the bases of Whitney's woodcut. The bright sun at the upper left corner of the picture shines mercilessly upon Attilius' eyes, the lids of which have been pulled apart and sewn fast so that they cannot be closed. This form of torture is based on the account by Aelius Tubero in his Historiis from which Gellius quotes: "'In atras,' inquit, 'et profundas tenegras eum claudebant ac diu post, ubi erat uisus sol ardentissimus, repente educebant et aduersus ictus solis oppositum continebant atque intendere in caelum oculos cogebant. Palpebras quoque eius, ne coniuere posset, sursum ac deorsum diductas insuebant,'" ( Noctes Atticae , VII, iv, 2). Nepos describes Attilius' death briefly at the end of his account mentioning specifically the wooden box with nails all around inside into which the Roman general was thrust. So, in greater detail it is described by Italicus, 38 who records Marus' narration of Attilius' death to the latter's son Serranus. There being no known illustration of Attilius' torture in quite the same manner as in Whitney's woodcut, 39 it is highly probable that the Choice artist drew the picture on the basis of the verse alone. What is especially significant about this verse is its highly eclectic nature, based as it is on the accounts of Nepos, Eutropius, Italicus, and Gellius. Equally eclectic is the "newly devised" woodcut of Wh 225. It seems to have been based on three separate emblems from Montenay. As has been pointed out in the section on woodcut designs, there are nine emblems in Choice that are copied from models in Montenay's Emblèmes ou devises chrestiennes . All except Wh 225 are fairly close copies of their models (as seen in Figs. 27-30). For the design of "Superest quod suprà est" (Wh 225) the Choice artist seems to have made a composite drawing from Mon (12), Mon (56), and Mon (63). There are three key ingredients in Whitney's emblem whose single couplet in poulter's measure quotes the Christian wayfarer as saying: "Adewe deceiptfull worlde, thy pleasures I detest: | Nowe, others with thy showes delude; my hope in heauen doth rest." To represent "heauen" the artist uses the Hebrew word Yahweh encircled by radiance and clouds; to depict the "deceiptfull worlde," he uses a globe; and the speaker of the couplet just quoted is identified as a pilgrim whose back is turned away from the globe on the ground and whose face is uplifted towards the sky where the word Yahweh shines above the clouds, and towards that direction he is walking with a long staff (Fig. 43). Now, although the artist has copied eight other emblems from Montenay, there is none among the one hundred emblems of Montenay that comes close to having all these ingredients in one picture. The closest model is Mon (63) "Beati pauperes" which shares a similar idea with "Superest quod suprà est" in that both the poor in spirit and the pilgrim are steadfast in God and in heavenly things. Mon (63) also has Yahweh and a globe; however, instead of a pilgrim, as demanded by its subject naturally, the poor in spirit is represented by a naked child, who is lifting up his heart on the tip of a long stick towards Yahweh (Fig. 42). Furthermore, the globe is pictured differently from that in Whitney's emblem. For the latter, drawn with longitudes and latitudes as well as the names of the three continents, Asia, Europa, and Africa, the artist modeled on that in Mon (56), "Nemo duobus," which he must have already copied for Wh 223, "Nemo potest duobus dominis seruire" (Fig. 44). There are thirteen emblems with a globe in them in Montenay; only in (56) is the globe drawn with lines and names of the continents. Since Whitney's artist had just copied it for Wh 223, he no doubt conveniently used the same globe once more in Wh 225. It is highly probable, therefore, that he had both Mon (56) and Mon (63) in front of him when he designed Wh 225; for the globe he copied from (56), for Yahweh he copied from (63). For the pilgrim, however, he needed another model, which he found in Mon (12), "Sed futuram inquirimus" (Fig. 45). Above all, all three of Montenay's emblems share the same idea of contemptus mundi with the motto of "Superest quod suprà est" in Wh 225. As for the four-sextet alternate verse, Whitney seems to have written it on his own, basing it entirely on numerous scriptural verses (all annotated in the margin). So, unlike Wh 114 whose verse is a composite from four different sources and whose woodcut is based on the verse alone, Wh 225 has a composite woodcut based on three different models, even though they all come from the same source, Montenay's Emblèmes . Wh 131 "Scripta manent" may also be the result of composite borrowing from different pictorial or textual sources. Green (pp. 178, 124) suggested that the woodcut design could have been based on one emblem from Coustau's Pegma , whose woodcut pictures buildings in ruin, and one emblem from Horapollo's Hieroglyphica , which depicts the lasting value of books. Two considerations, however, argue against the validity of this suggestion. One is the fact that apart from the suggested use here in Wh 131, nowhere else did Whitney borrow from these two sources. The other is that both the mutability theme represented by buildings in ruin and the permanence of writings represented by books are such commonplaces that any emblem that contains ruined buildings and any emblem that portrays books and manuscripts would have inspired Whitney's emblem. His verse in Wh 131 also could have been inspired in a composite way; whether or not he knew Coustau and Horapollo is less material. As for the woodcut, the MS artist could have simply drawn from Whitney's text. From the discussion of the ten "newly devised" emblems so far, both the MS and the Choice artists have been shown to be competent painters, capable of drawing from textual descriptions alone. Accordingly, since no pictorial sources have been found for Wh 168a, Wh 185, Wh 129, and Wh 167, it may be assumed that Whitney's artists drew their illustrations from Whitney's verses alone. Assumed still useful is Green's caution after he has listed 23 emblems as "newly devised": "We cannot however say with certainty that the whole of these 23 emblems are original; further researches may lessen the number, and two or three works, to which I have not obtained access, seem likely to supply some of the missing identifications . . ." (p. 237). That his number has been reduced to 15 bears out the accuracy of his prediction; however exhaustive the present research has been—and in the field of iconographical and emblematic study no research can ever hope to be exhaustive—the assumption that the number may still be lessened by further researches remains valid. On the other hand, as long as only non-emblematic pictorial or textual sources should be found, such discovery would in no way lessen the number of "newly devised" emblems. On the contrary, it would only strengthen the impression that Whitney was a resourceful emblem-writer. The last emblem, Wh 230, no doubt is entirely original with Whitney. "Tempus omnia terminat" is a fitting finale for the Choice of 248 emblems; "And all must ende, that euer was begonne." One outcome of this comparative study of the two versions of Choice is certainly a better understanding of the intricate interdependence and interaction among the motto, the woodcut, and the verse of an emblem. Changes in one necessitate changes in the other two, and most of the changes are brought about by Whitney's desire to achieve greater harmony among these three components. Differences between the MS and the printed versions and discrepancies among the three components exist because the MS artist generally followed Whitney's verse faithfully and did not hesitate to alter his model, whereas the Choice artist, in recopying the MS drawings based on La Perrière and Aneau, tended to follow his models rather than the MS drawings (except of course Wh 108). In the case of the "newly devised" emblems that are in the MS, the Choice artist still followed directly the original source (e.g., Wh 112), but copied the MS drawing faithfully when it was his only model (e.g., Wh 95). By using identical woodblocks from his source emblem-books and by not having time to revise his verses to harmonize with the cuts, Whitney left some emblems in Choice with woodcuts that are unsupported by their verses. The exposition in this essay of these discrepancies has provided a number of insights into Whitney's manner of collecting his emblems from other sources. Moreover, the review of his sources and the examination of his marginal annotations contribute to a fuller knowledge of how Whitney put together an emblem-book. But it is among the 15 "newly devised" emblems, particularly among the 10 with their pictorial and textual sources traced in the last section, that Whitney revealed himself to be a competent emblematist, and of especial significance to literature students are those "newly devised" emblems that are based on more than one pictorial or textual source.</field>

Although Green owned a copy of the 1577 Plantin edition—see his Andrea Alciati and His Books of Emblem: A Biographical and Bibliographical Study (1872), No. 93 in the "Bibliographical Catalogue" — the list of Whitney's emblems that are borrowed from those of Alciati is oddly based on the 1581 Plantin edition, (Green, No. 99). Hereinafter reference to this catalogue will be simply Green, followed by the number. In addition, I have consulted no fewer than fourteen principal editions of Alciati in the Henry E. Huntington Library, most of which belonged at one time to the great bibliophile Robert Hoe, from the earliest 1531 Steyner to the latest 1676 Plantin editions. Also available to me are two other editions. One is the undated copy of Alciati's Emblemata in the Archive Library of Washington State University. Based on the wordings of its title-page and the specific page on which Mignault's May 1576 laudation of Alciati begins, this edition appears to fit the description of the 1601 Paris edition (Green, No. 128). The other is the 1973 Scolar Press reprint of the second edition of Diego López's Declaración magistral sobre las emblemas de Andrés Alciato , Valencia 1655 (Green, No. 164).

I have used the facsimile reprint of the 1539 edition ed. by Greta Dexter (1964), the 1973 Scolar Press reprint of the same, and the photocopy of the extremely rare English translation by Thomas Combe (London, Printed by Richard Field, 1614). The original is at the Huntington. Rather than from the 1539 French edition, Whitney copied his MS drawings and Choice woodcuts from either the 1545 or the 1583 Lyons editions by Jean de Tournes, which in turn may have served as copy text for Combe. For a detailed discussion on this discovery, see Section 3. Montenay, Georgette de. Emblèmes, ou Devises Chrestiennes, Composees par Damoiselle Georgette de Montenay. A Lyon, Par Jean Marcorelle.

Tiguri, Apud Christophorum Froschouerum, 1584. Missing from the cuts of this edition is the Cross of Lorraine which is the mark of the artist, Pierre Woeiriot, even though here and there traces of its being removed can be detected when compared with the 1571 plates.

The pagination, 7-258, is identical to that of the second French edition printed in Lyons by Ian de Tournes and Guillaume Gazeau in 1557; the part containing the 36 emblems designed by Symeoni begins on p. 271 and ends on p. 316. I have a reprint of this 1557 French edition by the Scolar Press, 1971. The woodcuts of this Latin edition appear to be close copies of those of the French edition. Sambucus, Joannes.

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX II A List of Emblems with Mottoes in Choice &amp; Their Sources Whitney's emblems are numbered, following Green's example, by pages; whenever two emblems appear on the same page, the one in the upper half of the page will be designated as a and the one in the lower half, b. Green's descriptions of individual emblems are printed in three types: roman signifies that Whitney's woodcuts were struck off from the same Plantin blocks as their sources; italic indicates that because the source emblem-books were not printed by Plantin (and therefore no identical woodblocks were available), Whitney's artist had to copy from these sources; capital represents emblems without direct and single emblematic sources, thus "newly devised" by Whitney. Numbers in brackets following the description are folios in MS. Typ 14 for cross-referencing to Appendix III. Source emblem-books (see Appendix I) are identified by the following keys: Alc=Alciati, Emblemata , 1577. Ane=Aneau, Picta Poesis , 1552. Fae=Faernus, Fabulae Centum , 1573. Jun="Junius, Emblemata , 1585. Mon="Montenay, Emblèmes , 1571. Par=Paradin, Symbola Heroica , 1567. La Perrière, Le Thèâtre , 1545. Sam=Sambucus, Emblemata , 1564 &amp; 1576. Numbers following source keys represent pages, those in parentheses signify emblem numbers, and those in brackets, pages in a later edition (or in Par, emblems designed by Symeoni). Numbers below the "Source" and opposite the mottoes represent column numbers in Henkel &amp; Schöne's Handbuch (1967), which treats all these sources save Faernus and Paradin. Those numbers followed by an (*) indicate that the Handbuch has failed to identify the exact source listed above with Whitney's emblems. Since the Handbuch uses the 1531 Steyner edition of Alciati and supplements it with the 1551 Roville edition, rather than the 1577 Plantin edition, the references to Alciati are useful only for comparing the mottoes and the verses with those in Choice . Also in this place are references to plates in Green (Gr) and to figures of this essay.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Whitney's "Choice of Emblemes" (London 1866; rpt. Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag, 1971); unless otherwise noted all references to Green are to this reprint. I am grateful to the University of Idaho Research Council for a research resource development grant and a summer grant in 1970 and to the Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery and its director, James Thorpe, for letting me use its vast emblematic resources during 1971. I wish to thank the librarians of the Huntington Library, the Harvard College Library, and the Bodleian Library for permission to reproduce emblematic illustrations from their respective collections. The partial subvention of publication costs of this article from the Idaho Research Council is especially appreciated. 2 English Emblem Books (1948), p. 56, n. 1. 3 Second Edition Considerably Increased (Roma: 1964; first English edition: Vol. I, 1939; Vol. II, 1947), p. 46, n. 1. 4 "Whitney's A Choice of Emblemes and Three Commonplace Collections of Erasmus." One of the weaknesses of this interesting study is the author's lack of awareness that Alciati's various editions have divergent designs for the same emblems. Furthermore, from her ambiguous statement—"Since the publication of Green's edition of the Choice , the number of untraced emblems has been considerably reduced by the unexpected discovery of the sources of at least seven emblems in Georgette de Montenay's Emblèmes ou devises chrestiennes and the discovery of three additional sources in the collections of Alciati, Sambucus, and Aneau" (p. 3, n. 4) —it is difficult to determine whether or not she was herself the unexpected discoverer. 5 Pp. ix-xvii. Unfortunately, the addition of this introduction together with the "Table of Contents" between Green's "To the Reader" and "Introductory Dissertation" made it necessary to repaginate all of the preliminary materials up to p. xcviii. As a result, the "General Index" whose references to the preliminary still follow the old pagination becomes unusable. Moreover, the inexplicable dropping of catchwords in Choice , except those on pp. 81, 91, 99, 115, 123, renders this reprint defective and unfaithful to its original. This reissue is used only when Fieler's introduction is referred to. 6 Although there is another manuscript version of Choice , the Bod. Rawlinson MS Poetry 56, it is generally believed that it was copied, without the woodcuts, from the printed version. See Freeman, p. 237; Leisher, p. 404; and Fieler pp. x-xi. 7 Particularly regrettable is the uncritical reliance upon Green by the monumental (2196 columns) and encyclopaedic (numerous bibliographies and indices of motto, figure, subject, etc.) Emblemata : Handbuch zur Sinnbildkunst des XVI. und XVII. Jahrhunderts , eds. Arthur Henkel and Albrecht Schöne (1967). Although the editors did correct two of Green's misattributions and properly traced them to Sambucus on cols. 638 &amp; 1134, they followed Green in not assigning the first emblem in Whitney on p. 218 to Aneau (col. 1605) and in assigning the emblem on p. 1 to Paradin rather than to Junius (col. 1222), the first emblem on p. 188 to La Perrière (col. 428) rather than to Paradin, and the one on p. 221 to La Perrière (col. 296) rather than to Montenay (col. 306a). As Green had overlooked Montenay, so did Henkel and Schöne. See the list of misattributions by Green on p. 41 and for more omissions by the Handbuch see Appendix II of this essay. Despite these minor lapses, the Handbuch remains invaluable to students of emblem literature. 8 I am grateful to Mr. Rodney Dennis, Curator of Manuscripts of the Houghton Library, for making available a microfilm copy of MS. Typ 14 and for much of the information from an entry in the Bond-Faye Supplement to De Ricci's Census . 9 The foliation in MS. Typ 14, as Dennis has pointed out to me, was done in a late hand by a person who had obviously been unaware of the missing leaf. Of course the recto of this missing leaf need not contain the emblem "Nimium rebus ne fide secundis"; however, in view of the fact that the emblem "Feriunt summos fulmina montes" on fol. 78, which appears on p. 140 of Choice , took its motto from the end verse in "Nimium rebus ne fide secundis," it is highly improbable that this emblem did not exist in the MS and that it was added later to Choice . 10 Most of the details concerning the movements of Leicester, the Dousas, and Whitney are based on Leisher, pp. 362-376, who gleaned them from the "Journal of Robert, Earl Leicester," Retrospective Review , 2nd ser., I (1827), and from Conyers Read, Mr. Secretary Walsingham and the Policy of Queen Elizabeth (1925), III, passim, and on Fieler, p. xiii, who based his information on J. A. Van Dorsten's Poets , Patrons and Professors (1962) and Dorsten and R. C. Strong's Leicester's Triumph (1964). 11 Green, pp. 243, 252. Since some of the editions of Whitney's sources used by Green were not available to me, it may be appropriate to list the particular editions which I have used in this essay. This listing can be found as Appendix I at the end of this article. 12 In the list of Whitney's emblems identical to those of Paradin, Green (p. 247) identifies the first emblem in Choice as from Paradin, fol. 43, though in fact only their mottoes are the same. Although he cites "H. Jun. E. 14" as a cross-reference, he does not include it among the list of Junius (p. 250). But in "Notes Literary and Biographical" he writes: "The device is from Hadrian Junius, but the motto from Claude Paradin" (p. 319). Similar cases are in assigning the mottoes in Whitney on pp. 74 and 144 to Reusner's Emblemata (pp. 243, 365). 13 Not counted among the 247 woodcuts is the naked emblem on p. 61, and since a naked emblem does not have a wooduct it would be erroneous to count it as one of the 248 woodcuts, an error made by Freeman (p. 56, n. 1) when she assumed that Green's term device was the same as woodcut —a confusion Green sometimes is prone to (see his definition of device on p. 233). Praz made the same slip on p. 535 of his "Bibliography of Emblem-Books." 14 It is probable that Whitney might have used the 1566 edition of Sambucus in which this emblem has the motto "Animi sub vulpe latentes." In this case, the MS motto merely expanded that of its model; see Henkel &amp; Schöne's Handbuch , col. 974, and Appendix IV of this essay. 15 Although Wh 3, which is based on Jun (19), is without the monogram [G], the woodcut in the first edition of Junius' Emblemata (1565) and that in Pl. 26d of Green's edition have it. Cf. Handbuch , col. 668. Two other monograms may be noted. [A] appears in Wh 19 and Wh 77a whose woodcuts are identical to those in Alciati; no true identity of [A] has been established, although Antoine Van Leest and Assuerus Van Londerzeel were considered (Green, Andrea Alciati , pp. 84-87). The monogram [C] appears in Wh 31 and Wh 59 from Sambucus; it may denote Cornelis Muller, a fellow engraver working for Plantin along with Arnold Nicolai and Gerard Jansen Van Kampen. See the following note &amp; cf. Handbuch , p. LXIV, under Sambucus. 16 Max Rooses records several entries from Plantin's journals to identify the engravers in question: ". . . cette même année [1563] et l'année suivante, il [Nicolai] fournit 82 figures des Emblèmes de Sambucus, et un grand nombre des Emblèmes d'Alciat et de Junius. . . . En 1565, il fit . . . le plus grand nombre . . . des planches . . . pour les Fables de Faërne (1567). Ces dernières furent encore employées dans les Fabellae Aesopicae , de 1586. . . . Les Fable de Faërne . . . parurent chez Plantin en 1567. Les cent compositions de Pierre Van der Borcht qui s'y trouvent sont gravées par Arnaud Nicolaï et Gérard Van Kampen. Le premier en fournit 82, le second 18" ( Christophe Plantin imprimeur Anversois [1883], pp. 266, 275). See also Colin Clair, Christopher Plantin (1960), esp. Chap. XI, "The Artists Who Worked for Plantin," pp. 182ff.; e.g., Cornelis Muller; On 1 January 1564—28 March, 47 figures and 11 borders &amp;c.mmat; 10 stuivers of Sambucus' Emblems (p. 186). 17 Although Inuidia in the 1551 Lyons edition (p. 79) holds a knotted and gnarled staff (see Handbuch , col. 1570b), the other details are so dissimilar that the conclusion is inevitable that the MS artist added the thorns to Envy's staff in his drawing entirely on the basis of Whitney's verse. 18 Not infrequently, throughout the numerous principal editions of Alciati's Emblemata —the Steyner's edition of 1531, the Wechel's of 1534, the Aldine of 1546, the Roville's and Bonhomme's of 1551, and the Plantin's of 1573 &amp; 1577—many woodcuts do not conform with their verses. The locus classicus is the emblem on the three Graces, Alc (162), where they are pictured without wings on their feet ever since they first appeared in the 1546 Aldine edition even though Alciati's verse clearly specifies that they should be so portrayed in order to illustrate the moral: Addita cur nuper pedibus talaria? bis dat | Qui citò dat ( Handbuch , col. 1783). Not until in the 1618 Padua edition was this strange omission finally corrected. 19 Gabriele Simeoni, Le Sentenziose Imprese (1560); the cut has been reproduced in Praz, p. 75. In the 1591 translation of Symbola Heroica by P. S., the woodcut also shows the butterfly on top (p. 324). Green seems to have taken the unusual liberty of reversing the woodcut in Whitney's original edition, a feat not as alarming as it first appears because he has already altered the incorrect page number 76 to the correct one of 84. However, it is highly probable that his particular copy of Choice might belong to one of the several variant issues. For one thing the first marginal note on p. 121, on which the emblem "Festina lentè" appears, has the author Cicero only, whereas in the Huntington Library's Hoe copy as well as the Bodleian copy (Douce, W. Subt. 23; rpt. Amsterdam, 1969) and the Stirling-Maxwell copy (Glasgow University Library, SM 1667; rpt., 1969) all read "Cicero pro Rabir." If Green did not reverse the cut, then Whitney must have caught the printer's error after some copies had already been machined, and righted the picture and added "pro Rabir" for the remainder. 20 Hoe, p. 77-78; Praz, pp. 394-395. Leisher used a 1549 Lyons edition by de Tournes; see his Appendix F, pp. 502-508. 21 I wish to acknowledge my special debt to Professor Praz for his generosity and kindness in responding to my request and numerous other queries. 22 For other examples see Figs. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Of especial interest are Figs. 20, 22 because the close resemblance between them further illustrates the fact that the Choice artist often copied directly from his model rather than from the MS. This is not the case however among Figs. 24, 25, 26; here because of the textual demands the Choice artist clearly modeled his woodcut after the MS drawing. 23 Green, Andrea Alciati , pp. 91ff. 24 Cf. lists of school texts in Charles Hoole, A New Discovery of the Old Art of Teaching School (London, 1660, rpt. 1969); Kenneth Charlton, Education in Renaissance England (1965); William T. Costello, The Scholastic Curriculum at Early Seventeenth-Century Cambridge (1958). 25 Quotations from Mignault are based on the undated copy of Alciati's Emblemata (1601?) in the Archive Library of Washington State University; see Appendix I. 26 Mignault's passage (p. 730) is taken from the letter addressed to his third wife by Ovid, who urges her to continue to support him in his exile: Cumque ego dificiam, nec possim ducere currum, Fac tu sustineas debile sola iugum. Ad medicum specto venis fugientibus aeger, Vltima pars vitae dum mihi restat, habes. (III, i, 67-70) This certainly fits the ideal friendship which outlasts death—a type of rare friend who, as Whitney puts it, "Yea, when wee shall be like a sencelesse block, | That for our sakes, will still imbrace our stock" (Wh 62). Instead of using this passage as his end verse, Whitney chose another from Ovid's letter to his patron-friend, Cotta Maximus. At the very beginning of the letter Ovid expresses his gratitude towards Cotta's loyalty while others have deserted him, and the theme of "Amicitia, etiam post mortem durans" is struck: "Cumque labent aliqui iactataque vela relinquant, | Tu lacerae remanes ancora sola rati." The celebrated friendship between Orestes and Pylades, who strive to die in each other's stead, not only serves Ovid's purpose of urging Cotta to plead his case and rescue him from his exile, but also serves Whitney's purpose of complementing the thoughts in the second sextet of his verse. Inasmuch as Whitney's readers would more readily appreciate the story of Orestes and Pylades than the relationship between Ovid and his loyal wife, his passage has more universal appeal than that chosen by Mignault. 27 (1904), p. 395; cf.

Kraus, Sir Francis Drake, A Pictorial Biography (1970), p. 38. 29 That the transforming of a famous incident from Roman history into a new emblem is by no means unique with Whitney may be seen from a Dutch emblem "Loon na Werck" (Fig. 35) in a collection entitled Bellerophon of Lust tot Wysheyd by Dirck Pieterszoon Pers (1614). The copperplate was engraved by Joos de Vosscher, modeled obviously on Jost Amman's woodcut, and the verse account was based on Titus Livius' Historiarum ab urbe condita libri (V, xxvii). 30 C. Ruelens &amp; A. De Backer, Annales Plantiniennes ( 1555-1589 ) (1866), pp. 21, 47, 67, 123, 225. 31 A separate study is needed to determine the ways in which emblematists used Aesop's fables in general and Whitney used them in particular. There are no fewer than 46 emblems in Choice that are in one way or another based on Aesopic fables or their analogues. Space here permits only some bibliographical notes on these three figures. Fig. 36 is from The Fables of Aesop . . . Translated into English Verse, and Moralized. And also Emblematically Illustrated with Pictures . By W. B. [William Barret] (1639). This edition is particularly interesting to emblem students because of its emblematic nature. The only difference with a bona fide emblem-book is its lack of a motto; in place of a motto it has a subject title which was used at the very inception of illustrated fable literature. (See Ulrich Boner, Der Edelstein , 1461; Rinucius, Fabulae et Vita , 1474; Heinrich Steinhöwell, Gesalmelt Fabeln , 1477; Accii Zuchi, Aesopi Fabulas , 1479; Bonus Accursius, Fabulae et vitae , [1480].) Despite its late date (1639), its woodcut is closer to that in Choice than to those represented by the other two figures. The possibility certainly exists that both artists might have based their design on a common model. Fig. 37 is from Fables Diverses Tirées D'Esope . . . avec vne explication nouuelle faite par R. D. F. A Paris, . . . M.DC.LIX. The large etchings are identical to those in Freitag's Mythologia Ethica , Antverpiae, Plantini, 1579, which were traced by Colin Clair (pp. 195-196) to Edewaerd de Dene's De warachtighe fabulen der dieren , Bruges, Pieter de Clerck, 1567. The 108 etchings were the work of Marc Gheeraerts, and the plates were acquired by Plantin and Philip Galle. The dissimilarities between Whitney's woodcut and this large etching are sufficient to dismiss Green's suggestion that the former might have been based on the latter. Fig. 38 is from Caxton's The Fables of Aesop , 1483, which is based on the French translation of Steinhöwell's Gesalmelt Fabeln by Julien Macho ( Les Subtiles Fables d'Esope , Lyon, 1480). Because of their outdoor setting Figs. 37 &amp; 38 are closer in design to each other than to that of Fig. 36, despite the striking difference between two oxen in Caxton and one ox in de Dene. 32 Jeannette Fellheimer, "Hellowes' and Fenton's Translation of Guevara's Epistolas Familiares," SP , 45 (1947), 142. I have searched for this particular letter through the following: Epistolas familiares de Don Antonio de Guevara in Epistoralio Español , Vol. 13, ed. by D.

The letter is not in the first three editions of Hellowes' Familiar Epistles (1574, enlarged 1575?, and 1577), but it is in the 1584 edition (STC 12435). Since all the editions of both Fenton's Golden Epistles and Hellowes' Familiar Epistles were printed by Rafe Newbery, it comes as no surprise to discover that the headlines in the 1584 Familiar Epistles on both leaves are "Golden Epistles," rather than those in the earlier editions, "The familiar Epistles | of Sir Antonie of Gueuara." It seems obvious to me that the 1584 edition of Hellowes' Familiar Epistles was printed from the sheets used for printing the 1582 Fenton's Golden Epistles (STC 10796), a fact that has escaped Fellheimer. 33 Ben Perry, Barbrius and Phaedrus (1965), No. 203, p. 460. 34 Madrid, Por los herederos de I.

      <field name="heading_text">Some Spellings of Compositor B in the Shakespeare First Folio by S. W. Reid</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Recent studies have shown that the spellings of English Renaissance compositors are useful not only in identifying the parts of books typeset by these workmen but also in discovering what copy they used in setting the pages assigned to them. 1 Identification of compositors' shares in books by means of spelling rests chiefly on their characteristic preferences (that is, specifically their typical departures from the various spellings of their copy in favor of a single spelling), whereas identification of copy for a given text rests on their tolerances (that is, their habitual, though not necessarily constant, retentions of non-preferred copy spellings). The first kind of study is of course the more familiar and has generally been a preliminary step in inquiries into the faithfulness with which compositors transmitted the substantives of their copy. 2 Obviously it also must precede the second kind of study, which is less common but may nevertheless play an important role in solving problems in the texts of authors such as Shakespeare. Indeed, much of the work done with compositorial spelling has quite naturally been concerned with the compositors of Shakespeare's plays—especially those workmen in William Jaggard's shop who set the First Folio, and particularly the notorious Compositor B. Although it reprints quarto texts of several plays with little or no reference to independent authorities, 3 the Folio provides the earliest and only authoritative texts of about half of Shakespeare's extant dramatic works and also contains texts, having independence and authority in various degrees, of several other plays that appeared in quartos prior to 1623 (e.g., H5 or Oth. ). The compositors of this important book have inevitably attracted the attention of students of Shakespeare's text, and because analysis has indicated that B alone set about half the Folio, he has become the object of considerable interest. Yet we still have no systematic study of his spelling habits in the Folio and have given very little attention to the question of his habitual tolerances. Since the nature of the printed copy for Compositor B's stints in seven plays of the First Folio is known, a study of his work in these plays should show what spellings (besides the traditional ones, such as do , go , and heere ) can help identify B's share in Folio pages hitherto only tentatively assigned to a compositor and what spellings in his work can help identify the copy behind other Folio plays (for example, 2H4 or Ham. ). The nature of the Folio copy for these seven plays— Much Ado about Nothing, Love's Labour's Lost, A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice , I Henry IV , Titus Andronicus , and Romeo and Juliet —seems to be one of the few questions about the printing of the Folio on which scholars are united. Another point on which nearly all scholars agree is B's share in the typesetting of these plays. Professor Charlton Hinman's assignments to B rest on fairly substantial evidence, and those few pages where the evidence is such that he has expressed doubt about B's precise role can be temporarily excluded from consideration without irreparable harm to the study of B's work in these plays. 4 Moreover, T. H. Howard-Hill's recent examination of all the Folio Comedies has brought to light several new kinds of evidence that support Hinman's attribution to B of pages in Ado , LLL , MND , and MV . 5 When applied to IH4 , Tit. , and Rom. , these new kinds of evidence confirm the conclusions about B's role in these plays that Hinman draws from the already substantial evidence of cases and spellings. (See the summary of this evidence appended to this article, and Howard-Hill's summary, pp. 90-99.) Only in sigs. f5 v , f6, and ee3 is the spacing after medial commas not entirely consistent with B's usual practices, but these pages contain prose and other long lines which sometimes influenced B to set more unspaced commas (Howard-Hill, p. 67), and the other evidence shows that the compositor was B, rather than one of the other workmen who could have set these pages. Not all spellings, of course, are equally reliable evidence of a compositor's share in a book or of the nature of the copy that he used in setting it: one reason some spellings are unreliable is that they were subject to various influences which often caused compositors to depart from their normal habits. For instance, there is no question that justification and rhyme at times affected the practices of some Renaissance compositors. Thus when investigating them, we must separate spellings in rhymes, long lines, and even nearly long lines from other evidence and use them, if at all, only when previous investigation has shown that such spellings are reliable evidence of the compositor's normal practices. This general rule applies not only to spellings in rhymes and long lines. Study of B's work indicates that in inflections (e.g., showes ) and compounds (e.g., sicknesse ) his normal habits of spelling endings (e.g., preferring final -w to -we or -cke to -ck ) were sometimes affected by the addition of one or more letters. When drawing conclusions about his spelling of a particular ending, then, we must discount evidence in inflections and compounds, whereas when initial or medial spellings are the issue, such evidence becomes admissible because study shows that B's habits were otherwise unaffected by compounding or inflecting. In a similar way, most but not all words in stage-directions are good evidence of B's normal spelling habits. It is well known that in B's work the entrances are often carefully centered. 6 Such entrances are also generally symmetrical, because ordinarily B just as carefully set them in the form of an inverted pyramid. To do so, he sometimes deviated from his normal habits of spelling the words (usually by shortening one), and thus spellings in such stage-directions are suspect as evidence. Nevertheless, examination indicates that lines in other stage-directions set in a different manner were not subject to this kind of justification. In these lines there is no compelling evidence that B spelled any differently when setting stage-directions than he did when setting dialogue, and thus such stage-directions contain reliable evidence of his normal spelling practices. 7 Initially, then, we must separate spellings in stage-directions as well as those in rhymes, long lines, nearly long lines, inflections, and in compounds from other evidence and must use them in drawing conclusions about B's normal spelling habits only when examination has shown that they are legitimate evidence of his ordinary practices. The present study observes this kind of distinction and adopts the symbols NL, L, R, and SD to identify the number of spellings in nearly long lines, long lines, rhymes, and stage-directions, respectively. Ultimately of greater moment, perhaps, than such specific issues in establishing reliable methods for the study of compositorial spelling is the more general question of compositorial uniformity. Of course, some kind of uniformity, revealed in certain spellings or other features of a text, is necessary merely to identify a compositor. The question is not, then, whether a given compositor is uniform in some of his habits (such as B's preferences for do , go , and heere ), but to what degree such uniformity extends to his practices over a period of time and to his treatment of similar forms. 8 To have a sound basis for studying a compositor's particular habits, we need to discover something about his general constancy and consistency and to learn how much aberration should be expected in his work. Thus, before we use the relatively few spellings of a specific word to define the stability of a compositor's practice of treating it, we should examine the larger question of his over-all constancy by finding a broad base of evidence that will minimize the effect of random cases of aberration on our conclusions. Such a broad base of evidence is available in a compositor's practices of spelling orthographically analogous words. An examination of these practices should allow us to study his consistency and constancy at the same time. In the case of Compositor B, a potentially ideal situation exists because of the printing of the Pavier Quartos in the Jaggard shop in 1619. Jaggard seldom printed dramatic texts; hence these quartos provide a rare opportunity for seeing some of his staff at work on comparable material shortly before he undertook the First Folio. Moreover, William S. Kable's recent work on the Pavier Quartos includes a study of the treatment of orthographically analogous words that could enable us to determine to what extent B's generic habits in the Folio of 1621-1623 had already become established in 1619. 9 Unfortunately, our ability to use these quartos is somewhat compromised by the current disagreement about the typesetting of them. Until recently it was generally thought that B was responsible for essentially all the work. 10 However, in the last several years two studies of the Paviers, by John F. Andrews and Peter W. M. Blayney, have independently attacked this view as it is represented in Kable's work. 11 Lamentably, these studies do not agree on the division of the Paviers between their hypothetical compositors nor on whether B was one of them, and in spite of bits of good evidence, neither view seems conclusive enough at present to be adopted as a whole. Now that the Paviers have become a matter of some dispute, it is likely that better evidence more rigorously treated will be necessary to settle it. Nevertheless, some comparison of the generic habits exhibited in the Pavier Quartos with the implications of the spellings in the Folio pages set by B from known printed copy can help us discover whether or not the spellings in the Paviers are at all useful in studying B's Folio work. Since such a comparison deals in general habits and cumulative statistics, it cannot prove that one compositor, B, set all the spellings, or even all the pages, in the Paviers. Nor can examination of B's general spelling habits in the Folio and of the general habits of the compositor(s) of the Paviers prove that B's habit of spelling each and every word remained stable between 1619 and 1623. But it can deal with the main issues that must be settled before analysis of B's spelling of particular words in the Folio proceeds, though the results of such an examination can only be summarized here. 12 For one thing, the recurrent agreement between the spelling patterns noted in B's Folio pages set from known printed copy and the patterns in the Pavier Quartos noted by Kable reveals how remarkably similar are the general habits of B in F1 and the habits of the compositor(s) in Pq. The inconsistencies as well as consistencies of the spelling habits of the compositor(s) of the Pavier Quartos are duplicated in B's Folio work, when sufficient evidence exists to define those habits. The only exception to this uniformity is the treatment of final -ie/-y after consonants other than -f and -s , but in this case B's own inconstancy in F1 suggests that the discrepancy between the Pavier spellings and some of the Folio spellings is to be expected and does not necessarily imply different compositors. Hence, if another compositor's work in the Paviers is to be distinguished from B's, it seems this distinction will have to be based mainly on other evidence (especially mechanical) such as Andrews seeks to exploit, rather than on the evidence of spellings. 13 Whether or not another compositor is in fact responsible for a large part of the Pavier Quartos has yet to be decided. But given the kind of uniformity of spelling patterns observed, it seems safe to conclude that on the whole Kable's findings have some relevance in a study of B's Folio work. 14 Insofar as B's general practices of 1619 are often exhibited in the Pavier spellings, the generic habits examined show that on the whole B's general practices remained constant between the time he worked on the Pavier Quartos and the time he set the Tragedy section of the Folio. This constancy is apparent not only in simple preferences but also in intricate habits, as when his practice of spelling endings is determined by penultimate letters or when his choice of -d or -de depends on whether -an- , -en- , or -in- precedes it. 15 In a number of complex cases, B's very inconsistency in treating the words within orthographical groups may be said to prove his constancy. Within the context of this general constancy, we can briefly note the amount of random variation, or aberration, in B's work. Study of B's spelling in the pages considered here shows that even his handling of words for which he has a very definite preferred spelling is not absolutely uniform. In spelling words of high frequency like 'do', 'go', 'here', 'be', 'he', 16 and those with final -l/-ll , B sometimes sets a non-preferred spelling instead of the preferred spelling present in his copy. Various tests combine to indicate that at least 1%, and sometimes up to 6%, of the occurrences of words for which he has a definite spelling preference exhibit such aberration. Where random variation becomes inconstancy or indifference is no doubt a matter of definition. But there is reason to believe that aberration must be allowed for in analyzing B's spelling of practically all words, and that with fifteen or so occurrences of a word available for examination, we can begin to distinguish genuine random variation from variable practice that is due to indifference rather than to chance. In studying this compositor's work, we must take account of the fact that any one spelling may simply be evidence of his normal human variability; however, once this fact is taken into account, conclusions about his spelling habits drawn from a number of examples nevertheless remain possible, and accurate ones should in fact be more feasible. 17 Another thing the analysis of B's treatment of orthographically similar words in F1 shows is that in his Folio work, as well as in the Pavier Quartos, orthographical analogy occasionally "governed [the] treatment of various spellings" (Kable, p. 48). But by no means does it show that all or even most spellings were so governed. There is no guarantee that a pattern ascertained to govern the spelling of some analogous words necessarily applies to the spelling of other such words. It may or not. Knowledge of a compositor's practice of treating the spellings of several analogous words may make us more aware of the possible pitfalls to be avoided in interpreting limited spelling evidence for another analogous word; it may even aid us in interpreting the limited evidence for such a word (e.g., 'entreat') when that evidence suggests the compositor's manner of spelling the word conforms to his habitual manner of spelling analogous words (e.g., preferring en- and tolerating in- ). But such knowledge cannot by itself provide positive evidence that will help solve practical problems of compositor or copy identification. We must turn to B's spellings of specific words to find such evidence. The purpose of the following remarks is to help identify and evaluate spellings in the Folio plays set by B from known printed copy that we can, in turn, use to study his work elsewhere in F1. In some cases this involves simply reporting the imperfect state of our knowledge of B's practices, pending the resolution of the current disagreement over the Pavier Quartos. The aim is not to review all the spelling evidence now available on the words discussed, but simply to reach conclusions, on the basis of the pertinent Folio evidence (supplemented by whatever Pavier evidence seems relevant), about the usefulness of the spellings of these words either in assigning disputed Folio pages to B or in identifying the copy behind Folio texts set by him. 18 There are, then, two classes of spellings that are of interest here: those that in B's work possibly derive from his copy, and those that B possibly prefers, under normal conditions. 19 Naturally, it is more likely that a compositor would develop a preferred spelling for words frequently seen, such as 'he' and 'me', than for words infrequently seen, such as 'battle' and 'courtesy'. Spellings that appear in B's work chiefly because they were in his copy, rather than because he personally favored them, often are spellings of words of low frequency; therefore, conclusions about them must often be based upon a relatively small number of occurrences and hence sometimes involve rather careful examinations of the evidence. However, it is by no means true that all words for which B often reproduces a copy spelling occur infrequently. For instance, he seems to have developed no clearly preferred spelling of the frequent 'oh' but generally to have followed his copy's spelling, and his practice of spelling 'been' includes both a spelling preference and a spelling that derives from his copy. Most of the spellings discussed here have been examined previously, though not always extensively, and some are included here, despite the limited evidence, because of the attention they have received in the past. William S. Kable has presented simply statistical evaluations of most of the copy-derived spellings, and he as well as Willoughby, Walker, Hinman, I. B. Cauthen, Jr., J. F. Andrews, and P. W. M. Blayney have discussed many of the preferred spellings. 20 The present examination departs somewhat from these investigations by providing discussion of the usefulness not only of preferred spellings in identifying B's work but also of derived spellings in identifying his copy. Such discussion is necessary both because (as just mentioned) the quantity of spellings is often small and because (as the complex questions considered above show) more is needed in an evaluation of the quality of particular spellings as evidence than the presentation of raw statistics. 21 Although the actual evaluations of the spellings take the form of discussion, the evidence analyzed appears in tables preceding each discussion. This short-hand summary presents a concise view of the pertinent evidence gathered from various sources alluded to already. 22 Naturally this evidence simply represents the best that is now available; further study may well result in some refinement of the statistics cited here, though hopefully no major correction. Most of the evidence for the Paviers is, of course, Kable's. 23 When Andrews or Blayney presents corrections of Kable's figures, these corrections also appear, enclosed in round brackets. At one point (p. 194) Blayney offers corrections of what he calls the "greatest discrepancies" in Kable's statistics based on a collation of all the Pavier Quartos, but these totals ignore the distinction between long and short lines; in citing these figures I have adjusted them on the basis of Kable's statistics (i.e., by subtracting from Blayney's total the number of spellings Kable shows appearing in long lines) and followed them with a query to show that the precise statistics, and therefore their significance, are as yet uncertain. Finally, though the significance of some of the evidence from the Pavier Quartos is as yet unclear (either because of alleged inaccuracies in Kable's statistics or because he, Andrews, and Blayney are imprecise about spellings in rhymes, stage-directions, and sometimes inflections and compounds), the very fact that Blayney has checked Kable's statistics not only identifies those to be most distrusted, but also offers some assurance that much of Kable's other evidence is essentially correct, as experience with Andrews' totals suggests. Until agreement about the spellings in the Paviers is reached, conclusions based solely on Kable's statistics must be very tentative at best. But where a substantial number of spellings in F1 exhibit the same pattern as do those recorded by Kable, or where Andrews' or Blayney's corrections fit that pattern, there is reason to believe that these findings are pertinent to an examination of B's spelling habits from 1621 through 1623. ART Spellings Pq FI art &gt; art 20 1 (sb.) 17 (vb.) arte &gt; arte 2 B's tolerance for art in both the noun and verb seems indisputable: invariable retentions of this spelling when found in Folio copy parallel those in the Paviers noted by Kable. The theory that arte is also a spelling that B will generally reproduce rests only on the 2 instances of its retention in the Pavier Quartos. Both spellings are probably reliable clues to the features of copy, if Kable's statistics are essentially correct, 24 but since we cannot define exactly how B generally responds to copy's arte , it is remotely possible that art is a spelling slightly preferred rather than just generally tolerated. That arte is a preference seems unlikely. These words deserve delicate handling, but their forms are valuable witnesses to the characteristics of B's copy. BEEN Spellings Pq FI beene &gt; beene 23 4 bin &gt; beene 3 2 bin &gt; bin 13 3 beene &gt; bin 1 been &gt; beene 1 3 bene &gt; beene 12 bene &gt; bene 15 beene &gt; bene 20 been &gt; bene 3 5 bin &gt; bene 8 1 bene &gt; bin 3 For this word B prefers final -ne and tolerates bin . He is practically indifferent to beene and bene relative to one another. The 3 cases of Folio copy's bin reproduced verify the implication of the evidence of the Paviers that bin in B's work derives from copy's bin a large percentage of the time (about 80%, or 4-to-1 odds). Since in the Folio bin is never set by B in place of another spelling of copy, as it sometimes is in Pq, the reliability of this spelling in F1 as a clue to the spelling of copy is perhaps a little higher than the combined Pavier and Folio statistics would indicate, but there is no way to be sure about this. The spellings in the Folio and the Paviers (assuming Kable's statistics are essentially right) seem to corroborate one another in suggesting that B will follow copy's bin a little more than 50% of the time it appears under normal conditions. BLOOD Spellings Pq FI -oo- &gt; -oo- 52+5L 17+1NL+1L -ou- &gt; -oo- 45+3L 5 -ou- &gt; -ou- 27 1 -oo- &gt; -ou- 5 -d &gt; -d 118 20 -de &gt; -d 3 The forms blood and bloud remain, respectively, predictable preferred and copy-derived spellings in the Folio. In Pq, copy's -de always becomes -d , and approximately one-third of the -ou- copy spellings are reproduced. 25 In F1 only -d appears in known copy and B's work, and B retains only 1 of the 6 bloud spellings in his copy. The 5 anomalous alterations of Pavier copy's -oo- to -ou- are not surprising, since they yield a normal random-variation factor of 3.6%. If Kable's statistics are essentially correct, B's habit did not change materially between 1619 and 1623, although there is perhaps less chance in F1 that he will set bloud . BLOODY Spellings Pq FI -oo- &gt; -oo- 9 5 -ou- &gt; -oo- 18+1L 1 -ou- &gt; -ou- 13 -y &gt; -y 23 5 -ie &gt; -y 15 -ie &gt; -ie 1 As in B's practice generally, the addition of the -ie/-y ending does not affect B's treatment of the internal vowels -oo-/-ou- . Here, too, about one-third of copy's -ou- spellings slip into the Paviers instead of being changed to -oo- , according to Kable's figures. The Folio evidence corroborates the Pavier evidence of B's preference for -oo- ; but since the only bloudy in Folio copy is altered to bloody , for now we must simply assume that B will continue to reproduce copy's -ou- at times in F1 under normal conditions. The -ie/-y ending is subject to the same inconstancy that governs other words with this alternative. BRIEF Spellings Pq FI -ee- &gt; -ee- (1) -ie- &gt; -ee- 5 1 -ie- &gt; -ie- 16 (15) 2 As in other analogous words, the internal -ie- in this word is one of the steadiest clues to the spelling of B's copy. 26 The retention in the Folio of 2 of the 3 briefe spellings and the change of 1 briefe to breefe corroborate the evidence of the Pavier Quartos that B prefers -ee- but will set -ie- , rather than -ee- , from copy's -ie- about 70% of the time under unexceptional circumstances. To date there are no examples of random variation for this word. We should note that -fe seems to be habitually tolerated spelling: B's known copy does not have -f , and hence there is no proof that he actually prefers -fe to -f (as Kable implies). CHIEF Spellings Pq FI -ee- &gt; -ee- 2 1 -ie- &gt; -ee- 8 -ie- &gt; -ie- 2 Apparently conforming to his habit for other orthographically analogous words, B seems to prefer the -ee- spelling of this word and to reproduce the exclusive -fe spellings of it in his copy. Since the only Folio example is B's reproduction of the 1 cheefe of his copy, we cannot be certain about our conclusions, especially that -ie- in F1 will duplicate the -ie- of copy. The meagre evidence of the Paviers and the examples of analogous words encourage the belief that it will and that approximately 20% of -ie- copy spellings will be retained, but there is no conclusive evidence in F1 in favor of this inference. CHOICE Spellings Pq FI -i- &gt; -i- 11 4 -y- &gt; -i- 10 1 -y- &gt; -y- 4 -s- &gt; -s- 14+1L 3 -c- &gt; -s- 9 -c- &gt; -c- 2 2 There are two sets of spelling alternatives for this word, and they appear to function independently of each other. The evidence of the Folio seems to confirm the implications of the evidence of the Paviers that B prefers -i- to -y- , but since the only -y- spelling in Folio copy is changed to -i- , the 4 instances of Pavier copy's -y- retained are the only evidence that -y- derives from copy. On the other hand, though Kable does not concern himself with -c-/-s- variation, his Pavier evidence suggests B's preference for -s- and his tolerance of -c- , and in F1 the 3 retentions of copy's -s- support the first hypothesis, and the 2 retentions of copy's -c- confirm the second. Thus, if Kable's calculations are correct, -y- copy spellings should be retained by B about 28% of the time, as should -c- spellings; when either appears in B's work under normal conditions, the chances are excellent that it derives from his copy. COUSIN Spellings Pq FI -o- &gt; -o- 9 2 -ou- &gt; -o- 1 -ou- &gt; -ou- 8 -o- &gt; -ou- 1 -oo- &gt; -o- 1 2 -oo- &gt; -ou- 7 Kable concludes that both the -ou- and -o- spellings of these words reliably duplicate the spelling of B's copy, but the truth is considerably more complex than this. Indeed, it is so complex that the evidence can hardly be rehearsed here. 27 The main complexity is introduced by the appearance in Folio copy of a proportionately larger number of -oo- spellings than Kable finds in Pavier copy. The implication of all the evidence so far available seems to be that B's -ou- will under normal conditions derive either from copy's -ou- or -oo- , that -o- in his work will derive either from copy's -o- or -oo- , and that whereas both -ou- and -o- can be used to decide between hypothetical copy having only these two variants, neither is useful where copy's -oo- is involved. B's spellings of this word are not totally useless, but in their use considerable care must be exercised, especially in view of the likelihood of random variation. DEAR Spellings Pq FI -ee- &gt; -ee- 37+7L (38+3L) 3+2NL -ea- &gt; -ee- 23+6L (10) 3+1L -ea- &gt; -ea- 37+6L (41+2L) 6 -ee- &gt; -ea- (16+2L) The accuracy of Kable's statistics on this word has been questioned by both Andrews and Blayney; 28 until B's treatment of this word in the Pavier Quartos has been defined, final conclusions about his Folio practice are impossible. However, although they are insufficient to support final conclusions, the 15 spellings in the Folio are enough to outline a provisional view of B's handling of this word. The evidence in F1 suggests that B favors internal -ee- but often reproduces the -ea- spelling of his copy. Somewhere around 60% or 70% of the -ea- spellings (as in deare , dearer , dearest , and dearely ) occurring in his copy should be reproduced by B. What remains uncertain as a result of Andrews' and Blayney's findings is the extent of random variation in B's spelling of this word—how often he changes copy's -ee- to -ea- and therefore how reliable a clue to his copy's spelling is an -ea- in his work. The evidence in F1 suggests high reliability, but it may be deceiving because of its relatively limited quantity. If Kable's statistics were essentially correct, then an -ea- spelling of this word in B's Folio work under normal conditions (including long lines and stage-directions, but not rhymes) would be a good clue to the spelling of his copy. If, however, B's spellings vary randomly, then the word must be discarded in attempts to identify his unknown copy. DEVIL Spellings Pq FI di- &gt; di- 27 3 de- &gt; di- 17 1 de- &gt; de- 1 -ll- &gt; -ll 18 4 -l &gt; -ll 10 -ll &gt; -l 2 The spelling divell appears to be one B prefers in the Folio, as Alice Walker has noted; however, the available spelling evidence of the Pavier Quartos suggests that, precisely speaking, B's preference is only for initial di- as opposed to de- (this preference determines the use of internal -e- after -v- ), since -ll spellings in Pavier copy become -l and B may be genuinely indifferent to the -l/-ll alternative (the random variation for 'devil' is 6%). Thus the preferred spelling of 'devil' is initial di- , not divell , in the Pavier Quartos, and there is no evidence that B's habit changed by the time he set the Folio. Nor is there any evidence in the Folio to corroborate Kable's conclusion that the spelling devill in B's work derives from copy. Only 1 time is the devill of Pavier copy retained, and though Kable's conjecture is plausible, this is slender evidence on which to rear any conclusions. DO Spellings Pq FI do &gt; do 270 41 doe &gt; do 303 47 doe &gt; doe 12 do &gt; doe 3 It is well known that do is B's preferred spelling. The only question is whether doe is a spelling that reflects B's copy, as Kable maintains. If the doe at MV , 28, is not B's but C's, 29 then only 1 (L) doe appears in B's Folio work, and it duplicates copy's doe in a long line; it appears to be a spelling influenced by justification (see 1H4 , 991). All the other doe spellings in Folio copy are altered to do . That doe will often appear in B's Folio work seems unlikely (though some random variation must be expected), but, given the present meagre evidence, if it does appear in a short line, the chances seem good that it derives from copy. DOOR Spellings Pq FI -oo- &gt; -oo- 19 1+3NLSD -o- &gt; -oo- 9 1NL Compositor B's practice of spelling this word remains constant in the Pavier Quartos and the Folio: he habitually sets the spelling doore . The 1(NL) and 3(NLSD) changes are primary evidence, because anticipatory justification would only have prompted B to set -o- , not -oo- . B's spelling of this word in stage-directions is probably as reliable a witness to his practice as his spelling in dialogue. EMBRACE Spellings Pq FI e- &gt; e- 6 1NLSD i- &gt; e- 2 1 i- &gt; i- 1 2 This word occurs in B's work in the Pavier Quartos and the Folio a total of 13 times; hence, conclusions about it must be tentative. The evidence indicates that B prefers initial em- but that he will follow about half of the im- spellings of his copy. These conclusions find support in B's generic habit of preferring em ( n ) - and tolerating im ( n ) -. EMPLOY Spellings Pq FI i- &gt; e- 2 1 i- &gt; i- 3 1 e- &gt; i- 1 B's spelling habits for 'employ' seem to resemble those for 'embrace'. Since it appears a total of 8 times in the Pavier Quartos and the Folio, the conclusion that B prefers initial em- for this word but tolerates the im- of his copy must be tentative. The only employ appearing in Pavier copy is altered to imploy . This change may suggest that B did not set it or may show his indifference to the alternative em- and im- spellings, but in view of the handling of em-/im- generally, that it is anomalous seems more likely. That B actually favors initial em- but reproduces roughly half of the im- spellings of his copy under normal conditions is the conclusion tentatively suggested by the evidence currently available. ENOUGH Spellings Pq FI e- &gt; e- 24 5 i- &gt; e- 18 y- &gt; e- 1 -gh &gt; -gh 41 4+1NL -w &gt; -w 2 1 -gh &gt; -w 1 For this word B prefers initial en- to in- and follows both final -gh and -w when they appear in copy. The alteration of all initial in- copy spellings to en- in the Pavier Quartos is sufficient evidence of B's preference for en- and finds support in the reproduction of all 24 en- forms in the Pavier Quartos and the Folio. Whereas 1 final -gh is changed to -w in the Pavier Quartos, B's tolerance for both these spellings is shown in F1 and suggested in the other Pq spellings. The chances seem good that -w and especially -gh spellings in B's Folio work derive from his copy. ENTREAT Spellings Pq FI e- &gt; e- 3 (2) i- &gt; e- 13 2 i- &gt; i- 12 (11) 1 e- &gt; i- 1 1 -te &gt; -te 8 -t &gt; -te 14 -t &gt; -t 4 1 -ts &gt; -t 1 Kable concludes that the initial en- and the final -te are B's preferred spellings of this word and that initial in- and final -t spellings in B's work derive from his copy. The Folio spellings tend to confirm his conclusions about en-/in- variation. But the evidence is slender, and B's treatment of this word is more complex than Kable believes. The statistics reveal that B's practice of spelling this word is subject to some random variation—6% if we combine the Pavier and Folio spellings. B's preference for initial en- is suggested by the combined statistics and by the fact that he spells analogous words similarly. But it is not a strong preference: he reproduces 45% of the in- spellings of his copy, altering only 55% to en- . If we allow that the single example of Folio copy's en- altered to in- is just random variation, rather than evidence of his indifference in 1621-1623, then the chances are that 86% of the initial in- spellings appearing in B's Folio work under normal conditions derive from copy. However, his treatment of -t/-te in this word is unpredictable. His alleged preference for final -te is not confirmed or disproven by the Folio evidence; B is probably indifferent to this ending, as he is to -t/-te generally. FORFEIT Spellings Pq FI -e- &gt; -e- 2 -ei- &gt; -e- 1 -ei- &gt; -ei- 2 -e- &gt; -ei- 1 (sb.) -ai- &gt; -ei- 5 3+1L 3 (vb.) -ai- &gt; -e- 2 -ei- &gt; -ey- 1 B's spelling habit for this word is complex. The one thing the Folio evidence confirms is that B invariably rejects the internal -ai- spellings of this word when they occur in his copy; apparently, he is indifferent to the -e- and -ei- spellings relative to one another. His alteration of the 1 forfeited of Folio copy to forfeyted , in accord with his equivocal attitude towards -ei-/-ey- spellings generally, merely complicates the picture. The -e- , -ei- , and -ey- spellings are all characteristics of B. He favors neither -t nor -te endings. GO Spellings Pq FI go &gt; go 129 8 goe &gt; go 102 23+1SD goe &gt; goe 68 go &gt; goe 5 As is well known, B prefers the spelling go . The question is whether when goe appears in his work it can be counted on to derive from his copy. The spelling goe appears in the Pavier Quartos 73 times in short lines, and of these 68 duplicate the spelling of copy and 5 replace copy's go (random variation is thus about 1.5%). The only goe spelling in B's Folio work from known printed copy is at the end of a long line (copy also has goe ). Hence, it appears unlikely that goe will occur in a short line in B's Folio work, but if it does, the odds that it derives from copy under normal conditions would appear to be very good. GRANT Spellings Pq FI -a- &gt; -a- 12 -au- &gt; -a- 8 2 Alice Walker's guess that B prefers grant to graunt is confirmed not only by the evidence of the Paviers but also by that of F1. He changes -au- spellings of his copy to -a- and reproduces his copy's -a- and -t- spellings invariably. The form grant is characteristic of B. GRIEF Spellings Pq FI -ee- &gt; -ee- 2 -ie- &gt; -ee- 19 4 -ie- &gt; -ie- 21 In the Folio B prefers the spelling greefe to griefe . This habit also appears in the Pavier Quartos, but here we find about 53% of the griefe spellings in copy reproduced. The fact that in F1 he reproduces only 1 (L) griefe form in a long line may indicate that between 1619 and 1621 B's preference for -ee- had become stronger. However, the appearance of a stronger preference may simply be owing to the meagreness of the Folio evidence. Since not a single recorded instance of an internal -ee- copy spelling of this word is altered to -ie- , its conformity to the patterns in analogous words suggests that when an -ie- spelling occurs in B's Folio work, it almost certainly derives from copy under normal conditions. GRIEVE Spellings Pq FI -ee- &gt; -ee 16 1 -ie- &gt; -ee- 5 2 -ie- &gt; -ie- 3 1 -ee- &gt; -ie- 1 This word follows a pattern almost identical to that of 'grief'. B prefers the -ee- spelling but almost half the time will set -ie- when his copy contains it in short lines. An anomalous -ie- spelling set from copy's -ee- may sometimes appear, but usually B's -ie- will reproduce his copy's. HEAR Spellings Pq FI -re &gt; -re 19 22 -r &gt; -r 1 -ea- &gt; -ea- 17 25 -e- &gt; -ea- 4 -ee- &gt; -ea- 1 Kable's conclusion that heare is B's spelling preference and that hear is a derived spelling is imprecise, although it is true that B prefers the internal -ea- spelling to -e- and probably to -ee , as well as tolerates -re and -r . B invariably follows all the final -re copy spellings of this word in both the Pavier Quartos and the Folio. Whether he actually prefers the final -re enough to alter an -r spelling of copy to -re is another question. The only final -r spelling we have is in Pavier copy and is retained. Hence, no compelling evidence exists that B prefers the final -re spelling or that he will always follow hear when it appears in his copy. HEART Spellings Pq FI -ea- &gt; -ea- 111 6 -a- &gt; -ea- 58 15 -a- &gt; -a- 24 -ea- &gt; -a- 1 -t- &gt; -t 152 15 -te &gt; -t 1 That B prefers the spelling heart is certain. In the Pavier Quartos, we find approximately 71% of the -a- spellings of copy altered to -ea- and approximately 29% of the -a- spellings that appear in copy reproduced. Had this practice continued in the Folio, at least 4 of the 15 -a- spellings in F1 copy would have been reproduced, but not a single one was. B simply retains copy hart all 4(R) times it appears in rhymes (matching, for instance, part ) and changes the 1(R) heart of copy in a rhyme to hart . Indeed, many of the hart forms in the Pavier Quartos also occur in rhymes; my research is incomplete, but so far I find only 1 hart reproduced from Pavier copy's hart that is not in a rhyme. Hence, Kable's statistics appear to be somewhat misleading. When the internal -a- spelling occurs in B's work in a short line and is not in a rhyme, the chances seem fair, given the present evidence, that it derives from an -a- spelling in copy. However, when an internal -a- spelling occurs in a rhyme in B's work and matches spellings such as part and dart , we cannot be certain whether -a- or -ea- was in B's copy. HEAVEN Spellings Pq FI h- &gt; h- 36 10 H- &gt; h- 8 H- &gt; H- 1 h- &gt; H- 2 Alice Walker has distinguished A's use of the capitalized spelling Heaven from B's use of the heaven prior to Folio Mac. , and she has remarked that both compositors capitalize the word from Mac. onward. Kable finds that B invariably follows the heaven spelling of Pavier copy and that he reduces to lower case 8 of the 9 Heaven forms of Pavier copy. In the Folio, B's copy for MND , MV , and LLL invariably has the lower-case spelling, and B follows all these forms. He retains 2 of the 3 heaven spellings of Q5 1H4 but alters the other 1 to Heaven , and he changes the 1 (+1L) heaven of copy to Heaven on sig. Gg1 of Rom. (set after Mac. ). Hence although (as Walker notes) B prefers heaven at the beginning of F1 and Heaven at the end, his change of preference may have begun before the Tragedies were set. HERE Spellings Pq FI -ee- &gt; -ee- 134 (133) 19+4R -e- &gt; -ee- 126 (201) 27+1R -e- &gt; -e- 137 (138) -ee- &gt; -e- 13 (16) B clearly prefers the spelling heere both in the Pavier Quartos and in the Folio. But whether here in his work is a reliable clue to the spelling of his copy is not as certain. The evidence of the Paviers suggests that it is. In spite of the fact that there may be minor inaccuracies in Kable's figures, 30 it seems that ordinarily here will not appear in B's Folio work under normal conditions and that, if it does appear, the chances are about 9 to 1 that it comes from copy. HOUR Spellings Pq FI -ou- &gt; -ou- 34 15 -ow- &gt; -ou- 11 1 -ow- &gt; -ow- 2 B clearly prefers the internal -ou- spelling of this word. What is doubtful is the extent of his tolerance for -ow- . Since, on the evidence of the Paviers, B will retain only 14% of the -ow- forms of copy, at most, the fact that in F1 he alters the only -ow- of copy to -ou- need not imply that by the time he set F1 B no longer reproduced the -ow- spelling. The evidence of B's tolerance for the -ow- spelling is so meagre that we cannot determine whether he is likely to reproduce an occasional -ow- spelling of copy when setting the Folio. JUDGMENT Spellings Pq FI -ge- &gt; -ge- 12 5 -g- &gt; -g- 1 -ge- &gt; -g- 1 -e- &gt; -ge- 1 Neither the Pavier nor the Folio evidence indicates that B simply prefers the spelling judgement (as Kable maintains). That B usually reproduces this form (the most frequent of Pavier and Folio copy) is clear. That he prefers judgement to judement is implied by his change of the 1 judement spelling in Pavier copy to judgement , but obviously this single piece of evidence does not warrant the broad conclusion that B has a blanket preference for judgement . Rather, the slender evidence indicates that B is usually inclined to follow his copy's spelling of this word and that—if he favors either judgement or judgment at all—he prefers judgment . LABOR Spellings Pq FI -ou- &gt; -ou- 20 4 -o- &gt; -ou- 1 The evidence of B's preference—as distinguished from consistent toleration—for the internal -ou- spelling of this word is not very strong. The only evidence of this preference is his alteration of the 1 labor'd spelling of Pavier copy to labour'd . This alteration should not, of course, be discounted because it occurs in an inflectional form. Moreover, since no internal -o- spellings appear in either B's Pavier or Folio work, and since B retains all -ou- spellings of his Pavier and Folio copy, it is tempting to conclude that he actually prefers internal -ou- . But because the alteration of labor'd to labour'd could be mere random variation, such a conclusion is unjustified. All that is certain is that B is inclined to reproduce internal -ou- spellings of this word. LION Spellings Pq FI -y- &gt; -y- 20 1+1SD -i- &gt; -y- 5 1 -y- &gt; -i- 2 11 The peculiar nature of the evidence for this word in F1 makes conclusions about B's practice difficult. The evidence of the Paviers suggests a possible slight preference for lyon . But since most of the Folio evidence comes from the passage in MND where B apparently decided to use lion in the dialogue and lyon in speech-prefixes and stage-directions, 31 we cannot either confirm or deny Kable's conclusion that B prefers lyon . Elsewhere in F1, the 1 lion of Q5 1H4 is changed to lyon , but the 1 lyon of LLL copy becomes lion . Quite probably B is indifferent to the lion and lyon spellings. LOSE Spellings Pq FI -o- &gt; -o- 6 2 -oo- &gt; -o- 18 2 -oo- &gt; -oo- 6 5 The 39 instances of this word in the Pavier Quartos and in B's Folio work from known printed copy indicate that B always follows his copy in its invariable use of final -se , occasionally reproduces the internal -oo- spelling if it appears in copy, and generally prefers the internal -o- spelling. The evidence for the Paviers is probably incomplete, but the spellings we now have indicate that B prefers internal -o- in both the Pavier Quartos and the Folio, and that when -oo- appears in his work under unexceptional circumstances, it almost surely comes from copy. 32 What is not clear is how frequently we can expect B to follow his copy's -oo- spelling. In the Pavier Quartos he follows only 25% of the -oo- spellings of copy; in F1 he retains 5 out of 7—71%—of these forms. Perhaps his tolerance of the internal -oo- increased between the years 1619 and 1621; perhaps the meagre evidence of F1 is a bit misleading. In any case we should expect at least 25% of the -oo- spellings in Folio copy to be reproduced. MADAM Spellings Pq FI -d- &gt; -d- 75 13 -dd- &gt; -d- 3 -dd- &gt; -dd- 1 -m &gt; -m 45 (42) 2 -me &gt; -m 11 (14) 8 -me &gt; -me 16 (14) 3 -m &gt; -me 7 (8) B seems to prefer the internal -d- spelling of this word. The likelihood that he will reproduce the -dd- spelling of his copy is difficult to assess, and his practice of setting the final -m/-me spelling alternative is problematic. Kable's conclusion that an internal -dd- spelling appearing in B's work derives from the spelling of copy is untrustworthy because it rests on only a single instance of retention of the -dd- copy spelling; the -dd- spelling does not occur in known Folio copy. In both the Pavier Quartos and the Folio, B reproduces all -d- copy spellings and alters most -dd- forms to -d- . His preference for the -d- spelling seems clear, but whether he was inclined regularly to follow a small proportion of the -dd- forms of his copy is uncertain. B's attitude toward the alternative final -m and -me spellings is also unclear. Although he may favor the -m spelling while tolerating -me forms of his copy, if we hypothesize that -m is B's preferential spelling, the changes of Pavier copy's -m to -me yield a random-variation factor (9%) that is high enough to suggest that B was indifferent to the -m/-me alternative. The Folio spellings are too few to resolve the question. It seems that B was inclined to alter copy -me spellings to -m and to retain a large proportion of the -m forms of his copy. What is unclear is whether this is a result of indifference or of settled preference, and if the latter, whether his inclination to set the final -m became stronger between 1619 and 1621. Because this is unclear, we cannot know whether in F1 he will actually prefer the final -m and whether we can expect the final -me in his Folio work to derive from his copy. MAID Spellings Pq FI -i- &gt; -i- 21 2 ('maid') 6 ('maiden') -y- &gt; -i- 9 2 -y- &gt; -y- 2 Both the word 'maid' and the word 'maiden' should be discussed here. B prefers the internal -i- spelling of both. That the internal -y- spelling in his work necessarily reflects the spelling of copy is less certain. Any attempt to assess B's disposition to reproduce his copy's -y- is complicated by an apparent inconsistency in Kable's account. Twice in discussing 'maid' he mentions that B retains 2 -y copy spellings (pp. 28, 61); however, in his "word-count" (p. 99) no -y- spellings are listed as B's Pavier spellings of 'maid' (Kable ostensibly does not include statistics on 'maiden'). In my own (incomplete) count of the Pavier spellings of 'maiden', I find B following copy's internal -y- 2 times: once in setting maydens and once in setting mayden-head . Perhaps these are the 2 cases Kable refers to. In any event, when a -y- spelling occurs in B's Folio work under normal conditions, it probably derives from the copy spelling, for that B retains a very small proportion of -y- forms of his Pavier copy is clear, though that this disposition to tolerate -y- continues in F1 is not actually proven by the present evidence. MASTER Spellings Pq FI -a- &gt; -a- 28 2 (sb.) 1 (vb.) -ai- &gt; -a- 93 (114?) 3 1 -ai- &gt; -ai- 4 1 B prefers the spelling master but will occasionally set maister under the influence of this spelling in copy. This is the conclusion implied by the evidence of the Pavier Quartos and of the Folio about both the noun and verb. B will set a large proportion of -ai- spellings of copy as -a- , but when -ai- appears in his work under normal circumstances, it almost certainly derives from copy. METHINKS Spellings Pq FI me- &gt; me- 18 1 mee- &gt; me- 2 -kes &gt; -kes 8 1 -ks &gt; -kes 8 1NL -ks &gt; -ks 2 -kes &gt; -ks 2 B prefers the initial me- and final -kes spellings of this word, and he prefers to set either the hyphenated me-thinkes or the closed methinkes forms. He is intolerant of the mee- spelling, but he will occasionally set -ks and the spaced me thinkes under the influence of such forms in copy. B's habits for this word appear to be stable. His preference for the me- spelling is revealed by his alteration to me- of all the mee- spellings in Pq copy so far recorded and is suggested by his retention of all me- spellings of Pq copy and by his retention of the me- spelling of F1 copy. His preference for -kes is displayed in both the Paviers and the Folio spellings, including his alteration (not influenced by justification) of the 1 (NL) -ks spelling of Folio copy to -kes . The Pavier Quartos exhibit B following copy -ks 2 of the 10 times it appears and altering 2 of the 10 -kes copy spellings to -ks . There is no such disposition to set -ks displayed in F1, but this lack may be the result of the scarceness of Folio evidence. Equally as important as B's spelling of this word is his treatment of its word-division. B prefers to unite the components of this compound: he closes up the spaced elements of his Pavier copy 9 (+2L) times and inserts a hyphen when his copy has a space 5 (+5L) times. He never separates the word when Pavier copy has it closed up, but he does reproduce the spaced compound 6 of the 15 (+2L) times it appears spaced in Pavier copy. In F1 he sets 1 (NL) me thinks of copy as methinkes and follows copy in setting me thinkes 1 other time. In setting 2 (L) spellings in long lines, he omits Folio copy's hyphen, leaving the word spaced; since the space seems to be narrower than the hyphen (although I cannot be sure that it is), these two spellings may be the result of justification. It seems safe, then, to infer from the available evidence (not complete for the Paviers 33 ) that, when B separates this compound in a line not affected by justification, the spaced form probably comes from his copy. MIND Spellings Pq FI -de &gt; -de 35 4 -d &gt; -de 26 -d &gt; -d 4 Kable finds that B prefers the spelling minde but that he will occasionally set the form mind under the influence of copy. The Folio statistics neither confirm nor deny these findings, but they tend to support them. Although the Folio evidence is slender, it seems to conform to the pattern exhibited by analogous words and clearly defined by the Pavier evidence. If Kable's statistics are right, when the spelling mind occurs under normal conditions in B's work, it will almost surely derive from copy. He will alter most but not all of the mind spellings of his copy to minde in short lines. MISTRESS Spellings Pq FI -is &gt; -is 20 -esse &gt; -is 6 1 -esse &gt; -esse 41 1 -is &gt; -esse 2 -es &gt; -is 6 -es &gt; -esse 2 1 -eris &gt; -ris 32 other forms 4 In the Folio plays set from known printed copy, B continues to prefer mistris and mistresse to the other possible spellings of this word. Thus, as Kable properly notes, Alice Walker's conclusion that mistresse is A's spelling and mistris B's is imprecise. However, though B will set either, he seems slightly to prefer mistris to mistresse . For instance, at MND , 430, he alters Q2's mistresse ( mistresse in Q1) to Mistris in F1. Although he is relatively tolerant of both spellings, it would not be surprising if B slightly favors mistris in Folio plays set from manuscript or annotated quarto. MONTH Spellings Pq FI -n- &gt; -n- 10 8 -ne- &gt; -n- 4 -ne- &gt; -ne- 2 -n- &gt; -ne- 2 1 Kable concludes that B prefers the spelling month and that when moneth appears in his work it almost surely reproduces his copy's spelling. The Folio evidence does not confirm this conclusion, but it does suggest a pattern that was not identified by Kable but is present in the Pavier spellings. What is at issue is B's treatment of the internal -n-/-ne- alternative spellings of this word, and as has been indicated, B's habits for internal spellings are generally unaffected by inflection and compounding. Therefore, not only B's spelling of the singular but also his spelling of the plural is pertinent to defining his practice. The Pavier evidence for the singular inevitably leads to Kable's conclusion. However, in setting the plural, B not only retains many of the months forms of Pavier copy, but also changes 2 months spellings to moneths . If we argue that the internal -n- is B's preference, these last 2 changes yield a high random-variation factor of over 11%, which suggests that B's spelling of this word borders on indifference. It is, of course, possible that B spells the plural differently than the singular, but this random-variation factor is found in the Folio spellings of the singular. The random-variation factor of 11%—constant from the Paviers through the Folio—makes B's spelling practice for this word on the whole definable, but unpredictable in any one case. Given the present evidence, the odds are only 2 to 3 that an -ne- spelling in B's work duplicates on -ne- spelling in his copy. MURDER Spellings Pq FI -d- &gt; -d- 31 1 -th- &gt; -d- 8 (9) -th- &gt; -th- 26 (25) -d- &gt; -th- 8 (7) 1 It appears that B is relatively indifferent to the alternative internal -d- and -th- spellings of this word. He prefers neither more than the other, and therefore the spelling of his copy exerts a strong influence upon his own spelling of the word. If B is responsible for the Pavier spellings, 34 then when the internal -d- occurs in his work in short lines the chances are about 4 to 1 that it duplicates the spelling of copy. The chances are almost the same that a -th- spelling in B's work under normal circumstances derives from the spelling of copy: 74% of the -th- copy spellings are reproduced by B. However, these observations rest almost wholly on Pavier evidence; hence conclusions about this word must remain tentative, at least until the controversy over the Paviers is settled. NEAR Spellings Pq FI -ee- &gt; -ee- 33+4L 5+1L -ea- &gt; -ee- 9 1L -ea- &gt; -ea- 2 1 -e- &gt; -ee- 2 -re &gt; -re 39 2 -r &gt; -re 1 B's preferred spelling for this word is neere , and he sometimes reproduces the internal -ea- spelling when it appears in his copy. Although the evidence of his preference for the final -re spelling slim, the evidence that B prefers the internal -ee- spelling both to -ea- and to -e- is more substantial. This evidence is stronger for his preference of -ee- to -ea- , partly because, as has been shown, spellings in long lines are as valuable as those in short lines, since the letters a and e are both one-en thick. 35 While preferring the internal -ee- spelling to both -ea- and -e- and while probably favoring the final -re , B is led to set internal -ea- about 23% of the time it appears in his copy. If an -ea- spelling occurs in his work under normal conditions, it should almost certainly duplicate a copy spelling. NEITHER Spellings Pq FI -i- &gt; -y- 3 1 -i- &gt; -i- 13 3 -y- &gt; -i- 1 -e- &gt; -ey- 1 From the limited evidence that is available it appears that B favors the spelling neyther but is very tolerant of neither when it occurs in copy. The Pavier statistics suggest that B retains roughly 80% of the neither spellings of his copy and changes the other 20% to neyther . The same practice is exhibited in B's Folio work from known printed copy. Unfortunately, no neyther spellings occur in Folio copy, and we cannot, therefore, view B treating the neyther of his copy. Hence, we cannot determine whether he actually prefers neyther or is indifferent to the -i-/-y- alternative. If neyther is supposed to be his preferred spelling, the single alteration of Pavier copy's neyther to neither yields a random-variation factor of 4.5%, which is high but not unreasonable. Although for the present it is not clear that B actually prefers the form neyther , it is clear that he reproduces 75% to 80% of the neither spellings of his copy and that when neither appears in his work in short lines, the odds are good that it duplicates his copy's form. OH Spellings Pq FI Oh &gt; Oh 99+20L (109+13L) 3+1L O &gt; Oh 18 (16) O &gt; O 242+44L (190+19L) 43+4NL+16L Oh &gt; O 2+1L (3) ô &gt; O 2 Both B's O and Oh spellings are reliable clues to the spelling of his copy; if O appears in his work the chances are excellent that either O or ô was in his copy, and they are almost as good that an Oh spelling in his work derives from copy. The evidence of both the Paviers and the Folio leads to these conclusions, but since the evidence of the Paviers is more ample than that of the Folio, we should examine its implications first. The spellings can be interpreted three ways: (1) B has no real personal preference for either spelling, and hence is usually influenced by his copy's spelling but also occasionally disregards it and sets Oh or O randomly; or (2) B prefers the spelling Oh to O , but because he infrequently sees Oh in his copy does not develop a strong preference and tends to tolerate the vast majority of non-preferred O copy spellings; or (3) two compositors, B and "G," both normally reproduce their copy's O and Oh spellings, but the former very slightly prefers O and the latter slightly prefers Oh (Andrews' theory, p. 381, which is damaged by the fact that "G" replaces an Oh of copy with O ). The Folio evidence affords no help in deciding between these hypotheses, but it does indicate that B's habit of spelling this word remained constant over the years from 1619 through 1623. Folio copy, like Pavier copy, has predominantly O spellings, and B reproduces every single one. Only 3 (+1L) Oh spellings appear in Folio copy, but B retains all of these. Folio copy also has 2 ô spellings (I gather Kable did not distinguish between O and ô), and B sets these as O . With relatively few Oh spellings in B's copy, or his work for that matter, it is difficult to know whether or not he actually prefers Oh to O ; were it concluded that he does, the factor of random variation for this word would be an encouraging 0.71%. Moreover, having no evidence from the Tragedy section of F1, we cannot be positive that B did not develop a preference for Oh late in the setting of the Folio. What is clear is that both spellings of this common word are rather reliable clues to the spellings of B's copy at least in the Comedy and History sections. The odds are at least 9 to 1 that an O spelling in B's work derives either from his copy's O or ô. The odds are 7 to 1 that an Oh spelling in B's work duplicates the spelling of his copy. Ordinarily, B will alter, on the average, only 1 out of every 7 O spellings of his copy to Oh ; only 1 out of 10 Oh spellings in his copy will he alter to O . Finally, we may note that apparently the occurrence of this word in a long line rarely influenced B's spelling of it; usually the word is the first in a speech (either prose or verse) and hence is unlikely to be affected by justification. PIECE Spellings Pq FI -ee- &gt; -ee- 12 2 -ie- &gt; -ee- 1 2 The change of copy's piece to peece in the Pavier Quartos is meagre evidence for the conclusion that B prefers the spelling peece . However, in F1, B alters 2 other piece copy spellings to peece . Thus, he alters to peece every piece spelling he encounters in copy and retains every peece form; although the evidence is still slender, the chances are that the spelling peece is indeed B's preference. POWER Spellings Pq FI -er &gt; -er 19+2L 8+1L+1NLSD -re &gt; -er 2 -ers &gt; -ers 6 1 -ers &gt; -'rs 1 The 2 alterations of copy's powre to power in the Paviers indicate that B favors the spelling power , even though Cauthen noted 18 power forms and 7 powre forms in Lr. (the latter may occur in E's pages). B's invariable retention of power in the Paviers and in the Folio tends to support this hypothesis. However, B's habit for the plural is still indeterminable. It is possible, but not proven, that B's apparent preference for power does not extend to the plural and that he might set pow'rs and powres as well as powers indiscriminately; it is also possible that the single -ers &gt; -'rs in Pq is random variation. PRAY THEE Spellings Pq FI prethee &gt; prethee 4 3 prithee &gt; prethee 5 prithee &gt; prithee 1 prethe &gt; prethee 4 prethe &gt; prethe 1 prythee &gt; prethee 1 prethy &gt; prethee 4 pray thee &gt; prethee 3 prethee &gt; prythee 1L other forms 4 Alice Walker contends that B favors the spelling prethee until setting the late Histories, and the evidence of the Paviers and F1 supports this contention. The word occurs in B's Folio work from known printed copy only in IH4 . There B retains prethee all 3 times it appears in copy, and this evidence, along with the Pavier evidence of a preference for prethee , substantiates Walker's conclusion. Moreover, the 1 (L) change of prethee to prythee also supports her statement that B begins in IH4 to prefer prythee , since justification could not mechanically affect B's spelling of this word, even though it occurs in a long line (990). However, the other 3 cases of prythee that Walker notes in early IH4 occur in pages that B may not have set; hence, they are not presently admissible as evidence of B's practice. RUN Spellings Pq FI -n &gt; -n 4 -nne &gt; -n 12 5+1SD -nne &gt; -nne 13 -ns &gt; -ns 2 -nnes &gt; -ns 1 -nnes &gt; -nnes 2 -ns &gt; -nnes 2 The evidence is excellent in support of the conclusion that B prefers the spelling run and that when runne appears in his work it derives from the spelling of his copy. If B, and not C, is the compositor of MV , 29, 36 then B reproduces 1 runne spelling of Folio copy in accordance with the disposition, evident in the Pavier Quartos, to tolerate runne occasionally. But even if this spelling is B's, he retains only 14% of the runne copy spellings when setting F1, whereas he retains over 50% in the Paviers. This decline in the proportion of runne spellings reproduced may be owing to a hardening of B's preference for run . Nevertheless, if Kable's statistics are essentially correct, when runne appears in B's Folio work under normal circumstances, it should duplicate the spelling of his copy. We cannot say whether the pattern observed in B's spelling of the singular extends to the plural. The evidence of Pq indicates that it does not; in F1 the plural occurs only in long lines. SHOW Spellings Pq FI -e- &gt; -e- 53+7L 3+1L (sb.) 10+8L (vb.) -o- &gt; -e- 22+1L 1L 5+1L -o- &gt; -o- 13 1 -w &gt; -w 51 3 7 -we &gt; -w 11 -wes &gt; -wes 15 1 2 Because we cannot tell from Kable's statistics how many of the spellings that he lists occur in literal rhymes, precise conclusions about these words are presently out of the question. Nevertheless, it seems likely that B prefers the final -w and -wes spellings of both the noun and verb, that he favors the internal -e- spelling of both, and that when an internal -o- spelling appears in his work in unrhymed words (in long or short lines), it duplicates his copy's spelling. Kable's statistics (which ignore not only rhyme but the part of speech of the words) show B retaining all of the 60 the internal -e- spelling of both, and that when an internal -o- spelling ings, while altering the other 23 (22+1L) to internal -e- . In F1 the only show spelling appearing in B's work from known printed copy is in a rhyme (matching know ). However, since inflection generally did not affect B's habits for internal spellings, his retention of 1 of the 4 showes forms in Folio copy verifies the hypothesis that he occasionally reproduces an -o- spelling of his copy. B prefers the internal -e- spelling, but—when literal rhyme is not involved—an -o- spelling in his work ordinarily derives from copy. SON Spellings Pq FI -nne &gt; -nne 79 13 -n &gt; -nne 8 -n &gt; -n 4 -nne &gt; -n 1 B prefers the spelling sonne but will set son under the influence of copy. The 1 alteration of copy sonne to son yields a low random-variation factor of 1%. Although B prefers the spelling sonne , he will reproduce up to 30% of the son forms appearing in his copy. When the spelling son occurs in his work under normal conditions, the chances are good that it duplicates a copy spelling. SUIT Spellings Pq FI -ui- &gt; -ui- 1 3+1R -u- &gt; -ui- 1 -u- &gt; -u- 20 1 -ors &gt; -ors 1 -ers &gt; -ers 2 1 B is inclined to reproduce both the internal -ui- and the internal -u- copy spelling of this word; he also appears to follow the copy spellings sutors and suters . The 1(R) suite in F1 is good evidence of B's tendency to reproduce this spelling because B ignores the opportunity to match sute with the rhyming mute . The single alteration of sute to suite may show us B developing a preference for internal -ui- , and it may be anomalous. But in any case, the evidence (as yet probably incomplete for the Paviers) indicates that whenever internal -u- appears in B's work in unexceptional circumstances, it almost certainly duplicates a copy spelling, and when internal -ui- appears, it probably duplicates a copy spelling. The evidence that B follows faithfully the spellings sutors and especially suters is slight but consistent. SUMMER Spellings Pq FI -u- &gt; -u- 1 1 -o- &gt; -u- 5+2L 4 -o- &gt; -o- 7+1L The combined Pavier and Folio evidence is not abundant, but it is consistent in suggesting that B prefers the internal -u- spelling of this word and occasionally tolerates the -o- spelling when it appears in his copy. If Kable's figures are right, B's inclination to tolerate internal -o- spellings of copy may have declined during the years 1619 through 1623, but when an internal -o- spelling appears in his work, it should duplicate a copy spelling, even in long lines. TRAITOR Spellings Pq FI -ai- &gt; -ai- 35 1 -ay- &gt; -ai- 24 1 -ay- &gt; -ay- 1 B's preference for the internal -ai- of this word has long been known. Only 1 repetition of an -ay- spelling in Pavier copy exists to support Kable's inference that internal -ay- in B's work duplicates his copy's spelling, but in view of B's strong preference for internal -ai- generally, the inference is not unreasonable. Since a final -our spelling of this word occurs only 1 time in B's known copy, we cannot define his habit of spelling the ending, even though he alters this 1 -our to -or and reproduces all of the -or spellings of his copy. B's treatment of the final -or/-our spelling alternative for other words is known to be inconsistent and inconstant; hence, conclusions about his treatment of final -or and -our for this word are out of the question. VILE Spellings Pq FI -le &gt; -le 3 -lde &gt; -le 1 -lde &gt; -lde 2 1 -ld &gt; -lde 5 B's practice of spelling 'vile' is still not perfectly clear. Cauthen assigned the spelling vilde to B and vile to A, and the evidence of the Paviers could be interpreted as supporting this notion, even though Kable understandably remains noncommittal about its implications. If the meagre statistics show anything, it is that B prefers vilde to vild , tolerates both vilde and vile , and may even slightly prefer vile to vilde . The chances are that vilde in B's Folio work derives from the vilde of his copy or from vild , under unexceptional circumstances. WIDOW Spellings Pq FI -dd- &gt; -dd- 8 -d- &gt; -dd- 3 1 -d- &gt; -d- 4 -dd- &gt; -d- 2 -w &gt; -w 12 1 -we &gt; -w 1 -wes &gt; -wes 3 The case for widdow as B's habitual preference is not so strong as Walker and Kable indicate. It is true that the change of Folio copy's 1 widow to Widdow supports the notion of B's preference for internal -dd- that is suggested by the 3 changes of Pavier copy's -d to -dd- . But the 2 alterations of Pavier copy's widdow to widow yield a high random-variation factor of over 11%, if widdow is considered the preferred spelling. Indeed, widdow may have been the form B favored, but the spellings that we have as evidence—those set from known printed copy—may be the product of indifference, not settled preference. The chances are that they are not, but for now B's spelling practices for this word must remain undetermined. WIND Spellings Pq FI -de &gt; -de 14 3 (sb.) -d &gt; -de 20 2 -d &gt; -d 3 -des &gt; -des 2 2 -ds &gt; -des 2 -ds &gt; -ds 2 The evidence indicates that B prefers the spelling winde and occasionally reproduces a wind spelling of copy. 37 It is not clear that this pattern extends to the plural—that B prefers windes but will set winds under the influence of copy. The conclusion regarding the singular finds support not only in the evidence for this word alone, but also in B's treatment of the analogous 'behind' and 'blind'. When the spelling wind occurs in B's work, it almost surely duplicates the spelling of copy. (These conclusions would not be materially altered by the attribution of MV , 26-28, to B, since there he retains Q1's winde and alters its wind to winde .) The evidence that this pattern extends to the plural is less convincing because there is less of it. YEAR Spelling Pq FI -ea- &gt; -ea- 20+4L 4+2L -ee- &gt; -ea- 7+3L 1+1NL+3L -ea- &gt; -ee- 1 -re &gt; -re 11 1 -res &gt; -res 15 4 B prefers internal -ea- and perhaps final -re and -res when spelling this word. The evidence for the -ea- preference is substantial and rather uniform throughout Pq and F1. The spellings in long lines are primary evidence because justification could not materially affect -e-/-a- variation, since these letters were equally thick. The single case of -ea- &gt; -ee- in Pq yields a normal random-variation factor of 2.9% and need not imply a different compositor. Incidentally, B's preference for -ea- in this word is inconsistent with his habits for other analogous words. Since copy has only -re and -res spellings, we cannot be sure that B actually prefers these forms, but his invariable retention of them might suggest that he does. YOUNG Spellings Pq FI -o- &gt; -o- 17 (16) 1 -ou- &gt; -o- 8 (9) 6 -ou- &gt; -ou- 28 (30) 2 -o- &gt; -ou- 11 B's treatment of this word is a matter of some debate. Probably by the time he sets the Folio he prefers the spelling yong but sometimes tolerates young when it appears in his copy. Alice Walker assigned the yong spelling to B and young to A, but Kable finds that in the Pavier Quartos B is largely indifferent to the internal -o-/-ou- distinction. Andrews accounts, without total success, 38 for the discrepancy by assigning to "B" an -o- preference and to G an -ou- preference. If Kable is right, the indifference B displays in the Paviers seems to have been abandoned by the time he set F1; if Andrews is right, there is no conflict between the Pavier and Folio evidence. Thus, in any case, the Folio evidence, although it is slender, indicates that B prefers the internal -o- spelling of this word in F1. A corollary to this inference is that in B's Folio work the chances are better than in his Pavier work that an -ou- in a short line which he set duplicates the spelling of his copy. This review of the evidence now at hand on B's spelling of selected words has shown that some spellings hitherto considered useful in identifying his work or his copy are unreliable, and it has clarified the status of others as clues to his work or his copy. But, more important, it has confirmed the existence of a large group of words that, with various degrees of reliability, can serve as evidence that B set a given page or evidence of the spellings in the copy that he used. Not all words about which we now have evidence could be discussed here, but examination of them indicates that about 100 spellings are useful clues to the presence of B in pages of F1 not yet certainly assigned to a compositor, and that another 100 are important because in B's work they normally derive from his copy. The study of Compositor B's spelling habits when setting from known printed copy enables us to identify both preferred and derived spellings in his Folio work. When carefully used with due regard for the kinds of considerations outlined above, these spellings promise to help us decide whether or not B set pages in F1 which as yet are only tentatively assigned to a compositor and to attack the crucial question of the nature of the copy behind certain Folio plays. And since B was perhaps the least conservative compositor of the Folio, such study suggests that similar examinations of the spelling practices of other Jaggard compositors may well achieve comparable results.</field>

Virginia 1972, pp. 2, 366-379. 4 The printing of the pages studied here, including the question of copy, is discussed in Hinman, II, passim, and Reid, "Spellings," pp. 366-379. One dissenting voice recently raised is that of Andrew S. Cairncross, in "Compositors E and F of the Shakespeare First Folio," PBSA , 66 (1972), 369-406. Cairncross believes that many of the pages attributed to B were set by E. Apart from its inability to explain the intercalary formes associated with E, Cairncross' argument uses spellings which for various reasons often seem to have little evidential value. The discussion immediately below touches on some of the problems—the influence of rhyme and justification and the matter of compositorial uniformity. Another is the question of what kinds of spellings constitute good evidence for identifying a workman. The assumption adopted here is that not tolerances of copy spellings, but preferences—primarily defined by actual changes of various copy spellings (when known) to the preferred form, and only secondarily by habitual reproduction of that form—are the basic spelling evidence for identification of compositors. 5 "The Compositors of Shakespeare's Folio Comedies," SB , 26 (1973), 61-106. 6 See Philip Williams, "Two Problems in the Folio Text of King Lear ," SQ , 4 (1953), 453-455. 7 More on these matters may be found in Reid, "Justification and Spelling in Jaggard's Compositor B," SB , 27 (1974), 91-111; "Compositorial Spelling and Literal Rhyme: The Example of Jaggard's B," The Library , 5th ser., 30 (1975), 126-133; "Spellings," pp. 172-184. 8 T. H. Howard-Hill mentions these two issues specifically in "Spelling and the Bibliographer," The Library , 5th Ser., 18 (1963), 10-11. For the sake of convenience and clarity, I use the term "constancy" to refer to the stability of a compositor's spelling practice over a period of time, and reserve the term "consistency" for the uniformity of his treatment of analogous forms. "Consistency" has been used, not illogically, to cover both meanings by Howard-Hill and others, but a convenient distinction between the temporal and analogical senses seems useful. 9 The Pavier Quartos and the First Folio of Shakespeare , Shakespeare Studies Monograph Series, No. 2 (1970), ch. 2. 10 See, e.g., D. F. McKenzie, "Compositor B's Role in The Merchant of Venice Q2 (1619)," SB , 12 (1959), 75-90, and Kable, esp. pp. 8-14; also Williams, "New Approaches," p. 12. 11 Peter W. M. Blayney, "'Compositor B' and the Pavier Quartos: Problems of Identification and Their Implications," The Library , 5th Ser., 27 (1972), 179-206; John F. Andrews, "The Pavier Quartos of 1619: Evidence for Two Compositors," Diss. Vanderbilt 1971. 12 More detailed examination may be found in Reid, "Spellings," ch. 2. The matter of -ie/-y touched on below is discussed at length on pp. 79-95. 13 Thus Andrews' use of mechanical evidence seems, at least at first sight, to be more successful than his use of spellings; very often the differences in spelling habits identified in Q2 Lr. fail to materialize consistently in the other Pavier Quartos. Some spellings may be useful as evidence supporting a well-established case for two compositors, but it seems unlikely that many will provide positive evidence that cannot be neutralized by conflicting spelling evidence. Were two compositors finally proven, then spellings would probably have to be relied on to identify these with the compositors of F1, since the different formats of the books of 1619 and 1623 would make some mechanical evidence inapplicable to both. 14 Thus it seems we must reject Andrews' conclusion that "Kable's generalizations seem more likely to be applicable to Compositor G [his current name for the second compositor, changed from his original "F" to avoid confusion with the F hitherto identified with A in F1] than to Compositor B" (p. 342). The spelling practices of B in F1 are like those of Andrews' "G" as much as they are like those of his "B," and B's spellings are more often like the spellings of both, combined, than they are like those of either. Hence, unless we are to assume that between 1619 and 1621 B altered his practices in such a way that they came to incorporate those habits of "G's" that previously distinguished his work from B's, we must conclude that generally B's and "G's" spelling practices are essentially identical and that Kable's statistics therefore give us a fair picture of most of B's habits, though they are sometimes inaccurate, may include some words not actually set by B, and may even misrepresent some of B's spellings of a few words. 15 Other examples are discussed in Reid, "Spellings," ch. 2; see esp. pp. 128-130. 16 Throughout I use single quotes to distinguish words as substantives (given in modern American spelling) from their actual spelled forms in the texts, which are italicized here. This and several other related matters are discussed in my "Spellings," pp. 27-35. 17 This problem receives more detailed treatment in Reid, "Spellings," pp. 184-191. Allowing for a certain proportion of insignificant spellings in a compositor's pages also helps circumvent the problems raised by the recent debate over whether lost rounds of proof-correction occurred in printing Renaissance books. When we study only the earlier forms of surviving press-variants and yet allow for unexplained anomalies, we automatically treat as insignificant any presumably uncorrected spellings in a compositor's pages that may be atypical because they in fact represent a proof-reader's unidentified corrections, and thus we virtually eliminate the possibility that such spellings can adversely affect conclusions. The question of B's consistency which is touched upon below receives more thorough discussion in Reid, "Spellings," pp. 130-133. 18 Discussion of some other words may be found in ch. 4 of Reid, "Spellings"; the complete Folio statistics on each word dealt with here are in Appendix I. I include here only those spellings that examination has shown are legitimate, or "pertinent," evidence of B's normal habits. Terms such as "the Folio evidence," "the Folio spellings," and "the Folio statistics" refer, of course, to the spellings in the Folio pages under consideration here (see fn. 4 and its text). 19 "Normal," or unexceptional, conditions means circumstances in a text under study which (as preceding examination has shown) did not cause B to adopt certain spelling practices that were exceptions to his normal habits. For instance, at the end of a crowded long line the spelling hart would not be legitimate evidence that hart was in B's copy, since we know that B often justified lines by using such short spellings, regardless of the spelling of his copy; likewise, hart in a rhyme with part would not be pertinent evidence, since B sometimes set this spelling in such a rhyme even when heart was in his copy. The following discussions assume reference to normal conditions as a general rule and assume that allowances must be made for the fact that between 1% and 5% of all spellings are, theoretically, insignificant evidence due to chance (i.e., mere random hits). 20 Kable, pp. 49-55, 59-62; E. E. Willoughby, The Printing of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1932), pp. 55-59; Walker, esp. pp. 8-9; Hinman, I, 182-183, 369-424; Cauthen, "Compositor Determination in the First Folio King Lear ," SB , 5 (1952-53), 73-80, esp. 78; Andrews, pp. 345-389; Blayney, passim. Throughout I assume Andrews' assignments of much of Pq to his compositor "G" and Blayney's to his "G" and "H" are unproven. 21 For a more thorough discussion of the basic premises behind this approach, see the Introduction to Reid, "Spellings," esp. pp. 7-10, 22. 22 That is, Kable, Andrews, Blayney, and Reid, "Spellings." In a few cases the evidence cited for Pq supplements that given by Kable, or in rare cases by Andrews or Blayney. This supplementary evidence is taken only from Pq plays now considered Shakespeare's and is, therefore, not complete; these relatively few spellings were found with the aid of a Shakespeare concordance rather than through new, independent collations of all the plays, and hence the spellings in the Pq reprints of A Yorkshire Tragedy and Sir John Old-castle are not represented here. The statistics for these few cases appear in Appendix II of my "Spellings." 23 Kable's statistics come mostly from his "Appendix," but those for 'do', 'go', and 'here' are on pp. 12-13. For convenience I follow his listing of the words and his habit of considering homographs (e.g., 'art' sb. and vb.) in one discussion, if they appear to be spelled identically by B. However, in listing the evidence from F1, I identify the words by part of speech in round brackets. See Reid, "Spellings," pp. 32-33, for more on this point. 24 The fact that the number of occurrences in Pq and F1 are about equal suggests that Kable's evidence may be incomplete, but it does not necessarily imply that conclusions drawn from the full statistics would have to be different. Indeed, the evidence from F1 for B retaining art can stand on its own. 25 Andrews' figures on this word and 'bloody' are combined, but comparison of his totals with Kable's shows that he finds fewer instances of -ou- retained than does Kable (31 versus 40). Thus the apparent discrepancy between Folio B's rate of retaining -ou- and that in Pq may be very small. (Andrews argues that "B" never retains -ou- whereas G frequently does, but the distinction could be merely hypothetical.) 26 See Reid, "Spellings," pp. 63-66, for discussion of the generic -ee-/-ie- habit in F1. 27 See Kable, p. 76, and Reid, "Spellings," p. 305, for the details. 28 Andrews, pp. 281-289; Blayney, p. 188. The situation in Pq is now quite confused. Blayney's new evidence leads him to conclude that Kable has reversed his spellings from deere &gt; deare to deare &gt; deere , but I think this fanciful reconstruction must be rejected, as Andrews' figures show. It seems more likely that Kable's statistics are incomplete, as they sometimes are for other words; besides, Blayney's theory that deare is preferred in Pq would not explain the changes of -ea- to -ee- in forms (e.g., 'dearer') other than the simple one. If Andrews' figures are correct, there are three possible explanations for the Pavier evidence. (1) Andrews' explanation, that Compositor G prefers the -ea- spellings while "B" prefers -ee- ; this explanation has one drawback—"B" gratuitously introduces an -ea- . (2) That "B" in 1619 had a preference for -ee- but temporarily varied from it (cf. his handling of -ie/-y ); the fact that practically all the -ea- &amp;c.nt;hanges occur in Lr. and in MV , plays apparently set at approximately the same time, would support this view. (3) That in 1619 B had not settled on a preference for either deare or deere ; this view finds support in the fact that by 1621 he still had not developed a generic preference for either -ea- or -ee- but preferred both neere and yeare and was indifferent to the spelling in some other analogous words. The chance that the second explanation is correct makes impossible final conclusions about the value of -ea- as a clue to B's Folio copy, given the slimness of the Folio evidence. On an additional dearer reproduced in F1 ( 1H4 , 3073), see Reid, "Spellings," p. 30, fn. 2. 29 On this question, see Reid, "Spellings," pp. 371-374. 30 Both Andrews (p. 355) and Blayney (pp. 185-186) produce statistics for this word that differ from Kable's, but they do not agree with each other any more than they do with Kable. The figures cited here are Andrews'. 31 One direction ( MND , 2065) has Lion , but we should discount this because it is not in Q2 and, having been supplied by an annotator or by B himself, was set under peculiar and unknown influences. Otherwise, B uses Lyon invariably in the prefixes and the direction that was in Q2 ( MND , 2021). 32 Andrews' figures on this word (p. 360) show more instances of the same spelling practice, but whether he includes only the spellings of 'lose' and not those of 'loose' is not clear. 33 Andrews (p. 364) provides more complete information on the hyphenation of this word in Pq, but he ignores the other elements of form discussed here. See n. 22. 34 Andrews (p. 378) contests this view, arguing that "B" prefers -th- and G -d- . The Folio evidence is unfortunately so meagre that it alone cannot settle the question. However, if Andrews' view is right, it forces the conclusion that curiously enough both "B" and G are very tolerant of the spellings they each do not prefer. 35 See Reid, "Justification," pp. 97-98. 36 On this question, see Reid, "Spellings," pp. 371-374. 37 This conclusion assumes that Kable includes only 'wind' sb. in his statistics (as I do) and not 'wind' vb. 'bend.' If both were included, the evidence for one, especially regarding B's retention of wind , might be weaker than that for the other. 38 The handling of the matter is less than successful because G must change 2 -ou- copy spellings to -o- , as well as retain 10 -o- spellings, to fit Andrews' compositorial assignments (p. 361). Blayney (p. 204) finds 7 changes of -ou- to -o- in Pq MV alone, whereas Andrews finds only 6.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">John Murray's Family Library and the Cheapening of Books in Early Nineteenth Century Britain by Scott Bennett</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The 1790's was a decade of revolution in both France and England. In France the political structure was being recast, while in England economic change of the profoundest order was under way. Two aspects common to the revolutionary situation in both countries were a widening literacy and a new sense of the common reader's importance. The bibliophile Isaac D'Israeli described this change in his book on the upheaval in France, saying that "within the present century a great Revolution was effected in the human mind. Philosophers ceased to be isolated. It is but of late that the people have been taught to read , and still later, that they have learned to think." 1 Questions that before had been of little consequence outside intellectual and professional circles were now becoming the basis for political agitation. Ideas were not simply being popularized; rather, knowledge was being democratized, so that ideas could become social levers used to defend or upset the established order. One of the less spectacular but important features of the democratization of knowledge in Britain was the cheapening of books and other printed matter during the first half of the nineteenth century. Not all books were made less expensive, of course, for the period saw both the continuance of expensively produced books in small press runs and the establishment of the three-decker novel selling at a guinea and a half. But alongside these practices, printers and publishers were experimenting with cheaper forms of publication aimed at a mass reading audience. Richard Altick's survey of the history of British publishing between 1800 and 1850 makes it clear that it was the "discovery" of the common reader that excited publishers most during the period and stimulated their most innovative practices. 2 The discovery might be a fearful or a hopeful one, depending on the publisher's attitude toward the established order, but all were alike eagerly involved in both responding to and creating the conditions for the democratization of the printed word. One early venture in the cheapening of books was the Family Library, a series of five-shilling volumes published between 1829 and 1834 by John Murray, then London's most distinguished publisher. The Family Library offered readers new works, not reprints, at low prices. Inexpensive editions of England's "standard" writers had for some time been widely available, most notably in the series of John Bell (drama, starting in the 1770's), John Harrison (prose essays, 1780's), and John Cooke (poetry, 1790's). More recently, Charles Whittingham and John Limbird were publishing inexpensive editions of British poets and novelists during the 1820's. Even new titles were sometimes available cheaply—if they had failed commerically in the hands of their original publishers. James Lackington in the 1790's and Thomas Tegg in the 1820's thrived on selling what other publishers could not. These remainders, along with reprints of standard writers and the confections of William Lane's Minerva Press, very largely constituted the books available to readers with shillings rather than guineas to spend during the first quarter of the century. It was not until the end of the 1820's, with the publication of the Family Library and other series like it, that new non-fiction works were widely and inexpensively available to the common reader. The Family Library was innovative in a second and equally important respect. Limbird and Tegg were responding to commercial opportunities in only the most direct way: they sold what books they could. But there were many printers and publishers who defined their interests and their audience in class terms—men like Richard Carlile who so zealously defended the freedom of the poor man's press. It is only to be expected that the newly felt cleavages between the rich and the poor, the powerful and the powerless should be articulated by publicists firmly allied with the poor. It is much more remarkable, though probably not less to be expected, that those on the other side of social divisions should endeavor to disseminate among the common reader their own understanding of the new conditions. The Family Library and a handful of other publications like it embody a remarkable effort to publish across class lines at a time when class divisions were newly felt to be threatening the fabric of national life. 3 These books are, most simply put, counter-revolutionary documents. They illustrate not an audience finding its publisher, but publishers trying to create an audience. So when a number of London and Edinburgh publishers, including not least of all John Murray, behaved in the late 1820's "as if they stood on a peak in Darien, beholding for the first time a vast sea of common readers" (Altick, p. 274), what they saw was much more than the opportunity to profit in a new market. The most imaginative and responsible of them saw also the opportunity to speak to the common reader in such a way as to heal the fundamental divisions created by the emerging industrial order. The present essay deals only with the commercial innovations of the Family Library—the cheapening of printed matter for mass distribution to the common reader. 4 A chronological list of the volumes in the Family Library and its companion Dramatic Series is given at the end of this article. These fifty-three volumes were among the first new non-fiction published for the common reader. Murray's most important predecessors had been the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, which began its noisy campaign in 1827, and Archibald Constable. Constable's Miscellany , also begun in 1827, was the only series of inexpensive non-fiction published by a well-established commercial publisher before the Family Library; the Miscellany , like Murray's Family Library, was wholly dependent upon an individual businessman's resources. So when Murray began publication of the Family Library in 1829 he was entering commercial territory only tentatively explored. He did not have the advantage of others' experience that the host of publishers who followed him in the 1830's and 1840's did. The financial history of the Family Library therefore has the interest of any pioneer venture, and is the more worth detailing because of the paucity of any published records on book-production costs during the period. The surviving ledgers document how one publisher endeavored to issue new books of high quality at a low price for the common reader. The prospects for success in such a venture were not at all bright. Plans for the Family Library were laid in 1828, and in that year Charles Knight, a publisher for the S.D.U.K., was warning that original publications intended for the poor could not be self-supporting, much less profitable. He deprecated the alternative of "gratuitous, and therefore suspicious distribution" and argued that "no great and satisfactory [moral] improvement can be effected, through the unassisted results of trading competition." 5 Murray had set out to challenge this view, and during the first year or so of publication it appeared that the Family Library might well succeed. The supposed virtues of the market system and trading competition might prevail in the march of intellect as well as in the manufacture of cotton cloth. The first two volumes of the Family Library were a biography of Napoleon and were addressed to the questions of revolutionary change. They had been written by the series editor, John Gibson Lockhart, who had also been editor of Murray's influential Quarterly Review since 1826. Lockhart's Life of Napoleon was an adaptation of Sir Walter Scott's much longer book, which had originally been planned for Constable's Miscellany but had grown to an unwieldy size. Scott's nine volumes, selling for 94s.6d., had been a success, but Lockhart's adaptation of it, selling at 10s., was even more widely purchased. The two works illustrate perfectly the way traditional book-production methods and experiments in cheaper books existed side by side in the late 1820's. Lockhart and Murray could hardly have hoped for a better beginning for the Family Library. Both volumes of the Napoleon sold out soon after publication and by 12 September 1829 the Literary Gazette reported, auspiciously, that all the "early volumes [of the Library] are already out of print" (p. 601). This initial success was undoubtedly aided by the early and widespread attention the Library had received. It was reviewed in almost all the London and Edinburgh journals and newspapers that concerned themselves with literary matters, and favorable word of the Library spread rapidly throughout the country as well. The new series was well reviewed in, among other papers, the Falmouth Packet , the Plymouth Herald , the Brighton Gazette , the Colchester Gazette , the Oxford Herald , the Berkshire Chronicle , the Gloucester Journal , the Birmingham Journal , the Sheffield Mercury , the Liverpool Times , the Durham County Chronicle , the Carlisle Patriot , and in both the Glasgow Herald and Free Press . The Library found its way quickly to readers in the colonies too. A friend of Lockhart, for instance, wrote in September 1829 from the Cape of Good Hope to thank him for a copy of the Napoleon : "I have seen a great many copies of it here, &amp; tis well liked." 6 Murray achieved this success using only his normal methods of book distribution. Very little information is available on this crucial matter, but what there is suggests he handled the Library in the same way he did his other publications—by direct sales to individual book-sellers throughout England. William Wakeman and John Cumming in Dublin and Oliver and Boyd in Edinburgh acted as Murray's agents in those cities, and they were entitled to return to him any unsold stock of the Family Library. In September 1829, during the first success of the Library, the Glasgow bookseller Thomas Atkinson wrote Murray to say that, though the general agency for the series in Scotland could be in no better hands than those of Oliver and Boyd, "individually however something might be done if not to excite interest—which is already largely done—at least to sustain it. Exertion in this way shall not be wanting on my part." Allan Cunningham, who had written for the Family Library, now wrote to Lockhart to recommend Atkinson, explaining that the Glasgow bookseller had "a ready and a clever pen with the command of two newspapers—I rather think three. . . . He has sold 36 copies of the First vol. of the Painters— and that is something" (NLS MSS 934, ff. 11, 13). With booksellers rivaling one another to promote the series, the Library's prospects were at the outset certainly good. "Let Mr. Murray proceed as he has begun," wrote one reviewer, "and the Family Library will yield to not one of the numerous publications of the day, whether they be cheap or dear." 7 Murray and Lockhart did keep up their good beginning, and by the summer of 1830, it seemed that financial success would also certainly follow. Murray usually kept impeccable records, and in July 1830 he confidently wrote to Lockhart that "the Family Library continues to prosper as you will I hope be satisfied of when you have the accounts." His optimism survived even the account made up in August, when it became evident what large sales were necessary: It is no small gratification to find that errors excepted you are not disappointed at the result of our first year Campain [sic] — for I had very unintentionally from the Clerk's rough estimate led you to believe that the balance would be more favourable—but you see the enormous sale required to realize any profit from so large an outlay—10,000 cops of Napoleon— leaving nothing (NLS MSS 931, ff. 93, 95). This letter suggests that, while neither Murray nor Lockhart was seriously dissatisfied with the Library's financial performance in 1830, the series was not fully living up to their hopes for it. Another indication of trouble, its significance evident only in retrospect of course, is the fact that in 1831 the Perth Mechanics Library, with £27.13.2½ to spend on books, purchased Bentley's Standard Novels, Blackwood's Magazine , twenty-four parts of the Library of Entertaining Knowledge, the whole of the Library of Useful Knowledge, and one volume of Constable's Miscellany , but nothing from the Family Library. 8 One can only suppose that this was in some measure typical of the common reader's lack of interest in the Family Library. Monthly publication had begun in March 1829 and continued for five years, though after 1831 the books appeared with increasing irregularity. In the thirty-eighth volume, published in April 1833, the proprietors claimed (in the advertisement published with the book) that sales of many Family Library volumes had exceeded 20,000 and that expenditures on copyrights had totaled more than £10,000. These claims stretched the truth with respect to sales and so point to the financial difficulties of the Library, difficulties that Murray was finally unable to overcome. By April 1833 more than £10,000 had in fact been spent on copyrights, but several hundred pounds of that sum had been paid on books that for one reason and another were never published. None of the volumes had sold 20,000 copies, nor did any of them ever reach that figure. Lockhart's biography of Napoleon came closest—having sold 19,950 copies by November 1834, when Murray remaindered the Library—but no other title even approached this figure. A few other successful books in the Library sold between 10,000 and 15,000 copies, but too many others sold fewer than 5,000. With such uneven sales revenue, the Library was unable to meet its expenditures for almost two-thirds of the period during which Murray published it. It is possible to reconstruct the waning fortunes of the Family Library with some precision because two ledgers concerned with it have survived. One of these is a retrospective record, made up from other cost books evidently no longer extant; it provides detailed information on the costs incurred for each volume in the Family Library as well as on miscellaneous expenditures for the whole series. It also reports, not very accurately, the income realized on sales. More reliable income figures may be developed from a second ledger that details the number of books sold along with a date for each entry. It is possible to construct from this second ledger a picture of the course of sales for each volume and to determine roughly the manner of its distribution, for sales to agents in Edinburgh and Dublin and from Murray's shop itself—sales that presumably were confined largely to London booksellers—are distinguished from sales to the "trade" in general. In what follows, the first of these ledgers is called the cost ledger and the second the sales ledger. Together they tell almost everything one needs to know about the finances of the Family Library. 9 The cost and sales of one of the Library volumes, John Blunt's Sketch of the Reformation in England , published in December 1831, will illustrate the figures that are available for reconstructing the history of the series' finances. Blunt's book is signed [A] 4 B-X 8 Y 4 and has 168 leaves, paginated [i-viii], [1] 2-327 [328]. There are typically 35 lines per page, measuring 113 (119) x 67mm; there is but one illustration, a woodcut of Paul's Cross, Cambridge, on the title page. The following were Murray's direct costs in producing 8,000 copies of the book; his overhead expenses went largely unaccounted for. copyright purchase £315. 0. 0 composition 26.15. 6 corrections 21. 4. 0 stereotyping 28.17. 6 paper (168 reams &amp;c.mmat; 25s) 210. 0. 0 coldpressing (2s per ream) 16.16. 0 illustration 3. 0. 0 printing 100.16. 0 binding (8,000 &amp;c.mmat; 17.0.0 per 1,000) 136. 0. 0 wrappers (8,000 &amp;c.mmat; 16s per 1,000) 6. 8. 0 entering copyright 2. 0 advertising 34. 8. 5 ------ Total £899. 7. 5 Some of these items require comment. Murray's printer for the volume was A. &amp; R. Spottiswoode and it is from their ledgers, rather than from Murray's, that the separate entries for composition, corrections, stereotyping, coldpressing, and the actual printing come. 10 In Murray's ledgers, these items are lumped together as "printing." This practice makes it impossible to separate the cost of composition from that of correction for most of the books. And given the habit of authors at this time of cheap labor to revise printed proof-sheets rather than their own manuscripts, the cost of corrected type varied greatly from volume to volume, as their authors revised more or less. In those books for which separate figures are available, the cost of correction runs from 80% to 200% of the original composition. Where a volume was simply reprinted with no authorial revision, as with Irving's Sketch-Book , the cost of corrections was of course minimal. Aside from corrections, the most significant additional variable would have been the amount of special setting necessary—notes, verse, and the like. Even recognizing these variables, it is possible to estimate composition costs now probably about as accurately as Murray himself could have: the cost per page of corrected type might run from 2s.1od., the cost of Blunt's book, to as much as twice that. Making stereotype plates from this would cost an additional 1s.9d. per page. These costs were stable throughout the publication of the Family Library, which observed the same format in every volume. The cost of paper was also stable; Murray paid 25s. a ream for Blunt's volume and for volumes 3-4, 13-14, and 21-27, while for the others he paid 26s. The paper was of good quality; the sheets were probably foolscap size, producing trimmed pages of about 6” x 4” in size. Coldpressing was a process by which the paper was prepared for fine printing by pressing it at great pressure between glazed boards. 11 Paper for all the volumes in the Family Library was prepared in this way. Where the illustrations had to be worked separately, as was often the case, that printing cost was itemized separately in the cost ledger. But for Blunt's book it appears that only the cost of procuring the cut is itemized. The binding is a printed calico used throughout the Family Library, which was apparently the first publication to use this method of meeting the need for cheap publisher's bindings. 12 On the back cover appears a list of the volumes of the Library then in print. The entries in the sales ledger indicate the month of publication, the printer, and the number of copies printed along with any overrun that was available for sale. Murray ordered 8,000 copies of Blunt's book and there was no overrun. The sales are itemized as follows: 19 December 1831 Shop 840 Trade 3,158 31 December Shop 350 22 January 1832 Shop 75 Oliver &amp; Boyd 500 Wakeman 300 2 February Shop 50 14 February Shop 25 25 February Shop 75 2 April Shop 52 1 June Shop 50 21 June Shop 50 8 November Shop 45 12 November Shop 35 31 December Shop 25 3 January 1833 Shop 75 21 January Shop 25 5 February Shop 30 14 March Shop 70 C.H. Sale 277 25 April Shop 50 February 1834 C.H. Sale 185 17 June Shop 25 6 July Shop (Rivington) 50 11 August Shop 30 2 October Shop (Rivington) 50 25 October Shop 44 26 November Tegg 1,459 --- Total 8,000 Murray sold Family Library volumes at the standard trade discount of one-third off list price, 25 volumes counted as 24—another convention of the trade; he realized 3s.4d. on each volume sold, or £16.0.0 on every hundred. Blunt's book made a profit for Murray; he needed to sell 5,625 copies to cover his direct costs and had done so within fourteen months of publication, in addition to distributing 136 copies for copyright deposit and review purposes. He finally sold 6,541 copies before remaindering the book to Thomas Tegg. About half of his sales were to the "trade"—this included the initial large sales in the month of publication and the two annual coffee house sales. In addition, Murray sold some 2,121 copies directly from his own shop, presumably to booksellers in and near London, and sent 500 to Oliver and Boyd in Edinburgh, and 300 to William Wakeman and John Cumming, his agents in Dublin. The sales to Rivington were intended for members of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Rivington was publisher to the Society and had written in May 1832 to inquire on what terms the Society might buy Blunt's book. Murray's answer was that he would sell it 25 as 24 at 3s. in quires (i.e., unbound). 13 It is not clear that Murray finally sold the books to Rivington in quires or that he allowed any discounts on the Family Library at his annual coffee house sales. In the cost ledgers, where individual balances were struck for each volume, sales are always figured at 25 as 24 at 3s.6d. If the books were ever sold at any other price there is no indication of it and Murray absorbed the difference in cost himself, silently. The sales pattern for Blunt's book is typical: upon publication Murray regularly sold to the "trade" between a third and a half of his print order. He could look for large sales thereafter only at his annual sales. Typically he sent a few hundred copies to Edinburgh and to Dublin and could expect modest continuing sales from his own shop. Blunt's book is unlike many of the others in the series because it continued to sell fairly well up to the time Murray remaindered the whole Library to Thomas Tegg. Tegg received nineteen copies more than indicated here because Murray's agents in Edinburgh and Dublin finally returned to him that number of unsold copies of the books. Offering to sell unbound copies to Rivington was evidently as near Murray ever came to publishing his books in forms other than their normal one. Both Constable and the S.D.U.K. issued books in parts as well as in complete volumes, and Murray's reluctance to follow their example must have limited the sales of the Family Library at a time when the common reader could afford books only as a luxury. The Library could hardly attract the experimental purchases that its rivals, published in parts, might. The decision against part issues marks more clearly than anything else the nature of the audience Murray envisioned—people who were well enough off to be able to venture at least five shillings, hopefully every month, on books. In a period when few unskilled laborers earned as much as 20s. a week, and many had to live on less than 10s., Murray's price meant that the Family Library was probably only rarely purchased by anyone who could not afford the comforts of the lower middle and the more prosperous working classes. Full information on costs and sales, similar to that given here for Blunt's volume, is available for each volume in the Family Library and for the six-volume Dramatic Series that accompanied it. It is possible to construct from both ledgers a final balance sheet for the Library that itemizes general categories of expenditures and reports income more accurately than the figures given in the cost ledger alone. 14 The balance sheet is given in Figure I; two of the accounting procedures used there must be explained. First, the value of complimentary copies and of the volumes returned from Edinburgh and Dublin is counted as an expenditure because these copies are included in the sales ledger as "sold"—though of course they were not. In effect, therefore, the revenue calculated from the sales ledgers and reported here is inflated by the inclusion of these copies in the ledger undiscriminated from the copies on which income was actually realized. Second, the sums for income on sales, for the value of complimentary copies, and for the value of copies returned from Murray's agents are only approximations. These figures were calculated, as Murray did in his ledgers, at the standard 25 volumes counted as 24 and sold at 3s.6d. each, though the books were not always sold in units of 25, as is evident from the sales record of Blunt's volume. Because there is no indication of what Murray charged his customers for lots of other than 25, it is impossible to determine his exact income. Instead, income has been calculated to the nearest 10s. on the basis of the total sales each quarter. Some of the items in the balance sheet require comment. Volumes 48 and 49 of the Family Library, the last two volumes of Gleig's History of British India, figure separately because of the history of their publication. Murray suspended publication of the work in 1830; the rest of it was published jointly by Thomas Tegg and Murray in 1835, after the Library had been sold to Tegg. Murray's copyright payments to Gleig, his advertising of the volumes, and a few miscellaneous costs represented his principal in the final volumes of the work. Murray also had expenses that could not be assigned to individual books. He three times during the course of publishing the Library totalled these miscellaneous general expenses, which included the purchase and partial printing of several books never published, printing and paper for prospectuses and other sundries, advertising, and occasional other expenses including the costs and financial settlement of a legal dispute. Finally, as mentioned before, Murray was content to let his overhead expenses go largely unaccounted for. Only during the final accounting in December 1834, after the Library had been sold, did Murray determine the cost to him of having carried the Library at a loss for almost three years and having insured the unsold stock. His worksheets indicate he also thought of charging for warehouse costs, but then abandoned the idea. Murray determined the overall financial position of the Family Library only three times: once as of June 1830 and then again in December of 1831 and 1834. The first of these balances is dated June 1830 but must have been determined retrospectively in the fourth quarter of 1830 because it was based on final sales, not completed until then, of the first printing of volumes 3 through 11 and the second printing of volumes 1 and 2. This accounting showed a profit of £4,363.2.3 but disregarded both the cost of reprinting six volumes and all expenses and income realized during the last two quarters of the year. The cost ledger indicates that Murray and Lockhart split these profits equally between them, these being the only profits they ever took out of the Library. Afterwards the series was always in the red. The other two accountings were not retrospective, but were current, showing the balance that obtained in December 1831 and December 1834. The first of these current balances showed the Library to be £8,220.3.1 in the red; the second, after the sale to Tegg, showed a final loss of £319.12.3. Figure I, by contrast, shows a final profit of £717.16.8, a difference of £1,037.8.11. This difference is accounted for by two factors. First is a total print-order overrun of 6,654 volumes included in the sales ledger figures but not reported in the retrospectively compiled cost ledgers. In effect, Murray lost account of income amounting to £1,065 by failing to co-ordinate his two sets of books. The second factor is the difference introduced by calculating income from sales to the nearest 10s. only and at more frequent intervals than Murray used, as explained above. This difference is not great; it increases sales income only £27.11.1, or .046% of the total. The figures in the cost and sales ledgers are to be reconciled, then, as follows: £1,065. 0. 0 sales income not included in the cost ledgers 319.12. 3 less final loss shown in cost ledgers ------------ 745. 7. 9 27.11. 1 less computational difference ------------ £ 717.16. 8 final profit The books were closed on the Library in December 1834, though several years later, in 1843, Murray was able to sell for £50 the copyright of one of the books he had planned to publish in the Library but never did. The fact that within a year Murray's calculations swung from a profit of £4,363 to a loss of £8,220 indicates how rapidly the fortunes of the Family Library could change and that more frequent intervals of accounting would provide a more accurate picture of the Library's financial condition. It has been possible to construct quarterly balances from the two ledgers as follows (see Table I). First, the approximate income for each quarter was calculated from the record in the sales ledger. Then the quarter's actual expenditures on copyright and other direct production costs were determined from the cost ledger, as were the averages of miscellaneous expenses for each quarter. These miscellaneous expenses were averaged as follows: For the period April 1829 to June 1830 miscellaneous expenses entered in the cost ledger 375. 0. 0 2,278 complimentary copies counted as sold in the sales ledger 364.10. 0 copyright deposit costs 1. 4. 0 ----------- Total 740.14.0 AVERAGE expenses for each of five quarters £148. 2.10 For the period July 1830 to December 1831 miscellaneous expenses entered in the cost ledger 2,394. 7. 8 2,384 complimentary copies of the Family Library and Dramatic Series counted as sold in the sales ledger 381.10.0 copyright deposit costs 1.18. 0 ----------- Total 2,777.15. 8 AVERAGE expenses for each of six quarters £ 462.19.3 For the period January 1832 to December 1834 miscellaneous expenses entered in the cost ledger 1,534.11.11 2,090 complimentary copies counted as sold in the sales ledger 334.10. 0 copyright deposit costs 2. 4. 0 copyright purchase for vols. 48-49 612. 2. 6 miscellaneous expenses for Family Library 375. 0. 3 miscellaneous expenses for the Dramatic Series 37.19. 0 2,687 volumes returned from Edinburgh and Dublin 430. 0. 0 interest on deficit, 1832-1834 822. 0. 5 insurance 75. 0. 0 ----------- Total 4,223. 8. 1 AVERAGE expenses for each of twelve quarters £ 351.19. 0 These average miscellaneous expenses were then added to the direct expenses, giving a total expenditure and a balance for each quarter. Table I does not include the profits Murray and Lockhart took in 1830 or the income realized from the final sale to Tegg. These sums aside, it is clear that Murray over-estimated his balance as of June 1830 by £1,557.8.10, but that the deficit he determined at the end of 1831 was also over-estimated, by £1,471.16.5 when the profit taking of 1830 is allowed for. An analysis of the ledgers indicates three sources for the persistent deficits shown by the Family Library. First, the Dramatic Series, begun in April 1830, was a financial failure from the start. None of the six volumes issued covered costs, and the average loss on each was at least £191. Unlike the Dramatic Series, a majority (63%) of the first printings of the Family Library volumes proper not only cleared costs but earned a profit as well. The forty-seven first printings of these volumes showed an overall profit of at least £3441—a profit that was, however, more than offset by the miscellaneous general expenses that were incurred. These general expenses were thus the second source of Murray's losses. To these two factors a third must be added—the fact that eleven of the seventeen reprintings recorded in the cost ledger showed a loss when the Library was remaindered in 1834. And three of the six reprintings that did show a profit contributed together less than £120 to the financial welfare of the enterprise. Again the problem was that none of the volumes, including even those that sold best, was able to sustain sales over a long period. Lockhart's biography of Napoleon, seemingly an exception to this, nonetheless confirms the pattern. Where the second printing of the book showed a handsome profit of some £1500, the third printing showed a loss of almost £322. This third printing of 11,000 copies had been ordered in June 1830, only a year after the book's first publication and with 16,500 copies already sold. When Murray remaindered the Library three years later, he had sold only 3,721 copies of his last printing—about a third of it. Compared to its previous success, the book's sale had leveled off sharply and Murray again showed a loss on this printing of the most popular of the Family Library titles. The clearest single indicator of the Library's fortunes is a graph that plots the course of actual sales against those needed to break even—to cover both the direct and the miscellaneous expenses incurred each month, plus any deficit from the previous one. Disregarding such recurring costs as advertising and sales overhead, the break-even point for a single printing of a single book would be a single point, not a graph line. The break-even point of the Family Library can be represented here as a line not because of recurring costs (which Murray did not itemize as such in any event) but because new costs were incurred each quarter by the introduction of new titles or of reprinted ones, or in miscellaneous expenses. The break-even point changed each quarter because the makeup of the Library continually changed. Graph I depicts this changing financial position of the series. Averaging actual sales and the sales needed to break even makes it possible to represent the Library on a single line, instead of a line for each volume, and so to conceive of the Library as a single entity. That its sales should decline, as the graph indicates, is not surprising; that is the fate of all but a few books. It is clearly possible to make profits— considerable profits indeed—even on declining sales so long as the break-even point has been passed. Unhappily for Murray, the Library exceeded its break-even point in only two quarters—the last in 1829 and the first in 1830. Thereafter sales came very close to reaching the break-even point for about a year, but then the gap between the two opened and was never closed. That the Library was in the black during all of 1830 is to be accounted for by the favorable balances earned in 1829-1830, which proved sufficient to cover three quarters of marginally unprofitable sales. But that favorable balance had been exhausted by the end of 1830 and thereafter the persistent failure of sales to meet the break-even point was fatal to the success of the Library. The gap is usually between 400 and 500 sales per volume, but to close this gap any time after 1831 would have involved doubling the rate of sales, something that Murray clearly could not do. Measured by average sales, interest in the Family Library was very high during the first year or so of its publication but fell precipitously thereafter. In accounting for this, it is important to remember that the declining fortunes of the Family Library approximately coincided with a series of difficulties in Lockhart's family and with the political crisis occasioned by the reform bill finally passed in 1832. The last two months of 1830 saw the defeat of Wellington's anti-reform ministry and the first of the now famous Swing Riot trials; in the spring of 1831 Lord John Russell introduced a reform bill and a general election was held. In the fall the riots punctuating the reform agitation were at their height and a cholera epidemic was beginning. The turmoil of national life must have touched Lockhart, as he was editor of the influential Quarterly Review as well as the Family Library, and these public difficulties could only have been exacerbated by those within his own family—Scott's health was visibly deteriorating and Lockhart's young son, long in frail health, died at the end of 1831. Lockhart kept at his work all through this period, but the Library fell behind its goal of monthly publication. It is of course impossible to measure in what degree the flagging sales of the Library resulted from the distractions of Lockhart's own life or from the disturbances of public affairs. But it was widely felt at the time that the general preoccupation with reform severely limited the sale of books. Murray's experience with the Family Library seems to confirm that. It was in this period that income from sales began consistently to fall below expenditures, driving the Library irretrievably into the red. It was this state of affairs that Thomas Frognall Dibdin, the famous bookman, described in relating his visit with Murray during the reform crisis: I have long considered Mr. Murray as the greatest "FAMILY" man in Europe; and was therefore not surprised to find him surrounded by an extensive circle of little ones . A Family man is usually a cheerful man: but the note of despondence was to be heard even here . "The Quarterly" was, however, in full plumage. . . . So far, so good: yet the taste for literature was ebbing. Men wished to get for five , what they knew they could not formerly obtain for fifteen , shillings. The love of quartos was well nigh extinct. . . . Clear it was to him , that the dwarf had vanquished the giant— and that Laputa was lording it over Brobdingnag. 15 Murray's position seemed foolishly self-defeating. He had helped to shape the market for cheap books but could not supply it profitably; he could keep on only at the expense of his other publishing business. That the Library was failing financially was known to Murray and Lockhart at least as early as August 1831; for Lockhart in trying to mediate between G. R. Gleig and Murray over the latter's refusal to continue publication of the History of British India had then to explain that "the real secret of Murray's conduct is, that the speculation has proved less advantageous than he anticipated" (letter of August 1831, NLS MSS 932, f. 86). With the December 1831 accounting Murray knew how seriously in the red the Library was—some £8,220 by his calculation. Lockhart described the state of the booktrade, and of the Library, soon thereafter in a letter to Scott, saying that "the Booksellers continue in a very low state—but your Series, &amp; a similar one of Byron's life &amp; works, are thriving capitally. . . . The Quarterly has risen considerably of late; but all my other concerns are for the present dead." 16 And finally the affairs of the Library came to such a pass that on 30 March 1832 Lockhart wrote to Milman complaining that Murray "persists in keeping total silence to me " about it. 17 The silence cannot have lasted much longer, for it is clear that Murray had resolved to cut his expenses wherever possible. After the publication of Coleridge's Six Months in the West Indies in November 1832, there was much irregularity in the appearance of the remaining eleven volumes of the Library; and none of these represented a substantial new investment in copyright on Murray's part, except volume III of Tytler's Lives and volume VI of Cunningham's British Painters , the earlier volumes of which had usually proved successful. Murray already owned Coleridge's book, as he did also the books by Croker and Irving that he added to the Library in 1834; all these he could republish cheaply. He also finally published Tytler's Universal History , the copyright of which he had purchased three years previously, in 1830. Such activities suggest Murray thought of the Library as having failed, a supposition confirmed by Lockhart's letter to John Abraham Heraud of 11 February 1833. Lockhart returned the proofs of a volume of "Lives" Heraud had written for the series and explained: When the Fy Libry failed &amp; Murray refused to hear me as to any more books I ought to have sent these to you immediately but I was withheld by the strong hope I then nourished of being able to set afoot a Monthly Journal of some sort in which I desired to secure your assistance. . . . This hope has now also vanished—at least for the present I am obliged to abandon it. . . . The whole affair has been one of loss of time &amp; of money to me—but for this I have to thank my own imprudence (NLS MSS 786, ff. 69-70). After the publication of volume VI of Cunningham's British Painters in April 1833, nothing more appeared for eight months, until the republication of Irving's Sketch-Book in January 1834. It was little wonder that Lockhart's Edinburgh friend John Cay wrote in September 1833 to ask, "Is the Family Library gone to pot?" (NLS MSS 924, f. 100*). It pretty clearly had, and we have now only to look briefly at how Murray tried to contain his losses. He had of course already exercised the first of his options, to stop publishing new books. But there were other ways to economize, and it is instructive to see which of them he adopted because his choices indicate how Murray conceived of his undertaking even under the pressure of commercial failure. The cost of paper, printing, and binding were largely inflexible if the excellence previously achieved was to be maintained. Murray did not give way here; he kept on as he had begun in these most visible aspects of quality book production. But he could secure some elbowroom by controlling his expenditures on copyrights, illustrations, and advertising. That expenditures for these three things should vary considerably from quarter to quarter is not surprising, given the differences in authorship and the suitability of various titles for illustration. But a determination of the quarterly averages per volume in print of such costs shows that Murray gradually reduced advertising and sharply cut illustration expenses in 1832 and afterwards, but that he never stinted in the purchase of copyrights. Expenditures for advertising showed considerable variation, but except for the last two quarters of 1830 they ranged roughly between £25 and £75 per quarter per volume in print until the middle of 1832. In the last two quarters of 1830 advertising costs rose to £125-150, at just the time when the overall balance was beginning to slip, but Murray probably did not know this. His profit taking during this period suggests, on the contrary, that he was hopeful of success and may have been trying to secure it with increased advertising. Whatever the reason, advertising expenses fell back to the norm in 1831 and declined to the £0-30 range only after the middle of 1832. Expenditures for illustrations are equally various but show a much more pronounced downward drift. From 1829 to the third quarter of 1831, the average cost per volume in print of illustration ranged from £75 to £200; from the end of 1831 until the third quarter of 1833 the range was from £0 to £115; from the end of 1833 until the Library was remaindered the range was £0-25. Averaging copyright payments per volume in print for each quarter gives a misleading impression of the actual course of Murray's expenses because doing so associates payments with publication, which was not the case with Tytler's six-volume History , and because payments for the other books issued after November 1832 were essentially honoraria, as Murray already owned their copyrights. 18 This flexibility of republishing works he already owned was the only one Murray allowed himself, for he knew that he could not get good books cheaply. It was possible to turn a profit on the work of hacks, but Murray did not choose to do so. So long as he was publishing newly purchased books in the Family Library the range of average copyright payments per quarter was from £150 to £320, and he never paid less than £100 for any book published in the Library. In effect, he never fell consistently or significantly below his average copyright payment of £221.4.6. This average is some 23% higher than the "standard" copyright payment of £180 made for S.D.U.K. volumes. 19 Even in the face of failing sales and the prospect of considerable losses, Murray chose to publish the best books he could secure—or not to publish at all. For the end had to come if the Library could not be made to support itself. Murray had no alternatives but to succeed in his design or to abandon it, and his remaindering the Library to Thomas Tegg is clear testimony of commercial failure. Murray had set out in the Family Library to sell the best books he could as cheaply as possible. His basic tactic was to apply a brand name to a series of books and to rely on the general reputation of that name, as well as the individual books, to sell the series. By 1829 this could hardly have been called an innovation, but its application to mass-produced books intended for the common reader was. Not enough is known about the finances of the S.D.U.K. and Constable's Miscellany , Murray's predecessors, or of their many successors in the 1830's and 1840's, to be able to say generally how well such brand-naming in books worked, but Charles Knight's later disillusionment with the practice clearly resonates with the commercial history of the Family Library: Every experiment of this sort has shown that such collections of separate and independent works cannot rely upon a sale as a series. They come to be bought, each work by itself, according to its attractions for individual purchasers. Thence all those irregularities of sale, and consequent accumulations of stock, which press heavily upon the profits of those volumes which are successful. 20 Like so many others, including many publishers who were to follow him, Murray was unable to translate the publishing practices of the market in which he had first established himself into the market for the common reader. But to focus exclusively on this failure would be to miss what is perhaps the most significant part of Murray's endeavor. It may be true that he failed commercially because he refused to sell his books in part issues, because he was not at home in the market for cheap books, and because he was determined not to skimp his publications. But all that is only to say that he failed because he brought his best conception of his profession—his best self, to adopt the Arnoldian phrase—to bear on the attempt to shape social attitudes through the use of literacy. The true distinction of the Family Library, in even its commercial history, lies in Murray's attempt to make it a vehicle for reuniting a dangerously divided society, an attempt based on the recognition that if books could serve this purpose at all, then only the best books would do for the common reader. Murray might have won commercial success in other ways, but he had a better idea of his profession and aimed at considerably more than the profits he would more likely have made by publishing truly cheap books. The Edinburgh Literary Gazette had commented that among the various new series of books aimed at the common reader "cheapness is the god of their idolatry"—excepting only the Family Library, which was "undoubtedly entitled to bear away the palm" (20 June 1829, p. 82). Murray understood that he had to offer the common reader something more than a low price. That he did so earned him the praise of his contemporaries and a place of lasting consequence in the history of the democratization of knowledge in Britain.</field>

These overruns varied from less than 1% to some 8% of the print order, but for the seventy-two printings recorded in the sales ledger they averaged only 1.2%. Because these overruns were included in the sales ledger, they are included in the determination of income given in Figure I. 15 Bibliophobia (1832), p. 31. Dibdin has other stories to tell here of the distress for booksellers brought on by the reform crisis. 16 Letter of February 1832, NLS MSS 5317, f. 98; the series Lockhart refers to is Cadell's reissue of the Waverley Novels in 5s. and 6s. volumes. There is some irony in Lockhart's finding that the Quarterly offered surer support than the Family Library, as he had taken up the Library with the hope of making himself independent of the fortunes of the Quarterly . Lockhart had written to Scott two years before, in January 1830, that "I am every day more anxious to see this property [the Family Library] established on a sure footing because every day shows me more clearly the impossibility of the Quarterly being in these days of mutation the stepping stone to any permanent benefits in my case, unless I chose to sacrifice its interests to mine" (NLS MSS 3912, ff. 165-166). 17 Murray Archives, quoted in Andrew Lang, Life and Letters of John Gibson Lockhart (1897), II, 99. 18 Murray allowed £200 for the two-volume Sketch-Book but kept it himself; he had been losing money on Irving's new books for some time. 19 The S.D.U.K. "standard" is reported as a piece of gossip in the New York Book-seller's Advertiser , 1 (Nov. 1834), 84. 20 The Old Printer and the Modern Press (1854), p. 244. a The Literary Gazette for 24 Oct. 1829 reported that the book was "undertaken by an association of various scientific gentlemen,—one of the very highest being at their head" (p. 693). The Library of Congress Catalog of printed cards attributes authorship to James Rennie and John Obadiah Westwood, but it was Dr. Edward Ferguson who named the volume (see Lockhart to Murray, 10 Aug. 1829, Murray Archives). Rennie was briefly professor of natural history at King's College, London, and wrote on both insects and birds for the S.D.U.K. The Library of Congress can no longer verify the attribution to Rennie, and the present writer has found nothing else to associate him with the Family Library volumes. b Of the eighteen biographical sketches in this book, only the first six and the fifteenth are attributed to Macmichael by Herbert Spencer Robinson, editor of Macmichael's The Gold-Headed Cane (1932), p. xvi. Authors of the other biographies are not identified by Robinson; a 30 Sept. 1830 letter (Murray Archives) from Lockhart to Murray mentions a Dr. Hawkins as a co-editor. This may have been Francis Bisset Hawkins (see Boase). c The journal was edited for publication by Alexander Bridport Becher (1796-1876), hydrographer at the Admiralty and editor of the Nautical Magazine ; see Robin Hallett, ed., The Niger Journal of Richard and John Lander (1965), p. 33. d The editors of the Dramatic Series are named in the Murray cost ledgers. Vols. 1-3 and 5-6 were based on William Gifford's editions of Massinger and Ford, the latter first published by Murray in 1827. All these plays were carefully "adapted for family reading, and the use of young persons," as the title page of the Massinger promises. e These adjustments (amounting to only .018% of the total) are required because twelve sets of figures in the sales ledger fail to sum properly. It is impossible to say from the available evidence whether these errors were in the entry of sales, in the count of the books received from the printer, or in the number of volumes finally remaindered to Tegg. All three sets of figures have nonetheless been regarded as reliable—i.e., they are the most detailed numbers available—for various uses in the calculations made for this essay.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention by G. Thomas Tanselle *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scholarly editors may disagree about many things, but they are in general agreement that their goal is to discover exactly what an author wrote and to determine what form of his work he wished the public to have. There may be some difference of opinion about the best way of achieving that goal; but if the edition is to be a work of scholarship—a historical reconstruction—the goal itself must involve the author's "intention." The centrality of that concept to scholarly editing can be illustrated by W. W. Greg's "The Rationale of Copy-Text," 1 which, in the quarter century since it first appeared, has established itself as the most influential document in modern editorial theory. What Greg succeeded in accomplishing was to provide a rationale for selecting, and then emending, a basic text in those cases in which the choice was not made obvious by the historical, biographical, bibliographical, and linguistic evidence available. In such instances, an editor requires some guiding principle by means of which he can maximize the chances of adopting what the author wrote and minimize the chances of incorporating unauthorized readings into his text. Greg's now celebrated solution rests on the position that, if a finished manuscript of a text does not survive, the copy-text for a scholarly edition should normally be the text of the earliest extant printed edition based on the missing manuscript, for it can be expected to reproduce more of the characteristics of the manuscript than any edition further removed; variants from later editions which are convincingly shown to be revisions by the author can then be incorporated into this copy-text. Because authors who revise their work do not always give as much attention to what Greg calls "accidentals" (matters of spelling and punctuation) as to "substantives" (the words themselves)—and because such attention is in any event extremely difficult to determine—the copy-text usually remains the authority for accidentals; and if an editor adopts as authorial certain substantive variants in a later edition, he need not adopt all the other variants in that edition. Following this plan, the editor has a rational means for deciding among indifferent variants (he retains the copy-text readings); and the resulting critical text should be closer to the author's intention than any individual surviving form of the text. Although Greg did not address himself to the question of a precise definition of "author's intention," it is clear from such a summary that he considered the goal of an edition—and he was speaking of an "old-spelling critical edition"—to be the reconstruction of a text representing the author's final wishes about the version of his work to be presented to the public. In Fredson Bowers's words, the task is "to approximate as nearly as possible an inferential authorial fair copy, or other ultimately authoritative document"; 2 or, as he put it another time, following Greg's theory will produce "the nearest approximation in every respect of the author's final intentions." 3 If an author can be shown to have gone over his work with scrupulous care for a revised edition, examining accidentals as well as substantives, the revised edition (as the closest edition to an "ultimately authoritative document") would become the copy-text. Such a situation does not arise in most instances, but Greg recognized its importance: "The fact is," he said, "that cases of revision differ so greatly in circumstances and character that it seems impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule as to when an editor should take the original edition as his copy-text and when the revised reprint" (p. 390). In other words, an editor cannot avoid making judgments about the author's intention on the basis of the available evidence; the strength of those judgments, in turn, will depend on his historical knowledge and his literary sensitivity. 4 The job of a scholarly editor, therefore, can be stated as the exercise of critical thinking in an effort to determine the final intention of an author with respect to a particular text. 5 Just what is meant by "author's final intention," however, has not been made entirely clear, although at first glance the concept may seem so self-evident as not to require formal definition. Its use in connection with editing suggests that an editor's task is not to "improve" upon an author's decisions, even when he believes that the author made an unwise revision, and that an editor's judgment is directed toward the recovery of what the author wrote, not toward an evaluation of the effectiveness of the author's revisions. 6 Furthermore, the concept, as a goal of editing, would seem clearly to imply that, when an editor has strong reason to attribute a revision to the author, he will accept that revision as "final" on the grounds that, coming second, it represents the author's considered and more mature judgment. Greg suggests that this procedure is equally valid for dealing with wholesale revision when he writes, "If a work has been entirely rewritten, and is printed from a new manuscript, . . . the revised edition will be a substantive one, and as such will presumably be chosen by the editor as his copy-text" (p. 389). It is true that, in many instances, the simple interpretation of "final intention" to mean that intention reflected in the last alterations made or proposed by the author is workable enough and results in no ambiguity as to the aim of the editorial process. Nevertheless, such an interpretation does not answer certain theoretical questions which can assume practical importance in the remaining instances. Two basic kinds of situations particularly require further consideration: cases where the editor must distinguish authorial alterations from alterations made by someone else and must decide what constitutes "authorial intention" at such times; and cases where the editor faces alterations unquestionably made by the author but must still decide which readings represent the author's "final intention." In what follows I shall offer some preliminary comments on these two situations. But it is necessary to begin with at least a brief consideration of the meaning of "intention" for this purpose and with some recognition of the critical implications of attempting to discover "authorial intention."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The question of the meaning of "intention," both in general terms and in relation to works of art, involves many complex philosophical issues and has been widely debated. 7 Probably the best-known and most influential discussion of this subject in relation to literary works is W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley's 1946 essay, "The Intentional Fallacy," which takes the point of view that the author's intention is irrelevant to the process of literary interpretation and evaluation. 8 Although the essay is not as clear as it might be in distinguishing among kinds of intention, it has become a classic statement of the position that the critic should not be influenced in his examination of the literary work itself by any information relating to what the author thought he was saying in that work. Other writers have argued the opposing view—notably E. D. Hirsch, Jr., whose Validity in Interpretation (1967) supports the position that the meaning of a work is the meaning put there by the author. 9 Discussions of this kind, however, regularly take the text as given and focus on the activity of the critic as he faces that text; they do not raise the question of the authority of the text itself, apparently assuming that the text in each case is the text as the author wished it to be. 10 Of course, a corrupt text could equally well be the subject of critical analysis; 11 but the question of the bearing of authorial intention on interpretation would hardly arise unless the text is assumed to be what its author wished. One might at first conclude, therefore, that such discussions of intention are irrelevant to editorial work, conceived of as operating at an anterior stage and providing the material for the critic to analyze. If, in other words, one could assert that the editor's task does not involve critical decisions but only the recovery of factual information about what word or mark of punctuation the author wanted to have at each point in his text, one could then say that any effort to understand or assess the "meaning" of the text is an entirely separate matter and that the possibility of an "intentional fallacy" applies only to this interpretive and evaluative activity. 12 It is immediately apparent, however, that the job of the editor cannot be so regarded. If the aim of the editor is to establish the text as the author wished to have it presented to the public (and we shall postpone any consideration of other possible editorial aims), he cannot divorce himself from the "meaning" of the text, for, however much documentary evidence he may have, he can never have enough to relieve himself of the necessity of reading critically. Suppose, for example, that the only extant text of a work is a fair-copy manuscript in the author's hand. The editor in such a case cannot simply reproduce the text mechanically, without thinking about its meaning: there is always the possibility that the author, through an oversight or slip of the pen, did not write down what he meant to write, and the editor who is reading critically may be able to detect and correct such errors, or at least some of them. It is an act of criticism, however elementary, for an editor to recognize that where the author wrote "the the" he actually meant "to the." In other instances it may be equally obvious that the author cannot have meant what he wrote, and yet it may be impossible to say with certainty which of several possible corrections conforms with what he had in mind. Yet the editor will probably find it necessary to make some correction, since the reading of the manuscript is plainly wrong. When two or more texts of a work exist and there are differences between them, there may be no conclusive evidence to show which differences are the result of the author's revisions and which are not. Yet the editor must decide which of the readings to accept at each point of variation. These decisions are based both on whatever external evidence is available and on the editor's judgment as to how the author was most likely to have expressed himself at any given point. This judgment in turn is based on the editor's familiarity with and sensitivity to the whole corpus of the author's work and on his understanding of the individual work involved. He may be specifically concerned only with the author's intended meaning in one sentence, or even one phrase, but the interpretation of that sentence or phrase may depend upon the author's intended meaning in the work as a whole. It is clear, then, as soon as one starts to talk about "intention," that various kinds of intention need to be distinguished, and many of the recent discussions of intention in literature do attempt to subdivide the concept. Thus T. M. Gang differentiates between "practical intention" (intention "to achieve a certain result") and "literary intention" (intention to convey "a certain significance"); John Kemp distinguishes between "immediate intention" (that which a man "intends, or sets himself, to do") and "ulterior intention" ("that which he intends or hopes to achieve as a result of doing what he does"); Morse Peckham discriminates between "mediated intention" ("a statement or other sign") and "immediate intention" ("metaphorical extension of mediated intention into the area of 'mind'"); and Quentin Skinner, borrowing terms from J. L. Austin's How to Do Things with Words (1962), 13 speaks of "illocutionary intention" (what a writer "may have been intending to do in writing what he wrote") and "perlocutionary intention" ("what he may have intended to do by writing in a certain way"), as well as of "intention to do x" (a writer's "plan or design to a create a certain type of work"). 14 Of such classifications of intention, one of the clearest and most useful has been set forth by Michael Hancher. 15 In his view, "author's intentions" can be divided into three types: (1) "programmatic intention"—"the author's intention to make something or other"; (2) "active intention"—"the author's intention to be (understood as) acting in some way or other"; and (3) "final intention"—"the author's intention to cause something or other to happen." The first refers to the author's general plan to write a sonnet, say, or a realistic novel; the third refers to his hope that his work will change the reader's viewpoint, say, or bring wealth to himself. The second is the one which concerns the meanings embodied in the work: "Active intentions characterize the actions that the author, at the time he finishes his text, understands himself to be performing in that text" (p. 830). 16 Hancher's argument is that the first and third kinds of intention—programmatic and final—are indeed irrelevant to the interpretation of a literary work but that the second—active intention—must be taken into account in the interpretation (and evaluation) of the work. Before pursuing the implications of that argument, we should pause long enough to note that what editors in the tradition of Greg are likely to call "final intention" does not correspond to what Hancher here calls "final intention." Rather, the intention with which editors are concerned is Hancher's "active intention," the intention that the work " mean (and be taken to mean) something or other" (p. 831). The fact that an editor, as briefly suggested above, must examine both the author's intention to use a particular word and the author's intention to mean a particular thing in the work as a whole—indeed, must make decisions about the first in the light of the second—is adequately accommodated in Hancher's concept of "active intention." Hancher's initial illustration of the concept includes comment on Hopkins's intention in using "buckle" in "The Windhover" as well as on his intention for the meaning of "the whole action of that poem." Because an intention regarding the meaning of a work as a whole may not always seem distinct from a programmatic intention, Hancher later recognizes that a programmatic intention may "involve a kind of active intention" (p. 836) but distinguishes between such " projected active intention" and the "active intention that ultimately defines the meaning of the completed text" (p. 837). Therefore "active intention," as he defines it, does cover the authorial intentions with which an editor has to deal. Accordingly, whenever I speak of "intention," unless otherwise specified, I am referring to the kind of intention included in Hancher's concept of "active intention"; even when I use the term "final intention," in conformity with the common practice of editors, the word "intention" still refers to the same concept (and not to what Hancher calls "final intention")—though just what "final" may mean in the phrase remains to be examined later. It can readily be inferred from what I have already said about Hancher's conclusion that he does not belong to that group of critics who believe in "semantic autonomy" (to use Hirsch's phrase)—the idea that a verbal construction carries its own inherent determinate meaning regardless of what meaning was intended by the author. As Beardsley puts the idea, "texts acquire determinate meaning through the interactions of their words without the intervention of an authorial will." 17 Hancher's argument for the relevance of active intention to literary interpretation shows that he defines "the" meaning of a work as the meaning intended by its author. 18 It is difficult to refute such an argument without taking the position that the language of a literary work operates in a different way from the language of ordinary discourse; yet that position cannot convincingly be taken so long as it is impossible to draw a distinct line between works which are literary and works which are not. 19 Language, after all, consists of symbols, which must be invested with meanings if they are to mean anything. At the same time, a reader does not have access to an author's mind, and, if he understands a text to mean something, it is (at least to begin with) as a result of certain conventions of language which both are following. 20 Yet texts (or utterances) do not have to be complex in order for the conventions involved to be capable of more than one interpretation. The possibility is raised, therefore, that the meaning or meanings a reader finds in a text do not correspond to the meaning or meanings which the author intended. 21 To reject "semantic autonomy" (or "immanent meaning") is not to deny that texts are capable of multiple interpretations. Indeed, the fact that multiple interpretations are possible is a refutation of the idea that a text embodies a determinate meaning. How, then, is the author's intended meaning to be discovered? In answering that question, one is inevitably drawn back to the work itself as the most reliable documentary evidence as to what the author intended. If he made no statement setting forth his intention, one has nowhere else to go for direct evidence (though of course one can take into account various historical and biographical circumstances); and if he did make a statement, it may, for a great variety of reasons, not be accurate. As Morse Peckham has pointed out, any attempt, by the author or someone else, to explain the intention of a work ("an utterance") constitutes an inference about an event which took place in the past; the author's account carries greater weight "only because he is likely to have more information for framing his historical construct, not because he generated the utterance." 22 Furthermore, as William H. Capitan has noted, "what an artist gives us as his intention is subject to the artist's limitations in putting his intention into words." 23 The position has been well stated by Quentin Skinner: To discount a writer's own statements is not to say that we have lost interest in gaining a correct statement about his intentions in our attempt to interpret his works. It is only to make the (perhaps rather dramatic, but certainly conceivable) claim that the writer himself may have been self-deceiving about recognizing his intentions, or incompetent at stating them. And this seems to be perennially possible in the case of any complex human action. 24 Hirsch, who does not recognize as "meanings" any meanings other than the author's, decides what Wordsworth "probably" meant in "A slumber did my spirit seal" by turning to "everything we know of Wordsworth's typical attitudes during the period in which he composed the poem" (p. 239). Contemporary statements about these attitudes may of course be useful, but are not Wordsworth's poems the chief source of information about his attitudes? And if a given body of writings can provide such evidence, is it not possible that a smaller body of writings—or even the single poem—could provide it? As Hirsch admits, "A poet's typical attitudes do not always apply to a particular poem" (p. 240); so one is inevitably thrown back on the poem itself. I do not think it necessary to review here the various arguments for or against "semantic autonomy" 25 in order to make my point: all I am suggesting is that a rejection of the notion of "semantic autonomy" is not incompatible with the position that the work itself provides the best evidence of the author's intended meaning. The bearing of these ideas on the task of the editor is worth making explicit. At the start, the editor has settled one important question through his definition of his goal: he is concerned with establishing the text as intended by the author, and thus he has no doubts about the relevance of the author's intention to his undertaking. But then he recognizes that the most reliable source of information about the author's intention in a given work is that work itself. He will take other information into account, but he must always measure it finally against the very text which is the subject of his inquiry. The editor may at first feel that his job is different from the critic's in that he is concerned with establishing intended wording , not with explicating intended meaning . That is, he may think (in Austin's terms) that he is dealing only with the author's locutionary act, not his illocutionary act. But he soon realizes that his discovery of textual errors or his choice among textual variants involves his understanding of the intended meaning of the text. For if either of two alternative words makes sense at a given point, the determination of which the author intended clearly involves more than his locutionary act. 26 Greg's rationale tells an editor what to do when he is at an impasse, but it does not eliminate the need for judgments; indeed, it relies on them. So the editor finds himself in the position of the critic after all. Merely because he has already decided that his concern is with the author's intention does not mean that the issue of "semantic autonomy" is irrelevant to him, for he, too, will be turning to the text itself as his primary evidence. The key to the use of the work as evidence of its author's intended meaning must lie in the approach which the critic (editor) takes. 27 One critic may believe that he has found through internal evidence the most satisfactory explication of a work and may not be interested in whether or not this meaning was intended by the author. 28 Another critic, who wishes to find the author's intended meaning, will read the work in the light of all the historical and biographical evidence he can locate and may thereby eliminate certain meanings as ones which the author could not have intended; 29 his interpretation of the text is thus limited by certain external information, but his positive evidence still comes from the text itself. If I hastily dash off a message for someone and the recipient finds it ambiguous, he will attempt to rule out certain meanings on the basis of what he knows of me and of the circumstances which occasioned the message; what he finally concludes to be my intended meaning, however, cannot be based merely on what the external evidence suggests I would be likely to say in that situation but must rest on the words I actually did use. Furthermore, if I mistakenly wrote one word while intending another, it may be that the external evidence would cast doubt on my use of that word, but any correction of the error would have to be justified by the context. The work itself is the controlling factor in statements made about its meaning, whether or not those statements aim at elucidating the author's intended meaning. The scholarly editor is in the same position as the critic who is concerned with the author's intended meaning. Regardless of how many meanings he finds in the text, the scholarly editor makes corrections or emendations on the basis of the one he judges most likely to have been the author's intended meaning. Hancher speaks of a science of interpretation, in which the critic's aim is to determine the "authorized" or intended meaning, and an art of interpretation, in which the critic's aim is to find the most satisfying meaning according to his own "norms of value." 30 Some critics would protest that all meanings are part of an intended complex combination of meanings, intended in the sense that the author, whether consciously or unconsciously, created a structure in which they could be discovered. But this appeal to "subconscious intention," as T. M. Gang has indicated, 31 implies a universal set of relationships between consciously produced patterns and their subconscious origins—relationships which, if they are always in operation, cannot be specifically intended and are always available for anyone to discern. One need not deny that such meanings can be found in the work and that they may be valuable (and offer revealing insights into the author's personality and motivation) in order to believe that "intention" cannot be a useful concept if it is made so broad as to cover all potentially discoverable meanings. It is certainly true that neither the author nor anyone else can construct an explanatory paraphrase which is the exact equivalent of the work itself; but it does not follow that the intended meanings of the work are inexhaustible. An editor could, of course, emend a text so that it would, in his view, be a more successful expression of that meaning which he finds most valuable in it; but his activity would have nothing to do with the author. In Hancher's terms, he would be engaging in the "art" of interpretation—or, rather, editing on the basis of that kind of interpretation. A scholarly editor sets as his goal the reconstruction of the text intended by the author. In Hancher's terms, he is engaging in the "science," not the art, of interpretation—but it is still interpretation and entails critical thinking. His defined approach is what controls the use he makes of what he finds in the work. He will probably find more than one meaning there, but his specialized knowledge places him in a privileged position for assessing which of them can most reasonably be regarded as the author's. 32 The text he produces can, like any other text, be the subject of critical speculation by those who have no interest in the author's intention; but it can also serve the needs of those critics who are concerned with the work as the product of a particular mind. That an interpretation by one of the former turns out to seem more satisfying to many readers than an interpretation by one of the latter has no bearing on the importance or desirability of the task which the scholarly editor has set himself. These considerations suggest, first of all, that editing is a critical activity and that the scholarly editor cannot avoid coming to terms with the critical problem of authorial intention. Second, there is a specific and clearly defined aspect of the broad concept of "intention" which is the appropriate concern of the scholarly editor—the intention of the author to have particular words and marks of punctuation constitute his text and the intention that such a text carry a particular meaning or meanings. Finally, the scholarly editor will amass all the evidence he can find bearing on each textual decision; but, whenever the factual evidence is less than incontrovertible, his judgment about each element will ultimately rest on his interpretation of the author's intended meaning as he discovers it in the whole of the text itself. What controls the editor's freedom of interpretation is his self-imposed limitation: he is concerned only with that intention which his knowledge of the author and the period allows him to attribute to the author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II An editor who has given some attention to such preliminary questions has at least begun to reach an understanding of "authorial intention." But there are a number of further questions which arise as he attempts to make judgments in the light of this conception of intention. Perhaps the most common editorial situation is that in which the editor must decide whether a given variant reading is a revision by the author or an alteration (conscious or inadvertent) by someone else. In these cases, at least one intermediate stage of documentary evidence is lacking, and the editor is trying to determine from the surviving material those changes which the author made in that now missing document. He must also face the question whether it is ever possible to think of changes not made by the author as nevertheless fulfilling, or contributing to, the author's intention. The basic situation can be illustrated by Sherwood Anderson's A Story Teller's Story (1924). The only surviving prepublication text of this work is the typescript printer's copy, which bears revisions by three people: Anderson himself, Paul Rosenfeld, and E. T. Booth, the publisher's editor. One has direct evidence, therefore, for assigning the responsibility for each of these alterations; but the first printing of the book (Huebsch, 1924) contains additional changes, not marked on the surviving typescript and presumably entered on the now lost proofs. Deciding which of these changes were made by Anderson is the central task in editing this book. 33 What the editor has to do is to familiarize himself with all the available relevant evidence—bibliographical, historical, biographical. He may then find that some of it is convincing enough to dictate certain decisions. For example, on (or just before) 28 October 1924 Anderson wrote to Rosenfeld explaining why he had cut out some material about Waldo Frank. 34 Since several paragraphs about Frank are present in the typescript but not present in the first impression, one can conclude that this is the deletion referred to and that it was made by Anderson on the proofs. But for most of the alterations in the first impression there is no such compelling evidence; most of the editor's decisions must finally be critical judgments, resulting from an evaluation of what evidence there is, from an understanding of Anderson's habits of revision, and from a familiarity with and sensitivity to his style and ideas. Even the deleted Waldo Frank passage leads the editor to a related judgment, for that deletion is only a part of a considerably longer deletion made in the first impression. Because the entire passage concerns Anderson's reactions to various writers, one may conclude that he probably eliminated all of it, and not merely the part about Frank which he happened to mention to Rosenfeld. But that conclusion is a judgment, supported by a critical argument, not by verifiable facts. The same observations can be made about situations involving variants between printed editions. In these cases the missing documents are the author's marked copy of the earlier edition (or its proofs, or whatever served as printer's copy for the edition set later) and the marked proofs of the later edition. If no document survives which antedates the proofs of the earliest setting of the text, then of course one is dealing with texts which have already been subjected to the routine of the printing- or publishing-house. Thus the essential difference between this situation and the one described above is that here the editor is working at a greater remove from the author's fair-copy manuscript or typescript; but his approach to the problem remains the same. For instance, neither the manuscript of The Rise of Silas Lapham nor the proofs set from it survive; and the history of the early printed texts, which vary from one another substantively at a number of points, is such that one text might contain the later readings in one part of the book and another the later readings in a different part. So for any given variant, the editor must first try to determine the order of the readings and then decide whether the later one could be an authorial revision or correction. At one point in Chapter 19 Irene's complexion is described as "snow-white" in the serialized magazine text and as "colourless" in the first book edition (set from proofs of the magazine text); since the publication schedule for the book made it highly unlikely that the book proofs of the last part (Chapters 19-27) were given a proofreading by anyone outside the printer's or publisher's offices and since there was an opportunity for second magazine proofs of this part to be gone over later, one can reasonably conclude (barring the unlikely possibility that "colourless" is simply a compositorial error or that the book publisher's editor engaged in this kind of revision) that the magazine reading "snow-white" is the later reading here. Deciding that it was in fact Howells's alteration is of course a matter of judgment, but a judgment made within the limits imposed by the factual evidence. 35 In the case of Moby-Dick , those limits are wider, because it is known that the publisher's reader for the English edition made numerous substantive alterations and that Melville also had the opportunity to make revisions for that edition; distinguishing the two categories can result only from critical judgments as to which kinds of changes are likely to have been made by a somewhat pedantic reader concerned with expurgation and which are more characteristic of Melville. 36 Fredson Bowers makes the same point in connection with Fielding's Miscellanies , where some parts of the first edition were set from marked copies (not extant) of printed periodical texts: "This is a critical process almost exclusively, with only occasional bibliographical guidance, in which the editor shoulders his proper responsibility to separate the author's intended alterations from the verbal corruption that inevitably accompanies the transmission of a text." 37 Sometimes a statistical analysis of internal evidence can be of material assistance in making a critical choice among variants: tabulating the pattern of recurrences of unusual spellings and other features in Shakespearean texts can help to determine which characteristics of those texts derive from the compositors' preferences and which from the printer's copy itself; 38 or examining each variant in the syndicated appearances of Stephen Crane's stories and dispatches in the light of the quantitative evidence (how many times each reading turns up) can help to establish the reading of the syndicate's master proof. Such evidence must then be subjected to critical scrutiny: the fact that only one out of six newspaper texts of Crane's "The Pace of Youth" reads "clinched" at a point where all the others read "clenched" does not in itself dictate "clenched" as the authorial reading, for Crane invariably wrote "clinched." 39 Once the editor has made his judgments as to which variants are attributable to the author and which to someone else, he must consider the exact status of the latter group. Are all variants for which someone other than the author is responsible to be rejected outright, or is it conceivable that the author's intention may sometimes be fulfilled by other persons? It is not only conceivable but unquestionably true that others can and do sometimes correct an author's writing and in the process fulfill his intention. An author may write down one word but be thinking of a different one, or in reading proofs he may fail to notice a printer's error which creates a new word. When these erroneous words are plausible in their contexts, they may never be recognized by anyone as erroneous; but when one of them does not make sense, and when the correct word is obvious, anyone who makes the correction is carrying out the author's intention. Frequently an editor may believe that a particular word cannot have been intended but is not certain just what the intended word should be; only his critical assessment of the whole matter can determine whether it is preferable in that case to let the questionable word stand and call attention to the problem in a note or to substitute a word which catches the apparent intended sense (again, of course, with an explanation), even though that word may not be the exact one which the author had in mind. In the typescript of A Story Teller's Story , then, alterations in the hand of E. T. Booth cannot simply be dismissed; they must be inspected carefully, because Booth may have noticed places where the typescript reading certainly (or almost certainly) cannot have been Anderson's intended reading, and there is always the chance that an editor might otherwise fail to detect some of them. An examination of Booth's revisions, however, leads to a more difficult question. Since Booth was the editor for the publisher, can one argue that, because Anderson expected his book to be gone over in the publisher's offices, the changes made by Booth become a part of Anderson's intended wording? Or, to put the question in more general terms: can one argue that changes made (or thought to have been made) by the publisher and passed (or presumably passed) by the author in proof constitute changes intended by the author? This question is very different from asking about an editor's alteration of obvious errors. The correction of a reading which the author cannot have intended amounts to a restoration of what was in his mind but not on paper, or of what was in his now lost manuscript but not in print. It does not involve any change of the author's intention. But revisions, as opposed to corrections of outright errors, were not previously intended by the author; if the author then explicity endorses them, he is changing his intention. He is free to do so, of course, just as he may have shifted his intention several times before his manuscript ever left his hands. What is at issue, however, is whether he can delegate someone else to carry out his intention, or part of it. If he says that he expects changes, or certain kinds of changes, to be made in the publisher's offices, can the results be regarded as representing his intention, without shifting the definition of "intention"? One might argue, for instance, that Anderson—aware of some of the shortcomings, by conventional standards, of his spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure—did not "intend" for his writings to be published exactly as he wrote them but "intended" for them to be made to conform with conventional practice. But one might also argue, on the other side, that Anderson's writing as it came from him reflects his intention more accurately than it does after being standardized, and that any intention he may have held regarding publisher's alterations amounted only to his realistic understanding of what had to be done in order to get published (and thus was not part of his active intention in the text). 40 The importance, for editorial practice, of settling this question in general terms is evident. When an editor faces a choice for copy-text between a fair-copy manuscript (or printer's copy) and a first impression, he needs to have—in the absence of convincing evidence—a general policy to fall back on, a policy based on the inherent probabilities in such situations. Of course, if the editor has convincing evidence— not merely the author's statements but detailed information about the author's methods of going over proofs—he can make his decision on that basis. But, as is more likely to be the case, if the evidence is not sufficient for making a competent decision, the editor must have further guidance. Greg's rationale, pointing out the usual deterioration of a text (particularly its accidentals) from one manuscript or edition to another, leads the editor back to the fair-copy manuscript or the earliest extant text which follows it. There has been some disagreement with this position, however, based on the view that the author's intention encompasses the activities which take place in the step from manuscript (or typescript) to print and that the intention is not "final" until the text conforms to the standards which will make it publishable. Philip Gaskell concludes that "in most cases the editor will choose as copy-text an early printed edition, not the manuscript"; the accidentals of the manuscript, he says, "the author would himself have been prepared—or might have preferred—to discard." 41 James Thorpe agrees: In many cases, probably in most cases, he [the author] expected the printer to perfect his accidentals; and thus the changes introduced by the printer can be properly thought of as fulfilling the writer's intentions. To return to the accidentals of the author's manuscript would, in these cases, be a puristic recovery of a text which the author himself thought of as incomplete or unperfected: thus, following his own manuscript would result in subverting his intentions. 42 In support of his view, Thorpe offers examples of a number of writers over the years who have expressed their indifference to matters of spelling and punctuation or have asked for help in making their spelling and punctuation conform to an acceptable standard. Such arguments for preferring the first edition to the manuscript seem to me misguided. While it is true that most authors have the intention of getting published, such an intention is of a different order from their intention to have certain words and punctuation, resulting in a certain meaning, in their text. The intention of writing something publishable is what Hancher would call a "programmatic intention"; what the editor is properly concerned with, as we have seen, is the author's "active intention" manifested in the work. There is no reason why in some instances an author's active intention might not conflict with his programmatic intention. That an author may submit to various publishing-house alterations as a routine procedure in the process of publication does not amount to his changing his active intention about what his writing is to consist of. To say that he "expects" or is prepared to have certain changes made by the printer or publisher is not the same as to say that he prefers or wishes to have them made; to take his implicit approval of these changes on the proofs (or the printer's copy) as a sign that he is now more satisfied with his text is to ignore the many external factors (Melville's "Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience") which at this stage might prevent him from restoring readings that he actively desired. It is of little help to survey what writers in the past have said on the subject of publishers' alterations of their spelling and punctuation, even if there were a valid statistical basis for concluding, as Thorpe does, that most are "of the indifferent persuasion" (p. 151). Indifference is far from suggesting intention; and the motivation for the indifference would in each case have to be examined in order to know how to interpret the statements. But if the attitudes of writers toward this question cannot be fairly generalized about, the views and practices of printers and publishers can. Printers' manuals, after all, are normative and instructional statements, offering a far more trustworthy basis for generalization than individual authors' expressions of their own attitudes. Thorpe himself, after quoting from various manuals, recognizes that, for most of the period with which he is concerned, "it has been the printers (particularly the compositors and proofreaders) who have mainly exercised this control over the text in the process of transmitting it" (p. 152). And Gaskell admits that "printers seldom gave authors much choice in the matter" (p. 339). If printers and publishers can be assumed as a general rule to have made alterations in the accidentals of the texts which passed through their hands, and if the attitudes of authors toward those changes have been complex and uncertain, it would seem that, in the absence of additional evidence, an author's manuscript could be taken as a safer guide than the printed text to his intentions regarding accidentals. 43 Whether there is sufficient evidence in a given case to justify taking the first edition rather than the manuscript as copy-text is a matter of judgment. What the editor must attempt to assess is whether the author genuinely preferred the changes made by the publisher's reader or whether he merely acquiesced in them. The idea that an author can actively intend in his work a revision made by someone else depends in effect on the extent to which the two can be regarded as voluntary collaborators. Since collaboration implies shared responsibility, the "author's intention" in a collaborative effort results from a merging of the separate intentions of the individual authors; the final result is thus intended by each of the authors. A work need not be signed with more than one name, of course, for it to be a collaboration. Nor is it necessary for the authors involved to perform equal shares of the work; indeed, two people may collaborate only on certain aspects of a work, and their joint intention would apply only to the words or elements involved. The facsimile edition of the revised manuscript-typescript of The Waste Land offers a rare opportunity to observe some of the collaboration which can underlie a great work. In certain passages Pound's revisions (such as "demobbed" in line 139) or deletions (as in "Death by Water") actually constitute collaboration, though there are other places where Eliot rejects Pound's suggestions (as in the lines on Saint Mary Woolnoth, lines 67-68). That the work is to some extent collaborative is implied by Valerie Eliot's comment, in her description of "Editorial Policy," that "It has been difficult to decide who cancelled certain lines, especially when both Eliot and Pound have worked on them together." 44 A study of this facsimile does not suggest that an editor should incorporate into the text of the poem the lines which Pound rejected and Eliot did not restore; one can argue that at those points Eliot's intention merged with Pound's intention, even though Pound's markings are what survive on paper. The fact that Pound went over the poem as a friend and not as a publisher's editor does not alter the essential point: in either case it is possible for someone other than the "author" to make alterations which are identical with the intention of the "author," when the relationship partakes of the spirit of collaboration. The question, posed earlier, of whether it makes sense to believe that an author can ask someone else to carry out his intention in some respect may now be answered in the negative. By definition, an author's active intention cannot include projected activity and cannot include activity of which he is not in control. The ultimate example of delegated intention in writing would be for a person to ask someone else to write an entire work for him; if he then announced that it represented his "intention," he could only mean his intention to write a certain kind of work (his programmatic intention), for his active intention would not be involved. The same is true regardless of what portion or aspect of a work is at issue, as long as the element contributed by someone other than the author must be described with such expressions as "It is what the author expected to have done" or "It is what the author would have done if he had found time." However, if an author accepts what someone else has done not in a spirit of acquiescence but of active collaboration, the result does represent his active intention. Since the scholarly editor, in establishing a text, is concerned with an author's active intention in that text, he can accept into the text what he knows (or strongly believes) to be initially the work of someone else only when it can be regarded as having been accepted by the primary author as a true collaboration. This approach does not alter the crucial role which the editor's judgment plays in evaluating evidence, but it may provide a useful framework into which that evidence can be placed. It also suggests the relative infrequency with which publishers' alterations can be taken to supersede an author's known practice in a prepublication stage of his work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III After the editor has separated authorial from nonauthorial alterations and has decided how to treat the nonauthorial ones, he still faces the question of how to define "final" with respect to the authorial variants. Normally, of course, when there are two authorial readings at a given point and their sequence can be determined, the later one is taken to represent the author's "final intention." However, there are in general two kinds of situations in which this view of "final intention" will prove unsatisfactory: (1) when the nature or extent of the revisions is such that the result seems, in effect, a new work, rather than a "final version" of an old work; 45 and (2) when the author allows several alternative readings to stand in his manuscript or vacillates among them in successive editions. In the first case, one may say that there is more than one "final" intention; in the second, that there is no final intention at all. The editorial problem in both cases usually reduces itself to quantitative terms: when the authorial variants are few in number, it makes little practical difference if an editor selects one group of readings as "final" and incorporates them into his text, since the reader will be able without much difficulty to analyze the variants for himself and come to his own conclusions about the way in which these variants alter the total effect of the work; but when the number of variants is great, the system of presenting one final text with variant readings in notes is less satisfactory, and the only practical solution is to produce more than one text (perhaps arranged in parallel columns), each representing a different "intention." 46 That the recognition of more than one valid text of a given work is often forced on an editor by the practical exigencies of recording variant readings should not obscure the fact that the theoretical problem of determining "final" authorial intention has no necessary connection with the quantity of variants. Turning to the first of the two categories—in which an author's revisions produce, in a manner of speaking, a new work—one can identify several patterns. The most clear-cut involves those situations in which the author's revisions reflect motives which make it impossible for an editor to accept the later version of a work as truly representing the author's intention, even though, in temporal terms, this version is "final." If, for instance, an author deletes passages for the purpose of producing a condensation or simplifies the language to make the work appropriate for younger readers, the special motives in each case prevent the resulting revisions from being definitive. The revised version, in such cases, does not represent a refinement of the work as previously "completed" but a new work conceived for different purposes; if the new version has merit, it is as an independent work to be edited separately. This is not to deny that the author might make in the process some revisions which an editor would adopt as emendations in his copy-text, but in order to qualify for adoption they would have to be revisions unconnected with the aim of condensation or simplification. 47 In other words, two types of revision must be distinguished: that which aims at altering the purpose, direction, or character of a work, thus attempting to make a different sort of work out of it; and that which aims at intensifying, refining, or improving the work as then conceived (whether or not it succeeds in doing so), thus altering the work in degree but not in kind. If one may think of a work in terms of a spatial metaphor, the first might be labeled "vertical revision," because it moves the work to a different plane, and the second "horizontal revision," because it involves alterations within the same plane. Both produce local changes in active intention; but revisions of the first type appear to be in fulfillment of an altered programmatic intention or to reflect an altered active intention in the work as a whole, whereas those of the second do not. A similar situation occurs when an author makes revisions, not because he wishes to, but because he is asked or compelled to. Herman Melville, after the publication of Typee (1846), was asked by his American publisher, Wiley &amp; Putnam, to soften his criticism of the missionaries in the South Seas for a revised edition, and in July 1846 he complied by deleting about thirty-six pages of material and revising other passages. These changes alter the tone of the book and are not in keeping with the spirit of the original version. There is no question that Melville is responsible for the changes, and in this sense they are "final"; but they represent not so much his intention as his acquiescence. Under these circumstances, an editor is justified in rejecting the revisions and adopting the original readings as best reflecting the author's "final intention"; in fact, to accept the readings which are final in chronological terms would distort that intention. But again the two types of revision must be separated, for Melville made some revisions in July 1846 which had no connection with the expurgation of political, religious, and sexual references—and these an editor would adopt. 48 In other words, the "vertical" revisions are rejected, and the "horizontal" revisions are accepted. 49 Just as accidental and substantive variants are, in Greg's rationale, to be treated separately, so, too, known authorial revisions must be divided into categories for editorial decision according to the motives or conceptions they reflect. A further related problem—the weight to be attached to an author's statement about his revisions—can also be illustrated by the Typee case. After removing the passages on the missionaries from the American edition, Melville wrote to John Murray, his English publisher, "Such passages are altogether foreign to the adventure, &amp; altho' they may possess a temporary interest now , to some, yet so far as the wide &amp; permanent popularity of the work is conserned [ sic ], their exclusion will certainly be beneficial." One could argue that Melville is simply making the best of the situation, that he is rationalizing the changes and trying to convince himself that they are for the better; on the other side, one could say that here is a strong statement from the author about his "intention" and that the author's wishes, so stated, must be respected. However, in the same way that an author may make revisions which do not reflect his ultimate wishes about his work, he may also make statements which, for various reasons, are less than completely candid. In the end, one cannot automatically accept such statements at face value; as in any historical research, statements can only be interpreted by placing them in their context, by reconstructing as fully as possible the course of events which led up to them. The publisher, in the case of Typee , and not the author, initiated the revisions, and there is no evidence, internal or external, to suggest that they are the kinds of changes Melville would have made without pressure from someone else; even his statement implies that the revised work is in a sense a different work, stemming from a different set of programmatic intentions—aimed at producing a permanently popular work, not dated by discussions of current issues. After these considerations, an editor need not feel that Melville's statement makes the case for rejecting the expurgations any less strong. 50 Such statements by authors should always be carefully evaluated, like any other evidence, but they cannot be binding on an editor. Only the circumstances of each case can dictate the weight to be accorded to these statements, just as the author's actual revisions cannot be indiscriminately adopted without reference to the entire historical situation surrounding them. This treatment of author's statements has certain further implications. The essential issue, stated baldly, is whether an editor can presume to reverse an author's decision. Even if Melville did not want to revise Typee , the fact remains that he did so and even asserted decisively that the result was an improvement. Is it not the author's prerogative to determine the ultimate form of his work? Suppose that Melville meant what he said and that, even though he would not have made the revisions without external influence, he was sincerely convinced that he had done the right thing. Most editors would disagree with him, but they would also say that it is not an editor's place to determine what the author should have done. If the author has a lapse in taste, the argument goes, that lapse is a historical fact which scholarly research cannot undertake to repair. There is no answer to this argument, of course, so long as the revision was definitely an attempt to improve the work in terms of its original conception (horizontal revision). But when the revision shifts that conception and thereby produces a different work (vertical revision), the editor may only confuse matters by presenting the revised version as the basic text: if he finds the original version a more faithful representation of the author's vision, he is not abdicating his scholarly responsibility in favor of an undisciplined subjectivity if he edits that version on its own terms as a separate work (and goes on to include the variant readings of the revised edition in notes). It is one thing for an editor to impose his taste upon an author's work by choosing among variant readings solely on the basis of their appeal to him; it is quite another for him to put that taste to the service of historical understanding by allowing it to guide him in distinguishing among the levels of authorial revision and discriminating among the various artistic conceptions they represent. The most familiar situation in which more than one "final" intention can be said to exist occurs when an author, at a later stage in his career, extensively revises a work completed years before—not because he is compelled to, nor because he wants to condense it, expand it, or adjust it to a different audience, but because he feels he can improve it artistically. The classic case of such revision is the New York Edition (1907-09) of Henry James. It seems to be generally agreed that an attempt to record in textual notes the variant readings between the original and revised versions of the novels and stories included in that edition would be of questionable utility, since the revisions are so pervasive that they create substantially new works. Both versions of a given work deserve to be read in their own right, and an essay generalizing upon and categorizing the differences between them may be more useful than a list of variants appended to one of the texts. Many essays of this kind have appeared, and a fairly recent one, on "Pandora," sums up the situation: "the net result is neither striking improvement nor fatal tampering. The story is better in some ways, worse in others. But it is different—one cannot assert that the changes really add up to nothing." 51 The revised version, because it is essentially "different," manifests a "final intention" which does not supersede the "final intention" of the earlier version. Merely because the revision came at the end of a long career, when James's artistry and insight were presumably more mature, it cannot invalidate the intrinsic merits of the original version. The two are discrete works. If this point of view has been readily accepted in extreme cases of revision, it has scarcely been considered at all in instances of slight revision. But why should the quantity of alterations affect one's theoretical position? If one treats a heavily revised text as an independent work simply because the difficulties of handling the variants in any other way are overwhelming and then edits a less heavily revised work as a single text with notes because it is possible to do so, the theoretical basis of the whole operation is questionable. The idea that a revised version can be considered a separate work is sometimes said to rest on the concept of organic form—the view that form and content in a work of art are so integrated that any alteration produces a new entity. Of course, it is not necessary to adduce this concept in order to make the point: changing a word in any utterance results technically in a different utterance. Although the change of one word in a novel makes less practical difference than the change of one word in a brief lyric poem, strictly speaking each version (both of the novel and of the poem) is a "separate work." Maintaining this position would not quite put an end to all scholarly editing, because editors would still have the task of detecting nonauthorial readings (emendations of publishers' readers, compositors' errors, and the like) and purifying the text of them; 52 but they could not choose among authorial variants, for they would have to consider each group of them, for each successive impression or edition, as resulting in a new work to be edited separately. 53 Clearly such a situation would be intolerable from a practical point of view; in the majority of instances editorial choice among authorial variants does not deprive readers of the opportunity for reconstructing other forms of the text on the basis of the material presented in the apparatus, and a list of variants has the positive advantage of drawing together the evidence from various versions into a form where it is conveniently comparable. If, in practice, editors are not going to regard each version as necessarily a separate work, then some rationale is required for distinguishing those instances of revision which are to be edited as separate works from those which are not. A quantitative dividing line is not logical: it would be impossible to set up a particular number of revisions, or words involved in revisions, as the test for defining a separate work in this sense. 54 What is more meaningful than the extent of the revisions is their nature. One author might make 3000 changes in his selection of adjectives and adverbs, for instance—and perhaps improve his book stylistically—without altering his original conception of the work at all; another might make only ten revisions in key passages and change the whole direction of the book. Whether or not two versions of a book are treated by an editor as independent works should depend on a qualitative, not quantitative, distinction. If revisions do not spring from the same conception of an organic whole as the original version manifested (what I have called vertical revisions), then they produce a new work, even though the actual number of new readings is small; if revisions are attempts to develop and improve the original conception (what I have called horizontal revisions), then they do not produce a separate work for practical purposes, regardless of the number of changes involved. 55 Generally, large numbers of alterations do follow from a changed conception or programmatic intention, but the point is that there is no necessary connection between the two. In making decisions about authorial intention, an editor may be inclined to take into account a related factor, the timing of the changes. When an author, late in his life, makes revisions in an early work, one could argue that the result will almost surely constitute an effectively different work, since it is unlikely that the author will have the same conception of his work in mind as he had during the process of its original composition. James's revisions are a case in point, but the argument can be applied to other instances in which neither the extent of the changes nor the shift in intent is so pronounced. When Arthur Stedman edited Typee in 1892, he claimed to have made alterations "by written direction of the author" (who died in 1891). The only presently known evidence of any authorial direction is a note in Mrs. Melville's hand listing four changes which her husband requested. 56 Even assuming that this note accurately represents Melville's final wishes, how much weight is to be given to a few isolated changes suggested nearly fifty years after the original composition of the work? Two of the changes represent the same kind of expurgation which Melville was required to make for the earlier revised edition and are not consistent with the spirit of the work. These revisions are different from James's not merely in quantity but in the fact that they are not part of a sustained and coherent reshaping of an early work. Instead, they are simply instances of sporadic tinkering; such tinkering, when performed during or soon after the composition of a work, can be expected to fit the general tone and spirit of the whole, but when it occurs much later the results may well seem out of place. A systematic job of revision, even if it does not result in many changes, may have a coherence of its own, but isolated changes frequently clash with the larger context. Nevertheless, it is obviously possible for authors to make consistent sporadic revisions late in life, and the timing of revisions is therefore not in itself the key. Just as a quantitative measure of revision will not serve to distinguish what versions are to be edited as separate works, so a time limit is similarly unrealistic: one cannot say that all revisions made within a week, or a month, or a year of the original composition are to be accepted as part of the same conception, while those made after that time either result in different works or represent random thoughts not consistent with any coherent plan. What is important, once again, is the nature of the changes, and no mechanical rule—about their extent or their timing—can produce meaningful distinctions among them with respect to underlying conceptions or motives. The role which these considerations play in editing and the critical nature of the decisions they imply are well illustrated in Bowers's edition of Stephen Crane's Maggie . 57 Crane's book was first printed privately in 1893; three years later, in order to secure publication by D. Appleton &amp; Co., he agreed to make revisions, particularly the elimination of profanity. But, as Bowers points out, Crane's alterations were not limited to bowdlerizing: "It is clear from many examples that he took the opportunity to make stylistic revisions as well as literary improvements" (p. lxviii). As in the case of Typee , an editor will reject the enforced expurgations and will accept the stylistic revisions made at the same time. But Maggie offers in addition a difficult intermediate category: the removal of various sordid details, culminating in the cancellation of a 96-word paragraph describing a "huge fat man," which had appeared in the 1893 edition at a strategic point, just before Maggie's death at the end of Chapter 17. The first critical question is obviously to decide whether these alterations were among those which Crane made under duress or whether he made them independently, judging them to be artistic improvements. Answering that question, as Bowers recognizes, involves literary judgment, and he provides a long interpretive discussion (pp. lxxvii-xci) of the implications of the removal of that paragraph, concluding with the view that Crane did delete it for artistic reasons. Once that decision is made, there is a second critical question to be faced: does this revision (and the scattered lesser ones similar to it) produce an essentially different work? Bowers clearly states the possibility: In some literary works it is generally recognized that a revision may be so thoroughgoing—so motivated throughout by the author's altered political, social, or artistic concepts—as to require complete acceptance on its own terms as the final intention in every respect both of accidentals and of substantives. . . . Under such conditions there is nothing for it but to treat the early and late texts as quite independent units and to establish each separately, perhaps in parallel form, with no attempt to merge the two in terms of the divided authority of accidentals and substantives. Divided authority does not exist and no synthetic text is possible for the early and revised editions of such works as Jonson's Every Man in His Humour , Wordsworth's Prelude , or Whitman's Leaves of Grass . (pp. xciii-xciv) He then concludes that " Maggie does not bear comparison with these examples," arguing that Crane "was operating from a strong literary conviction about the integrity of a text once written and published" (p. xcv). It is possible, then, by incorporating the 1896 revisions which Crane "made for his own purposes and satisfaction" (p. xcvii), to produce a single "'ideal' text of Maggie as a literary fact, not a limited 'ideal' text either of the 1893 or of the 1896 edition" (p. xcv). Obviously this conclusion is reached through critical analysis, and another editor might analyze the situation differently and come to the opposing view—that there are two distinct Maggies which it would be improper to merge. 58 No incontrovertible answer is to be expected to a question like this, dependent on judgment; but every editor in his own work must recognize that the question exists and reach an answer to it. 59 With some authors the possibility of multiple "final" intentions is further intensified. Instead of making one systematic revision of a work at some point later in life, they revise their work continually throughout their careers. An extreme example of this method, referred to by Bowers in the passage quoted above, is Whitman's Leaves of Grass , which was extensively revised eight times between 1855 and 1892. When an author works in this way, successive editions constitute a printed record of a developing mind. The fact that Whitman said of his final "deathbed" edition (1891-92) that any future edition should be "a copy and facsimile, indeed, of the text of these . . . pages" does not mean that critics and scholars must reject all earlier editions as works in their own right. 60 Even if Whitman came to think of the earlier editions as preliminary drafts for his final version, each of those editions was published and at the time of its publication represented a final version that he was willing to present to the public and thus his final intention as of that moment. 61 If one decides that the revisions at each stage are the kind which spring from an altered conception of the whole, one can argue that each edition of Leaves is a separate work with its own final intention. (The situation would differ from that of Henry James only in the greater number of separate works, resulting from the greater number of stages of revision.) In that case, Whitman's last text is not—as an intended work—any more "final" than his earlier texts; it merely comes later. To one taking this position, Whitman's own judgment should of course be no embarrassment; it is only a critical pronouncement about his work, not an element within the work. These issues are raised in an acute form in connection with the poetry of W. H. Auden. Joseph Warren Beach, in The Making of the Auden Canon (1957), describes in great detail the way in which Auden continually omitted or revised passages to bring his poems into conformity with his current ideological preoccupations. In 1945, for example, he gave the poems from "In Time of War," in Beach's words, "a more distinctively religious cast than they had when first written in 1938 and published in 1939" (p. 10). Throughout his career, according to Beach, Auden displayed a faculty for "domesticating, within the frame of mind that at any moment possesses him, work conceived in some quite different frame of mind" (p. 15). In preparing a collected edition, he not only revised poems to make them "reasonably acceptable to him at a time when he was concerned that his work should be as edifying spiritually as it was imaginatively arresting" (p. 242); he also arranged the poems in alphabetical order so that their connections with previous volumes or particular stages in his career would be obscured. The situation is reminiscent of Whitman's preparation of an authorized final edition, but in Auden's case the emphasis is more clearly on ideological content than on artistic form. As with Whitman, Auden's final text can be regarded as only another text, reflecting a different conception of his work. Beach's analysis presents, in effect, the apparatus for a critical edition in essay form—a method which, for this kind of author, is perhaps more useful than a list of variant readings, since such a list tends to suggest that the versions compared are essentially the same work. At the end of his book Beach takes up—in one of the few discussions of the subject in print—some of the editorial implications of multiple authorial intention. One can concur with his feeling of dissatisfaction about Auden's collected text and yet find a curious logic in his conclusion: [Auden's] alternative would have been to range his poems in chronological order and leave them, as far as was consistent with his artistic standards, just as they were originally written. We should then be able to read them in their original context and to follow the course of an interesting mind in its progress through successive periods in the pursuit of truth. This manner of presentation would have done better justice to many fine poems as intelligible and organic creations of poetic art. It would have involved the candid admission on the author's part that, by his present lights, he had occasionally been subject to error and confusion. But such candor would only have reflected credit on the poet, and it could not in the end have been a disservice to the truth as he later came to see it. (p. 243) In these comments Beach is explaining what he wishes Auden had done but in the process confuses the roles of author and scholarly editor. The particular revision and arrangement which Auden decided upon for his collected poems represent, in themselves, one of the "successive periods" in the "course of an interesting mind." The fact that he did not arrange his poems in chronological order or leave them unaltered does not prevent the editor from making the earlier texts available. Many of Auden's decisions may not please an editor, but, whatever they are, they constitute the only material the editor has to work with. One can criticize an author's lapses, but one cannot expect him to treat his own work as if he were a scholarly editor. Pursuing the nature of Auden's "identity," Beach sensibly asks, "And how . . . can we question the right of an author to be his own judge as to the intent of a piece of writing, or to make it over so as to give it a new direction?" (p. 251). This, after all, is the central issue. But the answer again proves troublesome: "What I have suggested is that such a making over of a work of literary art is not to be accomplished by cutting out a few offensive passages, or by merely hanging the work in a different gallery in different company; and that it is vain to suppose that now it means something essentially different from what it did." In other words, as he goes on to say, a work of art should have "a wholeness, or integrality, that underlies all the diverse and even conflicting elements" (p. 253). It is precisely because of its "integrality," however, that any adjustments made in a work of art may turn it into a different, if no less integral, work. To say that an author's last version of a work means the same thing as his earliest is to abandon all criticism; but to find that a late version fails to supersede an early one is not to deny the author's right to do with his work as he pleases. In the end, whenever there are authorial revisions, an editor is not fulfilling his responsibility to the work of literature if he does not assess the nature of those revisions, in order to determine whether he is really dealing with only a single work. Before glancing at the argument that this approach to editing gives the editor too much freedom to be eclectic, let us turn to the second major category in which "final intention" is problematical—those instances in which there is literally no final intention, either because the author never prepared his manuscript for publication or because he wavered in his revisions for successive printings. 62 Perhaps the most common instances of this situation occur in the editing of letters. Although letters, generally full of abbreviations and elliptical remarks, can be described as manuscripts not prepared for publication, they have one peculiar feature: they were not (in most cases) intended for publication. Whatever form the manuscript is in, therefore, if the letter was sent, represents "final intention"; the posting of a letter is equivalent to the publication of a literary work, for each activity serves as the means by which a particular kind of communication is directed to its audience. When letters are published, do they automatically become a different genre, subject to different conventions, or is their intention distorted if they are not reproduced exactly as they arrived in the recipient's hands? If the author prepares his own letters for publication, he will almost certainly alter them (at least with respect to accidentals, but possibly also to substantives), and he will probably expect them to be subjected to the same processes of copy-editing and house-styling as any other work. But when letters are published posthumously, does the fact that the author would have expected them to be adjusted to conform with the conventions of published writing justify an editor's attempt to perform those adjustments? Clearly it does not, because, as we have seen, what an author expects is different from what he actively intends. In any case, an editor cannot possibly put himself in the frame of mind of a publisher's house-stylist of some previous period, and the changes he would introduce, however knowledgeable he may be, could carry no authority. Additionally, the abbreviations and other unconventional features of a letter may be its most revealing characteristics; if they are removed or normalized, the substance of the letter and the nuances conveyed to the recipient may be obscured, if not substantially altered. Naturally, some adjustments are inevitable, since complete fidelity to the original would mean photographic reproduction on the same quality of paper. But alterations—even in such matters as the misspelling of words—should be made with extreme caution if the effect of a letter as a private document is to be retained. This procedure comes closer to the author's intention, as revealed in the finished text of each letter, than following any directions the author may have pronounced when he was thinking of his letters more as literary property than as private expression. 63 A similar situation exists in connection with journals, notebooks, and other personal papers, except that for these classes of material there is not even that degree of finality accorded to letters by the act of posting. If the writer made no final selection among alternative words or phrases, an editor has no basis—nor justification—for doing so; to prepare a "clear text" which reads smoothly is to change the essential nature of the document. Such works, though they may turn out to be literature, form a special genre in which the necessity for final choice (forced upon an author in the case of published works by the act of publication) does not apply. From a practical point of view, some of these works gain little from the preservation of their formal texture, and it may be that the group of readers who will be turning to a particular document may find the loss of such fidelity a price worth paying for a conveniently readable text. The nature of the document and the uses to which it may be put will in each instance determine the degree of compromise which can be tolerated. In some cases a full transcription may be accompanied by a separate "reading text." 64 But the theoretical point remains: altering private papers to conform to conventional standards of publication makes different works of them and thus is bound to distort their meaning. When writers leave unfinished, or unprepared for publication, literary works of other genres—those which are normally circulated in published form—the problem is somewhat different. In these cases the rejected readings, false starts, and uncanceled variants are of interest in showing the writer's manner of working and stylistic development, just as they are when found in the surviving manuscripts of a published work; but they do not reflect the essential nature of the work itself, as they do in a letter or a journal. An editor who completes the author's job by preparing such works for conventional publication (correcting errors, choosing among uncanceled variants, and the like) is not obscuring the final effect or meaning of the work but rather clarifying it. When a poem, left in manuscript, is posthumously published in the form of an exact transcript, it is being treated like a historical document; when it is published in a clear reading text, it is being treated like a work of literary art. Both forms may have their uses, but only the second can represent (or attempt to represent) the author's intention. 65 The poems of Emily Dickinson present a special situation: they are clearly poems (not journal entries or letters), but they were not intended for publication. They contain both eccentric punctuation (often impossible to reproduce in type) and uncanceled alternative readings. If an editor decides to publish as exact transcriptions as possible of these poems (or even photographs of the manuscripts), he is doing what normally is most sensible for works not intended for publication. But in this case he would be doing less than full justice to the material, which belongs to a genre conventionally circulated in some kind of published form and with decisions among alternative readings already made. The fact that Emily Dickinson did not "intend" publication does not alter the basic nature of the material and automatically convert into notebook jottings what would have been called poetry if published. Her distrust of publication does not obligate an editor to leave her poems unpublished (or to edit them as if they were private papers) any more than an author's "deathbed" edition obligates an editor to regard previous editions as superseded. In either case the work has an existence distinct from the wishes (expressed or implied) of its creator, and "intention" regarding publication is different from the active intention embodied in the work. Whether or not Emily Dickinson's manuscripts were specifically "intended" for publication is really beside the point; the important matter is that they are manuscripts of poems not prepared for publication. Although an editor will rightly feel an obligation to present as fully as possible the evidence available in those manuscripts (as documents in the history of American literature), he should feel equally obliged to make decisions among the author's alternative readings and produce a clear text of the poems (as literature). 66 An editor who thus "completes" unfinished poems is not being presumptuous but is simply facing his responsibility. One editor's choice among alternatives may of course differ from another's, but the excellence of any critical edition—whether based on unprepared manuscripts or not—is directly related to the critical powers of its editor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Some of the implications of the Dickinson problem for editorial theory are discussed by R. W. Franklin at the end of his important book The Editing of Emily Dickinson : A Reconsideration (1967). Franklin correctly asserts that "from the variant fair copies of a single poem we should choose its best" (p. 133), and he objects to any nonliterary or mechanical basis of selection among alternatives in unfinished manuscripts as resulting merely in "a worksheet without all the work" (p. 134). Since an uncompleted manuscript obviously lacks finality, he concludes, "The principle of editing that a text exactly represent the author's intention is inadequate." He therefore calls for "a new editorial procedure for material unprepared by the author for publication"—a procedure which would be "a compromise between the demands of authorial intention and the demands of the poems" (pp. 142-143). One might carry the argument a step further, however, and note that since authorial intention is ultimately ascertainable only through the poems, no compromise is necessary except in the sense that two kinds of edition, rather than a single one, may be desirable: a complete transcription, faithful to the demands of the document, and a reading text (or more than one), faithful to the demands of the work of art. Generalizing upon the specific situation, Franklin points to the "conflicting bases of criticism and editing"—conflicting because the modern critical position upholds "criticism divorced from authorial intention." Is there an inconsistency, he is asking, within the discipline of literary study, if a text, presented to the literary critic for analysis in the light of one set of principles, is prepared for him by the editor under a different set of principles? An author's final intention, he believes, is like a Platonic archetype, unchanging, complete, and perfect in its own way, against which any one of its appearances in print can be corrected. Unfortunately, an author's intentions are not necessarily eternal and may exist as precariously as do any of their appearances: destroying a manuscript may destroy all trace of intention. Moreover, the separate appearances, even as an altered poem, have an existence as real as the archetype. (p. 142) Readers of literature, he says, are not accustomed to dealing with multiple wordings in a final text nor with composite authorship. Yet one Dickinson "poem," "Those fair—fictitious People," has twenty-six variants that fit eleven places, amounting to 7680 possible poems; and other poems, as traditionally printed and studied, would have to be called "Dickinson-Todd-Higginson's," since editors were responsible for some of the words. In the end, Franklin observes, "the fact that we are not organized to talk about an altered poem as a poem shows how little the subject of our pursuit is poetry" (p. 141). Two issues are involved in these considerations, and they are basic to all kinds of editing, whether the copy-text is an uncompleted manuscript or a printed edition: (1) What does "intention" signify, and when is it final? (2) Does it matter whether the author's wording is recovered, particularly when emendations by others are improvements? These questions ask for definitions of the three words "final authorial intention" and for justification of them as an expression of the goal of editing. I hope that what I have said up to now has provided some answers to them and will serve as background for the following brief replies, specifically directed at Franklin's conclusions. The second of the questions is easier to answer than the first. No one presumably would deny that any alteration in a literary work could be regarded as producing a different work and that the new work could be made the subject of critical analysis. Neither would anyone deny that nonauthorial revisions could produce a work superior to the original and more rewarding for study. 67 Nevertheless, if an editor sets out to edit the works of a particular writer, he has undertaken a task of historical research, and his goal must necessarily be the recovery of the words which the author actually wrote. That the bulk of scholarly editorial work has been of this sort does not imply that all critics will find this kind of edition appropriate for their purposes or that no other approach to editing is legitimate. A critic may choose to discuss a series of poems on death, say, rather than a series of poems by Milton, Shelley, Tennyson, and Dickinson; so long as he operates outside of a historical framework and makes no references to the authors or their times, he need not be concerned with whether he has the precise words of a particular author but only with whether he has the "best" version of each poem from an aesthetic point of view. Similarly, an editor could edit a collection of poems on death, letting his own aesthetic judgments guide him in improving upon any previously known version of each poem; the editor would become a self-invited collaborator of the original author, and the editorial process would be creatively, rather than historically, oriented. This kind of editing occurs regularly in publishing houses, and many books normally attributed to a single author are already the work of more than one person by the time of their first publication (one thinks immediately of the editorial labors of Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's). 68 The crucial point is that once a critic refers to two poems because they are by the same author , he has introduced a consideration extrinsic to the poems, and he must thereafter be concerned with the words which the author wrote. Studying poems by particular authors or representative of particular historical periods, therefore, requires a knowledge of what the authors themselves wrote; studying poems by theme or type, without regard for biographical and historical contexts, requires only poems, and the number of hands through which a poem has passed to reach its present state of excellence is irrelevant. Academic departments are usually organized to study the historical development of literature, and it is not surprising that scholars in those departments produce editions which attempt to recover authorial wording. That they do so, however, is not indicative of a split between editorial and critical theory. The other question—the meaning of "intention"—is too complicated a philosophical issue to be settled here; but we can at least agree that authorial intention in literature cannot simply be equated with an explicit statement by the author explaining his motives, purposes, aims, wishes, or meaning, for intention must surely exist even if no such statements were made or are extant, and any available statements may be inadequate or misleading. The only direct evidence one has for what was in the author's mind is not what he says was there but what one finds in his work. An editor, only through his analysis and understanding of the meaning of the work in the light of his knowledge of the author and the times, will be in a position to use authorial active intention as a basis for editorial choice. That is to say, of the meanings which the editor sees in the work, he will determine, through a weighing of all the information at his command, the one which he regards as most likely to have been the author's; and that determination will influence his decisions regarding variant readings. Recognizing "finality" of intention, in turn, depends on his ability to distinguish revisions which develop an intention in the same direction from those which push it in another direction: the former represent final intentions, the latter new intentions. Whether the editor rejects such "new" intentions or edits a separate text embodying them will vary with the particular situation. But so long as he is producing an edition of an author's writings, he must choose among the author's uncanceled variants or published revisions in the light of his total understanding of the work and its author. If it is objected that this conception of the editorial process gives an editor excessive freedom and substitutes subjectivism for rigorous discipline, two answers may be made. In the first place, a scholarly editor (as opposed to a creative one) is still pledged to print only the author's words. He may select readings on the basis of his own literary judgment only when the alternatives are authorial variants; when he chooses an authorial reading previous to the author's last one (or what he judges to be the last one), his justification is that the reading is "final" in terms of his view of the work as an organic whole and that the later reading either creates a new work or is an isolated alteration at odds with the spirit of the work. Beyond that, one may observe that critical perception is necessarily crucial to any act of historical reconstruction, any evaluation of evidence, and thus any edition labeled "critical"; therefore, as Greg says, "it would be disastrous to curb the liberty of competent editors in the hope of preventing fools from behaving after their kind." Perhaps the principal source of difficulty lies in thinking of the editorial and the critical functions as essentially distinct. When one recognizes that justice can be done to an author only by doing justice to his text, one also understands that the editor and the critic must be inseparable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * An earlier version of this essay was written in the spring of 1968 for the first volume of Bibliographia , a journal then proposed for publication by Oliver &amp; Boyd of Edinburgh. The plans for that journal have now been canceled by Oliver &amp; Boyd, who have ceased the publication of works of this nature; and I am publishing the essay here, considerably revised. I mention this background only because I have alluded in print to an article with this title as "forthcoming in Bibliographia "; such citations should now be taken to refer to the article printed here. 1 SB , 3 (1950-51), 19-36; reprinted, with a few revisions, in Greg's Collected Papers , ed. J. C. Maxwell (1966), pp. 374-391. Cf. Fredson Bowers, "Current Theories of Copy-Text," Modern Philology , 48 (1950-51), 12-20; and "McKerrow's Editorial Principles for Shakespeare Reconsidered," Shakespeare Quarterly , 6 (1955), 309-324. For a detailed examination of Greg's position and of the commentators upon it, see G. T. Tanselle, "Greg's Theory of Copy-Text and the Editing of American Literature," SB , 28 (1975), 167-229. The Center for Editions of American Authors of the Modern Language Association of America has published a manual based on Greg's approach, Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures (rev. ed., 1972); an appended essay, "Relevant Textual Scholarship," pp. 17-25, conveniently draws together references to many of the discussions of Greg's theory or of editions based on it. 2 "Textual Criticism," in The Aims and Methods of Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures , ed. James Thorpe (rev. ed., 1970), p. 33. Cf. his Textual and Literary Criticism (1959), p. 120: a critical edition attempts "to approach as nearly as may be to the ideal of the authorial fair copy." 3 "Some Principles for Scholarly Editions of Nineteenth-Century American Authors," SB , 17 (1964), 227. 4 I have made further comments on the role of judgment in editing in "Textual Study and Literary Judgment," PBSA , 65 (1971), 109-122. 5 It is convenient to use the word "author" in such statements as this. But nothing said here or elsewhere in this essay is meant to imply that scholarly editing is not also appropriate for anonymous works or works which are the product of an oral tradition. One can infer an "author" who created a given work even if a particular name is not attached to him or if "author" has to be defined as encompassing a number of people; in such cases, it is still meaningful to set as a goal the historical reconstruction of the text which reflects the intention (as defined below) of its creator(s) at a particular time. Cf. note 68 below. 6 Sometimes the literary effectiveness of a variant reading is used as an argument that the revision is authorial; but it is fallacious to assume that an author's revisions will always result in improvements (as judged by the editor or present-day scholars) and that no one else was capable of making such improvements. 7 Many of the general philosophical discussions do not take up the specific case of intention in literature (or in art generally), but such discussions may nevertheless provide some useful background by showing ways of approaching the subject. Two well-known works of this kind are G. E. M. Anscombe, Intention (1957; 2nd ed., 1963); and Jack W. Meiland, The Nature of Intention (1970), which includes a checklist of related studies on pp. 131-134. A general treatment of the theoretical basis for connecting intention and art is provided in Anthony Savile's "The Place of Intention in the Concept of Art," Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society , 69 (1968-69), 101-124. 8 Sewanee Review , 54 (1946), 468-488; reprinted in Wimsatt's The Verbal Icon (1954), pp. 3-18. They first set forth their position in the article on "Intention" in Dictionary of World Literature , ed. Joseph T. Shipley (1943), pp. 326-329; the criticism of this article by Ananda K. Coomaraswamy in "Intention," American Bookman , 1, no. 1 (Winter 1944), 41-48, was in part responsible for their elaborating their argument in the now famous essay. Since that time, each has restated and offered further comments upon the position. Beardsley began his Aesthetics (1958) with a section on "The Artist's Intention," pp. 17-29, 66-69; and more recently he has published The Possibility of Criticism (1970). And Wimsatt has made a "reentry into the debate" with "Genesis: A Fallacy Revisited," in The Disciplines of Criticism , ed. Peter Demetz, Thomas Greene, and Lowry Nelson, Jr. (1968), pp. 193-225. A great many discussions of the Wimsatt-Beardsley view have been published. Among the adverse criticisms, valuable essays are Eliseo Vivas's review of Verbal Icon , "Mr. Wimsatt on the Theory of Literature," Comparative Literature , 7 (1955), 344-361; William H. Capitan's examination of Beardsley's Aesthetics , "The Artist's Intention," Revue internationale de philosophie , 18 (1964), 323-334; and Michael Hancher's review of The Possibility of Criticism in Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism [ JAAC ], 30 (1971-72), 391-394. Leslie Fiedler's "Archetype and Signature: A Study of the Relationship between Biography and Poetry," Sewanee Review , 60 (1952), 253-273, which takes a view opposed to Wimsatt and Beardsley, led to the discussion of both essays by Emilio Roma III, "The Scope of the Intentional Fallacy," Monist , 50 (1966), 250-266; and Frank Cioffi's "Intention and Interpretation in Criticism," Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society , 64 (1963-64) 84-106, brought a rejoinder from Beardsley in a review in JAAC , 26 (1967-68), 144-146. Generally favorable responses are R. Jack Smith, "Intention in an Organic Theory of Poetry," Sewanee Review , 56 (1948), 625-633; and Rosemarie Maier, "'The Intentional Fallacy' and the Logic of Literary Criticism," College English , 32 (1970-71), 135-145 (with comments by Michael Hancher and Maier in the following volume, pp. 343-348). 9 Hirsch's argument had earlier appeared in "Objective Interpretation," PMLA , 75 (1960), 463-479, an essay included as an appendix in his book, pp. 209-244. The book, as an important and thoughtful statement of a position which has been unpopular since the advent of the New Criticism, has naturally been the subject of a great deal of discussion. Among the important reviews of the book are those by George Dickie, JAAC , 26 (1967-68), 550-552, and Robert Scholes, Philological Quarterly , 47 (1968), 280-283. The July 1968 number of Genre (1: 169-255) was devoted to "A Symposium" on the book, with contributions by Monroe C. Beardsley, George Dickie, Morse Peckham, Gale H. Carrithers, Jr., Leo Rockas, Arthur Efron, Merle E. Brown, and John Huntley. The following March Hirsch replied with "The Norms of Interpretation—A Brief Response," Genre , 2 (1969), 57-62; and he has recently offered a further elaboration of some of his ideas in "Three Dimensions of Hermeneutics," New Literary History , 3 (1971-72), 245-261. Morse Peckham discusses both the Wimsatt-Beardsley essay and Hirsch's book in "The Intentional? Fallacy?", New Orleans Review , 1 (1968-69), 116-124, reprinted in The Triumph of Romanticism (1970), pp. 421-444. 10 For instance, Wimsatt, recognizing that the contents of a work may be used to learn something about the author, says, "For whatever does get into a poem presumably is put there by the poet and reflects something in the poet's personality and life" ("Genesis: A Fallacy Revisited," p. 199). But the role of the editor is precisely to try to remove that "presumably" and to present a text consisting of what was in fact put there by the author. Similarly, Marcia Muelder Eaton, in "Good and Correct Interpretations of Literature," JAAC , 29 (1970-71), 227-233, remarks, "For purposes of simplicity I am assuming that the speaker uttered the words he meant to utter, i.e., that there were no slips of the tongue. This is certainly not too much to assume, since our main interest here is literature, and we certainly make such assumptions with respect to literary works" (p. 230). But slips of the author's pen or the compositor's hand, not later caught by the author, are the equivalent of "slips of the tongue" and certainly do occur in printed matter. 11 Throughout this essay I use "critical" in the common sense of "entailing judgment"—the sense which the word carries in the term "critical edition." I am not, that is to say, using "criticism" in the special sense which Hirsch ( Validity in Interpretation , pp. 210-211) gives to it in his distinction between "interpretation" and "criticism," where the first means "the construction of textual meaning as such" ("the meaning of the text") and the second "builds on the results of interpretation," confronting "textual meaning not as such, but as a component within a larger context" ("the significance of the text"). I do not discuss here (except briefly near the end of section III) editions which are not critical—editions, that is, which present exact transcriptions of particular texts and which do not involve the editor's judgment in emending those texts. 12 This view is expressed by Rosemarie Maier (see note 8 above): "it is extremely unlikely that the determination of a text to criticize is actually literary criticism; textual decisions, unless they are the result of criticism of each version as an individual poem, are actually pre-critical decisions" (p. 144). 13 This influential treatment of meaning (edited by J. O. Urmson from Austin's notes for the 1955 William James Lectures) provides a useful terminology for discussing speech acts. A "locutionary" act involves only the "performance of an act of saying something"; an "illocutionary" act involves the "performance of an act in saying something" (p. 99); and a "perlocutionary" act involves "what we bring about or achieve by saying something" (p. 109). Another important account of meaning, taking an intentionalist approach (based on the idea that language consists of "nonnatural" signs which are given an "occasion-meaning" by a speaker), is H. P. Grice's "Meaning," Philosophical Review , 66 (1957), 377-388, supplemented by his "Utterer's Meaning and Intentions," Philosophical Review , 78 (1969), 147-177. There have been a considerable number of papers which build upon or analyze Austin's and Grice's contributions. Austin has been used by, among others, William P. Alston in Philosophy of Language (1964), esp. pp. 34-49 (cf. his "Linguistic Acts," American Philosophical Quarterly , 1 [1964], 138-146), and John R. Searle in Speech Acts (1969), esp. pp. 54-71; and Michael Hancher has illustrated the usefulness of the concept of illocutionary acts in analyzing literature in "Understanding Poetic Speech Acts," College English , 36 (1974-75), 632-639. A "largely destructive criticism" of Grice which is of particular interest to students of literature is Max Black's "Meaning and Intention: An Examination of Grice's Views," New Literary History , 4 (1972-73), 257-279 (which also contains a listing of many of the previous commentaries on Grice). Marcia Eaton has contributed a checklist of material on speech-act theory to Centrum , 2, no. 2 (Fall 1974). 14 The essays referred to are Gang, "Intention," Essays in Criticism , 7 (1957), 175-186; Kemp, "The Work of Art and the Artist's Intentions," British Journal of Aesthetics , 4 (1964), 146-154; Peckham, "Reflections on the Foundations of Modern Textual Editing," Proof , 1 (1971), 122-155 (see p. 152; Peckham discusses these matters at greater length, but does not use these particular terms, in "The Intentional? Fallacy?", cited in note 9 above); Skinner, "Motives, Intentions and the Interpretation of Texts," New Literary History , 3 (1971-72), 393-408. See also Richard Kuhns, "Criticism and the Problem of Intention," Journal of Philosophy , 57 (1960), 5-23, which distinguishes "intention as aiming at a result" from "intention as the conveying of a meaning." George Whalley prefers to use the term "intension" (which he defines as "the impulsive orientation of the person [author] in a moment of awareness"), because "intention" implies "a disguised attempt to explain the contemplative in terms of the technical" ( Poetic Process [1953], p. xxvii). 15 "Three Kinds of Intention," Modern Language Notes , 87 (1972), 827-851. 16 Active intention thus corresponds to Austin's illocutionary act and to most of the locutionary act (Hancher, pp. 841-842). 17 The Possibility of Criticism , p. 30. 18 His emphasis on "the" in several key statements (e.g., p. 851) implies that other definitions of meaning are possible; indeed, he goes on to make explicit the point that "we may entertain other meanings that seem valuable." 19 Richard Ohmann has attempted to draw such a line in "Speech Acts and the Definition of Literature," Philosophy and Rhetoric , 4 (1971), 1-19; and "Speech, Literature, and the Space Between," New Literary History , 4 (1972-73), 47-63. His definition of a literary work is "a discourse whose sentences lack the illocutionary forces that would normally attach to them. Its illocutionary force is mimetic " (1971, p. 14). He insists that his dividing line is a firm one, but the result is that some utterances not usually regarded as literature (jokes, "ironic rejoinders," "fables within political speeches") fall on the literature side. "Let me simply record my belief," he replies, "that the definition is not severely at fault in admitting the wrong discourses to the category of literature" (p. 16). Cf. his earlier "Speech, Action, and Style," in Literary Style : A Symposium , ed. Seymour Chatman (1971), pp. 241-259: "literature can be accurately defined as discourse in which the seeming acts are hypothetical" (p. 254). Beardsley takes a similar approach but seems to concede that his dividing line is more suggestive than precise. Literature, he says, is characterized by "its exploitation to a high degree of the illocutionary-act potential of its verbal ingredients"; it is "the complex imitation of a compound illocutionary act" ( The Possibility of Criticism , p. 61). But he admits that what this amounts to is that a literary work has "richness and complexity of meaning"—or, earlier, that it "directs attention to itself as an object of rewarding scrutiny" (p. 60). More recently he has refined his definition, partly in response to Colin A. Lyas, who (in "The Semantic Definition of Literature," Journal of Philosophy , 66 [1969], 81-95) had criticized his previous definition of literature ( Aesthetics , pp. 126-128) as "a discourse in which an important part of the meaning is implicit." Beardsley now defines "literary discourse" as "discourse that is either an imitation illocutionary act or distinctly above the norm in its ratio of implicit to explicit meaning" (both help to make a discourse "an object of attention in its own right")—see pp. 37-38 of "The Concept of Literature," in Literary Theory and Structure : Essays in Honor of William K. Wimsatt , ed. Frank Brady, John Palmer, and Martin Price (1973), pp. 23-39. This kind of definition, it seems to me, does not solve the problem but only shifts the terms in which it is expressed: one still has the problem of distinguishing between real illocutionary acts and imitations of illocutionary acts. Moreover, Marcia Muelder Eaton has shown that the author's intention has just as direct a bearing on such imitations of illocutionary acts as on illocutionary acts themselves; she proposes (in an extension of Austin's terminology) that these imitations be called "translocutionary" acts. See "Art, Artifacts, and Intentions," American Philosophical Quarterly , 6 (1969), 165-169; and "Good and Correct Interpretations of Literature" (see note 10 above). E. D. Hirsch, in "Some Aims of Criticism" (in the Wimsatt festschrift, pp. 41-62), argues that literature has "no independent essence": "It is an arbitrary classification of linguistic works which do not exhibit common distinctive traits, and which cannot be defined as an Aristotelian species. . . . The idea of literature is not an essentialistic idea" (p. 52). Cf. also College English , 36 (1974-75), 453. 20 As Quentin Skinner puts it, "an understanding of conventions, however implicit, must remain a necessary condition for an understanding of all types of speech act." See p. 135 of his "Conventions and the Understanding of Speech Acts," Philosophical Quarterly , 20 (1970), 118-138. He later (in the article cited in note 14 above) makes a focus on conventions one of his two rules (along with focus on "the writer's mental world") for recovering intention (pp. 406-407). The role of conventions in understanding is one of the concerns of Karl Aschenbrenner, in "Intention and Understanding," University of California Publications in Philosophy , 25 (1950), 229-270. Saussure's distinction between "langue" and "parole," summarized by Hirsch in Validity in Interpretation , pp. 231-235 (cf. pp. 69-71, leading into his discussion of "genre"), offers an approach to the relation between the "system of linguistic possibilities" which a language provides ("langue") and an individual utterance made in that language ("parole"). Theories of language are discussed by Morris Weitz in connection with multiple interpretations of a literary work in Hamlet and the Philosophy of Literary Criticism (1964), pp. 215-227. See also P. F. Strawson, "Intention and Convention in Speech Acts," Philosophical Review , 73 (1964), 439-460, and other discussions of Grice alluded to in note 13 above. 21 Geoffrey Payzant expresses this idea in broader terms: "Of the shapes that are imposed through skill upon stuff . . . some are devised by the maker and some are not." See p. 157 of "Intention and the Achievement of the Artist," Dialogue , 3 (1964-65), 153-159. 22 "The Intentional? Fallacy?" (see note 9 above), p. 441. Cf. Sidney Gendin, "The Artist's Intentions," JAAC , 23 (1964-65), 193-196: "We do expect, much of the time, that authorship or discovery will carry with it expert knowledge. But in such cases it is the knowledge itself which becomes the ground for being the authority; the authorship is not the ground. . . . If an artist has some peculiar knowledge of his work, it is not obvious that this is so merely because he is its creator. We must have some independent means of establishing his expertness" (p. 194). René Wellek says that an author's statements "might not even represent an accurate commentary on his work, and at their best are not more than such a commentary," in his and Austin Warren's Theory of Literature (2nd ed., 1956), p. 137. 23 "The Artist's Intention" (see note 8 above), p. 328. 24 "Motives, Intentions . . ." (see note 14 above), p. 405. Of course, authors' statements may be deliberately deceiving rather than "self-deceiving." Beardsley points out that artists "are often inclined to the most whimsical and bizarre statements [about their work], and seem to enjoy being deliberately misleading"; see p. 292 of his "On the Creation of Art," JAAC , 23 (1964-65), 291-304. 25 Such as that supporting the idea offered by Beardsley in The Possibility of Criticism , pp. 16-37; or those opposing it presented by Hirsch in Validity in Interpretation , pp. 10-14, by Peckham in "The Intentional? Fallacy?" (see note 9 above), and by Hancher in "Three Kinds of Intention" (see note 15 above). 26 Coomaraswamy (see note 8 above) makes a similar point: "one can so identify oneself with a subject and point of view that one can foresee what will be said next. . . . If, in fact, one cannot do this, textual emendation would be possible only on grammatical or metrical grounds" (p. 46). Isabel C. Hungerland, too, comments on this matter: "The way in which we interpret (explain and see) a whole literary work may determine our understanding of words (e.g., where there are ambiguous words), of sentences (e.g., where ironic meanings are possible), or allusions"; see p. 742 of "The Concept of Intention in Art Criticism," Journal of Philosophy , 52 (1955), 733-742. Hans Zeller, in "A New Approach to the Critical Constitution of Literary Texts," SB , 28 (1975), 231-264, takes the "predictability" of a text as an argument against the use of the text as a key to its author's intention: "To edit the text according to the intention of the author, when the singularities of his intention are known to us only through this text, can be achieved only if the text is in a certain sense redundant, that is to say, predictable. But this condition is fulfilled, as experiments have shown, only in the case of utilitarian texts (e.g., newspaper articles), and not in the case of poetic texts" (p. 259). But this position surely takes "predictability" in too narrow a sense: the fact that "artistic structures . . . themselves transgress the rules or codes which they have set up in the text" does not mean that the critical editor is prevented from seeing when such a transgression is taking place. 27 Henry David Aiken puts the matter this way: "The aesthetic relevance of a particular interpretation . . . can be established only with respect to a certain mode of appreciation, a certain way of approaching and handling the work of art." See p. 748 of "The Aesthetic Relevance of Artists' Intentions," Journal of Philosophy , 52 (1955), 742-753. 28 Hirsch admits, "The text sometimes seems so much better if we ignore the author's probable intention or what he probably wrote. Every interpreter has a touch of the medieval commentator looking for the best meaning, and every editor has a drop of Bentley's blood. It is not rare that anachronistic meaning on some ground or other is undoubtedly the best meaning" ("Three Dimensions of Hermeneutics" [see note 9 above], p. 259). 29 As Cioffi (see note 8 above) says, "biographical facts act as a kind of sieve which exclude certain possibilities" (p. 90); "They can serve the eliminative function of showing that certain interpretations of a work are based on mistaken beliefs about the author's state of knowledge" (p. 92). Similarly, Huw Morris Jones, in "The Relevance of the Artist's Intentions," British Journal of Aesthetics , 4 (1964), 138-145, comments, "We can eliminate some interpretations as being such that an artist at a certain period in a certain society could never have intended such meanings" (p. 140). 30 "The Science of Interpretation and the Art of Interpretation," Modern Language Notes , 85 (1970), 791-802. The first, he says, involves questions of validity, the second questions of value. A similar distinction is made by Eaton in "Good and Correct Interpretations of Literature" (see note 10 above). 31 "Intention" (see note 14 above), pp. 184-186. Hirsch's principal discussion of "Unconscious and Symptomatic Meanings," on pp. 51-57 of Validity in Interpretation , tries to distinguish between those unconscious meanings that are "coherent with the consciously willed type which defines the meaning as a whole" (p. 54) and those that are "symptomatic" of the author's personality, attitudes, and the like. The latter, while interesting and even important, are not part of the "verbal meaning" of a work, whereas the former are a part of it, since they are locatable in a specific "linguistic sign." This dichotomy is of course an application of Hirsch's larger distinction between meaning and significance, but it also serves to illustrate that one cannot escape the primacy of the text itself as a guide to intended meaning. Some criticism of this part of Hirsch's discussion occurs in Beardsley's The Possibility of Criticism , pp. 20-21. 32 Theodore Redpath is making roughly the same point when he says that "the probable intention of the poet does at least sometimes afford a criterion by which to judge whether a certain meaning which is attributed to a poem is probably correct or not." See p. 366 of "Some Problems of Modern Aesthetics," in British Philosophy in the Mid-Century , ed. C. A. Mace (1957), pp. 361-390. In other words, the primary emphasis is on what one finds in the poem; one can then try to determine whether it is a possible, and even a probable, meaning for the author, given the circumstances he was in at the time, to have intended. Similarly, Savile (see note 7 above) remarks, "At least in the context of art we know that the temporal and geographical point of origin of the text, the documents accessible to the artist, and the cultural climate of his time are all of first importance in assessing what interpretation of his text is the best in the circumstances of its production. . . . With the aid of hindsight we may get closer to the best possible contemporary reading than any contemporary did. We may be helped in this by later works, or by theories of behaviour that make explicit to us what the artist only dimly intuited" (pp. 122-123). 33 Ray Lewis White's edition (1968), though it is called a "critical text," fails to make these decisions, for it includes in brackets in the text both the passages marked for deletion on the typescript and the further passages deleted in the printed text. I have commented on the shortcomings of this volume and the other volumes in this edition in "The Case Western Reserve Edition of Sherwood Anderson: A Review Article," Proof , 4 (1974), 183-209. 34 See Walter B. Rideout's review of White's edition of A Story Teller's Story in English Language Notes , 7 (1969-70), 70-73. 35 For further details, see The Rise of Silas Lapham , ed. Walter J. Meserve and David J. Nordloh (Selected Edition of William Dean Howells, 1971), pp. 373-388. 36 The relationship between the readings of the American and English editions is explored in detail in the "Note on the Text" to the forthcoming Moby-Dick volume in the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of The Writings of Herman Melville . 37 "Textual Introduction," in Miscellanies by Henry Fielding, Esq; Volume One , ed. Henry Knight Miller (Wesleyan Edition, 1972), pp. lii-liii. 38 Most of these techniques of bibliographical analysis are conveniently illustrated in Charlton Hinman's The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963); the principles underlying the use of the techniques are explored in Fredson Bowers's Bibliography and Textual Criticism (1964). 39 This example is discussed by Fredson Bowers in his edition of Crane's Tales of Adventure (University of Virginia Edition of The Works of Stephen Crane , 1970), p. 198. He takes up the general problem of "radiating texts"—the situation in which two or more extant texts are equally close to the lost manuscript, with no intervening texts surviving—in "Multiple Authority: New Problems and Concepts of Copy-Text," Library , 5th ser., 27 (1972), 81-115. 40 Anderson's editor, Ray Lewis White, seems to take both sides of the question. In his edition of Tar (1969), he says that "Anderson's loose punctuation, meant to reproduce for the reader a flowing, simple style, was standardized and 'stiffened' by the Boni and Liveright editors" (p. xvii); in Marching Men (1972), he reports that Anderson "learned to apologize for his untutored prose" and "continued all his life entrusting to his publishers final preparation of his writing" (pp. xxiv-xxv). Cf. note 33 above. For the view of a publisher's editor, defending publishing-house alterations as part of an author's intention, see Albert Erskine, "Authors and Editors: William Faulkner at Random House," in The William Faulkner Collection at West Point and the Faulkner Concordances , ed. Jack L. Capps (1974), pp. 14-19. Simon Nowell-Smith has provided a survey of author-publisher relations in respect both to punctuation and to censorship in "Authors, Editors, and Publishers," in Editor , Author , and Publisher , ed. William J. Howard (1969), esp. pp. 8-16. 41 A New Introduction to Bibliography (1972), pp. 340, 339. 42 Principles of Textual Criticism (1972), p. 165. Paul Baender similarly believes that the Center for Editions of American Authors (following Greg's principles) "has not sufficiently recognized that a writer's acquiescence in his publisher's alterations may also be construed as self-expression"; see p. 141 of "Reflections upon the CEAA by a Departing Editor," Resources for American Literary Study , 4 (1974), 131-144. Zeller (see note 26 above) goes farther and says that whatever an author passes in preparing the copy for an edition (with the exception of a strictly defined category of "faults") should be regarded as authorized, regardless of its source, for the author in passing it is reacting to a different version of his work in which it plays a role: "it does not matter whether the variants are original or extraneous, misprints (as we shall see, there are misprints and misprints) or variants introduced by a publisher's editor. . . . The necessary condition for our establishment of text is only that he [the author] should have registered the readings in question" (p. 256). Examining the author's motivation in passing certain readings which did not originate with him is futile, Zeller argues, because "the magnetic needle of the author's wishes is quivering in the field of non-aesthetic forces" (p. 245; see also note 52 below). 43 I have offered a more detailed and direct criticism of Thorpe's and Gaskell's position in SB , 28 (1975), 222-227. 44 The Waste Land: A Facsimile and Transcript of the Original Drafts Including the Annotations of Ezra Pound , ed. Valerie Eliot (1971), p. xxxii. 45 One must use such qualifiers as "in effect" when calling this kind of version a "new work," since obviously there must be something similar about the two versions or they would not be regarded as "versions of a work" in the first place. At the same time, there is the implication that not every difference produces, for the practical purposes of editing, a "new work." Cf. note 54 below. 46 Bowers, in his essay "Textual Criticism" in the Thorpe pamphlet (see note 2 above), briefly refers to such cases in which "the rewriting is so extensive as to make ridiculous any attempt at synthesis of the two forms in one critical text" (p. 47; see also his footnote 32). 47 Of course, a revision which does not actually implement the aim of, say, simplification may have been made by the author in the belief that it does. It may be impossible for an editor to distinguish between such revisions and those which genuinely were unconnected with the motive of simplification. All he can do is to judge, on the basis of the texts in front of him and his knowledge of the author, which revisions the author can reasonably be thought to have considered simplifications (whether or not they seem such to the editor himself). 48 For a more detailed discussion of these revisions and the editorial problems they pose, see Typee , ed. Harrison Hayford, Hershel Parker, and G. Thomas Tanselle (Northwestern-Newberry Edition, 1968), pp. 288-291, 315-318. 49 Whether or not one might wish to produce a separate text incorporating vertical revisions generally depends on how much historical or aesthetic interest such a text would have. In the case of revisions made because of outside pressure to expurgate, there would presumably be little interest in having a separately edited text of such a version. 50 Further examples of Melville's revisions of Typee , along with a discussion of the possibility of editorial rejection of authorial revisions in this and other works of Melville, are given by Hershel Parker in "Melville and the Concept of 'Author's Final Intentions,'" Proof , 1 (1971), 156-168. 51 Charles Vandersee, "James's 'Pandora': The Mixed Consequences of Revision," SB , 21 (1968), 93-108 (see p. 107). The same kind of comment can be made in regard to revisions in a lyric poem. Thomas Clayton, for instance, writing on "Some Versions, Texts, and Readings of 'To Althea, from Prison,'" in PBSA , 68 (1974), 225-235, says of two readings that "it is pointless to argue which is 'better'; the readings are different, and the versions of the poem are significantly different depending upon the presence of 'birds' or 'gods,' respectively: the dialectic of the whole depends upon the part" (p. 234). 52 Even a nonauthorial variant, of course, produces a separate work which could be made the subject of critical analysis, but the scholarly editor's aim, as it has been defined, is to reconstruct the text (or texts) in conformity with the author's intention. As to whether his aim should be so defined, see below in section IV. Zeller (see note 26 above) does hold the position that "a new version comes into existence through a single variant," because "a text, as text, does not in fact consist of elements but of the relationships between them" and therefore "variation at one point has an effect on invariant sections of the text" (p. 241). He believes that each authorized text has an integrity of its own and that the editor's duty is to intervene in a text only to correct "textual faults" (readings which contradict "the internal text structure" [p. 260] and which are confirmed as corrupt by bibliographical analysis). To judge variants individually and to emend one text with authorial variants from another is, in his view, to produce a "contaminated" text. Zeller has focused clearly on the problem, and certain parts of his discussion are similar to what I am saying here. The central difference between his position and the one I set forth below is that for him a "new version implies a new intention" (p. 241), whereas I believe that a critical distinction can be made between versions resulting from different intentions for the work as a whole and those resulting from the same intention. Furthermore, Zeller does not think that intention can be defined to exclude the nonliterary forces which affect authorial decisions: "What is termed the intention of the author is an undetachable part of these forces. . . . Only the textual history is within the editor's reach" (p. 244). But if it makes sense to speak of artistic and nonartistic elements in intention (that is, to speak of active intention and certain programmatic intentions), then there is surely a dividing line between them (however concealed) which critical intelligence can attempt to discover. Zeller's procedure does produce what can be called a critical text, because errors are corrected; but emendations of authorial variants are ruled out, and the issue finally becomes the question of the value of a critical approach to editing. 53 If they considered the variants singly rather than in groups, even a relatively small number of variants would result in an astronomical number of separate works; it is true, however, that any group of authorial revisions may contain some which seem to move in a different direction from the others and which thus demand separate consideration. 54 From here on I use "separate work"—as I trust the context indicates—in the practical sense of "a work to be edited separately." 55 Richard Kuhns (see note 14 above) is getting at this same question when he says, "Within limits changes can be made without altering the basic organization and fundamental meaning of the work; but if we go outside those limits the work is seriously affected. . . . There is a difference between the values of the parts of a work which if changed would not alter the over-all effect of the work, and the values of the elements of a work which if changed would alter the over-all effect of the work" (p. 18). The key, in his terms, is whether or not the "style" is affected, "style" being defined as "a kind of organization of elements capable of sustaining a constant 'focal effect.'" 56 For a fuller discussion of this document and its editorial implications, see Typee (cited in note 48 above), pp. 312-313. 57 In Bowery Tales (University of Virginia Edition, 1969). 58 I have discussed this case in connection with Greg's theory, on pp. 221-223 of "The New Editions of Hawthorne and Crane," Book Collector , 23 (1974), 214-229. 59 Bowers has made further comments on the relationships between editions offering "eclectic" texts and those offering texts of particular stages of revision, in "Remarks on Eclectic Texts," Proof , 4 (1974), 31-76. 60 Some of the earlier versions have been edited separately: see, for example, Whitman's Manuscripts: Leaves of Grass ( 1860 ), ed. Fredson Bowers (1955), which prints as parallel texts the manuscript versions of certain poems and their first published versions (in 1860); and Leaves of Grass: The First ( 1855 ) Edition , ed. Malcolm Cowley (1959). Cf. Bowers, "The Walt Whitman Manuscripts of 'Leaves of Grass' (1860)," in his Textual and Literary Criticism (1959), pp. 35-65. 61 As John Kemp (see note 14 above) says, "a published work of art has been, as it were, detached from the artist, and he has sent it out into the world, with the result that later versions do not necessarily cancel earlier published ones as later cancel earlier in the working-out stage before publication" (p. 152). 62 If finality is defined in terms of publication, one could say that the latter case involves multiple intentions. The whole pattern of revisions in such a case, however, separates it from the usual instances of continual revision and suggests that the author had not really come to a decision when he was forced to select one reading or the other for publication at a particular time. 63 For a fuller discussion of these problems (with somewhat different conclusions), see Robert Halsband, "Editing the Letters of Letter-Writers," SB , 11 (1958), 25-37; and Simon Nowell-Smith (see note 40 above), esp. pp. 16-27. 64 A good example of this method is the Harvard University Press edition of The Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks of Ralph Waldo Emerson , ed. William H. Gilman et al. (1960- ). The volumes of detailed transcription currently in progress are to be followed by selections in clear text. Whenever a text is likely to be quoted or reprinted frequently in standard typographical contexts where symbols and multiple readings seem (by tradition) out of place, it becomes particularly important to provide such additional clear texts, despite the theoretical difficulties they entail. For a discussion of some of the problems of editing journals, see William H. Gilman, "How Should Journals Be Edited?", Early American Literature , 6 (1971), 73-83. Cf. also G. T. Tanselle, "Some Principles for Editorial Apparatus," SB , 25 (1972), 41-88 (esp. pp. 46-47); and Eleanor D. Kewer, "Case Histories in the Craft of the Publisher's Editor, Culminating in a Justification of Barbed Wire," in Editor , Author , and Publisher , ed. William J. Howard (1969), pp. 65-73. 65 E. A. J. Honigmann, in The Stability of Shakespeare's Text (1965), argues that Shakespeare perhaps made revisions in the process of copying, so that some of the variants we now have may represent authorial "second thoughts." The editor, therefore, must "screw his courage to the sticking place and choose between each pair of variants"; what he is doing is "to attempt a feat left undone by Shakespeare, to finalise an unfinalised text" (p. 168). 66 Thomas H. Johnson's Harvard edition of Emily Dickinson's poems (1955) presents a clear text, with variant readings in notes; but the decisions as to which readings were to be included in the main text were not generally made on the basis of literary judgment. Cf. Johnson's "Establishing a Text: The Emily Dickinson Papers," SB , 5 (1952-53), 21-32. 67 James Thorpe, however, does not seem to me to give adequate recognition to this possibility in the opening chapter ("The Aesthetics of Textual Criticism," originally published in PMLA , 80 [1965], 465-482) of his Principles of Textual Criticism (1972). He grants that "status as a work of art is not affected by whether [the work's] intentions all belong to the titular author"; but he immediately adds that "the integrity of the work of art depends very much on the work being limited to those intentions which are the author's," and he then insists that it is this "final integrity which should be the object of the critic's chief attention" (p. 31). Of course, his book is concerned with editing which seeks to establish what the author wrote; but the nature of that activity might have been more helpfully defined in relation to other possible editorial goals. Instead, there is the implication (which contradicts the first statement quoted above) that the work of art can only be preserved through the efforts of editors who purge it of the nonauthorial features that it continually attracts. We are told that "forces are always at work thwarting or modifying the author's intentions" and that the work "is thus always tending toward a collaborative status" (p. 48); therefore, "aesthetic objects . . . must be protected in order to preserve the work from becoming a collaborative enterprise" (p. 49). The scholarly editor is not so much "protecting" the work as restoring a particular form of it which has historical (and perhaps also aesthetic) interest; purely as an aesthetic object the work might well be better off without protection. 68 See A. Walton Litz, "Maxwell Perkins: The Editor as Critic," in Editor , Author , and Publisher , ed. William J. Howard (1969), pp. 96-112. The author's attitude toward such changes is of course a separate matter, taken up in section II above. Morse Peckham has questioned whether it is meaningful to think of the "author" as distinguishable from others who work on the same text, and thus whether the recovery of authorial intention is a possible goal, in "Reflections on the Foundations of Modern Textual Editing" (see note 14 above). Whenever an author revises his work, Peckham argues, he is looking at something already created and is no longer in the position of the creator (or the "initiator" of the "discourse"); he may be the first to revise the work, but his activity is no different from that of publishers' readers or editors who come along later. Peckham's point is similar to the one I am making here, because it recognizes that the activity of "editing" need not have any connection with a concept of "author." I would go on, however, as Peckham does not, and claim that the initiator of a discourse can be identified as a historical figure (whether or not his name is known —cf. note 5 above), distinct from others because he is the initiator; that an interest may attach to this initiator; and that the task of attempting to segregate his contributions to the discourse from those of others is therefore one legitimate scholarly pursuit. I have commented in somewhat more detail on this argument of Peckham's in SB , 28 (1975), 215-219. Cf. also the remark by Anthony Savile (see note 7 above): "If art conveys value through intentional means it is entirely natural that we should single out for attention the agent whose intentions these are" (p. 106). Zeller's position (see notes 26, 42, and 52 above) is similar to Peckham's in stressing "the difficulty, indeed the impossibility, of obtaining a text attributable exclusively to the author" (p. 249). But, unlike Peckham, he does not reach the point of questioning the individuality of the "author"; indeed, he distinguishes between the attitude of the author toward his text and the attitude of "the reader, the exegete or the editor" (p. 258). Baender (see note 42 above) also agrees with some parts of Peckham's discussion; but he is opposing Peckham when he affirms his belief "that human beings are discrete, that an individual has the power and privilege of self-expression and of changing his mind, and that other individuals do not have the privilege of altering that self-expression or of forcing that change of mind" (p. 141).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Transcription of Manuscripts: The Record of Variants by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The present discussion is limited to special problems of editing transcriptions made of manuscripts in a non-facsimile manner and of recording corrections and revisions in the texts. The material on which this study is based comprises a miscellaneous group of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century manuscripts of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Walt Whitman, Stephen Crane, and William James. No particular magic inheres to this period or to these authors; moreover, it is fortuitous that they are American. The manuscripts, mostly holographs together with a few typescripts, were greatly altered in the course of inscription and often in later rounds of independent revision. So far as can be determined, however, the methodology I propose is equally applicable to scribal versus holograph manuscripts and to revised typescripts. Morever, it may seem probable that the system proposed would be applicable to many manuscripts of other periods and languages. However, I prefer to write of what I know from recent firsthand experience; thus I draw my illustrations (when they are not invented for convenience, and noted as 000.00) from the autograph manuscripts of William James, which present a useful conspectus of problems owing to James's custom of rapid composition and extensive revision. Note: Two general situations exist. In the edition of Whitman's Manuscripts: Leaves of Grass ( 1860 ) (University of Chicago Press, 1955) the diplomatic transcripts of the manuscripts, accompanied by apparatus, are arranged as a parallel text on facing pages with the 1860 printed edition. In Stephen Crane's Works (University Press of Virginia, 1969-75) some manuscripts, as in "Literary Remains" in volume 10, are diplomatic transcripts like the Whitman, others are ancillary to copy-texts drawn from printed editions, as in various of the Tales, Sketches, and Reports (volume 8), whereas others are used as the basis for a critical edition as in The O'Ruddy (volume 4), or else in The Red Badge of Courage (volume 2) which has a more eclectic text though using the manuscript as copy-text. The apparatus of manuscript alterations in the editions of William James's Pragmatism , The Meaning of Truth , and A Pluralistic Universe (Harvard University Press, 1974-76) deals with untranscribed manuscripts that are adjuncts to the first-edition copy-texts. Most conventions I have worked out for an apparatus are as applicable to one situation as to another, but special problems that need special treatment are raised by manuscripts that are not themselves the copy-texts for an edition, as in the James Works. Also distinguished, although occurring in both situations, are the separate problems of limited and precise entries versus the occasional necessity to transcribe, in the apparatus itself, extensive passages of text that exhibit alterations—a circumstance where an apparatus to an apparatus to record them is obviously impracticable. I should mention that my understanding of the possibilities for improving the notation has increased with experience and that over the course of time the system employed in the earlier editions has been refined. The apparatus for The Meaning of Truth is an example of a somewhat discursive method; that for A Pluralistic Universe is more condensed and sophisticated. Only the James volumes illustrate what I regard as a special contribution: a system for incorporating the description of alterations within a transcript of the finally revised state of a manuscript, not of its original unaltered state, as has previously been customary. The Meaning of Truth and more particularly A Pluralistic Universe illustrate a flexible method for special cases relating the description to the right of the bracket in an Alterations entry to the lemma to the left by means of single and double daggers, whereas Pragmatism employed a less refined system utilizing only a single dagger. Page-line references are to the ACLS edition by the Harvard University Press (1975) of The Meaning of Truth . The earlier examples are given in comparatively full form so that the recommended abbreviations, which appear later, can be understood. For many situations there exist various optional ways of dealing with the problem, many of which are illustrated. Once an editor sees the principles behind the options he can make choices according to his own preferences for clarity or economy and construct his own consistent system of notation. In certain cases a prefixed asterisk indicates the present writer's own recommendations. General methods of transcription divide neatly in two: (1) Transcription of the manuscript in a so-called clear text ; that is, a reading text without internal notes or description. Almost necessarily it is the finally revised form of the text that must be transcribed; the function of the apparatus appended to the reading text is then to inform the reader, first, what the original text was like before revision and, second, what were the exact details of the revisions that produced the transcribed final text by modifying the readings of the original. (2) Transcription of the manuscript in the form of a formulaic permanent record , not in a reading text, and with all description of the alterations placed within the transcript itself as a running commentary. The conventional method transcribes the original form of the text and lists the successive revisions at the spot where they occur, keyed to arbitrary symbols. The method suggested in this paper transcribes the final form of the text and describes revisions of original readings in a separate apparatus. However, when in this apparatus it is occasionally necessary to note alterations within the described text (not in still another apparatus to the apparatus), a new system is suggested that retains the virtue of transcribing the primary text in its latest form, not in its earliest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Clear-text Transcription and Apparatus The finally revised form of the text is transcribed diplomatically; that is, the transcription exactly follows the forms of the manuscript in spelling, punctuation, word-division, italics (for underlining), and capitalization, but not in matters of spacing or in line-divison, nor is a facsimile visual presentation of alterations attempted. Only a few of the problems that are inevitably encountered in engaging oneself to relatively exact transcription can be considered here. For instance, it is an open question whether unusual idiosyncrasies of no possible textual interest should be followed when their reproduction would add to the difficulty of a reading text. Although in general a scholarly transcript should follow an author's abbreviations or informal shorthand, with or without following periods, some personal peculiarities might be modified. For example, I have seen an early manuscript by Edith Wharton in which a mark about the size of a hyphen customarily does duty for a period. In my own view, it ought to be possible for a transcriber to print these as periods, with notice. The early twentiethcentury philosopher John E. Russell, as in his letters to William James, not only often used such hyphens for periods and even for commas but sprinkled his text with them where no punctuation could possibly have been intended. Transcripts of these letters would have been close to unreadable if draconian editorial omissions of these latter, and various emendations of the former, had not been made. Most printers may be unable, without expensive handsetting, to reproduce a manuscript's positioning of a period in an abbreviation directly under a superscript letter, in which case commonsense economy suggests that the period be silently moved to follow the letter, as in 'M r .' or 'C o .' Similar difficulties may be encountered in placing acute or grave accents above a full capital, but here I believe the manuscript must be followed and handsetting resorted to if the use of an accent above a small capital is not possible to get around the difficulty. If one's edition is printed by photo-offset of type and not from type-metal, then there is no problem, for all difficult characters and positioning can be drawn in before photographing. It is impossible to discuss here the numerous problems and the occasional modifications required to deal with authorial orthographic idiosyncrasies and to assess the actual intentions. Some authors form a few minuscules (lower-case letters) very much like majuscules (capitals). Ordinarily the context and syntactical position in the sentence prevent confusion, and it would be most unwise to transcribe an obviously intended lower-case initial letter as a capital just because of its formation. However, problems may arise in distinguishing minuscules and majuscules when capitalized personifications or conceptual nouns are possible, or in dealing with variant usage in words of region like east or East , and so on. Some writers intend to make a single word in forms like anyone or someone and may often link the two but on occasion write them separately but with a shorter space between them than is usual between two words, in which case the forms should be transcribed as single words. Note: Even in diplomatic transcripts it is impossible not to take account of authorial intentions. For instance, many authors intending to italicize a word will draw a line under it but fail to underline, let us say, the first and last letters. It would be pedantic to the highest degree to attempt to reproduce such a word in a mixture of italic and roman in accordance with the exact extent of the underline, even if this could always be determined with precision. (See the remarks in the text about the positioning of punctuation in relation to quotation marks.) Correspondingly, the font of punctuation after an underlined word needs to be arbitrarily transcribed, for few authors are so scrupulous as to make sure that an underline carries out their full intentions; or, in reverse, an underline may carelessly be extended too far and inadvertently affect punctuation that by all convention should be in roman. See below. The position of punctuation in relation to quotation marks is particularly difficult to transcribe since some authors have no fixed principle and may place a comma, say, inside or outside a quotation mark almost at random on those occasions when it is not written directly under the mark. Not only would it be expensive to try to reproduce in type punctuation directly under quotation marks but the attempt would be in vain since such authors will also vary the positioning slightly so that a transcriber would need to make dozens of arbitrary decisions whether punctuation were by a hairline to the left or right, or under, all to no useful purpose in transcription. Arbitrary normalizing is the only answer. Ordinarily even a writer who is highly variable in his positioning of punctuation in relation to quotation marks will conform to some extent to the national tradition. In the United States, by the late nineteenth century at least (I am not historian enough to know when the shift was made) under the influence of the typographers a decision was made for arbitrary placement of commas and periods ending a quotation inside the quote marks but colons and semicolons outside. Question and exclamation marks were treated logically: inside or outside according to the meaning. In Great Britain, on the contrary, although the treatment of colons and semicolons has lately had a tendency to agree with the American custom, 1 commas and periods in strict usage are placed inside or outside quotation marks (like question and exclamation marks) according as they form part of the actual quoted matter or else as they belong, instead, with the syntactical pointing of the sentence. If a writer has some tendency to observe one or other system, a transcriber may be forced to impose it on him throughout, without record, although a general statement to this effect ought always to be made. But relatively consistent idiosyncrasies should be observed as the norm. Note: Among the other matters that need to be made consistent in a transcript is the length of dashes according to their function, and also the matter of authorial spacing or non-spacing before and after dashes. Some authors may use, irregularly, a hyphen-length mark for a dash, or two or three such marks to add up to a dash, along with general dash-length marks of different lengths although not necessarily different functions. In printing it is ordinarily simplest to mark all internal dashes in a sentence as one-em in length. If an author does not appear to make any distinction, this same one-em dash may also be used when a sentence is ended without other punctuation as a suspension of thought, although I prefer the two-em dash for this purpose. One-em dashes may be most characteristic when used between complete sentences. Authors may have some general system of spacing in connection with dashes, which may be normalized as closeup or with intervening spaces according to their custom even if it is not regularly observed. A more subtle problem may arise not only in the transcription of the correct font of punctuation but also in seeing that the modern printer observes the transcriber's intentions. When words are italicized in manuscripts by underlining, the author may on occasion carelessly extend the underline below a following punctuation mark, thus appearing to italicize it. Printing practice through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has been highly variable in this matter of the font of punctuation to be used following an italic word when a roman word succeeds. Ordinarily there can be no question that within an italic passage all punctuation should conform to the italic text. Logically, in all other circumstances the font of the punctuation should be roman or italic depending upon its syntactical relationship to the font of the sentence as a whole or else to the italicized matter. For instance, in the commonest cases when one or more words are italicized and a syntactical unit of the roman sentence requires a punctuation mark after the last italicized word, the sentence then continuing in roman, the font of the syntactical punctuation must be in roman since it applies not to the italicized matter but to the roman sentence, as in a sentence, 'What we know is this : the correlative . . . .', or 'If we write the word truth , we should mean . . . .' Quotation marks enclosing an italicized word or phrase in a roman sentence should be in roman, and so on. 2 In some cases the matter is not merely a typographical one, since meaning can be involved. Of course, the logical system here described has its basis in meaning, but vide Orwell some situations may be more meaningful than others. A roman interrogative sentence, for instance, may end with an italic word and an exclamation or question mark. If the mark is in roman, the reader is instantly made aware that the sentence as a whole is the exclamation or the query but not the italicized word(s). Similarly, if the roman sentence is declarative but the italic word (or words) ending the sentence constitutes a question, the italic question mark (or exclamation) satisfactorily transmits this sense. For a time the best modern printers maintained this distinction about all roman and italic punctuation when their copy gave them any encouragement, but the present-day printer is growing careless and is as likely as not to set italic punctuation after any italic word regardless of the syntactical logic, and—worse—regardless of the exact underlining of his copy. A scholar transcribing manuscripts, therefore, is faced with a decision which is most easily solved by just such an arbitrary rule (after a general statement to the effect) as was made about the positioning of punctuation vis-à-vis quotation marks; that is, roman or italic punctuation should be marked in the transcript according to the font that is appropriate for meaning according to the logical relationship of the punctuation to the text. Note: The influential University of Chicago Manual , followed by some modern printers, recommends (p. 104, sec. 5.2) that punctuation should generally be printed in the same style or font of type as the word, letter, character, or sample immediately preceding it. Whatever the aesthetic virtues of this procedure, it is illogical and must not be followed in scholarly writing, least of all in the transcription of manuscripts unless one is quoting from an original printed work with such typography. For instance, in the sentence 'I do not believe that , despite what you say', the comma after italic that must be roman. (In reverse, if the sentence were italic but the 'that' in roman, the comma should properly be in italic.) A series of separate italic words in a roman context cannot be treated like an italic passage, however. 'The words he used were self-sufficient , reliant , brave ' (roman commas) and ' The words he used were self-sufficient, reliant, brave' (italic commas). It is proper to write an italic sentence with italic punctuation such as: ' He asked: "Will you come in?" ', but if the basic sentence were roman, it would read: 'He asked: " Will you come in? "', with roman colon and quotation marks. (Incidentally these illustrations show the necessary placement of one's syntactical punctuation in relation to quotation marks so as to distinguish quoted punctuation from non-quoted, a necessity in textual work although it violates popular American typographical custom.) A problem arises in dealing with early manuscripts before italic commas were introduced into the printer's cases. In a facsimile reprint of a printed text the roman commas in italic context must be preserved, just as one preserves all of the printer's wrong-font punctuation. However, in the transcript of a manuscript of this period, it would be pedantic in the extreme to imitate the contemporary printer's case with roman commas in italic context, and a transcriber should consider the simplicity of using the logical system uniformly, regardless of the period of his manuscript. The further problem of forcing one's modern printer to follow exactly the extent of the underline in one's transcript must then be met; usually general instructions are insufficient since they do not get transmitted to all the compositors who may work on a book, and in addition to specific instructions one must mark the typescript with warning signs about the font in any case (which is any case) when the printer is likely to go astray. Diplomatic transcription and setting into type produce another particular problem in the word-division. Many authors are irregular in their division: the same word may be written as one word, as two, or as a hyphenated compound. Even if an author is scrupulous in his division, a word broken at the end of a line by a hyphen may create a problem of interpretation whether it should be transcribed as a single word or a hyphenated compound. 3 Unfortunately, the clearest way of recording such words is impracticable; that is, it would be possible to transcribe them as broken, with a vertical stroke (or less preferably a slant) indicating the line-ending, as in child-|like . (Note that words broken at the end of a line, as marked, should always be set close-up.) The difficulty is that such scattered line-ending notations are obtrusive and could be subject to misinterpretation because of their use only on special occasions. 4 It may seem that this is another case where some editorial decision is needed to govern the form used in the transcription. Obviously, if there is no question that the word must or must not be a hyphenated form, one should transcribe it correctly and in silence. If the phrase vis-à-|vis or the number thirty-|four or a capitalized compound like neo-|Platonic were broken as marked, no problem exists, nor need there be any problem about broken compounds like eye-|sensations , world-|romance , or anti-|absolutist where a single word would be practically impossible. If an author can be shown to be consistent, a hyphenated form broken at the end of one of his lines can be transcribed silently according to his invariable custom. If he always writes to-day , then when to-|day is found it is unlikely to be today . Analogy can be misleading in determining authors' practice in such matters, however, and one must make sure of the invariable treatment of the word itself: with William James, for example, co-|exist can be transcribed coexist with confidence; on the other hand, pre-|exist or co-|ordinate might as easily be pre-exist and co-ordinate as preexist and coordinate and could not be transcribed as one or the other silently. Since it is not advisable to mark merely such problem words in the text with a line-ending stroke, an editor must transcribe one or other form according as he estimates the odds favor his choice, but the facts should be noted so that a user of the transcript may be warned that the forms of certain words have been editorially interpreted. Moreover, the printer setting the transcript into type will perforce break words that could cause a reader some perplexity about their form in the manuscript. These cases are easily enough handled by a word-division list in three sections as part of the apparatus. In the first section it is convenient to state that all end-of-the-line hyphenated forms in the modern typesetting are to be taken as unbroken single words unless specifically noted otherwise. Thus a reader can readily recover the exact hyphenation or non-hyphenation of the manuscript when the form occurred within a line, and so was not subject to dispute, by knowing that all hyphenated compounds of this kind that happen to be broken at the end of the line by the modern printer will be specified in the apparatus-list. The form there is best given visually as it occurs in the printed text: 000.00 pre-|empted 000.00 well-|being 000.00 co-|implicated 000.00 after-|thought The presence of these words in the list guarantees that they do not come under the general rule that hyphenated broken words in the modern print are to be ignored; these would have read in the manuscript pre-empted , well-being , co-implicated , and after-thought . A second list in the apparatus can treat doubtful words broken in the manuscript at the end of a line, with the form the transcriber has chosen to print in his text, either hyphenated or unhyphenated. The presence of these words indicates to the reader that an editorial decision has been made (unbroken words would have been broken in the manuscript only at the point where ambiguity about their form could exist): 000.00 pre-empted 000.00 precondition 000.00 coexist 000.00 re-compounding A third list should contain the more uncommon occurrences of doubtful words broken at the end of a line in the manuscript and also in the modern print. In these cases the editor will give the forms he thinks should be transcribed if a reader were to copy out the passage containing the words: 000.00 pre-|empted ( i.e. , pre-empted) 000.00 co-|exist ( i.e. , coexist) Needless to say an editor should exercise some discrimination in the selection of words for recording in this apparatus and need not list obvious cases where there could be no dispute about the author's intentions. If an editor prefers, these listed words could be included instead in the general apparatus. Note: If the transcription is for a critical edition of the manuscript text containing a list of Emendations, this Emendations list will be the most logical place for the words broken in the manuscript, just as the Historical Collation (if one is provided) would also be the most logical place for the words broken by the modern printer but not in question in the manuscript (although they could be placed in the Emendations list with the correct form followed by stet ). But placement among the entries in the list of Alterations in the Manuscript would be at best an anomaly and to be avoided in favor of separate listing. The simple notation found in the first and third word-division lists ought to do if the items are integrated in the general apparatus. For instance, if the printed text broke a word that was hyphenated in the manuscript, the notation in the Historical Collation would read: to-|day] to-day MS. Similarly, if the word were broken in the manuscript, and transcribed with a hyphen by the editor: to-day] to-|day MS. If in the manuscript and the modern printed text the word were similarly broken: to-|day] to-|day MS ( i.e. , to-day). However, readers will find them most convenient to use if they have been set apart in a separate section for emphasis and not buried in a mass of other matter with which they have little in common. (For the forms of such lists and their headnotes, see the Centenary Edition of Nathaniel Hawthorne, the University of Virginia edition of Stephen Crane, and the ACLS edition of William James for the Harvard University Press.) Whether letters or numbers are used, footnote apparatus indicators in a reading text are a nuisance for the majority of readers of a clear text, who do not at all times wish to consult the apparatus for a view of the growth and revision of the text. An editor is best advised to key his apparatus to the page-lines of his own printed text, with or without marginal line numbering. Note: Line-numbering in the margin (if sufficiently discreet) may be useful but is still slightly obtrusive, and publishers are likely to feel that it puts off the 'general reader.' Any scholar who proposes to use the apparatus extensively can make up for himself a slip of paper or cardboard numbered according to the printed lines on the page and use this for ready reference. Some publishers may provide such a ruled card laid-in separately. Since the extensive users of an apparatus are likely to be in a minority compared to those who utilize the text chiefly as a reading edition, the convenience of the majority, and the virtues of a truly clear text, suggest the removal of line-numbers from the margin, although the line-numbering of poetry is often accepted as a real convenience. Correspondingly, the apparatus of variants in a clear-text edition is best placed in the back of the book and not at the foot of the pages unless the text relies for its main interest on the account of the alterations so that readers will require them in the most convenient place for reference—certainly the foot of the page. 5 The simplest way of keying is to give the page number first, followed by a period and then the line number(s). For economy, similar entries within some unit like a chapter, or within a reasonable distance of each other, may be brought together: 243.18,20 will] interlined above deleted 'would'; or 243.18;244.20 will] above del. 'would'. In the second example the semicolon is required to distinguish separate pages, whereas occurrences on the same page are separated by commas: 243.18,20;244.31. It is economical of space to mark these numbers for close-up setting. Formulas for describing alterations are an essential, and it is important that they be as descriptive as possible. The entry starts, after the page-line reference, 6 with the lemma to the left of the square bracket. This lemma is ordinarily the exact word or words found in the text. If anything longer than a word or two is being recorded in the lemma, space can be saved by the system of three dots (or four for a sentence end) to indicate omitted material that will be found in the text: 000.00 As . . . words]. The general rule is that punctuation following a word in the text is not noted in the lemma before dots or at the end of the lemma unless it is a part of the variant. For instance, in 000.00 list] final 's' deleted it is of no concern whether the text word read 'list,', 'list.', or 'list' with no punctuation so long as the punctuation was not affected by the alteration. (However, if a complete sentence forms the lemma, it is convenient for clarity to provide the closing period, with another in the description.) On the other hand, a comma after list would be required in the lemma in such cases as these and in any others that affect the punctuation: list,] comma added list,] semicolon altered to comma list,] interlined above deleted 'note,' Note: It goes without saying that punctuation that is part of the revision must always be noted as an integral part of the lemma as well as in the description. Since in the example here noted the comma after list was a part of the interlineation and the comma after note was deleted as a part of the revision, each must be given. When the punctuation is not part of the revision, mention need not be made. If in the illustration the comma after deleted note in the text had been retained in the manuscript in order to apply to interlined list (without a comma), no punctuation would appear in the lemma or description. Alteration of punctuation consequent upon substantive revision is of course described: list] interlined above deleted 'note' before comma altered from semicolon . The syntactical modification of this condensed description requires before to apply only to note ; if the punctuation described had applied to list , the lemma would have read: list,] interlined with comma altered from semicolon above deleted 'note'; or, more economically: list,] above del. 'note'; comma alt. from semicolon . It is by no means uncommon for an author to neglect to delete punctuation in a revised part of the manuscript although supplying the substitute in the revision. For example, William James might almost as readily have added a comma after interlined list but neglected to delete the comma after rejected note as he might have allowed the undeleted text comma to stand for the intended punctuation after list interlined without a comma. This duplication is an error, of course, but of so trifling a kind as not to be worth recording when the punctuation is identical and no possible textual interest is present. Normally, the comma after list must be recorded as part of the interlined revision; thereupon the simplest way of solving the problem is to assume (silently) that the comma after note had also been deleted as it should have been, and so describe it. If the punctuation differs, the original must always be noted, but again it is simplest to take the intention for the deed and not to specify that, in the case here, the semicolon was carelessly left undeleted: list,] interlined above deleted 'note;'. Otherwise one is stuck with an expanded entry of questionable value taking up extra space: interlined above deleted 'note' before undeleted semicolon . In the above examples, the lemma is itself the alteration. However, some alterations—principally deletions—will not be present in the text and need to be keyed by reference to another word acting as the lemma: this] followed by deleted 'notion'; or: is] preceded by deleted 'notion'. Whether followed by ( before ) or preceded by ( after ) is used may be dependent on two factors. First, a word distinctive enough to be readily located in the text-line by a reader is more useful for positioning an entry than a neutral and commonplace word too easily overlooked. For this reason, a , the , is , and the like are less desirable as lemmata than other parts of speech. It is better to write: reflection] after deleted 'thought' (than) the] before deleted 'thought'. Moreover, it is simpler for a reader to follow a revising author's chain of thought if an alteration can be positioned by a lemma that illuminates the alteration. For instance, if an author first writes reflection but then deletes it and adds thought , the association is better shown by: thought] after deleted 'reflection' (than by) signifies] before deleted 'reflection'. In any clash of interests the second factor is subsidiary to the first, for quick identification is certainly of primary importance. Occasionally identification of a lemma is obscured by the duplication of the identical word in the same line. The double occurrence must be taken account of in one's typescript of the apparatus made up from the temporary lining of the text before printing so that the exact word can be identified when the text is received in page proof, with different lineation. Thus in a case where the word is was inserted, and in one's copy-text (or in one's typescript) another is appears in the same line, one may adopt either of two means of identification. The most economical is to distinguish the lemma by a superscript figure depending upon whether it is the first, the second, etc., same word in the line: 1 is] interlined (or) 2 is] interlined . Especial care is needed later to check whether in the page proof is is in fact repeated in the same line and if so whether the original superscript figure still remains accurate. If the repetition is not present in the proof of the text, then of course the figure is removed before the apparatus is typeset. 7 (Also, as a part of the rekeying of the typed apparatus to the different lining of the final text in page proof, any lemma must be checked to see that a repeated form has not crept in the proof [though not present in the copy-text] that will require identification by superscript figure.) Although more wasteful of space, positive identification of a lemma may also be made in certain circumstances by adding a word to the lemma or to the description that will distinguish it from the same word elsewhere in the line: 2 is] interlined (better than) is] interlined before 'not' is not] 'is' interlined is not] after deleted 'may' (better than) 1 is] after deleted 'may' When an apparatus is being constructed not for a manuscript text that is being critically edited as in Stephen Crane's The O'Ruddy or The Red Badge of Courage but instead for a manuscript associated with an edition of a printed text, as in a revised book version that has been chosen as copy-text over the manuscript, some special problems arise about the lemmata. In William James's Meaning of Truth (1909), for instance, Chapters XIV and XV were heavily revised in the book from draft manuscripts that seem to have served as the basis for lost printer's-copy typescripts. Since in this case the further revised book was chosen as the copy-text for a critical edition (1975) in James's Works, the edited volume contains as apparatus a list of Emendations to the Copy-text, an Historical Collation of all rejected readings (accidental as well as substantive) in the manuscripts, and a list of Alterations in the Manuscripts. Note: Lengthy as an Historical Collation may be that includes the rejected accidentals of the manuscript as well as its substantives, the manuscript cannot be fully reconstructed without this record. The present paper, therefore, assumes that rejected accidentals will appear in the Historical Collation. Ultimately, their inclusion is an editorial decision dependent in considerable part on the close or distant relation of the manuscript to the copy-text, since the question arises only when the manuscript is not itself the copy-text. In some editions an editor may deliberately choose to record only substantive differences in the manuscript, in which case he must decide whether also to add a list of alterations in the manuscript that will enable a reader to reconstruct the substantive changes from the original in the manuscript's final text, or to ignore such alterations in favor of a collation only of the finally revised substantive variants. Such a compromise might be acceptable where a draft manuscript varied so basically from a final book or from another manuscript text as to make reconstruction of its details very difficult indeed. In these cases an editor should contemplate the possibility of reprinting the draft diplomatically with its own apparatus, as occasionally in the Crane edition. The problem then arises of recording the variants between this reprinted draft and the final text. In one sense an editor has done his duty by simply reprinting the two texts and thus permitting an interested reader to determine the variants for himself. On the other hand, if the space can be managed, an ideal edition would offer not only the two texts but also a working collation that would save the reader the labor of recording the detailed comparison himself, or at least would serve as a more accurate standard and source of reference for whatever comparison he wished to make. For attempts to solve these problems, see Stephen Crane, The Red Badge of Courage: A Facsimile Edition of the Manuscript , ed. F. Bowers (Bruccoli-Clark, NCR/Microcard Editions, 1973). The Historical Collation is made up from the finally revised readings of the manuscripts and (combined with the Emendations) enables a reader to reconstruct in every detail the manuscripts' revised texts. It is, then, the function of the Alterations list to complete the apparatus for the reconstruction of the manuscript by listing every alteration, whether of correction or revision, that James made during composition and review. Note: Ideally, every change would be recorded, no matter what its import or significance. However, slips of certain specific nature were excluded in this list for The Meaning of Truth and later volumes because the list was not made up for a transcript of the manuscript printed as the edition-text; the existence of the book as copy-text for the edited critical edition allowed the size of the Alterations apparatus to be reduced by excluding certain categories of mechanical slips of no critical significance. (See below under Alterations by superimposition for the categories of omissions.) It is true that students of Elizabethan manuscripts may gain valuable insights into the possible source of errors in printed texts by observing scribal slips that might occasionally explain doubtful readings in printed texts the manuscripts of which have been lost. In nineteenth and twentieth-century texts, however, the relating of possible errors in the print to hypothetical authorial slips in inscription may seem to be a more tenuous exercise and not worth the apparatus involved unless solid evidence for an author is present about the value of such evidence. The situation changes, of course, if the edition is of the manuscript itself. Since the book-text often varies from the manuscript, a difficulty arises in the form of the lemmata of the list of Alterations which should key the readings of the two documents, for the lemma of a revised manuscript reading may not be present in the still further revised book-text. These differences being of various kinds yield to various methods of treatment. In the first paragraph of Chapter XIV The Meaning of Truth book-text reads but it entirely fails to hit the right point of view . In the manuscript hit is also the final reading, though revised from an earlier word, and so it is simple to write: 146.3 hit] interlined above deleted 'place himself at'. On the other hand, the book's it before entirely was originally he in the manuscript, and this he has been deleted without substitution. The notation is simple enough: 146.3 entirely] after deleted 'he'; nevertheless, there are elements of ambiguity present for a reader engaged in reconstructing the manuscript from references to the book-text in the Alterations: it is theoretically possible, of course, that MS could have read it before deleted he . True, if this had been the reading, the positioning of the entry for deleted he by the use of the key entirely would have been misguided on the part of the editor, for a normal entry would have read, more helpfully: it] before deleted 'he'. Moreover, if it had been squeezed in as an insertion before deleted he , or interlined as a substitute, the entries would have read respectively: it] inserted before deleted 'he' (or) it] above deleted 'he'. Thus an expert reader with some difficulty might figure out from the nature of the entry that it was not present in MS, and if he needed confirmation he could secure it from the Historical Collation where the absence of the word in MS would have been noted: it] omit MS. Still, even though it is obviously impossible to reconstruct a manuscript from an apparatus without the simultaneous use of the Historical Collation and the list of Alterations, an editor should be as helpful as he can in assisting a reader to find his way about; thus a dagger placed before the page-line reference informs the reader that in some respect the particular MS listing differs from the book reading in the lemma and he had better consult the Historical Collation (HC) to understand the difference. By this convention, the Alterations entry would read: †146.3 entirely] after deleted 'he'. The virtue of the daggered entry is that it utilizes a lemma keyed to the book-text—one either identical with or readily identifiable in the Historical Collation—and yet conveys the essential information without elaborate description of manuscript variants that have no direct pertinence to the main point of the entry. For instance, in The Meaning of Truth at 155.7-8 (references are to the Works) the book copy-text reads But probably your intent is something different; so before I say . . . . In the manuscript this is an interlineation above deleted But before saying , but the manuscript inscription arrived at the book-text wording only after some revision of the original form of the interlineation. If the final form of the manuscript had been identical with that of the book, a regular entry could have been contrived without difficulty; however, there happens to be one accidental variant in that the manuscript places a comma after so whereas no comma is present in the book. The essential fact a reader wants to know from the Alterations is that this passage was an interlined revision of a brief phrase; second, that it was also revised during the course of interlineation. That in the MS a comma is found that is not present in the book has nothing to do with the central fact of interlineation. The convention of the dagger deals with this situation very efficiently by conveying to the reader all the major information about the interlineation and its revision but with the warning that some detail, unessential to an understanding of the central facts of revision, has not been noticed in the manuscript description (since although part of the major alteration it was not itself an independent change that required listing). The reader can then identify this detail (or details) in the Historical Collation. †155.7-8 But . . . say] above deleted 'But before saying'; 'your intent' added after independently deleted 'you' and 'that is' 8 The Historical Collation, to which the dagger entry directs the reader, provides the one point of variance between the book-text and the final readings of the MS: 155.8 so&amp;c.rat;] ~, MS. A substantive variant is present in the next example. The book reads proposition is one the whereas the MS interlined substitute for a deleted earlier reading is proposition means one the . A normal entry would read: 146.5 proposition . . . the] MS 'proposition means one the' above deleted 'idea is one whose'; but the daggered entry saves space: †146.5 proposition . . . the] above deleted 'idea is one whose'. By referring the reader to the Historical Collation (which would read: 146.5 is] means MS) for the variant, which is only a minor detail in the major fact of the interlined revision, the need to quote the passage in order to note the substantive variant is obviated. 9 A similar example is: †149.24-25 all . . . associates,] interlined . Here the book reads all such accidents as contents, implications, and associates whereas the MS has all such accidents as contents and implications, and associates . Note: A descriptive entry, without dagger, could read: 149.24-25 all . . . associates,] interlined ; MS reads 'contents and'. Descriptive entries that require quoting can extend themselves unduly, however, as when MS interlines harmless an account and the book reads harmless and natural an account . Here the daggered entry would be simply: harmless . . . account] interlined (but) a descriptive entry: interlined ; MS reads 'harmless an account' (or) (MS 'harmless an account'); interlined . These illustrations have concerned variants in the manuscript that were not represented in the words of the lemma; but so long as the situation is clear in the Historical Collation, a considerable flexibility is possible that saves valuable space even when variant words or accidentals are present between the lemma and the manuscript. In some cases, as will be shown below under the convention of the double dagger, it would be inefficient to refer the reader to the HC for a variant in which the manuscript encloses a word in single quotation marks but the book removes the quotes: †000.00 &amp;c.rat;truth&amp;c.rat;] interlined above deleted ''verity''. Such an expedient would prevent the necessity to quote, as in the normal entry: 000.000 &amp;c.rat;truth&amp;c.rat;] MS ''truth'' above deleted ''verity''. But, as will be suggested, this is the sort of case easily handled in another manner. On the other hand, in the next example the single-dagger entry is highly efficient. At 158.4-5 the book reads distinct from either the fact or whereas the MS interlined words are different from either the event or . The normal quoting entry would need to read: 158.4-5 distinct . . . or] MS 'different from either the event or' above deleted 'only another name for'; 'either' inserted . On the other hand, when the single dagger is used to refer the reader to the HC for the facts of verbal variance, a condensed entry can read †158.4-5 distinct . . . or] above deleted 'only another name for'; 'either' inserted . It is impossible to condense a quoting entry in the form 158.4-5 distinct . . . or] MS 'different . . . event or' above deleted 'only another name for'; 'either' inserted . The reason is that within single quotes all matter must be exactly transcribed, and literally such an entry would mean that in the manuscript the three dots were present between different and event . The case is altered in the Historical Collation, however, where the book-text is available to provide the full reading of the lemma and no single quotes limit the conventions of listing variants to the right of the bracket. Thus although two separate entries in the HC could be written, one for distinct [ different and the other for fact ] event , an acceptable HC entry could pinpoint the only variants: distinct . . . fact] different . . . event MS. In some examples a line of apparatus might be saved, but not in all. This form would be especially useful in such variants as: is . . . is] was . . . was MS. When an editor is concerned to save space, the single dagger referring the reader to the HC can be very useful if a somewhat drastically reduced notation is thought to be acceptable. For example, a complete normal entry would read: 148.1 consequences] MS 'consequences that follow from their *nature [ above deleted 'assumption']'. (For the use of the asterisk in this context, see below under the section on the transcription of variants without an apparatus.) In such a case the daggered entry †148.1 consequences] MS 'nature.' above deleted 'assumption.' by its reference to the HC would clarify the otherwise gnomic description, for the HC would read: 148.1 consequences] the consequences that follow from their nature MS. In a more complex example, with more widely divergent text, the book reads Perhaps the rising generation will grow up but the manuscript I must appeal to the rising general . Perhaps they may grow up , in which must was interlined above deleted shall . Ordinarily the Alterations entry would need to quote the whole in order to key in the single change from shall to must in an understandable context. However, as in the example from 148.1 above, this would unnecessarily duplicate the HC, which would read: 159.13-14 Perhaps . . . up] I must appeal to the rising general. Perhaps they may grow up MS. Thus it should be possible by the single dagger to save space in the Alterations by listing only the one change in the manuscript and referring the reader to the HC for the context: †159.13-14 Perhaps . . . generation] MS 'must' above deleted 'shall'. Special emphasis must be laid on the fact, however, that single-daggered entries of this nature in the Alterations must have the same lemma as that in the Historical Collation, else the necessary ready reference cannot be made. In the convention of the single-dagger entries in the Alterations, the lemma in agreeing with or being easily recognizable in the Historical Collation must also agree with the edited text which the reader is using as the basis for following the changes made in the course of writing and revising the manuscript. When no dagger prefixes the page-line reference, the reader can be assured that the text of the book and of the final manuscript form is identical within the range covered by the Alterations lemma unless variants to the right of the bracket are specifically quoted and identified as MS readings not altered by revision. Thus it is the function of the single dagger to refer the user to the HC only for variant manuscript altered readings of words or accidentals (a) not printed in the Alterations lemma, or (b) not specified in the descriptive part of the entry as MS readings. 10 On the other hand, a considerable amount of space devoted to quoting MS variants of a certain kind can be saved by the convention of the double dagger which is used to warn the reader that the lemma is not (as in every other circumstance) the reading of the book-text but instead that of the manuscript. Note: Discretion is of course necessary as to what is and is not an accidental variant warranting, according to the circumstances, either the single or double dagger. For instance, if the editor has stated that in the Historical Collation he will not treat ampersands and normal shorthand abbreviations as recordable variants, it would be anomalous to give them single daggers in the Alterations list—a symbol intended to refer the reader to the HC—or even double daggers. Ordinarily flexibility suggests that when in an editor's opinion such matters—although transcribable—are not worth recording as manuscript variants from a book-text, there can be no harm in ignoring them. For instance, even if MS had interlined &amp; he , nothing is lost if the Alterations entry reads 000.00 and he] interlined , or for MS sd. he one writes 000.00 said he] interlined , without the single-dagger prefix, the more so since the dagger would refer the reader to a non-existent entry in the HC. If the only variant between manuscript and book were this ampersand or abbreviation, it would seem to be equally superfluous to add the double dagger to 000.00 &amp; he] interlined , and the like, and a difficulty could arise only if the manuscript actually had another reading from the book. For instance, if the book read but it and the MS &amp; it , the entry ††000.00 &amp; it] interlined would be required. (Incidentally, all manuscript forms of the ampersand are most conveniently normalized to '&amp;'.) The situation may change in two other instances. In the first, what may be taken to be characteristic spellings of an author need emphasis since, in contrast to such abbreviations as the ampersand and sd. , these would be listed (if rejected) in a full-scale Historical Collation. For example, William James sporadically wrote such forms as publisht , but in contrast to some other of his 'spelling-reform' words which he insisted be followed by the printer and would himself often alter in proof—such as tho and altho —he did not alter these manuscript forms in proof when they were not accepted by the compositor, and thus an editor may decide to follow the book copy-text and not emend from the manuscript. In such cases, it would seem necessary to warn of the manuscript form by a dagger referring to the HC when words like these are involved in alterations: †000.00 contains . . . course] above deleted 'holds itself ordinarily' if the book had read contains published material that in the normal course and MS in the interlineation had contains publisht material that in the normal course . Correspondingly, if the variant had been book accomplished but MS accomplisht as a simple interlineation, the necessary entry would be ††000.00 accomplisht] interlined . Second, when the manuscript is being quoted in a description to the right of the bracket, obviously its exact forms must be followed: 000.00 terminal] after deleted '&amp; the'. It goes without saying that when keying to the book-text is the only question, it is better to write: 000.00 but he] after deleted 'a great deal' than ††000.00 accomplisht] before deleted 'a great deal'. Obviously, the two readings should be so similar that a person following the Alterations list in the book-text will be able to identify with certainty the reading that is intended. The simplest and most efficient use of this convention comes when only a single word or identical phrase is being noted but some accidental variant exists between the manuscript and book (the bracketed information in the examples below is not part of the apparatus but instead simply explains the situation): ††000.00 shall ] above deleted 'does' [ book read 'shall' roman ] ††000.00 possesses] final 'es' added [ book read ' possesses ' italic ] ††147.37 &amp;c.rat;of course&amp;c.rat;] interlined [ book read ', of course,'] ††148.21 once equated&amp;c.rat;] above deleted 'of the same value' [ book read 'once equated,'] ††154.12 Brother] ('B' over 'b'); after deleted 'dear' [ book read 'brother'] ††156.9 truth, and any] comma before deleted period ; 'and any' above deleted 'Any' [ book read 'truth. Any'] Some of these examples are more useful than others, but all join in revealing instantly to the reader of the book-text the nature of the variant without recourse to the Historical Collation. In this respect it is simpler to write italic shall as the lemma when the reader will instantly recognize the MS variant from the book-text roman without referring him to the HC, as in: †000.00 shall ] above deleted 'does'. The normal entry 000.00 shall ] MS 'shall' above deleted 'does' is certainly acceptable but takes more space and, when reference is being made to the book-text, is no more informative than the double-dagger entry. If 154.12 were to be written with a single dagger, it might be possible at small expense of space to note †154.12 brother] MS 'B' over 'b' etc. (The single dagger here is not strictly necessary but would be helpful since Brother has not been quoted as a word.) The punctuation variants are much more economically listed with the double dagger than with the single, which forces the reader to the further step of consulting the HC, and they are certainly more economical when listed in this manner than a normal entry with repetitive quoting that pinpoints the variance. Similarly, the limited substantive variant at 156.9 would be difficult to write with a single dagger without expanded quoting. Another simple example comes at 148.31 where following a question mark the book conventionally writes the first word of the next sentence as Likewise but the MS, in a more old-fashioned way for the start of still another question, 11 has likewise , which is an addition. The condensed entry ††148.31 likewise] inserted after deleted 'And' should cause a reader no difficulty at all. How far to carry the convention of the double dagger beyond the relatively simple examples given is difficult to adjudicate, for its chief usefulness certainly depends upon its simplicity. Nothing much is gained if to enable a reader to compare the manuscript reading in the lemma with the book-text in order to understand the variant being listed, the lemma must be expanded beyond normal. For instance, it seems easiest to use the single dagger, as illustrated, at 146.5 where the variant in an interlineation was MS means but book-text is (as in: †146.5 proposition . . . the] above deleted 'idea is one whose') than ††146.5 proposition means one the] above deleted 'idea is one whose'. (Note that dots for space-saving cannot be used in double-dagger entries when the MS variant would be omitted by this device. The lemma must contain the variant.) Allied with this difficulty is a more serious matter when the manuscript alteration to be noted is only part of a larger variant between MS and book. For instance, at 157.19 the book reads, in italic, in case he existed , which is roman in MS, with roman in case interlined above deleted roman if . If in case had been the only variant between the two documents, the double-dagger convention would handle the situation admirably; but if one were to write for the actual example ††157.19 in case] above deleted 'if', a reader following the book-text might well be puzzled about the status of the remaining italic. It is true that he could ascertain the facts by reference to the HC; but since the reference would be required contrary to the purpose of the double dagger, it may be thought simpler to refer to the HC for the whole entry by the single-dagger entry: †157.19 in case ] above deleted 'if'. If the lemma is short, a moderate expansion required by the double dagger may still create the most efficient entry. At 148.32 the book reads in italic nicht wahr followed by a comma and roman etc., etc. In the manuscript the German words are in roman and by an alteration the original comma has been changed to a question mark and following etc., etc, deleted. If the entry were only 148.32 wahr] before question mark over comma and deleted 'etc., etc,', the problem of book italic nicht would remain, as in the example above at 157.19. But rather than solve the problem by the use of a single-dagger entry requiring consultation of the HC, it is perfectly simple to use the lemma ††148.32 nicht wahr] and one's troubles are over. So long as the reader can easily identify the manuscript variant by comparing the double-daggered lemma against the book-text, uncomplicated variants can be noted. At 147.27 the book-text has reader but the manuscript reader himself inserted as an interlineation that is part of a larger variant. The single-dagger convention cannot handle this situation, but the double-dagger entry is efficient: ††147.27 reader himself] interlined . A normal entry is also acceptable though longer: 147.27 reader] MS 'reader himself' interlined . Another example is book prove the but MS interlined prove his , readily handled as: ††148.12 prove his] above deleted 'clinch the'. A borderline case where the altered word in MS is part of a more extensive variant is illustrated by 146.8-10 where the book reads an obvious absurdity, for that fact is the deliverance of a new proposition whereas for the whole passage MS has only which obviously is quite a new proposition . The MS alteration of obviously from original notoriously must be listed. Because of the peculiar nature of James's alteration, the description is a bit complex, but if we chose the generalized form of entry, one could read, normally: 146.9 obvious] MS 'obviously' revised from 'notoriously'. The need to quote would be removed, however, by the alternative: †† 146.9 obviously] revised from 'notoriously'. This use of the double dagger violates the general understanding that its main purpose is to save the reader consultation of the Historical Collation; but since with either entry the reader cannot understand the alteration without seeing what the entire MS reading was as recorded in the HC, the convention of the double dagger here would seem to be fairly acceptable, although—to preserve the principle of the self-explanatory lemma when the double dagger is employed—an editor might well prefer the normal quoted entry. Certainly, there are inherent dangers in straining this convention that permits the shortcut of the double dagger to indicate that the lemma is drawn from the manuscript instead of the book-text. Only when substituted words are so close that there is no strain, should an exception be made. In the discussion of the usefulness of the single-dagger entry, an example was drawn from 158.4-5 in which the book-text read distinct from either the fact or and an MS interlineation different from either the event or . Because of the double variant distinct . . . fact and different . . . event the convention of the double dagger cannot be employed without a too lengthy lemma; but if MS had actually varied only in different for book distinct, then the doubledagger entry might well have been used since the reader would have had no difficulty in identifying in the book-text the interlined phrase of the manuscript and so could have been made aware of the alteration and its variant without referring to the HC: ††158.4-5 different . . . or] above deleted 'only another name for'; 'either' inserted . However, in the actual case, because of the presence of the added variant in MS event , this entry must not be utilized. Alterations in manuscripts resolve themselves into only a few general categories: (1)Simple insertions; (2)Simple deletions; (3)Insertions accompanied by deletions; and (4) Alterations made by superimposing other letters or words. (1) Simple Insertion. The purpose of an insertion is to add material not present in the original inscription, either during the course of composition or on review. Wherever possible, authors generally interline such additions, with or without a caret or guideline. If the editor always specifies the use of a caret, 12 the reader has a guarantee that the position of the interlineation has been fixed by the author and has not been subject to editorial interpretation; thus it may be that an editor will wish to distinguish those interlineations authorially marked by a caret from those that are unmarked. habit] interlined with a caret habit] interl. w. caret habit] interlined habit] interl. Abbreviations of the sort illustrated are necessary to conserve space and may be used so long as they do not proliferate past the point of easy recognition of their meaning. Readers ought not to be forced to memorize more than a few conventions to be able to use an apparatus freely. On the other hand, experience suggests that there is seldom any significance in whether or not a caret has been marked. In theory a writer might more frequently omit a caret (or add one) depending upon whether he were interlining during the course of composition or revising on review—in which rare case an editor should observe the distinction—but otherwise when the positions of interlineations are not subject to dispute, perhaps the specification may be thought not worth the space; hence if an editor chooses ultimate condensation, all mention of carets or guidelines may be dispensed with except when the editor thinks the information useful, as when a caret has been moved to another place, or has been misplaced, or a guideline has been extended to accommodate an addition, or a caret has intentionally deleted some mark of punctuation. If carets are not to be noted except in special cases, a general statement to the effect should be made. Not all insertions are interlined. William James, for example, often added a word or more in the left margin before the word to follow instead of interlining the insertion at the end of the line above after the immediately preceding word. If there were no room for an interlineation on the last line of a page, he might place the addition below the line in the bottom margin, or tailspace. Unless a specific value exists in noting the exact position of such additions that are not simple interlineations, there seems to be little point in specifying marginal addition (except for footnotes or sidenotes or lengthy passages) whether to the left or the right of the line, so long as the position in the text is not in question; and the same with additions placed below a line—especially since a reader has no ready way of knowing the lineation of the manuscript that produced the divergences. They are best lumped, then, under the general head of insertions , although additions is as acceptable: either word—like interlineation —signifies that the item was not written currently with the text on the line. Additions may be made in manuscript to simple insertions with or without guidelines. When a guideline is extended, the evidence can be described: very great] 'great' interl. w. caret and guideline extended to included added 'very'. However, since the fact of addition is the only important one, a condensed form without evidence can be written: very great] interl. ; 'very' added . Note: There should be no need to write: very great] 'great' interl. ; 'very' added (or) 'great' interl. ; interl. 'very' added (or) 'great' interl. ; preceded by interl. added 'very'. In formulaic terms (described below) one could write: very great] 'very [ added ] great' interl . Sometimes this formulaic method is useful, and it should always be kept in mind as a possibility, but in the present case it saves no space and is not greatly superior in clarity to the recommended entry. In this entry in the text one should notice that the word interl. necessarily applies to the whole lemma and cannot be associated only with great or with very as separate entities. For the font of punctuation in these entries, see note on p. 246. Other forms of insertions may be noted as: naturally] final 'ly' interl . nothing&amp;c.rat;] comma inserted these] final 'se' added nothing&amp;c.rat;] comma inserted after MS 'naught' Note: By using the common convention of the inferior caret to emphasize the lack of punctuation in the copy-text, the fact that the inserted comma noted in MS is a variant is perfectly clear and its position is established without ambiguity, although if one preferred one could write: MS comma inserted . (No need exists here to complicate matters by the convention of the single dagger: †000.00 nothing&amp;c.rat;] comma inserted , but the double dagger would be acceptable: ††000.00 nothing,] comma inserted .) On the other hand, if the word as well as the punctuation had been variant, it would be economical to write: †000.00 nothing&amp;c.rat;] comma inserted instead of quoting MS naught as in the examples in this series, although again ††000.00 naught,] comma inserted is a possibility owing to the closeness of MS naught to book-text nothing . (2) Simple Deletion. Simple deletion is an excision made currently before inscribing the next word, or in some cases it is deletion of an excess word made at a later time, or the alteration of one form of a word to another by deletion. Sometimes the difference in time may be established by the use of another medium, like pencil in an ink text; but if the ink is like that of the text, often no positive evidence can exist unless the nature of the alteration reveals that it must have been performed currently. simple] deleted is&amp;c.rat;] comma deleted be] preceded by del. 'pr' may] followed by del. 'pr' in] foll. by del. 'ha' natural] final 'ly' del . 13 natural] initial 'un' del. a hurry] prec. by del. 'ha' The terms followed by and preceded by (with their abbreviations) are perhaps the most precise one can employ. The simpler follows or precedes in their full form are equally precise but could be ambiguous if abbreviated, especially since in a description it may be necessary to write phrases like following comma deleted . Thus the best alternatives to preceded by and followed by are the words before and after , which could be further reduced to bef. and aft . These may well be adopted as the preferred forms. in] before deleted 'ha' in] before del. 'ha' in] bef. del. 'ha' a hurry] after deleted 'ha' a hurry] after del. 'ha' a hurry] aft. del. 'ha' An editor is advised to select one set of terms capable of serving all purposes and to use them exclusively (except in cases of real ambiguity); random variation has no intrinsic value and could be confusing to a reader who might suspect a different meaning when none exists. Deleted false starts are as important to record as complete words, especially when a change of intention is shown. 000.00 great] aft. del. 've' 000.00 end] aft. del. 'concl' 000.00 very] aft. del. 'gr' 000.00 usual] aft. del. 'cust' Unless there is contrary specification, two adjacent deletions are to be assumed as made at the same time, since independent deletion at different times shows a change of intention: 000.00 decision] aft. del. 'very great' (but) 000.00 decision] aft. indep. del. 'very great' (or) aft. indep. del. 'very' and 'great' However, reference to another formula in the section on descriptive transcription will illustrate what may be the better method in cases of ambiguity bearing on the order of deletion. Although there is none here, one could write: 000.00 decision] aft. del. '['very' del. ] great' If great had been excised earlier than very , the formula would be: 000.00 decision] aft. del. 'very ['great' del. ]' Either by reason of a change in the medium or of a different system of deleting strokes, the fact that separate deletion has occurred at different times can sometimes be determined. If the case is ambiguous, no indication need be given, or the queried statement can be made: decision] aft. 'very great' indep. (?) del. Sometimes a false start will be deleted but its substitute also deleted. That the odds so strongly favor each to have been independently excised makes it needless to state the fact: 000.00 decision] aft. del. 've great'. When a reading is quoted in the description to the right of the bracket, absolute clarity is gained only by enclosing the reading in single quotation marks, the standard bibliographical means for denoting exact quotation. (Double quotes are less exact in their common usage.) The device of italicizing all descriptive words also serves to bring the quoted reading into relief. If it were not for punctuation concluding or beginning a quoted reading, the roman type without quotes might serve as a sufficient distinction from this italic description; but the more complicated descriptions of alterations in which the description must use its own punctuation become thoroughly ambiguous as to whether the punctuation is part of the reading or of the description. Hence experience dictates, unfortunately, the invariable enclosure of all quoted readings within single quotation marks. Single quotation marks in the text within the quoting marks are kept as single since the quotation must be exact. (3) Insertions Accompanied by Deletions. Complex insertions and deletions may take a number of forms and offer a series of problems. The basic formula covers the usual case of the deletion of a reading and the interlined (or added) substitution of another. 146.3 hit] above del. 'place himself at' The word above must always mean 'in a position higher than', in short, an interlineation; thus there is no need to specify interlined above when there is also deletion. 000.00 points] 's' del. then interl . (or, better) 's' above del. 's' 14 000.00 change,] comma aft. del. period 15 An interlineation may itself be deleted in whole or in part, in which case the formulas must be constructed with particular care to avoid ambiguity while achieving economy. For example, 146.8 be in] bef. del. interl. 'the truth of' requires the reader to understand that be in only keys the position in the text of the deleted simple interlineation the truth of and is itself on the line and no part of the alteration. If the whole phrase be in the truth of had been a deleted interlineation that had not acted as an originally intended substitute for some deleted text, then a suitable key in the text needs to be found to position the deletion: To] bef. del. interl. 'be in the truth of'. On the contrary, if be in is itself part of an interlined alteration not wholly deleted, two distinguishing entries may be written to cover the different circumstances: 000.00 be in] interl. bef. del. interl. 'the truth of' 000.00 be in] interl. 'be in ['the truth of' del. ]' By its terms the first entry indicates that there have been two interlineations: first the truth of and then its deletion when 'be in' was inserted before it on the interline as a substitute. That be in was not part of the original interlineation may sometimes be determined by the context, by an extension of a guideline-caret to include it, by evidence that it was squeezed in or not normally written, or by its inscription in a different medium. 16 The specification that both parts of the described alteration were interlined is necessary to emphasize the distinction between the time of their inscription and to avoid ambiguity. The second entry solves a nasty problem by the use of a special transcriptional formula that will be described later under problems of transcription. With no ambiguity it describes the interlineation of the complete phrase be in the truth of and then the deletion of the truth of . No unambiguous alternative to this formula is available without a lengthy descriptive entry. The problem is the same whether the undeleted part of the interlineation precedes or follows the deleted section: 146.18 on occasion] interl. aft. del. interl. 'often' 000.00 on occasion] interl. '['often' del. ] on occasion' 000.00 it . . . proved] interl. '[often' del. ] it can be proved ['on occasion' del. ]' 000.00 it . . . proved] interl. '['often' del. ] *it can be proved [ ab. del. 'on occasion']' In the first, on occasion is a later substitute following deleted often ; in the second the original interlineation was often on occasion in which often was then deleted; in the third the original interlineation was often it can be proved on occasion , deleted except for it can be proved ; in the fourth the original interlineation was often on occasion , which was deleted as a whole or in two sections at different times (such a matter is not always to be determined) and it can be proved interlined above the interlineation. If evidence were available for separate deletion, the formula could read: interl. '['often' indep. del. ] *it can be proved [ ab. del. 'on occasion']', etc. Other typical problems arise: 146.6 assumes us] 'for instance' first interl. w. caret after 'us', then moved by guideline to bef. 'assumes', and then del. 17 146.4 When . . . we] 'When we' ab. del. 'If we'; then 'we' del. and ', for instance, we' added 000.00 cities] follows del. 'great' ab. del. 'grand' 000.00 cities] interl. aft. del. 'great' ab. del. 'grand' Note: In the first cities entry the lemma is only the key to the positioning of the interlineation before it. In the second, the description means quite definitely that cities is itself interlined following interlined great , which is a substitute for deleted original grand written on the line. In both entries one should note that the syntax requires great to be interlined above deleted grand , and there is no need to waste space by writing aft. del. 'great' which is above del. 'grand'. If the text had read great , which was then deleted currente calamo and grand then inscribed on the line but deleted and cities interlined above it, a choice of entries would result, the best of which is the descriptive-transcription method: cities] ab. del. '['great' del. ] grand '. A pure descriptive entry could read: cities] ab. del. 'grand' aft. del. 'great' (or) ab. indepen. del. 'great' and 'grand'. If cities itself were the interlineation, it must be used as the lemma; but if it is only the positioning word for the respective deletion of grand and great , and if it seems to the editor that an entry using it might be slightly ambiguous, the preceding word can be used instead as the key: some] before deleted 'great' above deleted 'grand', the description abbreviated, of course. Interlineations with substituted additions to replace deletions are readily handled as above. However, a problem in compression arises when the deletion, or the deletion and substitution, is within the interlineation. In the first example, not as the was interlined but then as deleted. This can be handled in several ways: 000.00 not the] interl. ; 'as' del. bef. 'the' *000.00 not the] 'not ['as' del. ] the' interl. A bold use of the double dagger (to be employed with discretion) would permit such an economical entry as: ††000.00 not ['as' del. ] the] interl. Internal brackets of this nature should be set in a smaller size. Some complexity is introduced when the interlineation is a substitute for a deleted reading: 000.00 not the] ab. del. 'success'; 'as' del. bef. 'the' 000.00 not the] 'not ['as' del. ] the' ab. del. 'success' ††000.00 not ['as'] the] ab. del. 'success' If one supposes that not the is interlined, but as has been added by further interlineation, we have: *000.00 not as the] ab. del. 'success'; 'as' interl. 000.00 not as the] 'not *as [ interl. ] the' ab. del. 'success' 000.00 not *as [ interl. ] the] ab. del. 'success' Note: It is an open question whether the lemma in the last entry, which illustrates the bold inclusion of part of the alteration (distinguished by small brackets), should or should not have a double dagger. If an editor wished to mark off this unusual but sometimes convenient form of lemma by a double dagger, no harm would be done; but logically since the final form of the manuscript text used as lemma agrees with that of the book text, the double dagger would seem to be superfluous. Most editors, however, may prefer the safety of the double dagger. Further changes can be rung if the interlined as was later deleted: 000.00 not the] ab. del. 'success'; 'as' interl. but del. bef. 'the' *000.00 not the] 'not [ del. interl. 'as'] the' ab. del. 'success' 000.00 not [ del. interl. 'as'] the] ob. del. 'success' It is sometimes clearer and more economical to associate consequential changes, as in 281.20 would] interl. bef. 'seem' ( final 's' del. ) (or) interl. bef. 'seem' with final 's' del. than to make two entries, as 281.20 would] interl. 281.20 seem] final 's' del. (or) alt. fr. 'seems' Note: The first entry illustrates that not all of a manuscript alteration need compose the lemma when direct reference can be made to the book-text. If seem had been a part of the lemma, the description would need to be lengthened to distinguish the alterations of the two words by quoting each: would seem] 'would' intrl. ; 'seem' ( final 's' del. ). One should note, of course, that in this alteration seem is a part of the original inscription on the line, and only would is interlined. If both had been interlined the lemma would need to have given them both: would seem] intrl. ; 'seem' ( final 's' del. ). On the other hand, if an editor prefers two entries, he may find that in double-column apparatus two lines would be needed in any event by the combined entry and that two condensed separate entries may require fewer ens of typesetting. Sometimes it is worth counting off the length of an entry before deciding on its form. Two entries, as in those above, may prove to be acceptable, if not preferable. Not all complex changes can be broken down into a number of single entries, however. In the next example, several stages of revision appear. What happened is this. James first wrote different from from (by dittography between lines) the one originally believed in, and is an idea . . . . Perhaps the initial revision was to delete in and its comma and to insert a comma after believed . At some point he then deleted originally believed and interlined whose truth is in question as a substitute. Then he deleted different and interlined idea , but deleted it and interlined before it a new proposition . Later he added a comma after proposition and deleted from from the one whose truth is in question, and is an idea , interlining one above the deleted final idea . Last, he appears to have deleted this one and interlined and one . The final reading was a new proposition, and one . In some respects a formulaic approach to this problem would be the best one to adopt (see below) but in descriptive terms, although lengthy, an editor might write the entry: 146.9-10 a new proposition,] interl. before del. 'idea' above del. 'different'; following 'from | from the one whose truth is in question and is an idea' del. ['whose . . . question' above del. 'originally believed,' alt. from 'believed in,']; 'and one' before del. interl. 'one' above final del. 'an idea' How far to expand an entry by a true chronological description, and how far to require a reader to reconstruct the sequence from the facts themselves, is not always an easy question to answer. In the following passage James first wrote: The great shifting of universes in this discussion comes from making the word truth . . . . His first revision was to delete comes from and to interline is the , accompanied by the deletion of making and the interlineation of carrying . He then deleted is the and prefixed to it interlined occurs when we , at the same time deleting the ing of carrying . The revised text was, The great shifting of universes in this discussion occurs when we carry the word truth . . . . A chronologically contrived entry could read: 151.6-7 occurs . . . carry] MS first read 'comes from making'; 'is the' above del. 'comes from'; 'carrying' above del. 'making'; 'occurs when we' interl. before del. 'is the' and 'ing' of 'carrying' del. A more concise note, merely listing the facts, might read: 151.6-7 occurs . . . carry] 'occurs when we' inserted before del. interl. 'is the' above del. 'comes from'; 'carry' ( final 'ing' del. ) above del. 'making' The condensation of the lemma in a case like this would seem to be sufficiently clear when the entry is read against the text; since the main purpose of the lemma is to accompany the page-line reference for identification of that part of the text being noted, there would seem to be sufficient justification to remove the repetitive quoting of text in the description. (For a truly formulaic approach to this entry, see the description of the folio at the end of this paper.) (4) Alterations by Superimposition. Frequently an author may start to write one word and then change his mind. Sometimes he merely deletes the false start and continues on the line with the different word, but sometimes he may choose merely to write the new word over the letters of the false start. Changes of mind like this—whether occurring during composition or in later revision—must be recorded, for often an acute critic can guess from the context what the original word would have been if it had been completed, and more information is gained about the author's style. In the description the word over means, literally, this superimposition and it must always be distinguished from above which describes an interlineation. True revisions of this nature are to be distinguished from mere mendings in which a writer touches up an ill-formed letter for clarity—these are not worth recording. 18 Allied to such mendings as not worth recording are the repairs of inadvertent slips, such as letters transposed in haste or an anticipated letter written too soon, or occasionally what may be a genuine but inadvertent misspelling. Mechanical slips created during the haste of composition add little or nothing to a critical view of an author, and their value would seem to be nil. When a repaired genuine misspelling can be distinguished from a slip, it may be thought of sufficient interest to record. Discretion is needed, of course, even at the expense of uniformity of procedure. For example, if one's author is a notably good speller but he hastily writes ocult and then squeezes in the second c , the expense of noting the slip is wasted effort. On the other hand, if occasionally he shows a little weakness about the ei and ie words, and writes reciept , only to alter it by ei over ie , an editor may choose to record the fact. But suppose a good speller starts to write propi , stops, alters the i to o , and then continues sition , the odds favor not a misspelling but a mind outrunning the pen. The value of such information, given the expense of notation, cannot ordinarily be justified. However, an editor needs to be on the watch for alterations of letters that probably mean a change to a different form of the word. For instance, if the manuscript reads dialectic with the penultimate i written over an a , the probability that dialectal had at one moment been in the author's mind is sufficiently strong to merit the entry: dialectic] second 'i' over 'a'. An editor seeking some rule of thumb might propose to ignore mended slips of non-words or impossible spellings, but if an actual word has been originally formed, he might decide to record its alteration in order to prevent any mistake in editorial judgment from concealing what might have been momentarily an authorial intention. Moreover, special reasons may attend more scrupulous than usual notation. Note: For instance, at 115.23 of The O'Ruddy Stephen Crane inadvertently wrote firsts but corrected it to fists by deleting the r . On its own merits this slip is not worth attention since firsts made no sense in context and could never have been written intentionally. Moreover, if the slip had been caught at the moment of writing and Crane had inscribed t over the r before he formed the final s , an entry would doubtless have been wasted on trivia. As it stands, however, the mending at a later time becomes part of a small body of evidence that bears on the question of Crane's care in working over this manuscript, a matter of considerable critical importance. On these terms it deserves an entry, for its import is far greater than a simple case of carelessness in inscribing a memorial error without immediate correction. Typical entries for revision and correction are: explanation] first 'n' over 'i' clearness] 'c' over 'g' hole] 'ho' over 'sa' truth] 't' over 'T' True] 'T' over 't' Dr.] 'D' over 'M' In the first column the examples represent either obscure slips or else the start of words that may be guessed at but not demonstrated; hence they would not be subject to the formula altered from . In the second column an editor if he chose could write, for instance: Dr.] alt. fr. 'Mr.', and so with: True] alt. fr. 'true'. It would seem that an editor need not be consistent but could choose whichever form seemed to him either immediately clearer or else more economical: the exact method by which the alteration was accomplished is of little specific interest here. 'true'] single quotes over double (or) sg. qts. ov. db. (or) alt. fr. '"true"' mine?] question over exclamation mark (or) quest. ov. exclam. (or) query over exclamation 19 Some superimposition revisions occur in connection with other alterations: take] ab. del. 'hear'; 'e' over 'en' *take] ('e' over 'en'); ab. del. 'hear' The first entry illustrates a good general rule that the position of the word specified by the lemma may seem more important than alterations in its form and should ordinarily come first. However, another method for writing the same information might be: take] alt. fr. 'taken' ab. del. 'hear', which is only slightly longer. It would be possible, of course, to write: take] ab. del. 'hear'; alt. fr. 'taken' but the form has less coherence than alt. fr. 'taken' ab. del. 'hear'. When only a single lemma word is being noted, even though two alterations are described there is seldom ambiguity no matter which form (as above) is chosen. Problems begin to arise when the lemma must be two or more words. For instance, the following entry is improper because its note of the alteration could apply either to 'take' or to 'take in': take in] ab. del. 'hear'; alt. fr. 'taken'. The expansion created by quoting would solve the ambiguity, of course: take in] ab. del. 'hear'; 'e' of 'take' over 'en' (or) 'take' alt. fr. 'taken', (or, in this case) *take in] ('e' over 'n'); ab. del. 'hear'. [If the alteration had been in hear one could write, take in] ab. del. 'hear' ('e' over 'a').] Indeed, quoting is necessary only to refer to a specific word in a lengthy lemma, or to a lemma that does not list the altered word, or to a lemma which has more than one example of the altered letter: take in more] ab. del. 'hear greater'; 'take' alt. fr. 'taken' (or) 'e' of 'take' over 'en' (or) we . . . sense] ab. del. 'we derive more meaning'; 'e' of 'take' over 'en'. In the first case, the bold use of the double dagger, if favored, would condense the entry: ††000.00 take ['e' ov. 'en'] in more] abov. del. 'hear'. Psychologically, the deeper the information of a letter alteration within the description, the more annoying it is for a reader to refer back to the lemma when the word is not quoted, and thus a clash may result with the general principle of the usefulness of providing the information about position first: take in difficult] ab. del. 'distinguish more complex'; 'e' ov. en'. One way of getting around this difficulty, without quoting, is to place the alteration of the letters first but with a special sign that indicates that the usual order has been broken: take in difficult] ('e' over 'en'); ab. del. 'distinguish more complex'. Although this parenthesis is more useful for lemmas of two or more words than for a single word, an editor alert to any possible misunderstanding of his meaning can employ it flexibly. For instance, he might feel that: take] ab. del. 'know'; 'e' ov. 'en' could scarcely be misread, whereas: take] ab. del. 'hear'; 'e' ov. 'en', despite the semicolon, could trouble a reader whether take or hear were in question, and hence that: take] ('e' ov. 'en'); ab. del. 'hear' closes all possible avenues for error. On the whole, it may be thought that, without quoting, the use of parentheses in this manner coming before the position provides the happiest solution. Without quoting, unless the description is so long as to puzzle a reader about the quoted word when he finally comes to it, priority may ordinarily be given to position. Alternate forms would be: When] aft. del. 'Even'; bef. del. 'the'; 'W' over 'w' When] ( alt. fr. 'when'); aft. del. 'Even'; bef. del. 'the' *When] ('W' over 'w'); aft. del. 'Even'; bef. del. 'the' When we meditate] ab. del. 'As we think'; 'W' of 'when' over 'I' *When we meditate] ('W' over 'I'); ab. del. 'As we think' In some forms of entries the use of altered from may condense the description when the exact means of alteration is of no significance. *is. Each] alt. fr. 'is, each' is. Each] ('E' over 'e'); period aft. del. comma is. Each] period aft. del. comma ; 'E' over 'e' Note: This is as good a place as any to discuss the font of the punctuation to be used in descriptions to the right of the bracket. As has already been remarked, one often encounters at the present day the printer's convention that the font of punctuation should agree with the font of the preceding word, as in aft. del. comma; when the font of the next word changes. This arbitrary and illogical convention is completely unsuited not only for descriptive bibliography (where it would create the utmost confusion) but also for all general scholarly writing, where clarity and precision demand the choice of the font for punctuation on purely syntactical, not on supposedly aesthetic, grounds. To repeat, a crucial distinction of meaning results from the correct use of the sentence's syntactical roman punctuation in such an example as, 'James generally insists in his books on the spellings tho , altho , and connexion ; but he is content to pass the printer's photograph for his manuscript spelling-reform fotograf , and alphabet for alfabet .' On the other hand, when the punctuation is syntactically part of an italic passage, it must also be in italic: 'James writes as follows: Suppose, to fix our ideas, that we take first a case of conceptual knowledge; and let it be our knowledge of the tigers in India, as we sit here .' In writing descriptive apparatus entries, it is of more than minor importance to adopt the same syntactical logic. Theoretically it should make no difference whether an editor chose to consider the italic description to the right of the bracket as the major syntactical font, or the roman of the usual quotations, in which case the italic would be considered to be only a distinguishing device and thus secondary to the roman font. Perhaps no distress may be felt in typography like: period aft. del. comma; 'E' over 'e'; but this is inconsistent in its roman quotation marks as well as in the roman semicolon, and true syntactical consistency would require an entry like: ('E' over 'e') ; period aft. del. comma (or) ab. del. 'As we think' ; 'W' of 'when' over 'I', in which all parentheses and quotation marks would need to be in italic as well as commas and semicolons. The effect is not pleasing; more important, the marking of copy for the printer would need to be scrupulous and infinitely detailed, and the proofreading and resulting correction of the printer's inevitable mistakes would be expensive. In the edition of William James it eventually proved a practical necessity to adopt the principle of roman syntactical punctuation in all the apparatus and to forsake the difficulties (and indeed the partial inconsistencies) that resulted from an attempt at the opposite in the Stephen Crane edition. Copy must still be carefully marked to emphasize to a printer that he must not ordinarily follow an italic word with italic punctuation both in the text and in the apparatus. In the examples in this article, it will be observed, parentheses, square brackets, quotation marks, commas, and semicolons not part of an italic quotation are invariably printed in roman. This assumes that the major font of the apparatus is invariably roman. It is the normal interpretation of the above that the change was not made during the original inscription but as an afterthought, and so with: What] 'W' over 'We', 'hat' interl . 20 On the contrary, an entry using altered from would in this case be ambiguous whether the change were made currently or on review: What] alt. fr. 'We'. The compression of the latter must be balanced against the value of the information of the precise description. One must also consider that not all precise descriptions do in fact distinguish the time of alteration. The following entry could represent a change made during inscription or on review: What] 'Wh' over 'We' (which could be further condensed under the circumstances to: What] over 'We'). If an editor felt the distinction were important, he could always expand: What] 'Wh' over 'We', 'at' squeezed in (or the reverse: 'What' currently over 'We'). In the examples so far, the alteration of letters by superimposition has affected words in the lemma that constitute a unit of description. Sometimes alteration of letters in one word can be combined with changes that need recording in an adjacent word or words; but in such cases the problems of position versus clarity may be intensified. For instance, the question of distance arises in such an entry as: When we discover] 'discover' ab. del. 'find'; 'W' over 'w', which can be solved by quoting: 'discover' ab. del. 'find'; 'W' of 'When' over 'w' (or) by the parenthesis: *('W' over 'w'); 'discover' ab. del. 'find'. On the other hand, since in double-column typesetting two lines would need to be devoted to this combined description, the question arises whether in the long run the reader is not better served by two brief separate entries, also taking up two lines: When] 'W' over 'w' discover] ab. del. 'find'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Descriptive Transcription The transcription of a manuscript may be required: first, in an edition of a manuscript in which the editor wishes to present what has been called a 'genetic' text; that is, one that by a special construction provides within the text itself all the evidence for its growth and thus is without an apparatus; second, within an apparatus itself when another document provides the copy-text but an unreproduced underlying manuscript must be reconstructed by reference to the Historical Collation and a special list of Alterations in the Manuscript. In this second connection two main uses appear: (a) to transcribe passages of deleted or of variant matter of some length as part of an Alterations entry or else in a separate section of the apparatus devoted to transcripts of all deleted draft leaves and extraneous matter; (b) to solve the problem of a more condensed form of description in a complex regular entry than can be managed by the usual verbal description. Heretofore, 'genetic' texts have been produced by transcribing the original form of the manuscript and then indicating the series of its revisions directly after the revised word(s) by means of a number of arbitrary symbols like pointed brackets to the left or right, arrows, bars, and so on. This method was brought to a high state of refinement by the publication in 1962 of Melville's Billy Budd , edited by Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr., which has since served as a general model for other manuscript texts. Despite the maximum compression gained by these symbols, the form of transcription is subject to certain difficulties: the symbols take considerable acquaintance before they can be read with any sort of ease and understanding, and this difficulty is compounded by the lack of any agreed standard for the use of these symbols; as a result, each subsequently edited manuscript has introduced different purposes for the same marks and freshly minted symbols preferred by its editor in an attempt at improvement on his predecessors, much to the confusion of the reader. Moreover, a genetic text of this sort cannot be read with ease (the difficulty of symbols apart), principally because the basic transcript is by necessity of the original unrevised inscription; hence the successive revisions that form the final text are encountered only as one plunges deep into the thicket of the arbitrary markings. It is difficult to read the original text consecutively; it is impossible to read the revised text at all in a coherent sequence. As a consequence, the editors of Billy Budd found it necessary to accompany the genetic reference text with a reading text that presented in usable form the finally revised version. A genetic text, in short, cannot be a reading edition except of a very lightly revised manuscript. It follows that an editor must make the basic decision, often, whether as in a genetic text his edition will be confined to the status of a reference work on which other editions will be built, or whether he will edit a reading text of the finally revised manuscript and in an apparatus detail by description and quoting, as necessary, the development of the final text from its original form. Since in either case a reader must work hard to reconstruct the other form, the matter may boil down to the general usefulness of having to hand the final revised text and to labor over the original, or vice versa. For the purposes of the present paper, however, the problem centers chiefly on the method of transcription to employ when a manuscript must be reconstructed from the apparatus in cases where extensive transcription of rejected text or of text in the process of revision is required. (Also in question is the method for transcribing, apart from the Alterations apparatus, deleted or discarded trials, drafts, and the like, that may accompany the final manuscript text.) Note: Among the practical inconveniences of apparatus is the primary fact that prose text requires temporary page-line keying in one's typed copy until the text is available in page proofs, to which final reference must then be made by altering the original keying in the copy of the apparatus to go to the printer. Since the text and apparatus must thus be set in two different operations, the consequent delay slows production and adds somewhat to the costs. The problem is intensified, and costs rise, if appendixes after the main apparatus must have their own apparatus, in which case all appendixes following the first with apparatus cannot be typeset directly into page proof (or paged from galleys) until the first apparatus has itself been keyed and paged. Delay ensues since the appendix page-line apparatus must be set later after the edition's appendix text page-line references can be determined. Brief appendix texts can use apparatus keyed to superscript numbers or letters in the text which can be set at the same time like footnotes. For longer texts which must be readable but which act chiefly as reference material, the descriptive transcription suggested here becomes a useful tool. The methodology of transcription does not differ in the system here proposed, no matter to what purpose it may be put, however: it is the same whether it is utilized for condensing an entry in an ordinary descriptive list of Alterations or for transcribing a revised document for reading and reference. In the latter case it may often serve as an acceptable compromise between a reading and a reference text. The central feature of the system is that it transcribes the finally revised form of the text and within brackets placed after the appropriate words describes the changes made in this text from the original inscription. (The method of this description agrees with that illustrated above for use in an apparatus list of Alterations.) In a genetic text with arbitrary symbols one is forced to transcribe the original version since the symbols must be placed immediately after the word affected by revision and such placement is possible only with the original word, to which the revisions may then be appended. In descriptive transcription the convention of the asterisk frees the transcript of this necessity and effectively delimits even a considerable area of final text to be described. For instance, as illustrated, the first page of the manuscript of Chapter XIV of William James's Meaning of Truth (1909) is transcribable as follows: Mr. Bertrand Russell's article, entitled Transatlantic Truth, x [ fn : 'x In the Albany Review for January, 1908.'] has *all [ intrl. ] the *clearness ['c' over 'g'], 21 dialectic subtlety, &amp; wit which *one ['o' over 'w'] expects from his pen, but ['he' del. ] entirely fails to *hit [ ab. del. 'place himself at'] the right point of view for apprehending *our [ ab. del. 'the pragmatist'] position. *When, ['we' del. ] for instance, we [ ab. del. 'If we'] say that a true *proposition means one the [ ab. del. 'idea is one whose'] consequences *of believing which [ intrl. ] are good, he [ intrl. 'for instance' moved fr. aft. 'us' and del. ] assumes us to mean that *anyone ['one' added ] ['concrete person' del. ] who ['belief' del. ] believes his *proposition [ ab. del. 'idea'] to be true must first have made out clearly that its consequences are good, and that his belief must *primarily [ intrl. ] be in ['the truth of' del. intrl. ] that [ del. '['idea' del. ] proposition,' ab. del. 'fact']—which *obviously ['obvious' ab. del. 'notorious' of 'notoriously'] is ['something *a [ intrl. ]' del. ] quite *a new proposition, ['idea' del. ] [ ab. del. 'different from | from the one **whose truth is in question' [ ab. del. 'originally believed, ['in,' del. ]']] *and one [ ab. del. 'and is an idea'] ['one' del. intrl. ] usually ['hard' del. ] very hard to verify, it *being [ ab. del. 'It is'] 'far easier,' as Mr. Russell *justly [ intrl. ] says, 'to This is complicated, but the revised text itself can be read simply by skipping all brackets; indeed, at some extra cost the legibility of the revised text could be increased by reducing the size of the type in all bracketed items, although this expedient might be imprudent in transcriptions within the apparatus list where ordinarily the type has been made as small as can be read without strain. Several points need comment. First, all text intervening between the asterisk and the applicable bracketed description is covered by the description. Bracketed entries containing quoted words, as in notation of deletions or interlinings, may intervene without ambiguity between the start of the asterisked text and the applicable description, as in: *When, ['we' del. ] for instance, we [ ab. del. 'If we']. If an editor feels uneasy, he might, as in this example, reduce the size of these intervening brackets as is done in bracketed entries within bracketed entries. Morever, an asterisked passage may itself have an internal asterisked entry (which should be double asterisked), in which case the first small-bracketed description to appear applies to the internal double asterisk (and so on) and the final full-bracketed description to the whole of the material present between it and the original single asterisk. No example occurs in the transcript, but if we hear you were interlined above a deletion and that then interlined after hear , the text would read: *we hear **that [ interl. ] you [ ab. del. 'it has come to our attention']. If, instead, that had been a part of the original interlineation but had been deleted, then no asterisk would be needed: *we hear ['that' del. ] you [ ab. del. 'it has come to our attention']. In the transcript an example does appear, however, of double asterisked words within a bracketed description to an asterisked passage: *a new proposition, ['idea' del. ] [ ab. del. 'different from | from the one **whose truth is in question' [ ab. del. 'originally believed, ['in,' del. ]']]. It will be remarked in this example that idea (deleted) was the original interlineation and that a new proposition is the revised interlineation. There should also be no difficulty in perceiving that in the first inscription the deleted reading was originally believed in , and that a comma was added after believed when in , was first deleted before the decision was made to revise the whole phrase. No asterisk is needed if the description applies only to a single word following a bracketed description, since ambiguity could not then be present: was [ interl .] he [ ab. del. 'she'] aware. Independently deleted words may be given separate brackets: this ['great' del. ] ['good' del. ] noble man. But, as in the transcript's independently deleted idea proposition , the two can be included in the same bracketed notice: this ['great' del. 'good' del. ] noble man (or in a descriptive entry): noble] aft. del. 'great ['good' del. ]' (or, in another situation): this *noble [ ab. del. 'great ['good' del. ]'] man. Note: The text formula ['great' del. 'good' del. ] is perhaps superfluously exact, but an ambiguity might exist for some readers in the compressed ['great' 'good' del. ] as to whether the two were independently excised, or even whether quotation marks had been around them in the original. This ambiguity should not exist, of course, because if both had been deleted at the same time, the entry would have read ['great good' del. ] and if both had had single quotes about them and been deleted at the same time the form would have been [''great' 'good'' del. ]. If the text formula is disliked, it would be quite possible to write: ['great' 'good' indep. del. ] and take one's chance on a misinterpretation of the quotation marks. An ambiguity still remains, however, in that a reader cannot be certain of the order of deletion. For instance, great could have been inscribed but immediately deleted before the inscription of its substitute good , which in turn was deleted before the finally satisfactory word noble was arrived at and only then was man inscribed. Or in different combinations great and good could have been written and either one deleted before the inscription of noble , the deletion of the odd one coming later, and so on. Some contexts like deleted idea proposition would not admit variant interpretation like this, of course, but the present example does. The intent of the second and third formulas in the text above is to suggest that good had been deleted earlier than great . If the contrary, the formulas would have read respectively: [ aft. del. '['great' del. ] good' (and) [ ab. del. ['great' del. ] good'], in which great is noted as first deleted. The case is exactly the same if the manuscript had originally read this noble man and great had first been interlined above deleted noble but then deleted and good added after it above the line, this good in turn being deleted so that the final text read this man . It would seem to be a sufficiently clear formula to write: this [ del. '['great' del. ] good' ab. del. 'noble'] man. If, on the contrary, good as a substitute for great had been added before it, the formula would be: this [ del. 'good ['great' del. ]' ab. del. 'noble'] man. On the other hand, since there could scarcely be ambiguity about the deletion of a false start before a word that was later itself deleted, no very useful purpose is served by marking them as separately deleted, and the simple form would appear to be acceptable: All *of life's [ ab. del. 'ro mental'] roads. Of course, if one wished to be scrupulous, one could write: All *of life's [ ab. del. 'ro' del. 'mental'] roads (or preferably) [ ab. del. '['ro' del. ] mental'] roads. As remarked, simple deletion is best handled by: is ['something' del. ]. But when description must be added which applies to the deletion, the simplest order is: is ['something' del. ] ['a' del. intrl. ]. Another sequence might be used to clue the reader in earlier on the position when the deletion is a long one, and thus to prepare him for the final notation of deletion: [ del. intrl. 'the four day working week has been tried in certain industries']. Preliminary warning is even more necessary in such cases as: [ del. intrl. 'the four day working week has been tried in certain industries' ab. del. 'various experiments to promote leisure have been tried'], which is clearer than [ intrl. 'the four day working week has been tried in certain industries' del. ab. del. 'various experiments to promote leisure have been tried'] and more satisfactory for indicating the position at the earliest moment than the conventional [ del. 'the four day working week has been tried in certain industries' ab. del. 'various experiments to promote leisure have been tried']. In an ordinary apparatus entry if the description quotes text that passes from one page to another, usually no purpose is served by noting the end of one page and the beginning of the next so long as the pages are in order: the reader has no opportunity to identify the page endings and beginnings in the edited text, anyway; thus in normal diplomatic transcripts (and always in edited text) no more significance inheres to passing from one page to another in the original document than from one line to the next. The case is altered, however, in the transcription in appendixes of discarded trials and the like, not as entries in the apparatus, or in the edition-text itself in a diplomatic transcript. Moreover, if the transcription in an apparatus entry continues not on the next page but on another that is not in order, although the text is continuous, notation of the difference in the page is necessary. When on folio 17 of the manuscript for Chapter XIV of The Meaning of Truth James deletes a sentence that begins on the last line and continues over onto folio 18, the distinction between the deleted text on the two pages is superfluous. However, deleted text at the foot of folio 4 is continuous with deleted text beginning folio 10 as a consequence of a major revision and expansion of the deleted material that takes up folios 5-9. It would be most unhelpful to a reader to stop the transcription in the apparatus of this deletion with the end of folio 4, continue with normal entries for a considerable amount of text on fols. 5-9, and then when folio 10 was reached begin the broken-off deleted text as a fresh entry. Obviously, the whole passage must be transcribed as a unit since it is continuous text, no matter how separated, but an indication must be made at the proper point that the deleted text jumps from folio 4 to 10. Note: Foliated manuscripts are numbered only on the recto of a leaf; paged manuscripts are numbered both on recto and on verso. (The abbreviations are respectively fol. and p. , with plurals fols. and pp. ) Hence folio rectos need to be distinguished from the versos in cases where writing is also present on the versos. By long custom it has been generally understood that when the folio number alone appears (as in fol. 5), the recto is meant in contrast to the verso, which is always specified ( fol. 5 v ). Recently some dissatisfaction has been expressed with the supposed lack of precision of this traditional loose system, since technically fol. 5 stands for the leaf (both recto and verso) and is often so used as in the paper of fol. 5 changes from wove to laid . (Similarly, sig. B3 stands for the third leaf in gathering B and not necessarily just for its recto.) Hence it has been urged that recto and verso should always be distinguished as fol. 5 r and fol. 5 v , not merely when the context might be ambiguous between 5 and 5 r as is often done. It was pointed out some years ago, however—as one of the reasons for using the superscript r sparingly—that in small type it is readily confused with superscript v . For this reason, some writers prefer to place the r and v (or the v alone) on the line, as in fol. 5 r and fol. 5 v . Lately the use of superscript a and b has been suggested to replace r and v and their confusion. In its favor is the fact that incunabulists are accustomed to such notation instead of r and v . On the other hand, this system cannot be recommended, for it conflicts with the post-incunabulist custom of distinguishing the columns of double-columned books as a and b . Thus sig. B3 ra and B3 rb (or B3ra and B3rb) would apply to the left and the right columns of a recto page and B3 va and B3 vb to the columns of a verso page. (Any attempt to label them B3 rl or B3 v2 introduces certain elements of ambiguity.) Since it is desirable that the notation for signatures and for manuscript folios should be identical (even though double-columned manuscripts after the early period are not common), it seems best to maintain the use of r and v without breaking sharply from the past (whatever its faults) with the inevitable confusion between two systems. Whether the writer prefers always to label the recto as fol. 5 r even if the verso is usually blank, or to retain the old system of fol. 5 and fol. 5 v (using 5 r when absolute precision is required by the context) is a matter of choice. Fol. 5 r-v specifies both pages of the leaf, of course. When the beginning of pages is being indicated within transcribed text, it is usually best to enclose the folio number for the new folio (or page) in square brackets after a vertical stroke at the point where the transition occurs: as Mr. Russell justly says, 'to | [ fol. 2] settle the plain question . . . . In the example mentioned of a skip, the transcript might read: He is a logician and a mathematician, accus-[ end fol. 4 | begin fol. 10]tomed to think in complicated chains of identities. (Broken words on either side of a stroke are set close up; separate words are spaced.) In transcribing a manuscript when a sentence begins a new folio, the bracketed folio number may be placed on a separate line and the vertical stroke at the end of the text of the preceding sentence and page. An attempt to set the brackets before the sentence could be ambiguous, whether or not a paragraph were also present. Space may be saved by including the folio number within the text itself and running it on: to settle the plain question. | [ fol. 92] This is a matter etc. If the text on the new folio begins with a paragraph, one may write in this form of continuous transcription: to settle the plain question. | [ fol. 92] [¶] This is a matter etc. However, when a page begins with a new paragraph, or with something not continuous, like another item in a list written in separate lines, it is consistent with the rest of the transcript if a new page is indicated visually by the setting of the bracketed folio number in a separate line, the text then continuing below it: to settle the plain question. | [ fol. 2] This is a matter . . . . The following items appear: | [ fol. 2] (1) A list of Emendations (2) A series of Textual Notes Of course, in transcription within an apparatus entry, the run-on notatation must be employed. Descriptive transcription of underlined (italic) passages should put the bracketed description in roman instead of the customary italic for differentiation: * of believing which [intrl.] are good he [intrl. ' for instance ' moved fr. aft. 'us' and del.] assumes us to mean . . . . Similarly, bracketed folio numbers intervening between italic text may be printed in roman. In the apparatus to a complicated revision, descriptive transcription is sometimes necessary to reproduce a revised passage that, say, has been deleted or is a substitute for a deletion. The simplest case is exemplified by lengthy deletions to shorten text, or deletions at the heads or feet of pages accompanying major revision. As a consequence of the rewriting of folio 5 by a substitute leaf in James's Chapter XIV, folio 6 begins with deleted text that has no antecedent. The record of this passage in the apparatus reads: 147.26 play] aft. del. '['or Mr. Hawtrey.' del. ] This is the usual slander repeated to satiety by our critics. ['But whereas' del. ] Using the word *'truth' [ ab. del. 'true'] absolutely (whereas in any discussion as to *truth's [ insrt. for del. 'its'] place in human ['human' del. ] life it can only be used relatively to some particular 'trower') they easily make out that.' Since this passage must appear in the apparatus, no separate listing of the variants can be managed, and descriptive transcription is a necessity. Descriptive transcription can also clarify as well as condense descriptive entries of revisions. In the transcript above of folio 1 of James's Chapter XIV, the book-text reads a new proposition, quite but the final MS text is quite a new proposition, . A combination of description and quoting could be contrived to deal with the complex revision: 146.9-10 a new . . . quite] (MS reads 'quite a new proposition,'); 'quite' aft. del. 'something *a [ intrl. ]; bef. del. intrl. 'idea' ab. del. 'different from | from the one *whose truth is in question' [ ab. del. 'originally believed, ['in,' del. ]'] and is but this compromise, useful as it sometimes is, in this case yields in clarity and compression to straight descriptive transcription: 146.9-10 a new . . . quite] MS '['something *a [ intrl. ]' del. ] quite *a new proposition, ['idea' del. ] [ ab. del. 'different from | from the one **whose truth is in question' [ ab. del. 'originally believed, ['in' del. ]']] *and is In the first entry it would have been possible to refer the reader by a single dagger to the Historical Collation for the variant MS text, but the quoting of the MS text is here a preferred device to make an extended and complicated description immediately understandable within itself. Of course, in the second, full-fledged descriptive transcription no reference to the Historical Collation need be contemplated since the transcription automatically provides the MS text. The book-text continues shortly and is, moreover, a fact usually very hard to verify, it being "far easier," as Mr. Russell justly says, "to settle the plain question of fact: . A series of separate entries could be contrived to deal with the MS variants in this stretch: 146.10 and . . . fact] MS intrl. 'and one' bef. del. 'one' ab. del.

If an editor chose, these separate facts could be combined into one descriptive entry pretty much as they are in separate entries; however, descriptive transcription would be much clearer and shorter: 146.10-12 and is . . . justly] MS *and one [ ab. del. 'and is an idea'] ['one' del. intrl. ] usually ['hard' del. ] very hard to *verify, [ comma over period ] *it being [ ab. del. 'It is'] 'far easier,' as Mr. Russell *justly [ intrl. ] This example may serve as a good illustration of the way in which it is possible to do away with a series of short entries in favor of one transcript. At 151.4 James wrote we must but then deleted must before continuing need to stay . Later, he deleted we and interlined one above it, and added a final s to original need . The need for flexibility in the choice of constructing an entry is shown by the following four options: 151.4 one needs] 'one [ ab. del. 'we'] ['must' del. ] needs ['s' added ] 151.4 one needs] 'one' ab. del. 'we ['must' del. ]'; 's' added to 'need' 151.4 one needs] ('s' added ); 'one' ab. del. 'we ['must' del. ]' 151.4 one] ab. del. 'we ['must' del. ]'; 's' added to 'need' The first (straight descriptive transcription) takes about 65 ens to set; the second, a mixture of description and descriptive transcription, requires about 64 ens; the third and fourth, similar mixtures, take about 56 and 52 ens respectively. The compression of the last is gained by the omission of needs from the lemma as not strictly required. Economy suggests a choice either of the third or fourth. In the next sentence James first wrote comes from making (the m of making written over some letter that just possibly may be an a ). First he deleted making and interlined carrying ; he then deleted comes from and interlined is the but deleted this is the and added before it occurs when we , necessarily then deleting the final ing of carrying . Two separate entries are possible: 151.6-7 occurs when we] intrl. bef. del. intrl. 'is the' ab. del. 'comes from' 151.6-7 carry] ( final 'ing' del. ) ab. del. 'making' ['m' over doubtful 'a'] However, in this case the two entries can profitably be combined into a single descriptive transcript: 151.6-7 occurs . . . carry] '*occurs when we [['is the' del. ] ab. del. 'comes from'] carry['ing' del. ] [ ab. del. 'making' ('m' over doubtful 'a')] The rest of the alterations for this page (see the illustration) can be given as examples of fairly typical entries in a list of Alterations: 151.7 from] aft. del.

      <field name="fulltext">III. Historical Collation The present paper has concerned itself with the transcription of a manuscript that forms the copy-text for an edition and also with the list of Alterations appended to such an edited text. It has also surveyed the problems that arise in this list of Alterations when the copy-text is, instead, a printed document and the revisions created during the course of the inscription of the manuscript may lead to considerable differences between its final text and that of the copy-text. In this latter situation a special form of notation involving the use of the double dagger has been suggested for use in the Alterations list that will enable a reader to reconstruct the variant manuscript text and its revisions with reference only to the copy-text as printed. On the other hand, the suggested convention of the single dagger requires reference to an Historical Collation for a full understanding of variants involving a rejected manuscript reading. In the special list of emendations to a printed-document copy-text no need ordinarily arises to record the inscriptional variants within an adopted manuscript reading since these are not usually pertinent to the essential matter at hand—the simple record of the emendation of the copy-text from another source. It is understood that all rejected readings of the copy-text that result from emendation will also form a part of the Historical Collation when they are substantive, and that variants created during the inscription of the final manuscript reading used as an emendation will be listed in the record of Alterations in the Manuscript. Note: For economy, it is my own practice to duplicate in the Historical Collation only the substantive emendations adopted in the copy-text from another source and to let the list of Emendations stand as the sole record of accidental emendations even in cases where my Historical Collation has listed rejected accidental as well as substantive variants from the edited copy-text. The general methods for constructing the list of Emendations and the Historical Collation, and their special problems, lie outside the scope of this paper; and a general acquaintance with the formulas for these parts of an apparatus is presupposed. If necessary, reference may be made to the headnotes in the Virginia edition of Stephen Crane or to the "Note on Editorial Method" and the headnotes in any volume of the ACLS-Harvard edition of William James, with especial reference to A Pluralistic Universe . The system is the same for earlier literature, as may be seen in the Cambridge University Press editions of Christopher Marlowe or of the Beaumont and Fletcher canon. This exclusion of inscriptional alteration within the records of the list of Emendations is admittedly arbitrary and is suggested only because the number of substantive items in such a list is usually so small as to place little burden on the user: the facts about the final manuscript readings adopted as emendations are provided in the Emendations list and if a scholar is concerned to see whether any of these readings developed in the manuscript from others, he can readily consult the list of Alterations for full information about accidentals as well as substantives. On the other hand, if an editor wished he could record changes according to the system suggested below for adding manuscript alterations to the Historical Collation in certain circumstances: sympathy&amp;c.rat;] MS [ comma del. ]; ~, I sympathy;] MS [ alt. fr. comma ]; ~: I Once engaged, an editor must be consistent, however, whether the information is pertinent as in the first illustration or of no immediate concern as in the second. The purpose of an Historical Collation is to list all rejected readings in the authoritative documents collated, whether substantives only, or in some editions, according to the circumstances, accidentals as well as substantives. By convention the lemma repeats the reading of the edited text and to the right of the bracket appear the rejected readings with their sigla. Also by convention any collated document that agrees with the lemma is not listed to the right of the bracket but instead only the variants. Thus when the sigil for a collated document is not present, the reader must take it that its reading—in contrast to the others recorded—is that of the edited text. The illustrations below assume that the collated documents comprise a manuscript and three printed editions, I, II, and III. right] wrong MS right] wrong MS, I right] wrong II-III right] wrong MS, I-III In the first, all three printed editions read right but MS reads wrong ; in the second, MS and I read right and the second and third editions wrong ; in the third, the editor chose from the second edition the emendation right as a substitute in his critical text for the reading wrong in MS and the first edition; in the fourth, right is an editorial emendation, unsupported by documentary evidence, for the reading wrong in all collated texts. When a manuscript is present but a printed document has been selected as copy-text, a certain number of the rejected manuscript variants will represent the original and unaltered inscription; but others will be drawn from the final version of the manuscript text altered during the course of inscription or review. In such a situation an editor has two choices: (1) Especially if the preserved manuscript paralleling the copy-text (of, let us say, a book) is not extensive, or if the amount of alteration is relatively small, an editor may make no attempt to conflate the appropriate information in the list of Alterations with the entries in the Historical Collation but instead he may offer two discrete lists, each of which must be consulted for the specific information it contains. Hence insofar as separate information about the same reading is present in both lists, both must be consulted independently according to the special needs of the reader. That is, supposing that the book copy-text read daffodil but the MS read narcissus which had been interlined above deleted crocus , the HC reading would be 000.00 daffodil] narcissus MS. The Alterations list would record: †000.00 daffodil] narcissus [ ab. del. 'crocus']. The virtue of this double system is that all inscriptional alterations in the MS are recorded in one place so that the list of Alterations is complete. The defects are the expense of setting two entries instead of one and the fact that in order to reconstruct the manuscript in all its details the reader must consult two separate and sometimes overlapping parts of the apparatus. For instance, when he looks at the HC he knows only that narcissus was the final reading of the manuscript; he has no means of knowing whether this was the original and only reading or whether, as in the example, narcissus was a revision of crocus : this latter information would be ascertainable only by checking the page-line reference and lemma daffodil to see if it appeared in the list of Alterations. On the whole, when the amount of duplication of entries, each with only partial information, is not serious, this system works satisfactorily and without undue extra expense. Moreover, if an editor chose he could signal to the user of the Historical Collation by some arbitrary sign like ‡ prefixed to the page-line reference that further information about this entry was available in the Alterations list and thus save the reader the labor of collating the two, as in ‡000.00 daffodil] narcissus MS. The system of double listing is that adopted in the edition of James's The Meaning of Truth (except for the cross-reference sign that had not been contrived at the time) where of the fourteen chapters only two have manuscripts. (2) On the other hand, an extensively worked-over and revised manuscript is preserved for all of the eight chapters of A Pluralistic Universe , enforcing an extremely lengthy and expensive apparatus of variants in the HC but especially in the list of Alterations. In this edition an effort was made to reduce the amount of duplication between the HC and Alterations by adopting the system that, wherever practicable, alterations would supplement the appropriate entries in the HC instead of being isolated in the separate Alterations list. In the simplest cases the HC would read, according to this system, 000.00 or] &amp; [ insrtd. ] MS instead of HC ‡000.00 or] &amp; MS and an Alterations entry †000.00 or] &amp; [ insrtd. ]. Correspondingly, no difficulty would be encountered in the HC entry 000.00 order by] ['an' del. ] order, MS instead of HC ‡000.00 order by] order, MS and Alterations 000.00 order] aft. del. 'an'. Also, 000.00 like a vast] only a vast [ ab. del. 'like a great'] MS instead of HC ‡000.00 like] only MS and Alterations ††000.00 only a vast] ab. del. 'like a great'. Or, in a case where the book text read leaving the disorderly parts out; , 000.00 leaving . . . out;] *leaving the disorder out [ intrl. ] MS instead of HC ‡000.00 disorderly parts] disorder MS and Alt. †000.00 leaving . . . out;] intrl . Not all situations are susceptible of improvement or clarity, however, by such combination. In the following example the book text read the gradual wearing away by internal friction of portions that originally interfered . The MS agreed with the book through friction of. at which point James first wrote interfering tendencies. , inserted originally before it, but then deleted the augmented phrase and continued his inscription with forces that originally interfered. so that in the MS final text the only variant is forces for portions . Some editors might well prefer to break up the record conventionally into HC ‡000.00 portions] forces MS (using the arbitrary sign ‡ to let the reader know that further information would be found in the Alterations) †000.00 portions . . . interfered.] aft. del. 'originally [ insrtd. ] interfering tendencies.' The combined HC entry would be lengthy and the real point of difference between lemma and MS reading would be somewhat obscured by 000.00 portions . . . interfered.] ['originally [ insrtd. ] interfering tendencies.' del. ] forces that originally interfered. MS. In another example, when the only variant appropriate for notice in the HC is also part of a lengthy MS alteration that otherwise agrees with the book text, the attempt to combine entries in the HC may come close to destroying the HC's usefulness. For example, the book text reads 'monistic species in the pantheism '. In MS ' pantheism ' is in roman as part of an interlined substitution that otherwise agrees with the copy-text. In such a case it would be simple to separate the entries as HC ‡000.00 pantheism ] pantheism MS, and Alt. ††000.00 monistic . . . pantheism] ab. del. 'other is commonly' whereas the combined HC entry may be thought only marginally acceptable because of the obscuration of the single point for HC recording, the roman in the MS for the book pantheism in italic: 000.00 monistic . . . pantheism ] *monistic . . . pantheism [ ab. del. 'other is commonly']. Still, the entry is possible. On the other hand, the following example, quite obviously, must be handled separately since a combined HC entry would be a monstrosity: HC 000.00 clean] pure MS and Alt. ††000.00 something pure and] ab. pencil del. 'an inner structure as *pure and classical and temple-like [ ink del. ]' The occurrence of such complex cases very difficult indeed to combine into any sort of clear HC entry suggests that not every occurrence of textual variation accompanied by alteration can be included, with the alteration, in the Historical Collation in a suitable manner and thus that full consistency is almost impossible to achieve. This is not necessarily a disqualification, however, for the use of the arbitrary signal ‡ readily steers the reader to the Alterations list when for particular reasons the account of alteration has been omitted from the HC. One may sum up by remarking that under either system the Historical Collation contains the full record of differences between the book copy-text and the final text of the manuscript. Some editors may feel that the retention of this integrity of record in the Historical Collation, with the economy (and occasional illumination) of the association of MS alterations when practicable with this notation outweighs the disadvantage of the fact that the list of Alterations is thereby denuded, in part, of information proper to its full record. Experience suggests, indeed, that sometimes a moiety, if not a majority, of the cases where alteration accompanies textual variation can be transferred to the HC by a combined entry. One needs to consider, thus, that the difficulty may be more apparent than real, for in any event a reader must consult both lists to be able to reconstruct every detail of MS variation from the copy-text, including all alterations. And even if a scholar is for the moment intent only on reconstructing the alterations made in the course of the manuscript's inscription, reference to the HC for single dagger entries in the Alterations and to the text for double dagger entries will be required, for some alterations can scarcely be understood without the necessary information of their textual variation in final form from the copy-text. Under these circumstances, perhaps, the splitting of the record of alteration between the two parts of the apparatus—depending upon whether it is or is not associated with textual variation—may not seem to be a serious defect in view of the gains that may accrue, particularly since the system is not rigid and alterations too far dissociated from the exact point of variance which it is the business of the HC to record can be left in the Alterations. In this connection the signal ‡ is very useful for directing the scholar's attention to such cases. Note: Another signal to make the HC more useful for this matter of alterations is some other arbitrary sign, like §, for instance, which can be placed before the page-line reference of the HC entries that contain a record of alteration as well as of variation: §000.00 Spinoza's; you] Spinosa's. [ ab. del. 'Protagoras.'] You MS. Simply by running his eye down the page, a reader can immediately detect all such combined entries without having to read the text to locate them. The two signs ‡ and § make the Historical Collation a more usable instrument for dealing with alterations affecting textual variation whether in the HC itself or in the list of Alterations. (Incidentally, the signal ‡ should not be used in the HC when the lemma in the Alterations is only a positioning word and has not itself been subject to alteration: HC ‡000.00 gains] gain MS is inapplicable to Alt. ††000.00 gain] bef. del. 'in value' or its alternative †000.00 gains] bef. del. 'in value'.) Nevertheless, if an editor dislikes this suggested system, or if his problem of recording variants is so simple as to make it of small value, he can readily construct the two independent and complete sections of apparatus with no more overlap than is required in the Alterations formulas of notation with daggers for cross reference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 In the eighteenth and into the nineteenth century the semicolon, at least, is frequently found inside the quotation mark, and this usage may appear in older-fashioned American writers; curiously, it is also the present typographical practice of The New Yorker magazine. 2 There is no point in nitpicking in this matter. For instance, in American usage a comma inside quotation marks following an italicized word in a roman sentence should be in roman (like the quotes) if roman text follows, regardless of whether in the actual source quotation the word and its comma were abstracted from an italic sentence with an italic comma. I should take it that British usage would be the same in this situation. 3 It goes without saying that a transcriber should never create such problems for his modern printer but should have transcripts typed so that no word is broken at the end of a line, least of all possible hyphenated compounds. If the typist has slipped, the copy for the printer must be marked to make certain that the printer sets the word as intended and not according to his own notions of styling. An editor needs to take account of such compounds in his preparation of the copy for an apparatus and to mark copy for true hyphenation to warn the printer not to break these; moreover, when the printer in the apparatus breaks words, the proofs must be marked to rearrange any line that contains an ambiguous word hyphenated at the end of the line, else the reader will never know its correct form. 4 A diplomatic transcript in a reading text would not ordinarily mark the line-endings of the original document. 5 The text of the 1860 Whitman Leaves of Grass manuscript seemed to be of this special nature, and so the alterations appear at the foot of the page. Of course, it is much cheaper to have them grouped at the back of the volume. 6 The editor's typescript apparatus is most conveniently keyed to the page-lines of his typescript of the manuscript text and can thus be prepared at the same time. Convenience and economy then suggest that the text be set directly into page proof whenever practicable so that the edition's final page-line references can be substituted by hand in the apparatus before it is sent to the printer with the marked proofs of the text. Ordinarily enough difficulty exists in typesetting apparatus to justify its being set initially in galley proof and not paged until the first revises are called for. Any relining of page proofs in the revise stage needs special attention in connection with proof-correction and may require alteration in the galley proof of the page-line numbers of the apparatus if they have been keyed to the unrevised page proofs. 7 Ordinarily, differences in the accidental form of a repeated substantive are sufficient for identification in the lemma without superscript figures. Thus is and Is in the same line need no artificial distinction. More subject to mistake by a reader might be two words differentiated only by following punctuation and no punctuation, but even so a lemma with punctuation should indicate the reading clearly enough; indeed, to employ superscript figures for such variant readings would be anomalous and sometimes ambiguous. 8 In this case a relatively easy alternative without unduly lengthening the description is to add to the entry the information about the MS variant, thus removing the need for the dagger: 155.7-8 But . . . say] above deleted 'But before saying'; 'your intent' follows deleted 'you' and deleted 'that is'; MS reads 'so,'. 9 Unlike the example in footnote 8 above, in this case a note about the isolated variant takes up excessive space if to the entry one were to add the information: MS reads 'means' for 'is.' If one condensed, the result is not altogether clear: MS reads 'means'. 10 Of course, the Historical Collation will always need to be consulted for a record of manuscript variants from the edited book-text which are not themselves an alteration or do not come within the range of an alteration specified in the lemma. 11 Actually, the lower-case MS likewise probably represents not an old-fashioned use (although James did sometimes write a series of questions in this manner) but instead an insertion of likewise and a failure to capitalize it when, probably at a later time, And was deleted. 12 Simple guidelines or guidelines with carets may be subsumed under the head of carets except for transpositions (and possibly insertions at a distance) that move text from its original position. 13 Alternate forms without description for naturally formed by ly added or natural formed by ly deleted would be: naturally ] altered from 'natural' (and) natural ] alt. fr. 'naturally'. 14 Since the text has not been changed in this example, it might be supposed that a record is unnecessary. But, in fact, alterations of this kind usually indicate some change of mind that was then reversed and hence are as important to record as any other alteration. 15 The circumstances make it perfectly clear that the comma must have been written, or inserted, after the deletion of the period; hence no need exists to write: comma inserted after deleted period . 16 Any different medium, proof of later revision, should always be mentioned: be in] added in pencil before deleted interlined 'the truth of'. If the editor is unable to determine the facts from apparently neutral evidence, he has no option but to let the literal description stand, as in the second entry. 17 In this entry a lengthy description seems necessary to sort out and relate the facts. The mention of the caret may be justified by the description of the guideline; but, actually, neither is required, and the preferred description could read: first intrl. aft. 'us', then moved to precede 'assumes', and then del. 18 If the manuscript itself were being transcribed diplomatically as the sole edited text, powerful arguments could be advanced that all slips should be recorded. This would indeed be the correct position. The exclusions suggested here are based on the assumption either that the manuscript is being critically edited in a reading text or else that some other document is the copy-text and the manuscript whose variants are being recorded in the apparatus is a secondary document to it. 19 As a part of space saving without abbreviation an editor may choose to adopt the British use of query for question mark , with a general note to that effect for the benefit of American readers. It is also shorter to use the colloquial quotes instead of quotation marks ; moreover, quotes may even be abbreviated to qts . 20 This entry illustrates a small but useful point. Ordinarily semicolons in the description separate independent units, but in this case there is only one unit—the alteration of What —and thus a comma separating the two parts is clearer than an ambiguous semicolon. 21 When a bracketed description applies to a word but not to its following punctuation, the punctuation should come after the bracket. If in this case clearness and its comma had been interlined, the text would have read with the comma before the bracket: *clearness, [ intrl. ]. Similarly, if a word is deleted but not its following comma, which thus remains to apply to the interlined substitute, one would read: *sentiment [ ab. del. 'sensibility'], then. But, if the comma had been deleted as well and the interlineation followed by a comma: *sentiment, [ ab. del. 'sensibility,'] then. 22 The construction of this formula requires and one to be inserted before deleted one as a part of the interlineation. In the earlier entry for 146.9-10, MS reads 'quite a new proposition,' was put in parentheses because it gave the final reading as a preliminary to the subsequent description of alterations. In the present entry, however, the parentheses are not needed since the situation changes: the alterations, being simple, can be listed as an integral part of the MS reading which forms the description. 23 Empty square brackets mean an illegible word or series of letters; letters that can be conjecturally read are spaced inside the brackets: c[o t min t n]. Pointed empty brackets indicate where the text has been removed by a piece of the manuscript having been torn off, crumbled away, or cut out. Any letters associated with the text about the defacement are transcribed, as co&lt; &gt;. If, for example, the tops or feet of letters of some portion were present so that some might be conjecturally reconstructed with confidence, they would be noted within the pointed brackets: co&lt;nt ti &gt;. Instead of empty square brackets one can, of course, write [ illegible ].</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Rôle of Formulas in the Dissemination of a Middle English Alliterative Romance by Hoyt N. Duggan</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We do not know very much about the dissemination of vernacular romances in fourteenth and fifteenth-century England. What we do know is fragmentary, derived in bits and pieces from accounts, letters, wills, and random notes in manuscripts. There is some evidence for commercial scriptoria in mid-fourteenth-century London in which English romances were copied and perhaps composed and more evidence after the turn of the century. 1 We know too from various sources that at least some aristocratic and middle class families either retained or hired on a casual basis scriveners who copied literary texts. 2 Nevertheless, our knowledge in this important area is severely circumscribed, especially in the interreaction of oral performance and manuscript copying as dual means by which literary texts were presented to the public. Obviously the stationers, the monastic and secular scriptoria, the amateur scribes, and independent scriveners like William Ebesham or Chaucer's "owne scriveyn," Adam, must account for the vast bulk of surviving literary manuscripts. For manuscripts descended in this kind of tradition the methods of textual criticism as developed in the treatment of biblical and classical texts are adequate and relatively straightforward. However, in a culture in which literature was written to be read or recited aloud and in which a special class of entertainers existed to satisfy a demand for orally presented narratives, it would be surprising if some of the extant texts were not touched in important ways by the facts of oral recitation, especially in the intrusion or rearrangement of materials by the performers. Professor Albert C. Baugh has recently demonstrated just such a process in the surviving manuscripts of three Middle English romances, Beves of Hampton (7 manuscripts), Guy of Warwick (6 manuscripts), and Richard the Lion-Hearted (8 manuscripts). As Baugh noted, "the variations between the manuscripts containing these longer narratives are often quite striking, so great that it is generally impossible to establish a single critical text with the variants adequately reported in the footnotes." 3 Late nineteenth-century editors had attempted to account for these variants in terms of scribal sophistication, of conscious attempts to improve the text. But as Baugh notes, these apparent instances of sophistication are not just a few touches here and there but extensive throughout the romances. Moreover, they represent "improvements" of a very curious nature, since most frequently, the improvement is inferior to the reading attested by the other manuscripts. Changes of this sort tend, in Baugh's words, to be "banalities, clichés, and rime-tags." The simplest and most compelling explanation for these variants lies in the combination of transmission by manuscript copying and the improvisation of oral performers. "In short," Professor Baugh concludes, ". . . for those popular romances in which the manuscripts show extensive variations of a kind that cannot be explained as scribal errors we have in each case the story as told by some minstrel." 4 The implications for editors of Middle English romances of this kind surviving in more than one manuscript are perfectly clear, though Professor Baugh does not insist upon them: editors must in these cases present parallel-text editions or choose a best text to be printed save where its readings produce obvious nonsense or may be attributed to scribal error. 5 Elaborate comparison of the variants is, to a considerable extent, an exercise in futility, since each manuscript is not simply a more (or less) authoritative voice representing the poet's original text as changed and corrupted in a process of mechanical copying but each may well be the result of a performer's collaboration with the poet. Each manuscript is an authority only for a performance or series of performances lying behind it. However, the introduction of performers' variants does not, in every case, wreak such havoc with the manuscript tradition, and there is some evidence, in alliterative poetry at least, that a happy conjunction of a performer's aural memory and a good exemplar provided a remarkably fine basis for copying a longish romance. The romance in question is The Wars of Alexander, an alliterative poem translated from the I 3 recension of the Historia de preliis Alexandri Magni sometime after 1360 in the Northwest Midlands. The Wars survives in two fragments. The older and longer of the two, MS. Ashmole 44, of the Bodleian Library (MS. A henceforth), was written in a northern dialect about the middle of the fifteenth century. Its ninety-seven folios, comprising 5677 lines, preserve all of the romance except the closing episode describing the death of Alexander. The shorter manuscript, MS. Dublin D.4.12, Trinity College (MS. D), was written in or near Durham Priory in the last quarter of the fifteenth century. It lacks the first 677 lines and ends at line 3425, but for 2686 lines, it provides a check against the A manuscript. W. W. Skeat presented a parallel-text edition of the two manuscripts in 1886 in which he occasionally offered emendations but did not offer an opinion as to the possibility or desirability of establishing a critical text by analysis of the variant readings. His evidence for emendation was for the greatest part based on paleography, metrical irregularity, or reference to his unfortunately corrupt edition of the Historia de preliis . 6 When I decided to re-edit the poem, initial comparison of the two manuscripts led me think it possible to establish a critical text by comparison of the two manuscripts and by reference to the source, that is, by the traditional methods of editors. However, on the way to establishing a critical text, several interesting complications presented themselves, problems of more interest than the text of The Wars of Alexander itself. Solution of those problems throws some light upon the question of how oral performances affected the dissemination of literary works and provides a model for the use of formulaic diction in deciding between variant readings in the manuscripts. It is not immediately obvious that either manuscript has been touched in any way by oral improvisation. Skeat explicitly denied that the A manuscript showed any sign of oral transmission (p. xiv), and as I shall suggest below, there is the firmest kind of evidence to link the two manuscripts to the original by continuous lines of physical copying. Nevertheless, analysis of the variants between the two manuscripts and of metrical irregularities when only the Ashmole text presented readings indicates a strong probability that both manuscripts have readings which can best be explained by recourse to minstrel improvisation. Many variations between the two texts are the result of mechanical errors in copying of one kind and another—repetitions, transpositions of letters, confusion of graphs, omissions of words or lines, and the other unconscious errors that plague anyone who attempts to copy a lengthy text. There are also apparent instances of scribal sophistication, of deliberate attempts of both scribes to edit the text and improve it. But after one has added all instances of deliberate scribal sophistication to the variants arising from mechanical miscopying of the manuscript, the bulk of the variants is still to be explained. There are passages in which one text is in the present tense, the other in the preterite (e.g., at ll. 885 ff., 921-924, 943-946, 1024 ff., 1142-1146, 1385-89, 1397-1406, etc.), in which active and passive voice vary, or in which mood and number differ (e.g., ll. 722, 844, 1944, 2142, 2164, 2987, 3095, etc.). In most cases, either reading is suitable to the context. Even more striking are variations in lexical items: stith ] styffe , ll. 1069, 1251, 1327, etc.; taite ] ioy , l. 1208; ryfe ] gret , l. 1352; bild ] tild , l. 1366; tellis ] wittnes , ll. 1439; 1592; dere ] derfe , ll. 1024, 3013; droune ] drench ( yd ), ll. 2590, 3072, 3274; wathe ] wound , l. 1411; fone ] some , l. 3180; man ] tulke , l. 3174; douth ] doughty , ll. 2627, 2663, etc.; worthili ] wightly , ll. 1405, 1428; floum ] flode , l. 2898; enmy ] foes , l. 3096. The list of such variants can be easily expanded by anyone who inspects even casually the manuscripts. Some of them can be explained as dialect translation in which the scribe substituted a more common word for a distinctively Northern form, as in the taite ] ioy ; fone ] some variation. Others, like man ] tulke ; floum ] flode ; tellis ] wittnes ; enmy ] foes , etc., are probably to be explained as the more or less unconscious substitution of synonyms. But there exists a kind of systematic variation between the two manuscripts that appears to be beyond the normal and usual combination of mechanical errors, unconscious substitutions, and scribal sophistication. This demands some explanation. The language of the poem is highly formulaic; that is, there is considerable repetition of half-lines within the poem, with both identical collocations and formula systems in evidence. There is every reason to think that the poet was literate, that he composed his poem at his table with a Latin manuscript before him, and no reason to consider him an oral poet. Yet the poem is at least as formulaic as Beowulf or Morte Arthure and shares most characteristics of orally composed poetry. Those characteristics are, I believe, fairly generally understood, having been much discussed in recent years, and it is not necessary to recapitulate the theory in detail here. 7 Suffice it to say that the poet worked within a relatively limited subgrammar of the language with conventional phrases which lent themselves to preserving a limited set of metrical and rhythmic patterns but which could be almost endlessly extended through use of what R. A. Waldron called "rhythmical-syntactical moulds." 8 The existence of these formulas and formula systems is, as I shall argue below, one of the primary critical tools for establishing the probable originality of many manuscript variants, since the variant that corresponds to a well-attested formula or formula system is more probably original than a reading that fails to fit within the system. However, there are several sets of formulas which exhibit a surprising (if one thinks only of error or scribal sophistication) consistency in variation between the two manuscripts, even when the formulas concerned are separated by several folios. The most striking of these are listed below with the A reading in italics and D inserted in parentheses: 1. And passis (passyd) on to Persy . . . 2029 He passis (passed) on toward Persy . . . 2130 The key element in this case may be the word pass in the first stressed and alliterating position, since the variation also occurs in different formula systems: þan passe (passyd) vp oure princes . . . 1397 þan passes (passid) he þethen with his princes . . . 1076 Passis (Passyd) into þe palais . . . 3217 2. . . . out of þe west endis (ende) 1733 . . . into þe west endes (ende) 2325 3. . . . was Wyothy hatten (haldyn) 2150 . . . Mocian was hatten (haldyn) 2540 . . . my satroparis hatten (halden) 1913 For other regular instances of this formula system, see ll. 40, 836*, 914, 1913, 2037, 2106, 2297, 4720, 5093, etc. 4. Aires (Kayres) him to ser Alexander . . . 2637 Aires (Kayres hym) to ser Alexander . . . 2680 Aires (Karyn) þaim to ser Alexander . . . 2792 þen aires (kayrez) him on ser Alexander . . . 2846 þare aires (kayres) him in ser Alexander . . . 2918 Aires (Caryn þaim) to ser Alexander . . . 3110 And aires (karys) with þaim to Eufraten . . . 2770 þan aires (kayres) he with Emynelows . . . 3005 5. ( I ,) Alexander þe aire (D omits þe ) . . . 1838, 2319 6. þan Alexander (als) belyue . . . 1096, 1425, 2209, 2886, 3117 And Alexander (als) belyfe . . . 909, 956, 1792, 2936 To (ser) Alexander (als) belyue . . . 1255, 3084, 3181 Quod Alexander (als) belyue . . . 1684, 2271 In this instance, D is almost certainly correct, since A agrees with D in reading as at ll. 710, 1957, 2183, 3029, and 5197. 7. Aires (hym) into Affrike . . . 1050 þan aires (hym) on ser Alexander . . . 2265 Aires (hym) to ser Alexander . . . 2680 Aires (þaim) to ser Alexander . . . 3110 Again, D is probably correct, since A agrees in reading him at ll. 749, 2847, 2918, etc. 8. . . . he flittis with his ost (D omits with ) 2173, 2439 In this case, A is probably correct. Cf. ll. 2266, 3184, 3207, 3949, 4067, and 4787. A possible counter instance in A is l. 3784. 9. Authority tags occur some eighty-five times in the b-line with variant forms of the pattern "as þe buke tellis," "as me þe claus tellis," "as demys þe textis," "þe scriptore it callis," "þe romance it tellis," "as I am enfourmed," etc. These tags alliterate variously on vowels and the following consonants: /b,d,f,k,j,l,m,p,r,s,t,w/. There are thirty-one lines in which both manuscripts agree and are regular, 9 thirty instances in which A is the sole authority and alliteration is regular, 10 one instance in which A is regular and D is not (l. 3389), ten instances in which A fails to alliterate and is corrected by D, and another eight instances in which A is the only manuscript and fails to alliterate regularly. Only two instances occur in which both manuscripts agree in irregular alliteration (ll. 2233, 3372). Of the forty-five instances of this formula occurring where both manuscripts offer readings, forty-three (95.6%) are regular. Two instances in which A is irregular and corrected by D may be explained as the scribal substitution of the synonym tellis for the correct neuens and says me of D (ll. 1485, 2997). Of the remaining eight instances in which D may be compared to A, D is regular and A in every case reads "as þe buke sais~tellis~witnes." Dublin MS. Ashmole MS. als says me þe writtes as þe buke sais 881 als says me þe text as þe buke witnes 916 as menys me þe writtes as þe buke tellis 1615 as I am enformed as þe buke tellis 1691 as sayn me þe writtes as þe buke sais 2112 &amp; þus says þe text as þe buke sais 2536 as þe writt shewys as þe buke tellis 2539 as demys me [þe] writtes as þe buke tellis 3069 In the remaining passages where the D text is lost, every instance in which A fails to alliterate regularly reads "as þe buke tellis~sais" (e.g., ll. 17, 203, 3789, 3888, 3890, 4201, 4721, and 5479. In addition to this clearly formulaic variation, there are regular word substitutions which, though not part of identical formulas, occur in the same or similar metrical environs. There is, for example, consistent variation in line terminal position of horses ] blonkez , ll. 791, 2156, 2399, 2981; sendis ] wayfez , sende ] wayfe , ll. 1716, 1868 (cf. 2752); callis ] clepys , ll. 2184, 3117; ost ] ( h ) ostez , ll. 1115, 2031, 2173, 2266, 3207 (and within the line at 3111). There is consistent variation at other positions within the line: out ] forth (after verbs of motion), ll. 802, 931, 948, 1170, 1218, 1243, 1318, 1394, 1653 (but cf. l. 923); him ] omitted by D, ll. 1078, 1113, 1196, 1353, 1451, 1955, 2283, 2594, 2610, 2662, 2956, 2988, 3114, 3190; meth ] might , ll. 816, 1981, 3102; gome ] grome , ll. 1190, 1936, 2101; douth ] doghty , ll. 2627, 2663, 3006, 3061, 3157; tilt ] typed , tiltis ] typys , ll. 1303, 1418; worthili ] wightly , ll. 1405, 1428; quen ] whil ( s ), ll. 2172, 2255, 2806; stith ] styffe , ll. 1069, 1251, 1327, 2050; stithli ] styfly , l. 2429; auncient ] auancet , ll. 1002, 2391; and faithely ] faythfully , ll. 3175, 3282. This remarkable consistency of variation suggests a systematic approach to revision rather like that of a modern editor, or else the habitual formulaic or semi-formulaic collocations of someone who knows the text very well by memory, possibly a performer. R. F. Lawrence has recently pointed to another remarkable aspect of the manuscript variants in the poem, and that is the tendency for the differing readings of both manuscripts to be metrically regular, each reading conforming to one of a limited number of rhythmic norms. 11 I list below a few instances of this sort in which the same rhythmic pattern occurs in both manuscripts in spite of differences in wording, in tense, or in number. Unstressed syllables before the first stressed stave are assumed not to be significant in determining the rhythmic type, and final -e is sounded only at the end of the line, while -id and -is are syllabic when they follow a stressed syllable. 12 The differing syllables are in italics.

This means, since pronounced differences occur at many points, that the MSS often achieve the same rhythmic pattern in a given half-line by means of quite different techniques. The problem of discrepancies between related medieval MSS is highly complex, but if corresponding lines show the same rhythms but differ somewhat in their wording it would seem reasonable to assume that those rhythms had an assured status in the formulaic tradition behind our poem (p. 106). It is not impossible that the variants of this sort are purely scribal, for all of the evidence suggests that many scribes made free with their exemplars, changing texts more or less freely to make them coincide with their aesthetic and (sometimes) moral or political preferences. 13 However, the best evidence available in George Kane's study of scribal tendencies in the sixteen manuscripts of the A version of Piers Plowman does not appear to support the idea of consistent and systematic variation of the sort we have discovered here. Kane wrote: Substitution in these manuscripts appears to have been anything but 'wild and wayward'. Indeed it tends to take several clearly defined forms determined by the relationship set up between the scribe and the matter that he was copying. This is not to suggest that it was systematic. The evidence is to the contrary. Scribes did not see their alterations in any large relation to one another. Their view of the copy seems generally to have been limited to the single line, and seldom extended to any appreciably larger unit. They were likely to understand what they read in an obvious and prima facie sense, without the exercise of reflection. Thus their activity as editors would take now one form, now another. The tendencies of substitution that can be observed in their variants represent broadly typical impulses aroused by the matter being copied (pp. 145-146). The kinds of consistent variation in lexicon, in formulas, and in rhythmic structure in The Wars of Alexander are perhaps best explained by a limited form of oral transmission. That the poem was intended for oral recitation the text itself shows clearly. More importantly, both of the surviving manuscripts show in their indications of divisions the impact of oral performances. As Albert C. Baugh pointed out in an important study of the romances in Middle English, The Wars of Alexander is divided into units of from 120 to 312 lines, thus allowing natural breaks for performers. 14 The poet was careful to provide indications of convenient places to break the narration at points greater than the single passus, usually with a formulaic line or two: Bot will ȝe herken, hende, now sall ȝe here How he kide him in þe courete &amp; quayntid him with ladis. (ll. 212-213, end of Passus I) And if ȝow likis of þis lare to lesten any forthire, Sone sall I tell ȝow a text, how it be-tid efter. (ll. 523-524, end of Passus II) And her fynes a fytt &amp; fayr when vs likez. (l. 740, end of Passus III) The ends of Passus IV and V are not so marked, but VI and VII are (ll. 1578-1579, 1842-1843), and Passus VIII ends with no distinctive formula but introduces the letter which will begin the next passus. The pattern is resumed at the end of Passus IX: And qua so will has to wete how it worthid eftir, Here sall I tell þam at loues to here forthire. (ll. 2317-2318) Significantly, these lines are not in D, nor are they part of the normal twenty-four line strophe. 15 The second line is unmetrical as it stands, whereas the first repeats almost verbatim the preceding formulaic conclusion at l. 1718. All of the evidence suggests that the two lines are not authorial, for the poet in all other instances worked the transitional formula into the normal strophe. The poet had not provided such a formal break before the end of Passus XI at l. 2845, leaving an uninterrupted text of about four times the length of those above it, and it would appear that the lines were attached, inelegantly, by a performer who had found it necessary to stop his recitation or reading at that point. 16 The poet does not provide another such ending at the close of Passus X or XII, but does close Passus XI and XIII with the laconic half-line "and here a passe (fitt) endes." Interestingly, D takes no notice of A's Passus XI and XIII, so that it has twelve passus to A's fourteen. Probably the passus divisions in A are authorial, since D's Passus X of 528 lines is half again as long as the next longest passus. One explanation, admittedly no more than conjecture, for the loss of passus headings in MS. D is that the passus breaks at these points were not useful to the performer-scribe, who subsequently dropped them from his text. 17 There is every reason to believe that the formulas cited above were intended to meet the exigencies of oral recitation—the wandering attention of an audience, the other scheduled entertainment, or the mere improbability of reading through the entire poem in one or two sittings. 18 Phrases like "And if ȝow likis of þis lare to lesten any forthire" are not meaningless rhetorical questions but are intended to allow a performer to determine the desires and interest of his audience and thus to decide whether he should continue or not. As such, they are the clearest kind of evidence that the poet wrote with an eye to the essentially oral nature of any given performance. Larry D. Benson is almost certainly mistaken in asserting that "clearly such works as The Wars of Alexander and The Destruction of Troy were written primarily for readers." 19 Few instances of alliteration are intended to appeal to the eye, but there are a significant number of instances in which elision alliteration occurs, in which only the oral performance makes the alliterative pattern clear, as for example in l. 1829, where elision of at and ese produces the /t/ necessary for regular alliteration: "Takis þam with him to his tent &amp; þam at ese makis." 20 Moreover, the poet consistently appeals to an audience of auditors. He closes the first half of the poem with an appeal which makes sense only in terms of a listening audience and opens the second half of the poem with what amounts to a formal reintroduction: Al be þe metire bot mene, þus mekill haue I ioyned; Forthi, lordis, be ȝour leue, list ȝow to suffire. Now will I tary for a time &amp; tempire my wittis; And he þat stiȝe to þe sternes, stiȝtill vs in heuen! (ll. 3464-3467) Lordis, will ȝe me lithe &amp; lestin a stonde, Now sall I kithe vs a carpe of a kyng riche, Of þe auntours of Ser Alexander þat aire was of grece, How all þe werd at his will he wan or he deid. þe lattir ende of his lyfe me list ȝow to tell. For all þe first is in fittis &amp; folowand þe lettir, And he þat made ȝow þis mirth, oft mynes his saule, þat driȝtin deyne him to dele a dele of his blis. (ll. 3468-3475) There is a curious ambivalence in these lines toward the poem and the creative process which produced it, for one of the poet's concerns is that the performer appear to be thinking and composing on his feet, that he is not sitting at his desk with pen in hand but composing ex tempore and finding it necessary to "tary for a time &amp; tempire my wittis." The other interest, submerged to this point, is that his audience should recognize the story as history, that he, the poet, has indeed followed the letter and that the poem is already "made." The prayer for God's blessing is for the maker, who need not be the person who recites the romance, and in this one passage the poet, speaking as suppliant and translator, steps for a moment outside the narrative persona which in all other instances is consonant with the performer-composer. Here we see most clearly the double perspective maintained by a literate poet writing within an essentially oral tradition for oral delivery. Perhaps the same tensions between oral and written language as modes of dissemination can best account for the kinds of variation we have encountered in the two surviving manuscripts. The researches of Albert C. Baugh into the authorship and dissemination of Middle English romances support such a conclusion, providing considerable evidence of romances changing under the influence of dissemination through minstrels. 21 It would have been no unusual feat for a minstrel to memorize the 6000-plus lines of The Wars of Alexander . Léon Gautier cites instances of French jongleurs boasting of having entire chansons de geste by memory and being able to recite them without losing a line. 22 But the performer who recites a poem of this length a number of times must sooner or later begin to change it in larger and smaller details, substituting his own habitual collocations for those of the text he had once conned so carefully. It is the practicing performer rather than the scribe who is likely to produce the kind of variants we have noted above, for it is he who by countless recitations of both this and other alliterative poems will have fixed in his mind not only the formulas but also the abstract grammatical and metrical patterns that lie behind them. The very slowness of the pace in ordinary scribal transcription, the necessity for copying word by word, or at most phrase by phrase, does not encourage success at imitating alliterative formula systems. 23 There are, nevertheless, serious difficulties in the way of one who would argue that either the A or D manuscript is separated from the original by oral recomposition. The experience of Milman J. Parry and Albert B. Lord with modern Slavic singers of tales contradicts the textual situation in this instance. Although the modern oral singers boasted of their ability to repeat a lengthy tale from memory without losing a line, they did not in practice often give a word for word, or even a line for line identical version of the tale. 24 There is, however, no compelling reason to assume that the conventions governing a primarily oral art like that of the modern Slavic singers would be identical with those for the propagation orally of written texts. The memory of a minstrel reciting a Middle English romance is probably better compared to that of the modern actor, without, of course, the actor's respect for "established" text, than with the memory of the singer who composes orally. The formula may serve as an aid to memory as well as provide the basic patterns of a grammar of composition, and it is to be expected that in a transitional text like The Wars of Alexander formulas would function to aid in the dissemination of the poem as much as it would have aided the composition. 25 A more forcible objection to a theory of oral transmission is that both manuscripts are demonstrably linked by written tradition to the original; that is, marks in the manuscripts correlate both the strophe divisions and major rubrications in the Latin source of the poem, neither of which would be possible in a purely oral tradition. In the A text, there are fifty-nine instances in which the scribe marks the beginning of a strophe with '¶', while the D text has fifty significant instances of lines either marked with '¶' or written wholly or partially in majuscule letters. Of these, there are seventeen instances of agreement between the two manuscripts which occur at the beginning of a strophe and one instance (l. 2755) in which both manuscripts agree with a major Latin manuscript division which does not correlate with the usual twenty-four line strophe. Only a continuous line of copied texts will account for the presence of these division markers. 26 We may consider the question of why a performer would go to the trouble and expense of copying a text he had memorized. Unfortunately, too little is known of the actual process by which performers acquired copies of literary works. As Dieter Mehl pointed out, there is little evidence "in favour of minstrel-collections, i.e., manuscripts written specially for minstrels and carried around by them." 27 On the other hand, it is clear that there was a class of performers, some itinerant, some more comfortably attached to a court and patron, who had to have such literary materials for their livelihood. That itinerant minstrels could have afforded any sizeable collection of manuscripts is improbable, but their more favorably established confreres might well have been encouraged to obtain and copy literary works. Performers willing to write out and sell copies of manuscripts in their own, or more probably, in their patron's collection, cannot have been rare. Clearly there was a market for such manuscripts, for in a much quoted passage, Petrarch decries the existence of a sub-artistic class of minstrels, a species of literary parasite who built their reputations upon the purchased or begged wits of original poets: You are familiar no doubt with that vulgar and widespread class who get their living by words—and not their own, either—who have become so disgustingly prevalent. They are men of no great ability, but of great memory, great diligence, and even greater audacity. They frequent the halls of kings and princes, naked of themselves but clothed in the songs of others. And if anything especially choice is produced by this person or that, especially in the mother tongue, they recite it with infinite expression and court the favor of the nobility, seeking money and clothes and gifts. The materials by which they make this kind of living are picked up here and there, sometimes from the writers themselves, either by begging or for a price, if the latter is made necessary by the poverty or the cupidity of the seller ( Rerum Senilium . Book V, Epistle 3). As Baugh remarks, it is probable that the same situation obtained in fourteenth-century England. 28 Oral transmission of the sort Professor Baugh found is out of the question for this poem, and any simple notion that the texts are the product of oral improvisation requires strict qualification. Still, there is the remarkable consistency of the manuscript variants which must be accounted for. Scribal sophistication in the ordinary sense of that term is not really compatible with the evidence, and there is no indication at all of authorial revision. Rather, the manuscripts present precisely the kinds of variants that might arise in a performer's recitation of the memorized text over a period of time. Without conscious thought of changing his text, he would have shifted tense, substituted synonyms, altered formulas, and restructured lines. 29 At some later date the performer who came to copy or recopy the memorized poem would be to a great extent like any other scribe. He would have attempted to reproduce his exemplar more or less faithfully, and like other scribes would have made his share of unconscious mechanical errors and exercised the same right of tampering with a reading here and there to improve or correct the written text before him. But he would differ from the ordinary scribe by having not only the written exemplar on the paper before him but also an aural memory of his own performances. He would, more or less consciously, have inserted his habitual expressions in preference to the readings of the exemplar. It would in turn serve as a check to his memory, a presence before him controlling what he wrote. It would halt the displacement or deletion of scenes and episodes. Some such process in the textual tradition of both manuscripts would account for both the demonstrable continuity in the copying of the manuscripts and for the kinds of consistent variation between the two texts. It is not possible to prove that this is what really happened, but it is less intrinsically improbable than the assumption that all of the variants not explicable by paleographic evidence are the result of ordinary scribal sophistication. The question then arises, given the probability that both of the extant manuscripts are contaminated by the interposition of a performer's words, whether a critical edition is possible. The implications of Professor Baugh's studies are certainly discouraging. More recently, Professor William E. Holland's study of the variants in the manuscripts of Arthour and Merlin led him to the conclusion that in a verse romance transmitted through a series of minstrel copies the "attempt to delineate the descent of the manuscripts . . . must fail not merely because of an insufficiency of evidence (not enough manuscripts) but because such an attempt is based on an erroneous assumption about the nature of that descent" (p. 105). To this point, every study of the impact of oral delivery upon the texts of written manuscripts has indicated that it led inevitably to a rapid rate of textual corruption. The evidence from the manuscripts of The Wars of Alexander , however, suggests at least the probability that partial oral dissemination need not in fact have caused radical disruption of the text, that the highly formulaic diction of the poem must have been a stabilizing factor in the dissemination of the romance. Equally important for the modern editor, those formulas are extremely useful in establishing a critical text. The steady and systematic use of evidence derived from the composition of a poem in formulas has not, to my knowledge, been a feature of earlier editions of Middle English texts. 30 For the Middle English alliterative revival, it is customary to argue, as John Finlayson does in his recent edition of the Morte Arthure , that the poets "would appear to have drawn on a common stock of alliterative formulas to express the events drawn from their source material, and in some cases to have created new formulas on the model of those with which they were familiar." 31 If this were indeed the case, reliance upon formulaic evidence for decisions between variants would be fatuous, since a poet drawing mechanically upon a stock of formulas (as he would draw upon, say, a stock of Latin rhetorical topoi) would not be bound by the formula systems but free to change the conventional phrases in various ways to "make it new." However, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the opposite conclusion. The Wars of Alexander was not orally composed, at least not as an extemporaneous performance of the kind associated with the Yugoslav singers studied by Parry and Lord. But the author composed like an oral poet. Whether he also composed other poems orally is mere speculation, but that this poem is composed substantially in formulas and formula systems is ample evidence that he had a grammar of composition which enabled him to generate an almost endless number of phrases, clauses, and sentences which were also rhythmic half-lines of alliterative verse. 32 In short, the Wars -poet was able to do with pen and ink what generations of oral poets had done in extemporaneous performances. He did not just draw on a tradition of formulaic diction or borrow fixed formulas from other poems but wrote formulaically. 33 The literate poet who composes formulaically is not precisely like the ordinary poet even when he is writing rather than singing his narrative. He composes from within a more limited sub-grammar of the language than the poet who does not compose in formulas, for that poet, though he may use tags and conventional phrases and may appeal as consistently to a listening instead of a reading audience, nevertheless has more of the syntactic and semantic resources of his language available to him. Professor Frederick Cassidy's report on research into the syntactic patterns utilized by the Old English poets who wrote the elegies and Beowulf reveals that only twenty-five basic syntactic patterns are used in those poems, considerably fewer than were available to the writer of Old English prose. 34 I have not completed a grammar of The Wars of Alexander , but preliminary research reveals that a very few basic phrase structure rules will account for most of the off-line formulas. I do not wish to imply that the sub-grammar utilized by the Wars -poet was in the least constricting or inadequate to his purpose, nor would it be appropriate to suggest that it is inflexible and absolutely regular. No natural language is. It was not constricting to the poet because it was learned by listening to and by reading a great deal of alliterative poetry, and it was not inadequate because it could generate an infinite number of grammatically and metrically acceptable lines. But from the view point of the modern student of his language, the options open to the formulaic poet are limited by that grammatical-metrical system, by the abstract syntactical, rhythmic, and (what is less well understood in spite of the emphasis upon fixed formulas) semantic collocations behind what he wrote. The editor cannot assume that the poet composing formulaically achieved absolute regularity in his verse, though since he was able to reread and correct what he had written, his opportunities to achieve total regularity were much greater than for purely oral poets. Nor should one assume that he aimed at such regularity. None of the surviving Middle English alliterative poems is perfectly regular, especially in the alliterative patterns, though it is, I think, improbable that there is much conscious variation of formula systems to achieve the variety urged in rhetorical manuals. Apparent variety in the formulas, as R. F. Lawrence has recently argued, is much more likely to be motivated by the necessity to conserve basic rhythmic norms than by the desire to achieve artful innovation for reasons of ornamentation. 35 It follows then that when the manuscripts vary, the reading that corresponds to an established formula system is likely to be original and that readings which are not consonant with the grammar of composition are probably corrupt. A few examples will demonstrate the uses of formulaic evidence in establishing the text. 1. At line 1129, the second half-line in A reads "as he þareon lokis." D differs only in the verb, which is the synonymous "wates." The readings are metrically and semantically interchangeable. Both lokis and wates appear elsewhere in the poem in the final stressed position, lokis at ll. 603, 677, 750*, 840*, 2942, etc., and wa(i)tis at ll. 131, 194, 265, 700, 781*, 956, 2930, 3630, 3636, 4129, 4776, etc. On positional grounds, there is no reason to choose between the two. However, the formula occurs again at ll. 956 and 3630, and in the first, both manuscripts agree in reading waites . Only A exists at l. 3630, but that it too reads waite is evidence for the probable originality of that word in this formula. Although the evidence is far too slight for certainty, it is also probable that loke was more common, even in the North, than waite by the middle years of the fifteenth century, when the A manuscript was written, and that waite is to be preferred as the more difficult reading. 36 2. The principle of accepting the lectio difficilior , however, is a weaker reed in formulaic poetry than in verse less bound by semantic and syntactic conventions. At line 1738, the manuscripts differ again in the final stressed position. A reads "oure force to ministere," while D has "oure force to withstonde." Ministere "to control, govern" does not occur elsewhere in the poem. Indeed, using it in the sense of controlling a hostile force is an innovative extension of the normal meanings of the word (see OED , s. v. , Minister, v. 7a). It makes excellent sense and, pronounced with the second syllable elided, is metrically regular. However, the D reading is clearly a manifestation of a common off-line formula system which occurs several times in the poem without substantial modification: . . . his wrothe to with-stand 2077 . . . his force to with-stand 2357 . . . ȝour faes to withstand 2804 . . . oure force to withstand 3717 . . . oure miȝtis to withstand 3766 . . . ȝour saȝe to with-stande 5119 The D reading, which corresponds to the formula, is unlikely to have resulted from scribal error or sophistication; and the more difficult and, in some ways, aesthetically more satisfactory, reading of the A manuscript is to be rejected. If instead of composing formulaically the poet had been drawing on a tradition of formulas, quite the opposite decision would be required. 3. At l. 714, the A manuscript reads: "As be þe welken to wete quat suld come efter." D reads "Als be welkyn to wete what worth sall her-aftir." Henneman very sensibly suggested emendation of the line to "quat worth sall eftir," a course I followed in the first draft. However, there is some evidence that supports a more complicated emendation. As the following lines reveal, the half-line is a manifestation of a fairly common formula system: . . . quat suld worþe efter 171 . . . he sall take eftire 360 . . . how it be-tid efter 524 . . . howe it worthis eftir 1718 . . . þat sall fall eftir 1897A . . . þat falle sall after 1897D . . . how it sall tide eftir 2145 . . . how it worthid eftir 2317 (probably spurious) Both manuscripts agree in word order at ll. 1718 and 2145. Strictly speaking, the three instances which occur before the D fragment begins constitute only evidence for the practice of the A scribe and the existence of the formula system. 37 Recurrence of the D pattern "þat falle sall eftir" at l. 1897 is parallel to the reading here, and the two constitute additional evidence for the instrusion of habitual collocations of performers into that manuscript. It is, of course, not impossible that the poet himself employed both word-order patterns in this formula system, but the preponderance of evidence—the admittedly slight statistical evidence and the fact that the second D reading is of the avoided rhythmic pattern x/x/x—suggests that the line should read "quat suld worth eftir." That is, in this case, the A scribe had substituted the synonymous come for worth , and the D text had the performer's variant involving a shift in word order. The D text's her-eftir is probably motivated by the desire to meet the more common off-line rhythmic pattern of x/xx/x. 4. At line 1189, the A text reads in the off-line "he writhis him vnfaire," and D has "he wex wode wroth." The alliteration is suspect in D as being too heavy, but formulaic evidence provides the best reason for choosing the A reading: . . . angirs vnfaire 837 . . . þat tened þam vnfaire 1212 . . . deris þam vn-faire 2041 . . . &amp; turbled vnfaire 3637 . . . was arȝed vnfaire 3873 . . . berand vnfaire 3903 . . . crabbid vnfaire 4566 . . . &amp; breed þaim vnfaire 4741 . . . breis þaim vn-faire 4837 In spite of superficial differences, the lines cited above correspond to the rhythmic norm (x)/xx/ (perhaps x/xxx/ in l. 1212), and flexibility of syntactic relationships between the variant forms is made apparent in ll. 4741 and 4837. In this instance, the probability that the A reading is correct amounts almost to certainty. 5. At line 2199, the A manuscript reads in the off-line "þat citiȝens hatt," and D reads "þat citesyns er called." Neither reading is unsatisfactory in itself, but the preponderance of evidence suggests that neither is in fact correct. The formula recurs in the following lines: . . . &amp; Anec was hatten 40 . . . Pausanna was hatten 914A} . . . pausana he heght 914D} . . . my satroparis hatten 1913A} . . . my satropers halden 1913D} . . . Amont was hatten 2037A} . . . amonta was callyd 2037D} . . . Yssanna was hatten 2106 . . . was Wyothy hatten 2150A } . . . was worthyly haldyn 2150D } . . . Platea was hatten 2297 . . . Mocian was hatten 2540A } . . . of Mocian es haldyn 2540D } . . . þat angill is hatten 4720 . . . was Marcipy hatten 5093 The evidence is clearly mixed. The A scribe with some consistency preferred the pattern ending in hatten , and the D scribe showed considerable uncertainty with variations on called , heght , and haldyn . However, agreement of both manuscripts at lines 2106 and 2297 suggests that the A text has retained the original form. In all probability, D is correct in having retained the syntactic pattern of the auxiliary plus past participle, A in having retained a form of hatten , and the corrected text should read "þat citizens er hatten." 6. Unfortunately, the D manuscript does not extend beyond l. 3467, but formulaic evidence may be used to correct the A text where it stands alone. For instance, at ll. 4775-4776, the text reads: þe kyng in his caban with his kniȝtis he ligis, Tutand out of his tents &amp; þe trees waitis. The text is not obviously corrupt as it stands, but there is a good deal of evidence that the second half of l. 4906 should read "&amp; on þe trees waitis": . . . ay on þat dere waytis 265 . . . quen he on him waites 956 . . . as he þar-on lokis (wates, D) 1129 . . . quen þai þare-on waite 3630 . . . &amp; on his ost waites 4129 7. The highly formulaic language sometimes led the scribes (or performers) to careless substitution of a common pattern for the correct reading. For instance, at l. 2829, the A manuscript reads "And etils to Ser Alexander eft to assaill." The D text reads "And ettlys þe sir Alexander efte to assayle." In this instance, citation of the immediate context will help to make the nature of the problem more clear; King Darius' mother Rodagoras writes to her son advising him not to continue his mad plan to attack Alexander: Bald baratour on bent, borne of my bosom, Here send I þe, my swete, salutis &amp; ioy. þou has heuyd vp þi huge ost, as I haue herd tell, Samed all þi saudiours &amp; semblid þi pupill, And etils to ( or þe) Ser Alexander eft to assaill. The A reading corresponds to the common formulaic system "(and) + verb of motion, usually aires + (pronoun) + to Sire Alexsandire . . ." For line citations, see p. 0000 above. However, the attraction of that formula was a siren song for the A scribe, and the source reveals that D's þe is correct: "ut cum Alexandro iterum pugnaretis." 38 8. The very best evidence for deciding between variants or for emending the single manuscript is the conjunction of formulaic evidence and the source. At lines 5359-5360, where only the A text survives, the text reads: þan callis Candace þe kniȝt, in consaille him takis, Sees hire sons wald him sla, and radly scho pleynes. The alliteration is irregular in the off-line of 5360, for we would ordinarily expect alliteration to fall on the stressed syllable rad- . The formula system alliterates elsewhere on /m,d,s,a/, and we should expect the realization of the formula here to be "and sadly scho pleynes" on the model of the following lines: . . . &amp; maynly hire pleynes 399 . . . &amp; depely þam playnt 1698 . . . &amp; sadly he pleyned 4204 Both the lack of regular alliteration and the existence of a formula system designed, as it were, to produce a regularly alliterating line on /s/ make the manuscript reading suspect. Fortunately, the formulaic evidence which suggests emendation to sadly finds corroboration in the source which reads: "Videns Candacis regina quod volebant se interficere filii sui, tristis effecta est nimis" (G1, fol. 159 b ). 9. Unhappily, the collection and analysis of formulaic evidence will not always permit the editor to decide between variants because of the complicating addition of performers' formulaic collocations to the texts. What at first sight appears to be a variant of the formula system just discussed appears in the off-verse of line 972. The A manuscript reads "augirly he wepis," and D reads "awgerdly pleynez." Alliteration is on the first syllable of augirly , and both readings are metrically regular. The D rhythm /xx/x is of more frequent occurrence than A's /xxx/x, but there is reason to regard both as variations on the same type. Comparison with the lines cited above suggests a generalization and a simple solution. There is obviously a formula system of the pattern "( and ) + adverb + pronoun + pleynes ," where the adverb and pleynes are stressed and where the particular adverb that appears is determined primarily by alliteration. The slot for the pronoun is unstressed and presumably could be filled with any personal pronoun of one syllable. Since pleynes is the stable element that defines the system in lexical terms, it would seem probable that D's pleynez is correct and the performer-scribe of the A manuscript was responsible for substituting the synonym wepis . Both manuscripts are thus corrupt, A having substituted the synonym and D having deleted the pronoun. However, the D reading is itself regular metrically and seems to be based on another common formula system: . . . augirly granys 717 . . . &amp; augrily granys 3252 . . . &amp; bitterly wepis 963 The last cited form presents a thorny problem. It would seem to express the same "given essential idea" as "&amp; augrily granys" or "awgerdly pleynez." Certainly, it has the same syntactic-rhythmic form of "(and) + adverb + verb" (x/xx/x). But if it is the product of the same formula system, the notion of lexical repetition as always a chief determinant of the formula system must be more limited than previous studies have suggested. The line of reasoning adopted earlier which would explain the A variant as a corrupted form of "augirly he pleynes" on the grounds that pleynes is the stable lexical item in that formula system is clearly inadequate. A new search of the poem for all instances of the off-verse pattern "(conjunction) + adverb + (pronoun) + verb" produced 233 lines, and among these were the following two lines which tend to corroborate the A reading: . . . baldly he wepis 5039 . . . he rewfully wepid 2843A . . . rewfully he wepys 2843D In short, there are at least three possible syntactic-rhythmic patterns (themselves variants of the same formula system?) which may be behind the two variants. Both readings are regular, and parallels for both are to be found elsewhere in the poem. One is certainly an error, a more or less conscious substitution for the original reading. Both may be corrupt, though it is equally possible that one of the two is authorial. In any case, there is no evidence to suggest that one reading is preferable to the other on any rational grounds. If it is indeed true that this poem is composed formulaically and that there is the interposition of performers' variants in the history of both surviving manuscripts, the implications of such evidence are of considerable interest beyond the editorial conclusions I have drawn at length above. First, there is at least one transitional text between orally composed poetry and written poetry, written by a literate poet but composed within the rhythmic, grammatical, and lexical restraints of a grammar of composition probably oral in origin. There are almost certainly others. Secondly, modern studies of the use of formulas in medieval texts which survive in a single manuscript are possibly askew to the extent that the existence of systematic performers' variants are ignored or unknown. A study of formulas in The Wars of Alexander based on either manuscript alone will produce a quite distorted view of the poet's own practice, since in each instance, the poet's words are changed by the habitual formulaic collocations of the performer. It must not be forgotten either that both manuscripts are linked to an original exemplar by a continuous line of copying, unlike the manuscripts of the metrical romances studied by Baugh and Holland. The appearance of performers' variants in manuscripts so descended suggests at least the possibility that other highly formulaic alliterative poems—and perhaps one should think of Old English as well as Middle English texts here—are similarly the product of collaboration between the poet and a line, long or short, of anonymous performer-scribes. It is, of course, possible that the manuscripts of the Wars are sports, that the process which left the two manuscripts to us was unique. Although the theory advanced in this article to explain the nature and number of variants is the most economical account of the facts, it may not be true. If it is, however, and if the manuscripts of the Wars are not unique, we need to examine again our theories of formulaic diction in the light of this new evidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The first important study which attempted to demonstrate the existence of secular scriptoria before the mid-fourteenth century in England is that of Laura Hibbard Loomis, "The Auchinleck Manuscript and a Possible London Bookshop of 1330-1340," PMLA , 57 (1942), 595-627, though J. S. P. Tatlock had urged the probability of such commercial undertakings in "The 'Canterbury Tales' in 1400," PMLA , 50 (1935), 108-109. Mrs. Loomis' hypothesis is very likely correct in its main outlines, but some of the evidence on which her conclusions are based, particularly the repetitions of lines and phrases in the romances of the Auchinleck manuscript, is probably better explained in terms of the conventional diction of Middle English metrical romances in general (see the studies of Albert C. Baugh and William E. Holland cited in notes 3-5 below) than by borrowing within the workshop. This is especially true of the arguments advanced in her essay "The Auchinleck Roland and Vernagu and the Short Chronicle ," MLN , 60 (1945), 94-97, and H. M. Smyser's " Charlemagne and Roland and the Auchinleck MS.," Speculum , 21 (1946), 275-288. Less ambiguous is the evidence of scribal cooperation within the scriptorium produced by A. J. Bliss, "Notes on the Auchinleck Manuscript," Speculum , 26 (1951), 652-658. For fifteenth-century commercial scriptoria for vernacular texts, see Tatlock, op. cit. , pp. 100-139; James W.

Magoun, Jr., in "The Oralformulaic Character of Anglo-Saxon Narrative Poetry," Speculum , 28 (1953), 446-467, was the first to apply to the study of medieval English poetry the methods and insights derived from the investigations of Milman Parry and Albert B. Lord into the techniques of oral composition in modern Serbo-Croatian poetry. For an excellent survey of the scholarship to 1966, see Michael Curschmann, "Oral Poetry in Mediaeval English, French, and German Literature: Some Notes on Recent Research," Speculum , 42 (1967), 36-52. Most of the considerable scholarship in English literature has been concerned with Old English poetry, and Donald Fry's Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburh : A Bibliography (1969), accounts for most of these.

In that debate, the chief figures have been Jean Rychner, La Chanson de Geste : essai sur l'art épique des jongleurs (Geneva and Lille, 1955); René Louis, "Le Refrain dans les plus anciennes chansons de geste et le sigle AOI dans le Roland d'Oxford," in Mélanges de linguistique et de littérature romanes à la memoire d'Istvan Frank (Saarbrücken, 1957), 330-360; "Qu'est-ce que l'épopée vivante?", La Table Ronde , no. 132 (1958), 9-17; Rita Lejeune, "Technique formulaire et chansons de geste," Le Moyen Age , 60 (1954), 311-334; Adrien Bonjour, "Poésie Héroïque du moyen âge et critique littéraire," Romania , 78 (1957), 243-255; Maurice Delbouille, "Les chansons de geste et le livre," in La technique littéraire des chansons de geste .

Chaytor, From Script to Print , pp. 115-137. 26 The poem is composed in strophes or stanzas of twenty-four lines, though there is evidence that eight, twelve, sixteen, twenty, and twenty-eight line strophes were written. Max Kaluza, "Strophische Gliederung in der mittelenglischen rein alliterierenden Dichtung," Englische Studien , 16 (1892), 169-180, was the first to realize that the poem was composed in strophes, but he was unaware of the poet's attempt to relate the strophes to the divisions of his Latin source. I discuss this problem in detail in my forthcoming edition of the poem. 27 The Middle English Romances of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries (1969), p. 11. There is no indication that either manuscript of The Wars of Alexander is a minstrel copy nor that either is the product of a bookshop like that described by Mrs. Loomis. The loss of 123 lines between fols. 12 and 13 of the A manuscript proves straightforward mechanical copying on the part of that scribe. Loss of so many lines is evidence that the A scribe did not know the text well, while the connection of the D manuscript with Piers Plowman and Durham Priory makes attribution to a minstrel improbable. 28 "The Middle English Romance," p. 4. I have taken my citation from Baugh's text. See also Edmond Faral, Les Jongleurs en France au Moyen Age (Paris, 1910), pp. 75-76, and Chaytor, From Script to Print , p. 116. The Latin text of the Epistolae rerum senilium may be found in Francisci Petrarchae, Operum (Basel, 1554; rpt. Ridgewood, N. J., 1965) II, 877. 29 "To a minstrel verbal accuracy is not important so long as he keeps the meter. He is not reciting Shakespeare. He is telling a story. Even if his memory is a good one, he may have occasional lapses, be forced to improvise, may drop out a couplet or a stanza, may substitute a familiar rime-tag or formula without even being aware of it, may alter a particular passage through equally unconscious contamination with a similar incident in some other romance which he is accustomed to recite, may insert at times a couplet or a whole passage if it is part of his general stock of conventional descriptions and incidents, commonplace lines and phrases. Of course, he is corrupting the text, but that is a modern notion. The important thing for him is to keep going" (Baugh, "The Middle English Romance," p. 29). 30 Obviously all editors have taken into consideration similarities in phrasing and the limited number of acceptable rhythmic patterns in alliterative poetry, though many of Henneman's careful and intelligent emendations reveal his lack of awareness of systematic formulas in the poem. Critics of the Old French chansons de geste have shown more awareness of the usefulness of formulaic evidence for textual studies. See Jeanne Wathelet-Willem, "À propos de la technique formulaire dans les plus anciennes chansons de geste," in Mélanges de linguistique romane et de philologie médiévale offerts à Maurice Delbouille , Philologie médiévale (Gembloux, 1964), pp. 705-727, esp. p. 727. See also Karl Heinz Göller, "Stab und Formel in Alliterienden Morte Arthure ," Neophil. , 49 (1965), 57-67. The discovery that Middle English alliterative poetry was highly repetitive in diction is not a new one, though most of the early research was directed toward establishing common authorship. Several studies are still of considerable value. See Moritz Trautmann, Über Verfasser und Entstehungzeit einiger alliterierender Gedichte des Altenglischen (Halle, 1876); Johannes Fuhrmann, Die alliterienden Sprachformeln in Morris' Early English Alliterative Poems und im Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight (Hamburg, 1886); Curt Reicke, Untersuchungen über den Stil der mittelenglischen alliterierenden Gedichte " Morte Arthure," "The Destruction of Troy," "The Wars of Alexander," "The Siege of Jerusalem," "Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight" (Königsberg, 1906); and J. S. P. Tatlock, "Epic Formulas, Especially in Laȝamon," PMLA , 38 (1923), 494-529. 31 Morte Arthure , York Medieval Texts (1967), p. 25. I do not wish to urge that all of the alliterative poems of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries are like the Wars in being composed formulaically. The works of the Gawain -poet clearly are not, but poems like Morte Arthure , The Destruction of Troy , and the Siege of Jerusalem would probably repay study. The computer is clearly the most rational approach to a problem of this kind. A program already exists for Old English which could be of use. See Donald C. Green, "Formulas and Syntax in Old English Poetry: A Computer Study," Computers and the Humanities , 6 (1971), 85-93. Professor Green, whose study I read after completion of this essay, reaches similar conclusions about the primacy of syntactic-metrical collocations in the definition of formulas. 32 See Lord, The Singer of Tales , pp. 35-36; Robert L. Kellogg, "The South Germanic Oral Tradition" in Franciplegius : Medieval and Linguistic Studies in Honor of Francis Peabody Magoun , Jr. , eds. J. B. Bessinger, Jr. and R. P. Creed (1965), pp. 66-74; and F. G. Cassidy, "How Free was the Anglo-Saxon Scop?" in Franciplegius , pp. 75-85. 33 It is not possible in this place to prove in detail that the poet was indeed working within such a tradition or to outline the particular sub-grammar which governed his composition. A number of formula systems are cited in this article, and the sceptic may quickly gather a sample of his own by random checks in Skeat's glossary, especially of adverbs, adjectives, and nouns. 34 Cassidy, op. cit. , 75-85. 35 Lawrence, ES , 51 (1970), 97-112. Lawrence thinks it possible that the Wars -poet was influenced by the rhetorical manuals, but concludes that "it seems now beyond much doubt that in Wars Alex. a great proportion of the apparently random divergences from one realisation of a formula or grammetrical frame to another were parts of an elaborate and purposive design which, without stifling variety, safeguarded a vital element in the traditional rhythm of the verse" (p. 112). 36 Similar variation in a different formula in ll. 677 and 700 is the most slender kind of evidence that the A scribe (or performer) tended to vary original wai(i)tis with lokis . Both manuscripts agree in reading waytis ( watyn ) at l. 700. 37 When the two manuscripts vary consistently at every point and there is no instance in which both agree, it is impossible without evidence from the source or without some striking irregularity in alliteration or rhythm to determine which of the two readings is original. 38 Glasgow, University Library, MS.

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of A Faire Quarrell , Q2 by Gerald D. Johnson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An analysis of the printing of the second quarto of Thomas Middleton and William Rowley's A Faire Quarrell , printed in 1622 by A[ugustine]. M[atthewes]. for Thomas Dewe, 1 throws light upon some of the practices used in the production of reprints by a job printer who was engaged in the concurrent printing of several editions. A Faire Quarrell , Q2, was intended to be a page-for-page reprint of the 1617 second issue of Q1. However, a wholesome blunder in the first sheets of the reprint considerably complicated the theoretically straightforward and simple composition. 2 In five of the eleven extant copies of this edition, the four pages of text on B3-B4 v are duplicated on C1-C2 v . 3 The error evidently arose through an oversight on the part of the foreman who assigned compositorial stints or the compositor of Sheet C himself. In the Q1 copy the text begins on B1 with the title-page and dedicatory epistle taking up the first two leaves. Q2, on the other hand, prints the title-page and the epistle as the first two leaves of Sheet A and begins its text on A3. Thus, after A2, the signatures of the reprint are not in alignment with those of its copy. At C1, however, this difference in paging was overlooked and C1 of Q2 was set as C1 of Q1, aligning the signatures and creating a two-leaf duplication. A spelling analysis of Q2, comparing its spelling with Q1, suggests how the compositorial stints were allocated and how the error probably arose. Three compositors worked in the first three sheets, with Compositor A setting A and the outer forme of Sheet B, Compositor B setting the inner forme of Sheet B, and Compositor C all of Sheet C. Compositor A may be identified by his indifference to the copy spelling of heere-here , his preference of final ie on nouns and adjectives and medial y in nouns and adjectives, his favoring of final e on nouns and verbs, and his addition of the apostrophe in elided past participles. In contrast, Compositor B strongly prefers here (he changed the spelling eight times in his four pages), tolerates final y , is indifferent to medial y-i , and strongly favors leaving off final e and omitting the apostrophe. Compositor C's spelling, on the other hand, is characterized by its close following of the copy spelling, no matter how mixed it may be. In fact, in Sheet C, he departed from the copy only forty-five times in all points of spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Both Compositors A and B, however, alter the accidentals of the copy quite freely, A varying 148 times in his ten pages and B ninety-eight times in his four. On the other hand, both A and B were more accurate in reproducing the substantive reading of their copy than was C. C introduced eleven substantive variants in his setting of Sheet C, not including typographical blunders. Compositor C's errors include misreadings ('longing' for 'lodging' on C3 v , 'thy' for 'my' on C2 v ), oversights (such as the omission of a full line on C1 v ), and possible "corrections" of the copy (such as in the unusual reading on C1, 'Shall I enter in sir?' which C renders as 'Shall I enter sir?'). Extending the spelling analysis through the remaining sheets of the reprint suggests that Compositor C also set Sheet D. However, in Sheet E yet another hand may be seen, different from any of the first three. Compositor D follows the copy spelling of heere-here , strongly prefers final ie , prefers medial i , but is indifferent to final e and the apostrophe. His spelling may be seen in Sheets E, F, H, and K. Sheets G and I, however, appear to have been set by still another hand. This compositor, Compositor E, follows the copy spelling of heere-here and medial y-i , favors final ie (but not nearly as strongly as does D) and final e , and is indifferent to the apostrophe. The use of five compositors in a reprint is probably not surprising when we recall that in the setting of a reprint, as McKerrow points out, "as many compositors as the printer could supply with type could be set to work at the same time." 4 But the use of this number of compositors in the production of this quarto is surprising in light of the fact that only one skeleton with one set of running-titles was used throughout its imposition. One-skeleton imposition is suggested by the pattern of the running-titles as follows: A3 v - B4 v - B3 v - C3 r - C4 r - D3 r - D4 r - E1 r - E2 r - F1 r - F2 r - G1 r - G2 r - H2 v - H1 v - I2 v - I1 v - K2 v - K1 v A4 r - B1 r - B2 r - C2 v - C1 v - D2 v - D1 v - E4 v - E3 v - F4 v - F3 v - G4 v - G3 v - H1 r - H2 r - I1 r - I2 r - K3 r - K4 r A4 v - B3 r - B4 r - C4 v - C3 v - D4 v - D3 v - E2 v - E1 v - F2 v - F1 v - G2 v - G1 v - H4 v - H3 v - I4 v - I3 v - K4 v - K3 v [HT] - B2 v - B1 v - C1 r - C2 r - D1 r - D2 r - E3 r - E4 r - F3 r - F4 r - G3 r - G4 r - H3 r - H4 r - I3 r - I4 r - K1 r - K2 r Normally the employment of five compositors would imply expedition in the setting; however, that speed of setting was not of paramount importance in this quarto is suggested not only by the use of one-skeleton but also by the apparent use of only one type-case throughout. 5 Even in Sheet B, set by two compositors, the setting was not simultaneous, for in this sheet three very distinctive types appear in both the outer and the inner formes. 6 Type from outer B (assuming that it was first through the press) was distributed in time for some of its characters to recur in the last two pages of inner B. Now, according to Mr. Bowers, one-skeleton printing, requiring the services of "only three men (the compositor, the pressman, and his assistant)" was "a desideratum for a small shop or for a shop engaged in various pieces of work on more than one press. It would seem that this matter of available labour (and occasionally available presses) may have dictated the custom of one skeleton. . . ." 7 When the amount of work issued by Matthewes in 1622 is considered, it would seem that these matters were of considerable concern to him. He evidently had two presses prior to 1623, for on 5 July 1623 he was allowed only one and was ordered by the Court of the Stationer's Company to "take downe one of his presses and bring it into the hall. . . ." 8 Moreover, the amount of work issued by him in 1622 was enough to keep a fairly large shop with several workmen fully engaged. The Short-Title Catalogue identifies no fewer than eighteen editions as having been issued by him in that year. Among these are ten octavos, five quartos, and two substantially large folios (STC 7229, The Second Part of Polyalbion , and STC 17332, Five Decades of Epistles of Warre ). Some of this work, of course, may have been started a year (or even two) previous to 1622, but several of the items must have been produced concurrently with A Faire Quarrell , Q2. The point is that Matthewes' workmen and his presses were busily engaged during this time. 9 Thus it seems likely that the printing of A Faire Quarrell went forward concurrently with some of this other work and that one-skeleton imposition was made necessary by the engagement of the presses and the burden of the workload. The occurrence of the duplication error suggests a lapse of attention on somebody's part, doubtless due in large part to the shifting of compositors, but also perhaps in some degree due to an interval in the printing. 10 Another anomaly in the printing of this quarto, growing out of the duplication blunder, demonstrates that not a great deal of attention was lavished on its production. As mentioned above, Q2 is a reprint of the second issue of Q1. This second issue has a cancellans title-page and a new scene, consisting of three leaves, inserted after H3. The first two of the three added leaves are signed "H4" (with a note in black letter "Place this at the latter end of the fourth Act." beneath the signature) and "H3" respectively (the third leaf is unsigned). Thus the signatures in Sheet H are muddled, there being two H3's and two H4's, and of course an additional six pages of type must be added when the number of sheets required in the reprint is calculated. Even so, a reprint collating A-K 4 and providing forty leaves (Q1 has thirty-nine including the added six) should have been sufficient. The duplicating of two leaves in the reprint, however, complicated the situation, for now an additional page would be necessary if the reprint were to continue following the pagination of its copy. This fact was noted in Sheet H, apparently when the foreman or the compositor saw that H in Q1 consisted of seven leaves. Thus adjustments had to be made. One adjustment consisted of a lengthening of the composing stick measure from 87mm to 92mm, making it possible to reduce the number of lines required for prose passages and to squeeze short lines of verse dialogue together. In addition, the reprint, after Sheet H, has thirty-eight lines per page (thirty-nine on H4 v ), while the copy varies from thirty-five to thirty-eight (the majority being thirty-eight). With these adjustments and aided by the fact that K2 in the copy has only twenty-four lines and that K2 v is blank, the compositors of the later sheets in the reprint were able to gain about twenty-eight lines on the copy and to squeeze twenty-five pages into twenty-four, ending with a full page on K4 v . The adjustments noted above had another probable effect on the setting of the reprint. The setting of a normal page-for-page reprint could easily take place by formes, since the casting-off of copy would present no problem. And in the first sheets of A Faire Quarrell setting by formes was apparently the process used. The division of the copy noted in Sheet B is indicative of forme setting, and an analysis of type substitution ('VV' for 'W,' 'C' for ' C ') offers corroborative evidence in Sheets A, C, E, and H. However, type substitution suggests seriatim setting in Sheet K (two substitutions for "W" on K1, one on K1 v ). Since it is demonstrable that the casting-off process was complicated in the later sheets by the adjustment of the composing stick and by the number of lines per page, it is likely that the last few sheets were set seriatim. The analysis of the printing of this quarto suggests that the conditions prevailing in the shop of a job printer such as Matthewes were often unsettled and hectic. It is likely that the profit motive of such a printer led him to take in as much work as he possibly could get, which was at times more than he could reasonably and accurately deal with. Engaged in this commercial rush, workmen, with several jobs under way concurrently, were liable to commit blunders, such as the duplication error, that, though obvious, went unnoticed. Nor is it a matter of much surprise that such as mistake should occur in a reprint. It is likely that reprints were regarded as "simple" work and that many of the workmen involved in their production were neophytes or apprentices. For example, the habits of Compositor C noted above, his slavish following of copy spelling and his inability to set accurately even from printed copy, suggest that he may have been an apprentice. 11 In the 1620's the Court of the Stationers' Company several times ordered Matthewes to "put away" apprentices over the number allotted to him. 12 Considering the amount of work issued by Matthewes in 1622, it is certain that he had need of all the hands he could muster, experienced or not.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">A major source for the history of the reign of Queen Anne is The History of the Reign of Queen Anne Digested into Annals (1703-13) by the indefatigable Abel Boyer. Everything about this work suggests that Boyer thought he was writing for the ages. The format is attractive, the style is dignified and objective, and the detail is considerable. The activities of the ministry and the parliament are given elaborate treatment—bills are summarized, speeches are often quoted apparently verbatim, memorials to the Queen and her responses are reported, and the engagements of British forces in Europe are carefully chronicled, complete with battle maps and lists of casualties (officers by name, and enlisted men by numbers). Appendices to each volume add yet more detail. Although Boyer's Whig bias is apparent (though not as apparent in the early volumes as in the last ones), Boyer is a skillful enough propagandist to present the reader with both sides of the issue—what slanting there is is subtle. Typographically the volumes have an air of permanence, and though the page is crowded, marginal glosses cue the reader to the substance of the material. The dedicatees include Harley and Godolphin, the Dukes of Somerset and Ormonde, the Earl of Portland, and Prince Eugene of Savoy. The volumes were issued annually, in the spring, covering the events of the previous year. The slimmest volume runs to nearly three hundred pages and the fattest runs to over five hundred. Despite the air of finality that hangs over this venture, Boyer decided in 1705 to stop the press and add a considerable body of new material which necessitated reimposition of some pages, rearrangement of the signature letters, and repagination. The first issue of the 1705 volume 1 (for 1704) collates as follows: A 4 B-S 8 T 4 , 2 A-E 8 F 2 ; pagination [viii] 1-112 97-112 repeated 113-264, 2 1-76 [viii] [104 mispaged 101, 107 mispaged 1]. The second issue collates: A 4 B-Z 8 , 2A-B 8 2C 2 ; pagination: [viii] 1-284, 2 1-96 [viii] [128 mispaged 188, 255 mispaged 455]. The two volumes are in the same setting of type and the alignment is remarkably well kept even where changes are made. Three additions occur in the second issue: an addition in the middle of the text expanding material on the Aylesbury election issue, and, near the end, immediately preceding the table of contents, an attack on the tack or rider attached to the Occasional Conformity Bill, and an exposé of the Duke of Orford's covetousness. The first change occurs beginning with sig. O2 v (p. 196 in the second issue, 180 in the first) and runs on to sig. O5 v , which necessitates switching the rectos and versos from sig. O6 v to sig. S5 r , after which begins a new section of subject matter. Also, beginning with sig. O2 r two lines are added to the bottom of the page from the top of the following page to the point where the new material begins, to accommodate it and to avoid rearrangement after O6 v . The other additions come together near the end, at sig. 2A5 v -2B6 v (pp. 77ff, second series), followed by the "Contents," identical in both issues except for the signature letter. The reimposition also gave the printer the occasion to correct the pagination. The reasons for two of these additions are obvious. The Aylesbury men were much in the news in the closing weeks of 1704. The case began during the General Election of 1700 when the Tory mayor of Aylesbury struck several Whigs off the voting register, including a cobbler named Ashby. Lord Wharton's interests considered this an affront, and persuaded Ashby to bring an action, which resulted in his being restored by the Assize Court. This was a direct challenge to the House of Commons, the members of which (at least the Tory members) held that no law court had jurisdiction in any electoral matter. The case of cobbler Ashby became a matter of dispute for years. It was argued that, while election petitions were indeed exclusively in the domain of the House of Commons, an individual's right to vote was a piece of his property, and that he could not be deprived of property without the right of recourse to the courts. Ashby was upheld by the House of Lords as the Supreme Court of Appeal. Flushed with victory, in the winter of 1704 Wharton put up five more humble citizens to sue for their voting rights in the courts, an act which infuriated the Commons. These litigants were promptly called to the Bar of the House and arrested on warrants signed by a presumably reluctant Speaker Harley. In Newgate, they were entertained by Whig supporters to the extent that the government had them moved to a less accessible place of confinement. The case of the Aylesbury men was not really resolved. The proroguing of Parliament in March 1705 freed the prisoners, and neither party wished to revive the case in the next session. But in December 1704 the case occupied the attention of all Englishmen, and Boyer, in the early spring of 1705, saw that he had not given the affair as much detailed attention as it merited. 2 The second addition is a separate section entitled "An Answer to Mr. B -----'s Speech. In Relation to the Conformity Bill and Tack. In a Letter to a Friend." This relates to the efforts of the high church Tories to attach as a rider or tack the very important Land Tax bill to the Occasional Conformity bill. The Land Tax bill was essential to raise revenues for the war effort and especially for the support of England's allies, and by threatening it, the Tories threatened the ministry itself. The several attempts to tack the Occasional Conformity bill begin in the fall of 1704 and engender a great deal of heat in all political quarters through 1705. Defoe in his Review returns again and again to the subject. 3 John Toland contributed a poem, The Tackers (1705), to the cause. Even Thomas Hearne, in his academic ivy-tower in Oxford, records a poem defending the tack. 4 Eventually, the tack was defeated. The "Mr. B-----" of Boyer's address is Bromley, who stood for the tack and was later defeated for the speakership because of his stand. Boyer first attacks the Occasional Conformity bill and then the tack, with a lofty dignity we occasionally get from Swift but not from the Review . Boyer ends his case with the words of the Queen herself on the prospect of a lasting peace, "if we do not disappoint it by our own Unreasonable Humours and Animosity" (p. 90). Here again Boyer underestimated the value of a news event. The third addition to the volume is an attack on Edward Russell, Earl of Orford, one of the most powerful and certainly the least loved member of the Whig junto. Unlike his associates and especially unlike Charles Montagu, Lord Halifax, Orford had neither social graces nor administrative ability, but he was a ruthless politician with a strong following, especially in the Navy, and he returned again and again to power after humiliating setbacks. In 1701 he was impeached for his part in the Partition Treaty but the matter came to nothing. Orford was a notorious Jacobite and in the reign of William his defeat of the French fleet was twice blessed—because he won and because doubts about his loyalty were so strong that many believed he would refuse to fight. In 1704 he was accused of profiteering in commissary accounts while Treasurer of the Navy, and it is on this issue that Boyer attacks him. The piece is entitled " The Appointments of Edward R----l, Esq ; ( now E--- of O----) when he was Ad---l of the Blue, and Ad---l of the F----t explained, and set in a clearer View ." There follow four and a half pages (pp. 92-96) listing items of income paid Orford from the Treasury and elsewhere to a total of £293,615, without editorial comment, but certainly giving us a "clearer View." There are various reasons why Boyer might have attacked Orford, even though he was a Whig. He was generally unliked and a strange bedfellow to the others of the junto. William Shippen in Faction Display'd (1704) 5 characterizes him as " Triton , who like the vast Leviathan , | Long wallow'd in the Treasures of the Main." But a specific incitement for Boyer and other Whigs may have been the occasion of Orford and the other members of the junto dining with Queen Anne on 7 April 1705. Boyer may have felt that the Whig cause was in danger of a compromise with the ministry. This conjecture depends on when Boyer's second issue was published, but I have been unable to find any conclusive evidence here. The Annals is advertised early in April 1705, 6 but it is not apparent whether this is the first or second issue. It would be interesting to collate a number of sets of Boyer's History of the Reign of Queen Anne and similar multi-volume works to determine whether or not changes were regularly made during the press run as they so often are with briefer works, but even research libraries do not feel compelled to gather multiple copies of such works, and such a project must await either a wandering scholar or a group effort.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">John Warburton as Antiquary and Collector: Evidence from the Sale Catalogue of his Collection by Michael D. Bliss</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Warburton (1682-1759) is today remembered as the bumbling fool who collected some fifty manuscript plays and later "lodgd them" with his servant (apparently his cook), who either burned or "put under Pye bottoms" all but three of them. However, he was, as we might expect, very differently regarded by his contemporaries who knew nothing of the burned plays. They viewed him with a substantial, if at times grudging and somewhat qualified, respect; the record of his antiquarian and collecting activities provides a more precise definition of the quality of this respect. For a more objective view of Warburton as antiquary and collector, though, we should be happy to know specifically the scope and nature of his collection. John Nichols reports that at the time of his death Warburton had amassed "an amazing collection of MSS, books, prints, &amp;c. relating to the History and Antiquities of England, which were sold by auction, after his death, in 1759." 1 The catalogue of this sale, which would give us just such a view, seems to have dropped out of sight early in the nineteenth century. Joseph Haslewood published a brief "extract" from it in 1807 in connection with his notice of Warburton's list of destroyed plays, 2 but there appear to be no later accounts. When W. W. Greg came to consider the question of Warburton's list in his classic essay, "The Bakings of Betsy," 3 he was unable to find a copy of the catalogue and had to rely on what information Haslewood provided. Similarly John Freehafer, whose recent paper in Studies in Bibliography argues for the credibility of Warburton's story, makes no use of the sale catalogue, although in his conclusion Freehafer rather misleadingly suggests that he has made "a new examination of Warburton's list, memorandum, sale catalogue and surviving manuscripts." 4 Most recently, Anne Lancashire, in a note correcting Freehafer's argument that Edmond Malone had examined Warburton's list as early as 1778, quotes briefly from the sale catalogue, but only to show that it, rather than Warburton's list, was Malone's source for information on Warburton's collection. 5 There are, however, at least five copies of the Warburton sale catalogue in libraries and private collections here and in England; 6 from it we may gain a more exact view than has been hitherto available of Warburton's interests as a collector of literary texts and manuscripts. In his early life Warburton was a minor civil servant (an exciseman), and in 1720 was appointed to the office of Somerset Herald, 7 a position of genteel duties and impressive opportunities for income, which he held for the rest of his life. He was thus enabled to indulge himself in that modern passion which had its beginnings in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, collecting, and it was as a collector and antiquary that Warburton was known in his own day. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society (1719) 8 and the Society of Antiquaries (1720); he assembled a considerable collection of manuscripts and antiquities; and he published a number of local maps based on actual surveys (1716-49), and at least two books. The earlier book, London and Middlesex Illustrated (1749), is a defense of some five hundred coats of arms which he had included in the border of his most recent map; the arms, belonging mostly to merchants and tradesmen, had been attacked as illegitimate. Warburton here sets out his evidence for the authenticity of these arms. Thus his purpose was both to vindicate himself and, as he points out in his preface, to democratize arms, to attack those who hold that "trade and gentility" are incompatible (Preface, p. iii). The whole force of the work is revealing of Warburton himself, for it is a document of the new classlessness that yet above all aspires to class. Warburton's antiquarian interests reflect the same pattern, for such tastes were, especially in the first quarter of the century, the tastes of men of wealth and title, like Robert Harley, Queen Anne's minister and Earl of Oxford. 9 The second book, Vallum Romanum: or the History of the Roman Wall . . . in Cumberland and Northumberland (1753), was, in fact, a thorough plagiarism of John Horsley's Britannia Romana; or, the Roman Antiquities of Britain (1732), a book regarded with great respect by modern archeologists. 10 Warburton claims to have participated with Horsley in the original researches—and he may well have—but the extent of the plagiarism is nearly total, whereas Warburton acknowledges only a modest dependence. There are also two items of Warburton apocrypha, both printed well after his death, and both of a narrowly antiquarian interest: Some Account of the Alien Priories (1779), a catalogue of the 146 Norman priories in England until the time of Henry V, and A Treatise on the History, Laws, and Customs of the Island of Guernsey (1822). Warburton's hand in both these works is, at best, doubtful; but it is revealing of Warburton's reputation as an antiquary that he should have been regarded as a possible author, and one who would bring credit to the works as well. Even sixty years after his death it apparently made sense to refer to him as "the celebrated Antiquary" (as he is called in the Guernsey volume, by an editor who knows almost nothing else about him). Since no one has ever taken the time to do so, let me say what can be briefly said on these two books. Our impression of Warburton depends on understanding such matters. The original issue of the Alien Priories (1779) was anonymous, the publisher (John Nichols) asserting he was "not at liberty to mention the author's name." A re-issue (1786) bore a new title page: "collected from the MSS. of J. W. and D r Ducarel." Andrew Ducarel, a well-known antiquary who had been born in Normandy, had many connections with Nichols (one of his works is advertised as in press at the end of the 1779 volume) and with B. J. Pouncy, who did the engravings for the book. He also had a clear interest in Normandy and had published a number of books in ecclesiastical history; Warburton, so far as we know, had no such interests, and if he had any part in the book it must have been very small. Nichols later seems to testify that Warburton had no part in the work: in a long biographical footnote on Warburton in his Literary Anecdotes (1812-1815, VI, 142) he mentions the two acknowledged publications and concludes that "these, with some prints, are the whole of his publications." Presumably the phrase of the 1786 title page, "collected from the MSS. of J. W.," best describes Warburton's involvement; perhaps Ducarel used MSS formerly in Warburton's collection, but not by Warburton. It is still puzzling, though, that Nichols should have attached Warburton's name to the volume in such a way as to suggest that his share was equal to Ducarel's, for it is fairly certain that the book is substantially Ducarel's work. The Guernsey treatise was published more than sixty years after Warburton's death, and although the editor is vague on just who Warburton was and when he lived, he clearly imagines that the name is not wholly forgotten and will add some glow of authority to the work. The treatise, he writes, was "drawn up by Mr. Warburton, a Herald and celebrated Antiquary in Charles II's reign. It bears the date of 1682" (p. 1). This study could not be by Warburton; first, it is a wholly anonymous work, without the little interjections of ego that characterize Warburton, and second, there is no other evidence of his interest in the Channel Islands. It seems more likely that the book was printed from a manuscript owned by Warburton, which thus had his name on it. The date (1682, the year of Warburton's birth) probably stood in the manuscript, and thus led the editor to place Warburton's career in the reign of Charles II (who died in 1685). The date, however, seems to be wrong, since a list in the text (p. 52) goes down to 1713. Could the date of Warburton's birth have been written in by Warburton himself, or by a subsequent owner? Or was it the date of composition, with the later years in the list having been written in by Warburton? No real conclusion is possible, or necessary. What we are interested in is Warburton's reputation, and from these two books, neither probably written by Warburton, we can conclude that he must have been regarded as a man who might have written them. From what little we know, then, a curious portrait emerges. Warburton seems to have been both a successful and even admired antiquary and, at the same time, a somewhat foolish and disagreeable character. In 1720, when he was only thirty-eight, Warburton's collection of manuscripts and antiquities was important enough to interest Humfrey Wanley, the self-taught scholar of Middle English who was in charge of the great library then being formed by Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford. Wanley offered 100 guineas for a part of the collection; Warburton asked for 300, "a price," wrote Wanley, "in my poor Opinion, by much too horribly exorbitant to be complied with." 11 Warburton then pretended that he had another offer, and, that failing, attempted a second approach. Wanley has preserved an account of it: 13 July 1720. M r Warburton came to me at the Genoa-Armes, &amp; then took me to another Tavern, &amp; kept me up all the Night, thinking to Muddle me &amp; so to gain upon me in Selling his MSS. &amp;c. But the Contrary happened, &amp; he induced to Agree to accept of the Sum he offered at the first, without the Advancement of a single Farthing: and he promised to bring them to me, on the Fourteenth by Six a Clock. 14 July 1720. M r Warburton wrote to me that he was so disorder'd by OUR late Frolic (which, by the way, was all his Own) that he could not bring the Things till the Fifteenth by Six a Clock. ( Diary , I, 57) Thus Wanley, who clearly had no great respect for Warburton personally—he elsewhere calls him "extremely greedy, fickle, &amp; apt to go from his Word" ( Diary , I, 56)—was nonetheless happy to acquire for his patron important material which Warburton had managed to collect—a number of manuscripts, two pictures, and "some Brass-pieces of Antiquitie." This theme of Warburton's personal unpleasantness as contrasted with his value as a collector turns up elsewhere. Among the Lansdowne manuscripts is a journal and a collection of drawings made by Warburton during a surveying trip in Yorkshire in 1718-19. The journal itself is of no great value, although it does give us a view of Warburton's tastes and interests. It reveals, in fact, something close to the virtuoso that Pope would soon be satirizing. A typical entry records Warburton's visit to Sir Henry Marwood, Bar t , who received me with y e greatest respect, and gave me a very agreable entertainment in the sight of his fine apartment, painting, shells, coins, and other curiositys. 12 The nineteenth-century editor of this journal obesrves that Warburton's "Latin is generally unintelligible, and his remarks on places and persons very jejune and uninforming" (p. 62), and yet goes on to emphasize the very great historical value of the more than 360 drawings of "gentlemen's seats and places of interest in Yorkshire" which accompany the journal. Francis Grose (1731?-1791), the lexicographer of the vulgar tongue, has also recorded his impressions of Warburton, whom he regarded as a scoundrel. "He had little or no education, being not only ignorant of the Latin, but incapable of writing two sentences in good English. All the publications under his name, both books and maps, were done by others hired by him." 13 But then, Grose was an acerbic man; in his biographical notes on Dr. Johnson he tells with considerable emphasis the story of Johnson's delivering to his publisher already printed material for the Dictionary in order to get a second payment (p. 161). Warburton was frequently on bad terms with his colleagues in the College of Arms, 14 and we can guess why. He seems to have been vain and self-important, and yet at the same time obsequious before the rich, the powerful, and the titled. His position as Herald is symbolic of his parvenu aspirations, as was his collecting. As an antiquarian, however, he seems to have gained a considerable reputation, in spite of the wholesale plagiarism involved in his single antiquarian publication. No doubt his collection counted for nearly all of this reputation; Humfrey Wanley's Diary shows continuing interest in Warburton and his antiquities right up to 1726, the year of Wanley's death, when he returned a batch of manuscripts to Warburton asking him "to deferre his offer of Selling the same unto my Lord, for some longer time." 15 Thus, in spite of the poor character which all commentators agree in giving Warburton, 16 he was an effective and successful collector. The judgment of Mark Noble, the early-nineteenth-century historian of the College of Arms, is typical in striking this balance. "Impartiality has compelled me to give what I find relative to a character which I admire for his love of science, and detest for his dishonesty and querulous scurrility." 17 The sale of Warburton's collection after his death occupied six days, beginning on Monday, 19 November, and comprised 764 lots. It was not, then, a huge collection, and was perhaps more notable for its curiosity than its size. Some thirty-three volumes of manuscripts from this sale found their way into what we now know as the Lansdowne collection, but since William Fitzmaurice Petty (became Lord Shelburne 1761, created Marquis of Lansdowne in 1784) did not begin collecting books until 1765, 18 and was in fact probably abroad during November 1759, 19 it is not likely that he purchased the volumes directly at the Warburton sale. In fact, it has recently been revealed that the Grolier Club's copy of the Warburton sale catalogue contains an auctioneer's invoice for various lots sold to Philip Carteret Webb. 20 One of the lots is #212—now MS Lansdowne 807, the volume containing the remnants of Warburton's play collection, his list, and his memorandum describing the destruction of the balance of the collection. Since Webb's widow is known to have sold some manuscripts to Lord Shelburne after Webb's death in 1771, 21 it is fairly certain that Webb was the intermediate owner of the Warburton manuscripts now in the Lansdowne collection. In any case, the present MS Lansdowne 807 was in Shelburne's hands by 1780, when it is so described by a correspondent (George Steevens) in the St. James's Chronicle for May of that year. 22 James West, later President of the Royal Society and a collector and antiquary of some note, has been more than once suggested as this intermediate purchaser, 23 but that suggestion was never more than speculation. In 1805 Lansdowne died and, after some protracted negotiations, Parliament in 1807 voted 4,925 pounds to purchase his manuscript collection for the British Museum, where it is now housed. 24 At the Warburton sale in 1759 MS Lansdowne 807 was purchased for only 14/- 25 by Philip Carteret Webb, who apparently later sold it to Lord Shelburne, in whose hands it was to become familiar to literary scholars. However, although this volume of dramatic manuscripts is today the thing most often associated with the name of John Warburton and his "amazing collection," it was in no way characteristic of that collection. As we have seen, as early as 1720 Humfrey Wanley purchased twenty-two items from Warburton's collection for the library of Robert Harley. The Harleian collection was largely historical in emphasis—at the time of its dispersal (1743) it contained some 27,000 manuscripts of which 14,000 were charters. 26 And, in fact, Wanley's list of the volumes purchased from Warburton for this collection shows a similar balance, with perhaps rather more than usual in the way of religious items. There is only a single literary title, "S r John Gowers English Poem's, Illum. &amp; Adorned with the Armes of divers Families," 27 and one at least half suspects that Warburton's interest was more in the arms than the verse. Further, Wanley mentions Warburton at several other points in the Diary , concerning charters (II, 406), "a MS. relating to Waltham-Abbey" (I, 130), and an "Heraldic MS" (I, 71). A similar emphasis is apparent in the Warburton sale catalogue. The library, comprising some 764 lots, 28 is advertised by Paterson as Containing a valuable Collection in Manuscript and Print, towards a particular History, Natural, Ecclesiastical and Civil, of every County in England; together with a great Number of Original Visitations, Pedigrees, Ordinaries, Gifts, Grants, and Alphabets of Arms, and other Heraldic Manuscripts;/ Also his Collection of Prints, Copper Plates, Coins, and other Curiosities. The sale was conducted over six days, with the last two given over to the County Collections described by Paterson. These last two parts account for some 180 lots, leaving something under 600 to be disposed of in the first four days. Of these, some 278 consisted of printed books. This collection of printed books again reflects Warburton's historical, topographical, and heraldic interests, although there are a half-dozen books on painting and the fine arts and perhaps twice as many of literary interest. These latter are about evenly divided between books of contemporary literature and editions of classic writers. In the first group we find Denham's Poems (1704), Cowley's Works (1674), Howard's Plays (1700), and Dryden's Virgil (1709); in the second, Gavin Douglas's Aeneid (1553), Sandys' Ovid's Metamorphoses (1640), and "Chaucer's Works, printed by Caxton, imperfect ." Three more titles, less easily categorized, are "The History of George a Green, Pindar of Wakefield, 1706" (the prose romance, 29 not the play printed 1599), Phineas Fletcher's Purple Island (1633), and "Plays and Poems, 4 vol." The last item immediately precedes Fletcher's Purple Island , but that circumstance gives us no help in identifying it. Of course it must be in part dramatic, and thus it comprises all the dramatic works to be found amongst this collection of printed books. Manuscripts, together with prints, drawings, copperplates, coins and medals, and "Sundry Curiosities" account for the more than 300 lots remaining, and of this number the great bulk are manuscripts, regularly divided by the cataloguer into "Heraldic" and "Miscellaneous." Again we find mostly historical and topographical works in the "Miscellaneous" category, although occasionally the lots are strangely various. Thus lot #103 includes Poems of William Browne of the Middle Temple, Gent. 1650, 4to—The three Establishments concerning the Pay of the Sea Officers, 4to—Anonymi Poemata, Gr. &amp; Lat.—A Letter from a Country Clergyman to a Citizen in London, 4to—[and so on; there are no more literary items] Besides this lot there are perhaps eleven more of literary interest and, although they form only a small part of this collection of manuscripts, they deserve to be given in full for the light they shed on Warburton's interests as a collector of literary manuscripts. 204.

A Poem, inscribed to Sir Julius Caesar, by Henry Skipwith, 4to. *328. The Christian Hero, a Tragedy 1734, 4to These manuscripts are perhaps most distinguished by their miscellaneous nature; very little in the way of pattern or intention is apparent. Rather Warburton seems to have acquired what he could find. For instance, lots #214 and #319 represent a large group of manuscripts "of the late [d. 1726] Capt. John Stevens," most of which were catalogued together among the lots sold on the third day. 33 It seems likely that Warburton acquired them as a group, just as he must surely have acquired the fifteen volumes of William Tipping's poems (#213). Where literary manuscripts were concerned, then, Warburton seems not to have been a connoisseur, assiduously and patiently seeking out any scraps that might add to his knowledge and store, but rather more simply a collector of curiosities, and it is in this latter light that his collection of manuscript plays ought properly to be seen. The evidence of the sale catalogue also makes plain another point: it is not true, as is often assumed, that MS Lansdowne 807 represents the only dramatic manuscripts in Warburton's collection. In 1759 there were four more manuscript plays: #209, an untitled tragedy, #210, Demetrius and Marsina , #211, The Tyrant , and #*328, The Christian Hero . The untitled "Romance," #208, is almost certainly not dramatic. The term "romance" has been applied to plays only in this century and, further, this MS fetched only one shilling, while the three plays immediately following it each realized nearly three times that amount. Two of these four plays have substantial earlier histories, and one, The Tyrant , is included on Warburton's list of lost plays. It is there ascribed to Massinger, suggesting one of three possibilities: (1) that Warburton was more expert at finding information in manuscripts than were the compilers of the sale catalogue, (2) that the manuscript he recorded had suffered loss or damage resulting in the obliteration of Massinger's name by 1759, or (3) that there were two manuscripts of the play in his collection. Simplicity favors the first two possibilities. Joseph Haslewood, who as we have seen published an account of the Lansdowne volume, also examined Warburton's sale catalogue and printed from it the descriptions of lots #208-212. In his discussion of The Tyrant he remarks that "there is little doubt of its still being in existence." 34 In spite of this optimism (Haslewood gives no other grounds for his statement) the manuscript has not come to light in the intervening one hundred and sixty odd years. The Tyrant , also attributed to Massinger, is included in Humphrey Moseley's 1660 entry in the Stationers' Register of 26 plays, including nine which he had entered before. This list includes three manuscripts surviving today, The Faithful Friends, Believe as You List , and The Soddered Citizen , and the fact that a fourth title still existed in 1759 gives this group of plays an unusually high survival rate. It is likely that this group of 26 plays went from Moseley through some unknown intermediaries to Warburton in a block. The Christian Hero by George Lillo was first performed at Drury Lane in January 1734/5 and was published twice, in octavo, in 1735. Both its late date and its separation from the other dramatic manuscripts in the catalogue suggest that it is independent of the latter. Demetrius and Marsina is wholly unknown, and probably has nothing to do with Fletcher's Demetrius and Enanthe, or the Humorous Lieutenant (1619). The subtitle rather suggests a Restoration than a Jacobean or Caroline play, although such impressions cannot be given much weight. The play was no doubt based on the impostor who claimed to be Demetrius, the son of the Czar Ivan, and usurped the Russian throne in 1605-6; thus it cannot be earlier than this. The fourth dramatic manuscript, a titleless tragedy, can only tell us how often title pages were lost. Warburton's collection of books and manuscripts, as it is represented by his sale catalogue, was, as we should have expected, largely historical, topographical, and heraldic in emphasis. 35 Literary materials formed a small part, and the evidence suggests that Warburton's interest in dramatic manuscripts was a limited one. The collection as a whole, though, is eminently respectable, demonstrating, particularly in the County Collections, considerable thoroughness and care. Warburton's library shows us that his contemporary reputation as an antiquary was not undeserved, while some of the more recent epithets applied to the "pie-eating Somerset Herald" perhaps are.</field>

Copies of this catalogue are now held by Houghton Library at Harvard, the Grolier Club, the British Museum (two copies, in the Departments of MSS. and Coins and Medals), and the estate of the late Dr. A. N. L. Munby. The disposition of this copy has not, at the moment of writing, been ascertained. None has the buyer's name against the literary material, although Dr. Munby's copy has prices and the Grolier Club copy includes an invoice for various lots sold to Philip Carteret Webb. It is incorrectly indexed in the British Museum's List of Catalogues of English Book Sales, 1676-1900, Now in the British Museum (1915) and is unaccountably omitted from the huge British Museum Catalogue of Printed Books (1960-1966). For notice of these copies of Warburton's Sale Catalogue I am obliged to W. H. Bond, A. N. L. Munby, and H. M. Nixon. 7 The College of Arms, organized by Richard III, included the Earl Marshall, three Kings of Arms, six Heralds (of which Warburton was one), and four Pursuivants. The purpose of the College was to regulate the use of arms; this power was often abused, especially in an era of a new social mobility and economic change. Heralds were appointed by the Monarch, for life. Warburton's title, "Somerset," reflects the historical origin of his position; he always resided in London, in apartments at the College of Arms (L. G. Pine, The Genealogist's Encylopedia [1969], pp. 198-200). 8 The number of fellows was limited to 55, plus university professors and nobility. 9 Seymour de Ricci, English Collectors of Books and Manuscripts (1930), p. 35. 10 See J. Collingwood Bruce, The Hand-book to the Roman Wall , p. 2. The two most recent editions of this classic guide-book, edited respectively by two of the great names in British archeology, R. G. Collingwood (1933) and Ian Richmond (1952), are united in their regard for Horsley and scorn of Warburton. A copy of Horsley's book was among those sold at Warburton's death in 1759 (lot #102). 11 C.

I am not certain whether this is a polite rejection of inferior material or simply a reflection of Wanley's very poor health at the time (31 March 1726). He died on 6 July 1726. 16 There is one apparently dissident voice: the remark of William Hutton (another contributor to the literature on the Roman wall) on Warburton's "veracity" ( The History of the Roman Wall , 1802, p. x), is cited as character witness in the DNB article on Warburton, and is repeated by John Freehafer, p. 158. But Hutton is no proper judge; his is not an antiquarian book, but a record of a walking tour, and it is apparent from his one other reference to Warburton (p. 325) that he simply regards him as dull and academic ("a dry husk"). Since he apparently never realized that Warburton was simply reprinting Horsley in a changed order, his special commendation of Warburton simply points up his ignorance. 17 Cited by Nichols, VI, 142n.

This life is in fact closer to a political history, and unfortunately for our purposes makes virtually no reference to Lansdowne's collecting interests. 19 He served in the battles of Minden (August 1759) and Kloster Kampen (October 1760), and was probably abroad between these times as well ( Life , I, 82). 20 Anne Lancashire, op. cit. , p. 248n. 21 DNB , XX, 1019; cited by Lancashire, p. 248n. 22 Cited by Malone, Shakespeare (1790), I, ii, 71-72n. There is a notation on the flyleaf of the Lansdowne volume, "Rec'd 1803," which must reflect some aspect of the volume's history during Lansdowne's ownership, but what I cannot say. For the identification of the correspondence see Lancashire, pp. 242-243. 23 For instance by Freehafer, op. cit. , p. 161. 24 Until Parliament voted these funds it was intended that the collection of MSS would be sold, and Leigh and Sotheby had already printed their sale catalogue ( Bibliotheca Manuscripta Lansdowniana ) in the early spring of 1807. Warburton's volume figures there as lot #849. The sale was postponed, and the money was paid in October 1807 (Greg, Collected Papers , p. 50, n.2). 25 Dr. A. N. L. Munby kindly provided me with prices from his copy of the Warburton sale catalogue. 26 Seymour de Ricci, op. cit. , p. 35. 27 Diary , I, 58. 28 Many of the lot numbers are duplicated, with asterisks, presumably to accommodate items that came to hand late. As a result there are significantly more than 764 lots in the sale. 29 Printed by W. J. Thoms, Early English Prose Romances , second edition (1858), II, 139-215. 30 Lots #208-211 fetched 1/-, 2/9, 3/-, and 3/3 respectively. 31 Although quarto format is unusual for pre-Restoration play manuscripts, it is far from unprecedented. Other dramatic manuscripts in quarto include Tancred and Ghismonda (c. 1600), five MSS of Middleton's Game at Chess (1624-5), Middleton's Witch (1620-7), Lord Harlech's MS of Fletcher's Demetrius &amp; Enanthe (1625), Wilson's Swisser (c. 1631), Cavendish's Country Captain (c. 1635), The Cyprian Conqueror (c. 1640?), and Wild's Benefice (c. 1641). The last is, of course, included in the Lansdowne volume and thus was presumably once part of Warburton's collection. See Greg, Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses (1931), pp. 356-365. 32 The Duke of Buckingham is, of course, a misunderstanding of "G. Buc.", signature of George Buc, Master of the Revels in 1611, whose license stands on the last leaf of this manuscript. 33 Stevens, who flourished from 1695-1726, was a Spanish scholar and translator as well as an antiquary of considerable learning and reputation. He wrote or translated several dozen books. 34 Brydges, ed., p. 277. 35 On 5 July 1799 there was a second sale of Warburton material by Thomas King, this almost forty years after Warburton's death. The catalogue describes the collection as a "Heraldic Library." It comprised 464 lots, sold on two days; 1-405 are printed books, 406-432 manuscripts, 433-455 Warburton's own manuscripts, and 456-464 maps (I am obliged to Mr. Godfrey Davis of the British Museum's Department of Manuscripts for notice of this catalogue, the only one known). I have not seen this 1799 catalogue, which came to my attention after the research for this study was completed, and so am unable to determine whether the sale represents new material, or material from the 1759 sale being resold. There is also a puzzling tradition of still another sale, in 1766. This date is given by Nichols ( Literary Anecdotes , III [1812], 618), who elsewhere gives 1759 as the date of the sale, and he has been followed (apparently) by the editors of Humfrey Wanley's Diary . Further, the article in Literary Anecdotes which gives this date, "The Progress of Selling Books by Catalogues" by Richard Gough, is a revision of an account which appeared in The Gentleman's Magazine , LVIII (1788), 1065-1069, where the same date is given. This could all be a mistake, but since library holdings of early auction catalogues are far from complete, we cannot decide the matter with confidence.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">"When this marvellous library is finally housed in the white marble building in Washington, it will arouse the enthusiasm of scholars. No one knows today exactly what it contains. There will be surprises innumerable. Hidden in the profound depths of this collection there will be, I am sure, much new material. . . ." A. S. W. Rosenbach, "Henry C. Folger as a Collector," Henry C. Folger , 18 June 1857 11 June 1930 (New Haven, 1931), p. 105. Among the treasures hidden until now at the Folger Shakespeare Library is a set of the Gentleman's Magazine which for many years was maintained by the editors as a special file copy. 1 Evidence gathered from several collections of Nichols family documents and other sources makes it possible to trace the passage of this important run of volumes through successive generations of the family and through the subsequent owners, an English provincial book dealer and the Renaissance scholar Dr. T. N. Brushfield, into the hands of Henry C. Folger. The volumes in this collection contain extensive editorial annotation, including identifications of hundreds of the magazine's anonymous contributors. Tipped or bound into many volumes are manuscript letters, color drawings for the engraved plates, the original wrappers of monthly numbers, copies of pamphlets and booksellers' catalogues, and other materials related to the magazine's publication. Because this set of volumes served as the file in which the Nichols family collected such documentation, it possesses unique evidential value for scholarship on the history of the Gentleman's Magazine and constitutes a major source of information which has not hitherto been utilized in scholarship on the literary history of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The connection between the Nichols family and the Gentleman's Magazine spanned three-quarters of a century. In 1778, John Nichols (1745-1826) purchased a half-interest in the proprietorship from the heir of Richard Cave, the founder's nephew. 2 David Henry remained the nominal editor until he officially made over the position and its salary to Nichols in 1791. 3 Nichols, however, had long since assumed most of the responsibilities of management, and it was fully appropriate that those who corresponded with him during the 1780's referred to the Gentleman's as "your magazine." 4 His son, John Bowyer Nichols (1779-1863), joined the firm in 1796, and "among his duties, from an early age, was that of assisting in the editorship of this Magazine. . . ." 5 John Gough Nichols (1806-1873) entered the business in 1824. After his grandfather's death, he began "to take an active part in the editorial management of The Gentleman's Magazine , to which he had already been an occasional contributor" ( Memoir , p. 5). The professional pattern of three successive generations in the Nichols family thus reflects a high degree of continuity, and after the death of John Nichols there was to be no lessening of the family's involvement in the affairs of the magazine. In 1833, in fact, Bowyer Nichols acquired all the shares in the proprietorship which had remained outside the family, though he left the editorial duties to his son and other associates. 6 J. G. Nichols edited the magazine alone from 1851 until the middle of 1856, when his father sold it to John Henry Parker ( Memoir , p. 16). Although the family officially ended its association with the Gentleman's Magazine at that time, its identification with the history of this periodical could scarcely be terminated. Among the works first featured by Parker when he assumed control was J. G. Nichols' "Autobiography of Sylvanus Urban," a long account of the magazine up to 1754, 7 and today the scholar who wishes to study the history of the Gentleman's will find that the extant collections of Nichols family papers are among the primary resources. John Nichols' entrance into the magazine's affairs is perhaps nowhere better illustrated than in the increasing number of references to him among the annotations in volumes at the Folger. Volume XLIX (1779) reveals with singular immediacy the early details of Nichols' part in publishing the Gentleman's Magazine , for throughout this volume his name and that of David Bond are written on the first pages of the sheets which they respectively printed. Bond had been printing the magazine for several years under his lease of David Henry's printing shop at St. John's Gate. 8 In June, 1778, Henry informed Bond that Nichols would be printing half of each monthly number until the lease expired in 1780, since Nichols now owned that proportion of the proprietorship. Because the control of folding and stitching had come to Nichols with the shares he possessed, he assembled the printed sheets; Bonds' copy had to be farmed out and his printing collected each month. For Nichols, the arrangement must have been inconvenient at best, and for Bond it was definitely undesirable. His annoyance led him to publish a pamphlet bitterly reproaching Nichols and Henry in 1781. Although the world was thus told how the printing was handled during this interval, few people besides the printers and their immediate associates would have known which sheets had come from which shop, and probably only the principals themselves would have cared to write down that information in a volume of the published magazine. The notations in Vol. XLIX at the Folger are in the handwriting of either John Nichols or his son, and they provide unique information about this episode. 9 Although annotations in the Folger volumes allow one to observe closely Nichols' emergence as the magazine's printer and editor, such evidence seems to have been supplied for the most part by his son. The frequent identifications of Nichols as the author of prefaces, editorial statements, and pseudonymous articles are usually in the handwriting of Bowyer Nichols, and he himself appears to have added only occasional annotation. 10 In view of his editorial habits, it is nearly inconceivable that Nichols did not keep a well-annotated file copy close at hand as he undertook the direction of this important periodical. His major study of Hogarth, his Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century , and other characteristic works assumed their eventual length through his painstaking accumulation of notes in file copies over many years. However, no set of the magazine bearing the kind of annotation one imagines Nichols to have made was in his library or his son's or his grandson's when they were sold in the course of the nineteenth century, and no such set is known to exist today. One is left to speculate that John Nichols' personal collection of the Gentleman's Magazine was destroyed in the fierce fire which consumed his printing office and warehouses in 1808. The account of the fire which Nichols published in the magazine that year (pt. i [Jan.-June], pp. 99-100) does not specifically report the status of whatever editorial files he then maintained. If he kept a file copy in "the Dwelling-house, which, though it had an immediate communication with the other buildings, was providentially preserved from destruction," such a collection would have escaped the fire. "A considerable number of valuable books" were preserved because they were housed there, including "a single copy of several of the articles that formed the stock in trade, and a matchless collection of early printed News-papers, which Mr. N. had for many years with great trouble and expense been collecting and arranging." It is more likely, however, that his file collection of the Gentleman's Magazine would have been located for convenience of reference in the printing office, along with the materials for other works in progress, such as the new edition of the Anecdotes of Bowyer . "The whole of Six Portions of Mr. Nichols's Leicestershire and the Entire Stock of the Gentleman's Magazine from 1782 to 1807" were, like the revised Anecdotes , "irrecoverably lost." When Nichols' library was sold at auction after his death, the only set of the magazine it contained was a run of volumes beginning with that for 1808. 11 If Nichols' personal collection through the volume for 1807 was indeed destroyed by fire, his loss was soon alleviated through a bequest from Richard Gough (1735-1809), his closest editorial associate besides his son, and a man whose interests and habits were perhaps nearer his own than those of any other person. 12 Gough's will left to Nichols his "corrected" set of the Gentleman's Magazine . 13 Most and perhaps all of the first fifty-two volumes in the Nichols family collection at the Folger Library were drawn from this set which John Nichols inherited from Richard Gough. The provenance of these volumes is established by the presence of Gough's bookplate and by annotation in his hand. 14 The bookplate appears in only twelve volumes, 15 but there are reasons to believe that it must once have been present in most of the others before Vol. LIII (1783). Those containing his bookplate belong to a group of forty-two 16 which have undergone a common rebinding, and in two of them (XXXIII [1763] and XLI [1771]) the bookplate has been covered by the front pastedown. Since there are annotations in his hand in all but three of the rebound volumes after that for 1752 (and in these three there is virtually no annotation 17 ), it seems likely that his bookplate was removed or obliterated in the rebinding of most of these volumes. It was perhaps once present also in six volumes before that for 1752 which are in the rebound group but which (like those from the same period still bearing the bookplate) contain little or no annotation in his hand, perhaps because they were published during his youth. 18 Beginning in Vol. XXII (1752), Gough's volumes contain the kind of annotation which one might expect a reader with his interests to have made in his copy of each monthly number as it appeared. He devoted attention particularly to the monthly lists of births, marriages, preferments, and deaths. Notations in his hand provide additional information and correct inaccuracies, and the lists are routinely marked with an elaborate system of checks, crosses, and lines, usually with the same stroke and shade of ink as the notations. Certain notations indicate that he returned to the lists to add information later in the century. 19 Gough evidently shared John Nichols' view that one of the most valuable functions of the Gentleman's Magazine was its preservation of historical and biographical data, 20 and his efforts to verify and extend such data in his own volumes must have enhanced their value to the Nichols family. Gough's volumes also contain annotation of other kinds. He wrote comments on articles which interested him, particularly those on antiquarian subjects, often adding evidence or giving references to other publications in the field. 21 When his own articles and reviews of his works appeared in the magazine he of course devoted special attention to them, writing comments in his copy and carefully correcting typographical errors. 22 From time to time, Gough identified or guessed at the identities of other contributors. 23 Containing such pertinent and interesting additions, the early run of volumes from Richard Gough provided the Nichols family with a suitably substantial foundation for their own collection. Various factors suggest that the volumes after that for 1782 in the Folger Library are a series maintained entirely within the Nichols family which escaped destruction in 1808. In 1783, John Nichols inaugurated a major change in the Gentleman's Magazine , nearly doubling the number of pages each month in order to accommodate an increasing body of contributed articles. 24 In effect, he began a new series, for, though the policy of numbering volumes on a yearly basis was continued, each volume was now to be bound in two parts with separate title-pages. Whatever holdings the Nichols family had in back numbers of the Gentleman's Magazine , it seems reasonable to assume that the family set aside an adequate supply of duplicate copies from 1783 onward. The similarity of the bindings in this run of volumes at the Folger suggests continuity of ownership. None of these volumes underwent the rebinding which characterizes those from Gough's library. 25 None contain his bookplate. They do contain, as the earlier volumes do not, tipped-in letters to the editor and color drawings which presumably only the managing staff would have had on file. More significantly, Gough does not appear to have annotated these volumes: one does not find his calligraphic traits in the written notations, and the informational lists are not marked in the systematic way Gough marked his volumes. On the other hand, beginning in the volume for 1783, marginalia in the hand of Bowyer Nichols is the principal annotative feature of the collection at the Folger. At least some of his annotation was probably added before 1808, for on the front free endpaper of Vol. LXXI (1801), part 1 (Jan.-June), he noted that his identifications of certain contributing writers were inscribed "at the time, or nearly so, of publication." That the Nichols family collection at the Folger ends with the last volume to be published in his lifetime (though the family sold the set eleven years later 26 ) suggests that Bowyer Nichols was its custodian during much of the nineteenth century. Very likely he began to maintain his own file copies when he became involved in editorial activity at the turn of the century, and if his collection was not a complete one by 1808 it doubtless included at least a continuous run of volumes from 1783 onward. Whatever its composition, Bowyer Nichols' own collection of the Gentleman's Magazine would have escaped the fire which devastated many of his father's holdings, for Bowyer was then the occupant of the dwelling house "providentially preserved from destruction." 26a No document has as yet come to light explaining why certain of the volumes (but not others) inherited by John Nichols from Gough were incorporated into the collection which eventually came to the Folger Library. In view of the available evidence, however, a plausible explanation is that after the fire in 1808 a run of annotated volumes beginning with LIII in the possession of Bowyer Nichols represented the family's most important file of the magazine; that Gough's earlier volumes superseded any held by the family; and that John Nichols passed these volumes to his son in order to establish within the family as substantial a file as possible. The nature and scope of Bowyer Nichols' annotation indicate that he devoted considerable effort to increasing the documentary value of the set of volumes which the Folger now owns. J. G. Nichols evidently made use of the set also, especially towards the middle of the nineteenth century, when as managing editor he was in a better position than his father was to provide current information about authorship. 27 The occasional corrections of obituary information in volumes from this period appear often to be his. 28 His critical remarks on antiquarian articles in volumes from the eighteenth century reveal that J. G. Nichols examined earlier portions of the collection as well. Indeed, the initials JGN written on the blank side of an engraved plate, in a large youthful scrawl quite different from the neat hand of his adult years, suggest that he discovered the collection at an early age. 29 It is clear that he consulted it while he was writing the "Autobiography of Sylvanus Urban." His annotations on VII (1737), 400-402, are obvious preparations for his remarks on that passage. 30 John Nichols may have made similar use of this set in preparing his own historical account of the magazine, and the occasional notations in his hand are evidence that he did consult it. 31 The annotation of Bowyer Nichols, however, is far more extensive than that of his father and his son. Notations in his hand call attention to certain bibliographical irregularities in the volumes from Gough's library, 32 and his identifications of anonymous writers occur as early as Vol. VIII (1738). 33 Though some of his annotation appears to have been added earlier, 34 much of it dates from the 1840's and 1850's. Bowyer Nichols was then carrying forward the work, begun by his father, of assimilating the vast numbers of letters and documents in the family's possession towards the seventeen volumes called Literary Anecdotes and Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century , the last two of which (published in 1848 and in 1858) he edited alone. The care which Bowyer Nichols devoted to this task is evident in the condition of letters and documents which have found their way into the extant collections of Nichols family papers. The Columbia University collection, for instance, contains scores of documents which he either transcribed or annotated. Some of these annotations can be dated from the middle of the nineteenth century. 35 That this work was coordinated with his annotation of the set of the Gentleman's Magazine now at the Folger is suggested by a statement which he inscribed at the front of many of these volumes. 36 The statement, nearly always dated in 1847, establishes that he had made an exhaustive effort to identify the contributing writers, and at least in volumes which had been published during his childhood his identifications must have been based largely on documentary evidence rather than on personal recollection. Although he was by no means able to identify all of the magazine's writers—there had been thousands of contributors, and most of them preserved anonymity 37 —his annotations concerning authorship are frequent and illuminating. Where possible, he reasoned out the adoption of particular pseudonyms or initials: "M. C. S. is Rev W. Bagshaw Stevens (probably M agd C oll. S ocius)"; "L E is Samue l Pegg e ." 38 Bowyer Nichols also provided in many places the kind of annotation which Richard Gough and J. G. Nichols made in these volumes—corrections of fact, additions of detail, cross-references, occasional remarks. His annotation went beyond theirs, however, in the assimilation of evidence concerning the history of the Gentleman's Magazine , and it is to Bowyer Nichols that we are most deeply indebted for the evidential value of this set of volumes. This was not, of course, the only set of the Gentleman's Magazine which belonged to the Nichols family. Until the early 1850's, they kept, indeed, another complete set, a collection of the magazine "from its commencement, 1731 to 1854 boards , uncut, rare in this state ." The set was offered by Sotheby in a special auction of items from Bowyer Nichols' library in 1856, along with one other interesting run of volumes: "the New Series, edited by the Rev. John Mitford, John Bruce, Esq. F. S. A., and J. G. Nichols, F. S. A. 1834 to 1855, 44 vol. bound for convenience of reference in 22 vol. , perfect ." 39 Five other sets of the magazine were listed in the catalogue of the remaining portions of Bowyer Nichols' library after he died: one run of volumes from 1731 through 1782, one from 1808 through 1833, one from 1824 through 1838, and two from 1824 through 1845. 40 The set of the Gentleman's Magazine now at the Folger was not, however, offered for sale from Bowyer Nichols' library. It was not to be sold until, after the death of J. G. Nichols, the family released for purchase a vast body of manuscript and printed materials relating to the history of the Gentleman's which appears to have been accumulating for three generations—letters to the editor, manuscripts and proof sheets, newspaper cuttings probably connected with the magazine's informational lists. One finds few such collections in the catalogues of his father's and grandfather's libraries. Although, like other nineteenth-century Englishmen, members of the Nichols family evidently regarded their libraries along with their other possessions as capital to be converted into cash estates, they took care that certain portions should be inherited intact. The opening bequest in Bowyer Nichols' will conveys to J. G. Nichols "my Illustrated Copies of the Works respectively called 'The History of Leicestershire' and 'The Beauties of England and Wales' and also all my Works or Writings in Manuscript and Collections of Correspondence whether bound in volumes or otherwise. . . ." 41 In addition, J. G. Nichols was to choose any printed books he wanted from his father's "private library" up to a value of £2000. When his own library was sold it contained at least one presentation copy from his father's personal collection, and several notebooks of Bowyer Nichols now at the Bodleian were purchased from J. G. Nichols' library. 42 The collection of the Gentleman's Magazine which Bowyer Nichols had so carefully annotated thus passed into the keeping of his son along with other valued works. J. G. Nichols took possession of it as a unique collection of the magazine. Among the various sets listed in the catalogues of the libraries of John, Bowyer, and J. G. Nichols, this set is the only one advertised as containing annotation and inserted materials. The collection passed from J. G. Nichols to Dr. T. N. Brushfield by a circuitous route. It was offered at auction by Sotheby as lot no. 774 on the third day's sale of J. G. Nichols' library in December, 1874. 43 The catalogue listed it separately from three other sets, which were offered on the seventh day of the sale. 44 According to the auctioneer's copy of the catalogue, it fetched £12, a modest price considering the intrinsic value of the set, but one of the higher amounts achieved during the auction. 45 Although Quaritch, Pickering, and other major London book dealers were present, the successful bidder was a man named Pratt, who bought items every day of the sale and was one of the major purchasers. 46 Pratt's name appears at only one other sale in the auctioneer's catalogues for this period. He bought a number of porcelains at the next auction after that of J. G. Nichols' library. 47 The infrequency of his attendance and the nature of his purchases suggest that Pratt was a dealer in old books and antiques who came to the London market to make occasional acquisitions suitable to the provincial trade. Though little information about him is available, two facts can be ascertained: in the mid-1880's, Pratt had a store on High Street in Guildford, Surrey; and at some time before June, 1882, Dr. Brushfield, who was at the time director of the Brookwood Asylum, near Guildford, bought this set of the Gentleman's Magazine from him. 48 The details of Brushfield's purchase of the Nichols collection are provided in a note which Dr. Brushfield tipped inside the back cover of Vol. I: Gents Mag .

['art' del. ] art. of furniture.— No bookseller had seen it, he told me, — it was much in his way and would I purchase it—['I gave him' del. ] I bought it, and it may be accepted as an evidence of its value when I state that on subsequently showing one of the vols to a bookbuyer for one of the largest 2nd hand book dealers, he offered me three times the price I paid for it— which I declined It is fortunate for the modern scholar that Dr. Brushfield, apparently quite by accident, came across the Nichols collection in Pratt's shop within a few years of the Sotheby auction. Very likely, if Brushfield had not bought it, the set would have deteriorated badly or would have become dispersed. Brushfield, on the other hand, was an ideal custodian. Noting that the "Historical Chronicle" for April was missing from Vol. VI (1736), he inserted a fair copy of these pages. 49 As documentation of provenance, he tipped inside the front cover of Vol. I a slip quoting the Sotheby catalogue description of the set. Although he does not appear to have added his own annotation to these volumes, he did consult them closely enough to compile information about the numerous articles by Richard Gough which Bowyer Nichols had identified. 50 Dr. Brushfield recognized not only the authenticity of the collection but also its potential importance for scholarship about the Gentleman's Magazine . In the early 1880's, when Sir Laurence Gomme's massive Gentleman's Magazine Library began to appear, Brushfield let him know that the Nichols annotated volumes were available. Gomme was reprinting the articles from the Gentleman's which he considered most significant, and in his preface to the volume Dialects , Proverbs , and Word-Lore (1884) he acknowledged Brushfield's offer of help in establishing the identities of the writers whose work he selected. After the death of Dr. Brushfield, the Nichols collection of the Gentleman's Magazine was once again offered to the public, this time by James G. Commin, a bookseller in Exeter. Presumably Commin had served Dr. Brushfield often enough during the previous thirty-odd years, while Brushfield was living nearby at Budleigh-Salterton. When Brushfield died (28 Nov. 1910), Commin purchased his entire library of 10,000 volumes from the executors and advertised it during 1911 in a series of five catalogues. 51 The annotated volumes of the Gentleman's Magazine from the Nichols family are listed in item no. 772 of the first catalogue. 52 Commin priced the collection at £25, more than twice the amount paid at the Sotheby auction, but the collection now included various related materials in addition to the volumes of the magazine proper. At some time, Dr. Brushfield had acquired independently of Pratt's run of volumes "5 thick 4to volumes of MS. obituary notices " compiled by Bowyer Nichols, a set so interesting to bidders at the Sotheby auction in 1874 that it had fetched £26. 53 He had also acquired, perhaps in part from Pratt, 54 "several thousand letters addressed to the editor principally from well known archaeologists." The volumes of obituary notices and the manuscript letters (stored in "a large tea-chest") enhanced the documentary richness of the collection, though the rather long description of this item in the catalogue called attention primarily to the provenance and the unique properties of the volumes of the magazine itself. The offering was altogether a very attractive one, and in the summer of 1911 Henry C. Folger responded by getting the collection for his own growing library. 55 A century has elapsed since this set of the Gentleman's Magazine first passed from the Nichols family into other hands. While they maintained it, the set possessed for successive generations of the family considerably more than sentimental value. The early volumes, it is true, came from the library of an old family friend, but these were not to be filed away, like the run of volumes with uncut pages sold in 1856, in a passive state of preservation. Gough's volumes and those which were added to his became the central repository within the family for documentary information about this periodical. The annotations which members of the family were in a unique position to make they made in these volumes, and they returned to this set for reference when they wished to ascertain facts about the history of the Gentleman's Magazine . During the past century, this important collection has been virtually unnoticed in scholarship on the English periodical. Although Dr. Brushfield treasured it and Sir Laurence Gomme knew of it, the set has remained in obscurity, and its credentials have never been recognized clearly by anyone outside of the Nichols family. In its various bindings and with its assortment of different editions in the earliest volumes, this set appears to have little particular bibliographical significance, to be in fact like many another run of volumes currently available. 56 Retaining as it does, however, the significance of special editorial attention over so many years, the set of the Gentleman's Magazine in the Folger Library is unparalleled in authenticity and unequaled in its potential value to scholars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The set in question includes all vols. through that for Jan.-June, 1863 (see n. 43, below). The next 11 vols. were added to those from the Nichols family by Dr. Brushfield. The rest of the Folger collection came from other sources. My research on the background of this collection has been generously supported by the American Philosophical Society, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Folger Library, and the University of Wisconsin. I am grateful for this support and for the helpfulness of Dr. Michael Kassler, at whose suggestion I first examined the Folger volumes. 2 The details of this transaction are reviewed in my monograph The Works of John Nichols, An Introduction (1968), p. 8 ff. 3 The letter making this assignment is now at Columbia University, in Spec. MS. Coll. Nichols. Henry (d. 1792) did not date the letter, but the year is written at the top of the sheet, probably in the hand of Bowyer Nichols, who wrote on an attached leaf, "A Letter from Mr Henry to Mr Nichols Written not a great while before his Death." The letter is printed in Edward L. Hart's Minor Lives (1971), p. 234. 4 Typical of such letters are those in Nichols' Illustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century (1817-18) from George Steevens (V, 443), Joseph Warton (VI, 172), and Thomas Percy (VI, 567). 5 Gentleman's Magazine , CCXV (Jul.-Dec., 1863), 794. This obituary of Bowyer Nichols (pp. 794-798) was written by his son, J. G. Nichols. See the Memoir of the Late John Gough Nichols, F. S. A. (1874), p. 2, written by Robert Cradock Nichols (J. G. Nichols' brother). 6 For information concerning the proprietorship, see the Gentleman's Magazine , CCXV, 794. Bowyer Nichols' account-book, in which the names of various associate editors and contributors during this period are recorded, is now at the Bodleian (MS. Top. Gen. e. 34). 7 See CCI (Jul.-Dec., 1856), 3-9, 131-140, 267-277, 531-541, 667-677; and CCII (Jan.-June, 1857), 3-10, 149-157, 282-290, 379-387. J. G. Nichols is identified as author of this study in the Memoir of John Gough Nichols , p. 17. 8 Bond's arrangement with Henry and the new one with Henry and Nichols are reviewed in great detail in Bond's pamphlet referred to below: FRIENDSHIP Strikingly exhibited in a New Light , in LETTERS between Messrs . D. HENRY and J. NICHOLS, Managing Proprietors of the Gentleman's Magazine, and D. BOND, Late Printer of that Monthly Miscellany (London, 1781). 9 The similarity in stroke and shade of ink suggests that these notations all came from the same pen. They are phrased in the formula "Printed by" + name or initials of Nichols or Bond. They appear to have been scrawled hastily, perhaps sequentially, and the hand is not clearly identifiable. Though this vol. originally belonged to Richard Gough and presumably was in his library in 1779, the hand does not appear to be his (see n. 14, below). The notations do contain calligraphic traits of John and Bowyer Nichols. The capital P, formed typically with a line under the stem and an unattached loop above, is identical to that written in mid-nineteenth-century documents by Bowyer Nichols, and it is unlike the letter as formed by John Nichols. But the capital N is distinctly like John Nichols' and unlike Bowyer's: the middle stroke heavy and looped at the bottom, the final stroke a flourish sometimes curving downward to or beneath the line. When I have completed the systematic study I am now making of the entire range of annotation in these vols., it may be possible to assign these notations confidently. 10 The assignment of annotation is complicated by certain factors. Because most notations were written in the irregular spaces left on the printed page, the calligraphic traits of the writers did not always emerge. These traits naturally underwent modification as time passed, and in studying the manuscript letters of Bowyer Nichols, particularly, one notices such changes (see n. 34, below). A further complicating factor is that the Nichols men and Gough had rather distinct private and fair hands. And finally whereas each of the annotators had individual calligraphic traits, they shared others. In general, the hands of the Nichols men became increasingly neater, clearer, and smaller in stroke with each generation. Their writing tends to slant towards the right, though John Nichols' stroke is less slanted than his son's and less regular than his grandson's. John Nichols tended to run words together; Bowyer and J. G. Nichols usually did not. One annotation, in Vol. LV (1785), pt. ii (Jul.-Dec.), p. 835, is certainly his: in the obituary of Mrs. Anne Power, he added at the reference to her "friends" the phrase "(I was one)." Here, the words are run together and the note is signed. The identification of "J. R." as "Mr John Robinson" in XXXVII (1767), 499, seems to be in his hand (and the names are run together). The identification of him as "Eugenio" in L (1780), 20, is probably by Nichols himself, for the capital N is his (see n. 9, above). See also the attribution to him of the narrative on the London riots in 1780 (L, 369). The signature J. Nichols on nearly every other occasion appears to be in the hand of Bowyer Nichols, and most of the annotation in these vols. is at least probably the work of Gough, Bowyer Nichols, or J. G. Nichols. 11 There were two auctions, on 16 April and 8 May 1828 (a further portion of his library was sold with that of another gentleman on 5 May). The set of the Gentleman's Magazine was lot no. 716 in the Sotheby catalogue of the second auction. No annotation of these vols. is mentioned. 12 Letters now in the Nichols collection at Columbia University, which is largely composed of family papers, refer often to Gough's personal and professional activities. John Nichols' account of Gough and of their association (an autobiographical statement by Gough considerably enlarged through Nichols' additions, corrections, and commentary) appears in Literary Anecdotes (1812-1815), VI, 262-343, 613-626. 13 Some years before his death, Gough spoke of leaving Nichols his copy of the Anecdotes of Bowyer , "enriched by his own notes, and filled with the epistolary correspondence of many eminent persons, selected for the illustration of these 'Anecdotes'" ( Literary Anecdotes , I, xii). He was concerned that Nichols would not have sufficient time for the projected Literary Anecdotes , and his annotated volume was meant to serve as a supplementary file copy for the project. Gough was deeply disturbed over Nichols' losses in the fire of 1808 ( Literary Anecdotes , VI, 315). Thus far, I have found in Gough's papers no evidence of long-standing plans to leave Nichols his set of the magazine, but if indeed Nichols' own set was suddenly destroyed Gough would doubtless have recognized the importance of putting a well-annotated collection at his disposal. Gough's set of the magazine and his copy of the Anecdotes of Bowyer are mentioned jointly as a special bequest in Nichols' resume of Gough's will ( Literary Anecdotes , VI, 330). Gough's set is described as "corrected" in the index to Literary Anecdotes (VII, 147). 14 I have identified Gough's hand primarily through his usage of raised letters in abbreviating words and of the device y=th (neither is a characteristic usage of John, Bowyer, or J. G. Nichols); and through his forming of the number 8. In Gough's hand, the latter begins at the upper right of the top loop and ends in a straight stroke which usually leaves the top loop unclosed. Bowyer and J. G. Nichols began the number at the upper left of the bottom loop, ending at the lower right of the top loop, usually leaving both loops unclosed; John Nichols usually formed the number 8 this way but closed both loops. Gough's number 5 and capital D are also usually distinct from those of the Nichols men. Gough's most distinctive writing is hurried and irregular in stroke, possessing no rightward slant like that of the Nichols men. He seems at times to have written in a fairer and smaller hand like that of J. G. Nichols. Certain notations on antiquarian matters in vols. from the eighteenth century are difficult to assign to either of the two annotators except where reference to recent activities of the Society of Antiquaries incline the balance toward Gough. 15 VIII (1738)-XI (1741), XIII (1743)-XVII (1747), XXXIII (1763), XXXVI (1766), and XLI (1771). On the bookplate in VIII is written "W. T. Stafford" in a hand I cannot identify. The notation may indicate where Gough acquired vols. published before he became a subscriber. 16 VII (1737)-XLI (1771), XLIII (1773), XLV (1775)-XLIX (1779), and LI (1781). 17 XL (1770), XLVI (1776), and XLVIII (1778). In the first of these, the only annotation I have found is the correction of one page reference in an index; in the second there are a few marginal checkmarks; in the third I have found no annotation at all. 18 VII (1737), XII (1742), and XVIII (1748)-XXI (1751). 19 Gough's later additions to the lists usually indicated the date of death. See, for instance, XXXI (1761), 284, where Gough noted, opposite a reference to the marriage of the Rev. Dr. Winchester, "[died] &amp; his books were sold 1783." 20 Nichols' comments on the subject are to be found in his preface to Vol. LXIV (1794). In the historical sketch prefixed to Vol. III (London, 1821) of the General Index to the Gentleman's Magazine , he quoted the passage among those which reflected his attitudes about the magazine. 21 The earliest annotation certainly by Gough that I have found is a long comment written in the outer margin of XX (1750), 306, in reference to an antique vase on display in France. Gough took care to cross-reference articles which interested him—as the location of later topographical items noted in XXV (1755), 157. In the same vol., p. 104, he noted that a figure described by a contributor here had been displayed at the Society of Antiquaries in 1750. And on p. 360 he noted that a "correcter acct &amp; drawing" were to be found in the number for "May. 1757. p. 220." See also, at the printed reference to Derby's edition of a commentary on the Four Evangelists, in XLVII (1777), 183, Gough's notation, citing Boswell's Life (1791), that Johnson had aided Derby in this work. 22 See, for instance, the corrections of typographical errors in the article by "D. H." in XXXIX (1769), 122. The article is not attributed to Gough at the Folger but the signature was his during this period ( Literary Anecdotes , VI, 271). The anonymous review of Nichols' Alien Priories , XLIX (1779), 552-553, which is assigned to him by an annotator (probably Bowyer Nichols) was also corrected. The review of his own enlarged edition of British Topography , in L (1780), 377-380, was obviously read closely by the person who annotated it so carefully in the Folger copy—probably Gough, taking note of the reviewer's comments towards a revision of this work. The annotation of an article by "R. G." in XLVII (1777), 60-61, attributed to him (probably by Bowyer Nichols) in the Folger copy, is an interesting response by the author to his work and its reception. The typographical errors are corrected. In addition, a statement by "T. Cato" about the controversy aroused by the article is doubly recorded, once in a note written on a slip tipped to p. 61 (evidently copied by John Nichols from another source and sent to Gough), once by Gough himself in the margin. 23 See, for instance, the assignments (probably in his hand) of an article to John Thorpe, Esq., in XXIX (1759), 269; of a poem to Mrs. Rowe, in XXXIX (1769), 503; of an essay by "Q. E. D." to Dr. Franklin, in XLIII (1773), 441-445. 24 On Nichols' reasons for increasing the length of the monthly number, see his comments in the General Index , III, lix. 25 Twelve of the Folger volumes after LII have been rebound or repaired, but in material and workmanship these rebindings are distinct from that of the vols. from Gough. 26 When it was sold in December, 1874, the set ended with Vol. CCXIV (Jan.-June, 1863). See n. 43, below. Bowyer Nichols died on 19 October 1863. 26a See the Memoir of John Gough Nichols , p. 2. 27 See, for instance, the identifications written in his hand in N. S. XLIV (Jul.-Dec., 1855), 562. 28 See, for instance, N. S. XXXVIII (Jul.-Dec., 1852), 111. Cf. Vol. XCIX (1829), pt. ii (Jul-Dec.), 279; and N. S. X (Jul.-Dec., 1838), 294 and 596. 29 The plate faces the Oct. titlepage in Vol. XLI (1771). For an example of his adult notations in eighteenth-century vols., see the comment signed JGN in XXXIX (1769), 439. 30 The passages marked with lines in the margins of Vol. VII are precisely those he quotes and cites in CCI (Jul.-Dec., 1856), 537. Furthermore, the notations (which are in his hand) represent his collation of this text of the speech with another text; a comparison of the reporting of speeches in the London and Gentleman's magazines is one of the subjects treated by J. G. Nichols in 1856. 31 For John Nichols' annotation of this set, see n. 10, above. His historical sketch (see n. 20, above) was published in 1821. Thus far, I have found in the Folger volumes only one passage where the annotation may represent John Nichols' research for the historical sketch: the preface to Vol. XLIV (1774). The pencilled notations here are nearly illegible and difficult to identify on calligraphic grounds. However, lines indicating that certain passages are to be run together and a note identifying the "late first magistrate" suggest that someone was preparing to make use of the preface in another context. Though Nichols does not quote the passage in the historical sketch, this is among the yearly prefaces which he singles out for comment, and he refers pointedly to the content of the marked passage. 32 See, for instance, his annotation in XXII (1752), facing p. [589] and in XXIV (1754) following plate 13 in the Baronets' Arms series at the end of the vol. Plates 14 through 24 in this series had been bound in the earlier vol. 33 On p. 232, a notation in his hand identifies William Guthrie as author of the anonymous article "The apotheosis of milton." The article appeared in several installments: 232-235, 469, 521-522; IX (1739), 20-21, and 73-75. 34 The annotation in Vol. LIV (1784), pt. ii (Jul.-Dec.), p. 557; Vol. LXI (1791), pt. i (Jan.-June), p. 485; and certain other places, is in a hand unlike that of the signed statement in numerous vols. (see n. 36, below) which Bowyer Nichols inscribed in 1847. Most of the annotation which can be assigned to him is in the latter hand. The annotation I call attention to here, however, is very similar to the hand in certain letters by Bowyer Nichols from the early 1820's now in the Columbia University collection. See also his comment in Vol. LXXI (1801) referred to above. 35 See, for instance, the MS memo on the accident in which John Nichols broke a thigh, part of which is a note by Bowyer Nichols dated 25 May 1849; the bound vol. "Tributes to the memory of J. Nichols.— 1826," which contains a list prepared by Sarah Nichols of writers alluding to the death of Nichols, brought up to 1846 by Bowyer Nichols, whose copy of the list rather than Sarah's original is in the vol.; the MS "A View of the Character of Mr J Nichols as it appeared to me when in 1799, he published his [ ] of Bishop Atterbury's Works. B Nichols 1858." 36 The statement, usually written on the recto of the front free endpapers, appears in most of the half-yearly parts from 1783 through 1819; in Vol. XCIII (1823), pt. i (Jan.-June); and in Vol. XCVIII (1828), pt. ii (Jul.-Dec.). 37 In a forthcoming book on the attention to literature in the Gentleman's Magazine during the eighteenth century, I discuss the articles and notes of about a thousand contributors, at least two-thirds of whom used pseudonyms or initials. As Richard Gough's favorite signature "D. H." (see n. 22, above) and Samuel Pegge the Younger's "L. E." illustrate, "initials" could be used as elusively as a pseudonym could; the signatures are really the terminal letters of their names. 38 I quote the identifications from the front free endpaper of Vol. LVI (1786), pt. i (Jan.-June), and from the back free end-paper of Vol. LXI (1791), pt. i (Jan.-June). 39 Catalogue of the auction of 11 and 12 July 1856, lots 15 and 16. At an earlier Sotheby auction of books from his library, in 1843, nothing relating to the Gentleman's Magazine was offered. 40 Sotheby catalogues of the auction of 24 May 1864 and 6 days ff., lot 337; and of the auction of 19 Dec. 1864 and 3 days ff., lots 1027-1029. 41 The will, which may be consulted at Somerset House, is dated 19 July 1860. It was sworn at the Stamp Office in July 1864. 42 The presentation copy, a specially printed biographical sketch of J. B. Swaine given by Swaine to Bowyer Nichols, was offered as lot 2506 in the Sotheby catalogue for the auction of J. G. Nichols' library in 1874. The notebooks in question, offered as lot 2610, were bought by the Bodleian at that sale (see the index of Western MSS., entry nos. 30499-30501, and also the marked Bodleian copy of the catalogue, Mus. Bibl. III. 8°. 636) and are now catalogued as MS. Eng. misc. d. 19-21. 43 "GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE from the Commencement in 1731 to June 1863, with INDEXES to 1844, 7 vol. ( wanting vol. 4 and 42) portraits and plates, and numerous MS. notes and portraits inserted , 218 vol.; 141 vol. uniformly bound , half calf ; Indexes , half russia ; the others , variously bound ." The information given here about the number of vols. is ambiguous. 213 separately bound yearly and half-yearly vols. of the magazine had been published up to July, 1863. The vol. for Jan.-June, 1863, was numbered CCXIV, but because for some reason the number CC had been left out of the sequence this was actually the 213th vol. (for a concise summary of information about the vol. numbers of this periodical, see the Library of Congress printed cards). Thus, 5 index vols. must have originally been included in the 218-vol. set. As the following discussion shows, Brushfield bought the set without these index vols. He acquired separately the four-vol. General Index and a one-vol. List of Plates (both works bear the book-plate of John S. Pakington); 5 vols. of MS obituary notices (see n. 52, below); and 11 additional vols. of the magazine, from CCXV (Jul.-Dec., 1863) through CCXXV (Jul.-Dec., 1868). These vols. and the 213 vols. of the magazine from the library of J. G. Nichols constituted the 234-vol. collection sold from Brushfield's library in 1911. 44 Lots 2322-2324. At two other Sotheby auctions of remaining portions of J. G. Nichols' library, in 1879 and 1892, numerous MS collections relating to the Gentleman's Magazine were offered, but no other sets of the magazine itself. 45 According to my notes on information in the auctioneer's catalogue, which is at the British Museum, only 19 of the 2860 lots fetched the same or a higher price. In the catalogues of other auctions from this period, one finds that sets of the Gentleman's Magazine were not infrequently offered, often more uniform and in better condition than the one Pratt bought. Perhaps this explains why the bidding stopped at £12. 46 He bought 93 lots for a total of £104. 17s. According to my notes, Quaritch (who bought 72 lots for £151. 9s. 6d.) and Walford (125, for £83. 18s.) are the two other purchasers most frequently mentioned in the auctioneer's catalogue. 47 Auction of the "property of a gentleman removed from Finchley," 14 Dec. 1874. 48 The information on Pratt's business is found in The Directory of Second-hand Booksellers and List of Public Libraries , British and Foreign , ed. James Clegg (1888), p. 9. According to the DNB , Brushfield, a doctor of medicine specializing in treatment of the insane, was appointed medical superintendent of Brookwood Asylum in 1865, while the institution was still being planned, and was there until his retirement in 1882, when he took up residence at Budleigh Salterton. In Vol. VI (1736) at the Folger, the fair copy of the "Historical Chronicle" for April (see n. 49, below) is accompanied by a letter to Brushfield from the copyist dated "B. A. | 2nd June 1882." If "B. A." means Brookwood Asylum, it is likely that the copyist was sending this material from there to Brushfield, already in retirement in Devon. Obviously, the set of the magazine had by then been in Brushfield's possession for at least a short time. The free endpapers of several vols. from the 1770's have retained the reverse impression of a letterhead: "Brookwood Asylum | Near Woking Station | Surrey 188." Woking is about 5 miles from Guildford. It would seem that Brushfield kept certain notes about the collection on paper with this letterhead, and, if so, he was studying these vols. at some time after 1880. His note on the provenance of the set (see below) suggests that several years had elapsed between Pratt's purchase, at the end of 1874, and his own. 49 Everything in the April number after p. 228 was missing, including the monthly lists. 50 Brushfield's notations about Gough's work are written on the lower portion of the sheet tipped inside the back cover of Vol. I. 51 Commin catalogues 274-278. General information about Dr. Brushfield's library and Commin's acquisition of it appears on p. 2 of No. 274. 52 Commin's description of this set is as follows: "A Complete Set from the commencement in 1731 to 1868, with four Index Volumes (1731-1818) and List of Plates, 1 vol. The Editor's (J. Gough Nicholls) own set, with additional plates inserted, and MS. notes , also 5 thick 4to volumes of MS. obituary notices , together 234 vols, half calf, some bindings rough . . . ." 53 The set (lot 1412) was bought by "Tovey," according to the auctioneer's copy of the Sotheby catalogue. 54 Among Pratt's acquisitions at the Nichols auction was lot 235, a bundle of autograph letters. More important lots of MSS, however, went to other bidders, including lot 1378, " a large bundle " of "Manuscripts, Antiquarian, Genealogical, Topographical, &amp;c. including many Autograph Letters addressed to the Editor of the Gentleman's Magazine ( several with drawings )" bought by [Sandars] for £2. 7s. 55 The approximate date of purchase is derived from records at the Folger concerning acquisition ("ca. July 1911") of the manuscripts which came with the set of the magazine. 56 Although I have not collated the Folger volumes with other sets of the magazine, I have examined it in light of the analysis of various collated collections of the first 24 vols. provided in William B. Todd's "A Bibliographical Account of The Gentleman's Magazine , 1731-1754," Studies in Bibliography , 18 (1965), 81-109. Except in a few scattered cases, the bibliographical features of the Folger set appear to duplicate the range of variations noted in Todd's analysis. Like most of the sets on which Todd reports, this one is made up of numbers representing several different printings or editions in the first three vols., with fewer variations thereafter.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Some Borrowings in Tristram Shandy : The Textual Problem by Melvyn New and Norman Fry</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of the most complex problems facing an editor of Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy concerns Sterne's frequent interpolation of borrowed materials, often in French or Latin, into his text. To be sure, any borrowing raises the problem of its source, that is, of annotating it in an explanatory footnote. In this essay, however, we shall concern ourselves with the more specific textual problems raised by several interpolated passages in Tristram , passages where the establishment of a definitive text depends upon determining the relationship between Sterne's source and the copy-text. When a passage is borrowed, the editorial process is complicated by an additional text which may, depending upon the closeness with which the author attempted to duplicate it, be as important as the copy-text itself. The problem of determining which questionable readings in a copy-text are authorial, which compositorial, is rendered all the more difficult when one adds to authorial intent the process of copying as well as composing—and more difficult still when the copying or composing is of a passage in a language foreign to the author and compositor. We shall discuss six such passages in Tristram Shandy , ranging in size from single sentences to Ernulphus' curse, which, in Latin and English, runs for nineteen pages in the first edition. We may best begin with two brief sentences, the source of both probably being Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy . In Volume VI, Chapter 33, Sterne writes: ' Quanto id diligentias in liberis procreandis cavendum , sayeth Cardan '. 1 James A. Work was unable to find the sentence in the works of Cardan and suggests in his edition of Tristram that Sterne "may have adapted it from the Anatomy of Melancholy , 1.2.1.6." 2 It is a good suggestion, we believe, though a more careful reading of Burton would have led Work to the actual author of the passage, Jean Fernel (Fernelius), whose work is alternately cited in this section with that of Cardan. 3 The fact is, Sterne scanned the paragraph too quickly (unless, of course, he was being intentionally deceptive) and attached Cardan's name to Fernel's sentence, as quoted verbatim by Burton: ' quanto id diligentiùs in procreandis liberis observandum ?' 4 Sterne's 'diligentias' for Burton's 'diligentiùs' is the first of many such variants we shall encounter in his copying of foreign passages; the number of them suggests several generalizations: that Sterne was a rapid and inaccurate copier; that his hand was not easy to read, especially his vowels; that the various compositors involved were unfamiliar with French and Latin; that Sterne was not a careful proofreader. All these generalizations are, to some degree, correct, and in most instances an emendation to the copy-text is justified. But Sterne also altered this quotation in a more dramatic fashion, ' liberis procreandis cavendum ' for ' procreandis liberis observandum '. The alteration in meaning is so subtle (perhaps the difference in connotation between "How much more care then should we 'exercise' in begetting our children" for ". . . should we observe . . .") that it argues Sterne's care in writing as well as his knowledge of Latin. Quite obviously, we must preserve the illuminating original in a footnote. 5 In Volume VIII, Chapter 24, Sterne again quotes Burton, this time verbatim, except for one word: Sterne has 'incidesset' for Burton's correct 'incidisset'. 6 As with 'diligentias' the editor would be justified, we believe, in emending the copy-text, this being the sort of error which Sterne's hand may well have caused. A longer passage in Latin is taken from the entry under Luther in Bayle's Dictionary , and appears in the fourth volume of Tristram as a footnote. 7 From a rather glaring error we can identify the edition of Bayle used by Sterne; only the five-volume edition of 1734-38 has the following reading: 'Ex horoscopi directione ad Martis coitum religiosissimus obiit', where obviously the 'irreligiosissimus' of earlier editions is called for, unless we are willing to suppose that the Catholic astrologer believed Luther died "wholly religious." 8 Sterne follows his source faithfully, though whether he caught the humor of the error or was simply copying in haste may never be determined. The source is valuable in other ways as well. Sterne omitted the numeral '5' in his note, though he refers to the five planets in his text; Bayle specifies '5. Planetarum'. Bayle has 'effecit', where Sterne has 'efficit', an unnecessary change in tense, and one where again an emendation seems called for. Similarly, Sterne's 'seclestissima' for Bayle's 'scelestissima', 'Magera' for 'Megera', and 'pereniter' for 'perenniter' all suggest instances where Sterne's hand or carelessness rather than his Latin is at fault. His alteration of 'Scorpii' to 'Scorpio', on the other hand, while not as precise, does have the advantage of repeating the English of the text proper and probably can be preserved; 9 and his 'infernos' for Bayle's 'Inferos' marks a particular habit in Sterne of bringing foreign words into closer agreement with English cognates. Just preceding this footnote in the fourth volume of Tristram is another footnote which Work (p. 260) labels "a burlesque of pedantic authority-citing." While clear in its overall thrust, the note presents an interesting textual problem, of a sort different from those just commented upon. For example, in both the first and second editions, it reads 'Bar e Jas', which in the 1780 Works , and most modern editions, has been altered to 'Barne Jas'. However, in Henry Swinburne's A Briefe Treatise of Testaments and Last Willes , which Sterne cites several times later in Volume IV, we find the following phrasing in one of the many ponderous notes to this learned treatise: Quinimo &amp; legistæ, &amp; canonistæ omnes . . . provin. const. . . . vol. lib. 4. tit. 1. n. 7. . . . Bar. &amp; Ias. in d. L . . . qua etiam in re conspirant . . . . 10 While the learned formulas and citations may well occur in numerous other legal tracts, the similarity to Sterne's nonsense note, especially the specific numerals of the citation, is striking: Quinimo et Logistæ &amp; Canonistæ—Vid. Parce Bar e Jas in d. L. Provincial. Constitut. de conjec. vid. Vol. Lib 4. Titul. 1. N. 7. quà etiam in re conspir. (IV, 43n.). What is suggested by this similarity is that Sterne culled the margins of Swinburne, or a similar legal treatise, in order to put together his note. If this conjecture is accepted, 'Bar e Jas' may well have been a compositorial error for 'Bar &amp; Jas', and a small crux is solved. 11 In addition, Sterne's 'Logistæ' is quite probably an error for 'legistæ'. The opening sentence of Sterne's note, 'Nonnulli ex nostratibus eadem loquendi formulâ utun', also finds something of a parallel in Swinburne: 'Cæterùm quod nonnulli ex nostratibus eandem conclusionem extendunt, ut locum habeat vel ignorante executore, alios esse creditores . . .' (Part 3, xvi, p. 110 v ). And Sterne's phrases, 'Quibus add. Rebuff in L. obvenire de Signif. Nom. ff. fol.' and 'de protib. aliena feud. per federa', are close to Swinburne's 'cui adde Rebuff. in L. obvenire, de verb. signif. ff. fol.' and 'de prohib. alienac. feud. per fæder', 12 though again we are dealing with formulas that might exist in other legal works as well. Since the note is basically nonsense, it is difficult if not impossible for the editor to emend it, especially if reasonableness is the only available criterion. For example, is Sterne's 'protib.' merely an error for the far more likely 'prohib.'? We cannot say for certain without a sensible context to validate the emendation. Should 'Argentotarens.' be emended to 'Argentoratens.', that is, the "Strasburgians," as Sterne had written it in "Slawkenbergius's Tale," or is the "error" simply more nonsense? That the note is bawdy is without doubt: 'J. Scrudr.', 13 'J. Tubal', 'Von Jacobum Koinshoven', and 'Joha. Luxius' are all suggestive; but what or who is meant by 'N. Bardy' or Tichmak.' or a phrase like 'de contrahend. empt. &amp;c. '? As is so often the case with Sterne, it is difficult to know when to stop, and in this particular instance, especially difficult, since Sterne seems to have constructed his note by putting together several formulas and phrases which have no meaning in context. If nothing else, the fact that the compositor had to work solely from the hand of Sterne, without being able to rely at all on meaning, would greatly increase the opportunity for error. The borrowings from Adrien Baillet's Des Enfans célèbres , also in Volume IV, with an additional passage in Volume VI, do not offer very great difficulties, though they again illustrate the problems of dealing with borrowed passages in a foreign language. 14 Most important, perhaps, is the fact that Sterne's accenting of French is uniquely his own, and is certainly not guided by his source. The best course here, and for Sterne's accenting in general, we believe, is to follow the copy-text, except where a wrong accent affects the meaning. 15 In spelling, however, Sterne's copying or the compositor would seem to be responsible for 'Nourisse', 'fil', and 'reuissit' (IV, 99) where Baillet has "Nourrisse', 'fils', and 'réussit' (Baillet, VI, 136), and emendations seem justified. His 'differents' for 'différens', on the other hand, is again indicative of his practice involving cognates and probably ought not be emended. It is interesting to note in Sterne's use of Baillet how closely he follows his source, and yet how his eye is constantly searching for economy. Hence, where Baillet writes '. . . &amp; son Pere pour faire voir un essai de son expérience dans son nouvel établissement à Rapallo . . .' Sterne silently drops everything after 'expérience'; and when Baillet writes '. . . tous fruits d'une longue lecture &amp; d'une érudition acquise par des travaux extraordinaires . . .' Sterne omits everything after 'lecture'. The final problem to be discussed is Sterne's use, in Latin and English, of the Bishop of Rochester's "Excommunication" in Volume III. In 1960, William A. Jackson corrected Wilbur Cross's statement that Sterne took his Latin text from the Harleian Miscellany by pointing out that the Latin was not included in that work. 16 Instead, Jackson identified the source as Thomas Hearne's edition of the Textus Roffensis (Oxford, 1720). 17 Jackson also identified the source of Sterne's English translation as the Gentleman's Magazine for September, 1745 (p. 490), and his argument for it, rather than the Harleian Miscellany , is quite sound. Enough variants occur, however, in both Sterne's Latin and English versions to raise some question as to whether Sterne did not have another source, based on, or the basis of, Hearne and the Gentleman's Magazine ; if he did, no likely candidate has yet been discovered. 18 Hearne's Latin text suggests that several emendations should be made to Sterne's; for example, 'et a liminibus sanctæ Dei ecclesiæ sequestramus et æternis suppliciis excruciandus . . .' should be altered to 'ut æternis, etc.' as in Hearne, and as in the translation, 'that he may be tormented . . . .' 19 It is interesting to note in this same passage that Sterne's 'excruciandus' is his emendation of Hearne's 'cruciandus'; it perhaps indicates Sterne's habit with cognates, that is, he has "excruciating" in his mind. Most of the variants between Hearne and Sterne are in spelling, and it is often difficult to assign responsibility for the change. That Hearne's 'genitricis' and 'genitrix' become in Sterne 'genetricis' (p. 36) and 'genetrix' (p. 42) may indicate a conscious alteration, as may Sterne's 'quatuor' (p. 44) for 'quattuor' and his 'compagibus' (p. 50) for 'compaginibus'; 20 but Sterne's 'patriarchum' (p. 38) for 'patriarcharum', 'respuerit' (p. 40) for 'resipuerit', 'guttere' (p. 48) for 'gutture', 'harnis' (p. 48) for 'harmis', and 'manubus' (p. 48) for 'manibus' may all be the result of careless transcription or compositorial error, and should probably be emended. 21 On the other hand, Sterne would seem to have copied faithfully enough to have transcribed two Hearne "errors," one of which, 'potestatuum' (p. 38), is footnoted 'sic'. 22 Most interesting is the phrase 'in dentibus mordacibus, in labris sive molibus', which Sterne copied almost exactly, inserting a comma after 'dentibus' (p. 48). The phrase, however, does not seem to make sense, and Sterne's translation, 'in his foreteeth and grinders' (p. 49), is perhaps best served by Work's silent emendation of the text, 'in dentibus, mordacibus sive molaribus'. 23 Sterne also did a small amount of editing on Hearne's text, changing 'N[omen]' to the more usual 'N.N.' and 'Abiron' to 'Abiram', the spelling of his own translation. The phrase 'omnisque militia cœlestis exercitus' he shortens by dropping 'exercitus', at the same time changing the GM 's translation 'all the heavenly host' to 'all the heavenly armies', which enables him to interrupt hobby-horsically: 'Our armies swore terribly in Flanders , cried my uncle Toby ,—but nothing to this' (p. 43). More subtle is an alteration near the end of the curse, where the Latin 'in pedibus, in articulis, &amp; in unguibus' is rendered by Sterne 'in pedibus, et in unguibus' and is translated '[in his] feet, and toe-nails' (p. 50-51), rather than as in the GM , 'in the feet, in the joints, and in the nails'. 24 Then, for the very next sentence, 'Maledictus sit in totis compagibus membrorum . . .', where the GM translates 'May he or they be cursed in all their joints . . .', Sterne has 'May he be cursed in all the joints and articulations of his members.' 25 If Sterne did indeed use Hearne and the Gentleman's Magazine , he used them with the care and freedom of an artist, and in this instance avoided both a clumsy redundancy in the translation and a non-sequential phrase in the Latin. Sterne's use of the English version in the Gentleman's Magazine reveals his care in handling sources in other ways as well. His introduction of the word 'armies' to key the "hobby-horse" has already been mentioned. Another alteration is the addition of 'stables' and 'garden' (p. 47), where the GM has only 'in their house or in their field' (the Latin reads 'sive in domo, sive in agro'); the addition makes the curse particularly applicable to Obadiah. Again, Sterne uses 'vertex' rather than the GM 's 'top of his head', vertex being a hobby-horsical word for Walter: 'that is a sad curse, quoth my father' (p. 49); and 'purtenance' for 'interior parts', another Shandean substitution. One further addition is a puzzle: Sterne begins a paragraph, 'May he be damn'd in his mouth' (p. 49), though there is no Latin equivalent for this—nor is it in the GM . At times, by following the GM translation, Sterne seems to have been led into error. For example, the GM fails to translate 'in oculis' and Sterne follows suit, even though a few pages after the curse he specifically says that every curse, from ' By the splendour of God ' down to ' Damn your eyes ' can be found in Ernulphus (p. 64). Another error caused by the GM is Sterne's reading of '&amp; sanctorum innocentum, qui in conspectu Agni soli digni inventi sunt canticum cantare novum, et sanctorum martyrum, et sanctorum confessorum' (pp. 38, 40) as 'and of the holy innocents, who in the sight of the holy Lamb, are found worthy to sing the new song of the holy martyrs and holy confessors' (pp. 39, 41). The GM caused this confusion by omitting 'and' after 'song', though it does have a comma between 'song' and 'of' which Sterne overlooked; the martyrs and confessors are, of course, in series with the innocents, and not the subject of the 'new song'. A rather strange error is Sterne's translation of 'sanctus Johannes præcursor et Baptista Christi' (p. 44) as 'May St. John the præ-cursor, and St. John the Baptist' (p. 45), in spite of the GM 's 'May St. John , the chief fore-runner and baptist of christ'. One would like to know what Sterne was thinking about in making this change—perhaps a sly thrust at the number of Catholic saints, which consistently seems to have amused him. Similarly, we do not understand why he fails to translate 'Maledicat illum patriarcharum et prophetarum laudabilis numerus' (p. 44), the only sentence he omits; 26 or why he translates 'scientiam viarum tuarum nolumus' as 'none of thy ways' (p. 41) instead of following the GM 's ' not to know thy ways '; or 'non sit in eo sanitas' as 'may there be no soundness in him' (p. 51) for the GM 's 'may there not be any soundness in him'. To see Sterne making these minute changes does suggest, once again, the very conscious artistry behind the seemingly undesigned prose of Tristram Shandy . These several illustrations of Sterne's use of borrowed materials, particularly those in foreign languages, suggest the editorial problem faced by the editor of Tristram Shandy . In the absence of a manuscript, any copy-text must be carefully scrutinized for possible compositorial errors; and in dealing with a passage in a language quite probably unfamiliar to the compositor, the possibility of errors is greatly increased. We have evidence enough that Sterne saw his work through the press, 27 but he was hardly a meticulous proofreader, much less a careful copier. Moreover, his hand-writing is not exceptionally clear. The editor of Tristram Shandy , then, is well advised to use Sterne's sources as a guide in preparing his text, making every effort to distinguish between variants introduced by the copying or composing processes and variants introduced by authorial intent. Indeed, it is even possible that at times the author's purpose can best be served by using the source as copy-text, especially if copying or composing errors are numerous, though the intention was clearly a verbatim transcription; emendations to this text would then highlight the author's artistic reworking of his source. 28 But even if we do not accept this perhaps extreme procedure, it should be evident that the sources of borrowed passages can play a key role in the editorial process, and must often be accounted for in the establishment of a definitive text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1762), VI, 132. 2 (1940), p. 463, n. 1. Sterne definitely quotes from Burton three chapters later. 3 Jean Fernel, Universa medicina (Coloniæ Allobrogum, Apud Samuelum de Tournes, 1679), p. 135; the work was first published in 1554. 4 Anatomy of Melancholy (1621), p. 84 (facs. repr. Amsterdam, 1971). Burton cites " Fernelius path. lib. I. cap. II " in the paragraph where the sentence occurs; the "Pathology" is included in the Universa medicina and the sentence in question is also found in 1.11. 5 Possibly the change argues that he was quoting from memory, but since he uses Burton at length a few chapters later, we probably should assume he had the Anatomy close by. 6 Tristram Shandy (1765), VIII, 111n.: 'Rodope Thracia tam inevitabili fascino instructa, tam exacte oculis intuens attraxit, ut si in illam quis incidesset, fieri non posset, quin caperetur.' Cf. Burton, 3.2.2.3., p. 565n. Sterne also changes Burton's 'Rodophe' to 'Rodope', but since it occurs again thus in the text, we can assume it was a conscious alteration. 7 Tristram Shandy (1761), IV, p. 45n. 8 (1734-38), s.v. Luther, p. 935. 9 '[5] Planetarum coitio sub Scorpio Asterismo in nonâ cœli statione . . . .' Strictly speaking, 'Asterismo' is the ablative object of the preposition 'sub', while 'Scorpii' in Bayle is a possessive form dependent upon 'Asterismo' (i.e., "in the constellation of Scorpio"). Setting aside a compositorial error there are two possible explanations for Sterne's change: he may have had the English form of the name in mind, or the other nearby forms ending in -o ('coitio' and 'Asterismo') may have facilitated a slip of the pen. In actuality, the first edition prints 'Scarpio', an obvious misprint, corrected by the concealed second edition. The accenting of 'nonâ' is Sterne's and is another small indication of his command of Latin. 10 Swinburne went through many editions; I quote from that of 1611, Part 4, ii (London: Company of Stationers, 1611), p. 127. In this case, the particular edition Sterne used does not seem as important as elsewhere. 11 The citation almost certainly refers to Sassoferrato Bartolo (1314-1357), the Italian jurist, perhaps his Universum Civile Commentaria . . . studio et opera Iacobi Concenatii , 1562. 12 Swinburne, Part 3, xvi, p. 113, and Part 2, xxvii, p. 69. With sufficient patience one could perhaps find in the margins of Swinburne every one of the "learned formulas" Sterne uses. The inspiration for the note itself came, almost certainly, from Rabelais' Judge Bridlegoose. Book III, Chapters xxxix-xli (trans. Urquart and Motteux [1750], III, 260-279). 13 Cf. Tristram Shandy (1761), III, 166: 'he got hold of Prignitz ,—purchased Scroderus . . . .' 14 Sterne used the Paris, 1722, edition of Jugemens des Savans sur les Principaux Ouvrages des Auteurs . . . Revûs, corrigés, &amp; augmentés par M. De La Monnoye de l'Académie Françoise , s.v. Liceti and Lipse. The borrowed passages occur in IV, Chapter 10, and VI, Chapter 2. The reading of the first and second editions, Les Enfans célèbres , is almost certainly Sterne's error. 15 It has been argued elsewhere, however, that the accenting in the Deventer "Memoire" (Volume I) should be treated differently, since in this one case the accenting was most likely compositorial rather than Sterne's. See Melvyn New, " Tristram Shandy and Heinrich van Deventer's Observations ," PBSA , 69 (1975) 84-90. 16 "The Curse of Ernulphus," Harvard Library Bulletin , 14 (1960), 394. Cross's assertion appears in his Life and Times of Laurence Sterne , 3rd ed. (1929), p. 27on. The error persists in Ian Watt's edition of Tristram (1965), p. 128, n. 1. 17 Hearne had been cited by Work (p. 170, n. 4) twenty years earlier. The curse appears on pages 55-58 of Hearne's work. Sterne makes about thirty changes in punctuation and about ten in accenting, in addition to the changes we shall discuss. He also misnumbers the document as 'Cap. XXV', where Hearne has 'Cap. 35'. 18 Gwin J. Kolb ("A Note on 'Tristram Shandy': Some New Sources," N&amp;Q , 196 [1951], 227) suggests Richard Steele's Englishman , no. 53; a collation of both the Latin and English clearly illustrates that it could not have been the source of either. 19 Tristram Shandy , III, 40; in quoting Hearne, and Sterne's Latin, we have omitted the superscribed rubrics for altering the number of malefactors to be cursed. Neither the GM nor Sterne translates 'æternis'; the Englishman , no. 53 reads 'that he may be delivered over to be tortured by eternal Tortures' (Richard Steele, The Englishman [1714], p. 244). 20 All these forms in Sterne are recognized variants of the forms in Hearne, though Sterne's are somewhat less usual. In the case of 'quatuor', Sterne repeats his variant in "Slawkenbergius's Tale" ( TS. IV. 16). The "Tale" illustrates well Sterne's skill with Latin; its accuracy suggests that he prepared his copy or proofread it more carefully than his borrowings, though here too the few errors are probably the result of Sterne's hand: ' titigimus ' (p. 8) and ' perveneo ' (p. 20), corrected in the second edition to ' tetigimus ' and ' pervenio '. The "Tale" was not reset for the second edition, so that these emendations to standing type indicate the particular care taken to have an accurate text. Why ' laciniato ' (p. 14) should have been changed in standing type to ' baciniato ' eludes us, however; and quite probably ' respondet ' (p. 16) should have been emended to ' respondit ', for the sake of consistency of tense, though no change was made in the second edition. 21 Each of these forms calls for commentary. 'Patriarchum', 'manubus', and 'guttere' are all forms which, though not correct, might have occurred in texts available to Sterne. They represent analogical over-extensions of Latin patterns which are in fact correct for other nouns. Since 'patriarcha' is a Greek loan word, it might conceivably occur with its Greek ending; however, it usually appears in the plural with its Latin ending, i.e., 'patriarcharum', as Sterne has it at a later point (p. 44). Likewise, 'manubus' should probably be emended, since "hands" occurs twice in "Slawkenbergius's Tale" as ' manibus ' ( TS. IV. 10, 20), though it may have occurred by analogy with a few other nouns of its class (cf. arcus~arcubus ). 'Guttere' might also conceivably represent an erroneous overextension of the declensional type (cf. vulnus~vulnere ), but probably should be emended, though the word does not recur in Tristram . 'Respuerit' comes from the verb meaning "to spew out," and obviously the meaning needed in context is that of 'resipuerit', to "come to his senses," i.e., "repent." Finally, the form 'harnis' would seem to be a simple error for Hearne's 'harmis'. As with the preceding word in the catalogue of bodily parts, 'humeris' (i.e., 'umeris'), 'harmis' (i.e., 'armis') is usually translated as "shoulders," though "upper arms" is also possible. Sterne follows the GM in translating it as "wrists," a word for which there is no Latin equivalent. The original text does read 'harmis' ( Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile , ed. Peter Sawyer [1957], VII); so one can assume some differentiation existed in medieval Latin between it and 'humeris'. 22 Hearne, p. 55. Hearne calls attention also to the error 'in infemore' (p. 58), which Sterne has correctly as 'in femore' (p. 50). 23 Work, p. 176. GM has "in their fore teeth or grinders." The original text, as reproduced by Sawyer, reads 'in labris, sive molibus'; because the error seems typical of a medieval copyist ('labiis' appears on the line following) and is the sort of error a modern scholar would emend in a medieval text, we believe it is worth emending in Sterne; had the reading originated with Sterne, we would not alter it in any way. 24 'Toe-nails' seems quite legitimate for 'unguibus' here, as the curse moves down the lower extremities. 25 Cf. Tristram Shandy , III, 62: '. . . knittings of the joints, and articulations . . . .' 26 The GM translates it. Sterne also fails to translate 'vigilando' ( GM : 'waking'), but this can be explained by the next word in the series which is 'walking'; his eye, following the GM , could easily have jumped. 27 See Sterne, A Sentimental Journey , ed. Gardner D. Stout, Jr. (1967), p. 49, n. 3. 28 New has argued for precisely this procedure in dealing with Deventer's Observations ("The Sorbonne Memoire"); see above, n. 15.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">'For Friendship's Sake': Some Additions to Blake's Sheets for Designs to a Series of Ballads (1802) by Karen G. Mulhallen</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The history of Blake's association with the poet, biographer and patron William Hayley is well known. 1 Blake executed a number of projects for Hayley, perhaps the most entrepreneurial of which was a collection of ballads entitled Designs to A Series of Ballads (1802). 2 The series of ballads, as Hayley notes in his preface, was to be a periodical publication. Every month for fifteen months Blake proposed to publish a ballad accompanied by three engravings. The whole series would ultimately be a quarto volume of forty-five engravings and fifteen ballads, "which indeed I wish to be considered as vehicles contrived to exhibit the diversified talents of my friend for original design and delicate engraving." The venture was not a success. Blake received the printed sheets from Joseph Seagrave and when sales failed cut up the sheets and used the generous margins — especially the inner margin of approximately twelve centimetres (the outer is seven centimetres) — for sketch paper. Blake's association with Hayley has been carefully documented in a number of articles and monographs. Blake used the proof sheets of Designs to A Series of Ballads as scratch paper for more than two decades. Ten of these proofs have been identified by G. E. Bentley, Jr., in "The Date of Blake's Pickering Manuscript or The Way of a Poet with Paper," Studies in Bibliography , 19 (1966), 237-241: one for the title page, verso; four for page 9; two for pages 20 and 26; one for pages 21 and 24; one for page 37; and one for pages 41-48. To this list we may now add eleven more: (1) Preface , pp. iii-iv. This sheet has no sketches or writing by Blake and is used as the inner wrapper for the Job sketches, Folio 2, in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England. The recto of iv is inscribed by John Linnell, "These are Mr Blakes reduced Drawings | for the book of Job | done for me | John Linnell." 3 The verso is blank. The subject indicates a date of c. 1823. (2) Ballad the First , pp. [9]-10. This sketch of a nude woman lying with her back toward the viewer is on the back last page, page 9, of the first ballad, The Elephant . The colophon and the last two lines of stanza 24 show through from page 9. Blake used a similar female figure in his drawings for Young's Night Thoughts on the last page of Night V (1929.7.13.108). The figure is also similar to one in a sketch of "Paolo and Francesca" done for his Dante illustrations (reproduced in Drawings of William Blake [1970] as No. 86). The sketch is now in the British Museum Print Room (1867.10.12.192). The probable date of composition is c. 1826. Vouched by Frederick Tatham, bottom left. (3) Ballad the Second , pp. [19]-20, 25-26. A man with arms outstretched, palms open outward, runs from a gothic church with a closed door. On the page is visible the catchword With and a t shows through from page 26 ([ breas ] t ). This sketch is catalogued as No. 87 in the Kerrison Preston edition of The Blake Collection of W. Graham Robertson (1952), and it is now in a private collection. About 1809 Blake experimented with the church form as the central organizing motif in a number of his sketches, for example in the "Descent of Peace," which is reproduced in Drawings (1970) as No. 49. The probable date of composition therefore is c. 1809. Vouched by Tatham, bottom left. (4) Ballad the Second, The Eagle , pp. [21]-22-[23]-24. On page 24, with the catchword Run , is a sketch for "The Death of the Strong Wicked Man," for Blair's Grave (1808), which is reproduced in Drawings (1970) as No. 39. On the verso, identified as page 22 by the catchword It , is a sketch for "The Ascension" (?1805). This sheet is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the dates of use therefore are 1805 and 1808. (5) Ballad the Second , pp. [21]-22-23-[24.] A man, with his hands raised in horror, looks up at a circle containing a church. Above is a man, upside down, running toward the left. On the sheet, at the bottom left, is visible the catchword It from page 22, and showing through from page 24 is the catchword Run . The sketch is catalogued as No. 86 in The Blake Collection of W. Graham Robertson (1952). On its verso is a rough sketch of a woman weeping over an infant, there are two standing figures with bowed heads at the side, over the woman is a building from which hang two flags (?) and above them is a crescent moon. Because of the similarity between the running man in this sketch and that in number (3), the probable date of composition is c. 1809. Vouched by Tatham, bottom left. (6) Ballad the Second , pp. [25]-26. A wave of people rises up from the ground whilst in the background are a couple and a gothic church sketchily outlined. The letter t of the word breast identifies the sheet as page 26. The sketch may be for Dante (c. 1826) for "The Circle of the Lustful," but the couple embrace as in the design for Blair's Grave of "A Family Meeting in Heaven" (c. 1808) and the church suggests the earlier attribution as well. Reproduced in Drawings (1970) as No. 87, this drawing is now in the Rosenwald Collection, Washington, and the probable date of use is either c. 1808 or c. 1826. (7) Ballad the Third, The Lion , pp. [27]-28. A back view of Satan with a sword is shown, similar to the tiny winged figure of plate 4 of Blake's Job (1826). The sketch is executed on page 28, showing the word [ tr ] uth . Now in the Keynes collection, it is reproduced in Drawings (1970) as No. 75, and it should be given a date of c. 1826. (8) Ballad the Third , pp. [29]-30-31-[32]. A pencil drawing of an angelic female with mandala-like wings and a large fan. On the page is visible the catchword But and the last two words, ] r [ each and ] m [ ore , of the final lines in stanza 10 on page 31. Showing through is the catchword Soon from page 32. This design is for the figure found in Jerusalem , plate 14. The sketch is now in the British Museum Print Room (1874.12.12.150). The date is 1804-?1820. (9) Ballad the Third , pp. [31]-32. A man with a halo, holding in his outstretched hands either two globes of light or two urns, balances on the edge of an abyss. Behind him, on his left, is a bird with gigantic claws who eats an entrail from the man's right side. The bird and man are flanked by two observant angels. The right hand angel holds a book; the left hand angel holds a chain. The sketch is executed in pencil and ink sideways on page 32 which shows the word [ drea ] d; . Catalogued in The Blake Collection of W. Graham Robertson , No. 92, this drawing is untraced. (10) Ballad the Third , pp. 37-38. This sheet is used as the outer wrapper of the Job sketches in the Fitzwilliam Museum, and it is folded so that page 38 faces outward. The recto of page 38 has thirty attempts at a monogram w B or WB in Blake's hand. The verso of page 38 has nineteen attempts to write WB, plus Blake's signature and date "inv &amp; sc/ WB/ 1823". Page 37 (verso) has a sketch of Job's head for plate 8 of Job in the inner margin plus stanza 31 of page 37 and a list of the twelve apostles. The recto of page 37 has two sketches of a dog's head for plate 1 of Job and four lines of stanza 29 plus line one of stanza 30. These sheets are catalogued in William Blake: An Illustrated Catalogue of Works in the Fitzwilliam Museum Cambridge , edited by David Bindman (1970), as No. 18B1 and No. 1B10 (Fol. 1 = page 38 r and 37 v ; Fol. 34 = 37 r and 38 v ). (11) Ballad the Fourth , The Dog , pp. 42-43, 44-[45]-46. This sheet contains several sketches and stanzas 6 and 7 of "The Dog." The sketches include, from lower left to upper right: "Cain fleeing" from "Adam and Eve find the Body of Abel"; a sketch for the Paradise Lost series; two sketches for "The Archangel Michael Binding The Dragon"; and a mirror sketch of the frontispiece to "The Dog." The sheet is now in the British Museum Print Room (1929, 7. 13. 272). The date is probably c. 1805. Vouched by Tatham, upper left. There are now some twenty-one instances of Blake using his proof sheets from Designs to a Series of Ballads . Undoubtedly more will come to light.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Hazlitt, Reynolds, and the Edinburgh Review by Leonidas M. Jones</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Warier than his predecessors, F. R. Waller and Arnold Glover, in their Complete Works of William Hazlitt , 1 P. P. Howe did not reprint in his own Complete Works 2 all the articles from the Edinburgh Review attributed to Hazlitt. In his Life of William Hazlitt 3 and in notes to the Complete Works (XVI, 419-421), he demonstrated carefully and convincingly that six reviews long associated with Hazlitt ought not to be regarded as chiefly from his hand. Howe did, however, reprint from the Edinburgh of December 1818 the review of Letters of Horace Walpole (XVI, 138-152), the prose style of which is so similar to Hazlitt's elsewhere that there was no apparent reason to doubt it. The personal directness and vigorous enthusiasm sound exactly like Hazlitt. Most of the quotations used to decorate the prose in the standard Hazlitt fashion appear, either wholly or in part, in other work certainly by Hazlitt. But Howe slipped momentarily and forgot what he knew better than anyone else had before him, that Hazlitt had a young disciple of very great talent who so idolized him and who was so steeped in his work that he wrote prose almost indistinguishable from his master's. For John Hamilton Reynolds, as well as for Keats, there was one God, Shakespeare, and Hazlitt was His prophet. He followed Hazlitt's every word; he read Hazlitt's essays aloud in company to his friends; 4 he echoed Hazlitt's ideas and catch-phrases; and he repeated his quotations. The most extreme example of the last was Reynolds' following Hazlitt faithfully after Hazlitt had been led astray by Charles Lamb's confused recollection of what he thought was a passage from Dante: "Because on earth their names | In Fame's eternal volume shine for aye." Although the passage, which had only the faintest possible basis in Dante, resulted from what Lamb called his "Lying memory," Hazlitt was struck by it, accepted it at face value, and quoted it in The Round Table (IV, 23, 369). Since it was good enough for Hazlitt, it was certainly good enough for Reynolds, who borrowed the second line from The Round Table to include in an essay in the Champion . 5 One cannot rely upon the quotations in the review of Letters of Horace Walpole as proof of Hazlitt's hand. For example, both Hazlitt and Reynolds used elsewhere a brief passage which appears there: "He is himself—alone" (XVI, 146). 6 Before publication of the review, Hazlitt had used slight variations of the passage in A View of the English Stage (V, 183), Characters of Shakespear's Plays (IV, 192), and Lectures on the English Poets (V, 131). But in the Champion of 27 July 1817, Reynolds had quoted precisely those four words: "He is himself,—alone" ( Selected Prose , p. 119). It is impossible to separate Hazlitt from Reynolds by such quotations because they shared them. On two other occasions Howe learned the hard way how difficult it is to distinguish between Hazlitt's and Reynolds' prose. Trusting to his knowledge of Hazlitt's style, he reprinted in New Writings of Hazlitt: Second Series the theatrical review from the Examiner of 9 July 1820 and a review of Allan Cunningham's Sir Marmaduke Maxwell from the London Magazine of November 1822. 7 Later learning that Reynolds wrote both, he corrected the errors in Complete Works (XVIII, 471-472). It is not at all surprising that Howe should have been deceived; Hazlitt himself paid tribute to the success of Reynolds' imitation by linking him as " alter et idem " with himself (XVIII, 353). But until now the error in attributing the review of Letters of Horace Walpole in the Edinburgh to Hazlitt has gone uncorrected. It is curious that one word used twice in the review should deny Hazlitt's authorship and establish Reynolds': "Cowper hath unwittingly beguiled us of many a long hour, by his letters to Lady Hesketh" and "[Walpole's] garrulity, moreover, hath a genius of its own" (XVI, 141, 146, italics supplied). Hazlitt did not use the obsolete form for the third person singular of the verb. In A New and Improved Grammar of the English Tongue (1809), he stated emphatically that hath is "Now never used, except in poetry, or on very solemn occasions" (II, 47). He reinforced the point by his later statement in the Grammar that "the most common construction is always the least objectionable" (II, 86-87), a position which Howe calls his "general principle" (II, 288). He repeatedly and consistently favored currency of language and disapproved archaism in Lectures on the English Poets (V, 104-105), in "On Familiar Style" (VIII, 242-248), in the discussion of Horne Tooke in The Spirit of the Age (XI, 47-57), and in "English Grammar" (XX, 212-215). Hazlitt's practice agreed impeccably with his principle. He used has thousands of times without a single hath in all the other work which he contributed to the Edinburgh Review (XVI) and in all the books which he published in 1817 and 1818: The Round Table , Characters of Shakespear's Plays , Lectures on the English Poets , and A View of the English Stage . 8 It seems highly unlikely that he ever in any of his works found a "very solemn occasion" to warrant the use of hath . The two haths in the review in question could not have resulted from editorial interpolation because Francis Jeffrey also used only has . 9 Unlike Hazlitt, John Hamilton Reynolds did occasionally and arbitrarily allow himself the license to lapse into hath for the third person singular. In 1817 and 1818 he used hath in his prose no less than eleven times: in the theatrical reviews for the Champion , 23 February 1817, p. 61, 29 June 1817, p. 206, 17 August 1817, p. 261, 2 November 1817, p. 349, and 14 December 1817, p. 397 (twice); in a review of Hazlitt's Characters of Shakespear's Plays for the Champion , 20, 27 July 1817, pp. 230, 237 (twice) (reprinted in Selected Prose , pp. 114, 117); in his letter to Keats of 14 October 1818 ( Letters , p. 12); and in a review of Hazlitt's Lectures on the English Comic Writers for the Scots Magazine of December 1818 ( Selected Prose , p. 232). The eleven instances are especially significant because the volume of Reynolds' prose checked is so much less than that of Hazlitt—perhaps one-thirtieth. Reynolds too used has most of the time, but he sometimes substituted hath . A quotation in the review in the Edinburgh corroborates Reynolds' hand: "[Walpole] sees only 'himself and the universe'" (XVI, 146). The phrase comes from The Round Table , where Hazlitt said of Wordsworth that "It is as if there were nothing but himself and the universe" (IV, 113). Although Hazlitt frequently reused not only phrases, but whole paragraphs and entire essays, he did not insert quotation marks for his own words. Certainly he would not think it necessary to be so scrupulous about such a brief phrase. But Reynolds would wish to set apart even four words by the author whom he had just called "one of the most vigorous and spirited writers of the present age." 10 It has long been known that Reynolds wrote something for the Edinburgh toward the close of 1818, though searchers for his work there have heretofore been frustrated by the erroneous attribution of the review of Letters of Horace Walpole to Hazlitt. On 16 December 1818, Keats wrote that Reynolds "has become an edinburgh Reviewer." 11 On 21 April 1821, Hazlitt wrote Hunt, "I got Reynolds to write in the Edinburgh Review , at a time when I had a great reluctance to ask any favour of Jeffrey, and from that time I never set eyes on him for a year and a half after." 12 Since Hazlitt was seeing Reynolds again in the summer of 1820 (XVIII, 471-472), the year and a half places Reynolds' contribution toward the close of 1818. On 13 July 1820, Reynolds wrote Jeffrey that he was reluctant to request "£40 or £50 on account" because he had "written so little hitherto" ( Letters , p. 19). Nothing remotely resembling Reynolds' style, other than the review of Letters of Horace Walpole , appears in the December 1818 issue of the Edinburgh —or for that matter in the surrounding issues of September 1818 or March 1819. External evidence combines with internal evidence from the journal itself to lead clearly to the conclusion that Reynolds wrote the review of Letters of Horace Walpole . Undoubtedly Reynolds' chief reasons for wishing to contribute were the prestige and remuneration which accompanied writing for the Edinburgh . The great Hazlitt himself wrote, "To be an Edinburgh Reviewer is, I suspect, the highest rank in modern literary society" (XII, 365). But an incidental advantage in reviewing this particular book was that it had been published by Reynolds' friend John Martin, whom he had known at least as early as 1814 when Martin published his Safie and Eden of Imagination and when Martin began printing Reynolds' poems and essays in his periodical, the Inquirer . Although the review is by no means a puff, it must nevertheless have been most welcome to Martin. The conclusion is especially interesting in this respect. Ostensibly Reynolds seems to be blaming Rodwell and Martin, and in the process he earns credit for objectivity: what a shame that so fascinating and valuable a book should be published in such an expensive edition, but, no matter, we expect that the demand will be so great that soon it will be republished in more economical form. What publisher would dislike that "attack"? Another passage acquires additional meaning from realization that Reynolds wrote it: A poet, in his private letters, seldom thinks it necessary to keep up the farce of feeling; but casts off the trickery of sentiment, and glides into the unaffected wit, or sobers quietly into the honest man. By his published works, we know that an author becomes a "Sir John with all Europe;" and it can only be by his letters that we discover him to be "Jack with his brothers and sisters, and John with his familiars." This it is that makes the private letters of a literary person so generally entertaining. He is glad to escape from the austerity of composition, and the orthodoxy of thought; and feels a relief in easy speculations or ludicrous expressions (XVI, 141). Although Reynolds proceeds to cite Gray and Cowper as examples of poets who wrote valuable letters, he must also have had in the back of his mind the priceless letters from Keats which he had been receiving for two years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 13 vols. (1902-1906). According to P. L. Chaver, "Hazlitt's Contributions to the Edinburgh Review ," R.E.S. , 4 (October 1928), 385, "Waller and Glover followed very closely the list given by Mr. Ireland in his work of 1868." In List of Writings of William Hazlitt and Leigh Hunt (1970 reprint from 1868), p. 75, Alexander Ireland merely lists works from the Edinburgh as by Hazlitt without specifying the basis for the attribution. Presumably he included the review of Letters of Horace Walpole because the style seems Hazlitt's, an understandable error for one who had read no Reynolds. 2 21 vols. (1930-1934).

      <field name="heading_text">Walter Bagehot: Some New Attributions by Robert H. Tener</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Bagehot and the Inquirer For nearly one hundred years Walter Bagehot has been known as the contributor who supplied the weekly Unitarian newspaper, the Inquirer , with a brilliant series of letters in 1852 on Louis Napoleon's coup d'état . 1 And for some time it has been realized that Bagehot's contributions were not confined to these letters, for I pointed out in the Times Literary Supplement a dozen years ago that an 1852 review of Lord Cockburn's life of Francis Jeffrey is unquestionably his, since much of the concluding paragraph was afterwards incorporated verbatim into his well-known essay on the founders of the Edinburgh Review . 2 Nevertheless, despite Bagehot's known association with the Inquirer , it would appear that no really thorough search through its files for additional material has ever been made, notwithstanding the statement of Bagehot's latest editor, Dr. St. John-Stevas, claiming that he and his research assistant had examined all the numbers of this weekly for which Bagehot could possibly have written but had found no new articles. 3 Recently, however, while making an inspection of the Inquirer over the four years of Bagehot's potential connection with it, I discovered that it yields at least seven articles which may be safely attributed to him, largely on internal evidence. (To these I add one new ascription from the Spectator .) The seven attributions from the Inquirer consist of three leading articles on current political matters, a review of Matthew Arnold, and a series of three letters on university reform. Although clearly not so significant as Bagehot's longer essays, they deserve to be known, for they provide us with glimpses of his earliest political views, demonstrate his continuing interest in higher education, and offer the sole instance of an article on Matthew Arnold's poetry in the entire corpus of his writings. 4 They also show that Bagehot had a much longer and somewhat closer connection with the Inquirer than the coup d'état letters in 1852 suggested. That connection was rather inexactly referred to by R. H. Hutton who first disclosed Bagehot's authorship of these letters: In 1851 a knot of young Unitarians, of whom I was then one, headed by the late J. Langton Sanford . . . had engaged to help for a time in conducting the Inquirer , which then was and still is the chief literary and theological organ of the Unitarian body. Our régime was, I imagine, a time of great desolation for the very tolerant and thoughtful constituency for whom we wrote . . . but I doubt if any of us caused the Unitarian body so much grief as Bagehot, who never was a Unitarian, but who contributed a series of brilliant letters on the coup d'état in which he trod just as heavily on the toes of his colleagues as he did on those of the public by whom the Inquirer was taken. 5 This account errs through inaccuracy and lack of detail. In fact, Bagehot's letters appeared in 1852, not 1851, and in fact—as has already been pointed out—the letters were not his only contribution. Indeed, the latter is suggested in the Inquirer's obituary on Bagehot, which asserted that he had "contributed many letters and reviews of great vivacity to this journal in the years 1851-2." 6 But just as that account, too, is in error about the date when Bagehot began to contribute, so it fails to indicate the number of years he was connected with the paper. Like most writers on Bagehot since, the author of the obituary seems to assume that he made no contributions after 1852. I will now show that he continued to write for the Inquirer until August, 1855. His connection with this weekly was obviously dependent upon the editorial tenure of his friends, R. H. Hutton and John Langton Sanford. I have recently provided evidence that proves conclusively that these two men were connected with the paper for four years, that Hutton contributed to it in 1851-52, that he seems to have been an assistant editor under Sanford for the last half of 1853, and that for the whole of 1854 and 1855 they were joint editors. 7 The period of this collaboration is crucial for Bagehot's contributions; not being a Unitarian himself, he was dependent on his two friends for entry into the Inquirer's sectarian columns. Hence, if there is no sign of his hand in these columns prior to his letters on Louis Napoleon, it is not surprising that there is nothing by him after 1855. What happened in between, however, is what we may turn to now. Bagehot's first letter on the coup d'état was published on January 10, 1852; the last of the seven letters appeared on March 6. On April 10 his review of Cockburn's life of Lord Jeffrey was published. The seven pieces I attribute to him on what is chiefly internal evidence appeared thereafter from 1853 to 1855, and are examined now in chronological order. (1) "Mr. Gladstone," Inquirer , May 7, 1853, p. 289. In his political and historical essays Bagehot repeatedly alludes to Lord Liverpool, Lord John Russell, Peel, and Disraeli; the author of this leading article does so, too. Bagehot often quotes from Milton, Macaulay, and John Henry Newman; the author does so here. And just as Bagehot remarked in his essay on Gladstone ( National Review , XI [July, 1860], 221, 238), that no one more "remarkably embodies" Oxford education than Gladstone, that the creed which Gladstone acquired at Oxford "broke down" when tried by the test of "real life," and that he therefore had to formulate his principles anew, so the Inquirer writer says: The truth is that Mr. Gladstone had a remarkable education. Oxford is a thoughtful place . . . To this potent influence it is quite certain that Mr. Gladstone yielded . . . It might not charm wisely, but it charmed well. The world breaks the spell. A young man forms principles that are to guide his life, and the moment he . . . gets into the arena of action he obtains new data and finds he must alter his principles again. So with Mr. Gladstone. His Oxford creed has melted away in Downing-street and St. Stephens. But the passages in this Inquirer leader which most strongly suggest Bagehot's hand are these: first, a favourite anecdote, and next, a parody. The favourite anecdote Bagehot quoted in identified writings published before and after this date. Speaking of the cabinet of Lord Liverpool as it flourished thirty years before, the Inquirer writer asserts, "When anything was too bad to be justified or defended, they were wont to say, 'we must apply our majority to this question.'" A year before, in his fifth letter to the Inquirer on the coup d'état (Feb. 7, 1852, p. 83), Bagehot remarked of the same period, "In those times, I have been told the great Treasury official of the day, Mr. George Rose . . . had a habit of observing, upon occasion of anything utterly devoid of decent defence, 'Well, well, this is a little too bad; we must apply our majority to this difficulty.'" And three years after the Inquirer leader, Bagehot remarked in his National Review essay on Peel (Vol. III, July, 1856, p. 167): "There is a legend that a distinguished Treasury official of the last century, a very capable man, used to say of any case which was hopelessly and inevitably bad: 'Ah, we must apply our majority to this question' . . ." One other passage in "Mr. Gladstone" may be paralleled with an almost verbatim reproduction of it in a well-known essay by Bagehot. In speaking of what is agreeable to Englishmen, the author of the Inquirer leader declared: We like a Chancellor of the Exchequer to say, "Mr. Speaker, I know that it has been said that two and two make four. My honourable friend the member for Montrose has during many years made himself conspicuous by advocating that assertion, and after a mature consideration of the entire subject, I must say I think there is a great deal which may be very fairly said in behalf of it, but without committing myself to that opinion as an abstract sentiment, I may be permitted to assume that two and two do not make five, which will be amply sufficient for all the operations which I propose to enter upon during the present year". . . Three months later, in "Shakespeare," Prospective Review , IX (August, 1853), 422, Bagehot presented almost exactly the same parody of Gladstone's guarded verbosity as an illustration of what the British public likes: They like a chancellor of the exchequer to say, "It has during very many years been maintained by the honourable member for Montrose that two and two make four, and I am free to say, that I think there is a great deal to be said in favour of that opinion, but, without committing her Majesty's government to that proposition as an abstract sentiment, I will go so far as to assume two and two are not sufficient to make five, which, with the permission of the House, will be a sufficient basis for all the operations which I propose to enter upon during the present year." (2) "Empedocles on Etna," Inquirer , August 27, 1853, pp. 548-549. Completely characteristic of Bagehot are the allusions to Thiers, Louis Napoleon, and Carlyle in this review. The flavour of his style and manner emerges clearly in both the following passages, the first of which concludes on a note of Bagehotian realism. It is said that M. Thiers and other able persons wished Louis Napoleon to withdraw his own address to the French people (it was when he was a candidate for the presidency) and to adopt one prepared by that practised writer in the common language of diplomacy. The prince was silent, after his manner, but took occasion to consult Emile de Girardin; "Soyez vous-même," replied the shrewd editor of the Presse , " c'est ce qu'il y a de mieux ." And this should be a maxim in literature. "Be yourself:" it may not be much, but it is all you can be, in acting, or speaking, or writing. . . . Not only did Bagehot frequently refer to Thiers the year before in his Inquirer letters on Louis Napoleon's coup d'état , but he also wrote at length in Letter VI (February 14, 1852, p. 99) of "The celebrated Emile de Girardin," "the old editor and founder of the Presse ," and the "leading French journalist" of his day. Bagehot assures his correspondent that in consequence he reads the Presse regularly. Very probably, then, de Girardin's advice about being oneself lies behind what Bagehot wrote in the meantime concerning style, for in his well-known essay on Hartley Coleridge ( Prospective Review , VIII [November, 1852], 529) we find this: ". . . we believe that the knack in style is to write like a human being. Some think they must be wise, some elaborate, some concise; Tacitus wrote like a pair of stays; some would startle, as Thomas Carlyle, or a comet, inscribing with his tail. But legibility is given to those who neglect these notions, and are willing to be themselves . . ." This passage from "Hartley Coleridge" reminds us of another clue to authorship in the review of Empedocles on Etna , its reference to Thomas Carlyle: "It has been said that Mr. Carlyle's book on the French Revolution reads like an affidavit; ' this , I, Thomas Carlyle, came and perceived' . . ." Although "reads like an affidavit" is not so witty as "wrote like a pair of stays," the form of the expression is parallel. Moreover, Bagehot's essays contain numerous references to Carlyle. To mention only those which were published before this review, he is cited in the essays on Festus , Oxford, and Shakespeare, as well as in the one on Hartley Coleridge and in the letters on the coup d'état ; indeed, in the first essay his French Revolution is referred to at length. The humour in this review is consonant with Bagehot's authorship. Of the poems in the volume being appraised, the reviewer writes: "This is what 'A' has thought of the universe; it may not be a compliment to the latter . . ." And of the strange tranquilizing effects which civilization has on men (always potentially violent) the reviewer remarks, "That a grown man should be found to write reviews is in itself a striking fact. Suppose you asked Achilles to do such a thing, do you imagine he would consent?" The Inquirer's comments on Shelley remind us of Bagehot's lifelong admiration of that poet. The reviewer speaks of the fascination and the power of Shelley's writings, "especially at a certain period of life . . . [though of] defects and shortcomings . . . it is not difficult for a matured taste to find many, both ethical and artistic . . ." This seems to be in brief form what Bagehot later wrote of Shelley more discursively in "Tennyson's Idylls ," National Review , IX (October, 1859), 370-371: . . . nearly all the poetry of Shelley . . . finds its way more easily to the brains of young men, who are at once intellectual and excitable, than to those of men of any other kind . . . In the greatest poets, in Shakespeare and in Homer, there is a great deal besides poetry. There are broad descriptions of character, dramatic scenes, eloquence, argument, a deep knowledge of manly and busy life. These interest readers who are no longer young . . . Shelley and Keats, on the other hand, have presented their poetry to the world in its pure essence . . . they have been content to rely on imaginatively expressed sentiment, and sentiment-exciting imagery; in short, on that which in its more subtle sense we call poetry, exclusively and wholly. In consequence . . . young men, who were not poets, have eagerly read them, have fondly learned them, and long remembered them. The Inquirer reviewer describes life in the modern world in ways strongly reminiscent of Bagehot the social psychologist: The essence of civilization, as we know, is dulness. In an ultimate analysis, it is only an elaborate invention, or series of inventions for abolishing the fierce passions, the unchastened enjoyments, the awakening dangers, the desperate conflicts, to say all in one word, the excitements of a barbarous age, and to substitute for them indoor pleasures, placid feelings, and rational amusements. This passage reads like a compact version of the famous doctrine that Bagehot had scattered through his letters the year before on the coup d'état , for even there "dulness" is used as a synonym for the more notorious "stupidity" which Bagehot preached as being essential to social order. There Bagehot had argued (Letter III, January 24, 1852, p. 52) that the "something" in national character which secures social order, "the most essential mental quality for a free people, whose liberty is to be progressive, permanent, and on a large scale . . . is much stupidity." He then adds as illustration: Not to begin by wounding any present susceptibilities, let me take the Roman character — for, with one great exception — I need not say to whom I allude — they are the great political people of history. Now, is not a certain dullness their most visible characteristic? . . . I need not say that in real sound stupidity, the English are unrivalled . . . Or take Sir Robert Peel — our last great statesman, the greatest Member of Parliament that ever lived, an absolutely perfect transacter of public business — the type of the nineteenth century Englishman, as Sir R. Walpole was of the eighteenth. Was there ever such a dull man? Throughout the letters on the coup d'état , but especially in Letters IV and V, Bagehot had argued that the desire for revolution—for what he calls "excitement"—needs constant curbing if order is to be secured. A like idea is discerned by the Inquirer reviewer in Arnold's poems. He remarks that in them we perceive a mind "whose great feeling is a longing for keen excitement, and at the same time a clear persuasion that such excitement is impossible . . ." The Inquirer next criticizes Empedocles on Etna for the many faults in its execution and remarks that "it can hardly be reckoned among the best of our author's compositions." However, the reviewer concedes that the poem does contain "some fine lines"; he then quotes the whole of Act II, ll. 235-275, the lines beginning "And yet what days were those, Parmenides!" In "Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Browning; or Pure, Ornate, and Grotesque Art in English Poetry," National Review , New Series, I (November, 1864), 36-37, Bagehot states that Empedocles on Etna is "a poem undoubtedly containing defects and even excesses," but then quotes as evidence that Arnold's work nevertheless contains unquestionable poetry exactly the same lines as are found in the Inquirer review. 8 Perhaps the strongest piece of internal evidence supporting Bagehot's authorship of this review is the phrase it adopts from philosophy, a phrase of Plato's which was peculiarly memorable to Bagehot. The reviewer speaks of a mind which strives for autonomy and independence, a mind which "has got rid of the lumber of ages—has disdained ancient fables and tedious traditions—has gone out 'itself by itself,' as the old philosophy used to speak—has seen, thus alone, a distinct vision of life, and has related it to us, if not in the best of words, at least in those that are most characteristic of itself." The previous year, in his essay on Hartley Coleridge ( Prospective Review , VIII [November, 1852], 533), Bagehot had remarked of the poetry of self-delineation: "The first requisite of this poetry is truth. It is in Plato's phrase the soul 'itself by itself' aspiring to view and take account of the particular notes and marks that distinguish it from all other souls." Five years after the Inquirer review, Bagehot, in "Charles Dickens," National Review , VIII (October, 1858), 461-462, wrote that in the mind which applies itself to theory "the deductive understanding, which masters first principles, and makes deductions from them, the thin ether of the intellect, — the 'mind itself by itself,'—must evidently assume a great prominence." And Bagehot goes on to describe the mind of Plato. But much later, in his English Constitution , Bagehot recalled Plato's phrase in connection with the mind which extracts from itself the essential truths about reality and then posited an old philosopher who fancied that by ardent excogitation "he might by pure deduction evolve the entire Universe. Intense self-examination, and intense reason would, he thought, make out everything. The soul 'itself by itself,' could tell all it wanted if it would be true to its sublimer isolation." 9 The presence of the philosophical phrase, "itself by itself," in this Inquirer review of 1853 makes it nearly certain to my mind that Bagehot was the author. But what clinches the matter, I believe, is a piece of external evidence. This external clue is a letter printed long ago in Mrs. Barrington's Life of Bagehot , the significance of which has escaped the attention of students of Bagehot probably because they looked in the wrong place for the article Bagehot proposed writing, in the Prospective Review instead of in the Inquirer . From Langport on August 15, 1853, Bagehot wrote to Richard Hutton: "By way of the next step I strongly advise you to write the article on Atheism which you mentioned and to get the review made over to you as soon as may be. I should like to write for you a short article on the new Series of M. Arnold's poems. They are not very much in themselves, but they show character and afford, I think, matter for a short paper and no reading up of any subject will be necessary, which is a great blessing and consideration." 10 Bagehot's mention of a "review" in this letter has no doubt led scholars to look into the Prospective Review for the article he proposed. If they had realized that at this time Hutton was also assisting as editor of the Inquirer , and in that capacity was soliciting contributions from his friends, they would in all probability have turned up this review of Arnold's poems. But they would also have discovered in the same issue on pp. 546-547 a leading article entitled "English Atheism" which in my opinion contains strong evidence of Hutton's hand. Bagehot's letter, then, is valuable external evidence for the authorship of the only review he ever produced on the poetry of Matthew Arnold and for one of the earliest articles by his most intimate friend. (3-5) "On the Organization and Extension of the Universities—Three Letters" Bagehot first expressed his views on the universities in mid-Victorian Britain in the essay which he published two years before this series of letters: "Oxford," Prospective Review , VIII (August, 1852), 347-392. That essay was a commentary on the Royal Commission report on Oxford, a commission established by Lord John Russell; the letters represent Bagehot's response to Lord John's bill which sprang from the report, and gave him an opportunity not only to repeat his remarks on the nature and function of universities in a complex, modern society, but also to recapitulate his ideas on the organization and administration of these institutions. Not surprisingly, then, we find in the letters passages which closely parallel remarks in the essay. And Bagehot being Bagehot, we not surprisingly also find in the letters something of the humour which enlivens the essay and other writings. (3) "The Universities—Letter I," Inquirer , March 25, 1854, pp. 187-188. In this letter the humour which seems to me to have a Bagehotian flavour occurs in the following passages on the first page. The Inquirer's correspondent writes: "It is a great advantage to be commonplace in your remarks (people say they are so just) . . ." Next, after announcing that he will discuss the driest topic connected with universities, the constitution of their governments, the writer says, "I cannot help the subject being tedious, though Lord John might reflect before he took the public into such places . . ." Somewhat maliciously the writer remarks in an aside, "I suppose stupidity is of no consequence in an infallible Pope . . ." A little later, after objecting that the Heads of Houses would be, in the Oxford of 1854, the worst persons to rule the university, he makes this concession: "In one respect . . . I maintain they excel all potentates—I mean that of personal grandeur. It has been said that they are too august. But this is only by captious and critical persons. Right feeling men, who have been permitted to see a grave head placidly doing nothing, will admit at once that they have observed the grandest and most imposing of human beings." Of the passages in the letter for which parallels may be found in the essay, the following seems to show Bagehot clarifying and making more explicit what he had written earlier: I believe the best rulers of the University are those who, having themselves been educated at it, having thoroughly profited by it, being examples of its very best effects, have yet in addition to all this, left the University, gone out into the world, and there learned which part of their education has been useful, and which not; in what they have been inferior to their competitors formed in other schools and from different methods of instruction; what their daily experience convinces them might be added to an old system, what rejected; which part of the new theories of the day is mischievous error, and which beneficial and practical truth. This appears to be an expansion upon the following passage in "Oxford" (p. 386): The best and most natural administrative and presiding government of a corporate body professing to promote the pursuits of education is, we suppose, an aristocracy of the persons educated there—a select body, in a great degree, at least, composed of those who have had a practical experience of the benefits and evils of that institution itself, and who have shown during the period of their education—or otherwise in after-life—that they were competent to appreciate the one and counteract the other. Of parallel passages, however, the most striking is a quotation from Bagehot's favourite novelist. The Inquirer correspondent writes, "You remember Sir Walter Scott used to aver 'there never was a Dominie who was not weak'." In the Oxford essay Bagehot wrote (p. 366): "'I never,' said Sir Walter Scott, 'knew a Dominie that was not weak'." (4) "On the Extension of the Universities—Letter II," Inquirer , April 1, 1854, pp. 196-197. The allusions to Bacon, Cobden, Wellington, and Derby are all characteristic of Bagehot (all are referred to in the essay on Oxford), and they show touches of his humour or parallelisms with his identified writings. For instance, the Inquirer correspondent humourously remarks that "it will be no longer, as in the last war, a principal parliamentary difficulty that the Duke of Wellington would persist in winning victories at places not mentioned in the classics." As for parallelisms, the writer further states, "Mr. Cobden took occasion, not long ago, to speak with disrespect of 'all the works of Thucydides' . . ." In the essay on Oxford, Bagehot had written that the uneducated man "knows as well as Mr. Cobden what is to be found in all the works of Thucydides . . ." (p. 366). Other kinds of parallelism are discoverable, as well. The writer in the Inquirer states, "An uneducated man has an opinion on every question which you ask him; some writer says that if you ask a common person what colour is the unseen side of the moon, he would have an answer ready . . ." In the essay on Oxford, Bagehot had written (p. 366), "An uneducated man has no notion of being without an opinion: he is distinctly aware whether Venus is inhabited . . ." (5) "On the Extension of the Universities—Letter III," Inquirer , April 15, 1854, pp. 226-227. This letter repeats several of the ideas which Bagehot had introduced into his essay on Oxford: that out of simple justice Dissenters should be admitted into Oxford and Cambridge, although in practical terms this would not result in much of an increase in their student bodies; that most people should not attend a university (it would disqualify them for living) but should receive a practical training in a trade; but that those people in the community who require an intellectual discipline in order to pursue a profession or to take broad views of modern society will find a university education indispensable. In this letter, too, something of Bagehot's humour appears: "The plan for a solicitor's education is to rear him in suits; for a miller's to involve him in flour; for a butcher's, to lead the dawning faculties gently and tenderly to the topic of meat." Parallels in sentence form, as well as in idea, may be found between this letter and Bagehot's writing elsewhere. The Inquirer correspondent states: "The great security for a man's perpetually thinking of his business is his not knowing anything else to think of; the great security for his doing his duty is his not knowing anything else to do." Two years before in the third letter on the coup d'état (January 24, 1852, p. 52) Bagehot had written: "The best security for people's doing their duty is that they should not know anything else to do; the best security for fixedness of opinion is that people should be incapable of comprehending what is to be said on the other side." Finally, in this last letter on university education the writer in the Inquirer employs at length an anecdote from Scott which Bagehot had used more briefly: You remember the story of Sir Walter Scott's conversational friend who tried the stranger in the stage coach with every subject of talk, and being proud of his ability to converse with every one, burst out at last with, "Sir, what is your line? I have talked to you on everything—on politics, religion, literature, everything a man can take interest in, and you've said nothing. What would you like to converse on?" "Sir," replied the stranger, "can you say anything interesting on bend leather ?" In "Oxford," Prospective Review , VIII (August, 1852), 366, Bagehot declared that "literary men as much over-estimate the importance of literature as the currier in the legend the repulsive resources of the substance leather." What, for me, puts the capstone on this argument that Bagehot wrote these letters on university reform is the fact that each letter, like each of the letters on the coup d'état , is signed "Amicus." (6) "Aristocratic and Unaristocratic Statesmen," Inquirer , April 28, 1855, pp. 257-258. Bagehot refers to Paley, Napoleon, Palmerston, and Lowe in his identified writings; the author of this leading article does so, too. The humour in this article, though subdued, is reminiscent of Bagehot's. For instance, the author says that it cannot be denied that the traditional English view that statesmen should be gentlemen has been recently assailed: Mr. Layard ascribes to it all our evils. Mr. Lowe denounces it as a superstition. A warm-tempered military gentleman mentions it as a "cold shade." Excluded politicians candidly confess that they cannot see the reason of it. For nearly three days the Times wrote consistently against it. Such remarkable phenomena seem to require an explanation. Though the irony that sharpens those last two sentences is absent from my next example, there is a Bagehotian echo in it: the Inquirer writer remarks that Lord Chancellors are "authorised vulgarities," a phrase which brings to mind Bagehot's remark that George III was "a consecrated obstruction." And the author of this leading article concludes his defence of Britain's current statesmen with a term (italics mine) which similarly evokes the flavour of Bagehot's wit: "We must adhere to the Aborigines of Downing-street; after all, they are the best that we have." The writer in the Inquirer argues that though it is often said that higher education disqualifies men from practical life, we must not forget that it can also make us more qualified: The manual efficiency of cultivated men is often poor and small, but their interior judgment is commonly accurate and distinguishing. . . . Throw . . . [fine minds] into a mass of discordant difficulties and confused perplexities, and they will choose at once the delicate and latent points on which the decision really turns. This seems to be similar to what Bagehot wrote three years before in his essay on Oxford ( Prospective Review , VIII [August, 1852], 368): . . . in the practical concerns of life, though a prolonged education rather interferes than otherwise with a perfect and instinctive mastery of a narrow department, though it disqualifies men for special or mechanical labour and the petty habits of a confined routine, yet for affairs on a considerable scale, for a general estimate of general probabilities . . . a carefully-formed mind and a large foundation of diversified knowledge are indisputably wonderful and all but indispensable aids. When to the Inquirer's remarks given in the quotation above, which puts gentlemen into the practical affairs of government, we add its opening statement that the English "wish to be governed by gentlemen," we can see that the writer is very close to Bagehot's recommendation at the end of his essay on Peel ( National Review , III [July, 1856], 174), that for statesmen "you must be content with what you can obtain—the business-gentleman." Finally, one brief quotation can be paralleled in one of Bagehot's essays. The writer in the Inquirer speaks of the "'great manslaying profession' (as Carlyle called it)." In "Edward Gibbon," National Review , II (January, 1856), 1, Bagehot wrote of "the 'great manslaying profession' (as Carlyle calls it) . . ." (7) "Statesmen," Inquirer , August 4, 1855, pp. 481-482. Like Bagehot in so many of his political writings, the author of this first leader refers to Burke, Chatham, Aberdeen, Palmerston, Peel, Russell, and Gladstone. And as Bagehot does so often in essays both literary and political, the writer here mentions Plato and quotes Sir Walter Scott. But what is even more significant in this leading article is the number and nature of parallel passages. Indeed, so much of the material here anticipates almost verbatim several passages in Bagehot's famous essay on Sir Robert Peel, published the following year, that this Inquirer article looks like a first draft. There is space here for only a few parallels. For instance, the Inquirer has this (p. 481): The essence of popular liberty is the persuasion of many persons. The " gouvernement des avocats ," as the Emperor Nicholas called it, has this for its principle, that the governing power is distributed and divided, and that if you wish to carry a great measure, or to recommend a great policy, the appeal is not to Richelieu or Nesselrode, not to a great statesman sitting in his closet, but to the mass of common people . . . In "The Character of Sir Robert Peel," National Review , III (July, 1856), 147, Bagehot wrote: When we speak of a free government, we mean a government in which the sovereign power is divided, in which a single decision is not absolute, where argument has an office. The essence of the "gouvernement des avocats," as the Emperor Nicholas called it, is that you must persuade so many persons. The appeal is not to the solitary decision of a single statesman; not to Richelieu or Nesselrode alone in his closet; but to the jangled mass of men . . . The writer in the Inquirer outlines what average men want (p. 481): "What they desire is a man who will carry out their views . . . Such a man they found in Sir Robert Peel . . . The powers of a first-rate man have seldom been so perfectly united with the creed of a second-rate man." In his National Review essay on Peel, Bagehot wrote (p. 150): "Our people would have statesmen who thought as they thought. If we wanted to choose an illustration of these remarks out of all the world, it would be Sir Robert Peel. No man has come so near our definition of a constitutional statesman—the powers of a first-rate man and the creed of a second-rate man." 11 Then, again, the writer in the Inquirer states (p. 481), "The most harrowing thing to the intellect is routine; the most confusing is distraction. Now the life of a Prime Minister is a distracting routine." In his essay on Peel in the National Review Bagehot writes (p. 160), "The most benumbing thing to the intellect is routine; the most bewildering is distraction: our system is a distracting routine." But the National Review is not the only journal of the day in which we can find Bagehot closely following what was written in this leader in the Inquirer . In "Average Government," Saturday Review , March 29, 1856, p. 429, he thus compresses the material given above in the first quotation from the Inquirer : "The condition of a free government is that you must persuade the present generation; and the gouvernement des avocats , as the Emperor Nicholas called it, has this for its principle—that you must persuade the average man." More important than that parallel, however, is a passage in the Saturday Review which, in its conclusion, provides an exact parallel to a passage from the Inquirer not yet quoted. The Inquirer states (p. 481): "'Public opinion, Sir,' said a competent person, 'means the opinion of the bald-headed man at the end of the omnibus.'" In the Saturday Review (p. 429) Bagehot wrote: "'It is all very well,' said an able Whig, 'for the Times to talk of the intelligence of public opinion . . . public opinion, Sir, is the opinion of the bald-headed man at the end of the omnibus.'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Bagehot and the Spectator After Bagehot took full control of the Economist in 1861 and Hutton ceased to be its literary editor and became instead in June of that year the literary editor and co-proprietor of the Spectator , the two men not only remained staunch friends but also from time to time in the 1860's and 1870's helped one another with contributions. It has been known for long that Bagehot contributed to the Spectator such articles as a review of Thackeray's Adventures of Philip (1862), an article on Boscastle in Cornwall (1866), a travel letter on Spain (1868), and an obituary of George Grote (1871). In the Times Literary Supplement (August 11, 1961, p. 515), I supplied evidence to show that Bagehot had written the subleader, "French Religiousness and M. Renan" (1863), which Dr. St. John-Stevas has subsequently included in his collected edition of Bagehot. Now I should like to suggest Bagehot's authorship of an earlier subleader. "The Trash of the Day," Spectator , September 7, 1861, pp. 976-977. The allusions to Gibbon, Lord Eldon, Palmerston, and Sir John Herschel are all characteristic of Bagehot. The phrase, "intellectual voluptuary," used of the unnamed statesman who avoided reading the last of the Waverley novels, appears in Bagehot's essay, "Sir George Cornewall Lewis," National Review , XVII (October, 1863), 500. The image which I now italicize in the statement, "A great deal of fine thought . . . lies, so to say, in solution in the literature of the time," can be found, somewhat apologetically, in Bagehot's "Tennyson's Idylls ," National Review , IX (October, 1859), 389: "The amount of thought which is held in solution, — if we may be pardoned so scientific a metaphor, — in Mr. Tennyson's poetry is very great." The adjective, "floating" ("the floating 'trash' of the literary world") is a favourite of Bagehot's: it appears, for instance, in the essays mentioned above on Peel, Tennyson, Renan, and on pure, ornate, and grotesque art, and in Bagehot's. well-known essays on Clough, and Sterne and Thackeray. Finally, two quotations may be paralleled in Bagehot's identified writings. The Spectator writer says, "The young readers of every generation have had an instinctive feeling that the row of standard authors in the library were somehow 'papa's books;' that they concerned other ideas, other feelings, another life than their own." This is close to what Bagehot had remarked in "The Waverley Novels," National Review , VI (April, 1858), 444: "Even standard authors exercise but slender influence on the susceptible minds of a rising generation; they are become 'papa's books;' the walls of the library are adorned with their regular volumes; but no hand touches them." And near the end of the subleader the Spectator author writes: "Talleyrand used to say that there was some one cleverer than Napoleon, cleverer than Voltaire — c'est tout le monde ." In his essay on Sir George Cornewall Lewis ( National Review , XVII [October, 1863], 517), Bagehot wrote: "'There is some one,' said a great man of the world, 'wiser than Voltaire, and wiser than Napoleon, c'est tout le monde .'" I have deliberately presented the evidence for attribution in full, because it is only when the evidence is heavily marshalled that the skeptic may be kept at bay. Moreover, the appearance of parallels in article after article not only highlights Bagehot's favourite anecdotes, insights, and beliefs, but also reveals Bagehot the literary artist winnowing permanent grain from journalistic chaff. And it further reminds us of one of the main strategies that Bagehot the publicist employed to persuade the readers of his age: repetition. This iteration makes more clear than ever before that Bagehot's dominant concern in the 1850's was Britain's urgent need for great statesmen, a concern which underlies not only these leading articles in the Inquirer , but also the letters on the universities, the review of Empedocles on Etna , and even, though distantly, the Spectator subleader on "The Trash of the Day."</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Uncancelled Leaf of Shepherd's Memoirs of Carlyle by Rodger L. Tarr</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Long acknowledged as a rich source for bibliographical material on Carlyle, Richard Herne Shepherd's Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Thomas Carlyle (2 vols., London: W. H. Allen, 1881) exists in a hitherto unknown uncancelled state which bears interest to the scholar and collector alike. Housed in the Carlyle Library at Chelsea is Shepherd's personal copy of the first issue of the Memoirs , in which he calls specific attention to uncancelled copies that differ both bibliographically and textually from the second issue. On the front paste-down endpaper of Volume Two the following is written in Shepherd's hand: The leaf (pp. 317-318) was cancelled by the publishers [W. H. Allen] in deference to Messrs. Macniven and Wallace, a firm of publishers in Edinburgh, who objected to certain expressions contained in it. The leaf was reprinted with certain omissions &amp; substitutions and only occurs in its present state in the earliest copies of the book, of which this is one. RHS Sept. 25 1887 The cancellation referred to by Shepherd concerns Henry J. Nicoll's Thomas Carlyle (Edinburgh: Macniven and Wallace, 1881), one of the numerous biographies written immediately after Carlyle's death. The subsequently cancelled leaf appears on pages 317-318 of Volume Two of the first issue under "Posthumous Memoirs," and reads: 2. THOMAS CARLYLE . By Henry J. Nicoll, Edinburgh: 1881, pp. 248. Revised Edition with Additional Chapter, pp. 255. 1 An utterly worthless compilation (full of misprints, sometimes as many as six on a single Page), of which data and the very wording are mainly taken without acknowledgment from a brief Memoir prefixed by the present writer twelve years ago to an edition of Carlyle's Edinburgh Inaugural Address. 2 This volume, like a previous one by a Mr. Wace on Tennyson, is issued by certain worthy successors of Edmund Curll, 3 and fit sponsors for such a double-distilled dunce and dullard as the author of it, who seem, like one of their confraternity in London [ end p. 317, begin p. 318] whom Carlyle once described in one of his letters to the Carlyle to present writer, "to depend considerably on thieving, and to be R. H. S. ready to steal wherever there is no gallows to prevent." 4 The evaluative, if not personal, ire of Shepherd here toward Macniven and Wallace and Henry J. Nicoll is not ill-founded, especially in the face of Nicoll's claim in his Preface, "All available sources of information have been searched, and every care taken to secure accuracy." Nevertheless, under obvious pressure from his publisher, W. H. Allen, Shepherd rewrote the leaf to read in the second issue: 2. THOMAS CARLYLE . By Henry J. Nicoll. Edinburgh: Macniven and Wallace, Princes Street, 1881, pp. 248. Revised Edition, with Additional Chapter, pp. 255. For a list of the chief errata in these two hastily-compiled volumes, the reader is referred to The Bibliography of Carlyle . 5 The tone, then, of the description in the cancelled copy is demonstrably altered, yet there remains a curious irony. In both the first and second issues, the Index reference is unchanged and reads, "Nicoll, Henry J., his worthless Memoir of Carlyle, ii 317; how compiled, 317-318." Aside from its bibliographical importance, perhaps the most noteworthy aspects of the uncancelled copy are that it contains a portion of a Carlyle letter deleted in the cancelled copy, and that the reasons for the cancellation itself help document a growing split between those who sought to record accurately both Carlyle and his works and those who sought incidental profit from his name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The revised edition also published in 1881 contains an additional chapter entitled "Ana" that is anecdotal in nature. 2 The unsigned Memoir, together with a Preface by J. C.

      <field name="heading_text">Brissot De Warville and the Franco-American Press by Madeleine B. Stern</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On May 22, 1788, the Independent Chronicle (Boston) carried the following "Proposals for printing by Subscription, A System Of French and American Trade, under the title of ' On France and the United States.'—By Stephen Claviere, and J. P. Brissot De Warville. Translated from French by Joseph De Nancrede." A book thus entitled and in the form described in those Proposals was never published. Yet because of the relationship between translator and author and the effect of that relationship upon the Franco-American press in this country, the project merits recording. Although its immediate purpose failed, its ultimate purpose— to elucidate French thought for American readers—succeeded. Moreover, since an attempt was made to involve Isaiah Thomas in publication of the work, the scheme deserves a place in American printing history. This work shall be printed on fine paper, with good types, will contain upwards of 200 pages, 8vo. to be delivered to Subscribers in boards, at Three S [ h ] illings and Six Pence each, and will be committed to the press as soon as 300 copies are subscribed for. The money to be paid when the work is delivered. One of the most unquestionable proofs of the merit of this work, as a complete system of French and American trade, is certainly the Arret of the King's Council of State, lately published in this town; which may be considered principally as the adoption of the plans proposed in it. 1 Indeed nothing less could be expected from the sound principles it contains of commerce at large, the judicious remarks on the natural relations between France and America, and their tendency to strengthen the bands of amity, at a period when the French government is conducted by a wise, magnanimous and generous Prince, whose pursuits are to break the shackles of prejudice, and abolish the tyranny of superstition, to improve useful knowledge, and to promote the happiness of mankind; and above all his love to America.—This is not the only recommendation of this work; several gentlemen in this town, after a perusal of the original, have expressed the strongest marks of their approbation; nor have the English (who should always be believed when they bestow praises on the French, and their productions) hesitated to pronounce it a very useful and judicious work. The announced translator of this "System of French and American Trade," Joseph de Nancrede, had recently been appointed French instructor at Harvard College. Born in France in 1761, he had also recently changed his name, Paul Joseph Guérard, to Joseph Nancrede or de Nancrede. As Private Guérard he had served in the Army of Rochambeau and apparently developed an abiding taste for the United States of America. As French Instructor Nancrede he would, during the decade that followed, serve as official translator for the French community in Boston, edit and publish one of the earliest French newspapers in this country, and compile an important French anthology. He would also set up as bookseller-publisher in Boston and generally promote American understanding of French literature and thought, government and economics during a critical period in both countries. It was with such a purpose in mind that Nancrede translated and attempted to have published a "System of French and American Trade" by Etienne Clavière and Clavière's more distinguished collaborator, Brissot de Warville. The work reflected its author. Jacques Pierre Brissot de Warville, who was to become the leader of the Girondist Party during the French Revolution, was a strong advocate of Franco-American accord and to this end he founded the Société des Amis des Noirs as well as the Société Gallo-Américaine. In 1787, partially to this same end of Franco-American friendship, he published the original French version of De la France et des Etats-Unis; ou l'Importance de la Révolution de l'Amérique pour le Bonheur de la France . Written in collaboration with the refugee Swiss banker Etienne Clavière, the book dilated upon the commercial advantages opened to France by the American Revolution. Anti-mercantilist and pro-Adam Smith in its economic philosophy, it stressed the commercial interdependence of a France that was on the verge of revolution and an America that was emerging from one. In addition to promoting strong economic relations between the two countries, De le France et des Etats-Unis encouraged French emulation of American liberty and promised prosperity. 2 This was the author whom young Joseph Nancrede followed in discipleship and this was the book the recently appointed French instructor at Harvard promptly translated into English as On France and the United States . Although his translation never appeared between boards, extracts from it were printed in the newspapers—those "channels through which information is circulated in America." 3 In its April 2, 1788, issue the Massachusetts Centinel had announced: "The observations contained in the following extract from a work on the French and American Trade , written by Mr. Warville Claviere [sic], appear highly important to our country, at the present day—we have, therefore, obtained them for the gratification of our readers, from a gentleman who is now translating into English that interesting and useful work." The section "On Means of Exchange and Balance" followed. At least one further extract appeared in a subsequent issue of the Massachusetts Centinel and another in the Independent Chronicle . 4 The Independent Chronicle carried Nancrede's Proposals for printing the work in its May 22, 1788, issue and repeated them in the June 19 issue. In July the Massachusetts Centinel announced the arrival of the author of the work, Monsieur J. P. Brissot de Warville, who had come passenger aboard the Cato : "Mr. De Warville . . . is the author of the celebrated treatise on French and American trade—extracts from which we have frequently published in our paper [sic].—If the soundest principles of politicks, and the interests of nations— . . . a love of liberty, and a brilliant genius—added to unremitting endeavours, in defending and promoting their interests, in his spirited writings, can endear him to the citizens of the United States, he is already naturalized in the hearts of every American." 5 Brissot promptly paid appropriate thanks to the editor of the Centinel for "the praises you have so liberally bestowed on my writings. . . . My endeavours for defending the cause of universal liberty, and for promoting the interests of free Americans, will exceed my most sanguine hopes if they be any recommendation to me from them, and secure me their esteem." 6 While Brissot was quick to thank his collaborator Clavière for his part in the undertaking, he made no mention of Nancrede. Moreover, in referring to the publication the title he used was not Nancrede's literal translation, On France and the United States , but Considerations on the Relations between the United States and France . By the time of Brissot's arrival aboard the Cato , the translator Joseph Nancrede had collected some 150 advance subscriptions for the book and had interested not only the French-speaking population of Boston in the enterprise but several local dignitaries, including Governor Hancock and his immediate predecessor James Bowdoin. Nonetheless, 150 subscriptions were inadequate to meet the projected expenses of publishing and Nancrede in order to lower costs contemplated making several deletions in the text. To this the author objected; moreover, Brissot threatened to make the publication still more costly by furnishing the translator with additional sections to be incorporated in the work. It may have been at this stage of the project or somewhat later that Brissot de Warville paid a visit to Worcester, subsequently recording his reaction to the town and its distinguished citizen Isaiah Thomas: "This town is elegant and well-peopled; the printer, Isaiah Thomas, has rendered it famous throughout the Continent of America. He has printed a large part of the works which appear; and it is acknowledged that his editions are correct and well edited. Thomas is the Didot of the United States." 7 On August 5, 1788, Joseph Nancrede, disappointed in his plans for publishing Brissot's work by subscription, but still enthusiastic about the merits and importance of the book, enlisted the aid of the Didot of America. His letter to Isaiah Thomas reflects both his opinion of the text and his technique of persuasion: Sir The distance, my Business and my health not allowing me to wait on you personally, I have at last determined to write to you. I have lately translated into english a treatise on french and American Trade by the celebrated Mr De Warville ; a work which gained its author great credit in Europe for the sound principles and new and judicious remarks it contains. You have no doubt seen the proposals I have lately issued for printing it by subscription but although I have met with great encouragement I am obliged to relinquish that method. The work as it was proposed to be printed was to contain 200 pages or upwards; I had thus calculated it from suppressions I intended to make in order to render it cheaper; but the author himself who is lately come to America does not admit such suppressions,—so far from it that he has furnished me with numerous additions, and corrections so that the work will contain at least 330 pages 8°. My subscribers whose Number amounts to up ds of 150 can but partly be depended upon as the price will be altered so that other means must be used.—every Gentleman in town who has read the original in french is ready to give it the greatest encouragement and some of them will go very far.—of all the publications in which the Americans are concerned, none can arrest their attention so immediately as a system on trade; and if any publication can receive encouragement it must certainly be this; for among that class of men who can afford to buy books there are certainly more Merchants than any other. Besides every American whether Merchant farmer, or Navigator is too immediately interested in commerce not to read with avidity so useful a performance the judgment some of the first characters have given of it is "that they hoped the Book would soon be in the hands of every American who can read." Nor will it stop there, it will be read as long as the causes which have given it birth shall exist. I hope to find M r Thomas's opinion agree with mine in this respect when he has read the work— From these considerations together with—your patriotism and circumstances those gentlemen who have the encouragement of the work at heart among whom may be reckoned Mr Baudouin [Bowdoin] the pres. Gov. the comptroller general and many others equally learned and well-wishers to their country seem to be of opinion that you should undertake to print it and agree with me for the manuscript. There is a prospect of a large profit in printing 1000 copies. Baltimore Virginia and Charlestown seem to offer a large sale for it from reasons which I will communicate when I have the pleasure to see you. I wish to know what would be your lowest terms (in case we should not agree this way) for printing a 1000 copies upon good paper with good types equal to those with which M r Minot's work is printed, 8 and the notes are of a smaller type in a large 8° and—likewise what would be the lowest price for half that number, that is 500 the work is ready for the press you may begin it when you please I am sir with due esteem your most humble &amp; most ob De Nancrede . 9 Isaiah Thomas's most humble and most obedient De Nancrede may have been unaware at this time of a stumbling block that would stand in the way of American publication of his translation. Brissot de Warville was surely aware of it and there seems little doubt that Isaiah Thomas was made aware of it, for he presumably declined printing On France and the United States . The stumbling block took the shape of a book with the lengthy title: Considerations on The Relative Situation of France, and the United States of America: Shewing The Importance of the American Revolution to the Welfare of France: Giving also An Account of their Productions, and the reciprocal Advantages which may be drawn from their Commercial Connexions: and finally, Pointing Out The Actual Situation of the United States . Like Nancrede's On France and the United States , the volume had been "Translated from the French of Etienne Claviere, and J. P. Brissot de Warville." Unlike Nancrede's On France and the United States , it had already been published in book form. It bore the London imprint: "Printed at the Logographic Press, and sold by Robson and Clarke, New Bond Street; T. Longman, Pater-noster-row; and W. Richardson, Royal-Exchange. 1788." The Logographic Office had been opened in Blackfriars, London, in 1784 by John Walter, who was to found The Times , and his partner Henry Johnson who had patented a "new method of printing by means of 'logotypes' or founts composed of complete words instead of separate letters." Some forty books were printed by that process including an English translation of Necker's Finances of France and an English translation of Brissot de Warville's treatise on trade. 10 Brissot, who had visited London, may have arranged for that translation himself. His use of the title Considerations on the Relations between the United States and France in his thank-you note to the editor of the Massachusetts Centinel certainly indicates a knowledge of the London publication. 11 At the same time, he must have encouraged Nancrede to translate what he hoped would become the first American edition of his work on Franco-American trade. The point of view of the author and of the translator Nancrede—whenever the latter became aware of the earlier translation— would naturally differ from the point of view of Isaiah Thomas as printer-publisher. Brissot and Nancrede, believing in the wide appeal of the work, would see in British and American publications of the same year a means of expanding readership and enlarging influence. Isaiah Thomas on the other hand might well feel that a London imprint would detract from the sale of an American publication coming so close upon its heels and that one English translation of De la France et des Etats-Unis was quite sufficient to satisfy current demand. A tantalizing phrase in the extract of a letter written by Brissot just a few days after Nancrede's letter to Isaiah Thomas arouses speculation. Addressing his collaborator Clavière on August 9 and 10, 1788, Brissot mentions the charms of Boston and Cambridge and then writes: "Détails sur la traduction de notre ouvrage." The "Détails" unfortunately are not specified in the extract of the letter extant in the Bibliothèque Nationale. 12 Perhaps they would have identified the anonymous London translator, dilated upon Nancrede's predicament, and explained the reaction of authors, translators and publishers. At all events, instead of enjoying American publication of the work, Brissot de Warville in September 1788 presented (through the kindness of Nancrede's supporter James Bowdoin) a copy of his economic study on Franco-American relations, along with "a number of valuable books in the French Language," 13 to the library of Harvard University. There is little doubt that Harvard's disappointed French instructor, using those books in his classes, appreciated the irony that, after all his effort, his own translation of De la France et des Etats-Unis would never achieve publication in book form. Despite his disappointment, Nancrede remained a "brissotin" and Brissot's influence persisted long after his departure from this country. The Société Gallo-Américaine, founded by Brissot in Paris in 1787, had an unofficial Boston branch of which Nancrede was a member and a motto which Nancrede was shortly to exploit. The motto, "L'Utilité des Deux Mondes," was to be emblazoned upon one of the earliest French newspapers in the United States where Brissot's concepts of trade and Franco-American relations were to find a sounding board. The Courier de Boston —a title modeled perhaps on Brissot's Courier de Londres —was announced in the Massachusetts Centinel of February 11, 1789, as the direct outcome of the Gallo-American Society, "the objects of which are to promote the advantages of the two countries." 14 Nancrede had been "invited . . . to undertake this paper" by "some of its members" who had assured him "that every information, which may have for its object the advantages of the two countries—the friendship of its inhabitants—and the improvement of every thing that is useful, and which may tend to remove old prejudices, shall be afforded him." The influence of Brissot de Warville and the tenets of his De la France et des Etats-Unis , implicit in this introductory notice, continued to be felt in the news-sheet itself, which was issued weekly between April 13 and October 15, 1789. The eight-page paper, printed by Samuel Hall, carried news from France including Brissot's Discourse of April 21, 1789, the opening of the States-General, and the fall of the Bastille; American news including the election of Washington and Adams and the sessions and debates of Congress. By and large it emphasized questions of economics and aimed at a readership of merchants, providing not only a Price Current but essays on commerce, free trade and speculation, along with advice to emigrants to America possibly written by Brissot himself. 15 There was little doubt that Nancrede was spreading brissotin influence in America and although his Courier de Boston lasted only six months, the editor continued his efforts to promote Franco-American relations. In 1790 Brissot wrote to Nancrede from Paris informing him that he was sending him for distribution issues of his own newspaper, the Patriote François , as well as a package of brochures. 16 "You can profit from this journal," he wrote subsequently, "to instruct the Americans in our revolution." 17 Through every available means Nancrede did attempt to clarify for American readers the purposes of the French Revolution and the philosophy of Brissot de Warville and through that clarification to promote friendship and trade between the two countries. In 1791 he translated into English the Discourse upon the Question, Whether the King shall be tried? , which Brissot de Warville had delivered before the Society of the Friends of the Constitution in Paris on July 10 of that year. This time his translation was published by Belknap and Young of Boston and the name of "P. J. G. de Nancrede, Preceptor of the French Language, in the University of Cambridge" appeared as translator on the title-page of what was called "The First American Edition." In a two-page Advertisement Nancrede explained his purposes in translating a Discourse that would never cease to remind the world that " The American Revolution brought forth the French Revolution ." 18 Although its style was circumlocutory and its attitude obsequious, this translator's Advertisement is indicative of Nancrede's devotion to Brissot and his principles: I am sensible I owe an apology, for offering the following Translation to the Public; yet presumptuous as it may appear, I am far from being without specious reasons to justify this presumption. Ever unable to suppress those National feelings, excited by the reading of the energetic and masterly pieces which our Revolution has produced, though a citizen of this country and happy under its government, I still remember that I am a Frenchman, and indulge those enthusiastic feelings, always consequent upon the perusal of a spirited and beautiful piece of composition, especially when it comes from that quarter. To communicate these feelings to the Public was my intention in the undertaking of the present translation; and, if in the performing of it, I fall short of the original, and am left with little more, to present to the public, than the INTENTION, I still hope they will have the indulgence to receive it, and in THAT resolve its imperfections. The subject upon which the following Discourse was delivered, is one of the newest and most interesting in the world. It is of the utmost importance to the French Nation: It cannot be indifferent to the Americans. The part the Author has acted, and his opinion on the subject, declared in so formal a manner, must render it so much the more interesting to this people, so conversant with the Liberties and Rights of Mankind, as the example of their courage and political knowledge has been the great focus, where France has acquired her light, and of course the means of recovering her liberties. AMERICA cannot but see with pleasure a diffusion of sentiments, which their author imbibed during his residence here. The gentleman's character also, his present situation and influence in politics . . . may be considered as favourable to the reception of the following sheets. Brissot's own reception of the translation was favorable; he wrote to Nancrede from Paris in 1792: "I owe you thanks for the pains you have taken with this translation, for the interest you take in the author and his works." 19 That interest continued. The new French ambassador to the United States—Citizen Genêt—was sent at Brissot's instigation, and through him Brissot dispatched his letter to Nancrede "so that the correspondence between the two nations will be established more regularly." 20 Nancrede served Genêt in the capacity of unofficial reporter of Boston events and consular differences, and when opportunity for a prize agency arose, Brissot recommended his disciple for the post. 21 By 1792 Harvard's French instructor, recognizing the dire need for French texts in his classes, compiled an anthology also published by Belknap and Young, L'Abeille Françoise, ou Nouveau Recueil, De Morceaux Brillans, Des Auteurs François Les Plus Celebres . Ouvrage Utile à ceux qui étudient la langue Françoise, et amusant pour ceux qui la Connoissent . The title-page itself reflected Brissot's continuing influence upon Nancrede and their belief in improved French-American relations, for it contained a quotation from Brissot's Voyages : "L'Amérique doit être l'asyle de tous les hommes: les Américains doivent être en rapport avec tous les habitants de la terre; ils doivent chercher à se faire entendre de tous, et sur-tout de ceux avec les quels ils ont plus de communication, tels que les François." Among the gems of thought by Rousseau and Alembert, Fénelon and Fontenelle, Helvetius, Montesquieu and Voltaire were several passages by Brissot de Warville including a fragment of his "Discours Sur la Question. Si Le Roi Peut Etre Jugé" and his "Projet d'une Langue Américaine." The illustrious subscribers to Nancrede's important French compilation included two of the dignitaries who had supported him in his original attempt to publish a translation of Brissot's De la France et des Etats-Unis , James Bowdoin and His Excellency John Hancock. In addition, the printer who had declined to undertake that work now supported this, for the name of Isaiah Thomas, Esq., appears in the "Liste des Souscripteurs." A poignant phrase in a letter from Nancrede to Citizen Genêt foreshadowed the fate of the French Girondist who had so deeply influenced Nancrede. "Si vous saviez quelque chose sur le sort de Brissot, et que vous voulussiez m'en faire part, je vous en aurois beaucoup d'obligation." That letter was written on September 20, 1793. 22 On October 30, the former leader of the Girondist Party was condemned to death and the next day, at the age of 39, he was guillotined. Not quite 50 years later, when Nancrede died, among his papers would be found a copy of Brissot de Warville's philosophic reflections on suffering and imprisonment. 23 Brissot had been killed—but not his good book. De la France et des Etats-Unis had been published in English translation in London in 1788; during the same year portions of Nancrede's English translation had appeared in Boston's newspaper press. Six years later a third English translation was published in London and republished in New York in 1795. Despite a strain in French-American relations, there was still sufficient interest in trade between the two countries to spur a demand for Brissot's book. This time the translator was distinguished as the author of The Vision of Columbus , Advice to the Privileged Orders and The Conspiracy of Kings . He was none other than Joel Barlow, the Hartford wit who resided abroad, the poet-statesman and liberal thinker who, like the lesser known Joseph Nancrede, had felt the influence of Brissot de Warville. Joel Barlow entitled his translation of De la France et des Etats-Unis: The Commerce of America with Europe; particularly with France and Great-Britain; Comparatively Stated and Explained . Shewing the Importance of the American Revolution to the Interests of France, and Pointing out the Actual Situation of the United States of North-America, in regard to Trade, Manufactures and Population . Unlike the two prior translations of 1788, this translation was from "the last French Edition," that is, the Paris 1791 edition which had been revised by Brissot. Barlow added a biographical sketch of the author and an Appendix. His version was published first in London by J. S. Jordan in 1794 as Volume II of Brissot's New Travels in the United States of America , which Barlow had also translated. The following year the "first American Edition" of The Commerce of America appeared, adorned with an engraved frontispiece portrait of Brissot, printed and sold by T. and J. Swords of 99 Pearl Street, New York. 24 There is little or no likelihood that Barlow knew of Nancrede's earlier attempt to publish a translation of De la France et des Etats-Unis . Yet the interests of the two translators—and their paths—were to cross again at another critical period of American history. Joel Barlow was to be appointed by Madison minister to France in 1811, principally to intercede with Napoleon Bonaparte for improved commercial relations with the United States. At that time Joseph Nancrede would serve as one of the unofficial "confidential advisers of our minister." 25 Joel Barlow, the American, had been made an honorary citizen of France during the Revolution. In 1799 Joseph Nancrede, the Frenchman, became a naturalized American citizen. 26 Yet throughout their lives both men were citizens of two worlds. By the time Barlow's translation of Brissot had been published in New York in 1795, Joseph Nancrede, with a partner, Thomas Hall, had set up as bookseller-publisher on Boston's State Street. In this phase of his life he would be motivated by the same purpose that had governed his teaching and his translations—to publicize the utility of two worlds by introducing to American readers the best that had been thought and said in France. It was only natural therefore that, despite the failure of his own translation of Brissot, Nancrede should advertise Barlow's published translation. In 1796, on his own as bookseller-publisher, Marlborough Street, Boston, Joseph Nancrede issued his first Catalogue of Books in the Various Branches of Literature; lately imported from London, Dublin, Paris, and other Capitals of Europe . Among the books listed are three works by Brissot de Warville including "Brissot on the commerce of the United States." In Nancrede's advertisements the title of the Barlow translation varies, from "Brissot on the Relative Situation of the Commerce of America with European Nations, and particularly with France" to "Brissot on the relative commerce of France and America" or "Warville on the commerce of the United States." Yet the title appears with striking regularity in Nancrede's lists between 1796 and 1803 when he was preparing to sell out prior to a departure abroad. In the Nancrede book catalogues that duodecimo by Brissot de Warville, priced at 87 cents, is a constant reminder of Nancrede's abiding interest in the author and his work. 27 Nancrede was naturally not the only bookseller who advertised the Barlow translation of Brissot. In October 1796 the firm of Isaiah Thomas issued a Catalogue of Books to be Sold by Thomas, Son &amp; Thomas, at their Bookstore, in Worcester, Massachusetts . Along with works by Voltaire and Necker the list carried the title, "Brissott on Commerce." 28 To Joseph Nancrede, who eight years before had unsuccessfully attempted to enlist Isaiah Thomas's help in publishing his own translation of Brissot de Warville, this must surely have seemed the ultimate irony. Yet a citizen of two worlds would welcome any effort to encourage accord between those worlds —no matter who had translated Brissot de Warville.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">John Miller: First Transatlantic Publisher's Agent by James J. Barnes</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the beginning of the nineteenth century the publisher's agent was a well-established personality in the British book trade. As distinct from an author's agent, nowadays often referred to as a literary agent, a publisher's agent at this time acted primarily in negotiations between publishing houses, marketing and distributing books with a view to sharing expenses. Later in the century agents began to be used for transatlantic negotiations, and by all accounts John Miller was the first to make a specialty of American books. 1 He began as a bookseller in London about 1804, but did not concern himself with American publications until 1817 when he learned that a Philadelphia bookseller, Mathew Carey, was prepared to spend $250 a year to get the latest British publications as quickly as possible. 2 Carey came to Miller's attention by way of Carey's son-in-law Charles Robert Leslie, who was a friend of Washington Irving, whose Sketchbook Miller began to publish. 3 However, after the first volume appeared in early 1820 Miller found himself financially unable to continue the series. Fortunately Irving prevailed upon John Murray to bring out the remaining portions of the work, and we must surmise that Miller was forced to spend much of 1820 re-establishing himself, his reputation, and his credit. The panic of 1819 caught many worthy men unawares but Miller had sixteen years of solid trade experience behind him, and by November 1820 had recuperated enough to venture an offer of transatlantic service to Mathew Carey and Son. 4 The precise terms of their agreement are not known, but it is possible to reconstruct the essential features from their correspondence. 5 Miller's main task was to procure early copies of forthcoming English books, the earlier the better, and send them in duplicate to Philadelphia. The sooner Carey received such works, the quicker he could get the jump on his Amercan competitors in the feverish business of British reprints. Duplicate copies were sent by different vessels to minimize delays and losses. From Miller's letters to Carey it appears that the typical elapsed time between London and Philadelphia was six to eight weeks, but it is clear that a host of uncertainties and misfortunes constantly plagued transatlantic business arrangements. The Careys lodged periodic complaints about the slowness of service, the mishaps which befell long-awaited best sellers, and the quirks of fate which provided competitors with copies ahead of themselves. 6 Miller's long experience in the trade gave him access to many publishing outlets. Not infrequently he could inform Carey that he had been lucky enough to obtain a particular book a few days or even a week in advance of publication. And when a publisher proved unwilling to part with an early copy, Miller was not above inducing his personal friends to part with their complimentary or review copies. He treated the Careys as if they were members of the London book trade, and therefore considered them eligible for trade terms which included wholesale prices for duplicate copies, a reduction of twenty to thirty-three percent from the retail price. Because Miller was under instructions to send copies of many of the popular works of the day, fiction and non-fiction alike, Carey's costs were greater than anticipated in spite of Miller's economies. The wholesale price of each work ranged from 13s to 24s, with packing and postage extra; so instead of the earlier estimate of $250 per year, annual expenditures amounted to well over $500. This being the case, the Careys themselves lost no opportunity to economize, and once they decided whether or not to reprint an English work, they immediately sold the duplicate or unwanted copies through the normal American bookselling channels. 7 It was not long before Miller was being asked to broaden his activities. By the spring of 1821 he said he would take a dozen copies of Carey's Journal of Medical and Physical Science for sale in London. He also agreed to handle a few of Carey's law publications, though he doubted that these would find much of a market in Britain. Most noteworthy, however, was a further proposal from Philadelphia that Miller accept the formidable task of coordinating all of Carey's new and second-hand importations from London. At this time American booksellers and publishers still imported most of the British books they sold, hazarding to reprint only the most popular. Miller was quite willing to act as Carey's agent in this way provided that the number of importations was large enough to make it worth his while. Accordingly, he decided to charge five percent on the gross value of the shipments, including packing and dock charges. On the other hand he anticipated saving Carey money, since, as a member of the London book trade, he could take advantage of special trade discounts above and beyond the usual wholesale prices. He could also secure additional discounts by paying ready cash, purchasing books at publishers' trade sale dinners or upon the day of publication, ordering in large quantities, and buying at auctions and remainder sales. If all went smoothly, Carey stood to gain both as a bookseller and as a publisher. However, Miller set one pre-condition for doing the job: in order to take advantage of such trade terms he had to be supplied in advance with adequate funds. He made this point clear from the outset in view of his embarrassed financial circumstances following the panic of 1819. Complying with this requirement, Carey supplied Miller with an initial £20, but within six months this was totally exhausted and another one hundred pounds or five hundred dollars was needed to continue the assignment. Thus began what became a recurring refrain from Miller, constantly lamenting Carey's inability or unwillingness to send him adequate funds. In November 1822 Carey was still about £100 in arrears. In casting about for whom or what to blame this on, Miller attributed part of the trouble to the way in which Carey transferred funds from Philadelphia to London: via someone in, of all places, Gibraltar. No wonder reimbursement was delayed! Carey's banking practices were not quite so absurd as they seemed. Every American businessman who owed money to an Englishman was plagued by the problem of transferring funds. Throughout these years American currency was considered "soft." Its value on the international market fluctuated wildly. In good times the rate of exchange penalized Americans eight to ten percent, and in bad times the penalty was much greater. American banks often refused to handle any transfer of funds, in all likelihood because they were unable to sell dollars for pounds. This being so, Americans who owed money in England tried to work out a fair exchange of goods in kind, insofar as possible, trading specific articles instead of dealing in money at all. John Miller was himself a party to such an arrangement involving Jared Sparks, the American historian, and the Boston bookseller and publisher Hillard, Gray &amp; Co. Both Sparks and Hilliard, Gray imported British books from Miller; the former for personal and professional needs, and the latter for business purposes. At the time Sparks also happened to be the editor of the North American Review , which was published by Hilliard, Gray &amp; Co. Thus, in order to cut down on transatlantic cash payments and to balance debts, Miller would purchase a certain number of issues of the Review to sell in London. Since Miller imported a number of other American publications as well, an elaborate and confusing accounting took place every six months whereby both parties calculated the value of direct exchanges before reckoning their respective bills. 8 Two types of expenditures weighed particularly heavily on the Careys. One was the purchase and importation of original engravings from London, and the other, payments to British authors and publishers for advance copies of their works. Engravings were always a problem because reprint houses like Carey liked to think that they offered their American customers everything that the original British volumes contained, only in a much cheaper and more convenient form. However, since British works were often enhanced by elaborate illustrations or maps, reprinters either had to try to imitate the illustrations at considerable expense and perhaps with inferior workmanship, or secure casts of the original woodcuts. Either course made sense only for expensive works such as gift books, atlases, and medical works. A case in point arose in September 1821 when Miller tried to induce Carey to import the plates of a new illustrated edition of Shakespeare. Miller's proposition was that Carey buy a set of plates and use them together with a reprinted text. Since the work was going to appear in parts in England, Carey would have ample time to re-set type in America, and with outright ownership of the plates also, he would be assured a monopoly. As far as one can tell, Carey declined Miller's suggestion. However, by the 1830's the practice of importing plates had become much more common. In 1834 the tables were turned when Carey &amp; Lea wanted a set of the plates for Roget's book on physiology published by William Pickering. They instructed Miller to offer Pickering £70 or £80 for them, about four times the manufacturing cost. Yet they doubted whether Pickering would see the advantage of cooperating with an American firm. 9 We have never yet known a London publisher that knew his own interest in that respect, imagining always that what was done there [in England] must be so much superior to what could be done elsewhere. . . . Carey &amp; Lea could have had the illustrations engraved satisfactorily in America, and they were also somewhat wary of dealing with London due to a recent instance of poor craftsmanship for which $500 worth of corrective work had to be done in Philadelphia. 10 Still, if due safeguards were imposed, Carey &amp; Lea saw mutual advantage in negotiating the sale in spite of having to pay £100 for the plates, instead of £70 or £80, plus a 33 percent import duty on the cast. 11 At first one hundred pounds seemed a sizeable amount to risk in such a venture, but not long afterward they found themselves authorizing Miller to offer Longman as much as £600 for the cuts of their Encyclopaedia of Geography . 12 Miller deserves credit for being one of the first to develop the practice of paying British authors and publishers for advance sheets of forthcoming works. As early as 1822 he helped Carey negotiate with Constable in Edinburgh and Cadell &amp; Davis in London for Scott's Peverell of the Peake . 13 Twenty-five pounds per volume was the going rate, and since Scott's novels usually appeared in three or four volumes, Carey spent £75 or £100 for each new work. Paying this amount insured Carey a few days' head start in printing and distributing the latest Scott novel in the American market. Carey's competitors tried to foil his system, but thanks to Miller, Carey enjoyed more than his share of successful publication debuts. The largest payment he ever made for advance sheets was £295 during the 1820's in anticipation of Sir Walter Scott's Life of Napoleon . Not until the early 1850's did American publishers again offer this much money for advance sheets, and then it presaged a new generation of publishers and authors like Harper &amp; Bros. and Bulwer and Dickens. Expenditures for early copies during the 1830's typically came to less than £50. In 1835 Carey felt that Miller had paid too much when he offered Capt. Chamier £15 for a forthcoming work. Miller was authorized to pay R. R. Madden only £10 for early sheets of his book on travels to the West Indies. Rarely did Carey go as high as £45 for a new novel by Lady Morgan. 14 Miller's commission on such sales was usually 25 percent of the sale price. This he deducted from the amount forwarded to the British author or publisher. Occasionally he had to content himself with a mere 10 percent when Carey &amp; Lea failed to make it clear to the author that Miller was entitled to one-fourth of the £15 purchase price. 15 Unfortunately, his career provided little more than a hand-to-mouth existence interspersed with occasional periods of comparative comfort. At about the time he began to recover from the effects of 1819-20 he found himself in the vortex of 1825-26. In the spring of 1826 he reported to Carey &amp; Lea: "'Our trade is getting worse and worse—all confidence is destroyed—.'" 16 It was probably the 1825-26 depression that forced Miller to sell his shop and again relocate his business. Sharing his embarrassment with Jared Sparks, he wrote: 17 I am distressed beyond measure to be obliged to return the Bill you drew upon me for the North American Review. It never entered into my mind that such an event could happen, but unfortunately the scoundrel who took my premises has just suffered his Bill to be dishonoured and has involved me in all sorts of perplexities. In any dilemma before, my Bankers have invariably assisted me—but just now— when I most want their aid, they have declined giving it. What to do at this moment I know not. . . . From any actual loss you are perfectly safe—as I have ample means—only that they are not available at the moment of need. . . . The turn of the year will enable me to realize property and get out of the difficulty. Carey &amp; Lea themselves suffered setbacks in 1834-35 and again in 1837-41. For example, a word of caution went out to Miller in early 1835 as to the choice of new books he should send for reprinting. 18 We are entirely aware of the difficulty you must be in always to decide to your own satisfaction and our own advantage—but as a general rule very few of the books of the day will admit of anything beyond the mere cost of the work. . . . Unless the book be of some distinguished author that expense [of sending duplicate copies] might be spared. Six weeks later they noted: 19 We would here remark that as Messrs. Harpers appear to have withdrawn their extra exertions to obtain all new works, that hereafter you need not send all the novels of the day, but all those by popular authors; or when published under such circumstances as will lead you to suppose they may be important here. Novels must have more than an ordinary popularity to bear reprinting nowadays. Between ourselves, Carey &amp; Hart, and Harpers the country has been deluged with them. Miller misunderstood the reason for their advice and took offense at what he construed as criticism of his selections. Amplifying the reason for their instructions Carey &amp; Lea reiterated, 20 We are aware that Harpers are driving on again with vigor, but the state of business will not admit of republication of other works than those which are first rate and these will not admit of an extra cost unless under peculiar circumstances . . . . Despite the periodic trade crises on both sides of the Atlantic and the marked changes in the publishing business of Mathew Carey and his successors, Miller continued to act as their London agent until the end of his active business career. The Careys, for their part, continued to rely on him decade after decade. Together they established a pattern for others on both sides of the Atlantic. Unwittingly, perhaps, Miller found that his loyal services to the Philadelphia publishers often precluded doing business with other American firms. The more competitive ones wanted their own special agents in London, and so it happened that Harpers eventually employed Obadiah Rich and Sampson Low, and in the course of time Appleton took on Charles Layton, and Ticknor &amp; Fields used Delf and Trubner. More than anyone else Miller set the pattern for a number of other entrepreneurs in London and elsewhere. At one time or another he had been a publisher, an author's agent, a publisher's agent, a dealer in new and second-hand American books, an exporter of British books to America, and an acknowledged authority on the ways of the transatlantic book trade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX The Business Addresses of John Miller What follows is based on a variety of sources, including letters to and from Miller, advertisements in catalogues and trade periodicals, and a wide range of London street and trade directories. Occasionally complicating the task of reconstruction was the existence of more than one J. Miller among the ranks of the London book trade. Nor is it possible to be very precise as to when, within a given year, Miller moved from one premises to another. Fluctuations in the trade and in his personal fortune prompted many of the moves prior to 1830, when he became identified as the agent for American books on Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. According to a letter from Miller to Carey of 12 May 1821, Miller had already been in business for seventeen years. That would have placed the opening of his shop in London about the year 1804. However, we cannot locate a reasonably firm address for him until 1811, when he is listed at 6 Bridge Road, Lambeth. Between about 1813 and 1819 he was listed at 25 Bow Street, and for some portion of 1819-20 he could be found at 10-11 Burlington Arcade, Piccadilly. Briefly (1820-21) he operated from either 14 or 41 Lisle Street near Leicester Square, depending upon which street directory one consults. He then settled for a time (1821-23) at 69 Fleet Street. During the years 1824-27 he occupied premises at 5 New Bridge Street, Black-friars. It was during these years that street directories began to list him as a specialist in American publications. Then follows a series of other changes, no doubt reflecting the commercial instability of the late 1820's. He was definitely at 40 Pall Mall by April 1827 according to one letterhead, and at 23 St. James Street in April 1830 according to one of his printed catalogues. But it was not until sometime in 1831-32 that he finally settled at 13 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, remaining at essentially the same location until the conclusion of his business career in 1866. The only change from about 1840 onwards was a move from 13 to 26 Henrietta Street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I am greatly indebted to Ben Harris McClary for querying me about John Miller when he was preparing his book, Washington Irving and the House of Murray (1969). At that time I was unable to provide much background on Miller, but since then I have gathered a good deal of material about him, and what follows is the result. I am grateful to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania and to Houghton Library of Harvard University for permission to examine and quote from unpublished correspondence in their possession. 2 See Appendix for a chronology of Miller's business addresses.

Carey and Lea of Philadelphia (1957), pp. 19-20. 3 Charles Robert Leslie was an American painter living in London at the time. 4 See letters of Miller to Carey, 7 Dec. and 14 Dec. 1820, Lea &amp; Febiger collection, Historical Society of Pennsylvania. For Irving's dealings with Miller, see S. T. Williams, Life of Washington Irving (1935). 5 An indication of Carey &amp; Lea's initial dependence upon Miller may be conjectured from Miller's letters during 1821 which refer to at least 55 specific works excluding periodicals which he was forwarding to Carey &amp; Lea for their consideration. As far as I can tell, 37 of these were eventually reprinted by the Philadelphia firm. In 1822 Miller dispatched about 50 books, of which at least 34 were subsequently reprinted by Carey &amp; Lea. 6 For the various efforts of Carey &amp; Lea to reprint British works, see especially Bradsher, Mathew Carey , pp. 35-36, 79-86, 129-130, and Kaser, Carey &amp; Lea , pp. 42-44, 54, 69, 95-110, 149. 7 For the details concerning Miller's activities as a publisher's agent, see the following letters at Hist.

Several decades later Carey &amp; Lea's successors, a firm called Lea &amp; Blanchard, employed Miller's services to negotiate similar purchases of plates or copies of books in sheets for exportation to America. By the early 1850's the nature of the firm's business had shifted substantially away from general literature and much more heavily into technical and medical works. 13 For efforts to secure advance copies of Scott's novels, see references to Bradsher &amp; Kaser at the beginning of this article. 14 Carey &amp; Lea to Miller, 5 Jan., 31 Jan., and 2 Feb. 1835, Hist.

      <field name="heading_text">Mrs. Stowe's Income from the Serial Version of Uncle Tom's Cabin by Susan Geary</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A discrepancy exists among the printed sources regarding the amount of money Mrs. Stowe was paid for the serial version of Uncle Tom's Cabin . While it is a small matter, it may be worthwhile to clear it up if, in the process, we can also shed some light on the conditions of authorship in the early 1850's. The most commonly cited sum said to have been paid for the serial, which ran in the National Era from June 5, 1851, to April 1, 1852, is $300. 1 However, in A History of American Magazines , 1850-1865 , Frank Luther Mott cites $400 as the amount she was paid by Gamaliel Bailey for Uncle Tom's Cabin . 2 There is some reason for believing that Mott's is the correct figure, even though the $300 one comes from a presumably reliable source—the authorized biography of Mrs. Stowe, written by her son, and for which she selected the material to be included. In theory, at least, this biography ought to contain "inside" information. But the author does not reveal his source and merely states, "For the story as a serial the author received $300" (Stowe, p. 158). The source of Mott's figure is documented. It came from an article on Bailey that appeared in the Atlantic Monthly for 1866. The article contains a long excerpt from a letter written by Bailey to a friend in 1853—when his memory was still fresh—in which he states unequivocally that he paid Mrs. Stowe the higher sum for the novel, although it was paid out in three installments: $100, $200 and $100. These payments were made at irregular intervals because neither Bailey nor Mrs. Stowe realized that she was going to turn out a novel, let alone such a long one. Bailey began by sending her $100 at the beginning of 1851 with instructions to write "'as much as she pleased, what she pleased, and when she pleased.'" 3 Her response to him indicates that she was thinking in terms of a story that would run through only three or four numbers of the Era . 4 When it became apparent that the story was going to go on indefinitely, and when Bailey discovered what it was doing for the circulation of the Era , he wrote to her again saying that although he had not contracted for such a story, nonetheless he felt "'bound to make her another remittance,'" and sent her $200 more. But still she wrote, and when at last Uncle Tom came to an end, he wrote to her once more. His remarks on the occasion of the writing are worth quoting in some detail for the light they shed on her status as a writer and on the relationship between editors and writers in this period: ". . . I wrote to Mrs. Stowe that, as I had not contemplated so large an outlay in my plans for the volume, as the paper had not received so much pecuniary benefit from its publication as it would have done could my readers have foreseen what it was to be, and as my large circulation had served as a tremendous advertisement for the work, which was now about to be published separately, and of which she held the copyright alone, I supposed that I ought not to pay for it so much as if these circumstances had not existed. But I simply stated the case to her,—submitted everything to her judgment,—and would pay her additional just exactly what she should determine was right. She named one hundred dollars more; this I immediately remitted," ( Atlantic , pp. 748-749). Mrs. Stowe could hardly have found a more agreeable editor than Bailey. Not only did he let her write what, when and as much as she pleased, but he also let her name the price. Clearly her star was already ascending. That Bailey's account of the matter is correct is substantiated by Mrs. Stowe's answer to him in which she asks for $400 and explains how she arrived at that figure: I am a very incompetent judge of my own performances as to their monied worth. My feeling on this subject has always been one of entire confidence in you as disposed to do always what is fair &amp; right whether with or without legal engagement &amp; so far the feeling has been fully supported. . . . In response to the question you propose I can only look at cases of other authors who furnish copy right works for current papers. My friend Mr. John Abbott of this town receives of the Harpers $100 per month for his Napoleon—his brother I believe the same for articles he furnishes. —They derive in addition all the advantage of circulation &amp; advertisement &amp;c— My story has spun nearly through a year &amp; embodies I suppose an equal amount of matter—Would it be unreasonable in this view for me to say $400 for it as a whole —This would be about the mental estimate I have placed on it—This would be about a third of what the Abbotts are receiving—I refer the matter to you with confidence. 5 Lest Mrs. Stowe appear to be undervaluing her own work here, it should be noted that the Abbotts were probably receiving top dollar for their work. John Abbott was, as Mrs. Stowe asserted, being paid $100 a month for his series of articles on Napoleon which appeared in Harpers' New Monthly Magazine over a space of four years, beginning in 1851. Jacob Abbott was being paid $5 a page in 1851 for his contributions to Harpers ', and by April 1852 he was receiving $10 a page. 6 According to Mott (pp. 19-25), no periodical at this time—with very rare exceptions—paid more than this, and most did not pay as much, when they bothered to pay at all. Mrs. Stowe had been writing long enough to be all too painfully aware of this fact, and in deciding how much to ask for her work she probably took it into account along with the fact that she was still a relatively unknown writer, whereas the Abbotts were at the peak of their popularity. She may also have given heed to Bailey's statement that he had not planned on such an outlay as he had already made, though she did discount his assertion that the advertisement she had gotten from the serialization of her novel ought to be taken into account in fixing upon a fair price. It is also possible that she had $400 in mind as a kind of mark to aim for as a year's income from her writing, for she wrote to her husband upon receipt of the first $100 from Bailey: ". . . I don't want to feel obliged to work as hard every year as I have this. I can earn four hundred dollars a year by writing, but I don't want to feel that I must. . . ." (Fields, p. 132).</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Edna St. Vincent Millay's Afterthoughts on the Translation of Baudelaire by Joan St. Clair Crane</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1936 Harper and Brothers published an edition of Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal translated by George Dillon and Edna St. Vincent Millay. It included the original French text and a long preface by Miss Millay. A copy of the second edition of the book is in the Clifton Waller Barrett Library of the University of Virginia. This copy, originally in the possession of Edna St. Vincent Millay, was given by her to her close friend, Allan Ross Macdougall (editor of Letters of Edna St. Vincent Millay , 1952), with the inscription, 'To Alling from Edner' 1 on the recto of the blank flyleaf. The Millay preface is an inspired essay on the art, theory, and practice of translating poetry which argues the translator's obligation to suggest the sound of the original poems by using their metre and form while remaining true to the original in style, matter, and mood: a goal most elusive of achievement when translating from a language having scarcely any stressed accents on the syllables of its words into a language in which every word has a definite and fixed stress on one of its syllables. Given the eccentricities of French and English, the translator who burdens himself with such a rigorously exacting method must frequently find that the final result falls short of the intention. The Barrett copy offers evidence that Millay was dissatisfied with certain parts of the translation—both of George Dillon's portion and her own. The text in the Barrett copy is emended by twenty-four penciled notes in Millay's hand. Several of the alterations substantially change the sense of the translations. By making these changes Millay implies that, for the sake of a graceful line, she or Dillon had permitted themselves the liberty of adaptation which unnecessarily distorted Baudelaire's intention. She also seems to think that Dillon has failed to take advantage of some opportunities for literal translation, availing himself instead of a more 'poetic' interpretation or using words that sound well in English while misrepresenting the meaning of the original. In the following collation, page and line references are to Flowers of Evil from the French of Charles Baudelaire (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1936; translated by George Dillon and Edna St. Vincent Millay). The original French text in italics is supplied first, followed by the printed translation and Millay's holograph alterations. Deleted words in the Millay holograph alterations are bracketed.

Note : In this fourth stanza of the poem Millay identifies Baudelaire's plagiarism of Thomas Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard , though her recollection is faulty in one line, 'And waste its sweetness. . . .' Millay's preface contains a long note on this literary curiosity. Bohemiens en Voyage — The Gypsies [G. D.], pp. 68-69 4 Le trésor toujours prêt des mamelles pendantes .] The teats of inexhaustible and swarthy breasts.] The teats of inexhaustible and drooping breasts.

Et tes pieds s'endormaient dans mes mains fraternelles La nuit s'épaississait ainsi qu'une cloison . Je sais l'art d'évoquer les minutes heureuses, Et revis mon passé blotti dans tes genoux . Car à quoi bon chercher tes beautés langoureuses Ailleurs qu'en ton cher corps et qu'en ton coeur si doux? Je sais l'art d'évoquer les minutes heureuses! Ces serments, ces parfums, ces baisers infinis, Renaîtront-ils d'un gouffre interdit à nos sondes, Comme montent au ciel les soleils rajeunis Après s'être lavés au fond des mers profondes? — O serments! ô parfums! ô baisers infinis! ] The night would close around us like a dim blue wall, And your eyes flashed within the darkness, and the sweet Drug of your breath came over me. Do you recall How I would love to lie for hours holding your feet? The night would close around us like a dim blue wall. I can relive the ecstasy that Time has slain; At moments I can feel myself between your thighs. What use to hope for anything like that again With someone else? What use to seek in any wise? I can relive the ecstasy that Time has slain. Those cries, those long embraces, that remembered scent: Can they be lost for ever? Will they not come round Like stars, like suns, to blaze upon the firmament Of future worlds, from the abyss we cannot sound? —O cries! O long embraces! O remembered scent!] The darkness of the night descended like a wall My eyes within the murk sought out your own And I drank in your breath, oh sweetness oh pall And in my friendly hands I held your sleeping feet [The darkness of the night descended like a wall] 2 I know the art of evoking happy times Recalling moments passed against your knees What boots it to seek out your languid lines Elsewhere than in your own dear form your gentle heart I know the art of evoking happy times! These pledges scents these kisses infinite Shall they well up from soundless depths As [rises up] mounts the new born sun to heaven's height From out the bath of oceans-deeps? These pledges, scents, these kisses infinite Note : an earlier reworking of l. 30 was: 'Oh pledges, perfumes, kisses infinite!'. Millay also underlined and queried the word 'thighs' in l. 22.

Ce pays nous ennuie, ô Mort! Appareillons! Si le ciel et la mer sont noirs comme de l'encre , Nos coeurs que tu connais sont remplis de rayons! ] Oh, Death, old captain, hoist the anchor! Come, cast off! We've seen this country, Death! We're sick of it! Let's go! The sky is black; black is the curling crest, the trough Of the deep wave; yet crowd the sail on, even so!] Oh, Death, old captain, hoist the anchor! Come, cast off! This country tires us, Death! We're sick of it! Let's go! The sky is black; inky the curling crest, the trough Yet is the heart you know still shining bright Note : Millay has overscored both the printed version and her holograph alterations in this stanza and the one following, indicating that she was dissatisfied with both.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The distortion of the names derives from Millay and Macdougall's habit of communicating in the dialect of Krazy Kat, a comic-strip character of the period they admired. 2 The line is not repeated in Millay's holograph version, but its presence is implied.</field>
