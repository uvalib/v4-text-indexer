      <field name="heading_text">Textual Instability and Editorial Idealism by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Over the past decade and a half there has been a notable shift of emphasis in the writing about textual matters, from a concern with authorial intention to an interest in the collaborative or social aspects of text-production. As the discussion has evolved, there has come to be an increased concern with textual instability and the significance of versions. All these concepts are naturally linked: for if texts are social products, then texts will take different shapes as they pass from one social milieu to another; and if authors are not the only source of validity in the constitution of texts, then all these variant texts carry their own authority as products of history. This attention to textual multiplicity extends backward into the initial creative process and forward into audience response (which is also a creative activity). Authorial versions — obvious emblems of textual instability — are studied both as products of particular moments and as parts of an endless process, which does not cease with the author's death; and readers, both during an author's lifetime and afterward, participate in this process by creating their own versions of the texts they encounter. These ideas are obviously related to the anti-foundationalist tendencies of philosophy and literary theory in the past generation. Their presence in recent textual theory is to be applauded as a sign — too often lacking in the past — that textual and literary theory and criticism share the same concerns; it also serves to focus textual critics' attention on topics they had previously neglected. There is no reason, of course, why these new interests should involve a banishment of authorial intention as a subject of study: it is clearly a part of the total textual process, and any comprehensive approach would have to include it. Many of the recent discussions, however, have denigrated it and have presented a distorted picture of intentionalist editors' attitudes. A number of stock elements reappear in essay after essay: intentionalist editors in the "Greg-Bowers tradition," so the standard argument goes, unrealistically think of a literary work as the isolated product of a single individual, and they seek to replace textual instability with fixity by conflating variant texts in order to produce a single "ideal" text of each work, a New Critical "verbal icon" that is unhistorical because it never appeared in this form in a document. None of these points accurately reflects the thinking of most intentionalist editors, and if the merit of these articles rested on their assessments of intentionalist editing, there would be little to commend them. 1 But one must remember that the value of the arguments for a new position do not depend on attacking an earlier position, and there are many worthwhile discussions in this recent material. In the pages that follow I shall survey the general theoretical writings that have appeared in English during the first half of the 1990s, trying to sort out what remains valuable after the distortions, oversimplifications, and loose arguments are removed. Because the field of textual study is attracting more interest as its connections with literary theory are more widely noticed, the body of writing from this five-year period is extraordinarily large. I have necessarily been selective, omitting, for example, most of the articles dealing with particular authors or editions. 2 Introductions to textual study are a similar category in that they do not normally aim to break theoretical ground, but I should note in passing that both D. C. Greetham and I produced new introductions during the past several years. Greetham's Textual Scholarship: An Introduction (1992; reprinted with an expanded checklist in 1994) takes the opposite approach, quantitatively, from my A Rationale of Textual Criticism , published three years earlier. His book is a long one, attempting to offer fairly detailed chapters on all aspects of bibliographical and codicological study as well as on the history and practice of textual criticism in all fields, 3 whereas my book is brief, aiming to set forth succinctly the basic theoretical considerations underlying textual work. 4 Greetham has also written an essay-length introduction for the reconstituted edition of the Modern Language Association's Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Languages and Literatures (1992), 5 and I have provided one as the opening piece in the same organization's Scholarly Editing: A Guide to Research (1995). 6 An event during these years that will not have gone unnoticed by anyone connected with textual scholarship was the death of Fredson Bowers on 11 April 1991. His dominance of the field for much of the second half of the twentieth century naturally made his death seem symbolic, coming at a time when the kind of edition he championed was under attack. 7 His view of the writings surveyed here might not have been very favorable, but the reason would not have been their frequent criticisms of intentionalist editing, for he was always open — as his editorship of Studies in Bibliography showed — to points of view that were not his own. What would probably have bothered him is the emphasis on theory, since his own preference was to concentrate on the practical problems of dealing with particular situations. 8 Theory is, I believe, more important than he thought it was; but one cannot help noticing how often theoretical discussions — in the field of textual scholarship as in other fields — proclaim as new insights what was taken for granted in earlier discussions. It is valuable, of course, to re-examine conventional assumptions, but sometimes the parties to the debate are simply speaking on different levels. This is one of the phenomena illustrated by the writings discussed below. I shall first examine two books, one by Jack Stillinger and the other by Jerome J. McGann, that exemplify the kinds of arguments being made and provide the opportunity for demonstrating the kinds of responses that seem to me appropriate. Dealing with these books in some detail will establish the framework within which one can respond to other writings and will, I trust, make it appropriate to comment more briefly on the other main contributors to the current debate. The second section below takes up the anthologies that were a notable feature of the early 1990s, and the third discusses some of the other essays, not in anthologies, that try to clarify the meanings of, and the distinctions among, concepts like work , text , and version . (Such discussions form a genre that looms large in the recent literature.) The final section tries to assess where all this commentary leaves us and how we can proceed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The title that Jack Stillinger chose for his 1991 book — Multiple Authorship and the Myth of Solitary Genius — reflects a strain of thinking that is one of the most characteristic features of recent textual criticism and reveals Stillinger's polemic stance. The first half of the title refers in a straightforward way to the collaborative aspects of all verbal works (indeed, all human creations); the second suggests that the discussion of this topic is meant to expose a common misconception, a "myth," which is then expressed in slanted terms as a belief in "solitary genius." Whether the idea of single authorship (to use a more neutral phrase) is a myth depends of course on how it is defined. Certainly it can be defined in such a way that it is not a myth, and I would argue that its commonly understood sense, among general readers and textual scholars alike, is far more realistic and sophisticated than the label "solitary genius" implies. Stillinger has not avoided the argumentative trap of treating the object of his attack in a reductive way. The bulk of his book presents a number of case histories of multiple authorship, and the work is useful as an exploration of the variety of such situations that have existed. Where it is troubling is in its attempt to put the illustrations to the service of refining an overstated "myth" and reinforcing recent criticisms of intentionalist editing. The real myth involved is the belief that intentionalist editing does not accommodate collaborative authorship and textual instability. Signs of Stillinger's reductivism are evident in the opening chapter, "What Is an Author?" He recounts the textual history of Keats's "Sonnet to Sleep" in order to demonstrate that "actually Keats wrote only most of the words — not all of them — and in the course of revision, transcription, and publication, the sonnet underwent numerous changes" at the hands of several other persons (p. 17), whom he also denominates "authors." Thus the text of the sonnet in Richard Monckton Milnes's Life of 1848 "has at least three authors" (p. 19), and the version in H. W. Garrod's Oxford edition "has at least four authors" (p. 20). Indeed, Stillinger adds, "I am myself part-author of the text of the sonnet," because in his 1978 edition he made some further alterations to the text. The subject of his book can therefore be stated as "situations where someone other than the nominal author is essentially and inextricably a part of the authorship" (p. 20); and he asserts, as if it were a startling thesis, "I wish to claim that such multiple authorship — the collaborative authorship of writings that we routinely consider the work of a single author — is quite common" (p. 22). There is no question that one can define authorship in this way if one wishes, using "author" to refer to anyone who plays any role at any time in the constitution of a text. But virtually no one would be surprised to learn that, under this definition, all texts have a multiple authorship. The concept of "single author" that most people "routinely" employ is not at odds with this point, for scarcely anyone is so simple-minded as to believe that a work by a single author does not incorporate any element that originated outside that author. What should bother any thoughtful reader of this chapter is that the most challenging and ultimately significant aspects of defining authorship are bypassed. To contrast multiple authorship, in Stillinger's inclusive sense, with the theoretical opposite extreme, a totally uninfluenced person, is not very fruitful. A far more intriguing pursuit would be to try to distinguish the kinds of collaborative influence that are realistically integral to the idea of an individual author from those that are at odds with it. Stillinger includes in his enumeration of "standard modes of composite creativity" not only the influence of friends but also "the author revising earlier versions of himself" and "the author interacting collaboratively with sources and influences" (p. 23). Surely it would be more productive to differentiate these latter two from multiple authorship than to include them in the concept. Revising authors can of course be thought of as different people from their earlier selves, but such wordplay makes multiple authorship metaphorical, which it is not in the other instances. And authors' reading, conversations, and other influential experiences combine to make authors the individuals they are; an author is no less "single" for being affected by external forces. Instead of offering a lucid framework for thinking about the varieties of collaborative action, this introductory chapter is bound to confuse readers. After ostensibly suggesting that each version of a text should be accepted on its own historical terms (with its authorship cumulatively incorporating all who have affected its makeup), Stillinger at another point seems to imply that authenticity lies with the originating single author: when Keats approved of a change made by Woodhouse, the new reading, we are told, "becomes an integral, rather than a corrupt, element of the text" (p. 21). But even without Keats's approval, it would have been an authentic (or "integral") part of the Woodhouse version, in which one can legitimately be interested. What is missing in the discussion is any clear outline of the range of interests that historically minded readers can have. One might wish to focus only on the originating author's intention (which cannot realistically exclude influences willingly and actively incorporated into it by that author); or one might choose to examine the form or forms of the text that emerged from the process of publication (forms that might include features not sanctioned, or even actively disapproved, by the originating author); or one might study any posthumous version as a way of understanding the responses of its readers. The second and third of these approaches concentrate, almost inevitably, on collaboratively produced texts that have survived in documents; the first necessitates the effort to reconstruct what the originating author intended, even if those intentions have been subverted by the documentary texts. Such a reconstruction, as traditionally undertaken by intentionalist editors, involves the interesting question of how to judge the spirit in which an author responded to various external stimuli. As in all matters of judgment, no single answer will satisfy everyone; but the range of serious answers reflects the struggle to locate the boundaries of individual creative activity. An authorially intended text, as normally conceived, includes readings that result from willing collaboration and excludes those produced under duress. Stillinger's gross oversimplification of these issues is clear in his claim that the ubiquity of multiple authorship is "rather strikingly at odds with the interpretive and editorial theorists' almost universal concern with author and authorship as single entities" (p. 22). 9 The truth is that the concern with single authors' intentions has regularly encompassed and accommodated the presence of collaborative elements in texts. 10 Underestimating the complexity of the traditional single-author approach allows Stillinger to end the chapter with a rhetorical flourish that has no substance beneath it: "Real multiple authors are more difficult to banish than mythical single ones," he says, and also "more difficult to apotheosize or deify as an ideal for validity in interpretation or textual purity" (p. 24). The notion that a search for a single author's intentions amounts somehow to a pursuit of an "ideal" or "pure" text became a leading cliché in textual discussions of the early 1990s. The text that an author intended at a given time is no more or less "ideal" than the goal of any other kind of historical reconstruction. And it is no more "pure" than the text from any other past moment — just more appropriate for some kinds of historical interests (and less so for others). If Stillinger had laid out the diversity of goals that readers (including editors) can have, and then discussed the concepts of authorship relevant to each, he would have provided a better introduction to the subject of authorship. In his final chapter ("Implications for Theory"), 11 he returns to a consideration of editorial theory and devotes the closing pages of the book to a criticism of the "Greg-Bowers school" (p. 200). Whereas readers unacquainted with editorial debates of the past half-century will nevertheless see the flaws of the opening chapter, they will not be in a position to recognize the distortions in his presentation of the Greg-Bowers approach in the last chapter. He repeats the hackneyed claims that this approach rigidly applies the same rule to all situations, that it always combines early accidentals with late substantives, and that it is inhospitable to the idea of independent versions (see pp. 196 — 198) — claims that cannot be substantiated. 12 But even those readers (untutored in editorial controversy) who assume the "Greg-Bowers scheme" (p. 199) to be as foolish as it is here depicted will be troubled by the thinking underlying some of the criticisms. One of the most exaggerated is the statement that the "Greg-Bowers theory," aspiring to "the Platonically perfect realization of an author's final intentions," produces "'ideal' texts that never previously existed," amounting to "the realization of editors' rather than authors' intentions" (p. 198). To thoughtful readers, this rhetoric will be undercut by the questionable view of historical inquiry that emerges. The key to the problem surfaces in an earlier comment: "authors' intentions are no more available to editors than they are to interpreters" (p. 195). 13 If collaborative intentions are considered to be "available" because the texts that have come down to us in physical objects are likely to be collaborative, and if only such "available" texts are proper subjects for historical study, then two fallacies of historical methodology are implicit here. One is that artifacts speak clearly for themselves; the other is that surviving materials are necessarily more instructive than speculations about those now lost. As to the first, a documentary text does not make the collaborative intention behind it "available" without analysis and interpretation (since the problem of distinguishing intended from unintended aspects of physical texts is equally acute no matter how many "authors" there are). As to the second, other texts, besides those now surviving in physical form, once existed (on paper, perhaps, and in people's minds, certainly), and some of them may be of enough interest to be worth attempting to reconstruct; the process requires judgment, but no more so (and no less so) than the use of documentary texts. 14 To say that intentionalist editors produce "texts that never previously existed" is not a criticism (if it means, as I assume it does, "never previously existed on paper"), for there is no reason to suppose that intended texts have always appeared in physical form — nor is there any reason to banish from historical inquiry the use of informed judgment to reconstruct past events. The claim that reconstructed texts realize "editors' rather than authors' intentions" would, if taken literally, be a valid objection (so long, that is, as the concern is with historical reconstruction rather than the unending process of textual collaboration). But what such texts normally incorporate is editors' judgments about past intentions rather than editors' own intentions. Editors' own temperaments are naturally involved, but only in the same way that all historians' personalities play a role in the attempted recreation of the past. Stillinger seems, surprisingly, to have adopted here an extremely restrictive concept of what constitutes proper historical scholarship. 15 He was of course under no obligation to deal with these matters, and it is unfortunate that he chose to do so. His studies of specific instances of "multiple authorship" are informative and valuable in their own right; by deciding to frame them within an attack on intentionalist editing, and then conducting the argument illogically, he weakened his book. 16 But the urge to narrow the range of legitimate editorial goals was obviously hard to resist at the time he wrote. The name of Jerome J. McGann comes up in Stillinger's book as the exponent of a "socialized concept of literary production," with which "the facts of multiple authorship are most compatible" (p. 199). A collection of McGann's essays, entitled The Textual Condition , appeared the same year as Stillinger's book (1991) and offers a far more effective statement of the position. Although McGann claims that his book provides "case studies" and not "a theory" (p. 16), readers are likely to feel that theory is integral to it, whereas in Stillinger's book the theory is only a garnish. McGann's point of view is by now well known and need not be summarized here. 17 But his particular way of stating it in his introduction ("Texts and Textualities") is worth noting, for this essay is one of his best presentations of his case. He defines "the textual condition" (which gives the book its title) as the necessity for "material negotiations" in "textual events"; textual meaning, in other words, comes from "exchanges" that are "materially executed" (p. 3). Textuality can only be a "phenomenal event" (p. 5) in which there is "transmissive interaction" (p. 11) between readers and "a laced network of linguistic and bibliographical codes" (p. 13). Textual study, then, focuses on "these complex (and open-ended) histories of textual change and variance" (p. 9). As the last sentence puts it, "the meaning is in the use, and textuality is a social condition of various times, places, and persons" (p. 16). All this is unexceptionable in itself. Where McGann falters, as his earlier writings have already demonstrated, is in his linking of these ideas to a rejection of authorial intention as a goal of textual study. In this instance, he claims that Paul De Man and I "come together as textual idealists," for we both (despite other pronounced differences) are caught — as he sees it — between a concept of artistic creation as "a transcendence of the human" and a realization "that the terms of such a demand can never be met" (p. 7). He contrasts his own approach as "another way of thinking about texts" (p. 8) — an alternative that he apparently sees as incompatible. The exposition is confrontational: "One breaks the spell of romantic hermeneutics by socializing the study of texts" (p. 12). Any point of view that holds a spell over a field no doubt deserves to be challenged, and questioning authorial intention as the dominant concern of textual criticism has been a salutary phenomenon. But the questioning is less helpful than it might be if it fails to recognize how the intentionalist and the socialized emphases fit together — if, in other words, it simply replaces one spell with another, for to do so continues to restrict artificially the areas of investigation that can profitably be pursued. I think one can see how McGann distorts the study of authorial intention if one looks at two matters: his associating it with "textual idealism," and his seeming rejection of intended texts as stages in the history of textual instability. As to the first, McGann confuses "idealism" with a notion of perfection as well as with a concern for "idea" rather than execution. His "other way" of looking at texts, he explains, rejects any sense that texts are less perfect as a result of being embodied physically; embodied texts are examples of "perfect limitation," their "perfectness" being "located within the sociological particulars which the perfection defines" (p. 9). 18 To believe otherwise — to hold that texts in physical form are debased versions of "ideal" texts — is to believe, he says (quoting Shelley's famous words), that "the most glorious poetry . . . communicated to the world is probably a feeble shadow of the original conception of the poet" (p. 8). Or, as McGann argues at the end of the book, if "text" has "no material existence" and "comprises an abstraction," then "text" is being taken to mean "the idea of textuality" (p. 178, italics his). I do not believe, however, that any of these points has been held by the editors who have concentrated on authorial intention: their goal is not to reconstruct the "idea" that lies behind a work but to recover an actual text — a specific set of words — that is not adequately represented in any known physical document. My phrase "the intractability of the physical," which McGann takes as a sign of my "romantic" position (pp. 7 — 8), has — in its context in A Rationale of Textual Criticism — a less exalted meaning. It simply refers to the difficulty of getting words transferred accurately to a physical surface. Authors do formulate texts, not just ideas for texts, at the moment of composition; but they may make mistakes in writing down the words. An authorially intended text is a text that once existed, though it may not have existed in physical form. Such a situation can occur because language is intangible, and a verbal text can therefore exist apart from being made physical. Although literary works may frequently fail to live up to their authors' ideas for the works, this point is irrelevant to what intentionalist editors do, for they are concerned with the works, whether or not those works are pale shadows of grand conceptions. The only sense in which intentionalist editors construct "ideal" texts is that those texts may not have existed in physical form before the editors produced them; but such editors do not think of their texts as "perfect" in any sense, nor do these editors believe that they are uncovering the "idea of a text" underlying any particular executed text. Intentionalist editors are not idealists in a philosophical sense (or, at least, are not revealing in their work where they stand on this matter), because their activities do not imply a belief that truth lies behind physical appearances; they are merely confronting the awkward fact that actual works can employ intangible media. 19 We thus come to the second of McGann's misconceptions about the study of intentions: his failure to consider intentions as historical events. The history of a text begins before the social encounter in which a reader engages a pre-existing text (pre-existing only in the sense that the reader is interacting with something and not in any sense that attributes passivity to reading). One can, if one chooses, define the condition of textuality so that it is limited to collaborative interchange, but doing so excludes part of the story. Surely the "textual condition" must include what authors face when they are working at their desks; and the texts they form in their minds have a place in any encompassing view of textual metamorphosis. The instability of texts is beyond dispute, and editors who produce critical texts aimed at representing authors' intentions have never claimed otherwise — as their repeated comments on the importance of an apparatus of variants shows. 20 They construct such texts not because they believe that no other texts are valid but because intended texts are not available in documents and therefore cannot be studied without the exercise of critical judgment, leading to attempted reconstructions. The most fundamental point underlying this activity is a recognition that historical inquiry cannot be limited to what happens to exist in physical form. Any kind of history — not merely textual but also military, economic, political, social, and so on — depends on the effort to fill the gaps in, and indeed to correct, the physical record, which is inevitably incomplete and potentially misleading. Intentionalist editors are not, through their work, declaring that an ideal (and unchanging) world should be substituted for a fallen (and unstable) one; they are simply saying that the texts intended by authors at particular moments have a place in the long story of what happens to texts — the "ceaseless process of textual development and mutation," in McGann's words (p. 9). By regarding the study of intended texts as alien to, rather than a natural part of, his historical vision, McGann restricts the comprehensiveness of his approach and limits its revelatory power. 21 In between the "Introduction" and the "Conclusion," on which these comments are based, there are seven essays (five of them previously published, some in shorter form) that similarly illustrate the limitations of McGann's argument. 22 His considerable strengths are shown, too, largely in his numerous discussions of the ways in which the physical presentations of texts constitute part of the "textual condition." For example, the essay placed as Chapter 3, "The Socialization of Texts" (from 1990), contains a good survey of instances where "bibliographical codes" obviously affect readers' understanding (pp. 77 — 83). The problem, as usual, is the context of the discussion, for the preceding pages equate "eclectic" editing with a belief in single versions of works; McGann therefore thinks it a criticism of such editing to point out that the "universe of poiesis" has no "absolute center" and does not exist in a "steady state" (p. 75). But the instability of texts comes as no surprise, and poses no threat, to eclectic editors, whose goal is to select readings from wherever they can be found (in documents or in editors' minds) in order to attempt the reconstruction of texts as they were intended at particular moments — not to force one text to represent all moments. McGann thus misstates the primary difference between his point of view and that of eclectic editors — which is that the latter recognize the significance of nonextant texts and the usefulness of trying to reconstruct them. The difference between the two approaches can be further clarified by using the terms of Chapter 2, "What Is Critical Editing?", where one of the main defects of Greg-Bowers critical editing (in his view) is defined as its failure to deal with the "bibliographical" (or physical) characteristics of textual artifacts. "The weakness of the theory," he says, referring to copy-text theory, "is that it largely ignores the transmissive or communicative aspects of linguistic events" — for "'Copy-text,' in modern editorial theory, is always a linguistic text" (p. 57). By regarding textuality as the condition emerging from an intertwining of linguistic and bibliographical "codes," 23 and by recommending an emphasis on the comparative analysis of variants rather than on the production of eclectic texts, McGann believes that he is offering "a more comprehensive imagination of the fields of textual criticism and critical editing" (p. 50, italics mine). Just above I objected that his approach lacks the "comprehensiveness" of the one he is criticizing. How these cross-claims of comprehensiveness arose is not difficult to explain and defines the central issue of the debate. If critical editing in the Greg-Bowers tradition — or "eclectic" editing, to use McGann's term — were really dismissive of, or oblivious to, the textual significance of physical presentation, 24 then McGann would be correct to say that recognizing it enlarges, or makes more comprehensive, the editorial purview. Eclectic editing, however, when it focuses on authorial intention, is pledged to be concerned with whatever the author was concerned with; when an author makes visual effects on the page a part of the work, an intentionalist editor deals with them as textual, but not otherwise. Such editing in no way denies the fact (and it can indeed be considered a fact) that "bibliographical codes" (book designs, in other words) do invariably play a role in the interaction between readers and embodied texts; 25 it simply concentrates on different historical moments from those represented by documents. In wishing to discourage this latter activity, McGann ironically narrows the scope of editorial endeavor while professing to broaden it. A brief comment should perhaps be added here about the first chapter, entitled "Theory, Literary Pragmatics, and the Editorial Horizon," because it shows how readily the intentionalist approach actually fits within McGann's overall scheme. After making his usual point that "texts are produced and reproduced under specific social and institutional conditions," he concludes that "every text, including those that may appear to be purely private, is a social text" — an "event" or "point in time" (p. 21). Those who focus on authorial intention (and are thus interested in texts that may, at first thought, "appear to be purely private") are in fact attempting to reconstruct particular events that occurred at particular times, events that are inevitably social, since intention is itself socially formed (as I pointed out in discussing Stillinger above). But instead of giving intentionalist editing its niche within his framework, McGann caricatures it as something that has no place there, calling it "technical, specialized, and ahistorical" (p. 22) 26 and later summing up its goal as "an ideal version — an eclectic text" (p. 29). 27 The word "eclectic" is of course not incorrect here, but in the context it is given the inaccurate connotation of "ahistorical." An intended text must be eclectic in that it is not documentary and therefore has to be constructed from all available sources. But it is neither unhistorical nor ahistorical because the intention being reconstructed is tied to a particular moment. An editor who emends an early documentary text with some readings from a late document is not attempting to construct a single, final, ideal, ahistorical text but to reconstruct what was intended at a specific time — either an early time (if the argument is that those emendations represent what had been intended but not executed in the early text) or a late time (if the argument is that, with the exception of the late readings chosen as emendations, the text of the late document does not reflect the author's late intention as satisfactorily as does the text of the early document). And the process, though perhaps "technical" and "specialized" in some respects, is certainly not mechanical, since it involves critical judgment throughout. The result is therefore undeniably a product of the present, but it is a present effort to recapture the past, which is all that any historical scholarship can be, as McGann well understands. When he says at the end, "To edit a text is to be situated in a historical relation to the work's transmissions, but it is also to be placed in an immediate relation to contemporary cultural and conceptual goals" (p. 47), one can scarcely disagree with him. And I am glad that he labels as "deeply mistaken" the idea of the "editor-as-technical-functionary." But it is regrettable (and puzzling) that he encumbers his basically sensible point of view with an unreasoned exclusion of one whole area of textual history, thereby turning his book into a symbol of the recent fixation on intentionalist editing as supposedly based on unrealistic notions of literary production and textual stability.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the publishing scene in the field of textual criticism during the early 1990s was the appearance of an extraordinary number of anthologies of essays — so many that this period may be thought of in the future as the Age of Anthologies in textual study. From 1990 through mid-1995, at least twenty-five anthologies in English (or largely in English) were published, in addition to the three volumes of Text (volumes 5, 6, and 7) brought out by the Society for Textual Scholarship during this time. 28 This figure can be put in perspective by noting that only about thirty-four were produced in the entire two decades preceding 1990 (plus four volumes of Text ). Of those, nineteen were part of the series of annual volumes (in effect constituting a periodical) containing the papers delivered at the Toronto Conferences on Editorial Problems; since only three Toronto volumes appeared in the early 1990s, the dramatic nature of the recent increase in anthology production can more truly be shown by comparing the numbers of anthologies excluding the Toronto series (and volumes of Text ) — some fifteen during 1970 — 89 and twenty-two during 1990 — 95. 29 For many years — through 1980 — there were essentially only three separately published anthologies (besides the Toronto volumes, which began in 1966), and they consisted almost entirely of previously published pieces; 30 the gathering of original essays did not begin in earnest until the 1980s, when several notable collections appeared. 31 But the real spurt occurred in the early 1990s and (since the number of periodicals available as outlets had not declined) 32 can be taken as evidence of the intellectual ferment that now characterizes the field. These recent anthologies have published a large amount of valuable textual commentary, but fewer than half contain the kind of general theoretical discussion that requires examination here. It is not necessary, for example, to comment on those collections that concentrate on a single author or edition, such as the New Oxford Shakespeare or the Gabler Ulysses . 33 Then there are those anthologies that deserve a mention in this context because of their significant treatment of bibliographical study at large but that are not primarily concerned with textual work — namely, Peter Davison's The Book Encompassed: Studies in Twentieth-Century Bibliography (1992) and Nicolas Barker's A Potencie of Life: Books in Society (1993). 34 Some of the anthologies dealing with a single period or country can also be passed by, though it is worth noting that they frequently allude to the recent theoretical debates and the growing interaction between literary and textual criticism. For example, the introduction to the collection of papers from a 1989 Odense symposium, significantly entitled The Medieval Text: Editors and Critics (1990), speaks in its second paragraph of "the intimately intellectual relationship between medieval as well as modern editors and critics" (p. 9). 35 In another volume with a similar title, Tim William Machan's Medieval Literature: Texts and Interpretation (1991), the editor makes clear that the two terms of his subtitle are inseparable. 36 And Crux and Controversy in Middle English Textual Criticism , edited by A. J. Minnis and Charlotte Brewer (1992), contains papers by Machan and by Ralph Hanna III that regard traditional concepts of authorial intention to be inappropriate for medieval texts. 37 Two other anthologies with titles even more symptomatic of the times are Roberta Frank's The Politics of Editing Medieval Texts (1993) and Randall McLeod's Crisis in Editing: Texts of the English Renaissance (1994), both in the Toronto series. 38 If, for present purposes, we exclude these and several similar volumes, we are left with a dozen anthologies that call for somewhat more detailed notice. 39 Of the 1990 anthologies, two — both based on conferences held in the spring of 1989 — include general theoretical papers by prominent commentators. New Directions in Textual Studies , edited by Dave Oliphant and Robin Bradford, results from a conference of the same title at the University of Texas in Austin (30 — 31 March, 1 April 1989) and deals — in the words of Larry Carver's introduction — with "the fate of the Greg-Bowers model" and "the place of the social setting in the editing of books and manuscripts" (p. 10). 40 Articles by Jerome McGann, Randall McLeod, and D. F. McKenzie convincingly display, in their individual ways, the role of physical presentation in reading 41 — a point that (as we have seen above) complements, rather than contradicts, the "Greg-Bowers model." Three other articles are marred (in varying degrees) by their more overt acceptance of an inaccurate stereotyped view of that model. For example, Lotte Hellinga, after examining what happened to several texts in the fifteenth-century printing shop, says that multiple forms of texts "may be more deserving of our attention" than "the identification of one definitive result" (p. 149). Michael Warren's paper, though it rightly points out the usefulness of making multiple documentary texts available, takes an extreme position in its rejection of critical editing as a "retreat from the material to the ideal" (p. 59); he seems to think that the construction of eclectic texts signifies a dissatisfaction with the world as it is. "Are contingency and mutability not good enough for us?" he asks, and he ends with the claim that editors need provide nothing besides "accurate documentation." Hans Walter Gabler's overview of the relation of textual and literary criticism makes the most exaggerated comments of all — stating that the recent interest in Shakespearean versions bears "the signs of a minor Kuhnian scientific revolution"; asserting that the study of versions "requires drawing upon critical faculties and resources in ways that Anglo-American mainstream textual criticism . . . has sought to eliminate" in its "Platonic approach," its "search for the pure ideal" (p. 154); and comparing the two approaches by saying that the intentionalist editor serves as "the author's executor" rather than "the historian of the text" (p. 159). 42 This last comment epitomizes the limited conception of historical study that underlies most of the criticisms of authorial intention as an editorial concern. The other anthology, Editing in Australia , edited by Paul Eggert, emerges from an April 1989 conference at the Australian Defence Force Academy and is much broader than its title suggests, for it engages the major issues of textual debate. The tone is set by Eggert's remark, in the preface, that "there was a sense at the conference that traditional scholarly editing practices had become profoundly problematic" (p. vii). Nevertheless, his own paper recognizes that "traditional" editing is not invalidated by an understanding of textual instability; his point, as he emphasizes it, is "not that the eclectic edition no longer has a place but that it should not be considered the automatic or the natural choice" (p. 27). In line with this reasonable conclusion, he describes how a critical text with a carefully constructed apparatus can enable the reader to know both the "textual process" and a "textual product" (pp. 37 — 38) — a point that "traditional" editors have regularly made (whether or not the forms of their apparatuses were as well designed as they might have been). Given his balanced approach, it is surprising that he does at times (especially early in the essay) repeat uncritically some of the standard complaints about "eclectic" editing — describing as "worrying facts," for instance, the production of a "text that has had no prior historical existence" and the construction of a "synchronic representation of a textual process that was in fact diachronic" (pp. 24 — 25). The inaccuracy of these two observations should by now be obvious, 43 as should the pointlessness of associating eclectic editing with "the lost innocence of the Verbal Icon" (p. 23) or the New Criticism (p. 24). This strand in the essay makes the conclusion read more like a compromise dictated by book-form (as contrasted with electronic) editions than a positive welcoming of what critical texts (in whatever form) can uniquely contribute to historical understanding. The other essay in Editing in Australia that requires comment here 44 is Peter Shillingsburg's "The Autonomous Author, the Sociology of Texts and Polemics of Textual Criticism" (pp. 41 — 64), which is one of the best theoretical essays in all the recent anthologies. It advocates a "contextual" approach in which each reader's (and thus each editor's) "contextualisation" determines meaning and, from it, textual authority: every word and punctuation mark must be evaluated in the light of all the contextual factors (biographical, sociological, bibliographical, and so on) that have been considered, and the multiplicity (or instability) of the resulting texts reflects the "richness" that has been uncovered. Although this position is not new, and is indeed the one that thoughtful editors of the last fifty years have normally held, it is extremely well set forth here (and admirably illustrated by Henry Esmond ), and for that reason the essay deserves a continuing audience. Shillingsburg sees that instability and comprehensiveness go together: textual criticism, like other kinds of interpretation, "is most satisfying when it takes into account all that can be thought of as relevant to its concerns" (p. 62). One is therefore surprised by his apparent belief that there is a choice to be made between "product" and "process," as when he declares himself in favor of the latter (p. 46) and notes approvingly that "editions which emphasise the importance of Process" are "gaining ground" (p. 62). The two concepts are complementary, for every "product" is one element in a "process": to think in terms of process entails thinking of a series of products. And every conceptualization of a text, as envisioned by Shillingsburg, results in a product. Critical editors in the past often "foregrounded" one such product as a result of the limitations of the codex form of their editions, but they generally intended their apparatus to situate that product in a process, any stage of which was worthy of attention. 45 Of course, some editors have undoubtedly made "extravagent claims for the correctness of the Product" (p. 62), and their attitude can properly be objected to; but one cannot assume that the presence in an edition of a "single-finished-product text" (p. 45) points to an editor who fails to understand the importance of studying textual process. 46 Nevertheless, Shillingsburg's essay contains more admirable than questionable commentary, and his idea of "comprehensive textual criticism" (p. 61) should be encouraged. Recent discussions would have been more productive if more people had recognized, with him, that any theory failing to accommodate "the reader's and editor's dual responsibility to authorial intention and to the social contract" is "lopsided" (p. 62). The Shillingsburg and Eggert essays were reprinted the following year in Philip Cohen's anthology Devils and Angels: Textual Editing and Literary Theory , which aims to promote dialogue between editors and literary theorists by exploring the ways that recent developments in literary theory have "problematized" (p. x) traditional editing and set in motion what may be "a paradigm shift in textual criticism" (p. xiv). 47 The essays are organized into three groups, each ending with an article of response to the essays in that group. In the first such response, T. H. Howard-Hill displays a useful skepticism regarding the essays by Shillingsburg and McGann (the McGann piece discussed above as the first chapter of The Textual Condition ) and offers some needed reminders that the basic points currently being debated are not "fresh issues" (p. 48) — indeed, he says, Greg recognized the instability of texts "before McGann, Shillingsburg, and I were born" (p. 49). 48 Steven Mailloux, in the second response-article, discusses the Eggert piece, an essay by D. C. Greetham, and one written jointly by Philip Cohen and David H. Jackson. 49 Mailloux's sensible response asks a question about Eggert that could be applied to a great many recent writers on textual theory: "Why does he feel it necessary to set up an absolute opposition" between a determinate authorial intention and a poststructuralist indeterminacy (p. 125)? Both positions, he argues, are equally "arbitrary" (p. 130) unless seen in a framework that allows for their usefulness under varying circumstances. Another salutary observation is made by William E. Cain in the third response-article, on essays by James McLaverty, Hans Walter Gabler, and Joseph Grigely: 50 that "no theory will ever succeed in taking the measure of the elusive, dynamic textuality of texts," and thus there will be no "end of further theorizing about and making of new texts" (p. 197). It is essential for editors to think about what they are doing, but no rationale can control "the partiality and incompleteness of all acts of text-making" (p. 200). The inclusion of these response-articles causes the volume to have greater balance than it would have otherwise, for they remind readers of significant points often lost sight of in the current debates. As for the essays thus commented upon, the most important (and best-written), in my view, is McLaverty's — indeed, I would place it among the four or five best essays on textual theory in recent years. He suggests thinking about textual instability in terms of two questions, which indeed go to the heart of the matter: what are "versions," and what texts should editors present to readers? He defines a version as an "utterance" (the "social act" [p. 144] of "making outer or external" [p. 140]) that is linked to one or more other utterances through "material, structure, and function" (p. 137). The history of a work, extending through time, is likely to comprise numerous utterances, all of which are obviously relevant to understanding that history. But, as McLaverty perceptively argues, the history of the work is to be distinguished from the text of the work, which is not the sum of all the utterances but the text of every utterance individually considered. What an edition should present, he recommends, is one or more of "the author's intended utterance(s)," with an apparatus enabling the reader "to construct the relation of each intended utterance to others and to actual utterances" (p. 144); 51 the choice among utterances for the reading text (or texts) would depend on the editor's interests, and "the final intention that matters" would be "the final intention for the utterance" (p. 148). Reducing McLaverty's subtle argument to this brief summary serves to show that his approach is what many intentionalist editors have been following all along. Indeed, the refinement of the argument, drawing on aesthetics and speech-act theory, is what is new here, not the conclusion. McLaverty realizes that an "emphasis on utterance would not have startling consequences" (p. 148); but one consequence he hopes for is that different editors might focus on different utterances, thus increasing the number of versions available to readers. However unrealistic this hope is, the essay is welcome as an elegant restatement of the compatibility of an interest in intention with a recognition of textual instability. The essay of Grigely's has many links with McLaverty's, but Grigely — drawing even more widely on recent literary theory and philosophy — emphasizes the unrepeatability of utterances, since every utterance is an event; even if the words can sometimes be accurately repeated, the context cannot. With wit and intelligence (and a good dose of jargon), he sketches here what he hopes is "the beginning of a philosophy of textuality" (p. 192); but it also may seem to imply an end of editing. Yet editors, like other historians, have always known that they cannot fully recapture the past; and Grigley's comprehensive concept of utterances can in fact help clarify for them what their efforts do, and will continue to, accomplish. 52 Of the other essays, Greetham's energetically explores "the ideology embedded in form and method" (p. 81), 53 Gabler's scolds Anglo-American editors for not paying enough attention to German developments, 54 and Cohen and Jackson's — despite seeing paradigms everywhere — offers convenient summaries of several currently debated approaches. The other anthologies of 1991 contain fewer general theoretical essays. Representing Modernist Texts: Editing as Interpretation , edited by George Bornstein, largely consists of pieces on the texts of "modernist writers" (Yeats, Pound, Joyce, and Woolf, among others); but it does contain an introduction by Bornstein entitled "Why Editing Matters" (pp. 1 — 16) and a concluding essay by Michael Groden entitled "Contemporary Textual and Literary Theory" (pp. 259 — 286). Bornstein states that the volume aims "to explore the implications for literary critics and theorists of the recent revolution in editorial theory" (p. 5); and though he sometimes exaggerates the contrast between "traditional" theories (which "postulate the notion of an ideal 'correct' text" [p. 5]) and newer approaches (which "dislodge the notion of one privileged form for a text exercising authority over all other forms" [p. 7]), he usefully emphasizes "a firm belief in the potential of contemporary literary criticism and theory and of contemporary textual scholarship and theory to enrich each other" (p. 9). A volume exemplifying this belief is certainly to be welcomed, as is Groden's contribution, which perceptively and thoughtfully examines recent textual theories. In contrast to many of the historical surveys that now exist, his does not oversimplify the positions discussed, and it offers the best account I have seen of the relations between intentionalist editing and the New Criticism. 55 Another 1991 collection that focuses on the literature of a single period is the special issue of Romance Philology on medieval textual criticism (45.1, August 1991), edited by Charles B. Faulhaber and Jerry R. Craddock (and containing one of the most extensive checklists of writings on textual criticism and on the use of computers in textual criticism [pp. 206 — 236]). Of the overviews of the French, Italian, and Spanish fields, only the one on Old French is in English, and it is distinguished: Mary B. Speer's "Editing Old French Texts in the Eighties: Theory and Practice" (pp. 7 — 43). Speer lucidly and sensibly summarizes the twentieth-century history of the field (following from Bédier's advocacy of the best-text approach), offers a shrewd analysis (pp. 15 — 22) of Bernard Cerquiglini's Eloge de la variante (1989), and examines a number of recent editions, recognizing that editions always reflect "an interpretive conception" (p. 25). She finds the "intensity" of recent debates "a healthy sign" (p. 24), and her balanced way of dealing with them merits the attention of scholars outside, as well as within, her field. Editorial subjectivity again receives considerable attention in Ian Small and Marcus Walsh's collection, The Theory and Practice of Text-Editing: Essays in Honour of James T. Boulton (1991). The introduction, by both editors, and the concluding two essays — Walsh's on Richard Bentley and Small's on annotation — deal with some of the ways that judgment permeates the editorial enterprise and effectively illustrate how any aspect of editing that one examines can lead to a consideration of basic questions about the nature of literature. 56 Annotation is the entire subject of another 1991 anthology (based on an April 1988 Irvine conference), Annotation and Its Texts , edited by Stephen A. Barney. Although the essays cover all forms of scholarly commentary (or "secondary discourse," to use the term in Jacques Derrida's concluding essay), not just the apparatus for editions, the relevance of the topic to the study of editorial subjectivity is obvious. Barney's brief introduction repeatedly speaks of "a politics of annotation" and "the rhetoric of annotation," reflecting the same interest as recent writers on textual criticism, who have looked at the politics and rhetoric reflected in all parts of editions. A whole anthology devoted to this subject in reference to Hispanic literatures appeared the next year (1992), under the title The Politics of Editing (edited by Nicholas Spadaccini and Jenaro Talens). At the beginning of their introduction, the editors say that a "common thread" connecting the essays in this volume is "an awareness of editing as an interpretative practice" (p. ix) — hardly a startling revelation. Later they seem to link this idea with an effort to "problematize" the concepts of "the authoritative text and authorial intentions" (p. xvi). But there is no necessary connection, since editorial subjectivity can take the form of an interest in authors' intentions as readily as an interest in any other approach. In 1993, George Bornstein and Ralph G. Williams edited Palimpsest: Editorial Theory in the Humanities (based on a November 1991 Ann Arbor conference) as the first volume of a series called "Editorial Theory and Literary Criticism" to be published by the University of Michigan Press (publisher of Bornstein's 1991 anthology). Bornstein explains the choice of the layering metaphor of the palimpsest for the title as a way of emphasizing the recent focus on works as "contingent and constructed rather than unitary and received" (p. 2). In order to link the Greg-Bowers "consensus" inflexibly with the latter, however, he grossly exaggerates its "absolutist claims." The concept of authority, he believes, is basic to the distinction, for authority "seems to recognize a stable, unitary text rather than an unstable, multiple one." But his examples of textual authority involve the perceived need on the part of religious, political, and social institutions to promulgate "authorized" texts or to "legitimate" themselves by so doing; 57 and in limiting "authority" to this sense, he ignores its primary meanings for textual scholars. Documentary texts are usually said to possess authority when they provide relevant evidence for a given purpose: thus for editors concerned with authorial intention, any documentary text that can serve as the most direct source of an authorial reading is a text carrying authority. There is no suggestion here of a "unitary" text of authority (because many texts with authority may exist), and there is no reason for "authority" in this sense to be of use only to intentionalist editors. Furthermore, when critical editors apply "authority" or "authoritative" to their own constructed texts, they do not usually mean that those texts are the only ones required, for every purpose now and in the future; what they generally mean is that the critical texts result from the systematic effort to identify and evaluate authoritative documentary texts (and they do not mean to imply that the same judgments would be made by everyone). Even those editors who have called their texts "definitive" — though it is indeed improper to apply this word to a product of critical judgment — have recognized that each critical text concentrates on a single moment in the history of a work and that other moments could be chosen for critical reconstruction. Bornstein does not promote a real understanding of "the recent upheaval in textual scholarship" (p. 5) by oversimplifying what went before in order to make the contrast more dramatic than it actually is. This introduction sets the tone for much of the volume. In the opening essay, for example, D. C. Greetham attempts, with characteristic playfulness, to distinguish editorial modernism from postmodernism — but at the price of distorting "twentieth-century eclecticism" by equating it with an "attempted reconstruction of the 'text that never was,'" or with a "courting of the ideal authorial form" (p. 18). Eclectic editors, however, explicitly seek to construct what once existed and do not think of the result as "ideal" (whatever that means) — nor do they believe that their efforts "will produce a final 'understanding' of the text." Greetham's contrast — between the modernist editor striving for a stable, authoritative text and the postmodernist editor emphasizing the open-endedness and contingency of texts — is unrealistically neat and compartmentalized. In the next essay Peter Shillingsburg makes generally helpful observations about electronic texts, but not without first claiming — incorrectly — that scholarly editors have traditionally believed a literary work of art to be "equivalent" both to "the linguistic text" and to "the ideal or best version of it" (p. 31). 58 But Palimpsest does contain a counter-balance in the form of Ralph G. Williams's reasonable and unpolemical meditation: in concluding that textual boundaries and meanings are indeterminate and that no philosophical basis exists for believing in the identifiability of intentions, he does not oversimplify the positions held by intentionalist editors. Indeed, he recognizes that the inability to determine intentions with certainty does not make the search "uninteresting, illegitimate, and passé": "We have protocols of considerable subtlety for evaluating intent, and that game seems not only a persistent cultural practice, but well worth the candle, where we do not grow fierce and dogmatic about it" (pp. 60 — 61). 59 Another anthology of 1993, W. Speed Hill's New Ways of Looking at Old Texts: Papers of the Renaissance English Text Society, 1985 — 1991 , collects — as the subtitle indicates — the papers that were read at seven annual meetings of RETS and prefaces them with a substantial essay of Hill's entitled "Editing Nondramatic Texts of the English Renaissance: A Field Guide with Illustrations" (pp. 1 — 24). 60 The essay is an extremely useful survey of the field despite its bias against the Greg-Bowers tradition (shown in such language as the "holy grail of authorial inscription" [p. 12]). Unfortunately the essay does not allow for the coexistence (to say nothing of the mutual enrichment) of multiple historical interests; it therefore ends with the prediction that "the day of the critical, or eclectic, edition . . . has passed or is passing" (p. 23), rather than with a recognition of what such editions can contribute to an understanding of the past. 61 The following year Philip Cohen (who had edited Devils and Angels in 1991) brought out another collection of essays, 62 prefaced by an "updated homily on textual instability" (p. 146); and this piece, even more than Hill's, is a repository of the phrases that have become standard in criticisms of intentionalist editing. He says, for example, that eclectic editing "privileges from the start a final authorial and single-text orientation" (p. 134); that there has been "a paradigm shift" away from the creation of "an eclectic best text that never existed historically" (p. 135); that "Traditional editors" appealed to " a priori Platonic conceptions of text" (p. 140); and that their approach can be linked to "the modernist quest for pure form" and a "reductive or unified notion of authorial intention" (p. 142). That each of these assertions is a distortion should by now be clear to all who have looked at what the editors in question have said, and it is regrettable that Cohen's many effective statements about the implications of textual instability should be mixed with these inaccuracies about the theory of intentionalist editing. In contrast to the many essays that restate in the same clichés the differences between the old and the new textual theories, Morris Eaves has produced a piece that rejoices in textual instability in a genuinely fresh way. His essay for a 1994 anthology entitled Cultural Artifacts and the Production of Meaning: The Page, the Image, and the Body (edited by Margaret J. M. Ezell and Katherine O'Brien O'Keeffe) does not mimic the many recent papers on a socialized approach to texts but instead offers an eloquent argument for the dignity that texts acquire in their public reappearances and reshapings over time. 63 His line of reasoning is linked to Joshua Reynolds's respect for the forms of works that evolve through consensus, for (in Eaves's words) "the process of history, including, at least potentially, the public powers of invention that are only temporarily vested in individual artists" (p. 89). He is thus able to defend the proposition that (in contrast to an editorial view of texts as corrupt) "everything that is, is already right" (p. 85) — or, as he later restates it, "whatever is may be, if not right, then on its way to becoming right" (p. 945). His position rests on "the granting of legitimacy to the audience, and hence to its editorial decisions" (p. 97), which include, in his comprehensive vision, all possible editorial stances. Intentionalist editing by scholars, like every other act of handling a text, fits into the framework, for it is a response by one segment of the audience (which can, "through its editorial representative," return authority "straightaway to the author"). One additional point that Eaves's discussion naturally leads to (though he does not deal with it) is the puzzle of determining what "whatever is" consists of, and the relevance of determining it for anyone interested in history. Reynolds's sanguine belief that what survives is what people wish to survive may possibly be true in the short run, but the long history of textual transmission is full of instances in which lost texts would be eagerly seized and revered in another era. Even in less extreme situations, chance plays its role along with deliberate choice in affecting the forms of texts that are passed along. Nothing can alter what happened, whether or not it was for the best, but readers interested in history (as some scholarly editors are) must recognize the relevance of texts that were no longer extant in physical form at a particular time, as well as those that never existed in physical form. These considerations certainly fit within Eaves's scheme, for they reflect the interests of a portion of an audience, and the products of that interest, which are attempts at reconstructed texts, become available to influence what happens in succeeding generations. Thus when Eaves says that "whatever is may be . . . on its way to becoming right," he recognizes that change may be necessary to produce rightness for a given audience; and his title question, "Why Don't They Leave It Alone?", can only imply a criticism (rather imprecisely) of certain attitudes with which changes are made and does not call into question the activity of making changes, which has always been part of the public accommodation of texts. I mention these points only to clarify the way in which intentionalist editing is encompassed within the ongoing process and to emphasize the fact that the materials of history are not exclusively physical objects. But Eaves cannot be expected to comment on every intricacy of a complex subject, and his argument as it stands is a subtle and sensitive exposition of "the shaping influence of socialization, collaboration, and historical processes" (p. 88). It provides a fitting climax to this survey of anthologies, for it is one of the few pieces in all of them that truly mark an advance in thinking. But the anthology in which it appears will not be the last anthology on textual matters: at least three more are scheduled to appear during the second half of 1995 — one on German and one on French approaches, and one that may well be more important than all the previous ones, D. C. Greetham's Scholarly Editing: A Guide to Research , containing surveys of the textual traditions in some thirty literary fields. 64</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III In addition to the sizable body of writing that appeared in anthologies during the early 1990s, there are of course other noteworthy articles that were published in periodicals. One of them, Ann R. Meyer's 1994 contribution to Studies in Bibliography ("Shakespeare's Art and the Texts of King Lear ," 47: 128 — 146), can serve to focus some of the issues raised by the current concentration on versions and the associated disparagement of eclectic texts. Indeed, it provides a rare model of open-mindedness on this subject. Meyer goes to the heart of recent debates by tackling King Lear , which in the past decade or so has become the classic ground for demonstrating the importance of preserving distinct authorial versions and of refraining from conflating them into eclectic texts. One of the best-known anthologies of the 1980s, The Division of the Kingdoms (edited by Gary Taylor and Michael J. Warren, 1983), set forth the arguments for two versions of Lear , which resulted in the presentation of two separate texts in the 1986 one-volume Oxford Shakespeare. 65 Meyer approaches her independent re-examination of the evidence with the sensible view that "conflation on the one hand and a presentation of different versions on the other are not mutually exclusive alternatives" (p. 130). She recognizes, in other words, that authorial versions cannot be equated with the texts of documents and that, if such versions are what one is interested in, they must be constructed through critical editing. (Early versions are in this respect no different from late or "final" versions.) Armed with this unbiased view of both textual instability and eclectic editing, she finds that — in connection with two key passages — a "judicious consolidation" (p. 145) of the first Quarto and Folio texts is necessary in order to approach an authorially intended text. Her skillfully presented argument begins with two instances where the Quarto readings in the outer forme of sheet G exist in two states, and she shows in each instance that the "corrected state" (Qb) is simply erroneous and that the uncorrected state (Qa) and the Folio reading, though different, derive from a single version and do not reflect separate versions. Thus "crulentious" (Qa) was altered to "tempestious" (Qb) during the printing of the Quarto, but the Folio "contentious" is the word (as paleographical analysis shows) that was originally misread as "crulentious" (leaving "tempestious" as a compositor's guess at correcting the obvious nonsense of "crulentious"). In the other instance, "come on bee true" (Qa) was incompletely altered to "come on" (Qb) in the Quarto at a point where the Folio reads "Come, vnbutton"; here again paleographical analysis indicates that the Folio displays the reading that had been intended all along but was misread by the Quarto compositor. The Oxford editors of the Quarto version, as Meyer notes, do emend "crulentious" with "contentious," but they retain "come on bee true" because it makes (in their words) "local and contextual sense." Meyer criticizes this decision as an example of failing sufficiently to recognize the role of the Folio text in supplying readings that should have been present in the Quarto. One can still argue for two versions if there is other evidence; Meyer is not taking a position on this question but is only showing that eclecticism is necessary in any case. Having established this pattern, she then considers two major differences between the Quarto and Folio texts: the omission in the Folio of the 31-line mock-trial scene, and the considerable substantive variation in the final lines of the play. As to the first, she argues that the omission, without other accompanying changes, leaves many loose ends and thus is difficult to regard as authorial revision. In the second, the peculiarities in the Quarto text result from the compositor's need to compress the passage to make it fit on the recto of the last leaf, since the outer forme (containing the blank verso of that leaf) had already been printed. Even if there are two versions of Lear , therefore, both of them (according to Meyer and in opposition to the view of the 1986 Oxford editors) would have to contain the trial scene from the Quarto and the concluding scene from the Folio. The broad importance of Meyer's article, beyond its significance for the Lear debate, is that it sets forth with great clarity several concrete illustrations of the necessity for eclecticism in intentionalist editing, whether or not distinct versions are involved. This point should be accepted as common sense even when stated in the abstract, without accompanying examples; but the persistence with which writers on textual criticism seem to regard eclecticism as antithetical to an understanding of textual instability suggests that articles like Meyer's are needed and need to be read widely. Although she finds no evidence of Shakespeare's revision in the passages she examines, she is open to the possibility that such evidence exists elsewhere in the play. "My argument," she says, "does not reinforce the concept of a 'definitive' or ideal authoritative text, nor does it contradict the concept of the text as a product of many influences, including the possibility of authorial revision" (p. 131). She simply recognizes that, if one is interested in authorially intended versions, one must be alert to "non-authorial influence" (p. 130) in any documentary text before concluding that its distinctive features point to an authorial version. 66 Choosing readings from different documentary texts, far from mixing versions, may be the only way to isolate them. The idea that versions cannot be identified with the texts of documents is of course based on a particular view of the ontology of literature (that literary works are intangible); and one should not be surprised that the recent interest in textual versions and instability should have been accompanied by attempts to define the nature of verbal works. The essays by McLaverty and Grigely commented on above are two significant instances. But the most ambitious (indeed, rather self-consciously ambitious) effort of this kind is Peter L. Shillingsburg's essay in the 1991 volume of Studies in Bibliography , "Text as Matter, Concept, and Action" (44: 31 — 82). Shillingsburg has been thinking about the relations among works, versions, and documents since the early 1980s and has published a number of illuminating discussions of them. 67 The long 1991 piece, effectively building on this foundation, offers a "taxonomy" or "anatomy" of texts, resulting in a "partial nomenclature" for textual criticism (p. 46). It tries to address the central problem of how intangible and material texts are linked, and it shows that one can recognize the historical existence of "Conceptual Texts" (texts held in the mind) and still be open to the whole range of possible emphases in the study of texts. (And a "Conceptual Text," Shillingsburg explicitly says, is "not a Platonic ideal" [p. 51].) For Shillingsburg, a work is a "literary entity" that is "manifested in and implied by the material and linguistic forms" of all the texts that can be thought of as its versions (p. 81); "the Material Text," in other words, "is not equivalent with the Work but is instead merely a coded representation or sign of the Work" (p. 56). Versions, in turn, are not "facts to be discovered" but rather "concepts created . . . by readers [including editors] as a means of ordering (or as justification for valuing) textual variants" (p. 73). 68 In Shillingsburg's terminology, the text of an "Essayed Version" takes the form of a "Linguistic Text," which can then become a "Material Text" by being displayed (with greater or lesser accuracy) in a document; when a person reads a "Material Text" (often responding to nonlinguistic as well as linguistic features), the result is a "Reception Performance," leading to a "Reception Text." Although these terms (and other related ones I have not mentioned) are cumbersome, especially when combined, the process of explaining them does serve to clarify some of the concepts and relationships that textual and literary critics should understand but frequently have not rigorously explored. 69 Shillingsburg's thoughtful performance is not without its flaws, however. A basic one, in my view, is its fuzziness about how readers' responses relate to the concept of "work." When he says, "it is not the Work itself that is known through the Material Text but the reader's reconstruction of the Work that is known" (p. 58), the idea of "the Work itself" is apparently something associated with the creators or producers of it and inaccessible to its audience. Later, when he says, "the reader becomes the 'functional authority' for the Work and its Versions" (p. 74), the word "functional" perhaps makes this statement consistent with the earlier one; but it occurs in a section entitled "The Reader as Author" (pp. 72 — 74), which also contains this sentence: "The concept of Work and, even more so, the concept of Version depend on Reception Performance just as much as on Creative Performance" (p. 74). And another statement one page later, in the concluding section, goes farther: "the crucial act in relation to a Work of literary art is not writing, or publishing, or editing it, but reading it" (p. 75). There appears to be some indecision reflected in these statements, though the end of the article leaves the impression — quite properly — that "the Work itself" encompasses the reader's, as well as the author's and the publisher's (and other producers'), conceptions of the work. Even so, the matter is not left entirely clear, for the point about the reader having "functional authority" is followed by the opinion that "ideally the reader should have ready access to the evidence that would fully inform his or her decisions," as in "scholarly editions that foreground rather than submerge the evidence for Versions" (p. 74). But to suggest that readers need historical evidence in the exercise of their authority is to assume that they have historical interests and that their function is to "decode a Work" (p. 75) — that is, to solve a puzzle by finding a pre-existing answer. This approach limits the range of "Reception Performances" and thus restricts readers' authority. I think it would be more profitable to state the authority of the reader somewhat differently. To say that readers' authority is "functional" is in fact to say that it is absolute; and it is indeed absolute, in two senses. First, texts, like everything else, can be known only through the perception of observers. Since it is a given of human existence that what seems to be external to the individual can be apprehended only by subjective consciousness, any discussion of readers' responses should take this point for granted and move on from there. Thus a second kind of authority that readers have is that they are free to decide what kind of interest they wish to have in any text, and their interest may or may not be historical. They can respond to a text and its physical setting as an independent entity, or they can experience it in the context of its relation to other texts and other historical information. A comprehensive theory of textuality must encompass both kinds of interests, in all their variety. Another example or two of disappointing features in Shillingsburg's essay may be mentioned. One is his superficial comparison (as it seems to me) of speech acts with what he calls "Write Acts." Usually he finds them so different that "conclusions about speech seem simply inapplicable to writing" (p. 44); but by not referring to oral renditions of literature as speech acts, he neglects some of their similarities (as on pp. 43 — 44, 60 — 61). There are also several false notes in the fifteen pages of introductory comment (devoted in part to characterizing the temper of the times and the recent focus on textual instability and a social approach to texts), such as defining textual criticism in the first paragraph as an activity that concentrates on "removing" error and "purifying" texts, 70 or implying that textual critics have traditionally indulged in "a nostalgic reactionary hope to 're-establish' or 'restore'" texts (p. 35). It is particularly unfortunate that the following sentence appears on the second page, where it can cast a shadow over all that follows: "If textual criticism and scholarly editing are to provide texts and insights that are valuable to literary criticism, they must be conducted in the light of what literary critics find valuable to do." This statement seems to reinforce the old notion that literary criticism and textual criticism are distinct and that the latter is a servant of the former. Shillingsburg himself, both in this essay and in earlier ones, has made clear that he understands editing to be a critical activity; yet he persists here in separating the formulation from the criticism of texts, as when he says that the act of reading has two parts, "the construction of a Reception Text" and "the interpretation of and response to it" (p. 62). 71 In fact the general drift of his essay contradicts such a division (as it should); one wishes he had stated explicitly that every reader (literary critic, editor, or any other) should recognize how intertwined and simultaneous are the construction of meaning and the construction of text. Nevertheless, despite its lapses, Shillingsburg's essay is worth studying; its terminology is perhaps not likely to become widely used, but the discussion itself is an extended piece of analytic argument that contains many perceptive passages. 72 Another scholar who has been turning his attention to "the boundaries and modes of existence of the literary work" (p. 3) is Paul Eggert, who delivered papers relevant to this subject in August and October 1992. The first of them — published second, in the seventh volume of Text (1994) — is "Document and Text: The 'Life' of the Literary Work and the Capacities of Editing" (pp. 1 — 24), which acknowledges the helpfulness of Shillingsburg's essay. And he is like Shillingsburg in the comprehensiveness of his outlook, in the open-mindedness of his recognition that all moments in the history of a work are worth studying as part of the whole. He emphasizes "the readership's participation in the work" (p. 7) and the corollary of that concept, the idea that the "reception of a work is recognized as part of its constitution" (p. 10) and therefore that the boundary of a work encompasses its "continuing life" as successive generations of readers make it over. But he also recognizes that "the initiating inscriptional acts will always be of crucial interest" and that "to ridicule the link between author and work as mystical is making less and less sense" (p. 14). Indeed, he questions "whether the attempts in recent years to clarify editorial principles by polarizing the authorial (Greg/Bowers) as against the sociological (McGannian) approaches have been as helpful as they at first promised to be" (pp. 15 — 16). That he speaks of clarifying "editorial principles" rather than "textual concepts" is indicative of his interest here in the practical consequences of theoretical formulations. Clearly any "polarizing" discussion of the sources of textual authority is not a very direct way to advance understanding; but Eggert's primary concern, in saying that the polarizing has not been particularly helpful, is that the sociological approach has not so far resulted in a method of editing. To set forth "a theory of textual production," as McGann has done, is not to propose "a theory of editing" (p. 16). 73 Basic to such a theory, according to Eggert, is "the distinction between text and document" (p. 17), and thus ontological considerations are integral to the practical task of editing. 74 In contrast to Shillingsburg's elaborate scheme for dealing with the relation of the tangible and the intangible, Eggert's approach is refreshingly simple — but is, I fear, overly simple. For him, it can be "a powerful source of clarification" to distinguish the "document" (or "material object") from the "text" (or "textual meaning"); he thinks of them as two "levels," with the text "raised" from a documentary base. "'Text,' under this dispensation," he says, "requires the socialized reader's engagement in the raising of meaning from the document" (p. 2). This statement turns out to signify less than it first appears to, after one reads the footnote attached to it: Eggert says he is leaving aside the meanings conveyed by type design, layout, paper, binding, and so on and is focusing on "the document considered as the physical inscriptions it bears." Is he therefore only making the commonplace observation that strings of letterforms do not mean anything in themselves and that their linguistic meaning depends on a social convention? The point is of course correct, but how far does it get us? It does not seem to touch the more interesting question of the way in which different readers, all of whom understand how to translate the physical marks into words of a language, attach different meanings to the same documentary text and form different opinions as to which variants (or emendations) are more appropriate. This behavior of readers (including not only editors but authors reading their own work) exists a step beyond the level of recognizing a language. The result of Eggert's "dispensation" is to collapse two stages into the single concept of "text," to no advantage that I can see, and with the disadvantage of being less precise. Eggert complains that McGann's "linguistic text" is "not just there on the page for all to recognize" (p. 2); but in an important sense it is — the page displays a physical "text" made up of inked marks that conform to the notation scheme for a particular language. If we wish to talk about the "recognition" of those marks, we are talking about something very different from the act of reading that builds on the knowledge of what those marks signify. 75 When Eggert — in line with his admirable aim of seeing production and reception as a whole — says that the document is "the tangible link between writer and reader" (p. 11), he is actually presupposing that the marks put there by the writer (or scribe or compositor) follow a system that can be identified by a reader. Eggert is perhaps right to believe (along with many others) that the most fundamental problem in textual criticism is to understand clearly the connection between texts in the mind (whether the writer's or the reader's) and texts on paper; but the way he differentiates them in his concepts of "text" and "document" does not seem likely to promote such clarity. 76 Eggert's other paper (which uses "text" and "document" in the same way) attempts to clarify the nature of literary works by comparing and contrasting them with paintings ("Editing Paintings/Conserving Literature: The Nature of the 'Work,'" Studies in Bibliography , 47 [1994], 65 — 78). It pursues, intelligently but unremarkably, the connections between verbal and visual works, showing that in both cases the work is "a creature of our own conventions" (p. 67), with "no unchanging existential anchor," and that "conservation and scholarly editing must be understood as interpretive rather than scientific or technical activities" (p. 76). Eggert also recognizes the "significant difference" in the two situations: that literary editors, unlike conservators of paintings, need not alter surviving artifacts in the course of carrying out their work. None of this is surprising or questionable; nor is the conclusion (for which the analogy with painting is not actually needed) that scholars editing a literary work are not engaged in "releasing" it but are "participating in its ongoing life" (p. 77). The last paragraph of the piece, however, will raise a question in many readers' minds — an epistemological question that is inherent in much recent theorizing about texts but one that is brought up more explicitly than usual by Eggert's wording. His "phenomenological view of the work" (which "would abandon any belief in the work as an ideal thing") causes one to realize, he says, that theoretical debates are "about our conventions for understanding the work, not something inherent in it — for there is no it , as work of art, independent of our understandings" (p. 77). The last clause (following the dash) is incontestable, and yet it undercuts the rest of the sentence, for it describes a universal condition, applicable to everything. Any reader might be excused for assuming that this point could be taken for granted and that the reason to address any topic — such as the nature of creative works — would be to see what observations could be advanced beyond (or in spite of) the realization of ultimate subjectivity. A more probing treatment of the relation of visual arts to literature (though it ends with a similar quandary) is Joseph Grigely's "Textual Criticism and the Arts: The Problem of Textual Space" ( Text , 7 [1995], 25 — 60). As usual, Grigely is stimulating and well-informed and is refreshing in his choice of illustrations. 77 His account of the visual arts provocatively asserts that one should not equate "the artwork and the art object" (p. 43) and that so-called reproductions of paintings are like editions of verbal texts in extending the "space" occupied by the works: "To speak of the original as being privileged in art has some of the same overtones as championing the author's intention in literature" (pp. 45 — 46). This opinion is inherent in his general position that all texts are "caught in a field of cultural forces" (p. 58) and that "there is no detachable space in which texts manifest themselves" (p. 59); works have no boundaries, for "our perception of the 'work' is an extension of the historical and physical space inhabited by a specific text of that work" (p. 44). Trying to fix boundaries is like "drawing circles in water" (p. 34). This approach equates works with all other events that can have mental repercussions: "the problems of textual space in literature . . . appear in most human contexts — not just the arts, but as a part of human relations in general" (p. 42). One begins to wonder whether such all-inclusiveness is not self-defeating for the essay. Practically everyone understands that the experience of a text, like all other experiences, is colored by one's entire previous life and that it will continue to reverberate in one's mind, affecting all experiences afterward. An essay that says something like this does not mark any advance in thinking, though perhaps to reiterate the point as engagingly as this essay does is its own justification. Yet one cannot help feeling that analytic discourse involves making distinctions; we know that everything is part of human experience, but it may be enlightening to attempt to set boundaries between one kind of experience and another. It is not merely "nominalist" (to use a favorite term of Grigely's) to believe that discriminations can be helpful in developing insights. What Grigely calls for in the concluding pages of his essay is "textual consciousness," and his eloquence makes one eager to promote it; but since texts have not been analytically separated from life, it is hard to know the boundaries of "text" that would allow one to see how "textual consciousness" is different from "consciousness." 78 One might think that philosophers could help literary scholars with these matters, but in general their treatments of such topics as artifacts and texts do not bear directly on the concerns of textual critics, frequently because of their unfamiliarity with the point to which textual critics have already carried the discussion. Mark Heller's The Ontology of Physical Objects: Four-Dimensional Hunks of Matter (1990) takes up a subject that should be of intense interest to all who are concerned with any of the arts (tangible or intangible), for they all make use of physical objects. It is not Heller's purpose to apply his findings to the arts, and the details of his argument will be of limited use to textual scholars; but his general thesis should be borne in mind by all who deal with artifacts. His main point (concisely expressed in his subtitle) is that objects have a fourth dimension, time, and that a physical object should be defined as "the material content of a region of spacetime" (p. 4). 79 The role of time in defining objects has not been absent from textual criticism (the best recent example being McLaverty's essay discussed above), but Heller offers a careful restatement of the point. Less helpful, despite the potential of its topic to be more so, is Gregory Currie's "Work and Text" ( Mind , 100 [1991], 325 — 340). It may be reassuring to learn that a philosopher's technical arguments support the position that works and texts are very different things, but many of Currie's points will sound naïve to textual scholars. His equation of a "definitive text" with the text intended by the author (p. 326) is not in itself the problem (since the particular agent selected is not crucial to the argument); what is more troublesome is his simplistic separation of language and interpretation, as in his concluding discussion, where interpreting a text is stating "the meaning of its constituent words and sentences as they are given by the conventions of the language," and interpreting a work involves "the explication of plot, the limning of characters, the analysis of narrative structure," and so on (p. 338). 80 Two recent books, both sizable, that prove less valuable to textual scholars than their titles suggest are Randall R. Dipert's Artifacts, Art Works, and Agency (1993) and Jorge J. E. Gracia's A Theory of Textuality: The Logic and Epistemology (1995). The former (helpful in placing artistic artifacts in relation to other artifacts) does give some perceptive attention to literary works, but not enough to push beyond what would seem the starting point to most textual scholars; 81 the latter is admirably comprehensive in its approach, but it fails to accommodate some of the complexities that textual scholars deal with all the time, as when it distinguishes "text" and "work" (pp. 59 — 70) without any concept of "version." 82 Another group of writings that contribute little to conceptual thinking about textual criticism consists of those dealing with the "politics" or "rhetoric" of editing. One might at first assume that there is no reason why they should; yet the frequent use of these terms to refer to the subjectivity or the attitudes embedded in editions (as in two anthologies with "Politics" in their titles, the Spadaccini-Talens The Politics of Editing [1992] and Roberta Frank's The Politics of Editing Medieval Texts [1993]) is directly connected with the theoretical emphasis on the social construction of texts, and in this sense the "politics" of editing cannot be seriously discussed without pursuing theoretical matters. But even the most substantial of these pieces, D. C. Greetham's "Politics and Ideology in Current Anglo-American Textual Scholarship" ( Editio , 4 [1990], 1 — 20) does not (and does not attempt to) make a substantive contribution to textual theory; instead it is historical and descriptive, first outlining the professional organization of the field ("the organisational manifestation of ideology" [p. 11]) and then the "challenges" to the "Greg-Bowers ideology" (p. 19). At least it has the value of a convenient overview, 83 but most of the writings on "politics" are much slighter: witness the contributions to a panel discussion, at the 1991 Society for Textual Scholarship conference, on "The Politics of Editing," which dealt with matters of funding, attracting talented scholars to the field, and finding receptive publishers. 84 Anyone who wishes to follow the latest thinking about the nature of texts and the implications of theory for editing, therefore, need not be detained by the discussions of "politics" or, for that matter, by the writings of philosophers. But there remains a core group of essays — the ones commended above, both from anthologies and from journals — that, despite their defects, make genuine contributions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV What can be regarded as a contribution, in any field, is likely to be a different angle of vision, an unaccustomed way of perceiving something. Rarely is an entirely new idea formulated, but old ideas can usefully be given new emphases or be placed in new contexts. The recent dominance of textual instability as a subject for writers on textual criticism is valuable because it directs attention to an aspect of textuality that has not been adequately explored in the past. It has of course been recognized by everyone who has ever thought about texts: the changeability of texts over time is the basic fact that gave rise to such a field as textual criticism and has been the grounding for all editorial activity. But the fact of instability was taken as the starting point, as the essential condition within which one had to work, not as a particular focus of interest in its own right. There has always been an implicit understanding that individual versions are of interest, and this understanding has often taken explicit form in the construction of apparatuses and the publication of facsimiles; but the primary concern of textual scholars before the last few decades was authorial intention, and the primary editorial activity was presenting texts (however arrived at) that reflected authorial intention. Thus the recent interest in the process of textual metamorphosis, along with the emphasis on the value of every one of the myriad forms that texts of works take (however mixed — in many of those forms — are the intentions of authors with the intentions of others), is a most welcome development, throwing a spotlight on an area where it had not previously been directed. Any such development, however, is apt to be accompanied by two kinds of problems. One is that enthusiastic advocacy for the new may involve an unfounded denigration, or an inaccurate characterization, of what went before. The recent writings on textual instability, the social construction of texts, and related ideas have amply demonstrated this point. Given the fact that the new position is characterized by an openness to all the forms of texts produced by the historical process, it is surprising that there has not been more of an inclination to take intentionalist editing in stride as one of the social forces that produce alterations in texts, alterations that are validated by their origin in a social process. But the rhetorical need to discredit the staus quo persists, even though the merits of any new position are logically independent of whether or not an earlier position is flawed. In the case of textual theory at present, the older and the newer views simply concentrate on different parts of a complex process, and both are important in an attempt to understand the whole. If more people are talking about the newer one at present, fashion is not the only explanation, for a neglected topic by definition needs more attention. In the long run such imbalances continually shift; and in the unending process of sifting and winnowing, distortions and oversimplifications come to be recognized. The other kind of problem often associated with new theoretical insights is that they may leave people at a loss to know how to proceed. Although it is no criticism of a theory to say that its practical implications are unclear, people are nevertheless bothered by theories that seem to lead to inactivity or to an impasse. Many of the essays on textual theory in recent years have lurking within them the implication that editing is an impossible, or unnecessary, activity. If all the variant texts that have existed are worthy of attention as the products of social forces and as the inspirations for readers' responses (and this point is clearly valid), then it may seem that there is nothing for editors to do. This feeling of helplessness is analogous to the aporia of deconstructionist readers, faced with words and texts of indeterminate meaning; and this similarity is not surprising, since recent textual theory springs from the same intellectual milieu that produced recent literary theory. Much of that theory is convincing in its own terms, and it frequently does help us to understand a little better what complex events are subsumed in the concepts of "text" and "reading." But whether or not acts of communication can theoretically be consummated, most of the time we behave as if we are not trapped in private prisons of language. Writing to express thoughts, as well as reading to receive them, will continue to be practiced, simply because they are activities that are congenial to the human mind. Reveling in or despairing over the impossibility of succeeding in these activities is also present in some minds, but it can coexist with the practicing of them. Similarly, scholarly editing will continue to exist because it, too, is a natural activity of mind. It is one of the forms of response to texts: of those readers who make public responses to what they have read, some write essays, some give lectures, and others produce editions. The existence, on some occasions, of a gap between what we do and how we theorize about it does not in any way suggest that theory is useless. We could not force ourselves to stop theorizing in any case; but theory does lead to sensitive practice, for the process of thinking issues through on a theoretical level endows our practice with greater self-awareness and thoughtfulness. Editing is the practical side of textual scholarship, and the recent emphasis in textual theory on the importance of versions calls increased attention to a long-recognized practical problem: how best to present texts and textual evidence, particularly in codex form. The concern with versions has international force behind it; in addition to the many discussions in English (from scholars in most of the English-speaking countries), German textual scholars have long concentrated on versions, and the French now have a flourishing school of critique génétique , emphasizing the pre-publication evolution of texts. 85 Much of this work has been practical, in that it has applied the theory of the significance of versions (set forth in a limited number of general treatments) to the textual history of specific writings; but the results have taken the form of essays as often as (probably more often than) of editions. The presentation in codex form of complete texts of versions has always posed difficult problems, both because of the space they take up (and the consequent unwieldiness of the resulting volumes) and because of the inconvenient process they entail for the detection and comparison of variants. For these reasons, nearly every editor in the past has presented only a single text (whether critical or diplomatic) in complete form and has recorded the variant readings from (and other information concerning) all the extant documents in abbreviated form in an apparatus — either incorporated into the single linear text (and identified with symbols) or appended to that text (at the foot of each page or at the end of the volume). Because the codex form forced this kind of compromise on editors, they have discussed endlessly the questions of selection, arrangement, emphasis, and form that the construction of an apparatus poses. Such questions may appear to be entirely practical, but they continually intrude themselves into theoretical discussions, since the compromises they deal with would not be considered compromises if they did not depart from what editors regard as theoretically desirable. The early 1990s have been no exception; a number of the theoretical articles from this period touch on matters of apparatus, and there have continued to be other articles dealing exclusively with the subject. 86 Jo Ann Boydston's "In Praise of Apparatus" is particularly eloquent in its account of how the reading of an apparatus is "a stimulating and highly productive intellectual adventure" (p. 10). Her attitude echoes that of a great many other editors who have produced editions containing single eclectic texts with accompanying apparatus: their presentation, in each edition, of only one text in full does not mean that they fail to see the importance of other versions. Some of the recent critics of eclectic editing have assumed that conventional editions of the past reflect a theoretical belief in the primacy of a single "ideal" text for every work (or for most works). But a more realistic explanation for the kind of presentation given to texts and variants in past editions is the constraints of the codex form. Given the effort that most editors have expended on apparatus and the stress they have habitually laid on the importance of lists of variants for understanding the textual history of a work, it is unreasonable to think that they have not understood the significance of versions as part of the process of experiencing a literary work. In most cases, they would have been delighted by the opportunity to offer readers multiple texts in full, but the physical limitations and economic realities of codex publication precluded doing so. It is true, of course, that the single texts chosen for full presentation by editors (having been forced to make such a choice) do reflect personal judgments as to what will be most useful to most readers. The judgments inevitably involve some mixture of practical and theoretical considerations, but they cannot be assumed to arise from any lack of openness, on theoretical grounds, to multiple texts. At the same time, they may very well signal a belief, on theoretical grounds, in the value of critically constructed (that is, eclectic) texts. Those recent writers who have attributed to intentionalist editors the notion that there is a single ideal text for each work have blurred two separate issues — singleness and ideality. The use of the word "ideal" is itself part of the problem. Sometimes it seems to mean something like "best" or "perfect"; at other times it means "not real" in a physical sense — that is, not extant in a document. The first sense (not often used by critical editors) implies singleness; the second is fully compatible with textual instability. A conviction of the importance of attempting to reconstruct nonextant texts does not entail any concept of the sufficiency or finality of a single text; indeed, critical editors are well aware not only of the lack of finality attaching to any product of critical judgment but also of the fact that any number of past moments (not just the one judged to represent final authorial intention) can be selected for critical reconstruction. Critical editors of the past clearly believed in the importance of critical texts. But their presentation of single texts did not necessarily mean (and in fact was not likely to have meant) that they believed only one text was valid or desirable; it only meant that the option of presenting more texts was not open to them. Technological developments have now made that option feasible, and editors are rightly excited by the possibilities that electronic presentation offers. The capabilities of word-processing and hypertext programs for textual study have already been the subject of a considerable literature, ranging from (to name two works from the early 1990s) the general theoretical treatment of George P. Landow's Hypertext: The Convergence of Contemporary Critical Theory and Technology (1992) to the detailed practical overview of Charles B. Faulhaber's "Textual Criticism in the 21st Century." 87 In a hypertext edition, one can have as many full texts as one wishes, regardless of the length of the work involved, and one can easily switch from a given word in one text to the variant at that point in another text, having the whole context available in each case. The imaging capabilities of this technology, along with the availability of space for multiple texts, means that one can now have, for every variant text of a work, not only a newly keyboarded rendition (searchable for any word) but also a facsimile that shows the original typography or handwriting, lineation, and layout. Indeed, the first requirement of an electronic edition should be that it contain both forms of every text. 88 The result accomplishes what we always wished that printed apparatuses could do, for now we are able immediately to see variants in their verbal and visual contexts. This is not the only requirement that we should have for electronic editions, however. The elimination of space constraints takes care of the problem of the "single" text that was associated with the codex form, but it has nothing to do with the kinds of multiple texts that get presented. Writers on hypertext editions frequently think of the goal as a kind of "archive" limited to documentary texts. The dissemination in this way of manuscript and printed texts surviving from the past is extremely valuable, obviously, just as the publication of documentary editions has always been valuable. But hypertext editions offer great advantages for the presentation of critical texts as well, and one can argue that the potential of the electronic form is not being very fully exploited unless editors' critical reconstructions are included along with documentary texts. Critical texts may be out of favor among many theorists at present, but there will always be scholars and other readers who understand the need for reconstructions of additional historical moments besides those represented in surviving documents. And for such persons, electronic editions offer the possibility of multiple (and linked) critical texts, attempting to show different intentions (those of a publisher, say, as well as those of an author) as they existed at different times. One of the ways that traditional printed critical editions can be faulted is that, whereas the apparatus was used to record the variants in documentary texts, there was no attempt to use it to show what editorial emendations should be made to produce other critical texts besides the one presented as a full reading text. (This criticism has of course not been made by recent theorists, who are likely to believe that even one critical text is too many.) Although critical editors have recognized textual instability as reflected in documents and have understood that any critical texts they offered were the attempted reconstructions of specific past moments and intentions, they still, strangely enough, did not see that critical texts representing other moments and intentions could be presented in an apparatus as efficiently (that is, with as little cost in number of pages) as documentary texts could be. In any case, the availability of electronic space for multiple texts, plus the fact that electronic linking makes bulky quantities of material logistically manageable, 89 means that in the future there is every reason to expect electronic editions to include a wide array of critical texts as well as a generous selection of documentary texts, all presented in full. 90 Even an electronic edition of the kind envisaged here, with images of primary records, newly keyboarded texts of them, and a range of critical texts, would not satisfy some recent theorists, for two reasons: the reader is still removed from the physical objects that originally conveyed the documentary texts, and the reader is dependent upon the subjective reconstructions of a single editor (or series of editors, no matter how numerous). Neither of these points can be denied, but whether they are grounds for complaint is an interesting question because it involves the most fundamental characteristics of editing as a practical undertaking. The first fact that one must confront in thinking about it is that not all readers are interested in history. There is no reason why they should be, if they do not wish to be or if (whether or not they have considered the matter) they are not temperamentally inclined to give any thought to the past. Such readers can respond to the linguistic and design features of the document (whether paper or electronic) that they have in front of them, and how those features compare with the ones presented to past readers of what might be called the same work is quite properly of no concern to them. Scholarly editing, when it is conceived of as an activity oriented toward historical recovery, is irrelevant to their purposes. So, in turn, are most of the theoretical debates, for most of them presuppose a concern with the past. Yet there is a fatal wavering in some of them between a belief that all previous readers' responses to the texts they encountered are valid, because they occurred, and a feeling that readers today and in the future should not be presented with texts that inflict upon them the views of present-day historical or critical editors. Yet contemporary scholarly editions will in the future be regarded as a product of their time and as an influence on the responses of the readers who used them, just as editions from the past are now so regarded. A critical edition from the past is a documentary edition to us; and a critical edition produced now will be a documentary edition to future readers. Whether arguments can be made for or against particular editions is a separate matter from the point that they were thought worth producing by certain people at certain times. The view that all past editions are acceptable because they occurred does not fit very well with the position that some approaches are objectionable because they constitute interpositions between history and readers. Either we are talking about historical approaches to literature, or we are not. If not, then the arguments of theorists that scholarly editing (or any kind of editing, for that matter) creates a barrier to historical discovery and understanding is irrelevant. But if we do wish to be concerned with literature in its historical setting, there is still good reason to believe that recent theoretical arguments critical of scholarly editing are misstated. They do not always say explicitly that there is no future for editing, but the idea is implicit in them: for if all the physical details of documentary artifacts are essential to the historical experience, then facsimile editions are not adequate; and if all documentary wording must be directly encountered by readers, without the intervention of editors' subjective emendations, then editions with critical texts are inappropriate. Each of these points can, however, be stated in a more understanding way; and doing so leads to the conclusion that both kinds of editions are not only inevitable but are desirable and necessary. Of the importance of artifactual details in the historical understanding of texts inscribed or printed on physical objects, there can be no doubt. Whether or not authors or readers in any given instance regard physical characteristics as part of the text, those characteristics do reveal information about the production of the objects, the social milieu of the text, and the bases for readers' responses. Every visual and tactile detail is relevant, and no attempted reproduction can possibly carry the same historical suggestiveness as the object that survives from the time in the past that is the subject of one's interest. 91 But editors have always known this. All editors have recognized that their own experience was richer, as a result of working with primary records, than that of the readers of their editions, who were generally limited to what was presented in those editions. To criticize editors of facsimiles (printed or electronic) for providing derivative forms of artifacts, or to object to the production of facsimiles for distorting history, misses the mark, since editors have always understood that what they offered in facsimiles did not entirely substitute for the originals. They were simply responding to the inescapable fact that most readers do not have access to the originals, nor do they have any realistic expectation of ever seeing them. Facsimiles must, by default, serve as partial substitutes for originals. And when they are accompanied by various aids, such as transcriptions of handwritten texts, physical analyses of the original artifacts, and records of press variants, they provide information not available in the originals. Landmark printed facsimiles like Charlton Hinman's of the Shakespeare First Folio (1968), Michael Warren's of King Lear (1989), and David Vander Meulen's of Pope's 1728 Dunciad (1991) provide extraordinary assistance of this kind to the reader; 92 and electronic facsimiles, like those being produced at the humanities computing centers of the University of Virginia and the British Library, enable readers to magnify at will particular areas of the text pages for detailed examination. None of these can — nor are they intended to — substitute fully for the originals; but even those persons with access to the originals will find them useful. And for other people, facsimiles are a necessary — and indeed a productive — compromise. Another category of dissatisfaction that recent theory has found with editorial activity relates to the production of critical texts. The principal objections are that a critical edition conceals the fact of textual instability by presenting a single "ideal" text and that such a text offers an unhistorical conflation reflecting an editor's subjective judgments about authorial intention. In order to focus on the real issue here, we can immediately eliminate two superficial elements in these objections: the points about single texts and authorial intention. It should be understood by now, as I suggested above, that the offering of single texts is a product not of editors' theories but of the limitations of the codex form; and it should be equally evident that there is nothing tying the idea of critical texts to the concept of authorial intention, simply because such intention was focused on in the days of single-text editions. (Editorial judgment can obviously be applied to the reconstruction of texts intended by anyone.) 93 We are thus left with the basic issue: what is the value of constructing texts that differ from those surviving in physical objects? In most fields of historical inquiry, it is taken for granted that artifacts (with all their contingencies, symbolized by their random survival) must be supplemented by informed attempts at reconstructing past events. But artifacts carrying verbal texts are frequently thought about in a different way, presumably because the presence of such texts on them suggests that they can speak more directly than other artifacts. Yet texts of documents do not necessarily represent in every respect the intentions of any of the persons involved in their production, and those intentions are historical events, even if they never took physical form. Mental events are ultimately the essence of history, as John Searle understands in The Construction of Social Reality (1995), where his argument recognizes that "social reality" — the social structure of conventions and interchanges — depends for its existence on mental and physical reality. The acts of constructing texts and works are social events, as many textual theorists have been telling us; but we are not going as far as we can toward understanding those events if we limit ourselves to surviving objects and exclude from our deliberations the mental events that are a fundamental part of the textual process. Many writers have commented, as Shelley did, on the difference between the idea for a work and the executed forms of the work. Virginia Woolf put it this way: I believe that the main thing in beginning a novel is to feel, not that you can write it, but that it exists on the far side of a gulf, which words can't cross: that its to be pulled through only in a breathless anguish. . . . But a novel, as I say, to be good should seem, before one writes it, something unwriteable but only visible; so that for nine months one lives in despair, and only when one has forgotten what one meant, does the book seem tolerable. I assure you, all my novels were first rate before they were written. 94 The "gulf" that "words can't cross" marks the beginning point for critical editors' activity. No text exists on the "far side"; but as soon as thoughts are "pulled through" and made into words, there is a verbal event that editors can attempt to reconstruct. 95 Woolf speaks of works being "written"; but of course the words were in her mind before they were written, and she may not always have written down the mental text that she intended to write. An editor who tries to recover that mental text is not venturing to the "far side," for the gulf does not divide the intangible from the tangible but rather separates unarticulated thoughts and feelings from groups of words arranged in a particular order. And those groups of words are mental facts first, before they develop into any other kind of fact. These points can be applied to every stage in the history of a work: authors have mental texts of successive versions as well as of initial versions, and compositors and publishers have mental texts before they produce texts in tangible form. The effort to reconstruct such mental texts is like the efforts made in all other historical fields to build up a fuller sense of the past than is provided by artifacts alone. These activities are the natural consequence of recognizing that the artifactual report is always incomplete, both because some of it has been lost and because artifacts do not in any case record everything that happened. Accepting the necessity of critical extrapolation from artifacts still leaves open the question of whether the results should be published. That in effect is the question being answered in the negative by those recent theorists who say that readers should decide for themselves how (or whether) they wish to alter documentary texts. Readers will indeed finally make this determination, but they are not all equally qualified to engage in historical reconstruction, which involves knowledge as well as imagination, and they may wish to have the results of specialists' critical thinking. No one would be likely to claim that historians and literary scholars should not publish essays on the grounds that readers should not be told what to think. Similarly, one can scarcely claim that critical editions (which, like historical essays, are the products of systematic efforts to interpret the past) are objectionable because they inflict particular editors' views on readers. Readers will decide how much or how little they wish to rely on the historical activities of readers who preceded them; but those activities — which include the publishing of essays and editions — are inevitable by-products of the ongoing process by which the human mind struggles to make sense of the hints offered by artifacts. Recent studies of the unstable nature of texts are bound to add to our cumulative sophistication in textual matters, but they cannot change the concept of what editorial work is. Technology will improve the ways in which the results of editorial thinking are presented; but the ingredients that make up such thinking are set by the unalterable disparity between the limitations of artifacts and the insatiability of our interest in the past.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The deficiencies of what is now the stock response to intentionalist editing have occasionally been pointed out. Tim William Machan, for instance, in his review of Paul Eggert's anthology Editing in Australia (1990; discussed below), gives examples of "the factual and logical imprecision" that often accompanies the exorcism of "the deadly, if amorphous, shade" called "Greg-Bowers"; he concludes that "critics ought to try to understand the Greg-Bowers line of thinking before they condemn it, and in the current climate it has become all too easy not to do so" ( Text , 6 [1994], 383 — 386). 2 This is the fifth in a series of articles surveying the period since the middle of the century. The first three, which were originally published in Studies in Bibliography in 1975, 1981, and 1986, were collected in book form as Textual Criticism since Greg: A Chronicle, 1950 — 1985 (1987). (Any reference to these articles in the present piece provides the SB citation first, followed in brackets by the page reference to the 1987 book.) A fourth essay, "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology," covering the last half of the 1980s, appeared in SB , 44 (1991), 83 — 143. The scope of these pieces is the same as that of the present one, focusing on writings of general theoretical significance in English. I have compiled a comprehensive list of such writings (including many from 1990 — 95 not referred to in the present article), distributed by the Modern Language Association's Committee on Scholarly Editions; the latest revision is A Sixth Interim Supplement (1995) to "The Center for Scholarly Editions: An Introductory Statement" (1977) (1995). (Some of my own writings have been a part of the current debates, but it is not my purpose here to comment on, or reply to, discussions of my work; how I would respond will be clear in any case from what I have said below about the writings of others. I have briefly described my own view of what I have tried to accomplish in footnote 3 of "Books, Canons, and the Nature of Dispute," Common Knowledge , 1.1 [Spring 1992], 78 — 91. A collection of my essays was published in 1990 as Textual Criticism and Scholarly Editing .) 3 This breadth is both a strength and a weakness: the inclusion of all these topics in a volume with the words "textual scholarship" in its title makes an important point in itself, by suggesting how interrelated with textual study are all aspects of the history of books; but the attempt to cover so much inevitably results at times in oversimplification and unevenness. For a favorable assessment of the book, see James Thorpe's review in Text , 7 (1994), 543 — 546; less favorable evaluations are offered by John Winter, Elizabeth Morrison, and B. J. McMullin in "Symposium on D. C. Greetham's Textual Scholarship: An Introduction," Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 19 (1995), 47 — 60. 4 It has been reviewed in Analytical &amp; Enumerative Bibliography , n.s. 4 (1990), 129 — 133 (by Rodger L. Tarr); Review , 12 (1990), 69 — 79 (D. C. Greetham); Review of English Studies , n.s. 42 (1991), 431 — 432 (Peter Davison); and Text , 6 (1994), 359 — 365 (James L. W. West III). 5 This volume, edited by Joseph Gibaldi, is an entirely separate volume from the one with the same title edited by him in 1981. The contents of the two are completely distinct and by different authors; for the earlier volume, I wrote the essay on "Textual Scholarship." 6 This volume, scheduled for publication in the fall of 1995, is edited by D. C. Greetham and contains a series of essays describing the history of the editing of many national literatures, including ancient and non-Western writings. My essay incorporates a diagram that aims to show the relationships among the different kinds of editing that are possible. (A still shorter introductory essay of mine is the entry on "Textual Criticism" in The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics , ed. Alex Preminger and T. V. F. Brogan [1993], pp. 1273 — 76.) 7 His death has occasioned some assessments both of his career and of the field during his time: see, for example, my The Life and Work of Fredson Bowers (1993), also printed in SB , 46 (1993), 1 — 154, and the "Fredson Bowers Commemorative Issue" (Second Quarter 1991) of the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin (15: 45 — 104). 8 One of his last articles — "Authorial Intention and Editorial Problems," Text , 5 (1991), 49 — 61 — begins with the statement, "The purpose of this paper is to avoid generalizations on editorial theory." For his last two (posthumously published) articles, see notes 34 and 86 below. 9 A similarly exaggerated statement near the end of the book asserts that the "Greg-Bowers scheme . . . ought to have found room for at least some of the elements of collaborative creativity" (p. 199). Stillinger is not the only person who has recently given evidence of a failure to understand the complexity of the concept of authorial intention as ordinarily used by editors in the Greg-Bowers tradition. For example, Margreta de Grazia and Peter Stallybrass end their 1993 article on "The Materiality of the Shakespearean Text" ( Shakespeare Quarterly , 44: 255 — 283) by saying that "solitary genius . . . is, after all, an impoverished, ghostly thing compared to the complex social practices that shaped, and still shape, the absorbent surface of the Shakespearean text." A concern with authorial intention can seem "impoverished" only if one fails to recognize in it the psychological subtleties (and, indeed, social relationships) inherent in all human events. (This article shows further striking confusion in its linking of "solitary and unitary authorship" with a rejection of multiple versions [see p. 276]. The authors' failure to sort out clearly the issues involved is perhaps foreshadowed on their first page in the tendentiousness of their remarkable choice of the word "resentment" in their description of recent editorial history: "One of the most evident results of the multiple-text issue has been mounting resentment toward the editorial tradition.") Another article that displays an extreme misunderstanding of the motivations and goals of intentionalist editing as usually practiced is Howard Marchitello's "(Dis)embodied Letters and The Merchant of Venice : Writing, Editing, History," ELH , 62 (1995), 237 — 265. Marchitello inaccurately associates intentionality with the "fiction of the wholly autonomous author" and the "production of texts outside or beyond both culture and history" (p. 237); the simplistic view of history implied here is also manifested in his repeated assertions to the effect that "unediting" (or "a theory of radical unediting" [p. 242]) is necessary to "return the text more fully to history" (p. 241; cf. pp. 259, 260). 10 Indeed, an ardent champion of the intentions of single authors, Donald H. Reiman, goes so far as to believe that what authors expected others to do is a part of their intention. In "Public and Private in the Study of Manuscripts," Text , 6 (1994), 49 — 62 (which is a summary of the book based on his 1989 Lyell Lectures, The Study of Modern Manuscripts: Public, Confidential, and Private [1993]), he unequivocally speaks of "the absurd view that the unitary author does not exist" (p. 52). At the same time, he thinks that the vexed distinction between authorial intention and social process will disappear if one recognizes that modern manuscripts were intended only as "way-stations" to published texts, thus sanctioning certain kinds of alterations made in the publication process. But his idea that the concept of "public" manuscripts (that is, manuscripts containing texts intended by their authors for public dissemination) entails the merging of expectation with intention oversimplifies a highly complex matter. It is surprising that Reiman, as a person interested in authors as individuals, would not wish to distinguish what authors personally preferred from what they expected and accepted; my point is not that one is necessarily of more interest than the other but that they are two separate interests, both important as history. When I refer, in the text above, to intentionalist editors recognizing collaborative intention, therefore, I am not thinking primarily of editors who take a position like Reiman's; for it is not necessary to blur the concept of intention, by including expectation, in order to recognize that authorial intention in the strict sense (meaning what an individual author wished to place in the text at each point) can be expected to include outside influences. (For a thoughtful discussion of Reiman's book, see D. C. Greetham, "Getting Personal/Going Public," Review , 17 [1995], 225 — 252.) 11 Parts of which had previously appeared in his article "Multiple Authorship and the Question of Authority," Text , 5 (1991), 282 — 293. 12 My earlier essays in this series (see note 2 above) have repeatedly dealt with these questions, and the arguments need not be repeated here. As examples of Stillinger's simplistic summaries, one might note the following: "Adherents of the Greg-Bowers dogma sometimes appear overly rigid . . . settling the question by general rule rather than by an assessment of particular circumstances" (p. 197); "The wording of the first edition or manuscript could be emended . . . but the punctuation, spelling, capitalization, word-division, and paragraphing would remain those of the first edition or manuscript" (p. 196); "it is not clear to everybody's satisfaction why final versions or latest substantives, merely because they are latest, should be considered more authoritative than any other that carry the writer's authority" (p. 197). Stillinger is not alone, of course, in uttering such distortions. Similar points are made, for instance, by Allan C. Dooley in the final chapter ("Textual Change and Textual Criticism") of his Author and Printer in Victorian England (1992) — a chapter reprinted, in somewhat revised form, as "Varieties of Textual Change in the Victorian Era," Text , 6 (1994), 225 — 247. He asserts that the Greg-Bowers "school" is concerned with "an author's initial intentions": for this "camp," "earlier is always better, whether we are considering revisions of unknown origin or a genuine authorial second version" (p. 171). Not only does this position depend too much, he believes, on "chronology" (p. 173); it also rests on "the romantic concept of inspiration," in which the "artistic impulse can never be adequately realized in words" (p. 171), and it "tends to elevate the textual critic's judgment over the author's in matters of revision" (p. 173). Bizarre as this picture of Greg-Bowers editing is, Dooley goes even farther to compound the confusion. He describes a "rival position" ("which has no agreed-upon name") that favors "an author's final intentions about a text"; and then he sets forth his own view, urging editors to seek "that text which most fully embodies the author's best, most complete, most successful effort to get the work right" (p. 174). What this can possibly mean as a procedural directive (especially in the absence of any reference to emendation) is not clear, and the reader's puzzlement can only increase upon reading that "This approach properly respects an author's proprietary rights over a text, while not necessarily taking all authorial revisions as improvements" (p. 174). Dooley's subject did not require him to comment on editorial matters, and he says in a footnote, "I will forgo any attempt to integrate this chapter's generalizations into current textual theory" (p. 170); his book would have been stronger if he had followed this resolve. His book and Stillinger's are alike in at least one respect: neither calls for discussion of textual theory, and — given the way such discussions turned out — both would have been better off without them. 13 A similar statement appears in Stillinger's later book, Coleridge and Textual Instability: The Multiple Versions of the Major Poems (1994): "author's intentions are in general unrecoverable apart from the texts that authors produce" (p. 135). One should remember, however, that authors may well have produced texts not now extant. 14 The place of criticism in editing is not made clear here in any case. Stillinger continually refers to "interpretation and editing" as two activities (e.g., p. 183) and organizes his final chapter on the basis of this division. A fuller recognition that editing (like all historical scholarship) is itself criticism might have resulted in a less naïve concept of historical "availability." 15 He thinks he is making a valid criticism when he says, "The theorists do not treat facts as if they were speculation, but sometimes they treat speculations as if they were fact" (p. 201). The distinction between fact and speculation, however, is not self-evident; historical inquiry has no choice but to treat speculation as fact, because facts are speculations that informed observers agree to accept until they are persuaded by a contrary argument. (See my "Printing History and Other History," SB , 48 [1995], 269 — 289 [esp. pp. 283 — 286]. I have also commented on the historical nature of critical editing in Libraries, Museums, and Reading [1991], esp. pp. 29 — 31.) Earlier on the same page, Stillinger naïvely contrasts scientific theory with "interpretive and editorial theory" by claiming that the former "is, sooner or later, verifiable." 16 Even the chapters setting forth the case studies are at times marred by such intrusions as the following: at the end of the chapter called "Pound's Waste Land ," we are told that " The Waste Land , if it were perceived to be a jointly authored poem, would inevitably become a lesser work than it is now taken to be" (p. 138). Similarly, the account of the textual history of Sister Carrie would be stronger if it were not tied to a shortsighted criticism of the Pennsylvania edition as "an essentially fanciful construct" (p. 161). 17 I have described and analyzed it in — among other places — SB , 39 (1986), 19 — 27 [127 — 135], and 44 (1991), 99 — 112. (Another of the best-known advocates of a social approach to bibliographical and textual study, D. F. McKenzie, also made a significant statement during the early 1990s: his centenary lecture for the Bibliographical Society, "What's Past Is Prologue": The Bibliographical Society and History of the Book [1993]. I have commented on it in "Printing History and Other History" [see note 15 above], pp. 282 — 283 [note 27], 287 — 288.) 18 It is strange, given McGann's emphasis on this point, that he begins his introduction this way: "Both the practice and the study of human culture comprise a network of symbolic exchanges. Because human beings are not angels, these exchanges always involve material negotiations" (p. 3). 19 McGann claims that the world reflected in his approach "comes into focus when we ask James McLaverty's provocative question: 'If the Mona Lisa is in the Louvre in Paris, where is Hamlet ?' In this world, time, space, and physicality are not the emblem of a fall from grace, but the bounding conditions which turn gracefulness abounding" (p. 9). The question (which is not really McLaverty's, of course, but a cliché of ontological discussions in aesthetics) can be useful if it causes people to recognize that some arts use tangible materials and some do not; the realization that authors' intentions may not be adequately represented in existing physical documents follows as a logical corollary and has nothing to do with a view of the material world as fallen from grace. 20 Such as Fredson Bowers's statement, in his edition of William James, that the apparatus is of "equal ultimate importance" with the main text because it shows "the progress of James's thought from its earliest known beginnings to final publication in journal and book, and continuing to annotation in his private copies" ( Pragmatism [1975], pp. 182 — 183). For further discussion of this point, as well as the way in which the printed forms of texts in pre-electronic days limited the flexibility editors had in presenting multiple texts, see the last pages of the present essay; see also my "Critical Editions, Hypertexts, and Genetic Criticism," forthcoming in a special issue of Romanic Review (86.3) deriving from an April 1994 conference, "From Manuscript to Text: Genetic Criticism and Literary Studies," sponsored by the Institut des Textes et Manuscrits Modernes of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, and the Department of French and Romance Philology, Columbia University. 21 At the end of the book McGann says that his "theory of the radical instability of the material and conceptual 'text'" allows one "to imagine the possibility of reliable knowledge," because knowledge emerges through the study of successive textual engagements, each of which "localizes human temporalities" (pp. 185 — 186). It is surprising that he does not recognize how intended texts fit into this historical process. 22 These essays are grouped in two sections. The first, entitled "The Garden of Forking Paths," consists of four essays: "Theory, Literary Pragmatics, and the Editorial Horizon," from Devils and Angels: Textual Editing and Literary Theory , ed. Philip Cohen (1991), pp. 1 — 21 (where the title is simply "Literary Pragmatics and the Editorial Horizon"); "What Is Critical Editing?", from Text , 5 (1991), 15 — 29; "The Socialization of Texts," from Documentary Editing , 12 (1990), 56 — 61; and "The Textual Condition," from Text , 4 (1988), 29 — 37 (which I have briefly commented on in my 1991 SB piece [see note 2 above], footnote 35). The second section of the book is an extensive case study of Ezra Pound ("Ezra Pound in the Sixth Chamber"), made up of three chapters, the first previously published — "How to Read a Book," Library Chronicle of the University of Texas at Austin , 20 (1990), 13 — 37 (this journal number was also published separately: see the text at note 40 below). Two of these chapters were the subject of commentary in the journal issues in which they originally appeared. Following the 1990 piece in Documentary Editing came Hershel Parker's "A Position Paper on Authorial Intention and the Socialization of Texts" (pp. 62 — 65), in which he laments the absence of what he calls "old-school history" in the social approach, which he feels has neglected "the aesthetic and commercial principles of the participants in the socialization process." And following the 1991 piece in Text came T. H. Howard-Hill's "Theory and Praxis in the Social Approach to Editing" (pp. 31 — 46), which includes a response that many people have felt when confronted with the idea that every edition is validated by history: "if this is true, . . . then it is no longer possible to edit works at all" (p. 41). Among Howard-Hill's concerns is doubt as to how the "bibliographical" (or physical) features of a documentary text (which McGann would not wish to separate from the "linguistic" text) can be "encoded" into an edition, unless facsimile reproduction is used. In "A Response to T. H. Howard-Hill" (pp. 47 — 48), McGann says that "technology is making it possible for us to see (theorize) more of the literary work's signifying dimensions" and to "translate such theoretical knowledge into practical editorial work." Although the question could have been more acutely framed, the response is decidely unhelpful in seeming to claim that technology makes theory possible. (For another criticism of McGann, see note 73 below.) McGann also commented on Rodger L. Tarr's review of The Textual Condition ( Analytical &amp; Enumerative Bibliography , n.s., 7 [1993], 3 — 12) on the two pages following that review. He properly points out that "the emergence of electronic text has provided scholars with a tool for overcoming the limits of the codex" (p. 14); but his opinion that "The theory of copytext editing is a function of the codex" (p. 13) fails to differentiate between the reporting of textual information (which is indeed restricted by the codex form) and the editorial theory brought to bear on the textual situation (which is not so restricted). "Copyright editing" does not prohibit the presentation in full of multiple texts (a point I comment on more fully in the last section of the present article). 23 He does not add to the clarity of his discussion by using "linguistic" to label one of the two strands of an "event" that itself is called "linguistic." 24 This editorial tradition, it should be remembered, is the one that developed analytical bibliography and thus gave great attention to physical clues that reflect production history; but such uses of physical details are of course very different from the uses that McGann is talking about. 25 McGann has devoted a subsequent book to this subject: Black Riders: The Visible Language of Modernism (1993) develops the thesis that "twentieth-century poetry in English is a direct function and expression of the Renaissance of Printing that began in the late nineteenth century" (p. xi). A number of recent studies have explored, in various ways, the role of book design in the production and reception of literature; some examples are David Foxon's Pope and the Early Eighteenth-Century Book Trade (ed. James L. McLaverty, 1991), Tom Conley's The Graphic Unconscious in Early Modern French Writing (1992), Edward A. Levenston's The Stuff of Literature: Physical Aspects of Texts and Their Relation to Literary Meaning (1992), David McKitterick's "Old Faces and New Acquaintances" in Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America , 87 (1993), 163 — 186, Evelyn B. Tribble's Margins and Marginality: The Printed Page in Early Modern England (1993), and the anthology edited by Margaret J. M. Ezell and Katherine O'Brien O'Keeffe (and commented on below), Cultural Artifacts and the Production of Meaning (1994). Joseph Viscomi, in his remarkable Blake and the Idea of the Book (1993), includes a substantial discussion of "Editing Illuminated Books" (pp. 151 — 183), which should not be overlooked by editors of other authors, since it presents a perceptive and reasonable approach to the problems posed by texts that combine the verbal and the visual. (See my review in Nineteenth-Century Literature , 49 [1995], 534 — 537.) 26 McGann uses these adjectives to describe both Fredson Bowers's work and "the formal and thematic hermeneutics that cut a parallel course in interpretive studies" (p. 22). It is a gross misconception of both the Greg-Bowers tradition and the New Criticism to regard them as "ahistorical." 27 These words occur in the description of the first of "three basic choices" for editing Rossetti's The House of Life . The second is to offer diplomatic texts of "a series of versions," and the third is "to construct a text which would represent that textual evolution" (pp. 29 — 30). It is important to recognize, however, that these three choices are really only two: constructing a critical text or recording documentary texts. Whether the latter is handled through the printing of separate texts or the production of a genetic text is a matter of reporting; they are both subcategories of the same basic approach. 28 Studies in Bibliography also takes the form of annual volumes, but they are not exclusively devoted to textual matters. (The German annual Editio is so devoted but rarely includes articles in English.) 29 These figures are based (with necessary adjustments for differences in scope) on the list of anthologies that I included in "A Concise Selection from the Literature of Textual Criticism," which appears as Supplement 4 to my Introduction to Bibliography: Seminar Syllabus (3rd ed., 1994) and as Appendix I to A Sixth Interim Supplement (1995) to "The Center for Scholarly Editions: An Introductory Statement" (1977) (1995). My list may of course not be complete. (For references to some of the French and German anthologies, see note 85 below.) 30 They were Bibliography and Textual Criticism , ed. O M Brack, Jr., and Warner Barnes (1969); Art and Error: Modern Textual Editing , ed. Ronald Gottesman and Scott Bennett (1970); and Medieval Manuscripts and Textual Criticism , ed. Christopher Kleinhenz (1976). During this time a collection of original essays on "Textual Studies in the Novel" appeared under the editorship of Warner Barnes and James T. Cox as a special issue of Studies in the Novel (7 [Fall 1975], 317 — 471). 31 Particularly Literary &amp; Historical Editing , ed. George L. Vogt and John Bush Jones (1981); The Division of the Kingdoms: Shakespeare's Two Versions of "King Lear" , ed. Gary Taylor and Michael Warren (1983); and Textual Criticism and Literary Interpretation , ed. Jerome J. McGann (1985). 32 In Germany and France it has increased, with the inauguration of Editio (1987 — ) and Genesis (1992 — ). Of new periodicals in English, I am aware only of New England Book and Text Studies (1994 — ), written by C. Deirdre Phelps. 33 Charles Rossman edited "A Special Issue on Editing Ulysses " for Studies in the Novel , 22 (Summer 1990), 113 — 269; and William P. Williams edited a "Special Issue on the New Oxford Shakespeare" for Analytical &amp; Enumerative Bibliography , n.s. 4 (1990), 1 — 97. 34 The Davison volume (which celebrates the centenary of The Bibliographical Society in London) includes Sebastian P. Brock's "Developments in Editing Biblical Texts" (pp. 236 — 243), Fredson Bowers's "Notes on Theory and Practice in Editing Texts" (pp. 244 — 257), and John L. Flood and Conor Fahy's "Analytical and Textual Bibliography in Germany and Italy" (pp. 258 — 269), as well as my "Issues in Bibliographical Studies since 1942" (pp. 24 — 36), which contains a section dealing with textual questions. In the Barker volume, Barker himself provides an appendix surveying "Intentionality and Reception Theory" (pp. 195 — 201). 35 This volume is edited by Marianne Børch, Andreas Haarder, and Julia McGrew. Medieval texts were the subject of more entire anthologies in the early 1990s than were the texts of any other period. Others were The Editor and the Text , ed. Philip E. Bennett and Graham A. Runnalls (a 1990 festschrift for A. J. Holden), The Editing of Old English: Papers from the 1990 Manchester Conference , ed. D. G. Scragg and Paul E. Szarmach (1994), and the three named in the next three sentences of the text, plus the Faulhaber-Craddock collection commented on later. A common misunderstanding of recent editorial discussion is reflected in Szarmach's introduction to The Editing of Old English : "the dispute," he says, is "between those who see the possibility for the stable, the fixed, and the unchanging and those who see only process, continuing change, and varying relations of connections" (p. 2). A collection dealing with a different period is Victorian Authors and Their Works: Revision Motivations and Modes , ed. Judith Kennedy (1991). 36 In his fine review of this anthology — in Text , 6 (1994), 398 — 403 — David Yerkes understands that the equation of "textual" and "critical" is simply a manifestation of the role of human thought in constructing what we consider to be reality. "As Housman, following Aristotle, realized," he says, "to be alive is to want to know, even if 'knowing' cannot ever be anything more than mental exercise" (p. 399). 37 Machan, in "Middle English Text Production and Modern Textual Criticism" (pp. 1 — 18), expresses the need for "a more historically sensitive model" (p. 18) than intentionalist editors' concern (influenced by the New Criticism) for "a text to transcend time" p. 9). Hanna, in "Producing Manuscripts and Editions" (pp. 109 — 130), speaks of "the peculiar manner in which textual 'authority' is dispersed within medieval culture" (p. 120), resulting in a "plurality" of texts. 38 A third Toronto volume appeared during this period: Challenges, Projects, Texts: Canadian Editing , ed. John Lennox and Janet M. Patterson (1993). 39 Although I make no attempt below to cite the reviews that these anthologies have received, I do think it important to call attention to the substantial reviews of textual studies and editions that have been appearing in Text since its review section was inaugurated under Peter Shillingsburg in volume 6 (1994). That volume contains reviews of five of the anthologies taken up below (in addition to the review cited in note 36 above): the two 1990 anthologies, the Oliphant-Bradford and the Eggert, are reviewed by W. Speed Hill (pp. 370 — 382) and Tim William Machan (pp. 383 — 386), respectively; and three 1991 collections, edited by Cohen, Bornstein, and Barney, are reviewed by Michael Groden (pp. 366 — 369), Hugh Witemeyer (pp. 391 — 397), and Richard J. Finneran (pp. 387 — 390), respectively. The next volume of Text (volume 7, also dated 1994) contains D. C. Greetham's particularly thorough review (pp. 461 — 477) of another 1991 anthology, that edited by Small and Walsh. 40 This anthology was also made available in 1990 as a special number of the Library Chronicle of the University of Texas (20.1 / 2). The opening paragraph of Carver's introduction asserts that Bowers applied Greg's theory "in ways that seemed to the critic increasingly complex, even arcane" and thereby reinforced the split between the "establishment" and the "interpretation" of texts — a surprising claim in light of Bowers's insistence on the place of critical judgment in editing. Carver also repeats the canard that "the orthodox editorial theory of eclecticism developed under the sign of the New Criticism" (p. 8). 41 McGann's piece, "How to Read a Book" (pp. 13 — 37), was reprinted in his The Textual Condition (1991) and is mentioned in note 22 above; the concept of "radial reading," discussed in that essay, is commented on in my "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology" (see note 2 above), pp. 137 — 138. McLeod's article is "from 'Tranceformations in the Text of Orlando Furioso '" (pp. 61 — 85), and McKenzie's is "Speech-Manuscript-Print" (pp. 87 — 109). Ian Willison's "Editorial Theory and Practice and the History of the Book" (pp. 111 — 125) — which contains the unperceptive remark that as an historian he is "obliged to favor" the socialized view of authorship (p. 113) — is briefly discussed (on the basis of an advance copy) in my "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology" (see note 2 above), p. 130. 42 The titles of these three essays are as follows: Hellinga, "Editing Texts in the First Fifteen Years of Printing" (pp. 127 — 149); Warren, "The Theatricalization of Text: Beckett, Jonson, Shakespeare" (pp. 39 — 59); Gabler, "Textual Studies and Criticism" (pp. 151 — 165). Gabler's essay is also printed as the opening essay (pp. 1 — 17) of Editing in Australia , the anthology to be discussed in the next paragraph. 43 But to repeat: "historical existence" cannot be equated with what survives (or was once present) in physical form; and an eclectic text, though it may draw readings from documents widely separated in time, does not aim at synchrony but instead at the reconstruction of a given moment's intention (one of the successive "products" that make up a "process" — see my discussion of Shillingsburg below). (The title of the essay is "Textual Product or Textual Process: Procedures and Assumptions of Critical Editing" [pp. 19 — 40].) It is also inaccurate to suggest that critical editors have thought of their work as objective (p. 24); they have repeatedly noted that critical editions are products of judgment. (I certainly agree with Eggert's doubts about "the factualness of 'facts'" [p. 26]; see my "Printing History and Other History" [see note 15 above].) I do not wish to detract from the well-deserved praise Eggert accords to Peter Shillingsburg ("Shillingsburg's work has crystallised for a lot of people" an understanding that "the critical edition is indeed critical" [p. 34]) when I say that this point was being made in the 1960s. 44 The volume also includes — among others — a piece by Harold Love on "The Editing of Restoration Scriptorial Satire" (pp. 65 — 84), which should be read by all those interested in genealogical method (see also his 1993 book, Scribal Publication in Seventeenth-Century England ); one by Stephanie Trigg ("Speaking with the Dead," pp. 137 — 149), on the "narrative subjectivity" (p. 139), or "editorial voice" (p. 148), in editions; and one by Jeff Doyle ("McLeoding the Issue: The Printshop and Heywood's Iron Ages ," pp. 150 — 168), which draws on Randall McLeod's bibliographical work to show how "the process of typesetting is . . . a critical reading of the text" p. 165). (Gabler's is briefly discussed above as part of the Oliphant-Bradford collection, in which it also appears.) 45 Later in the volume, Jeff Doyle (see note 44 above) says, "There is no need for the process and production models to be separate" (p. 163). In his case, the point refers specifically to products (like printed editions of the Renaissance) that are not uniform but embody "the layerings of process" in jumbled form. (One could add that his point reinforces the need for historical reconstructions to supplement surviving documents.) 46 Another weakness of the essay (besides its unfortunate title) is its opening paragraph, which is full of questionable statements or implications. To take one of them: the familiar suggestion is made that a goal (such as "establishing what the author wrote") is undesirable because it is "beyond definitive reach"; a person might, Shillingsburg seems to imply, prefer a goal that is "perhaps more attainable." The attainability of a goal has nothing to do with the desirability of pursuing it; and most of the essay, I believe, attests to this point, for the idea of "definitive reach" is similar to that of "stability," and being "beyond definitive reach" is like instability in reflecting the nature of historical complexity. Shillingsburg's essay, in other words, is far more thoughtful and sophisticated than his introductory comments suggest. Occasional remarks scattered through the essay are also disappointing, as when he says that "one of the nice things about scorning historical reconstructions is that there is less work involved" (p. 49). This is an incomprehensible joke in the context, for Shillingsburg's comprehensive approach does not banish historical reconstructions, since it allows for emendations and an interest in intention. 47 The title, Cohen explains in his introduction (p. xvi), is derived from an essay of McGann's that speaks of "the angels of hermeneutics" avoiding the editors who "hurl defiance at the heavens of the interpreters." Those "devils," however, are the ones who have searched for "ideal" texts: Cohen continues the tradition of characterizing the dominant aim of Anglo-American editors as an "ideal text" (p. xi) and of linking their approach with the New Criticism — though the weakness of this association is actually revealed in the process (see the discussion on p. x). One of the reviews this book received — Howard Horwitz's in American Literature , 65 (1993), 198 — 200 — shows how extreme are some of the distorted views of the Greg-Bowers tradition: "This model of editing assumes that a work is an absolutely determinate and determinable object embodying an author's final intention." 48 Howard-Hill, "Variety in Editing and Reading: A Response to McGann and Shillingsburg," pp. 44 — 56. 49 Mailloux, "The Rhetorical Politics of Editing: A Response to Eggert, Greetham, and Cohen and Jackson," pp. 124 — 133; Greetham, "The Manifestation and Accommodation of Theory in Textual Editing," pp. 78 — 102; Cohen and Jackson, "Notes on Emerging Paradigms in Editorial Theory," pp. 103 — 123. 50 Cain, "Making Texts New: A Response to Gabler, McLaverty, and Grigely," pp. 195 — 203; McLaverty, "Issues of Identity and Utterance: An Intentionalist Response to 'Textual Instability,'" pp. 134 — 151; Gabler, "Unsought Encounters," pp. 152 — 166; Grigely, "The Textual Event," pp. 167 — 194. 51 The word "others" here represents a significant (and welcome) addition to the conventional concept of an apparatus; normally an apparatus records only "actual [i.e., documentary] utterances," but the scope is here enlarged to include the emendations that would need to be made in order to produce other intended utterances than the one(s) presented in the reading text(s). 52 Grigely correctly sees the need to distinguish "work" from "text," but there are two problems with his discussion. First, in defining a work (following McGann) as "an ongoing — and infinite — manifestation of textual appearances" (p. 176), he does not sufficiently account for intended texts as part of the sequential process. (He later recognizes performed as well as inscribed texts but still does not relate them to intended texts.) Otherwise the concept of a work as a succession of texts seems appropriate enough; but (and this is the second problem) Grigely does not follow his definition in his ensuing discussion, as when he calls the work of The Tempest "a Platonic form or idea" (p. 176). When, on the next page, he more formally defines a work as "a nontangible idea represented by a sequential series of texts," he has substantially departed from the earlier definition: to call a work an "idea" is very different from (and much less useful than) calling it a succession of texts. 53 Greetham chooses to pursue this interesting topic by a "rereading" of textual criticism "against the grain" of other "theoretical dispensations," specifically in this instance psychoanalytical criticism. This ingenious excursus does not, however, connect directly with what I would see as one of the basic aspects of the topic: how the "ideology" of an edition, as reflected in its apparent patterns of emphasis and subordination, relates to the editor's outlook toward other ideologies. An editor's choice of one approach does not necessarily imply a disapproval of others (and, indeed, an editor may say this explicitly) — a point that needs to be accounted for in any treatment of the "manifestation" of theory in editions. 54 Basic to the German approach, according to Gabler, is the idea of "authorization" that is "document-related" (p. 163). The editor "must present with historical faithfulness" a documentary text and yet can emend "indubitable textual errors" (p. 164). (I am assuming that the spelling "induitable" in this text is such an error and have corrected it in my quotation here.) The incoherence of this approach has been repeatedly pointed out in connection with the "best-text" editing of medieval writings: if one is to undertake critical editing, one cannot be selective in applying critical thinking to a documentary text. Cf. my review of Gabler's edition of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in Common Knowledge , 3.3 (Winter 1994), 164 — 169. 55 It does contain, to my view, occasional lapses, however. For example, there is the implication (pp. 270 — 271) that author-centered theories are more vulnerable to logical criticism than socialized theories because they place the literary work in the author's mind. But the real distinction here is between approaches that focus on documentary texts and those that focus on works; the latter have to posit the mind as the source of authority, but it need not be an author's mind (for authority could also be seen as residing in the minds of a collaborative group or in a reader's mind). Another problem is raised by the statement that "Psychoanalysis, Marxism, and feminism offer three theoretical positions from which human agency and autonomy are strenuously questioned" (p. 276). The implication that intentionalist editing presupposes greater human autonomy than would be consistent with these theories is a misconception; a writer's intention to place certain words in a text is not seen by intentionalist editors as totally isolated from life. 56 Walsh, "Bentley Our Contemporary; or, Editors, Ancient and Modern," pp. 157 — 185; Small, "The Editor as Annotator as Ideal Reader," pp. 186 — 209. Walsh's essay ends with an admonition not "to privilege the critic's quest for significance to himself over the interpreter's quest for author's meaning"; Small's ends by stating that "a concept of authorial intention . . . is more useful — in the sense that it does more work — than any other theory." That these are well-considered conclusions is evident from the knowledgeable discussions that precede them. (The other essays in the volume deal with particular authors but frequently engage theoretical issues sufficiently to make them of interest to scholars in different areas.) 57 Most university press directors would be surprised to hear that "their presses may in the act of constructing and disseminating authoritative texts also legitimate themselves as the places where such texts are constructed and disseminated" (p. 2). 58 Ian Small, in his review of this anthology in English Literature in Transition , 38 (1995), 195 — 203, takes the occasion of Shillingsburg's essay to note that "there is a logical contradiction waiting to ambush the postmodernist editor": if "'works' are constructed by the values and prejudices of the editor" and "'versions' are simply there to be revealed," then there is "no necessary relationship between versions and works," and thus "it is difficult to see why we need to know about versions" and indeed why we should "bother with editions of any kind." He proceeds to make the important point, frequently overlooked, that versions "are not simply 'there' to be revealed" but, like works, "have to be identified" — in a process that "willy-nilly involves values and prejudices." 59 The essays referred to in this paragraph are Greetham's "Editorial and Critical Theory: From Modernism to Postmodernism" (pp. 9 — 28), Shillingsburg's "Polymorphic, Polysemic, Protean, Reliable, Electronic Texts" (pp. 29 — 43), and Williams's "I Shall Be Spoken: Textual Boundaries, Authors, and Intent" (pp. 45 — 66). These essays are drawn from the first section of the volume, entitled "Editorial Theory Today"; Parts 2 and 3, with more specialized essays, are entitled "Editing Literature" and "Editing in Other Disciplines." 60 Hill's essay is a revised version of his contribution to Greetham's Textual Scholarship (see note 6 above), which had not been published at the time. As for the RETS programs of the years mentioned in the subtitle, the one for 1987 is represented by a single lecture instead of the usual program of three or four papers; but the papers from the other years were originally distributed to the Society's members in the form of annual pamphlets made up of photocopies. One of them has been commented on in my "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology" (see note 2 above), footnote 63. 61 The either/or approach emerges at many points, as when Hill says that "genealogical editions betray their origins in early nineteenth-century romantic ideology of the autonomous author/artist whose work derives its value from its unique authorial origins, not its subsequent social distribution" (p. 8). What this sentence betrays (through the "not") is both a belief that these interests cannot be held simultaneously and an unfair attribution of the same rigidity to editors who have produced genealogical editions. 62 This collection, entitled "Textual Scholarship and American Literature," was published as a special issue (20.2) of Resources for American Literary Study . Cohen indicates, in a note to his introduction ("Textual Instability, Literary Studies, and Recent Developments in Textual Scholarship," pp. 133 — 148), that this collection will be incorporated, along with additional essays, into an anthology to be entitled Texts and Textuality . 63 His essay, entitled "'Why Don't They Leave It Alone?': Speculations on the Authority of the Audience in Editorial Theory" (pp. 85 — 99), gets off to a misleading start, for the opening paragraph notes a recent shift "away from the hidebound assumptions and defensive postures that had characterized a small but entrenched Anglo-American editorial establishment"; but, with this gesture out of the way, the essay builds on Eaves's obvious understanding that his position can stand on its own. The same even-handedness that Eaves displays is also apparent in the editors' introduction, where they say, "The material artifact is always resistant to critical appropriation; however, this does not mean that the act of seeking a glimpse of the historical past is without value" (p. 3). Not all the essays in the volume deal with inscribed texts, but some that do are contributed by J. Paul Hunter (on Sterne and Pope), Hamlin Hill (on Mark Twain), Jerome J. McGann (on Pound and other "modern and postmodern poetries"), and Jeanne Holland (on Dickinson). The essays were originally written for a conference on "Textual Technologies: Text, Image, and History" at Texas A &amp; M University on 26 — 29 March 1992. 64 The one on German work, to be part of the Michigan series, is Contemporary German Editorial Theory , ed. Hans Walter Gabler, George Bornstein, and Gillian Borland Pierce; the one on the French approach is the special issue of Romanic Review mentioned in note 20 above; and the Greetham volume is described in note 6 above. 65 I have commented on this situation in SB , 39 (1986), 36 [144], and 44 (1991), 118 — 120. 66 The same general argument would hold, of course, for an interest in any kind of intention, whether authorial or not. Intended versions (regardless of whose intention is being focused on) cannot be equated with documentary texts and therefore must be critically constructed by an eclectic process. A more recent article on the Lear question also concludes that a "refusal to countenance conflation, with reference especially to F's major omissions, is to risk a blinkered and naive reinforcement of changes that may originally have been made to the play for very questionable reasons" (such as the embellishment of Edgar's role for a star performer); see Robert Clare, "'Who is it that can tell me who I am?': The Theory of Authorial Revision between the Quarto and Folio Texts of King Lear ," Library , 6th ser., 17 (1995), 34 — 59 (quotation from p. 59). Another article (though not on Lear ) that defends eclecticism is James L. W. West III, "Fair Copy, Authorial Intention, and 'Versioning,'" Text , 6 (1994), 81 — 89: he believes that editing versions is feasible for short works but not for long ones, and thus for the latter it is necessary to "apply one's critical intelligence to the surviving drafts, with or without an existing fair copy, and attempt to create an eclectic ideal" (p. 88). Leaving aside the inappropriateness of the word "ideal," this statement does not appear to acknowledge that even a single eclectic text represents a version (a particular moment in the history of a work) and that multiple critical texts of different versions would all be, in principle, just as eclectic as that of the (presumably) final authorial version suggested by West. It is a sign of the insidiousness of the tendency to equate versions with documentary texts that even West's article seems to have a trace of it. He distinguishes situations where there is an authorial fair copy from those where there is not; yet operationally there is no difference, since in either case (as West knows) one must use "critical intelligence" and not simply accept a single documentary text. And when he says that the idea of presenting versions assumes "that each embodiment of the text chosen for reproduction possess some measure of finality" (p. 87), there is a hint that the "embodiments" are the versions, whereas versions actually require critical (eclectic) activity for their construction. One of the many examples of failure to accommodate this point is Grace Ioppolo's Revising Shakespeare (1991), in which the chapter on "Revising King Lear and Revising 'Theory'" (pp. 161 — 187) treats as "apparent" the idea that "the conflated physical text is fraudulent because it synthesizes and reduces the multiple versions produced by the author in the process of revision" (p. 162). She asserts unequivocally, "Any edition of King Lear which conflates the Quarto and Folio texts . . . produces . . . a counterfeit and non-Shakespearian foundation upon which only the most limited literary interpretation and meaning can be built" (p. 181). Like a number of the revisionists, she gives the impression that editors who engage in conflation are motivated by the desire to maintain an image of Shakespeare as a writer who never blotted a line; but whether or not he revised is a separate question from whether conflation is necessary to produce what he intended at any given time. Another egregious instance of the problems created by the equation of versions and documentary texts is the section of Jack Stillinger's Coleridge and Textual Instability (1994; see note 13 above) entitled "A Practical Theory of Versions" (pp. 118 — 140). In the "five-point scheme" (p. 132) of his "practical theory," the first point is that "A version of a work is a physically embodied text of the work"; yet the third point is that it is an arbitrary matter to determine how much difference between texts is necessary in order to regard them as separate versions. The two points are at odds: if versions are the texts of documents, then obviously different documents contain different versions. His "practical" approach means that he has "cheerfully ignored" the fact that texts are "physically embodied," believing that words and punctuation can readily be transferred to other embodiments — even though he is thereby ignoring the "knottiest problem in textual theory" (p. 133). Whether or not one wishes to call this a "theory," one can hardly call it "practical," since it is not carefully thought through and is therefore not usable. 67 Especially his Scholarly Editing in the Computer Age (1984; revised, 1986). I have commented on this book in SB , 39 (1986), 39 — 45 [147 — 153]. Another related article of his that appeared in the same year as the one to be discussed below (and can be thought of as a pendant to it) is "Textual Variants, Performance Variants, and the Concept of Work," Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 15 (1991), 60 — 72 (reprinted in Editio , 7 [1993], 221 — 234). He has also, more recently, provided a useful historical sketch and summary of the current theoretical debates, reaching the sensible conclusion that the "anxiety of text is a good and normal anxiety," which is "best relieved, but never cured, by open investigation by critical minds"; see "Textual Angst," LiNQ [ Literature in North Queensland ], 21 (1994), 71 — 93. 68 I have not quoted the definition of "version" from Shillingsburg's appendix of definitions (which provides the definition of "work" quoted in the first half of the preceding sentence) because I do not find the definition there to be stated in a way that is consistent with the discussion in the body of the article. In the appendix, "version" is formally defined as "a concept by which Material Texts . . . are classified as representative" of what he calls "Potential," "Developing," or "Essayed" versions; although the intangibility of versions is recognized here to some extent, this definition does not seem to me to make sufficiently clear that any material text might reflect more than one version and that it is not the material texts as entities that are being classified. Indeed, the definition should, I think, be parallel to that of "work," in order to show the parallelism in the concepts and to make clear that versions are subsets of works. 69 I find some of Shillingsburg's explanations of his terms puzzling, however — indeed, so much so as to constitute a serious weakness in his presentation. For example, he says, "The Essayed Conceptual Text is always manifested in a physical form, but it is not a physical or Material Text, for the Conceptual Text that is Essayed remains (as the author's mental concept) invisible and probably not stable; but the embodiment of the Conceptual Text is visible and fixed in a material medium" (p. 52). If Shillingsburg had written "often" instead of "always" as the sixth word of this sentence, I would see no problem; but as it is, he seems to be claiming that all finished texts in authors' minds get written down or otherwise placed in physical form. Clearly this is not true. Whether or not there is any point in trying to recover a mental text that was not (however imperfectly) "embodied" is a separate matter, and one that should not affect the definition of an "Essayed Conceptual Text." If the definitions of these terms are to promote rigorous thinking, they must cover all theoretical possibilities. The same problem reappears in the appendix of definitions, where "Essayed" is defined as "finished (at least temporarily) versions as evidenced by completed manuscripts or revised texts" (p. 81). But the existence of such versions does not depend on their being "evidenced" in this way. Furthermore, such physical evidence as there is may be a mixture of versions, and Shillingsburg's definition does not guard against the inference that documents preserve versions (something he is generally careful to avoid). (There is further laxity here: the plural "versions" falls under the singular heading "Version," and "manuscripts" is used to mean "manuscript texts," obviously an important distinction in this context.) The related definition of "Conceptual Text" is "Any text that is 'held' in the mind or contemplated by a person. Conceptual texts are the only kind that can be experienced, though Material Texts are where they begin." What Shillingsburg has done here is to limit the definition to the readers' perspective: texts in readers' minds "begin" with the physical texts they read. But if the definition is to cover authors as well (as it should, since "person" includes all persons), it is wrong to say that mental texts "begin" in physical form. A similar tangle lies behind the ambiguous definition of "Linguistic Text": "A Sign Sequence for an Essayed Version displayed in a Document." If the documentary display is essential to the existence of a "Linguistic Text," then the definition would seem to be at odds with that of "Material Text": "The union of Linguistic Text and Document: A Sign Sequence held in a medium of display" — where the "Linguistic Text" is not in itself physical. Yet in the body of the essay we are told (p. 53) that "if there is no Material Text there is no Linguistic Text"; and just before that (p. 52), a "Linguistic Text" is said to exist "first as a Conceptual Text (thought) then as a Semiotic Text (sign), and then as a Material Text (paper and ink or some other physical inscription or production)." But it is not clear why a "Linguistic Text" must be physical if a "Semiotic Text" can be mental. Of course, Shillingsburg can define "Linguistic Text" this way if he wishes, but he seems to have defined it in two different ways. Such elementary blunders are disturbing, especially in a piece that seems in many respects to have been carefully thought out. 70 The full statement is that textual criticism is "the science or art of detecting and removing textual error, the discipline of establishing what the author wrote or final authorial intention, the work of purifying and preserving our cultural heritage." This definition actually limits itself to editing, describing the activities that editors have generally (before the past half-century) thought of themselves as engaging in; but "textual criticism" has usually been regarded as a much broader field — the critical examination of textual histories, whether or not an edited text was the result. Thus one could disapprove of, or not be interested in, the activities enumerated in Shillingsburg's definition and still respect, or have an interest in, the field of textual criticism. 71 In the passage that follows this statement, Shillingsburg pursues — mistakenly, I believe — an analogy with music. Whereas the reader of literature both constructs the "Reception Text" and engages in its interpretation, in the case of music, he says, the orchestra constructs the "Reception Text" and the listener responds to it. But this view oversimplifies the situation. To use Shillingsburg's terms, what the orchestra creates is indeed a "Reception Text," as far as the orchestra is concerned, for that text is the orchestra's interpretation of the printed score. But from the audience's point of view, the orchestra has engaged in a "Production Performance," providing a text to be responded to; what the audience makes of it is then a full-fledged "Reception Performance," involving the construction of both a "Reception Text" and a response. 72 Paul Morgan — in "Text and Authenticity: Examining the Terminology," Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 16 (1992), 141 — 147 — says that Shillingsburg's essay "certainly seems the right direction to take" and suggests the establishment of a standards committee to formulate "a common bibliographic terminology" (p. 147). Another attempt — very brief, in contrast to Shillingsburg's — to define basic terms is Rolf E. Du Rietz's "'Work,' 'Text,' and 'Document' as Bibliographical Concepts: A Short Note," in Mercurius in Trivio: Studi di Bibliografia e di Biblioteconomia per Alfredo Serrai , ed. Maria Cochetti (1993), pp. 65 — 70. Although he does not, unfortunately, deal with the relation of versions to works, he does tackle the immateriality of sequential works by distinguishing (on p. 66) an "ideal text" ("the sequence in a sequential work") from a "natural text" ("the sequence resulting from any attempt to record, reproduce, reconstruct, perform, or communicate a sequential work"). The latter, however, is still, in his view, an abstraction, since the sequence can exist apart from a physical embodiment; and he therefore feels that he must further distinguish (on p. 68) the "text of the document" (the "natural text," a sequence) from the "documentary text" (the "part of a document which consists of the 'material' text"). Since he has previously said that inked letterforms are not part of the text, but rather are part of the document, it is not clear what the "material text" consists of. One understands that he wishes to exclude typography as an intended element of the work; but since it is used to record the intangible sequence of words, I do not see how one can define the "material" text without reference to it. (His use of "ideal" seems to me to raise another problem, since he believes the fact that ideal texts "may be known to us only indirectly" makes them "like Plato's ideas.") 73 Eggert elaborates his thoughtful criticism of McGann in a "Coda" appended to the essay ("A Commentary on The Textual Condition by Jerome McGann," pp. 17 — 24). The heart of the criticism is that McGann, in his emphasis on texts as social events, neglects the role of individuals within that process (and the research that would lead to the determination of individual responsibility). "I fail to see," Eggert says, how McGann can insist on "the necessity of retrieving what he repeatedly calls the 'determinate circumstances'" of textual production, "while edging away from, or blurring with generalities, the most focused form of it — individual agency" (p. 23). 74 I concentrate on this element in Eggert's article because it is the most basic one. The question that he calls the "subject" of the last third of the essay — whether "textual bibliography" "can or should alter its methods to deal with this expanded conception of the work" (p. 10) — is a non-issue. Given the usual definition of "bibliography" to mean the study of physical evidence, it is perhaps not surprising that he should consider "textual bibliography" (if this unfortunate term can really be thought to designate a field that exists) to be "best equipped to deal with the work at the level of documentary inscription" (p. 11). But the evidence of the continuing life of a work and of readers' responses (constituting the "expanded conception of the work") would normally be in physical form also, and bibliography could handle it just as well as it can deal with initial inscription. But textual scholars have to do whatever work is necessary in any case, and it does not matter whether or not the work is called "bibliography." 75 I am not suggesting that Eggert is unaware of this point. He comes close to it in a footnote at the end of his "Coda," where he says, "The persistence of a language held largely in common allows a reading of the document, but the different contexts of writing and reading mean inevitably that the two 'readings' (writer's and reader's) will differ" (p. 24). Even here the act of recognizing a language is not clearly differentiated from the "readings" that follow, and I do not find that he explores the implications of this distinction for his approach. 76 I have tried to emphasize the place where — given only two terms — Eggert has chosen to put the dividing line between them, rather than to criticize the terms themselves, since there can be no "right" way to define the particular words "text" and "document." But I must add that his usage, if adopted, would surely produce further confusion, since "document" is so regularly used to refer to an entire physical object that limiting it to one part of an object, a physical text, forces readers constantly to make a mental adjustment when they come across the word. Besides, all the other features of the object need to be covered by some term; although Eggert is not concerned with them here, they figure prominently in many essays in textual theory, since (as Eggert understands) all of them can play a role in readers' responses. For these reasons, I have preferred to use the phrase "text of a document" (or "linguistic text of a document," when required by the context) to refer to the part of an object that Eggert calls simply "document," so that the word "document" is still available for the object as a whole. Then I would say "text of a work [or version]" to refer to the mental construct in an author's or reader's mind (rather than simply "text"), showing through the parallelism of the phrases that a linguistic sequence can exist both tangibly and intangibly. Not everyone will find these phrases satisfying, of course, but Eggert's terms are less satisfactory. The imprecision of his terms is shown several times in his own essay. In one sentence, for example, he says "material object — or what I prefer to call document" (p. 2), as if "document" stands for the whole object; but in the next sentence the word "document" is followed by the footnote I mentioned earlier, in which he says, "For the purposes of the present discussion I am primarily interested in the document considered as the physical inscriptions it bears." The word "primarily" adds another confusion, since the next sentence begins, without qualification, "I leave aside the other kinds of meaning encoded in the physical nature of the document." And that sentence ends by saying that — when one does wish to pay attention to these other physical features — "the document itself must be 'read' textually" (where "document itself" is the whole object, as again in his footnote 21). Furthermore, to speak of reading physical features "textually" is awkward in light of the special meaning given to "text" (which is itself awkwardly equated on the same page with "textual meaning"). 77 And he rarely engages in reductive dismissals of earlier work. But an exception is this sentence near the end: "The sort of stability editorial theory aspires to is thus undercut by its own activities: it seeks to maintain an author-centered status quo, whereas the author-centered moment never existed as a real event, nor can it" (p. 58). This sentence may set a record for the density of its distortions. But to take up only the most consequential one: the moment when an author is producing a text that seems — at that moment — to be finished is certainly an "author-centered moment" (regardless of the influences on the author's thought) and is certainly "a real event." 78 His definition of textual criticism early in the essay is an appealing proleptic glimpse of his final vision: "a means and a process by which careful observation of textual variations and textual contexts will lead us towards a better understanding of why those variations should exist and what they might mean both for ourselves and for others" (p. 32). But "textual variations and textual contexts" implies a more delimited sense of "text" than is ultimately offered. 79 This formulation of course accommodates instability, since all objects change over time. As Heller notes, it is "only by convention" that we can think of whole stable objects at all (p. 22); an object is not "an enduring spatial hunk of matter" but "a spatiotemporal hunk of matter," the parts of which are constantly changing (p. 4). 80 This division is effectively undercut by the word "usually" in another of his sentences: the meaning of a text, he says, "is not usually got by any act of interpretation" (p. 339). His justification for "usually" is the situation in which one employs "contextual clues" to discover the meaning of a text in an unknown language. But there is slippage here in what "meaning" signifies; this use of context to determine textual meaning is not unlike the resolution of ambiguity, which Currie places within the interpretation of works . His whole analysis would have been helped by a concept of "text of the work," which would allow him to show the role of meaning in constituting wording at the level of work. Early in the article he says that an author's intention to spell correctly leads us to correct the text (p. 326), and this would have been a natural place to introduce the idea of "text of the work," but he does not do so, leaving open the question of the status of the corrected text (and the relation of "texts" to tangible objects). 81 For example, in his discussion of literary works on pages 167 — 171, he does recognize that authors sometimes pay attention to the details of physical production and that readers are not always interested in authorial intention; but he does not develop either point or explore what role physical features can play in studying a literary work. When he says that "one copy of a novel provides as good an access to the artifact/art work as any other" (p. 167), he is not making quite so incautious a statement as one might at first think, if one takes the context into account; what he means is that if the text is as the author intended it to be, then one copy is as good as another. Even so, all the statement accomplishes is to say that literary works are intangible entities (or, in his terms, "abstract artifacts"), and the ensuing discussion does not proceed very far in examining the relation of the "idealized artifact" to the "physical exemplar" (p. 170). 82 This is not the only problem with Gracia's distinction between "text" and "work." He defines "work" as "the meaning of certain texts for which society has developed rules so they fulfill a specific cultural function that renders them works" (p. 68). In defining works as meanings, he does not always avoid the danger of undervaluing the role of form in contributing to the meaning of verbal works. Although he cites the rules for the sonnet form as an example of the socially determined rules that are essential to his definition of "work" ("The meaning of a sonnet is a work because the text adheres to certain rules that are supposed to apply to sonnets" [p. 67]), he then claims that such formal considerations do not apply to "works devoid of artistic and literary quality" (p. 69). He is therefore reduced to claiming that "textual works are the meanings of texts, except in cases where the texts have an artistic dimension, for then the works are the meanings plus whatever elements are essential for the identity of the works in question" (p. 69) — a statement that untenably separates meaning from form and presupposes a firm distinction between literary and nonliterary works. (This may be an appropriate place to call attention to a pair of essays that — although written by a lecturer in English — deal with philosophical concepts: John Winter's "Textual Criticism and Ethics: An Inquiry" and "The Application of Ethics to Textual Criticism," Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand Bulletin , 18 [1994], 187 — 198, and 19 [1995], 31 — 46. Winter's aim, as stated in the second piece, is "to recognize the human qualities of the conditions in which textual critics deal" [p. 42].) 83 Though it is not without its share of questionable statements, such as the anachronistic idea that the "New Bibliography" was named in reaction to the "New Criticism" (p. 2), or the notion that until recently the established bibliographical journals were inhospitable to theory (p. 9), or the suggestion that Gabler's edition of Ulysses is important because "for the first time it subjected a major work of literature written in English to the sort of genetic examination that had hitherto been primarily used on European texts" (p. 16) — a claim that can hardly be defended in view of Hayford and Sealts's 1962 edition of Billy Budd, Sailor (to name an edition with a running genetic text; but one must remember that texts presented in other ways can still reflect "genetic examination"). 84 These contributions, by W. Speed Hill, Mary-Jo Kline, Joel Myerson, David J. Nordloh, and Donald H. Reiman, are gathered under the heading "The Politics of Editing" in Text , 6 (1994), 91 — 132. Myerson's piece ("Editing and Politics") is a revised version of his 1990 presidential address to the Association for Documentary Editing, published as "The Politics of Editing" in Documentary Editing , 13 (1991), 1 — 3. Another paper in this genre delivered at an ADE meeting is W. Speed Hill's "The Editor on the Iceberg: or, Just How Far South Is the Gulf Stream?", Documentary Editing , 12 (1990), 18 — 21. And Gary Taylor spoke on "The Rhetorics of Reaction" at the 1988 Toronto conference (his extended paper was not published until 1994, in Randall McLeod's anthology Crisis in Editing , pp. 19 — 59), where he described textual criticism as "an apology for, or a prolegomenon to, the exercise of power": "Editing exercises power, and it can only be understood by an analysis of power" (p. 19). (Some of the recent detailed studies in the history of editing deal more effectively with the cultural and ideological contexts of specific editions; see, for example, Peter Seary's Lewis Theobald and the Editing of Shakespeare [1990] and Neil Fraistat's "Illegitimate Shelley: Radical Piracy and the Textual Edition as Cultural Performance," PMLA , 109 [1994], 409 — 423.) 85 For some background on the German and French developments, their relation to textual criticism in English, and the few pre-1990 discussions in English, see my "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology" (see note 1 above), pp. 112 — 118. There has been a great deal of activity in textual study in Germany and France during the early 1990s but little discussion of it in English (aside from the forthcoming anthology on German work mentioned in note 64 above). The fullest treatment of the French school is Almuth Grésillon's Éléments de critique génétique: Lire les manuscrits modernes (1994). In addition to the German and French periodicals Editio: Internationales Jahrbuch für Editionswissenschaft (1987 — ) and Genesis: Revue internationale de critique génétique (1992 — ), there have been several anthologies in recent years: Sur la génétique textuelle , ed. D. G. Bevan and P. M. Wetherill (1990); L'Écriture et ses doubles; genèse et variation textuelle , ed. Daniel Ferrer and Jean-Louis Lebrave (1991); Zu Werk und Text: Beiträge zur Textologie , ed. Siegfried Scheibe and Christel Laufer (1991); and Les manuscrits des écrivains , ed. Louis Hay (1993). (Hay was responsible for several earlier anthologies: Avant-texte, texte, aprèstexte [edited with Péter Nagy, 1982], La manuscrit inachevé: écriture, création, communication [1986], La naissance du texte [1989].) 86 Such as Jo Ann Boydston's address quoted in the next paragraph (from Text , 5 [1991], 1 — 13); Clayton J. Delery's "The Subject Presumed to Know: Implied Authority and Editorial Apparatus," Text , 5 (1991), 63 — 80; and Fredson Bowers's "Why Apparatus?", Text , 6 (1994), 11 — 19. (The insistent nature of the subject of apparatus is suggested by the fact that it was on Bowers's mind to the end; his article in the 1994 Text was a paper he had been scheduled to read before the Society for Textual Scholarship on 11 April 1991, the day he died.) Annotation is the subject of such articles as Ann Middleton, "Life in the Margins, or, What's an Annotator to Do?", in New Directions in Textual Studies (see note 40 above), pp. 167 — 183; Patrick S. White, "Black and White and Read All Over: A Meditation on Footnotes," Text , 5 (1991), 81 — 90; Richard Knowles, "Variorum Commentary," Text , 6 (1994), 35 — 47; Ronald Schuchard, "Yeats's Letters, Eliot's Lectures: Toward a New Focus on Annotation," Text , 6 (1994), 287 — 306; and James Woolley, "Annotation: Some Guiding Considerations," East-Central Intelligencer [East-Central/American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies], n.s. 8.1 (January 1994), 11 — 16 (as well as Stephen A. Barney's 1991 anthology, Annotation and Its Texts , commented on above). An example of a theoretical article that includes a discussion of apparatus is D. C. Greetham's "Editorial and Critical Theory: From Modernism to Postmodernism" (see note 59 above), which attempts to defend, in its opening pages, the notion that forms of apparatus are implied by theoretical positions. (For a somewhat different approach, as well as a fuller discussion of apparatus than I have included in the present article, see my "Textual Criticism and Literary Sociology" [see note 2 above], pp. 133 — 140.) Greetham's discussion of the "postmodernist advantages" of "computer hypertext and its myriad permutations" (p. 16) does not keep in focus the distinction between using editions for historical study and using them for nonhistorical reading. 87 This article, from Romance Philology , 45 (1991), 123 — 148, is part of the special issue on the textual criticism of medieval literature that is briefly discussed as an anthology above. Jerome McGann has been an active advocate of hypertext — indeed hypermedia — editions. For a recent outline of his approach, see his "The Complete Writings and Pictures of Dante Gabriel Rosetti: A Hypermedia Research Archive," Text , 7 (1994), 95 — 105. Many of his discussions of the implications of hypermedia have also appeared on the Internet. See also Hypermedia and Literary Studies , ed. Paul Delany and George P. Landow (1991). 88 Including every variant page within an edition, resulting from stop-press alteration or the cancellation and substitution of leaves or gatherings. 89 Although linking is an enormous advance over what had previously been available for locating variants and assessing them in context, there is still a need in electronic editions for lists of variants. The ability immediately to locate a variant in a different text from the one being read at a given moment does not obviate a record that provides an overview of all the differences in all the texts (which can of course be usefully subdivided into categories — that is, coded so that the variants can be retrieved according to various classifications). 90 These ideas about electronic editions — along with the point that genetic study, which regularly limits itself to documentary texts, is in fact usually interested in intended versions — are set forth more fully in my "Critical Editions, Hypertexts, and Genetic Criticism" (see note 20 above). 91 The wording of this sentence rests on my definition of "primary record": "a physical object produced or used at the past moment that is the subject of one's inquiry." This definition appears in my "The Future of Primary Records," forthcoming in volume 58 (1996) of the Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science , ed. Allen Kent. It also underlies the "Statement on the Significance of Primary Records" adopted by the Modern Language Association of America and forthcoming in Profession 95 . 92 All three of these facsimiles have recently been discussed in detailed examinations of the nature of facsimiles: Hinman's and Warren's in Joseph A. Dane's "'Ideal Copy' versus 'Ideal Texts': The Application of Bibliographical Description to Facsimiles," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada , 33.1 (1995), 31 — 50; Vander Meulen's in James McLaverty's "Facsimiles and the Bibliographer: Pope's Dunciad ," Review, 15 (1993), 1 — 15. Dane's piece, as its title suggests, is particularly relevant here, since it links the idea of eclectic editing (said by some to result in "ideal texts") with the production of composite facsimiles (said by some to result in "ideal copies") and thus raises the whole issue of the historical value of eclecticism. 93 In "Editing without a Copy-Text," SB , 47 (1994), 1 — 22, I tried to outline an approach for focusing on whatever set or sets of circumstances one prefers when preparing critical texts. Its rationale was offered as a replacement for Greg's, in two senses: the essay pushes editorial reliance on judgment to its logical conclusion (which Greg — and, indeed, Bowers as well — did not quite reach) by dispensing with the idea of a "copy-text"; and the approach is equally applicable to any editorial emphasis, not simply that of final authorial intention. 94 Letter of 8 September 1928 to Vita Sackville-West, in The Letters of Virginia Woolf , vol. 3 ( A Change of Perspective ), ed. Nigel Nicolson and Joanne Trautmann (1977), pp. 528 — 530. 95 One could, of course, attempt to reconstruct the thoughts before they were "pulled through," if one felt there was enough basis to warrant the attempt; the result, however, would not be a reconstructed text but a description, put into one's own words, of a group of thoughts or feelings.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Descriptive Bibliography and the Victorian Periodical by Maura Ives *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is not customary for descriptive bibliographies to present periodical publications in the same format, or with the same level of detail, that is used for books. The practice of indexing periodical publications is so well established that one would question a bibliography that neglected to present such a record; and yet, while all seem to agree that it is important to establish the history of an author's periodical contributions, few seem to have asked whether it might not also be important to investigate those publications as thoroughly as we investigate books. G. Thomas Tanselle brings up the matter in "The Arrangement of Descriptive Bibliographies," 1 pointing out that bibliographers rarely explain "why they simply list, rather than describe, contributions to periodicals" (25), and suggesting that bibliographers might "write separate descriptive bibliographies of individual periodicals" (26). But although a few scholars have undertaken serious bibliographical study of periodicals (such as Donald Bond's work on the Spectator and William B. Todd's work on the Gentleman's Magazine , the Examiner and the World ), 2 they are exceptions to the rule. The drawbacks of this practice for Victorian writers became apparent to me during my work on a critical edition of George Meredith's short fiction. Although Meredith, like many Victorian authors, frequently published in periodicals, bibliographical studies of Meredith 3 and other Victorian writers routinely present periodical publications in enumerative lists, and sometimes (as often happens in the case of serialized fiction) in a note appended to a description of the book publication. Those few periodical numbers 4 that are described (mostly in bibliographies completed early in the century) usually have special significance; most often they were edited by the author, were found to include material that was not published elsewhere, or were judged to be "booklike" (special issues or annuals). 5 The purpose of this essay, then, is to consider why and how one might create bibliographical descriptions of Victorian periodicals, and in the process, to offer a general reassessment of the distinctions between these publications and nineteenth-century books. I conclude with some suggestions for the identification and bibliographical description of nineteenth-century periodicals which, I hope, will also be useful for the description of serial publications of other eras. Periodicals have long been regarded as bibliographical troublemakers. John Winterich's "The Expansion of an Author Collection," one of the essays included in John Carter's 1934 volume New Paths in Book Collecting , provides an early example of the usual objections: Periodicals, says the bookseller, are not books but mere transitory anthologies whereof the contents are only adventitiously durable, and seldom that; physically they are awkward, fragile wares; they age and tatter out of all conscience; they must be tended as delicately as their aristocratic cousins, the Victorian novels in parts, and as articles of commerce they are not worth a tithe of the bother which their handling necessitates. These shortcomings constitute a damning indictment from the bookseller's side of the wall — and so many collectors are prone to forget that a bookseller earns his livelihood from selling books. (19 — 20) Of course Winterich was not discouraged by the bookseller's complaints (to which I will return later on), but to this day, even the advocates of periodicals are well aware that periodicals present distinct challenges. Take, for instance, the "Preface" to John North's 1989 Waterloo Directory of Scottish Newspapers and Periodicals, 1800 — 1900 : Periodicals bibliography is a much neglected field, for understandable reasons. First, it is massive: periodicals easily outdo monographs in sheer volume of publication. Second, no clear definition of a periodical is generally accepted, and the working definition varies from library to library. Third, any one periodical is likely to change in some of its primary bibliographical elements from issue to issue (title, subtitle, format, editor, publisher, proprietor, frequency, printer, size, etc.) Moreover, periodicals are often considered ephemeral. . . . They are often on poor quality paper, arriving in libraries unbound and in endless irregular succession, so are unwieldy to shelve and catalogue, and are seldom to be found in complete runs, seldom well indexed. They are the nightmares of librarians and bibliographers. (9) Now of course the difficulties of working with Victorian periodicals are exacerbated when one is trying to track down a few thousand different titles, but even the study of a single number of a popular periodical can be complicated by difficulties in locating copies, by extreme diversity in presentation (at the least, issue in wrappers and in bound volume), and by the destruction of valuable information that results from poor and at times negligent handling of fragile material. But we should not forget that these "nightmares" also represent a golden opportunity for research, since even the best-known Victorian periodicals have yet to be studied bibliographically. Thanks to the efforts of the Research Society for Victorian Periodicals, founded in 1969, much of the scholarly groundwork for advanced bibliographical research on Victorian periodicals is already in place. The resources for what librarians refer to as the "bibliographic control" of British periodicals have flourished; American periodicals are not nearly as well charted, but the establishment of a Research Society for American Periodicals in 1990, followed by the debut of American Periodicals: A Journal of History, Criticism and Bibliography in 1991, bodes well. The large scale indexing of nineteenth-century (mostly British) periodicals began as early as 1888, with the first volume of Poole's Index to Periodical Literature (1888 — 1908), followed by the Nineteenth Century Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, 1890 — 1899: With Supplementary Indexing, 1900 — 1922 (1944) and the Wellesley Index to Victorian Periodicals, 1824 — 1900 (1966 — 89). 6 While there is still a tremendous amount of indexing to be done, 7 the even more basic work of enumerating Victorian periodicals is well under way; major accomplishments in this area include the Union List of Victorian Serials (1985) and the ongoing Waterloo series of directories to nineteenth-century periodicals in Great Britain and Ireland (the series includes the Waterloo Directory of Victorian Periodicals, 1824 — 1900 [1976], The Waterloo Directory of Irish Newspapers and Periodicals, 1800 — 1900 [1986], the aforementioned Waterloo Directory of Scottish Newspapers and Periodicals, 1800 — 1900 , and the recently released first series of the Waterloo Directory of English Newspapers and Periodicals 1800 — 1900 [1995], which lists nearly 30,000 titles). The Waterloo Directory of English Newspapers and Periodicals is especially useful because it includes references to secondary sources and locations for some titles. In his 1978 essay "The Bibliographical Control of Periodicals," Scott Bennett took the progress that had been made in the "indexing and . . . inventorying" of Victorian periodicals as an indication that "the next bibliographic horizon for periodicals will involve analytical bibliography and textual criticsm" (50). 8 In 1980, a Manual for the Bibliographical Description of Serials Preliminary Draft was compiled by the late John Palmer and several members of the Research Society for Victorian Periodicals, including Bennett and John North. In a second essay, "Prolegomenon to Serials Bibliography: A Report to the Society," 9 Bennett explains that the Manual was conceived as a first step towards producing "a bibliography of key Victorian serials" (9), and was intended to provide "detailed advice to bibliographers on what data to collect and how to record it," a goal that would demand the creation of "new models of bibliographical description that do justice to the timeliness of periodicals and to the special relations periodical communication establishes between readers and writers" (8). Unfortunately, the Manual did not progress beyond the draft stage; however, its influence can be seen in the later volumes of the Waterloo series, in which one observes a gradual move from treating periodicals as repositories of verbal texts to acknowledging the importance of the periodical itself as a physical object. There is a striking contrast between the earlier Wellesley Index , which entirely omits any description of the periodicals it features, and the Waterloo Directory of English Newspapers and Periodicals , which includes images of the title-pages of over 3000 periodicals and provides some bibliographically relevant information (such as the periodical's dimensions and types of illustrations). The draft of the Manual also offers the perfect point of departure for the descriptive bibliography of Victorian serials. Citing the absence of bibliographical study of periodicals by R. B. McKerrow, Fredson Bowers, and Philip Gaskell, the Manual quotes from Bowers's "Foreword" to Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949): The methods of descriptive bibliography seem to have evolved from a triple purpose: (1) to furnish a detailed, analytical record of the characteristics of a book which would simultaneously serve as a trustworthy source of identification and as a medium to bring an absent book before a reader's eyes; (2) to provide an analytical investigation and an ordered arrangement of these physical facts which would serve as the prerequisite for textual criticism of the books described; (3) to approach both literary and printing or publishing history through the investigation and recording of appropriate details in a related series of books. (Bowers vii) The Manual follows this quotation with the claim that "Provided that for 'book' we read 'serial publication' there can be no better statement of the intentions of this manual" (6). Except, of course, that the Manual was not intended as a guide for descriptive bibliographers but for library catalogers, and as such is primarily concerned with describing the content of the periodical rather than describing its physical elements. 10 The only mandatory physical details included in the Manual's recommendations for description are a measurement of a type page (but no further description of leaves, cover, or binding); a notification of whether the periodical is printed on anything other than "untinted paper"; a notification of any "peculiarity of printing from the letterpress type," including ink in colors other than black and printing methods other than letterpress (such as stereotype or lithography); and notification of the presence of illustrations. In providing these (albeit limited) criteria the Manual opens the door for discussion of how periodicals might be handled in a descriptive bibliography.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Victorian Periodicals and Books: Similarities and Differences Certainly one reason to foster bibliographical study of periodicals is, simply put, that periodicals are more like books than is generally thought, and thus lend themselves to bibliographical analysis in the same ways and for many of the same reasons as books. But descriptive bibliography of Victorian periodicals must rest on a clear understanding of the ways in which periodicals are likely to differ (or not to differ) from books. Overemphasis on ultimately unimportant distinctions has contributed greatly to the relative neglect of periodicals. As John Winterich discovered, periodicals have often been characterized as unlike books, specifically as more ephemeral than books, more collaborative or group-oriented, and less bibliographically complex. Since these assumptions are so firmly entrenched, I will take up each of them in some detail. The main point, however, is this: while to some extent, the first two assumptions (of ephemerality and group-orientation) are correct, they are irrelevant to the question of whether periodicals are appropriate subjects of bibliographical analysis and description. As for the assumption that periodicals are less bibliographically complex than books, it is clear that the opposite is true: periodicals are often more complex, and for that reason demand more rigorous examination than has previously been attempted. Perhaps the most common misconception about periodicals is that they are invariably ephemeral. The first sentences of Margaret Beetham's essay "Towards a Theory of the Periodical as a Publishing Genre" 11 exemplify this way of thinking: Periodicals are among the most ephemeral of printed forms. Read today and rubbish tomorrow, each number of a periodical becomes obsolete as soon as the next comes out. (19) The concept of the ephemeral periodical can be challenged in several ways, depending on the particular kind of ephemerality one has in mind. It is hardly possible to defend the notion of the contents of any periodical becoming "obsolete"; the historical value of periodicals is unquestionable, and there are any number of scholarly uses to which even the most insignificant-seeming article or advertisement might someday be put. As for the physical manifestations of periodical "obsolescence," it is important to remember the wide variation that has existed, and still exists, among serial publications. It is true that publishers and readers understand at least some periodicals to be throwaway publications; evidence for this may be provided by the cheap, even shoddy materials from which some serials are manufactured, though inexpensive materials might only indicate that an item was produced by a small press on a limited budget. If in general periodicals tend not to be as sturdy as hardcover books (especially Victorian periodicals, given the acidity of nineteenth-century papers 12 ), this aspect can be exaggerated, and leaves out any consideration of periodicals printed on higher-quality paper or encased in bindings other than paper wrappers. Further, while it seems obvious that some periodicals were intended for a longer reading life than others, we are forced to generalize about this point in the absence of hard data. One of the important ways that descriptive bibliography could contribute to our understanding of periodicals would be by recording those visual and physical markers that might indicate the relation between a publication's physical characteristics and the fate intended for it by its publishers. Is it always true, as the Manual for Bibliographical Description suggests, that "Double columns, paper wrappers, price one penny suggests a publication intended to be cast aside" while "Octavo in size, two hundred and fifty pages per number, and selling at six shillings almost certainly designates a quarterly, destined to be bound for the shelves of a gentleman's club or his private library" (5)? For our purposes, the most important point is that what makes a piece of print suitable for bibliographical analysis is not the literary merit of its contents or its intended or actual physical life span, but the value of the bibliographical information that might be gained from examining it. The fragility of many Victorian periodicals is only relevant in underscoring the need to describe them, in whatever detail their condition permits, before they are gone forever. It is also commonly held that serials, unlike books, are by nature collaborative; as Brian Aveney explains, Most books strongly reflect one individual's efforts, whether as author, compiler, or editor, and tend to focus on a single topic. Most journals are the products of many hands, and the contents of an issue are usually related more by their syncronicity than by their topicality. The tie of being printed and bound in the same press run is what links articles in a given journal's table of contents. 13 Not all periodicals are "the products of many hands"; many are strongly influenced by their editors, who might also be the primary contributors. But for the sake of argument, we will grant that many periodicals contain the work of multiple writers, who represent a variety of topics and genres. Most descriptive bibliographers share G. T. Tanselle's understanding of bibliography as essentially biographical, 14 which makes it that much harder to understand why so many proceed as if the history of an author's life as a writer is demonstrated only through his or her published books, virtually ignoring the bibliographical details of periodical publications in which a given author is but one of many contributors. A focus on a single author in no way rules out periodical contributions, which have the advantage of providing special insight into the contemporary context of a writer's work. The relevant considerations are time, space, and the bibliographer's particular interests; and with these in mind, one might still discover circumstances that warrant the expansion of author bibliographies to include single numbers of periodicals to which the author contributed; one might even consider descriptive bibliographies devoted exclusively to an author's periodical contributions (an especially attractive project for authors who published serialized fiction). Nor does the popularity of author bibliographies prevent bibliographers from constructing other kinds of bibliographies, among which could be a descriptive bibliography of a periodical run. Such bibliographical studies might be especially useful in the exploration of the concept of the social text. As Jerome McGann reminds us (most notably in A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism [1983]), literary and other texts always "enter general society through the mediation of complex publishing and academic institutions" (121). Descriptive bibliography offers a way of exploring and documenting the visual and physical results of such mediations, one of the most important of which for Victorian writers was the periodical. 15 The final and most damaging assumption about periodicals, that of their relative bibliographical simplicity, is easy to unseat. Scott Bennett complained about this misconception in 1978: The prevailing assumption seems to be that any given copy of a periodical will be bibliographically identical with any other one of the same date. Such an assumption would discredit any book-centered study, but it seems to go unexamined — or worse, unrealized — in periodical studies. Yet most students of periodicals know even now that it is an unsupportable assumption. This writer first discovered it so as a graduate student, when he could not find a copy of J. G. Lockhart's infamous "Chaldee MS" in Blackwoods Magazine , where the bibliographers said it was, because, at first unknowingly, he was looking at a state of the magazine in which the piece had been suppressed and replaced by an innocuous article of no interest (then). 16 Despite information to the contrary, bibliographers and textual critics still seem to believe that the printing history of most periodicals is uncomplicated when compared to that of most books. We do not habitually think of editions of periodicals: whereas books may be reprinted over a number of years, we assume that periodicals are printed only once, in a limited number of identical copies. In actuality periodicals, like books, can exist in multiple editions, and single editions can contain multiple impressions. William B. Todd's study of the Gentleman's Magazine from 1731 through 1754 demonstrates this point for eighteenth-century periodicals. While similar studies have yet to be completed for periodicals of the nineteenth century, there is no reason to think that they will be any less complex. In the "Introduction" to her study of the Household Words office book, 17 Anne Lohrli mentions that "The printed text of Household Words numbers was reproduced on stereotyped plates, copies in addition to those originally issued being printed from the plates as demand warranted" (45). In other words, each number of Household Words may have gone through several impressions, and Lohrli reports several variations within numbers that might provide evidence of a series of printings. 18 Reports of reprintings of Victorian periodicals are actually quite frequent, and further demonstrate the potential for textual as well as other kinds of variation. Victorian printing trade journals carried reports of numbers hurriedly reprinted to meet unexpected demand, as when the Printing Times and Lithographer reported that Harper's Magazine had "endeavoured to reprint back numbers promptly, but the demand has again and again outrun their expectations" (ns 8 [April 15, 1882]: 83); and in an April 1882 number of Harper's Weekly , a "special notice" informed readers that "several numbers and volumes of the Magazine are out of stock" and would be shipped "as soon after July 1, 1882, as they can be printed" (26, no. 1319 [April 1, 1882]: 207). Corrections of errors can, in periodicals as well as books, result in variant states. The matter of copyright could cause particular problems for illustrated periodicals, as the Printing Times and Lithographer reported in March 1882: How careful proprietors and editors of illustrated journals ought to be in ascertaining particulars as to existing copyrights in any pictures before producing them, has received illustration during the past month. Some weeks ago the Pictorial World gave a reproduction of a painting, the subject of which was "Zillah, a Gypsy Maiden." They had overlooked the fact that the copyright belonged to Mr. Arthur Lucas, the print publisher. As soon as they were notified of this, they cancelled the sheet containing the illustration, and offered a public apology, declaring their willingness to make any reasonable pecuniary compensation that Mr. Lucas might claim. (ns 8 [March 15, 1882]: 55 — 56) Of special significance is the tendency for periodicals to correct typographical and other errors in subsequent numbers, or in an errata slip included in the bound volume. The Printing Times and Lithographer made note of one such correction: "The Christian World of the 11th inst. says: — 'Our printers, by the change of one letter, represented us last week stating that the Bishop of Ripon had discarded "garters and apron"; the word should, of course, have been "gaiters"'" ("Printer's Errors," ns 10 (October 15, 1884): 227. The aggregation in volumes of periodical numbers can result in distinct issues and even editions. The Manual for Bibliographical Description of Periodicals designates three patterns of aggregation: "active aggregation, as when a publisher reissues parts in volume form to sell to a new market; semi-active aggregation, as when a publisher issues a title-page and index to subscribers to enable them to convert parts into permanent volumes; and passive aggregation, when the publisher indicates only by the sequence of volume and/or page numbering that one volume has ended and another begun" (67). The category of "active aggregation" should include reprinting as well as reissuing, and to the category of "semi-active aggregation" I would add the practice of selling cloth cases to readers who would then take the collected volume to a local bindery. Advertisements often indicate the variety of forms in which a periodical was offered for sale; for example, Macmillan's Magazine (volume XLIII, November 1880 to April 1881, bound in publisher's case), advertises "volumes I. to XLIII., comprising numbers 1 — 258. Handsomely bound in cloth, price 7s 6d. each"; readers could also buy reading cases for monthly numbers or cases for binding volumes themselves. A new edition can result from a change in the size of a periodical, which might require resetting of earlier numbers so that the volume can be bound. Two such cases were mentioned in The Printing Times in 1873: The Day of Rest and the Home Journal — both excellent periodicals in their respective rôles — were started as folios, but three months' experience was sufficient to induce the conductors to alter them to the conventional shape. The first named has had to reprint all its back numbers in the new form; the second had a serial story in its columns, which has had to be retold in a summary fashion. These are important lessons for future projectors. ("Topics of the Month," 1 [Sept. 1, 1873]: 132 — 133; 132 cited) And important lessons for bibliographers and textual critics as well, who always need to be aware of the difference that can exist between a number as originally published and the number as it appears in a bound volume. The international publication of nineteenth-century periodicals almost guaranteed significant physical and textual variation. The contents of a periodical published in more than one country frequently change, both to accommodate copyright restrictions and to serve the interests of a different readership. The British version of Harper's Magazine is a case in point. As the Printing Times and Lithographer reported in 1880, Messrs. Harper &amp; Brothers, of New York, have arranged for the publication of an English edition of Harper's Magazine simultaneously with the American. . . . Harper's has hitherto been excluded from the English market by reason of its contents being made up to a considerable extent of unauthorized reprints of English copyright works. This difficulty is to be overcome by omitting all such matter for the English edition, and printing a portion of the work in this country. ("New Journals and Press Changes," ns 6 [Nov. 15, 1880]: 276) Some idea of the kinds of changes that might be expected when a British periodical begins United States publication might be gained from comparing the British Strand with its American version, which began publication in January 1891. Frederick Faxon reported a number of differences between the two versions, starting with a change in the date of the American edition. 19 To make up for the time lost in transit from Britain, the wrapper on some American editions was dated a month later (that is, the British October 1891 Strand was dated November for American sales, a practice which continued through 1894). The British Strand for December 1895 (No. 60) followed the British tradition of offering a lengthy and considerably more expensive Christmas number; the American Strand for December 1895 (No. 60) was shortened by nearly 80 pages so that the price would not have to be raised. Other differences in the contents of the two magazines included the omission from the American edition of A. Conan Doyle's Rodney Stone , which was published serially in the British edition for 1896. Leaving aside irrelevant and inaccurate distinctions made between books and periodicals, there remains one valid and crucial difference between the two forms of publication: books sometimes (but not always) exist in a series, but periodicals always exist in a series (or projected series). That is to say, the bibliographically relevant characteristics of the periodical always derive from the ways in which the periodical differs as a publishing genre from books and other printed materials, and the most important factor in differentiating the two genres is the degree of seriality that they display. It is possible for books to be classified as serials; multivolume reference works, monograph series, and other such publications would fit into this category. But books in series generally present no real challenges to current bibliographical protocol, the reason being the much lesser degree to which certain characteristics of the serial are usually manifested in them. Instead of thinking in terms of distinct categories of "book" and "periodical," it is better to think in terms of the whole range of printed materials, within which we find some publications that are issued as individual works, and others that are issued in relation to a series of other printed materials that extends over time. This way of thinking best accommodates the tendency of actual printed texts to blur, or even ignore completely, any rigid categories we might attempt to create for them. As the Manual for Bibliographical Description of Serials explains, "seriality . . . consists in the combination of a number of attributes, not all of which will necessarily be present in every type of serial"; for this reason, the Manual 's definition of seriality attempts to "say what the serial is rather than what is excluded" (16). I would argue that the bibliographer does not even really need to "say what the serial is" (which is why I am not offering my own definition); rather, we need only to establish the degree to which an item maintains — bibliographically speaking — an individualized or a corporate identity, and to take the independence or corporateness of the item into account in the process of analysis and description. Since one of the primary ways in which a serial publication manifests its corporate identity is through temporal markers, most definitions of the periodical place emphasis on its relationship to time. Thus the American National Standard for Periodicals: Format and Arrangement, Z39.1 — 1977 20 defines a periodical as a publication containing articles or other units of writing issued in consecutive parts . . . as a continuous series under the same title, at regular intervals or under other predefined conditions such as a given number of pages, generally more frequently than annually and less frequently than daily , each issue in the series being numbered or dated consecutively. (10; emphasis mine) The emphasis on continuity, consecutive issue, and frequency of issue also occurs in the definition given in the Manual for the Bibliographical Description of Serials : A periodical as we would use the term is a publication designed to be issued at regular or near-regular intervals at least twice a year and not oftener than once a week in a series of numbered and dated installments usually aggregating into volumes, and to be continued indefinitely with the same title, format, and general character. (20; emphasis mine) The effect of the periodical's relationship to time on the process of bibliographical analysis and description is obvious: the bibliographer must seek and record evidence of a periodical's adherence — or intended adherence — to a set timetable of publication. Such evidence would include statements of the volume, number, and date of publication by which each number of the periodical is identified (usually found in several places including the wrapper), as well as explanations of the periodical's timetable of aggregation (that is, an explanation of when volumes begin and end, how many numbers normally are included in each volume, and so on). Of course, volume/number/date statements, as well as statements about aggregation, are no more to be trusted on their own merits than are dates on the title-pages of books; with periodicals, however, dates should be viewed with greater suspicion, since the reader's demand for "timeliness" can tempt the publisher to alter or omit a number's (or a reprint's) actual publication date. What underlies the periodical's adherence to a predictable timetable of publication ("regular" intervals) is the need to establish consistency, that is, to indicate that separately published items are in fact connected to each other. Equally important in the effort to signify the periodical's corporate identity is consistency in the periodical's "title, format, and general character" ( Manual for the Bibliographic Description of Serials [20]). The maintenance of a consistent and easily identifiable format (including wrapper design, size, arrangement of contents, page layout) enables readers to recognize individual numbers as part of the periodical series. Arguably the most effective means of establishing continuity is through a highly stylized wrapper, featuring distinctive typography and illustration that can be repeated from number to number. Wrappers tend to serve multiple purposes, including linking the periodical to the series, announcing the number's particular contents and place in the series, and providing space for advertisements and other text. What this means for the bibliographer is that periodical wrappers, unlike most book bindings, must be compared to the wrappers of other periodicals preceding and following the publication of the number in question, so that the typical design of the series, and variations from it, can be identified. Also, the need to account for the various functions that a particular wrapper design serves will significantly determine how the description is structured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bibliographical Description of Periodicals: Notes on Procedure Before launching fully into a discussion of procedures for bibliographical analysis and description of periodicals, some explanations are in order. First, I offer a very general set of observations, geared primarily towards the description of a single number of a periodical, on the assumption that other bibliographers will modify them according to the particular characteristics of the materials they wish to describe. I advocate the description of numbers for several practical reasons, the primary one being that some analysis and description of numbers is basic to any periodical-based project, no matter how large (i.e., description of an entire run of a given periodical) or small (analysis of typography, illustrations, or other parts of a run or number). It is to be hoped that large projects such as descriptive bibliographies of entire runs of major periodicals will be made feasible and more flexible through the use of technology such as CD-ROM and hypermedia. The CD-ROM version of the Waterloo Directory of English Newspapers and Periodicals, 1800 — 1900 allows users to view digitized images of title pages of some periodicals. One can easily imagine the benefits to be gained from presenting a descriptive bibliography in a similar format, and the even greater benefit of linking bibliographic descriptions to each other and to images (which could include not only title pages of the items described, but illustrations, wrappers, or even entire periodicals or books). 21 Bibliographies of complete periodical runs offer the advantages of presenting each number both as an individual publication and as part of the larger series, and of avoiding the duplication of effort that could result from including full descriptions of periodical numbers in author bibliographies. Indeed, one of the most compelling arguments for creating descriptive bibliographies of literary periodicals is that by so doing, a bibliographer could provide insight into the writing lives of a large number of authors. Bibliographies of periodicals would also be particularly useful to editors of texts that were first published in periodicals. But while literary and biographical considerations may be foremost in the minds of many readers, the act of establishing the bibliographical histories of individual periodical numbers carries a larger significance. The simple fact that a periodical number might have a life of its own is generally ignored, and since any investigation of a number necessarily involves placing it in the context of the rest of the series, studies of even a single number shed light both on that individual publication and on the other members of the series. Therefore, while it is enjoyable to contemplate the possibility of large-scale work on periodicals, it is also important to realize that any bibliographical work on periodicals, however limited in scope, is welcome and needed. Along these lines, it is important to consider whether author bibliographies might attempt to render periodicals in greater detail. Since the bibliographer's task always includes determining the kind and amount of information to include in a description, it is reasonable to ask that the process of compiling an author bibliography should include a careful consideration of how the author's periodical contributions should be represented. 22 Of course, if reliable descriptive bibliographies of the relevant periodicals existed, no one would expect an author bibliography to do more than make note of the fact; at present, however, one hardly expects author bibliographies to make up for the absence of periodical bibliographies. It is all too easy to imagine situations in which full treatment of an author's periodical contributions would leave no room for descriptions of any other materials. But if an author served as the editor of a periodical, or as a primary contributor to one or more periodical numbers that are not likely to be covered in other author bibliographies or in a periodical bibliography, an expanded treatment within the author bibliography may be justified. A range of possibilities exists between the brief citation that is usually presented, and the full description that almost never appears. For example, a bibliographer may wish to establish the context for an author's contribution to a certain periodical number; one way to accomplish this goal would be to present a full list of contents, but the goal might also be met by mentioning the items that precede and follow the author's contribution, or by noting some other contents that are especially relevant. This point is that each author presents a unique publishing history, and that the bibliographer's decisions about the treatment of periodicals must reflect the particular circumstances of the author's career as well as the bibliographer's own interests and goals. My comments are based on trial descriptions of a number of single numbers and bound volumes of Victorian periodicals; most of my work was done in the Newberry Library. 23 Unfortunately, I have rarely been able to secure multiple copies of any number or bound volume. I have, however, been able to work with a variety of periodicals and thus to identify the main ways in which the collection and presentation of bibliographical data for periodicals differs from that of books. What I offer, then, is a general discussion of the special considerations that come into play in the process of analyzing and describing a periodical number, followed by a partial description of one number of The Broadway . It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the elements of bibliographical description as developed in Bowers's Principles and in the work of other scholars such as G. T. Tanselle (whose "A Sample Bibliographical Description With Commentary" is especially useful both as a model of bibliographical practice and a guide to previous scholarship). Because Victorian periodicals are in many ways similar to Victorian books, the procedures articulated by Bowers, Tanselle and others often do not require modifications when applied to periodicals; it is to be understood, then, that one proceeds as one would with a book except in the matters discussed below. General Considerations One important way in which the description of a periodical will differ from that of a book is that it will have to recognize, both conceptually and structurally, that periodicals have a kind of dual existence that most books do not have. Whereas a book is almost always a self-contained publishing unit, a periodical exists both as a self-contained unit (the individual number) and as part of a larger unit (the entire run of the series, described by Scott Bennett as "a single entity that happens to be spread over time" 24 ). This problem is not an entirely unfamiliar one, because books published in parts or as volumes in collected editions or in series also have this kind of dual existence. However, descriptions of such books tend to place their emphasis on the larger context, giving a full description of one "representative" volume in the set or series, and briefly indicating the ways in which individual volumes differ — a practice that tends to distort the history of the individual volumes by forcing them into a framework that emphasizes similarity and glosses over differences. The limitations of this approach make it as unsuitable for periodicals as it is for books in series. A description of a periodical will misrepresent its subject if it fails to give full consideration to both the periodical's individual and its corporate nature. Since the individual existence of the periodical number is the aspect that has been most often overlooked, it is especially important that the separate issues, impressions, and editions of individual numbers be carefully delineated, just as they would be in a bibliographical description of a book. In most cases it will be necessary and logical to organize the description according to the smallest publishing unit — the daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly number — tracing the subsequent history of the unit in its larger amalgamations, such as the bound volume. Even so, there are several reasons why the bibliographer's range of study must extend beyond the single number, even if (especially if) only one number is being described. Periodical numbers do not exist by themselves, but as part of a larger series of publications, and so the number's relation to that larger body must be indicated in the description. Also, as the foregoing discussion has indicated, important information about individual numbers is likely to appear in subsequent numbers, in errata slips, and in tables of contents and indexes. The need to account for the periodical's dual citizenship will require the bibliographer to present more information than is customary in book descriptions. The body of the description will also be likely to contain more information than is usually the case. Periodicals, by their very nature, simply tend to present a great many bibliographical details; this is especially true of periodicals that contain numerous small articles per page or are copiously illustrated. Anyone contemplating bibliographical work on periodicals will have to come to terms, perhaps in new ways, with the old problem of how much detail can and should be included in a description. Introductory Notes The contents of the notes will vary depending upon the scope of the bibliographer's efforts. In most cases, whether the bibliographer is describing all the numbers of a particular periodical or a single number, the note will discuss the general features of the periodical run and indicate the relationship of the number(s) to the established practices of the periodical series. The note will provide information such as: 1) frequency of publication (quarterly, monthly, weekly?) and time-table of aggregation into volumes 2) existence of supplements, annual indexes, or other additions to the regular printing schedule of the periodical run 3) typical number of pages and collation formula 4) typical organization of contents 5) frequency and kinds of illustrations 6) form(s) of distribution, price 7) editor(s) In cases where only an individual number is described, the note will be oriented towards the individual features of the number, but will still contain sufficient information about the periodical run to place the number in its larger context. Among the important external sources of information for the publication history of periodicals are prospectuses, announcements in newspapers and periodicals, and reviews. These materials can be especially useful in determining the status of periodicals that exist in only one or two numbers, or in other ways are difficult to identify as serial publications. References in Victorian printing journals point to additional methods of publicizing periodicals, including the distribution of placards, show cards, 25 and tables of contents. Some insight into the importance and the distribution of promotional materials can be gathered from comments in the Printing Times and Lithographer : The newsvendors are grumbling about the distribution of show cards, contents, bills, and prospectuses by the wholesale agents. In many cases they get no share of these, or a share altogether inadequate to their needs. It is impossible in most cases to sell a new periodical without a placard, and even well-established ones require the aid of a publicity of this kind. ("The News-vendor," 1.8 [August 1, 1873]: 122 — 123; quotation from 123) Another reference in the Printing Times and Lithographer suggests the extremes to which Victorian publishers would go to promote a new periodical: A singular "advertising medium" has been adopted by the proprietor of One and All . A van is driven round the City filled with men in scarlet coats, on whose backs are large letters forming altogether the title of the publication. ("Jottings: English, Colonial, &amp; Foreign," ns 5 [July 15, 1879]: 151) These references indicate the value of scanning trade journals for information about a periodical's promotional materials and methods, as well as the importance of including such information in the introduction. Determination of Edition, Impression, Issue and State As I have already indicated, the terms "edition," "impression," "issue," and "state" apply to numbers of periodicals just as they apply to books. Care should of course be taken to avoid any possible confusion that might arise from using the term "issue" to refer to numbers of periodicals. It is reasonable to assume that many nineteenth-century periodicals will exist in several forms, each of which represents a distinct publishing unit. A complication arises, however, when one attempts to determine the bibliographical status of the same setting of type as it appears in an individual number of the periodical, and as it appears, along with other numbers, in a volume manufactured and sold by the publisher. A number presented in different wrappers (as is the case when the same sheets are distributed in Britain and the United States) is easily recognizable as comprising different issues of the same printed matter. But when the periodical number appears along with several other numbers in a cloth case, some additional considerations apply. The numbers that make up a bound volume may each have their own printing history; a bound volume may thus represent an additional issue of one number, and a new edition of another, so that there is no one way to categorize the volume as a whole. 26 The treatment of volumes will thus vary depending upon whether the bibliographer's interest is in a single number (in which case one would not have to be overly concerned with the status of other parts of the bound volume in which the number appears), in several or all of the periodical's numbers, or in the collection of numbers that resulted from active aggregation. When one is concerned with a single number that was presented by the publisher both in wrappers and in a bound volume, the latter version could be designated "issue in volume" as long as the text of the number in both circumstances (wrappers and bound) derives from the same setting and impression of type. If, however, one's focus is not limited to individual numbers but extends to the volume publication itself, the term "volume issue" could be used to designate the new publication of a group of numbers, the various histories of which can still form part of the volume's description. Thus the terms used by the bibliographer will vary, depending on whether the history of numbers (including their history as component parts of volumes) or the history of volumes (with more or less emphasis on the prior history of individual numbers) is of primary concern. A similar situation exists regarding the application of "edition" and "impression" to bound volumes. If the bibliographer's unit of study is the individual number, it seems reasonable that the determination of edition/impression would be made solely on the basis of the history of that number; therefore, a volume might contain the first edition, second impression of the December number, the second edition of the January number, etc. The volume itself then is not represented as a new edition, but as a collection of smaller units, each of which has its own bibliographical status. Of course, if the volume as a whole has been reset, there is no question as to its status as a new edition of all numbers. The treatment of the volume always presupposes that the bibliographer will distinguish between bound volumes issued by the publisher as a publishing unit (active aggregation), and bound volumes collected and bound by other parties (semi-active and passive aggregation). The first instance results in a new publication, for which the bibliographer can establish the ideal copy produced by the publisher and printer. There can be no reconstruction of ideal copy in the second instance because the volume is the result of changes made after the original printing and sale by agents other than the printer and publisher. If the publisher made cloth cases available to subscribers the fact should be noted, and the cases described as a matter of interest in the general history of the periodical, but in no circumstance would the bound volumes be included in the bibliographical history of the periodical, though they may of course be studied and described for other purposes. Volume title-pages and indexes issued separately (as distinguished from those included in a publisher's binding) are also not part of ideal copy, and do not form part of the description proper. Title-Page Transcription, Title-Page Substitutes, and Contents Some periodicals include a page that is virtually identical to the title-pages found in books, and whenever such a page is present it should be treated just as one would treat the title-page in a book. 27 Bound volumes may include a volume title-page along with the title-pages of the individual numbers. Printing information on the volume title-page should be checked against information on the wrappers of the bound numbers or elsewhere in the volume to determine whether the title-page and the numbers were produced by different printers (this may help establish the pattern of aggregation). For many periodicals, there is no title-page: the title, date, and other publishing information is either given at the top of the first page of text, or else the wrapper is essentially the title-page (as is sometimes the case with books; see Bowers, Principles , 415). It is also common for publishing information to be provided in several locations in the periodical, since the wrapper is subject to damage or removal. Even if a title-page is present, it may not contain certain publishing information specific to periodicals, such as statements indicating frequency of issue, location of the number in the series (volume/number/date statement), postal classification, and information about forms of distribution, such as subscription; this information will appear somewhere in the periodical (most likely in the masthead 28 or on the wrapper), and must be recorded. In the absence of a title-page, the bibliographer might want to follow the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR2) list of serial "title-page substitutes" which are (in order of preference): "the cover, caption, masthead, editorial pages, colophon, [and] other pages" (249). 29 In most cases, even when a title-page is present, the bibliographical description will feature a set of transcriptions including the masthead and head-title (if present), as well as descriptions of associated type ornaments and other decorative printed material. Regardless of the presence of the title-page, masthead, or head-title, the number's wrapper should be closely examined; the front cover and spine should be transcribed, and other parts described in accordance with the bibliography's level of detail and the nature of the information that the wrapper contains. Because the wrapper can serve multiple purposes it may be described in more than one section of the bibliography. A periodical wrapper can include integral parts of the text of the periodical, such as tables of contents and even short essays, as well as other matter such as advertisements. It may be difficult to establish whether the contents of the wrapper were determined by the publishers as part of the periodical's publishing unit (in which case it is analogous to a publisher's binding) and the extent to which it is an independent product of the printer (in which case it is analogous to advertisements not part of the sheets of a printed book). Given this ambiguity, in some cases the wrapper may be handled in the section on binding, while in cases where the wrapper clearly functions as a title-page substitute or extension or contains other information integral to the contents of the periodical, it is best either to handle the wrapper as part of the periodical's contents or to place it in a separate section of the description. As a rule of thumb, if it is clear that the sheets and the wrapper were printed separately (as might be indicated by differences in paper), the most logical way to handle them in a description will be to keep the contents of the sheets of the periodical and the wrapper separate, even if the wrapper contains part of the text of the periodical. Some cases might warrant the division of the contents section of the description into two parts (wrapper and sheets); otherwise, only the contents of the sheets are handled in the contents section. Contents The contents section will sometimes include a listing of the contents of the periodical's advertisement section. Often one or more gatherings of advertisements are printed and bound with the number or bound volumes, and headed with the title of the periodical and the word "advertiser"; such gatherings may precede or follow the text. The distinction between the advertisements and the rest of the periodical's contents was sometimes deliberately blurred, provoking complaints such as the following in the Printing Times : We protest against the extent to which advertiser's bills are thrust upon us this year in several of the Annuals. In All the Year Round , one firm has pretty well nauseated us by inserting a bill between almost every four pages of the journal, but the most objectionable form of the nuisance is that allowed by Messrs. Routledge. The first story in the Annual published by these gentlemen is apparently "Ned Rodney's Courtship," and the unsuspecting reader is led on about a couple of pages before he finds that he has been mistaken, and that he is reading not the Annual, but one of a certain popular firm's exceedingly ingenious effusions touching the Sewing Machines they have for disposal. 30 In books, advertisements, even if they are part of the sheets, are rarely positioned or labeled as if they are continuous with the rest of the text; in periodicals, however, a special effort is sometimes made to link the advertisements with the rest of the periodical's contents. Because of this, it is important to look for evidence (such as differences in paper stock) that might indicate whether the advertiser is part of the sheets of the periodical. The contents section of the description is likely to pose practical problems when a periodical contains numerous separate articles, advertisements, and illustrations on each page. The level of detail necessary in a transcription of contents will depend on several factors. If the periodical has been indexed, short titles of indexed articles are sufficient; if not, the transcription will be much more useful to potential readers if full titles and authors' names are included. One way to do this is to quote the full title; if the article is signed, a lower-case "s" and the author's name as given in the periodical appear in parentheses; if the author's name is given on a subsequent page, that page number is given. Thus on 8 'ENGLISH PROJECTILES.' (s W. Bridges Adams 10) indicates that the essay "English Projectiles" begins on page 8 and is signed with the name "W. Bridges Adams" on page 10. In cases where space will not permit any but the most abbreviated listing of contents, the bibliographer can provide the title of the first item on the page (that is, the item that appears in the upper left corner), the last item (that which appears in the lower right corner), and the total number of items per page (specifying whether advertisements are included in the total), as in the following example: 95 ads headed 'DRAWINGS AND ENGRAVINGS.' 5 titles, "M. M. Rodin, Fantin-Latour, and Legros" → "A Book of Images" Certain features of the periodical's contents, such as editorial statements, advertisements for the periodical, announcements of special supplements, etc. should always be specifically identified in the contents and transcribed: 99 ad headed 'THEOLOGY.' 2 titles "A Series of XVIII. facsimiles of MSS. of the Hebrew Bible" → "The Soul of the Sermon" also ad for '"THE DOME."' partial transcription: "A Quarterly. One Hundred pages, Pott 4 to, boards. Price is. net, or 5s. per annum, post free . *** Each number of The Dome contains about twenty examples of Music, Architecture, Literature, Drawing, Painting, and Engraving, including several Coloured Plates.' If a separate listing of illustrations is not provided, and when illustrations are too numerous to be individually identified, the number of illustrations per page can be counted and given in parentheses after each page number. As in the case of illustrations (discussed below), typographical features of the contents may be of separate interest to readers of the description, and for that reason may be presented either in a note following the listing of contents or in the section on typography. Typographical patterns, such as a larger font used for titles and bylines, or the characteristic placement of a rule or ornament between features, can be listed and measurements given. Paper It is important that paper measurements be provided, according to the model Tanselle recommends in "The Bibliographical Description of Paper," SB 24 (1971): 27 — 67. Since the paper used in periodicals of the machine-press era may differ significantly from that used in books, periodicals are likely to provide new insights for researchers who are interested in paper. In general, nineteenth-century paper is not particularly durable, thanks to the introduction of powerful rotary pulp beating machines, the use of chlorine bleach and alum-rosin sizing, and the substitution of wood pulp for rags. 31 Many periodicals (especially those with large circulations) also use thinner, lightweight paper to reduce mailing costs. Since the discoloration produced by high acidity may make it difficult to determine paper color accurately, the bibliographer may want to comment on the condition of the paper in the copies examined. 32 Typography Typography is especially significant in bibliographical analysis and description of periodicals for two reasons: first, because periodicals served as showcases for new types, especially display types; and second, because typography often plays an important part in establishing the visual style of a periodical, much more so than is usually the case in books. The development of ornamental type is one of the major events of nineteenth-century printing technology. The demand for display types was great, and the profit derived from them led to the relative neglect of plainer types. 33 Books (with the exception of cheaper paper-backs) tended not to make use of ornamental type; periodicals, on the other hand, made the most of this and other technological novelties. Wrappers, title-pages, and headings are likely places for decorative type. Many ornamental type faces can be identified in Nicolete Gray's Nineteenth Century Ornamented Typefaces (2nd ed., 1976), an essential reference for the bibliographer of Victorian periodicals. Plain type also underwent design modifications for use in newspapers and magazines. Perhaps the most famous example of innovation in magazine type is the new typeface designed by Theodore De Vinne and Linn Boyd Benton for the Century magazine; a version of this typeface is still in use (Lawson 283 — 284). Typographical patterns such as text in columns, the use of rules or frames, and the designation of particular fonts for titles, bylines, or captions should be noted. The headline and direction-line are especially important, since these will often include the date as well as the volume and issue numbers. Headlines and direction lines are often removed in bound volumes issued by the publisher; running titles in bound volumes should also be carefully checked for variation. Illustrations and Plates Illustrations were a selling point of certain periodicals, and should always be an important element of the description. Changes in illustrations or their accompanying captions can be an important source of bibliographical information, and both the content and means of production of illustrations have considerable historical and cultural relevance. Since scholars may have a special interest in illustrations apart from the other contents of the periodical, it may make sense to present them in a separate listing. In this way, detailed information about the processes used for illustration can be made easy to find, with the added benefit of not making the list of contents unnecessarily long. Given the close relationship between the periodical press and the development of illustration in the nineteenth century, I would argue for mentioning all illustrations in the periodical and describing at least some of them, if not all, including advertisements. It is difficult to decide whether illustrated advertisements should be separated from illustrations listed in the contents or otherwise featured as part of "text." A researcher interested in periodicals per se might find such a distinction to be artificial and counterproductive; on the other hand, the goals of the bibliography might make it logical to draw distinctions or emphasize some illustrations more than others, especially if one considers that the readers of a bibliography may be interested in the work of a particular illustrator, or in the ways in which a particular author's works were illustrated. The same considerations apply to plates. 34 The placement of plates in periodicals should be carefully noted, especially in bound volumes, where variations in the positions of plates can help to establish active or passive aggregation. The actual position of plates should always be compared to positions designated on the plates themselves or elsewhere in the number or volume. Binding While it is clear that the bibliographer should offer a detailed description of the original wrappers, publisher's cloth bindings, and cases offered for sale by the publisher, it is less apparent whether these all belong in a section on binding. If the wrapper has been transcribed elsewhere in the account, only a description of the paper (thickness, pattern, and color) is placed here. Cloth cases belong in the binding section only if they form part of the ideal copy of the number or volume. Thus cloth cases sold separately by the publisher, not being an aspect of ideal copy, should be noted at the end of the description, along with indexes, title-pages, and other such matter distributed separately from the number or bound volume. 35 It can be difficult to determine the status of a bound volume in publisher's cloth. Some light is shed on this topic in John Carter's description of "Binding from Parts" in Binding Variants in English Publishing 1820 — 1900 (1932). Carter describes the practice of subscribers taking sets of books issued in parts to booksellers, who would "either return them to the publisher, who would have the job done by his regular binder, or else have the case sent down and the actual binding done by a local binder" (74). Carter suggests that the involvement of local binders results in variation in the "colour and quality" of endpapers and in the trimming of edges (74); thus bibliographers who observe significant variation in these and other matters of binding (such as variations in the margin, which Carter mentions as a feature of bound-up volumes of books originally issued in parts [77]) among copies of a volume might have reason to doubt that the binding was handled by the publisher, whereas "endpapers printed with the publisher's advertisements indicate that the copy was bound by the publisher's binder . . ." (81). Further complications arise if both a volume issued by the publisher and volumes constructed by other parties exist: with a book issued in parts there would be two distinct binding operations. First, a wholesale binding of those sets of sheets which have either never been wrappered or, being wrappered for part-issue, had not sold: these would constitute the publisher's issue in volume form, appearing on completion, or more usually just before completion, of the part-issue. Then there would be the more or less desultory business of stripping sets of parts returned by subscribers, as they came in, and putting them into the publisher's cases which awaited them; parallel with which would be the single copies of small lots done to a bookseller's order by the local binder. (75) The collection of external evidence such as advertisements for bound volumes, along with the examination of multiple copies (checking for stab holes, remnants of wrappers glued to sheets, or other evidence of previous binding), is necessary to sort out such instances. Miscellaneous Materials In addition to the separate issue of volume title-pages, lists of contents, and indexes, periodicals are likely to spawn numerous promotional materials, special supplements, calendars, and other miscellaneous materials. Volume title-pages and other materials closely identified with the number(s) presented in the description are of obvious interest, and should be treated in some detail; materials that are less closely connected with the number(s) under consideration can simply be mentioned, with sources of further information provided. Copies Examined Bibliographers of periodicals should be especially scrupulous in recording the number and location of copies examined. Since periodicals are often unavailable for interlibrary loan (the majority do not circulate at all), and since in many cases it may be extremely difficult for the bibliographer to see all forms of the periodical (especially the number in wrappers), some descriptions may have to be constructed from a small number of copies. Readers who find that their number differs from ideal copy constructed by the bibliographer will certainly wish to know whether five or fifty copies were examined, and whether any of those copies are nearby for comparison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix: A Sample Description The following sample description of The Broadway 1, no. 6 (February 1868), presents some of the situations and concerns that are likely to arise in dealing with periodicals, while underscoring the many similarities that exist between periodicals and books. This account of The Broadway is not intended as a full description, but as an illustration of many of the matters previously discussed, including the problem of having to work with a limited number of copies. 36 In this case, all copies examined are bound volumes resulting from semi-active aggregation, so the sample also shows how one might proceed when the number in wrappers has not been located. The sample description emphasizes the importance of placing the individual number in context. This takes place primarily in the introductory notes, which present an overview of the periodical's first volume with special reference to the position of Number 6 in the volume's history and to the special features of this number. The prose commentary supplied in the sample could be shortened or even replaced with a brief listing of crucial elements if space were limited. In any case, the introductory note for this number would contain considerably less information about the general history of the periodical if several numbers were being described, and in those circumstances some elements of the description proper, such as the publisher's case and related materials described in the "Miscellaneous" section, would be presented elsewhere and not repeated in individual descriptions. Also, if the contents of The Broadway were indexed in Wellesley or elsewhere, it might not be necessary to provide full titles and author's signatures in the description's contents section. The organization of the sample description reflects the particular features of this number of The Broadway . For example, the wrapper is presented in the section on binding because the information it records is already mentioned in the introductory notes and in the title-page transcription. Since the number includes a relatively small number of illustrations, they are indicated both in the contents proper and in a separate, more detailed subsection. The section on typography illustrates the tendency of periodicals to shift type sizes both for reasons of space (which probably accounts for the presentation of "Mrs. Holmes Grey" in double columns) and to use typography to distinguish among various sorts of headings and signatures. But here and elsewhere many elements appear essentially as they might in a description of a book, thus demonstrating that bibliographical description of periodicals is both feasible and appropriate. The Broadway, 1, no. 6 (February 1868) introductory notes. 37 Overview . The monthly magazine The Broadway began publication in August 1867, under the editorship of Edmund Routledge, the son of the magazine's publisher George Routledge (and a partner in his father's firm). The periodical's plan was to appeal to British and American audiences through its contents and the inclusion of contributors from both countries. However, as Clarence Gohdes has observed, its orientation remained primarily British; The Broadway was "merely a London journal which devoted more than the average amount of space to American topics and which included a few contributions by such authors as the Cary sisters, Evert Duyckinck, and R. H. Stoddard." 38 The Broadway 's editorial policy was modified in an announcement that appeared in Number 12 (August 1868), the last number of the magazine's first volume: "'The Broadway' will cease to be specially an 'Anglo-American' or an 'Americo-Anglican' magazine. We are convinced that there is a still Broader way in Literature and Art than that which spreads itself under the shadow of St. Paul's in London, or stretches from the Battery to Harlem Bridge in New York" (quoted in Gohdes, 61). While the magazine's wrapper provides a British and a New York publisher's address (and Gohdes also mentions that United States sales were conducted through Routledge's New York office [61]), the Routledge archives 39 do not indicate whether an American issue was produced. The British numbers were priced at sixpence. Number 6 is notable for its inclusion of William Rossetti's poem "Mrs. Holmes Grey." Edmund Routledge was eager to enlist Rossetti as a contributor, writing to him twice in October of 1867. Neither The Broadway nor its editor made a good impression on Rossetti, who complained in a letter to Swinburne: "That most grovelling of publications the Broadway wrote to me some fortnight ago, asking me to contribute. I declined, instancing their prospectus as of itself enough to warn off any human writer" (October 29, 1867). 40 However, Routledge's assurance that "the character of the Magazine is being altered, and that various mighty writers ranging in calibre between Algernon Swinburne and Tom Taylor or Gerald Massey, are being invited" ( Selected Letters , 181 — 182) seems to have persuaded Rossetti to send "Mrs. Holmes Grey" to Routledge in November. Having secured the poem, Routledge then tried (without success) to obtain an illustration by Dante Rossetti to accompany it. Ultimately A. B. Houghton was chosen to depict the scene at the coffin (plate 2 below). 41 Rossetti's diary entry for January 28, 1868, reports that the February number was "out" on that date ( Rossetti Papers , 296). Routledge's pursuit of contributions from the Rossetti brothers shows him to have been a hardworking and ambitious editor. He may have been too ambitious, for The Broadway 's first volume began to show signs of cost-cutting as early as Number 5, when the wrapper, formerly printed in red and black ink, was printed in black only. Additional economically inspired changes took place after the publication of Number 6. First, the numbers became shorter: Numbers 1 — 6 contain 40 leaves (not including the title page), but subsequent numbers contain only 30 (Nos. 7 — 11) or 32 leaves [No. 12]). Next, the quantity of plates was reduced from two per number (Nos. 1 — 9) to one plate in Numbers 10 and 11, and none in 12. These cost-cutting measures coincide with reductions in the total copies printed. While 90,000 copies of the first number are recorded in Routledge's Publications Books, the entry for Number 6, dated January 31, 1868, indicates that only 30,000 copies were printed, on 150 reams of double-demy paper. 42 The print run continued to decrease to 18,000 copies of Number 11 and rose only slightly to 20,000 for Number 12. 43 Printing and publication history . Neither the copies examined nor the Routledge archives give any evidence of more than one edition or issue of Number 6, or of active aggregation of the volume. The wrapper of 1.1 (Newberry copy) contains the phrase "Third Edition, making 90,000," but while Routledge's publication books confirm that 90,000 copies were printed, they do not indicate how many impressions were made of that or of any other number. Semi-active aggregation is indicated by an advertisement for publisher's case in Number 12 (August), at a price of 1s. 6d.; apparently the "Title Page, Contents, Etc." which are listed on the title-page of Number 12 were provided with that number. All numbers examined are part of bound volumes. Of these, the Newberry copy contains a single-leaf title-page (with advertisements on verso) for each number; the title-page leaves are not included in the pagination. The title-pages may have been part of a preliminary gathering, as indicated by the page number 16 and the running title "The Broadway Advertiser" which appear on the verso of the leaf in Number 6. The Waterloo entry mentions "16 — 20 pp" of advertisements per number, but does not indicate which numbers were examined. Both the National Union Catalogue Pre-1956 Imprints (77:127) and Supplement (702:508) record a possible volume issue published in 1868 under the title Novels, tales and poetry . The entries refer to this publication as a "reprint" of The Broadway volume 1, and the number of pages matches the number of pages in the bound volumes I have examined. I have not been able to examine these copies and cannot confirm that they include Number 6. title-page. [top of page: engraving, 30 x 81.

In the headnote to this section, Sadleir explains that the annuals "rank apart from ordinary periodical issues" because they "were issued as self-contained and independent publications," and he also notes that Trollope's contributions were not published elsewhere. Also included is a section devoted to "Saint Paul's Under Trollope's Editorship," in which each installment is briefly described. A third section, "Contributions (Not Reprinted) To Periodicals," is a brief enumerative listing in chronological order. 6 There is no major index for nineteenth-century American periodicals comparable to the Wellesley Index ; in addition to Poole's and the Nineteenth-Century Reader's Guide , American periodicals are indexed in the Index to Early American Periodicals to 1850 (340 magazines; 1964), and in Daniel Wells, The Literary Index to American Magazines, 1815 — 1865 (25 magazines; 1980) and Jayne Kribb's An Annotated Bibliography of American Literary Periodicals, 1741 — 1850 (1977), which lists authors published in each periodical or titles of significant literary pieces or essays. Other important sources for American periodicals are G. T. Tanselle's Guide to the Study of United States Imprints (1971), Frank Luther Mott's A History of American Magazines (1930 — 68) and Edward Chielens's The Literary Journal in America to 1900: A Guide to Information Sources (1975) and American Literary Magazines: The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries (1986). 7 Of special concern is the incomplete indexing of internationally published periodicals, since differences in the content of American issues of British periodicals (and British issues of American periodicals) go unrecorded in the major indexes. 8 In Victorian Periodicals: A Guide to Research , ed. J. Don Vann and Rosemary Van Arsdel (1978), 21 — 51. 9 In Victorian Periodicals Review 12.1 (Spring 1979): 3 — 15. 10 As G. T. Tanselle explains in "Descriptive Bibliography and Library Cataloguing," SB 30 (1977): 1 — 56, the goal of descriptive cataloguing differs from that of descriptive bibliography primarily because the goal of cataloguing is to describe an individual copy of a book, while that of descriptive bibliography is to establish ideal copy (47). Also, library cataloguing is more likely to be oriented towards an account of the intellectual content of the item described, including physical details only insofar as they "help characterize the content" (71), whereas descriptive bibliography is oriented towards an account of the item as a physical object, and is interested in physical details for their own sake. For this reason the methods that have been developed for the purposes of library cataloguing of periodicals are not necessarily suitable for the descriptive bibliographer; however, the discussions of the nature and special features of periodicals are valuable, as is the establishment of specialized terminology to describe those features. The only book length discussion of library cataloguing and citation of periodicals is Paul E. Vesenyi's An Introduction to Periodical Bibliography (1974), which unfortunately is focused almost entirely upon bibliographic control of the contents of periodicals and is thus of little value to descriptive bibliographers. 11 In Investigating Victorian Journalism , ed. Laurel Brake, Aled Jones and Lionel Madden (1990), 19 — 32. 12 See Scott Bennett, "The Golden Stain of Time: Preserving Victorian Periodicals," in Investigating Victorian Journalism , 166 — 183. 13 Page 8 in "The Journal as a Print Artifact," Serials Review 12 (Summer-Fall 1986): 7 — 9. 14 See "A Sample Bibliographical Description, With Commentary" ( SB 40 [1987]: 1 — 30): "What I am particularly concerned to demonstrate is that descriptive bibliography is a form of biographical, and thus historical, scholarship" (2); and also "A Description of Descriptive Bibliography" ( SB 45 [1992]: 1 — 30), especially footnote 50. 15 I have discussed this point in "A Bibliographical Approach to Victorian Publishing," in Literature in the Marketplace: Nineteenth-Century British Publishing and Reading Practices , ed. John O. Jordan and Robert L. Patton (1995), 269 — 288. 16 "The Bibliographic Control of Victorian Periodicals," 50. 17 Household Words: A Weekly Journal, 1850 — 1859, conducted by Charles Dickens: Table of Contents, List of Contributors, and Their Contributions, based on the Household Words Office Book . . .

I.; in another printing, merely VOL." (45). Type damage in itself does not offer evidence of more than one "printing"; on the other hand, the fact that "The non-textual material set below the double rule that encloses the text (that is, the publisher-printer imprint and the notation of volume and number) seems in some copies to have been a part of the stereotyped plate, in other copies, not" (45) points to multiple impressions or issues, as do some of Lohrli's other comments (for example, "In some printings of No. 19, mention of Bradbury &amp; Evans is substituted by the notation 'Published every Saturday' and a statement of the price and issuance in monthly parts" [45]). 19 See Faxon's "Magazine Perplexities. I. The Strand; its English and American Editions," Bulletin of Bibliography 1.8 (January 1899): 122 — 123. 20 The most recent approved revision of the American National Standard for Periodicals was published in 1977 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI), now known as the National Information Standards Organization (NISO). Several draft revisions of the standard have since appeared under the same title and classification number (Z39.1), the most recent in 1990. The American National Standard for Periodicals "recommends to editors and publishers of periodicals the details of format and arrangement needed to provide effectively the bibliographic information that will enable scholars, librarians, documentalists, and subscription agencies to identify periodicals and their component parts accurately and thus facilitate their use" (9). While the American National Standard for Periodicals is of greater value for bibliographers of twentieth-century periodicals, the standard can serve to remind all bibliographers that what should appear often does not, especially in earlier publications. 21 Much discussion has already taken place regarding the potential of hypermedia for critical editions, but little consideration has been given to the great boon that hypermedia might be for descriptive bibliographers. Two collections of essays edited by Paul Delany and George P. Landow, Hypermedia and Literary Studies (1991) and The Digital Word: Text-Based Computing in the Humanities (1993) are useful introductions to the actual and potential uses of emerging technology; discussions of the role of computer technology in editing include Peter Shillingsberg's Scholarly Editing in the Computer Age: Theory and Practice (1986) and recent article "Polymorphic, Polysemic, Protean, Reliable, Electronic Texts" in Palimpsest: Editorial Theory in the Humanities , ed. George Bornstein and Ralph Williams (1993), and Peter M. W. Robinson's "Redefining Critical Editions" in The Digital Word , 271 — 291. 22 See G. T. Tanselle, "Tolerances in Bibliographical Description," The Library 5th ser. 23 (March 1968): 1 — 12. 23 I have made trial descriptions of the periodical installments or volumes listed below (active aggregation is termed "volume issue"; other aggregations are termed "bound volume"): Periodicals examined in the Newberry Library: Banter (volume issue 1867; shelfmark fY 194.072); Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine (bound volumes 53 [Jan. — June 1843] and 54 [July — Dec. 1843], A 51.14; also US edition, volume issue 53 and 54, fA 51.141); The Broadway (bound volume [Sept. 1867 — Aug. 1868], A 51.168); Chapman's Weekly Magazine (bound volume no. 1 — 7 [Sept. 28, 1843 — Nov. 9, 1843], A51.196); Dark Blue (bound volume 1 no. 1 — 6 [March 1871 — August 1871], A 51.26); The Dome (volume 1 no. 5, os, 1898; bound volume 1 ns no. 1 — 3 [Oct. 1898 — Dec. 1898], A 51.265); Domestic Journal and Home Miscellany (bound volume 1 [July 30 — Dec. 15, 1849], A 51.267); Once a Week (bound volume 1 no. 1 — 26 [July — Dec. 1859], A 51.695; The Victoria Magazine (volume 1 no. 1 [May 1, 1863], A 51.001); The Woman's World (bound volumes [1888, 1889]; fA 51.9543).

Periodicals examined at Texas A &amp; M University library: Illustrated London News (bound volume 70 [Jan. — June 1877]); Fortnightly Review (bound volume 21 ns [Jan. — June 1877]); Edinburgh Review (volume 145 [Jan. — April 1877]). 24 "Prolegomenon to Serials Bibliography: A Report to the Society," Victorian Periodicals Review 12.1 (1979): 3 — 15; quotation from 7. 25 The following description of a show-card for The Sunday at Home from the British and Colonial Printer and Stationer ("The Sunday at Home. — New Volume," No. 10, Volume 2 [December 1, 1879]: 875 — 876) provides a rare description of this form of advertising: "A handsomer show-card than the one issued by this well-known magazine has never been seen. The new volume is announced as just ready, and if its contents be on a par with the exceedingly well-executed card or coloured poster which now excites our admiration, the new volume will indeed be a treat. "There are four lithographic illustrations upon the card we allude to, emblematic of the four seasons of the year. The subjects of each are well-known English birds, really very beautifully drawn and coloured. "An appropriate verse accompanies each picture, and the whole display reflects the greatest possible credit upon Messrs. Riddle and Couchman, the artists, and the publishers of the well-known and highly-esteemed magazine. . . ." 26 The similar problem posed by composite books is discussed in G. T. Tanselle, "The Description of Non-Letterpress Material in Books," SB 35 (1982): 1 — 42. 27 An excellent discussion of the rationale for title-page transcription is G. T. Tanselle's "Title-Page Transcription and Signature Collation," SB 38 (1985): 45 — 81. 28 The term "masthead" is defined for nineteenth-century periodicals in the Manual for the Bibliographical Description of Serials as "the title and publication data area above the columns of a newspaper or periodical"; information included in the masthead usually includes "time of publication and designations of editions, editorial address (which may differ from the publishing address of the colophon), possibly name of editor, advertisement or subscription rates, and the like" (25). Other definitions of the term "masthead," especially those not based on nineteenth-century works, do not specify its location or insist, as the Manual does, on its connection with a periodical's or newspaper's editorial pages. To spare confusion, the term "masthead" should probably only be used in the more general sense, to refer to that place in the periodical reserved for a statement regarding the publisher, sponsoring organization (if any), editorial personnel, frequency of issue, etc, regardless of where such a statement is placed. A heading that includes the title and other information may be termed a "masthead" as long as more detailed publishing information is not offered elsewhere in the periodical, in which case it would make sense to refer to the heading by a term such as "head-title." 29 Ed. Michael Gorman and Paul W. Winkler, 2nd ed. (1978). 30 "Christmas Numbers," Printing Times 1 (January 1 1873): 11. Frank Luther Mott's A History of American Magazines 1865 — 1885 (1938) reports similar cases of "advertisements . . . passed off as regular reading matter" in postbellum American magazines (11). 31 See Scott Bennett, "The Golden Stain of Time: Preserving Victorian Periodicals," in Investigating Victorian Journalism , 166 — 183. 32 Tanselle's "The Bibliographical Description of Paper" includes a short list of methods of testing the physical properties of paper and a short discussion of the use of the Centroid Color Chart to identify paper colors, but does not discuss the problems posed by acidic paper. The Centroid Chart, and the problem of color specification in general, are discussed in Tanselle's "A System of Color Identification for Bibliographical Description," SB 20 (1967): 203 — 234. 33 See Alexander Lawson, Anatomy of a Typeface (1990), 283 — 284. 34 Plates are treated in some detail in Tanselle's "The Description of Non-Letterpress Material in Books," SB 35 (1982): 1 — 42. 35 The (sometimes erratic) provision of volume title-pages and indexes was a sore point for librarians and other subscribers. The topic is mentioned several times in the Bulletin of Bibliography , with the complaint that periodicals had abandoned the former practice of supplying titles and indexes as a matter of course. In January 1903 the Bulletin threatened to "publish as a 'black list' the titles of those American and English periodicals, which publish (a) no title and index, (b) index but no title, (c) title but no index, (d) title or index, or both, separately, and supply them only when specially requested; (e) title or index, or both, separately, and inclosed loose, either in last number of the volume or some subsequent number" ("The Irregular Issue of Title-Pages and Indexes, in Periodicals," Bulletin of Bibliography 3.4 [January 1903]: 1). 36 Four copies of volume 1, numbers 1 — 12, of The Broadway (1867 — 1868) have been inspected. While examination of the entire first volume allows number 6 to be placed in its immediate context, ideally some subsequent numbers or volumes would also have been consulted. 37 A full page advertisement for Number 1 of The Broadway appeared in The Athenaeum No. 2076 (August 10, 1867), 189. 38 In American Literature in Nineteenth-Century England (1944), 60 — 61. 39 The Archives of George Routledge &amp; Company, 1853 — 1902 , part of the Chadwyck-Healey microfilm series British Publishers Archives on Microfilm , 6 reels (1973). 40 Selected Letters of William Michael Rossetti , ed.

      <field name="heading_text">John Shirley and British Library, MS. Additional 16165 by Ralph Hanna III</field>
      <field name="fulltext">British Library, MS. Additional 16165 is a tolerably well-known book, and justly so. 1 This volume is absolutely central to the development of an English poetic canon — an early collection including some Chaucer lyrics and, with the nearly contemporary Cambridge University Library, MS. Gg. iv.27 (customarily dated c. 1415 — 25), the earliest manuscript to include Chaucer and Lydgate cheek by jowl. But the book is equally important, although it has seldom been discussed in this way, for its prose contents. One's first perceptions of this volume, especially coming to it either from earlier large collected volumes, books like Bodleian Library, ms. Eng. poet. a.1 ("the Vernon ms.," 1390s?) and Cambridge, Magdalene College, ms. Pepys 2498 ( c. 1375), or from those "early London" manuscripts identified by Doyle and Parkes, is likely to be shock. First, the material of the book is different and decidedly cheap: Additional 16165 is written on paper, rather than vellum. Moreover, the volume has minimal decoration: its ornament is restricted to some red initial capitals provided by the scribe. And in contrast to the formal display scripts one encounters in Vernon, Pepys, the Hengwrt Canterbury Tales , early copies of Gower, or the "Ilchester" Piers Plowman , the hand of the Additional manuscript is awkward and sprawling, if not downright ugly. The scribe, John Shirley, so far as we know, did his earlier writing as an aristocratic dependent: he was the secretary of a great lord, Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (whose name will recur frequently in the pages which follow). 2 This earlier experience appears in the type of hand Shirley writes, "secretary" — a style originally for use in legal documents and introduced to England during his youth (he was born about 1356). 3 And if one collates the copies, one can see that the care of reproduction which went into earlier English books is here absent: Shirley was a particularly sloppy and heedless copyist. Additional — its pages are about the size of a modern sheet of typing paper — consists of 258 leaves, 254 of them paper folded in folio and distributed among twenty-two quires. The first of these gatherings, unsigned, comprises three vellum folios and contains Shirley's front-matter, including a verse "calendar" of contents originally paralleled in another of the three surviving manuscripts he copied. 4 The remaining quires, as the following table will indicate, are mostly twelves. In both calendars of contents, Shirley claims to have produced the manuscripts by laborious acts of collection. (Lines 19 — 20 of the verses originally affixed to his Sion/Trinity manuscript allege that these efforts involved acquiring exemplars from across the Channel.) These ongoing acts of acquisition are in fact marked in Additional 16165 as part of its production, for the manuscript was copied as a sequence of three or four booklets (for the paper, I follow Lyall 16 — 19, an important description). These production units, by and large, reflect Shirley's intent to group texts by literary types and authors, the latter an important concern of his contents calendar. Shirley insists upon the value of the "legende" he here assembles, and he alludes to Chaucer's Legend of Good Women with its assertion of the literary value of "remembraunce" (line 8); the book gathers the writings of those whom Shirley somewhat incongruously calls "olde clerkes . . . appreued in alle hir werkis" (lines 7 — 8). For the most part, the volume heralds, preserves, and disseminates the activity of the noble dead — it is an explicit canonizing act associated with the authors' eternality both in text and spirit: þeyres beo þe thanke and þe meede þat first hit [i.e. the contents?] studyed and owt founde; Nowe beon þey dolven deep in þe grounde. Beseche I God he gyf hem grace In hevens blisse to haue a place. (lines 20 — 24) The "olde clerkes" are divided among two production units and these joined with considerably more contemporary material — a sign of the ongoing enterprise of a single literary culture rooted in a not so distant past. Ef. 4 — 114 (the signed quires i — ix) contain Chaucer's Boece (composed in the early 1380s) and John Trevisa's translation of the apocryphal gospel of Nicodemus (composed in the 1380s?). Quire ix includes an extra inserted leaf, the twelfth, a "casting-off" procedure typical of a fascicle ending: it allows the conclusions of a production unit and of a text to correspond.

The remainder of the book, ff. 201 — 258 (quires xvii — xxi) opens with a Latin "Regula sacerdotum" and Lydgate's "Temple of Glass." The manuscript concludes with a large group of lyrics (including a split text of Chaucer's "Anelida," the complaint at the head, the narrative at the very end of this portion). 8 The final lyric quire, with the exception of the concluding pair of texts, the possibly Chaucerian "Ballad of Complaint" and the narrative bit of "Anelida," is totally given over to a group of Lydgate's poems. This unit is conceivably separate from the rest of the lyric portion; but whatever its production status, it is marked as the conclusion of the codex, since Shirley extended the paper quire beyond the original twelve leaves, adding at least one parchment folio (there was probably a second, now lost), which would not only have provided space to conclude the text but would also serve as a guard for the paper pages. Beyond these physical breaks — the booklets were presumably produced independently without, at least initially, any expectation of their juncture — the process of conglomeration by which the book was prepared is marked in other ways. For example, the red initials, unique in Shirley's work, cease in quire 3. Similarly, some rubrics, including a few with ascriptions, were only added later. And with the exception of some early quires, which, whatever Shirley's changes of plans, would have begun some possible codex, much of the volume was only signed and given catch-words after copying, and some portions, the greater part of Booklet II, were never signed. Further, Shirley's affixed calendar omits one substantial item, Lydgate's "Complaint." This appears in the only signed portions of Booklet II, at the end of this sequence of quires, and looks to be a late, almost post-production, addition. The text plainly came separate from that of the other Lydgate vision, "Temple of Glass," and at an advanced stage of production there would have been no ready place to insert it in the consecutive vision-lyric portion of the codex which follows. The volume probably did not achieve anything approaching its current form or ordering until after the composition of the calendar, some point shortly before Shirley, as he tells us, had someone construct a binding for his quires (calendar, line 17). Both the order of Shirley's copying and the period during which he prepared the volume, the earliest of his surviving literary efforts, can be rather narrowly defined on the basis of the paper-stocks. Doyle originally dated the watermarks shortly after 1419, but Lyall offers considerably more precise information. The very large number of stocks (eleven, including the unidentified stock of the first quire in Booklet I) and their piecemeal use (six of them — that of quire i, a, b, d, h , and i — occur in but a single quire) suggests that much of the manuscript was probably compiled on a patchwork basis, copied a few leaves at a time, over an extended, but, given Lyall's clustered dating of the papers, not an exceptionally protracted, period (contrast Lyall 16 — 17). As Lyall notes, one portion of the Additional manuscript clearly predates all remaining portions. This quire, xvii at the head of Booklet III, uniquely utilizes stock h , which Lyall sees as "very like" a 1406 Palermo paper. The text which opens this quire, a Latin rule for priests which includes provocative commentary on lay-clerical relations, expresses a courtly interest foreign to the rather staidly literary texts which otherwise constitute the volume. But, given the early date of the paper, such a text might make a good deal of sense: lordly flirtations with Wycliffism (and with pre-existent but related interests in expropriation of clerical property) characterize substantial segments of aristocratic culture from the early 1370s until late in the reign of Henry IV (see Aston). They may even be perceived as having peaked at the 1407 "parliamentum illiteratum" at Coventry, an event provocatively close to the date of the paper's manufacture. The remainder of the manuscript, including the extension of this pre-existent quire xvii into the lyric-vision Booklet III, was produced much later, although likely within a fairly brief span c. 1420 — 27. 9 Shirley's next datable work on the codex may have begun as early as c. 1415, and probably no later than c. 1420, as he began to copy Chaucer's Boece into what was eventually to become Booklet I. Slightly later (given the paper, c. 1423 — 25), he began the separate copying of Edward's Master of Game into a sequence of quires which would become Booklet II. Given the very long run of paper-stock g which characterizes this stint, Shirley may have worked at this portion of the codex with some persistence. And if the manuscript comprises four booklets, at this time and on the same stock, Shirley was at work on the Lydgate lyrics which appear in the final quire. Shirley's finishing and joining the volume into a unit is marked by the use of identical papers at the end of Booklets I and II. These two stocks ( e and f ) are relatively contemporary in manufacture (1426 — 27) and appear in the same order at the conclusion of both booklets ( f — e in quires viii — ix and xv — xvi). Moreover, the possibility that Lydgate's "Complaint," omitted from Shirley's contents list, in fact is the latest text in the volume, pre-supposes that Booklet III had already been extended to something like its current dimensions (stock j , in quires xix — xx, most resembles a Frankfurt paper of 1424): the Lydgate poem could not have been joined with its similar, "The Temple of Glass." The latest datable contents, all of which appear in either the extended Booklet III or in Booklet IV, suggest relatively prompt copying. Most notably, the manuscript contains a virelai composed by Richard Beauchamp, Shirley's employer; this is addressed to Beauchamp's second wife as if his donna and, given the lord's reputation as "the flower of English chivalry," should only have been composed between 28 December 1422 and the following 26 November. 10 Similar datings are implied by other contents: Lydgate's "Departing of Thomas Chaucer on Ambassade to France" has usually been taken to refer to events of 1417, but might allude to Chaucer's later appointments of 1420 or 1424. And Shirley's rubric to Lydgate's "Invocation to St. Anne" says that the poem was a command performance for Anne, countess of Stafford, a style strictly appropriate only during her son's minority — he was married and had his own countess by 1424. Further negative evidence implying that much of Shirley's work should be placed in the early to mid 1420s comes from other Lydgate materials: the two visions, "Complaint" and "Temple," appear here in their earliest forms. These are conventionally dated pre-1412, largely on the basis of a scholarly horror vacui (we assume Lydgate must have had some juvenalia before embarking on his major project, the Troy Book , dedicated to Henry V), but the poet later (the earliest evidence is from the 1430s) subjected both to extensive revision. And there is further indirect evidence implying a relatively early terminus for Shirley's collection of archetypes, if not his actual copying: the manuscript lacks those works Lydgate composed for Shirley's employers, the Beauchamp family, dated with some assurance c. 1423 — 27. 11 Such a dating suggests that the Additional manuscript might well be dissociated from Shirley's other (and later) books. It is usually assumed that these reflect his activities at a period when he had set up residence at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Smithfield (where he rented a tenement and four shops). Unlike the calendar originally prefaced to Shirley's later Sion/Trinity manuscript, which presupposes a London locale (see lines 49 — 51), Additional refers to no place of manufacture (other than a metaphorical "hoome" in line 98). Moreover, the manuscript, on the basis both of the contents and the paper evidence, at least in part likely predates the earliest surviving reference to Shirley as "esquire of London" in 1429 (see Doyle, "New Light" 94 — 95). Some scrappy evidence survives about Shirley's residence during this pre-1429 period. A registered copy of a signed letter ( Register , entry 1223) shows him still directly engaged as Richard Beauchamp's personal secretary (although in a peripatetic household with numerous residences in the capital, provinces, and overseas) as late as spring 1423, when the manuscript should already have been well along in production. 12 At the time of this letter, he was writing from what had been the family seat of Beauchamp's first wife, Elizabeth Berkeley, Wotton-under-Edge (Gloucester). Shirley likely had frequent resort to this manor-house from at least 1417, both since there were persistent legal problems over the countess's inheritance (Smyth 2:passim; Lowry 331, 335) and since his first wife (who died 1421) had been among her ladies-in-waiting (Ross 93). This siting signals one important aspect of Shirley's status, his insider connections. He served a figure prominent in the courts of Henry V and VI and a person well-connected literarily by marriage: the father of Beauchamp's first countess was Thomas IV, Lord Berkeley, patron of John Trevisa and of an anonymous Vegetius translator (perhaps William Clifton, fourth master of the family's grammar school at Wotton; see Hanna 900 — 901). As a result, Shirley was well positioned to have special knowledge of earlier English literary production, in addition to special access to earlier texts. Given the form his copying takes, he presumably could access in-house exemplars at odd moments of leisure without worrying about their absence or their being required elsewhere. Shirley's book makes visible a prior tradition of private circulation among aristocratic coteries now, by and large, lost to us. The three prose texts in Additional 16165 typify this personal contact extending back through coterie audiences to the original productions. Additional is the only surviving manuscript of any of these texts in which the compiler clearly and correctly ascribes each work to its proper author. 13 Moreover, in all three cases one can hypothesize a direct Beauchamp link which would explain such precise information. In the case of Boece , Shirley would have found material aid for connecting the work with Chaucer in the Beauchamp household: Elizabeth Berkeley had commissioned a verse translation of De Consolatione about 1410, and her translator, the Augustinian canon John Walton of Oseney, had for the most part versified Chaucer, al-although he had simultaneously consulted the Latin original and Nicholas Trivet's commentary on it. And further information was certainly available through the poet's son: Additional provides the unique copy of Lydgate's "Departing of Thomas Chaucer," and if the poem commemorates Chaucer's 1417 service in France, it alludes to a commission on which he served with Shirley's boss, Richard Beauchamp. The other ascriptions rely on much more direct Beauchamp knowledge. John Trevisa was the dependent cleric of Elizabeth's father and is identified as such in Shirley's calendar (lines 35 — 44; Shirley's claim there that Trevisa was an M.Th. may be a further sign of special knowledge, but the degree is not verifiable from any other surviving document). The ascription of The Master of Game to Edward of York even notices his death at Agincourt (calendar, lines 50 — 55, and the initial rubric to the text). Edward had been more than an acquaintance of Thomas Berkeley, and Shirley was in France with the Beauchamp retinue during the Agincourt campaign. 14 Nearer home, Beauchamp's second wife was Edward's niece. The precise information, and the contents themselves, were perhaps available to Shirley only because of his household affiliations. The three full manuscripts Shirley copied resemble one another in content, as well as material and format. Each joins a substantial amount of recent prose with large collections of courtly verse. 15 For the most part, Shirley transmits Lydgate's poetry; but given the modest nature of the survivals, he also includes a large proportion of Chaucer's lyric output. These lyric contents are especially important for intuiting Shirley's readership, for they place the codices within an English literary community by and large upperclass and, in the case of Additional, perhaps specifically aristocratic. The contents poems indicate Shirley's desire as compiler to delight his audience. He promises reading material "right vertuous, / Of maner of mirthe nought vicious" (Additional calendar, lines 3 — 4). And, especially in their perorations, the poems presuppose an audience with both the leisure and inclination for an interest in the indoor sport of love, the subject of the included lyrics and visions. At the date when Additional was prepared, at any rate, this was probably not the general social craze it was to become later in the century, yet one which might interest even so busy and noble a figure as the virelaying Richard Beauchamp. These details provide at least suggestive evidence that the book may have been prepared for an audience differing from that at St. Bartholomew's. Such an audience would have been in some sense aristocratic and joined by centralized interests, members of the Beauchamp household. If my inferences are correct, Additional 16165 probably emerges from a great house aristocratic coterie. But rather than reading Anglo-Norman translations, as did earlier audiences of this type, this coterie, while expected to have a similar interest in translated prose (as well as such simple Latin as the "Regula sacerdotum"), received those texts in English. Shirley, although he clearly distinguishes himself from those he calls his "auctores" and identifies himself merely as "þe wryter" of the book, might be taken as a later, secularized version of Anglo-Norman household clerics. For example, in the mid-thirteenth century, the domestic chaplain Robert of Gretham composed two lengthy vernacular devotional texts derived from Latin sources, precisely for the edification of his employers, Alain and Aline. Like Robert, Shirley was certainly his lord's dependent, a long-term member of his retinue, and presumably employed in part for his writing ability as the earl's secretary. To this useful employment, he appears to have added a second writing task: in his role of dependent squire, Shirley assembled materials which might be used as entertainment for the varied and often dispersed group which comprised Beauchamp's household. Indeed, the two tasks interface more closely than one might expect: at least some of the more fulsome rubrics for which Shirley is well-known may be carryovers of that language of deference one might associate with his "true" professional career as copyist (if not author) of Beauchamp's correspondence. Part of Shirley's service as Beauchamp dependent — the informal and unremunerated part — involved offering the materials of domestic entertainment. Shirley differs from Robert of Gretham or from his "auctour" Trevisa in that this was not material which he composed — he only disseminated it. This process, as the contents poems make clear, was a bit of volunteerism, a personal gesture superadded to Shirley's normal employment. And it does not seem to have been a gesture in the interests of profit, but a further form of service to the household community. The contents calendars, Additional at some length, insist that the books exise simply to be loaned for entertainment: And whane ye haue þis booke ouerlooked, Thankeþe . . . þe wryter for his distresse, Whiche besechiþe your gentylnesse þat ye sende þis booke ageyne Hoome to Shirley þat is right feyne, If it haþe beon to yowe pleasaunce As in þe reedyng of þe romaunce. (89, 93, 95 — 100) Shirley is creating a domestic library. He envisions borrowing of his book for private and unsupervised use, perhaps even recopying, with eventual return to him. The book belongs within a social situation, one in which, like in the game of love, life is thoroughly imbued with literary activity. Apparently successful at this "superadded" household service. Shirley went on to similar, but more public, activities in the capitol; this second phase of his career was to guide a number of later book producers, who kept his archetypes in circulation through the reign of Edward IV. 16 The aristocratic coterie nature of Additional 16165 deserves a few additional comments. In many ways, the manuscript is overly familiar, testimony to the ongoing tradition of English courtly verse: it includes Chaucerian snippets (and Chaucerian misascriptions — for example, two lyrics redolent with double entendre) 17 coupled with newer productions, the work of Lydgate. But this material coexists with something one should recognize (Shirley is no innovator here) as an equally courtly mode of an earlier "Chaucerian" generation, prose translation. Over two-thirds of the manuscript is devoted to something which is not verse. Shirley is renowned primarily as a transmitter (and very frequently, establisher) of the Chaucer and Lydgate canons. But all three of his surviving codices adhere to the same pattern: each provides extensive prose as well as verse. And his sense of Chaucer's canon includes not simply the lyric but Boece as well. Indeed, Shirley was enough committed to this form of aristocratic literary output to practice it himself. Late in life ( c. 1440 and later), "in his last yeres and febull age" as he puts it, he turned foreign materials into English prose — and not simply once but four times. (The translations survive in British Library, MS. Additional 5467, from Shirley's holograph but not in his hand.) After a generation of serving his "auctores," those whom in the Additional calendar verse he heralds as the noble dead of the preceding generation, Shirley sought to emulate them. From merely copying the "auctour" Trevisa, he evolved into him (cf. Lerer 117 — 146). This behavior should indicate something of the compelling power prose translation could exert, both in the Ricardian period and the early fifteenth century. Rather than aristocratic fiction, Additional is involved in the practical, if not the historically particular — Beauchamp's lyric and its relation to his remarriage, for example. And perhaps the surest guide to this sense of public life and public duties comes from the prose — all translations which look back, beyond their immediate audience, beyond their dead "auctores" as well, to fixed authoritative source texts which discuss behaviors pious, noble, and true. 18</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Hammond provides the nearest thing to a published description, "Omissions" 37 — 38. She offers briefer information about the codex at "Departing" 331; and similar brief material appears at Brusendorff 208 (with a photo of f. 244 v facing 280). 2 All discussions of this manuscript and others produced by the scribe must begin with Doyle's "New Light." The promised continuation of this study has never appeared, although Doyle addresses Shirley's career again at "Court" 175, 176 — 178; and see also Griffiths. As he always is, Doyle has been unfailingly generous in sharing unpublished information about Shirley: here I frequently rely upon a presentation Doyle made at the July 1983 York conference on fifteenth-century manuscripts and upon comments in our correspondence. For Richard Beauchamp, see DNB 2:29 — 31; and GEC 12, ii:378 — 382. 3 Parkes (xix — xxi) discusses the introduction and development of "secretary." The writing styles of Pepys and Vernon are, of course, also ultimately document-derived ("anglicana"), but the scribes of these manuscripts, a century after the development from document hands, write them at their most careful and formal ("formata"). 4 The other full manuscripts Shirley copied are Bodleian Library, MS. Ashmole 59 (Doyle dates the paper 1444 — 47) and a manuscript now split and partly lost (Doyle dates the paper 1431 — 32): Sion College, MS. E.44 + British Library, MS. Harley 78, ff. 80 — 83 + Cambridge, Trinity College, MS. R.3.20, with the otherwise lost contents poem of this second codex in Stow's sixteenth-century transcription at British Library, MS. Additional 29729, f. 177 v . Cf. Griffiths 92 — 93. I quote the calendars, IMEV 1426 and 2598, from Hammond's edition, English Verse 194 — 197. 5 All three leaves of this quire appear to be singletons. 6 Quires 10 — 14 are unsigned. 7 Quire xxi was originally twelve paper leaves, with thirteenth and fourteenth leaves, both vellum — and probably a bifolium — added; as part of this process (strengthening the end of the book), leaf 12 (the last paper one) was cancelled. But subsequently, the second vellum leaf, now leaf 13, got lost (missing text from "Anelida"). 8 Hammond provides a nearly complete list of contents in "Omissions." She overlooks a pair of brief Latin items (a prose prayer, f. 245; four verses, f. 256); and Picard's "Divinal," appended to the lyrics associated with Thomas Chaucer on f. 251 v (the last an omission she subsequently made good at "New Year's" 192). On the presentation of "Anelida" and its possible implications, see Edwards. 9 On the life of paper stocks, see the alternatives, ranging from four to fifteen years, outlined at Irigoin 21 — 22. 10 Beauchamp's first wife died on the earlier date, and he married the addressee of his lyric on the second. One might be a bit skeptical about the exactness of the ascription, added later by Shirley, however: Beauchamp's second wife was his cousin's widow, and the marriage, although it produced two children, including a male heir, may have been something of a dynastic convenience. 11 For Anne, countess of Stafford, see GEC 12, i:181 and 2:388. For the standard chronologies of relevant Lydgate works, see Schirmer 31, 37, 59 — 61, 92 — 94, 116 — 118; and Pearsall 71, 83 — 84, 166 — 168. Other named poets appear in the volume. For Thomas Picard, a court musician with previous connections to Edward, duke of York, see Hoccleve 127 (Seymour's suggestion that the "Divinal" refers to Alice Chaucer presumably involves emending "seventeþ" in the first line to "eleveþ," which would give ALEZ). Lowry 331 suggests associating the "Halsham esquyer," to whom Shirley ascribes IMEV 3504 and 3437, with a Haslam who appears in Richard Beauchamp's 1415 muster roll (with Thomas Malory, inter alia ). South identifies this figure as a knight from West Grinstead (Sussex) with no descernible Beauchamp connections, but in either case, there is strong evidence that the poems are Lydgate's, as Bühler argues (568 — 569 and 569 — 570n). 12 The letter was delivered by Sir Thomas Berkeley's last steward, now a Beauchamp dependent, and entered in the bishop's register 1 April 1423. 13 This fastidiousness also appears in the negative: compare Shirley's refusal in lines 66 — 69 to ascribe the Latin prose rule to an author. Only two codices of any of the prose works have anything which approaches Shirley's specificity. Cambridge University Library, MS. Ii.iii.21, although it does not ascribe Boece itself to Chaucer, intercalates into the text two of the poet's lyrics, which are ascribed. An opulent fragment of a Master of Game manuscript, now the property of the Duke of Gloucester, has an ascription, like Shirley's, to "my lorde of ᵹorke," but the author shares billing in the rubric with the patron for whom the manuscript was produced: "The boke made and compilid togedir be the information of Sir Thomas of Kerdeston." But Danielsson (52) believes that Kerdeston acquired his information because he was making over an earlier book, in fact Edward's presentation copy. (His suggestion that the hand is Richard Frampton's should probably be rejected, unless Frampton's textura differed radically from his more usual script.) I am very grateful to the Duke of Gloucester and his steward, Sir Simon Bland, for their generosity and courtesies in allowing me to examine three Middle English hunting manuscripts at Kensington Palace (one of which appears to be Kerdeston's trial run for the more opulent Master manuscript). 14 On Shirley's presence in France (whether he actually left Calais is unclear), see Doyle, "New Light" 94. Richard Beauchamp himself was at Harfleur, but not Agincourt, and greeted the victorious Henry at Calais; cf. Gesta 129n. (For Edward's death — he was one of only two English lords lost in the battle — see 97). 15 Prose contents of Ashmole include a translation of the Secreta secretorum (ff. 1 — 12 v , IPMEP 452); a sequence of translated meditations, primarily on death and including verse, usually transmitted as a unit (ff. 78 — 83 v ; ed. Horstmann 2:367 — 375; IPMEP 491 + 338 + IMEV 4160); and The Three Kings of Cologne (ff. 100 — 130, IPMEP 290). In the third manuscript the prose occurs in the portion at Sion, the translation of de Deguileville, The Pilgrimage of the Lyfe of the Manhode (recently edited by Avril Henry, EETS 288, 292). 16 Doyle extends considerably earlier lists of manuscripts dependent on Shirley in "Unrecognized Piece" and "Court" 177, n. 42; for a more recent summary, see Griffiths 92 — 93. 17 In addition to the ascribed portion of "Anelida," Additional contains two "dirty" poems ascribed but no longer accepted as Chaucer's (IMEV 1635 and 2611) and two unascribed lyrics which still hover on the edge of the canon, "Proverbs" and "A Ballad of Complaint" (IMEV 3914 and 650). 18 I read an earlier version of this paper at the Kalamazoo Medieval Institute, 4 May 1989, at a session dedicated to the memory of Sarah Horrall. I remain particularly grateful to Martha Driver, who organized this occasion, and to the good will of Derek Pearsall, who presided.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Empire of Lucius Iberius by P. J. C. Field</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For centuries, the Arthurian legend included a story of war between King Arthur and the apocryphal Roman Emperor Lucius Iberius. It appears first in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia regum Britanniae , 1 and was included in the reworkings of the Historia by Wace, Layamon, and Robert Mannyng of Brunne. 2 Among those who retold it later were the anonymous author of the Middle English alliterative Morte Arthure and Sir Thomas Malory. They told it very differently, the poet giving an autonomous account of the downfall of a great king and Malory making the story (with a new outcome) a triumphant end to the beginning of King Arthur's reign. Nevertheless, the fact that Malory's story is based on the alliterative Morte and the alliterative Morte on a version of Geoffrey's story makes possible some discoveries about them that have been overlooked until now. This appears most clearly from what may be textually the most corrupt episode in either work, their accounts of Lucius's summons to war. Those accounts derive ultimately from a short list of provinces and peoples in the Historia which looks like a typical stroke of Galfridian historical verisimilitude. 3 Wace re-ordered the list and brought it up to date by replacing Parthia with Turkey, and Layamon and Mannyng used the revised list with a few small changes. 4 The alliterative poet reworked and expanded it, turning it into an elaborate account of the imperial summons and response. He names Turkey rather than Parthia, suggesting that he worked from Wace or a derivative rather than Geoffrey, and adds further material drawn mostly from Mandeville's Travels and a short passage in the Acts of the Apostles. 5 Apart from Arthur's conquests, which he listed in an earlier passage (lines 26 — 47), the places he names embrace what was then almost the whole known world. The result is a visionary tour de force that presents dozens of recognisably real localities in a Miltonic sweep across three continents. Malory seems to have attempted to abbreviate this while keeping as many of the place-names as possible. Both original manuscripts, the alliterative poet's and Malory's, are lost, and what they wrote has to be deduced from three early texts: the unique manuscripts of the alliterative Morte (the Thornton manuscript: T ) and Malory's Morte Darthur (the Winchester manuscript: W ), and Caxton's printed edition of Malory ( C ). 6 The names of the provinces in the three texts and the ultimate chronicle sources are shown in Table I. 7 All three texts show signs of corruption in their presentation of the names: some are simply incomprehensible as they stand. Editors, however, have been distinctly cautious in emendation. Both James Spisak's edition of Malory based on the Caxton text and Eugène Vinaver's editions based on the Winchester manuscript print their base-texts without emendation. 8 Mary Hamel's edition of the alliterative Morte changes only two names: she emends Orcage to Arcage and inserts into her text from W a complete alliterative line containing Calabe and Catelonde , emending the former to Calabre , its form in C . 9 This is a normal spelling of Calabria in Malory's time, 10 and when I revised Vinaver's edition, I too emended Calabe to Calabre ( Works [1990], p. 193). Closer consideration however suggests that dozens of other superior readings may be recoverable. This is partly because of the very factor that generated the corruption — the strangeness of exotic names. When scribes copy exotic and unfamiliar originals, they almost inevitably commit errors, often creating even stranger forms. Strange forms, however, may be the product of very familiar processes of error, and when a plausible lost original is inferred from such a process, it may be apparent that it alone could have generated the extant reading. Passages that contain more errors than usual may therefore be capable of more correction than usual, and so may throw particular light on the mentalities of those who created and transmitted what are (if the Caxton Malory is taken as a distinct literary entity) three important literary texts. Not every conjecture will approach certainty, but even those that are merely probable should be implemented, because it is an editor's duty to correct all corrigible error. As W. W.

Ituria An editor who declines or is unable to exercise his judgement and falls back on some arbitrary canon, such as the authority of the copy-text, is in fact abdicating his editorial function. Yet this is what has been frequently commended as "scientific" — "streng wissenschaftlich" in the prevalent idiom — and the result is that what many editors have done is to produce, not editions of their authors' works at all, but only editions of particular authorities for those works, a course that may be perfectly legitimate in itself, but was not the one they were professedly pursuing. 12 Recovering authentic readings that were not apparent to previous editors, some them distinguished practitioners of their art, may not be easy. It will be assisted in this case, however, by two special factors in the relationships of the texts to one another and their sources. Those relationships may be set out in the following stemma: For clarity's sake, the stemma omits a number of lost intermediate manuscripts posited by Professor Vinaver and Dr Hamel. It includes only (because they are necessary to what follows) the three lost manuscripts assumed to stand in the line of descent from the original manuscript of Morte Arthure to the archetype of the two Malory texts. These are: X , that archetype; E , the Morte Arthure manuscript Malory used; and O , the archetype of the Thornton manuscript and E . The first special factor that may assist correction is that the three texts descend independently from their lost original. 13 Although scribes are much inclined to corrupt unfamiliar names, different scribes often corrupt them in different ways. New possibilities may therefore become apparent if the three versions are used in concert, even when all of them are manifestly corrupt. The second factor is what may be called, since Professor Vinaver set it out with exemplary clarity in his exposition of textual-critical principles and used it to great effect in his editions, the Vinaver Principle (see Works , pp. cxiv — cxvi). That principle is that, when contamination and coincidence can be ruled out, what appears in a writer's source and in an extant version of his text should be assumed to have been in his original. T is not the manuscript of the alliterative Morte that Malory used, 14 but it is often close enough to it to make it possible to apply the Vinaver Principle. An edition of Malory based on the Winchester manuscript can therefore be corrected from agreements between T and the Caxton text, and vice versa. More succinctly, MA + C = M and MA + W = M . On that assumption, I emended another reading in the Winchester manuscript's list of Roman provinces and peoples, the river-name Eufrate , "Euphrates" ( Works , p. 193.6). Although the form Eufrate is attested in Middle English, 15 the simplest and therefore most probable explanation of its appearance in the Winchester manuscript, given Thornton's Ewfrates and Caxton's Eufrates , is that the Winchester scribe committed a common copying error, omitting the last letter of a word in his original. The Vinaver Principle can also be applied to the alliterative Morte : a text based on T can be corrected in the same way from agreements between the poem's sources and Malory. More succinctly, S + M = MA . S is not a single text. It must include not only the place-names in the chronicle sources, but also Mandeville, the passage from Acts, and any other passage the poet used that can be identified and defined with sufficient probability. The need to define the passage has a surprising consequence: the few verses from Acts form a more reliable component of S than Mandeville's Travels because, although the poet took many more names from Mandeville, those names are so scattered through the Travels that it is difficult to be sure which passages he had in mind. Finally, it should be noted that the Vinaver Principle can be applied to the Morte Arthure and the Morte Darthur in series. If contamination and coincidence can be ruled out, what appears in the source of the alliterative poem and in either extant version of Malory's book must be assumed to have been in both the Morte Arthure and the Morte Darthur . These preliminaries disposed of, we can now turn to the place-names themselves. No. I. The first name raises several complex issues. The peculiar readings exhibited by the texts do not much resemble the name of any province, district, or country that could have been thought of as subject or allied to Rome; but a fine stroke of induction led Dr Hamel to a suitable name in a form that could have produced those readings. Observing that several names in the list had a French cast, she suggested that the first name might have been a French form of Albania, 16 perhaps Aubaigne , a possible though unattested form, 17 which could have been corrupted first (by minim error) to Ambaigne in O , and then by further degrees to the readings in each of the extant texts. If this is the Albania in Mandeville rather than Scotland or the modern country on the Adriatic, it is a country near Scythia, fitting in with the overall east-west movement of the passage. This is a plausible suggestion, but it can perhaps be made more plausible still. Since, for phonologically straightforward reasons, initial Alb - sometimes became Amb - in other place-names, 18 we can postulate, without implying error of any kind, that it did so in this one, and that what stood in S was an original French Ambaigne ; and, since fifteenth-century English orthography often prefers y where French would have an i (as in Almaygne "Germany" in T , and Grete Bretaygne in W ), 19 that that Ambaigne perfectly regularly became Ambaygne in MA and O , before corrupting by way of Ambygane (anagramatism) to T 's Ambyganye (normalization of final vowel: cf. Asye, Ermonye, Surrye ), and by way of Ambaygne (omission of macron) to Ambage (simplification of second vowel) in X and the two Malory texts. It should be noticed that although each of the extant forms would be two stages of corruption removed from O , each double corruption could have been perpetrated on a single occasion by a scribe who misread his exemplar and then changed what he thought he read. In the line of descent to the Malory texts, for instance, a scribe might have failed to notice a macron in his exemplar and have corrected an Ambayge that existed only in his own mind. That possibility reduces the number of intermediate manuscripts that would have to be assumed to explain the extant readings, and, for any given number of stages of transmission, correspondingly increases the number of points at which the corruption might have taken place. On the assumptions above, it could have happened at E or M or X or any two of them, and Malory's own manuscript could therefore have contained any of the three readings Ambaygne : Ambayge : Ambage . The practical consequences of this depend on what is accepted as the aim of textual criticism. It is universally agreed that all textual transmission tends to corrupt and that textual criticism exists to purge corruption as far as possible, but scholars have disagreed about what is possible, and in particular about how far an editor should attempt to work his way back along the line of transmission. Any text may of course contain incorrigible errors, but an older school of critics reacted to arbitrary and wilful emendation by their predecessors by proposing various self-denying ordinances restricting what should be attempted at the limits of possibility. 20 Among them, Professor Vinaver, whose Malory editions were among the most distinguished products of that school, asserted that an editor should only aim to reconstruct the earliest written form of his text ( Works , p. cvi). Objections to this have become more apparent as textual criticism has come to be applied systematically to post-Renaissance texts, where information about the publication process frequently survives in quantity. The restriction would require us, for instance, to reproduce spelling mistakes in an author's manuscript, even if a letter from the author to his publisher survived listing the mistakes and asking for them to be corrected in a future edition. This and other considerations have produced wide although not universal agreement that an editor should aim to recover, as far as the evidence permits, what his author finally intended to write. 21 For the Morte Arthure , these disputes have no practical consequences. The hypothesis that manuscript O read Ambaygne provides an acceptable sense and elegantly explains the readings of the three surviving texts. There is no reason to assume that the author either wrote or intended to write anything other than Ambaygne . Since no other hypothesis has been put forward that explains as much as this one, 22 and since it is not in itself a virtue to exhibit the paradosis within the text of a critical edition, 23 such an edition of Morte Arthure must emend to Ambaygne . The implications for Malory's Morte Darthur are more complicated. We do not know what Malory wrote or what he intended to write. Because, as we have seen, the textual tradition below the archetype could have been corrupted at E or M or X or any two of them, Malory's own manuscript could have read Ambaygne or Ambayge or Ambage . It could be argued that we should emend to Ambaygne , because Malory intended that word, even if he never saw it: he was trying to reproduce the reading of the Morte Arthure , which was Ambaygne . There is some force in this: Malory did have a general intention throughout the Morte Darthur to retell the "authorised" Arthurian story, and although that frequently implied intention was compatible with a good deal of invention of his own at many points, even points at which he asserts his explicit dependence on his sources, 24 it is clear that here he is attempting high fidelity rather than re-creation. However, that argument must surely be rejected, not so much to avoid complex argument or editorial self-delusion — individual textual critics may propose, but the scholarly world will dispose — as because it strains the meaning of "authorial intention" to have an author "intend" something dependent on an entity that he may not have known to have existed. We have no reason to suppose that Malory had any notion of the Morte Arthure other than as the sum of the readings of the manuscript he used. It may, however, be possible to resolve the uncertainty in another way. Ambaygne turned into Ambage either in three stages or in two. If it happened in three stages, then assuming the relationships set out in stemma above, the manuscripts involved must have been O → E → M (Case 1), E → M → X (Case 2), or O → EM → X (Case 3). If it happened in two stages, they must have been O → E (Case 4), E → M (Case 5), or M → X (Case 6). In Cases 1 and 3, Malory would have been trying to reproduce Ambayge , in Case 4, Ambage , and in the other three cases, Ambaygne . Ambaygne is therefore the most probable reading, and we should emend to it. Since the stemma is an hypothesis, we cannot be certain that the texts descended in the way it sets out, but as long as the textual relationships it expresses are the most probable, an editor is obliged to act on them. 25 Moreover, even if the stemma is inaccurate, a variant of the argument proposed will hold unless the ratio of the number of stages of transmission before M to those after it was lower in reality than in the stemma. There is no reason to suppose that that was so: there was much more time for multiple copyings during the process that brought the Morte Arthure to Malory than between Malory's composition and the copying of the archetype of W and C . 26 No. 2 . This name presents similar problems, to which Dr Hamel offered a similar and equally satisfying solution, Arcage , a French form of Arcadia that the alliterative poet would have been familiar with from one of his minor sources, and which she assumes to have been transmitted accurately to the archetype of the extant texts, below which T or an ancestor confused the first vowel, and X or an ancestor mistook the second r for c (Hamel, line 572n). This is entirely plausible, and in the absence of any other hypothesis at all, she very properly emended T 's Orcage to Arcage . As in the previous case, this creates complicated problems for the text of Malory, but a solution can be provided on similar lines. The error postulated here must be assumed to have occurred in a single copying process, either O → E (Case 1), or E → M (Case 2), or M → X (Case 3). In Case 1 Malory would have been trying to copy Arrage , and in Cases 2 and 3, Arcage : probability therefore requires us to emend to Arcage . No. 3 . There are two points at issue here. First, the third vowel in W 's Alysundir is suspect because T and C agree against it, because it could easily have been created by the momentary scribal hesitation that Vinaver called arrhythmia , 27 and because it is an unlikely vowel in the name Alexander or any of its derivatives. Alexander and names derived from it are not uncommon in Middle English and French Arthurian literature, but no other form with u alone as the third vowel is recorded anywhere in W or any other text. 28 The only other possible example of the place-name Alexandria in W , when Priamus later in this tale declares himself the heir (apparently) to Alexandria, has the same third vowel as the eighty occurrences of the personal name Alexander: in all cases - au -, the vowel found at the corresponding point in T and C . 29 W 's reading should therefore be emended to - au -. The end of the name also presents problems. The name Alexandria, whatever its other variations, rarely has a vowel between d and r , but it does so in all three texts we are considering, both here and in that later incident involving Priamus. 30 Dr Hamel suggests that the spelling may derive ultimately from a work that she believes to be a minor source of the alliterative poem, The Parliament of the Three Ages , which at one point gives the place-name as Alexaunder (Hamel, 2607n), but The Parliament of the Three Ages is not the only possibility: at least one other English text of Malory's time and from Malory's part of England gives the name as Alisander . 31 Our three texts give it as follows: T W C I. Alysaundyre Alysundir Alysaundrye II. Alexandere Alysaundir Alysaunder It must be kept in mind that in all three texts the sentence before the second occurrence includes the name of Alexander the Great, and that a grammatical ambiguity makes it possible, at some cost to a parallelism with next two phrases, to read the putative place-name as a personal name, making Priamus declare himself the heir to Alexander the Great. The simplest explanation of the six readings is that in both passages the poet wrote Alysaundyre , which T reproduced in the first passage but corrupted in the second by contamination from the personal name five lines earlier; that in both cases Malory simplified Alysaundyre to Alysaundir , which W reproduced imperfectly in the first passage and accurately in the second; and that C deliberately corrected Alysaundir in the first passage, but failed to do so in the second, perhaps misled by the factors that had misled Thornton. It follows that an edition of Malory, whichever text it is based on, should read Alysaundir in both passages. That, however, is not the only kind of edition that could be based on the texts we are considering. Mediaeval romance does not always have a single identifiable author. Scribes produced rewritings, revisions, recensions, and remaniements of many kinds, and with some romances — the Old French prose Tristan is a notable case in point — it is difficult to know when a scribe ceases to be an unauthorized tamperer with someone else's composition and becomes instead the author of a new work. The two works under consideration here do have clearly identifiable authors, the anonymous alliterative poet in the one case and Sir Thomas Malory in the other, but it would nevertheless be perfectly proper to edit Thornton's Morte Arthure not as, in Greg's phrase, a particular authority for Morte Arthure , but as Thornton's work for its own sake. Similarly, the Caxton text of the Morte Darthur could be edited as Caxton's work. There is no apparent reason for an edition of Thornton's work, but an edition of Caxton's could be justified by his fame as a publisher, translator, and man of letters, and the fact that it was his Morte Darthur that became an English prose classic in the sixteenth century and again in the nineteenth. The text he published, by a mixture of unconscious error and deliberate alteration, was significantly different from the one that Malory wrote. It was even he who (by mistake) gave Malory's book its memorable and misleading name. To edit this passage as Caxton's prose would produce different conclusions about a good many of the names in it. Re-running the probabilities for the first two names suggests that Caxton was trying to reproduce ambage and arrage : an editor should therefore keep those forms, glossing them perhaps as "unknown (? Eastern) countries." Alysaundrye , in contrast, looks like a deliberate alteration. Many of the differences between Caxton's Morte Darthur and Malory's, particularly in the Roman War story, are the product of such alterations by Caxton himself, 32 which makes it reasonable, when there is no evidence to the contrary, to attribute to Caxton any apparent conscious correction in C. Alysaundrye is an entirely plausible conscious correction: it looks like a form that would have been recognised as authentic in the merchant community in which Caxton lived. An editor editing C as Caxton's own prose should therefore keep it. In the later passage, the editor would have to choose whichever of Alysaunder, Alysaundir , and Alysaundrye he thought Caxton intended to write. 33 The choice would not be easy, 34 and it is fortunately not necessary to decide it here, but if Caxton's change to Alysaunder was deliberate, he presumably meant it to mean "Alexander." It is more difficult to be sure what Malory understood by Alysaundir : at least in the first passage he presumably thought of it as a place-name, but he may have meant only "whatever obscure place in the Near East was intended by the knowledgeable author of my source." Nos 5 — 7, 12, 19, 20, 27, 29, 40 and 47 . In no. 5, the Vinaver Principle suggests that the initial h - in C 's hermonye is scribal, and it looks likely to have been added by conscious choice. The change might have been made in confusion by a scribe as muddled about Armenia as Malory may have been about Alexandria, or it might be a normalization to the scribe's own orthography, something that is the more likely in that Caxton seems to have systematically modified the Morte Darthur towards his own linguistic norms. 35 In either case, an edition of Caxton's prose should keep it, because Caxton may be the "scribe" who made the change or chose to let it stand. Such an edition would reverse the change only in unlikely circumstances — if, for instance, it were demonstrable that it was primarily caused by distraction by the word harmony . If C were edited as Malory's work, however, things might be different. If the change were shown to be the product of confusion, it would simply be reversed, but "translation" into another dialect would raise the complicated and important issue of restoring authors' linguistic norms. To do so at this point in this work might imply millions of other changes elsewhere. Such restoration is rarely attempted with early texts, because the surviving witnesses are often the product of long copying traditions, in the course of which it is natural to assume that the author's orthography and other accidentals (the presentational features of the text) have been irrecoverably lost, leaving the substantives (the words themselves) as the only subject for textual criticism. In mediaeval vernacular texts, moreover, orthography is often notably uncertain, and rarely shows any sign that a scribe felt bound by the spelling of his exemplar. In the formative years of modern textual criticism, some pioneers suggested that an editor's duty of restoring as far as possible what the author intended to write extended to systematic restoration of the author's dialect and orthography: some heroic souls even attempted to put this into practice, but their editions were widely felt to be unreliable. 36 Since then editorial practice has varied. Some editors have chosen to standardize readings imported from other texts and any spelling errors they identified to the norms of their base-texts. 37 Others have preferred to reproduce their authorities except when the evidence seemed to warrant emending individual scribal spellings to authorial ones, as both Professor Vinaver and Dr Hamel do on occasion. 38 The problem may be soluble, at least in principle. If textual criticism exists to recover what the author intended to write, a critical edition must attempt to recover the author's accidentals unless the evidence for doing so is insufficient, or unless there is reason to suppose the author was indifferent to a particular feature. Although there is rarely any evidence of authorial preferences for the accidentals of an early text, it may sometimes be reasonable to suppose from the practice of the period and genre that an author would probably have been content to leave some of them to his scribes to decide. Both parties may have been as well aware as any modern scholar that part of the meaning of a work will be conveyed by the mise en page of the manuscript in which it is contained; but both the variety of presentation found in surviving mediaeval manuscripts and the analogy with modern publishing suggest that mediaeval authors would often have been willing, perhaps even eager, to delegate, for instance, the number of columns and lines per page, the scripts used, the amount of abbreviation, and other "publication details" to professionals. That might be less likely with (say) a multi-level commentary on a book of the Bible or a multi-coloured genealogical scroll setting out the royal claim to the throne, where fundamental decisions about what was to be said might require a grasp of the physical possibilities of manuscripts, a grasp that might normally be accompanied by preferences about the use of those possibilities; but it would be much more likely with a vernacular prose romance composed by a manifestly nonprofessional author. Orthography, however, is a skill that — dictation apart — an author must possess. Of all scribal skills, it is the one on which an author is most likely to have had preferences, and for that reason, and also because of its implications for the semantic ambiguities and sound patterns of a work, it is the one that would generally be most desirable to recover. There are, however, problems in this with Malory's work. No other written material survives against which linguistic norms suggested by the surviving texts of the Morte Darthur could be cross-checked. I have argued that Malory wrote a second romance, The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell , but it is very difficult to detect beneath the dialect of the scribe of the only surviving manuscript of that work any feature of the dialect of its author. 39 Moreover, Malory's identity has been disputed, 40 so an editor cannot infer features of Malory's language not evident in his base-text from a knowledge of his author's origins. Any attempt to do so might need a good deal of biographical knowledge: one of the men suggested as author of the Morte Darthur , for instance, was born near Shrewsbury in the far West Midlands but apparently spent his adult life at Papworth St Agnes in the East Midlands; 41 since nothing indisputably written by him survives, there is no telling whether his English was West Midland, East Midland, a mixture of the two, or something entirely different. Another candidate, Thomas Malory of Hutton Conyers in Yorkshire, in contrast, is associated only with that place. 42 An editor who accepted him as author would have to face the argument that an edition of the Morte Darthur , whatever its base-text, should in principle be "translated" into the orthography of north Yorkshire. One who accepted Sir Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel as author would similarly have to explain why an edition based on C should not be "translated" into the orthography of the Newbold Revel area. One of the reasons for basing editions of the Morte Darthur on W is that both its scribes came from near that place. 43 It may, however, be felt with Malory, as has often been felt with other authors, that, desirable as it might be to recover his orthography as a whole, the benefits of doing so would be exceeded by the risk of getting it wrong. If so, an editor must surely do with orthography as he does with substantives: recover as many individual earlier spellings as far back in the tradition as he can. Because the available evidence is likely to be both limited and patchy, he may have to accept the readings of his copy-text almost all the time, and his few improvements may reproduce the orthography of different stages of the tradition in different places. That is no reason for not emending: exactly the same will have happened with the individual words of his text. Where earlier spellings cannot be recovered, the editor may properly correct misspellings and imported readings to the norms of his base-text. On these principles, the lexicographical evidence for early spellings of Armenia seems to suggest omitting the initial h - in hermonye from an edition of C as Malory's work. The same principles also provide a yardstick for six other small sets of variants in nos 7, 12, 19, 27, 40, and 47. Capitalising the differences, C has one letter more in aufFryke and pampoylLe , one fewer in arRabye , and different letters in tarCE, macYdone , and spaynardYs . Comparison with T sheds no light on tarCE, macYdone , or spaynardYs , but raises the possibility that C might have preserved the reading of the archetype in aufFryke , and W in pampoylLe and arRabye . It is tempting, for instance, in the light of T and C 's - ff -, to emend W 's Aufryke to Auffryke . These variants, however, might be spellings preferred by Malory and Caxton respectively: W gives the name on one other occasion, as Aufrike , and Caxton uses it once elsewhere in his own prose, as Auffryke . 44 Even if they are not, f/ff variations in the spelling of Africa are so common elsewhere that coincidence cannot be ruled out. The other variants too could have been produced by a scribe or compositor's need to adjust the length of his line, or by scribal whims of the most ephemeral kind. It seems best therefore to retain the reading of the copy in all these cases. Although the original accidentals may not be recoverable in the cases above, applying the Vinaver Principle to nos 5, 6, and 29 suggests the scribe of W or a predecessor simplified the ending of the name to - y in two cases and to - e in the other from an original - ye , representing the Latin - ia . That conclusion makes three other readings suspect. An original - ye may also have been reduced in nos 12 and 20 to - e in W and to - y in T , and in no 40 to - y in W and to - e in T and C . There is some support for this in Mandeville's Travels : one good edition of the Middle English text gives the six names in forms found in these three texts, except that they all end in - ye . 45 This, I suggest, justifies emendation to - ye throughout: in three cases in T , six in W , and one in C ; but in W , the emendation for Asia should be to Asye , the full form in both the other texts. An edition of Caxton's prose, however, should retain C 's Macydone : it is similar to the form Caxton uses elsewhere and might well be a compromise between that form and the spelling in his copy-text (see Mizobata, s.v. Macedone ). No. 9 . This is Hyrcania, in three forms, since Irrttayne is a correction: Thornton first wrote Irrttanye , then corrected it to Irrttayne (Hamel, line 575n). That reading is apparently the product of a series of separate changes to different parts of the name that need separate consideration. The - ayne ending must in one sense be a corruption, since the - ia of Hyrcania ought also to be represented by - ye , as its counterpart is in two of the four previous names in T . Thornton seems first to have normalized it (much as someone normalized the first name of all to Ambyganye ) and then corrected what he had written. His careful correction gives us confidence that in that respect the corrected form exactly reproduces his exemplar; and the reading of the Malory texts confirms that the - ayne ending goes back to the archetype, if (as Dr Hamel argues on other grounds) the exemplar was not the archetype. The preceding consonant is both right and wrong in a similar way but at an even longer remove: the c/t error is common in late mediaeval English and French scripts, but the existence of a form Hirtanye in a number of manuscripts of Mandeville 46 strongly suggests that in this case the error comes from the poet's source. In the first syllable, the dropping of initial h - and the y → i change may be not a copying error but a deliberate alteration by the author or one of the scribes of the poem or its source: such changes are common in Middle English. Finally there is Thornton's - rrtt -. This seems to be a kind of dittography, since the Mandeville and Malory texts agree in - rt -, and the occasional doubling of letters is a recognised although irregular feature of Thornton's work, in other texts as well as in this one (Hamel, pp. 66 — 67). One has to say "a kind of" dittography, since the term implies unconscious error, and this phenomenon looks like the product of conscious although inconsistent preference. We can hardly doubt that the archetype read - rt -. The most economical explanation of the evidence is to postulate Hirtanye in S and Irtayne in O , consciously changed to Irrttayne in T and to Ertayne in the Malory texts. The latter change must be presumed to be by Malory, and so should be preserved in any edition of the Morte Darthur , but T 's Irrttayne is a more complicated matter. The initial H - might be restored, but dropping it was probably a conscious change, which may well be by the author: it should therefore stand. The - anye / -ayne variation, on the other hand, looks like a case of difficilior lectio , the unconscious substitution of a more familiar sequence of letters for a less familiar one: it is probable that the poet intended - anye , and that therefore is the form we should give. Finally, the medial - rrtt - is plainly an orthographic variant, and almost certainly (as we have seen) Robert Thornton's. It follows from what was argued above that the only kind of edition of Morte Arthure that ought to keep such eccentric letter-duplications would be one edited as Thornton's rather than the original poet's; but although there is a case for a Caxton Morte Darthur , none has yet been made for a Thornton Morte Arthure . We should therefore sacrifice the scribe to the author, and emend to Irtanye . 47 On the same grounds, we should emend Amazonnes (no. 22) to Amazones , 48 and, among the common nouns, tythynnges (line 582) to tythynges . No. II . This is not a name at all. The Caxton text omits it, but neither T nor W gives owte ilez / oute yles the initial capitals they give to all the other items on the list above. Presumably both scribes and both authors intended the phrase to be a description, not a name. Professor Vinaver and I failed to see this. He supplied and I kept initial capitals that imply the phrase is a name: these should be removed. Presenting the phrase as a description should help to avoid confusion between these islands tributary to Rome and other sets of "out islands" in the Morte Darthur , such as those under the lordship of Ywayne and Ider, which Malory mentions in a passage a little earlier in this tale, in his account of Arthur's forces. 49 No. 15 . This again illustrates the c/t error. The concurrence of T and C in the final consonant suggests a reading Damyat both in O and in X . The scribe of W or a predecessor will have misread the final - t as a - c which he deliberately changed to a preferred - ke , and the compositor of C or a predecessor will have read the word rightly but deliberately varied - at to - ete , perhaps because whoever recognized Alexandria earlier also recognized Damietta here. Morte Arthure 's reading Damyat should therefore stand, and any Malory edition be emended to it, but an edition of Caxton's prose should keep the reading of C . Nos 16 — 17 . The problems presented by these names need to be set in context. The Morte Arthure , having given thirteen places in the East Marches to which the emperor has sent messengers, begins a new sequence of places from which troops come to the emperor with Of Damaske and Damyat the dukes and erles 50 Malory, who has been following his source very closely, gives all thirteen names in the first sequence and then effectively reproduces (apart from interjecting his favourite adjective) the first line of the second sequence: to Damaske and Damyat, to noble deukis and erlys 51 He continues with three of the poem's next four names, before omitting the four after that. The most natural explanation of the absence of this latter quartet of names is that his copy of the poem lacked the lines of the poem in which those names appeared, lines 583 — 586. The absence of other names later (numbers 38 and 41 — 43, from lines 597 and 604 — 605 respectively) might also be due to the loss of whole lines. The end-stopped style of alliterative poetry makes line-loss particularly easy. Athough Robert Thornton was a careful copyist, his manuscript has lost both individual lines and groups of lines (Hamel, p. 4). Those lines may have been lost by an earlier copyist less conscientious than Thornton himself, but there is no reason to suppose that the manuscript Malory used was copied in fewer stages or by more careful scribes. We cannot therefore suppose that it would have been exempt from such accidents. Crete , however, is not likely to have been lost by the omission of a line, since Cappadocia, the other name in the same line of the Thornton manuscript, appears in both Malory texts. It would be natural to assume instead that Malory's eye skipped from one similar-looking form to another, were it not for C 's Cayer . The most conspicuous features of the entire Caxton Morte Darthur are the shortening of this tale and the reduction of its alliteration, and it would be surprising if Caxton (as Vinaver thought [ Works , p. 1666]) or any of his predecessors had added to it, and done so alliteratively. It is much more likely that Malory himself altered Crete to Cairo, and that the scribe of W or a predecessor lost the name by homoeoteleuton, presumably as part of a phrase. The Christian island of Crete might well have seemed to Malory less topical and less in keeping with the theme of his story than Cairo, the capital of Moslem Egypt, which in his own lifetime had sent three fleets out to conquer the Christian outpost of Rhodes. Malory indeed had personal reasons to be interested in Egyptian operations against Rhodes. In his youth, his kinsman Sir Robert Malory, Prior of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England, had taken a force out to Rhodes to resist another anticipated invasion by the Sultan of Egypt. 52 That invasion never materialised, but a decade later another Malory, who may also have been a close kinsman of Sir Thomas's, was in Rhodes during the Egyptian seige of 1444. 53 Before suggesting a wording, however, we need to consider the next name. No. 18 . It is a more economical postulate that the middle vowel of Capados was altered by the scribe of W or a predecessor than that it was altered by Malory and altered back again by Caxton's compositor or a predecessor. The latter would not only double the number of alterations, but require that whoever made the second alteration should either have hit upon T 's vowel by chance, or have recognized and known how to spell Cappadocia. It seems best, therefore, on the pattern of the next sentence in W , to emend W 's kynge of Capydos to read kynge of Cayer, and of Capados . No. 19 . From the variants, we must assume Malory altered Tartary to Tars . All the reference works assume Tars means Tarsus, 54 St Paul's city in Asia Minor, which in ancient times, before it silted up, was a well-known port — it was the scene of Cleopatra's famous meeting with Antony. If Malory made the change, one might speculate, particularly with the change from Crete to Cairo in mind, that he did so thinking of or even alluding to something about the Levant, perhaps something bearing on the fortunes of the Knights Hospitallers. It is not, however, apparent why Tars should mean Tarsus. The verse-line requires a kingdom to balance Turkey, whereas in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries Tarsus was a mere possession of the kingdom of Lesser Armenia. In Middle English, however, cloth of tars was a well-known type of rich cloth, and it seems more likely that the Tars intended here is the place that cloth of tars came from. The difficulty is that nobody then or now seems to have been very clear about where that was. Among the places of origin suggested have been Tartary, and Tarshish as Mandeville seems to understand it, as a part of Tartary, both of which have the advantage of being kingdoms, 55 but it is quite possible that whoever was responsible for the place-name knew no more than that Tars was remote, exotic, and probably oriental. Nos 25 — 26 . These names at first sight suggest that Malory wanted to alter the name in his source, as he apparently did with Crete and Tartary; but that here, as with Tartary, W did not lose its reading. Perce seems a very plausible name for Morte Arthure . It is very frequent in Mandeville: of the names listed above, only India and Arabia occur more frequently in the standard text. 56 Textual criticism, however, must attempt to explain both the plausible and the implausible readings in any group; and in that context the very plausibility of Perce makes it suspect. There is nothing in the Morte Darthur to explain why Malory should have substituted Pontus for Persia. Pontus occur nowhere else in the Morte Darthur , but it is one of the names in Acts ii.9 — and Pamphilia, which follows it in the next verse of Acts, follows it in the same verse in Morte Arthure . It looks therefore as if Pounce was the reading of O and that Thornton or a predecessor substituted Perse. Pounce looks in fact like a classic case of difficilior lectio : an obscure word displaced by a better known word of similar meaning and form. The similarity is so close that the substitution could have been unconscious. T 's Perse , therefore, should be emended to Pounce . Nos 30 — 31 . These names also set T and W in opposition, but in this case T 's obvious rightness is genuine, whereas W 's Nero is not even a place-name. There can be no question of Nero being a variant or a gloss: it looks like a substitution by a reader in whose copy of Morte Arthure the word Nylus was illegible, or who perhaps repudiated it as incomprehensible. Since the rest of the line alliterated on n -, he supplied from limited classical knowledge a name that he believed to be suitable. The word has disappeared from C , perhaps as part of a process of selective weeding of the less likely names, a process we may reasonably attribute to Caxton himself. Unfortunately, there are insufficient grounds for emending W to Nylus . We must assume that O read Nylus , and that Nero was introduced by the scribe of E , or by Malory himself, or by the scribe of X . If the first, Malory reproduced efficiently the information provided in his source, if the second, he deliberately chose to introduce the word, and we have no right to improve what he wrote. If the third, we should emend, but the odds are two to one against emendation. Since the probabilities are that Nero , though a poor reading, is Malory's own, even a Malory edition based on Caxton should (unfortunately) insert it, though an edition of Caxton's prose would be entitled to leave it out. Nos 32 — 35 . The least unsatisfactory archetypal readings proposed so far for no. 33 are Gerasa and Gaddrys (Hamel, line 592n). Both are places in the Holy Land that alliterate on the right letter. W 's Garese might derive from by Gerasa by vowel metathesis: but vowel metathesis is not common in W or generally, and Gerasa has not been cited in any source known to be available to the poet of Morte Arthure. Garese might derive instead from a variant of Gaddrys, Gadres , by the loss of medial d and the addition of final - e . The first of those two changes may seem arbitrary, but the second could easily have been a reflex — a great majority of names in the passage probably originally ended in - e — and Gadres would have been available in a source from which the poet derived a substantial later incident and from which he may have taken the second name in this passage. 57 Gadres might therefore seem a strong contender, were it not that it, like Gerasa and every other suggested form, does nothing to explain T 's Garyere . It is difficult to have confidence in an hypothesis that does not explain the readings of all the texts. C 's Gallacye might, as Dr Hamel tentatively suggested, be a conflation of Garese and Galily . Someone who was prepared to correct the spelling of Alexandria and Damietta would presumably have been prepared to correct a third name in the same passage. It is notable that this is the only part of the passage in which C fails to reproduce names that appear in W . We might suspect an illegible or damaged copy, but that is unlikely. In the part of the passage where the omissions occur, whoever was responsible for C was able to read the name of Syria, and was also able to read enough of Nazareth or Galilee to be prompted to a replacement name that not only alliterated with the nearest two names that disappeared, but was also from the right part of the world and from the same part of the Bible. It looks as if somebody who has been reproducing the list with some care has decided to purge it on three criteria: he did not want names that were textually corrupt or manifestly legendary or from the Holy Land. His single replacement, Galatia, though named several times in the New Testament, 58 is not in the Holy Land. The impulse suggested would also explain the disappearance of the outer isles (no. 11) and Prester John's land (no. 28). This can only be a guess, but if it is accurate, the leading suspect must be Caxton himself, both because he shortened Malory's Roman War story, and because some other passages in C suggest he may have been prepared to make good what he felt was Malory's casualness on sacred subjects. 59 An editor of Caxton's prose would keep gallacye , but an editor of a Malory edition based on C ought therefore to substitute Nazareth, Garese , and Galely (even though one of them may be nonsense), and restore the oute yles and Preter Johanes londe because they are more likely to be what Malory wrote. Nos 36 — 37 and 39 . The agreement in the order of names between T and W suggests that C has transposed Cyprus and Greece, and therefore that a Malory edition based on C should reverse that order, although an edition of Caxton's prose should keep it, since it may represent Caxton's preference. Nos 46 — 47 . In W Calabria and Catalonia, the predecessors of these two names, appear in a passable line of alliterative verse. Dr Hamel introduced that line into the text of T because she thought neither Malory nor the scribe of E was likely to have invented names that were so unfamiliar, and or to have put them into alliterative verse. She rejected Portugal and Spain, however, although they seem to preserve the shadow of an alliterative line, because they were more obvious, and suggested that Malory invented them to replace the pagan Prussians and Lithuanians, who in his time were no longer topical. On these grounds she placed the line about Calabria and Catalonia before T 's lines naming Apulia, Prussia, and Lithuania. There is force in this, but it does not allow for three things that have come to light in this essay. Most important to the point immediately at issue is that all the four chronicle sources include Spain: since Spain is in a source and a derived version of Morte Arthure , without a more compelling reason for Malory to have invented it than has yet been offered, the most reasonable assumption is that Spain was also in the intermediate text, the Morte Arthure itself. Second, our examination reveals great differences between somewhat superficially similar treatment of their sources by Malory and Caxton. Caxton apparently omitted seven names supplied by Malory, most and perhaps all probably because he thought them suspect in one way and another. Those omissions and the names he improved and supplied all look like the product of a more critical temper and a better geographical sense than Malory possessed, based on real commercial knowledge of the world. Malory, in contrast, apparently saw his source as an "authorised" repository of Arthurian story, and his primary urge seems to have been to reproduce what it said. The most plausible explanation for the absence of eight names from his book is that they were absent from his source as well. In the remaining more than thirty cases he apparently reproduced his source's names, some of them very obscure and far from topical, as accurately as he could. Three small attempts at improvement that we may attribute to him, replacing Crete and Tartary and Nylus by Cairo and Tars and "Nero," show him less skilful and less ruthless than Caxton, and make one wonder if his changes were so limited not only because of his respect for his source but because he knew he did not know enough about distant places to improve on it. 60 Either motive would make it unlikely that he would add new names, nor is it particularly probable that any he added would have taken even approximately the form of lines of alliterative verse. Finally, it may be suggested that Spain and Portugal bring the poet's splendid list of Roman vassals and allies to a particularly appropriate close. Three dozen lines ending in Lithuania would have been an anti-climax: late mediaeval England knew of more exotic places further away than Lithuania. Anti-climax is difficult to reconcile with the rhetorical artistry that Dr Hamel herself has shown the poet to have displayed in this very passage. The poet who began his sweep evocatively with the Orient itself (in line 571) and worked westward across three continents had a sense of form that demanded he should work to some proportionate conclusion. A sequence ending with Spain and Portugal shows the Roman Empire and its spheres of influence stretching from the extreme east to — give or take an Atlantic island or two — the extreme west of the known world; 61 and even without the support of the chronicle sources, that alone, it seems to me, would be a sufficient basis for believing that this section of the Morte Arthure should conclude after line 605 of the Thornton manuscript with two supernumerary lines containing Malory's phrases about Calabria, Catalonia, Portugal, and Spain.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Seventeenth-Century Acknowledgement of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight in an Early Catalogue of the Cottonian Library by Paul F. Reichardt</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The traditional view of the textual history of the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (hereafter Gawain ) is that it lay undetected among the leaves of what is now called the Pearl Manuscript (folios 37 — 126 of British Library MS Cotton Nero A.x.) until the early nineteenth century. Support for this view is found in catalogues of the Cottonian collection dating from the seventeenth century. The most widely known of these, compiled by the Reverend Thomas Smith, librarian to Sir John Cotton (grandson of Sir Robert Cotton, the bibliophile who assembled the collection which bears his name), was published in 1696 under the title Catalogus Librorum Manuscriptorum Bibliothecae Cottonianae . Smith's description of MS Nero A.x. contains this entry: 3. Poema in lingua veteri Anglicana, in quo sub insomnii figmento, ad religionem, pietatem, &amp; vitam probam hortatur Auctor: interspersis quibusdam historicis, &amp; picturis, majoris illustrationis gratia, subinde additis. (49 — 50) Use of the singular form poema in this description suggests that Smith believed folios 37 — 126 of the codex contained a single text, and in this belief he was following the treatment accorded the Pearl Manuscript by earlier Cottonian lists and by a catalogue listing books owned by Henry Savile of Banke (now BL MS Harley 1879, dated 1607 or earlier by Watson [14]), from whom Cotton obtained this small volume of alliterative poetry. The Savile list refers to "An owld booke in English verse beginninge Perle pleasant to Princes pay in 4 . Limned" (fol. 8 v ; Watson 68). Long afterward, in 1802, a revised catalogue of the Cottonian collection compiled for the British Museum by Joseph Planta still refers to the Pearl texts in MS Nero A.x. in the singular: "a poem [emphasis mine] in old English on religious and moral subjects; with some paintings rudely executed. . . . Begins 'Perle pleasaunt to prynces paye. . .'" (204). It is little wonder that Sir Frederick Madden, the first modern scholar to edit Gawain as a separate text, asserts in his 1839 edition of the poem ( Syr Gawayne, A Collection of Ancient Romance Poems ) that it had fallen into "oblivion" for a considerable period of time as a result of having been "confounded with the previous one[s]" in its codex (299). Sir Israel Gollancz codified this view some fifty years afterward when he wrote of the Pearl texts: The difficulty of the language of these poems and the strangeness of their script is no doubt answerable for the treatment they received at the hands of the old cataloguers of the Cottonian collection; probably few modern scholars before Warton, Conybeare, and Madden knew more of the poems than the first page of the manuscript and from this they hastily inferred that the whole was a continuous poem. The purpose of this note is to modify the long-accepted notion of Gawain 's oblivion prior to the work of nineteenth-century scholars like Madden by pointing out evidence that the poem was recognized by at least one reader some two hundred years earlier. This evidence is found in an early seventeenth-century Cottonian catalogue whose description of the contents of MS Nero A.x. stands in marked contrast to entries for the same volume in other lists of the library's holdings. To see this particular catalogue in its proper context, it is necessary to take account of the conclusions of Colin G. C. Tite regarding the history of the Cottonian catalogues. Tite has identified no fewer than twenty-three manuscripts containing lists of the Cotton Library's holdings. The earliest of these is Cotton Faustina C.ii. (dated 1600) and the most recent is Planta's 1802 volume (Smith 13 — 14). Among the earlier catalogues on Tite's list is one on folios 1 — 145 v of BL MS Harley 6018 and it is this catalogue's description of MS Nero A.x. which has puzzled scholars since it appears to contradict treatments of the same codex in other Cottonian catalogues. Tite believes the date of the MS Harley 6018 list included in its title, Catalogus Librorum Manuscriptorum in Bibliotheca Roberti Cottoni 1621 , refers to the year compilation began, and states, on the basis of the catalogue's inclusion of a volume known to have been acquired in 1623, that the catalogue must have been completed at least two years after this date (146; Smith 13). A date of composition in the 1620s or early 1630s is likely for this list considering the fact that identification of volumes according to the "emperor sequence" (i.e. use of Roman emperor names in the titles assigned to volumes) was added later, in darker ink, in the right margin beside original entries. This feature indicates that the MS Harley 6018 catalogue was annotated several years after it was begun since, as Tite points out, the first catalogue to employ emperor titles was not completed until the late 1630s (147). Entry 279 of the MS Harley 6018 list contains the following reference: "2. Gesta Arthury regis et aliorum versu anglico." Written beside the four items in this entry by the later hand is the notation "Nero: A: 10". That this identification is no mistake is proved by the remainder of the contents list for the volume: an oration by Justus de Justis (Item 1), a "Tractatus theologus" (Item 3), and an epitaph for Randolphus, abbot of Ramsey Abbey (Item 4). These same three items are present in MS Cotton Nero A.x. as we know it today and therefore only the reference to a narrative concerned with King Arthur seems inconsistent with familiar descriptions of its contents. This apparent inconsistency may be explained if the item referring to a "Gesta Arthury regis" in the Harley 6018 catalogue is understood as a description of Gawain , and the phrase "aliorum versu anglico" is taken as an allusion to the presence of the other three Pearl poems. This description of the contents of the Pearl Manuscript would make the Harley 6018 catalogue of the Cottonian Library unique in its use of Gawain rather than Pearl as the reference text for identifying the section of Middle English verse included in MS Nero A.x. But why would this catalogue select Gawain as the focus of its description rather than using Pearl , as did other Cottonian catalogues? Since Pearl stands first among the four Middle English poems found in MS Nero A.x., it would seem simpler, in accordance with the logic employed by its sister catalogues, to cite the opening lines of the initial text to identify this section of the volume. It is possible however to deduce plausible motives for the preference shown to Gawain in the Harley 6018 catalogue entry. According to Tite, the Harley 6018 catalogue, along with two other early Cottonian catalogues, Faustina C.ii. and Additional 35213, are "the only lists which can, with certainty, be dated to Cotton's lifetime" (147). This point is confirmed by the fact that among the hands detected on the pages of the 1621 catalogue is that of Sir Robert himself (Tite 146 — 147; Sharpe 69 — 70). Cotton's role in compiling the Harley 6018 catalogue may offer a fairly cogent explanation for its reference to Gawain rather than Pearl in the contents list for volume "Nero: A: 10". It is known that Cotton's acquisition of books was influenced by his antiquarian interests and by the patriotic concerns of the age in which he lived, an age in which both Crown and Church were interested in recovering and preserving historical documents that would lend support to contemporary institutions and policies. Cotton's collection included extensive holdings of "ancient" Saxon manuscripts, as well as a "wealth of material for ecclesiastical history; the history of families, offices, and institutions; and the story of the Kings of England from Saxon times" (Sharpe 54). While an old English poem on the subject of King Arthur does not fall directly into the category of historical documents useful to civil or ecclesiastical authorities, it may reflect Cotton's interest in England's legendary past and his sense of patriotism, for Arthur, despite his flaws, was usually associated with the glory of England and with the virtues of those who ruled the Isle. One thing is certain: everything we know about Robert Cotton suggests that his reading interests tended more to history than to theology. This fact alone may help explain why, if he were involved in composing a description of the Pearl Manuscript for the catalogue contained in MS Harley 6018, a reference to an Arthurian narrative would be more likely to appear than one citing the ghostly vision of Pearl . But assuming Item 2 of Entry 279 in the Harley 6018 catalogue reflects the preference of Robert Cotton himself (or a reader with similar tastes) for Arthurian legend over religious verse raises a second question about the contents being described. Why does Item 2, if indeed it is a reference to Gawain , call the poem a work about King Arthur rather than one about Gawain, as might be expected? In responding to this question, it must be borne in mind that although modern readers may consider any title for Gawain that does not include the hero's name a misnomer, there are no titles of any sort in the surviving manuscript of the Pearl poems. The title Sir Gawain and the Green Knight was coined by Madden for his edition of the poem. Therefore a seventeenth-century reader, coming upon the poem in its manuscript and seeing no title written at the head of the text, would be forced to invent a title appropriate to what was written on its pages. This being the case, it is pertinent to note that a reader of Gawain encounters references to Arthur at least nine times (as a proper name or in the designation "þe king") before Gawain is first mentioned more than one hundred lines into the text. A reader in search of a title for the poem and familiar with its initial stanzas might easily conclude the work was about the legendary king and describe it as such in a brief notation of its subject matter. A final problem related to the listing of contents for "Nero: A: 10" in the Harley 6018 Cottonian catalogue is that the item describing a story about King Arthur is listed second, despite the fact that in later Cottonian catalogues such as that of Smith, the Pearl Manuscript is normally listed third, the position it occupied when discovered by Madden. It may be noted however that the Cottonian catalogue in BL MS Additional 36682, which follows Harley 6018 by at least a decade, antedates the authoritative listing of Thomas Smith by some sixty years, and is the first list to employ the emperor sequence to identify volumes, also places the Pearl poems second in the list of contents for MS Nero A.x., though it does identify the poems by reference to Pearl rather than Gawain : "2. Vetus poema Anglicanum, in quo sub insomnii figmento multa ad religionem et mores spectantia explicantur" (fol. 114). Tite speculates that the catalogue in Additional 36682 "may have been started before Sir Robert's death" in 1631, and other commentators, including Madden, attribute it to Richard James, Robert Cotton's own librarian (xlvii). Since the Pearl poems constitute the third text in the Cotton Nero A.x. volume as we know it today, one of two hypotheses must be employed to resolve this problem. The first is that the volume was split and its contents rearranged or altered sometime between 1621 and the 1630s. However there is no reference to such an alteration in the records of the Cottonian collection nor does the appearance of the volume itself provide physical evidence to substantiate this view. Nevertheless, the idea that the Pearl Manuscript was not included in the original contents of Cotton Nero A.x. seems to have been accepted by eminent scholars of the history of the Cottonian collection. For example, Andrew G. Watson has written that ". . . other items in Nero A.x. are listed in Cotton's 1621 catalogue (Harley 6018, fol. 112 v ) but the present item [i.e. the 'owld book in English verse beginning Perle pleasant to Princes pay' referred to in the Savile catalogue] is not mentioned" (68). Similarly, C. E. Wright concluded that in MS Harley 6018 "neither the Beowulf MS (Vitellius A.xv) nor the Pearl and Sir Gawain MS (Nero A.x.) are identifiable" (199). An alternative and I believe preferable hypothesis for explaining the list of contents for "Nero A:x" in Harley 6018 is that this catalogue's sequence is inaccurate and that this same inaccuracy was appropriated uncritically a decade later by the Additional 36682 listing of Cotton's books. Eventually, however, it was noticed that items two and three in the entry were reversed and the error was corrected by the time of Smith's catalogue of 1696. In my view, the hypothesis of an inaccurate ordering of contents for MS Nero A.x. in the Harley 6018 and Additional 36682 catalogues offers a simple and straightforward explanation of this discrepancy, one which is also fully consistent with the physical evidence of the MS Nero A.x. volume itself and the history of the Cottonian collection as we know it. According to this hypothesis, the Pearl poems were indeed present in the volume when the catalogue of 1621 was compiled but were described by that catalogue in a manner which effectively concealed their presence from scholars who expected to find a reference to the text of Pearl . All things considered, the evidence of Entry 279 of the Cottonian catalogue in MS Harley 6018 strongly suggests that the text of Gawain was not entirely unknown in the seventeenth century. At least one reader of that period, whose identity is inextricably bound to the composition of this catalogue's entry for "Nero A:x", seems to have recognized that the alliterative poetry in this volume consisted of more than one text. Since Robert Cotton seems to have participated in the compilation of this early catalogue of his collection, it is quite possible that he is the source of this acknowledgement of Gawain 's existence. Whatever the source, however, the reference to a "Gesta Arthury regis" in this early Cottonian catalogue apparently anticipated by some two hundred years Madden's encounter with Gawain . But, to give Madden his due, it must be remembered that it was he, and not his seventeenth-century precursor, who possessed the learning and persistence required to bring the text of this intriguing poem to the attention of a contemporary audience for whom its original manuscript was no more than a museum piece.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Stage Directions and Speech Headings in Act 1 of Titus Andronicus Q (1594): Shakespeare or Peele? by Macd. P. Jackson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Introducing his own adaptation of Titus Andronicus in 1687, Thomas Ravenscroft denounced the original as "rather a heap of rubbish than a structure," and claimed to have been told "by some anciently conversant with the stage" that Shakespeare had merely given a few "master-touches" to the work of some "private author." 1 By 1765 Samuel Johnson could write, "All the editors and critics agree . . . in supposing this play spurious. I see no reason for differing from them." 2 Most nineteenth-century scholars continued this tradition of denigration and rejection, though there were some dissenters. Even as late as 1927 no less a commentator than T. S. Eliot called Titus Andronicus "one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written, a play in which it is incredible that Shakespeare had any hand at all." 3 But the tide was turning. John Dover Wilson's edition of Titus Andronicus in the Cambridge New Shakespeare series (1948) was the last to make out a detailed case for dual authorship. Wilson argued that a play by George Peele had been expanded by Peele and Shakespeare, and that although Shakespeare's handiwork was visible throughout the last four Acts, the first Act remained substantially Peele's. 4 Five years later, Arden editor J. C. Maxwell was of two minds. "It may seem tempting to assert roundly that the whole play is by Shakespeare and no one else," he wrote. But he added that he could "never quite believe it while reading Act 1." 5 He too gave grounds for attributing the first Act to Peele. With the advent, or revival, of an international "Theatre of Cruelty" Titus Andronicus has flourished on the stage and won critical esteem. Peter Brook's 1955 Stratford production, with Laurence Olivier in the title role, discovered something of its power to affect an audience. Eugene M. Waith's Oxford edition (1984) sets its seal on the play's rehabilitation. Waith concludes that " Titus Andronicus is entirely by Shakespeare." 6 All those who write about the tragedy tacitly concur. Its authorship is no longer an issue. What used to be considered bad, and therefore not Shakespeare's, is now considered too interesting to be by anybody else, even in part. But there are good reasons for thinking that modern scholarship has reached the wrong conclusion. The evidence supplied by earlier scholars that Act 1, at least, was largely, if not wholly, composed by George Peele can be supplemented to such an extent that the balance of probabilities is against Shakespeare's sole responsibility for the play as it has come down to us. "So what?", the reader may object. "We have the play, it interests us, it seems Shakespearean in design. Who cares whether Shakespeare himself did or did not write such-and-such a scene? Isn't the very concept of authorship problematical, at any rate?" Even critics for whom "Shakespeare" is something more than a signpost to sites from which to disinter the shards of disused ideologies may express impatience with the niggling concerns of the "disintegrationist." Such attitudes, though understandable, are unscholarly. Either Peele was the author of Act 1 of Titus Andronicus or he was not — in the same sense that I am the author of this article and Roland Barthes is the author of an essay entitled "The Death of the Author." 7 Peele, or Shakespeare, or somebody else was the man in whose brain the speeches were conceived and whose hand held the quill when they were first set down. This is a matter of historical fact. Some facts are less easily established than others — we must be content, as in so many human affairs, with probabilities — but in literary history, no less than in other branches of historical research, we have an obligation to get facts as right as we can. In the case of Titus Adronicus our picture of Shakespeare's beginnings as a dramatist is in question. And so is our notion of his place in the Elizabethan entertainment industry. Collaboration and the refurbishing of scripts were common practice. Did the young Shakespeare, early in his playwriting career, work with his experienced elders, as most other tyro playwrights found it expedient to do? Or was he able, right from the start, to strike out unaided and alone? Francis Meres's listing of Titus Adronicus in 1598 as one of Shakespeare's plays and its inclusion in the First Folio of 1623 fail to settle the matter. 8 If Shakespeare were responsible for about four-fifths of the play's dialogue, Meres and the Folio editors would have been "fully within their rights in calling it his." 9 To name Shakespeare as author of a work is not necessarily to credit him with every line. After all, Wilson and Maxwell both attributed a share in Titus Adronicus to Peele, yet their editions each appeared within a "Shakespeare" series, with no second author's name on the title page. The external evidence for Shakespeare's significant involvement with the play is overwhelming, but it leaves open the possibility that another playwright was also involved. We must look to the internal evidence of the text itself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The evidence to be adduced here first may be described as bibliographical or textual. Let us begin with a modest item. There is general agreement that the 1594 quarto of Titus Andronicus bears all the signs of having been printed from "foul papers," an authorial manuscript that left several ambiguities to be resolved before the script was performed. 10 The call in an early stage direction for the entry of " others as many as can be " was cited by Greg as a typical "author's direction" of the "permissive or petitory" kind. 11 In the same sentence Greg listed " &amp; others as many as may be " in Peele's Edward I (1593). The formula has come to seem characteristic of the authorial foul papers of the age. But in fact these are almost certainly the only two instances of the entry of "others as many as can/may be" in the whole of English Renaissance drama 1576 — 1642. 12 This may seem a "poor likelihood" to build a case on. But the speech headings and stage directions in the first Act of Titus Andronicus show more extensive traces of the practices of Peele. The quarto begins with a three-line entry direction: " Enter the Tribunes and Senatours aloft: And then enter Saturninus and his followers at one dore, and Bassianus and his followers, with Drums and Trumpets ." Then the first six speech headings (sigs. A3 — A4) are all centred over the speeches to which they apply. Three are for Saturninus and two for Bassianus, and one has " Marcus Andronicus with the Crowne ." This last-quoted phrase, which follows an eight-line speech from Saturninus and a nine-line speech from Bassianus, serves as a combination stage direction and speech heading. Editors disagree over whether Marcus has entered with the other tribunes at the beginning of the scene and now rises to speak, displaying the crown, or whether this direction also marks his entry. 13 At any rate, the scene has several more centred stage directions that also do duty as speech headings. On A4 there is " Enter a Captaine ." He speaks six lines without any normal speech heading. Similarly, " Enter Lauinia " on B1v is directly followed by her eight-line speech. And centred stage directions again substitute for speech headings on B4v: " Titus two sonnes speakes " and " Titus sonne speakes "; and once more on C1: " they all kneele and say ." The two directions on B4v introduce one-line speeches, the direction on C1 a speech of two lines. The long direction in Titus Andronicus (A4 — A4v) that calls for " others as many as can be " marks the hero's entry in a pageant combining triumph and funeral. It begins " Sound Drums and Trumpets " and ends " and Titus speakes ." In this case Titus is also given a normal speech heading. Nothing comparable to the mix of formulas and oddities in the headings and directions of the opening pages of Titus Andronicus can be found in any other Shakespeare play — in the First Folio (1623) or in any of the twenty-two substantive quartos, "good" and "bad." 14 In the Folio, a play's first speech heading is either centred in the column or placed at the left of the column over the large ornamental letter that begins the dialogue. In many quartos, also, the first speech heading is centred, again usually to avoid an initial ornamental letter or specially large one. In the quarto of Othello the speech heading for Montano is centred after the carefully marked and spaced head to Act 2. In both Folio and quartos, centred headings or directions may introduce songs, poems, or letters that are read aloud. For instance, in The Winter's Tale "Enter Autolicus singing" (F, Bb3) is followed immediately by the text of the song, and in Measure for Measure the Duke asks the Provost to read him a letter he is carrying ("Pray you let's heare."), the heading " The Letter " follows, and the Provost proceeds to read it ("Whatsouer you may heare to the contrary . . .") without having been given an additional speech heading (F, G2v). In 1 Henry IV , 2.3 begins with " Enter Hotspur solus reading a letter ," and there is no speech heading before he reads and comments (Q, C4v); and in The Merchant of Venice there is no speech heading for Bassanio before he reads out Antonio's letter, italicized in the text (Q, F3v). Directions for noises offstage may incorporate the words spoken, as in Julius Caesar : " Cry within, Flye, flye, flye " (F, ll 5v). Likewise, crowd scenes sometimes include such directions as the following: " They all cry, Martius, Martius, cast vp their Caps and Launces . . ." ( Coriolanus , F, aa4); " Enter one crying a Miracle " and " and they follow, and cry, A Miracle " ( 2 Henry VI , F, m5v — 6); " Warwicke and the rest cry all, Warwicke, Warwicke, and set vpon the Guard, who flye, crying, Arme, Arme, Warwicke and the rest following them " ( 3 Henry VI , F, p6v). In such cases the rabble are invariably "crying." In I Henry IV Glendower's daughter, Mortimer's wife, is given no specific dialogue, but the direction " The Ladie speakes in Welsh ," repeated with minor variations, prompts her contributions (Q, F3). A choric figure — the Chorus in Henry V , Gower in Pericles , Rumour in the induction to 2 Henry IV — may enter and speak without a normal speech heading. The few other examples of stage directions that also serve as speech headings tend to fall at the beginning of a scene. Richard III opens with " Enter Richard Glocester, solus " (Q, A2) and has " Enter a Scriuener with a paper in his hand " followed by the scrivener's soliloquy, which occupies the whole of 3.6 (Q, G4). In Troilus and Cressida 2.3 begins with " Enter Thersites solus " (Q, D4v), and Thersites delivers an unprefixed soliloquy, and in the same play Achilles speaks without a speech heading after " Enter Achilles with Myrmidons " begins 5.7 (Q, L4). In the "bad quarto" of Romeo and Juliet Paris speaks immediately after the direction that opens 1.2, " Enter Countie Paris, old Capulet" (Q 1597, B2), but a short intervening speech by Montague has been omitted. The same quarto has " Enter Fryer with a Lanthorne " followed by Friar Lawrence's unprefixed speech; this occurs within 5.3 (Q 1597, K2). And in the doubtful quarto of Richard III two of the eleven Ghosts who address Richard and Richmond do so without a speech heading: " Enter the ghost of Lady Anne his wife " (Q, L4), " Enter the Goast of Buckingham " (Q, L4v). No speech heading follows the direction in Henry VIII , 2.4: " The Queene makes no answer, rises out of her Chaire, goes about the Court, comes to the King, and kneeles at his Feete. Then speakes " (F, v2v), which suffices to introduce a very long speech. Nearly all these exceptional cases fall into recognizable categories, and the remainder seem due to "bad quarto" carelessness. Nowhere do we encounter such a combination of anomalies as in the opening scene of Titus Andronicus : (a) a series of centred speech headings, (b) entries (as of the Captain and Lavinia and possibly Marcus) that also substitute for speech headings and occur within the scene, and (c) three uses of the formula ". . . speaks " or " they . . . say " introducing un-prefixed speeches. Even the use of the phrase " and Titus speakes " to announce a prefixed speech in Titus Andronicus , A4, is highly unusual. Besides the example in Henry VIII , cited at the end of the preceding paragraph, the good Shakespearean texts yield only " which Prospero observing, speakes " at the end of a long direction concerning the masque in The Tempest (F, B2v). The "bad quartos" of 2 Henry VI ( The Contention ) and 3 Henry VI ( The True Tragedy ) each have one example of a stage direction ending ". . . and speakes " (Q, H1v; O, C8). Otherwise, none of the Shakespeare texts has a direction ending in this fashion, whether or not a prefix follows. And, if we exclude the instance in Titus Andronicus , the specific verb "say" (or "says" or "saith") is never used either within or at the end of a stage direction in a Shakespearean text. 15 The centring of the headings for Bassianus and Saturninus may not reflect the manuscript copy; it may have been a product of the printing-house. The compositor centres speech headings again on I2, where he is obviously wasting space. Even so, there is some evidence that Peele began his manuscripts in the same way, and the other Titus Andronicus anomalies are all common in quartors of his plays. 16 Edward I (1593) begins with a three-line entry direction, and then the centred heading " The Queen Mother ," introducing a ten-line speech; after the lords have exited, " Manet Queene Mother " is centred and she continues a very long speech. The following directions immediately precede unprefixed speeches: " The Friar and Guenthian sing: Lluellen speakes to them " (B3v); " Then Lluellen spieth Elinor and Mortimer, and saieth this " (D4); " Mortimer solus " (E1); " Enter Friar " and " Frier lies downe " (E3v); " Enter Iohn Balioll, King of Scots with his traine " (F3); " Potter strikes ," " Frier strikes ," " Frier kneeles ," and " Mortimer kneeles " (F3); " Gloster and Ione hand in hand " (G1); " Longshanks kisses them both and speaks ," ". . . Bishop speakes to her in her bed ," and " Queene Elinor shee kisses him " (H4); " After the showe . . . Longshanks speaketh " (H4v); " Enter Versses " (I1v); " Enter Queene alone " (I2); " Enter David " and " Enter Souldiers " (I3); " Enter Ione of Acone " (L2). Most of these directions are centred, most fall within a scene, not at its beginning, and the speeches thus introduced range from one to ten lines in length. 17 In David and Bethsabe (1599), D2, the direction " Dauid in his gowne walking sadly. To him Nathan " introduces an unprefixed speech of eleven lines by David, who ends "But what saith Nathan to his lord the king?" The reply is preceded by both a centred direction, " Nathan to David " and a prefix. On D4v " Enter Dauid with Ioah, Abyssus, Cusay, with drum and ensigne against Rabba " introduces an unprefixed nine-line speech by David. On G3 there is an entry (without "Enter"), " Absalon, Amassa, with all his traine ," and Absalon has a long speech, after which follow the directions " Exeunt " and " The battell, and Absalon hangs by the haire " (G3v), and then Absalon speaks sixteen lines without a speech heading. And on G4 " Enter fiue or sixe souldiers " does duty as a heading for a twelve-line speech by one of them. The Arraignment of Paris (1584) has Pallas and Venus read without speech headings: " Pallas reades " and " Venus reades " (B3v), and " Paris oration to the Councell of the gods " (D3) is unprefixed. These omissions of the normal speech heading are of the exceptional kind countenanced by Shakespeare. But a link with the first Act of Titus Andronicus is provided by the many stage directions ending in ". . . speakes " or ". . . speaketh ." There are eleven altogether (A4, A4v, B2v, B3, C1, C2, C3, D2, D4v, E3, E4v). The frequent entry of characters without the word "Enter," as in " Paris and Oenone " on B1v, may throw light on " Marcus Andronicus with the Crowne " in Titus Andronicus , if the Oxford editors are right in following the Folio in interpreting this as the point at which Marcus actually enters. 18 The ". . . speakes " or ". . . speaketh " or ". . . saith " formula is used again by Peele in The Battle of Alcazar (1594) — six times to introduce the Presenter's speeches. The omission of any speech headings for this figure is in line with Shakespearean practice, but the repeated indications that he "speaks" are not. The Old Wives' Tale (1595) has nothing relevant except the centred speech heading for " Anticke " after the initial entry direction. Even the stagecraft indicated by some of the directions seems characteristic of Peele. Titus Andronicus is the only play in the Shakespeare canon that begins with an entry "aloft" followed immediately by entries (at separate doors) onto the main platform, and that proceeds with dialogue between characters on the two levels, and movement up and down. David and Bethsabe opens in a similar fashion, with David "above" viewing Bethsabe below and calling on Cusay to enter at the upper level and then descend in order to fetch Bethsabe to him. In the next scene " Ioab speakes aboue ," " Enter Cusay beneath ," and Joab calls on Cusay to "come vp" to join him, which he does.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III What other reasons are there for believing Peele to have been the author of Titus Andronicus , Act 1? Dover Wilson summarized the work of earlier scholars and added some observations of his own. He listed parallels between Titus Andronicus and Shakespeare's plays and poems, and compiled an inventory of a dozen "common Shakespearean turns of speech," familiar to him from his editorial labours on the New Shakespeare series. 19 These afforded evidence of Shakespeare's presence in every scene but the first, which is full of verbal parallels to Peele's plays and to his poem The Honour of the Garter , written in the middle of 1593. Wilson, recording these parallels in his introduction and commentary, showed also that Peele's diction ("diadem," "gratulate," "re-salute," "gramercy," "panther," "remunerate," "gratify," "consecrate" for "consecrated," and so on) and his "clichés and tricks" of composition were prominent in Act 1 of Titus Andronicus . The tendency for speech after speech to begin with a vocative and continue with an imperative verb is especially marked in the first half of Titus Andronicus , Act 1, as in the opening scenes of Edward I and The Battle of Alcazar . And the same mechanical repetition of words and phrases occurs. Maxwell added an argument from syntax. The construction in lines 5 — 6 of Saturninus' opening speech — "I am his first-born son that was the last / That ware the imperial diadem of Rome," where "his first-born son that" means "the first-born son of him who" — is unusually frequent in Act 1 of Titus Adronicus , appearing six or seven times as often as in the rest of the play, and Maxwell shows that in Peele's non-dramatic poetry it is also about six times as common as in Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece . His search of a fair number of contemporary plays revealed that the construction — a possessive adjective or pronoun as antecedent of a relative clause — "is common in Peele's later work, fairly common in Kyd and Marlowe, rare in Shakespeare, Greene and Lodge." 20 The incidence was also low in most of the anonymous plays that Maxwell examined. David and Bethsabe is the play by Peele with the largest number of examples of this syntactical mannerism. As Maxwell noted, the merits of his particular test as an indication of authorship are twofold: use of the device would seem to bear little or no relation to subject matter, and similar rates of usage are not likely to be due to conscious, or even unconscious, imitation by one author of another. R. F. Hill surveyed the use of the rhetorical devices in Shakespeare's early plays, and found Titus Andronicus uncharacteristically sparing in its use of some figures (such as antimetabole, epanodis, symploche, epanalepsis, asyndeton, and brachiologia) and uncharacteristically prodigal in its use of others (such as certain forms of epizeuxis, chiasmus, and pleonasm). 21 He pointed out that alliteration, more frequent in Titus Andronicus than in other Shakespeare plays, was employed to excess in Act 1. Several of the oddities appear to be particularly prevalent in Act 1, and although comparative data are not available for Peele, he is easily seen to be partial to alliteration and to several of the most prominent of the tricks that Hill categorizes. Hill concluded that Titus Andronicus was either Shakespeare's first play or the work of more than one author. Drawing on Spevack's Concordance , statistician Baron Brainerd sought lexical items whose frequencies in Shakespeare's plays covaried with chronology, in an attempt to calculate an "omnibus predictor" of date of composition. 22 Beginning with plays for which the dating is relatively uncontentious, he was able to combine variables into a fairly good predictor. A few plays, including Titus Andronicus , were "deviant" with respect to the variables tested. The plays found to fall into this category with Titus Andronicus were ones suspected to be of dual or multiple authorship or to have been subject to authorial revision at a later stage of Shakespeare's stylistic development. 23 In Studies in Attribution: Middleton and Shakespeare I investigated the rare-word vocabulary of Titus Andronicus in relation to a division of the play based objectively on the percentage of feminine endings per scene as these had been determined by earlier scholars. 24 A treatise by Philip W. Timberlake covering use of the feminine endings in all Elizabethan drama up to the year 1595 revealed that even in his earliest works Shakespeare tended to employ feminine endings at a higher rate than ever attained in the known plays of Greene, Peele, Nashe, Lyly, Lodge, or Marlowe. 25 The percentage of feminine endings in Titus Andronicus associates most scenes with Shakespeare rather than his early contemporaries, but for 1.1, 2.1, and 4.1 the figures are low. I noted that the scenes selected as doubtful on this metrical evidence and labelled "Part A" are deficient in other features that characterize the young Shakespeare's verse: for instance they have fewer compound adjectives and Shakespearean images than the rest of the play ("Part B"). The division into two "parts" was not intended to be hard-and-fast or to have any absolute validity; it was simply a means of testing the hypothesis that two "strata" existed. These might be authorial or chronological. The investigation of vocabulary was confined to words that appeared in Titus Andronicus and once or twice in other Shakespeare plays. Nearly a century ago the German scholar Gregor Sarrazin had shown that such words most strongly linked plays composed at approximately the same time. 26 The rare-word links of Titus Andronicus Part B to Shakespeare plays of four successive chronological groups of about the same total size fell as follows: 37:26:19:23. As we should expect, links with the earliest group predominate. For Part A the figures were 33:9:8:8. They thus exhibit a far more extreme concentration of links with the earliest group. The difference between Parts A and B in the degree of concentration of links with the first group (33:25 compared with 37:68) is statistically significant, with odds of about a hundred to one that it is due to chance. 27 The indications are that Part A was written either some years before Part B or by a different author. The second alternative may seem the less likely. Would writing by other dramatists of the 1580s and early 1590s share with Shakespeare's own writing a tendency to be most strongly linked in its rare-word vocabulary to his first group of plays? The answer is that it might well do so. M. W. A. Smith and Hugh Calvert have tested Peele's Edward I and Greene's James IV and discovered that each exhibits just such a pattern. 28 Marina Tarlinskaja's recent research into Shakespeare's verse would appear to confirm the presence of two strata in Titus Andronicus . Her main concern is with the extent to which each of the ten syllabic positions in the standard blank verse line is occupied by a stressed or unstressed syllable in accordance with the iambic paradigm. She finds that for different "ictic" or "non-ictic" positions the degree to which theoretical expectations are realized changes throughout Shakespeare's career so as to create consistent chronological trends. Most of the metrical details with which she is concerned would associate Titus Andronicus with I Henry VI as the earliest of Shakespeare's plays. But certain features of Part A are unmatched in the canon before Much Ado About Nothing and Henry V . So while on the theory of Shakespeare's sole authorship the vocabulary evidence would place Part A appreciably earlier than Part B, some of Tarlinskaja's metrical evidence would place Part A appreciably later than Part B. The contradiction might be resolved on a theory of dual authorship. Tarlinskaja herself speculates that Shakespeare may have written Part A at a time when his metrical practices had not yet stabilized, but she "is really tempted to attribute 'Titus' to two different authors." 29 Tarlinskaja's findings were published too late to be taken into account by Eugene Waith, who did, however, consider and dismiss the implications of my vocabulary data. Quoting in his edition of Titus Andronicus a letter from Gary Taylor in 1981, he objected that the three scenes comprising my Part A "are linked by no narrative or formal logic, and that dramatic collaboration almost always involved a division of the plot along some obvious logical lines" (p. 17). But, as Taylor recognized by 1987 in his essay on "Canon and Chronology" in the Oxford Textual Companion , in the Quarto of 1594 Act 1 and the first scene of Act 2 (as they are in most modern editions) form a single uninterrupted scene, which initiates the action, while 4.1 initiates the counter action. "The division suggested by feminine endings is thus compatible with patterns of collaboration in the drama of the period" (p. 114). At any rate, a significant disparity, in vocabulary and metre, would remain if we were to redefine Part A, reducing it (by about one-third) to the first Act alone, and my remarks on further "unShakespearean" or "Peelean" features in Titus Andronicus will focus on this, the most suspect portion of the play. Rates of occurrence of high-frequency function words have been proven to be useful indicators of authorship. 30 Spevack's concordance furnishes information about these. He gives rates for every word in every play, these being expressed as percentages of the total number of words (of "tokens," that is, not "types"). For all thirty-eight plays, including The Two Noble Kinsmen , the rates for and , which is the second most common word in the canon after the , vary from 2.398 for The Two Gentlemen of Verona to 3.844 for Titus Andronicus . The mean rate per play is 2.998 and the standard deviation is 0.387. Titus Andronicus is the only play for which the rate is more than two standard deviations from the mean. 31 Act 1, in which the rate for and rises to 4.809, is chiefly responsible for the anomalously high rate of the play as a whole. If it is excluded, the rate for Titus Andronicus becomes 3.556, well within the normal range of two standard deviations from the mean for a Shakespeare play. The disparity between Act 1 and Acts 2 — 5 is highly significant, statistically speaking. The odds are less than one in a thousand that it is a chance phenomenon — which is not to say that dual authorship is the only possible explanation. 32 In its rate of use of with , Titus Andronicus again falls at the end of the range of Shakespeare's plays, and again Act 1 is chiefly responsible. The average for the Shakespeare plays is 0.878, the standard deviation 0.113. Titus Andronicus , with a rate of 1.136 is the sole play to fall outside two standard deviations from the mean. 33 For Act 1 the rate is 1.282, while the rest of the play, at 1.103, would just fall within the normal range. 34 This time the difference between Act 1 and Acts 2 — 5 is not statistically significant, but Act 1 is especially anomalous. Would the rates for and and with in Titus Andronicus , Act 1, be inconsistent with Peele's practices? Computerized counts of the opening scene or scenes of Edward I , The Battle of Alcazar , and David and Bethsabe — amounting to roughly two thousand words from each play — give some basis for an answer. 35 For these three samples the rates for and are 3.872, 5.314, and 4.329; for with they are 1.518, 1.213, and 1.644. All six of these rates are, like those for Act 1 of Titus Andronicus , outside the normal Shakespeare range. In combination the three Peele samples yield a rate for and (4.517) a little lower than that of Titus Andronicus , Act 1, and a rate for with (1.453) a little higher. Peele therefore shows the same partiality for and and with that distinguishes Act 1 of Titus Andronicus from the rest of the Shakespeare canon. Less arid than these statistics are some details concerning a trick of style that recurs conspicuously in Act 1 of Titus Andronicus and is found in the very first line: "Noble patricians, patrons of my right." This is the ending of a blank verse line with a preposition or conjunction, followed by a possessive pronoun plus a monosyllabic noun, as in "of my right," "with your swords," "to our foes," "of his name," "and his sons." The formula, usually preceded by a two-syllable word stressed on its first syllable, produces a pyrrhic foot followed by a foot that is some way between an iamb and a spondee; alternatively, one might say that each successive syllable carries marginally more stress than the one before it, but only the last of the four is strongly stressed. The rate of occurrence in Titus Andronicus , Act 1, is one in every 12.7 lines. 36 In the rest of the play it is one in every 24.7 lines. The odds are less than one in a thousand that this disparity is a matter of chance. 37 Counts for the opening Acts of Shakespeare's eight other earliest plays yield the following rates: one in 22.8 for The Two Gentlemen of Verona , one in 37.3 for The Taming of the Shrew (ignoring the Induction), one in 20.6 for 2 Henry VI , one in 19.3 for 3 Henry VI , one in 21.9 for I Henry VI , one in 24.0 for Richard III , one in 17.6 for The Comedy of Errors , and one in 34.8 for Love's Labour's Lost (where the first Act is very short). The total for all eight plays furnishes a rate of one in 22.8, which is close to that for Titus Andronicus , Acts 2 — 5. Each of the four Acts of Peele's David and Bethsabe provides a similar match to the first Act of Titus Andronicus : one in 13.6, 10.8, 12.2, and 8.3 of the full pentameter lines end in the "of my right" kind of formula; the overall rate for the play being one in 11.2. It is more difficult to calculate figures for Edward I , in which many scenes consist mainly of prose or rhymed verse, much of it doggerel, but for blank verse speeches the rate is about one in 13.2. In addition, many lines end in phrases such as "on the way" and "at the name," where the definite article substitutes for the possessive pronoun. Although both the "from his flesh" and "on the ground" sorts of line ending are quite common in The Battle of Alcazar , the percentages are within the normal Shakespearean range.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV There is, then, quite a variety of evidence for supposing Titus Andronicus to be the handiwork of more than one author, and for attributing Act 1, in particular, to George Peele. The best case against reaching this conclusion has been made by Marco Mincoff in Shakespeare: The First Steps (Sofia: Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1976), pp. 112 — 137 and 210 — 213. Mincoff concedes that the style of the opening scenes of Titus Andronicus "does seem to warrant some suspicions" and that "many of Peele's more obvious mannerisms do appear with considerable frequency, especially in the first act," but finds that the verse lacks Peele's "very typical sentence structure with its relative clauses and appositional phrases often piled three deep." He adds that the Peelean mannerisms "extend, often enough, into passages that are obviously Shakespeare's, and it is impossible to divide the play sharply between two utterly different styles" (pp. 113 — 114). This last difficulty was also acknowledged by Hill, who noted that the anomalous features with which he was concerned were not strongly correlated in their incidence, so that they failed to combine to distinguish particular scenes from others as clearly as an upholder of the theory of dual authorship might wish, though oddities did tend to congregate within Act 1. My own tests, which show Act 1 to be most markedly differentiated from the bulk of the play, but which are inconclusive about whether to associate 2.1 and 4.1 with Act 1 or the remainder, register the same ambiguity. Mincoff's view is that Shakespeare had "many of Peele's more marked cadences running in his mind" (p. 114), and that whether consciously or unconsciously he adopted elements of Peele's style, being particularly susceptible in his writing of the formal first Act, with its set speeches and orations. He shows that in the tightness of its plotting Titus Andronicus represents an advance even on Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy , and feels it can hardly be coincidental that the backbone of the repertory of Strange's Men (the "Earl of Derby's" servants listed first on the 1594 quarto title page among companies to have performed Titus ) was The Spanish Tragedy , Marlowe's The Jew of Malta , and Peele's The Battle of Alcazar , Kyd's play having been decisive in the shaping of Titus , Marlowe's providing hints for the figure of Aaron, and Peele's, along with his other plays, influencing the style. He supposes that Shakespeare wrote Titus Andronicus for Strange's Men in 1592, or a little before, having joined the troupe as an actor. The notion that Shakespeare, having as an actor assimilated the verse dialogue of other playwrights and deciding to experiment with Senecan tragedy, began Titus Andronicus by modelling his style on Peele's has a superficial plausibility, and would certainly account for the play's mixture of Peelean and Shakespearean quirks of style. But it would not be surprising, either, if collaboration between Peele and Shakespeare, or the revision of one dramatist's script by the other, were to create such a stylistic mix. When two authors combine in the composition of a play, it is not uncommon for some mutual adjustment to take place, so that the style of each is a little less individual than in his unassisted works, even to the point where something akin to a third authorial personality materializes. And it is doubtful whether a theory of "single authorship plus imitation" can adequately explain all the unusual features of Act 1 of Titus Andronicus that have been detailed here. It can hardly account, for example, for the contradiction between the extreme earliness of Part A's vocabulary, as far as links with the Shakespeare canon are concerned, and the comparative lateness, in terms of the development of Shakespeare's blank verse, of some of its metrical characteristics (which are themselves hard to reconcile with the low proportion of lines with feminine endings); or the many verbal parallels that Wilson found between Titus Andronicus (especially Act 1) and Peele's poem The Honour of the Garter , written in the summer of 1593. The exceptionally high rates of usage of and and with might conceivably have arisen as a natural byproduct of an attempt by Shakespeare to imitate Peele's style. But Act 1's Peelean stage directions and speech prefixes hardly seem likely to have resulted from any form of imitation. There is complete consensus among editors and textual scholars that the 1594 Quarto was set from a pre-theatrical script in the author's (or authors') own hand. Why should Shakespeare — who, according to Mincoff's theory, had already composed several plays and seen them performed — adopt Peele's idiosyncrasies in the use of stage directions that serve as speech prefixes, and the like, and do so within Act 1 of Titus Andronicus alone? On the whole the presence in the early portion of the play of so many different features that are atypical of Shakespeare and typical of Peele is most plausibly explained as the legacy of Peele's having actually written Act 1 at least. There can be no doubt that in its overall structure Titus Andronicus bears the stamp of Shakespeare rather than Peele, and much of the writing is more like the early Shakespeare's than anybody else's. Probably no single other playwright at work before the play's publication was capable of such a remarkable achievement. The argument for Peele's involvement put forward here is not motivated by any inclination, like Ravenscroft's, to vilify the play. Peele was Shakespeare's senior, and not incompetent, though the younger dramatist certainly had something to teach him about plotting, and was already a much better poet. I can think of only one way in which the case for Peele's participation in Titus Andronicus might be clinched, and that is by means of an exhaustive examination of verbal parallels. The use of "parallels" in matters of disputed authorship has grown into disfavour, because of the gross misuse of such evidence in the past. The key to its convincing use is exhaustiveness. If a concordance to all Peele's writing were available, it would be possible to check Titus Andronicus line by line and even word by word for collocations and more extensive parallels of phrasing and thought first with Peele and then with Shakespeare. On the theory that Act 1 is substantially Peele's, parallels with Peele's known works should predominate there and parallels with the Shakespeare canon predominate in the rest of the play. Such an investigation might help settle the status of 2.1 and 4.1 as well. If Shakespeare incorporated a considerable amount of dialogue by Peele into Titus Andronicus or the two dramatists worked together on the script, that is an important detail of English dramatic history. In an age of theory there is still a place for attempts to determine the facts. 38</field>

My confidence about the rarity of the "others as many as can/may be" formula derives from the presence at Tokyo Gakugei University of an electronic data-base into which stage directions from almost all available plays listed in the Schoenbaum-Harbage Annals have been entered. I am extremely grateful to Professor Yasumada Okamoto and to Mr Yukio Kato for supplying me with relevant information. At the time when they ran computer checks for me, they had entered 508 of the 583 plays of 1576 — 1642 that are listed in the chronological table in The Cambridge Companion to English Renaissance Drama , ed. A. R. Braunmuller and Michael Hattaway (1990), pp. 419 — 446, which omits entertainments, pageants, masques, school plays, and Latin academic plays. I have made some attempt to check plays not yet in the data-base. A further 133 plays outside my chronological limits had been entered, and none exhibited the Peelean formula. 13 The matter is discussed by Wells, Re-Editing , pp. 83 — 84. 14 I have worked with The Norton Facsimile: The First Folio of Shakespeare , ed. Charlton Hinman (1968); Shakespeare's Plays in Quarto , ed. Michael J. B.

Charles Tyler Prouty (1952 — 1970). 17 There are also two or three directions ending in ". . . speaketh " but followed by a speech heading. 18 Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor with John Jowett and William Montgomery, William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion (1987), p. 210 (note on 1.1.17.1). 19 Wilson, Titus Andronicus , pp. xxiii-xxv. 20 J.

Questions of revision or plural authorship in these plays have not, of course, been settled; John Kerrigan, " Love's Labour's Lost and Shakespearean Revision," Shakespeare Quarterly , 33 (1982), 337 — 339, argues against revision in Love's Labour's Lost . 24 MacD.

There is a description of the chi-square test in Anthony Kenny, The Computation of Style: An Introduction to Statistics for Students of Literature and the Humanities (1982), pp. 110 — 119. Of course, strictly speaking, the test is valid only if the prediction has been made in advance that Part A will differ from Part B in respect of the proportion of links with the first group of plays . A chi-square test that simply compares the two sets of four figures (37:26:19:23 and 33:9:8:8) yields a result that falls short of statistical significance: chi-square = 7.3, 3 d.f. 28 M. W. A. Smith and Hugh Calvert, "Word-Links as a General Indicator of Chronology of Composition," Notes and Queries , 234 (1989), 338 — 341. Smith and Calvert worked with words found up to ten times in Shakespeare's dramatic canon, as did Eliot Slater in his research into vocabulary and chronology. 29 Marina Tarlinskaja, Shakespeare's Verse: Iambic Pentameter and the Poet's Idiosyncrasies (1987), p. 124. Tarlinskaja divides Titus Andronicus into "Group 1" scenes and "Group 2" scenes. Her Group 1 is identical with my Part A, except that I omitted the very short 2.2. I explore the implications of her findings in "Another Metrical Index for Shakespeare's Plays: Evidence for Chronology and Authorship," Neuphilologische Mitteilungen , 95 (1994), 453 — 458. 30 See Textual Companion , pp. 80 — 89. The most rigorous research on high-frequency words in English Renaissance drama has been reported by M. W. A. Smith in a series of articles in Computers and the Humanities , The Journal of Literary and Linguistic Computing , Notes and Queries , and elsewhere, beginning in the early 1980s. Smith's "Forensic Stylometry: A Theoretical Basis for Further Developments of Practical Methods," Journal of the Forensic Science Society , 29 (1989), 15 — 33, provides a mathematical validation of his procedures. 31 2 SD range = 2.225 — 3.771. 32 The odds are reckoned as follows: We can form a 2 x 2 contingency table of (a) occurrences of and and (b) occurrences of other words in (c) Act 1 and (d) Acts 2 — 5, where "a" and "b" are the rows and "c" and "d" the columns, and apply a chi-square test, using Yates's correction. Chi-square = 11.273 for 1 degree of freedom, p &lt; 0.001. For 2.1 the rate of and is also very high, 4.512; for 4.1 it is normal, but there is certainly a highly significant disparity between Parts A and B in toto , as originally defined. 33 2 SD range = 0.653 — 1.104. 34 For 2.1 the rate is 1.105 and for 4.1 it is 0.972, so that a notable disparity would remain if we were to revert to our original lines of demarcation between Parts A and B. 35 Working from the modern-spelling edition, The Dramatic and Poetical Works of Robert Greene and George Peele , ed. Alexander Dyce (1874), I keyed text into the computer until approximately two thousand words had been accumulated and a scene end had been reached. The analysis was carried out by means of the Micro-OCP concordance programme. 36 Figures are based on Maxwell's Arden edition for Titus Andronicus , on the Riverside Shakespeare for other Shakespeare plays, and on Dyce's Works for Peele's plays. 37 The calculation is based on chi-square testing of a 2 x 2 contingency table of (a) iambic pentameter lines ending with the "of my right" formula and (b) iambic pentameter lines not ending with the formula in (c) Act 1 and (d) the rest of the play. 38 Since this article was completed confirmation of its findings has come from two sources. "The Shakespeare Clinic" run by Ward Elliott and Robert Valenza of Claremont McKenna College has released a report entitled "Matching Shakespeare, 1994: Computer Testing of Elizabethan Texts for Common Authorship with Shakespeare" (June 21, 1994; and Supplement, July 15, 1994). Elliott and his associates have applied a battery of tests to texts by Shakespeare and by a fair range of his contemporaries. They show that all the plays traditionally accepted into the Shakespeare canon pass as Shakespearean on all or all-but-one of nineteen computerized tests — that is, the plays are consistent with one another, within statistically acceptable limits — except for those considered collaborations by the Oxford Shakespeare ( I Henry VI, Timon of Athens, Pericles, Henry VIII , and The Two Noble Kinsmen ) and Titus Andronicus and 3 Henry VI , each of which is recognized by the Oxford Textual Companion as possibly collaborative. The failure of Titus to meet the Shakespearean norms is particularly marked. The play as a whole is rejected by five tests, and a stratum that is labelled (probably misleadingly) "early," that includes Act 1, and that roughly corresponds to my "Part A" is largely responsible for the anomalous results: it is rejected by no fewer than seven tests, while the other stratum is rejected by only two. Further, in "Common Words in Titus Andronicus : The Presence of Peele," forthcoming in Notes and Queries , Brian Boyd re-examines and quantifies the evidence of formulaic repetition of common words in the suspect parts of Titus and in Peele, and assigns to Peele the bulk of 1.1 — 2.2 and 4.1.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of the Plays in the Jonson Folio of 1616 by James A. Riddell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the Folio edition of Ben Jonson's Workes of 1616, the order of the plays as they appear in the volume does not fully coincide with the order of their being printed. That is, the first play, Every Man In His Humour , was printed in part after the sixth play in the volume, Volpone , was completed, and in larger part after the two remaining plays and a portion of Epigrammes were through the press. The general order of the printing of the plays has been known for some time: as long ago as 1957, Johan Gerritsen accounted for Every Man Out of His Humour being "quite the most heavily corrected [play] in the volume" because it was the first one Stansby printed. 1 In this paper, I intend to bring together some details about the printing of all of the plays, but with particular attention to that one. Every Man Out and the next two plays to have been printed, Cynthia's Revels , and Poëtaster , all appear with two kinds of title-pages, " in compartment " and " plain ." 2 The compartment is title-page border number 224 in McKerrow and Ferguson, first used by Stansby for these three Jonson plays. 3 The title-pages for Every Man Out are the most various of those for the three plays, and, when considered in conjunction with their conjugate pages, reflect what must have been a fair degree of uncertainty in Stansby's shop as he undertook the printing of the Jonson Folio. The title-pages themselves (sig. G1), as identified by Greg, appear in four variants, two in compartment ( Stansby alone 4 and Stansby for Smithwicke 5 ) and two plain (also Stansby alone and Stansby for Smithwicke ). Their conjugates (sig. G6 v ) appear in three variants ("a," original, "b," corrected, and "c," reset; the last follows the corrected state but is distinctly inferior). As Greg recognized, but was not able satisfactorily to explain, it is through correlating the various states of G1 and G6 v that the order of printing can be established. Unfortunately, the work of Herford and Simpson has impeded rather than advanced our understanding of the matter. Because they were convinced that the large-paper sheets of all of the gatherings of the Folio were printed after the small-paper sheets, 6 they made assumptions about the printing of sig. G6 v that have proven to be misleading. This is compounded by their failure to understand fully the distinction between the corrected version and the reset one (H&amp;S, textual notes to lines 103 — 146 of Every Man Out ; IX, 55 — 56). 7 That large-paper sheets of the volume were not invariably the last to be printed has been demonstrated by Kevin Donovan in his study of the printing of the masques. 8 As to the distinction between the corrected and reset versions, there are variations that did not come to the attention of Herford and Simpson. For instance, in the first line of G6 v the word "metaphor" appears in three different forms: original, "Metaphore"; corrected, " Metaphore "; reset, " Metaphore " with a swash " M ", 9 the last two not differentiated by Herford and Simpson. Although they recognize that there is both a corrected and a reset state, they sometimes conflate the two, in the service, so to speak, of the large-paper reading. They fail, therefore, to come to the conclusion that the penultimate line on the page should read (corrected, but not reset): "Squeeze out the humour of such spongie soules." And the reading that appears in their text is that of the inferior (H&amp;S, "large-paper") reset version: "Squeeze out the humour of such spongie natures" (Induction, line 145). For a reason that they do not explain (it most likely is mere oversight), they reproduce the original and corrected form of "O, 'tis more than most ridiculous" (Induction, line 114) 10 rather than the reset form that, judging from their reliance on the authority of the large-paper version, they would have thought superior: "O,it is more then most ridiculous" (with no space between the comma and "it" in the reset). They declare that "For this play [ Every Man Out ] we have also collated Mr. H. L. Ford's 'A' copy on large paper" (IX, 53). However, the Ford copy is cited only in their accounting of quire G, none other; for G3.4 it is the sole source for variant readings. There are three, related, difficulties that inhere in this assessment. Why was the Ford copy not cited for any signature but G? Why do the Ford readings not agree with the other two "large-paper" readings cited by Herford and Simpson? Why are the Ford variants in G3.4 present in five small-paper copies, of twenty-three that I have recently examined, but not in the Grenville 11 or two additional large-paper (Clark and Huntington)? The three questions are answered in one explanation: the Ford copy was not, in fact, printed on large paper, which can be inferred from the physical evidence that Ford himself supplies and which can now be confirmed by an examination of the volume (see below, note 14). Ford seems to have judged that it was large-paper by size alone. 12 He describes his "premier copy," the one consulted by Herford and Simpson, in his Collation of the Ben Jonson Folios, 1616 — 31 — 1640 , as measuring 11 ⅛ x 7 ⁷⁄₁₆˜. 13 But this is not "larger" than other small-paper copies; it is no taller and is perhaps but ¼ inch narrower 14 than a copy in the Huntington Library (shelf-mark 62100), which at one time was certainly larger than at present, as now all edges are gilt. On the other hand, large-paper copies are significantly taller. 15 The question of why quire G (here particularly G1.6 v ) was reset provokes several possible answers, a couple of which will be entertained merely to dismiss them. It is possible that after the printing had begun it was decided that large-paper copies should be added to the small-paper; but this issue must have been long since decided, as large-paper stock would need to be acquired for the purpose, and, much more to the point, some large-paper sheets, for instance, G3.4, are printed with the original settings. A second reason for G1 being reset might be that originally there had been no provision for a title-page of Every Man Out with Stansby's name only in the imprint; but as will be seen below, this cannot be the case. The most obvious, and the most reasonable, answer is that Stansby, or Stansby and others, decided to enlarge the press-run. Evidence gathered through examining the variant title-pages and their conjugates can pretty well establish the printing order of the title-pages, and once that is established, conjecture about Stansby's practice can be narrowed. Until now there have been understood to be, in Greg's words, "four variant titles — — with and without a border and with and without Smethwick's name as publisher." Greg further observes: The title is on G1, and G6 v , the other page of the forme, is found in three states of correction. These are consistently linked with the variant titles, and appear to establish the order of printing quite definitely as ["w," "x," "y," and "z" 16 ]. This, however, appears wholly unreasonable, and the descriptions [of the variant title-pages of Every Man Out ] have been given a more logical order as above [i. e.: "w," "y," "x," "z"]. (I, 266) In fact, there are two more variants than are set out by Greg or noticed by Herford and Simpson; that is, there are two distinctive states of plain, Stansby alone and two distinctive states of plain, Stansby for Smithwicke . The order is as follows: (1) in compartment, Stansby alone ; (2) plain, Stansby alone ; (3) plain, Stansby for Smithwicke ; (4) plain, Stansby for Smithwicke ("Hor." in margin); (5) in compartment, Stansby for Smithwicke ; (6) plain, Stansby alone . 17 The difficulties that Greg encountered when he tried to reconcile the four title-pages and the three variant states of G6 v led him to change the "wholly unreasonable" order for a "more logical" one. These difficulties vanish when the two additional variants are recognized. But a certain amount of explanation is required. My evidence is derived from sixty-seven copies of the Folio which have title pages for Every Man Out (not all copies do 18 ). Title-pages (1) (one copy 19 ), (2) (three copies 20 ), and (3) (nineteen copies) appear with the original (a) form of G6 v . Title-page (4) appears only with the corrected (b) variant of G6 v (six copies), as does title-page (5) (twenty-three copies). Title-page (6) appears only with the reset (c) variant of G6 v (nine small-paper and all six of the large-paper copies that I have seen). If this sampling can be considered a representative one (I am aware that it may not be), and if the reset sheets do indeed reflect Stansby's increasing the size of the press-run (I shall present supplementary evidence in the next few paragraphs), we can estimate that it was enlarged by as much as twenty-five to thirty percent. First, the differences between title-pages (2) and (6) need to be explained, as do the differences between (3) and (4). Title-pages (3) and (4) are derived from (2). Title-page (6) is a resetting. The imprint of title-page (2) reads: "London, | Printed by William Stansby. | [rule] | M. DC. XVI." This imprint was altered to produce (3), in the following manner: most probably without being removed from the press, the chase was unlocked, the period after Stansby's name was removed (it would be strikingly inappropriate), the rule was lowered, and "for Iohn Swithwicke ." 21 was inserted between Stansby's name and the rule; the original G6 v was left unaltered. There are three immediately recognizable differences between the two plain, Stansby alone imprints, (2) and (6), the latter, as has been mentioned, a resetting. In the reset plain, Stansby alone (6): after the word "Acted" in line six, a comma; "servants" in line eight set in large and small caps; "London" in the imprint set in the same font as Stansby's name. In the original plain, Stansby alone (2): no comma after "Acted"; "servants" set with an opening capital and then lower-case; "London" set in a smaller font than Stansby's name. These last three characteristics remain unaltered in (3) and (4), though other changes were introduced, rendering (4) easily distinguishable from (3). I set out what seems to be the most likely chain of events that led to the creation of (4) from (3). As a number of corrections were to be made to G6 v , the chase was removed from the press. At that time the printer took the opportunity to make two alterations to the title-page. He replaced the "M" in "MAN" because in (2) and (3) the letter was some-what unsightly, the upper left serif wanting. He also inserted "Hor." into the right-hand margin to indicate the source of the epigraph. 22 The run was then continued. It is not clear whether the plain title-page was left standing while the in compartment title-pages were machined or whether the printer continued to machine the plain title-page until he turned his attention once again to the title-page border; the latter does seem more probable. But with the order of (2), (3), and (4) established, the place of (1) can be fairly well determined. Because (3) is derived from (2), and (4) is derived directly from (3), and because (1) shares the same setting of G6 v as (2) and (3) but not the same as (4), (1) is almost certainly antecedent to (2). Although Stansby's men could have run off (1) at any time before G6 v was corrected, the order I have suggested seems the most likely one. Apparently at some time during the machining of quire I, it was decided that the press run should be made larger than originally intended, for no full quires of Every Man Out after I were printed short and only one third of quire I was. It may appear that two separate issues are involved here: first, the condition of there being original (and corrected original) and reset sheets in gatherings G, H, and I; second, the question that arises from that fact, "Why?" But the two issues are really one. The reset sheets exist. Where they exist offers a pretty good explanation of why. The most likely reason for their appearing in a significant number in the first three gatherings of the first play printed (but only sporadically in the rest of the volume) is that the press-run was augmented. An examination of the running-titles, and thereby the skeletons, employed in the printing of Every Man Out provides evidence about the printing of quires G, H, and I. In quire G only G5 v , G6, and G6 v have running-titles. The other pages of the quire are devoted to an integral title leaf, preliminary matter (including the "Characters" of figures in the play), and the first page of the dramatic text. One running-title is used for the original (and corrected) G5 v and G6 and a second one for G6 v (in both original and corrected states). Both of them, paired with yet other running-titles, appear in skeletons throughout the rest of the play: four of them through H and I, and a fifth skeleton that first appears in K. The running-titles always read " Euery Man out of his Humour ." but there are enough variations in the letterforms to render each running-title distinct. The five skeletons remain intact throughout, except for a slight alteration in the running-title that was paired with the one for G6 and G6v: at P3, a new running-title is brought in. 23 It is the same one that is used three times (G5 v , G6, G6 v ) in the reset quire G. Yet although the running-titles themselves are identical, the rules on each of those four pages are different. This suggests that the running-title from P3 was placed between new rules for the printing of G5 v (where the page number would be at the left margin, not the right), and then as each forme was composed the running-title was simply moved along. A page-for-page resetting can be prepared in any order, but it seems as though Stansby's men followed what would otherwise be their normal practice of beginning with 3 v .4, then 3.4 v , and so on, until they came to the final outer forme, 1.6 v . At least part of that sequence can be documented, for G5 (p. 81) and G2 (p. 75) have the same rules and the same page number, 81, suggesting that G5 was run off first and the headline then transferred to G2 without the necessary modification. The inner forme G5.2 v would therefore have been printed before the outer forme of that sheet, G2.5 v . Because P3, in the final quire of Every Man Out , was machined before G5 v , G6, and G6 v , it appears that only after all of the play was printed did Stansby's men turn to resetting matter needed for the first quire, G. It is less clear when H and I3.4 were reset and machined, but some inferences can be drawn about them. The eight formes are set with the same two skeletons (one of them at one time altered), which have entirely new running-titles. It is the alteration of the one forme that provides some clues about the order of printing of reset H and I3.4. I shall call the once-altered skeleton "VI" and its running-titles "x" and "w." It appears in reset H three times, in the following configuration: 1(x).6 v (w), 3(x).4 v (w), 3 v (w).4(x). 24 It must appear this way, if the skeleton remains intact, because the right side of the forme on the press must always be headed by w. In I3.4 it appears in both formes — — as 3(x).4 v (w), but then, with the running-titles reversed, as 3 v (x).4(w). The most reasonable assumption is that the shift of running-titles happened only once, either at the beginning or at the end of this group of formes. There is evidence to suggest that it happened at the end. A striking difference between the original I3 and the resetting is that in the latter the last line of the original is moved to the top of I3 v . Because it is much more likely that a line would be dropped from the end of a page than that a line from the bottom of one page would be accidentally set at the top of the page following, there is some reason to think that forme I3 v .4 was composed after I3.4 v , and that the three relevant formes of H and the outer forme of I3.4 were printed before inner I3.4, rather than inner I3.4 before the others. So, it seems that reset G, or at least a portion of it, was composed at about the time of, or just following, quire P; a bit later reset quire H and then reset I3.4 were composed, thus producing all of the sheets needed for the full press-run of the plays. 25 The evidence of the watermarks supports some of this conjecture, and provides grounds for a bit of further speculation. (In the discussion that follows, I employ numbers for watermarks that I have previously assigned; as any such numbers must be somewhat arbitrary, I have thought it not worthwhile to create "new" numbers for this essay). Paper with watermark 3 (two-handled pot with elongated letters O P, topped by grapes and flower) seems to have come into Stansby's shop (or, perhaps, merely began to be used) just as the last sheets of quire O were being machined, as 3 appears in one sheet (O1.6) of one copy of twenty-three. It then appears in P1.6 in all copies but one, and in subsequent quires until 2Z; it is in all five copies of reset G1.6. All reset sheets of G2.5 have either watermark 1 or 2, both being common throughout Every Man Out , but rarely present later in the volume. Also in all copies of the original G3.4 which I have noted, the watermark is either 1 or 2. In the reset G3.4, however, the watermark is 11. Except in seven copies of 2H3.4 (which I do not yet know how to account for), watermark 11 (two-handled pot with the letters TI[?], topped by grapes) does not appear until quire 3G, the fourth quire of The Alchemist . But G3.4 are the pages of "Characters," and nothing else — it would have been easy to print such a discrete portion of the quire (the pages do not even have running-titles) at any time. Thus, taking into consideration the evidence of the running-titles, it seems that G1.6 and 2.5 were set right after quire P, and that G3.4 was set at about the same time that the last two plays, The Alchemist and Catiline , were going through the press. Of the five copies I have referred to that have reset quire G, only four have reset quire H and I3.4. All of these four copies of quire H have yet another watermark (I have designated it as 37 [two-handled pot with the letters RUM, topped by grapes]), which I have not found elsewhere in the Folio. It is, therefore, of no particular use in determining when the reset quire was printed. However, all of the sheets of reset I3.4 have watermark 11, and because the skeleton that was newly composed for quire H was also employed in the machining of I3.4, it is reasonable to suppose that those four sheets were run off more or less together, probably at about the same time as G3.4. When pages are present in the three states of original, corrected, and reset, as they are in the cases of G6 v , H3 v .4, and I3 v .4, it will be found that the reset is based upon the corrected state. This can be seen particularly in punctuation marks that were introduced in the corrected state, such as the question mark after "this" on G6 v , and the exclamation points after "above" and "edifice" on I4. It will also be found that the printer was often careless in his composition of the reset, whether it was set from the original or, if there was such, the corrected state. Here, for instance, are some obvious errors: on G4 (original and reset), from "Fungoso" to "Fungosa"; on H2 (original and reset), " Insula Fortunata " to " Insula, Fortunata "; on H3 v (corrected and reset), "foode." to "food" (when the word unmistakably comes at the end of a sentence). After Stansby's men had completed Every Man Out , they printed the following plays of the Folio, from Cynthia's Revels to Catiline , in the order in which they appear there. It is the coherence of that order, in conjunction with a brief disruption of it, that I wish to establish in this section of the essay. The plain title-pages for Cynthia's Revels are the same for both large-paper and small-paper and retain the imprint from title-page (6) of Every Man Out , which was left standing: "London, | Printed by William Stansby. | [rule] | M. DC. XVI." The imprint was retained intact for the large-paper title-pages of Poëtaster , the next play in the volume. For the small-paper plain copies it was modified to read: "London, | Printed by William Stansby, | for Matthew Lownes . | [rule] | M. DC. XVI.", with a comma substituted for the period following Stansby's name. In other words, the Stansby alone (which appears only in large-paper copies) imprint was first machined, then modified for the imprint with Lownes . Then, with the comma following Stansby's name still in place from the small-paper Poëtaster title-page, titles for Sejanus (both large- and small-paper) were machined, reading "London, | Printed by William Stansby, | [rule] | M. DC. XVI." For Volpone a new imprint was composed, with the following identifiable characteristics: 26 1) "London" with a distinctive "dot" (no doubt caused by an air bubble when the letter was cast) near the bottom of the vertical of the letter "L"; 2) in Stansby a new "t", the horizontal no longer tilting up to the right; 3) a longer rule (fifty-two millimeters rather than forty), between Stansby's name and the date; 4) in the date, a new "X," with a bulge at the bottom of the left foot. This imprint was left standing for plays six and seven, 27 Volpone and Epicoene . It appears also on the title-page of Every Man In His Humour . As this imprint became altered during the printing of play eight, The Alchemist , we can infer that at least the first part (in fact, the first gathering) of Every Man In was printed about the same time as Volpone (which runs from 2O4 to 2X4 v ) and Epicoene (from 2X5 through 3D5 v ). For well over thirty years Dr. Gerritsen has been aware that "the first quire [of Every Man In ] was printed off roughly concurrently with the first quires of Epicoene ." 28 Gerritsen bases his conclusions on evidence he derived chiefly from the headlines in the volume, although how, precisely, he does not explain. Other evidence, that of the watermarks, can be brought to bear, although it is only somewhat helpful in determining when quire A of Every Man In may have been printed. I have made a chart of all the watermarks (there are more than three dozen of them) in twenty-two small-paper copies of the Folio. A watermark I have designated 12 (two-handled pot with the letters PLS, topped with grapes) appears the most frequently of any in the Folio, but, except in Every Man In , not before the third play, Cynthia's Revels . Watermark 5 (one-handled pot with the letters OLC[?] and the date 1613) appears several places in the Folio, but most frequently in the fifth play, Poëtaster , then in Epicoene and the first two quires of The Alchemist ; it also appears very often in A3.4 of Every Man In . Both the imprints and the watermarks, then, are consistent with Gerritsen's opinion about the printing of quire A. The evidence of the watermarks is much more compelling (which is just as well because, so far as I know, there isn't much other evidence) as it concerns the printing of the last five quires of Every Man In . My watermarks 6 and 7 (difficult to describe — each in its own way a misshapen pot) do not appear at all in the Folio until Epigrammes , 29 which follows the last play, Catiline . Those two watermarks appear often in the last five quires of Every Man In , though never in the first. The imprint of Volpone, Epicoene , and Every Man In appears in the title-page of The Alchemist in some copies of the Folio. However, part way through the printing of that play the period following Stansby's name went missing, 30 perhaps pulled out by an inking ball, and is not to be found in most copies. For Catiline , the imprint was somewhat changed. A new period (somewhat flattened on the bottom) was installed after Stansby's name, the "y" at the end of Stansby's name slipped down (at the same time that the period was replaced?), and the space between the lines (the one above "London" and the one between Stansby's name and the date) was reduced to thirty-four millimeters from thirty-nine. However, the "L" with the distinctive "dot" was retained, as was the "X" with the bulge at the bottom of the left foot. There are four printed title-pages in the remainder of the volume, for Epigrammes (with which The Forrest appears), for Part of the King's Entertainment , for the Entertainment . . . at Althorpe , and for Masques at Court . Stansby's name appears on none of these title-pages. All bear the imprint: "London, | [rule] | M. DC. XVI.", which small fragment seems to have been left standing for the printing of all four. Stansby's men, it would seem, left standing as much matter as they could for the printing of the volume, even if that matter amounted to very little, perhaps no more than a few words. Their practice has proven useful for this study, as the evidence uncovered through a close look at the standing type confirms the order of the printing of the plays. A good example is the fragment "The Author B. I.," which remains unchanged on all of the plain title-pages from Every Man Out to Epicoene and Every Man In . Depending upon the heaviness of the inking, the serifs at the bottom of the letter "A" in this bit of standing type are flat at the base and are scarcely separated at the middle of the letter; even when the inking is relatively light, there is usually a "shadow" between them. Different type is used for "The Author B. I." on the title-pages of The Alchemist and Catiline , which can be determined also by the letter "A." The "A" of "Author" in the title-pages for the last two plays has serifs which are clearly separated and which have slight, but quite discernible, curves in the base. The practice of leaving small portions of type standing began early on in the printing of the Folio, but not, apparently, from the outset. The dramatis personae page for Every Man Out is headed by "The Names of the Actors" (sig. G2 v ); this is altered for all of the following plays (including Every Man In ) to "The Persons of the Play," obviously altogether different. Not so obvious are the differences between various versions of the latter. For Cynthia's Revels , "The Persons" is distinguished by a "dot" about one-third down the vertical of the letter "T," very much similar to the "dot" in the letter "L," discussed above. One can say with a fair degree of certainty that the type was distributed, for the same distinctive letter appears in "THE END" at the conclusion of the play. A different "T" is found in "The Persons" of Poëtaster . This one is not particularly distinctive, but it is clearly different from the "T" of "The Persons" of Sejanus , in which the left part of the horizontal slants slightly downward and the right part wants the downturning serif which, more often than not, is a part of an upper-case "T." Such a serif is to be found in "the Persons" for Volpone and for the plays printed afterward, including Every Man In . Indeed the type seems to have been left standing for the printing of the last four plays. 31 There are several examples of the same standing type being used for the final pages of some plays. 32 Details of type face, of punctuation, and of upper- and lower-case type vary enough that patterns can be detected in the printing of these final pages; one such pattern provides further evidence that the last part of Catiline was printed within some proximity of the last part of Every Man In . The heading that was fashioned for the final page of Every Man Out became the model for all of the rest of the plays in the volume: "This Comicall Satyre [or 'Comoedy' or 'Tragoedy'] was first | acted in the yeere | 1599 [or other]." The type for the heading of the final page of Every Man Out was distributed. A new setting, worded just the same except for the date, was made up for Cynthia's Revels . It was decided, however, that a headline with a page number should be added 33 and that a comma was needed after "acted," which punctuation was retained for all of the rest of the plays. That Stansby's men did not simply insert the comma and retain the rest of the type can be seen in the "w" of "was." In that for Every Man Out , the second of the four strokes distinctly curves back toward the beginning of the letter. In that for Cynthia's Revels , the stroke is perfectly straight. This heading was left intact for the final page of Poëtaster . Indeed, virtually the entire page was left standing, the only alterations required being a change of date and a change of the names of two (of six) actors. Some newly set type was required for the final page of the next play, for Sejanus is, of course, a tragedy, not a comical satire. It is worth noting at this point that the "Tragœdie" is here set with a ligature "œ" in a smaller font than that for the rest of the word. Also, the second element on the page had to be set anew. " By the then Children of Queene | Elizabeths | Chappell." served for both Cynthia's Revels and Poëtaster ; for Sejanus and for the next play, Volpone , it reads: " By the Kings Maiesties | Servants." It is at least likely that this is the same type, for in each case the capital " M " is a swash letter. The heading for the final page of Volpone ("This Comœdie was first | acted, in the yeere | 1605") was altered. It had originally been set with the same ligature "œ" as that used in "Tragœdie" on the final page of Sejanus . Early in the run, apparently, the ligature was replaced with separate letters of the correct font. 34 Save for a necessary change in the date, the entire heading seems to have been left intact for The Alchemist . Except for the heading, after Volpone was printed, most of the type for the final page was distributed. The second element of Epicoene , which had been performed by the Children of the Revels was, of course, different from that of Volpone . Although for The Alchemist its wording was the same as that for Sejanus and Volpone , one can easily see that the type is different because the " M " of " Majesties " is not a swash. The final page of Catiline was set entirely new. The heading reads: "This Tragoedy was first | Acted, in the Yeere | 1611." The lower-case "a" for "acted" in all earlier plays is now upper-case. The second element is: " By the Kings Maiesties | Servants." "Kings" is in roman type and a swash " M " has again been employed. There is yet another piece of evidence that the entire page has been newly set. The last element on each of the final pages is a single line of type, invariably reading: " With the allowance of the Master of Revells" In the case of Every Man Out , for which all of the type on the final page was distributed, there is, as one would expect, a clear dot over the single "i." In Cynthia's Revels , the "i" in "With" is different from that of the earlier version; on the final page of Cynthia's Revels the "dot" is a mere fragment in a piece of slightly broken type (in some copies it prints so faintly that it can scarcely be seen). And in the final pages of the plays following, from Pöetaster through Volpone , the "dot" is missing altogether. The newly set final page of Catiline and the final page of Every Man In have two details in common, the upper-case "A" in "Acted" in the heading and a dot over the "i" in "With" in the bottom line. That is, the word "Tragœdy" was removed from the first line and was replaced by "Comoedy," and the date was changed to 1598. The second line, "Acted, in the Yeere," seems to have been left intact. One cannot be absolutely certain that "Acted, in the Yeere" was unchanged or that the bottom line was. But given the practice of Stansby's shop, at least in the production of the Jonson Folio, the assumption is a reasonable one. Thus, it makes sense to conclude that the final pages of the last two plays were printed within some temporal proximity of each other. As the evidence of the watermarks seems to confirm that the last quires of Every Man In were machined after the printing of Epigrammes was begun, it is very likely that those quires were the final parts of Jonson's plays that Stansby printed.</field>

The single change in it is the result of the disappearance of the hyphen from "use-full" in line 18, which must have occured during the machining of the forme, for in one copy (of nine) of this variant, the hyphen is present. The headline from the reset G5, with the page number "81" mistakenly left in place, was used for the headline of the reset and corrected reset of G2. Gerritsen points out (p. 53) that the largest block of italic type (the body of the Dedication) was not reset, which is almost correct. The first two lines were, in fact, reset; there were several alterations in punctuation later in the text. G2 v , p. 76 In their "Survey of the Text," for line 13 H&amp;S fail to italicize "their servant" (IX, 53) but do get it right in the play (III, 422). For line 23 they note in the "corrected" state: "Rustici" (above "Fungoso"), which also appears in their edition of the play. I have not been able to find this variant anywhere, including in the Grenville copy at the British Library, which is cited in their notes (IX, 53). This ghostly fragment may be similar to a couple noted by Parker in his edition of Volpone (p. 358).

The stage-direction, between lines 51 and 52, " Here hee makes address to the People ," appears at "the left extending into the outer margin, . . . [and at] the right, extending to the inner margin" (H&amp;S, IX, 54). In at least one copy the stage direction at the right is broken off after the first letter of the . The page also appears without the stage-direction, both in the original and in the reset. The most likely order is this: The stage-direction at the left was thought unsightly and it was moved to the inner margin; when the stage-direction broke, it was removed and several lines of the page were re-spaced, "giving the page an irregular look" (H&amp;S, IX, 53). When the page was reset the lines were spaced evenly. G6, p. 83 Herford and Simpson seem to have noticed all the variants between the original and the reset page. In their assessment of the reasons for the changes, however, they are wrong, misled by their belief in the authority of "large-paper" (including "Ford") copies. They contend that "one change on pages 82 and 83 of the Folio . . . corrected a printer's error in the setting of the verse. Jonson liked his lines to be marshalled in even column, and he kept strictly to the verse-arrangement when a speech did not begin the line" (III, 416). It is much more likely that the printer was rearranging lines so that the page of the reset would end at the same place as the original.

Broadly speaking, they are right, but they do not deal with the most significant implication of what they say.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Gerritsen, rev. of Ben Jonson , ed. C. H. Herford and Percy and Evelyn Simpson, vols. IX — XI (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1950 — 52), English Studies 38 (1957), 121. All citations of Jonson are from this edition, 11 vols. (1925 — 52), referred to hereafter as H&amp;S; i/j and u/v have been regularized to conform with modern practice. I am grateful to John Bidwell for his useful advice. 2 These succinct terms are those of W. W. Greg, in A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration (London: The Bibliographical Society, 1939 — 1959; rprt. 1970), III, 1071. For convenience, I shall use Greg's terminology where I can. 3 R. B. McKerrow and F. S. Ferguson, Title-page Borders used in England &amp; Scotland, 1485 — 1640 (London: The Bibliographical Society, 1932). McKerrow and Ferguson, who do not note the Jonson title-pages, mistakenly cite for the first appearance of the compartment several of the subtitles in Stansby's "1617" printing of Hooker's Lawes of Ecclesiasticall Politie . Even though the Hooker subtitle for Book 5 bears the date "1616," it can be seen that the Jonson plays must have been printed earlier. The woodcut border sustained damage during its use; the crack "through the jewel at the foot on left" noticed by McKerrow and Ferguson (p. 177) began to appear as the in compartment title-page for Poëtaster was being machined. 4 "Alone" is Greg's term; it signifies that no other name appears with Stansby's in the imprint. 5 I follow the spelling of Smithwicke as it appears on the title-pages instead of the more usual spelling of Smethwick or Smethwicke, as found in Herford and Simpson, Greg, and the New STC. 6 At one place in Epicoene ("sheet Yy [Act I and Act II up to scene ii, line 64]"), to account for sloppy printing in all three of the large-paper copies that they consulted, they offer the following conjecture: "The dislocation in sheet Yy must have occurred when the edition was being printed off and after Jonson had passed the proofs. It was probably due to an accident in the printing-house — for instance, to a workman dropping the formes. It was reset without consulting Jonson. What would he have said if he had discovered a copy in this state can be but faintly imagined" (V, 148 — 149). See, also, IX, 40. 7 Herford and Simpson also mistakenly assume that the reset page 84 (sig. G6 v ) appears only in large-paper copies (IX, 56). 8 "The Final Quires of the Jonson 1616 Workes : Headline Evidence," Studies in Bibliography , 40 (1987), 119. See, also, J. A. Riddell, "The Concluding Pages of the Jonson Folio of 1616," SB 47 (1994), 147 — 154. Gerritsen has noticed several large-paper sheets in Every Man Out with the original settings (p. 54 in "Stansby and Jonson Produce a Folio," English Studies , 40 [1959], 52 — 55). 9 As Stansby's men, like others, used swash and "normal" italic letters indifferently, it seems most likely that those letters were distributed into the same compartments. McKerrow notes that "these swash letters, whatever may have been their original purpose, seem to have been used at all times absolutely interchangeably with the plain letters in all positions." He also notes that such use itself may be of interest in bibliographical investigation (R. B. McKerrow, Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1927; 2nd impr., corrected 1928], p. 296). For a few more examples (on one page) in the Jonson Folio see: the penultimate line in the Prologue for Epicoene (sig. 2Y v , original and reset), the plain and swash " M " in " Muse "; two lines further on the same page, the plain and swash " A " in " Another "; fifteen lines further on the same page, the plain and swash " A " in " Act " (that the plain and swash letters were used indifferently can also be inferred from the fact that on both the original and the reset page there is one plain " A " and one swash, that is, they were merely exchanged between " Another " and " Act " in the reset). Throughout the volume swash and plain varieties of " A " are used willy-nilly in the word " Act ." See, also, the discussion of swash and plain " M " in the final pages of the plays, below. 10 The textual apparatus for Every Man Out is silent on the matter; the "it is" for "'tis" which appears in the reset variant is ascribed in the apparatus only to the 1640 and 1692 Folios. The "it is" of the reset variant is recorded in the "Textual Survey" (IX, 56), where the implication is that only large-paper copies had the reset G6 v sheet. In fact, it appears also in a number of small-paper copies. 11 British Library, shelf-mark G. 11630. 12 A greater bibliographer could make the same mistake. Jackson incorrectly identified the Elizabethan Club (Dent-Gott) copy as being large-paper (William A. Jackson, The Carl H. Pforzheimer Library, English Literature, 1475 — 1700 , 3 vols. [New York: (The Merrill Press), 1940], II, 573, n.). Large-paper copies can most easily be identified by watermark. So far as I am aware, there is only one kind of watermark in the large-paper copies; it is characterized by a shield with three lions. I have briefly discussed this topic on pages 152 — 153 in "The Concluding Pages of the Jonson Folio of 1616." 13 Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1932, pp. 6 — 7. That it is the copy that Herford and Simpson consulted, see H&amp;S, IX, 40. 14 Ford does not say how he measured the width of the page. He gives the width of the Grenville large-paper copy as 8 ⅖” and the Douce as 7 ¼”; I make them to be no more than 8 ¼” and 7”. After this article was completed, the Huntington Library was given by Mr. Kendrick Schlatter a collection of books that included 1616 — 1640 Jonson Folios, with the following in pencil on the free endpaper of the first volume: "Note these two volumes are | those chiefly mentioned in | Collation of the Ben Jonson Folios | 1616 — 31 — 40 — — Oxford 1932 — — | By H L Ford." The first of these is the volume that Ford calls his "premier copy," and an inspection of it reveals his method of measuring. He measured the vertical dimension off of a page (11 ⅛”); he measured the horizontal along the inside cover from the back of the spine to the front edge of the cover (7 ⁷⁄₁₆”). The volume is printed, as I had supposed, on small paper stock. There is confirmation that the volumes are those owned by Ford from the text of Vol. II. The "trial title-page" for Bartholmew Fayre , as described and illustrated by Herford and Simpson (VI, 4 and 9) is that present in the Schlatter set. Herford and Simpson identify the photo illustration on page 9 as coming from Ford's copy. The Schlatter copy is identical, including a distinctive small ink mark below the left-hand side of the epigraph and a smudge below the right-hand side. 15 Huntington, 12 ⅝”; Clark, 12 ⅜”; Grenville (British Library), 12 ¾” (as noted by Ford [I measure it as 12 ⅝”]); Crocker, 13 ¼” (as noted by Jackson). 16 Greg uses a set of symbols; I have translated the symbols into letters for convenience. 17 Greg's four title-pages and my six are reconciled thus: Greg makes no distinction between (3) and (4), but he does note a "variant: without Hor. in the margin," without attempting to account for it. He makes no distinction between (2) and (6). 18 On the other hand, a copy at the Folger (shelfmark 14751, copy 3) can boast two, one in compartment and an (added) plain . 19 The unusual, perhaps now unique, copy at the Bodleian (Douce, I. 302). 20 At the William A. Clark Library (shelf-mark PR 2600 / 1616), Harvard (Widener 60 — 1116), and Beinecke (1978 / +50). 21 Why Smithwicke's (or Smethwick's) name should appear at all is not clear, for as Greg notes, he "had no traceable interest" in the play (III, 1072). 22 The accounting of Herford and Simpson is, of course, only partial: "A minor variant is the omission of 'Hor.' in both forms of the title-page, its insertion in the right margin in some copies [i. e., number (4)], and the centering of it above the quotation in the large-paper copies [i. e., number (6)]" (IX, 20, n. 2). 23 For a chart of the distribution of the skeletons and a description of the alteration, see Appendix I. 24 Another skeleton, "VII," is used for the rest of the formes. 25 Some "mysterious resettings [on T2.5, 2X1.6, 3A1.6, and 3T1.6] made after the Folio had been published," perhaps about 1640, as suggested by Herford and Simpson (IX, 40), apparently do not bear on the present argument. It should be mentioned that all of these "mysterious resettings" derive from only one source, the "mysterious" Ford "A" copy. Gerritsen adds to the "reset" sheets of the Oxford editors Q3.4, 2M1.6, and 3L3.4, but thinks that all were printed much earlier than 1640 ("Stansby and Jonson Produce a Folio," p. 55). Whatever reset sheets there may be other than those for quires G and H and I3.4, they would have been reset for some reason other than enlarging the press-run. 26 Most likely the entire imprint was newly composed. These are the distinctive qualities that I could identify. 27 I number the plays in the order of their appearance in the Folio. 28 Johan Gerritsen, "Stansby and Jonson Produce a Folio," p. 54. 29 Except in two sheets (of a possible sixty-six) the misshapen watermarks do not appear in Epigrammes until about half way through the printing of that section, but after that they appear with great frequency. 30 It seems to have lasted through about ten or twelve percent of the press-run. Of twenty-seven copies that I have recently examined, including three large-paper, three (all small-paper) have the comma present. 31 It may well be that other small bits of type were left standing, for instance, " A Comœdie ," as it appears on the title-pages of Epicoene and Every Man In , but in most cases the type is so regular that one cannot be sure. 32 I have not detected any variants in these final pages, and none is noticed by Herford and Simpson. 33 The page number is set within parentheses, between rules, in the center of the page. Such page numbers appear on all final pages of plays after Every Man Out . 34 R. B. Parker finds the ligature in three of the forty copies of the Folio that he collated for his Revels edition of Volpone (1983, p. 357). He also notes that Dr. Gerritsen had seen eight copies with it; I have seen it in two copies of twenty seven that I have recently examined. Parker calls it " State 3," although it should be considered to be the first of two states. Parker's " State 2" (with "Como die," missing the medial "e") is simply an error, one which I think I must have introduced when I corresponded with Professor Parker as he was working on his edition, some twenty years ago. 35 The dagger represents the running-title introduced at P3 and reused (though with different rules) three times in reset quire G.</field>

'Signior Dildo'" ( Studies in Bibliography 46 [1993], 250 — 262) I presented a collation of the nine surviving manuscript texts and the one significant printed text of the Restoration lampoon, usually but not conclusively attributed to Rochester. My argument was that the texts that have been used as the basis for modern editions represent a distinct recension (the B version) which differs from the form in which the poem was originally read at court late in 1673 (the A version). I do not assert dogmatically that the B version is a later revision unconnected with the original phase of composition, but there is certainly circumstantial evidence to that effect, including the fact that its sources are all at least seventeen years later than the date of first circulation. The A version, on the other hand, is recorded in a copy written within weeks of that date. The A version survives in two already known sources, Bodleian MS don. b 8, pp. 477 — 478, 480 — 482 and British Library MS Harley 7317, ff. 65 r — 67 r , and a newly discovered third source to be discussed shortly. The Bodleian manuscript is the personal miscellany of the courtier Sir William Haward, a gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles II, while the Harleian text represents a much later copy from a "linked group" which also contained a demonstrably early text of Rochester's "In th' Isle of Britain." 1 In the Haward text, the poem is divided into two sections separated by a pindaric ode on the Bible, the second section being headed "Additions to Seigneur Dildoe." It seems likely that the first section represents the form in which the poem was initially sung, recited and passed from hand to hand at Whitehall, and the second a selection of stanzas added by its various readers. 2 The version in Harleian 7317 has the poem as an unbroken sequence but disagrees with Haward over the order of stanzas and numerous readings, while at the same time agreeing strikingly with it against the manuscripts of the B version. These, by contrast, are relatively invariant except where the order of stanzas has become disrupted by eyeskips. The distinction suggests two quite different modes of distribution. The composition of the A version was clearly prompted by the wedding of the Duke of York in November 1673: it might even have been written for performance as a set of fescennine verses during this period — possibly with the king present. 3 It would seem to have circulated very rapidly through the court, acquiring new material as it went and being subject to constant rewriting by those who sang or recited it. There may even have been episodes of memorial transmission of the kind that led much later to a single stanza from it being written by a reader into the margin of a B-version manuscript. 4 The B text, on the other hand, is found only in manuscript anthologies of lampoons written for sale by the "Cameron" scriptorium and by one other, as yet unidentified, scribe. 5 Its mode of replication was intrinsically more stable, and its intended readership was also different, not being concerned with the poem as a repository of current scandal but as a precursor of post-1688 anti-Jacobite satire. The importance of the new text, which was kindly brought to my attention by Peter Beal, is that it gives us a third version of the earliest or A version, and that its form both supports and strengthens my assumption about the earlier stages of circulation. It should also be noted that it is not attributed to Rochester! Contained in an uncatalogued manuscript in the Powis papers in the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth, it has been identified by Beal as in the hand of another courtier of the time, Sir Edward Herbert. It agrees with Haward but with no other manuscript in including the name of the tune to which the poem was originally sung, and shares most of its characteristic readings. It also further demonstrates the agglutinative tendency of the earliest period of circulation by containing twelve lines found in no other source. The text of the new version is given here with the permission of the National Library of Wales. Its variants from the other sources can be established by referring to the collation printed in my earlier article. The variants in line order relative to the base text (that of the B-version text, British Library Harley MS 7319, fols 4 r — 6 v ) are as follows: 1 — 16, 29 — 32, 17 — 24, 24.1 — 24.8, 57 — 60, 36.1 — 36.4, 49 — 56, 〈4 unique lines〉, 73 — 76, 61 — 64, 〈4 unique lines〉, 65 — 72, 28.25 — 28.32, 33 — 36, 40.1 — 40.4, 81 — 92, 〈4 unique lines〉, 92.1 — 92.4 Decimalized numbers are those that do not appear at all in the B version. The order of Powis up to its l. 64 (which is also l. 64 of the base text) is in effect that of the Haward MS, section one, with two quatrains interpolated. One of these, 36.1 — 36.4, also present in the Haward "Additions," interrupts a sub-narrative involving the Earl of St Albans and three court ladies who are disturbed by his departure with the signior: this is clearly misplaced. (The B version also violates this sequence; but by reversing the order of the stanzas. Harley 7317 interpolates different material without reversal.) The second interpolation is unique to the Powis MS, and comes between ll. 56 and 73 in the numeration of the base text (Powis, ll. 53 — 56). The order of the lines in the remainder of the poem has no particular resemblance to either Haward section two or to Harleian 7317, as can be seen from the following: Haward "Additions": 33 — 36, 36.1 — 36.4, 25 — 28, 28.1 — 28.32, 81 — 92, 92.1 — 92.4, 65 — 72, 41 — 44, 37 — 40, 40.1 — 40.4 Harley 7317 (entire): 1 — 24, 24.1 — 24.8, 29 — 32, 25 — 28, 57 — 60, 33 — 36, 45 — 48, 41 — 44, 49 — 56, 65 — 72, 61 — 64, 73 — 76 The similarities in order between Powis and Haward suggest that they derive from a common source in which the order of the earlier stanzas was reasonably stable, but the later stanzas were recorded on stray fragments of paper which might be placed in any order for copying. But it is also clear that text was gained during subsequent transcription, namely that which is unique to the two manuscripts (base text lines 28.1 — 28.24 in the case of Haward and ll. 53 — 56, 65 — 68 and 105 — 108 in Powis's own lineation). 6 Harley 7317 stands closer to both the order and the content of the B version and like it fails to indicate that the poem was for singing. This transcription is based on copies supplied by the National Library of Wales and has been prepared with the help of Meredith Sherlock. The manuscript is written in a hurried, careless hand which at times represents the final and middle letters of words by minimal undulations of the pen. Words are frequently run into each other with the final letter of the first word almost disappearing and final "m" becoming indistinguishable from "n." Minuscule "o" is written several times as a single inclined stroke or shallow loop resembling a careless italic "e." Italic, secretary and Greek forms of "e" are used indiscriminately. There is virtually no punctuation. It is often quite impossible to tell whether the first letter of a word is capital or minuscule. In the absence of any other way of discriminating between the two, I have assumed that the first letter of a line and of a proper name is a capital unless its form clearly indicates otherwise, reversing the rule for other words. For reference, the lineation of the base text is given, in parentheses, after that of the current version.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">As will be seen by referring to the collation published in my earlier article, Powis consistently agrees with Haward against all other texts. However, stanzas 18 and 22, in particular, contain readings in which it pairs with Harley 7317, the third A-group text, against Haward. At line 76 (72) the Powis reading implies an anatomical impossibility: in all other versions of the poem the insult is directed much more plausibly by Knight to the signior. A particularly striking variant is "Tu Quoque" (l. 77 [28.25]) for Haward's "Togate." Here "Togate" definitely makes better sense as well as preserving the meter. At l. 103 (91) Haward's "ouerladed" is likewise better than Powis's "o're headed": on the other hand the Powis reading could easily be the source, through the loss of "o'," of the "retarded" of the remaining texts. The scribe is to be congratulated on preserving the correct spelling for the Marquis D'Angeau referred to in l. 111 (92.3), Haward (who should have known better) having corrupted him to "Ansou." Another point of interest is the spelling "Seignior" in line 4 of Powis, after which it is replaced by "Signior." Haward carefully writes "Seigneur" in the first section and in the title of the "Additions," and "Seignior" in the rest of the "Additions." "Seignor" is used throughout Harley 7317. The B-version manuscripts all use "Signior" as their predominant form; however, as mentioned in my earlier article, the "Seig" variant recurs sporadically in Harley 7319 and in three of the Cameron scriptorium texts. While granting that Restoration scribes were more likely to be familiar with French than Italian, it seems clear that the "Seig" spelling was that of the ancestor.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Attributions of Authorship in the Gentleman's Magazine , 1827 — 48: A Supplement to Kuist by Emily Lorraine de Montluzin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The following is the fifth installment in my series of articles designed to expand and, where necessary, to correct James M. Kuist's The Nichols File of The Gentleman's Magazine: Attributions of Authorship and Other Documentation in Editorial Papers at the Folger Library (Madison: U of Wisconsin P, 1982). For researchers active in the field of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British press history, especially those familiar with the Gentleman's Magazine and with John Nichols, the GM's long-time editor and presiding genius, Kuist's Nichols File needs little introduction. Based as it is on marginal annotations faithfully recorded by successive generations of the Nichols family in the staff copy of the Gentleman's Magazine, The Nichols File has provided scholars with nearly 13,000 attributions of authorship of hitherto anonymous letters, articles, reviews, and poems appearing in the Magazine from its beginning in 1731 through 1856, the year the Nichols family relinquished ownership of the enterprise. Kuist's Nichols File does not purport, however, to provide a complete listing of the author of every contribution to the Gentleman's Magazine during the first 125 years of its history. As Kuist made the deliberate decision to include only those attributions of authorship specifically recorded in handwriting on the pages of the staff copy of the GM, The Nichols File is perforce limited in its scope and contains a multitude of omissions. Despite the care lavished on their massive task of annotation by John Nichols's son John Bowyer 1 and others in his family, vast numbers of attributions slipped through the net, some through haste or carelessness, some because their authorship defied all efforts at identification, others conversely because their authors' identities seemed at the time too obvious for anyone to bother writing down. Fortunately, thousands of the missing attributions of authorship can still be supplied through a variety of means: lists of known pseudonyms and sets of initials contained in Kuist's own index, information available in contemporary literary memoirs and the GM 's columns of obituaries, the matching of authors with the towns and sometimes even street addresses whence they wrote, the unscrambling of anagrams, and a gold mine of hundreds of leads concerning the authorship of GM contributions provided in Kuist's Catalogue II, which lists manuscripts, documents, and unpublished letters housed in the Folger's Nichols File. The present article undertakes to update Kuist's Nichols File by providing 523 new or corrected attributions of authorship representing 183 contributors and covering the period from 1827 through 1848. It thus serves as a continuation of my four companion-piece articles, "Attributions of Authorship in the Gentleman's Magazine, 1731 — 77: A Supplement to Kuist," Studies in Bibliography 44 (1991): 271 — 302; "Attributions of Authorship . . ., 1778 — 92 . . .," Studies in Bibliography 45 (1992): 158 — 187; "Attributions of Authorship . . ., 1793 — 1808 . . .," Studies in Bibliography 46 (1993): 320 — 349; and "Attributions of Authorship . . ., 1809 — 26 . . .," Studies in Bibliography 47 (1994): 164 — 195. In some respects opportunities for supplying missing attributions of authorship are more limited in the time period covered by this article than in the years spanned by the previous four installments. With changing times and customs, fewer contributors indulged in the literary game of signing letters with reverse initials, classical pseudonyms, or artfully crafted anagrams. With altered editorial policies after John Nichols's death in 1826 and the commencement of new series in 1834 and 1856, less and less space was allotted to letters to the editor from the GM 's far-flung readership. The thousands of letters to Sylvanus Urban, by turns whimsical or argumentative or recondite, that had been the mainstay of the Magazine in John Nichols's day dwindled in the decades after his death to a trickle, relegated increasingly to the Minor Correspondence page or to the filler rounding out each monthly number. Mr. Urban in his mid-nineteenth-century incarnation was clearly less interested in the topics and passions that had preoccupied his eighteenth-century readers: the interpretation of a troublesome passage in Juvenal; 2 details of a newly discovered Roman coin; 3 helpful methods for destroying black beetles in London kitchens; 4 the elucidation of the origins of the phrase "to run amuck"; 5 the minute description of "a curious, and . . . non-descript . . . caterpillar . . . uncommonly large and beautiful," found in a potato field in Kent. 6 Under the direction of Bowyer Nichols and his editor, the Rev. John Mitford, longer articles and reviews, written by a staff of paid contributors, replaced the myriad short items and letters on a vast variety of subjects that had formerly crowded Mr. Urban's pages (Kuist 4). In addition, contributions tended more and more to be signed, as authors ceased to bother with maintaining the pretense of anonymity. The decades of the 1830's, 1840's, and 1850's do, however, offer new opportunities for identification of contributors from an entirely different quarter — the thousands of manuscript articles and unprinted letters dating mainly from that period which form a separate part of the Nichols File at the Folger and which Kuist lists in his Catalogue II. With the help of information contained in Catalogue II it is possible to arrive at hundreds of additional attributions of authorship, though the use of Catalogue II requires caution. Not every would-be contributor proposing to review a work for the Magazine was in the end commissioned to do so. In addition, as Catalogue II demonstrates, in various instances several writers sent letters to Bowyer Nichols and his staff offering to review the same publication. In the present article all attributions of authorship based on offers from would-be contributors to supply book reviews, memoirs, and the like have been assigned a question mark unless the evidence makes it quite clear that the proffered material was actually accepted. The mechanics in this article remain the same as those used in the four previous installments. All finds are cross-listed, with each item appearing in both the Chronological Listing and the Synopsis by Contributor. The Chronological Listing utilizes short titles throughout and employs the following designations: L: letter to Sylvanus Urban A: article, note, or query (including "Minor Correspondence" items) R: review V: poetry O: obituary S: staff item of editorial content As usual the Chronological Listing provides in brackets the source of each attribution of authorship, the abbreviation "Sig." designating items assigned on the basis of known pseudonyms or initials, especially when internal evidence (for example, the incidence of place-names) corroborates the attributions. Full names of authors (plus birth and death dates when available) appear in the Synopsis by Contributor, the two William Robinsons being differentiated by the abbreviations "Eld." or "Yngr."

      <field name="fulltext">In his own time, James Parker was probably as well known an engraver as his old friend and partner William Blake. 3 From the time when the two men were fellow-apprentices under James Basire, their careers were significantly parallel until Parker's early death in 1805. They went on a sailing expedition with Thomas Stothard about 1780 and were arrested as spies; they were married within a few days of one another in 1782; they lived in the same house at 27 Broad Street and shared a print-selling business in 1784 — 85; they made engravings for some of the same works; 4 and in the last year of Parker's life Blake was still consulting him about professional matters. Theirs was clearly a life-long and close professional friendship. James Parker's career probably conforms a good deal more closely to what Blake's parents hoped for him when they apprenticed him in 1772 than Blake's did. Parker was a quiet, orderly, dependable man, 5 whose engravings were delivered when he said they would be, 6 and who became a leader among his peers, particularly in helping to found the Society of Engravers in 1802. Flaxman's sketch of him shows a solid, self-confident, prosperous man, whose hair is cut close enough to enable him to wear a wig (see Plate 1). By contrast, Blake was seen as an eccentric solitary, an "insane genius" whose poetry and visions interrupted his proper business of engraving, and whose portrait by Phillips shows him as an artist with a brush rather than as an engraver (see Plate 2). Indeed, so unbusinesslike was Blake that his wife scarcely liked to mention that the cupboard was bare and merely served him at dinner with an empty plate. An outline of the career of James Parker may help to indicate what William Blake might have become had he been a mere journeyman rather than a genius. James Parker was born in 1750 and was thus seven years older than William Blake. The earliest record of him is when on 3 August 1773, James Parker Son of Paul of S. t Mary le Strand cornchandler [was apprenticed] to James Basire of Great Queen Street Lincolns Inn ffields Engraver [for] seven years [for a] Cons[ideratio]. n £52.10 . . . paid by his ffather[.] 7 Like William Blake, Parker was the son of a London tradesman, and, also like Blake (presumably), he had shown more aptitude for art than for commerce. Like William Blake, who had been bound apprentice to Basire at the same fee just a year earlier, on 4 August 1772, 8 James Parker did not, on the completion of his apprenticeship, take up the freedom of the city which would have entitled him to take apprentices and set up a business of his own — though he was prepared to do the former and did do the latter. Note that Parker was apprenticed not as an adolescent but as a young man of about twenty-three. The difference in age between sixteen (Blake's age in 1773) and twenty-three is, of course, immense; when (presumably) Parker and Blake first met in 1773, Blake was in the throes of adolescence, writing poetry and envious of his elders, while Parker was a young man. On the other hand, Blake was an artistic genius and had already had a year of training as an engraver when Parker began his apprenticeship. Each may have had something to learn from the other. When William Blake completed his apprenticeship in 1779, he enrolled at the Royal Academy to study further as an artist, but Parker did not. It was probably about 1780, when Parker was free of his apprenticeship, that he went with Blake and the rising young artist Thomas Stothard on a sketching expedition sailing up the Medway. Stothard made a sketch of their camp by the riverside, with the sail stretched over the boat for a tent, and with a print of it is a note: This print is curious[;] the following is its history — Stothard, Blake &amp; I believe Parkes [i.e., Parker] an Engraver pupil with Blake &amp; Basire — during the late War went upon a sailing Excursion for some days [on the Medway;] they landed &amp; Encamped as this plate represents[;] they were there found [by some soldiers] and taken before some authority as spies [for the French Government] and narrowly escaped further trouble[,] perhaps danger [when some members of the Royal Academy, to whom they had appealed, testified as to their loyal character]. H aving got their liberty they returned home — This is the account of Frederick Tatham recieved from M. rs Blake[.] 9 Such shared experiences are likely to have cemented the friendship between the three men. In later years, when Stothard was becoming the most prolific book-illustrator of his time, his designs were often engraved by Blake (more than 30) and Parker (more than 57), and doubtless Stothard occasionally directed commissions to them — on 24 March 1805 Parker wrote that he was "obliged to his friend M. r Stothard, for having 'so often recommended M r Parker to M r Du Roveray's notice'" as an engraver (see below). 10 According to his Marriage Allegation of 17 August 1782, James Parker (aged 25 and up [i.e., 32]), Stationer of the Parish of St Dunstan in the West, was to marry Ann Serjeantson of Long Preston in the County of York (aged 21 and up) at Long Preston. 11 One wonders how he had met a young woman from as far away as Yorkshire. Can there be a connection with Blake's friend John Flaxman, whose family came from Yorkshire? On 13 August 1782 "William Blake a Batchelor and Catharine Butcher [or Boucher] a Spinster" took out a license so that they "may solemnize Marriage together", and on 18 August they were married in the church of St Mary, Battersea, just south of London. Ann Serjeantson Parker became of importance to Blake and his wife, for they all four lived together for more than a year — and perhaps their marriages so close together were a deliberate prelude to this household-sharing. In 1784 the Blakes and the Parkers set up a print-shop together at 27 Broad Street, Golden Square, Westminster, next door to where Blake had been born and where he was brought up until he went to live with Basire's family when he was fifteen. This was a somewhat bold enterprise, for print-shops were then uncommon. Only twenty-six years later, on 2 July 1800, Blake wrote: "We remember when a Print shop was a rare bird in London", though "There are now [1800], I believe, . . . as many Printshops as of any other trade" [p. 1535]. Blake's father died in July 1784, and Blake may have inherited enough money to pay for his share of the print-shop partnership with James Parker. He probably acquired then the printing-press with which he was still printing in 1800 and indeed 1827, while Parker may have provided prints for their stock-in-trade. At this time Blake was attending the literary salons of Mrs Harriet Mathew, a minor blue-stocking, and her husband the Reverend Anthony Stephen Mathew had joined John Flaxman in paying for the printing of the little collection called Poetical Sketches by W. B. (1783), A. S. Mathew writing the apologetic preface to it. A year or so later, Blake "continued to benefit from Mrs. Mathew's liberality, and was enabled to continue in partnership, as a Printseller, with his fellow-pupil, Parker, in a shop, No. 27, next door to his father's, in Broad-street". 12 According to records for payments of the Paving Rates for Golden Square Ward, Westminster, in 1784, "Parker &amp; Blake" replaced William Neville in the last house [No. 27] in Broad Street North before it meets Marshall Street East, next door to James Blake's haberdashery shop at 28 Broad Street, and, on the basis of a rent of £16, they paid a Rate of 16 s . 8 d .; 13 in 1785 "Ja s Parker &amp; W m Blake [on a rent of £] 18 [paid Poor Rates of £]2..2.. — ", 14 but in fact Blake had moved out in the last quarter of the year. 15 We do not know how the business was run, or indeed much of what they sold, but it seems likely that Parker and Blake made and printed engravings, while their wives ran the shop itself. At any rate, according to an early biography of Blake, "His wife attended to the business, and Blake continued to engrave, and took Robert, his favourite brother, for a pupil. This speculation did not succeed — his brother too sickened and died; he had a dispute with Parker — the shop was relinquished [by Blake]". 16 The only prints known to have been published by the firm of Parker &amp; Blake were Blake's oval engravings after their friend Stothard of "Zephyrus and Flora" and "Calisto" (only six copies known of each) which were "Published as the Act directs Dec r 17. 1784 by Parker &amp; Blake N° 27 Broad S t Golden Square". 17 It seems likely, however, that they sold prints by other engravers and print-sellers, and perhaps Parker too made some engravings for the firm of Parker &amp; Blake. The print-firm of Parker &amp; Blake apparently lasted only a little more than a year at 27 Broad Street, from early 1784 through late 1785. We do not know the cause of the dissolution of the partnership, but the "dispute", if there was one, apparently did not disrupt the long friendship of Parker and Blake. As both men were keen print-collectors, there may have been some difficulty as to which prints were for sale and which were parts of their private collections. When the firm was dissolved, Blake probably took with him the printing-press, leaving Parker in the shop-premises at 27 Broad Street and perhaps with the stock of prints they had accumulated. Parker continued paying the Paving Rates at 27 Broad Street in 1787 — 1794, 18 and he probably continued to sell prints there as well. While he was living there, in 1788, "James Parker N° 27 Broad Street Engraver" voted for Townsend (not Hood), 19 and in 1790 he voted for Fox (not Hood or Tooke) and wasted one of his votes. 20 Note that William Blake did not vote in any election when he was qualified to do so by having paid the rates, though his father and brother did. During the 1790s, both Blake and Parker were comparatively prosperous; about 1795 Blake received the largest commission he was ever to be given, for a hundred and fifty quarto-size engravings in illustration of Young's Night Thoughts (Part One with 43 plates was published in 1797), and Parker was prosperous enough to think of taking an apprentice. On 27 August 1795 John Flaxman wrote to William Hayley saying that Hayley's friend Weller, a carver (like Flaxman's father), wished to apprentice his son to an engraver. "M: r Sharpe is not inclined to take a pupil", but Flaxman's old friend Parker is; "he is one of those Steady, persevering men, who is constantly advancing in the best pursuits of his art, he is besides, religious, mild &amp; conscientious". He would ask £210 for five years. 21 Notice the size of the premium Parker is asking: exactly four times what he and Blake had paid — and for five years rather than seven. He must indeed have been in a prosperous way if he felt he had enough engraving work, and enough room in his house, to share them with an apprentice. During these years, Parker worked on some of the most ambitious illustrated books of that or any other time in England: For Robert Bowyer's magnificent folio edition of Hume's History of England (1793 — 1806) he made thirteen plates from 1795 through 1805, including particularly fine ones of "Balliol Surrendering his Crown to Edward I" after Opie (1799 — see Plate 3) and "Charles II. and Sir William Temple" after Stothard (1805); and for the most splendid of them all, John Boydell's Dramatic Works of Shakspeare (1791 — 1802) he engraved eleven folio plates, 22 including an admirable one after Fuseli for Midsummer-Night's Dream (1799) and, even more impressive, an atlas folio plate of Lady Macbeth with the letter after Westall (1800). However, he engraved no plate for Thomas Macklin's equally magnificent The Old [and New ] Testament, Embellished with Engravings, from Pictures and Designs by the Most Eminent English Artists (1791 — 1800), though he did make other engravings for Macklin — and was handsomely paid for them: "Fainasollis Borbar &amp; Fingal" (for which he was paid £80 — see Plate 4) and "The Fall of Agandecca" (£180) after J. Barralet and "Cymbeline" (£80) and "The Merry Wives of Windsor" (£70) after S. Harding; 23 they are listed in Macklin's Poetic Description of Choice and Valuable Prints (1794), and the copper-plates were offered in Macklin's posthumous auction 31 March — 4 April 1808 (Peter Coxe). During these years William Blake's professional career was changing in direction. He had been commissioned about 1795 by Richard Edwards to make 537 large watercolours for Young's Night Thoughts , 150 of which he was to engrave himself, and in 1799 by Thomas Butts to make fifty watercolour illustrations of the Bible. (So far as we know, James Parker made no original designs, though of course he had to copy designs by others in reduced size in order to engrave them.) Further, in 1800 — 1803, Blake largely withdrew from the London engraving market to live as the protegé of William Hayley in the little sea-side village of Felpham in Sussex, making designs and engravings for Hayley's popular poetry and biographies. When he returned to London, he found that the booksellers ignored him. On 7 October 1803 he wrote to Hayley: "Art in London flourishes. Every Engraver turns away work that he cannot execute from his superabundant Employmen t , yet no one brings work to me. . . . Yet I laugh &amp; sing for if on Earth neglected I am in heaven a Prince among Princes &amp; even on Earth beloved by the Good as a Good Man . . .". And two years later, on 11 December 1805, he wrote again to Hayley: "I was alive &amp; in health &amp; with the same Talents I now have all the time of Boydells Macklins Bowyers &amp; other Great Works. I was known by them &amp; was lookd upon by them as Incapable of Employment in those Works . . .". And in a disingenuous little verse he asked: Was I . . . angry with Macklin or Boydel or Bowyer Because they did not say 'O what a Beau ye are'[?] (p. 937) Blake was not employed in those "Great Works" except for one plate for Shakspeare, 24 whereas Parker engraved twenty-four plates for them. In terms of standing with the great illustrated-book publishers of the 1790s, there can be little doubt that James Parker was thought much more reliable than William Blake. During these difficult years for Blake, he clearly remained on close terms with Parker, for one of the very small number of the complete collection of four Designs to a Series of Ballads (June — August 1802) by William Hayley engraved and published by Blake has on the original blue paper covers the name in old brown ink of "J. Parker". 25 About 1801 the engravers who were working on the plates after Robert Smirke's designs for The Arabian Nights (1802), including Heath, Fittler, Anker Smith, Neagle, Parker, Warren, Armstrong, and Raimbach, began to meet monthly at one anothers' houses, and from these meetings grew the Society of Engravers. 26 Clearly Parker was a member of the group, and a "SET OF Engraver's PROOFS [was] PRESENTED TO MR. PARKER by his compeers in this beautiful work". 27 Indeed, he became one of the twenty-four Governors of the Society of Engravers 28 and was influential in the conduct of the profession. During the brief Peace of Amiens of 1802 — 1803, the amateur illustrated-book publisher F. J. Du Roveray proposed that he should employ French engravers for his next book to foster a rivalry between French and English engravers. The implication that their work needed such a stimulus so incensed the English engravers that they refused for a time to work for Du Roveray — and when England renewed the war with France in 1803 the French engravers were no longer accessible to him. Du Roveray appealed to many English engravers, and particularly to James Parker, to make plates for him. On 24 March 1803 Parker replied to him: J Parker presents his Compliments to M r Du Roveray: by his note he finds himself obliged to his friend M. r Stothard, for having 'so often recommended M r Parker to M r Du Roveray's notice.' J P wishes not to make any offensive remarks but to be very plain &amp; candid; from whatever motive M r D — has relinquished his application to foreign engravers, whether the fear of 'trouble' or doubt of 'satisfaction in the event', J P does not feel the honour of substitution; &amp; if his other engagements would permit him to add to his connections he would not conscientiously derive advantage from the differences (which differences J P exceedingly regrets) between M r D &amp; those artists whose talents have enabled him to produce such beautiful works to the public. J P would be happy to see those mutual exertions renewed, &amp; then he would be glad (when his engagements might enable him) to exert himself in M r Du Roveray's publications[.] Spring Place Kentish Town March. 24. th 1803 29 This letter exhibits eloquently what his obituary in The Gentleman's Magazine ] described as "his equanimity of temper, his suavity of manners, and integrity". To this Du Roveray drafted a reply: Sir, I regret to find by your letter of yesterday's date that you are unwilling to exert your abilities in my behalf, until the differences which subsist between some of the associated engravers &amp; myself are made up. I know, for my part, of no diff. es which ought to exist, having given them all the explan. ns they could in reason require: further I do not choose to go; nor will I suffer myself to be dictated to, particularly after the insolent letters I have re'd from Messr A. Smith, Neagle, &amp; Bromley. I could assign Several reasons, for my having omitted the Engravers' names to my Prospectus, such as my having, at the time it went to press, made positive engag. ts with very few, as well as the little dependence which experience has taught me to place upon promises; but I do not think any one has a right to question my motives; nor can any one with propriety take an exception at that which is common to all — so much for the last ground of complaint ag. st me — I am sorry to add that M r Neagle has been guilty of ingratitude towards me, as well as insolence, as his letters in my possession will prove. P S. In speaking of the works I have pub. d , you seem to attribute the whole merit of the Plates to the artists in question, forgetting that the Painters are entitled to their full Share of the praise, and that without their successful exertions the finest engraving is of no avail: Such at least is my opinion; and I confess that I think good designs are the first &amp; most essential requisite. After all the finest Plates I have pub. d were not eng. d by the artists in question. They were the work of M. r Heath; who is able &amp; willing Still to employ his talent in embellishing my works. I can say the same of M r Sharp; whose superior abilities I believe no one will question[.] 25 March 1803 I should have no objection to leave the point or points at issue to the decision of M r Stothard, or any other impartial person[.] Five weeks later Parker responded: James Parker is glad to find M r Du Roveray is ready to disclaim any intention of reflecting on the Engravers engaged in his former works, he hopes on M r Du Roveray's account his application may be general &amp; that it may remedy as effectually as it would have prevented (if done at the first) those differences which have hindered their mutual exertions. J P can only say he would be glad to see those mutual exertions renewed, or if not &amp; the prevention was not on the side of M r Du Roveray — he would not object when his previous engagements might permit him to exert himself in M r Roveray's publications. Spring Place Kentish Town May 3. d 1803 And a year later he wrote again in a letter postmarked 15 June 1804: J Parker is exceeding sorry M r Du Roveray should call while he was not at home as he would have shewn him the Plate of Cecilia 30 but it will not be ready for the present which M r D will have in a few days[.] J P assures M r D that his plate is not hindered by other works being prefer[r]ed, on the contrary engagements entered into previous to his are not compleat, &amp; he has declined offers from several old &amp; respected connexions as he would wish to act uniformly[.] M r D will recollect that J P did not solicit &amp; that he only engaged for one under particular circumstances, that he might not appear to hinder that peace which M r D alludes to, &amp; which he has been desirous to effect between M r D &amp; his old friends &amp; not on his own account — J P mentioned one Year 31 &amp; he hopes to be so near to his time which shall not be intentionally lengthened — that on comparison M r D will not have reason to complain[.] Spring Place Kentish Town Friday Evening — JP thinks there must be some mistake in M r D. calling on him as he has never heard of it — About the same time, William Blake was appealing to Parker for his professional opinion. He wrote to Hayley on 22 June 1804 about the prices Hayley should expect to have to pay for engravings in his life of Romney: it is not only my opinion but that of M r Flaxman &amp; M r Parker both of whom I have consulted that to give a true Idea of Romneys Genius nothing less than Some Finishd Engravings will d o , as Outline intirely omits his chief beauties. . . . M r Parker whose Eminence as an Engraver makes his opinion deserve notice has advise d , that 4 should be done in the highly finished manner &amp; 4 in a less Finishd — &amp; on my desiring him to tell me for what he Would undertake to engrave One in Each manner the size to be about 7 Inches by 5 ¼ which is the size of a Quarto printed Pag e , he answere d : '30 guineas the finish d , &amp; half the sum for the less finishd: but as you tell me that they will be wanted in November I am of opinion that if Eight different Engravers are Employd the Eight Plates will not be done by that time; as for myself [Note Parker now speaks] I have to day turned away a Plate of 400 Guineas because I am too full of work to undertake it, &amp; I know that all the Good Engravers are so Engaged that they will be hardly prevaild upon to undertake more than One of the Plates on so short a notice.' . . . The Price M r Parker had affixd to each is Exactly what I myself had before concluded upon. . . . My Head of Romney is in very great forwardness. Parker commends it highly. And six months later, on 28 December 1804, Blake wrote again to Hayley about the price of his engraving of Romney's "The Shipwreck": I consulted M r Parker on the Subject before I decided on the Shipwreck &amp; it was his opinion &amp; he says it still is so that a Print of that Size cannot be done under 30 Guineas if finished. . . . Others too were praising Parker at the time. Bryan Froughton Jr wrote to F. J. Du Roveray on 19 March 1805 that in the print for Pope's Essay on Man in Du Roveray's edition of Pope's Poetical Works (1804), the engraver has copied too accurately the flimsy &amp; shadowy manner that Stothard so frequently deviates into — — I have also observed this defect even in so excellent an engraver as Parker whose abilities I have wished to have seen before employed in the decoration of your elegant editions, as well as Sharp, both of whom will (I understand from you) be employed in the Subjects from Homer [1805], these &amp; more, especially those from Fuseli will require such bold &amp; forceful stile as those artists, as well as Neagle, A. Smith &amp; Bromley so eminently possess — indeed I cannot doubt that my expectations of them, however sanguine they may be will be realized — 32 But Parker's engravings for Pope's Poetical Works were the last he ever engraved for Du Roveray, for "He died after a short illness, aged about forty-five [i.e., 55]". 33 According to the obituary of James Parker, in The Gentleman's Magazine , 75 (June 1805), 586, James Parker, "an eminent portrait and historical engraver", died on 20 May and was buried in St Clement Danes, and his fellow Governors of the Society of Engravers "attended him to the grave". One would like to think that his old fellow-apprentice and partner William Blake was also among those at the graveside. Both Parker and Blake had been notable collectors of prints, though Parker's were by contemporaries and Blake's were by 16th-Century masters. 34 About two years after Parker's death and presumably on behalf of his widow there was published A | CATALOGUE | OF A | Collection of PRINTS, | COMPRISING A NUMEROUS ASSEMBLAGE OF | Proofs &amp; Etchings , | AFTER WESTALL, SMIRKE, STODHART, and Others, | Several Ditto by Old Masters; | [Gothic:] Drawings, | by Morland, Town, &amp;c. | BOOKS, BOOKS of PRINTS , | AND SEVERAL CURIOUS MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES. | Together with a valuable Collection of | COINS AND MEDALS, | chiefly Silver, in a high State of Preservation, many of them | very rare and curious — late the Property of | Mr. JAMES PARKER, Engraver, | [Gothic:] Deceased; | Which will be Sold by Auction, | By Mr [Thomas] Dodd, | At his Spacious Room, | No . 101, St. Martin's Lane , | On WEDNESDAY, Feburary 18th, 1807, | AND FOLLOWING EVENING, | At Six o'Clock precisely . &lt;British Museum Department of Coins and Medals&gt; The 260 lots, described with wonderful vagueness, include: 157 Eighteen ditto [various prints ], by Blake, Tomkins, Ryland , &amp;c. 159 Six Circles, by Blake , in colours 35 162 Seventeen, by J. Parker, proofs and etchings 198 Thirty-five sculptural, by Parker, proofs 202 Thirty of book plates, after Stodhart, Westall, Smirke, &amp;c. by Parker, proofs 203 Thirty ditto, ditto, proofs and etchings 204 Thirty ditto 205 [ — 208] Ditto 209 Ditto to Boydell's Shakspeare and Bowyer's History of England, by Parker 210 Ditto, proofs and etchings 211 [ — 214] Ditto, ditto 215 Twenty ditto, fine 216 [ — 217] Ditto, ditto 218 Twenty-five ditto, choice copper plates 235 Eight, Edwin and Angelina, &amp;c. engraved by Parker 236 One, View of Claybrook Church, in aquatinta, by ditto , and the only print executed by him in this method. Probably no sale since that time has included so many engravings by Parker — or so many copies of the prints Blake had engraved for the firm of Parker &amp; Blake. It is possible to make some very rough comparisons between the careers of James Parker and William Blake as engravers. In terms of commercial engravings 36 finished in each year, the pattern is: Year Parker Blake unknown 9 -- 1780 1 3 1781 1 11 1782 1 19 1783 3 16 1784 1 8 1785 1 1 1786 3 1 1787 2 1 1788 1 5 1789 1 2 1790 -- -- 1791 -- 17 1792 6 9 Year Parker Blake 1793 7+ 5 1794 11 6 1795 8 * 6 1796 12 * + 25 ** 1797 7 * + 32 ** 1798 1 * -- 1799 4 * 4 * 1800 3 * 5 1801 3 * 1 1802 6 * + 18 1803 2 * 6 1804 3 * 5 1805 31 * + 8 TOTAL 136+ 224 In comparing these totals, however, one must remember in the first place that engravings by Blake have been assiduously sought since 1861, and most of his plates have probably already been discovered, whereas this, the first record of Parker's engravings, is certainly incomplete. And in the second place, Parker was probably on the average better remunerated than Blake for his engravings. For his octavo plates, Parker was often paid £8.8.0 or £10.10.0 (Hayley, Old Maids [1793], Armstrong, Preserving Health [1795], Green, The Spleen [1796], Somervile, The Chace [1796], and Collins, Poetical Works [1802]), which was probably about what Blake was paid for similar work, and we know that they were paid £5.5.0 for each plate they engraved in outline for Flaxman's Iliad (1805). However, Parker made a large number of folio plates (1795 — 1802) for Boydell's Shakspeare (1802) and Bowyer's Hume (1806) which were probably very well remunerated. James Heath was paid £420, or a hundred guineas each, for his four folio plates for Boydell's Shakspeare 37 (after Peters for Macbeth , III, i, after Smirke for Much Ado About Nothing , IV, ii, and after Northcote for Richard III , IV, iii, and Romeo and Juliet , V, iii), and Isaac Taylor was paid £500 for his atlas engraving after Stothard for Henry VIII . 38 Other engravers for Boydell and Bowyer were virtually certainly remunerated at similar rates. An engraver could earn enough from a single large line-engraving for Boydell or Bowyer or Macklin to live for a year and more. On the other hand, Blake made only one plate for the Shakspeare and none at all for Hume. Further, Blake's own great series of folio plates for Young's Night Thoughts (1797) were made chiefly for glory rather than for cash — we do not know what he was paid for his folio Night Thoughts engravings, but for his 537 folio Night Thoughts drawings he was paid only £21. 39 While Parker was being entrusted with more responsible and remunerative folio plates, Blake was largely restricted to plates of smaller dimensions and value — and in 1800 he moved to a country village far from the booksellers who had such commissions in their gift. For most of his commercial folio plates, those for the Night Thoughts , Blake was probably paid only a small fraction of what Parker was receiving for work of similar size. Of course, the differences between James Parker and William Blake are far more important than the similarities, and Blake had modest sources of income to which Parker had no access. Blake had a small but significant and steady income as a painter in water-colours, and he invented a method of Illuminated Printing in which all his published poetry appeared — though apparently no one else has ever used it — and from it he derived some income, though probably less than his time was worth as a professional engraver. And of course Blake was a genius as a painter and a poet. Not only that, but his greatest accomplishments in engraving, such as his Illustrations of The Book of Job (1826) and Dante, were far beyond anything James Parker achieved or attempted. Blake was a solitary visionary, who did not join with others, who did not vote, who went his own way, content with his visions and his genius. The only collaboration he attempted with another man, in the firm of Parker &amp; Blake, collapsed after only a few months. By contrast, James Parker worked very well in harness, he was a worthy and reliable member of his profession, and indeed he proved himself to be a leader in the organization of his fellow engravers. The two men were extraordinarily different — but clearly they were good friends. Today, the senior partner of the firm of Parker &amp; Blake is scarcely known, whereas the junior member is famous wherever English is spoken. The career of James Parker demonstrates what that of William Blake might have been like had he been a steady, reliable workman like Parker — and had he not been a genius.</field>

Sweeting's Alley, Royal-Exchange; and by the Engraver James Parker, No. 27, Broad Street, Golden Square; at which Places an etched proof may be seen". 46 According to Dodd, this plate (he calls it "The Revolution of 1688") and Northcote's "The Landing of the Prince of Orange at Torbay", published in 1790, were among Parker's most distinguished line-engravings. They would have been especially appropriate for the celebrations of the centenary of the Glorious Revolution in 1788.

His earliest productions are in the stippled method and consist of some few portraits [i.e., 6] of the Series of illustrations of Shakespeare, published by Mess rs E. &amp; G. Harding about the year 1791; he rose to become eminent in the history of engraving". 48 According to DNB, Parker engraved "some portraits for Harding's 'Shakespeare Illustrated'", but I did not notice them in the copies I saw. The work was issued in parts, probably in 1790 — 93. The plates were printed on paper of various sizes, and after 700 copies had been printed the plates were destroyed (according to James Edwards' Catalogues of 1794 and 1796, #290). Thomson, James.

Cromek: "I have a copy of the book [Thomson, The Seasons (n.d. given)], and a set of the prints: they have my father's name as the engraver; but M. r Frost, however, has a set of proofs with the name of Parker . Which of the two really did engrave them, I cannot decide. As far as external evidence goes, they might be the work of either of them". 49 The Seasons (London: R. Baldwin, &amp;c., 1803) &lt;GEB&gt; does indeed have plates after Corbould by Cromek which are identical in design to those engraved by Parker in 1793. I compared them minutely and found them disconcertingly similar except that (1) in all the imprint beneath the design is entirely different, (2) in 1803 the head with floral swags above the oval design is gone, and (3) the hatching of the surround between the oval design and the rectangular frame is quite different. In the comparisons below, I only examined the prints far enough to persuade myself that they are different plates , though the principal figures are astonishingly similar: 1 "Spring": numerous small details of foliage, e.g., on the river-bank and by the man's left elbow are significantly different; in 1793 the man's sleeves are cross-hatched, but in 1803 they are not; 2 "Summer": The right shoe is cross hatched in 1793 but not in 1803; ankle lines different; 3 "Autumn": Foliage and bottom left tree are different; 4 "Winter": Spinning wheel has horizontal bands in 1793, vertical ones in 1803. 1794 THE BOOK OF | COMMON PRAYER, | and administration of | THE SACRAMENTS, | AND | OTHER RITES AND CEREMONIES | OF | [Gothic:] The Church, | ACCORDING TO THE USE OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND: | together with the | PSALTER or PSALMS | OF | DAVID, | POINTED AS THEY ARE TO BE SUNG OR SAID IN CHURCHES . | — — | LONDON: | Printed by Millar Ritchies, | FOR | J.

G. E. Bentley, Jr. (1978), 1027 (I have added punctuation); this work is the source of all Blake quotations here. 3 F.

Dictionnaire des Graveurs anciens et modernes, Depuis l'origine de la Gravure (1809), I, 70, report: "PARKER, (J.) à gravé à Londres, à la manière pointillé divers sujets d'après différens maitres anglois, de formes rondes, &amp;c." The account of Blake is strikingly similar: "BLAKE, (W.), a gravé à Londres en 1784 &amp;c, divers sujets à la manière pointillée, d'après différens artistes Anglais". 4 The Protestant's Family Bible (1780 — 81), Seally &amp; Lyons, Geographical Dictionary (1784), The Dramatic Works of Shakespeare (1802), The Iliad of Homer Engraved from the Compositions of Iohn Flaxman (1805), and Rees, Cyclopaedia (see 1804 below). 5 According to Memoirs and Recollections of the Late of Abraham Raimbach, Esq., Engraver , ed. M. T. S. Raimbach (London: Not Published, 1843), 36 fn: "James Parker, a fellow pupil of the insane genius Blake, at Basire's — not very distinguished as an artist, but greatly respected for his amiable disposition, integrity, and good sense. He died after a short illness, aged about forty-five". This source is subsequently cited as Memoirs of Raimbach . 6 John Flaxman wrote to William Hayley on 7 November 1804 recommending engravers: "there is another Engraver of distinguished merit who is a punctual honest Man M. r Parker a fellow Student of Blake, by whom You have a beautiful small print of David playing on the harp before Saul . . .". Quoted from the MS in the Pierpont Morgan Library; for more of the letter, see G. E. Bentley, Jr, Blake Records (1969), 155. 7 Copy of the summary of the original indenture in Stationer's Hall. 8 Blake Records, 9 — 10; Blake Records is the source for all the facts about Blake given here. 9 British Museum Print Room NN.6.18. Another version of the incident identifies the third figure not as Parkes (or Parker) but as Ogleby ( Blake Records , 19). "Ogleby [i.e., Parker] declared that once being taken prisoner was enough for him; he would go out no more on such perilous expeditions". 10 Northcote too may have favored Parker, for Parker engraved important plates after Northcote in 1785, 1786, 1787 (3), 1789, and 1801 (2). 11 The Allegation itself is in Lambeth Palace Library; a transcript is at 1, The Sanctuary, Westminster. 12 J. T. Smith, Nollekens and his Times (1828), quoted in Blake Records , 457. J. T. Smith was a friend both of Blake and of the Mathews' son William Henry and is likely to have had good information. 13 Westminster Archives Centre, 10 St Anne's Street, London SW1P 2XR. In 1785 "James Parker &amp; W m Blake [on a rent of £]18 [paid the Golden Square Watch Rate of £] — 7 6" (D.808) and the Paving Rate of 16 s 8 d (D.1213). 14 Westminster Public Library: D.106. 15 In the Great Marlboro Watch Rate for 28 Poland Street is the notation "W. m Blake Christ[mas] 1785 Empty [first] 2 quarters" (D.849). In 1786 "&amp; Blake" is deleted and "W. m Blake" is inserted at the sixth house in Poland Street East (D.107). Through the inertia of the rate-collectors, "Blake &amp; Parker" continued to be entered as joint tenants for the Paving and Watch Rates in 1786 (D.1214; D.810 — 811) and 1787 (D.1215 ["Blake" is deleted]; D.812 — 813). 16 Allan Cunningham, Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1830), quoted in Blake Records , 482. Cunningham's account of Blake is plausible but not reliable in detail. 17 See Robert N. Essick, The Separate Plates of William Blake: A Catalogue (1983), 139 — 144. 18 Paving Rates for 1788 — 94 (D.109 — 115); in 1795 (D.116) Parker is replaced by Mayhew Jr. The details from the rate books were first recorded by Paul Miner, "William Blake's London Residences", Bulletin of the New York Public Library , 62 (1958), 535 — 550. 19 Westminster Poll Book for 1788. The next entry is for "William Blake St Anns Parish", but no vote is recorded; apparently Blake had simply come in to keep Parker company. 20 The Westminster Poll Books were examined in Middlesex County Record Office, Queen Anne's Gate Buildings, Dartmouth Street, Westminster S.W.1. 21 MS in the Fitzwilliam Museum. 22 All Parker's plates for the Boydell Shakspeare are reproduced in Blake: An Illustrated Quarterly , 25 (1991). 23 The "immense prices" derive from Anon., "Monthly Retrospect of the Fine Arts", Monthly Magazine , 11 (1 Feb, 1 March, 1 April 1801), 63 — 64, 155, 246. The plates for "Cymbeline" and "The Merry Wives of Windsor" were part of a series of seven "Circle Prints from Shakespeare" after Harding and Stothard (12” in diameter) which sold for 7 s 6 d and 15 s . 24 Blake had, however, engraved a number of small plates for Macklin in the 1780s for fees similar to those of Parker ( Blake Records , 569). 25 In the Rosenwald Collection of the Library of Congress; with it is the manuscript of the fourth Ballad, "The Dog", presumably added by another hand. 26 Memoirs of Raimbach , 37. According to the obituary in The Gentleman's Magazine , 75 (June 1805), 586, James Parker contributed much by his zeal to the formation of the Society of Engravers. 27 It was offered in the Sotheby sale [of Robert Balmanno] 4 — 12 May 1830, Lot 692. 28 John Pye, Patronage of British Art (1845), 313 fn. 29 Quoted, like the other Du Roveray letters here, from the MS in the Free Public Library of Philadelphia; for the context, see G.

      <field name="heading_text">(De)Composing Frankenstein : The Import of Altered Character Names in the Last Draft by David Ketterer</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The extant portions of the Last Draft and the later Fair Copy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein are among the collection of Shelley and Godwin materials that Lord Abinger, their inheritor, deposited in the Bodleian Library in 1974 and 1976. 1 Since then various partial accounts of the Frankenstein manuscripts have been published, the most detailed and even-handed being "Shelley's Contribution to Mary's Frankenstein " by E. B. Murray. However, as Murray himself states in an initial footnote, he does not deal with all of those manuscripts: "I do not use manuscript materials I have seen only in microfilm . . ." (50 n1). The Last Draft reveals that Frankenstein , at the time of the Last Draft's creation, was conceived as two separately paginated volumes (as distinct from the three-volume Fair Copy, of which only concluding parts of the separately paginated Volume Three survive, and the original edition derived from it, issued as three separate volumes by Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor and Jones in 1818). Murray does not report on the first of those Last Draft volumes. Furthermore, Murray appears to mistake the Last Draft — much of which clearly involved rough copying of material previously composed in rough draft form — for the original rough draft. Like Murray, virtually all commentators on the Frankenstein manuscripts (notably, James Rieger, in his edition of the 1818 text, and Anne K. Mellor) have focused on the most sensational issue the material gives rise to: how substantial, how improving, how damaging was Percy Shelley's contribution to Mary's work? The Last Draft includes numerous corrections and additions, and some suggestions in Percy's hand, while the final thirteen pages of the last Fair Copy fragment, which are entirely in Percy's hand, contain significant revisions of the corresponding Last Draft section that Murray assumes (I believe correctly) originated with him. The manuscript evidence in fact indicates that Percy contributed some 4,095 words, around 6% of the wordage of the 1818 edition — rather more than E. B. Murray's 2,200 estimate (50, 50 n1). Commentators have become so fixated on ascertaining the nature of Percy's input that virtually everything else that the Frankenstein manuscripts have to tell us has been ignored. It is my intention, then, in turning to that "everything else" to submit to particular analysis two of the seven instances in the Last Draft of altered or superseded character names and, taking into account relevant information in Mary's journal and one letter, elucidate what these changes suggest about the novel's order of composition/revision and the interpretative implications of that order.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I It is necessary at the outset to provide, for the first time, a comprehensive description of exactly what the Frankenstein manuscripts consist of. It is rather surprising, given the two decades that they have been in the Bodleian, that nobody has put that basic information into print. The Bodleian designated the 1974 deposit Dep. c. 477/1, and the 1976 deposit Dep. c. 534/1 and Dep. c. 534/2. Dep. c. 477/1 and Dep. c. 534/1 are respectively Mary's Volume I and Volume II of the Last Draft. However those conceptual two volumes do not coincide with the two notebooks (one which contained light blue Continental paper, the other larger off-white British) in which the surviving draft was mainly written. Both notebooks were apparently intact at the time of writing and the leaves subsequently detached; the covers of both notebooks are now lost. The pagination of conceptual Volume II commences in the midst of the notebook that contained Continental paper. After the 77 surviving Continental leaves (60 Volume I leaves followed by 17 Volume II leaves), Volume II continues on the surviving 75 larger British leaves. Except for two rogue leaves described below, the Fair Copy fragments (Dep. c. 534/2) are written on leaves of British paper (bound at the time of writing with covers that are now lost) from what seem to have been two identical notebooks of a third type. They were probably modest exercise-type notebooks. 2 In describing the manuscripts below, for ease of later reference, I have distinguished eight "natural" parts and identified them as A, A1, B, C r , and D for the Last Draft; and, in the case of the Fair Copy fragments, DM, DP, and DPM. In relating these parts, and all manuscript quotations, to the 1818 text, I refer to page and line numbers in James Rieger's extremely useful line-numbered 1974 edition of that text (e.g., Rieger 103.5). In quotations from the manuscripts, carets are used to indicate an above-the-line insert. The Last Draft — Volume I A: The 121 pages (61 leaves) Mary numbered 41 to 161 (accidentally skipping 52, numbering two pages 58, and concluding with a blank page 161) (Rieger 30.13 ["servants had any request to make"] — 97.16 ["he thus began his tale."]). Assuming that all but the last leaf of the first two quires are lost, these surviving 61 leaves originally constituted the last leaf of quire II through to leaf eight (now apparently the sixth leaf since leaves two and three are missing) of the originally ten-leaved quire VIII (only quires V and VII contained twelve leaves) of a bound notebook of Continental paper. As usual Mary writes on both sides of each leaf. The light blue leaves (18.6 X 27 cm) of parts A and B, and probably C r , all derive from the same notebook; its leaves were separated at some point after their being written on. The leaves originated as a quarto sheet; consequently the two watermarks — "D | ADIVONNE" and a bell — are split across the reconstructed folds. On each page a left hand margin of varying widths has been created by a pencilled line. A number of Percy's inserts and suggestions appear in these margins (as they do in the ruled and unruled margins of parts B — D). Taking account of the deducible pages 1 — 40, this part is sectioned by Mary into 15 chapters (with two chapter 7's). 3 Bruce C. Barker-Benfield's reconstruction of the notebook quires indicates that leaves two and three of quire VIII (four pages before leaf 153 [3 altered from 7]/154) are missing because they were cancelled at the time of writing (Barker-Benfield 4 — 5). Following nine cancelled lines at the top of page 153 [3 altered from 7], a revision of the four and a bit cancelled pages (corresponding to Rieger 93.21 ["it rose"] — 97.16) continues through to the top of page 160 (approximately seven manuscript pages which deal with Frankenstein's meeting with the monster prior to the monster's central narrative). A1: Insert material that appears on six unnumbered (by Mary) off-white pages larger than the Part A pages. Inserted at points on pages 43 and 44 of Part A above, it corresponds to Rieger 32.15 ("Natural philosophy is the genius") — 35.2 ("their place in my mind.") and to Rieger 35.17 ("I eagerly inquired") — 36.19 ("this various literature."). (Some of the first insert and all of the second were deleted in the revised 1831 edition.) A Bodleian librarian, the late Margaret Crum, in foliating in pencil all but one of the Volume I manuscript leaves (the accidental exception is Mary's pages 91 — 92), numbered these insert leaves 1, 2, 3, and 3 v and then foliated Mary's Part A leaves (minus blank page 161) as 4 — 62, thereby giving the accidental impression that the insert material was written before the beginning of Part A. Part A1 must in fact have been written at some point while Part A was being written, or at some later stage of the drafting/revision process. 4 Part A1 consists of a folded sheet, a bifolium (with a rectangular portion torn from the bottom of the second leaf some time before Mary wrote on it), followed by a single leaf of the same folio paper. All but the torn second leaf measure 20.2 x 31.6 cm. The centered watermark "T W &amp; B | BOTFIELD" is visible on the leaves foliated 1 and 3. A centered crowned oval Britannia watermark incorporating the date "1815" is visible on the torn attached leaf 2. All the watermarks are upside down relative to Mary's script. Most probably these leaves of British paper were detached from the same folio notebook before being written on. There are no margins; Mary writes flush to the left and right hand edges of the page, on both sides of the leaves. This insert material is headed "Chapt. 2". It seems likely, therefore (see note 3 above), that a Chapter 1 portion of the missing forty pre-Part A pages corresponded to, or stood in place of, the frame narrator Walton's four prefatory letters and that Chapter 2 here corresponds to Chapter I (Volume One) of the 1818 edition. The Last Draft — Volume II B: The pages beginning on a verso headed "Vol. II" and paginated by Mary 1 ("161" — a continuation of the Volume I, or Part A, pagination sequence — appears on the blank recto) — 21 (corresponding to Rieger 97.17 — 109.8); they comprise manuscript chapters 1 and 2, and part of Chapter 3. 5 Most pages have pencil-ruled margins. The eleven leaves involved are of the same light-blue type as Part A and were originally part of the same quarto Continental notebook. They once constituted leaves 8 — 10 of quire VIII and the first eight leaves of quire IX (the remaining four are lost). C r : After a significant gap, a disjointed sequence (containing part of a deleted first and then a completed second rewrite of the now lost original Part [C]) of the same light-blue pages (most probably from the same Continental paper notebook as parts A and B) continues in an order that can be construed from the textual continuities and from matching leaves now separated. First are two separated bifolia consisting of: a recto numbered 57 (a cancelled marginless page, here distinguished from a second recto numbered 57 as 57 A ), its marginless unnumbered verso (with the order of continuation number "59" about one-fifth down); a recto numbered 60 (a marginless page with the right hand bottom corner torn off before use), its verso numbered 61 (marginless with the corresponding left hand bottom corner torn off); a recto numbered 62 (marginless), its blank verso page; and a blank recto (with its right hand lower corner torn off before use), its verso numbered 63 (with an unruled margin and the corresponding left hand lower corner torn off). Bruce Barker-Benfield accounts for the two blanks by surmising "that MWS had accidentally turned over two leaves of the bound notebook" (9). Since the text is continuous between pages 61 and 62, these four leaves must at some point have formed the two central bifolia of their quire. Part C r continues with a bifolium which almost certainly, at some previous point, was the central bifolium of the same quire (it must have been detached for rewrite purposes before the continuous text of pages 61 and 62 was written). It was intact at the time of writing since penstrokes carry across the matched join. In essence, the first passage on what was this central bifolium replaces and continues the cancelled material on page 57 A above and at the top of its unpaginated verso, while a second passage on the same bifolium continues from page 63 above. The once central bifolium consists of: a recto numbered 57 (57 B , with an unruled margin and headed, by Percy, "another Chapter"), its verso numbered 58 (with an unruled margin); and a recto numbered 59 (with an unruled margin and text about one-third down the page identified by the continuation number "64"), its unnumbered verso lacking a margin and including text about one-fifth down the page identified by continuation number "65". The "65" material concludes (presumably because the two pages accidentally left blank had not been noticed, and because there was no more Continental paper) on a fragment of off-white, probably British paper (approximately one quarter the height of the white leaves of Part A1). 6 The gap between 21, the last page of Part B, and 57, the first page of Part C r , suggests, if the draft was paginated continuously , that 36 pages numbered 22 — 57 are lost. But only slightly more than eight pages account for the interval between the Rieger 1818 edition equivalent of the end of Mary's page 21 — (the appropriate) "how was that possible" (Rieger 109.8) — and the 1818 equivalent of the beginning of her page 57 — "Some time elapsed" (Rieger 117.17, the beginning of Chapter VI of Volume Two). It is not, however, an inevitable deduction that a substantial amount of text in the draft was cut; it is possible (indeed likely) that the first page number of C r was made to coincide with a lost page of pre-Part D material and does not continue the 1 — 21 sequence of Part B. Since Part B ends five draft pages into Mary's Chapter 3, the missing pages (of greater or lesser extent) and the following extant pages would seem to have accounted for the remainder of Mary's Chapter 3 and a "Chapter 4", which, after what can be assumed to have been, perhaps on different occasions, deletions and rewriting, presumably corresponded to the 1818 Volume Two chapters V and VI. As will appear, the establishment of this Chapter 4 is important. After the rewrite stage that survives as C r , it was divided into two chapters (presumably 4 and 5) presumably in line with Percy's direction at the top of page 57 B , "another Chapter". His placement of this direction for the beginning of what presumably became Mary's "Chapter 5" corresponds to the beginning of the 1818 Chapter VI. That undesignated "Chapter 5," the rewritten second half of a long "Chapter 4," is all that now survives of "Chapter 4." I apologise to the perhaps wearied reader for what might seem a very finicky account of this central Part C r , but it clearly relates to a portion of the manuscript that presented major problems and involved considerable revision. Under scrutiny, C r provides the best clues as to the course of Frankenstein 's redrafting and to an area of creative trauma. D: The remainder of the Last Draft consists of seventy-five off-white folio leaves of British paper measuring 19.9 — 20.2 x 31 cm; they are, then, larger than the light blue leaves of parts A, B, and C r , and very slightly smaller than the off-white leaves of A1. These leaves derive from five successive sixteen-leaf quires (originally in a bound notebook) of which only the second and third are complete (leaves 1 and 2 are missing from the first, leaf 16 from the fourth, and leaves 12 — 16 from the fifth). Three leaves cannibalized from elsewhere in the same notebook (and a scrap of different paper) have been inserted in quire II after its eighth leaf. The watermarked date "1806" below the initials "JL" is visible (upside down relative to the writing) at the center of 39 leaves, and a Britannia in crowned triple oval is visible (also upside down) at the center of 36 other leaves. 7 There are unruled margins throughout. (The columns of mathematical calculations in the margin of the first page appear to be basically two pagination totals.) The pages are numbered a hard-to-make-out 62 ( possibly changed to 66 — the "2" is blotted in a way that makes it look like a "6", or like it may have been altered to a "6" to follow on from the Part C r continuation numbers "64" and "65"; at any rate, the next page is 63) to 203 (Rieger 122.28 — 221.12 to the end). After two cancelled lines, the first page of Part D, page 62, opens at the equivalent of the start of the 1818 Chapter VII (Volume Two). There is no chapter designation on page 62. Chapter headings appear for chapters 7 — 18 which are paginated 70 — 203. 8 Presumably the opening pages 62 — 69 constitute the concluding portion of "Chapter 6." The opening portion of that "Chapter 6" is now lost. The also-now-lost Part [C] (as distinguished from C r ) seems to have constituted the end of a "Chapter 4." In other words, there is reason to suspect that the pagination and the chapter numbering of Part D was not the result of a continuous sequence initiated by Part B. Barker-Benfield's reconstruction of the notebook quires indicates, as noted above, that three leaves were inserted after leaf 101 A /102 A (there is a second leaf numbered 101 and 102) and that one leaf (presumably two cancelled pages) is missing after leaf 181/182 which concludes with cancelled text (the following page number 183 appears to have been altered from 185). This evidence points to fourth and fifth significant areas of revision (additional to A1, the last two thirds of Volume I Chapter 14, and Volume II "Chapter 4") commencing at Rieger 149.5 ("But it is this gloom") and at Rieger 206.9 ("You took me on board"). The Fair Copy Fragments My concern in this article is only incidentally with the Fair Copy (see foot-note 23 below) but for the sake of completeness a description of the Fair Copy fragments (which transcribe the latter portion of Part D above) follows. Unlike the very sketchy picture that we have regarding exactly when Mary began writing the Last Draft and when she finished, and in what order, the dates between which she (and Percy) transcribed the Fair Copy are recorded in her journal as 18 April — 13 May 1817 (I:168 — 169). Except for two rogue leaves, the eight Fair Copy fragments are written on twenty-nine small quarto leaves, the smallest of all the manuscript leaves (18.6 x 22.4 cm). These small leaves were created by tearing or cutting bifolia in half (after their being written on since, in Barker-Benfield's words, "the writing on many leaves is torn or cut through" [16]). The two watermarks are each split across the reconstructed folds. The top half of a posthorn in crowned shield (a common watermark) is visible on six of these leaves and the bottom half with the appended monogrammed letters "P &amp; S" on twelve others (all are the remains of a single-quire notebook of 24 leaves). The remains of a second single-quire notebook of 24 leaves consist of four leaves on which the watermark "PHIPPS &amp; SON" is visible (which explains the "P &amp; S") and seven others on which the balance of the same watermark is visible — the date "1809." The last leaf in Percy's Part DP bears the watermarked date "1814" set sideways at the inside edge jaggedly hacked just beyond the original fold; it derives from a third notebook, slightly smaller than the other two. 9 A second rogue leaf (see Part DPM below) derives from a fourth notebook. All the Fair Copy paper is British and cream-colored. The Fair Copy fragments — their page numbers, beginning with 99, centered at the top of each page (instead of in the right and left hand corners as in most of the Last Draft) — correspond to the following three parts depending on who was transcribing: DM: a forty-six-and-a-quarter page sequence in Mary's hand — 99 — 175 (Rieger 185.24 ["satisfied that nothing"] — 215.20 ["misled by passion."]) — with five gaps of two or more pages. 10 Chapters are numbered as they are in Volume Three of the 1818 edition. The missing pages, 1 — 98, clearly corresponded to Chapter I through to the opening pages of Chapter V of that volume. Thus, unlike the two-volume Last Draft, the Fair Copy was conceived and written as three volumes for the projected three-volume 1818 edition. (The singlequired second notebook begins at leaf 139/140.) DP: Twelve and three-quarter pages in Percy's hand — paginated (in Mary's hand, like DM and DMP) 175 — 187 (Rieger 215.21 ["That he should"] — 221.12 ["darkness and distance."]). DPM: A 185 B /186 B leaf in Mary's hand (there is a 185 A /186 A leaf in DP above) which reproduces, with a few minor variations the material that appears on Percy's 183 — 185 A pages (Rieger 219.18 ["whilst I destroyed"] — 220.8 ["to perform this"]). As my "DPM" letter identification (copy of Part D/Percy/Mary) indicates, I follow Murray (66 — 67) in hypothesizing that this duplicate fragment exists because Mary felt obliged to recopy for the compositor, perhaps with reference to the Last Draft, at least those of Percy's pages (which actually extend from 181 — 186 A ) where the scissored edge cuts off the ends (on the rectos) or the beginnings (on the versos) of some of the transcribed words. 11 This leaf was torn from a quarto notebook which was very slightly taller and wider than the two single-quire notebooks (based on what can be assumed from their surviving leaves). The top half of a posthorn in crowned shield watermark is visible set sideways at the torn edge. It is apparent from the description above that, for a general sense of the rather complicated organizational relationships between the Last Draft and the 1818 edition, divisions created by physical factors (types of paper and a significant gap created by missing leaves) must be correlated with conceptual divisions in those versions. As a visual aid, the following chart relates those features including the framing divisions established by the narrators (W[alton], F[rankenstein], and the M[onster]). My parts A — D factor in both the physical paper divisions and the conceptual Last Draft volumes. Parts A, B, and C r apply to the Continental paper (ignoring here the Part A1 insert on British paper); Part D corresponds to the British paper. Parts A and A1 apply to Volume 1 and parts B, C r , and D to Volume II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Before proceeding further, it is necessary to relate an analysis of the Frankenstein Last Draft to the scanty information provided by Mary's journal entries and one letter — and to the quite divergent reconstructions of the composition process based on those documentary sources — in order to determine (1) whether the process of "composition" (which should be variously understood in relation to the Last Draft as including transcription, new composition, re-drafting, and revision) corresponded to the order of the published story, and (2) approximately what portions of the story were written when. I begin with a review of the documentary evidence. Unfortunately, Mary's journal for the period 14 May — 20 July 1816, in the latter half of which period Frankenstein was begun, is missing. The anonymous Preface to the 1818 edition (written, according to Mary's 1831 Introduction, by Percy from his wife's point of view) simply refers to the now familiar ghost-story compact (proposed by Byron according to Mary's more expansive Introduction to the 1831 edition) as occurring during "the summer of 1816 in the environs of Geneva" (Rieger 7). From information provided by Thomas Moore, Byron's biographer (confirmed by related entries in John Polidori's diary), it is clear that the compact must have been initiated at Byron's residence, the Villa Diodati (Moore 2: 31). Since Byron did not move into the Villa Diodati until 10 June 1816, and since his contribution, an unfinished vampire story, is dated 17 June 1816, the compact must have been proposed between those two dates. 16 June would appear to be the most likely date. In her 1831 Introduction Mary records that for several days she was unable to think of a story until, the night following a discussion about "the nature of the principle of life" (Rieger 227), she experienced the waking dream that inspired her: "On the morrow I announced that I had thought of a story . I began that day with the words, It was on a dreary night of November , making only a transcript of the grim terrors of my waking dream" (Rieger 228). 12 Since Percy Shelley and Byron left for a week's tour of Lac Léman on 22 June, Mary must have begun her story on that day at the latest — more probably a day or two earlier — in order to make her announcement. 13 The words she began with open Chapter IV of Book One of the 1818 edition. In the 1831 Introduction, Mary writes, "At first I thought but of a few pages — of a short tale; but Shelley urged me to develop the idea at greater length" (Rieger 228 — 229). It seems reasonable to suppose that Percy made this suggestion around 22 June before he left for the tour of Lac Léman, or (less likely) shortly after returning on 30 June. Subsequently, at least the first line and probably other portions of the first composition stage of Frankenstein (the "transcript") were incorporated into a preliminary draft or preliminary drafts and eventually into the surviving Last Draft. Although the Last Draft might seem to constitute a second composition stage, it actually constitutes a third (one which incorporates the first and second stages). In the surviving journal, which begins on 21 July 1816 (when Percy and Mary and her stepsister Claire Claremont set off for a week's tour of Chamonix, a location which figures importantly in the novel), the first reference to Frankenstein appears (during the tour) in the entry for 24 July: "I read nouvelle nouvelles [ Nouveaux contes moraux et nouvelles historiques (1802), by Madame de Genlis] and write my story . . ." (I: 118). Subsequent references to her writing (most probably Frankenstein ) in Switzerland appear in entries for 29 July; 1, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16 — 22 (on the 21st she adds, "Shelley &amp; I talk about my story" [I: 130]), 24, and 25 August 1816. Further references to her writing when back in England occur in entries for 16 and 18 September; 7, 17 — 27 (the last entry specifying, "Write Ch. 2 ½" [of the Last Draft Volume I or Volume II?] [I: 142]), and 28 October; 2 — 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15 — 18, 20 ("Draw and write (137)" [Mary's parenthetical number; I: 146] — presumably "137" refers to page 137 of the Last Draft but is it page 137 of Volume I or of Volume II?), 21 — 30 November; 1 — 11, and 13 December 1816; and 3 — 8, and 10 January 1817. A synoptic entry following 23 February 1817 and written, at the very latest, on 9 April 1817, includes this information: "the following week we enter our house [March 18] — Write every day" (I: 166). Presumably this means she wrote every day after moving into Albion House in Marlow and before her father William Godwin's visit on 2 April. The more than two month period after 10 January and before 19 March 1817 where no mention is made of any writing strongly suggests that the Last Draft had reached at least a first stage of completion by 10 January 1817. Since the entry for 10 April 1817 begins "Correct F." (I: 166) — the first of several such — it may be concluded that, after various second and third thoughts, perhaps prompted by Percy and other readers of her manuscript, Mary had certainly finished the Last Draft of Frankenstein before that date; most probably it was completed by 1 April, the day before Godwin's visit. Two of the entries that I have parenthetically speculated about above call for further comment. The 27 October 1816 entry regarding "Ch. 2 ½" is followed on 28, 29, and 30 October, and on 2 and 4 November by references to Mary's reading Sir Humphry Davy's "Chemistry" (I: 142 — 144) — whether his Elements of Chemical Philosophy (1812) or his Discourse, Introductory to A Course of Lectures on Chemistry (1802; see Laura E. Crouch's argument for the latter), or both. If, as seems likely, this reading was undertaken to help with her writing at the time, the "Ch. 2 ½" reference must be to Volume I of the Last Draft. Most immediately, "Ch. 2 ½" might be identified as either the insert material headed "Chapt. 2" (Part A1) that deals with the contest between ancient "science" (as represented by Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus) and the modern science of chemistry, or, as might seem more likely, all of an original Chapter 2 (i.e., "3," altered from "2" [p. 47]) plus half of the next chapter, a chapter, originally undesignated, which later became Last Draft Chapter 4. Like Part A1, Chapter 4 (the last half of Chapter II of Volume One in the 1818 edition) deals with the contest between alchemy and chemistry (as it arises from Frankenstein's contact with professors Krempe and Waldman) (pp. 55 — 59; Rieger 40.19 — 43.30). Chapter number "2" in the Last Draft is altered to "3" in what appears to be the same revision ink — the revision ink in which other changes on the same pages are made — as the designation "Chap. 4" (p. 55). In pursuit of further insight into "Ch. 2 ½" as transcribed in the 1987 edition of Mary's journals, I examined the journal itself (Bodleian Dep. d. 211 [2]) and the actual reference. What Mary actually wrote was "Write Ch. 2 [ altered from 3]½" (noted under "Words Obscuring Recovered Matter," Journals II: 700). The alteration is visible to the naked eye and beyond all doubt when examined under a magnifying glass. In spite of the fact that the "2" of Chapter 2 was altered to a "3" (Vol. I, p. 47) and that in the journal the reverse amendment apparently took place, the fact that the same numbers are involved makes it a well-nigh certainty that the confused "Ch. 2 [ altered from 3]½" refers to "Chapter 3 [ altered from 2]" plus its originally non-chapter-designated continuation. What became "Chap. 4" in the Last Draft is the half chapter. "Ch. 3 [ altered from 2]½" could, of course, reasonably be understood as referring only to the half chapter following Chapter 2, in which case it denotes only what became "Chap. 4." The common content strongly suggests that the Part A1 insert material was written with "Chap. 4" in mind and possibly shortly after "Chap. 4." If a chapter and a half, or even just the half chapter, comprising early pages of the Continental paper, were/was written/transcribed in just one day, it is likely that the preceding one or two chapters was/were written/transcribed during the two or three days immediately preceding 27 October 1816. If what appears to be a page number in the entry for 20 November 1816 does indeed apply to a page of the Last Draft, it could refer to Part A page 137 of Volume I (corresponding to Rieger 84.16 ["may this be"] — 84.28]) or Part D page 137 of Volume II (corresponding to Rieger 174.14 ["neck, and screamed"] — 175.3 ["characterize that"]). The first page 137 marks the end of Chapter 11, Volume I of the Last Draft (and the end of Volume One of the 1818 edition) — it deals with Frankenstein's fiancée, Elizabeth, reconciling herself to the servant Justine's unjust execution. The second page 137, which is part of the account of Frankenstein's imprisonment in Ireland for murder, occurs several pages into Chapter 14, Volume II of the Last Draft (Chapter IV, Volume Two of the 1818 edition). Combined with the evidence regarding the placement of "Ch. 3 [ altered from 2]½," it would seem most likely that the climactic Volume I page 137 is being referred to (making that page and the "Ch. 3 [ altered from 2]½" pages the only passages from Frankenstein that can be dated with precision). The sad death of Justine might well have reminded Mary of the sad suicide of her half-sister Fanny Imlay on the ninth day of the month before she made the journal entry including the number "137." 14 It would seem logical to deduce, then, that between 27 October and 20 November 1816, and most probably for a couple of days before and rather more after these dates, Mary was working on Volume I of the Last Draft, that back in England Mary was transcribing/revising/composing on the Continental paper (whether that paper was acquired in England or, as is much more likely, in Switzerland), and that she had not transcribed, etc., any part of Volume II of the Last Draft before those dates — specifically during the early period back in England (say 16 September — 24 October 1816) — into a British notebook acquired shortly after her arrival in Bath. With regard to the last, however, one should allow for the seemingly less likely hypothesis, that in late October and throughout November she turned to Volume I after having written a substantial portion of Last Draft Volume II. As I have indicated, 5 December 1816 was one of the days that Mary records doing some writing. A letter of the same day from Mary in Bath to Percy in Marlow contains what, as will become increasingly clear in the context of my reconstruction, is undoubtedly the most illuminating specific documentary reference to the writing of Frankenstein . It begins: Sweet Elf I was awakened this morning by my pretty babe and was dressed time enough to take my lesson from M r West 15 and (Thank God) finished that tedious ugly picture I have been so long about — I have also finished the 4 Chap. of Frankenstein which is a very long one &amp; I think you would like it. ( Letters I: 22) One should note here the phrase "the 4 Chap." instead of simply "Chap. 4." The article may imply that Percy would have aware of the material that she was referring to, perhaps because she had drafted an earlier version of it and that version was not satisfactory. Mary's stressing the length of this new chapter is probably related to Percy's now faint and hard to read pencilled marginal comment on the preceding Chapter 2: "This chapter is too short" (Vol. II, p. 11). In quoting the Chapter 4 reference in a note to Mary's 5 December 1816 journal entry, the normally perspicacious editors Paula R. Feldman and Diana Scott-Kilvert make an extraordinary mistake. They provide this clarification: "In chapter iv Frankenstein succeeds in discovering the cause of generation and life" (I: 148 n5). Ray Hammond in The Modern Frankenstein makes the same mistake regarding the same chapter allusion: "The fourth chapter of Mary's novel is the crucial scene-setting for Victor Frankenstein's creation. It is in this chapter that he describes his long work of raiding graves, visiting charnel houses and abattoirs to collect the materials for the creature he is to make" (170). Hammond, and Feldman and Scott-Kilvert, are all referring to Chapter IV of the 1831 edition (which is one of the shorter chapters in the book). They should, of course, be referring to Chapter 4 in the Last Draft, whether in Volume I or II. Chapter 4 of Volume I (which I have identified as the half of "Ch. 2 [ altered from 3]½") is very very short (it corresponds, as previously noted, to Rieger 40.18 — 43.30). Mary must be referring in her letter to Chapter 4 of Volume II of the Last Draft. As I have conjectured in section I above, in its prior form this Chapter 4 (the last rewritten half of which survives as Part C r ) would presumably have corresponded to chapters V and VI (the second corresponding to the rewritten C r ) of Volume Two of the 1818 edition — the story of Felix and Safie, the heart of the monster's narrative (itself the book's central narrative, framed as it is by Frankenstein's narrative, and the outermost Walton context). It is possible that the unsatisfactory version of "the 4 Chap." that Mary, it may be, implicitly asks Percy to recall in her 5 December letter was transcribed (or drafted) in the latter pages of what could be the lost sixty-one pages of the British notebook. My hypothesis here is that for the Last Draft Mary began with the notion of drafting Volume I in the Continental notebook, and Volume II in the British notebook, but because the opening 61 and a bit pages in the British notebook was rethought, she followed Volume I in the Continental notebook with a revised version of all, or some of, the opening chapters of Volume II. In that case, Volume II "Chapter 4" in the Continental notebook would have replaced a series of pages (constituting one or more chapters) that ended ten pages before the surviving portion of "Chapter 6" in the British notebook. Although there is no evidence of work on Frankenstein between 11 January and 18 March 1817, every journal entry from 10 April through to 17 April 1817 begins with the notation "Correct F" (I: 166 — 168). Entries for 18 — 25, and 29 April, and 3 and 9 May, record the act of transcribing the Fair Copy, culminating on 13 May 1817 with the words "Finish transcribing" (I: 169) — the entry for 29 April adding "and correct F" (I: 168). The last journal entry relevant to the composition of Frankenstein is for Wednesday, 14 May 1817: "S. reads hist of Fr Rev. [ Précis historique de la Révolution française (1792) by Jean-Paul Rabaut Sainte-Étienne and Charles-Jean Dominique de Lacratelle] and corrects F. write Preface — Finis" (I: 169). 16 There have been two very different attempts to reconstruct the process of Frankenstein 's composition based on the facts assembled above: M. K. Joseph's "The Composition of Frankenstein ," Appendix A to his 1969 edition of the 1831 text, and Emily W. Sunstein's much more expansive account in her biography of Mary Shelley, a 1989 winner of the Modern Language Association Prize for Independent Scholars. Joseph narrows the starting date for Frankenstein to between 10 (or possibly 13) June and 22 June 1816, and goes on to point out that, sometime thereafter, Mary's original short story conception was being developed, on Shelley's urging, into a full-length novel. Journal entries show her at work on at least half the days in August, and on one occasion discussing the story with Shelley. Writing was interrupted by their departure from Geneva and return to England, and possibly not resumed in earnest until mid-December; the work seems to have been virtually complete when it was suspended for the visit to London and her marriage [on 30 December] to Shelley. Except for a few days early in 1817, Mary's journal gives no indications of further writing until late February or March. (Joseph 226 — 227) The journal indicates further writing in late March not February but what is particularly significant about this account is Joseph's assertion that Frankenstein was "virtually complete" by late December 1816. According to Sunstein, Frankenstein was only half done by that time. Her much more detailed reconstruction is characterized by a reliance on dogmatic assertion rather than argument; guesses are thereby passed off as facts. For Sunstein the novel was begun on the "morning after the poets sailed off" around the lake (122), i.e., on 23 June 1816. As I have indicated, the five sources — Polidori's diary, the 1818 Preface, Mary's 1824 letter to John Cam Hobhouse, Thomas Moore's 1830 life of Byron, and Mary's 1831 Introduction — do not allow for such precision. After the Chamonix tour, the Shelley party returned "to Chapuis [the Maison Chapuis, where they were staying] on July 27 . . . next day Mary observed the second anniversary of her elopement and continued her story" (Sunstein 123 — 124). Actually, Mary does not record any writing in her journal until the day after that, 29 July. After 21 August — the day "Shelley &amp; I talk about my story" ( Journals I: 130) — "Thanks to his 'incitement' she decided to make it into a full-length novel" (Sunstein 124). For Sunstein, this short-story version was written in Switzerland and the novel version after the return to England in September. As I have argued, I think it much more likely that the expansion decision occurred around 22 June (or shortly after 30 June). There is no logical connection between Mary's journal entry for 21 August and the conclusion that Sunstein draws from it. Having settled in Bath since to September 1816, "On October 18 Mary launched full into Victor's [i.e., Victor Frankenstein's] early life, and in ten days noted completing 'Chap. 2 ½' with his mother's death and his departure for Ingolstadt University" (Sunstein 127). Since the half refers to "Chap. 4" of Rough Draft Volume I, Mary had actually completed a bit more, namely her account of Frankenstein's conversion to modern science at the instigation of professors Kempe and Waldman. (And hence Mary's recourse to the work of Sir Humphry Davy around this time.) According to Sunstein, Mary "finished Volume I on November 20 . . ." (127). Sunstein does not explain that her evidence here is the "[137]" journal entry, and the Volume I she is referring to here is not, as one would expect, Volume I of the Last Draft but the rather different Volume One of the 1818 edition. Mary, claims Sunstein, then switched to the "longer sheets" (127) that constitute my Part D of the Last Draft, in spite of the fact that chapters 13 and 14 of Volume I and chapters 1 — 4 of Volume II of the Last Draft intervene between page 137 of Volume I and Part D. Presumably she is assuming the existence of at least thirty-one longer leaves — 61 pages — now lost. "On December 5 Shelley left to look for a house at Marlow" and "Mary was finishing Chapter IV [of the Last Draft] of Volume II [of the 1818 edition]" (128). Here Sunstein has more or less correctly understood the reference to the "very long" Chapter 4 of Frankenstein in Mary's letter to Percy; she realizes (unlike Feldman and Scott-Kilvert, and Hammond) that Mary was writing about Chapter 4 in Volume II of the surviving draft, not Volume I. Sunstein explains in a note that "This very long chapter was revised. The present Chapter VI of Volume II [of the 1818 edition] was originally V" (431 n37). Sunstein is in the right vicinity but, as I have explained, the revised draft "Chapter 5" (seemingly Percy's "another Chapter") or 1818 Chapter VI involved, was most probably previously part of a very long Chapter 4. She goes on to assert, "The morning after Shelley's return, December 15, . . . Mary was about halfway through Frankenstein . . . " (128). Sunstein has assumed, because Chapter VI of Volume Two of the 1818 edition marks roughly the halfway point, that the manuscript material which Mary drafted between 3 January 1817 (when Sunstein asserts, "Mary Shelley recommenced Frankenstein at about the point where the monster is driven off by the horrified De Lacys [a spelling at Rieger 128.17 which replaces the previous 'De Lacey']" [129]) and 9 April 1817 (the day Sunstein claims that Mary reached "the end of the last volume" [131]), corresponds to the second half of the 1818 edition, i.e., Chapter VII of Volume Two through to the end of Volume Three. So, on the one hand, Joseph (who consulted a microfilm of what he calls accurately enough the "rough copy" [xv]) claims that Frankenstein was about done by late December 1816 while, on the other, Sunstein (who examined the actual Last Draft but apparently believed it to be the original rough draft of the novel) claims that Mary was only halfway there. Who is correct? For the moment I note only that Mary's extant journal records writing on 63 days in 1816 beginning on 24 July. To that figure must be added an unknown number of days between 22 June (at the latest) and 20 July 1816 (a period for which Mary's journal is missing). If Mary wrote every day during that period, her total of potential Frankenstein writing days in 1816 amounts to ninety-two (forty-eight of which apply to the period back in England). This plausible number should be weighed against the ambiguously recorded possible twenty-one days of potential Frankenstein writing in 1817. That figure includes the period when she claims to have written "every day" — presumably 19 March — 1 April 1817. That period was followed by a visit from William Godwin (2 — 6 April), and whatever dates in early April applied to "A[lba] comes. C.[laire] has been with us a week before" (Alba was Claire's baby daughter by Byron; Journals I: 166). The figures here are obviously in Joseph's favour. 17 It remains to determine, on the basis of altered character names in the Last Draft, the likelihood as to whether or not that draft was written, as Sunstein for the most part assumes, in the narrative order of the 1818 edition (only the initial Walton frame letters were added out of that order according to Sunstein [126]). If Sunstein's hypothesis is false, it would be possible to account for Mary's writing a midpoint chapter in December 1816 and essentially completing the Last Draft of the novel around the same time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Of the seven altered or alternate character names in the Last Draft of Frankenstein , two are of particular interest: Carignan/Clerval/Clairval and Amina/Maimouna/Safie. The first of these is in fact the first encountered in the Last Draft and in both cases the order I have given of the alternative names depends upon their appearance in the Last Draft narrative sequence — a sequence that may or may not have corresponded to the order of its writing. In the second paragraph of Part A of the Last Draft are two references (the first introductory) to Frankenstein's long-term friend "Henry Carignan," with "Carignan" deleted and "Clerval" substituted: "Henry [Carignan cancelled ] ˄Clerval˄ was the son[e cancelled ] of a merchant [as cancelled ] of Geneva [and cancelled ] an intimate friend of my father[s cancelled ]" (p. 41; see Fig. 1; cf. Rieger 30.27 — 28); "In [this cancelled ] the description of our domestic circle I include Henry [Carignan cancelled ] ˄Clerval˄" (p. 42; cf. Rieger 31.25 — 26). But a couple of sentences later, at the end of the paragraph, the name "Clerval" appears on its own as the unambiguous first choice: "we were never completely happy when Clerval was absent" (p. 43; Rieger 32.4). It is the form "Clerval," of course, which appears throughout the published text. The question arises: Was "Carignan" Mary's first choice for the name of Frankenstein's friend, in which case the deletions and the inserts represent her subsequent preference for "Clerval," a preference apparently fixed on at the end of the paragraph containing the second deleted "Carignan"? Or had she fixed on "Clerval" at some previous point in the composition process and experimentally or absent-mindedly substituted "Carignan" in the initial instances in Part A of the Last Draft but quickly changed her mind and reverted to "Clerval"? To determine which of these possibilities is the more likely it is necessary to track all the references to "Clerval" and "Clairval" ("Carignan" does not reappear in the entire extant Last Draft). In the Part A1 insert material, the name "Clerval" appears in a passage which was deleted by a zigzag line: "[one evening cancelled ] that I spent in town at the house of Clerval's [father?]" (folio 3 r , as numbered by Margaret Crum of the Bodleian; the entire omitted material follows on "cheerfully consented" at Rieger 36.2). After the initial page 43 instance an unsubstituted "Clerval" appears twenty more times in Part A of the Last Draft: three times on page 80 (Rieger 55.2, 55.6, 55.12), once on pages 83, 84, 86, and 87 (Rieger 56.24, 56.35, 57.33, 58.9), twice on page 96 (Rieger 62.32, 63.11), once on page 97 (Rieger 63.22), three times on page 98 (Rieger 64.2, 64.10, 64.15), twice on page 100 (Rieger 65.2, 65.12), once on pages 101 and 106 (Rieger 65.20, 68.20), twice on page 107 — the first time in a Percy insert (Rieger 68.29, 68.32), and on page 108 (Rieger 69.12). After Frankenstein bids farewell to Clerval following the last reference above — in the penultimate chapter of Volume One of the 1818 edition — Clerval does not reappear in that edition until the opening chapter of Volume Three (at Rieger 150.18). But in the corresponding Last Draft Chapter 10 of Volume II (Part D) he first reappears as "Clairval"; Frankenstein's father suggests, in a passage cancelled by three vertical lines, that "you should accompany Henry Clairval in a journey he intends to make to England" (p. 100; cf. Rieger 151.5 — 6). This prompted the following marginal suggestion by Percy, a suggestion cancelled (because acted upon) by a vertical line: "I think the journey to England ought to be Victor's proposal: — I think he ought to go for the purpose of collecting knowledge for the formation of a female. He ought to lead his father to this in the conversation, — the conversation commences right enough" (p. 100). The major rewrite which this prompted, the fourth such in the extant Last Draft, appears on three inserted leaves following leaf 101/102 (or for citation purposes 101 A /102 A ): 101 B /102 B , blank/unpaginated; unpaginated/unpaginated. All these inserted leaves are probably from the same notebook (the first two leaves are an intact bifolium). The rewrite corresponds to Rieger 149.5 ("But it is") — 151.14. Suddenly, the spelling "Clerval" appears five successive times: twice in a cancelled passage on page 101 A , once in the inserted rewrite on the first unnumbered recto (Rieger 150.18), and twice on page 103 (Rieger 151.34, 152.8). But all the following references in Last Draft Chapter 11 (albeit "11" is deleted and replaced by "2," the chapter number in the 1818 edition Volume Three) through to Chapter 17 — twenty-two in all — are to "Clairval" corrected as "Cl[air cancelled ] ˄er˄val" or "Cl[ai cancelled ] ˄e˄rval." When Frankenstein's friend is next referred to — in Chapter 18 of Volume II of the Last Draft (the last Part D chapter) — it is after his death and he appears once more as "Clerval": in his sleep Frankenstein "beheld Clerval enjoying health &amp; youth" (p. 177; cf. Rieger 202.7). And the remaining three references follow suit (p. 183, Rieger 206.26; p. 187, Rieger 209.18; p. 188, Rieger 209.32). In the Last Draft the various references to Frankenstein's friend appear in the following sequential order of variants: [Carignan cancelled ] (in Part A) and Clerval (in parts A and A1); and Clairval, Clerval, Cl[air cancelled ] ˄e˄rval or Cl[ai cancelled ] ˄e˄rval, and Clerval (all in Part D). If this order of variants does in fact correspond to the order of writing, one must attribute the bizarre order to extreme forgetfulness or inconsistency. Whatever might be imputed to the order Carignan-Clerval-Clairval, there is, however, at least one readily recoverable logic to the sequence Clairval-Clerval-Carignan. It could represent an increasing movement away from Mary's likely source, the surname Clairmont as in Mary Jane Clairmont, her stepmother, Charles Clairmont, her stepbrother, and Clara Mary Jane Clairmont (or Claire Clairmont as she preferred to be known), her stepsister. Claire was Mary's co-dweller (along with Shelley) at the Maison Chapuis. Mary could well have arrived at the name "Clairval" by substituting the French "val" (valley) for the French "mont" (mountain), a feminine symbol for a masculine one. 18 (Further support for this derivation is provided by the fact that Claire, Byron's insecure mistress, in a letter informing him that she was on her way to Geneva, told him to address letters to her as "Clairville" so as to distance herself from the name "Clairmont" and ugly memories of her mother [Grylls 59 n3].) It would seem logical to suppose that Mary subsequently altered "Clair" to "Cler" in order to make the connection between "Clairval" and "Clairmont" less blatant. Considered in the light of the hypothesis that "Clairmont" was a move away from "Clerval," Mary's momentary recourse to the name "Carignan" may not have been her starting point; rather it may be evidence of a later impulse to obliterate entirely what might too easily be seen as an allusion to the name "Clairmont." A more likely hypothesis, however, would be that "Carignan" was the name that Mary originally used in the now lost rough draft, or rough drafts. Its brief appearance at the beginning of the Last Draft would represent a momentary confused harking back to that earlier version because the Last Draft was being copied from the earlier version. In either case, it seems most productive to focus attention on the Clairval/Clerval variants. The most plausible model for Clerval is not Mary's stepsister but her stepbrother Charles Gaulis Clairmont. Born in 1795, in 1816 he would have been much the same age as Clerval when the plot of Frankenstein begins. Clerval displays Charles' talent for languages. Indeed "Languages were his [chief cancelled ] ˄principal˄ study for he wished to open a field for ˄their˄ self-instruction on his return [ to Geneva ] — [Greek cancelled ] Persian [&amp; cancelled ] Arabic &amp; Hebrew gained his attention [when cancelled and followed by Percy's "X" keyed substitution X as soon as] he had become perfectly master of the Greek &amp; Latin languages" (Vol. I, p. 99; cf. Rieger 64.16 — 20). In The Godwins and the Shelleys , William St Clair writes of Charles, "As befitted a child from such an international background [his mother had French family connections and his father Karl Gaulis, anglicized to Charles Clairmont, came from a noted Swiss family] he showed an early talent for languages, speaking French and German as well as later learning Spanish and Italian" (297). He would work as an English language teacher in Vienna and, in 1828, hoped (futilely) to be appointed professor of German at the University College of London. 19 If, discounting "Carignan," the surviving Last Draft of Frankenstein was written according to the sequence "Clairval," then "Clerval" (and the "Clairval"s then corrected), Mary must have begun with Part D on the British paper (the 1818 Volume Two, Chapter VII — Volume Three, Chapter VII). In other words, in Part D she first decided on "Clairval" at the beginning of Chapter 10, toyed with "Clerval" in the remainder of Chapter 10 (apparently both before and after Percy's read-through and his re-write suggestion), returned to "Clairval," and finally fixed on "Clerval" in Chapter 18; then, in Part A she continued to use "Clerval," except for a brief, perhaps absentminded, initial substitution of "Carignan." 20 However, if Mary was to some extent alternating between Volume I in the Continental notebook and Volume II in the British notebook, it is possible that Volume II Chapter 18, with its "Clerval" references, was written after the establishment of "Clerval" in Part A. At least consistent evidence for this reconstruction of the order in which Mary Shelley wrote the surviving Last Draft — essentially a process of circling back — is provided by the Amina/Maimouna/Safie sequence of variants. These variants follow five other altered character names in the Last Draft which occur in the following order: Waldham/Waldman, Justine Martin/Justine Moritz, Miss Mansfeld/Miss Mansfield, Hofland/Duvillard, and the particularly teasing Elizabeth/Myrtella/Elizabeth. While all these are of interest in their own right, they will not help us with the task of de-composing Frankenstein and hence my discussion of them is relegated to an appendix. The character finally named Safie figures in the monster's narrative, the central of three concentric or nested narratives (Walton's, Frankenstein's, and the monster's). In an improbably contrived situation, while eavesdropping on the inhabitants of a cottage (an old blind man named De Lacey and his grown children, Agatha and Felix, and Felix's fiancée Safie), the monster learns to understand and speak French (as Felix teaches the Turkish-born Safie the language), reads three books ( Paradise Lost , one volume of Plutarch's Lives , and The Sorrows of Young Werther ), and learns of Safie's history. 21 After the missing pages 22 — 57 (which would have included the introduction of Safie), in the complicated, jumbled text of Part C r that Percy headed "another Chapter" (57 B ; Chapter VI of Volume Two of the 1818 edition), there are three references to "Safie" which also occur in the 1818 edition: two on page 57 B (Rieger 118.3 and 118.8) and one on page 58 (Rieger 118.24), and a fourth which does not (in an abandoned sentence fragment): "The Turk informed Safie of his intentions and" (p. 59; following Rieger 118.33). A horizontal line has been drawn under this sentence fragment; and under the line, and against the continuation number "64" in the margin, the text continues from page 63. It further continues on the unpaginated verso of page 59, which has the continuation number "65" in the left margin about one-fifth down the page, and concludes on one side of an unpaginated fragment of white paper, probably British (for exact correlations with the 1818 edition see footnote 6 above). Five more "Safie" references appear in this textual hopscotch: one in the "64" material (Rieger 121.26), and four in the "65" material (Rieger 122.7, 122.20, at 122.21, and 122.24), the third being deleted in favour of the insert "˄the Arabian˄." All these "Safie references occur on the pages of the third or central Part C r bifolium. In a previous version, on the cancelled page 57 A there is one reference to "[the Arabian cancelled ]" that was changed to "Safie" in the rewrite on page 57 B (the first such reference noted above); the immediately following "Safie" reference in the revision is missing in the concelled version. That version breaks off with "in his favour" (unpaginated verso of 57 A ; Rieger 118.21) and, after a horizontal line, a lengthy passage commences on the same physical page under the continuation number "59" in the left margin. This passage, which follows on "the consummation of his happiness" on the recto numbered 59 (Rieger 118.33), begins with the words "During the ensueing days" ("59"; Rieger 118.34) and ends with the words "deprived of his wealth" (p. 63; Rieger 121.24). It is in the first paragraph of this "59" passage that the Amina/Maimouna/Safie variants first appear. Since "Safie" was the third chronological choice, the conclusion is inescapable that the "59" passage, like the cancelled passage it follows on, was written before the passages containing the unequivocal "Safie" references detailed above. In the "59" passage opening paragraph, the monster recalls that "[Amina cancelled ] ˄Safie˄ related that her mother was a Christian Arab" who "had won the heart of the [pr cancelled ] father of [Amina cancelled ] ˄Safie˄" (cf. Rieger 119.13 — 15) and (continuing on page 60) that "This Lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed in the mind of [Maimouna cancelled ] [˄Amina˄ cancelled ] ˄Safie˄" (see Fig. 2; cf. Rieger 119.22). At the conclusion of this essay I shall explain Mary's choice of the names "Amina," "Maimouna," and "Safie"; but for the moment it is essential to note only that in this paragraph "Amina" was Mary's first chronological choice, "Maimouna" her second, and "Safie" her third. The two appearances of "Amina" here are as puzzling as the two earlier appearances of "Carignan." Both deleted names disappear entirely from the surviving draft after their second appearance. And in both cases Mary could be accidentally copying superseded name choices from her earlier, now lost, rough draft(s). There may well have been a preliminary version of the novel in which Frankenstein's friend was called Carignan and Felix's fiancée was called Amina. In Part D of the Last Draft there are six instances where Mary's apparent second choice "Maimouna" appears; in each case "Maimouna" is deleted in favour of the inserted "˄Safie˄" (p. 67 [Rieger 126.35], p. 70 [Rieger 128.21], twice on p. 75 [Rieger 131.23 and 25], 82 [Rieger 135.26], and p. 184 [Rieger 207.13] in the closing Walton frame). 22 The conclusion is again inescapable. Since a cancelled "Maimouna" replaced by a "Safie" insert appears in the last Part D chapter, virtually all of Part D must have been written before at least all the portions of Part C r where the name "Safie" appears not as an insert but as Mary's clear final name choice — something which happens at least once somewhere on every page (including the scrap) except for the three first written (pages 57 A , its unpaginated verso with the continuation number "59," and page 60). In fact, since this rewritten material, however erratic, appears to have been drafted consecutively, we may conclude that all of C r must have been written after virtually all of Part D; the Safie variants in the first paragraph of what I have called the "'59' passage" are all accidental throwbacks to, or copyings of, superseded name choices. This could well apply even if the change of ink and pen-cut at the start of the page 60 paragraph immediately following the Safie variants indicates an interval elapsed after Mary's decision to temporarily break off at that point and rewrite the first rewrite (see Fig. 2). What we have here, then, is a circling back movement, similar to the movement suggested by the Clairval/Clerval variants from Part D to parts A and A1. 23</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Putting these two movements together implies a copying/redrafting process that might be crudely imaged as an inward-moving spiral. However, before arriving at any final conclusions it is necessary to consider all the content evidence in relation to all the physical and all the temporal evidence. The fact that Part C r was drafted after all, or virtually all, of Part D does not prove that the previous material on Continental paper was written after Part D. There are, however, three additional matters of content which do further indicate that most, if not all, of Part D was written before all, or at least some very substantial portion, of the material on Continental paper. The first of these involves the assumption that, if Part D was written first, it might well contain temporal pointing that would be disjunctive with that in the preceding material. The matter of Clerval's age is consistent with this assumption. Simply put, the chronology established in parts A through C r puts Clerval's age at the time of Part C r around 22, while in Part D, after the passage of two more years, his age is estimated at around 20 (instead of around 25). When Clerval is introduced at the beginning of Last Draft Volume I, it is implied that he is the same age as Frankenstein: Clerval "compensated" for the fact that "My brothers were considerably younger than myself . . ." (p. 41; Rieger 30.25 — 26). Frankenstein is "seventeen" (p. 47; Rieger 37.9) when he goes to university; after working "hard for nearly two years" (p. 76; Rieger 52.25) he animates his creation; when he finally returns to Geneva "nearly five years" (p. 108) have passed ("nearly six years" in the 1818 edition [Rieger 69.21]) since he left, nearly "two years" (p. 113; cf. Rieger 72.11) since the monster's animation — "Five years ["Six years" (Rieger 73.10)] had elapsed — passed as a dream . . ." (p. 115), a time notation mentioned a third time on page 120 (cf. Rieger 75.27). (The three changed references to "six years" in the 1818 edition represents a rounding upwards rather than downwards; the elapsed time in both the Last Draft and the published work is actually about five and a half years.) About "two months" (p. 145; Rieger 89.20 — 21) after the wrongful execution of the servant Justine, Volume I ends with the monster about to tell his story. At this point both Frankenstein and Clerval must be at least 22. But in Volume II Part D (which continues the monster's narrative begun in Volume II parts B and C r ), after a fourth two-year, or nearly two-year, passage of time, "two years of exile" (p. 102 A ; Rieger 151.15 — 16), Clerval's corpse is described by a witness as that of "a handsome young man about twenty years of age" (p. 134). If Mary was writing in the British notebook with an awareness of the previously written, careful and reiterated time specifications in the Continental notebook, she would surely have calculated that Clerval at his death would be about 25 years old. The mistake is understandable however if Mary had not yet worked out a detailed chronology for Volume I of her Last Draft because at least the extant portion of it had not yet been redrafted. In the 1818 edition, taking account of the six year absence, Clerval's estimated age at his death is corrected to "about five and twenty years" (Rieger 172.19). A second area of content evidence conclusively demonstrates that Part C r was written after at least the opening of Part D. The end of Part C r overlaps (rather than underlaps) the beginning of Part D. Part D begins on page 62 as follows: "[having overcome many difficulties succeeded at length in joining her lover in his retreat cancelled ] [¶] Such was the history . . ." (cf. Rieger 122.26 — 28). The sentence which is not cancelled, but which appears to have been written immediately after the cancelled fragment, corresponds exactly to the opening sentence of Chapter VII of Volume Two of the 1818 edition. A passage that constitutes a rewrite of the two cancelled lines occurs in Part C r on the unnumbered fragment of paper that concludes the material keyed to continuation numbers "64" and "65": ". . . after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive safely at the cottage of her lover." This corresponds to the closing sentence of the preceding Chapter VI of Volume Two of the 1818 edition (Rieger 122.25 — 27). It follows as a certainty that two opening lines of Part D and at least some of the contemporaneously written, immediately following material was drafted before C r . Furthermore, it may be conjectured that C r replaces a cancelled section of text (in the British notebook?) that began on page 57 line 1 and continued through to page 62 line 2. Although it cannot be conclusively proven that most or all of the rest of Part D, the rest of the extant material on British paper, was redrafted before all of the extant material on Continental paper, there is a third and final point related to content (and to the second point above) that certainly further encourages that conclusion. I have raised the possibility that the pagination of Part D does not continue the Volume II pagination begun by Part B. Correspondingly, the chapterization of Part D appears not to follow on that begun by Part B and continued by the missing long "Chapter 4." The following diagram attempts to crudely relate the adjoining chapterizations leading up to and away from the area of overlap between text on Continental paper (including the concluding slip of different paper) and that on British with the chapterization of Volume Two of the 1818 edition. The first line represents material assumed to have been written earliest in time; the last (the 1818 text) that created latest. The broken lines represent material that can be assumed but is not extant. It is possible that the material on British paper is here out of the correct chronological order and should appear in between the very long "Chapter 4" and "another Chapter." If that were the case, "Chapter 4" must have been converted into chapters 4, 5, and 6 (which may have been written on British paper? or corresponded to the same numbered chapters on the British paper?), rather than into the two chapters that the surviving evidence would lead one to suppose. Only then would the chapterization on the British paper, which commences with "Chap. 7 th " (p. 70; written at the same time as the chapter opening) follow on that which preceded in narrative sequence. It might be common-sensically supposed from the physical evidence that Mary wrote on the Continental paper while in Switzerland and subsequently on the British paper when she was back in England. However, the evidence that Mary Shelley's allusions in her journal to "Ch. 2 [ altered from 3]½" (on 27 October 1816), and to "(137)" (on 20 November 1816), and in a letter to "the 4 Chap." (on 5 December 1816) are all to be applied to sequential portions of parts A, [B — C], and [C] (where [B — C] and [C] represents the sections of the Last Draft missing between parts B and D) comes close to proving that, when she was back in England, she was writing on the Continental paper. The spaced narrative order of the allusions strongly suggests that, from approximately the last week of October to the first week of December 1816, she was writing parts A, A1, B, [B — C], and [C] of the Last Draft. The question remains, If Mary was writing parts A through [C] after being back in England for six weeks or so, what Frankenstein material was written in Switzerland and the first weeks back in England? Although three allusions, apparently to content aspects of the Last Draft on Continental paper, have survived, unfortunately there are no surviving allusions that can be linked to Mary's writing in the British notebook. One might speculate as to whether or not the five and a "half" chapters which at some point presumably preceded Part D were Last Draft chapters that corresponded to the opening chapters of the rough draft of Volume II, or were in fact an entire preceding version of Frankenstein — a version that had not been divided into two volumes. Such a version might have begun with the animation of the monster and only taken five and a "half" chapters (amounting to 61 pages) to reach the point at which Part D begins. Five and a "half" chapters does seem about right for 61 pages; 62 more pages brings the narrative to the end of Chapter 12 on page 123 (i.e., six and a "half" chapters in only slightly more pages). To understand Part D as the Last Draft continuation of an opening portion that would be discarded, could account for the apparent chapterization discrepancy between parts A to C r and Part D. It could also account for the discrepancy between the apparent thirty-six-page manuscript gap between parts B and C r and the only just over eight seemingly corresponding pages in Rieger's 1818 edition. If there was a one-volume version of Frankenstein , of which only Part D now survives, that version would have contained eighteen chapters, one for each year of its young author's age at the time the work was conceived and its composition begun. But to return to somewhat harder evidence, what of the temporal data? There is evidence of approximately fifty Frankenstein writing days before the last week of October 1816, sufficient time to produce a preliminary draft of the novel in Switzerland and to produce on British paper the Part D "rough copy" during the first six weeks back in England (which include approximately twelve recorded writing days). It seems rather unlikely that Mary drafted Part D in the first quarter of 1817 prior to 9 April, the latest day on which she might have completed the Last Draft. There is little evidence of sustained composition during this period. The data is much more compatible with revision work. In the light of all the content, physical, and temporal evidence there would appear to be at least two possible timetable reconstructions of the process of rough copying/redrafting based on the following two possible approximate orderings of the Last Draft parts [including lost parts within square brackets]: A and A1, B, [B — C], [C], D, [B — C r ?] and C r (where [B — C r ?] represents a revision of [B — C], if there was such a revision, and C r of [C]); or [pre-D?], D, A and A1, B, [B — C], [C], [B — C r ?], and [C r ] (where all, or some portion of B — [C] represents a revision of [pre-D?], and C r survives as a second revision of the last part of [pre-D?], the lost 61 pages [if it was 61 and a gap had not been deliberately left] that preceded the present Part D). Given, under content evidence, (1) the lack of references to "Clairval" (in place of Clerval) in parts A and A1, and the indecision between "Clairval" and "Clerval" in Part D, (2) Clerval's regressed age in Part D, and (3) the possible chapterization discrepancy between the two notebooks, the second ordering, involving a circling back to parts A and A1 followed by movement inwards to Part [C r ], seems the most likely. The temporal evidence pointing to a lack of sustained Frankenstein composition in 1817 supports this order. A physical evidence argument also in favor of this second ordering would note the oddity of there remaining at least three unused bifolia of Continental paper on which C r would be written after the completion of Part D, if one were to assume that the drafting of Part D directly followed on the missing Part [C], i.e., that Mary moved on to the English notebook when she had completed the Continental one or otherwise run out of Continental paper. The following four stages of composition, redrafting, and revision would be compatible with my second ordering: (1) The lost "transcript" of Mary's "waking dream" beginning: " It was on a dreary night of November ". This was probably written somewhere around 22 June 1816. It may have led almost immediately to her jotting down an outline for a "short tale" (Rieger 228). (2) A novel-length version in preliminary rough draft or rough drafts form. This may have been written in medias res as a continuation of the Stage 1 "transcript" before backing up to include earlier material. It may have been composed in the form of separately paginated segments. 24 This preliminary version (and perhaps the first chapter of Volume I of the Last Draft) could have been written in Switzerland between somewhere around 23 June and somewhere around 25 August 1816. (3) The Last Draft. It is possible that Volume I on Continental paper and Volume II on British paper were, to some degree, written concurrently. Possibly having written Chapter 1 of Volume I (whether in Switzerland or in England) Mary Shelley in Bath, knowing that the following chapters presented difficulties and would require some scientific and philosophical reading (for her account of the monster's growing awareness she studied Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding intensively between 18 November 1816 and 8 January 1817 25 ), may well have turned to redrafting Volume II, which begins with the impetus of the monster's narrative, in a perhaps newly acquired British notebook. The copying/redrafting of Volume II, or perhaps of all but the very long last chapter of Volume II if she had not yet fully figured out the frame situation, could have occupied her between approximately 16 September and 24 October 1816. 26 Mary then, around 25 October, could have circled back to Volume I, picking up the narrative at the point she might have abandoned it (after Chapter 1?). She then completed Volume I and moved on, using the same Continental paper, to a revised drafting of the opening pages of Volume II (hence the first 61 pages drafted on British paper were discarded) completing Part [C] by 5 December 1816. (4) The revised Last Draft. The opening frame letters and all or part of the closing frame chapter and various local revisions, including the major revision C r (and a possible [B — C r ?]), could have been made during the twenty-or-so writing days of the period January to approximately 1 April 1817. Alternatively, my first ordering of the Last Draft parts — to my mind less likely — would involve some rejigging of stages 2 — 4 above. The preliminary drafting would need to have continued back in England until the last week or so of October. The material on Continental paper would then have been copied/redrafted during the period late October to 5 December 1816, after which, through to perhaps 10 January 1817 or some date beyond, Mary continued and concluded Volume II on the British paper (drafting the opening frame letters around the same time?). Then, at the end of March and the beginning of April 1817, she revised Part [C] as C r (and perhaps [B — C] as [B — C r ?]). However, this second hypothetical timetable, which would have involved a substantial amount of writing over what seems to be about twenty-one days in 1817, necessitates that the ordering evidence of the Clerval variants be discounted as accidental. Likewise the anomalous reference in Part D to Clerval's corpse looking like that of a young man of about twenty. And an extra chapter, for which we have absolutely no evidence, would need to be inserted in Volume II of the Last Draft between the surviving opening fragment of Chapter 3 and the surviving closing fragment of "Chapter 6." Both possible timetables have Mary essentially concluding the Last Draft with a revision of all, or just the last part, of the long "Chapter 4" that she had mentioned in her letter of 5 December 1816. The draft, or drafts, of that chapter are now lost except for the rewritten leaves that I have designated Part C r . According to both timetables, the C r rewrite would have taken place at, or around, the end of the creation of the Last Draft in 1817. But in the light of the second ordering timetable (the most probable in so far as it takes account of all the available evidence), we might now understand how it was possible that Frankenstein was, as M. K. Joseph supposes, essentially complete by late December 1816 and how it was, as Emily W. Sunstein determines, that Mary was working on a mid-point chapter around the same time. It is possible, indeed probable, that in December 1816 Mary was not faced with still having to write the last half of Frankenstein because that last half, Part D, was largely written before she wrote mid-point "Chapter 4." 4 In that case, what time Mary spent on the Last Draft from January to approximately 9 April 1817 was devoted to further revision, filling in, and patching. 28</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V While there are only two extended analyses of the Frankenstein manuscripts (Murray; Mellor 57 — 68, 219 — 224) prior to the present one, analyses of the published text, whether the 1818 or the 1831 edition, or both, number in the hundreds. The question now arises, What are the interpretative implications of the analysis of the Last Draft that I have provided? The best way to answer this question is to review two articles which — amidst the sea of interpretation — are lent particular and quite startling support by what may be deduced about Mary Shelley's inward-spiralling process of redrafting and revision: Marc A. Rubenstein's "'My Accursed Origin': The Search for the Mother in Frankenstein ," and Joseph W. Lew's "the Deceptive Other: Mary Shelley's Critique of Orientalism in Frankenstein ," an article that builds significantly on Rubenstein's. Rubenstein argues that Frankenstein 's concentric narrative arrangement implies a structural central point that is symbolically equivalent to the North Pole — the imagistic focus of Walton's quest and the approximate site of the novel's conclusion. That structural centre is the monster's rendition of Safie's account (in her letters to Felix) of her mother: [Amina cancelled ] ˄Safie˄ related that her Mother was a Christian Arab seized and made a slave by the [t cancelled ] Turks. [&amp; cancelled ] Recommended by her beauty she had won the heart of the [pr cancelled ] father of [Amina cancelled ] ˄Safie˄ who married her. The young girl spoke in high &amp; enthusiastic [60; this page number appears twice ] terms of her Mother who born in freedom spurned the bondage [that cancelled ] ˄to which˄ she was now [obliged cancelled ] [˄to which˄ cancelled ] [to submit. cancelled ] [ next word in Percy's hand ] ˄reduced.˄ She instructed her [r added ] daughter in the tenets of her religion &amp; taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect &amp; an independance of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Mahomet. [Amina sickened cancelled ] This Lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed in the mind of [Maimouna cancelled ] [˄Amina˄ cancelled ] ˄Safie˄ who sickened at the prospect of again returning to [Turkey cancelled ] [ next word in Percy's hand ] ˄Asia˄ and the[n] being immured in [the] walls of a haram [occupi cancelled ] [&amp; cancelled ] allowed only to occupy herself with puerile amusements ill suited to the temper of her soul now accustomed to grand ideas &amp; a noble emulation for [u cancelled ] virtue. (II: 59 — 60; cf. Rieger 119.13 — 26; the 1831 text is virtually unchanged here.) Safie's mother, Rubenstein declares, convincingly and for the first time, "is surely a cartoon, distorted but recognizable, of the author's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft" (169). The novel's hints at the Hyperborean myth of a warm polar womb are explained in terms of Mary's interest in her own conception and the tragic death of her mother following Mary's birth. The account of Safie's mother occurs in what can be assumed to have been "Chapter 4" of Volume II of the Last Draft — that lengthy chapter towards which (according to my reconstruction of the drafting/copying/revision process) Mary had moved inwards in December 1816 (and in March 1817?); that chapter which seems to have given her particular difficulty to judge from the extant manuscript; and that chapter with which she essentially completed the drafting of Frankenstein . In other words, the theme that Rubenstein abstracts from the published text (with its spiral-like, concentric structure) — Mary's search for her own mother — was enacted by the inward-spiralling movement that characterizes the order in which she actually composed and revised her manuscript. Although an analysis of "Safie and her unnamed father and mother, the only specifically Oriental personages within the narrative" (256), provides the climax of Joseph W. Lew's article, he devotes considerable space to Oriental elements in Frankenstein , as his projective synopsis (here abbreviated) makes clear: This article begins by reviewing references to Oriental narratives in the text, the Oriental and Orientalist works which we know Mary Shelley to have read, the Orientalist poems Byron and Percy Shelley were writing in 1816 and 1817, Mary Shelley's personal connections to East India House, and the Orientalist ambitions of Robert Walton and Henry Clerval. . . . Finally, I discuss Safie . . . . (225 — 256) Lew's argument is indebted to Edward Said, who describes the Orient as the source of one of Europe's "deepest and most recurring images of the Other" (1), and to Jacques Lacan. The Orient, the Other of Western civilization is — helped by puns on the French name for the "sea of ice" near Mont Blanc, Mer de Glace (sea mirror, mirror mother) — its self-reflection, its mirror image. Thus in the figures of Safie and her unnamed parents, "Having peeled back layer after layer, we find only the bourgeois nuclear family in Oriental drag" (282 — 283). Lew has moved on from the identification of Safie's mother with Mary's mother to the identification of Safie's father with Mary's father, William Godwin: The story of Safie's relationship with [her father and] her dead mother forms the innermost layer of the novel's concentric narratives. Having reached that centre, the Turkish harem (also the point most geographically remote from the novel's major axes of travel), we find that this Oriental family . . . is the image of Mary Shelley's own; when we think we have achieved the exotic, the Orient, we see only the utterly familiar. (281) Lew's entire argument, with its Lacanian conclusion that Frankenstein is "a hall of mirrors, a cautionary tale of a culture trapped in the mirror stage, and of the destruction that results from a way of seeing which can create only projections of Self" (283), interestingly complements mine in Frankenstein's Creation . In pursuing a broadly philosophical reading of Frankenstein , I distinguish between attempts to establish a relationship with, variously, a natural, a human, an inhuman and unnatural, and a transcendent Other, while exploring the sceptical, solipsistic undermining of all these forms of Otherness, all of which are exemplified by the monster. Lew's deceptive Oriental otherness might also be linked with this collapsing "four-fold Otherness" (Ketterer 105). 29 Lew has not exhausted the Oriental aspects of Frankenstein . 30 Although he makes a careful case for Frankenstein as a response to Percy Shelley's Orientalist poem "Alastor," he only once briefly notes (256) another of Shelley's Oriental poems, Laon and Cythna: or The Revolution of the Golden City , the epic he began while Mary was working on Frankenstein . 31 Shelley's Godwinian-inspired topic is a very idealized version of the French Revolution transposed to an Oriental setting. The temporarily successful revolt, organized by a brother and sister, Laon and the revolutionary feminist Cythna (who are loosely based on the atheistically-tarred Percy and Mary crossed with her mother) is celebrated by their incestuous union. In the censored version of the poem that was published as The Revolt of Islam (1818), Laon and the orphan Cythna are merely friends, much as Mary toned down the brother-sister relationship between Elizabeth and Victor Frankenstein in the 1831 edition. 32 As for the changed title of Shelley's poem, William St Clair explains that just as "a war to drive the Turks out of Europe was a universally accepted convention of a just revolution," so "Under another old convention writers could more safely attack religion if they called it Mohammedanism. Before the French Revolution philosophers teased the censors by pretending that their books were printed in Constantinople" (432). The same conventions should be applied to the story of Safie, who "arrived from Constantinople" (p. 57; Rieger 118.8), and her Turkish father who "had [li cancelled ] inhabited Paris for many years when his person became [for some cancelled ] [ next insert in Percy's hand ] ˄for some reason which I [ the monster ] could not learn˄ obnoxious to the government" (p. 57; cf. Rieger 118.4 — 6) and was condemned to death; after his escape he hires a vessel to take him "to [Can cancelled ] Constantinople" (p. 59 [insert passage "64" to follow page 63]; Rieger 122.2). The sympathetic treatment here, combined with the Oriental subject matter, surely goes some way to explaining why, in her letter of 5 December 1816, Mary expressed the belief that Percy "would like" her "very long" "4 Chap. of Frankenstein" (I: 22). In Laon and Cythna the tyrants quickly recover power and the eponymous protagonists suffer the fate that Mary's monster projects for himself: they are burnt to death. In the concluding canto, however, having been resurrected, they travel by canoe with their child to "Elysian islands, bright and fortunate, / Calm dwellings of the free and happy dead" ( Complete Poetical Works 262; XII.31, 4727 — 28). (Compare the discarded Elysian framework of Mary's 1819 draft, "The Fields of Fancy," a work which also features incest; it was retitled Mathilda but not published until 1959. Similarly, Lord Verney, the eponymous character who stands in for Mary in her 1826 apocalyptic novel, The Last Man , hopes in conclusion "to moor my worn skiff in a creek, shaded by spicy groves of the odorous islands of the far Indian ocean" [342].) The "Elysian islands" which surround the Temple of the Spirit are introduced in the symbolic opening canto of Laon and Cythna . The Poet-narrator and his Lady (and the wounded serpent enfolded in her breast) are in a bark: . . . we had passed the ocean Which girds the pole, Nature's remotest reign — And we glode fast o'er a pellucid plain Of waters, azure with the noontide day. Ethereal mountains shone around — a Fane Stood in the midst, girt by green isles which lay On the blue sunny deep, resplendent far away. ( Complete Poetical Works 125; I: 48, 552 — 558) This is the same Hyperborea that figures in the opening of Frankenstein : the North Pole presents itself to Walton's imagination as a "region of beauty and delight" where "the sun is forever visible" (Rieger 9.16 — 17). 33 Of course, the Chinese-box structure of Frankenstein recalls what might be viewed as an Orientalist literary model — the framed story sequence of a work like the Arabian Nights' Entertainments . As it happens, Frankenstein makes a direct reference to an episode from that work when he describes his reaction to discovering the secret of life: "I was like the Arabian, who had been buried with the dead, and found a passage to life aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light" (p. 66; cf. Rieger 48.5 — 8). The "Arabian" is Sinbad, and the specific allusion is to his Fourth Voyage. But in characterizing him almost anonymously as "the Arabian," Mary Shelley surely is deliberately anticipating the only figure in her novel who is similarly identified (see Rieger 122.21) — Safie. What finally needs to be added to Lew's account can only be supplied by the Last Draft of Frankenstein . As insightful as his article is, it does contain at least one significant blind spot, something he could have avoided had he had access to that Last Draft. After reviewing the case for paralleling M ary S helley and "Walton's silent sister, the mysterious M argaret S aville [my emphases]," Lew points out that "in French . . . 'Saville' is almost homophonous with 'Safie.' Mary Shelley, Margaret Saville, and Safie become images of one another" (282). However, the name variants in the Last Draft, Amina/Maimouna/Safie, indicate quite clearly that it is Arabic pronunciation, not French, that is primarily relevant. All three names are associated with the Prophet Muhammad. Āmina bint-Wahab was the mother of Muhammad; she died when he was six. Her first name is equivalent to āmina , meaning "peaceful or feeling safe," and to amina meaning "to be or feel safe." The differently pronounced Amīna (most famously the name of Solomon's wife) is the feminine of amīn meaning "honest or trustworthy," and derives from amuna meaning "to be reliable or faithful" (Baker 361). Maimouna is a transliteration of Maymŭnah, the eleventh or thirteenth (if two concubines are counted) and last surviving wife of Muhammad; she was a fifty-one-year-old widow in Mecca when Muhummad married her. Her name, bestowed on her by Muhammad and related to āmina and amīna , and to amuna and ma'mūn (meaning "reliable, trustworthy" [Baker 374]), means "auspicious" or "blessed." 34 Safie is a transliteration of Ṣafiyyah, the ninth wife of Muhammad (whose name means "praiseworthy, possessing fine qualities" [Baker 375]). Ṣafiyyah, who married him when she was eighteen (Mary was only one year older when she married Percy), was the daughter of the chief of the Jewish tribe of Bann Nadir, one of the Prophet's bitterest enemies; she was captured and converted to Islam. In describing "the works of the orientalists," which Frankenstein followed Clerval in reading, Frankenstein mentions "the smiles &amp; [tears cancelled ] ˄frowns˄ of a fair enemy" (Volume I, 99; Rieger 64.28) as a typical ingredient. Clearly, Ṣafiyyah was an historical example of such a "fair enemy" and it should be noted that Safie's complexion is "wondrously fair" (in the missing pages 22 — 56 of Volume I of the Last Draft; Rieger 112.11). 35 Whether this imagistic connection is accidental or not, the Christian/Muslim lineage of Mary's character makes the name of the Jewish/Muslim Safiyyah/Safie a particularly appropriate choice among the names of those women linked with Muhammad. Safiyyah is Arabic for "confidante" or "bosom friend" and incorporates safa , "to be pure" (Baker 380). Lew, like presumably all readers of Frankenstein to date, assumed that "Safie" should be pronounced "Saf-ee," whereas in fact it might well be pronounced "Saf-i-yyah." If Safie's mother and father correspond to Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin, and Safie to Mary herself, then Safie's lover, Felix/Muhammad, must correspond to Percy. Apparently Mary viewed Percy as a type of the Prophet. It is of interest to note that Mary read Voltaire's play Mahomet, ou le Fanatisme (1742) on 5 June 1818 ( Journals I: 212), and that, in a letter dated 9 August 1830 to the publisher John Murray venturing various topics for his Family Library series, she writes: "A Friend suggested the life of Mahomet" ( Letters II: 113). In the absence of that life by Mary, a reader interested in learning more about Āmina, Maymŭnah, Ṣafiyyah, and Muhummad, might well consult Martin Ling's Muhammad (1983), supplemented by al-Shati' Bint's The Wives of the Prophet (1971), and M. H. Zaid's Mothers of the Faithful (1935). One might still wonder why, of all the names of all Muhammad's wives, Mary should have chosen Amina, Maimouna, and Safie. The answer would appear to be that the names occur (with two slight variations) in a narrative entitled "The Story of the three Calenders, Sons of Kings; and the five Ladies of Bagdad" (Weber I: 32 — 68). This tale sequence is part of "The Arabian Nights' Entertainments" which occupies most of Volume I of Henry Weber's magisterial 1812 compilation Tales of the East , a title that figures in Mary's reading list for 1815 ( Journals I: 92). Volume I concludes with part of "The New Arabian Nights" (the "New Arabian Nights" that Mary records in her 1815 list was apparently the separate edition — with four fewer tales — identified by editors Feldman and Scott-Kilvert as Arabian Tales; or, A Continuation of the Arabian Nights Entertainments , a 1794 translation of a 1793 French translation [ Journals I: 88]). Volume II continues with the remainder of "The New Arabian Nights," "The Persian Tales," "Persian Tales of Inatulla of Delhi," and "Oriental Tales." The concluding third volume contains "Mogul Tales," "Turkish Tales," "Tartarian Tales," "Chinese Tales," "Tales of the Genii," and "The History of Abdulla, the Son of Hanif." The five ladies of Bagdad in "The Story of the three Calenders" (who are the ladies' guests) are sisters; they share the same father but three of them had one mother and the remaining two another. No doubt this narrative made an impression on Mary because of the parallels with her own family situation. Godwin had two wives and five children; he was father to two of them and stepfather to the other three. In the story sequence, of the three sisters born to one of the mothers, one is named Zobeide and the other two (who as punishment for being jealous of Zobeide's projected marriage to a prince have been transformed into dogs — two black bitches) are unnamed (like the monster in Frankenstein ). The jealousy of the black bitches suggests a parallel with Claire Clairmont's jealousy of Mary's relationship with Percy. The two sisters born to the other mother are named Amine and Safie. In an embedded story, a princess is "possessed by Genie Maimoun, son of Dimdim, who is in love with her" (Weber I: 47). Maimoun is the masculine form of Maimouna or Maymŭnah. Mary would have been struck by the name Maimoun because of its English language homonym: May moon. "Maië" was one of Percy's affectionate nicknames for Mary ( Journals I: 80; Sunstein 96), and the moon (which is associated with the monster in Frankenstein ) an agreed-upon symbol for her ( Journals II: 434 n2; Dunn 226 — 227, 261, 274; Sunstein 194). 36 Thus the choice of the name Maimouna further corroborates the case for identifying Safie with Mary. The intricately interwoven narrative sequence includes six separately titled stories: "The History of the First Calender, a King's Son," "The Story of the Second Calender, a King's Son," "The Story of the envious Man, and of him that he envied" (this being a story within the Second Calender's story which underlines the envy/jealousy theme and includes the three page 47 references to Maimoun), "The Story of Zobeide," and "The Story of Amine." It might well have been as a result of the impact of the last story that Mary first alighted on the name Amina. Appropriately enough, Safie's tale is not related in "The Story of the three Calenders." The second volume of Tales of the East includes "The History of the Birth of Mahomet" (Weber II: 616 — 631), among the "Oriental Tales." In this four-tale sequence, the yet-to-be-born Mahomet selects one Zesbet to be his mother and renames her "Aminta" (Weber II: 630), a corruption of Amina. A daughter takes on the new identity of a mother; and Mahomet, as the source of the name of that new identity, seeks to incestuously sire himself (his "real" father in fact died before he was born). To the extent that the monster is Frankenstein's double, Frankenstein too might be said to incestuously sire himself. The name "Zesbet" has elements in common with the name "Elizabeth" and may have been a source. Whether it was or not, the relationship between Zesbet and Aminta, like that between Elizabeth and Amina/Safie (or that between Elizabeth and Frankenstein's mother) is that of daughter and mother. The alternates Maimouna and Safie (Safiyyah) add the role of wife. To complete the gamut of archetypal female roles, it is only necessary to evoke that of the whore. This Mary Shelley does with her sometime choice (previously noted) of the name "Myrtella" for Elizabeth. As my appendix below reveals, "Myrtella" derives from the name of a mistress and courtesan. These archetypal identities are all dependent on the complex procreative, erotic, and/or loving possibilities of sex. In usurping the procreative aspect of sex (thereby freeing the female from biological role determinism?), Frankenstein tragically (and unnecessarily?) denies the erotic and the loving aspects. This analysis of altered character names (among other matters) has taken us a considerable distance into new areas of fact and of interpretation. Clearly, the Last Draft — and Fair Copy fragments — of Frankenstein have much to teach us about that novel's composition and interpretation beyond the matter of Percy Shelley's input. In fact, few literary manuscripts are quite so revealing. A new stage of Frankenstein scholarship will be initiated by their study.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix: Five Other Altered Character Names in the Last Draft Between Frankenstein's departure for the university of Ingolstadt and the arrival of Safie there are five variant character names in the Last Draft. They are reviewed here in the order of their appearance. Early in Part A of the Last Draft, the professor named Wald man first appears as "M. W. ------˄aldham˄" (p. 56; cf. Rieger 41.11); thereafter "M r. Waldham" makes three appearances (twice on p. 57 [cf. Rieger 41.32, 41.35] and on p. 59 [cf. Rieger 43.12]). "Waldman" replaces "Waldham" in the following Chapter 5 of the Last Draft (p. 61; Rieger 45.9). The one subsequent reference, which is in Percy's hand, reverts to "Waldham": "M. Waldham expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress" (p. 62; cf. Rieger 45.26 — 27). Mary's alteration here was presumably made in the interest of verisimilitude — the German suffix "man" is more appropriate for the name of a professor at the German University of Ingolstadt than is the English suffix "ham." The servant Justine is surnamed Moritz in the 1818 edition. But two cancellations in the Last Draft indicate that Mary originally gave her the too-English (or too-French) name "Martin" and later changed it to the German name Moritz. "Do you not remember [Ju cancelled ] Justine [Martin? cancelled ] ˄Moritz˄?" (p. 90; cf. Rieger 60.8), Elizabeth asks Frankenstein in a letter, before going on to recount Justine's history including "the death of [her father] M. [Martin cancelled ] ˄Moritz˄" (p. 90; Rieger 60.11). Shortly afterwards there is a reference to "Mad[.] Martin" (p. 93; cf. Rieger 61.28 — 29: "Madame Moritz") but here "Martin" has not been deleted and "Moritz" has not been inserted. As for a likely source, Emily Sunstein notes, "The names Moritz and Krempe, Victor's professors, and Victor's subsequent trip to England are drawn from the travel book by Carl Moritz that she had previously read" (340 n33). Mary's reading list for 1816 includes "X Moritz' tour in England," her "X" indicating that Percy also read the book ( Journals I: 93). She is referring to Reisen eines Deutschen in England im Jahr 1782 (1783) by Carl Philipp Moritz, translated "by a lady" as Travels, Chiefly on Foot, through Several Parts of England in 1782 (1795). The nearest name to Krempe in the book is a "Mr. Kampe," who runs a German educational academy (Moritz 77). Near the conclusion of Elizabeth's Justine letter occurs the following concentrated passage with its two name changes: [Miss Mansfeld. cancelled ] Now, dear Victor I daresay [I cancelled ] you wish to be indulged in a little gossip about your acquaintance [ the 1818 text: concerning the good people of Geneva]. The pretty Miss Mansfeld [Mansfield in the 1818 text ] has already received [on her cancelled ] the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John [Mebourne cancelled ] Melbourne Esq. Her ugly sister Manon married M. Hofland [Duvillard in the 1818 text; a German to French revision ] the rich banker last autumn. (Pp. 93 — cf. Rieger 62.7 — 12) The last of these names may be traced to Mary's biography. While at the Maison Chapuis, Mary and Percy hired a Swiss nursemaid named Louise Duvillard, whom they called Elisa (see Sunstein, "Louise Duvillard" 27 — 30; Letters I: 36, 37 n9; and Journals I: 201 n1, where an "i" is [mistakenly?] added to the surname of her parents: "M. and Mme Jean Duvilliard"). Her first name, "Louise," seems to have simultaneously migrated to the immediately preceding reference to little William's favourite girlfriend "Louisa [is cancelled ] [tab cancelled ] Biron" (p. 93; cf. Rieger 62.5) and to the immediately following reference to "Louis Manoir": "Your favourite schoolfellow Louis Manoir [ma cancelled ] has suffered several misfortunes [d cancelled ] since the departure of Clerval from Geneva [b (?) cancelled ][.] But he has [atready cancelled ] already recovered his spirits, and he [ is ] reported to [m cancelled ] be on the point of marrying a very lively pretty french woman — Mad. Tavernier" (p. 94; cf. Rieger 62.12 — 16). A Tavernier, an agent of Percy's friend, Thomas Hookham, according to R. Glynn Grylls' pioneering biography (33 n1), was a Paris banker or money lender who lent Shelley £60 see ( Journals I: 9 and 9 n3, 10 — 11, 28; and Sunstein 85). The most extraordinary altered name also occurs in Part A of the Last Draft. Regarding the accusation of murder levelled at Justine, Frankenstein's remaining brother, Ernest, observes that "[Myrtella will cancelled ] Elizabeth will [the replacement appears in the margin] not be convinced notwithstanding all the evidence" (p. 117; cf. Rieger 74.16 — 17). The strange alternate name for Frankenstein's betrothed occurs on only one other occasion in the Last Draft — again in Part A: "At eight in the evening we arrived at Chamounix. [Myrtella cancelled ] ˄My father &amp; Elizabeth were˄ very fatigued" (p. 148; cf. Rieger 90.28 — 29). It seems clear that on both occasions the alternate name was quickly cancelled. Lemprière's Classical Dictionary of Proper Names describes a "Myrtăle" as "a courtesan of Rome, mistress to the poet Horace," and gives Horace's Odes I, number 33 ("Albi, ne doleas"), as the only source (394). Apparently the name Myrtăle, "derived from the myrtle's association with Aphrodite", was "often borne by freedwomen" (Nisbet and Hubbard 375). Ode I.33 consoles the poet Albius Tibyllus on the loss of a mistress who had deserted him; in its fourth and last verse Horace proffers the experience of his own recovery from a similar loss: I, when a better love came after me, Was bound by Myrtal[e], once a slave, now free, More lively than are all the waves that strike Calabria from the Adriatic sea. [ Collected Works 29] In this translation, Lord Dunsany has anglicized the Latin "Myrtăle" by clipping off the final "e". In her journal Mary includes Horace's Odes in her reading list for 1816, and specifically mentions reading them in Bath on 3 and 5 December 1816 (I: 97; I: 148, 149); that is to say she was reading the Odes while writing the Last Draft of Frankenstein . But why — since "Myrtella" clearly is Mary's phonetic equivalent of "Myrtăle" — was she so struck by this single reference to Horace's ex-mistress? Did she in some way relate the relationship between Horace and Myrtăle to what she might have seen as the precarious relationship between Percy and herself (and hence to that between Frankenstein and Elizabeth)? At the same time, various aspects of Horace's personality might have seemed relevant to what Mary saw herself advocating in Frankenstein : Horace's enthusiasm as a young man for republican ideas and the delight he expresses in his poetry for the simple life, the beauties of nature, and the joys of friendship. The two surprising appearances of "Myrtella" recall the two equally bewildering occurrences of both "Carignan" and "Amina." Was Mary once more absent-mindedly copying a superseded name from a preliminary rough draft? Was there, then, a version of Frankenstein in which Frankenstein's friend was called Carignan, the cousin he married Myrtella, and Felix's fiancée Amina?</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I am grateful to Lord Abinger for his kind permission to publish quotations from the Frankenstein manuscripts and to publish the photographs of two manuscript leaves that accompany this article. The discoveries made in the course of researching this material and writing this article would not have been possible without my previously making a diplomatic transcription of the entire Frankenstein manuscripts from the originals in the Bodleian Library — apparently the first such transcription ever made. I wish to express my thanks to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for a Research Grant which facilitated that work. 2 My description of the physical aspects of the Frankenstein manuscripts is much indebted to an unpublished report entitled "The Frankenstein Notebooks: Technical Notes, Watermarks and Collations" (23 December 1993) and its significant revision (dated 7 February 1995) by Bruce C. Barker-Benfield, Senior Assistant Librarian at the Bodleian Library's Department of Western Manuscripts. I am also grateful to Dr. Barker-Benfield for the very careful reading he gave a version of this article. In addition, I am much indebted to Charles E. Robinson who also read the same earlier version with a vigilant eye. I consequently modified several of my arguments. Barker-Benfield's report will be incorporated into the Introduction to Robinson's facsimile edition of the Frankenstein manuscripts which is forthcoming from Garland Publishing, Inc. 3 The fifteen Volume I chapters of the Last Draft correspond to the 1818 Volume One, chapters I — VII, and Volume Two, chapters I — II, as follows: Last Draft 1818 Edition "Chap. 1" [not extant] Presumably equivalent to the four prefatory letters of the frame narrator Walton "Chap. [1 cancelled ?] 2" [⅔ extant?] Chap. I: approximately last ⅔, starting at 30.13 Chap. [2 cancelled ] 3 Chap. II: beginning through 40.17 ("as I pleased.") Chap. 4 Chap. II: 40.18 ("The next morning") to end Chap. 5 Chap. III: beginning through 48.18 ("his nature will allow.") Chap. 6 Chap. III: 48.19 ("When I found") to end Chap. 7 1 Chap. IV: beginning to 57.3 ("a long, long time.") Chap. 7 2 Chap. IV: 57.4 ("This was the commencement") to end Chap. V: beginning through 62.31 ("leave my chamber.") Chap. 8 Chap. V: 62.32 ("One of my first duties") to end Chap. 9 Chap. VI: beginning through 70.21 ("I was destined to endure.") Chap. 10 Chap. VI: 70.22 ("It was completely dark"; manuscript page 111 begins with the variant "Night had closed ˄in˄") through 75.25 ("an evil result.") Chap. 11 Chap. VI: ("We were soon") to end Chap. VII: beginning through 80.33 ("Justine was condemned.") Chap. 12 Chap. VII: 80.35 ("I cannot pretend" to end (and end of Volume One) Chap. 13 Chap. I of Volume Two Chap. 14 Chap. II of Volume Two Draft "Chapter 2" above includes insert material that I label Part A1. Because Chapter 3 above was the original Chapter 2 and the number change was made in different ink, i.e., after the chapter was written, we cannot be sure about the extent of the original "Chapter 1." It may have corresponded to the 1818 Chapter I. In other words, the opening Walton frame material may have been written, or conceived, at the time when the original Chapter 2 was changed to 3 and an original "Chapter 1" was changed to "2." Perhaps the closing frame material was written, or conceived, around the same time. Alternatively an original long "Chapter 1" may have been divided into two chapters, or, as seems to be the case with the two chapters numbered 7, Mary may have accidentally numbered two chapters Chapter 2. 4 (Last Draft Volume II and the Fair Copy were foliated by Barker-Benfield on 31 January 1995.) Evidence that Mary had the relevant portion of Part A before her (or at least some memory of it) when she was drafting the A1 insert is provided by the following cancelled paragraph fragment in the insert: "When I was about fifteen my f" (f. 2 v ). This fragment corresponds to this paragraph-opening in Part A: "When I was about [twelve cancelled ] ˄fourteen˄ years old we . . ." (p. 43). As it appears in 1818, the Part A paragraph separates Part A1 into two inserts; the 1818 version begins, "When I was about fifteen years old, we . . ." (Rieger 35.3). The cancelled paragraph fragment in A1 appears, in relation to its intervening placement in 1818, a couple of paragraphs prematurely. 5 The opening two-and-a-fragment Volume II chapters of the Last Draft correspond to the 1818 Volume Two, chapters III and IV, as follows: Last Draft 1818 Edition Chap. 1 Chap. III: beginning through 102.5 ("the barbarity of man.") Chap. 2 Chap. III: 102.6 ("As soon as morning dawned") to end Chap. IV: beginning through 106.18 ("at first enigmatic." Or "igmmatic" as Mary wrote on her p. 17, prompting Percy to comment in the margin, "you pretty Pecksie!" with the same pencil that he earlier noted [p. 11]: "This chapter is too short") Chap. 3 [fragment] Chap. IV: 106.19 ("A considerable period"; a revision of the manuscript page 17 "It was sometime") through 109.8 ("was that possible,"). 6 For the benefit of the reader who, with Rieger's edition in hand, wishes to have a clearer conception of exactly what material constitutes Part C r , the following correspondences occur between the manuscript and the 1818 edition of Frankenstein : Two bifolia from the same quire : a recto numbered 57 (here 57 A : a cancelled page containing a previous version of 57 B /58 below) ("Some time elapsed . . . who loaded with") 177.17 — 118.18; its unnumbered verso ([cancelled passage continues for four more lines] "chains expected . . . . in his favour" [then a continuation number "59" in the margin on the next line indicating the start of the passage "59" — 63 verso to be inserted after a separating line on the recto below numbered 59] "[For cancelled ] During the ensueing days . . . . high &amp; enthusiastic"): 118.18 — 118.21, 118.34 — 119.16. a recto numbered 60 ("terms of her mother . . . . who aided the"): 119.16 — 119.33; its verso numbered 61 ("deceit by quitting . . . . which he ˄should˄"): 119.33 — 120.21 a recto numbered 62 ("be enabled to . . . . deprived them"): 120.21 — 121.5; blank verso a blank recto; its verso numbered 63 ("of their fortune . . . . deprived of his wealth"): 121.5 — 121.24 [end of insert] Central bifolium of the same quire : a recto numbered 57 (here 57 B ) ("[ next two words in Percy's hand ] another Chapter [/] Sometime elapsed . . . [his condemnation rather cancelled ]"): 117.17 — 118.11; its verso numbered 58 ("rather [ in the margin ] than the crime . . . . had made on"): 118.10 — 118.29 a recto numbered 59 ("[ the ] heart of Felix . . . . intentions and" [Mary draws a short separating line here to indicate that continuation number "64" material begins below it after the "59" — 63 material above has been inserted] "64" [in the margin] "and rank . . . . to convey him"): 118.29 — 118.33, 121.24 — 122.2; its unnumbered verso ("to [Can cancelled ] Constantinople . . . . at Leghorn." [Continuation number "65" appears in the margin on the next line before the narrative resumes] "[Lef cancelled ] [deserted by her father cancelled ] Safie revolved . . . . unacquainted with the lan"): 122.2 — 122.21 Slip off-white quarter sheet ("guage of the country. . . . of her lover"): 122.22 — 122.27. As for the evidence that all three bifolia originally came from the same quire, Barker-Benfield notes: "pleats at the inner edges of all these leaves, caused either directly by the sewing-thread or by adjacent crumpling, exactly match each other but not those of the leaves from other quires" (8). The identically placed sewing-holes at the inner edges of these six leaves match the placement of those at the inner edges of the other Continental leaves. 7 The watermarked date "1806" appears on the leaves paginated 62 — 73, 90 — 102 (101/102 constitutes half of an intact bifolium), 101/102, 101/102 (repeated), 103/104, 121 — 136, 153 — 168, and 183 — 198. The Britannia watermark appears on the following paginated (and in two cases unpaginated) leaves once conjoined with the "1806" leaves: 74 — 89, unnumbered leaf ["103/104"] (the other half of the intact bifolium), unnumbered leaf ["105/106"], 105 — 120, 137 — 152, 169 — 182, 199 — 203/blank verso. 8 The last thirteen chapters of Volume II of the Last Draft correspond in the 1818 edition to Volume Two, chapters VII — IX, and Volume Three, chapters I — VII, as follows: Last Draft 1818 Edition No heading [the last ½ of "Ch. 6"?] Chap. VII of Volume Two: beginning through 128.6. Chap. 7 Chap. VII: 128.7 to end Chap. VIII: beginning through 133.27 Chap. 8 Chap. VIII: 133.28 to end (there is a cancelled "Chap. 9" heading on manuscript p. 88 of this pp. 79 — 90 chapter) Chap. 9 Chap. IX Chap. 10 Chap. I of Volume Three Chap. [11 deleted ] 2 Chap. II: beginning through 161.2 Chap. 12 Chap. II: 161.2 to end Chap. III: beginning through 166.4 (at the point where Chapter III begins, on p. 118 of the Last Draft, Mary penned a self-direction, like the chapter number change above, related to the chapter divisions of the 1818 edition: "Finish Chap. 2 here-") Chap. 13 Chap. III: 166.5 to end Chap. 14 Chap. IV: beginning through 178.26 Chap. 15 Chap. IV: 178.27 to end Chap. V: beginning through 185.32 Chap. 16 Chap. V: 185.33 to end Chap. 17 Chap. VI Chap. 18 Chap. VII 9 The top half of the posthorn watermark appears on leaves paginated 99 — 100 and 105 — 114; the bottom on leaves paginated 115 — 138. In counting "all told five watermarks" on the Dep. c. 534 leaves, E. B. Murray must have misconstrued these halves of a single watermark as two distinct watermarks. "One of the watermarks" he remarks "looks — deceptively? — like an intertwined 'L.B.'" (50 n1). Deceptively indeed — as I indicate, the letters depending from the bottom half of the oval emblem are in fact "P &amp; S". The watermarked firm name "PHIPPS &amp; SON" appears on leaves 139/140, 143/144, and 153 — 156; the watermarked date "1809" on Mary's leaf 167/168 and on Percy's leaves 175 — 186 A ; and the watermarked date "1814" appears on Percy's last leaf, 187/blank verso. 10 The five gaps (lost leaves 6 — 7 of the first putative notebook [the opening leaves 1 — 4 of which are also missing] and lost leaves 2, 4 — 7, 10 — 14, and 16 — 18 of the second) are as follows: pp. 101 — 104 (Rieger 186.16 ["into my heart"] — 187.30); pp. 141 — 142 (Rieger 202.15 ["ioned by heaven"] — 203.9 ["was in these"]); pp. 145 — 152 (Rieger 203.34 ["of the inhabitants"] — 206.28); pp. 157 — 166 (Rieger 208.15 ["ension. His"] — 212.11 ["You were"]); and pp. 169 — 174 (Rieger 213.9 ["he was sunk"] — 215.16 ["But the con"]). 11 Mary's journal entry "Finish transcribing" on 13 May 1817 (I: 169) might be taken (if read as Mary speaking for herself alone, and not, as here seems most probable, for herself and Percy) as evidence that she had finished a transcription of the Last Draft additional to the surviving Fair Copy which Percy concluded. Were there, then, two fair copies, or a fair copy segment which duplicated all of Percy's segment of the extant Fair Copy? It seems much more likely that the portion of the surviving Fair Copy in Mary's hand which duplicates Percy's (my Part DPM) is the remnant of a sequence which was intended to replace the carelessly scissored concluding pages (resulting in mutilated text), and that it came to include Percy's last page which was not affected by careless scissoring. Does Mary's "Finish transcribing" apply, then, to her finishing those duplicate pages? Probably not if one understands an ambiguous and apparently anomalous journal entry five months after the one just quoted and over two months before the publication of Frankenstein , as applying to that work. The entry for 15 (an error for 23) October 1817 includes the notation (confirmed by an examination of the actual journal in the Bodleian) "[write cancelled ] translate F" (I: 182). "F" is Mary's frequent abbreviation for Frankenstein and "translate" might best be interpreted, especially in the context of the preceding, presumably less precise, cancelled word, as "transfer." It seems reasonable to conclude, then, that the duplicate pages (which I am assuming the printer used rather than Percy's impaired Fair Copy pages) were created by an act of transference from one transcription to another on 23 October 1817. 12 James Rieger's ingenious argument that Mary's inspirational vision followed "a conversation about principles" which John Polidori, Byron's physician, records as taking place between himself and Byron on 15 June 1816 ( Diary 123), and which thus possibly predated Byron's proposal of a ghost-story compact, has been undermined by several critics (see Walling 30, Joseph 225 — 226, Ketterer 79 — 80, Clubbe 102 — 106, Sunstein 429 n16). 13 See the third part of Mary Shelley (with Percy Shelley), History of a Six Weeks' Tour (1817). Clubbe argues for 20 or 21 June 1816 as the starting date of Frankenstein . The strongest evidence that Mary's waking vision occurred before 22 June is provided by her letter of 10 November 1824 to John Cam Hobhouse regarding details in the proofs of Hobhouse's pamphlet "Exposure of the Mis-statements Contained in Captain Medwin's Pretended 'Conversations of Lord Byron'" (published in 1825): "the Preface to Frankenstein [ by Percy Shelley ] proves [ it, in fact, does not; this letter, and Mary's 1831 Introduction, must suffice ] that that story was conceived before Lord Byron's and Shelley's tour round the lake . . ." ( Letters I: 455). If Clubbe and I are correct, Polidori's diary entry for 17 June 1816 — "The ghost-stories are begun by all but me" ( Diary 125) — either does not take account of Mary Shelley's similar situation or it implies a story that she abandoned (the same alternatives would also apply to Percy Shelley). 14 Emily Sunstein suggests that "Justine was created as a tribute to Fanny" Imlay (430 n33). 15 Mary's art teacher was "Possibly John West (1772 — 1833), miniature painter and drawing master, who lived in Bath from at least 1795 to 1833" ( Letters I: 23 n3). 16 If the statement "write Preface" is not a mistake for "writes Preface," it could be understood as either "I write the Preface" or "Shelley and I write the Preface" — in which case Mary's statement in her 1831 Introduction that "As far as I can recollect, it was entirely written by him" (Rieger 229) is misleading. See Hunt 148. 17 Account should also be taken of the references to "work" in Mary's journal during the period of Frankenstein 's creation. The term would seem to cover "literary work," no doubt including work on Frankenstein . The "work" dates (with the "work" and "write" days asterisked) are as follows: 11, 13, 14, 16*, 18, 26, 28 September; 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 19*, 22* October; 2*, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15*, 17, 18*, 19, 24*, 27* November; 2*, 6*, 7*, 9* December 1816; and 4*, 7*, 8*, 10*, 11, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23 January 1817 ( Journals I: 135 — 137, 139 — 140, 142, 144 — 149, 153 — 155). 18 No doubt because the point is so obvious, it seems not to have been made in print until 1979; see Ketterer 41. 19 The five letters from Charles Clairmont that Jane, Lady Shelley, includes in Volume I of the four-volume Shelley and Mary (1822), her intermixture of letters and Mary's journals, give a good impression of his amiable character and suggest a number of connections with Frankenstein . Clerval and Frankenstein's time in Oxford seems to have been anticipated by a trip that Charles Clairmont made with Percy, Mary, and Thomas Love Peacock. In a letter to his sister Jane dated 16 September 1815 at Percy and Mary's house in Bishopgate, Charles writes: "We visited the very rooms where the two noted infidels, Shelley and Hogg (now, happily excluded the society of the present residents), pored, with the incessant and unwearied application of the alchymist, over the certified and natural boundaries of human knowledge" ( Shelley and Mary I: 85). The passionate regard for nature that Clerval is described as exhibiting in the latter part of Chapter I of Volume Three (cf. Chapter 10 of Volume II of the Last Draft) is the very echo of the regard that Charles Clairmont expresses in four letters that are reproduced from the period he lived in Bagneres de Bigorre, Hautes Pyrénées. In his eloquent lengthy letter to Percy and Mary of 8 August 1816 ( Shelley and Mary I: 114 — 127), after referring to a letter received from Mary dated 28 June 1816 (not in the Letters ) and his plan to spend time in Spain, Italy, and Germany (specifying Frankfort and Frankenstein's university town, "Ingolstad") to learn the languages (noting his intended focus on Spanish, "a more commercial language" than Italian), he embarks on an extended euphoric description of his mountainous environment. A cavern in a mountain is likened to the jaws of a "monstrous animal" but it is his emotions during a solitary ascent of another mountain (following the exhaustion of his American friend Lovell) which most explicitly parallel elements in Frankenstein : "I am convinced that the first idea of a heaven was occasioned by the sensations experienced while on the top of some mountain, while alienated from everything but nature in its veriest wildness . . . . I spent perhaps the three most delightful hours of my life in this situation" ( Shelley and Mary I: 125). Looking up at another cloudless blue sky, Clerval "felt as if he had been transported to fairy land" (Vol. II, p. 104; cf. Rieger 153.2 — 3). Charles' letter concludes with an account of his experience of nature's power to induce the recollection, often melancholy, of past happy times. The first of three paragraphs, not in the Last Draft, which provide a hindsight eulogy for the soon-to-be-deceased Clerval ends with a quotation from Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey," the work of a poet who best epitomizes Charles Clairmont's and Henry Clerval's sensibility. In his letter to Percy dated 26 January 1817, Charles declares: "I should choose beyond everything else in the world the life of Wordsworth . . ." ( Shelley and Mary I: 188). This third letter from Bagneres was preceded by another lengthy one (albeit incomplete) dated 18 November 1816 in which he suggests that Percy and Mary come to Bagneres: "you might live another Julie and another Wolmar [from Rousseau's Julie, ou la Nouvelle Héloïse , 1761]" ( Shelley and Mary I: 160 — 161). Charles Clairmont's final reproduced letter from Bagneres, dated 9 August 1817 and addressed to Mary, includes the following: "You say nothing more of your Novel. Do not neglect it on my account, and send me one of the first copies" ( Shelley and Mary I: 215). To compensate for the addition of the three paragraph, reader-response-priming encomium to Clerval, and to avoid dwelling on anticlimactic scenery, a paragraph in the Last Draft describing the plains of Holland (II: 106 — 107) is reduced in the 1818 text to one sentence (Rieger 154.26 — 28). A version of the last half of that paragraph (about the problems for passing carriages posed by narrow roads between canals) appears in History of a Six Weeks' Tour (Shelley, Mary, with Percy, 76 — 77). 20 I do not believe that much can be made of the two instances of the name "Carignan." There are no references to any Carignans in Mary Shelley's letters or journals and indeed no Carignans in what is known of her biography, but Carignan is a relatively common French name. Its derivation (from the gallo-roman "Carenus" plus the suffix "anum") is obscure until 1662 when Maurice, Count of Soissons, of the Carignana (Piémont) branch of the House of Savoie, became Prince of Carignan (see Rostaing). Carignan is also the name of a village in the Ardennes near Spain. In fact, both Carignan and Clerval are French place names. (Clerval is about ninety miles north of Geneva.) Is it possible then that Mary simply randomly alighted on the place name Carignan for a character, perhaps by way of association because of its similarity to Caroline, the first name of Frankenstein's mother? Caroline Beaufort (also surnamed for a French place name?) is introduced just seven paragraphs before Clerval in the 1818 edition. Did Mary then substitute the place name Clerval (with its surely inevitable association in her mind with Clairmont) in order to obliterate the Caroline/Carignan echo? And are the subsequent vacillations in Part D between Clairval and Clerval simply confused indications of the parallels in Mary's mind between the names Clerval and Clairmont, confused indications augmented by further French place names such as Clermont, Clermont-en-Argonne, Clermont-Ferand, Clermont-Hérault, and Clairvaux? Certainly speculation along these lines could account for the peculiar order Carignan, Clerval, and Clairval. Finally, allowance should also be made for the influence of the name "Clermont" as in Mary Anne Clermont, Lady Byron's governor and confident. Lord Byron blamed Mary Anne Clermont for the destruction of his marriage. 21 The description of this situation in the Last Draft includes a couple of details which were subsequently altered. Mary's original idea that the monster would hide in "the tool house" (p. 8; originally at Rieger 101.14) adjoining the De Lacey cottage was deleted and converted into a hut. Since there are several references to Felix carrying tools or fetching tools (p. 11 [Rieger 103.10], p. 13 [Rieger 104.28], p. 18 [Rieger 107.6]), the monster would have been quickly discovered in Mary's first location. As for the other detail, at one point the monster says of Felix that "the youth mounted on a large strange animal [road cancelled ] rode away" (p. 15). The corresponding portion of the 1818 text reads: "the youth departed after the first meal" (Rieger 105.23). Either Mary or Percy subsequently realized that the possession of a horse would conflict with the De Lacey's state of "poverty" (p. 17; Rieger 106.20). 22 The fifth "Maimouna cancelled ] ˄Safie˄" instance follows Felix's only and (given the sense in the later written material that Felix and Safie are not yet married) perhaps premature reference to Safie as "My wife" (p. 80; Shelley 134.16; unchanged in the 1831 edition). Alternatively, this "mistake" may relate to a draft of the Felix/Safie material that is now lost. 23 Not to be included among the significant name variants, it might be noted that, in Part D of the Last Draft, Mary misspells the name of Walton's sister (the person to whom his four letters, his transcription of Frankenstein's narrative, and Walton's journalstyle " continuation " [Rieger 206.9] are addressed). Mary consistently uses the form "Margeret" (p. 184, cf. Rieger 206.31; p. 189, cf. Rieger 210.15; p. 190 ["my dear Margeret" omitted at Rieger 211.7]; and p. 196, cf. Rieger 216.4). In the first and last instances the error is corrected, the "e" has been amended into an "a." The same misspelling crops up in Mary's Part DM of the Fair Copy (p. 153; cf. Rieger 206.31); Percy in his Part DP writes the correct form "Margaret" (p. 176; Rieger 216.4). 24 Arithmetical calculations, generally in the margin and mainly in Volume I of the Last Draft, could be references to preliminary rough draft segments (from which Mary was working while writing the surviving Last Draft), segments which were each page numbered separately. Thus, on page 81 of Volume I, the numbers "104," "52," and "24" are added up to make a total of "180." On page 102 of the same volume, at the end of Chapter 8, the number "20" appears, and below it the number "15." On page 137 of the same volume, at the end of Chapter 12, "37" is added to "20" to make a total of "57." On page 152, also of Volume I, "126" appears to be amended to "120" and "130" to "136," before both numbers were deleted. All the above calculations appear to be in Percy's hand. The most teasing calculations, because the most detailed, appear on page 62 of Volume II, the first surviving page of the British notebook in which Part D was written. There are two sets of calculations, both in the margin. The more interesting of these appears to be in Mary's hand: "66" altered to "62" is subtracted from "98" leaving "36"; a second "36" is added to this result making a total of "72"; "97" is then added to that total making an overall total of "169." Since these calculations appear, after the page was written on, on page 62 (with the "2" blotted so that it looks like a "6" or blotted while being altered to a "6") and since the first two lines of that page — a continuation of previous material — have been deleted and that previous material is now lost because no previous leaves continuous with Part D (whether or not of the same English paper) have survived, it might be hypothesized that the "62" as amended refers to 62 pages which have been cancelled (i.e., the previous 61 pages plus the two lines at the head of page 62). It might further be hypothesized that, at a point of drafting around page 98 of Volume II (which is the beginning of the substantially revised Chapter 10, the chapter where Percy suggested a significant change regarding Frankenstein's trip to England), the decision to eliminate those 62 pages was made. Consequently, "62" is subtracted from "98," and the numbers added (relating to preliminary rough drafts?) are an attempt to calculate the new approximate length of Volume II of the Last Draft once the pages beyond 98 have been written. Above these calculations are another set of calculations which are in Percy's hand and which include the total "191." This might be a similar attempt to calculate the number of pages of the yet-to-be-redrafted Volume I. The calculations include the number "36," possibly related to the "36" that resulted from the subtraction in Mary's calculations. An alternative and perhaps more compelling possibility would be to relate the three totals — "180," "169," and "191" — to the page totals of the three Fair Copy volumes, or to those of the three published 1818 volumes. The proportional differences between the figures as here ordered are close to the proportional differences between the page totals of the 1818 volumes: 181, 156, and 192. The discrepancy between "169" and the 156 pages of Volume Two could be accounted for by supposing that some portion of the apparently missing thirty-six pages between the end of Part B of the Last Draft and the beginning of Part C was cut (with the result that the corresponding published text is much shorter). As for the corresponding page totals of the three Fair Copy volumes, the only one we know about — the 187 pages of Volume Three — is close to Percy's "191" total. It should further be noted that page 137 of Volume I of the Last Draft (see the first paragraph of this footnote) became the final page of Volume One of the 1818 edition, and that page 98 of Volume II (see the second paragraph of this footnote) became the first page of Volume Three. 25 Mary notes reading Locke on the following dates: 18 — 27, 29, and 30 November; 1 — 3, 5, 10, 12, 13, and 16 — 31 December 1816 (the last being a synoptic entry); and 6 and 8 January 1817. This could imply that the Last Draft version of the monster's narrative — [B — C], [C], and C r — was written, and re-written in the case of C r , between the end of November 1816 and 10 January 1817 (after which date Mary does not appear to have engaged in any further writing of her novel for well over two months). In one of the gaps in her reading of Locke — 6 — 9 December 1816 — Mary read her mother's A Vindication of the Rights of Women . This could well be related to her writing or rewriting Safie's story and the story of Safie's mother (a likely portrait of Mary Wollstonecraft) in C r sometime between 6 December 1816 and 10 January 1817. 26 My dating of the Part D material depends, of course, on the assumption that, since it was written in a notebook containing British paper, that paper was obtained following the return to England. That assumption may be incorrect. While on the Continent, Mary may already have possessed, or at some point acquired, that notebook. If that were the case, the nine "translate" entries in her journal for the periods 7 — 12, 14 — 16 August 1816 assume unusual interest ( Journals I: 123 — 126). If she is referring to a job of translating an extended piece from one language to another, it is strange that she gives no title (something she normally does in such circumstances). Is this then another instance, like her entry for 15 (actually 23) October 1817 (see footnote 11 above), where "translate" may mean "transfer"? If so, 7 — 16 August 1816 may well be the period when Mary began transferring rough draft material into Last Draft material, whether onto British notebook paper — the last portion of which survives as Part D — or onto paper now lost. It should be noted that there are references to Mary writing during this period (presumably a, or the, rough draft of Frankenstein ) on 7, 9, 12, and 16 August. The entries for 9 August and 12 August link the acts of writing and "translating": "Write and translate"; "Write my story and translate" ( Journals I: 123, 124). The two activities could, then, be understood as both applying to Frankenstein . If this were the case, it must be assumed that, at least over certain periods, the writing of rough draft material and the "translation" involved in writing the Last Draft were proceeding more or less concurrently. In terms of attempts to establish a chronology of composition, the conclusion would seem to be that cogent arguments can be made for Mary's beginning the Last Draft either on 7 August 1816 or on some finally unprovable date after her return to England one month later. 27 Parallels between descriptive details in Mary's journal or letters and the Last Draft of Frankenstein cannot be used to conclusively date the writing of any portion of that draft but one parallel between a journal entry and a detail in Part D of the draft is at least consistent with an early completion date for that portion of Part D. In her journal entry for 26 July 1816 Mary observes that "in the autumn" the men of the Chamounix region "hunt the Chamois — an occupation they delight in — they think themselves lucky if they kill three in the season which they are glad to sell for 4 or 5 [louis cancelled ] francs — and if they cannot they eat it themselves — " ( Journals I: 120). In Part D of the Last Draft, Frankenstein speculates that if the monster "has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the chamois &amp; destroyed as a beast of prey" (p. 171; Rieger 197.31 — 32). 28 While evidence of last stage patching is most apparent in Part C r , there is one Part D "patch" that is datable to April 1817. An insert slip once pinned on page 98 (corresponding to Shelley 147.5 ["I found"] — 147.12 ["tranquillity."]) is written on the recto of the lower part of the address leaf of a letter from William Godwin to Mary Shelley which is postmarked "9[?] [A]P.[rill] [1]817" (see Barker-Benfield 13). This Volume II, Chapter 10 insert anticipates Frankenstein's journey to England to "compose a female" (added slip; Rieger 147.5) and is related to the same Chapter 10 revision material (written some months earlier?) which was prompted by Percy's suggestion that Frankenstein propose the trip. It is possible that the insert passage on the address leaf slip, composed between 10 — 17 April, when Mary was correcting Frankenstein , was the last sustained new passage that Mary added to her manuscript. 29 In an insightful article Joyce Zonana provides the other side — the feminist side — of the Oriental issue in Frankenstein . She argues that, with the story of Safie and her mother, Mary Shelley appropriated Mary Wollstonecraft's negative example, in A Vindication of the Rights of Women (1792), of the way in which the followers of Muhammad abused women. In other words, Mary subscribed to her mother's prejudicial conception of Oriental otherness. It should be stressed, however, that the dynamic operating throughout Frankenstein , also applies here: the Other becomes the Self. 30 Robert Southey's orientalist epic poems Thalaba the Destroyer (1801) and The Curse of Kehama (1810) have recently been proposed as additional sources of Frankenstein . See Majeed 73 — 75. Both of Southey's titles figure in Mary's and Percy's reading for 1814 ( Journals I: 85; see also I: 28, 29, and I: 26 — 27). Charles Robinson notes the existence in the Abinger Deposit of what may be an oriental work by Mary Shelley, "an unfinished manuscript, entitled 'The Caravanserail; or, A Collection of Eastern Stories,' consisting of an introductory frame and 'Tale I — Abdelazi; or, The New Sleeper awakened.' This fair-copy manuscript appears to be a transcription by someone other than Mary Shelley, and it is therefore impossible, without other evidence, to determine if she was the author" (Shelley Tales , xix n12). 31 According to Donald Reiman, work on Laon and Cythna began in March 1817 when the Shelleys took up residence in Albion House in Marlow. 32 Leonard Wolf notes the "hint at a fear of incest" (75 n4) in Frankenstein's dream of Elizabeth: "Delighted and surprised, I embraced her; but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel" (Rieger 53.10 — 15; essentially unchanged in the 1831 edition). Wolf goes on to quote Laon's similarly "grisly dream" (76 n4): A woman's shape, now lank and cold and blue, The dwelling of the many-coloured worm, Hung there; the white and hollow cheek I drew To my dry lips — what radiance did inform Those horny eyes? whose was that withered form? Alas, alas! it seemed that Cythna's ghost Laughed in those looks, and that the flesh was warm Within my teeth! . . . ( Complete Poetical Works 151; III: 26, 1333 — 40) Nigel Leask observes that "The question of incest which so fascinated Shelley is really another version of his favorite theme of discovering the Same in the Other, which I have linked on an existential level with Rousseau and on an ideological/philosophical level with [ The Ruins of Empire by Constantin] Volney" (131). This statement occurs in the context of Leask's illuminating account of percy Shelley's orientalist attitudes in The Revolt of Islam : their displacement of his faith in the civilizing influence of British imperialism in India; their debts to Tom Moore's account of an oriental revolution in Lalla Rookh (1817), to Volney's Les Ruines, ou méditations sur les révolutions des empires (1791; English translation, 1792), and to Sydney Owenson's (Lady Morgan's) The Missionary (1811); and their problematic feminism (108 — 118, 130 — 134). Lalla Rookh and The Missionary figure in Mary's reading list for 1817 ( Journals I: 100). Volney's Ruins is not to be found in any of Mary's readings lists but she must have read it given its prominence in Frankenstein . (Felix chooses Volney's Ruins to teach Safie French "because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors" [Rieger 114.27 — 28].) Leask also discusses Robert Southey's The Curse of Kehenna as a source for The Revolt of Islam (95 — 98; see footnote 30 above for the same argument regarding Frankenstein ). 33 Walton's quest for the North Pole co-exists with — or may be subsumed by — his quest for the fabled Northeast Passage to the North Pacific Ocean and India. See Lew 257. 34 In Robert Southey's Thalaba the Destroyer (see footnote 30 above) a character named Maimuna is a comely old woman who turns out to be a sorceress (I am indebted to Kara K. Eadie for this possible name source). Southey may well have here appropriated the name of Muhammad's thirteenth wife; he projected writing in collaboration with Coleridge an eight-book epic poem on the life of Muhammad (although he only completed the famous miracle of the cave and the spider episode). 35 Kara K. Eadie drew my attention to the relevance of the "fair enemy" characterization of Safiyyah. 36 References to Mary as the moon and Percy as the sun recur in their letters and in Percy's poetry, most notably "To the Moon" (1820) and stanza 15 of Epipschidion (1821).

      <field name="fulltext">In his book The Textual Condition , Jerome McGann claims that John Rodker, the printer of Ezra Pound's Hugh Selwyn Mauberley (April-June 1920), possessed at least six decorated initial Ts made by the artist Edward Wadsworth. 1 According to McGann, we can deduce that Rodker possessed six Ts because his edition of T. S. Eliot's Ara Vos Prec (December 1919 — February 1920) displays six decorated initial Ts. 2 From this supposed fact, McGann goes on to argue that since Rodker possessed six Ts, and Mauberley only required six decorated initial Ts, 3 Pound deliberately chose not to use a decorated initial T on page 16 of Mauberley . McGann supplements this argument with evidence from proof sheets of the edition held in the Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas. In the margin of page 13 of these proofs, Pound wrote, "Supply of Ts ran out" and instructed Rodker to use a plain or italic capital T, because "The old printers did this when fancy capitals ran out" (cited in McGann, 158). On the basis of the Eliot edition evidence, McGann believes that Pound was incorrect in his assumption that Rodker had exhausted his supply of decorated initial Ts. Instead, McGann interprets Pound's advice to follow the style of the "old printers" as a typographical historical allusion. One of the commentators in McGann's dialogue, which surrounds the Pound analysis, summarizes the argument in these words: the fact is that the text could have had a decorated T on this page [16], that the "supply of Ts" had not in fact run out. The italic T is thereby made into an allusion to another (historical) fact about the practice of "old printers"; and that allusion serves as a factive synecdoche for the larger memorial acts which Hugh Selwyn Mauberley carries out. In the end, the italic T may well come to stand as an index of the way Pound's work, and poetry in general, makes its escape from fiction. (172) While I am not certain how poetry escapes from fiction, I am certain that Rodker's six Ts are a fiction, that Pound correctly understood the shortage of Ts, and that a cursory study of the Eliot and Pound editions reveals the work of a novice printer whose careless practice led to at least two states of each volume and casts doubt on the accuracy of Rodker's limited edition numbering system. 4 McGann's claim about the six Ts derives from a misconception of the printing process. McGann imagines all the pages of a book set in type at the same time, rather than set as a series of pages arranged in formes. These formes are then used to print sides of sheets, which are subsequently folded and cut to create the final structure of the book. As a result of printing in formes, at any one time a printer need have no more type available than is required to print a single side (though in practice it is often easier to set the type for both formes of a sheet). The table below indicates by sheet, forme, siglum, and page number the locations of the initial Ts in Rodker's editions: Hugh Selwyn Mauberley 5 8°: A — B 8 Inner Outer A 5 v (10) 6 v (12) 6 r (11) 7 r (13) 8 v (16) B 3 v (22) Ara Vos Prec 4° A 4 B 4 C — D 4 E — G 4 Inner Outer C 3 v (22) D 3 v (30) F 2 r (43) 3 r (45) 4 v (48) G 3 r (53) Because Eliot's book is in quarto format and there are thus fewer pages per side of a sheet, his volume requires no more than two decorated initial Ts to print. Pound's volume, on the other hand, is in a smaller format, increasing the likelihood the printer will need more than two Ts to print one side of a sheet. A quick glance at the table for the outer forme of sheet A shows the difficulty Rodker encountered — Mauberley needed three decorated initial Ts on the same side of a sheet. Pound understood that Rodker only possessed two initial Ts, and so suggested the italic substitute. In addition to this negative evidence that Rodker never used more than two decorated initial Ts on a single side, there is also more positive evidence for the existence of two, and only two, initial Ts. One of the initials has a visible gap in the top outside rule of the border, approximately 9 mm from the right edge. This gap appears to vary in length from 1 — 3 mm, due to variation in inking (and possibly to deterioration in the metal, though the gap is present in the earliest version of Eliot's text and does not seem much larger in late copies of the Pound text). I have termed this version the "broken" T and indicated its presence in the table below as T b . The other decorated initial T I have termed "unbroken" because all of its borders are intact. However, it can also be specifically distinguished by the presence of a small uninked circle in the widest band in the lower right quadrant, approximately 7 mm from the right edge and 4 mm from the bottom. Its presence is identified in the table below by the letter T without superscript. Hugh Selwyn Mauberley Inner Outer A 5 v (10) T 6 v (12) T b 6 r (11) T b 7 r (13) T 8 v (16) T B 3 v (22) T b Ara Vos Prec Inner Outer C 3 v (22) T D 3 v (30) T b F 2 r (43) T b 3 r (45) T 4 v (48) T b G 3 r (53) T This table demonstrates that in all instances where two decorated initial Ts appear on a single side, both versions, and no others, are present. 6 So what does it matter how many Ts Rodker had? It matters quite a lot for McGann's argument about Pound's intentions. Most obviously, bibliographical analysis reveals that Pound was correct in his note about running out of Ts. More specifically, and significantly, Pound's knowledge that Rodker possessed only two Ts undermines McGann's supposition that Pound intentionally wished the italic T to appear on page 16: It is important that the italic capital in this case should appear on page 16, because in that position one becomes aware of the character's arbitrary placement. That is to say, in the final printed text the single, undecorated T does not come as the last in the sequence of initial Ts (the last is on page 22), but as the next to last, on page 16. (158) Like Pound, McGann is attempting to supply a rationale to justify a particular bibliographical feature; unlike Pound, McGann is not considering the printing process and so elaborates on Pound's intention to echo the old printers. The argument is logical if one conceives of printing as simply setting the type for all the pages, then printing them. Under such a procedure, were an author to attempt to convey a message by means of the typographic code, that author would no doubt choose to insert an irregularity in some other position than the final position, since the final position would imply that the printer simply ran out of a particular sort and a reader would therefore dismiss a final irregularity as simply a bowing to necessity, rather than as an attempt to convey meaning. Unfortunately, when we reconsider printing as a process of formes and sheets, Rodker's shortage of Ts no longer appears as an attempt to convey meaning; instead the use of the italic T on page 16 (rather than page 22, the final position) represents a bowing to necessity, as Rodker realized he would need three decorated initial Ts on the same side of sheet A. Nonetheless, McGann's research on the Mauberley proofs is instructive, for the data McGann provides can be reinterpreted to show that Rodker was an inexperienced and inaccurate typesetter: at least three of the six initial Ts Pound had planned for his volume appeared as other letters in the proofs. The T expected on page 12 was set as F, on page 13 as L, and on page 16 as some other incorrect letter not specified by McGann (157). While it is possible that Rodker was using the other decorated initials simply as placeholders to avoid having to transfer a limited stock of initial Ts at the proof stage, and though Pound may have understood this practice, Pound still felt obliged to correct the proofs as insurance against future errors. 7 That Pound's vigilance was necessary emerges from a collation of copy #27 of Mauberley against the other copies I have seen. Most notably, the blue ornament on the title-page wanders around inordinately, even overlapping the imprint in one copy (Huntington Library 354201). Equally egregiously, the lower part of the table of contents (from p. 19 to p. 28) has to be reset between the printing of #27 and #63, in order to correct the page numbers. 8 Other changes also appear to be improvements or regularizations, especially of punctuation. 9 The most telling difference, though, is an apparently minor change: on page 12, line 16, the word "age-old" in #27 has the final, correct letter d replaced by an incorrect turned p. The presence of the turned letter further testifies to Rodker's novice status, but more puzzling is why the letter was reset at all. The d would not have been removed for correction, so it seems likely that the entire page, which has had adjustments made to its leading and furniture, may have fallen apart and had to be reset. The furniture and leading of other pages have also been altered, but not in any detectable pattern. 10 Even when he instructs Rodker to follow certain conventions, Pound finds himself stymied. In the HRC proofs Pound requests Rodker to place page "numerals at bottom of the page" (cited in McGann, 156). The numerals instead remain stubbornly at the top outside margins. Given these inaccuracies and irregularities, Pound ought to have been grateful that any of his intentions came through. Evidence of Rodker's inexperience as a printer is not confined to his edition of Mauberley , however. The Library of Congress copy of Eliot's Ara Vos Prec , labelled #9, is a complete jumble — pages of the inner forme of sheet C appear diagonally opposite where they should be (pages 18 and 22 are interchanged, as are 19 and 23), because someone either rotated the forme 180° on the bed of the press between the printing of the inner and outer formes or, more likely, turned the paper incorrectly as the sheet was perfected. The outer forme of sheet G is also marred, but only two pages (49 and 53) are reversed diagonally. 11 Since no other copies, including those numbered 4, 10, and 11, exhibit these errors, we cannot rely on the numbering as a representation of the true order of printing. #9 must almost certainly precede #4 (one of the four printed on vellum), and while we would expect any printer to have made certain the text was accurately arranged before printing on the much more expensive vellum, we would not expect the printer then to bind up his mistakes and pass them off as part of a limited edition, in a false order. 12 This is not to say that Rodker is terribly unethical, only that he was very lax in the way he intermingled sheets from different states and allowed flawed sheets to find their way to market. If McGann's presentation of the evidence is unsound and Rodker's printing habits are undisciplined, what are we to make of Pound's comment regarding the old printers? We should not accept McGann's reference to the use of the italic T as "a deliberate moment of modernist constructivism in the text — a moment which, by breaking from the pattern of decorated capitals, called attention to the book's self-conscious imitation of decorated book production" (156). In light of the bibliographic evidence, we also need to question the extent to which Pound viewed his publishing with Rodker as an engagement with the tradition of decorated book production. McGann's claim, absent the factual evidence of the decorated capital Ts, rests solely upon a marginal comment that may be subject to more than one interpretation. While it is indisputable that Pound described the substitution of an italic T as in keeping with the practice of old printers, the motivation behind the suggestion to use an italic capital may have been less to add meaning to the bibliographic code of his poem and more to offer an intellectual excuse to a friend who was encountering unexpected dilemmas because of his limited range of type and lack of experience as a printer. In other words, rather than being bibliographically allusive Pound may have been attempting to be creatively conciliatory in his suggestion. At the very least, McGann's interpretation of Pound's intention raises the additional problem of that intention being ignored in all subsequent editions. If Pound conceives of his italic T as an essential element of meaning in his bibliographic code, why, in later editions, does he adopt a regular series of undecorated initial Ts instead of retaining his distinctive typesetting pattern? McGann would perhaps argue that later editions do not adhere as closely to the tradition of decorated book production, and so Pound must work within a different set of bibliographic codes and has to sacrifice this particular allusion. Such an argument, however, raises the question of whether the Ovid Press Mauberley does adhere to the fine art tradition. Certainly the book is printed on very reputable paper (Whatman, with four copies on Japan Vellum), but the style of Wadsworth's press icon, decorated capitals, and tailpiece is distinctly modernist, bearing little relation to the styles of previous eras. 13 The cloth binding with paper label is simple and bears little resemblance to bindings by the pre-Raphaelites or other earlier binders. So the allusion of the italic T is not reinforced by most other aspects of the bibliographic code, though Pound could no doubt have offered advice on all of these aspects had he wished to implement a deliberate program. McGann also seems to suppose that Pound chose Rodker as his printer because of Rodker's high standards and artistry: The 1920 Ovid Press edition, by the symbology of its carefully crafted printing, means to comment on the debasement of art and imagination in the contemporary and commerical world of England; and it means to develop its commentary by aligning itself with what it sees as other, less debased cultures. (159 — 160) Perhaps, but the Ovid Press had produced only three books prior to undertaking Mauberley , 14 and fell dormant within the year, having published only eight limited editions. Thus, while Rodker's failure could perhaps be taken as a sign of England's debased taste, it may also have been a result of Rodker's lack of care and talent as a printer and publisher. 15 Furthermore, there is little evidence that Pound chose Rodker over other publishing options. More likely, Rodker deserved support as a friend and represented an opportunity for Pound to publish, thereby benefiting both men. 16 Rodker and Pound may have hoped to achieve high standards, but their artistic desires were thwarted by the difficulties of printing by formes with a limited stock of movable type. Rodker's edition of Mauberley speaks volumes to the analytic bibliographer, but what it reveals neither Rodker nor Pound would have wished to convey to readers. McGann's commentary on Pound's proofs provides some insight into what Pound's own intentions may have been, but also reveals how far short Rodker fell in translating manuscript to print. Ironically, it was McGann's own dictum that critics must consider the production process as an inseparable part of a text's meaning that first drew my attention to these questions and, in this instance, to his errors. McGann's concepts of textual materialism and bibliographic codes provide intriguing new perspectives on authorial intent and reader interpretation, but these concepts must themselves consistently acknowledge, not just exploit, the historical practices they seek to reinstate within the critical horizon. Textual and bibliographic codes result from the interaction of creative intentions and social, technical, and political considerations. This interaction generates both opportunities and limitations, all of which have to be recognized in a fully informed sociology of texts, even if that means turning the Ps and counting the Ts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Jerome McGann, The Textual Condition , Princeton Studies in Culture/Power/History (1991), Chapter 7 passim , especially 154 — 160. The specific comment regarding the number of decorated Ts occurs on 159. Throughout his discussion McGann is careful to refer only to "Rodker's printer," but offers no evidence for the involvement of anyone besides Rodker. G. S. Tomkinson mentions no other person in his description of the Ovid Press, which he describes as "founded in 1919 by Mr. John Rodker. . . . His object in founding it was to learn the technique of printing and to produce the work of his friends" ( A Select Bibliography of the Principal Modern Presses Public and Private in Great Britain and Ireland [1928], 141). The colophons of both Mauberley and Ara Vos Prec state "printed by John Rodker." Finally, J. H. Willis refers to Rodker's "one-man private press" in Leonard and Virginia Woolf as Publishers: The Hogarth Press, 1917 — 41 (1992), 70. Therefore, I have referred to Rodker as the printer, but am quite willing to substitute "Rodker's printer" for Rodker thoughout, should further evidence come to light. For an appreciative summary of Rodker's life, see J. Isaacs' obituary in The Times , 11 October 1955, 11. 2 Due to an error on Eliot's part, the title-page of Rodker's edition reads Ara Vus Prec , but the correct title appears on the binding labels. The full explanation can be found in Donald Gallup's T. S. Eliot: A Bibliography (1952; rev. ed. 1969), 26. 3 McGann actually claims that "according to the design program evidently decided upon, the printer needed five decorated Ts" (158). In fact, as the tables below indicate, Pound's text requires six initial Ts. McGann overlooks the T needed on page 10, perhaps as a result of his dangerous reliance on a "composite set [of proofs] with two pages from an earlier proof" (157), but the logic of his argument holds equally well for six Ts. 4 I have been able to consult the following copies of Rodker's editions: Hugh Selwyn Mauberley: #27 — Huntington Library, Stevens Coll. 440771; #63 — Library of Congress, PS3531.O82H8 Rare Book Coll.; #189 — Houghton Library, *AC9/P8654/920h; out of series — Huntington Library 354201. Ara Vos Prec: #4 — Houghton Library, *fAC9/El464.920a; #9 — Library of Congress, PS3509.L43A69 Rare Book Coll.; #10 — Houghton Library, *fAC9/El464/920aa; #11 — Huntington Library, Stevens Coll. 431654; #109 — Clark Library, Press Coll. Ovid; #145 — Houghton Library, *fAC9/El464/920aab (A). I have listed the texts in order of numbering for convenience; the actual order of production is less certain than the numbers would indicate, as discussed below. 5 This table represents the location of Ts in what I consider the second state of Rodker's edition of Mauberley (copies #63 and higher). See the discussion below for full details. The collation formulae are provided for reference, since Gallup does not include this information in his bibliographies of Eliot (cited above) and Pound ( Ezra Pound: A Bibliography [1983; rev. ed. of A Bibliography of Ezra Pound , 1963], 29 — 30). 6 I can offer no good explanation for why Rodker used the damaged version of the decorated initial T on p. 22 of Mauberley and pp. 30 and 43 of Ara Vos Prec when only one T was required. I suspect he simply did not notice or was not concerned about the damage. 7 If Rodker was using other decorated initials simply as placeholders, the question arises as to why the correct letter appears on p. 22. Its correct placement there may imply that Rodker only had enough type to set a forme at a time, but I do not possess enough evidence to reach a firm conclusion about this matter. 8 Rodker does not appear to have learned from his mistakes, since in Ara Vos Prec (#109) five of the page references are incorrect, two items appear in the wrong order ("Boston Evening Transcript" and "Conversation Galante"), and one item has a variant title ("Rhapsody of a Windy Night" in the table of contents; "Rhapsody on a Windy Night" on p. 45). 9 Some examples of minor changes to punctuation and spacing include: A5 r , l.4 — No, hardly] ˜˄˜ A5 r , l. 17 — events",] ˜," A6 v , l.2 — believing,] ˜, A7 r , l.4 — civilization.] ˜, These typographical changes seem to be confined to sheet A, though B exhibits some changes to margins and some raised spaces (see below). 10 I should caution once more that my hypotheses are based on a very limited number of copies of each text. Altered leading occurs on pages 12 and 13 — on p. 12 the distance between the page number and the top of the decorated initial is increased, while on p. 13 the leading between lines of the poem is reduced; furniture is rearranged to alter the side margins — on p. 13 and p. 27, the text block is moved closer to the gutter, while the text is shifted toward the outer margin on p. 17. All of the copies numbered higher than #27 agree, so far as I have been able to determine without a full mechanical collation, in all cases; the only differences are the presence of raised spaces, which appear and disappear, indicating some looseness in Rodker's justification and perhaps movement of the forme, which might imply that printing took place over more than one occasion. 11 I am unable to suggest a mechanical explanation for this error other than incorrect imposition. 12 Eliot apparently numbered the books himself, as he states in a letter to Rodker (1 Feb. 1920; The Letters of T. S. Eliot, vol. 1 — 1898 — 1922, ed. Valerie Eliot [1988], 360), but he presumably expected Rodker to deliver the books in order for numbering. 13 Nor is Wadsworth's other artistic work, represented in Rodker's sixth book, The Black Country (1920), at all traditional. 14 Rodker's colophon identifies Mauberley as "the third book of the Ovid Press" (29), but both Tomkinson (141) and Will Ransom ( Private Presses and Their Books [1929; rpt. 1976], 373) identify three earlier works. Ransom seems the more carefully documented bibliography, providing dates from the colophons where possible. By his reckoning, Twenty Drawings from the Note-Books of H. Gaudier-Brzeska, Ara Vos Prec , and Hymns. By John Rodker all preceded Mauberley . Because Fifteen Designs. By P. Wyndham Lewis does not bear an exact date, it is not possible to verify Tomkinson's claim that this work was also printed before Pound's poem. 15 While I concur with Robert Beare's description of Rodker's Ara Vos Prec as "an elaborate and . . . badly printed volume," I do not agree that Rodker's work is "rather tasteless" ("Notes on the Text of T. S. Eliot: Variants from Russell Square," Studies in Bibliography 4 [1957], 30). Nonetheless, it is clear that Rodker found the printing of both Eliot's and Pound's work difficult. 16 Willis considers Eliot's use of Rodker "a gesture of friendship to an American compatriot, fellow poet, and beginning printer" (70).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Padraic Colum in The Dublin Magazine by Arthur Sherbo</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alan Denson's "Padraic Colum: An Appreciation with a Check-list of his Publications," published in the new Dublin Magazine (6:1 [1967], 50 — 67), includes a list of the periodicals to which Colum contributed and the years in which those writings appeared. Denson cites 1965 and 1966 for Colum's contributions to The Dublin Magazine , not distinguishing between the original title by that name (1923 — 58) and The Dublin Magazine, formerly The Dubliner (1965 — 74, after 1961 — 64). I wish to serve future students of Colum's work not only by identifying the actual contributions but also by showing that they extended over a much longer period, throughout both the early and late incarnations of the periodical, than has been acknowledged. A number of Colum's writings appeared in the later magazine, under both of its titles. This group began in 1962 ( pace Denson, who lists only 1963 for The Dubliner ) with the essay "Encounters with George Moore" (1:2) [1962], 49 — 55). Colum contributed three poems in 1963 under the title Pictures of Travel : "Indian Chief (Portrait in the University of Kansas City)," "Hula Master (Pacific Island)," and "Young Girl (Indonesia)" (1:6, 44 — 46). The first has not been reprinted; the other two had been published earlier in the Collected Poems of 1953 (hereafter CP ). In 1963 he also provided a short essay, "John O'Leary" (2:2 [1963], 85 — 87). He contributed another article, "Francis Ledwige," in 1964 (3:2, 21 — 24) and a short piece on the poet Thomas Dermody in 1965 (4:3 — 4, 38 — 42). The 1966 publication was the essay "Thomas MacDonagh and His Poetry" (3:1, 39 — 45). He furnished a new poem, "Near Legend," in 1967 (6:2, 64 — 65), too late for Denson's checklist. His contributions to the original Dublin Magazine are far more extensive: they occur in twenty-three of the thirty-six volumes and are fifty-three in number. I list them seriatim, giving volume, issue, year, and page(s); all volume references are to the New Series (which began in 1926), except for the items marked "O. S." O. S. 1:2 (1923), 106. Hawaiian Folk Song . The poem is headed by an explanatory note: "The refrain means 'From the cold,' and it is pronounced 'ee kay annoo, ay.' The title of the poem in the original is 'Poli anu-anu,' 'Breast cold-cold.'" In Poems (1932) Colum adds a footnote in his appended "Notes," describing the translation as of "a little popular song evidently made under European influence — the refrain means 'from the cold'" (p. 214). In 1932 this translation is part II of Hawaii and even here there are revisions (the periodical's readings are listed first): l. 3, O so cold am I / Oh, so cold, I have to say; l. 5, rain / wind; l. 7, Body / Bodies. The last stanza reads, in 1932, "What if this we do / Against wind, cold, and dew — / Arms put around each other? / Just so that we need not say / I ku anu e !" for which the earlier version had, "How if we two put — / Just to fend the cold — / Arms around each other? / I ku anu e ." It must be noted that the refrain line was changed, in its three appearances, from ke to ku and that the revised version, whatever its virtues or shortcomings as translation, ends with an exclamation. O. S. 1:3 (1923), 181 — 190. Translation of Two Hawaiian Romances , i.e. The Arrow and the Swing (pp. 181 — 184) and The Story of Ha-Le-Ma-No and the Princess Karma (pp. 184 — 190). O. S. 1:5 (1923), 392 — 395. The Sad Sequel to Puss-in-Boots . O. S. 1:6 (1924), 471 — 476. A Polynesian Night's Entertainment , continued in 1:7, 583 — 589. O. S. 1:7 (1924), 659. In Memory of John Butler Yeats . When the poem appeared years later in Colum's Irish Elegies it bore the title The Painter John Butler Yeats 1839 — 1922 and contained some important variants: l. 6, Now your breath's gone and all your words / Your words, your breath. Lines 9 and 10 in 1924 read, "Though they indeed have greyness to fly through / That you had not — the curlews of our land." In Irish Elegies they read, "Adorn the Shannon's reach, or crying through / The mist between Clew Bay and Dublin Bay!" The last stanza in Irish Elegies was added to the 1924 version: Your words, your breath are gone, I, careless said. But your live eyes, live hand Have left pictures of these noted men, So many, and so filled with wakefulness That voices from them pass above the land. One would not know from the early version what is clear from the added stanza, i.e. that Butler was not only a painter but also a portrait painter. O. S. 1:7 (1924), 665. Cretan Picture , retitled and revised as Minoan in the Poems of 1932 (p. 73), but omitted in CP . The revisions, with the periodical text first, are: l. 1, hold / has; l. 3, Or / And; l. 9, It / He; l. 10, in / on; l. 12, Will / Still. "He," the "hound" of line 9, is preferable to "It"; "on his master's mind" of line 10 is preferable to "in its master's mind." Here the revisions are clearly improvements. O. S. 1:9 (1924), 822 — 826. A Note on Hawaiian Poetry , including three poems, Pigeons on the Beach, The Surf Rider , and Hawaiian Evening Song . The first reappears in CP , as part II of Pigeons , so much revised as to be a new poem. The second is the third poem in Hawaii ( CP , pp. 146 — 147); the third is the fifth poem in Hawaii ( CP , pp. 148 — 149). O. S. 1:10 (1924), 906 — 907. The Apple (prose). O. S. 1:11 (1924), 929 — 937. The Show Booth , by Alexander Blok. Translated by Padraic Colum and Vadim Uraneff. O. S. 2:3 (1924), 191 — 192. A Marriage in Manhattan (prose). O. S. 2:3 (1924), 207. The Resplendent Quetzal Bird (South America) . There is one variant in CP , line 10 of which reads "To Quetzalcoatl who makes verdure through rain-flow" for which the 1924 text has "To Quetzalcoatl, the god who went westward." O. S. 2:5 (1924), 300. Fuchsias in Connacht . Revised title, Fuchsia Hedges in Connacht ( CP , p. 190), with five minor revisions in the text, including the omission of line 18, "You stand beside the furzes in our fields." And l. 2, drew / bought; l. 4, I'll / I; l. 6, children / daughters; l. 10, you've / You have; l. 12, before / beside. The poem had appeared in the first number of Commonweal (Nov. 12, 1924, p. 21) in the month preceding the publication in The Dublin Magazine . The texts are the same except that the earlier has "before" in the line omitted in CP , where the later has "beside." 2:11 (1925), 773 — 775. Remy De Gourmont. A monk of Theleme . A review of De Gourmont's Decadence and other Essays on the Culture of Ideas , translation by William Aspenwall Bradley. De Gourmont's method in these essays "is to divide the 'commonplace,' as the translator calls it, or the truism into its two parts — the fact and the abstraction that has been tied to it." And, in explanation of his title, Colum suggests that De Gourmont "belongs to a monastery but it should be the monastery that Rabelais projected — the Abbey of Theleme." 2:12 (1925), 774 — 787. The Betrayal — A Play in One Act . "The action of the Play takes place in Ireland in the Eighteenth Century," with the Scene "an Inn-room in a country town," the actors four in number. 5:2 (1930), 65 — 67. A Note on Austin Clarke . According to Rudi Holzapfel, Clarke contributed seventy-three items to the periodical. 1 The Note is actually a review of Clarke's Pilgrimage and Other Poems , Colum concluding by declaring that he had "a feeling in reading this last book of one who is still the youngest of the Irish poets that the purely Gaelic spirit that delights in pattern for its own sake, and delights in what is esoteric, has reached a limit in these memorable poems." 5:2 (1930), 76 — 78. A review of Ella Young's The Tangled-Coated Horse , the saga of Fionn the Son of Vail, a work Colum praised whole-heartedly, singling out the prose style especially. 5:4 (1930), 2 — 4. Three poems, Lilac Blossoms, Woodbine , and Scanderberg . The first line of Lilac Blossoms , "We mark the playing time of rain and sun," appears as "We mark the playing time of sun and rain" in CP . Woodbine is not in CP , but is reprinted in Colum's The Vegetable Kingdom (1954) with these variants: l. 14, In window-sills / On window-sill; l. 16, As / As the; l. 18, or / on; l. 20, to the house / so long; l. 21, So long, so close / so close to the house. Line 24 of The Vegetable Kingdom , "From where he has lain" is added. Further, l. 26, sudden / l. 27 a sudden; l. 28, meadow-slope / l. 29, meadow-slopes. Lines 31 — 36 of the earlier text are omitted: He hears but heeds not The fiddle within — He is back in mornings When cuckoos called: Then this old man From the porch goes in. Further variants: l. 40, that brings / l. 35, to bring; l. 41, in the / l. 36, the; l. 42, Her hand has lifted / om. ; l. 49, thing / l. 43, bloom. 6:4 (1931), 20 — 35. A review-essay on Dennis Gwynne, Traitor and Patriot: the Life and Death of Roger Casement . Colum knew Casement and when Colum was editor of the Irish Review he published some pieces of Casement's. Colum tells some anecdotes about him, corrects some errors ("reconstructions" he terms them), and concludes that his name "will remain in the canon of martyrs." 7:1 (1932), 67 — 69. A review of Italo Svevo, Senilità, much of which is plot summary, but which concludes that the book "has the freshness of a first novel, and the sort of actuality that belongs to a recall of part of a man's life." 8:2 (1933), 32 — 40. A critical essay on the poetry of "James Clarence Mangan," with generous quotation and the statement that of the 180 "pieces" in "the definitive edition produced by D. J. O'Donoghue" he would "not have Mangan represented by more than fifteen poems." [8:3 (1933), 71 — 73. Padraic Fallon reviews Colum's A Half-Day's Ride , stating that in this collection of prose pieces "we do not find the full colour of Mr. Colum's mind; for that we must go to his verse."] 8:4 (1933), 24 — 29. It is Not wisdom to be Only Wise , a narrative of the trial for treason of Robert Emmet, arraigned on behalf of the crown by, among others, William Conyngham Plunket. 9:3 (1934), 25 — 31. Pilgrimage, 1932 , consisting of "Tours" and "Les Iles de Lerins." 10:2 (1935), 1 — 2. Flower Pieces , i.e. Morning Glories, Lilies, Wallflowers , and Marigolds . None is in CP . These are reprinted in Flower Pieces (1938), with revisions in Wallflowers and in Marigolds. Wallflowers : l. 1, mount / climb; l. 2, set / plant; l. 14, The . . . well-washed / That . . . new-washed; l. 18, none's as / none so. Marigolds : lines 5 — 6 read "Rondures enkindled and as deeply glowing, / As any growing on Hesperides." for which 1938 has, "As rich as simples sought-for and ungarnered, / Whose rondures brighten on Hesperides." All four poems are printed in The Vegetable Kingdom (1954), Morning Glories unchanged. Line 11 of Lilies in the periodical has "the" for which Flower Pieces and The Vegetable Kingdom have "that." Line 4 of Wild Flowers in the periodical has "that the" for which the later two texts have "that" only. Marigolds is much revised in The Vegetable Kingdom , with three four-line stanzas where the earlier versions have two. The first two stanzas are reversed. The first line in stanza two of The Vegetable Kingdom reads, "Take Marigolds — I bring them from the garden," revised from "Bring Marigolds to me out of your garden." The first two lines of the first stanza in The Vegetable Kingdom read, "Take Marigolds — as golden as the posies / The sunset beacons of Hesperides," revised from lines 5 — 6 of the earlier versions. The third is the added stanza: There's gilding on the yellow-petaled Daisies, And gilding on the Sunflower in his height; But with a fuller gold than flowers ensabled The Marigolds are bright. 10:2 (1935), 50 — 51. A review of Sir James Jeans's Through Space and Time . "Sir James Jeans is an instance of a first-rate mind that is limber enough to do a good job of popularization. . . . he helps us to understand the background which scientists of to-day take for granted. . . . he never slips down from the dignity that is inherent in his subject." 11:1 (1936), 5 — 12. Re-valuing Richard Brinsley Sheridan is partially biographical, partially critical, Colum preferring The Rivals over The School for Scandal , the latter being "so loose in structure, so thin in content." The Rivals "is an Irish comedy," while " The School for Scandal is an English comedy written by an Irishman." 11:2 (1936), 10 — 23. A Poet's Progress in the Theatre , an essay-review of The Collected Plays of W. B. Yeats . Colum, in conclusion, invokes Greek tragedy and states that the "ancient poetry was steeped in religion, was constantly referring to pieties; in the plays in this collection there is no religion, there are no pieties. The contrast makes us see how much significance is left out of even the finest of modern dramatic productions." [13.3 (1938), 83 — 85. Austin Clarke reviews Colum's The Story of Lowry Maen , finding, among other shortcomings, that Colum keeps "his blank verse in a hard narrow mould as if he felt that the Iron Age could best be symbolised by cast-iron lines." He terms the poem "courageous."] 14:2 (1939), 22 — 31. Darrell Figgis: A Portrait . A portrait by one who knew Figgis and the political scene in Ireland from 1914 to 1916 very well, the dates being those of Figgis's posthumously published Recollections of the Irish War, 1914 — 1916 . The portrait ends with quotation of one of Figgis's Songs of Acaill , beginning "There is no peace now however things go." [14:1 (1939), 79 — 81. Mona Gooden reviews Colum's Flower Pieces: New Poems with two other collections of poetry. "A simple yet imaginative acceptance of the beauty of the visible world has always been a characteristic of the poetry of Padraic Colum, and this being so, it is not surprising that the freshness and wonder in his vision, which has never deserted him through years of American journalism, should be particularly stimulated by the varied and individual qualities of flowers."] 19:3 (1944), 10 — 14. Arthur Lynch: A Portrait . "He liked me, I know, and I find I had a deep affection for Arthur Lynch." Largely biographical. 21:2 (1945), 19 — 24. The Poet's Babylon . A meditation on the literature of and on the Babylonians with reference to the writings of "Sayce, Renouf, Budge, George Smith, and . . . Stephen Herbert Langdon." 23:1 (1948), 1 — 2. Two poems, i.e. Pomegranate Trees With Fruit and Copper Beeches . Not in CP ; both revised in The Vegetable Kingdom. Pomegranate Tree With Fruit : l. 4, The distance and the sparkling seas / An aeon of the shining seas; l. 9, unsaturated . . . beside / their unsized . . . amid; l. 10, Their pointed / Bright lance-like; l. 12, in all their elements / to all extremities. Copper Beeches has two added lines (15 — 16): "The Copper Beeches spread beside / The Willow, Ash, and Sycamore," and there is one variant, in the penultimate line of the poem, Beside / Against. 24:1 (1949), 1, 19. Stocks or Pinks or Gillyflowers and Irises . Not in CP ; both revised in The Vegetable Garden. Stocks or Pinks or Gillyflowers : l. 2, Those / These; l. 4, Pale / White; l. 6, These / The. Irises : l. 5, colors, depths / colors' depths; l. 6, azure, purple / purple, azure; l. 7, color / colors. 24:3 (1949), 28 — 39. Tom Kettle: A Memory . Biographical-autobiographical. "He was an Irish nationalist who knew that Ireland's place was with Europe." 24:4 (1949), 11 — 17. Early Days of the Irish Theatre, I . Autobiographical-critical (continued in 25:1 [1950], 18 — 25). No one man "created a national theatre for Ireland. . . . behind the writers and players was a national feeling that manifested itself through the young men and women belonging to the politico-cultural clubs in the Dublin of the time; it was they who gave the project spirit and breath of life." 25:2 [1950], 1. Old Song Resung . 25:4 (1950), 1. The Charm . Much revised in The Poet's Circuits. Collected Poems of Ireland (1960) with the title changed to Man Who Gains a Charm . [26:2 (1951), 47. Review of Colum's Wild Earth with three other collections of poetry (pp. 47 — 49) by W. P. M. The "old naturalness of attitude in which Wild Earth [published first in 1907] was shaped has become more self-conscious, and the best of that book has never since been surpassed."] 26:3 (1951), 38 — 46. James Stephens as a Prose Artist . "He brought into Irish literature (it was then at the stage of being a movement) a naturalism that was as fresh as it was engaging." Colum discusses a number of Stephens's prose pieces, declaring his great fondness for the stories "Morgan's Frenzy" and "The Wooing of Becfola" in Irish Fairy Tales . 28:3 (1953), 1. The Dead Player (In Memory of Dudley Digges) . In Irish Elegies the title becomes " The Player. Dudley digges, d. 1933, who played opposite Maud Gonne in the first production of Kathleen ni Houlihan." The version in the periodical has eight lines divided 4, 1, 3; that in Irish Elegies , fourteen, divided 4, 1, 4, 1, 4. The first four lines in both versions are the same, as are lines 7 in the periodical and line 12 in Irish Elegies . 28:4 (1953), 14 — 20. George Santayana . Santayana had died recently, and Colum's was a critical evaluation of his poems, his philosophy, and his religious beliefs. He quotes a number of lines from Santayana's "little known early dramatic poem Lucifer ," praises Santayana's sonnets, and concludes by quoting two stanzas from Santayana's The Poet's Testament . 29:2 (1954), 10. Aislinn (from the Irish of Egan O'Rahilly), beginning "Ere Titan his limbs from the clouds had divested" and continuing for nineteen more lines. [29:2 (1954), 41 — 42. W. P. M. reviews Colum's Collected Poems , singles out the poems from the earlier collections, Wild Earth and Old Pastures , for special praise, and concludes: "Besides these poems there is much fine work of another kind in the book, scrupulously observed and recorded aspects of natural life, and if some of these have the air of being conscious exercises of a jealously guarded talent rather than the inevitable expression of the stirred soul, it may be because one is further removed from their subjects or it may be because a wind that was blowing in Ireland blew upon the others but not on them."] 29:4 (1954), 40 — 49. " The Opening of 'The Flying Swans .'" Prose. 30:3 (1955), 1 — 3. The Hearthstone and the Loom , a verse dialogue between Maurice and Terence. Reprinted in The Poet's Circuits (1960) with these revisions, with periodical readings first, unless otherwise noted: l. 5, And I see / om. 1960; l. 7, Yes, where the window was / om. 1955; l. 10, cool Lismore / Cullismore. 2 Line 16 of 1960, "Clack of the loom was all the outer sound" was line 18 in 1955. Line 17, shuttles / l. 18, shuttle; l. 19, made / framed; l. 23, and / or; l. 31, the / that. The text in the periodical ends with line 63, "Now that we only speak in prophecies," but in 1960 Colum adds " Terence (as they go on) " and the poem goes on for another 23 lines, with the verse (ll. 5 — 12) bearing a footnote, " This verse was translated by Kuno Meyer ." 31:3 (1956), 7 — 13. Joseph, or the Search for the Brother . Story. 32:4 (1957), 8 — 16. My Memories of John Butler Yeats . Yeats died in 1957, an obituary notice of whom by Brian O'Doherty was published in the previous number, pp. 55 — 57. Colum began by saying, "The death of Jack Yeats, a national loss, is one that marks the end of an epoch"; he devoted the rest of the memoir to his relations with the painter. Here, then, is a forgotten body of material for the critic, the editor, the bibliographer, and the biographer to study and about which to form conclusions.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Unpublished Preface to W. G. Simms's Collected Poems by James E. Kibler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Gilmore Simms's two-volume collection, Poems Descriptive, Dramatic, Legendary and Contemplative was published simultaneously in Charleston and New York in early January 1854. 1 In its 700 pages of text, it was the most complete anthology of Simms's verse and consisted of the author's own selections from his nearly 2,000 poems in his sixteen earlier books of verse puplished from 1825 to 1850, and the uncollected fugitive pieces from scores of American magazines, journals, and newspapers over a twenty-five year span. Because Poems is one of the worthiest little-known collections of American poetry of its time, the recent discovery of its unpublished preface is a significant event. 2 The preface is in the poet's hand and at one point, at least, was intended to serve as an introduction to the collection. It is dated from Woodlands, the poet's home on the Edisto River in Barnwell District, South Carolina, and is dated 19 December 1852, at the time Simms was readying the manuscript of volume one of Poems for shipment to his publisher J. S. Redfield in New York. By 25 January 1853, he was reporting that he had sent the entirety of volume one on a steamer to that city. 3 By October 1853, Simms was expecting the two-volume edition to issue from the press, but it did not appear until early the next year. 4 When the volumes did appear, the preface was absent. There is no evidence as to why. The extant preface is heavily revised with interlinings, and probably represents a preliminary draft of a recopied version sent to Redfield, if indeed Simms did send it. It is impossible to say whether it was Simms or his editor who deleted it from the published work. In either case, the preface provides valuable information about the special care the poet took in selecting, revising, and polishing his poems, and thus gives us further evidence that he was not cavalier about such matters, despite a mistaken modern view to the contrary. The preface shows that Simms was very concerned with which works would be left "on record in connection with my name," those "such as I deem the best." The content and spirit of the preface accord well with Simms's statement of 14 January 1852 that he wished "to revise and make myself as worthy as possible in the eyes of future criticism." 5 The concern over his text that he expressed in his preface was commensurate with his declaration to Evert Duyckinck on 24 November 1853, that "my poetical works exhibit the highest phase of the Imaginative faculty which this country has yet exhibited, and the most philosophical in connection with it. This sounds to you very egotistical, perhaps, but I am now 47 years old, and do not fear to say to a friend what I think of my own labor. The vulgar taste for poetry which requires little more at any time than lucid and liquid commonplaces, I do not contemplate at all, and my desire is rather to put myself on record for future judgment than to become a temporary cry f or the hurrying mob." 6 Of popular contemporary poetry in America, Simms wrote that "Your song must be such as one can read running, and comprehend while munching pea-nuts." 7 For Simms, poetry was patently not as "commonly thought to be the mere purpose of the idle hour, a soothing pastime for writer and reader" 8 or "elegant trifles" written from an "occasional dalliance" with the Muse. 9 To Duyckinck again, he criticized modern American poetry, "the merits of which lie upon the surface." 10 Simms summarized his credo by saying that "all the great authors . . . were all professional authors, — surrendering life to this one object. Nothing that we know, has ever come from amateur authorship, but dilletantism, affectation, pretence." 11 These statements and the reinforcing words of the preface reveal Simms's professionalism and high seriousness. It is important that after nearly a century and a half, his preface finally be published as an aid to our understanding that as a poet, Simms was a careful and meticulous craftsman and a man of proper, serious, and honorable intent. His preface gives us further indication of the reasons why he was indeed "a good poet, versatile, accessible, learned, and passionate in feeling" with an ease of technique that makes his verse "inviting" to the modern reader. 12 Here follows Simms's preface, printed for the first time, in its entirety and without emendation. By the concluding word "badge" Simms was no doubt imaging "slave badge" identification, to extend the figure of the poem as "fugitive" now gathered home.</field>

In preparing this collection I have endeavoured to repair the defects [expressive cancelled ; of an interlined with caret and cancelled ] of [ next word interlined above cancelled carelessness] heedlessness &amp; haste in the previous volumes. A voluminous writer is apt to be [ next word interlined above cancelled reckless] careless of his costume, [the cancelled; a careless interlined with caret and cancelled; next four words interlined ] and to send forth his thoughts with a [ next two words interlined above cancelled degree of] certain unwise recklessness which is characteristic of the temperament, rather than the mind.
