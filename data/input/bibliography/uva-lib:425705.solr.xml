      <field name="fulltext">"I am sir, a practitioner in panegyric, or to speak more plainly — a professor of the art of puffing, at your service — or anybody else's." —Mr. Puff, in The Critic</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Commendatory poems, in which friends and well-wishers testify to the merits of favored authors, are a familiar feature of the preliminary leaves of English books during the two centuries that span the Renaissance. Seldom of intrinsic value as poetry, these verses are commonly searched for evidence on conditions of publication or for biographical clues on the contributor or his subject. They are not without interest for the study of Renaissance social conditions and literary taste. Occasionally someone ventures to appraise them as documents of literary criticism, although it is conceded that few approach the serious interest of the most famous example, Ben Jonson's tribute to Shakespeare before the First Folio. This mass of material is now accessible through the present writer's Index of Dedications and Commendatory Verses in English Books before 1641 . 1 The card file for that nominal index was shuffled into chronological order to permit the systematic survey here offered as a contribution to bibliography and literary history. Whereas the custom of dedicating books had a continuous tradition from antiquity, commendatory verses are an innovation of the Renaissance humanists. It is tempting to suppose that the notion came to them as they collected classical testimonia for their editions of Latin and Greek authors. England imitated Continental publishers in the practice sketched by Konrad Haebler: "Italian humanists had begun very early to add accompanying verses to issues edited by themselves or their friends, or to their own productions. With the German classical scholars it became the fashion to place such verses on the title-page." 2 The international flavor of early puffing is shown by the fact that in the first forty years of English examples the slender output includes contributions by (besides Morus) Surigonus, Carmelianus, Andreas, Aggeus, Ammonius, and Remaclus [Arduenne]. The list would be longer if this survey included Latin works published by Englishmen abroad, such as Utopia . 3 In the incunabula period I accept eight poems in six English books as qualifying for the genre of the verse puff. The first three of these were probably gleaned by Caxton from verses already in manuscript circulation. Pride of place goes to the epitaph on Chaucer by the Italian humanist Stephanus Surigonus, presumably written during or just after his years in England. 4 This Caxton appended to his [1478] edition of the Boethius (3199). 5 Similarly there is no evidence that the two poems in Confessio Amantis (12142) were produced to order. But the verses before an undated classical text (19827) and a Horman grammar (13809) show that well before the end of the century commendatory poems were being composed for specific English books. The magnitude of this bibliographical phenomenon and the course of its growth may be indicated in a table that eliminates verses that can be attributed to the authors or to the printers, booksellers, and editors with a professional interest in advertising the books. This table records only the earliest known appearance in print, and ignores all reprints or incorporations into larger collections. The two columns show for each period the number of books with commendatory verses and the total of poems (the number in individual books varies widely). 6 A middle column showing the number of verse-writers has been omitted as unreliable, since the same versifier may contribute to several books over a decade, 7 and the only way to handle anonymous verses would be to proceed on the arbitrary and unsafe assumption that each is by a separate writer. To relieve concern over this omission, the generalization is offered that fewer than one-tenth of the contributors supply more than one poem in a single book. In brief, the total number of poems does not seriously misrepresent the number of contributors as long as the books are considered individually. Years Books Poems 1478-1520 22 32 1521-1533 29 47 1534-1539 0 0 1540-1560 44 78 1561-1570 70 166 1571-1580 132 466 1581-1590 133 405 1591-1600 151 533 1601-1610 162 499 1611-1620 229 828 1621-1630 207 594 1631-1640 293 1100 Totals 1472 4748 The table shows that the commendatory vogue, fitful in earlier years, caught on among the humanists in the 1520's. The complete absence of puffs during the Reformation years 1534-1539 is fresh evidence of the cultural set-back in that troubled period. Thereafter the practice resumed and grew steadily; one judges that it more than kept pace with the increasing volume of publication. There were notable spurts during the 1570's and in the second and fourth decades of the next century (the years 1568, 1578, 1599, and 1611 were outstanding). Sporadic variations included lean years in 1582, 1593, and 1601 and the plague year 1625-26 (yet the plague years 1603 and 1635 saw verses flourish). The trend was constantly upward, culminating in a record 178 poems in 1640, the final year of my statistics. My impression is that the vogue reached its peak about 1650, a peak exemplified by the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647 and the Works of William Cartwright in 1651. Indeed, the fifty-five poems before Cartwright's posthumous book occupy 107 pages, more than a sixth of the thick volume; one ruefully concedes that Prof. G. Blakemore Evans had some reason to exclude the lot of them from his edition of Cartwright. 8 The Neoclassical spirit of the Restoration had a soothing effect on the commendatory itch. By about 1700 the sophisticated literary world had assumed a condescending attitude, and in the eighteenth century the practice lapsed into unimportance. The comparable careers of Jonson and Dryden illustrate the situation. During a writing life of forty years Jonson contributed verses to thirty books, whereas over a span of fifty years Dryden commended fourteen. At the same time ten of Dryden's numerous books were commended by his friends, usually one or two puffs each (the maximum was five in the Virgil). But the Tribe of Ben contributed thirty poems to only seven Jonson books (maximum of ten in Volpone ). As Sherlock Holmes might deduce, either the Restoration was bored with puffing, or Apollo preferred the tavern to the coffee house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The circumstances in which the puff flourished can be illuminated by more detailed study. During the first half of the STC period, 1478-1559, the books with commendatory verses are about evenly divided into three groups: literature (including serious prose treatises), religious works, and school textbooks. Thus the lasting association of the universities and schools with commendatory verses appears from the very outset. During this earlier period verses, like dedications, are in the main confined to books of serious pretensions, whether in Latin or the vernacular. Ephemera and light literature are not equipped with what is still regarded as scholarly apparatus. During the second half of the STC period, 1560-1640, the most striking feature of the statistics of literary patronage and commendatory verses is the increasing preponderance of literary works. Not only did the volume of "literature" increase, but, depending on one's bias, one may say that popular literature won cultural status or that dedication and puff apparatus sank to the level that might now be termed mass media. A rough count suggests that during these eighty-one years verse puffs appear in 428 books classifiable as literary in a narrower sense, in addition to 55 English plays of the Stuart period and 261 prose works of literary flavor (history, etc.). Pedagogical books continue steady with a total of 103, while books of religion and devotion number 298, including, after 1600, occasional pamphlets or tomes of sermons (verses never became standard in sermons). This leaves a classification of 238 miscellaneous works, for in the seventeenth century the commendatory vogue extended irregularly into almost every type of publication, such as technical handbooks or even almanacks (music books had been invaded in Elizabeth's reign). 9 Lighter literature, such as English verse and fiction, began to be provided with dedications about 1570, and puffing followed in sequence. In the Jacobean years the vogue extended to frivolous publications like the pamphlets of Taylor the Water Poet. Meanwhile the plays of the professional dramatists received tardy literary recognition. Apart from a few closet dramas, the first English play with verses was Jonson's learned effort, Sejanus , 1605. This and subsequent plays like Volpone set a precedent for dramatists and booksellers; by the 1630's the practice was common in the quartos of James Shirley and his fellows. As one would expect of humanists, the earliest commendatory verses are in Latin; this language is dominant into the 1520's and remains common in learned publications all through the STC period. English first appears in 1494 (3175). As recreation from teaching "Cambridge and King Edward Greek," Sir John Cheke contributed the first Greek poem in 1545 (22250). French follows closely in 1549 (3045), Dutch in 1568 (18601), Italian in 1569 (3053), Hebrew and Welsh together in 1577 (6364), and Spanish most timely in 1588 (24579, a work in Spanish). All of these languages except Hebrew are used in Coryate's Crudities , 1611, along with macaronic verses and poems in "Utopian" and parody Irish! The memorable suggestion of the Rev. Walter Ong, S.J., that in Renaissance England grammar school Latin was essentially a puberty rite may be given the corollary that at school and university the cultivation of complimentary verses in the learned tongue was part of the liturgy of that rite. The numerous pamphlets of Latin verses published at the universities on memorial or congratulatory occasions from the death of Sidney to the royal blessed event of 1640 suggest that able students as well as dons were pressured to produce polished effusions, and one suspects that at times the task was a study assignment with publication of the best as an incentive. Commendatory verses for textbooks and other publications of schoolmasters and university men are a parallel manifestation. They appear from the outset in schoolbooks by Horman, Whittinton, Linacre, and, of course, Lily. They thrive in the reign of Elizabeth I, as in the Oxford works of John Case (4756, etc., one with no less than 26 praisers) and the schoolmaster John Stockwood's Disputatiunculae (23278, 27 poems). Two books by William Gager and William Thorne contain more than half of the commendatory output for 1592, outweighing ten other works in their volume of flattery. The practice continues in Stuart times, as in Kynaston's Latin version of Chaucer's Troilus at Oxford and James Duport's Greek version of Job at Cambridge (commended by fifteen and twenty men respectively.) 10 Habitual writers of commendatory verses were, as one might suspect, mainly literary professionals. With the curious exceptions of Sidney and Shakespeare, all the chief poets (including Spenser and Milton) wrote puffs. Jonson led the way with 30 contributions, followed by Thomas Newton with 25, John Davies of Hereford with 18, Drayton with 15. From ten to a dozen were contributed by John Adamson, John Cooke, Thomas Heywood, Hugh Holland, Lawrence Humphrey, Andrew Melville, Patrick Sands, George Wither, and—if my identification of initials is reliable—Christopher Goodfellow. 11 Fully 55 other men wrote verses for from five to nine books. The practice of printing his own verse puffs in his collected works was initiated by Newton and continued by Jonson, Shirley, and others. University men who wrote verses would embrace, of course, not merely recognized scholars (including many of the clergy), but likewise alumni who mingled in fashionable society and cultivated the acquaintance of poets. The fact that Welsh writers affect puffs may be due less to a racial trait than to the proportion of academic books in their output— an observation that may apply also in some degree to the Scots. Few other generalizations can be made about puff writers except that the practice seems to have been beneath the dignity of members of the peerage (apart, of course, from their effusions while at school or university). Besides men of letters, puff writers include forgotten people and many who either do not sign names or mask themselves under initials and pseudonyms. Of the hundreds of initials, the great majority cannot be identified with assurance. Besides genuine pseudonyms—whatever that means—various fictitious names are attached to facetious poems by authors or their friends. Such mystifications are at times plausible enough to allay suspicion. The type is admirably illustrated in a 1523 work by St. Thomas More (18089), where certainty could be reached only after discovery at the University of Durham Library of a unique pre-publication state in which alternate fictitious names were used. 12 Unsigned verses are for the most part genuinely anonymous, but a minority—from internal evidence of varying cogency—can be assigned to the writer of signed poems that precede or follow. After excluding such chain sequences, together with poems apparently supplied by author, editor, or bookseller, I find that just under 400 anonymous pieces remain to pique our curiosity—about eight per cent. of the total output. The fashionable accumulation of puffs in the successive editions of Sir Thomas Overbury's Wife is a convenient locus classicus for studying the genre, though the verses appended to The Faerie Queene may be more familiar. If asked for a type example of the better commendatory poem in its palmy days, I would intuitively cite Joseph Taylor's tribute to Massinger before The Roman Actor , 1629. The mystification apparatus to George Gascoigne's Posies , 1575, is notorious. Other writers who exerted themselves to adorn their books with numerous puffs include—in various kinds of books—Richard Stanyhurst, Joshua Sylvester, Davies of Hereford, John Taylor, Captain John Smith, William Hawkins, Lewis Roberts, and James Yorke. While usually falling within the span of from fourteen to thirty lines, commendatory verses range in length from the couplet to pieces that in themselves rival verse pamphlets. An extreme instance of brevity is the collection of 23 Latin and Greek distichs before a Cambridge edition of Hippocrates (13519). A prominent contender for the second of the two "gifts of song"—prolixity—is the seven-page effusion provided for William Cartwright's Works by one I. B. Collections of puffs are sometimes dignified with their own half-title (3220, 24756). Scholars seldom pause to realize that some commendatory poems achieved enormous circulation. The most printed poet of the Elizabethan age was not Shakespeare or even Thomas Tusser; probably he was the anonymous author (perhaps Thomas Gresshope) who penned, for the Geneva Bible, the familiar lines, "Here is the spring where waters flowe" (2123). He was reprinted more often than the puffers of Lily's Grammar. In Stuart times, it is clear from scattered evidence, the task of soliciting puffs was frequently, if not customarily, assumed by the publisher or stationer, often loosely termed the "printer." In 1624 W. B. complains that "The Printers haste" allows him only one hour to write his tribute (17632). As a schoolboy in 1635, Joseph Harrington says that "The Printer writes, our Masters Booke will sell: / And I must write our Master writeth well" (12141). The publisher Humphrey Moseley was undeniably responsible for assembling the tributes for the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio and for Cartwright's Works (both admittedly posthumous). In my Index of Dedications I was unaware of evidence that publishers ever paid for puffs. This remains true for the STC period except for an ambiguous remark in 1609: "I mistrust a gorgeous Frontispice, / Of mercenary penns" (3202). For the Commonwealth, however, contrary evidence is now available. Puffing Cartwright's Works in 1651, R. Hill writes: Nor do we write to make thy Volume swell Hir'd by the Stationer, that it might sell The better for its Bulk. And Prof. Alexander Sackton draws my attention to James Shirley's assurance to Richard Brome in 1652 that A Joviall Crew will succeed on its merits, without a Praise Beg'd by the Stationer ; who, with strength of Purse And Pens, takes care, to make his Book sell worse. One is reminded of Swift's jibe that Dryden's classic prefaces were "meerly writ at first for filling / To raise the Volume's Price a Shilling." Presumably many authors continued to collect their own puffs (as seems to have been the general custom in earlier years), or managed the job vicariously through a cooperative friend. The former was the case with what was perhaps an amateur rather than a commercial venture, Sir John Stradling's Beati Pacifici , 1623. From internal evidence, Stradling circulated his book among friends before publication with requests for their censures. The replies—at least all that were printed—were enthusiastic and in verse. It is not clear whether Stradling used advance copies in print or the manuscript, but circulation of a manuscript seems to have been fairly common. Thus unpublished manuscripts are extant with sets of commendatory verses, and versifiers quite often refer to the text or to their fellow commenders in terms showing access to the manuscript. For instance, in Romulus and Tarquin (17220), Aurelian Townsend's poem alludes to the three poets who precede him. As Michael Strachan points out, the publisher of Coryate's Crudities circulated the engraved frontispiece among the Mermaid wits, for their poems show familiarity with it. 13 After assembling puffs, authors sometimes were moved to pen a verse acknowledgement, either a collective thank-you (11544, 14008, 23779, 24631) or, more rarely, individual bows (17997, 24096). A fraction of commendatory poems—quite apart from jokes and mystifications—may have been faked or ghost-written, but at this distance proof is hard to come by. The striking regularity of some groups of puffs arouses suspicion. But even if daring to impeach the matching verses by nonentities before Robert Tofte's Alba , would one venture to question the sonnets by known friends before Chapman's poems (4985)? The phenomenon could easily occur as a manuscript circulated. The prevalence of initials, pseudonyms, and unsigned pieces may arouse doubts but cannot provide conviction. References to faking are excessively rare, the best being William Cartwright's exculpation of John Fletcher before the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio: Nor hadst thou the sly trick, thy selfe to praise Vnder thy friends names, or to purchase Bayes Didst write stale commendations to thy Booke, Which we for Beaumonts or Ben. Johnsons tooke. Thomas Jordan has been suspected of providing false verses in the hope they would be considered Jonson's (14788). 14 The notion of ghost-writing is particularly repulsive to index-compilers! Happily few explorations have been made along these lines. The most interesting is George B. Parks's argument that George Peele composed certain verses signed by men not usually thought of as poets, such as Drake, Hawkins, etc. (19523). 15 The run-of-the-mill versifier feels impelled to deny that he is motivated by the cacoëthes scribendi . Others, perhaps, but not he! It is only human to seek publicity by puffing another's book. As Owen Feltham cleverly expresses it before Thomas Randolph's Poems : So Creatures that had drown'd else, did imbarke With Noah , and liv'd by being in his Arke. Few have the courage of Peter Heylyn to confess themselves among those "desertlesse men . . . made knowne / By naming lines far better than their owne." 16 Rather, these displays of ineptitude are a response to the stern voice of duty, the need—as Edward Greenfield expresses it (11159)—"to acquit a debt, / Due to right Poets , not the counterfeit ." A sense of long-standing personal obligation prompts the average puffer, rather than ambition "under covert of thy sheetes to lurke" (778). Jonson apologizes to Drayton for not having praised his earlier books (7190), while Thomas Jordan disingenuously denies puffing in hope of a reciprocal puff (20770). Alas for human frailty! The evidence is clear that hundreds of versifiers were prompted by vanity—if not the simple thrill of seeing one's name in print, then at least the chance to exhibit one's wit. His Oxford M. A. apparently inspired William Parre to have his puff printed at the end of a book (18496) so as not "to praise thee to thy face." Punning is frequent, as in Henry Upcher's verses before Robert Greene's Menaphon . One's sympathy goes to John Jackson, who concedes himself a jackass in order to achieve his pun: "the world may say, / What is this Iackson that commends the play?" (22454). But scorn not the pun: through its means one commender confirms the authorship of the book he praises (17805). Like dedications, commendatory verses develop a stock of commonplaces and allusions that are repeated ad nauseam . These respect both the object of praise and the altruistic motivation and unworthiness of the puffer. Naturally the author's genius is glorified and, if his age allows, it is customary to voice amazement at his youth and precocity. If the book has a propaganda aim, the thesis is promoted. It is in order to console a dramatist if the rabble failed to recognize the merits of his play on the stage (11068, 14782, 18346). That commendatory poems are superfluous and cannot affect the merit of a book was a satirical commonplace, expressed in epigram by Sir John Harington and Henry Parrott; indeed, says Samuel Rowlands, "verses ( in laudem authoris ) are farre worse then a Horse-coursers commendation of a Smythfield Iade" (21400). In what may be a sour-grapes statement, Wye Saltonstall has the ill grace to spurn praises (18945); he will stand on his own merits. On the other hand, Richard Robinson admits that "I haue been showne / Bookes that sell well, yet not for what's their owne, / But for Commendators before them knowne" (18673). But the compiler of a trifling spelling book boasts absurdly that he has "shut out all verses in laudem Authoris , and tedious Dedicatories, which now a daies will cost the buyer as much as the Booke it selfe." 17 The very futility of the puff is actually the puffer's favorite gambit: a thousand voices stammer that good wine needs no bush! "Its owne worth / Without a borrowed prayse, shall set it forth" (11163). If "some pieces . . . have stood / In neede of witnesses," certainly to the merit of this book "Friends cannot adde, nor envie make it lesse" (22454). Rather, this tribute, like "a mole on Venus face," is the sole blemish in the book (17636).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV In a culture of some sophistication, any popular literary genre may stimulate the burlesque spirit. The tradition of the mock-commendatory poem, the apparatus of ridicule, may—for the sake of proportion—be sketched rather than discussed in detail. The manifestations are various. They range from the high-spirited and playful to the vindictive. They may be prompted by a book's levity or by an attitude to the author or the author's opponent. The ostensible puffs may be authentic or the author's fictions (some mentioned below are ignored in my Index because they are transparent hoaxes). In an age when the vogue of the mock-encomium overlapped the survival of the flyting, humanists sometimes took pleasure in jesting with their scholarly panoply. An instance among More's works has been cited (18089). More elaborate is William Lily's attack on Whittinton in Antibossicon , 1521, with contributions by a monstrous tribe (Ichnobates Gnosius, Ladon Sicyonius, etc.). 18 There are traces of the mock-commendatory among the Marprelate pamphlets (17452, 22645), especially in Richard Harvey's Plaine Perceuall , to which the "parish vestry" append parody Latin puffs initialed by a carter, shepherd, farmer, cobbler, botcher, and "Schollard." A daring innovation in technique is implied in Marston's charge that Joseph Hall pasted verses in Cambridge copies of Marston's Pigmalion ; unfortunately no example is known to have survived. 19 More influential was the series of mock-commendations Englished by Thomas Shelton in his 1612 edition of Don Quixote , for although this translation postdates Coryate, the verses by Amadis of Gaule, Don Belianis of Greece, Orlando Furioso, etc., were probably known to Coryate's friends in the original. The term mock-commendatory , for the average Renaissance student, inevitably suggests Thomas Coryate's Crudities , 1611. Presumably more people did, and still do, read the fantastic anthology of preliminary poems than plow through the huge volume of travels, though it was mean of Richard Brome to suggest that the text was forgotten before the prelims. 20 Never has such a galaxy of writers, wits, and men about town joined in verse comments upon a single book. Counting a few tardily netted in a supplement (5807), fully sixty men participated in the game (the number of poems is much greater). Jonson, Donne, Drayton, Campion, Hoskins, Bastard, Peacham, Corbet, John Owen, Davies of Hereford, and numerous lesser lights: few notables are missing. When I once indulged the whim of organizing a semester course in Jacobean literature about this Coryate circle, there was no dearth of material. Good natured raillery, rather than contempt, mark most of these comic tributes to the droll personality of the pedestrian of Odcombe. The sequel was in the same spirit. Some malicious soul—as enterprising as unscrupulous—induced a rival bookseller to pirate the whole apparatus of the Crudities as a cheap, though still substantial, pamphlet, adding the barbed note that the 654 pages of actual travels might have been condensed to a four-page epitome if one had taken the trouble. 21 This Odcombian Banquet , 1611, drew an angry but fruitless retort from Coryate (5807). The reference to an epitome leads some to suspect that the perpetrator of the Banquet was Taylor the Water Poet, since Taylor was busy on a Reader's Digest condensation of the Crudities puffs, published in 1612 as Laugh and Be Fat . Lacking Coryate's skill in tongues, Taylor ignores all the poems in foreign languages. The fact that Laugh and Be Fat was incorporated in Taylor's 1630 Works may be evidence of Taylor's vanity rather than a continuing interest in Coryate. But although Tom had been resting in his grave in distant India since 1617, the mock-epic accolade to the Crudities lived in tradition. Coryate is mentioned by more than one wit in the apparatus to the rare pamphlet Joanereidos , 1645. Feminine valor at the roundhead defense of Lyme Regis had inspired some two hundred lines of verse by the Parliamentarian chaplain James Strong. Falling into the hands of Royalists at Oxford, the poem was published in derision, with preliminary matter far outweighing the text. The ridicule includes, as a verse character of a New Model poor parson, a pastiche from the Prologue to The Canterbury Tales that has attracted little notice from Chaucer scholars. This Civil War oddity was, for some reason, reprinted in 1674. Meanwhile the playful nature of their texts had inspired facetious preliminaries in a number of minor works after Coryate, such as Robert Anton's parody romance Moriomachia , 1613, the anonymous Exchange Ware , 1615 (1356), and John Gower's mock-epic Pyrgomachia , 1635. The commenders of Exchange Ware are fictitious; those of Gower were his students and friends. Whether the writers were people or fictions is uncertain in some instances. The poems before Sir Edward Hoby's Curry-combe for a Coxe-combe , 1615, appear a mixed lot, and I suspend judgment in the case of the pseudonymous New-yeeres Gift of 1636 (22631). This amusing pamphlet about the court dwarf Jeffrey Hudson has verses by T. Little, W. Loe, and W. Short: the evidence is weak, but these plausible names may be actual men carefully solicited for the purpose. One may rely on the names before William Hawkins' Corolla Varia , 1634, and the initials in Samuel Austin's Naps upon Parnassus , 1658. 22 Two more memorable chapters of literary history may suffice to complete this sketch of the years beyond 1640, leaving other Restoration examples for future research. The first is the flurry of excitement accompanying the publication of Sir William Davenant's unfinished epic Gondibert , 1651. An initial shower of compliments by Waller, Cowley, Hobbes, and others, both within and outside the book, aroused derisive opposition from Denham, young Jack Donne, and other satirists of Royalist views. Many of these were gathered in two dozen pages published in 1653 as Certain Verses Written by severall of the Authors Friends; to be reprinted with the Second Edition of Gondibert . Alluding with tiresome repetition to poor Davenant's nose, the poems run to abuse more than to literary criticism. The ill-spirited pamphlet went into four printings within a year, to one of which was attached a mock-reply, The Incomparable Poem Gondibert Vindicated (reprinted 1655). England had never seen such an extensive and light-hearted critomachia , as Arthur H. Nethercot terms it. 23 This Davenant feud presumably inspired the similar onslaught at the end of the century against Sir Richard Blackmore, a more prolific pretender to the epic. For it was "some of his particular friends" who published Commendatory Verses on the Author of the Two Arthurs , 1700. Blackmore replied to his anonymous enemies seriatim in the same year in Discommendatory Verses . In view of the prominence of these enemies—supposed to include Tom Browne, Steele, and Garth—and of the survival of copies of Commendatory Verses with conflicting manuscript keys to the contributors, this comic chapter has been more discussed in print than any similar episode except Coryate's. 24 With Blackmore the wheel has come full circle from Lily's attack on Whittinton in 1521. * * * * Large Poems to petty deuices, are as monstrous, as to prepare clouts for the childe before it be gotten, and to flourish ouer a Painters Table, before the Picture be drawne. This good wine I present, needs no Iuy-bush . . . . So pontificated the poetical physician Thomas Lodge before his 1621 translation of Goulart's enormous commentary on Du Bartas (21666). As a translator, Lodge could praise the book without embarrassment, conveniently forgetful that in his youth he had not disdained friendly puffers (16653). The present study reviews the anomaly that almost 1500 Renaissance English books were provided with unnecessary bushes. To the reference above that Shakespeare was among the few poets to refrain from puffing may be added the curious fact that no work of Shakespeare's published in his lifetime contains a commendatory poem as its bush. Can it be significant that in Shakespeare's pattern of imagery, bushes are associated with Moonshine?</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Printers and Stationers in the Parish of St. Giles Cripplegate 1561-1640 by William E. Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Guildhall Library of the Corporation of London is the custodian of most of the surviving records of most of the parishes of the old city. Among them are many unpublished parish registers. One of them is the record of vital statistics of the parish of St. Giles Cripplegate, which, at least in the second half of the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth, was one of the largest and most populous parishes of London. This register is contained in a series of volumes, recording christenings, marriages, and burials from 1561 on. 1 I read these records from the beginning to 1640, copying every entry which seemed to be connected with any person engaged in the book trade (mostly designated as stationers or printers). In this period there are entries that concern more than 160 persons so engaged who lived in the parish long enough to marry, to have children, or to die. If this number is multiplied by 114, the number of parishes in London, the resulting figure of over 18,000 rises far above even the impressive number of names in Arber's index for approximately the same period. St. Giles Cripplegate, however, was much larger than most of the parishes. It may be, indeed, that there was a concentration of printers and stationers in St. Giles. There are other considerations. An examination of the surviving assessment lists for the earlier part of this period in the Public Record Office failed to reveal much additional information. It is likely, of course, that many persons worked here in these trades without leaving any record that can now be found. A boy born outside the parish, apprenticed to a printer of the parish, and leaving at the end of his apprenticeship to work for a printer in another part of London, would probably have left no entry in the registers unless he married before he achieved a stable financial condition. Indeed, if he remained a bachelor, and left the parish when he became too old to work, he might have lived all his active life in the parish without being involved in an entry in the registers. He would have been taxed; the assessment lists and allied public records are, however, far from complete, and do not consistently name the citizens' occupations. This argument, to be sure, may be applied to any parish. It will be noticed that the parish clerks of St. Giles have rarely shown any obvious consistency in the designation of a person as printer or stationer . In view of the ambiguity that existed at this period in the use of the word stationer , it is difficult to assign as clerical errors even such shuttling back and forth between printer and stationer as appears in the entries concerning Christopher Bynneman and Thomas Cotes. Cyprian Blagden has pointed out that a man might be a Stationer (i.e. a member of the Stationers' Company), but by trade a draper; on the other hand, a man might be by trade a stationer, while he was at the same time a Draper. 2 In view of the scarcity of the word bookseller in the registers it appears, moreover, that stationer may have been regularly used by the clerks to designate that category of the book-trade. 3 At any rate, I have been unable to find any correlation between the use of stationer in the registers and admission to the Freedom of the Stationers' Company. Finally, Blagden states that there were among the ninety-seven men whose names appear in the Company's charter of 1557 not only printers, bookbinders, and booksellers, but also suppliers of parchment, paper, and stationery, perhaps illuminators, and certainly a few people who were in quite a different kind of business. 4 It has been my assumption in preparing these transcripts that they will be used to supplement the information contained in Arber and in the dictionaries of printers and stationers issued by the Bibliographical Society. Therefore, I have in most cases followed the spelling of names used in these standard works, preferring that of the compilers of the dictionaries where there was any disagreement. In this transcript I have not felt it necessary to reproduce the clerks' symbols of abbreviation; I have been careful, however, to show expansions by italic type. I have reduced the clerks' superscript letters to the line-level, and have italicized them. The word "with" written with a w and a superscript th appears here as with . The colon in the registers seems generally to represent a stop, not a specific symbol for letters to be supplied; where a colon is followed by a superscript letter in the registers, that letter is italicized in the transcript. The curl around the b of November or December (for example) is probably a specific symbol for the following - er . Where no specific and identifiable sign for an abbreviation appears, the word is given in its shortened form, e.g. "stacoer." The earlier clerks attached occupational names more rarely than the later clerks; therefore, relatively fewer entries appear for these years. The citations between parentheses following the names of heads of households suggest sources for further information. I have limited myself to the small number of major works of reference cited hereafter. 5 Since the question of identity is so often vexing, especially in the case of people with common names, I do not necessarily assert identity with persons with the same names mentioned in the works referred to. 1.

He was probably a son of John Field, preacher and inhabitant of the parish of St. Giles Cripplegate, and a brother of Nathan Field (often named Nathaniel by modern writers) the actor and dramatist. There has been a good deal of writing about the Fields, much of it showing confusion in dates and identity.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 In these registers during the period covered the year begins on March 25th. In his "Records of Players in the Parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate," PMLA , XLIV (1929), 789-826, Professor G. E. Bentley presented some interesting information about the parish and its registers. 2 Cyprian Blagden, The Stationers' Company : a History, 1403-1959 (London, 1960), p. 19 n . 3 The designation bookbinder is not uncommon. I noticed very few examples of bookseller . 4 Blagden, p. 34. Fewer than a score of the heads of households in the following list are designated in the registers as stationers only and are not identifiable in the dictionaries of Duff, McKerrow, Plomer, et al.; in Arber; or in Morrison's Index . These persons may be members of the Stationers' Company whose records have been lost (almost all of the Company's records are missing for the years 1571-76); they may be booksellers, printers, or bookbinders who were not members of the Company, so named by the clerks with reference to their trade rather than to their affiliation; they may be paper sellers; they may in a few cases (especially those involving a single entry for a name) be persons of other occupations (even members of other Companies) named as stationers in error. 5 Morrison and the Short-title Catalogues are rarely cited here and, therefore, should always be consulted. 6 According to his imprints: ". . . dwelling at the Gilden Cup in the Fore street, without Cripple Gate," 1589-1599 (Arber, V. 152, etc.). 7 Some of the males here listed as servants were employed in their masters' book trade. For (another?) John Fishwick see Arber, II. 163. 8 For Godfrey Smith see Arber, II. 157, 199. 9 McKerrow states that he died early in 1635, and that his will was proved on 22 January 1634/5. Can the first of these statements have been derived from the second? 10 Five deaths in one household were no extraordinary event in the summer of 1603 in London. To the reader of the parish registers of St. Giles it is perfectly evident which were the plague years. The multiplication of burials during the summer months is most striking. Cf. F. P. Wilson, The Plague in Shakespeare's London (Oxford, 1927), for accounts of the plagues of 1603 and 1625. 11 Plomer's Robert Barker was King's Printer and Master of the Stationers' Company, with a career stretching from about 1589 to about 1635. Plomer gives the date of his death as 1645. According to Plomer, Robert Barker's son Robert predeceased his father; so the Barker of the St. Giles records may be the son of the King's Printer. 12 The Humphrey Bate who appears in McKerrow made his last book entry on September 8, 1587. He took apprentices as late as May 10, 1589. 13 McKenzie, no. 739. 14 A James Bowring is independently known. I can find no John Bowring. 15 There are several possible explanations for the register's showing the christening of two sons named John within eighteen months, there being no notice of the burial of the earlier John. The simplest is that the clerk made an error in one of the names. 16 McKerrow has two men of this name, both of whom he shows as living later than 1613. 17 Formerly a Grocer (Arber, II. 85). According to his imprints: ". . . dwelling at the Half Eagle and the Key in Barbican," 1588 (Arber, V. 149). 18 See McKenzie, p. 120. 19 According to his imprint, he had his shop "over against St Giles's Church, without Cripple Gate," 1593-1596 (Arber, V. 172, etc.) 20 The vagaries of Elizabethan spelling suggest that this stationer may be identical with the James Herdson mentioned by Greg and Boswell, p.72. 21 In the only entry I found concerning James in the registers, the name is quite clearly written "Yallowe." I have identified him with Yarath James without any very severe misgivings. James formerly belonged to another Company (Arber, II. 28). 22 With John Leigh he was involved in the working of Roger Ward's illicit press in Southwark in 1590 (Greg &amp; Boswell, pp. 36-37). 23 According to his imprint: ". . . dwelling at the Bell in Fore street, without Cripple Gate, near unto Grub street," 1584-1588 (Arber, V. 134, etc.). 24 Probably the William Jones whose shop was in Ship Alley, Redcross Street, Cripplegate, according to McKerrow. 25 Possibly identical with Richard Wells (McKenzie, no. 309). 26 It is possible that Edward Marchant and Edward Morrant were the same person. 27 Probably a confused duplication of the previous entry. 28 Probably by error for Thomas Newton. 29 It appears likely that this entry in the register actually concerns a daughter of John Isam. It may even be that the Cunyer of this entry is the same person as Queneree Isam. 30 Alice Charlewood was the widow of John Charlewood. Roberts bought Charlewood's shop from the executors (Arber, III. 702). 31 Rusewell, who also appears (Jackson, 437) as Rosewill, and Bradwood, who appears frequently in the registers as Broadway, offer excellent examples of the attitude of the time toward the spelling of proper names. In spite of frequent variations, given names are much more regular than surnames, presumably because there are fewer of them. 32 An error of date must be supposed in either this or the preceding entry. 33 It cannot be assumed that Walter Venge was first a printer, then a weaver, then a printer, then a grocer, then a printer, then a member of the Stationers' Company, and finally a mere printer again. The clerks obviously relied much upon memory for occupations. 34 The word "weau" (so written) must be for weauer . 35 Wood was a turbulent person. Having bought an invention for printing on cloth from James Jenkinson, he encountered legal action from other printers on cloth. He then employed his press for printing books, especially primers and almanacs which were not his property. Though he often moved from place to place (even out of London), press after press of his was destroyed by the government; he was sentenced at one time to twelve months' imprisonment (Jackson, pp. xiv-vvi). * See McKerrow, Arber, II.215, etc., McKenzie II.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Today's Shakespeare Texts, and Tomorrow's by Fredson Bowers *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The standard Shakespeare texts of today are almost exactly one hundred years old. In 1863-66 William George Clark and William Aldis Wright published what is now known as the Old Cambridge Shakespeare, the first full editorial recasting of the text since the Malone Variorum of the turn of the century. The series of volumes was then revised by Wright alone in 1891-93. With its sometimes incomplete and inaccurate collations of the basic quartos and folios, this edition became the modern foundation, or source, text of Shakespeare. In November, 1864, the two editors subscribed from Trinity College, Cambridge, the Preface to the Globe Edition, a modification that in some few cases accepted emendations of doubtful words unaltered in the original Old Cambridge. In substance, this critical edition of 1864 has remained up to the present the only complete text worth mentioning formed from a systematic reexamination of the textual situation, save in a limited sense for the New Cambridge edition, started in 1921 by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch and John Dover Wilson, the final volumes of which are only now appearing with the assistance of other editors. However, the New Cambridge text, despite its auspices, has not replaced the Old Cambridge, or the Globe, as the standard authority. The Old Cambridge was redone from the ground up. The editors made a fresh examination of the various early editions, with a view to establishing anew the respective authority and relationship of the original documents; on the basis of this new look, they proposed to construct a conservative eclectic, or critical, text from the best original editions. Given the elementary state of textual scholarship at the time, the results were much better than might have been anticipated from the vantage-point of our superior knowledge. In only two respects affecting a handful of plays were the editors led astray and their text founded on imperfect authority. First, in the assignment of primary authority to wrong editions, Clark and Wright were deceived by the falsely dated Pavier Quartos of 1619 and mistook certain of these second editions as the first, and hence of superior authority in their readings. Next, they were misled into assigning quite unwarranted value to the readings of what we now know as bad quartos , that is, the earliest editions of certain plays that seem to have been printed not from a manuscript in an authoritative line but instead from papers that represent a memorial reconstruction, perhaps made by actors to secure a pirated text to play in the provinces. Following the general opinion of their day, the editors took these highly corrupt memorial texts of such plays as Hamlet, King Lear, The Merry Wives of Windsor , and Richard III , to represent early Shakespeare drafts. Satisfied thus of an authoritative origin, although the texts were manifestly imperfect, they felt free in the conventional manner to emend the Folio with an excessive number of readings brought over from versions that were, in fact, thoroughly untrustworthy. Indeed, in Richard III their critical estimate of the bad-quarto and of the corrected Folio versions was precisely wrong, and they based their edition on the corrupt form, not on the relatively pure Folio. By present-day standards the greatest weakness of the Old Cambridge editors was their inability to cope properly with complex problems of textual transmission. Such problems fall roughly into three categories: (1) The pre-printing history of the manuscript that was utilized by the printer of a Shakespeare play, that is, whether it were authorial working-papers, authorial or scribal fair-copy, or theatrical promptbook. (2) The transmission of this manuscript through the typesetting in the printer's shop, including the whole effect of the printing process on the faithfulness of this transmission. (3) The physical relationship of certain quartos, or early editions, to each other and to the later counterparts of the texts in the First Folio. Under the first heading — the pre-printing history of the manuscript — may be added those plays with memorially cobbled-up bad-quarto texts given a quite exaggerated authority as authentic early drafts. Their evil effect on the traditional texts of Henry VI , of Romeo and Juliet , Henry V , Richard III , to say nothing of King Lear , has been constant and serious. But the matter of manuscript transmission goes deeper. If, as Dr. Alice Walker argues, the Quarto Othello were printed from a corrupt manuscript copy of a late promptbook version of the text, and the purer Folio derived instead from a fair-copy (or earlier promptbook) at no more than one remove from Shakespeare's own working-papers, then the conjectural derivation of the texts gives an editor a generally firm backing for preferring one version — because of its transmissional closeness to the author — as likely to be more authoritative in its readings than the other. Clark and Wright, like other critics of their day, were unable to solve such puzzles. Thus when faced with a divergent textual tradition, each part of some authority, as in Othello or in Hamlet , they could rely on no principle for their choice between the hundreds of variant readings except their literary judgment applied to the traditional preferences of earlier editors. Although not infallible, the critical sense of these editors was broad, humane, and shrewd; and their excellent taste served in some part to repair the blunders of their occasionally faulty textual theories. Despite their wrong preference for the bad quarto of Richard III over the corrected Folio version, for instance, they substituted on purely literary grounds a surprising number of variants from the Folio that later and more scientific editors were to demonstrate must be the right ones. Nevertheless, enough faulty readings from the bad quarto remain in the Old Cambridge and Globe texts of Richard III to make them quite unsatisfactory representations of what Shakespeare actually wrote. Since textual bibliography was unknown in the mid-nineteenth century, the proofreading of early texts while in press, and the consequent variation among readings between different copies of the same edition, was not envisaged. Nor were the means even suspected that enable modern critics to study the compositors of Shakespeare editions for their variable fidelity to copy. In short, no technical examination was possible of the physical documents on which the redone Old Cambridge text was based. Linked to the two preceding categories was the absence of any method for determining the physical relationship between editions in cases of difficulty. Eighteenth-century editors had discovered that certain Folio versions, like Romeo and Juliet for example, were simple reprints of some specific earlier quarto edition. But that the complexly variant Folio Hamlet or Othello or King Lear or Richard III might have been printed not from a different manuscript but instead by marking up a copy of a quarto to bring it into general conformity with some manuscript — a point of absolutely crucial editorial importance — this could never have occurred to Clark and Wright. Hence except in the simplest cases they confessed their helplessness to determine the relationship between two editions of some independent authority, either in the textual history before printing, or in the subsequent transmission of the text and the development of two separate textual traditions. Wanting the necessary determination of the facts, the Old Cambridge editors were once again thrust back on their literary judgment to solve the considerable problems of textual authority and variation. In the main, general satisfaction with the overall features of the Globe text has acted as a serious brake on any proposals of editors once again to scrap authority and to resurvey the Shakespeare textual problem quite free from traditional assumptions. Between the publication of the Old Cambridge text in 1863 and the start of publication of the New Cambridge edition in 1921, the various complete editions of Shakespeare were little more than refinements of the basic Globe text. Indeed, when in recent years the publishers of the G. B. Harrison complete Shakespeare polled a wide selection of teachers, the vote was heavily in favor of a reprint of the Globe, with new introductions and notes, instead of a newly contrived text. The universal adoption of the Globe act, scene, line numbering as the standard for reference may have aided in maintaining its authority. But in some considerable part the simple psychological result of having been brought up on Globe readings prepossesses both editor and reader in their favor, whether consciously or unconsciously. Sir Walter Greg testified to the tug of familiarity when he wrote that the most difficult obstacle he had to overcome in taking a fresh view of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus before re-editing it was to reconcile himself to the less familiar 1616 corrected readings instead of those from the earlier bad quarto that had been traditional in every edition he had read from his youth. Similarly, in his 1936 introduction to Richard III , Kittredge notes, "In some cases the Quarto reading has been adopted in many modern editions and has become so consecrated by usage that one finds it hard to be conscientious and accept the Folio text. Thus in Clarence's dream, 'that grim ferriman' may seem better than 'that sowre Ferry-man' (1, 4, 46), but 'sowre' is probably what Shakespeare wrote." Peter Alexander in his Complete Works of 1951 chose sour; but as indicated by such examples as his selection of Quarto spy for Folio see at I.i.26, he did not fully emancipate himself from traditional unauthoritative readings by applying with rigor a consistent textual theory based on the modern recognition of the correct relationship of the two texts. Indeed, how powerful is the pull of the familiar, of what one has read for years (though it be wrong) may be illustrated by the quite indefensible though invariable editorial preference, whether old or modern, for the Romeo and Juliet bad-quarto reading a rose by any other name instead of the good second quarto's correct a rose by any other word would smell as sweet . The general influence of the Globe text has not been fostered entirely by tradition, however. More practical considerations may intervene. For instance, an editor of a new complete Shakespeare for general reading almost necessarily must use pages from some preceding edition to mark up and send to the printer. He may re-collate a number of the early authorities, as Kittredge did, in order to escape reliance on the unsatisfactory Old Cambridge listing of variants, or the incomplete Variorum volumes, some of them with almost unusable textual collations; but he cannot retranscribe the texts from the originals without an impossible expenditure of time and money. As I can testify, in cases of serious doubt it takes a strong-minded editor to go counter a sufficient number of times to the weight of authority in the pasted-up pages of the edition he has selected as his printer's copy. The disputed reading has usually become established by tradition. It has been the choice of a number of intelligent and respected critics and is therefore "safe." In this manner, through all the spread-out history of its derivatives, the old Globe text has continued to exert a strong influence on its successors. This is not to say that no improvement has occurred. On the contrary, a steady move has been observable towards the purification of the text, less in the direction of independent emendation, or the introduction of brand-new readings, than towards the restoration of original readings wrongly emended by eighteenth-century editors and subsequently established as traditional. Or, as important, the restoration of readings from the more authoritative, or substantive, early editions when competing authority is present, as with Richard III , and when the Globe's false view of the origin and value of the Quarto version led it to adopt some quantity of variants from an inferior text. In the process of restoring the text of Shakespeare from unnecessary emendation, the publication of the great Oxford English Dictionary has played a supremely important part. It is quite clear that Shakespeare's language had changed sufficiently by the eighteenth century to lead the early critics to assume that a number of words were corrupt and in need of emendation. The Oxford English Dictionary is not infallible, and excessive reliance on its authority can have an inhibiting effect on one's survey of the purity of Shakespeare's language in the early editions; nevertheless, it is a vast storehouse of definitions and quotations that demonstrate the general correctness of the original texts as against non-linguistic emenders. In this connection, the major efforts to analyze Shakespeare's grammar and syntax, as by Schmidt, came after the Globe text had been formulated; even the invaluable, though inaccurate, Bartlett Concordance dates from 1894. Hence most of the scholarly studies of Shakespeare's language and the tools to implement such enquiries postdate the Old Cambridge editors and have assisted only their followers. In the course of the successive editing of complete texts of Shakespeare a few landmarks emerge. The Oxford text of 1892 by W. J. Craig, or the text by W. A. Neilson in 1906, are examples of old-fashioned but shrewd literary taste applied to the problems without the necessary technical information to direct the editing to certain overlooked basic criteria. The 1936 text of George Lyman Kittredge, though often traditional, benefitted materially from his wide acquaintance with Elizabethan idiom and his profound understanding of the processes of Shakespeare's thought and expression. The 1951 text of Peter Alexander is in some respects the best of the collected editions, but it is marred by the fact that Alexander was brought in to rescue another editor and therefore did not have control of the operation from the beginning. His penetrating mind gives us, often, our best readings, but these may be mixed with faulty ones not weeded out with sufficient rigor from the old Collins text that served as basis. The revised Heritage text of 1958-59 is an improvement, but it has not had wide circulation. In some recent years Charles Sisson has championed his palaeographical theories for improving the complete text; but his critical taste is far from impeccable, and his reliance on alleged palaeographical evidence too often merely masks an erratic series of subjective speculations. In 1957 John J. Munro attempted a fresh survey, complete with collations. His scholarship proved unequal to the task. Generalization about these texts is difficult and can scarcely be accurate in detail. However, it may be said that a few of them (and a number of unmentioned commercial ventures) have inevitably gained by the constant though usually speculative modern discussion of textual cruxes that in a few rare cases has served to illuminate some dark corner of Shakespeare's meaning. The few discoveries of new documents, like the unique first edition of Titus Andronicus in 1905, have been singularly important but seem to have dried up. More useful has been the slow effect on editors' understanding of the analysis of the relationship of the basic textual documents to each other, as in the demonstration that the Folio Lear was printed from a copy of the Quarto brought into general conformity with some superior manuscript. Additional light has been cast on the kinds of manuscripts likely to have served as printers' copy and their possible relation to the original autograph. The identification of the scribe Ralph Crane who copied out several Folio plays like The Merry Wives and The Winter's Tale has explained some peculiarities in these texts and helped an editor to estimate the value of the readings preserved in the Folio. Thus a superior although far from complete understanding of the nature and origin of the variants in the early authoritative texts has assisted modern editors of the complete works. As against the permanent value of some details of their texts must stand the undeniable fact that most twentieth-century complete editions have been undertaken as commercial enterprises and not as pure works of scholarship. The demands on a putative editor of the works are so severe, and the amount of information that he must sort out, digest, and attempt to apply even to the simplest problems is so enormous, as to make it a physical impossibility for most editors to produce what can honestly be called a rigorous and comprehensive work of scholarship in the formation of a new complete text. Inevitably, most have contented themselves with revising the efforts of their predecessors, largely on the basis of the same evidence, and using the same editorial criteria. The one exception, perhaps, has been the New Cambridge edition, of which John Dover Wilson has been the chief entrepreneur. Wilson, who was an early and enthusiastic convert to the "New Bibliography," made a unique effort to investigate the conjectural nature of the manuscripts, and also the bibliographical relationships of the texts, as an informed basis for a new view of the textual problems in each play. It is perhaps ungrateful to remark that his highly speculative mind produced more random insights than it did comprehensive working hypotheses that have stood the test of informed scrutiny. It follows that despite some most illuminating revelations, the textual theory that for each play guided his principles of editing has too often proved faulty in its major hypotheses. True, the stimulation provided by an editor who seemed actually to be a pioneer in textual theory instead of a laggard camp-follower served to focus more attention on the problems of Shakespeare's text than ever before. This attention was valuable in establishing a climate of interested opinion that led, on occasion, to some fruitful discussion and re-assessment. But the virtues of the uneven New Cambridge text are due more often to Wilson's literary acumen than to the so-called bibliographical theory that was supposed to inform his texts. Indeed, in such plays as Romeo and Juliet his literary taste runs quite counter to his textual theory, and his edition exhibits an enlightened but conventional text that in its choice of readings is often squarely opposite to what would have been produced if he had actually applied his textual hypotheses. On the other hand, the virtues of critical taste and bibliographical theory operate to make his Hamlet text a superior one in many respects. The single editor of a complete Shakespeare ought to put a uniform impress on his work. His standards theoretically should be much the same for different plays, and his judgment in large part similar. Actually, practice does not confirm this theory quite as one would hope. When about forty years separate the first volume of the New Cambridge Shakespeare from the last that Dover Wilson issued unaided, it is clear that changes in knowledge, in standards, and in the aims of Shakespearean scholarship have occurred that have outdated some of his early texts. Hence any scholar who concentrates on one play, and releases it, before embarking on the formulation of the next cannot possibly provide a series of editions that represent a uniform point of view producing equally valid results. On the other hand, the alternative may seem to present an effective impossibility. If, say, Wilson had edited his early plays but held them from publication until the last of the canon had been prepared, as he gained in experience and as the advances of textual and linguistic scholarship over the period of forty years affected his views of the text, we should have expected him constantly to have gone back to the completed texts to revise them so that at one time — when all could be published as a unit — the whole would have been uniform and up-to-date. Such a procedure is theoretically possible, but publication under these circumstances of continual revision of past work while pushing into new territory would have taken over the forty years of Wilson's normal rate of progress. One may well query, first, what scholar can know enough to begin a complete edition of Shakespeare at, say, the age of twenty-five, and then work at it constantly with the object of triumphantly publishing his results at the age of seventy or seventy-five? Perhaps Lloyds of London would issue a policy to his apprehensive publisher, but would the publisher pay the premiums and continue to guarantee publication while all around him his rivals were blithely cashing in on new editions that were saturating the market? Moreover, the task itself would be almost impossible for an academic with a regular teaching schedule to occupy his major energies. Are we then to have complete Shakespeares constructed only by amateurs with private incomes and proved hereditary longevity? What publisher would engage himself to such a project? Very few indeed, perhaps, outside of the two wealthiest university presses with their Bible subsidies, Clarendon and Cambridge in England. Actually, Clarendon is at present engaged to the production of a new and complete Shakespeare freshly edited from the ground up, though with serial publication in view. But Dr. Alice Walker, its sole editor, did not assume charge of the project in its new form until she had reached the stage of ripe experience, and whether her productivity will equal the inevitable race against time is in some question. The initial volume has been considerably delayed. The problem then arises, with the weight of research that is now incumbent on a Shakespeare editor, whether any one person can ever again do the whole works in a text that is not merely a reprinted modification of some existing edition, instead of a completely new, rethought, and independent effort constructed from a return to the original editions (not pasted-up pages of some other editor) and taking full account of all modern textual scholarship? I shall return to this problem in a moment. Just now I ask the question in order to introduce what has come to be the modern attack on the problem, that is, the assignment of each play to a different editor under the general supervision of a chief, or advisory, editor. This is the standard way of producing the new paperback editions such as the Pelican Shakespeare, in the charge of Alfred Harbage. Obviously much depends upon the choice of sub-editors and on the rigor with which the general editor supervises and puts his own uniform impress on their work. Certainly, it is quite possible for a general editor to succeed in enforcing uniformity of styling, as in the typography, the treatment of stage-directions, speech-prefixes, and so on. But his individual editors will inevitably not all be men of comparable judgment or experience. One simply cannot find thirty-odd scholars each to do a text of approximately equal standards, the more especially when many of them will regard the assignment not as a work of independent scholarship but as a hack, or money-making venture that will not deserve a major effort on their part. In these circumstances a particularly heavy burden is placed on the general editor. Having just emerged from under the sheltering wing of Professor Harbage, I can testify to the amazing care he has devoted to reviewing the work of his editors of the Pelican Shakespeare, not only in technical details but especially in the criticism of the text. Not all general editors have his comprehensive knowledge, or his conscience, however. The most ambitious Shakespearean editing venture of recent years, the New Arden Shakespeare, lacked such a guiding intelligence in its early stages. The general editor was a brilliant scholar but no textual critic, and as a result the editors of the individual volumes had an unduly free hand without sufficient check from superior authority and experience. The chief virtue of the New, as it was of the Old Arden, is the commentary notes. As a result, some editors seem to have been chosen less for their textual experience than for their interest in the criticism of Shakespeare, although a few of the more recent volumes are redressing the imbalance. Hence the texts run the gamut. From the early volumes we have an eccentric King Lear by a critic who denied the likelihood of press-variants in the Folio text, although Dr. Hinman has since shown them to exist in some quantity. Or an infuriating-to-read Antony and Cleopatra in which a ridiculous attempt is made to keep as much of the Folio punctuation as possible despite the modernization of every other feature of the text. A reader becomes almost schizophrenic trying to adjust to an obsolete system of punctuation when everything else is in modern dress. The idleness of the attempt may be suggested by the fact that of all features of an author's manuscript the Elizabethan compositor seems to have followed the punctuation the least faithfully, even when it existed — as mostly it did not. Thus the Antony and Cleopatra retains as Shakespeare's — or at least as playhouse — punctuation what is, in fact, Folio Compositor B's own favorite system. The effect can be devastating on a reader unaccustomed to, or not expecting, the Elizabethan system of rhetorical pointing instead of the syntactical system that should accompany modern spelling. On the other hand, such volumes as Much Ado About Nothing have been edited with scrupulous care for the bibliographical history of the text and what can be conjectured about the nature of the underlying manuscript. The picture of today's texts sums up to something like this. The complete editions now current, edited under the hand of one man, have revised and improved the basic Globe text, but unsystematically according to the taste and knowledge of the editor as he has preferred a variant reading here, or another there, or a traditional emendation. Several, such as the texts of Kittredge or Alexander, have been the work of outstanding Shakespearean scholars who have contributed their special judgment to the problem and have been at least conversant with the major textual scholarship of their day. But with the exception of the Dover Wilson New Cambridge, in none of these complete editions has a real attempt been made to cast off the shadow of the Globe and to reconstruct a new text of Shakespeare as an independent act of scholarship. The attempt of Wilson, admirable as has been its purpose, has failed in the last analysis through the substitution of highly speculative methods of analyzing textual history for scientific bibliography, and the failure to do very much towards applying the general textual theory for each play to the peculiar problems of its text. The collected editions of Shakespeare by various hands under a general editor have suffered the inevitable unevenness of execution in different volumes according as the sub-editors have had suitable experience with the editing of texts or else were chiefly literary men engaging themselves to a technical task for which they were not equipped. The Pelican is perhaps the most evenly edited as a general proposition; the New Arden, though some texts are so bad as to demand re-doing, also has a few examples of the very best in modern editing. At the present time something of a point of rest seems to have been reached. Conventional texts for teaching purposes continue to be issued as commercial ventures, but none is likely to make its mark as an original or lasting work of scholarship. Independently of the editors, however, a great deal is being learned about the nature of the documents on which Shakespeare's texts rest, the most notable work of textual or bibliographical scholarship of the century having been issued just this year in 1964. This is Charlton Hinman's two-volume study of the printing of the First Folio, which recovers in the most extraordinary detail the day-by-day operations of Jaggard's presses and the compositors who set the type. Much general information now available has not been digested as yet, and perhaps is not ready for digestion, in the sense that adequate interpretation and exploitation (let alone application) have not been made of the factual findings that have rapidly multiplied since the end of the Second World War in the hands of such younger men as John Russell Brown, Philip Edwards, D. F. McKenzie, Philip Williams, Charlton Hinman, Robert K. Turner, and George W. Williams. The year 1945 may properly be taken as marking the coming of age of textual bibliography, yet no comprehensive new survey of the text by a competent scholar has been made in the last two decades despite some admirable dealing with the problems of individual plays. When one turns to speculations about the texts of tomorrow, a most significant fact instantly emerges. No complete edited text of Shakespeare is available in the only authoritative form that can exist, that is, in the old spelling and punctuation of the original documents in which it was printed. This fact is shocking, but it is true. All available complete texts are modernized, many of them with quite illogical anomalies remaining. In 1930 Sir Edmund Chambers ( William Shakespeare , I, 276) wrote: "A text in Elizabethan spelling is still a desideratum . The Old Spelling edition of F. J. Furnivall, W. G. Boswell-Stone, and F. W. Clarke (1907-12, 17 plays issued) remains incomplete." Since 1912, therefore, or for over fifty years, no one has succeeded in bringing out an edited complete text of Shakespeare in its most authentic and authoritative form. Facsimile and diplomatic reprints are available for some, though not for all plays, but these are not the answer to the problem of a reading edition based on and in large part reproducing the early authorities. R. B. McKerrow, a great scholar, published proposals in 1939 for such an edition, but his early death and the effects of the World War joined with various difficulties to prevent its continuation in other hands. In the past few years the Clarendon Press has revived the long-quiescent project and, at this moment, is awaiting copy for the first volume of the projected series. The fate that overtook the 1907-12 edition, or the McKerrow proposals, will not again operate here, one hopes. Wherein is an old-spelling edition more authoritative in its form than a modernized text? For one thing, an old-spelling edition must refer directly back to the originals, whereas every modernized text is formed by annotation of the pasted-up pages of some preceding editor's version, and is likely, as a consequence, to repeat, inadvertently, some of its errors that were not detected. A long history of the careless transmission of error by this means can be written. More important, the old-spelling text comes as close to Shakespeare's original intentions as can be managed, since the earliest printed texts were set up, some directly, from a Shakespearean manuscript but most from a manuscript that at least had a reasonably close transcriptional link with the Shakespearean holograph. Hence, despite the imposition of the compositor's style, and his occasional error, on the manuscript copy from which he set type, in the absence of the original papers no authority exists superior to the printed editions manufactured directly from these manuscripts. Still, the question remains wherein a good modern text is of lesser authority than an old-spelling edition constructed from the original documents. Are not the words — what Shakespeare wrote — the same? For instance, if one were to listen to actors, would one be able to distinguish whether one were hearing a modernized or an old-spelling text? The answer is, they are not the same and by their nature can seldom be the same in precise terms. To be practical, one can say that an old-spelling edition is likely to be a work of scholarship. The editor will take the trouble to compare letter for letter, word for word, and punctuation mark for mark, the readings in a number of copies in order to ascertain which are the result of press-alterations made during the course of printing and what is the authority of such variants. The editor of a typical modern text is more likely to rely for convenience on the faulty Old Cambridge collations to give him the readings of the various early editions and a conspectus of editors; at the most, and then only in exceptional cases of conscience, may he check his paste-up sheets against some single copy of the appropriate early edition. The old-spelling editor, acutely conscious of the forms that words take in their spellings and in their connective punctuation, studies the printing of the early editions for what evidence can be brought to bear on the text. He is concerned with variations in these forms, whether due to compositorial preference or to the possibility that they may sometimes reflect the spelling of the manuscript underlying the print. From all the available evidence he endeavors to come to some conclusions about the nature of this underlying manuscript and therefore about its degree of trustworthiness. If he thinks it to be a Shakespearean autograph, perhaps as Antony and Cleopatra is, he will be relatively conservative in his emendation. If a scribal copy at some remove from the original, like the Crane manuscript behind the Folio Merry Wives of Windsor , he will be bolder in his treatment of deficiencies in the text. Nothing that might affect the authority and trustworthiness of every possible detail escapes his attention. No law bars a modernizing editor from an equally scrupulous scholarly examination before making up his text. But the plain fact is that though John Russell Brown's modernized edition of John Webster's several plays was based on just such a searching enquiry, to date no comparable edition of Shakespeare has appeared. Hence, on the record, the modernizing editor works basically at secondhand, without the minute and scrupulous examination of the source materials that marks the activities of the old-spelling editor. Yet even supposing that the results might be the same in the actual words — although this is a tall order unlikely to be fulfilled — the fact that the forms of the words and punctuation will differ is often of considerable consequence. For old-spelling texts the original evidence is revealed to the reader, with no impenetrable screen of silent editorial decision concealing from him the essential facts. On the contrary, a modernizing editor must constantly be making up his mind about the import of the evidence and presenting the results all predigested to the reader — and in most texts without the information that he has altered the originals. When in A Midsummer Night's Dream Titania urges her fairies to steal the honey bags from the bees, she observes, And, for night tapers, crop their waxen thighs, And light them at the fiery glow-worms eyes. . . . Since this was written and printed before the introduction of the genitive apostrophe, no external evidence indicates whether the fiery glow-worms eyes refers to the eyes of one glow worm or of several. Professor Arthur Brown, from whom I draw these two illustrations, also notices the lines in the Dream in which Lysander pleading his claim to Hermia, argues, I am, my lord, as well derived as he, As well possessed; my love is more than his; My fortunes every way as fairly ranked. . . . My fortunes every way as fairly ranked : does this mean that my fortunes (in the plural) are (elided) as fairly ranked. or is fortunes the contraction for singular fortune is ? The apostrophe for the contraction is often omitted in early texts. A modernizing editor must make a decision that will, inevitably, lead the reader to suppose that whatever form he chooses is what Shakespeare wrote. Well, maybe! The old-spelling editor does not mislead the reader thus but reports the evidence, always emended if necessary; but if he is wise, he adds a footnote directing the reader's attention to the difficulty, together with a conspectus of what reading critical opinion has previously favored and the reasons for his own conclusion. Even if a modernized text has notes that would refer to such ambiguities as the glow-worms eyes or fortunes every way , the editor's modernizing may still ignorantly destroy a meaning intended by the author, and without a note. Sometimes quite subtle puns or word-plays are contained in variant spellings. Unless an editor is acutely aware of these possibilities, he will conceal the depth of these meanings by his unwitting destruction of the evidence in the process of modernization. A typical case comes to hand in the Elizabethan doublet travel-travail . The first means the process of going from one place to another; the second means toil, labor, or else anguish, pain, distress, effort. Sometimes Shakespeare keeps the precise meanings of the two absolutely distinct. Sometimes, like other Elizabethans, he seems to intend both meanings simultaneously, a device aided by the fact that travel was often spelled travail anyway. Faced with such situations, a modernizing editor may keep an appropriate travail spelling to indicate the probability of word-play, if he recognizes it, or he may obscure the possible evidence by modernizing all travail forms to travel whenever the sense permits. If he does so, he certainly changes Shakespeare's probable intentions in an unwarranted manner and detracts from the vitality of the language and the subtle meaning that Shakespeare may have intended. Here are a few examples in which, in the original editions, the spelling is travail , with what seems to me to be the strong possibility of a pun, but the Globe text silently changes to travel and is conscientiously followed by Kittredge and Alexander. In The Tempest after Alonso and his party have exhausted themselves in search for Ferdinand, the conspirators discuss the planned murder. Sebastian remarks that they should take the next advantage, to which Antonio answers, in the Folio, Let it be to night, For now they are oppress'd with travaile, they Will not, nor cannot use such vigilance As when they are fresh. (III.iii.14-17) From what crystal-ball did the Globe editors decide that travail here meant travel instead of the oppression of the party's physical powers and spirits by the labor and anguish of the search? If a primary meaning were to be sought, indeed, travail fits the context better than travel ; and at the least Shakespeare may well have been playing on both meanings. A lesser example may be found in As You Like It when Rosalind, Celia, and Touchstone seeking the court in the forest come upon Corin and Silvius, and Rosalind begs rest and food for Celia, with Here's a yong maid with travaile much oppressed, And faints for succour. (II.iv.74-75) Here the primary meaning of travel is clear enough, but the secondary meaning of travail is also likely, although modernized texts follow the Globe in concealing the fact. In Love's Labour's Lost in the preliminaries to the masque (V.ii. 191-197) the Boy accosts the disguised Berowne with, If to come hither, you have measurde miles, And manie miles: the Princesse bids you tell, How manie inches doth fill up one mile? Berowne . Tell her we measure them by weerie steps. . . . Rosaline . How manie weerie steps, Of manie weerie miles you have ore gone, Are numbred in the travaile of one Mile? This is the reading of the authoritative quarto. But as an illustration of the ambiguity of the word, the compositor of the unauthoritative Folio reprint altered the spelling travaile to travel , and so do the Globe, Kittredge, and Alexander. Yet with the emphasis upon weerie steps and weerie miles , although the primary meaning of travel or journey is clear the simultaneous word-play on the pain and effort of stepping off the weary miles should also be a distinct possibility, which is lost in modernized texts. In some circumstances punctuation by altering the modification can alter the meaning. The repunctuation of the old texts that must be undertaken by a modernizing editor may, without the reader's knowledge, support one meaning over another, or support one idiomatic usage against its contrary. Many examples are small in themselves, but cumulatively they end by having an important effect on our critical understanding of Shakespeare's language, and even of his plain intentions. For instance, at the beginning of Hamlet Marcellus tells Bernardo that Horatio thinks they have imagined the Ghost, and Therefore I have intreated him along, With us to watch the minutes of this night. That is, the good Second Quarto punctuates so, with a comma pause after along . But the Folio reads, Therefore I have intreated him along With us, to watch the minutes of this Night. Here no comma appears after along , but the pause is placed after us. The point may be trivial, but a Shakespearean idiom is involved (whether one intreats or intreats along ), and a reader ought to want to read this line as Shakespeare intended when he wrote it. The Globe edition, followed by Dover Wilson and by Peter Alexander, omits all commas so that one reads, Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night. This alteration of the punctuation of either authority dodges the whole question, which is — does with us modify the elided come before along , or does it modify to watch . That is, should one paraphrase, "entreated him to come along with us in order to watch," or "entreated him to come along in order to watch with us"? The Folio reads the first, but the Quarto the second. Kittredge retains the Quarto comma after along , and in my opinion correctly, since the us must refer to both Marcellus and Bernardo, but Horatio has come only with Marcellus for the purpose of joining Bernardo to watch the minutes of the night. The Globe modernization towards light punctuation, perhaps unthinkingly followed by Wilson and Alexander, removes the Quarto's signpost punctuation and leaves the matter ambiguously open to the reader's conjecture — to the loss of Shakespeare's probable intention. A linguist and lexicographer would certainly be interested in the difference, and so should we if we are concerned with fine shades of meaning. If this example seems like nitpicking (even though it be multiplied many hundreds of times to the loss of Shakespeare's precision of meaning), then we may contemplate the effect of the dispute between Quarto and Folio about the modification of some key phrases in Hamlet's "What a piece of work is a man" speech to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (II.ii.12-16). The Second Quarto reads, What peece of worke is a man, how noble in reason, how infinit in faculties, in forme and mooving, how expresse and admirable in action, how like an Angell in apprehension, how like a God. According to this punctuation, man is infinite not only in faculties but also in form and moving; his action is express and admirable; he is like an angel in apprehension, indeed (as an exclamation) he is like a god. On the other hand, the Folio, which is followed by all editors, has this: What a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in Reason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and moving how expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an Angel? in apprehension, how like a God? One must admit that the sense is perceptibly affected by the reassignment of express and admirable to man's form and moving instead of to his faculties, and by the distinction between the action of an angel and the apprehension of a god. Both readings can and have been argued; and sometimes, in a moment of weakness, one may wonder idly whether our general preference for the Folio reading has not been shaped by the generations of early editors who relied on the Folio over the Quarto in most cases of variation — though I take it the Folio is really correct. These days we are inclined to defend the general textual authority of the Hamlet Second Quarto, especially if it were printed from Shakespeare's own working papers, whereas the Folio may represent a copy of a copy of a copy of these papers. That there may be two sides to this moving speech is concealed from any reader of a modernized text, however. Yet the case for the early punctuation goes deeper even than such important questions of linguistic analysis, or of basic meaning. Elizabethan syntax and the rhetorical punctuation system that accompanied it are wedded and cannot be divorced without really serious loss. Any modernizing editor finds acute difficulty in applying present-day logical syntactical punctuation to Elizabethan structures that are perfectly suited to the graduated pauses of rhetorical pointing but not to strict and limited modification. All sorts of expedients must be adopted in modernizing, such as series of dots or a far too liberal sprinkling of dashes as clumsy substitutes for the original. But the fact remains that when Shakespeare's plays are read in hobbling and anachronistic modern punctuation, a real injustice is done to the free flow of the verse, or prose, and to the loose rhetorical structure. The answer, quite definitely, is not to use the old punctuation with modern spelling, as in the New Arden Antony and Cleopatra , an even more unworkable anachronism. Instead, it is to read Shakespeare in an edited form that reproduces the original, corrected and modified as necessary to form a usable and accurate reading text. Formerly, the old pedantic use of the long 'f' that looks like an 'f' to the uninitiate, and then the confusing retention of the 'u' for medial 'v' and of 'v' for initial 'u', and the invariable appearance of 'i' for 'j', militated against the ease of reading old spelling for all but the expert. However, these typographical conventions have no real purpose in a reading text, even one suitable for scholars, and they are now being discarded as an obstacle to the reader. Consequently, any reader who is concerned with the most accurate and intimate approach to Shakespeare will require a critically edited old-spelling text, not a modernized version that constantly draws a veil between him and the subtleties of the original. This is not mere antiquarianism, but solid common sense. Students constantly show us that one does not need to be a trained scholar to read such editions, properly prepared, with ease and with an added pleasure. Finally, the presence of an authoritative old-spelling edited text of Shakespeare, with full collations, would vastly improve the quality of the modernized versions that will always be necessary for school use and for the most popular reading. A new and definitive norm would be established on which these popular texts could be based, and by this means one could end the long chain of accumulated error that has resulted from the carelessness of selection of textual authority, the paste-up system of preparing printer's copy, and the thoughtlessness that follows from depending too closely on the work of other editors. Such enlightened old-spelling complete editions are sure to be the basic texts of tomorrow. Not one can be bought today, and the New Oxford edition, which will be in this form, will very likely not be completed in the lifetime of some of us here. Not in mine, surely. Tomorrow's texts, thus, or perhaps the day after tomorrow's will make available reading editions either in usable old-spelling versions for the informed and cultivated general reader, or for popular use more accurate modernizations than are now generally available. I hope you will receive this as a prophecy. If these critical old-spelling texts are as desirable as I assert they are, why do we not have them now? One answer, though it is incomplete, is that no Shakespeare text can be very profitable if it does not see widespread use in the schools. Hence publishers are conservative and do not wish to engage themselves, in what is a highly competitive business, to an expensive undertaking that will limit the use of a reading edition to only one segment of the public. Moreover, in their favor let it be said that the means for making old spelling palatable to non-scholars by dropping its distinctive typographical difficulties, which are of no true significance, are of comparatively recent acceptance. Another important reason, possibly, is psychological. Modernized texts can be semi-respectable hack work, but an old-spelling edition, just now at least when we are in the pioneering stage, requires basic scholarship. In the lack of publishers' enthusiasm, academic modesty has persuaded workers in the Shakespeare industry (as it is familiarly known) to tried and true formulas that are simpler than the unknown terrors of old-spelling. The commercial academics well know that any attempt on their part to treat old-spelling editions as casually as they have dealt with modernized versions would call upon their heads the wrath of all informed critics, because they would have been dealing with a serious matter of scholarship, not just with innocuous texts garnished with pretty pictures for the passive general reader, and school children. The day will come when versions of some authoritative basic old-spelling edition will be contrived for general use, but the camp-followers must wait for that day when a source and model will be available. They do not have the scholarship or the skill to construct an acceptable old-spelling text for themselves. We await, then, the authoritative critical edition of Shakespeare that will serve as the basic model for more popular modifications in the original spelling as well as in modern form. Why are the scholars not delivering it? The answer is that anyone who sets himself to edit the ultimately authoritative old-spelling Shakespeare that will preempt the field, as the modernized Old Cambridge, and its Globe derivative, did in its day, knows that the time has not come for the start, since too much vital information is still uninvestigated and too many crucial problems unsolved. Since this situation will last for a number of years, the need is sufficiently urgent for some transitional old-spelling edition, such as the New Oxford may well prove, to be issued in the interim. It will have the field to itself for time enough to justify its existence, and more. I turn now, though very briefly, to some examples of the problems that need solving before this ultimately authoritative edition can be produced to serve as the progenitor of tomorrow's superior texts. First, let it be said that present-day editors have long since exhausted traditional materials. Just about every emendation has been proposed that is likely to be adopted, and editing has largely resolved itself to the exercise of personal choice among the known alternatives. The purpose of the new scholarship that will produce tomorrow's texts is threefold: first, to evolve a more scientific and logically rigorous method to govern the critical choice of alternatives in respect to the words of the text; second, to indicate the degree of confidence that a reader can feel in the various critical choices that have been made; and, third, to bring some order and authority into the presentation of what are known as the accidentals of a text, that is, the system of spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and word-division that clothes the words and sometimes shares directly in the communication of their meaning. First, to evolve a more scientific and logically rigorous method to govern the critical choice of alternatives in respect to the words of the text . This investigation has two prongs, the linguistic and the bibliographical. Modern linguists — spawned by cold-war necessities — have scarcely tackled the problems of Renaissance English, and when they have done so the results have not always been valid because some scholars were too bibliographically naive to choose the proper texts for analysis. Time and again an editor of Shakespeare comes up short against a wall of ignorance about the possibility or impossibility of certain grammatical or syntactical constructions, and finds no specialist in the Elizabethan language to help him. Is a seemingly nonce word a Shakespearean invention, a rare form, or a possible corruption? To what extent were various dialect forms accounted acceptable in cultivated speech? (Some suggested emendations by linguists, or defenses of possibly corrupt readings, reach into every nook and cranny of country dialect although spoken from the mouths of kings on the stage.) What spellings of certain words are possible and what impossible? What limitations can be placed upon violation of grammatical concord? The truth is that despite three centuries of study we still know far too little about Shakespeare's language to answer a large number of questions that inevitably arise. The Early Modern English Dictionary , which would serve as a new foundation, seems to be bogged down and in need of transfer to hands that will make it a going concern. The bibliographical investigations that remain form a staggering prospect in that they seem to branch out in every direction. I select only two as illustrations. The basic all-purpose investigation must be into the specific habits of the compositors who set Shakespeare texts, including their faithfulness to copy both for words and for accidentals, or their tendency to certain identifiable kinds of divergence and error. Charlton Hinman's monumental work now identifies the five Jaggard compositors who set the First Folio and assigns the shares of these workmen even down to a part column on a page. As yet, the equally important quarto texts set in a number of printing shops have seen little scrutiny, and most of their compositors remain unknown. The importance of the information that will follow an analysis of each compositor's work, in a manner as yet scarcely envisaged, cannot be over-estimated. By stripping the veil of print from the texts, one may recover a number of the characteristics of the manuscript that was given to the printer. From such evidence one may eventually determine, not impressionistically as at present but scientifically, which were Shakespeare's own papers and which copies by perhaps identifiable scribes like Ralph Crane. For instance, it is now known from details in the Folio print that at about the halfway point of The First Part of King Henry VI another hand, with different spelling characteristics, took over the inscription of the lost manuscript. No scholar has yet looked into the effect on the text by playing the two compositors that set the Folio pages against the two inscribers, although the fact has been known for about ten years. Either of the hands could perhaps be Shakespeare's. The possibility is certainly worth looking into, to say the least. One of the first tasks of any editor is to try to identify the kind of manuscript that served as printer's copy for a Shakespeare first edition and for any later authoritative form of the text. Indeed, his editorial practice will be largely dictated by what he finds in this enquiry. If the manuscript, he thinks, is a Shakespeare autograph, the printer's errors will often be simple ones of misreading the handwriting, mixed with some amount of memorial error. The editor will be inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to difficult words or phrases less likely to be the invention of the compositor than of the author, and he will feel that they can represent Shakespeare's own, or else in some recoverable form a recognizably corrupt version of what Shakespeare wrote. But although the printed text will be superficially cleaner and more correct if the printer's manuscript were a scribal copy, the editor will know that it is sure to harbor concealed corruptions of a different sort from the first, and he will incline to be much bolder in his questioning of passable but not entirely characteristic readings. Already we know in the First Folio that the quality of the work of the veteran Compositor A was superior indeed to that of the apprentice Compositor E, named John Leason, who had joined Jaggard's establishment just a few months before he started to typeset Titus Andronicus . We suspect that Compositor B was likely to crowd his memory with too much manuscript material before turning to his type-cases, and hence that his proportion of paraphrase and substitution is higher than is A's. We can sometimes see that Compositor B is prone to tinker with the metre and perhaps voluntarily to change words that did not seem to him to be quite right. The analysis of compositors may lead not only to some clearer concepts of the nature of the manuscripts for the different plays, but also to evidence about the disputed relationship of different printed editions. No editor can tackle the serious problems of Hamlet or of Othello unless he knows whether the quite different Folio version was itself set directly from a manuscript in another tradition from that of the Quarto, or whether a copy of the Quarto was marked up for the printer by comparison with this manuscript. An editor of Richard III had better determine whether a copy of the third or of the sixth quarto was annotated to form the printer's copy for the Folio. The hypotheses that link some texts like the Quarto and Folio of The Second Part of King Henry IV are still far from demonstrated, to the despair of editors. Even the Folio Hamlet , for which the printer's copy seems to be an annotated quarto, has some nagging problems involving the compositorial treatment of the supposed copy that continue to disturb bibliographical critics. On the other hand, the application of the bibliographical method of textual study to the Othello problem has proved successful, just this year, in demonstrating the dependence of the Folio on the Quarto, and it may be hoped that the other texts, when rigorously examined, will also become subject to factual demonstration in a manner not previously contemplated. Second, to indicate the degree of confidence that a reader can feel in the various critical choices that have been made . Some readings are subject only to critical hypotheses. In Hamlet's "To be or not to be" soliloquy whether the Quarto's enterprises of great pitch and moment is correct, or the Folio's great pith and moment is a critical matter pure and simple, not susceptible of bibliographical decision except as a general view of the Folio's authority and its connection with the Quarto might bear on the solution of an individual reading. On the other hand, when the Folio Richard III , probably set in main part from an annotated copy of the Sixth Quarto, repeats a reading that is known to be a printer's corruption since it first appeared in the unauthoritative reprint Second Quarto, bibliographical logic demands a return to the original reading of the first edition. In the first instance, a reader can weigh the analogies in Shakepearean and general Elizabethan idiom of pitch and of pith and in context come to some agreement or disagreement with editorial choice. Since a hair's-breadth separates the appropriateness of either word, only provisional confidence can perhaps be given to any critical choice. Even in the Richard III example there is less than absolute certainty despite the bibliographical demonstration of superior authority. An editor should know that he cannot guarantee that the memorially reported First Quarto original reading is actually Shakespeare's, because too many words in this edition are demonstrably not authentic. Yet he can inform the reader that even though the word itself may not be authentic, the odds are that it comes closer to Shakespeare than can a simple printer's error in the second edition transmitted through to the sixth and thence to the Folio. Practical certainty can be achieved in Richard III in another textual situation, however. When the First Quarto reads one word, and the Second Quarto, or a later, corrupts to another, but the Folio returns to the reading of the first edition, the only assumption is that the Folio scribe corrected the error in his printed copy by reference to his manuscript. The manuscript behind the Folio text and the actor's memory that produced the First Quarto were therefore in agreement. Hence, unless one is to suppose that the word is a common error emanating from the promptbook, a real vote of confidence can be given the first reading as authentically Shakespeare's, and the other can be discarded utterly. Another example shows how textual theory can assist us to estimate the confidence we may place in the authenticity of a reading, here an editorial emendation. This is the passage in which Hamlet toys with Polonius and leads him towards the theory of love madness with "For if the sunne breede maggots in a dead dogge, being a good kissing carrion. Have you a daughter?" At least, a good kissing carrion is the Second Quarto reading, followed by the Folio, although most editors emend to being a god kissing carrion . If like the Quarto the Folio were set directly from an independent manuscript, the odds would be high against a common error of this sort in two such disparate authorities, and the emendation would be doubtful indeed. On the other hand, if a copy of the Quarto were marked up for the printer by consultation with some other manuscript, all one need do to explain the preservation of the assumed error in the Folio is to conjecture that the collator overlooked the difference in the words, even though his manuscript presumably read god . This is far from an impossible situation, for just such oversights can be demonstrated in the Folio Richard III , and there are other possible cases in Hamlet . We must recognize that suggesting that this oversight could occur is very far from demonstrating that it did occur. Nevertheless, an emending editor who believes in the annotated-quarto theory can indicate to his reader a far greater confidence in the emendation of good to god than can an editor who takes it that the Folio was set from manuscript printer's copy and that the error good must go back to some common original. Third, to bring some order and authority into the preparation of the accidentals of a text, especially those that share directly in the communication of meaning . The popularization of modernized texts, not always with direct reference back to the authoritative early editions, has led to much carelessness in viewing the spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and division of the originals. Since these features would be modernized anyway, many editors have chosen to ignore the significance of the early forms. But even in such very minor examples as that offered by entreat along with us to watch the minutes of the night , or the travaile-travel word-play, the exact forms of the basic authorities are singularly important to construe. One of the chief functions of a critically edited old-spelling edition will be to settle in a definitive manner — with due regard for the different compositorial characteristics — the precise forms of the originals. This process will involve a minute collation of all first-quarto editions in search of press-variants, something that (shockingly) has not yet been done for every Shakespeare text. (Dr. Hinman has taken care of the Folio collation, of course.) It will also involve a careful scrutiny of ambiguities and an attempt to resolve them. For instance, when Falstaff in The Merry Wives in outrage at Pistol's refusal to carry the letter to the wives shouts, "I, I, I my selfe sometimes, leaving the feare of heaven on the left hand, and hiding mine honor in my necessity, am faine to shuffle: to hedge, and to lurch" (II.ii.23-25), the Folio, followed by all editors, prints I , I , as if it were the first person pronoun, and an actor would be justified in beating his breast to emphasize the repetition of the meaning, I , even I. But since the adverb ay (meaning yea ) was also frequently spelled capital 'I' like the pronoun, an editor must consider carefully the possibility that Falstaff is, instead, saying, "Yes, yes, I myself." Finally, the re-examination will concern itself with the detection and emendation of error on a conservative basis and always with record of any alteration made in the original. Doubtless not much that is very startling or novel will appear in this new definitive edition of tomorrow that is to replace the Old Cambridge text of today as a source authority. Laymen are far too optimistic when they think that scholarly re-examination of the original documents by textual critics must inevitably produce new lines, phrases, or words by Shakespeare not hitherto discovered. The prospect of any second coming is most unlikely, although it is to be expected that some few new emendations may be suggested, perhaps of a minor sort. It must be emphasized that the basic variants between early editions have been known for many years, that there is much more to a definitive edition than the editorial invention of new readings to replace those in the original thought to be in need of emendation, and that very few previously unsuggested editorial emendations of any marked importance, likely to secure general consent, will be proposed and adopted in the future. Indeed, perhaps the most valuable result might be the confirmation of a certain number of existing traditional emendations, like some of the positively required additions from the bad quarto to the Folio Merry Wives text. As the obverse, we may look forward to the discarding once and for all of excessive emendation that has become traditional, as in other of these Merry Wives additions that have been accepted from old days by a series of editors who knew little of the suspect authority of any bad-quarto reading and had no idea of the correct relationship of the two forms that have been preserved for this text. The restoration of the purity of Shakespeare's text from traditional emendation based on what are now known to be false premises will alter many readings, some of them very familiar. The greatest changes will unquestionably come in those plays where two texts, each of some independent worth, have been subject to random conflation or substitution of readings without regard for their textual history and relative authority. The re-evaluation of the evidence for the nature of the underlying manuscripts and their respective authority (or purity) is badly needed for such important plays as Hamlet and Othello but chiefly for that perennial problem, King Lear . The choice of readings not on a subjective basis but logically guided by the pre-printing history of the manuscripts and the post-printing physical relationship of the texts will certainly result in changes from tradition. Hamlet's flesh, for instance, will become too , too sullied , not solid . Cordelia's love will become more ponderous and not more richer , and so on. As an easier problem, the last vestiges of indefensible bad-quarto readings in plays like Richard III and Romeo and Juliet will be weeded out. In the future we shall no longer read spy for see in Richard or name for word in Romeo and Juliet on the basis of assumed literary superiority when the physical, bibliographical facts make the odds about 1,000 to 1 against their correctness. Despite all the editing that has been done in this century, Shakespeare's text of today is pockmarked with indefensible wrong words substituted one to two hundred years ago from early texts of inferior or of no authority. No blinding new revelations about plot or character are to be anticipated, then: Hamlet will not be revealed as a woman in disguise, nor will Lear save Cordelia from hanging. But that unique instrument of Shakespeare's language in all its Elizabethan vigor and subtlety will have its eighteenth- and nineteenth-century tarnish rubbed off and will gain some new glints that cumulatively will strike all but the dullest eyes, and ears. As a bonus, the informed reader will be freed from the strait-jacket of inappropriate and arbitrary modern punctuation contrived for a different kind of syntax, and will be able to read the texts with the indication of pauses, and their weight and duration, that seemed appropriate at the time. No one is so foolish any more as to argue that the punctuation — now demonstrated to be mainly compositorial — is Shakespeare's own or that it represents in any way the authority of the playhouse. But such as it is, it is the most authentic that we have, and it is usually well suited to clarify the casual Elizabethan syntax. Finally, the ability to read Shakespeare in his early spelling will reveal fresh nuances, associations, and plays on sounds and meanings, in depth, that have too often been destroyed by the heavy hand of modernizing editors. These add up to a not inconsiderable benefit. They are well worth the extraordinary amount of time and treasure that will need to be devoted to the project. The prime desideratum is a computer-made old-spelling concordance that will assemble all the basic facts for editorial analysis. The problems of programming such a concordance and of getting it into usable form with a sufficiently comprehensive scope are staggering indeed, but not insoluble. Without it the necessary compositor studies, linguistic analyses, and then — that crown of all editing — the critical evaluation and coordination of the final results, can never be achieved. We may have transitional texts tomorrow without such a comprehensively planned concordance, but the final and authoritative form of Shakespeare's text that need never be changed except in minor detail awaits an electronic birth. However, I do not put the machine above the critical mind, because — in the end — the sole function of linguistic analysis and of textual bibliography, with all its mechanical aids, is to guide an editor's critical intelligence to the truth. This process involves setting technical limits to conjecture by means of the scientific establishment of different degrees of factual probability ranging from the quicksands of mere possibility up to the starry level of irreversible demonstration. The concordance will doubtless prove easier to come by than the ultimate editor. Perhaps, in the end, one man may be able to digest the widely assorted technical and critical problems and unify them into a single great work of scholarship. It may be, on the other hand, that the ultimate editor will, instead, be the director and the final arbiter of a uniformly trained small group of scholars, learning and then working together within a single room in a research institute. If the miracle of the King James Bible could emerge from some such form of one mind in bodies multiple, perhaps there is some hope for Shakespeare — in the twenty-first century.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Thackeray's Contributions to Fraser's Magazine by Edward M. White</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Makepeace Thackeray contributed heavily to Fraser's Magazine in the early years of his career. There he first published the various "Yellowplush" papers (1837-38), "Catherine" (1839-40), "A Shabby-Genteel Story" (1840), "The Great Hoggarty Diamond" (1841), the various "Fitzboodle" papers (1842-43), "Barry Lyndon" (1844), and a large variety of ballads, tales, travel pieces, and critical articles. Though he was contributing at this time to a number of other periodicals, Thackeray's most substantial and important work appears in Fraser's ; it is this magazine more than any other that provided the apprentice training that was to turn him into a highly professional novelist. 1 Thus it becomes of some importance to the Thackeray scholar to examine these early writings. But an investigation of the available bibliographies reveals an extraordinary lack of agreement about which Fraser's articles are Thackeray's. At one time or another, one hundred and fifty-three different contributions have been listed as surely or possibly by him, but no single authority has included more than one hundred and twenty-two, and most bibliographies list under one hundred. The differences are not only quantitative, however; we find items listed as doubtful on one bibliography marked as sure on the next, and not mentioned at all on the next but one. The first attempt at a list was made by R. H. Shepherd in 1881, and revised in 1887 as an appendix to Sultan Stork and Other Stories (pp. 221-260). Shepherd lists seventy-nine items as Thackeray's. This volume was followed in 1888 by C. P. Johnson's The Early Writings of William Makepeace Thackeray , which gives no bibliography, but includes a brief discussion of some possible attributions before 1840 (chap. x, pp. 221-260). John P. Anderson contributed a sketchy and inaccurate bibliography as an appendix to Herman Merivale and Frank Marzial's Life of William Makepeace Thackeray (London, 1891), which includes but seventy-five items in Fraser's . Lewis S. Benjamin ("Lewis Melville") published a bibliography in his Life of William Makepeace Thackeray (1899) which he expanded and revised in his William Makepeace Thackeray (2 vols. [London, 1910], II, 143-376). This ambitious and comprehensive listing includes eighty-nine Fraser's articles as Thackeray's and fourteen as possibly his. In 1919 Henry Sayre Van Duzer's A Thackeray Library also listed eighty-nine positive attributions, although four of them were different from Benjamin's, and included twelve as possible. Malcolm Elwin's bibliography in Thackeray: A Personality (London, 1932, pp. 380-382) adds one new article, but is spotted by occasional careless errors; he lists eighty-seven items as Thackeray's and eight as doubtful. The two most recent studies appeared about thirty years ago. (Gordon N. Ray in his recent biography is content to mention the bibliographical problem in passing. 2 ) Harold S. Gulliver's Thackeray's Literary Apprenticeship (Valdosta [Georgia], 1934) includes two lists of articles and some discussion (pp. 66-89). Although he attempts to weigh evidence with some care, in fact he tends to include items for which there is no evidence. He gives ninety-four contributions to Thackeray and adds eighteen as possible. Miriam M. H. Thrall in Rebellious Fraser's (N. Y., 1934) is even more generous. Unaware of the detailed evidence of Thackeray's activities and interests in the early 1830's which would appear in The Letters and Private Papers of William Makepeace Thackeray , 3 she credits him with much additional writing: she lists ninety items as Thackeray's, four as probably by him, and twenty-eight as probably by him in collaboration with various other writers. None of these bibliographies can be relied on wholly, though in most of them the major works are listed accurately. They are, in general, rendered undependable by their inclusion of doubtful works with those of unquestioned authenticity, and by the excessive number of "possible" or "probable" attributions, which leave the reader in some perplexity about the nature of evidence which has been trusted. I do not mean to slight the labor which has gone into these bibliographies, for all studies of Thackeray (including this one) lean heavily on them; but the listing below has the double advantage of profiting by the recent work of Gordon N. Ray and Walter Houghton, 4 and thus has greater claims to accuracy than earlier ones. I have also attempted a fresh evaluation of all the evidence with the particular intention of reducing the number of doubtful attributions, and establishing a dependable bibliography of Thackeray's contributions to Fraser's . The second list in this article includes eighty-eight items which are beyond question by Thackeray, as well as four for which there is some substantial evidence that they may be by Thackeray. I include in the first ("disallowed") list all items which have been attributed to Thackeray, but for which there is no reliable evidence. Perhaps the most important reason for the confusion of which I have been speaking has been the long delay in both the publication of Thackeray's Letters and the writing of a dependable biography; 5 certainly we are concerned here with the clarification of one of many biographical and bibliographical problems which clog the path of Thackeray studies. But there are two specific difficulties which tend to confuse the particular question of the Fraser's contributions: there is much legitimate doubt about Thackeray's connection with the magazine from 1832 to 1837, and there are large differences in practice in respect to the validity of internal evidence in determining authorship of anonymous work. It is necessary to comment briefly on both of these problems before presenting the bibliography. Thackeray began contributing regularly to Fraser's in November 1837, using the first of what was to become a dozen or so fanciful pseudonyms, Charles Yellowplush, Esq. Before that date he may have written a number of anonymous pieces, but the only contribution of which we can be sure is the ballad "Il était un Roi d'Yvetot," which was included in the rambling "Fraser Papers for May [1834]" and was later revised for publication in Thackeray's Paris Sketch Book (1840). Most of the items in dispute were printed anonymously in Fraser's from 1830 to 1838, and have posed almost irresistible temptations to bibliographers to credit the good ones to their man. With so little evidence available, it is easy to give too much weight to the few facts we have which connect Thackeray to the periodical. Fraser's was founded in 1830 by "Doctor" William Maginn (1793-1842), along with Hugh Fraser, and James Fraser, the publisher. Maginn was the editor and guiding spirit of the magazine until drink and debts began seriously to limit his effectiveness in 1837. 6 Thackeray records in his diary that he met Maginn 16 April 1832, and subsequently came to know, like, and respect him. 7 Much has been made of this connection, and it does seem reasonable that Maginn would have welcomed contributions from Thackeray's pen. In addition, a portrait of "The Fraserians" by Daniel Maclise, published in the January 1835 issue, shows Thackeray seated between Percival Banks and Jack Churchill, "Maginn's special aides-de-camp." 8 But to the fact of the Maclise portrait, so often cited, must be added the fact that a list of "Fraserians" published in January, 1836 (p. 4) fails to include Thackeray, although it is apparently quite comprehensive. The evidence, then, for Thackeray's association with Fraser's before 1837 is quite slim. It is altogether possible that "Il était un Roi d'Yvetot" and a portion of esprit de corps were sufficient for his inclusion in the portrait — which also included James Hogg and several others not in London, and the deceased Reverend Edward Irving and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. 9 And it is one thing to say that Thackeray and Maginn were close friends, even professional friends ("Dr Maginn called &amp; took me to the Standard shewing me the mysteries of printing &amp; writing leading articles, with him all day till 4" 10 ) and quite another to assign Thackeray articles in, or leading editorial functions for, the magazine. All the same, it is possible that Thackeray published more than the one ballad in Fraser's during this time, and perhaps some day more evidence will appear to allow us to add these items to the Thackeray bibliography. At the present time, however, only internal evidence can be brought to substantiate the many attributions that have been made to Thackeray for this period. That internal evidence is an untrustworthy guide to authorship has been demonstrated so frequently it can virtually rest as an indisputable principle for the bibliographer of nineteenth century periodicals. Mr. Walter Houghton has discovered about six thousand contributors writing for periodicals from 1825-1900; with so many magazine writers at work, it is usually quite unrealistic to attribute unsigned work to any one author because of "characteristic" language, or sentence structure, or sentiments. Certainly such internal evidence is of considerable importance to help support or deny an attribution based on some other source, but only rarely can it stand by itself as any sort of proof. In many cases "internal evidence" becomes a matter of intuition and guesswork, and too often it emerges as a selective process to support a presupposition. The extraordinary diversity of opinion among Thackeray bibliographers is perhaps enough evidence of the unreliability of internal evidence, but it would be easy to multiply instances of obvious errors stemming from this cause (see list of disallowed attributions below, particularly June, 1834; December, 1836; and January, 1840). But perhaps the history of "Elizabeth Brownrigge" (Aug.-Sept. 1832) can stand as an example of the inadequacy of internal evidence and an illustration of how it can mislead those who rely on it too heavily. "Elizabeth Brownrigge" is a parody of the popular novels of criminal life and has seemed to many critics to foreshadow Thackeray's "Catherine" and "Barry Lyndon" — both published some years later in Fraser's , and both inspired in part by Eugene Aram and other Newgate novels. "Elizabeth Brownrigge" is assigned to Thackeray with all confidence by three of the bibliographers (Shepherd, Anderson, Van Duzer) and with various expressions of uncertainty by three others (Benjamin, Elwin, Gulliver), and it has been reprinted in a number of Thackeray editions. 11 One would therefore expect to find some evidence that connects Thackeray to the parody. But all that can be said for this connection has been summarized with his usual good sense by George Saintsbury: "While I certainly shall never be so rash as to say Thackeray did not write it, I can see not the slightest evidence that he did." 12 We might go a step further and add that neither Thackeray's diary for 1832, nor a letter to his mother dated 8 August 1832 mention "Elizabeth Brownrigge", though both of them speak of matters that would have been of much less importance or interest to them. 13 It is against this background of no evidence for his authorship and strong presumptive evidence against the possibility, that the attributions on internal evidence begin to seem forced. Dr. John Brown, who came to know Thackeray intimately in 1851, 14 first associated "Elizabeth Brownrigge" with Thackeray in a memorial article in The North British Review (Feb., 1864). But he claimed no word from the author as his authority, saying only "the internal evidence seems to us strong." This reasoning was supported by Algernon Swinburne, who wrote R. H. Shepherd, "Just before 'Catherine' [i.e., seven years before] appeared another burlesque and grotesque horror — 'Elizabeth Brownrigge,' a story in two parts, which ought to be Thackeray's, for, if it is not, he stole the idea, and to some extent the style, of his parodies on novels of criminal life, from this first sketch of the kind." 15 (Both Maginn and Douglas Jerrold had previously published similar parodies). Most recently, Ernest Boll has presented a closely argued case for Thackeray's authorship from internal evidence: Our study of Elizabeth Brownrigge for proof of Thackeray's authorship rests upon our knowledge of the truism that a writer is a personality whose distinctive traits as they are revealed in his writings tend to undergo with the passing of time as little change as do the distinctive features of his body. This burlesque novel, when compared to the known writings of Thackeray, yields a heavy harvest of those great and small similarities and reiterations that are the best available evidence of an identical personality. 16 Such a "proof" tends to overlook the fact that different authors may have similar styles, and we must, remembering Calvin Hoffman's "proof" that Marlowe wrote Shakespeare's plays, 17 consider such a method with some suspicion. Starting from this most shaky premise, Mr. Boll goes on to give a long set of parallels, with interpretations ranging from the routine (the parody is the work of "a writer to whom satire was congenial") to the perceptive (in the parody we find a sympathy for the villain similar to that in Barry Lyndon and Catherine ) to the absurd (two similar episodes join "Elizabeth Brownrigge" and The Adventures of Philip [1861] — in both a returning lover fondles his loved one's dog — and this resemblance leads to "the conclusion that some experience in Thackeray's youth furnished a common origin for these two episodes"). Mr. Boll concludes that he is "convinced" that Thackeray wrote "Elizabeth Brownrigge." But the internal evidence itself has led to other conclusions. Benjamin, after including the parody in the 1899 edition of his biography, changed his mind in his 1910 revision. There he summarized the evidence to date and found it inconclusive, finally abandoning the theory because "Elizabeth Brownrigge" is so clearly out of position in the Thackeray canon: "If he did write 'Elizabeth Brownrigge' in July 1832, how is it that he did not follow up this ambitious start?" 18 (But, no doubt through some oversight, the parody remained listed [as doubtful] in the appended bibliography). Indeed, the internal evidence which seems so indisputably to stamp the piece as Thackeray's to Brown, Swinburne, and Boll, and which Benjamin and C. P. Johnson 19 (and I) consider quite inconclusive, seems to Thrall to identify it as William Maginn's 20 and to M. H. Spielmann to establish it as Douglas Jerrold's. 21 We cannot take the space here to discuss in detail the complexities of these arguments, but the one fact that seems to emerge beyond question from the long dispute is that the method of "proving" authorship by internal evidence is quite untrustworthy as a basis for attribution unsupported by some other kind of evidence. When Thackeray wrote to his mother, apologizing for his failure to send her copies of his newspaper articles, "Most likely you'll see the best of the articles in Galignani and of course will put down all the good ones to me," 22 he showed an awareness of the problems of internal evidence that his bibliographers would do well to heed.</field>

But she is speaking from her erroneous supposition that Thackeray was an active Fraserian in 1834 and a too great readiness to accept an editorial "we" as a personal one. Thackeray gave up The National Standard ("by w h I shall have had the pleasure of losing £200 — It has increased in sale about 20 in the last 2 months —") 23 in February 1834 and "seems to have devoted most of his time to the study of painting." 24 His letters before February 1834 are filled with expressions of annoyance at the time-consuming nature of his work on the Standard , e.g., "The only fault I find with the N.

[This puzzling work has been assigned to Thackeray on the strength of a letter signed "Fitzroy Yellowplush" which appears at the opening of the second part (p. 597) to deny his authorship. The "Passages" is in fact a parody of Lady Charlotte Campbell Bury's Diary Illustrative of the Times of George the Fourth (1838) — called "Lady Carry-the-Candle's Diary " by the parodist (p. 472) and a succès de scandale at the time — and the confusing editorial apparatus of the original is consistently burlesqued. "Yellowplush" had reviewed Lady Bury's gossipy Diary brilliantly in March, 1838 for Fraser's ("Skimmings from the Dairy of George IV"), and it seems improbable that Thackeray would descend to this feeble writing on the same subject a few months later. Although the letter on p. 597 is facetious, and is roughly parallel to the deliberately confusing editorial tricks about authorship, there is every reason to believe that Thackeray intended the letter to mean what it seems to mean — that he did not write this parody and did not want it attributed to him.

      <field name="fulltext">III Thackeray's Contributions to Fraser's Four of the following items are listed as doubtful: "A Word on the Annuals," December, 1837; "Horae Catnachianae," April, 1839; "William Ainsworth and Jack Sheppard," February, 1840; and "Mr. Thackeray in the United States," January, 1853. The degree of doubt is noted under each entry, but the four are included in this list because significant (if not conclusive) evidence points to Thackeray in each case.

Nine contributions were not printed in that edition, but were included in The Works of Thackeray , Barry Furniss Centenary edition [ed. Lewis Benjamin], 20 vols. (Macmillan &amp; Co., London, 1911), called below Furniss ed. Four of the articles below have not been reprinted. The evidence, unless otherwise noted, consists of references to Gordon N.

[The only evidence consists of a footnote, p. 760, to "Our friend Mr. Yellowplush" who "has made inquiries" about authorship of one of the tales in the Keepsake . One would like to accept this review as Thackeray's, as have all previous bibliographers, 27 for it is brilliant writing which expresses his known sentiments. And the "Yellowplush" correspondence, which began in November and was to continue monthly January-August in 1838, seems strangely absent from this December issue. However, it is altogether possible that the editor added the footnote to another writer's review — and other Fraser's contributors could write brilliantly — to remind his readers that more "Yellowplush" papers were to come. If we credit the above footnote, what are we to do with the one on the preceding page, which maintains that the author "obtained his intimate knowledge of Persian in a forty-three years' residence at Ispahan"?

[This review of nine Christmas books, including The Battle of Life by Dickens and Mrs. Perkins's Ball by "Titmarsh," seems to have been in some measure a collaboration with George Henry Lewes. In January, Lewes received £9/9 for "'Cayetano' (Agnes) &amp; Titmarsh" from Fraser's . 28 Lewes could not have written the entire review, for, internal evidence aside, Agnes Lewis received from Fraser's £9/7 for fiction in the March issue of about the same length as the "Cayetano" tale in January's issue. (See also Letters , II, 264, for clear evidence of Thackeray's authorship.) Lewes must have contributed a paragraph or so to the "Titmarsh" review for the few shillings extra he received. But it is hard to say where these lines are: the article is unified throughout by the style and personality of "Titmarsh", which is nowhere more characteristic than in the single paragraph devoted to his own book. But Lewes could have imitated the "Titmarsh" style, and the most likely explanation is that he did so in response to some delicacy on Thackeray's part about speaking of his own work under the "Titmarsh" byline.] 1853 [?] January (xlvii, 100-103) Mr. Thackeray in the United States. To the Editor of Fraser's Magazine . [Signed "John Small."] Works , XXV, 457-463. [This brief article begins with some facetious remarks about Thackeray's reception in the United States, then gives a seven-paragraph parody of a New York newspaper description of his person and manners, and concludes with an excerpt from Thackeray's last lecture in New York (December 6, 1852) — highly complimentary to his hosts. Although the signature "John Small" is an unlikely pseudonym, it is hard to imagine anyone else writing the parody. The internal evidence, then, is very convincing, but, without external support, the authorship of the article must remain in doubt.] 29</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Miriam M. H. Thrall ( Rebellious Fraser's [1934], 55-80) feels Thackeray learned how to write satire at Fraser's . While this extreme view of the importance of the relationship is unfounded — based as it is on an erroneous supposition of Thackeray's editorial role —, there can be no question that the Fraser's period helped shape at least the working habits of the novelist. See Gordon N. Ray, Thackeray: The Uses of Adversity (1955), pp. 196, 198, 201. 2 Uses of Adversity , note 13, p. 469, refers to Gulliver's outdated Thackeray's Literary Apprenticeship as "the best study of the tangled bibliography of Thackeray's early years." 3 Ed.

Hereafter referred to as Letters . 4 I would like to express my particular debt to Professor Houghton, who has made available to me the working apparatus of The Wellesley Index to Victorian Periodicals, and has been generous with his counsel. 5 See Uses of Adversity , chap. 1, for a detailed account of the difficulties Thackeray's prohibition of a biography has placed in the way of those who have attempted to assess his work. 6 For information on Maginn see Thrall, pp. 161-244. 7 Letters , I, 191, 192, 197, 200, 207, ff. 8 Thrall, pp. 59, 61.

      <field name="heading_text">The Costs of Mathew Carey's Printing Equipment by Rollo G. Silver</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fortunately, Mathew Carey preserved many of the bills he paid. These state the costs of his equipment as well as the expenses of maintenance. Furthermore, they reveal the sources of supply available to a printer in Philadelphia at the end of the eighteenth century and in the beginning of the nineteenth. At that time, the present-day printers' wholesale supply house with its large stock did not exist. Therefore, Carey and the other American printers had to depend upon a variety of craftsmen. By identifying these men and noting the prices they charged, one can obtain an insight into printing house management of the period. The history of printing is filled with proof that the production of printed matter has always required a sizeable investment. Some printers, like Gutenberg, borrowed money to get started; a few acquired their shops by marrying the widows of printers; other printers depended on patrons for subsidies. And then, of course, there were the courageous men with slender resources who managed to set up on their own. Mathew Carey was one of these. Having determined to emigrate because of possible new prosecution for attacking the Irish government in his Volunteer's Journal , Carey, then twenty-four years old, landed in Philadelphia on November 1, 1784. In his Autobiography , he described his financial situation: Behold me now landed in Philadelphia, with about a dozen guineas in my pocket, without relation, or friend, and even without an acquaintance, except my compagnons de voyage , of whom very few were eligible associates. While I was contemplating a removal into the country, where I could have boarded at about a dollar, or a dollar and a quarter a week, intending to wait the arrival of my funds, a most extraordinary and unlooked-for circumstance occurred, which changed my purpose, gave a new direction to my views, and, in some degree, colored the course of my future life. It reflects great credit on the Marquess de La Fayette, who was then at Mount Vernon, to take leave of General Washington. A young gentleman of the name of Wallace, a fellow-passenger of mine, had brought letters of recommendation to the General; and having gone to his seat to deliver them, fell into the Marquess's company, and in the course of conversation, the affairs of Ireland came on the tapis. The Marquess, who had, in the Philadelphia papers, seen an account of my adventures with the Parliament, and the persecution I had undergone, inquired of Wallace, what had become of the poor persecuted Dublin printer? He replied, "He came passenger with me, and is now in Philadelphia," stating the boarding-house where I had pitched my tent. On the arrival of the Marquess in this city, he sent me a billet, requesting to see me at his lodgings, whither I went. He received me with great kindness; condoled with me on the persecution I had undergone; inquired into my prospects; — and having told him that I proposed, on the receipt of my funds, to set up a newspaper, he approved the idea, and promised to recommend me to his friends, Robert Morris, Thomas, Fitzsimons, &amp;c. &amp;c. After half an hour's conversation, we parted. Next morning, while I was at breakfast, a letter from him was handed me, which, to my very great surprise, contained four one hundred dollar notes of the Bank of North-America. 1 Lafayette's generosity thus supplied the capital needed to establish a printing office for Carey's projected newspaper. Funds from home did arrive, but the amount was a great disappointment — fifty pounds. 2 In an advertisement dated December 9, Carey "respectfully informs the inhabitants of Philadelphia, that early in January next, he will publish a Newspaper in this city; the terms of which shall be advertised in a few days." 3 Having announced the paper, he found himself required to obtain a press in as short a time as possible. But presses were scarce and Carey's situation increasingly serious, when he learned that the shop of the late Robert Bell was to be sold at auction. The announcement of this sale, scheduled for December 28, included, among the items to be sold, a complete mahogany printing press, "little the worse for wear." 4 Carey saw his opportunity, but, at the sale, he had an unexpectedly difficult time: As the press was very old, and very much impaired in usefulness, I expected to have it a bargain. But Colonel Oswald, who printed the Independent Gazetteer, and who viewed my operations with a jealous eye, commenced that hostility, which, ultimately, as will appear in the sequel, nearly cost me my life. He bid against me; and as I had absurdly fixed on a day for publication which was so near that I had not time to procure a new press, he continued bidding till he raised the price to about fifty pounds currency, or, one hundred and thirty-three dollars, being one third of my whole fortune, and about the price of a new press. 5 One wishes that this vignette of the sale contained more detail, for it certainly was one of the most interesting auctions in the history of American printing. On the block was the shop of the well-known, if not notorious, Robert Bell; the opposing bidders were an established newspaper publisher and an upstart Irishman who later became one of the greatest of American book publishers. The hostility which began on that day eventually resulted in a duel in which Carey received a serious wound in the thigh although Oswald was uninjured. Despite Oswald's attempt to thwart him, Carey managed to bid in the components needed for his shop. They are listed in the bill which he preserved: Philad a . Dec r . 31 st 1784 M r Mathew Carey.

A receipt proves that he paid off the note on March 4, 1785. Within four weeks of the auction, his shop was in production; on January 25, 1785, Carey's Pennsylvania Evening Herald , a semi-weekly, appeared and Carey's distinguished American career had begun. By January 1, 1817, when he made his son a partner, he had published more than six hundred and fifty editions of books, exclusive of the Bibles and Testaments which made him "the foremost printer and publisher of the Bible in America during the first quarter of the nineteenth century." 7 Not all of his imprints came from his own press, but many did. The process of producing them required constant renewal and repair of equipment. For the purpose of this paper, it is neither possible nor sensible to print every bill Carey preserved. Many are repetitious; others are unclear. A sampling will be adequate to indicate sources of supply and costs. It should be noted that the period covered by this investigation ends at the time Carey admitted his son to partnership. A few of Carey's printing presses were acquired from men who were not press manufacturers. About the time that John Watts closed his "Literary Publication Office" in Philadelphia and moved to New York where he became one of the first, if not the first, of American stereotypers, he sold some of his equipment to Carey. The bill, October 28, 1806, includes an English press at $41.50, an American press at $20.00, 9 pairs of cases for $7.87½ as well as an imposing stone and frame for $5.50. John Vallance, the engraver, sold Carey a press on July 10, 1813, for $100.00 and on the same bill he gave twenty per cent discount for a standing press at $30.00 and a cutting press at $13.00. These "special situations" provided bargains, but Carey also bought presses from the manufacturers. On May 25, 1792, he obtained one for $60.00 from John Hamilton who, four years later, advertised that "he had supplied many New Jersey and New York printers with presses of a very good quality that he could make for others on three weeks' notice at a cost of seventy-five dollars each." 8 In 1804, a few years after Henry Ouram, a former blacksmith, opened his "Printing Press manufactory" in Philadelphia, Carey paid him $115.00 for a press. 9 Ouram, as will be seen later, also had other transactions with Carey, but the greatest single share of Carey's press equipment and repair orders went to Adam Ramage. By the 1830's, Ramage had become, as Hamilton says in his fine study, "the Ford of the printing press industry." 10 However, his ability as a craftsman was recognized by Carey soon after Ramage commenced to work with presses. In 1801, among other jobs, he charged Carey 3 s 3 d for repairing a "Lying Press" and sold him a "Plough with Iorn [ sic ] &amp; Knife" for 1/2/6. During the next few years, he sold him various supplies such as twelve feet of brass rule for 15 s , one hundred quoins for .67, "Mallat planner &amp; Shooting Stick" for 5 s 6 d . And, in 1805, he sold Carey a mahogany printing press "compleat" for $130.00 as well as a standing press for $61.00. As Carey's shop increased in size, Ramage was frequently called upon. By 1807, when it was a five-press shop, a Ramage statement read: 1807 March 10 To 2 pair of Points .80 18 To a Mallat &amp; planner .67 To Work at Press .37½ April 12 To a pair of points .40 14 &amp; 16 To planing 2 plattings .50 May 1 To 8 feet Brass rule &amp;c.mmat; 15 cts 1.20 18 To oil cup &amp; Die steeling point of screw 1.25 June 8 To 100 quoins .67 16 To 6 feet Rule &amp;c.mmat; 15 .90 July 14 To a pair of ball stocks .75 Sept r . 15 To work at Timpans hooks &amp; Eys [?] planing a platting &amp;c .80 To a pair of Points .40 October 5 &amp; 9 To 2 pair ball stocks 1.50 10 &amp; 20 To planing 2 plattings cutting one at 3 times 84 yd s .

More interesting is the attention given to the platen. In a statement of the following year, one finds a different variety of jobs: May 5 To a pair of Points .40 8 To Staying 3 Presses .75 To a new Set of Cramps put on 2.50 10 To Smith work at bolts &amp;c .40 14 To 2 pair ball Stocks 1.50 To Work at Press .30 18 To a pair of Steel points .60 28 To blocks for Press &amp; mending Gally .37½ June 17 To a pair ball Stocks .75 August 8 To planing a platting &amp; 4 blocks .30 12 To a Sleeve pin .30 To a new wood for rounce handle .25 Sept 27 To 3 Bodkins .33 October 13 &amp; 19 To 23 yd s .

Gutter Stick 12 Reglet 2.20 To Press for paper Iron Screw &amp; leaver 32.00 Hardly a month went by without some sort of work being needed. If Ramage was not called in to stay a press or supply a new rounce handle, there was the platen or a new set of cramps or something else that required his skill. This continued year in and year out, as seen in the work for the first six months of 1816: Feb y . 14 To planing a platting .25 26 To planing &amp; cutting one Ditto .50 To mending a frisket .25 March 1 To 3 planners 1.00 6 To a Set of Cramps 3.00 7 To planing a platting .25 16 To a pair of points .50 23 To a pair of Ditto .50 To spurring of Ditto .25 29 To planing a platting .25 April 6 To Laying Stone in plaster 1.50 12 To bolting &amp; planing a platting .75 To Laying Stone in plaster &amp; a new Set of Cramps 4.25 To a new brass bottom Galley 5.00 25 To a pair of Large ball stocks .87½ 27 To planing a platting .25 30 To 4 Ledge Galleys Mohogany [ sic ] &amp;c.mmat; .37½ 1.50 May 13 To planing a large platting .50 To a pair of Large ball stocks .87½ 19 To new wood on Rounce .50 June 3 d To a pair of Large ball stocks .87½ 16 To 100 Quions [ sic ] &amp; a pair of points 1.25 17 To 2 pair of points 1.00 24 To a pair of ball stocks .75 28 To a new slice a balance &amp; a new frisket 3.87½ To 2 pair of point screws &amp; button .75 To mending rounce .50 To a pair of spring points 1.00 Ramage occasionally sold Carey items not mentioned in the above statements. Sample entries for some of them are listed: Feb. 24 1808 To 6 Bearers .25 April 3 1809 To a Sheeps foot .45 Sept. 12 1809 To a Ink block .50 To a Slice Galley 1.00 March 6 1811 To a footstep .25 March 26 1811 To a Composing Stick 2.50 August 14 1813 To 2 pair of Chases lb s . 76 &amp;c.mmat; 33 25.08 Dec. 18 1816 To a Ball rack .37½ All of this business was conducted while Ramage was involved in the manufacture of presses. Besides those already noted, he sold to Carey: July 23 1811 To a Printing Press compleat 130.00 To one Ditto Screw up platting &amp;c 137.00 Dec. 9 1811 To a Standing Press compleat 75.00 June 5 1812 To a Printing Press compleat 130.00 Sept. 27 1813 To a Printing Press compleat screw up platting N o 371 137.00 Aug. 27 1814 To a Bookbinders Cutting Press &amp; plough 13.00 As Hamilton points out, the "screw up platting" may have "referred to a method of fastening the platen by four bolts at the upper corners, instead of by the cord lashings of the common press." 11 Because Ramage's statements often covered work for about a year or more, they clearly show the recurring problems of maintenance. In bills of other artisans, one finds information about some specialized suppliers as well as about those who performed work similar to that of Ramage. Before Ramage started in business as a printers' joiner, Carey depended upon cabinetmakers and metal workers. During his first month in operation, January, 1785, he purchased three galleys for 1/2/6, a dozen side sticks for 6 s , and seventeen yards of reglet for 17 s from William Rigby, a cabinetmaker. 12 Trade with Rigby continued and the following excerpt from a Rigby statement resembles those later submitted by Ramage: 1790 Jan. 15 1 mallet &amp; shuting stick -- 2 3 8 side sticks 3 d 1 planer 1 s /- -- 3 -- Feb. 1 st 3 yards Riglet &amp; Job -- 1 6 6 plaining the pladden -- 1 0 April 9 4 yards Gutter Sticks 5 d 4 d o .

In the meantime, Daniel Dawson, a whitesmith, also supplied help and equipment. 13 In December, 1787, he mended a frisket for 1 s 6 d and made one for 10 s . Four years later, his statement contained such items as: 4 th M o . 12 th To Mending 1 Frisket -- 1 -- 4 th M o . 17 th To 1 Large Rod for Press 2 f 8 -- 2 6 28 To Mending 1 Timken -- 1 3 5 th M o . 4 th To Press Handle Mended -- 2 6 13 th To 1 Chace 1 10 -- 17 To 1 Timken Iron Mended -- 2 -- 7 th M o . 10 th To 1 Chace 1 10 -- To 3 Half Joints for a Frisket -- 4 6 Surprisingly enough, neither William Bryden whom the American Dictionary of Printing and Bookmaking refers to as "an early maker of presses in Philadelphia," nor John Goodman, mentioned as a press-maker by McCulloch, appear to have received much business from Carey. 14 Bryden's bills of 1792 and 1794 include charges for a mallet at 2 s , setting up a printing press for 7 s 6 d , putting on a set of cramps for 3 s 9 d ; Goodman, in 1794, presented two bills for, among other things, a new frisket at 13 s 6 d , a set of brass cramps for 17 s 6 d , and a set of brass linings for the hose at 7 s 6 d . Press repairs were also made, during the early years by John Aitken, the printer, bookseller, and silversmith, by James Hendricks, a cutler who, in 1793, supplied a pair of points and mended a frisket for 5 s 7½ d , and by Milne &amp; Price whose bill reads: 15 1789 3 mo 6 To Box &amp; Screw for Printing Press 5 0 0 To mending frisket &amp; altering thumb Piece -- 1 6 18 To mending frisket -- 1 0 5 mo 5 To Repairing Rounce of Press -- 1 6 While these mechanics kept the presses in running order, Carey increased the equipment of the shop. From John Sidleman, a stonecutter, he bought, in March, 1787, an imposing stone for 2/6/10 and a stone for a press for 1/6/10. 16 In the same month, Hall &amp; Adgate sold him a pair of "Letter cases" for 17 s 6 d , a sink and water trough for 1/13/9, and "1 paper &amp; 1 Letter Board" for 6 s . Later in the year, John Cushing sold him, among other things, ten pairs of cases at 16 s 8 d a pair and three composing sticks for 3 s 9 d . The price of cases varied but slightly at that time; in 1790, John Fimeton, a house carpenter, supplied four pairs at 15 s per pair. 17 Similarly, the price of reglet remained constant for a while — 4 d per yard from Jacob Wayne, a cabinetmaker, in 1787 and 1788 and, as already noted, from William Rigby in 1790. 18 On the other hand, in the same bills, Wayne charged 9 d per yard for gutter sticks and Rigby charged 5 d , a difference which may have been based on the quality of the wood. The inking apparatus, of course, required constant renewal. Between 1787 and 1794, pelts and wool came from Joseph Rogers, "parchment-maker, glue boiler." 19 One or two pelts were usually purchased every month at 2 s per pelt until May, 1790, at 2 s 6 d thereafter until March, 1792, when the price became 3 s . Six to twelve pounds of wool sufficed for a year, the price varying from 1 s 3 d to 2 s 6 d per pound. Rogers also provided Carey with parchment skins for the tympans; these cost 3 s 9 d each in 1787, 4 s 2 d in 1790, 5 s in 1791, but they were not replaced very often. Neither were ballstocks. When Carey needed them, he could always obtain them from a turner. In 1814, Edwin Barry charged $3.75 for three pairs of gumwood ballstocks. In an archive such as this one comes across bills with a bit of mystery about them. What, for instance, were the six "Printer's Candlesticks" bought from James Truman, a coppersmith, in 1794 for 1 s each? 20 Perhaps a spike at the base, enabling the printer to place it over the case, distinguished the printer's candlestick. Another bill implies that Carey attempted casting: March 7 th 1803 M r Mathew Carey To Henry Voight D r . $ C t To Brass Moulds for Casting Spaces with coares at 9 Doll per piece 18 -- To dito dito [ sic ] for dito without coares at 6 Doll per piece 12 -- It may be noted that since Voight, at that time, worked at the Mint as Chief Coiner, he either used government property or did some moonlighting. He must have been a rather independent employee; in 1796, when called upon to answer charges for leaving the Mint without permission, he declared that "I did not go altogether on my own account in the country." 21 That Carey ever used these molds cannot be ascertained, yet it is difficult to believe that he would have paid for them and turned them over to Binny &amp; Ronaldson for casting. When the Bible projects started, more chases were needed most of which came from the whitesmith, David Scott. 22 The first recorded large shipment, billed on January 30, 1802, comprised 250 chases for 356/12/3 (4509 lbs. &amp;c.mmat; 1 s 7 d ). In a second large purchase, shipped between August 19 and October 21, 1803, Carey obtained 78 chases for 109/4/8. In addition to these, there were smaller orders, some delivered by Scott to printers working for Carey rather than to his own shop. Though Ramage received many of Carey's press and press repair orders after the turn of the century, Henry Ouram managed to get some, too. It will be recalled that he sold Carey a press in 1804. In the same year and during four years thereafter, his sales included 50 quoins (2 s 6 d in 1804), a few composing sticks (18 s 9 d each in 1805), a few chases (2 s 9 d per lb. in 1807). His repair jobs included facing two platens (3 s 9 d in 1804), a pair of points (3 s in 1805), and repairing a rounce handle (1 s in 1805). Ramage and Ouram could work with wood and metal, but stone was evidently beyond their capacities. Occasionally Ramage would lay a stone in plaster; Ouram's bills make no mention of stone. If such work was required, a stonecutter executed the job. Because the stonecutter needed no specialized skill to meet the requirements of the printer, Carey had no difficulty in acquiring press stones or composing stones. Press stones, of course, required maintenance, as may be seen in the following: 1805 March 22 John Miller 23 To a Composing stone by agreement 7.00 Porterage .25 1806 Nov. 4 Richard North 24 To facing a press stone 1.50 1807 Oct. 7 Moore &amp; Herkness 25 To rubbing 1 press stone 1.00 1809 Jan. 7 John Sanson 26 for one Press Stone and Laying in plaster 5.75 1810 Oct. 9 John Sanson Facing two Press Stones 2.00 Laying one in Plaster .75 1811 March 11 John Sanson for one Press Stone Lade in Plaster 5.75 Dec. 3 John Sanson for facing a Press-Stone and Laying 1.75 1812 April 23 John Sanson for one Press Stone 5.00 Laying in Plaster .75 1816 Oct. 12 Alexander Napier 27 for a marble Press Stone 6.50 Oct. 18 Isaac B. Garrigues 28 To Sanding and fixing a Press Stone with Plaster Paris 2.50 Additional equipment came to the shop from the estates of deceased printers. For example, in 1806, Carey purchased fifty-two yards of furniture at three cents per yard and three pairs of cases for two dollars per pair from the estate of William Spotswood. One year later, Hannah Spotswood sold Carey two frames for five dollars as well as some more cases at a dollar and a half and two dollars per pair. The purchase of printing type incurred far greater expenses throughout the history of the firm. In one of his first transactions, on the day before the Bell auction, Moore &amp; Rhea, importers, sold Carey 508½ lbs. for 63/11/3 — a sum greater than that paid for a press. 29 With the type in the Bell lot plus an additional supply costing nine pounds delivered by Jacob Bay in February of the following year, Carey possessed a stock adequate for the first few years. In 1787, he picked up more from two of his colleagues. Some, including one batch of "a small fount Brevier," quadrats, and "Sundry sorts" totaling 165 lbs. for 34/7/6 came from Joseph James, a Philadelphia printer. Another Philadelphian, Benjamin Franklin, sold Carey about 500 lbs. of the small pica Franklin brought from France and which had been returned to him by Francis Childs — a story which will be recorded by Professor Labaree in forthcoming volumes of The Papers of Benjamin Franklin . But the expanded business necessitated a further increase. The following two bills from Richard Vaux, merchant, show sizeable amounts of type, probably imported by Vaux: 30 I. 336 Long Primer 1/6 25 -- 4 -- 8 Brevier flowers 2/6 1 -- -- 2 Boxes 2/. 4 ------------------- 26 -- 8 Advance 120 pCent 31 13 -- 7 ----------------- £58 -- 1 -- 7 Philad a . 16th June 1787 II. 3 Boxes Printing Types C Cont g . 445.8 Long Primer on Burgeois 2/ 44 -- 11 -- 4.0 Two line Letters 1/ -- 4 -- 3 Boxes -- 6 -- ------------------- 45 -- 1 -- 1 Box D o .

This meant that Carey could obtain type frequently and without the delay of importation. The Baine statements disclose that deliveries were sometimes very frequent; in the month of November, 1789, the Baines submitted thirteen bills. Though the foundry did its best to accommodate Carey, the minimal orders caused an occasional comment. In 1790, the younger Baine delivered 51½ lbs. of English at 1 s 9 d per pound with a note on the statement: "It was impossible for me to cast a less quantity of the English than what I have done without charging an additional price." Two years later, he wrote that he had to charge 3 s per pound for some two-line English sorts "on acct. of the small quantity which occasion'd so much more trouble." The Baine prices varied only slightly, as seen in these examples of costs: Per Pound s d Nov. 6 1789 Small pica 2 1 May 11 1792 Small pica 2 2 Aug. 10 1791 Long primer 2 10 June 23 1792 Pica 2 -- July 9 1792 Bourgeois 3 7 Aug. 26 1792 Brevier 4 6 Aug. 26 1792 English 1 10½ Dec. 5 1793 Long primer 3 -- Despite its advantages, the local foundry could not meet all of Carey's requirements. He continued to buy other type, domestic and imported. Of domestic type, sorts were acquired from Justus Fox as late as 1794, though it is apparent from the absence of bills that only a small amount of type came from him. Imported type arrived by way of other members of the Philadelphia book trade as well as by direct shipment. The box of imported type purchased from Zachariah Poulson, Jr., the Philadelphia printer, in 1792 was probably part of a joint venture. One year later, Carey began to receive type from the Glasgow foundry of Dr. Alexander Wilson &amp; Sons, the financing being negotiated through Carey's London agent, George Barclay &amp; Co. From Wilson, he received over seven hundred pounds of pica, over five hundred pounds of long primer, over two hundred pounds of brevier, and some two-line letters. The bill for small pica purchased bears a note about the duty charged: Aside from a few transactions with fellow-printers, Carey seems to have kept his stock fairly constant for a few years. Then, about the beginning of the nineteenth century, his trade with the recently established foundry of Binny &amp; Ronaldson began to grow. From that time on, the firm of Binny &amp; Ronaldson was Carey's chief source of supply. At one period, Carey's account reached surprisingly large proportions: according to a statement of type delivered between March 12, 1803, and March 3, 1804, Carey owed $6,806.20 on the total of $9,874.59. Ten thousand dollars worth of type in one year remains an impressive amount today. Not all of this type went to Carey's own shop; most of it was delivered directly to printers who worked for him. An excerpt from a bill containing such items is this: 1803 lb oz Deliver'd to &amp;c.mmat; March 30 6 12 Pica Small Pica Palmers .42 2.83½ " 7 1 ditto Aitken " 2.96½ April 1 21 -- Small Pica Way " 8.82 " 3 13 P Small Pica Aitken " 1.60 5 1 9 Superior P S P Way .88 1.37½ 7 19 13 Small Pica d o . .42 8.32 11 3 3 Superior -- P Sm Pica Adams .88 2.80½ 15 20 -- Small Pica Way .42 8.40 10 1 P Sm P Palmers " 4.22½ For the bibliographer, the most useful information in this series of Binny &amp; Ronaldson bills lies in the prices rather than in the amount of type purchased. Here one can observe variations from year to year in much greater detail than that provided by the published price lists. Some of the most significant prices are: Per lb. Jan. 11, 1802 Pica .38 Jan. 27, 1802 Pica small pica .42 April 1, 1802 Nonpareil 1.34 August 30, 1802 Brevier .70 Great primer .36 Oct. 7, 1802 Long primer .50 April 22, 1803 Two-line pica small pica .36 June 6, 1803 Bourgeois .60 Sept. 30, 1803 English .38 March 19, 1804 Great primer .38 Sept. 3, 1804 Bourgeois .63 Oct. 8, 1804 Pica small pica .45 Dec. 1, 1804 Nonpareil 1.37 March 2, 1805 Brevier .73 Dec. 5, 1805 Pica .41 Oct. 15, 1807 Pica small pica .48 Jan. 19, 1808 Long primer .56 April 29, 1808 Minion 1.03 May 17, 1811 Great primer .52 June 13, 1811 Nonpareil 1.75 In addition to printing type, Binny &amp; Ronaldson sold Carey metal blocks (1 s each in 1800 and .50 per lb. in 1811), presumably for cuts, and bookbinder's sorts (in 1815, $1.90 for a set in one size with 40 figures). Old type was sold back to Binny &amp; Ronaldson — $11.00 per cwt. in 1807. Despite the large bills from Binny &amp; Ronaldson, Carey did not restrict himself to that firm. Sometimes he paid for the type of a particular job, as in these two bills from Thomas Kirk, the New York printer: I. 1803 Jan. 5 To 853 lb Types &amp;c.mmat; 30 Cents p r . lb for Columbian Spelling Book $255.90 To 121000 ms Composition for D o &amp;c.mmat; 46 Cents p r . 1000 55.81 II. August 1, 1807 To Types for Child's Instructor $200 -- To Press work of one thousand D o at 50 Cents 18 Carey also acquired type from Robert Carr, the Philadelphia printer, at bargain prices, probably because the type had been used. Two examples may be cited: in 1802, Carr sold him pica small pica (800 lbs. &amp;c.mmat; .30) when Binny &amp; Ronaldson's price was much higher; six years later, Carr charged .37½ for long primer as compared with the Binny &amp; Ronaldson price of .56 per pound. But these and others were small deals; for more extensive purchases, Carey remained faithful to Binny &amp; Ronaldson although he did not have to do so. About 1804, Samuel Sower had established a foundry in Baltimore and, by 1808, enjoyed a prosperous trade. Yet, with the exception of one relating to old type which William McCulloch sold to Sower for Carey, no Sower-Carey bills have been preserved. This certainly implies that Carey was well satisfied with the Philadelphia founders. Ink, being of relatively simple manufacture, seems to have been readily available from printers as well as inkmakers. According to a bill of October 22, 1785, John Albright, a printer, sold some ink (11½ lbs. &amp;c.mmat; 2 s 9 d ) to Carey. During Carey's first ten years in Philadelphia, other printers and Justus Fox, the typefounder and inkmaker of Germantown, supplied ink, too, but Francis Wrigley, a printer and inkmaker, received most of the orders. For example, between January 7 and June 14, 1791, he sold Carey 49 pounds at 2 s 6 d per pound. This price, a net price with an extra charge for the keg if supplied, prevailed until 1796 when charges of 3 s , 3 s 3 d , and 3 s 6 d begin to appear. At this period, the ink was occasionally designated as summer ink or winter ink though there was no difference in price. In 1802, Thomas Condie provided two grades: printing ink at 3 s per pound and best book ink at 3 s 3 d . Three years later, Francis Wrigley also billed ink at different prices (.40 and .50 per lb.), but he did not specify the difference. This did not last long, at least as far as Carey is concerned, for Wrigley's bills soon contained only one price, forty cents, which, in March, 1807, was increased by five cents. By this time, the volume of purchases had increased so that, between February 7 and December 24, 1806, Wrigley sold over seven hundred pounds to Carey. The successor firm, Wrigley &amp; Johnson, maintained this high volume with Carey. In 1813, the price dropped back to forty cents per pound with random sales at forty-five and fifty cents. After the dissolution of Wrigley &amp; Johnson, Carey gave most of his business to Charles Johnson from whom he purchased over a thousand pounds in 1815. Johnson, in 1817, still charged forty cents per pound but his best book ink commanded ten cents more. Carey's purchases from other firms were negligible. The vendors thus far mentioned comprise a group one would expect to find supplying equipment for a nineteenth century American printer. But for woodworking Carey also employed men seldom, if ever, mentioned as making printing house items, namely, the inmates of the local prison. Perhaps because, having been in jail himself, Carey sympathized with them and wanted to help in some way. Perhaps it was simply because the prices were lower. For whatever reason, the Philadelphia Prison, between 1802 and 1816, made hundreds of boxes for shipping books in addition to various printing house supplies. Some examples are taken from the bills: Nov. 11, 1808 To making 15 Press Boards &amp;c.mmat; 10 Cts. 1.50 Dec. 14, 1810 To making a Slanting Box for Printing office .37½ Oct. 24, 1811 To 7 Small press boards .14 Feb. 19, 1812 To 12 press boards 18 cts. 2.16 Oct. 1, 1813 To making 10 Press boards &amp;c.mmat; 18 1.80 To making 5 Type Boxes 37½ 1.87½ To 10 feet Cherry for ditto 3 .30 Nov. 1, 1813 To Making Case for Type drawers 1.00 Nov. 2, 1813 To Making a Case for Type drawers 1.10 July 6, 1816 Making 2 Troughs 25 c .50 July 12, 1816 80 pieces Furniture 3 c 2.40 July 20, 1816 74 pieces Furniture &amp;c.mmat; 3 c 2.22 July 22, 1816 50 " do 2 c 1.00 Aug. 23, 1816 54 Furniture strips &amp;c.mmat; 2 c 1.08 Oct. 26, 1816 2 Mahogany Gally's 1.50 Dec. 31, 1816 350 Quoins ½ c 1.75 The presence of other bills in the Carey Papers for wood delivered to the prison makes it evident that the prison charged for labor only. One cannot resist the temptation to call attention to two minor but rather fascinating items in Carey's overhead expenses. The first concerns the cost of educating apprentices, as seen in these two bills: I. Philadelphia September 25 th 1792 to John Risdel D r M r Carey To 3 Months tuition his apprentice Chrystopher Oneil £ 12/6 II. Philadelphia October 5 th 1792 To John Risdel D r M r Carey To 3 Months tuition his Apprentice Nicholas Fink £ 12/6 The second relates to the professional organization in which Carey participated. It is interesting that the Company of Printers fined members who did not come to meetings: Mr Mathew Carey To the Company of Printers. Dr. 1791 July 4 To admission £ -- . 7. 6 1793 July 4 To 2 fines for non-attendance -- . 3. 9 1794 Jan. 6 To 1 d o . 1.10½ 1795 July 4 To 4 annual payments 1. 10. -- ------------ £2. 3. 1½ Cr 1793 July 1 By cash pd treasurer, 2 fines -- 3. 9 ------------ £1.19. 4½ Received payment for the Comp. D. Humphreys When Carey joined his Philadelphia colleagues in attending the Literary Fair in New York, they paid their share of the cost: New York, June 8, 1802 Rec d of M Carey Ten Dollars on a/c of Messr s . Birch, Small, S. F. Bradford, W. Bradford &amp; W. Duane, being their proportion of Hotel Room, office and other incidental expences of the Fair — James Swords Finally, there is a long series of statements which the foreman of the shop submitted to Carey weekly, usually on Saturdays. These charge the week's work, the foreman's wages, and out-of-pocket disbursements. Once, when Carey was projecting new editions of his quarto and school Bibles, he asked his foreman to estimate production time. Luckily, the reply which has been preserved also reveals the size of the shop: Printing-Office, March 14, 1807. Memorandum. 4to Bible, 135 sheets 1000 copies, 8 tok each 1080 tok. 4 presses, 10 tok each per day 40 | 1080 ------ 27 days School Bible, 20 sheets 10 | 400 tok ------ one press 40 days Note — It is hardly probable the whole number of five presses will average 10 tok. each, per day — on this there ought to be an allowance of a few days. Lewis Blackwell Most of the time of the presses was devoted to Bible work, with the remainder used for smaller jobs. Each of these reports of the foremen is not very important in itself, but the series affords an excellent picture of the week-by-week production entailing frequent purchases of skins, wool, oil, and, in the winter, candles. Therefore, bills of one year, 1807, are printed in the appendix although a selection from 1805 to 1815 might have been made. Students of the history of printing, especially those without experience in a shop, are apt to think that the early nineteenth century printer, equipped with press, ink, type, and paper, could be quite self-sufficient for a while. This manifestly is not true. Even in a one-press shop, oil or wool or something else would have to be obtained or repairs would be required on the press more often than is usually realized. Carey's bills demonstrate these facts of maintenance and must certainly increase our respect for those men who persisted in overcoming one deficiency after another.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Press Figures in America: Some Preliminary Observations by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The study of press figures in recent years has provided an important tool for the bibliographical investigation of eighteenth-century books. Though it has long been known that these figures appeared in English books as early as 1680 and as late as 1823, 1 their significance has not even yet been fully explored; in the studies that have appeared, volumes printed in England have been drawn upon for illustration, and nothing has been said about American practice. Indeed, I have talked with bibliographers who assumed that press figures were not used in America at all, since printing shops in the colonies rarely had more than two presses 2 and their record of work would thus not be difficult to keep in other ways. The matter is less simple, however, and press figures certainly were used, at least by the end of the eighteenth century. An examination of these figures should prove of interest both for what they reveal about American printing practice and for the additional evidence they may hopefully furnish toward clarifying the exact nature of press figures in general. In the course of examining well over a thousand books printed in America between 1775 and 1825, 3 I discovered, first of all, that press figures are in fact quite rare in American books and do not occur with anything like their frequency in English books of the same period. But beyond that, I found that certain printers at certain times did use figures extensively and regularly. Two clusters began to emerge within the group of books I was looking at: certain volumes printed in Philadelphia in the 1790's and others printed in New York in the 1810's. Admittedly the volumes had been chosen, at this stage, on the basis of their availability; which books I came across in various libraries was entirely a matter of chance. The grouping, then, did not constitute a statistically valid random sample; amounting to only one per cent of the books published in America during these years, it may not have been representative in any way. Nevertheless, it did yield nearly one hundred volumes with press figures, a large enough body of evidence on which to base a few tentative observations. 4 In addition, certain procedures made the search somewhat less random than at first appeared. For one thing, when a figured volume was located, other books issued by the same printer were specifically sought out. In some cases (as with Isaac Riley) many figured books were found in this way; in others (as with John Thompson and Jacob Berriman) no further figured books turned up. Second, eighty-one Bibles were examined, representing forty-seven of the printers of English Bibles in America before 1820, on the theory that (1) if a particular printer ever used press figures, he would have been likely to use them in such a long book, 5 and (2) this type of survey would provide a quick index to the practices of a large number of printers. As it turned out, eighteen of these Bibles, the work of seven printers, did contain figures. 6 It should also be pointed out that various kinds of numbers other than press figures may appear in the lower margins of printed pages during these years. This is not the place to survey American practice in using numerals as signatures, but it is of course true that numerals, rather than letters, were increasingly employed as signatures in the early nineteenth century. At the turn of the century numerals were occasionally used in conjunction with letters to register a consecutive count of the quires: Mathew Carey's Bibles, for example, generally have, on the first recto of every gathering, a number in parentheses to the left of the signature—as "(23) Z" followed by "(24) AA". 7 Another kind of figure is the numeral identifying each section of a work to be issued and sold in parts. In John Payne's New and Complete System of Universal Geography (Evans 34316), printed in 1798-1799 by John Low of New York, the fourth verso of each of the first ten gatherings of the text is labeled "No. 1"; quires L through U are marked "No. 2" on $4 v ; X through Gg "No. 3"; and so on—indicating that the work was issued in ten-quire sections. 8 A third kind of figure is that which records the use of standing type: Mathew Carey's early Bibles from standing type sometimes give the number of the impression on $1 r and $3 r (the seventh, 19 August 1805, is an illustration); later a more complicated system is used, with a double figure in parentheses on $1 va (as 26-3 in 1808, 39-1 in 1811, 47-8 or 48-1 in 1813, 83-2 in 1818). 9 Leaving aside all these figures (however intriguing, as those of Mathew Carey undoubtedly are), I shall record in the following pages some of the press figures which I have thus far discovered in American books. The first section will take up a sampling of the work of several printers (all but one from Philadelphia) in the 1790's, giving a more detailed examination of the work of one of them, Thomas Dobson, and of one of his products, the great eighteen-volume Encyclopaedia . The Bibles enter into this section because, with the exception of some of Mathew Carey's Bibles, none of the sixty-nine post-1800 Bibles I examined contained figures. The second section deals with some of the works printed in the 1810's by Isaac Riley of New York (and the related printer Charles Wiley) and again concentrates on one large project, in this case Riley's important series of state supreme court reports. The evidence provided by all these volumes does not, unfortunately, solve the most vexing questions about press figures: the significance of unfigured formes in otherwise figured works, 10 and the identification of the figures as designating machines or men. 11 But the aims of the present survey are less ambitious: to record the press figures in a number of volumes whose figures have not previously been noticed, in the belief that valid conclusions about the nature of press figures (or the distribution of work among pressmen in a given shop at any time) can come only after a large body of data has been accumulated. It is too early to draw many conclusions about American press figures; but the progress toward those conclusions will certainly be facilitated by having a body of evidence readily available and a standardized method for recording it. The present aims, in short, are simply to furnish a starting point, however tentative, for the analysis of American press figures and to supplement, however provisionally, the information already acquired about English press figures. 12</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The practice of using printed figures to keep a record of the work done by particular pressmen 13 was employed extensively in the 1790's by several of the most prolific printers in Philadelphia. Such men as David Hall, William Sellers, and Thomas Dobson were making use of these figures at the beginning of the decade and at its end. One should assume, therefore, since they issued Bibles, statutes of Pennsylvania, and encyclopedias, that a large body of material exists, from which a thorough survey of American press figures can some day be drawn. Only a few works will be examined here, to serve as illustrations of the practice of several different printers at various times throughout the decade. First, three books printed by Hall &amp; Sellers (in 1790, 1791, and 1798) will represent the work of one firm at different times and in different formats; then three Bibles, each by a different printer and in a different format, will provide some comparisons; three books printed by Thomas Dobson will act as an introduction to his great work, the Encyclopaedia ; and, finally, a quick look at the complications of Mathew Carey's Bibles will serve as a transition to the next century. Hall and Sellers, whose names first appeared in joint imprints in 1766, issued in 1790 a duodecimo Book of Common Prayer and Whole Book of Psalms (listed separately in Evans but printed together with continuous signatures). This book, gathered in sixes, contains the figure 1 twenty-four times, in every case on $6 v : 1. Book of Common Prayer and Whole Book of Psalms . Philadelphia: Hall &amp; Sellers, 1790. Evans 22821 and 22356. NN. 12 : a-c 6 A-Uu 6 , 276 leaves, pp. [ 331 ] 4-221 [222-224] [=552]. Figures : figure 1 on $6 v of a, b, c, A, B, D, H, K, M, N, O, Q, S, U, Y, Aa, Cc, Ee, Gg, Ii, Ll, Nn, Pp, Rr. Little can be deduced from this meager example. One may merely observe that the figures, when they occur, are placed invariably on the last page of a gathering but that nearly half the quires (twenty-two) are unfigured. The figures alone do not here provide such unequivocal evidence of half-sheet imposition as they do in some other volumes, although the fact that 1 occurs on the same page of five consecutive gatherings (a-c, A-B) —and later in three (M-O) —strongly suggests half-sheet imposition (for in the case of two half-sheets worked together the same figure would not be expected to occur in the same forme of two consecutive quires). However, the pattern for most of the volume (particularly from O through Ss) is an alternation between figured and unfigured gatherings; assuming that a second pressman worked without a figure, this arrangement of figures is consistent with the results obtained by working two half-sheets together. Surely the lack of a figure, in this instance, does represent the work of a second press; but whether that press printed every other sheet by half-sheet imposition, or the inner formes of two consecutive half-sheets, is a matter impossible to determine on the basis of the figures alone. In other words, evidence from the figures suggests that at least gatherings a, b, c, A, F, G, M, N, Tt, and Uu are the product of half-sheet imposition but that the other thirty-six gatherings could conceivably be the result of either method of producing half-sheets. 14 A second Hall &amp; Sellers example, from the following year, illustrates a regular division of labor in folio: 2. Acts of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania [7 December 1790 to 13 April 1791]. Philadelphia: Hall &amp; Sellers, 1791. Evans 23670. DLC. 2 : π1 a-i 2 χ1 A-Dd 2 , 74 leaves, pp. [i-iii] iv-xxxix [xl], [1] 2-108. Summary of figures : 4 of 36 sheets figured in both formes, 28 figured in one forme, 4 unfigured. Fig. 1 v 2 r 1 r 2 v Totals 1 6 19 3 8 25(i) 11(o) 36 In this second Hall &amp; Sellers volume, as in the first, the only figure that appears is 1, and again the unfigured formes clearly represent work by another pressman, since the usual pattern is for each sheet to consist of one figured and one unfigured forme (and whenever both formes of a sheet are figured, both formes of another sheet are unfigured, so that the balance is retained). The long series of sheets (from F through Q) in which the inner formes alone are figured suggests offhand that composition was keeping pace with presswork, while those sheets in which both formes (or neither forme) are figured suggest that at those points composition was lagging behind or that one press was required briefly for another job; the alternating pattern (as in Q-S, Y-Aa, Cc-Dd) could also indicate an imbalance between composition and presswork, if the inner or outer formes were consistently the first formes through the press; but, if this condition did not obtain, then obviously other explanations could fit. In the absence of precise information about the figures in other books printed at the same time in Hall &amp; Sellers' shop, it is difficult to make any reliable deductions about the relations between composition and presswork or the size of the edition. Of course, certain rough calculations can be made. If one accepts the estimate that a colonial compositor could set approximately 600 ems (1200 ens) per hour, 15 then a forme of this book (roughly 8000 ens) would have been nearly seven hours' work; if the output of the press was about a token an hour (250 sheets, not perfected), 16 then nearly 1750 copies of a forme could have been machined in that same time. If then the appearance of figure 1 in many consecutive inner formes is taken to mean that the minimum time for presswork on any one inner forme was the time required for composing the next inner forme, the result would be to estimate the edition at 1750 copies (or perhaps between 1500 and 1750); however, if only one compositor were attempting to supply both presses, the time available for presswork would be twice as long. On the other hand, the appearance of figure 1 in three consecutive formes, two inner and one outer (as in Bb-Cc), might suggest, if two compositors were working, an edition of only 750 to 875 copies, or, with one compositor, an edition of 1500 to 1750 copies (the same as that postulated for two compositors above). It is not necessary to assume that the pressmen were machining each forme during the whole of the time available, for Benjamin Franklin commented on the fact that, given the small size of editions in America, pressmen did not have constant work, as compositors did, and "must often stand still"; 17 or pressmen might work on other jobs, such as blank forms or broadsides. Press figures, in other words, will become of greater usefulness in these calculations as more complete data are assembled about the work in a shop at any particular time and as more precise time limits can be established through external evidence. One interesting feature of the volume is the appearance of figures (three times) on $1 r —that is, on the same page as the signature—contrary to customary practice in both England and America. The usual locations in Hall &amp; Sellers folios at this time (at least as illustrated by this book) are the recto and verso of the second leaf of each gathering; it is impossible, at the present stage, to assign reasons for the deviations, since they do not occur simply at those places where $2 presents an unusual situation (such as short text) and since they may be the result merely of fortuitous circumstances that made it more convenient to insert the figure in one place rather than another. One more book printed in this shop, another volume of session laws characteristically issued as a folio in twos, shows that seven years later the practice in placing figures had shifted somewhat: 3. Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . Volume II. Philadelphia: Hall &amp; Sellers, 1798. Evans 34331. MWA. 2 : π 2 a-b 2 c1 A-9X 2 2 AH 2 2 I1, 434 leaves, pp. [ 4 ] [i] ii-ix [x], [1] 2-817, 2i-iii [ 34 ]. Summary of figures : 129 of 216 sheets figured in both formes, 32 figured in one forme, 55 unfigured. Fig. 1 v 2 r 1 r 2 v Totals 1 131/4 9 3 137/6 144(i) 146(o) 290 NOTE: Oblique lines are used to separate frequencies for column a of a page from those for column b, with the number following the oblique line referring to column b; where no oblique lines appear, the figures referred to occur nearer the left side of the page. Figures for abnormal gatherings or inserted sheets (such as 2I in this example) are not included in the tabular statistics. As in the earlier volume, the only figure which appears is 1, but the regular position for figuring the inner formes has become $1 v instead of $2 r (although figures appear on $2 r a number of times near the beginning of the volume). As before, figures do appear on the first page of a gathering, along with the signature (four times: F, 2E, 2 H, and the single leaf 2 I at the end). But, contrary to earlier practice, the division of labor (assuming the unfigured formes to be the work of a second press) is not generally to assign the two formes of each sheet to separate presses; normally here (129 times) the figure appears in both formes, with occasional interruptions when both formes are unfigured. A pattern sometimes seems to emerge (as in 3Z-4L, where alternate gatherings are figured in both formes and the intervening ones entirely unfigured), but it does not last for long, and certain runs of doubly figured sheets are quite extensive (as 7L-7Y, 8A-8I, 9G-9S, 2 A-H). Perhaps the most interesting feature of the figuring is the positions of the figures relative to the footnotes, although the differences in these positions probably do not distinguish different pressmen but are only indications of the shifting ease or difficulty of inserting figures at particular points. There are a great many long footnotes in the volume, and the figures are 108 times placed above the footnotes (that is, between the text and the note) and 25 times below. In ten instances also the figures occur near the right margin, the normal position being near the left. Three Bibles, printed at various times through the decade, may serve to represent the figuring of three more printers. The first of these Bibles, the work of William Young, a prolific Philadelphia printer who began issuing books in 1785, shows the unusual situation in which the signature page is the preferred one for figures: 18 4.

Perhaps this pattern supports the suggestion that figures were not used (and indeed were superfluous) when presswork was proceeding according to some previously arranged schedule and were needed only when there were deviations from it. 19 Young's Bible of the following year, though gathered differently (with alternating quires of six and twelve leaves), still has its figures (when they appear) on $1 r . Another instance of figuring on $1 r and $2 r furnishes, at the same time, an example of the large quarto Bible. The 1792 Bible printed in New York by Robert Hodge and Samuel Campbell contains fifty-five figures: 5. Holy Bible. New York: Hodge &amp; Campbell, 1792. Evans 24097, Hills 38.

Summary of figures : 4 of 133 sheets figured in both formes (T, U, Aa, Hh), 47 figured in one forme, 83 unfigured; all 11 half-sheets unfigured.

One further Bible—representing a third format, the large folio—may be chosen from the work of the Philadelphia printer Jacob R. Berriman: 6. Holy Bible. Philadelphia: Printed for Berriman &amp; Co. by Jacob R. Berriman, 1796. Evans 30065, Hills 53. NN. 2 : [A] 2 B-7I 2 [7K] 2 7L-9D 2 , 376 leaves, no pagination.

No figures appear in this book until sheet O, but after O there are only 38 unfigured formes; if figures are used only for unscheduled piecework, then the bulk of the volume falls into this category—which may conceivably be the case, since the presswork was started without figures (the first thirteen sheets). Another large folio Bible of this time which exhibits a similar pattern of figures is the famous "hot press" edition printed by John Thompson and Abraham Small of Philadelphia in 1798. Not only are figures lacking in the first 36 sheets, but there are large gaps later in the volume; where figures do appear, they are normally on $2 ra and $2 va , as in the Berriman work, and again only the figures 1 and 2 are used (but with more variation in position on the page, since they often come at the right side, or in the center, of the lower margin). The final series of examples from this period represents the work of perhaps the most enterprising of the Philadelphia printers before Mathew Carey—Thomas Dobson. Although his name appeared in imprints in 1786 and 1787, it was not until 1788 that he began printing some of the books he promoted, and another year or two before he printed any considerable number; but by 1790 he was ready to embark on the great Encyclopaedia , which he brought to conclusion in 1798 and which furnishes an extensive illustration of the sustained use of press figures. Before turning to that work, one may glance at a few other figured books from his shop during the same years. Thomas Percival's Moral and Literary Dissertations illustrates Dobson's practice, in half-sheet duodecimo, of figuring the last page of a quire: 7. Thomas Percival. Moral and Literary Dissertations . Second Edition. Philadelphia: Thomas Dobson, 1798. Evans 34342. Tanselle copy. 12 : [A] 6 B-S 6 T 2 , 110 leaves, pp. [i-iii]iv-xii,[1]2-204 [205] 204 [2].

An earlier volume, in half-sheet octavo, also shows the consistent choice of the last page of a gathering for figures, though the figures occur more sporadically: 8. William Currie. An Historical Account of the Climates and Diseases of the United States . Philadelphia: Thomas Dobson, 1792. Evans 24239.

Dobson occasionally issued separately some of the longer articles in the Encyclopaedia , and the same year (1792) saw the publication of such an extract in A Compendious System of Anatomy (Evans 24206); gathered in eights, it too is normally figured (with a 3) on the last page of gatherings. And a crown quarto, published the year after the Encyclopaedia , shows resemblances to the method of figuring in the large work: 9. Transactions of the American Philosophical Society . Volume IV.

It is a reprinting of the third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica , with revisions and additions (the article on "America," for example, was completely rewritten by Jedidiah Morse). Dobson took each part of the Britannica as it was issued, set his men to work on it, and managed to keep pace with the Edinburgh printers, for his final volume appeared only a few months after the Edinburgh one. His original plan was to issue the work in weekly parts of five gatherings each. Printing began late in 1789, and the first weekly issue appeared at the beginning of January 1790. The tenth issue, released in early March, finished the first half of Volume I, and with that issue the practice of weekly publication ceased; from then on, a half-volume was issued approximately every ten weeks. Although separate title pages, all bearing the date 1798, were supplied for each volume upon completion of the entire work in 1798, it is nevertheless possible to date with some accuracy the appearance of each volume and to deduce the amount of time available for the printing of each. To have completed a work of such magnitude so expeditiously, and to have fallen so little behind schedule, Dobson must certainly have been an efficient and industrious manager. The whole production is generally considered the greatest achievement in American printing before the nineteenth century; in the words of Lawrence Wroth, the Encyclopaedia "marks the end of printing in America as a household craft and the beginning of its factory stage of development." 22 It is appropriate that such a work should be one of the first American instances of the consistent and extensive use of a professional device for keeping efficient records—the press figure. And, as an example, it is nearly an ideal one, for it is large enough to provide plentiful data and prolonged enough to represent one printer's work during a period of more than eight years; the volumes are comparable as printing jobs, since they are parts of the same work, and the knowledge of the time taken to produce each one is important external information of a kind not always available. Dobson did not use press figures at the beginning of his task, probably believing that the division into weekly parts itself provided a convenient enough way of keeping records. On $4 v of every fifth gathering of Volume I through 3D (the work is quarto) appears an indication of the weekly issues—that is, "N o 1" falls on E4 v , "N o 2" on K4 v , "N o 3" on P4 v , and so on. After sheet 3D ("N o 10"), when the weekly issue ceased, these numbers still occur through the rest of the volume (except that numbers 11, 15, 19, and 20 are missing), but press figures also make a somewhat tentative appearance in seven formes. In Volume II Dobson is still not sure, for "N o 22" appears on K4 v and "N o 23" on P4 v , but after that figures occur consistently through the volume and the following fifteen volumes. Then, in the final volume, figures appear only in the first half (through 3D); beginning with 3E, the signature page also carries the designation "Part II," and the practice of using figures seems to have been abandoned. If the dating of these volumes established by Evans (in 33676-93) is correct, it is interesting to note the way in which the number of different figures in each volume correlates with the supposed speed of production. In Volume II, the first one regularly figured, only the figures 1 and 2 are used, and this is true also of Volume III; these volumes may have required more than the predicted twenty weeks each to print, since only two volumes per year were issued in 1790 and 1791. Then, according to Evans, Volumes V, VI, and VII came out in 1792 and VIII, IX, and X in 1793; the press figures increase accordingly to 1, 2, and 3 in IV and V, and to 1, 2, 3, and 4 in VI through XI. When the pace again slows down to two volumes per year in 1794, 1795, and 1796 (Volumes XI through XVI), the number of figures decreases to three (1, 2, and 4). And 1, 2, and 4 are also the figures in XVII (mid-1797) and XVIII (early 1798). Even though the work is not divided equally among these pressmen, it is in accord with common sense to find that more pressmen were at work on those volumes which were produced more quickly. Such would not be the case if some of the pressmen machined only one or two formes for a given volume in odd moments between other jobs (as in XIV, where 3 appears only once), but in general each figure that appears represents a substantial amount of work. Assuming again that the colonial compositor could set 1200 ens an hour, it would have taken him about 32 hours to set one forme, for the Encyclopaedia's closely-packed double column pages contained about 9620 ens each. If a pressman, machining roughly a token an hour, worked for 32 hours on one forme, the result would be an edition of 8000 copies, surely an unwarrantably large number. Furthermore, if an edition of this magnitude were postulated, the volumes could not possibly have been printed in the envisaged time; for a pressman, machining approximately eight tokens a day, six days a week, would require more than 41 weeks to complete 62 formes—and figure 4 appears in 62 formes of Volume VII, one of the volumes supposedly produced most rapidly. There is no reason to suppose, therefore, that the pressmen engaged in work on the Encyclopaedia spent their entire time on it—in fact, the Dobson Four Gospels of 1796 contains the same figures (1, 2, 4) as those in the Encyclopaedia volumes of that year. Nor is there reason to suppose that the copy could not have been cast off accurately (given the printed copy of the Edinburgh edition), so that more than one compositor might work at once. Continuing with the example of Volume VII for a moment, the time taken to produce that volume had to be great enough to allow for the machining of 62 formes, since that is the largest number machined by any one man (even assuming all the unfigured formes to be printed by one man, there are only 44 of them). Because Volume VII falls in the middle of that series of volumes seemingly published with greatest speed, it may be safe, for purposes of argument, to assume that the originally planned rate—for the whole volume—of ten formes a week (or a volume in twenty weeks) was actually achieved. If, then, a man worked steadily for twenty weeks to complete 62 formes, the size of the edition would be in the neighborhood of 3870 copies; but of course he may not have devoted so much time to this job. Perhaps a more accurate basis for calculation is to begin with the notion of issuing five sheets (ten formes) per week. Since the figures in later volumes (after Volume I) indicate generally a division of labor between the inner and outer formes, one may then assume that a pressman was expected, at most, to machine five formes in a week, a figure that suggests an edition of 2400 copies. All these numbers are, at this stage, only rough guesses based on various feasible ways of manipulating the data; it is not possible, without more knowledge of other work in Dobson's shop at the same time and other external information, to be much more precise. But such calculations do suggest the help which press figures will some day be able to give.

Their usual positions remain $4 ra and $4 va ; the deviations from these pages (or even from the left to the right sides of these pages) are comparatively few. Certain patterns appear at times (such as the split between 1 and 2 in II and III, or the long run of 4 in XVI, A-X, and they usually suggest that inner and outer formes, in general, were worked off by different presses. The matter of unfigured formes is inconclusive: the same figure rarely occurs in both formes of a sheet, suggesting that perhaps unfigured formes were the work of the same pressman indicated in the related figured formes; on the other hand, the same figure does occur in both formes frequently enough to raise doubts (as in XI, where a distinction is seemingly made between the single 4 in 3I-3O, etc., and the double 4 in 3T, 4T, and 5D). The figures seem to have been placed with some care, for they usually are found above the footnotes, just as the signatures are (though there are exceptions, as IX, Kk4 v ); in the two instances in which a figure appears on $1 r (XIV, Kk1 rb , and XVI, 4K1 ra ), it comes below the footnote, while the signature remains above. But it required some attention to detail to insert figures so high on the page as was necessary to precede the long footnotes on X, Hh4 v and Ii4 v . In some cases where figures appear on leaves other than $4, though by no means all, there is some peculiarity (such as short text or a long footnote) which would render the figure more unsightly than usual or more difficult to insert; in other instances a figure appears despite a short text (see X, T2 r ), and in one volume a figure even comes on the final page, just above the words "End of the Seventh Volume." Since the placing of figures may often have been a function of the physical arrangement of the shop (just which edge of the forme was easier to reach at the proper moment), 23 the fact that three figures in the Encyclopaedia are upside down takes on added interest (figure 3 on VI, 3S4 v ; figure 4 on IX, Uu3 v , and XIV, 5F2 r ). Systematic study of deviations from the usual positions, in conjunction with such accidents as turned figures, when undertaken for all the books in a shop at one time, may yield information about the mechanical set-up and physical organization of the shop. An overall picture of the customs of figuring in Dobson's shop during these years, as represented in the Encyclopaedia , can be gained (from one viewpoint) by examining the habits of each of the pressmen who used figures, in terms of the number of times they figured each page: 24 Fig. 1 v 2 r 3 v 4 r 1 r 2 v 3 r 4 v Totals 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0(i) 1(o) 1 1 19 1 26 136 1 8 19 395 182(i) 423(o) 605 2 22 0 52 223 0 14 17 369 297(i) 400(o) 697 3 7 0 16 76 0 3 5 132 99(i) 140(o) 239 4 22 1 46 114 1 20 13 387 183(i) 421(o) 604 -- -- -- -- - -- -- -- --- --- --- Totals 70 2 140 549 2 45 54 1284 761(i) 1385(o) 2146 The two least popular pages are $1 r and $2 r , but the reason is not the desire to avoid rectos, since the regular position for figuring inner formes is $4 r and since the second most frequent position for outer formes is $3 r . In other words, whenever $4 r and $4 v were not used, the chances favored $3 r and $3 v ; the first two leaves were least often chosen. Of the four principal figures (the one o may be a mistake), number 3 is responsible for the smallest amount of work, while 1, 2, and 4 performed roughly the same amount. The resemblance between 1 and 4 is especially striking, both in the total number of formes worked (605-604) and the proportion of inner (182-183) and outer (423-421) —as well as in the fact that these are the only two figures to appear on $1 r and $2 r . Not only did the four men figure outer formes much more often than inner; they were more definite in their preference of the page on which to figure outer formes. Number 1 figured $4 v in 93% of his figured outer formes; number 2, 92%; number 3, 94%; and number 4, 92%. But number 1 figured $4 r in only 75% of his figured inner formes; number 2, also 75%; number 3, 77%; and number 4, 62%. The only departure from the general pattern is 4's preference of $2 v over $3 r as his second-choice position in the outer forme; but there are actually no striking deviations that serve to distinguish the four men. To complement this somewhat static overview, one may examine various percentages of figured and unfigured formes and sheets as they change during the course of the eighteen volumes: Vol. % formes figured % formes unfigured % sheets figured in both formes % sheets figured in one forme % sheets unfigured % inner formes figured % outer formes figured % inner figured formes figured on $4r % outer figured formes figured on $4v I 3 97 2 3 95 3 4 100 100 II 56 44 51 9 40 52 59 77 98 III 88 12 77 22 1 80 96 95 98 IV 73 27 52 42 6 65 80 83 94 V 72 28 44 54 2 55 87 73 90 VI 82 18 65 35 0 69 96 70 94 VII 78 22 57 42 1 66 90 82 94 VIII 69 31 38 61 1 48 89 80 94 IX 71 29 43 56 1 52 90 80 92 X 60 40 24 72 4 42 77 72 93 XI 58 42 23 71 6 53 63 74 88 XII 63 37 32 62 6 46 79 45 92 XIII 54 46 16 76 8 23 85 52 87 XIV 47 53 8 77 15 14 79 43 82 XV 60 40 21 78 1 28 92 57 95 XVI 60 40 25 70 5 27 93 52 96 XVII 56 44 17 79 4 25 86 42 92 XVIII 29 71 16 25 59 16 42 47 98 Averages (based on III-XVII) 66 34 36 60 4 46 85 67 92 Volumes I, II, and XVIII, which are not figured all the way through, do not fall into the same pattern as the other fifteen volumes; volumes III through XVII do conform roughly to a pattern, with XIV the only notable exception (less than half its formes are figured). Since 85% of the outer formes are figured, as opposed to only 46% of the inner formes, one might argue, if one assumes unfigured formes to be the work of the same press as the preceding forme, that outer formes were normally the first laid on. However, if unfigured formes are not taken as the work of a separate press, then one would expect the percentage of sheets figured in both formes to rise at times when great speed was desired; yet, as the table shows, there is no steady increase in this figure for those volumes supposedly issued most rapidly (V-X), though it is true that the later figures are generally lower. Furthermore, when 66% of the formes are figured consistently over a period of years, it seems reasonable to assume that the figures represent a device for recording more than simply occasional piecework. The testimony of the figures provides a basis for reconstructing in detail the printing of the bulk of the Encyclopaedia , as soon as a few still doubtful points are cleared up. The answers to these questions (the significance of unfigured formes, the composition-presswork ratio, the length of time spent by pressmen in working off various formes) will emerge, it is hoped, from a study of Dobson's other work. It remains to say a word about the other great Philadelphia printer of the time, Mathew Carey. Although he first issued a Bible (Douay) in 1790, the only Bibles of his in which I have discovered figures come after 1800. The story of Carey's numerous printings of the King James Bible from standing type after 1804 is a complex one which deserves detailed study in its own right, and it is not possible here, without the benefit of such a study, to do more than give the broadest outline of Carey's use of press figures. First of all, it may be worth calling attention to Joseph Charless, who printed Carey's first quarto King James Bible in 1801: 11. Holy Bible. Philadelphia: Printed for Mathew Carey by Joseph Charless, 20 October 1801. Shaw 171, Hills 77. NN. 4 : π1 A-4F 4 2 A-R 4 x 2 4G-5F 4 5G 2 aaa-eee 4 fff 2 , 467 leaves, no pagination. Summary of figures : Figure 2 appears on $1 v of every gathering except A, C, D, x , and fff . About the printing of this Bible a number of external facts are known. Composing and printing began in April, just after Charless' proposal of 15 April 1801: "Suppose 120 sheets of which I engage to execute one Sheet per day—Provided the Font is large enough to employ a Sufficient number of Compositors." 25 Since the job was finished in early September (Carey's account book shows a credit to Charless for the Bible on 26 September), or about 130 working days later, the original plan of a sheet per day was adhered to fairly closely. Although each forme contained about 38,000 ens, or about 32 hours' work in composition time, it would have been possible to compose a sheet in one day with six or seven compositors—not a surprising figure in the light of Charless' concern about keeping employed "a Sufficient number of Compositors." Further, the Carey account book and other documents fix the size of the edition at 2000 copies. Since the daily output of one press was about eight tokens, 2000 perfected sheets would be the daily product of two presses working together. The conclusion to which one is led, therefore, is that the unfigured formes in the 1801 Charless Bible were worked off by a second press. Figure 2 appears consistently in the inner formes; only if another press consistently machined the unfigured outer formes could a perfected edition-sheet be completed in one day. As to the later Carey Bibles, only these observations can be made at this time: Carey continued to use press figures at least as late as 1818, for they appear in Bibles to that time with changes apparently reflecting the division of labor in each printing (that is, they do not seem to be present simply because they were locked up in standing type at some earlier period and not removed when their usefulness ceased); in the earlier years (and at least as late as 1811), some of his quarto Bibles were gathered in eights, and in these the figures are found on $1 v and $3 v ; in his regular quarto Bibles, the figures come exclusively on $1 v ; the figure 2 appears in the overwhelming majority of instances, but in the 1803 Bible figures 3, 4, 5, and 7 also occur (here the New Testament at least was printed for Carey by T. S. Manning); only rarely is $1 v unfigured. Even a cursory examination of the Carey Bibles suggests that the full story of their printing will demand a study both of press figures and of impression figures (those three-digit numbers in parentheses). But with Carey we have moved into the nineteenth century.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II After the complications of the volumes of the 1790's, the figures in the books of Isaac Riley in the 1810's may seem rather simple. Nevertheless they furnish, aside from the Encyclopaedia , the most concentrated example of press figures thus far discovered in American printing, for works published by Riley consistently contained them between 1810 and 1816. Born in Cornwall, Connecticut, on 29 November 1770, Riley had established himself as a bookseller, "I. Riley &amp; Co.," in Middletown as early as 1791, and in the following years he entered into partnerships with merchants in several cities (Freeman &amp; Riley in Baltimore, Goodrich &amp; Riley in Philadelphia, Overton &amp; Riley in Middletown), while he carried on business himself in New York. By 1799 he had become the silent partner of Henry Caritat, a bookseller, and by June 1804 he had set himself up as a printer and publisher (I. Riley &amp; Co.). During the next decade his location, according to his imprint, was 1 or 4 City Hotel, Broadway, but in 1815 he moved to 12 and 14 Wall Street and in 1816 to 27 William Street. After 1817 (until his retirement in 1822 and his death in Maine on 14 March 1824) his activities were principally confined to bookselling in Philadelphia. 26 It appears that Riley first began using press figures in 1809. Although I have not examined every book that Riley printed and am presenting only a representative sample here, I have not discovered press figures in any of his books before that year and have found that his books from 1810 on almost invariably contain them. That 1809 is the borderline is suggested by the fact that the first volume of Royall Tyler's Vermont Reports (1809) does not have figures, while the second volume (1810) does have. In addition, one work of 1809 which utilizes figures carries them on $4 v , whereas Riley's practice beginning in 1810 was almost always to place them on $3 v (in octavos printed by half-sheet imposition). This work, deposited for copyright on the same day as Tyler's Reports , 27 October 1809, is Edward Augustus Kendall's three-volume Travels : 12. Edward Augustus Kendall. Travels through the Northern Parts of the United States , in the Years 1807 and 1808 . 3 vols. New York: Riley, 1809. Shaw 17862. NhHi.

The reason for the change is not clear, since there is nothing unusual about $4 v in those gatherings that would make a figure there awkward; certain gatherings which do have a short text on $4 v , as M and X in Volume I and Y in Volume II, still have the figure as usual. Neither is it possible to determine why (if there was a reason at all) a few figures are nearer the right side of the page (in E and U of Volume I, M and Gg of Volume II, Dd of Volume III), when they are generally nearer the left. Nor is the significance of the unfigured quires more apparent here than in the earlier books. Since the same figure often appears in consecutive quires, the absence of a figure cannot refer to the same man as the last one indicated but rather suggests a sixth man who worked without a number. The only matter on which the figures seem to offer some comprehensible evidence is whether the work was printed by half-sheet imposition or by working two half-sheets together (inner A and B in one chase, outer A and B in another). If the latter method had been used one would not find figures on the same pages of consecutive gatherings, a situation which occurs throughout most of these three volumes; one may conclude that this work, like most of Riley's later octavo volumes, was printed by half-sheet imposition. Since the three volumes of Kendall's Travels must have been printed at roughly the same time in Riley's shop, one is tempted to look for relationships among the figures that might suggest, if not concurrent printing, at least the distribution of work. But evidence from these three volumes alone provides justification for saying no more than the obvious: that 1 and 2 shared most of the work on Volume I, helped out by 3 and 4 at the end; that 3 replaced 1 beginning with the fifteenth sheet of Volume II, replaced in turn by 4, who performed an increasingly large share of the labor near the end of the volume; and that 1, working the beginning and end of Volume III, was helped by 4 and 5 in the middle and by 3 briefly at the end. Beginning with 1810 several different works with figures (rather than volumes of the same work) can be cited for each year, and their copyright deposit dates can be used to indicate roughly the time of year; but, even so, a more complete survey of Riley's books would be necessary before any fairly reliable statements could be made about the size of the editions or the presswork schedule in his shop. One of the books which Riley printed in early 1810, another travel account, may be used to reveal the transition at this time to his fixed policy of placing figures on $3 v , for the first volume of the work, like the Kendall book, has the figures on $4 v , while the second has them regularly on $3 v : 13.

Fig. 3 v 4 v Totals 3 3 1 4 4 17 2 19 -- -- -- Totals 20 3 23 Clearly, 1 preferred to place his figure on $4 v and 4 on $3 v ; 1 does not vary from his practice in Volume I, and 4 varies only rarely in Volume II. 27 Again the figures are normally at the left (those in B and O of the second volume being the only exceptions). The figures here offer a way of confirming the normal expectation that the preliminary gatherings were printed last (or at least after the rest of Volume I), for quire 2 has the figure 4, not found otherwise in that volume but occurring throughout most of Volume II (and, according to 4's custom in Volume II, the figure appears on 3 v ). The fact that figure 1 appears in every quire but one in Volume I may raise some doubts about the assumption that figures were used only when a regular and customarily followed scheme was broken; on the other hand, the exclusive printing of a volume by one man or press would probably not be an ordinary pattern, except when the size of the edition was such that composition and presswork proceeded at an equal pace. Four more of Riley's octavos in fours of 1810 illustrate his consistent use of $3 v as the location for figures: in John Anthon's An Appendix to the Touchstone of Common Assurances , figures occur in only fifteen gatherings, on $3 v in all but four of them; in William Sampson's Trial of the Journeymen Cordwainers of the City of New-York , $3 v is chosen for thirteen out of sixteen figures; in Sir George Steuart Mackenzie's A Treatise on the Diseases and Management of Sheep , five out of eight figures are on $3 v ; and in C. J. Ingersoll's Inchquin , the Jesuit's Letters , twelve out of sixteen occur on that page. Another category of Riley's output, the duodecimo volumes gathered in sixes and printed by half-sheet imposition, is represented in the books of 1810. In this format the figures generally appear on the fifth verso of each quire, as in Sophie R. Cottin's The Saracen . There are only two instances in each of its two volumes where a figure appears on a page other than $5 v ; one of those, in Q of Volume II, occurs where the text of 5 v is very short (but this may not be the reason for the change, since a figure does appear on another short page, X5 v ). A rhythmical pattern of alternation exists for a time between 2 and 4 in Volume I and between 5 and no figure in Volume II; but 4 prints the last half of each volume almost without help. Again it appears to be a sixth man who works without a figure. Other examples of the duodecimo format, however, show that the figures do not occur with the same regularity in these volumes as in the octavos. In Mary Palmer Tyler's The Maternal Physician (1811), figure 1 appears on $5 v six times and on $4 v five times, out of a total of 24 gatherings; in The Mirror of the Graces (1813), figures occur on only four of 21 half-sheets (two of those times on $5 v ); in The Universal Receipt Book (1814), on only seven of 24 (six times on $5 v ); and in John Bonnycastle's The Scholar's Guide to Arithmetic (9th ed., 1815), on eleven of 20 (eight times on $5 v ). Some of these later volumes, though published by Riley, were printed by Charles Wiley or his partner Cornelius Vanwinkle. Both Vanwinkle and Wiley were located at 3 Wall Street during this period (with Riley at 14 Wall in 1815); there must have been a close association among the three men, for Vanwinkle and Wiley did a number of printing jobs for Riley and are the only American printers besides Riley who actively used press figures in the post-1810 period, so far as I have yet discovered. This much will have suggested that Riley's books, of various formats and sizes, continually employed press figures, and in a fairly consistent way. Before further progress can be made toward analyzing these figures, however, more of them must be put on record, so that a comprehensive picture of the activities in Riley's shop at any given time can be pieced together. Most important for this purpose, because it bulks largest in the amount of time required for composition and presswork, is the series of thick octavo volumes which issued in a steady stream from his presses. It is also the most important part of his output historically, for it includes his many legal treatises—he not only reprinted standard British works which were needed by American lawyers but also contacted a number of state supreme courts urging that their reports of cases be prepared for publication. He was one of the American pioneers in this field, and his imprint appears on the early volumes of reports for Connecticut, New York, South Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia. Of the volumes I have thus far located and examined, several fall into the period of late 1810 and early 1811; by tabulating their figures together, a pattern may begin to emerge even before every book and odd job on hand at the time have been identified.

Out of a total of 478 quires, 317 (or about two-thirds) are figured. Of those that are figured, 276 (or 87%) have the figure on $3 v ; the next most popular position is $2 v , but this occurs only 24 times. Rectos are figured only seven times, and never the first leaf recto. The figures normally occur near the left margin, for only eight out of the 317 appear at the right edge. Figures 4 and 5 are found most frequently (72 and 71 times, respectively), with 3 running close behind (63 times); 2, 6, and 1 occur least often (47, 40, and 24 times, respectively). Beyond this one cannot go without further data; it is futile to attempt a reconstruction of the printing schedule or to deduce information about the size of these editions, when Riley obviously printed more than seven books in his shop during this period, and those other books must enter into one's calculations. Toward this end, I shall present one more group of Riley books, all of 1811. The legal octavos issued by Riley after that, between 1812 and 1816, were only "Published by I. Riley"; the printing was done by Charles Wiley or by Vanwinkle &amp; Wiley. A further look at some of these volumes will serve for comparison with the practices in Riley's own shop. Then a statistical summary at that point will perhaps have somewhat greater validity. 1811 21. Alexander de Humboldt. Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain , translated by John Black. Volume I.

Reasons for the deviations can sometimes be guessed, as in item 36, where 42 3 v has extra white space at the lower left and 51 3 v a long footnote, or in item 35, where 3 3 v and 4 3 v have long footnotes and 15 3 v short text. But in 36 there is a figure on 30 3 v even though the text is short, and in 35 both short text and footnotes do not prevent the choice of 10 2 v and 32 3 v . One cannot therefore carry this sort of argument very far, but in general it seems true that $3 v was avoided if it represented an unusual situation (such as short text or long footnotes) that might make insertion of a figure more difficult. Again the edition size is indeterminate without more information, but one can at least speculate that item 14, for example, would require roughly fourteen hours' composition time for each forme of eight pages and that a press working with half-sheet imposition during this time (that is, spending half the time printing white paper and half the time perfecting) could produce an edition of 1750 copies. Identical figures do appear in many consecutive half-sheets of this volume, but there are too many other unknown factors (number of compositors, additional jobs worked off by the same presses during this time) to make the estimate at all reliable. The statistics of figure frequencies (based on items 14-37 above) do not reveal any striking differences in practice between the shops of Isaac Riley and Charles Wiley (frequencies for Riley come before the hyphen, those for Wiley after): Fig. 1 r 1 v 2 r 2 v 3 r 3 v 4 r 4 v Totals 1 0 3-3 0 8-16 6-2 199-136 0 10-4 226-161 387 2 0 0-1 0-1 5-7 1-1 54-90 0 2-0 62-100 162 3 0 0-3 0 3-3 0 66-32 3-0 3-0 75-38 113 4 0 3-0 0 9-0 2-1 117-25 0 3-0 134-26 160 5 0 1-0 1-1 14-3 1-1 138-35 0 1-0 156-40 196 6 0 1-6 1-0 5-12 0 59-109 1-0 1-5 68-132 200 -- -- -- -- -- ---- -- -- ---- ---- Totals 0 8-13 2-2 44-41 10-5 633-427 4-0 20-9 721-497 1218 0 21 4 85 15 1060 4 29 1218 In both cases $3 v is the usual page for figures, with $2 v the second choice; in both $2 r and $4 r are unpopular, with $1 r never used; in both six figures appear, with figure 1 most frequently. More revealing is the percentage table, which shows that Wiley used figures somewhat more steadily: Vol. % half-sheets figured % figured half-sheets figured on $3 v 14 88 98 22 87 83 30 93 83 15 56 78 23 33 91 31 94 85 16 34 95 24 85 91 32 90 87 17 73 82 25 90 81 33 95 92 18 60 91 26 71 90 34 96 81 19 63 79 27 91 90 35 96 85 20 89 96 28 95 90 36 91 91 21 60 85 29 93 89 37 91 83 Averages for Riley 73 90 Averages for Wiley 93 86 Whereas some of the Riley books examined have only 33 or 34% of the half-sheets figured, the Wiley volumes consistently have figures on over 90% of the half-sheets. Of those half-sheets figured, however, Riley's more frequently have the figures on $3 v , but only by a margin of 4%. In short, there are no significant differences between the customs of these two related firms in figuring their legal octavos in half-sheet, but their practice does at least provide evidence of the consistency with which press figures were still being used (by some firms, at any rate) in America in the second decade of the nineteenth century.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III On the basis of these examples of American books with press figures, drawn from the twenty-five year period between 1790 and 1814, a few observations may be made: (1) press figures do not occur in American books of this time with great frequency, but they appear regularly in the work of certain printers; (2) the two most extensive examples thus far discovered are volumes printed in Philadelphia by several printers (especially Thomas Dobson) in the 1790's and books printed in New York by Isaac Riley and Charles Wiley in the 1810's; (3) Dobson, using four figures, figured about 66% of the quarto formes he printed for his Encyclopaedia , figured 36% of the sheets in both formes, and figured 85% of the outer formes; (4) Riley, using six figures, figured 73% of the formes in his legal octavos in half-sheet, Wiley 93%; (5) Dobson generally figured inner formes on $4 r and outer on $4 v , while Riley and Wiley placed their figures on $3 v of the half-sheet gathering; 31 (6) evidence exists, in the press figures, for possible detailed reconstruction of the printing history of several large projects, such as the Dobson Encyclopaedia , the Riley legal reports, and the Mathew Carey Bibles, as well as many smaller works turned out by these printers during the same years. Furthermore, the data lean slightly toward the conclusion that press figures stand for men and that unfigured formes are the work of at least one additional press crew, working without a number. Press figures have not yet been located in American books before 1790, but further search is obviously called for. A sketch of this kind can do no more than describe, record, and suggest possibilities; it raises more problems than it solves. Those solutions, as in any scientific investigation, can come only after a large body of data has been accumulated and recorded in such a way as to bring out patterns and trends, ideally by tables listing every figure, forme by forme. For American figures, unless one assumes at the beginning that they behave in the same manner as English ones, it is necessary to observe their occurrence in a great many books before one can comment on them with anything but guesses. Not until all the books printed by a given printer at a particular time have been examined in conjunction with advertisements, dates, and other external information will it be possible to speak with some assurance. Not until then will press figures be accorded the respect of an established scholarly tool rather than the fascination of an enigma.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 R. W. Chapman, "Printing with Figures," Library , 4th ser., III (1922-23), 175-176. 2 Lawrence C. Wroth, in The Colonial Printer (2nd ed., 1938), pp. 62-63, discusses the equipment of the colonial printing shop. 3 I have not thus far noted any press figures in American books earlier than this period. 4 A previous article which surveys patterns of press figures in a large number of books, though it uses a somewhat different method from the present one, is Kenneth Povey, "A Century of Press-Figures," Library , 5th ser., XIV (1959), 251-273; in it he surveys 111 English octavos dated from 1688 to 1797. 5 The reasonable assumption that figures would be more likely to occur in large books is borne out in a negative way (though of course not proved) by an examination of a collection (in the Wisconsin Historical Society) of 105 pamphlet sermons printed in the United States between 1771 and 1815; none of them contains figures. 6 For whatever usefulness it may have as negative evidence, Bibles printed by the following printers were checked and found to contain no figures (the numbers referring to the particular editions examined, as listed in Margaret T. Hills, The English Bible in America [1961], and the asterisks indicating that the plates were stereotyped by a firm other than the printer listed): William B. Allen (Newburyport), 278; R. Aitken (Philadelphia), 11; E. F. Backus (Albany), *300; Bible Society of New York, *303; Bible Society of Philadelphia, *213; D. &amp; G. Bruce (New York), 279; J. T.

Greenough (Boston), 250, 260, 379; Greenough &amp; Stebbins (Boston), 165, 177, 191, 214; Griggs &amp; Dickinsons (Philadelphia), 259; J. &amp; J. Harper (New York), *353; George F. Hopkins (New York), 76; Hudson &amp; Co. (Hartford), 307, 335; Hudson &amp; Goodwin (Hartford), 168, 179, 215, 237, 281; Jacob Johnson (Philadelphia), 116, 143; George Long (New York), 211, 229, 272; Simeon L. Loomis, Hart, &amp; Lincoln (Hartford), 297; Mann &amp; Douglas (Morris-Town), 122; W. Mercein (New York), 301; E. Merriam (Brookfield), 273; Munroe, Francis &amp; Parker (Boston), 276; W. E. Norman (Hudson), *330; Sage &amp; Clough (New York), 103; J. Seymour (New York), 175, 233; B. W. Sower (Baltimore), 217; Isaiah Thomas (Worcester), 30, 44, 90; Thomas &amp; Andrews (Boston), 105, 115, 125; Thomas B. Wait (Boston), 171; Anson Whipple (Walpole, N.H.), 275; R. P. &amp; C. Williams (Boston), *355; W. W. Woodward (Philadelphia), 135, 180, 240, 308. The following did contain figures: Jacob R. Berriman (Philadelphia), 53; Mathew Carey (Philadelphia), 102, 121, 132, 156, 161, 163, 208, 231, 238, 261, 345; Joseph Charless (Philadelphia), 77; Thomas Dobson (Philadelphia), 66; Hodge &amp; Campbell (New York), 38; Thompson &amp; Small (Philadelphia), 62; William Young (Philadelphia), 25, 32. 7 Another similar arrangement, used by Isaiah Thomas, was to repeat single alphabets with consecutive numbers—as 50Z, 51A, 52B, and so on. 8 Another version of this device occurs in the Bangs &amp; Mason five-volume Bible, printed by J. &amp; J. Harper (New York) in 1823; on $1 r of every twentieth gathering there is an indication of the part "No." as well as the volume number. Cf. Volume I of Dobson's Encyclopaedia (1790), discussed as item 10 below. 9 Still other numbers that occur occasionally may simply be errors such as the "2" that appears near the lower edge of C8r in Azariah Mather's The Gospel-Minister Described (New London: T. Green, 1725). 10 For the view that unfigured formes represent work by the same press which printed the preceding or succeeding figured formes, see F. B. Kaye's edition of Mandeville's The Fable of the Bees (1924), II, 394-395; and Philip Gaskell, "Eighteenth Century Press Numbers: Their Use and Usefulness," Library , 5th ser., IV (1950), 249-261. For the view that unfigured formes are the work of a separate press, working without a number, see Walter E. Knotts, "Press Numbers as a Bibliographical Tool: A Study of Gay's The Beggar's Opera , 1728," Harvard Library Bulletin , III (1949), 198-212. D. F. McKenzie, in "Press-Figures: A Case History of 1701-03," Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society , III (1960), 32-46, believes that a single unfigured forme is the work of the press which printed the other (figured) forme of the sheet but that an entirely unfigured sheet is the work of a different press; William B. Todd, in "Patterns in Press Figures: A Study of Lyttleton's Dialogues of the Dead ," SB , VIII (1956), 230-235, believes that the normal pattern was to use one figure for both formes, unless speed was important, in which case two different figures would be used. 11 For a statement of the position that figures stand for the pressmen, not the machines, see William B. Todd, "Observations on the Incidence and Interpretation of Press Figures," SB , III (1950-51), 171-205; Todd, "Press Figures," Library , 5th ser., VII (1952), 283; McKenzie, loc. cit. For the opposite view, that they represent presses, not men, see Philip Gaskell, "An Early Reference to Press-Figures," Library , 5th ser., VII (1952), 211; and J. D. Fleeman, "Eighteenth-Century Printing Ledgers," TLS , 19 December 1963, p. 1056. For additional discussion of press figures, see William B. Todd, "Press Figures and Book Reviews as Determinants of Priority," PBSA , XLV (1951), 72-76; Todd, "Bibliography and the Editorial Problem in the Eighteenth Century," SB , IV (1951-52), 41-55; and Giles Barber, "Catchwords and Press Figures at Home and Abroad," Book Collector , IX (1960), 301-307. 12 In future articles I plan to pursue in greater detail various aspects of American press figures suggested here. For the present discussion only one copy of most works was examined, since the aim, at this preliminary stage, was not to discover previously unrecognized printings through variations in press figures but simply to locate some of the books in which the figures could be found and to ascertain some of their characteristics. 13 I do not mean to imply that I have found evidence which proves that the figures designate the men instead of the presses; but it is convenient to be able to refer to them as standing for one or the other, and I shall speak of them as men in this article. A pressman was often identified with a press, and references to the number of a press in nineteenth-century printing books may have taken for granted the equation of the two. There does not seem to be a great deal of point in indicating on the printed sheets themselves the number of the press they were printed on, except as a record of the work done by a particular man at that press, in which case the distinction between man and press has little significance. 14 In this distinction in terminology between "half-sheet imposition" and "two half-sheets worked together," I am following the analysis by Kenneth Povey, "On the Diagnosis of Half-sheet Imposition," Library , 5th ser., XI (1956), 268-272. 15 See Wroth, The Colonial Printer , p. 164; the minimum pay per week for composition was eight dollars, at 25&amp;c.nt; per 1000 ems, and a man on a six-day week of about nine or ten hours a day could earn his minimum by setting about 600 ems per hour. In London at this time a compositor had to be capable of setting 1500 ens (750 ems) per hour; see Ellic Howe, The London Compositor (1947), p. 59. Charlton Hinman, discussing an earlier period, uses the figure 1000 ens per hour (in a twelvehour day); see The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963), I, 44-45. 16 It has become conventional, following Moxon, to set this figure for presswork, and Wroth accepts it for early American printing (p. 80), suggesting however that a ten-hour day resulted in only eight tokens printed on one side. See Herbert Davis and Harry Carter's edition of Moxon's Mechanick Exercises (2nd ed., 1962), pp. 292, 484-486; cf. Hinman, I, 41-42. 17 Quoted in Wroth, pp. 162, 181. 18 It may also be pointed out that in Young's 1790 Bible the signature pages often have a cross or dagger (τ) in the lower margin under the first column; this is true of all gatherings except E, N, Dd, Ff, and Gg (in Dd the cross comes on 5 r , since 1r is the New Testament title page; in Gg there is an asterisk on 2r). 19 Cf. William B. Todd, "Concurrent Printing: An Analysis of Dodsley's Colleclection of Poems by Several Hands ," PBSA , XLVI (1952), 45-57: "whenever books contain press figures their very presence implies unsystematic piecework engaged in conjunction with other miscellaneous endeavors. For labor which is predetermined, controlled, and properly recorded by the overseer . . . the figures become superfluous and accordingly disappear." 20 It has been suggested that differing sizes of press figures, when more than one size of a given number appears in the same work, may indicate different pressmen or presses—see J. D. Fleeman, "William Somervile's 'The Chace,' 1735," PBSA , LVIII (1964), 1-7. By referring to William Bowyer's ledgers, Fleeman is able to determine which presses and pressmen were responsible for each forme of this book; but the significance of the sizes of type is not clear, since two sizes of figure 3 were used by each of two presses and do not therefore provide a means for distinguishing between the work of the two presses. In the present instance, the 1 in Nn, the 2 in E and Gg, and the 4 in F, G, and H are appreciably smaller than those same numbers used as press figures elsewhere in the volume. Since it seems unlikely, however, that a system promising such confusion would have been preferred to the more obvious and sensible procedure of continuing the numbers in order, I have disregarded size in tabulating the totals for various figures. 21 A 1799 printing of this work which appears to have been produced from the same setting of type is the one which reads "Philadelphia: Printed by A. Bartram" on the title page. 22 Wroth, p. 294; other discussions of the Dobson Encyclopaedia are in Evans 22486 (the source for information about the plans and dates of publication) and in Herman Kogan, The Great EB : The Story of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1958), p. 25. 23 Cf. Povey, "A Century of Press-Figures," pp. 254-256. Povey cites evidence that some pressmen prefer to figure the near side of the forme, some the off side; in the Encyclopaedia the off side is consistently the choice. 24 It should be remembered that half-sheets are not included in any of the summary statistics. 25 See David Kaser, Joseph Charless : Printer in the Western Country (1963), pp. 27-31. Charless also printed for Carey Choice Tales (1800) and Conductor Generalis (1801). Cf. Letter XI (5 February 1834) of "Autobiography of Mathew Carey," New England Magazine , VI (1834), 230-234: "In 1801, I published a quarto edition of the Bible, (of three thousand copies,) . . ." (p. 230). On Carey's Bibles, see also Mason Locke Weems : His Works and Ways , ed. E. E. F. Skeel (1929), II, 133-157. 26 Information about Riley is taken from G. L. McKay's directory of the New York book trade from 1633 to 1820 (1942), the imprint catalogue at the American Antiquarian Society, and the imprints of Riley's books. 27 When 3 placed his figure on N4 v , it was perhaps because N3 v had a short text. 28 As in the previous statistics, only regular gatherings are counted—in this case, only the complete half-sheets. Gatherings of two leaves (quarter-sheets) are listed but are not tabulated, since they would unfairly affect the results. Also as before, numbers following an oblique line in the summaries refer to figures occuring nearer the right edge of a page; the normal position is nearer the left edge. 29 Many of the reprinted legal volumes are paged so that reference can be made to the first edition. Thus the number in the headline corresponds to the page in the first edition on which the text beginning the present page fell; wherever the next page of the first edition began, there will be an asterisk in the text and in the margin indicating the new page. Under this system a recto headline may carry an even page number, and two consecutive headlines may have the same number (or skip over a number). 30 Figure 4 on 2 3 v of the Wisconsin copy is not present in the University of Chicago copy. This is the only instance of a variation in figuring among the books which I examined in multiple copies, and the significance of the variation is not clear —whether it represents a second impression of gathering 2 or an accidental loss of the figure. 31 Kenneth Povey's observation, in "A Century of Press-Figures," p. 254, that the preference for rectos or versos often depends on the predilection of individual pressmen does not seem to hold true for these American books; in these examples all figures appear most often on those pages ($4 r and $4 v in quarto, $3 v in half-sheet octavo) which must have been established by shop policy as the pages for figures. 32 It should be understood that the policy for assigning entry numbers in the Shaw-Shoemaker checklist sometimes makes it difficult to refer to one particular volume. The multi-volume legal reports for various states, for example, are often given only one entry, under the year of the first volume. Even though inclusive dates are given, the dates of individual volumes are obscured, and the names of later printers do not appear at all. Cf. Shaw 20243, 27411. Entry 16644 lists four volumes of the Virginia Reports under the date of the first volume, 1808; since the printer for that volume is Smith &amp; Maxwell, Riley's name never appears. Sometimes the name of the compiler of the reports is missing (cf. the omission of McHenry in 25956 and of Caines in 29344). Nor is the policy consistent, for three volumes of Caines' Term Reports are given separate entries (29344, 32323, 32324), as are the two volumes of Chitty (25064, 25065). When an index of the Shaw-Shoemaker list is prepared, therefore, certain volumes, authors, and printers may not be represented in certain years as accurately as they should be.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Spoils of Poynton : Revisions and Editions by S. P. Rosenbaum *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A half century ago there appeared, appropriately enough in PMLA , the first academic study of the celebrated—or deplored—revisions made by Henry James for the New York Edition of his collected works. The study frankly criticized the eccentricities of "the later manner of Mr. Henry James," as found in The Awkward Age , and questioned "whether a mode of writing which so constantly distracts attention from the substance to the form of expression is still to be called a style ." 1 As newer critics we may perhaps be amused at the assumed dichotomy between form and content in this criticism, and at the rigid subordination of the former to the latter; yet the objections to James's revisions are still very much with us, even if the arguments pro and con have become more sophisticated. 2 The controversy between revisionists and anti-revisionists has grown in complexity and intensity since the New York Edition began to appear in 1907, with the disagreements often being based on differing assumptions about James's development. Anti-revisionists frequently maintain that he reached the apex of his art with The Portrait of a Lady or perhaps The Bostonians , while revisionists find his greatest achievements in the last three major novels. What complicates this controversy over the revisions is the number of stopping places between the original editions and the final revisions of his works. Forty years ago PMLA could print an article on James's revisions that assumed there were only two relevant editions of Roderick Hudson instead of the seven editions and three sets of revisions that are now known. 3 Yet the discovery of a number of intermediate texts and revisions has not really dissipated the disagreements between revisionists and anti-revisionists because they mainly concern the revisions made for the New York Edition. What has not been clearly enough recognized in the controversy, however, is that the significance of these late revisions depends rather heavily on the nature of the unrevised or preceding text. If it is clear, as a contemporary of the New York Edition maintained in 1908, that "Mr. James wrote better English thirty years ago than he writes to-day," 4 is it also clear that his English of 1888 is better? And what about the prose of 1898?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The answer to the question which is the best text of a given novel of Henry James — the unrevised, first revised, second revised, third or even fourth revised — depends above all on what the given novel is. The answer, to borrow James's own words from a slightly different context in the preface to The Spoils of Poynton , is to be found in "the logic of the particular case," a logic to be found in the circumstances of composition, publication, revision, and republication. The purpose of this paper is to examine the logic of that particular case The Spoils of Poynton in order to determine the best text and to see what light a study of James's revisions of the novel throws on an understanding of the Spoils in particular and on James's habits and patterns of revision in general. Four different texts of The Spoils of Poynton were published during James's lifetime. The original serialization of the novel under the title "The Old Things" appeared in The Atlantic Monthly in 1896. The first American and first English editions appeared, a week apart, in February, 1897, 5 and in 1908 the novel was published again in the New York Edition. The differences between the serial and the three editions of the novel are not merely the result of being set by different printers. James himself carefully revised each of the first three texts as he prepared it for republication. Nearly 3,400 changes are to be found between the four texts, and they range in importance from the deletion of a comma to the change of the novel's title. 6</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II "The Old Things" appeared in seven installments in The Atlantic Monthly from April to October, 1896. About a year earlier James had written to William Dean Howells that he was really not sorry he was rarely able to sell his fiction to magazines anymore: I have always hated the magazine form, magazine conditions and manners, and much of the magazine company. . . . The money-difference will be great—but not so great after a bit as at first. . . . 7 Excepting Sarah Orne Jewett's The Country of the Pointed Firs , about all that can be said for the quality of the fiction that kept "The Old Things" company is that it was not so bad as the magazine's poetry. But what the fiction lacked in quality, it made up for in quantity. Including James's and Sarah Orne Jewett's work, for example, the September, 1896, issue of the Atlantic contained the installments of six different fictional serials. Among the objectionable "magazine conditions" that affected "The Old Things" was the absence, after the first installment, of any indication that the serial would be continued; nor was there any evidence that the seventh installment was the last. Given the characteristic inconclusiveness of the last chapter, one wonders how many Atlantic readers waited patiently for another installment. James was quite fortunate, however, in the "magazine form" imposed upon "The Old Things" by its division into installments. James knew in advance, of course, that his work was to be serialized, but what kept him from planning any definite structure through the installments was his inability to tell how long his fiction was going to be. He had contracted with Horace Scudder, the editor of the Atlantic , for a fifteen-thousand-word story and he delivered an eighty-thousand-word novel. 8 Up until very nearly the end of the novel James did not know how many chapters or installments his novel would make. Yet with or without James's help—it is impossible to tell now—the Atlantic 's seven installments of "The Old Things" preserve the scenic structure of the novel. 9 Nowhere do the installment divisions interrupt a scene that is continued for more than one chapter, although there are some tempting opportunities, such as Mrs. Brigstock's dramatic entrance at the end of Chapter XIV. As printed in the Atlantic , the installments emphasize not suspense but the rhythm of increasingly long scenes. Even the lengthy scene of three chapters between Mrs. Gereth and Fleda near the end of the novel is not interrupted, but presented as the entire penultimate installment. If he could not complain about its division into installments, James had good grounds for objecting to the systematic overpunctuation that the "magazine form" seems to have imposed on "The Old Things." Almost all dashes in James's text were preceded by commas; all pauses in a sentence, all non-restrictive and quite a few restrictive modifiers, and numerous adverbs and adverbial phrases were surrounded with punctuation. The following sentence illustrates the result: Owen, as if in quest of his umbrella, looked vaguely about the hall,—looked even, wistfully, up the staircase,— . . . . Since James's typescript of "The Old Things" was apparently destroyed by the Atlantic after the serial was set, it is impossible to tell how closely his copy was followed. Yet with the exception of "Glasses"— which the Atlantic published in February, 1896, and punctuated in the same way as "The Old Things"—none of James's printed or holograph writings around the time of "The Old Things" shows the proliferation of commas to be found in that novel. 10 And when "Glasses" reappeared in Embarrassments in June, 1896, the superfluous commas had been omitted. It is improbable that James would have been taking out commas in one text at the same time that he was putting them into another. Apart from the Atlantic 's overpunctuation, there is no evidence that the serial is not a reliable reproduction of James's typescript. 11 Yet "The Old Things" is far from being the best text of The Spoils of Poynton . In addition to the less significant title, the serial has a number of grammatical errors, infelicitous sentences, and unfortunate ambiguities. There is also one unnoticed miracle in the story with the death and resurrection of Fleda's father. Such an error is not particularly surprising, however, for James did not consider serial publication a permanent form for his work. An unpublished letter to Scudder shows that James did not even see proof for "The Old Things." 12 His main purpose in serialization was simply money; a carefully revised text could wait until the work appeared as a book. There is a less important, though for bibliographers perhaps more interesting, reason for serialization to be found in the description of the writer Dencombe in James's story "The Middle Years." Dencombe was "a passionate corrector, a fingerer of style" whose ideal would have been to publish secretly, and then, on the published text, treat himself to the terrified revise, sacrificing always a first edition and beginning for posterity and even for the collectors, poor dears, with a second. 13 Serializing a novel in The Atlantic Monthly was hardly publishing it secretly, yet the process did approach Dencombe's ideal in providing an opportunity for a "revise"—terrified or not—before The Spoils of Poynton appeared in book form.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III James's customary practice was to have the first editions of his novels appear about the same time as their final serialized installments. Nevertheless, the first American and English editions of the Spoils were not published until February, 1897, nearly four months after the serial had ended. They were delayed because James's English publisher, William Heinemann, was scheduled to bring out in the fall of 1896 the first edition of The Other House —the novel James converted from a play after writing the Spoils —as it ended its serial in The Illustrated London News . 14 The Spoils was put off until 1897 so as not to compete with The Other House which, because of its serialization, could not be published earlier. 15 This delay in the publication of Heinemann's edition of the Spoils probably accounts for the most striking fact about the two first editions of the novel: the differences between the two texts. The Boston and London first editions have in common more than twelve hundred revisions from "The Old Things." Yet apart from national differences in spelling and punctuation, there are nearly six hundred variant readings between the two first editions that appeared within a week of each other. These variants reveal that James obviously did not revise his serial once for both editions. The even greater number of identical readings to be found in both first editions but not in the serial reveals that James did not revise his serial independently for each edition. Since the American edition follows the serial in most of the variants between the two editions, it appears that the first American edition was the intermediate text in a sequence of revisions from the serial to the first English edition. An unpublished letter to the editor of the Atlantic reveals that James did not originally intend to revise the same novel twice within four months. 16 James hoped to send Houghton, Mifflin, the American publishers of both the Atlantic and the Spoils , revised proofsheets of the first English edition that Heinemann had already contracted to publish. What appears to have happened instead is that Heinemann set up the English first edition, after it had been delayed by The Other House , from the revised sheets of the first American edition which in turn had been set up from revised sheets of the Atlantic installments. When he revised the serial for the first American edition, James made more than fourteen hundred changes. Most of these were merely fingerings of style—minor changes in punctuation, diction, and syntax. He removed many of the Atlantic 's superfluous commas, and he tightened and clarified his sentence structure by bringing subjects and verbs closer together and by changing parenthetical or relative clauses to nouns or participial phrases. Some revisions corrected solecisms or awkwardnesses in "The Old Things," as, for example, the changing of a misplaced phrase that had described Fleda's and Owen's eyes catching sounds through a door. In general the diction of the first American edition is more exact than that of the serial. Certain non-Jamesean ambiguities were dropped—as in the plumbing image that James suppressed by changing a "flushed and overflowing Sunday" to a "flushed and huddled Sunday." In revisions that involved more than stylistic changes, James altered the ages of Mrs. Gereth (she becomes "young in the fifties" instead of "young at fifty" and she has been married twenty-six instead of twenty-four years) and Fleda's father (he becomes fifty-seven instead of fifty-five). These changes imply that Fleda and Owen are perhaps a little older in the first American edition than in "The Old Things." In the first American edition only Fleda's mother is dead and Fleda is meagerly supported by her father who collects his own kinds of old things; there is no mention of a grandfather. Fleda's impressions of Owen Gereth were subjected to an interesting series of alterations that de-emphasize Owen as a stupid boy and thus increase the plausibility of his attractiveness to Fleda. In the first chapter of the serial Fleda is described as feeling that Owen was "singularly handsome and admirably stupid" but after the first revision Owen is "absolutely beautiful and delightfully dense." Again in the first chapter, the description of Owen as a "bouncing boy" is dropped, and further on in the novel his "stupidity" is changed twice to "heaviness." 17 The most important single change from the serial to the first American edition was the title. In changing it from "The Old Things" to The Spoils of Poynton James continued to identify the house and furnishings as the center of his novel—a center also stressed in the earlier working title, the "House Beautiful" and "The Great House." 18 The final title adds something more, however; through irony it implies that the old things of Poynton are spoils not only because they are fruits of battle, 19 but also because they spoil all the human relationships in the novel by occupying such a central place in them. The title also suggests that ultimately the characters themselves—including Fleda Vetch—become the spoils of Poynton as they are morally affected by the old things. Other changes in imagery made during the first revision developed images implicit in the serial. 20 An effective example of this is seen in the way James revised his description of Poynton so as to make it more specific without getting into the difficulties of making it more detailed. In "The Old Things" Poynton is described as follows: Poynton was the history of a devotion. The devotion had been jealous, but it had not been narrow; there reigned a splendid rigor, but it rested on a deep curiosity. This fine example of the Jamesean Vague was revised as follows for the first American edition: Poynton was the record of a life. It was written in great syllables of color and form, the tongues of other countries and the hands of rare artists.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Even if his resemblance to the "passionate corrector" Dencombe is accepted, it is difficult to see why, within four months of revising it for the first American edition, James again revised The Spoils of Poynton for the first English edition. It is unlikely that he had forgotten his recent revision, and there is no evidence, as with The Ambassadors , 21 that the circumstances of publication led him to revise even part of his serial independently for the London edition. Whatever the reason, James kept almost all the changes he had made for the first American edition, and in addition he made some five hundred more revisions. Less that a fifth of these affected changes James had already made in his first revision. Only occasionally in these revisions of revisions did James return to readings found in the serial—as when he omitted a passage, added only in the first American edition, comparing Owen's behavior at Maggie's to his "cheerful slowness" at Ricks. Most of the alterations made in the second revision of the Spoils closely resemble the kinds of changes James made in the first. He continued, for instance, to remove extra commas and tighten his syntax. Changes in diction tend, as in the first revision, towards greater accuracy and specificity. Mrs. Gereth tries to "rub up" a glimmer in Owen's mind instead of attempting to "invoke" it, and Fleda feels not simply Owen's "lips" on her face, but his "warm lips." The most extensive addition to the first English edition is only a sentence spoken by Mrs. Gereth to Fleda on the latter's ignorance of the brutes that men are; the interpolated remark adds another detail to the treatment that Fleda receives from Mrs. Gereth after revealing her love for Owen. The greater consistency of its punctuation and the increased precision of its diction make the first English edition of the Spoils something of an improvement over the first American edition. Beyond this, the second revision corrected a number of typographical errors in the first American edition, while introducing only a very few new ones of its own. There is, in short, no sound bibliographical reason why it should not be preferred over the Boston edition, and it is not surprising that James used the London edition as the basis for his third set of revisions of The Spoils of Poynton that he made for the New York Edition of his works. 22</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V Volume X of the New York Edition appeared in 1908, and it contained, in addition to "A London Life" and "The Chaperon," the third, final, and most extensive revision of the Spoils . The nearly fifteen hundred new readings in this revision—most of which replaced words and passages unaltered in the earlier editions—are not the kinds of changes James had made during the first two revisions of the novel. Although he continued to remove commas whenever there was a chance, his changes in syntax went beyond those in the earlier revisions. James achieved in his third revision a more highly compressed style by deleting a large number of relative and personal pronouns and by transforming subordinate clauses into phrases. The extensive use of contractions and the frequent inversion of the normal word order of a sentence are additional characteristics of James's late style that are noticeable in the New York Edition revisions of the Spoils . The most frequent type of change that James made in the diction of his novel was the continued addition of specific descriptive details. Sometimes this was done merely by adding descriptive nouns: "a tussle, dishevelment, shrieks" becomes "a tussle, dishevelment, pushes, scratches, shrieks." Occasionally these changes in wording have a greater significance, as when the end of the "business" of Fleda's relations with Owen becomes the end of "dreams and realities," or when the description of Mrs. Gereth's behavior towards Fleda changes from "a sort of brutality of good intentions" to "a high brutality of good intentions." 23 As these revisions show, James's changes in diction for the New York Edition are often changes in imagery. James did not introduce new patterns of imagery into the Spoils , as he seems to have done in revising some of his earlier works for the New York Edition, 24 but he did add important images to the novel. The battle imagery is added to when Mrs. Gereth blanches as if she had heard "of the landing, there on her coast, of a foreign army" instead of the sound of an autumn wind. James also utilized opportunities—neglected for some reason in his first two revisions—to change the phrase "the old things" to "the spoils" three times. Once he significantly altered "gone" to "spoiled" in describing Fleda's realization of what happened to her secret of Owen's love. Such a change emphasizes again how the spoils of Poynton ruin the relationships in the novel. In another revealing change James stressed Fleda's position in the social worlds of Poynton and Waterbath—a position not often noted by critics. To the description that the only thing in the world that Fleda had was a feeling of suspense, James added the sentence, "It was, morally speaking, like figuring in society with the wardrobe of one garment." Practicing speaking, Fleda was, of course, figuring in the society of the novel with a one-garment wardrobe. The significance of some of the changes made in the third revision of the Spoils extends beyond the particular novel that James was revising, and through them "the logic of the particular case" illuminates the New York Edition revisions of other works. In his general explanation of his revisions for his collected works, James mentioned two particular kinds of improvements he thought he had made: the improvement of the " vicâ-voce " quality of his prose, and the addition of an "immense array of terms, perceptional and expressional, that . . . simply looked over the heads of the standing terms. . . ." 25 The sound of James's prose was improved in the third revision of the Spoils and in the other works of the New York Edition through the use of contractions, alliteration, and balanced phrases. The improvements that resulted from the change in "perceptional and expressional" terms is perhaps more questionable. In looking over the heads of the more ordinary terms, they tend to stand out rather conspicuously. The following words and phrases, for example, were all substituted in the last revision of the Spoils for the "perceptional" term hesitated which James used so frequently to describe the reactions of his characters: gasped, wondered, debated, dropped, faltered, cast about, hung fire, hung back, took it so, rather floundered, thought again, waited for thought, had a pause, failed of presence of mind for a moment, seemed for an instant to have to walk around it. Not all of these changes are elegant variations, however; in its context the last circumlocution is a neat description of Owen Gereth's reaction to a "fairly simple" statement by Fleda. How revisions such as these can throw light on James's revisions of other works can be seen, for example, in the assertion that James's changes of the word "perceived" to "felt" in his revisions of "The Turn of the Screw" show that he was trying "to alter the governess's testimony from that of things observed and perceived to things felt ." 26 But this same kind of change is one of the more frequent ones made in the New York Edition of the Spoils , and it is improbable that James was also trying to stress the delusions of the characters in that novel. Other types of revision that extend beyond "the logic of the particular case" are revisions of anti-Semitic remarks 27 and authorial intrusions in the novel. James changed one authorial "I" to "we" and modified another so as to leave in the author but take out his self-consciously deprecating remark. 28 These changes together with a half dozen or so unrevised intrusions that survived all three revisions of the novel indicate that James's technique of point of view in the Spoils did not preclude his direct use of the first-person author behind that point of view, a point of view which — except when it belongs to a narrator in the fiction — is almost always set forth by an omniscient, reserved, but present author. Sooner or later in any study of James's—and perhaps anyone else's— revisions, it must be frankly admitted that many of the changes are inexplicable. 29 Who can say with plausibility why James changed "a motive magnificent" to "a motive superb" and then again to "a motive splendid"? These inexplicable changes should not be ignored, however. When a writer makes nearly 3,400 changes in revising a novel three times, it is not difficult to find evidence among them for almost any critical thesis; with an admitted ballast of inexplicable changes, it is possible to go farther with the explicable ones. But before a critic uses or an editor accepts or rejects an author's revisions, he ought if possible to ascertain why the author undertook them. In his prefaces to the New York Edition James was quite explicit about his motives for revising. In the preface to Roderick Hudson he briefly justified his revisions on the grounds that "the only detachment" of an author from his work is "the detachment of aversion"; but if the work is going to be republished, then, the creative intimacy is reaffirmed, and appreciation, critical apprehension, insists on becoming as active as it can. Who shall say, granted this, where it shall not begin and where it shall consent to end? 30 Many of James's commentators have felt able to say, if not where his revisions should have started, at least where they should have stopped, and usually their dicta are based on conclusions about the unfortunateness of his development as a writer. James, of course, was convinced that his development and his revisions were for the best. Thus his ultimate justification of his revisions, as set forth involutedly at the end of his last preface to the New York Edition, was a moral one. On all the ground to which the pretention of performance by a series of exquisite laws may apply there reigns one sovereign truth—which decrees that, as art is nothing if not exemplary, care nothing if not active, finish nothing if not consistent, the proved error is the base apologetic deed, the helpless regret is the barren commentary, and "connexions" are employable for finer purposes than mere gaping contrition. 31 This explanation of what was a moral necessity for James does not answer the question of whether or not his final revisions ultimately resulted in the best text of The Spoils of Poynton . The logic of the particular case that is the Spoils shows, however, that they did. The only responsible alternative to the New York Edition of the novel is the first English edition. "The Old Things" is the most inaccurate and badly written of the four texts, and the first American edition is not a completely consistent revision of these faults. 32 There is, in short, no good bibliographical reason—though there may still be financial ones because of copyright—for ignoring James's final intentions concerning the Spoils . There are, on the contrary, good reasons, apart from the revised text itself, why the New York Edition is better than any other version of the Spoils . James's famous preface to the Spoils (including his explanation of why he grouped the novel with "A London Life" and "The Chaperon") should certainly accompany any edition of the novel, though the most logical text it should preface is the one it was written for. This is also true of the photographic frontispiece to Volume X of the New York Edition. The most consistently neglected feature of that edition are its frontispieces; even the recent expensive reprinting of the edition by Scribners omits them. James himself presided over the making of these frontispieces, giving instructions to the photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn about where the subjects of the pictures might be found, and selecting the ones that were used in the New York Edition. Consequently, these photographs are significant, if oblique, comments by the author on his work. The frontispiece to Volume X is entitled "Some of the Spoils," and it was photographed at the famous Wallace Collection in London. 33 It shows a setting of furniture which includes a firescreen with a panel of Gobelin tapestry, a bronze musical clock on the mantlepiece along with two candelabra, and two Louis XVI chairs flanking the fireplace. 34 The effect of this frontispiece is similar to the others whose function James himself described in the preface to The Golden Bowl . Rather than compete with the fiction, each frontispiece was to plead its case with some shyness, that of images always confessing themselves mere optical symbols or echoes, expressions of no particular thing in the text, but only of the type or idea of this or that thing. They were to remain at the most small pictures of our "set" stage with the actors left out. . . . 35 The optical echoes of the frontispiece to the Spoils remind the reader again of how the spoils themselves at the center of the novel are, in the words of the preface, "full of suggestion, clearly, as to their possible influence on other passions and other relations." 36 A definitive edition of The Spoils of Poynton that did not present to the reader their optical suggestions along with James's preface and final revisions would not live up to its author's ideals of exemplary art, active care, and consistent finish.</field>

Murdock (1947), pp. 206, 251, and 256. Important unpublished letters, including all those referred to in this paper, are now at the Houghton Library, Harvard University; these letters may not be quoted until Professor Leon Edel's edition of James's correspondence appears. 9 The installment divisions occur after Chapters IV, VI, IX, XIII, XVI, XIX, and XXII. 10 See, for example, the frontispiece of James's Notebooks , the printed entries of 1896, "The Altar of the Dead" first published in Terminations (1895), and "The Other House" serialized in The Illustrated London News from July 4th to September 26th, 1896. 11 An error in Percy Lubbock's edition of James's letters (I, 246) has led to the confusing of The Other House with The Spoils of Poynton in the matter of dictation. The crisis of serialization that James refers to in his letter happened with The Other House not the Spoils . Writer's cramp prevented James from turning out installments of The Other House in time for The Illustrated London News , and this forced him to begin dictating the novel. That the Spoils was handwritten seems clear from unpublished letters to Scudder where James refers to sending his manuscript off to the typist before mailing it the Atlantic . 12 The letter was written from Point Hill, Playden, Sussex, and dated May 21, 1896. 13 "The Middle Years," Terminations , p. 166. 14 In an unpublished letter from De Vere Gardens, London, to his brother, dated October 30, 1896, James mentioned that the Spoils was being held back so it would not interfere with the sales of The Other House . 15 Clement Shorter, the editor of The Illustrated London News , was worried that the premature appearance of The Other House would cut down the sales of the serial; James reassured him that the first edition would be delayed. See Letters to an Editor , privately printed by Clement Shorter (London, 1916), p. 11. 16 Written from Point Hill, Playden, Sussex, May 21, 1896. 17 James also made some small additions to the first American edition. In Chapter XVI, towards the end of the final scene between Fleda and Owen, he added, for example, a description of the uneasy Owen as he appeared to Fleda just before she asks her ominous question about when Mrs. Brigstock was to have returned home to her daughter. The effect of the interpolation is to prepare for and thus emphasize the question. 18 See James's Notebooks , p. 207, and unpublished letters to Scudder, one written from De Vere Gardens, London, on December 18, 1895 and another dated only "Wednesday." 19 The change to war imagery in the revised title is reinforced by at least three other additional images of battle in the first American edition. 20 Alexander Holder-Barell's The Development of Imagery and its Functional Significance in Henry James's Novels (1959) uses the serial and the New York Edition revisions of the Spoils , among other novels, to study the development of James's imagery. By not considering the revisions in imagery made for the first editions, the author attributes to James's developing use of imagery in his final revisions some changes that were, in fact, made within a year of the original writing of "The Old Things." And two of the three "added" images cited in the discussion of "The Old Things" (pp. 27-28 and notes 18-21, pp. 161-162) are actually to be found in the original text—including the one described by the author as "the most significant added image in the novel." 21 See "Editions and Revisions," The Ambassadors : A Norton Critical Edition, ed. S. P. Rosenbaum (1964), pp. 353-362. 22 Evidence that the New York Edition revisions were based on the first English edition is to be seen in the nearly five hundred readings in which the New York Edition follows the first English edition but differs from the earlier texts. If the New York Edition were based on the serial or on the first American edition, one would expect to find more than the some fifty readings in which the New York Edition ignores a change in the first English edition and reverts to a reading in one of the earlier texts. 23 Another noteworthy change of a word, which may have been only the correction of a misprint unnoticed in the previous two revisions, is the change of a noun used by Mrs. Gereth in denouncing the consequences of Fleda's passion for Owen. In the first three texts it is the "insanity" of the passion she criticizes, but in the New York Edition it is more aptly the "inanity" of Fleda's passion that she attacks. 24 See, for example, Isadore Traschen's studies of the revisions of The American in AL , XXVI (1954), 67-77, and New England Quarterly , XXIX (1956), 43-62. 25 The Art of the Novel : Critical Prefaces by Henry James, ed. R. P. Blackmur (1934), pp. 339, 346-7. 26 See Leon Edel's letter, Times Literary Supplement (March 12, 1949), p. 169. 27 In the first three texts of the Spoils , for instance, Mrs. Gereth implicitly describes herself as "the greatest Jew, who had ever tracked a victim" in her hunt for spoils. In the New York Edition she is "the craftiest stalker, who had ever tracked big game." The Dreyfus Case, which occurred between the second and third revisions of the novel, may have been behind these changes. (See James's praise of Zola's J'accuse! in "Fourteen Letters," ed. Henry Brewster, Botteghe Oscure , XIX (1957), 194.) Some anti-Semitic remarks in James's other works were not revised, however. 28 James dropped the last seven words of the following: "Save on one other occasion, at which we shall in time arrive, little as the reader may believe it. . . ." 29 On rare occasions changes become explicable in conjunction with biographical details. James's mention of someone's "works" that Owen considers giving Fleda for her services is qualified in the New York Edition to works of the kind usually sold by subscription. The New York Edition itself was sold only by subscription. 30 Art of the Novel , p. 11. 31 Art of the Novel , p. 348. 32 Ironically, until the recent reprinting of the New York Edition, the first American was the only edition in circulation in the United States. It was even the basis for a French translation of the Spoils incorrectly entitled Le Sort de Poynton , which appeared in La Revue de Paris in 1928. (In 1954 the same translation was reissued under the more accurate title, Les Dépouilles de Poynton .) 33 I am grateful to Mr. Coburn for this information. The interesting story of Mr. Coburn's photographs for the New York Edition was told by him in a talk entitled "Illustrating Henry James by Photography" for the British Broadcasting Corporation Third Programme, July 17, 1953. 34 The furniture in the photograph is identifiable from F. J. B. Watson's Furniture: Wallace Collection Catalogues (1956), pp. 63-64, 90, 141, and 186-187. 35 Art of the Novel , p. 333. The "set" for the Spoils as pictured in the frontispiece nevertheless manages to contradict the text in two minor ways. The wallpaper, or perhaps wall-brocade, in the photograph, and the two pictures, one on top of the other, do not fit in with the descriptions of Poynton as having "not many pictures" and "not an inch of pasted paper anywhere," ( The Spoils of Poynton , (1908), X, 22). 36 The Art of the Novel , p. 123.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE DATE OF Cocke Lorelles Bote by Paul R. Baumgartner</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The scholarly efforts of E. Gordon Duff, R. B. McKerrow, Frank Isaac and others notwithstanding, a number of the minor works printed by Wynkyn de Worde remain at best only tentatively dated. One of the most interesting of these uncertainly dated works is the anonymous early Tudor poem Cocke Lorelles Bote which survives in a single copy in the Garrick Collection at the British Museum. The surviving copy is not complete; the six A pages are missing, the poem beginning with B1. Except for the lost A pages, however, the book is in fair condition and the black-letter printing by Wynkyn de Worde is quite legible. As a literary type Cocke Lorelles Bote is related to medieval fool-satire literature, English popular literature (ballads, broadsides, jest-books), and sixteenth-century English rogue literature. Like the work of Sebastian Brant and his medieval predecessors, the poem makes use of the allegorical device of a ship and a religious order as well as an order of fools or knaves; it involves an allegorical voyage around England and is often satirical in tone. On the other hand, like the work of Harman, Awdeley, and Greene, Cocke Lorelles Bote is realistic, merry, and non-moral. Moreover, the poem gives the impression of dealing with local and contemporary events, cataloguing the crafts and trades of the time, crudely describing in great detail low-life characters, and naming specific persons and places. Thus the Bote marks a transitional stage in the development from medieval didacticism and allegory to the sociological realism of the rogue pamphleteers. Cocke Lorelles Bote has been reprinted privately four times, the best reprint being that of E. F. Rimbault for the Publications of the Percy Society (Vol. VI) in 1843. 1 Each of the reprints, however, simply reproduces, more or less accurately and without critical apparatus, the original copy. No effort is made to date the poem accurately. Rimbault's introduction to the poem, for example, merely assumes that it was inspired by Barclay's Ship of Fools and was written not long after that work. Since both Cocke Lorelles Bote and the tradition to which it belongs have been the subject of a number of recent studies, 2 it might be well at this time to attempt a more precise dating of the poem. Scholars who have commented on the poem tend to date it around 1510 or later, seeing in it the influence of either Barclay's or Watson's version of the Ship of Fools (both printed in 1509), but John M. Berdan, with little evidence, argued for a date closer to 1500. The stanza form, the frequent "monorime," the irregular scansion and the repetition indicated to Berdan that the poem belonged to the Medieval Latin tradition and was written before the kind of verse found in the Ship of Fools became popular. 3 C. H. Herford, on the other hand, believed that Cocke Lorelles Bote represented a fusion of two separate chapters in Brant (48 "Gesellenschiff" and 108 "Schluraffenschiff") which had been put together by Barclay in his adjoining chapters 108 and 109, called "The unyuersall shyp and general Bark or barge" and "The Unyuersall shyp of crafty men or laborers." Herford argued that the first stanza of chapter 108 in Barclay had directly influenced the author of the Bote and he further stated that "all five woodcuts in Cock Lorell's Bote are free imitations of the Ship of Fools ." 4 This last remark suggests that Herford did not study carefully the relation of Cocke Lorelles Bote to the various versions of the Ship of Fools , for Aurelius Pompen in his detailed study of the English versions later demonstrated that the woodcuts used for the Bote were the same as those used in Watson's prose version of the Ship of Fools . From this fact, however, Pompen incautiously concluded that Cocke Lorelles Bote derived from Watson's translation and dated after it. 5 The four woodcuts in Cocke Lorelles Bote are the same as those used for chapters 18, 19, 77, and 108 of Watson's text, and woodcut #108, a picture of a ship full of fools with the motto "Gaudeam' Oēs," is used twice in the Bote just as in Watson. "It is this picture," says Pompen, "and little else that has inspired that remarkable fragment known as Cocke Lorelles bote ." From Pompen's facts, however, it is not necessary to hold that Cocke Lorelles Bote was written after 1509. Though Watson's version of the Ship of Fools was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1509, it is not known when it was written or when the woodcuts were produced. There is no sign of deterioration in the woodcuts used for Cocke Lorelles Bote . Moreover, as Pompen himself shows, the idea of an infinite number of fools and the allegorical device of a ship to carry them in were very popular around the turn of the century. The popularity of these ideas is sufficient to account for the writing of the Bote without supposing it to have been inspired by a single woodcut. Wynkyn de Worde may well have commissioned the writing of Cocke Lorelles Bote to test the popularity of the theme before coming out with a full-scale version of the Ship of Fools . At any rate, there is little evidence for dating the poem after 1509, but there is some for dating it earlier, perhaps between 1506 and 1509.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Internal Evidence : In Cocke Lorelles Bote are the following interesting lines: Syr this pardon is newe founde By syde London brydge in a holy grounde Late called the stewes banke Ye knowe well all that there was Some relygyous women in that place To whome men offred many a franke And bycause they were so kynde and lyberall A merueylous auenture there is be fall Yf ye lyst to here how There came suche a wynde fro wynchester That blewe these women ouer the ryuer In wherye as I wyll you tell Some at saynt Kateryns stroke a grounde And many in holborne were founde Some at saynt Gyles I trowe Also in aue maria aly and at westmenster And some in shordyche drewe theder With grete lamentacyon And by cause they haue lost that fayre place They wyll bylde at colman hedge in space A nother noble mansyon Fayrer and euer the halfe strete was (151-172). Alexander Dyce, in the notes to his edition of the works of John Skelton, cites this passage in Cocke Lorelles Bote . "The winde from Winchester," writes Dyce, "alludes to the temporary suppression of the Southwarke stews at the intercession of the Bishop of Winchester." 6 Dyce gives neither the date of this suppression nor the source of his information. In John Stow's Survey of London , however, we find the following passage: "Also Robert Fabian writeth that in the yeare 1506 the 21. of Henry the seuenth, the saide stewe houses in Southwarke were for a season inhibited, and the dores close vp, but it was not long saith he, ere the houses there were set open againe." 7 Richard Fox was the Bishop of Winchester in 1506 and he was in a position to "inhibit" the stews, for he was the landlord. In a Harleian MS (293, ff.62-67) for 1506 there is a transcript of "Ordinances touching the governance of the stewhoulders in Southwarke under the direction of the bishope of Winchester, instituted in the tyme of Henry the Second." Thomas Fuller in his Church History (1648) also refers to the suppression of the stews by the Bishop of Winchester in 1506. 8 No doubt Dyce is right in his explanation of the allusion but there is another side to the matter. Fabian's original chronicle ended with the year 1485; the second edition, printed in 1532, included continuations to the year 1509 but most likely by another person. Now the reference to the temporary suppression of the stews for which Stow cites Fabian as his authority does not appear in this printed continuation of Fabian and I was unable to discover an actual source for Stow's remarks. In the printed continuation of Fabian, however, we do find the following interesting entry for the year 1506: "And vpon the euyn of seynt Maury, began an hidious wind, which endured vppon xi. dayes folowynge, more or lasse, in contynuall blowyng, by meane whereof the wedercok of Poules was blowen downe, &amp; moche other harme done." 9 Also in Hall's Chronicle , in the entry for 1506, the 21st year of Henry VII's reign, we find mentioned a great tempest which was "wonderful straunge to many men, because the violencie of the wynde had blowen doune an Egle of brasse . . . fro a pynnacle or spire of Paules church." 10 The writer of Cocke Lorelles Bote is surely combining in his allusion two historical events. The big "wynde fro wynchester" refers both to the restraining order from the Bishop against the stews and to the real wind which blew from the south and toppled the weathercock of St. Paul's on the London side. The earliest date for the poem, then, is 1506. What of the latest date for the poem? First, the events alluded to seem fresh in the mind of the poet. Secondly, the lines seem to imply that the "relygyous women" (prostitutes), having crossed the river in ferries ("In wherye"), settled chiefly at Colman hedge and that the stews on the bank side were by and large inoperative at the time of writing. Now we have seen Stow citing Fabian to the effect that "it was not long ere the houses there were set open againe." And Fuller, though he may be relying on Stow, assures us that the suppression was not long effective and that the stew houses were soon again in full operation (no dates are given). 11 Moreover in literature between 1506 and 1509 we find continued reference to the popularity of the stews. Though not conclusive, these facts argue that the poem was written not long after 1506 — two or three years at the most.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">External Evidence : In a study for the Bibliographical Society, Frank Isaac made a specific, though still preliminary, classification of Wynkyn de Worde's type for the purpose of dating that printer's undated books. Following E. G. Duff's earlier and more general study, 12 Isaac finds that Wynkyn brought to his new premises at the Sign of the Sun in Flete Street "two textura, Duff 4 (95 mm.) and Duff 8 (95 mm.), and one rotunda, Duff 9 (53 mm.). Of these, 4 lasted only a short time and is not found in a dated book after 1502. The other two he used until his death." 13 Type 95 (Duff 8), according to Isaac, is the one most frequently used by Wynkyn in the sixteenth century. From time to time, however, some of the letters were recut and the small differences found can be used as an approximate guide for dating the undated books. Final s (s 1 ), for example, is recut four times between 1501 and 1536 (s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , s 4 ), beginning as a rather blunt letter and ending with a curling top serif. Isaac gives specimens of Wynkyn de Worde's dated work of different periods and identifies the types used as follows: 14 The Ordynarye of Crysten men (1502 ed.) Types 95: s 1 v 2 w 2 (small) y 1 62: a d 1 h 1 s v 2 y 2 The Ordynarye of Crysten Men (1506 ed.) Types 95: s 2 v 3 w 2 y 2 53 b : a 1 d 1 h 1 v 3 s 1 Richard Rolle's Contemplacyons (1506) h 1 s 2 w 2 (large) y 2 Fisher, Fruytfull Saynges of Dauyd (1508) Type 116: h (pointed) s (with serif) v 3 w 2 Ovid de Arte Amandi (1513) Types 95: s 2 v 3 62: a 1 h 1 s 1 w 5 (1513) w I have identified the type used in Cocke Lorelles Bote (not mentioned by Isaac) as follows: Types 95: s 2 v 3 w 2 (large) y 2 53 b : a 1 d 1 h 1 v 3 The type used for Cocke Lorelles Bote resembles most closely Isaac's examples for 1506. Moreover, the capital C and B, the &amp; sign, and the hyphen used in this poem differ from those in works before 1505 and are identical with those in works of 1506, 1507, and 1508. I was unable to discover any use of type 95:w 2 (large) in works dated after 1508. Further evidence for a date of 1506-8 for Cocke Lorelles Bote is found in the colophon to the poem. E. G. Duff tells us that "towards the end of 1508 when Pynson was appointed printer to the King, De Worde seems to have received some sort of official appointment as printer to the Countess of Richmond, which he notified in all his colophons up to her death in 1509: calling himself printer to the King's mother, and after the death of Henry VII, to the King's grandmother." 15 The colophon of the Nicodemus Gospel (1509) is an example: "Enprynted at London in Flete strete at the sygne of the sonne of Wynkyn de worde, printer vnto the moost excellent pryncess my lady the Kynges moder. In the yere of oure lorde god MCCCCC. ix. the xxiii daye of Marche." 16 Such notification is not in the colophon to Cocke Lorelles Bote . If Duff is correct and if, as I have argued, the poem was not written after 1509, then it must have been written and printed between 1506 and late 1508. But if these arguments for a terminal date of 1508 are not conclusive, there is additional evidence that the poem was not written after 1510 as some scholars have asserted. In 1938 A. H. Thomas and I. D. Thornley discovered and edited a valuable document called The Great Chronicle of London . In that work in the entry for the year 1509 during the mayorality of Stephan Genyn, the chronicler inserts several contemporary ballads dealing mostly with the villainies of Empson, Dudley, and one John Baptist de Grimaldi. In the longest of these ballads is this reference to Cocke Lorelles Bote : Avaunt captayn of knavys, ffor þ u In thy best coot Was evyr Capemarchaunt, of Cok lorellys boot. 17 The date of either the Chronicle or the ballad may be used to establish a terminal date for Cocke Lorelles Bote . The Chronicle is carefully dated by its editors between the years 1509 and Feb., 1513. Woodcuts, capital letters, and handwriting were thoroughly studied, but the conclusive piece of evidence for the terminal date is the fact that the chronicler refers to Pope Julian, who died in February, 1513, as still living (intro. and p. 338). This makes it certain that Cocke Lorelles Bote was written before February, 1513. But there remains the possibility of an earlier date for the ballad itself. The ballad refers to John Baptist as a "common Brocour of chevysaunce &amp; cursid usury" who put stones in ships to get more insurance and then caused the ships to sink at sea in order to collect the insurance (p. 359). Eventually, however, Baptist ran afoul of the law and was driven into hiding. To recover his freedom he joined a band of outlaws and deliberately had himself arrested for stealing a horse of "Rede colour." But since he was really innocent of this crime and could prove it, he was let off and could not be tried for earlier crimes as a usurer and broker (pp. 357-358). This affair seems to be the same as that recorded in C. P. R. Henry VII (ii 522, 564, 625) as follows: "John Baptist di Grimaldi, described as merchant of Genoa, alias of London, broker, had a protection 22 June, 1507, when at Calais with Gilbert Talbot, lieutenant of that town and castle. On 10 Oct., 1507, he was pardoned his outlawry in the Hustings of London in connection with proceedings against him on suspicion of treason, he having surrendered." A year and a half later he seems to have been again in prison, for he is mentioned as excepted from a general pardon issued on April 30th, 1509. But on 2 Feb, 1510, a warrant was issued for his pardon, and from that time on he appears no more in the records. 18 Now the ballad appears to refer also to this second arrest; several stanzas after the business of the "Rede" horse the poet speaks of John Baptist as if he were again incarcerated and about to be executed: Avaunt smokysh herytyk, that hast saylyd soo fferr To passe the stormy sees, and here to take an ende By paynfull deth, yit hast þ u cawse to thank Allmigthty God, that he such space the lend To take Repentaunce, ffor If on sees bank Thow had departid, ffrom this lyfe sodeynly Then body &amp; sawle, had been In Jupardy (p. 364). These lines seem to have been written while Grimaldi was still in prison; no mention is made of the warrant for his pardon in Feb., 1510. If these arrests in the ballad are the same as those referred to in the records of the reign of Henry VII, it is almost certain that the ballad was written before Feb., 1510. And since the ballad mentions "Cok lorellys boot," we can assign Feb., 1510 as the latest likely date for the composition of that poem.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">I The Court of Venus , a poetic miscellany which antedates Tottel by nearly if not quite two decades, is known today in three editions, of each of which only a single, fragmentary copy is extant. Strong probability that there were others is evidenced by the condition and rarity of these remains, attesting to the book's popularity, and by contemporary references. 3 Fraser describes and dates the extant fragments as follows: Bodleian Library, Douce.g.3 (B): lacking title page, but with running title The court of Venus for portion containing lyrics; printed by Thomas Gybson between 1537 (or November 1536 at earliest) and 1539. 8 , 15 leaves, E-F 8 (lacking F8). University of Texas Library, Miriam L. Stark Collection (S): lacking title page, but with running title A Boke of Balettes ; but may well have had a title page with The Court of Venus ; printed by William Copland between 1547 and 1549. 8 , 2 leaves, no signatures. Bound as end papers in a 1551 copy of More's Utopia . Folger Shakespeare Library (F): title page The Courte of Venus ; printed by Thomas Marshe between 1561 and 1564. 8 , 8 leaves, A 8 . "At least two editions of the Court have disappeared completely," Fraser believes. "There was probably an edition in 1549; there must have been another edition later than Marshe's 1561-1564 issue, to account for the continuing attacks on the Court . Presumably these editions were read to pieces, as was the first edition of Songs and Sonnets , only one copy of which survives" (p. 76). That an edition or more appeared later than F seems a reasonable conjecture, but the idea of one between S and F, especially in 1549, requires closer examination. A new appearance of the Court sometime between S and F is hypothesized by Fraser for these reasons: (1) The Court is attacked by name in the Prologue to North's Dial of Princes , first published in 1557, 4 and in the Works of Thomas Becon, dated 1564. But as Becon's Works were entered in 1560, Fraser concludes that his attack does not refer to F, which cannot have appeared before 1561. "Obviously, both Becon and North were attacking another edition, perhaps one that was contemporaneous with their writings and is now lost" (p. 65). (2) In an attack on vicious literature in his Certayn chapters takē out of the Prouerbes (1550), John Hall four times singles out for especial opprobrium "the court of Venus." It is not "likely that Hall was looking back more than a decade" to B, and we must remember that S, which might have appeared as late as 1549, was called (in the fragment we have) A Boke of Balettes (pp. 56-57, 22-24). (3) Although "Marshe was too slovenly a printer" to seek out improved texts in manuscript, F is related to S but textually superior to it — closer, says Fraser, to certain known manuscript evidence for Wyatt's text. This dilemma is solved if we posit an intermediate edition which Marshe, true to his practice, merely copied. Even the advertisement that appears on Marshe's title page may be a verbatim reprint from this lost edition: "Newly and diligently corrected with many proper Ballades newly amended, and also added thervnto which haue not before bene imprinted" (pp. 44-45). To satisfy these three needs, two distinct hypothetical editions are offered us. In 1557 Henry Sutton bought a license "to prynte this booke Called the Couurte of VENUS" (Stationers' Register, July 19). If he printed it (which does not necessarily follow) and did so about that time, his edition might answer the first and third requirements, but leaves unexplained John Hall's attack in 1550 on a recent (it is argued) book entitled The Court of Venus . Fraser mentions the possibility of Sutton's edition (pp. 11, 45) but does not see fit to include it in his summary of editions, as quoted above. Instead, he proposes a lost edition of 1549 — close on the heels of S. This would meet the second and third requirements but would be less helpful on the first. Professor R. H. Griffith ( TLS , September 4, 1930, p. 700) had suggested that perhaps Sutton printed an edition of the Court before 1557 and was only led to register it "to protect his copyright," threatened by the publication of some of the same poems by Tottel early in June. Taking up this hint, Fraser considers the possible identity of the 1549 edition he believes necessary and the edition to which the 1557 entry points; but as Sutton is not known to have printed till 1552, he rejects that possibility (pp. 23-24). Let us now examine the arguments for a lost 1549 edition in the light of the three reasons advanced by Fraser. First, is it necessary to postulate such an edition to account for the attacks by North and Becon? North's remark in 1557 is best taken as a response to a fresh Court of Venus — the presumptive edition registered by Sutton in that year. If Sutton registered but did not publish a Court , it is conceivable that North might have been referring to one published in 1549, but S fills that bill nicely. The fact that S does not call itself The Court of Venus is not significant enough to support a conjectural edition; "it is not at all unlikely," says Fraser (p. 24), that Griffith was right in suggesting that the lost title page of S identified it with the Court . The central question regarding Becon's remarks is, When were they written? We must first eliminate a certain confusion between two books of similar title, both associated with this reformer. The goldē boke of christen matrimonye (1542) advertised itself as "newly set forthe in English by Theodore Basille," which is Becon's pseudonym, but it had already appeared in December 1541 (STC 4045) under the name of Miles Coverdale as translator. To encourage the circulation of this tract Becon wrote a lengthy Preface to it; this Preface is Becon's only contribution to the 1542 volume. The title-page description, "newly set forthe" by Becon, echoes Becon's own language at the end of the Preface, and refers merely to Becon's role in promoting the republication; but it conveys as well a hint that Becon was the author: and perhaps this small deception is what the printer intended. Many years later, returned from exile, Becon wrote: Forasmuch as tyme hath brought her doughter Truth vnto light againe in these our dayes, . . . I being not a litle encouraged with y e blessed felicitie and happye state of thys our age, . . . haue at y e instant desire of certaine godly and zelous brethren reuised and diligently perused fyrst of al the bokes, which before .xx. yeares past I published and set forth vnder y e name of Theodore Bassille: which bokes I haue . . . now newly recognised and diligently corrected. . . . Forasmuch as a certayne boke treatyng of Matrimonie compyled by the great learned and famous Clerke Master Henry Bullinger in the Dutch [German] tonge, and translated into our speche by y e godly &amp; zelous man Master Myles Couerdale , . . . was also for the more redy sale set forth in my name by the hongry printer with my preface, to make it the more plausible to y e Readers: in place therof I haue written a new worke of Matrimonie, wherin I haue at large handled what soeuer may seme necessarily to appertayne vnto that matter. This is from the Preface (dated from Canterbury, 17 January 1564) to Volume I of Becon's collected Works (sig. hand C5 v ) of 1560-1564. The work whose origin is here described and which appears at the end of this first volume is The booke of Matrimony , a work of Becon's own which is quite distinct from The goldē boke of christen matrimonye . It was in The booke of Matrimony that Becon inveighed against The Court of Venus . He wrote of a "judgement" awaiting the English because they "banishe not, nor burn not" (as "the Lacedemonians" did), "but rather Print, publishe, setforth and sell baudy balades and filthy bookes vnto the corruption of the reders, as the court of Venus , and suche like wanton bookes" (sig. AAA1 v ). The context is a comparison of contemporary sexual mores with those of the past as evidenced by ancient laws and customs. The pages are broken up with many one- or two-line paragraphs citing specific instances; for some reason this example of the Lacedemonians has evoked a prolonged comment and a huffing glance at "vs Englishe men." It is clear that the whole program of revising his earlier works was "encouraged" by Elizabeth's accession to the throne. Thus Becon's reference to The Court of Venus was not penned until 1558 at least, and more likely after his return to England in 1559. Now one cannot positively rule out the possibility that Becon, at this date, singled out a 1549 book to condemn; but there is no need to posit a lost edition when we have S. Far more likely, however, is that a more recent edition aroused Becon to expand one of the items in his list of ancient laws into an attack on modern morals. As a returned exile he held great hopes for the reign of Elizabeth: "Tyme hath brought her doughter Truth vnto light againe. . . ." Especially in this context did a revival of The Court of Venus pose a threat which he must counter by name. Second, is it necessary to postulate a lost 1549 edition to account for the attack on The Court of Venus by John Hall? Chronologically there is no reason for Hall's attack not to have been aimed at S, which cannot be dated more narrowly than 1547-1549. Fraser points out (p. 24) that S may have been known to contemporaries as an edition of the Court . Yet he continues: "As a result of the work I have done on this subject, I feel sure that an edition of The Court of Venus appeared in 1549. I do not think that this edition is represented by the Stark fragment." The grounds on which we are to accept these statements are not clear to me, but what seems to be Fraser's main argument for them can be shown to be based on wrong facts. The edition of his Proverbs in which Hall attacks The Court of Venus by name exists in a unique copy in the Cambridge University Library, of which the title page bears the date "M.D.L." The same Library has, also uniquely, another edition, undated and with the title page missing. Both were printed by Thomas Raynalde. Fraser refers to this undated edition when he says, "In Hall's 1549 edition of the Proverbs , there is no mention of The Court of Venus ; the first attack occurs in the edition of 1550" (p. 22). This difference he explains by positing a new appearance of the Court between the "1549 edition" and 1550. It is not clear why this nova cannot be "represented by the Stark fragment." Still, let us examine Hall's two editions more closely. Fraser goes on: In the 1550 Proverbs the "rhymes of vanitie and songes of baudry" which John Hall thought characteristic of The Court of Venus were said by him to have been long used heretofore. But in Hall's 1549 edition of the Proverbs , on sig. A4 r of the Epistle Dedicatory, we find the phrase: "rimes of vanitie &amp; songes of baudrye the which of longe heretofore hath ben vsed." This is the same language as that employed by Hall a year later, save that The Court of Venus is not coupled with the phrase in the 1549 edition. Confusion is introduced here by the implication in the last sentence that in the 1550 edition The Court of Venus is mentioned in connection with the phrase "rhymes of vanitie and songes of baudry." This is inaccurate. As Fraser points out, the reference to "rhymes of vanitie" occurs in both editions. In both cases this phrase is in the Epistle Dedicatory, which is practically identical in both editions. In neither Epistle, that of the undated edition nor that of 1550, is The Court of Venus mentioned. If it were mentioned in the 1550 epistle but not the undated, then we might need to seek the reasons that led Hall to insert it. But Hall's references to it are not simple insertions. They occur four times in his "Preface to the Reader," which appears for the first and only time in the 1550 edition; Fraser (pp. 56-57) quotes from this Preface at length. It is not clear why Hall printed this Preface in 1550 and never again, but whatever the reasons they were probably quite unrelated to the Court , which is only incidentally mentioned. It should be added that all of the above argument is unnecessary apart from the assumption that the undated edition preceded that dated 1550. There are some reasons for reversing the order of these editions; it might prove more to the point to ask why the Preface mentioning the Court was deleted after 1550 rather than why it was added in 1550. But nothing short of another article could do justice to these matters. To develop the point here is unnecessary, since it is clear that even if the designation "1549 edition" be accurate, the lack of a reference to the Court in that edition does not necessitate a new appearance of the Court immediately after it. Third, is a lost 1549 edition needed to explain the differences between the texts of S and F? The textual study of the Court is of intrinsic interest because the Court gives us variants in several poems known to be by Sir Thomas Wyatt, together with a number of other poems which may also be Wyatt's, some found in no other source. The textual agreements between S and F, and peculiar to them, "are numerous and striking enough to indicate a reprint," Fraser says. Still, "there remain significant differences between Folger and Stark" which "cannot be construed as mere misprints or whimsical emendations. . . . Significant variations (other than obvious misprints) of Folger from Stark occur thirteen times" (p. 40). In some cases these variations represent an improvement on S, for which Fraser accounts by supposing that S was collated with a manuscript having separate authority. He argues (p. 44), with justification I think, that Marshe would not have troubled to do this collating or to have it done. The solution offered is that after Copland had issued S, "another printer took these poems, collated them with a copy of the Devonshire MS [Brit. Mus. Add. 17492], and issued an edition of The Court of Venus in the years between the publication of the Stark and Folger fragments. When Thomas Marshe came to publish Folger in the sixties, he simply reprinted the last edition of the Court that had appeared" (p. 46). The Devonshire MS. (D) is specified because Fraser has been able to eliminate all other known manuscripts of Wyatt's poems. By "a copy of the Devonshire MS" he means a copy already containing some textual variations and some additional poems not in D. He supports this conjecture by two arguments: (a) from a correspondence between the selection of Wyatt's poems in F and those in D, and (b) from a correspondence between the texts of the poems. (a) Of twelve lyric poems in the seven extant leaves that follow the title page in F (numbered "Fol. 2" through "fol. 8."), five are in D also or are related to poems in D. The first is unknown in any manuscript except D. The poems in F are: 5 103 "My penne take payne" — S (defective), D. 66 "My lute awake" — S (defective and incomplete), D, Bl, E, T. 224 "To whom should I sue." 177 "Dysdaine me not" — M (with major variants), T. —— "Fortune what ayleth the" — Bl. 6 —— "I may by no meanes surmyse." 43 "If fantasy would fauour" — S (incomplete), D, E, A. 225 "During of payne" — Bl. —— "Now must I lern to faine." 226 "Loue whom you lyst" — S; cf. 151 in D, Bl. 52 "Meruaile no more" — D, E. T. 227 "Shal she neuer out of my mynd" (incomplete) — S, M (with an extra stanza). Four poems are common to F and D; another, No. 226, has an analogue in D. However, all but one of these are in S as well. No. 52, then, is the only selection whose presence in F seems to require further collation with a D derivative after S was printed. (No. 52 appears in E and T also, but the F version is closest to that in D.) But when we remember the paucity of remains of S ("Fo. 44" and one other), coupled with the fact that every poem in S is reprinted in F, we realize how little the omission of No. 52 from the S fragment is capable of supporting any conjecture that would necessitate extra documents. It is just possible that if we had Copland's edition in its entirety, we would have every poem reprinted by Marshe. We must consider, however, the claim on the title page of F: "Newly and diligently corrected with many proper Ballades newly amended, and also added thervnto which haue not before bene imprinted." We have noted Fraser's suggestion (p. 44) that "Marshe is probably only puffing his edition, or literally copying the title of the preceding edition, which may have been advertised in the same way." Either explanation would seem to point to the intervention of new manuscript authority after the printing of S, to account for the advertised emendations and additions. But what if Marshe, or the printer of the hypothetical lost edition, copied that title page directly from S? What if the claim on the title page of F, which seems to be Marshe's claim, was really Copland's? At this point, we must be satisfied to ask questions. We cannot prove that all of F had been in S. What we can affirm, however, is that if fresh manuscript authority introduced new poems not in S, it was not a lost manuscript derived from D. (b) Nor is such a manuscript needed to account for the F text , as a close examination of the three poems common to F, S, and D shows. In the third of these, No. 43, F has a debased text which is actually farther from D than is the S text. In No. 66 F is closer to D in one line, and in No. 103 in several lines, but all of these "restorations" can be explained as emendation, independent of any manuscript, of obvious faults in S. 7 Having disposed of the necessity for a D-based manuscript interposing between S and F, we return to the question of a lost edition during those years — an edition based on C but "newly . . . corrected . . . amended, and also added . . . vnto," and one subsequently copied by Marshe without alteration. Corrections might have been made with or without manuscript help; additions would have required a manuscript source, presumably, though not one based on D. But as we have seen, the advertisement just quoted does not itself necessitate such an edition, since it may have been S that was so advertised. However, sometime after S came out and probably before Marshe entered the picture, someone edited S carefully and changed the order of the poems. Such alterations as were made did not require manuscript help. 8 Still, the fact that S was emended suggests that the advertisement quoted refers to something that happened after S. If so, we may well ask about the additions also advertised. For them another source than S, presumably a manuscript, is required. I know of no extant source, however, with which this can be identified. 9 To summarize: a lost 1549 edition is not required by North's or Becon's reference, nor by Hall's unless we can be sure that S went generally unrecognized as part of the Court tradition; nor is it required as a textual basis for F. A lost edition by Sutton, c. 1557, is not strictly needed for Becon's reference nor for North's, though it provides a more credible gloss than does S; it is of no use at all with Hall's 1550 comment; and it is not strictly needed as a textual basis for F. The textual differences between S and F are: rearrangement of selections; perhaps the addition of new selections; and several internal changes, a few of which indicate intelligent editing, though not necessarily collation, and certainly not collation with a D derivative. It is only the pressure of our reluctance to visualize Marshe either collating S or printing from manuscript that makes us receptive to an intermediate printed version. These are the weights which we must put into the balance along with Sutton's entry in the Stationers' Register. It is not likely that everyone will agree on the specific mass of these quite unsolid probabilities and ifs. I for one am willing to say that the Stationers' Register entry of July 19, 1557, represents a real book and that we may speak with a degree of confidence of four editions issued by four different printers in four different decades and four different reigns.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II A second and more important issue may be illustrated by the following statement introduced into a college textbook in 1962: Although Wyatt intended to publish a collection of his poems, he never did so. In fact, very little of his verse was published until after his death. In aristocratic circles poems circulated in manuscript and were copied by hand; the general public usually saw courtiers' poems only when some enterprising publisher acquired manuscripts, perhaps already formed into a collection, and printed them as a miscellany. An early volume of this sort, called The Court of Venus , published a few Wyatt poems before 1540. 10 This unequivocal statement is evidently indebted to the establishment by Professor Fraser of an early date for the Bodleian fragment; previous writers had not been sure. 11 But were there really poems by Wyatt in this early Court of Venus ? The three fragments B, S, and F give us altogether fourteen lyrics, a verse prologue, and a pseudo-Chaucerian tale. The earliest, printed by Gybson, has one complete lyric, "Dryuen by dissyr," which Professor Muir prints among Wyatt's "Doubtful Poems" (No. 228), and the closing ten lines of another. In the two leaves of S, printed by Copland, are five poems (two of them truncated) including Nos. 43, 66, 103, and ("doubtful") 226. Marshe's edition, F, gives us all five of the poems from S and seven more, two of which are known as Wyatt's (Nos. 52 and 177). "My own conclusion is necessarily conservative," says Fraser. "Five of the poems in the fragments are definitely Wyatt's [i.e. Nos. 43, 52, 66, 103, 177], three more are probably his [No. 226 and the two in B], and seven are of uncertain authorship. Of these seven, some or all may have been written by Wyatt too" (pp. 34-35). We must read "six" for "seven" to get the correct total of fourteen lyrics; these six then would be Nos. 224, 225, 227, "Fortune what ayleth the," "I may by no meanes surmyse," and "Now must I lern to faine." We are offered the suggestion that "the short-poem section of The Court of Venus editions may in fact have been devoted exclusively to Wyatt's poetry" (p. 34). The table of F's contents given above will supply fuller details on the relation of F and S. Neither of the two lyrics in B reappears in S or F. But the fragmentary character of all three extant editions permits us to wonder what else they contained. To put the question in its extremest form: Was the entire Court — a name we apply to Fraser's composite edition — originally in each of the three? This question can be promptly answered in the negative. As we have noted, at least one later edition claims to be considerably augmented. The statement that B, which was printed before 1540, contained work by Wyatt is true if either of the following is true: (a) that S is textually dependent on B for the Wyatt poems; (b) that Wyatt wrote "Dryuen by dissyr" and/or the other lyric, whose last ten lines are in B. The first proposition rests entirely on circumstantial evidence. There is nothing at all common today between the fragments B and S. However, S has a great deal in common with F, which in turn has the same title as B and contains a "Prologue" which we have reason to suppose was also in B. 12 Noting that some of the printing types used by Gybson were later used by William Copland (pp. 5-6, 43), Fraser says, "I believe that Copland's source for the Stark poems was Gybson's book. Copland may have acquired this book fortuitously, or it may have come to him through Gybson himself" (p. 44). It must be said that the circumstantial evidence is fairly good. The Bodleian fragment begins with sig. E1. If all of sheets A-D were devoted to the Court lyrics, there were a good many poems, some of which may have survived in S. Still that leaves us a long way from any positive assurance that the Wyatt lyrics in S came from B. Sometime after B a printer of the Court began to advertise "many proper Ballades . . . added . . . which have not before bene imprinted." To find this notice we must now look in F, but perhaps the lost title page of S had it too. Copland obviously wanted to emphasize the newness of his edition: the distinctive running title A Boke of Balettes is proof of that. The best explanation is that S did in fact contain a good deal of new material, some of which, perhaps, was poetry by Wyatt that became available in the years following his death in 1542. Until a complete copy of B is discovered we cannot conclusively disprove, but it is certainly going too far to affirm positively, that poems by Wyatt were in print before 1540. To identify the author of the lyrics in B, arguments are presented based on similarities of style and on other sorts of evidence. The former, it seems to me, are valid only to corroborate an attribution for which the other evidence is also pretty strong. The attempts to identify the author of the first poem in B — a headless relic of which only ten lines remain — illustrate the inadequacy of stylistic evidence by itself. Fraser's statement that this poem is "probably" Wyatt's is based on two premises: "If Stark was a reprint of Douce, this poem was probably included in Copland's book of 1547-1549. If, further, one agrees with Mrs. Stopes . . . that the poems in Douce, on internal evidence, are probably the work of Sir Thomas Wyatt . . ." (p. 34). For the other poem in B a stronger case is offered, based on its supposed similarity to a poem in the Devonshire MS., fol. 81 v , in the midst of a section of "nearly 70 poems by Wyatt, copied neatly in one hand." 13 The version in D, a single rime royal stanza, follows: Dryven bye desire I dede this dede to daunger my self w i t h out cause whye to truste the vntrue not like to spede to speke. and p ro mise faithefullie but now the proof dothe verifie that who so trustithe or he kno. Dothe hurte himself and please his ffoo. 14 Here is the version in The Court of Venus : Dryuen by dissyr to set affection. a great way alas aboue my degre chosen I am I thinke by election. to couet that thing that will not be. I serue in loue not lyke to sped. I loke alas alytell to hye. agaynst my will I do in ded. couet that thing that will not be. My fanzy alas doth me so bynd that I can se no remedy but styll to folow my folych mind. and couet that thing that wyll not be. I hopyd well whan I began and sens the proue is contrary. why shold I any longer than. couet that thing that wyll not be. But rather to leaue now at the last. then styll to folowe fanzy. content with the payn that is past and not couet that thing that will not be. 15 Besides a reference to "the proof," the phrases "driven by desire" and "not like to speed" are all that these two versions have in common. If the second is Wyatt's "reworking" (p. 33) of the first, he effected a rather complete transformation. These two phrases may well have belonged to the stockpile of poetic clichés which enriched, or at least obliged, many a court poet. The presence in the Blage MS. of another poem beginning "Dryuyn to Desyre" 16 suggests that this is the case; further testimony to the existence of standardized and interchangeable parts is borne by a hitherto unnoticed parallel between two Court poems: "My fanzy alas doth me so bynd" (line 9 of the poem just quoted), "Alas her ioy doth [me] so bind" (line 3 of No. 227, F version). On an accumulation of many similar parallels current scholarship is erecting a new understanding of the methods of composition in the early Tudor court and even of the term "authorship" when applied to poems like these. In fact, it is questioned whether Wyatt was, in the modern sense, "author" of all the poems in the Egerton MS. which bear his name. 17 Surely there is little in the parallels cited to support the attribution to Wyatt of the poem in B. There is another line of argument, however. When the poet writes ". . . to set affection./a great way alas aboue my degre" and "I loke alas alytell to hye," may it not be Wyatt referring to his quest of Anne Boleyn? Apart from the difficulties of being certain about either (a) the seriousness with which the poet intends this as an autobiographical allusion, (b) the social significance, as opposed to mere poetic diction, of "degre" and "hye," or (c) the facts of that episode in Wyatt's life, this might be a convincing argument; but those who advance it are curiously in disagreement. Professor Fraser says, "At the time of Anne's downfall in 1536, Wyatt perhaps attempted to efface his suddenly dangerous expressions from the poem" as it stood in the Devonshire MS., and B was the result (p. 43). This fits the chronology of D and B, but it turns our attention away from the very phrases in B that seemed so pointed. Mrs. Stopes, on the other hand, taking the B version to contain direct allusions which the politic Wyatt excised from the poem as it appears in D, reverses the chronological order. 18 The safest conclusion, I believe, is that Nos. 159 and 228 are two different poems and we have no way of knowing who wrote the latter. 19 To summarize: While it cannot be proved that there were no poems by Wyatt in print before 1540, the latest edition of The Court of Venus does not justify the opposite claim. The Wyatt poems in S were in print by 1547-1549, the earliest date of which we can be certain. The statement that "Wyatt intended to publish a collection of his poems" 20 reflects an old conjecture 21 which may or may not be true: the evidence simply is not enough to constitute proof. Fraser offers his study as a contribution toward settling this question: "Since the Douce fragment was printed in the lifetime of Sir Thomas Wyatt, we must consider the possibility of Wyatt's having sanctioned the publication and even having supervised it himself" (p. 74). But he offers little real justification for being any more dogmatic about the matter than we were inclined to be previously.</field>

For convenience' sake I shall so refer to the poems throughout the rest of this article, and to the book as Muir, Wyatt . N.B. Numbers above 213 represent Muir's classification of "Doubtful Poems." Bl=Blage MS. (Trinity Coll. Dublin MS. D.2.7, ed. K. Muir, Sir Thomas Wyatt and his circle, Unpublished Poems Edited from the Blage Manuscript , English Reprints Ser., No. 18 [Liverpool, 1961] — hereafter referred to as Unpub. Poems ). E = Egerton MS. (Brit. Mus. MS. Eg. 2711). T = Songs and Sonnets (London: R. Tottel, 1557). M = Brit. Mus. MS. Add. 18752. A = Arundel Harington MS. (ed. Hughey). 6 Muir, Unpub. Poems , p. 90, lists this as contained in Bl but he does not print it. 7 In this collation I ignore spelling differences except where they are rhythmically significant. No. 43 is identical in S and F except for one verbal change ("The" to "That") and the omission of two words. All these variants may be ascribed to carelessness in typesetting of F; since D has the S readings, the changes certainly do not represent F's improvement on S by means of collation with a D derivative. In No. 66 F has eight variations from S, seven of which are clearly corruptions, probably compositor's errors. The eighth corrects an error in S, replacing "true" in line 23 with "Trow" and thus restoring the D reading (where E has "Thinck"). "True not alone vnder the sunne" is an obvious mistake, capable of correction without consulting a manuscript. In No. 103 there are several variants between S and F, and we shall have to examine them in detail to discern what happened. line 6 D Remember oft thow hast me eaysyd S Remembre thou hast oft ple&lt; &gt; F Remember how thou hast oft pleased Here either F restores a word dropped in S, by reference to a manuscript text or, equally well, by conjecture; or S, in not having "how," is actually closer to D, from which F departs. line 26 D Syns thow hast taken payn thys space S Syns thou hast taken payne this space F Seyng thou hast taken payne this space Here F is clearly farther from D than is S. line 30 D my pen I p ri the wryght no more S &lt; &gt;y the write no more F My pen I pray the to wryt no more. Again, by a probable compositorial error, F is farther from D. The same may be said of line 10: D &amp; yet my pen thow canst no more S And yet my pen thou canst&lt; &gt; more. F And yet my pen thou canst do no more. Although Fraser supplies "do no" from F to fill the gap caused by the deterioration of S, it is apparent from the photograph he supplies (Plate [III]) that there is room for only one word in S. line 3 D &amp; hathe in hold [sic] my hart so sore S And hold my harte so&lt; &gt; F and hath in hold, my hart so sore F corrects a slip in S and in so doing restores the D reading. This may have been done by collation with a manuscript, but more likely is based on line 28 of the same poem. line 7 D &amp; all my payne full well apeaysyd S And my sorowes also eased F And al my sorowes also eased Since F's line is so far, generally, from D's, the restoration of "al" is better attributed to a simple metrical "improvement" than to collation. line 25 D alas my pen now wryght no more S Alak my pen now wryte no more F Alas my pen now wryte no more. Collation of S with a manuscript seems a laborious way to effect this little change. line 27 D to folow that whych dothe me chace S To folow that which doth the chase F To folow that whych doth me chase A careful editor would have seen that S was corrupt and guessed at "me." line 14 D syns we do lose that other save S Sens we do lose let other sau&lt; &gt; F &lt;Seyng&gt; we doe lose and other saue All three versions differ. I have no explanation, but it is not relevant to our present concern. (The first word in F is partially trimmed away, but there is enough left to justify the reading I have given.) S omits line 20 entirely, and to show the relationship between the three versions I must give the whole stanza: lines 16-20 D yn worthe to vse another waye not as we would but as we maye for ons my losse ys past Restore &amp; my desyre ys my desyre my pen yet wryght a lytyll more S &lt; &gt;to worke an o&lt; &gt; N&lt; &gt; For els my lif&lt; &gt; paste &lt; &gt; And my desyre is my decaye F And vse to worke another way Not as ye would but as ye may For els my lyfe is past restore and my desire is my decay and yet my pen now wryt no more. Obviously S has omitted a line and F fills the gap — perhaps by manuscript authority (not that of D, however), but just as likely by independent conjecture based on the analogy of all the other stanza endings. If the D reading is right, however, in breaking this analogy in line 20 ("wryght a lytyll more" rather than "no more"), the likelihood is all the more that the line supplied in F is a sheer guess. line 29 D Now hast thow browght my mynde to passe S ndA now thou hast this brought to passe F And now to haue brought this to passe While differing from S, F is no closer to D. I can make more sense out of the Court versions of the line, and they help to make more complete the parallel of the final stanza with the first. It is probably D itself which should be emended. 8 The preceding footnote supports this statement for Nos. 43, 66, and 103. In No. 226, F omits a word from the S text ("euen," line 4) and corrects three S misprints (lines 15-16). It is not clear why F substitutes "with" for "to" in line 8 and four times changes "ye" to "you," but from the lack of any other evidence that manuscript authority was consulted, one hesitates to call in such an explanation for any of these changes. In No. 227, seven of the fourteen lines extant in F contain variants from S. As the S text of lines 2, 4, 6, and 7 is supported by another source, M, it appears that the readings of F are in error. (As M has an entire stanza not found in S or F, it may be considered to possess separate authority and thus to provide meaningful corroboration for S. The additional stanza, She hath myne hart al other before so hath she my body she may be sure nothyng on erth may glad me more the n to spende the m both to do her plesure, follows line 4.) On the other hand, when F replaces "to" with "do" in line 11 it is an obvious correction. Only lines 3 and 10 give us real difficulty. 3 S Alas her loue doth me so blinde F Alas her ioy doth so bind M Alas here yee doth me so bynde 10 S And if I do not I shall not spede F And if I dare not, I shal not spede M [line 14] yf I speke not I shuld not spede The reading of F is not palpably inferior to that of S: on line 10, some may prefer it. Still, as F is obviously corrupt elsewhere it would be reasonable to ascribe these differences to the same cause, were it not that F agrees with the word "bynde" in M. This is the nearest we get to an emendation requiring the introduction of fresh textual authority after S. It is not, in my judgment, near enough. I thank T. S. Pattie, Assistant Keeper of Manuscripts, British Museum, for verifying my notes on M; and the staffs of the Folger Shakespeare Library and the British Museum for the courtesy of access to F and D, respectively. 9 It may be suggested that since No. 225 and "Fortune what ayleth the," in F but not in S, are also found in the Blage MS. (Muir, Unpub. Poems , pp. 87, 90), this MS. entered the Court tradition sometime after S. But No. 66 is also in Bl, and where S and F differ from all other texts they agree with Bl (e.g. line 18). It would thus appear that Bl, or a related manuscript, entered the Court tradition before S; and No. 225 and "Fortune what ayleth the" could have entered then as well, if we grant that they might have been among the pages now missing from S. 10 Smith, loc. cit. (note 1). Cf. Kenneth Muir, Life and Letters of Sir Thomas Wyatt (Liverpool, 1963), p. 220: "A number of his lyrics, it is true, had appeared in his lifetime without his name in The Court of Venus ." Muir's book reached me only after the completion of this article. 11 Cf. C. C. Stopes, Shakespeare's Industry (1916), pp. 314-315, 320-321; E. K. Chambers, Sir Thomas Wyatt and Some Collected Studies (1933), p. 208. J. W. Hebel and H. H. Hudson, Poetry of the English Renaissance (1929), p. 913, come closest to such a statement but remain less definite; and in the 1953 revision ( Tudor Poetry and Prose , pp. 1187, 1193) the point is silently dropped. 12 The prologue begins: "In the moneth of may when the new tender grene/Hath smothly couered the ground. . . ." In a notice in 1548 that probably refers to Gybson's edition, John Bale cites De curia Veneris with this opening: "In maio cum virescerent" (Fraser, p. 12; cf. pp. 22, 31). Leaves now missing from B must have contained the same prologue now extant in F only. 13 Kenneth Muir, "Unpublished Poems in the Devonshire MS," Proc. of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Soc. (Lit. and Hist. Sec.), VI, iv (1947), 282. 14 The poem is No. 159 in Muir, Wyatt . The same version appears in Tottel's Miscellany (ed. H. Rollins [Cambridge, Mass., 1928-1929], I, 82) and in the Blage MS., fol. 87. Muir, Unpub. Poems , p. 16, prints it as the first stanza of a longer poem and comments (p. xiv) that the entire poem "is certainly Wyatt's . . . because the first stanza appears in D . . . in the group of poems generally accepted as his." Mrs. Annabel Endicott, of the University of Toronto, who read an early draft of this article and made several helpful suggestions, called to my attention that the other three stanzas of this "poem" in Bl are of eight lines, riming ababbaba, and have not even the same theme as No. 159. Clearly it was a mistake to attach them to the D poem — a mistake made by the copyist who wrote fol. 87 in Bl and uncorrected till now. 15 Fraser, pp. 81-82. 16 Muir, Unpub. Poems , p. 17. 17 See H.

      <field name="heading_text">The Printing of Greenes Groatsworth of Witte and Kind-Harts Dreame by Sidney Thomas</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is hardly necessary to emphasize the supreme importance of Greenes Groatsworth of Witte and Kind-Harts Dreame for Elizabethan literary history, and especially for the biography of Shakespeare. It is all the more surprising, therefore, that some interesting and puzzling bibliographical features of the two books should have escaped notice heretofore. As is well known, the two works are intimately connected. Both were published by William Wright with no printers' names given, the first (entered 20 September 1592) in 1592, and the second (entered 8 December 1592) without date, but presumably early in 1593. More important, the author of Kind-Harts Dreame , Henry Chettle, was also, by his own admission, the editor of Greenes Groatsworth of Witte ; and the most famous section of the Chettle work is his commentary upon the notorious attack on Shakespeare and other playwrights made, ostensibly by Greene, in the earlier book. Even a superficial examination of the two books indicates that, for each, the copy was divided in approximately equal sections between two printers. In Greenes Groatsworth of Witte , the two sections comprise signatures A1-C4 and D1-F4. D1 r begins a new sequence of the book, "Robertoes Tale"; from this point on, a new type font is used; and a new form of running-title, "Greenes groatsworth of wit", takes the place of the earlier "Greenes groats vvorth of vvit," or "Greenes groats-vvorth of vvit". Exactly the same features are found in Kind-Harts Dreame , in which the two sections comprise signatures A1-D4, and E1-H2. E1 r begins a new sequence, "Robert Greene to Pierce Pennilesse"; again, a different type font is used for the latter part of the book; and again, the running-title differs, being consistently given in E1-H2 as "Kindharts Dreame", rather than the "Kind-harts Dreame", or "Kind-hartes Dreame" of A1-D4. Further study of the two books makes it clear that what we have, for each, is not a manuscript divided between two compositors working in the same printing house, but rather a manuscript divided between two different printers; and the evidence further enables us to identify the two printers who collaborated on both books as John Wolfe and John Danter. If we look first at Kind-Harts Dreame , we find that the title-page device (McKerrow, 226) is unquestionably Wolfe's, and was used by him, for example, in Harvey's Foure Letters (S.T.C. 12900) of 1592. Furthermore, the black-letter type font of A3-D4 is the same as that of Greene's Quip for an Upstart Courtier , printed by Wolfe in 1592. The ornament used on A3 r and C1 r is identical with that on A2 r of The chief occurrences of both the armies (S.T.C. 11260), printed by Wolfe in 1592; on A2 r of An excellent discourse upon the now present estate of France (S.T.C. 14005), printed by Wolfe in 1592; and on A3 r of The survay or topographical description of France (S.T.C. 7575), printed by Wolfe in 1592. Finally, the initial letter A on C1 r is similar to the Wolfe initial identified by Hoppe as No. 20. 1 The evidence for Danter as printer of E1-H2 of Kind-Harts Dreame is equally strong. The ornament on E2 v , with the inserted initials "ID" is certainly Danter's and is found again and again in his books. To give only two examples, it serves as the title page device of the 1594 Orlando Furioso ("Printed by Iohn Danter for Cuthbert Burbie"), and is used on A3 r of Henry Smith's God's arrowe against atheists (S.T.C. 22666), printed by Danter in 1593. This in itself is conclusive; but in addition, the factotum on E1 r is identical with that on C1 r of Nashe's Strange Newes (S.T.C. 18377c) printed by Danter in 1593; and on A3 r , B1 r , and K3 r of Smith's God's arrowe . Turning to Greenes Groatsworth of Witte , we find that the title-page device of a mask is the same as that used as a colophon on D3 r of A fig for the Spaniard (S.T.C. 1026), printed by Wolfe in 1591. The ornament on B1 r is identical with that on B1 r of Kind-Harts Dreame ; and the capital G on A3 v is identical with that on B1 r of Kind-Harts Dreame . The identity of Danter as the printer of the second part of Greenes Groatsworth of Witte is established by the factotum on D1 r , which is identical with that on C5 r of Henry Smith's Jurisprudentiae, medicinae et theologicae dialogus dulcis (S.T.C. 22678), 2 printed by Danter in 1592; and on C1 r , E2 r , and I1 r of Smith's God's arrowe . 3 Whatever questions it may raise, the evidence presented here does help to solve one minor puzzle of Elizabethan printing history. The controversy between Chettle and Danter which was referred to Thomas Dason and Thomas Orwin for hearing and determination on March 5, 1592/3, 4 has up to now eluded explanation. There can be little doubt that this dispute arose out of the printing of Greenes Groatsworth of Witte , or Kind-Harts Dreame , or both; though one can only guess at the specific cause of the dispute. Finally, we can now transform into a certainty what Jenkins refers to as "a not unnatural assumption that . . . Chettle had subsequently [after 1591] resumed his association with Danter." 5</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Reappearing Types as Bibliographical Evidence * by Robert K. Turner, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To illustrate the principle that one must have a rather good idea of what he is looking for before he can see it, Darwin told this anecdote: While he was still a student, he and a companion carefully explored a Welsh valley for fossil remains. Intent on their search, they did not notice that all about them were scored rocks, perched boulders, and moraines, all such plain indications of glaciation that had the valley been filled by a glacier at the time the signs could not have been more conspicuous. But Agassiz had not as yet announced his theory of a glacial period in the earth's history, and such matters were far from the minds of the two fossil-hunters. They no doubt found some fossils, but they passed by evidence for one of the great scientific discoveries of the nineteenth century because they were intent on other things. Perhaps Darwin's story, with its implications that hypothesis is essential to observation, is known to bibliographers as well as to scientists. If not, it ought to be, for boulders and books are alike in that both exhibit phenomena that can be seen without being observed, that are meaningless, or virtually so, until we have a context in which they are meaningful. An instance is the reappearance within early printed books of recognizable rules, ornaments, and individual pieces of type. This phenomenon must have been seen quite often by bibliographers; McKerrow, for example, speaks of the reappearance of certain initials within the gatherings of a Bible printed by Barker in 1591 as proving the book to have been composed by formes. 1 But McKerrow thought that such reappearances could occur only in page-for-page reprints, as he evidently did not realize to what extent manuscript as well as printed matter could be cast off for setting by formes. From McKerrow's day until recently we have seen the use of evidence from recurring rules, ornaments, and types, but chiefly in connection with such matters as studies of skeleton formes, the identification of printers, or the determination of resetting. It was not, I think, until we learned something of the methods Professor Hinman had adopted for the examination of the Folger Folios and the results he was obtaining that bibliographers began to search for the reappearances within single books of type matter not a part of the skeleton formes and to use such reappearances as evidence in rigorous bibliographical analysis. Although not as prominent as Darwin's moraines, this evidence can be obvious enough, and one of the many contributions of The Printing and Proof-Reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare is that it demonstrates both its meaning and its value so decisively. When the influence of this book is fully felt, we will probably see a much more extensive use of evidence from recurring type matter, for from it, in conjunction with more conventional evidence, one can precisely reconstruct, as Hinman has shown, many details of printing-house procedure that affected the transmission of texts and that on other evidence would remain obscure. Some of these details, ones of great concern to Hinman, are the identity of compositors, the extent of their work, and the order of composition and printing of various parts of books. To supplement what we now know about this new kind of evidence from the study of the Shakespeare Folio, I wish to discuss three instances of its usefulness in other and somewhat different situations. Let me first describe briefly the first quarto of Albumazar , an academic play by Thomas Tomkis, which was printed in 1615 by Nicholas Okes. The book collates A 2 B-L 4 ; the text begins on B1 and ends on L3 v , a short epilogue being printed on L4 and L4 v being blank. One gets the impression that Okes strove in this book for an appearance of higher quality than that of most 17th-century play quartos: an almost prodigal amount of white space was left around the scene heads, of which there are many; and nearly every scene begins with a two- or three-line initial, three of the acts with four-line initials, and the first act with a handsome decorative block. Speech prefixes were set in roman caps and small caps flush with the left margin, except on B1 where a couple were indented. Stage directions were generally set in the caps and small caps of a roman font slightly larger than that employed for the speech prefixes. On each full page there are thirty-seven lines of type or the equivalent, three leaves in each gathering are signed, and what small variation there is in speech-prefix abbreviation appears to be random. Throughout there is substitution of roman for certain italic letters that were in short supply. The book as a whole has a typographical consistency which suggests that it was set up by one compositor. When spellings are examined, this impression, although perhaps not confirmed, is not altogether destroyed. Chart I shows the incidence of six variant spelling forms, those which appear to be significant. (For the moment please disregard the lines of the chart labelled "A types" and "B types.") The A and B spellings do tend to cluster in various parts of the book, but there are conflicts which undercut an assumption that two compositors were at work — the occurrence on B3 of the B-form wee'le amidst A-forms, the occurrence on C3 v of the A-form wee'l and the B-form maister , the occurrence on H2 of both A-forms and B-forms, and so on. Furthermore, the whole pattern is rather thin: there are a number of pages on which no significant spellings are found. I had some doubts about the matter, but in a study of this play made several years ago I spoke of the book as set up by one compositor, having decided, unwisely as it turns out, that the evidence was not strong enough to support a declaration for two. 2 Please turn now to Charts IIa and IIb, which show the incidence throughout Albumazar Q1 of certain recognizable types. The numbers in the body of the chart are line numbers; thus one may see in Chart IIb that the "e" which is found in line 2 of B2 v reappears in line 27 of D2, line 28 of E4, and so on. None of the types listed falls on any page not represented in the charts. Because the identifications were made from photostats, I should not want to trust them implicitly, but I think they are accurate enough for our present purposes. The point to be noticed is that the A-types and the B-types very definitely cluster in certain runs of pages: types found from D3 through E2 v recur from F3 through G2 v , from H3 through I2 v , and from K3 through L2 v ; similarly, types found from C3 through D2 v recur from E3 through F2 v and so on. And when this information is taken together with the spelling evidence, that begins to make better sense. Looking again at Chart I (especially now the lines labelled "A types" and "B types"), we see that if we disregard Compositor A's use of wee'l (this spelling having been used by B in addition to wee'le ) and Compositor A's use of sweet (this spelling too having been used by B in addition to sweete ) we get perfect correlation except at B3. Thus we are able to assign the various parts of the book to their compositors with much greater confidence than we could on spelling evidence alone. If, as with Albumazar Q1, we use types to differentiate between the work of two or more compositors, we should be aware of our assumption that the types set by each workman were distributed only into his type cases. I think in the instance of Albumazar Q1, because of the correlation of the typographical and spelling evidence, this assumption is in general justified. But it is not true of all the types in the book: the italic act head on B1, A's page, reappears with numerals changed on C4 v , E4 v , G4, and K1 v , all B's pages; and I think the apparent conflict of spelling and typographical evidence on B3 can be explained on the supposition that all of Sheet B was set by Compositor A but that B2 v and B3 were distributed into B's cases — that is, that the B types were not actually in use by Compositor B until he began work at C3. In one book with which I am familiar the types were not regularly returned to the cases from which they originated, but even in it typographical evidence can be of use in compositor determination. Let us consider three quires in the second section of the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647, a folio in fours. The second section was printed by William Wilson, 3 and the quires in question — 2K, 2L, and 2M — contain the final page of The Captain , on which the prologue and epilogue are printed in italics (2K1), a blank (2K1 v ), and the complete text of Beggars' Bush (beginning on 2K2 and ending on 2M4 v , a page containing only twenty-seven lines in each of the two columns of text). The pages which these quires comprise contain variant spellings suggesting that they were set by two compositors, but the assignment of some segments of the text to their proper compositor is difficult because of the paucity of significant spellings. However, by tracing type recurrences according to Hinman's method, it is possible to link parts of the text which lack significant spellings with those which do contain them and thus to make assignments on the assumption that two segments of text set from the same case would have been set by the same workman. Although this assumption cannot always be made, as one compositor could relieve another during the course of the work, it is probably safe if, after careful examination, one can detect no important discrepancies in spelling or details of typography between the two segments under scrutiny. Charts IIIa and IIIb summarize the evidence relating to the three quires. The information given here is based on a preliminary survey and is probably incomplete; moreover, for the sake of clarity, I have suppressed not only the number of types being represented but also some conflicts in the evidence which I think are minor or capable of an explanation too involved to be presented here. I am concerned only to illustrate a principle, and the information given is, I believe, accurate enough for that purpose. On the charts themselves the horizontal headings represent parts of the text, usually columns, such as 2K3a and 2K3b, but entire pages in the case of 2K1 and 2M4 v , which contain little text. The order in which these headings appear, incidentally, is the probable order of composition as suggested by evidence relating to the order of the formes through the press. Among the spellings indicated, "wee'l, etc." and "wee'll, etc." include other related variants such as shee'l/shee'll or shee'le and hee'l/hee'll or hee'le ; "2 noun" and "2. noun" refer to any numeral in a speech prefix or stage direction followed by any noun (e.g., 3. Merchant ), the presence of the point being the crucial matter; and "Florez/Floriz" and "Hemskirk(e) /Hemskirck" refer to characters' names. The notations for "Floriz" include a couple of occurrences of Floris and those for" Hemskirck," of Hemskirick . The rubric "odd s.d." among Compositor B's characteristics is used to designate stage directions whose internal elements are separated by periods rather than the more usual commas. Because both compositors spelled heart, hart only is included among B's characteristics. In the parts of the charts labelled "Type from" we find the source of the recognizable types which reappear in the designated parts of each quire. Thus in Chart IIIa one or more types from 2I2 v a are found in 2K3a, 2K3 v b, and 2K4a. In this section of the book the column seems always to have been the unit of distribution (omitting from account a few aberrant types which are not represented). This point is important, for if parts of columns had been distributed into A's cases and parts into B's, a summary of the kind we are now examining would convey quite the wrong impression. In contrast with the practice of the compositors of Albumazar Q1, Wilson's workmen did not always maintain control of the same types. We see that although Compositor A set 2L2 v a, this column was distributed into B's case and that although Compositor B set 2L4a, this column was distributed into A's case. This feature of the compositors' work, illustrated in small here, is more prominent in other quires of this section of the Folio. It restricts the validity of the typographical evidence for compositor determination, but, as we see, does not render it useless, for one can still reason as follows: that as 2I2 v a types reappear in 2K3a, 2K3 v b, and 2K4a, these columns were set from the same case, the one into which 2I2 v a was distributed; that as his spelling characteristics occur in 2K3a and 2K3 v b, Compositor A was using that case; hence, that 2K4a, in which spelling evidence is lacking, was also set by Compositor A, evidence to the contrary being absent. We see how the columns in each compositor's stint are linked to one another by the reappearing types and how these correlate with the spelling evidence in a way which permits assignment of columns in which the spelling evidence is weak or non-existent. Thus we understand that the types used in the texts of early books can sometimes repay close scrutiny because, among other things, they may help in compositor determination, but the types of the text are not all we have to work with. Some books, like the Shakespeare and Beaumont and Fletcher Folios, have on each page such typographical appurtenances as box and center rules which, as Schroeder and Hinman have shown, 4 can be put to good bibliographical use, and even lowly quartos ordinarily have running titles, which, as Professor Bowers has often reminded us, can be tracked through the book and made to tell some of the secrets of the printing. But even running titles, with which many of us are used to working, cannot be taken for granted, as the following example is meant to show. Beaumont and Fletcher's Maid's Tragedy first appeared in a quarto of 1619, which collates A 2 B-L 4 . The text, as Greg noted, was printed in two sections, B-G and H-L, the first, and the one with which we are now concerned, being the work of Nicholas Okes. 5 The running titles in this section (and indeed the second also) were set in rather large italic type and read The Maydes Tragedy. , on both recto and verso. A glance reveals that the sheets were machined in two skeleton formes which alternately imposed the inner and outer formes of succeeding sheets, and the same glance suggests that there is no very great problem about the identification of the running titles. Chart IV shows the eight titles included in the two skeletons as they appear in Sheets C and D. 6 In RT I on C1 and D2 we see an initial T with a broken right arm, d 's that bend back at the same angle, and second T 's that look much alike. Of course, there are some differences too: the arms of the initial T 's do not form precisely the same angles with the stems and the serif on the left foot of the M has picked up a nick, but nothing is consistent in early printing and the small imperfection on the shoulder that takes ink over the period seems to make the identification conclusive. In the two appearances of RT II we may note the similarity of the M 's the y 's, and the d 's but may dismiss the dissimilarities of the T 's as accidental; in the two appearances of RT III we may note the similarity of the y 's and the g 's, and remark in passing that the initial T looks as though it was reset. And so for the rest of the running titles, not only between Sheets C and D but throughout Okes's section of the book: we may notice some points of likeness between titles, on the strength of these identify them as the same, and conclude that the transfer of the skeletons from forme to forme was quite regular. Of course, as you have doubtless noticed, that is not exactly so. There seem to have been, it is true, lower-case types in sufficient numbers to set the lower-case letters of all eight running titles, but, if my identifications are right, there were only five M 's and ten T 's available. Eight complete titles required eight M 's and sixteen T 's. The compositor was therefore obliged to shift some capitals from the running titles of each forme which was returned from the press to the next subsequent forme which was being imposed. In Chart IV partial results of this can be seen, for, to follow only one group of capitals for a short way, the capitals in RT VI at C2 (slightly trimmed in the copy used) move from there to identical positions in RT I at C1; from there the initial T and the M move to identical positions in RT VII at D4 v and the second T becomes the second T in RT V at D2 v . The progression of the various capitals through Okes's section of the book can be seen in Chart V, where I have identified each set of lower case types, each M , and each T by arbitrary numbers. A typical instance of the compositor's way of coping with the shortage may be seen if we look at the columns headed "C(i)" and "C(o)". Evidently before C(i) was returned from the press, the workman set into position for C(o) the four groups of lower case letters which previously had been used in B(i), LC 6, LC 5, LC 8, and LC 7, and he also used the three capitals which were then free, M 1, T 8, and T 7. All the rest of the capitals had to be obtained from C(i); T 9, for example, was taken from C1 v to finish the C4 v running title, three capitals were transferred from C2 to C1, and so on. Generally, this procedure was followed throughout the section. What I am chiefly interested in showing here is that the types can be traced with some precision if one looks for them and that the information thus gathered is more than a mere curiosity, for it furnishes evidence of the order of the imposition of the formes. On three occasions capitals were moved from one page into precisely the same relative position in another page. The first two of these occasions, the transfers between C2 and C1 and D3 and D1 v tell us little because either the inner or the outer forms of either sheet could have preceded the other forme of that sheet, but the reappearance of the E3 capitals in identical positions in F4 v almost certainly means the precedence of F(o) over F(i) and this taken together with the alternation of the lower case groups indicates the order of formes shown on Chart V. These three examples show how evidence from types may facilitate compositor determination and reveal other matters of more than cursory interest. Such advantages can often justify the patience and eyestrain necessary to identify and trace the types, but, in addition, on their testimony, inference about the relationship between composition and presswork, a matter not considered here, frequently becomes possible. Some precautions which should be observed have been mentioned, and we shall doubtless learn of others as more experience in the use of this kind of evidence is gained. It seems clear to me, however, that bibliographers and textual critics who want to know how their books were printed will have to search out broken types as one of the quite routine procedures of bibliographical investigation.

      <field name="heading_text">Wither and the Stationers by Norman E. Carlson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In "George Wither's Quarrel with the Stationers: An Anonymous Reply to The Schollers Purgatory ," 1 Allan Pritchard has added a document both entertaining and enlightening to the materials which are available and relevant to Wither's life and work. He has, however, not gone far enough in correcting one of the traditional misconceptions in Wither biography, the notion that The Schollers Purgatory is the final statement of a bitter loser in a struggle against the impregnable fortress of the all-powerful Stationers. Detailed consideration of documents which Pritchard surveys outlines a sketch of a Wither in action more consistent with the personality that his biography reveals, and also demonstrates that it was not always as easy for the Stationers to have their way as is generally assumed. A recent example of the misconception concerning Wither's struggle with the Stationers over his patent for The Hymnes and Songs of the Church 2 appears in W. W. Greg's Some Aspects and Problems of London Publishing between 1550 and 1650 (1956). In order to qualify his use of a passage from The Schollers Purgatory , regarding the practices of the Stationers, Greg explains the composition of that work as follows: Now admittedly Wither is not an impartial witness. He was smarting under defeat by the Stationers' Company, which had successfully fought what Pollard called 'an iniquitous grant,' whereby, to an innocent patent for his Hymns and Songs of the Church was added the unreasonable proviso that it should be bound up and sold with all copies of the Psalms in Metre , the lucrative rights in which belonged to the Company by a grant of Archbishop Whitgift (p. 75). The essence of this statement, the judgment that Wither was "not an impartial witness," is a valid and necessary judgment. However, the assertion that the Stationers' Company had "successfully fought" Wither's grant, and that the poet was "smarting under defeat" at their hands does not accurately reflect the facts of the case. In 1624, the battle between Wither and the Stationers had just begun, and what Greg labels "defeat" is merely an early setback in the maneuvering for position. To be fair, it must be noted that the misconception originally derives from crediting Wither's own complaints with too much veracity at a time when various documents relating to the matter were not easily accessible. It is only since the publication of the Records of the Court of The Stationers Company, 1602 to 1640 , 3 and the more recent volumes of the Acts of the Privy Council , 4 that it has been possible to reconstruct even fragmentarily the struggle between Wither and the London Stationers. Such a reconstruction — one naturally to be attempted only by the occasional few who stir Wither's dust — indicates that in this matter, as in every other concerning himself, Wither was not "an impartial witness," that he was always purposefully exaggerating his troubles. Wither's patent, with its "unreasonable proviso," 5 was granted on February 17, 1623, the day on which Buckingham, the royal favorite, rode off incognito with Prince Charles to court the Spanish Infanta. James, a prematurely old man at fifty-six, was left despondent and vulnerable to many suitors for favor, to whom he is reported to have exclaimed: "I would God you had first my doublet and then my shirt. Were I naked, I think you would give me leave to be quiet." 6 Whether James's distraught state had anything to do with his generosity to Wither must, of course, remain a matter of speculation, but it seems not at all unlikely that the unsettled conditions worked in Wither's favor. In any case, early in 1623 Wither held a grant that promised a sizable return if its conditions were executed, for in the following ten years at least fifty-nine separate editions, or about 87,000 copies, of the Metrical Psalms were to be printed. 7 It is not hard to understand why the Stationers might object to Wither's grant. For one thing, the addition of Wither's book would increase considerably the size and cost of the Metrical Psalms ; the small octavo edition (1623) would, for example, be swollen by 112 additional leaves. The expected result would be a decrease in sales, and hence a loss of income to the company. The Stationers might also reasonably be angered by their not receiving a share of the profits from this new book. They might further fear the powers given to Wither; by virtue of his patent Wither could, taking a constable with him, search the premises of any printer or bookseller and seize copies of the Hymnes and Songs of the Church printed without his authorization or copies of the Metrical Psalms that did not have his book bound with them. Half of the seized books would become the property of the King, the other half of Wither. Finally, the Stationers resisted the recognition of an author's rights implicit in the patent, for their industry had flourished partly because of the minimal sums they had to pay for their copy. The Stationers apparently tried negotiating first; on March 10, three weeks after the grant, the Court of the Stationers' Company appointed five members "to talke with Mr. Withers about his Patent, of the hymnes of the Church" ( Records , p. 156). That failing, they petitioned James for relief in the autumn ( Records , p. 162), meanwhile openly resisting the patent by methods Wither described at great length in The Schollers Purgatory . The Stationers may also have had a hand in a petition against Wither's patent from the Bookbinders sent to Parliament in the spring of 1624 (a session in which the Commons had set about to remedy longstanding "grievances" that had in effect been tabled from earlier Parliaments in James's reign). 8 Neither petition achieved its aim, and Wither struck back at the Stationers' non-compliance by appearing before the Privy Council. His "victory" is recorded in The Acts of the Privy Council , dated July 12, 1624: Whereas George Withers, gentleman, complayned to their Lordships that the Companie of Stationers under colour of a reference procured from his Majesty about ten monethes paste have ever since opposed and hindred the execucion of a privilege which his Majesty was graciously pleased to graunt unto him by letters patent concerning a book called the Hymnes and Songs of the Church upon which complaint some of the saide Companie being comanded to attend the Boarde did this day make their apparence; upon hearing of both parties it was thought fit and ordered that the saide George Withers shall from henceforth without empeachment enjoy the benefite of the gracious favor intended towardes him by the graunt of the aforesaide privilege and that the stationers shall accordingly conforme themselves. 9 The Stationers refused to be intimidated by this order, and Wither went ahead with publication of The Schollers Purgatory denouncing them. This phase of the conflict included the raid by the Stationers on the printshop of George Wood, whom Wither had hired to print his book, and the confiscation and destruction of Wood's press, type founts, and accessories. Undaunted, Wither rescued the first two sheets of the book, already printed, had another printer do the remaining seven, and published the book ( Records , pp. 169-170). An appearance before the Commissioners for Causes Ecclesiastic vindicated his having had the book printed before securing "license" for it, and publication was allowed; 10 thus matters stood when the plague of 1625 depopulated London and turned Wither's attention to other matters. 11 The Stationers perhaps assumed (as have literary historians) that the struggle was over, 12 but they did not reckon with Wither's astounding pertinacity. In January, 1627, Wither was back before the Privy Council, securing another order supporting his patent. 13 At that point the Stationers discontinued resistance along the lines they had been following, for on February 21 the Court of the Company issued a conciliatory order: It is ordered that if mr withers will deliu' to mr weaver a certaine number of his hymnes of every volume, That mr weaver shall deliu' them out to the bookesellers who are to binde them w th the Psalmes and preferr them to Costomers and he is euery quarter to account w th mr withers and allowe him for soe many of the same as shalbe sold as shalbe agreed vpon betwixt him and the Company ( Records , p. 192). Wither had won a battle, if not the war. How earnestly the booksellers complied with the Privy Council order of February, 1627, is difficult to say. An entry in the Records of the Court of the Company for March 27, 1633, indicates at least ostensible cooperation: The now Stockeeps m r Islip and the rest are requested by the Table to treat w th m r Withers about his proporcōns [that is, his share] concerning his himnes &amp; to Certify the Table of their doeings ( Records , p. 247). But the disparity between the number of metrical psalmbooks printed and the number of copies of Hymnes and Songs of the Church suggests that compliance was nominal, although it undoubtedly varied from bookseller to bookseller, since the individual bookseller would be responsible for the binding of the books he sold. Wither was not happy with the situation, and he petitioned the Privy Council again in March, 1634. He asserted in his petition that he had expected the Stationers to conform to the previous order without further compulsion, but that "gentleness" on his part had only made them "more obstinate." He estimated that he had "by their contentions disbursed and injured himself about 1,200 l." and that he had £500 worth (perhaps 4,000-5,000 copies) of the books in his possession for three years, which he thought the Stationers could have sold in a year if they had tried to. He concluded his petition on a desperate note: . . . he being thereby destitute of means, beseeches them that their former order may be renewed, and warrants granted to bring before them such as disobey the same, that they, who enjoy all their privileges by royal prerogative, may not be suffered to resist and despise the same; otherwise the petitioner's best approved studies, and the benefit intended him will become both his disgrace and his undoing. By their assistance he shall be better enabled to glorify God and serve his Majesty in some other good employment ( SPD , 1633-1634, p. 533). Although records of the decision on the petition are not available, the final episode in the case indicates that a judgment in Wither's favor was handed down once more. That final episode is slightly comic. By 1635 Wither apparently wanted to settle down in earnest as a country squire and wash his hands of this feud with the Stationers. But since he did not want to wash his hands of any possible profit, he sold the rights to his patent for twenty-one years, along with £400 worth of books, to Robert Crosse and Toby Knowles, "two of his Majesty's messengers in ordinary" ( SPD , 1635-1636, p. 80). In 1635 these two were petitioning Sir Francis Windebank, Secretary of State, "to favour them in a question about to come up to a hearing." They needed the favor, because they were bound to pay Wither "yearly great sums of money" (SPD, 1635-1636, p. 80). The editor of the State Papers Domestic suggests that the hearing was one "respecting the right of the stationers or the patentees to bind up these hymns with Bibles," but an agreement recorded on June 11, 1635, seems to indicate that it was only a hearing between the petitioners and Wither. The agreement between Wither and Crosse stipulated that Crosse should return all the copies of Hymnes and Songs of the Church which he and his partners had not sold, and pay Wither the money they had received for the copies they had sold, "provided 57 l. be first deducted for moneys and diet formerly paid to Wither by Crosse and Toby Knowles." Wither was to deliver up the contracts between them to be cancelled ( SPD , 1635, p. 118). He was, at the end of the game, stuck with the old maid — several thousand copies of The Hymnes and Songs of the Church . The account which can at present be pieced together is hardly complete (future volumes of the Acts of the Privy Council will perhaps add something more to it) and not as coherent as one would like, but it is at least clear that Wither was not "smarting under defeat" while composing The Schollers Purgatory in 1624. Rather, he was merely engaging in one skirmish, staging a raid one can view as quite daring in light of the Stationers' established position and his own shortage of truly powerful allies. Moreover, in 1624 the Stationers had not "successfully fought" the King's grant to Wither, but had only thus far defended their entrenched position. If in the long run they frustrated Wither's hope of earning a large return for his labors in verse, it was not without concessions that must have earned greater profits than he was willing to admit over the eight years from 1627 to 1635 for the most indomitable of the English poets.</field>

Benson ( The English Hymn , John Knox Press: Richmond, Virginia, 1962, pp. 65-66), Wither's volume had "singularly little influence" on the eventual development of English hymnody in the eighteenth century. As a "fully formed hymn book for the Church of England," it appeared more than half a century before the English were willing to supplement or replace the singing of Metrical Psalms in church worship with hymns not closely translated from scripture. Although thirty-eight of Wither's hymns were metrical paraphrases of scriptures other than the Psalms, and therefore had at least a similar kind of justification, almost fifty of them were original compositions intended to be sung on particular festivals or holy days, or at times of special thanksgiving ("For seasonable weather," "For deliverance from a Publike Sicknesse"). The continuing influence of Calvin, who had rejected all hymns except those in the Scriptures, and for practical purposes all other than the Psalms, made the bulk of Wither's hymns unacceptable for worship at the time of their publication. 3 Ed.

Possibly as a result of this petition, a warrant was issued for Wither's arrest on May 15; when a friend of his put up resistance against the arresting officer, Wither protected the officer from harm instead of offering resistance himself.

The entry is undated, but obviously must have followed the seizure of Wood's press on September 9, 1624. This appearance by Wither before the Commissioners for Causes Ecclesiastic is presumably the one to which his anonymous respondent was referring when he wrote: "haue they [the Stationers] not peticōned his Matie in this cause, and hath not his Mat ie graceously referred it to most Reverend Men?" ( SB , XVI, 41). 11 Attention that was ultimately embodied in his Britain's Remembrancer (1628), and his sense of mission as England's Jeremiah. 12 Survival of the "Letter to George Wither in answere [t]o a late Pamphlet partly Imp[rin]ted by George Wood" which Pritchard presents in manuscript only suggests that the Stationers considered victory to be theirs. 13 Acts of P.C., January 1627-August 1627 , pp. 29-30.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Identification of New York Public Library Manuscript "Suckling Collection" and of Huntington Manuscript 198 by C. M. Armitage</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his recent thoroughgoing "Editorial Experiment: Suckling's 'A Sessions of the Poets'," L. A. Beaurline speculates that the New York Public Library MS "Suckling Collection" (N), which ends with a note initialled "JH," may have been transcribed by James Halliwell-Phillipps (1820-89). 1 Mr. Beaurline notes, however, that R. W. Smith, the Library's Keeper of Manuscripts, thinks that the hand is eighteenth or early nineteenth century, rather than mid-nineteenth. This opinion supports my contention that N was transcribed by Joseph Haslewood (1769-1833), sometime between 1822 (the date in the watermark of the paper) and 1833. Aside from the apparent evidence of the hand, other factors militate against identifying "JH" as James Halliwell-Phillipps. In the first place, he would probably have included the initial of each part of his surname, as is the initialling practice among persons with hyphenated surnames. Most significantly, since N is, as Mr. Beaurline has shown, "clearly a copy" of a few pages of Huntington MS 198, and since HM 198 contains half-a-dozen notes which in content and handwriting significantly resemble the one in N and which were written before 1833 by a "JH" who may reasonably be identified as Joseph Haslewood, there is little doubt that he was the transcriber of N. Haslewood once owned the two manuscript miscellanies which comprise what is now known as HM 198. From the auction of his effects they passed, via Thorpe, 2 to Edward King, Viscount Kingsborough (1795-1837), (the avid collector of MSS who bankrupted himself trying to prove in print that Mexico had been colonised by the Israelites, an attempt which finally cost him his life when he contracted typhus fever in debtor's prison in Dublin — see D.N.B. ). The notes by "JH," which comment either on the original format of the MSS or on the difference between the manuscript and the printed versions of some of the poems, are couched in a florid style which D.N.B. shows to be characteristic of Haslewood, as is the title page: "M.S.S. RECORDS OF THE MUSE, ORIGINAL AND SELECTED, Gathering felicitous Ideas and distinguished Effusions by [a list of authors] who flourished during the elden Days of Q. Elizabeth, K. James Ist and Charles Ist &amp; IInd." With the pages bearing this title and the notes interpolated, the two miscellanies were bound in separate volumes by Charles Lewis in 1832. They subsequently became part of the library of Henry Huth, for whom they were re-bound by Francis Bedford in one volume. It was drawn on by A. B. Grosart for his 1872-73 edition of Donne's poems, in which it is referred to as the "Haslewood-Kingsborough MS" or "H-K." 3 Apart from the evidence that the line of ownership offers, that H-K and HM 198 are the same MS can be seen as soon as Grosart's versions of the 24 poems which he acknowledges to be wholly or partly derived from H-K are compared with the versions in HM 198. They regularly correspond, for example in such revealing matters as Grosart's having ceased to follow H-K after 56 lines of the 76-line poem "Come Fates I feare you not" — which in HM 198 contains just 56 lines; and in his noting that the name "John Done" is appended to the poem "True love finds witt" on page 165 of H-K — which is exactly where that name, spelt thus, appears in HM 198.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Two Scenes by Addison in Steele's Tender Husband by Shirley Strum Kenny</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By late March or early April, 1705, 1 Captain Richard Steele, well-known for his sober treatise The Christian Hero and two comedies, The Funeral and The Lying Lover , finished his third play, The City Nymph; or, The Accomplish'd Fools . It opened at the Drury Lane on 23 April 1705 with a new title, The Tender Husband; or, The Accomplish'd Fools , and it was published 9 May. On 6 December 1712, in the Spectator , No. 555, Steele, now a powerful literary figure, wrote: When the Play above-mentioned [ The Tender Husband ] was last Acted, there were so many applauded Stroaks in it which I had from the same Hand [Joseph Addison's], that I thought very meanly of my self that I had never publickly acknowledged them. Since Steele's acknowledgement of his debt to Addison, the first instance of collaboration in the most famous of English literary partnerships, critics have not ceased to speculate about which strokes may be attributed to Addison. Thomas Tickell, in the Preface to Addison's Works in 1721, enlarged upon Steele's statement, asserting that Steele "owed some of the most taking scenes of it to Mr. Addison ." Later critics have varied their estimates from "a number of corrections and suggestions" 2 to entire subplots, basing their conclusions usually on style, characterization, parallels to other works of Addison, or on their own literary prejudices and preferences. Despite the amount of speculation on the subject, no one has ever attempted to distinguish Addison's work from Steele's through bibliographical techniques. An examination of the physical evidence of the first edition, however, gives strong cause for assigning parts of Act III, Scene i, and Act V, Scene i, to Addison. This paper will attempt to prove that these two sections of the play are his, indicate the exact extent of his work in each scene, show that his additions were written very shortly before the play opened, and give reasons for believing other specific scenes of the play to be Steele's. Briefly stated, evidence for believing III.i and V.i are Addison's includes (1) compositorial variations in speech prefixes, derived from the underlying manuscripts; (2) discrepancies in details, resulting from Addison's unfamiliarity with the play; and (3) the late change of title to suit the new emphasis his scenes gave the play. The first edition of The Tender Husband was a quarto printed for Tonson in 1705: THE | TENDER HUSBAND; | OR, THE | Accomplish'd Fools. | A | COMEDY. | As it is Acted at the | Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane . | By Her MAJESTY's SERVANTS. ∥ Written by Mr. STEELE . ∥ [motto] ∥ LONDON , | Printed for Jacob Tonson , within Grays-Inn Gate next | Grays-Inn Lane. 1705.

There are two states of gathering H, pages 50, 51, and 54 incorrectly numbered 58, 59, and 62 in the first state. Examination of this edition shows that two compositors worked on the manuscript, Compositor A setting gatherings B-E and Compositor B setting F-I. No definite assignment of preliminary gatherings π and A can be made. 3 Compositor B's half of the play begins approximately halfway through III.i at the line " C. Cl. I'll shew you, Madam," (see quoted passage below). The pages set by Compositor A are, as a rule, several lines longer than those set by Compositor B. Also there are other consistent differences in the work of the two compositors: Compositor A Compositor B Neice [two exceptions] Niece [one exception] Mrs. , Mr. , Sir [in speech prefixes] Mrs., Mr., Sir [Large type for act headings] [Small type] ( The ) End of the --- Act [Omitted] [Long dashes] [Short dashes] [Stage directions usually enclosed in parentheses, not square brackets] [Square brackets always used] Each compositor was reasonably consistent in the names and abbreviations used for speech prefixes. Compositor A used " Cle. S. ," " Cl. S. ," or once " Cler. " as abbreviations for Clerimont Senior. Compositor B consistently used " Cler. ," once abbreviating to " Cl. " But in two scenes, one set by Compositor A and one by Compositor B, the same character is given the speech prefix "Mr. Clerimont." 4 The compositors cannot be held responsible for the change. Compositor A introduces " Mr. " after having throughly established his system of speech prefixes and uses it only for one short appearance of the character. Compositor B sets " Cler. " on Sigs. G4 v -H1 v and uses "Clerimont" in the stage direction in the first line of H2 r before abruptly changing to "Mr. Cl. " for every speech prefix on Sigs. H2 r -3 r . His procedure, whether it was seriatim setting or setting by formes, cannot account for the new speech prefix. Therefore, "Mr." must have been present in the printer's copy in these two passages. But Steele did not put it there. One can reasonably assume he began writing "Clerimont Senior" and perhaps abbreviated to "Cler." as he proceeded, distinguishing this character from his younger brother by always using "Captain Clerimont" or "Captain" for the latter. It is entirely improbable that in only two of Clerimont Senior's three scenes with his wife the author would have capriciously substituted "Mr. Clerimont." Certainly he would not have written "Clerimont Senior" for the first half of V.i and then suddenly switched to "Mr. Clerimont" for the second half. Nor would a transcriber, had there been one, have introduced it, particularly in the middle of a scene. The source is obvious — a second manuscript in a second hand included with Steele's as printer's copy — the manuscript of Addison. Discrepancies in names and details of plot further separate these two scenes from the rest of the play. In the climactic scene of the play, V.i, for example, one character, Lucy Ragou, alias Fainlove, is called by the name of another, the maid Jenny. The error occurs when Clerimont Senior and his mistress Fainlove, working together, have trapped Mrs. Clerimont in a compromising position. Clerimont Senior say to Fainlove, "Well, Jenny , you topp'd your part, indeed —." When Mrs. Clerimont rushes vindictively at her rival, he cries, "Run, run Jenny ," and accordingly "Jenny" exits. It is possible that the man who wrote "Lucy" in the first act and showed Mrs. Clerimont with her maid Jenny in the third might call one character by the other's name in the fifth, but calling her by the wrong name three times seems unusually absent-minded. It is far more likely that Addison made the error. Compositor B, working from Addison's manuscript and having set no copy involving either Jenny or Lucy, followed copy and innocently retained the error. An error in plot and the unnecessary repetition of a line occur in Addison's part of III.i. First, Fainlove introduces Humphry Gubbin to Mrs. Clerimont; very soon after this introduction — only forty-nine printed lines later — in the part of the scene written by Addison, Mrs. Clerimont tells the Captain that his brother (i.e. Clerimont Senior) brought Humphry. The error is even more striking since the Captain was present when the introduction took place and needs no explanation whatever. Clearly one dramatist did not write the entire scene. Further, in the same scene, Mrs. Clerimont first tells the Captain, "Oh! Capt. Clerimont , I have a Quarrel with you," and sixteen lines later repeats, "But Capt. I have a quarrel to you." The repetition serves no dramatic purpose. The simplest explanation for it is that Addison reintroduced Steele's line at a more appropriate point in the scene, but neither man remembered to remove Steele's original line. The play was offered to Christopher Rich at the Drury Lane, about a month before it was first performed, as The City Nymph , the title referring to Biddy Tipkin, whose romance with the Captain forms a second plot line. It was advertised under this title as late as 21 April 1705, two days before its opening: "And on Monday next being the 23d of April, will be presented a new Comedy never acted before, call'd, The City Nymph; Or, The Accomplish'd Fools." 5 Not until the day of performance was the title changed in the advertisement to The Tender Husband . The last-minute revision of the play's title must have caused some confusion, unnecessary trouble, and perhaps expense as far as advertisement and playbills were concerned. Neither Steele nor Rich, certainly, would have changed it without good reason. Intrinsically, the new title had little to offer. Only a shift of emphasis from one plot line to another can satisfactorily explain the late change. Addison's new scenes, which emphasized Clerimont Senior's reformation of his wife, effected this shift. Further, the lateness of the change of title indicates the lateness of Addison's revisions of the play. Approximately a month had passed since Steele had brought his play to Rich; the actors had rehearsed and were ready to perform before the new title was published. Addison's scenes, then, must have been added well after the body of the play was completed. There can be little wonder that details in his manuscript were never closely checked for consistency. Corrections were made in the theatrical copy, assuredly, but the foul papers were never similarly treated. The two authors' papers must have gone to the printer sometime after the theatrical copy was made from them despite the fact that they remained uncorrected. Consequently the discrepancies discussed above, as well as others, appeared in the printed text. An example of the carelessness with which the printer's copy was prepared is the treatment of Steele's song celebrating the Battle of Blehheim. The song itself was excised from Act IV, since it was not sung in performance, and was printed instead in the prelims. However, lines at the end of Act II referring to it remained in the printer's copy although they no longer were appropriate to the action of the play: Pou. . . . You have seen her, the next Regular Approach is, that you cannot subsist a moment, without sending forth Musical Complaints of your misfortune by way of Serenade. Capt. I can nick you there, Sir — I have a Scribbling Army-Friend, that has Writ a triumphant, rare, noisy, Song, in Honour of our late Victory, that will hit the Nymph's Fantasque to a Hair, I'll get every thing ready as fast as possible. Carelessness in preparation of printer's copy was not unusual at the time; certainly it was not unusual for Steele. Corrections such as the change of the name "Jenny" in V.i to "Lucy" were probably made in the prompt copy without his knowledge; at any rate, they never reached the print shop. Instead the errors were printed, and reprinted in every subsequent edition. The point at which Addison began writing in V.i is obvious. The scene opens with Clerimont Senior and Fainlove discussing their plot against Mrs. Clerimont. Clerimont Senior hides, and his wife falls into their trap. Compositor B, as usual, uses the speech prefix " Cler. " and uses "Clerimont" in stage directions until the point at which Clerimont Senior rises from his hiding place to confront Mrs. Clerimont with her perfidy. From that exact point, in the middle of the scene, the speech prefixes are consistently "Mr. Cl. " Within this last part of the scene is the "Jenny" error. Addison's three pages extend from Clerimont Senior's "discovery" of his wife to his forgiving her; within the scene is an extraordinary amount of old-fashioned stage swordplay. Even without bibliographical evidence to the contrary, Steele's authorship of such a scene would have been surprising, because he detested duelling — the previous year he had ruined The Lying Lover by his zeal in preaching against it, and some years later he claimed he wrote The Conscious Lovers for the sake of the scene in which Bevil Junior evades a duel with his friend Myrtle. The limits of Addison's contribution in III.i are not as obvious. The scene opens on Mrs. Clerimont, Fainlove, and the maid Jenny. The first three pages exploit Mrs. Clerimont's French affectations, as described by her husband in I.i. Her spinet-master arrives with a song, and, in a manner characteristic of Steele, the song is read, then performed twice. The scene continues: Enter Servant- Ser. Madam, Captain Clerimont , and a very strange Gentleman, are come to wait on you. Mrs. Cl. Let him, and the very strange Gentleman come in. Fain. Oh! Madam, that's the Country Gentleman I was telling you of. Enter Numps and Capt. Cler. Fain.

Is not the higher one jumps the better? The bulk of evidence supports the theory that Steele wrote the first part of this scene, and Addison began writing at the point at which Clerimont Senior is introduced (1. 16) or arrives (l. 22) 6 and continued writing through line 55. This short passage includes all Compositor A's prefixes reading " Mr. Cl. ," the repetition of the line about Mrs. Clerimont's quarrel with the Captain (ll. 30-31), and the misinformation about Clerimont Senior introducing Humphry (ll. 53-54). If Addison did indeed write this passage, he did not display the least familiarity with any of Steele's manuscript beyond the few lines preceding his work. In fact, one must assume he was not familiar with Humphry's introduction (ll. 8-9), which preceded his work by only six lines, or with the passage in I.ii in which Fainlove offers to introduce him to Mrs. Clerimont. Further, he did not realize that Clerimont Senior had never even met Humphry at this point in the play. If Addison was familiar with the fact that Fainlove had introduced Humphry, he must have believed that the Captain was the brother of Fainlove rather than of Clerimont Senior. Indeed, he had written all of Clerimont Senior's lines in this scene and should have realized that this character did not introduce Humphry. Addison's misconception about the Captain would explain two curious things: the factually inaccurate line about the introduction, and Mrs. Clerimont's coquetry with the Captain, who, as Fainlove's brother, might have been another of her sparks. Whichever error Addison made, he clearly did not remember the introduction itself as he wrote his lines, or he would never have claimed that the Captain's brother left Humphry "to be diverted here till he calls for him." Addison wrote no lines for Fainlove in this scene; he may not have realized she was on stage. Therefore, this inaccurate line (ll. 53-54) could have referred, in his mind, to her as well as to Clerimont Senior, who had actually left the stage. There is a sharp contrast between the complete ignorance of preceding scenes which is demonstrated in this short passage and the keen awareness obvious in the lines immediately following. For example, two references to action in I.ii, the scene totally unknown to Addison, occur within the next seven lines. First, in the three lines following Addison's passage Humphry complains as he dances that his money jingles confoundedly and says he will never carry more than one pocketful again. This money was given to him by Pounce, Fainlove's actual brother, in I.ii, and distributed, a few coins in each pocket, for safekeeping. Second, mention of Humphry's marrying Fainlove's sister, i.e. Fainlove out of her male disguise, first occurs in I.ii, and this romance is pursued in the latter part of III.i. Steele, then, must have written these lines. Only one evidence of familiarity with previous scenes occurs in Addison's portion of III.i, and Steele was doubtless responsible for it too. One stage direction, interpolated in one of Mrs. Clerimont's speeches, reads " Here Fain. looking thro' a Perspective , bows to Cler. Senior ." Fainlove had mentioned perspectives to Clerimont Senior in I.i as one affectation of pert young fellows of the kind she impersonates. Her display of one here, as she bows to him, is a secret greeting. Steele's authorship of the stage direction, indicated by the knowing reference to the line about perspectives in I.i, is proved by the use of "Clerimont Senior" in Addison's scene. Since Addison wrote his passages late, this stage direction must have been written even later. In fact, the printing schedule suggests that Steele may have added it in the print shop. He entered the print shop late during printing, after I(i) was printed but before A(o) was on the press. At this time he corrected, in an erratum on A4 v , the penultimate line of the play, printed on I3 v , changing it from "Children and Wives obey whom they revere," to "Wives to Obey must Love, Children revere." If E(o) was, like A(o), printed late, he very possibly inserted the stage direction on E4 v at the same time as the erratum. The factual error about Humphry's introduction, on the other hand, had been printed on F1 earlier in the run and was probably never even copyread by Steele. If Addison's contributions extended beyond III.i, V.i, and the prologue which bears his byline, they cannot be readily detected or conclusively proved. Of course, the fact that Addison wrote parts of two scenes does not preclude the possibility that he also made other corrections and additions, although it weakens the probability that he wrote other major portions. Further examination of the text of the first edition, however, rules out the possibility that he wrote a number of the remaining scenes or corrected them. He did not, first of all, carefully correct Steele's manuscript. If he had, at least some of the numerous inaccuracies and undeveloped strands of plot would have been corrected or deleted; further, Addison would not have made so many factual errors in his own scenes. Addison's errors also rule out the possibility of his having written — or even carefully read — I.i, I.ii, and the early part of III.i, the scenes containing information about Humphry's introduction to Mrs. Clerimont, Lucy's name, and Jenny's identity. Further, those scenes in which the speech prefix "Clerimont Senior" or "Clerimont" occurs — I.i, the first part of III.i, and V.ii — are demonstrably not his. Steele wrote at least most and probably all of the scenes of Biddy's romance (I.i, III.i, IV.i, and IV.ii). Originally this was his main plot, for which the play was titled before Addison's scenes changed the emphasis. The plot is introduced in I.i, which is Steele's, as has been shown above. The printing scene, IV.ii, is freely adapted from Molière's Le Sicilien , a task for which Steele would not need his friend's help. Further, the consistency in speech prefixes referring to Biddy is a strong argument for a single author for her scenes. In the playbills of the time and in all contemporary references, this character is called "Biddy." Yet in the printed version of the play, her speech prefixes are without exception "Niece." 7 Had Addison added to these scenes, writing after the play was in rehearsal, one might certainly have expected to read "Biddy" for speech prefixes, since the character must have been known in the theatre by that name, as the playbills indicate. If the use of "Niece" is peculiar to Steele, we may add to his scenes III.ii, in which Biddy and Humphry meet and discuss their aversion to marrying each other as their guardians have planned. The humorous scenes between Sir Harry Gubbin and Tipkin, I.ii and V.ii, have often been attributed to Addison on grounds such as the "heightened humour" of the scenes 8 and Sir Harry's similarities to Addison's Tory Foxhunter in The Free-holder eleven years later. 9 The Tory Foxhunter may be modelled on Sir Harry, but this is no proof of authorship of the original; indeed, Fielding's Squire Western more closely resembles Sir Harry. In V.ii, the scene in which Sir Harry and Tipkin haggle over the marriage settlement, there is a close imitation of a passage in another of Molière's plays, L'Avare . 10 These two scenes are yoked in content to I.i and V.ii, both written by Steele, and they contain his stylistic idiosyncrasies such as the frequent use of parentheses within speeches. From the evidence cited above, several conclusions may be drawn about this first collaboration between Addison and Steele: First, Addison rather than Steele is responsible for the serious marital plot and the conventional sword-drawing. Addison's scenes were added late, shortly before the play opened, and were never carefully integrated with those parts of the play written earlier by Steele. His papers went with Steele's to the print shop, and the inaccuracies and inconsistencies resulting from the mixed printer's copy were not corrected by Steele in later editions.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Coleridge-Wordsworth Manuscript and "Sarah Hutchinson's Poets" by R. S. Woof</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sara Hutchinson, sister-in-law of Wordsworth and object of Coleridge's idealised passion, copied poems into a notebook which she entitled "Sarah Hutchinson's Poets". At one end of the book are poems by Words-worth, at the other end are poems by Coleridge. Mr. George Whalley attempted to date the Coleridge poems, both their composition and the date of entry into the notebook, but he dated them wrongly I believe, and thus gave too much weight to the significance the notebook had in the early relationship of Coleridge and Sara Hutchinson. (George Whalley, Coleridge and Sara Hutchinson , University of Toronto Press, 1955.) All the Wordsworth poems except the last, "Praised be the Art" which was composed in 1811, belong to the spring of 1802, and were probably copied into the notebook soon after Wordsworth wrote them, as the texts are early and little revised. Mr. Whalley argues that the first Coleridge poems were entered in the previous year, that it is consistent with the story of Sara Hutchinson's relationship with Coleridge to imagine her making copies of his poems in the summer of 1801. There are no actual records of Sara's feeling for Coleridge in 1801 or 1802, though clearly enough Coleridge was thinking about her and he probably wrote to her a good deal. Certainly if it could be shown that the first Coleridge poems in the book were copied down in 1801, then the book indeed might be said to reveal a special interest in Coleridge. The first Coleridge poem in the notebook is "The Mad Moon in a Passion", a slight, joking, familiar piece of verse arising out of Wordsworth's and Coleridge's habits of poeticising. This is printed for the first time by Mr. Whalley, and he suggests that it was composed in 1801. There is however another manuscript of the poem which seems to corroborate my belief that "The Mad Moon" was written and copied out in 1802. This sheet of paper is in Dove Cottage Library. 1 On it is a copy of "The Mad Moon" in Coleridge's hand; then, all pushed into the remaining space there are, in Dorothy Wordsworth's hand, copies of Wordsworth's "Tinker" and "Foresight"; in Wordsworth's hand, a few verse jottings of a stanza of "Farewell"; in Mary Wordsworth's heavy awkward hand in old age, a descriptive note: "This spoiled MS is the original of a printed Poem, in the handwriting of the Author S. T. Coleridge. M. W." The manuscript is indeed spoiled; one side of the folio sheet has a ragged half-moon shape torn out of it, and the poor quality paper is ruffled as though it has been kept in a much-used wallet. The watermark is a fleur-de-lys. But the surprise in Mary's note is the word "printed", for, as far as we know, "The Mad Moon" was never published by Coleridge. Perhaps of more moment is Mary's use of the word "original"; it suggests that this copy of the poem is, if not a composition draft, the first completed version. And I do think that this version on the Dove Cottage manuscript is earlier than that in "Sarah's Poets", and that this earlier version must be dated April 1802. This means a revision of Mr. Whalley's suggested dating, and consequently some reconsideration of the notebook, "Sarah's Poets". I collate the two versions here: first appears the "Sarah's Poets" version as presented in Coleridge and Sara Hutchinson (pp. 5-7), and second, to the right of the bracket is the Dove Cottage MS. version: Title : A Soliloquy of the full Moon, She being in a Mad Passion — ] The Full Moon in a Passion The Dove Cottage MS. has an additional opening line : Vexation! Vexation! Nought left in it's station! 16-21 They're my Torment and Curse And harrass me worse And bait me and bay me, far sorer I vow Than the Screech of the Owl Or the witch-wolf's long howl, Or sheep-killing Butcher-dog's inward Bow wow These lines are not in the Dove Cottage MS . 22 For ] And 23-43 The opening words of these lines are torn off in the Dove Cottage MS. but the rest of the lines correspond exactly with the "Sarah's Poets" text except for three slips ( made, presumably, in copying from a draft ) : in line 40 "of" is written over something illegible; in line 41 "and" is crossed out and "it" is inserted; in line 43 "saw" is written first as "say" and then corrected to "saw". 44 Ruffian ] witch-wolf 48 complete Barley-mow ] compleat Barly-mow! 49 he made a long leg ] no leave did he beg 51 But now Heaven be praised ] But now, fate be prais'd! 53 Yet my heart is still fluttering — ] But yet my Heart's fluttering; 55 at ] by 57 Line of a motionless Cloud ] Line [ word crossed out ] of a table-topp'd Cloud 58 And ho! what a Skittle-ground! ] What a capital Skittle ground! 60 In brightness &amp; size ] In size and in brightness 65 And still Heaven be prais'd ] And still, Fate be prais'd, After line 66, the last in the text of "Sarah's Poets", the Dove Cottage MS. continues with 13 lines: So here's Botheration, To these Pests of the Nation Those fun jeering; Conjuring, Sky-staring; Loungering, Vagrants, that nothing can leave in its station — These muttering, Spluttering, Ventriloquo-gusty Poets With no Hats Or Hats that are rusty Undramatic as these variants are, cumulatively they point to the Dove Cottage manuscript as certainly earlier than that in "Sarah's Poets". Those extra lines in the Dove Cottage manuscript (the opening line and the concluding thirteen lines) are generally repetitive and their omission in the "Sarah's Poets" version strengthens the poem; on the other hand the unique lines in the latter text (lines 16-21) consciously add mischievous comparisons. These lines further explain why the moon in the Dove Cottage manuscript refers to the poet abusively as a "witch-wolf" (line 44), while in "Sarah's Poets" he is rather more lamely called a "Ruffian"; in the extra lines in the "Sarah's Poets" text, the "witch-wolf's long howl" is one of the noises that the moon far prefers to the voice of a poet, and thus "Ruffian" replaces "witch-wolf" later in the poem. This is an unlikely emendation to make in reverse. Coleridge's "Mad Moon" is not the only poem to indicate textually that the Dove Cottage sheet of paper is an earlier manuscript than "Sarah's Poets". The two complete Wordsworth poems on the Dove Cottage manuscript (not previously recorded there) appear also in "Sarah's Poets", and the texts differ sufficiently to establish that the notebook contains the later copies. After line 42 of "The Tinker", for example, the line, "Like a Bullfinch black &amp; red", is inserted in the Dove Cottage manuscript; this is properly incorporated into the text in "Sarah's Poets". Again, in line 1 of "Foresight" in the Dove Cottage manuscript there is a unique correction; "That is work which I am [ ruing]" is crossed out and replaced by "Ann that work of yours I'm [ruing]". Wordsworth clearly did not like his correction and the deleted line appears in the other versions before 1815. 2 Again, the Dove Cottage manuscript helps to establish, if not certainly, then with the strongest probability, that Coleridge wrote "The Mad Moon" in April, 1802, and sent the poem to Wordsworth in the same month. First, all the poems on the manuscript, which, I repeat, is a single folio sheet, must belong to a period earlier than June 14, 1802, for the stanza of "Farewell" that Wordsworth has drafted there contains the phrase, "primrose vest", and this, Wordsworth wrote to Mary Hutchinson on June 14, was to be altered. The fragment on the Dove Cottage manuscript is half lost by the tear, and thus I have used below square brackets to indicate words or letters supplied by me; square brackets with a question mark denote words difficult to read: the best a [?living] eye [c]lad in its primrose vest [Glittered at evening li]ke a starry sky the hedge [?side] beautify little sparrow built its [?nest] be [?gone] in its mortal[ity] [?Some thing] [?] must stay to tell us of the rest This version might be a part of Wordsworth's revision of June 13 (see Dorothy's Journal), but possibly it dates from before May 29 when Dorothy records, "William finished his poem on going for Mary". Second, it seems clear from the physical arrangement of poems on the manuscript that before Wordsworth jotted down the stanza of "Farewell", Dorothy had already written out "Foresight" and "The Tinker". And in her Journal she tells us about the composition of these poems. On April 27, 1802, she writes, "In the evening Wm. began to write The Tinker . We had a letter and verses from Coleridge." The next day, "At dinner time he [Wordsworth] came in with the poem of Children gathering Flowers , but it was not quite finished, and it kept him long off his dinner. It is now done. He is working at The Tinker ." The following day she notes, "Before we went out, after I had written down The Tinker , which William finished this morning, Luff called. . ." On April 27, "verses from Coleridge", on April 28, "Foresight" is composed, on April 29, a copy of "The Tinker" in Dorothy's hand. This combination can surely point only to the Dove Cottage manuscript, which, as I have already indicated, cannot be dated after June 14, 1802. The "verses from Coleridge" must be "The Mad Moon". Coleridge probably sent them soon after composition, for, as we saw, the text seems an earlier one than that copied out by Sara Hutchinson, and it was his habit to send poems "hot" to Wordsworth. Finally, for a variety of supporting reasons, it generally makes sense that "The Mad Moon" should belong to 1802, rather than to 1800 or 1801. Mr. Whalley himself (see pp. 30, 31) recognised that the "references to Voss and to Peter Bell suggest, at first sight, a later date [than 1800 or 1801]". They do indeed; Coleridge planned to translate Voss in 1802 and Wordsworth had revised "Peter Bell" in that February. And it is surely wrong to imply, as Mr. Whalley does (footnote p. 31), that "The Mad Moon" could not have been written after "Dejection", presumably because Mr. Whalley does not feel it proper for the trivial mood of "The Mad Moon" to follow the solemn, moving "Dejection". Even without knowledge of the Dove Cottage manuscript I have described, a careful consideration of Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal might have tempered the view that Sara Hutchinson's notebook is some kind of oblique declaration about Coleridge in 1801. Or, it could be argued, editors might have annotated the Journal more completely. The second Coleridge poem in Sara's notebook is "The Language of Birds" ("Do you ask what the Birds say? The Chaffinch, the Dove"); it is without title in "Sarah's Poets". Mr. Whalley again, I think wrongly, suggests that this poem was composed in the spring of 1801 and copied out by Sara later that year. But Dorothy's Journal again is illuminating: on May 6, 1802 she writes, "a letter from Coleridge with verses to Hartley." These verses to his son are surely "The Language of Birds". When this poem was published in the Morning Post for October 6, 1802, Coleridge gave it the title: "The Language of Birds: Lines spoken extempore, to a little child, in early spring." The next October, Coleridge sent the poem to the Beaumonts, and the title then was: "Extempore — to a Child of Six Years Old". Hartley had barely gone seven by that time. Coleridge's title perhaps deliberately paralleled Wordsworth's in the latter's recent poem to Hartley: "To H.C. Six Years Old." Certainly it would have been odd for Coleridge to give the Six Years title to a poem he had written in 1801 (Mr. Whalley's date for the composition) when Hartley was only four. And of course such an early date would leave Dorothy's "verses to Hartley" of May, 1802, unidentified. 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I wish to thank the Chairman and Trustees of the Dove Cottage Library for permission to use this manuscript. 2 The text otherwise is that found in "Sarah's Poets" (see the Oxford Words-worth I,228, and, second edition, II, Appendix II, p. 541) with the exception of some minor variants: "Ann" is spelt without an "e"; there are some punctuation changes; line 14 has "&amp;" where other texts have "or"; there is a spelling variant in line 21 — "Daisies must be daizies still". 3 In one or two other ways I am able to add some information to what we have been told about the notebook, "Sarah's Poets". First, a minor point: Mr. Whalley (p. 4, footnote) states that the manuscript has no watermark. Miss Joanna Hutchinson has kindly allowed me to examine it and I find that six leaves are marked "J. What-man / 1794". Second (again a footnote on page 4), Mr. Whalley is unable to identify the initials "P. M. J." which appear after the one poem in the notebook not by Wordsworth or Coleridge. This poem is in the Wordsworth end of the book; it is preceded by "A Farewell" (in the text revised by June 14, 1802) and followed by "Praised be the Art" (known to be written not long before August 28, 1811). It is "The Otaheitan Mourner", and it appeared, presumably for the first time, in the Monthly Magazine for December, 1808. It is signed "P. M. J.", has the address, Birmingham, and the following introductory note which Sara also copies into her notebook: "Peggy Stuart was the daughter of an Otaheitan chief, and Married to one of the Mutineers of the Bounty. On Stuart's being seized &amp; carried away in the Pandora Frigate, Peggy fell into a rapid decay, and in two months died of a broken heart leaving an infant daughter, who is still surviving." Perhaps Robert Southey had something to do with Sara's interest in the poem. In the Quarterly Review for August, 1809, Southey reviewed the Transactions of the South Sea Missionary Society (1804-), which contained the original account of the story of Peggy Stuart. In a footnote he quotes the third and fourth stanzas of "P.M.J.'s" poem and adds: "The whole poem (though not free from faults) is so beautiful that we should gladly have transcribed it had our limits permitted its insertion." On October 23 of the same year, 1809, he comments to Grosvenor Bedford: "Is not that a sad story of Stewart &amp; the Taheitan Girl? — the verses are by a young Banker of Birmingham by name James, who sent me some of his first attempts for the intended third vol. of the Anthology. By that circumstance I discovered them to be his, &amp; as I really admired them very much, inserted them in the Quarterly partly for the sake of giving him &amp; his friends a very unexpected pleasure, for which they do not know to whom they are obliged." (Quoted from an unpublished letter in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, by kind permission of the Keeper of Manuscripts.) The Quaker records show (Mr. Edward H. Milligan has generously helped me with them) that Paul Moon James was indeed a "Banker of Birmingham" by 1808. Like Southey, he came from Bristol. He was born on January 16, 1780, the son of William, described as a Grocer in 1783, and Priscilla. He moved to Birmingham early in 1805, and on August 3, 1808, described as a banker, he married Olivia Lloyd, sister of Charles Lloyd, the poet. In 1836 he moved to Manchester to become the first managing director of the Manchester and Salford bank, and he died there in 1854. James' connexion with Bristol and with the Lloyd family would account for Southey's wish to give "him &amp; his friends a very unexpected pleasure."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Date of Blake's Pickering Manuscript or The Way of a Poet with Paper by G. E. Bentley, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On February 18th 1826 William Blake told Crabb Robinson, "I have written more than Voltaire or Rousseau — Six or Seven Epic poems as long as Homer and 20 Tragedies as long as Macbeth", 1 and Allan Cunningham reported that at his death in 1827 Blake "left volumes of verse, amounting, it is said, to nearly an hundred, prepared for the press". 2 Most of these manuscripts are lost, probably burned by Frederick Tatham, who came into possession of most of Blake's property on the death of his widow, but one of them, perhaps less theologically startling than the others, survived in eleven sheets stitched into paper wrappers. This manuscript was first publicly referred to in Alexander Gilchrist's Life of William Blake in 1863, 3 when a number of poems from it were published. Gilchrist did not mention that the owner was Frederick Tatham, but within a year or so the manuscript, with a covering letter by Tatham, was offered for £15.15.0 by the London dealer Francis Harvey. In his catalogue Harvey said, apparently of Tatham, This manuscript had been offered previously to several gentlemen for 25 guineas. . . . The MS. was lent to Mr Gilchrist, who has reprinted a portion of it. . . . 4 By 1866 it had come into the possession of the publisher Basil Montagu Pickering in whose edition of Songs of Innocence and Experience, with Other Poems it was published in that year, 5 and since that time it has been known as the Pickering Manuscript. It has been in private hands in the United States since the end of the nineteenth century, and apparently no scholarly text has been printed from the manuscript itself. I am deeply indebted to Mrs Landon K. Thorne, the present owner, who generously allowed me to study the manuscript at leisure. The Pickering Manuscript contains fair copies of ten of Blake's loveliest and most enigmatic poems: "The Smile", "The Golden Net", "The Mental Traveller", "The Land of Dreams", "Mary", "The Crystal Cabinet", "The Grey Monk", "Auguries of Innocence", "Long John Brown and Little Mary Bell", and "William Bond". Most are narrative poems, and some of Blake's best known lines are to be found here, including: To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower[,] Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour and a Tear is an Intellectual Thing And a Sigh is the Sword of an angel King And the bitter groan of the Martyrs woe Is an Arrow from the Almighties Bow[.] Recently these poems have been receiving increased attention, 6 and it would be well if we could lighten the obscurity that surrounds their early history. In particular it would help if we could date the poems, for modern scholarship tends to analyse Blake's writings in a strict chronological context. Unfortunately the paper on which the poems are written bears no visible watermark, and there appear at first to be no external indications of date, such as the signatures of early owners or contemporary references to the poems. Most scholars have agreed with Sampson that internal evidence suggests a date of 1801 to 1803, 7 but this internal evidence is by no means conclusive. It consists principally of repetitions of phrases from "The Grey Monk", "Mary" and "The Golden Net" in Blake's Notebook among other passages written about 1801 to 1803, in his Jerusalem , parts of which were first engraved about 1804, and in Blake's letter of August 16th 1803. Sampson says that "'Mary' was certainly written before" the 1803 letter, because in a ten-line poem about himself in the letter Blake used two lines ("O why was I born with a different face? Why was I not born like that rest of my race?") adapted from the forty-eight-line narrative poem "Mary" ("O why was I born with a different Face[?] Why was I not born like this Envious Race[?]"). It does not seem to me, however, that any priority can "certainly" be deduced from the relationship of these four lines, particularly in view of Blake's known habit of quoting himself in a different context after a lapse of years. (For instance, in The Four Zoas of 1797 to about 1808 he repeats some seventy-five lines from Tiriel [1789?], Visions of the Daughters of Albion [1793], America [1793], The Book of Urizen [1794], and The Book of Ahania [1795].) Blake might well have written "Mary" years before or after 1803 as far as any relationship with the August letter will "certainly" show. The priority is at least a little clearer with "The Golden Net" and "The Grey Monk". The untitled Notebook version of "The Golden Net" is clearly a fairly rough draft, with numerous deletions and second thoughts. A number of differences between the two versions are ambiguous, such as the alteration of the Notebook "flaming" to "Burning" in line 23 of the Pickering Manuscript copy. Most of the clear indications, however, point to the Pickering version as being a fair copy of the Notebook draft, rather than any other relationship (such as the Notebook version being a revision of the Pickering Manuscript, or both being based on a third, lost, version). In lines 6, 7, 24, 26, the Pickering copy follows the corrected rather than the deleted phrases in the Notebook draft, and in line 3 it eliminates the infelicitous second repetition of the phrase Alas for wo alas for we alas for wo They cry &amp; tears for ever flow[.] The priority of the Notebook draft of "The Golden Net" over the Pickering Manuscript fair copy seems moderately clear. The conclusion is similar in a somewhat more complicated situation for "The Grey Monk". The Notebook draft is a sixty-one-line untitled first person narrative poem with numerous alterations and twenty-one lines of afterthought not clearly marked for insertion. The Pickering Manuscript fair copy is a thirty-six line third person narrative using lines 19-22, 15-18, 23-43, 57-61, and 44-48 of the Notebook draft. In Jerusalem plate 52, lines 1-16 of the Notebook draft are used with lines 1-10 of the additional stanzas (including the new draft of lines 57-61 used also in the Pickering Manuscript). The Jerusalem version clearly derives from the Notebook and not from the Pickering Manuscript; two of its stanzas appear in the former but not in the latter. The Pickering fair copy also seems to derive from the Notebook. When lines 25, 34, 47, 58, and 60 of the Notebook draft were copied in the Pickering Manuscript, the corrected rather than the deleted phrases were repeated. Similarly, in lines 20, 22, 44, and 57 of the Notebook are found phrases which were improved in the Pickering draft. (For instance, line 44 of the Notebook reads "The hand of vengeance sought the bed", but the intention is made clearer in the Pickering Manuscript with the alteration of the verb to "found".) It seems probable, then, from the internal evidence, that the first drafts of some of these poems were written with others in Blake's Notbook about 1801 to 1803, and one of them was perhaps composed on August 16th 1803. This, of course, only gives us an initial terminus. The Pickering fair copies could have been written at any time between 1803 and Blake's death in 1827, so far as this internal evidence is concerned. There is, however, a piece of external evidence which has not heretofore been recorded. On page 16 of the Pickering Manuscript in the bottom left hand corner there appears to be an erasure, from which only four small fragments survive. They are so faint and vague as to be almost indecipherable except for one peculiarity. The lines are firmer, more regular, and (if such a word may be permitted for a straight line less than a sixteenth of an inch long) more angular than might be expected in ordinary writing. In fact, the erased word appears to have been printed from type, not inscribed by hand. A study of the roughened surface of the paper, and in particular of the verso, where the pressure of the type seems to have left an impressed image, suggests that the word was "With". But why should there be an isolated printed word on an otherwise blank page? It is difficult to imagine why just one word should have been printed on a page — but perhaps this one word was originally accompanied by many others: The other words may have been to the left of this one, and have been cut off. But in what circumstances would one expect to find a word (particularly one beginning with a capital letter) well to the right of others on a page? It might happen in an extra long line of poetry, or it might happen with a catchword, particularly at the foot of a page of poetry. Except for ill-set display pages (such as broadsides or titlepages), I cannot think of other ordinary circumstances in which one might find such an isolated printed word as the "With" in the Pickering Manuscript. The question then arises, under what circumstances might Blake have been using sheets of printed poetry on which to write his poem? Fortunately, the list of known possibilities is very short. Though Blake was a printer, he is only known to have printed from copperplates, not from type, and though he was a poet, only one volume of his poetry ( Poetical Sketches ) was printed in conventional type and circulated. However, he did have in his hands considerable quantities of the sheets to a little volume entitled Designs to A Series of Ballads [by William Hayley] which were published by and for Blake in four numbers on June 1st, July 1st, August 5th, and September 9th 1802, and when he found he could not sell these Ballads Blake regularly used the sheets as scratch paper. On May 28th 1802 Hayley wrote to his friend Lady Hesketh: Do not be surprised if you receive in about a Fortnight a Bundle of Ballads, for I have a wicked project of turning your Ladyship into a Ballad Monger for the sake of serving the excellent friendly artist, who has been working long &amp; patiently by my side on our portraits of Cowper. — He has drawn &amp; engraved some very ingenious designs of his own to a series of singular Ballads, one of which He proposes to publish every Month with three prints annexed to it. — for the moderate price of half a crown[.] 8 The text of Hayley's poem was set by the nearby Chichester printer Joseph Seagrave, a friend of both Blake and Hayley, and Blake printed his engraved designs on the spaces left for them, stitched the separate Ballads in blue wrappers, and sold them, largely through Hayley's friends like Lady Hesketh. (We may be confident that Seagrave printed the sheets first and then gave them to Blake rather than vice versa, for a few pages of the printed text survive which have not yet had the engraved designs added to them.) The sales through such genteel ballad-mongers as Lady Hesketh proved so slow that Blake probably did not even recover his expenses, and on April 3rd 1803 Hayley wrote to the London publisher R.H. Evans (who also sold the Ballads ) to ask him to send me your full &amp; frank opinion concerning the adventure of my worthy Friend Blake, in the Ballads, that I gave him in a sanguine Hope of putting a little Money in his pocket. — He suspended their publication, that He might proceed, without any Interruption, in his plates for the Life of Cowper, which have engrossed much of his time even to this Hour, as He and his good industrious Wife together take all the Impressions from the various Engravings in their own domestic Press — Do you think it will answer to Him to resume the series of the Ballads? 9 Six months later no decision had yet been reached about the Ballads , and on October 26th 1803 Blake wrote to Hayley: I called on Mr. Evans, who gives small hopes of our ballads; he says he has sold but fifteen numbers at the most, and that going on would be a certain loss of almost all the expenses. I then proposed to him to take a part with me in publishing them on a smaller scale, which he declined. . . . It was not until some fourteen months later that the fate of the quarto Ballads issued in parts was decided. On January 22nd 1805 Blake wrote to Hayley to express his thanks for your generous manner of proposing the Ballads to him [ the publisher Richard Phillips ] on my account, and to inform you of his advice concerning them; and he thinks that they should be published all together in a volume the size of the small edition of the Triumphs of Temper [ by Hayley ], with six or seven plates. . . . That we must consider all that has been printed as lost, and begin anew, unless we can apply some of the plates to the new edition. Even with this apparently plain understanding, however, it was not until April 25th 1803 that Blake could write to Hayley: This Morning I have been with M r Phillips &amp; have entirely settled with him the plan of Engraving for the new Edition of the Ballads. It would have been only at this time, or perhaps on June 18th 1805 when the octavo volume of Ballads was published, that Blake could have been confident that he could no longer sell the old quarto edition in numbers. Before the spring of 1805, there must have appeared a good chance that some of the quarto Ballads might still be sold separately, and it is unlikely that Blake would yet have begun tearing up the printed sheets to use for scratch paper. After the spring of 1805, however, he would have been morally obliged to cease publication of the quarto separate Ballads in competition with the collected octavo edition, particularly in view of Phillips's explicit statement "That we must consider all that has been printed as lost". After June or January 1805 he must have had no choice but to make the best of the wreck of the original project, by using the blank paper from the 1802 edition in any way he could. Mostly, of course, he must have used these printed sheets for notes or sketches that have been long since lost. However, at least twelve such sheets may be traced more or less confidently, and it is very likely that others have yet to be identified. Those traced are: 1) The blank verso of the Titlepage on which Blake transcribed a poem by Sheridan. 2) The blank back of Page 9 (Ballad I) with a sketch of "The Chaining of Orc". 3) Page 9 verso with a sketch of Catherine Blake. 4) Page 9 verso with a sketch of a leg. 5) Pages 20 and 26 (Ballad II) with a sketch perhaps for Dante. 6) Pages 21 and 24 with sketches of a terrified runner. 7) Page 37 (Ballad III) used in the binding of America copy O. 8) Pages 41-48 (Ballad III) bound into Blake's Notebook. 9) Page unknown used for Blake's letter of October 14th 1807. 10) Page 9 verso with a sketch of A Figure in Flight. 11) Pages 20 and 26 with a sketch of A Figure seated under a Tree. For most of these pages, the evidence connecting them with the 1802 Ballads is clear, but the date at which they were re-used is not so clear. It seems possible to me that the earliest of these is the letter of 1807 (which is associated with the 1802 Ballads by the most dubious evidence) and the latest about 1825. For sketches or manuscripts of unknown date on 1802 Ballads paper we should therefore expect a date of between 1807 and 1825. Let us first establish the connection of the pages above with the 1802 Ballads and then try to date them as closely as possible. 1) Sheridan's poem is copied on the verso of the Ballads titlepage, 10 so there can be no doubt of the source of the paper. The poem is a song from a popular farce which was repeatedly printed from 1780 on, but Blake of course cannot have transcribed it on the Ballads paper before 1802. 2) The entire text of page 9 is plainly visible on the recto of the sheet on which Blake sketched "The Chaining of Orc", 11 so that here too the paper source cannot be doubted. The sketch itself much resembles one in America (1793) plate 3, and is related to one in The Four Zoas (1797) page 62, but of course it can have been made no earlier than June 1802. There is, however, an isolated engraving of "The Chaining of Orc" of 1812 12 which differs in treatment from the present sketch but which may yet have been the occasion for Blake to record and work out his ideas on the subject. 1812 is at least a possible guess for the Orc sketch on the Ballads page. 3) The sketch of Catherine on the back of another page 9 13 has always been dated about 1803 because of its association with the 1802 Ballads . This seems to me, however, to be insufficient grounds for such an early date. It would be safer to call it merely "after 1802", or better "probably after 1805". 4) The sketch of a human leg also on a page 9 14 is so tentative and fragmentary as to offer nothing to which to attach a date. 5) The "Dante" sketch is on a sheet of paper with the printed catchword "With" at the bottom left corner, and on the verso the last letters of a printed word may be seen: "ast". 15 The type and position of the former exactly match that of the catchwords on Ballads page 20, which is the only "With" catchword in the volume. The "ast" are the last letters of the word "breast" which reach considerably further into the right margin of page 26 (the conjugate page in Ballad II) than any other line. This is clearly a sheet of Ballads paper. The date of the drawing, unfortunately is not so clear. It is certainly similar to other Dante drawings, with flying demons overhead and tormented souls floating in the mire at the foot, but it is not obviously related to any given Dante drawing. If it was made for the Dante series, its date can scarcely be earlier than 1824, when the other Dante drawings were begun. 6) The sketches of a terrified running figure are on a sheet of paper with a printed catchword ("It") on one side and a scratched out printed word which may be "Run" on the other, corresponding to pages 21 and 24 (E2 r , E[3] v ) of the Ballads . The subject has not been confidently identified, and the date is unknown. 15a 7) In the binding of America copy O (now in the Fitzwilliam Museum) may be plainly seen a fragment of " Ballad the Third [ page ] 37", so that the connection of the binding scrap with the 1802 Ballads cannot be doubted. The earliest possible date of the binding may be established very confidently. Though America is dated 1793, the watermarks in this copy are of 1818 and 1820; the watermarks of Europe (1794) copy K with which it is bound are also 1818 and 1820. This set originally belonged to John Linnell, and its gilt white vellum binding is very similar to that on the unwatermarked Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1793?) copy H (now in the Fitzwilliam Museum) which Linnel bought from Blake on April 30th 1821 for £2.2.0; to that on copy R of Songs of Innocence and of Experience (now in the Fitzwilliam) watermarked 1808 (end papers 1824) which Linnell bought for £1.19.6 on August 27th 1819; and to Jerusalem (1804-1820?) copy C (now in the possession of Mrs. G. Ramsay Harvey) watermarked 1818, 1819, and 1820, the second chapter of which Linnell evidently paid 14s for on December 30th 1819. 16 It seems likely that Linnell had these four bindings made about 1824 and that the Ballads page was first used in the binding at this time. 8) Pages 117-120 of Blake's Notebook have been bound into the manuscript as an afterthought. At the top margin of page 117 is an italic letter B which is identical in shape and distance from the top margin with the initial letter of the word " Ballad " on page 45 of the fourth Ballad. On page 118 the very beginning of the first letters of " Ballad the Third " (the running title) and of the first and third lines of the first stanzas ("The Dog" and "It was") are visible. On page 120 of the Notebook is a catchword "And" which comes from Ballads page 46. For all, the positioning, shape of letters, size, and so on, are identical in the Notebook Fragments and in the 1802 Ballads . The connection of the two cannot be doubted. The date itself is relatively clear. Pages 117-119 contain a draft advertisement for "Blake's Chaucer An Original Engraving" first announced in 1809 in his Descriptive Catalogue and published October 8th 1810. This draft must then be from 1809 or 1810. On page 120 is part of "The Everlasting Gospel" which is usually dated about 1818. These Ballads pages were therefore evidently not used before about 1809. 9) Blake's letter of October 14th 1807 is written on paper watermarked "180[2?]". 17 If the last numeral has been correctly deciphered, this may be the same paper as that used in the 1802 Ballads which is also watermarked "1802". 10) The verso of a sketch of A Figure in Flight, in the British Museum Print Room (pressmark: LB 43 7b) has the last three lines of " End of the First Ballad ." The date of the drawing is conjectural. 11) The recto of the sketch of A Figure seated under a Tree, in the British Museum Print Room (LB 43 3a) has an erased catchword which seems to be "With", and on the verso the letters, "st" from "breast" are visible, indicating that these were originally pages 20 and 26 (see no. 5 above). The context and date of the drawing are not known. To summarize the information about the dates at which the Ballads paper was re-used for other purposes: the sketches of Catherine, the terrified runner, the figure seated under a tree, the figure in flight and the anonymous leg, and the transcript of the Sheridan poem, cannot be confidently dated; the letter is dated October 14th 1807, the Notebook fragment is after 1809; the "Chaining of Orc" sketch may be about 1812; the binding of America copy O must be about 1824; and the Dante drawing, if it has been correctly identified, must be given a date after 1824. This evidence seems to support the hypotheses above from the publishing history that Blake would have begun to use his Ballads for scratch paper only after 1805. Let us return now to see in what ways this evidence applies to the Pickering Manuscript. The visible remains of the erased printed word at the bottom of page 16 (on which part of "Auguries of Innocence" is written) consists of one line at an angle to and higher than the three others, as if of a capital M or W. To its right are two dots on either side of a very short vertical line. The position of these three marks suggests that they are the bottom of the printed word. Though one may imagine, after long study with a magnifying glass and much vain tilting of the page to catch the light in impressed hollows from which the ink has been erased, that the word was "With", we must first ascertain that it could not fit some other word in the 1802 Ballads . For this purpose a xerox copy of page 16 of the Pickering Manuscript was made on translucent paper. The Princeton copy of the four very rare Ballads was then carefully examined for all possible examples of line-ends which reached into the right margin well beyond the others and for catchwords which stood significantly to the right of the text above them and which began with a capital letter with a slanting line like the erased initial one on page 16 of the Pickering Manuscript (A, M, N, V, W, X, Y). No possible line-ends appeared, but among the catchwords the possibilities were "What" (pp. 1, 25), "Not" (4, 45), "A" (11), "No" (14), "And" (16, 23, 42, 46), "Ah!" (19), "With" (20), "More" (33), and "When" (50). On these catchwords the xerox copy of page 16 of the Pickering Manuscript was superimposed so that the angle line in the erased fragment just covered part of the angled line (or, in the case of W, first one and then the other of the angled lines) in the capital letter of the catchword. In several cases, in "When", "What", and "With", the fit was quite close, but in only one case was it exact. On the "With" on page 20 the fit of the fragments from page 16 of the Pickering Manuscript is quite perfect. The coincidence of the lines surviving from the erasure with the catchword is so complete that there can be little doubt of their original identity. The paper on which pages 15-16 of the Pickering Manuscript are written originally formed the outer margin of pages 19-20 of Hayley's Designs to Series of Ballads . This conclusion being accepted, what consequences follow from it? The most important ones, I believe, relate to the date at which the poems in the Pickering Manuscript were transcribed. 1) Since the unwatermarked page 16 of the Pickering Manuscript is on paper which, when the margins have not been cut off, shows a watermark of "1802", it is probable that all the paper in the Pickering Manuscript came from the 1802 Ballads and would, if the sheets were complete, exhibit this same watermark of "1802". 2) Pages 15 and 16 of the Pickering Manuscript, and almost certainly the rest of the pages as well, can scarcely have been re-used before July 1st 1802 when the second Ballad containing page 20 and its revealing catchword "With" were published. In particular, pages 15 and 16 at least cannot have been transcribed as early as 1801, as Sampson and others following him have surmised. 3) The Pickering Manuscript poems are unlikely to have been transcribed on the abandoned Ballads sheets before the spring of 1805, when it first became clear to Blake "That we must consider all that has been printed as lost." 4) It would be reasonable to associate the uncertain date of the transcription of the Pickering Manuscript poems with the more certain dates of some of the other uses to which the Ballads sheets were put. We should, that is, be prepared to accept a date of 1807 or 1809 to 1824 as likely for this transcription. These arguments from the paper used in the Pickering Manuscript apply, of course, only to the date at which the poems in it were transcribed . They do not bear at all upon their date of composition unless we are to argue that the poems were first written down in the Pickering Manuscript. This argument would be difficult to maintain confidently. The first drafts of Blake's poems, as seen for instance in his Notebook and in The Four Zoas , are tormented with deletions, afterthoughts, erasures, and uncertainties. In the Notebook draft of "The Grey Monk", for example, there are nine substantial changes of words or lines in the first sixty-one lines, including an extra line in the fourteenth stanza. Then six new stanzas were added, one with only three lines and one with only one ("A tear is an &amp;c"), three substantial changes were made in the additional lines, and the stanzas were renumbered. By contrast the Pickering Manuscript poems are clearly fair copies, with very few significant changes. On pages 1-3, 7-9, 14, and 18, a few lower cases letters were altered to capitals; on pages 6, 10, and 16, a few words were erased and replaced; and on pages 18 and 19 six deletions and alterations are made neatly in a different (brown) ink. In only five poems are there any changes of substance, and in "The Grey Monk" there are no changes of any kind. The Pickering Manuscript is perhaps the best example of a manuscript fair copy by Blake that has survived. The dates of its transcription will therefore tell us little about the date of composition of the poems in it beyond giving us a final terminus. Unfortunately the external evidence adduced here merely suggests that the Pickering Manuscript poems cannot have been transcribed before July 1802 and may have been written between about 1809 and 1824. It might be well if the Pickering Manuscript were known by a title more relevant to Blake and to its contents, instead of merely by the name of its third known owner who had it for about twelve years. In a similar situation, Blake's Notebook was for years known as "The Rossetti Manuscript" because it belonged for a time to Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who indeed like Pickering preserved and first published the poems in the manuscript at length. The more relevant and convenient title, "Blake's Notebook", has only come into general use in the last thirty years. I suggest that a name usefully describing the period, the paper, and the subjects of some of the poems in the "Pickering Manuscript" might be The Ballads Manuscript. The name would at least have the advantage of referring to a permanent rather than a temporary feature of the manuscript. The way of a poet with paper seems, in the case of Blake, to be almost as predictable as the way of a man with a maid. His poverty and his frugality directed that when he had in hand redundant stocks of paper no longer useful for their original purpose, he should carefully use them for other purposes as well. Thus when he was given some nine hundred sheets of 1794 J WHATMAN paper for his Night Thoughts engravings, he not only used it for his Night Thoughts drawings and proofs but as well for much of the manuscript of his Four Zoas , for printing several copies of his works in Illuminated Printing, and for backing sheets when printing his 1802 Ballads . 18 Similarly, when it became plain that he could not sell the 1802 Ballads Blake used the blank margins of the printed sheets for letters. sketches, and poems. It seems likely that when those habits are more widely recognized, more examples of the ways in which Blake used these paper stocks will be observed 19 and more precision may be achieved in dating his manuscripts, drawings, and illuminated books.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Arithmetic Colophons in Nineteenth-Century Books by William B. Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In certain English books, all undated but apparently of the 1880's, there appears below imprint at end of text a formula which, at present, I can only partially decipher. Possibly the ten examples given below, along with collations and assorted conjectures, may lead others to a proper interpretation. Fortunately, as a means of comparison, a number of these entries are found in "The Grosvenor Poets," a series edited by William M. Rossetti, published by William Collins, Sons, &amp; Co., and printed by S. Cowan &amp; Co. at Perth. In these volumes the Byron has no imprint, the Cowper and Pope an imprint but no formula, two others an imprint with further notation: Volume Collation Formula Wordsworth [a] 8 A-2M 8 2N 4 5-19-64Q-9-82 Milton [a] 2 [b] 8 A-2E 8 2F 6 3-15-80 Q10-82 In all entries the first number defies analysis. Except for the Coleridge volume, cited later, the second entry records, to the nearest round number, one-half of the full gatherings required for the book — a number which might suggest (were it not for contrary evidence given below) that the sheets were originally double-size, 19 and 15 here representing, for each copy, the total count. References 64Q and 80 Q may pertain not to quires but (again as later evidence will show) to the number of reams for each job. If so, however, the Wordsworth issue, in relation to the Milton, would be far less than the ratio 64/80, for it requires more paper (19/15) per copy. The last two numbers would seem to indicate date of printing, that is, September and October 1882 respectively. Two other volumes, printed apparently in April and May 1883, now carry, as final entry in the formula, a reference to paper stock. Hood (1) [a] 8 b 8 A-2B 8 5-14-86Q.-4-83-C.14 Hood (2) [a] 8 b 2 A-2F 8 2G 6 3-16-76-Q.-5-83-C.-14 Four more volumes, now exhibiting date reference in third and fourth position, were printed in July, October, October, and December 1883 respectively.

Following this entry is the number of reams per volume, a figure which allows a determination of issue approximating: Moore 39¼/4 or 9.81 sheets ) 500 x 60 reams = 3060 copies Hemans 39/4 or 9.75 ) 500 x 60 = 3080 Burns 34/4 or 8.5 ) 500 x 70 = 4120 Coleridge 28½/4 or 7.1 ) 500 x 60 = 4225 At the same time these last volumes were issuing at Perth two others of a different order, published by Ward, Lock and Co., were being prepared some distance away — but again according to the formula as finally devised. One of these, Bret Harte's Two Men of Sandy Bar ( BAL 7490, 2d part), printed October 1883 by Unwin Brothers, Chilworth and London, may be described as: 1-12 8 1½-6-10-83-27x34-70-B13 Since the paper is still of quadruple size (the gathering measuring 6⅜ x 4" cut), the total issue would appear to be no less than 11,600. The other, Mark Twain's New Pilgrims' Progress (not listed, but 2d part of combined issue with BAL 3636), was in November 1883 printed for Ward, Lock by Billing and Sons, Guildford and London. [A] 16 B-K 16 3-10-11-83-27x34-46-C-13 As this is an octavo in 16s the sheet here would accommodate only two signatures, and total issue thus, it seems, is no more than 4600.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Writer's Best Solace: Textual Revisions in Ellen Glasgow's The Past by R. H. W. Dillard</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Halfway through her career, shortly after the publication of her tenth novel, Virginia , Ellen Glasgow wrote to her literary agent, Paul Revere Reynolds, that she could not interest herself in the writing of short stories: "The work is so tiresome that I'd rather not have the money they bring than try to write them." 1 Miss Glasgow had, indeed, expressed her dislike for the form as early as 1898, 2 but by 1916 and those years immediately following, although still complaining, 3 she was writing stories with some regularity—enough of them, in fact, to collect into a volume, The Shadowy Third and Other Stories , in 1923. Despite her misgivings about attempting the short story, Miss Glasgow wrote these stories with the same artistic integrity and seriousness with which she approached her novels. This seriousness, attested to by her many published expressions of a belief in the function of art as the servant of truth 4 and by her refusal to allow her work to appear in "the second rate magazines," 5 is most evident in her attitude toward revisions and in the care and extent of her revisions: "it is the act of scrupulous revision (the endless pruning and trimming for the sake of a valid and flexible prose style) that provides the writer's best solace even while it makes drudgery." 6 Perhaps because of her stated attitudes about revision and her repeated statement that she wrote her later novels in three drafts, 7 Miss Glasgow's claims to be a reviser have been casually accepted by her critics, but with no formal attempt at corroboration. William W. Kelly, in his introduction to Ellen Glasgow's "The Professional Instinct," found the corrections and revisions in the manuscript of that unpublished story to be minor, 8 and, aside from that brief introduction, there has been no other account of Miss Glasgow's techniques of revision. One of her short stories, "The Past," affords an excellent opportunity for an analysis of those techniques, for the changes in the story from its original appearance to its publication in The Shadowy Third are both extensive and significant. The story appeared originally in Good Housekeeping 9 and first appeared in its revised form in Walter J. O'Brien's The Best Short Stories of 1921 (1922). Whether Miss Glasgow revised the story specifically for O'Brien's collection or merely supplied him with the text she had revised for her collection of stories, The Shadowy Third and Other Stories (1923), cannot be ascertained, but the revised version is absolutely identical in both books and in its other three appearances in Dare's Gift (the English edition of The Shadowy Third , 1924), Edward Wagenknecht's The Fireside Book of Ghost Stories (1947), and Richard K. Meeker's edition of The Collected Stories of Ellen Glasgow (1963). Curiously, Richard K. Meeker, in his edition of The Collected Stories , says that "There are fewer changes in this story than in any other the author revised. She merely removed two unnecessary hyphens and added one necessary apostrophe." 10 Actually there are 190 changes in the story. Eighty-two of these are substantive, some as long as several paragraphs. The changes are of three general kinds: simple corrections and revisions of spelling and punctuation, single word changes for precision of meaning and texture, and larger revisions to heighten suspense and to increase the reader's awareness of the characters and the tensions between them. The simplest changes, those in spelling and punctuation, although extensive (108 changes), are relatively unimportant. The punctuation changes, except for those involved with a substantive change, are usually made for consistency—the substitution of semi-colons for commas, and commas for dashes. Substituting a comma or a dash for a period, she occasionally changed punctuation for rhythmic effect, a stylistic element with which she was particularly concerned. 11 The spelling changes reflect Miss Glasgow's preference for the English spellings of many words, a preference which Maxwell Perkins delicately described when writing to her about the Virginia Edition of her novels: "The style used in almost all of your books is a modified Oxford spelling which is by no means the extreme English spelling, altho' 'theater' ends in RE, and 'honor' ends in OUR." 12 In this story, among other changes, color becomes colour , story becomes storey , and gray becomes grey . Ellen Glasgow, who said that she had learned "the value of the precise word" from her reading of Maupassant early in her career, 13 always felt that "the search for the exact right word . . . is a perennial aspiration." 14 The word changes in this story are all in the direction of greater precision: light shone into a room rather than splashed , a rug is as soft as flowers rather than velvet turf , and the narrator feels an aversion for Mr. Vanderbridge's former wife upon first meeting her rather than an antagonism . Since the story is one of Miss Glasgow's ghost stories, highly influenced by Poe, texture is particularly important in the creation of effect, an effect in this instance of fear and unknowable horror. The narrator, Miss Wrenn, takes a position as personal secretary to Mrs. Vanderbridge in the story, and she finds the Vanderbridge home to be haunted by the ghost of Mr. Vanderbridge's first wife whom he cannot forget. Only Mrs. Vanderbridge and Miss Wrenn see the ghost who appears whenever Mr. Vanderbridge thinks of his former marriage. Miss Wrenn finds some love letters to the Other One (as they refer to the ghost) from another man, but Mrs. Vanderbridge will not use this discovery to disillusion her husband and, thus, rid them of the ghost. Rather, she burns the letters, releasing the Other One from a bondage of hate by her good action, and triumphing "not by resisting, but by accepting; not by violence, but by gentleness; not by grasping, but by renouncing. . . . She had changed the thought of the past, in that lay her victory" ( The Shadowy Third , p. 146). In a manner similar to Poe's use of the supernatural as a device for psychological revelation, Miss Glasgow's ghost is, then, the visible manifestation of Mr. Vanderbridge's obsessive attachment to the past. If Miss Glasgow's word changes help to maintain the necessary somber tone, they also function to clarify the meaning of the story. By the change of one word, emphasizing that the past rather than the ghost must be exorcized, at a point in the story when Miss Wrenn is first beginning to understand the relationship of the ghost with the past, Miss Glasgow made the psychological significance of the ghost, as well as the meaning of the story, clearer: Good Housekeeping This, I inferred, was the secret reason why my employer was sending the furniture away. She had resolved to clear the house of every association with the apparition. (p.162) The Shadowy Third This, I inferred, was the secret reason why my employer was sending the furniture away. She had resolved to clear the house of every association with the past. (p.138) The most important revisions in the story also have to do with the necessary business of making a fantastic story seem realistic and with the clarification of the characters and their relationships. To give the story a more realistic base, Miss Glasgow added several specific details which, although not necessary to the plot of the story, do aid in setting the supernatural events in a solid and real surrounding. The maid, who simply sits while talking to the narrator in the magazine version of the story, knits in the revision; Mrs. Vanderbridge, who has influenza in the magazine, speaks, in addition, in a hoarse voice in the revised story. Miss Glasgow also heightened the suspense by introducing Mrs. Vanderbridge's nervousness early in the story with an added sentence: "I saw her feet tap the white fur rug, while she plucked nervously at the lace on the end of one of the gold-coloured soft pillows" (pp. 109-110). Miss Glasgow added another extensive passage at a point in the story when the narrator, Mrs. Vanderbridge's secretary, finds a disintegrating wedding bouquet and the packet of love letters, which she mistakenly thinks were from Mr. Vanderbridge to his former wife, the present ghost. In the magazine, she carries them directly to Mrs. Vanderbridge; Ellen Glasgow both increased the suspense and emphasized Mrs. Vanderbridge's generous love with the addition of the passage in the revised version: As I left the room, carrying the letters and the ashes of the flowers, the idea of taking them to the husband instead of to the wife flashed through my mind. Then—I think it was some jealous feeling about the phantom that decided me—I quickened my steps to a run down the staircase. "They would bring her back. He would think of her more than ever," I told myself, "so he shall never see them if I can prevent it." I believe it occurred to me that Mrs. Vanderbridge would be generous enough to give them to him—she was capable of rising above her jealousy, I knew—but I determined that she shouldn't do it until I had reasoned it out with her. "If anything on earth would bring back the Other One for good, it would be his seeing these old letters," I repeated as I hastened down the hall. (p. 141) Throughout her career, Ellen Glasgow was plagued with the misunderstanding of her readers, a misunderstanding which is still much in evidence and, in one instance at the height of her career, was so aggravated that she was forced to add a sentence to The Sheltered Life two years after its publication to explain that Eva Birdsong had killed her husband, an act made abundantly clear by the imagery of the chapter. 15 In this story, too, Miss Glasgow felt that she needed to focus attention precisely on Mr. and Mrs. Vanderbridge and that she needed to explain them more fully. To narrow the focus, she removed extraneous characters and offered less direct information about the narrator. She disposed of a second butler by the simple device of using a passive construction in the second paragraph of the story: Good Housekeeping A second man in livery took my name, and when I explained that I was the new secretary, he delivered me into the charge of an elderly lady's-maid . . . (p. 64) The Shadowy Third When I gave my name and explained that I was the new secretary, I was delivered into the charge of an elderly lady's-maid . . . (p. 107) Not to over-characterize Miss Wrenn and also to avoid the appearance, early in the story, that the tension might lie between Mrs. Vanderbridge and the narrator, Miss Glasgow deleted a passage of conversation between the secretary and her employer, the only section of any length which she removed from the story: "I knew you were a perfect lady, of course," she added roguishly, "because if you weren't, Miss Matoaca wouldn't have given you a diploma for deportment, but I really didn't know you were so nice." "But I'm not. I'm as hard as nails under the surface." She seemed very young— more than a girl—and I knew that I should never again feel afraid of her. "But you won't be hard on me. You will do everything I ask you to," she said winningly. (p. 64) In addition to the elimination of characters or the diminution of their roles, Miss Glasgow added considerable material essential to the understanding of her two central characters, Mr. and Mrs. Vanderbridge. Mr. Vanderbridge, in particular, was treated very sketchily in the magazine version, so that Miss Glasgow added passages to enrich his characterization: He reminded me more than ever of the portrait in the loan collection, and though he was so much older than the Florentine nobleman, he had the same thoughtful look. Of course I am not an artist, but I have always tried, in my way, to be a reader of personality; and it didn't take a particularly keen observer to discern the character and intellect in Mr. Vanderbridge's face. (pp. 117-118) Despite a rather thorough account of Mrs. Vanderbridge's personality in the magazine, Miss Glasgow added several passages to characterize her further, for her good nature is especially essential to the resolution of the story. In one added passage, her maid speaks of her to the narrator: I had an operation a year ago, and since then Mrs. Vanderbridge has had another maid—a French one—to sit up for her at night and undress her. She is always so fearful of overtaxing us, though there isn't really enough work for two lady's-maids, because she is so thoughtful that she never gives any trouble if she can help it. (p. 124) Although "The Past" is a small and relatively insignificant example of Ellen Glasgow's fiction, the revisions it exhibits do reveal Miss Glasgow to have been the serious and careful reviser that she asserted. The minute changes in punctuation and spelling, the more important stylistic word changes, the very important changes in emphasis and the addition of necessary characterizing details, all show Miss Glasgow to have been conscious of her art and determined to develop it, even to have been willing to face the drudgery of revising her short stories, which she felt were her "least good work." 16 The revisions of this story, then, insofar as they are typical of the revisions in her larger work, are proof that Ellen Glasgow did indeed know "the writer's best solace," the continuing quest for the perfection of her art.</field>
