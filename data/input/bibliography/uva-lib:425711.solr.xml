      <field name="fulltext">I The theatre, it is frequently remarked, is always in a state of crisis. Controversy about the place of analytical bibliography in English studies, not to mention editorial conjectures and refutations, suggests that it has more in common with the drama than a concern for its texts. Even when all is well, bibliography, as David Gallup has said, "can hardly be recommended as an occupation for completely sane people." 1 , and for reasons beyond those he gives. Quite recently Peter Brook argued in an interview with the late James Mossman that the theatre is in crisis, not for any of the old and relatively superficial reasons — because money, or authors, or audiences were in short supply — but because it is no longer rooted in shared, common experience. One does not have to describe how, in many academic communities, there has been a weakening of 'shared understanding' of the nature and purposes of the academy. It is a time of disquiet when basic assumptions are being challenged and it would be surprising, and even alarming, if fundamental questions were not now being asked about the nature and practice of textual criticism. The most notable, and the most sustained, of these critiques is D. F. McKenzie's "Printers of the Mind: some notes on bibliographical theories and printing-house practices" which appeared in Studies in Bibliography in 1969, but McKenzie is not alone. The editors of the Ohio Browning have questioned the meanings of 'author' and 'text'; James Thorpe, the author of a distinguished essay on "The Aesthetics of Textual Criticism," has attacked what he regards as the scientific pretentions of bibliographers; 2 and of much longer standing, though almost unnoticed by bibliographers concerned with later English literature, George Thomson and George Kane have questioned the very foundation of the use of stemmatics in editing complex manuscript traditions. It could be that contemporary uncertainty is akin to those "Revolts, republics, revolutions" described by Tennyson in The Princess as "No graver than a schoolboys' barring-out;" but it is salutary to recall that The Princess was published only a year before The Communist Manifesto . The situation described by McKenzie and implied by the editors of the Ohio Browning is (if, risking Mr. Thorpe's displeasure, I might make a comparison with science) not unlike that defined earlier in the decade by Thomas S. Kuhn and called by him 'paradigm rejection.' 3 Received or normal science, he argues, often suppresses fundamental novelties because they are subversive of its basic commitments. [When scientists] can no longer evade anomalies that subvert the existing tradition of scientific practice — then begin the extraordinary investigations that lead the profession at last to a new set of commitments, a new basis for the practice of science (pp. 5 and 6). Thus, one set of traditions — one paradigm — is replaced by another: Copernican for Ptolomaic astronomy, Newtonian for Aristotelian dynamics. This scientific paradigm serves not for replication as does a grammatical paradigm (so that amo , amas , amat may be replicated as laudo , laudas , laudat ) but as "an object for further articulation and specification" (23). Thus the scientific paradigm is open-ended (10) and encourages the solution of puzzles within the terms of the paradigm. If these puzzles prove insoluble within the paradigm they become counterinstances which, when sufficiently significant , lead to the rejection of the paradigm. Are we faced in analytical bibliography with sufficiently serious counterinstances for us to reject our current paradigm? Kuhn's description of the moment of crisis for the scientist is instructive: Because it demands large-scale paradigm destruction and major shifts in the problems and techniques of normal science, the emergence of new theories is generally preceded by a period of pronounced professional insecurity. As one might expect, that insecurity is generated by the persistent failure of the puzzles of normal science to come out as they should. Failure of existing rules is the prelude to a search for new ones (67-8). If for 'normal science' one reads 'current bibliographic practice' it is possible to see why it might be true that we have encountered in recent months not just a moment of individual or passing uncertainty but a deeper and more serious crisis. In another respect there seems to be an analogy between McKenzie's response to what he regards as the inadequacy of current bibliographic practice and Kuhn's description of the effect of crisis on some scientists. Dr. McKenzie, it will be remembered, began by arguing that bibliographers must proceed by the hypothetico-deductive method. He pointed out, quite rightly, that our understanding of what went on in the Elizabethan printing house is based on limited evidence and hence assertions of normality must be tenuous. Then, basing what he said on his study of printing at Cambridge University Press between 1696 and 1712 and on the work of two eighteenth-century printers, Charles Ackers and William Bowyer, he considered such problems as workmen's output, edition sizes, and the relationship of composition to presswork. He then attacked current theories of compositors' measures, cast-off copy, skeleton formes, proof correction, and press figures. He argued that bibliographers ought to show a greater concern than they had for historical perspective and concluded by suggesting what seemed to some readers to be what was tantamount to a turning away from analytical bibliography: if our basic premise is that bibliography should serve literature or the criticism of literature, it may be thought to do this best, not by disappearing into its own minutiae, but by pursuing the study of printing history to the point where analysis can usefully begin, or by returning — and this is the paradox — to the more directly useful, if less sophisticated activity of enumerative 'bibliography'. 4 This is not dissimilar to the effect of crisis on scientists as Kuhn describes it: Though history is unlikely to record their names, some men have undoubtedly been driven to desert science because of their inability to tolerate crisis. Like artists, creative scientists must occasionally be able to live in a world out of joint — elsewhere I have described that necessity as "the essential tension" implicit in scientific research. But that rejection of science in favour of another occupation is, I think, the only sort of paradigm rejection to which counterinstances by themselves can lead (78-9). McKenzie's plea that bibliographers should be more modest in their claims and his preference for historical studies and enumerative bibliography over a proliferation of ill-founded theories is acceptable enough, but his article seems to me to reveal an unease that goes much deeper. It is not surprising that Robert Donaldson, reviewing what McKenzie had written, should say: It may be felt that this conclusion in particular [that men and work in the Elizabethan printing house were not 'so related as to produce the most economical work-flow geared to the printing of a single book'] and the entire article in general have injected so much uncertainty into the already complicated structures of analytical bibliography that it is no longer worth the time and concentration necessary to develop them. 5 McKenzie's strictures are salutary but not, I think, quite so devastating as to lead me to desert bibliography and the practice of editing because I cannot tolerate this crisis (to adapt Kuhn's words). I should like to comment on what McKenzie and Thorpe have to say and to discuss some of the points raised by the editors of the Ohio Browning. I shall try to suggest what seems to me the proper relationship of bibliography to science and what part the hypothetico-deductive method can play in textual studies. I shall endeavour to outline some of the considerations which a modern editor ought to bear in mind in his use of bibliography in the light of what may be a shift in the way in which we apprehend our world which could affect not only bibliography but studies of many kinds and, indeed, creative literature itself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II The likening of bibliography to science is understandable viewed in the context of English studies as a whole. The extent to which one can make objective literary critical pronouncements is limited and a technique that attempts to demonstrate something, however modest, which can be checked and agreed against tangible evidence, must seem not unlike a scientific demonstration to those unaccustomed to science and perhaps a trifle envious of it. This, of course, does not make bibliography scientific and a responsible editor (and a responsible reader) will bear in mind Fredson Bowers's words in Textual and Literary Criticism: I should prefer the taste and judgement of a Kittredge (wrong as he sometimes was), and of an Alexander, to the unskilled and therefore unscientific operation of a scientific method as if it were the whole answer to the problem and automatically relieved an editor of the necessity to use his critical judgement in any way (p.116). Nevertheless, as Bowers's quotation suggests, there is advanced by bibliographers a claim to operate a scientific method and there is no doubt that some bibliographers have deceived themselves into imagining that what they do is scientific. Editors can easily imagine that bibliography is a scientific tool. The desire for objectivity, the attempt to put back the moment of conjecture, the awesome achievements of science, have all contributed to this assumption. It would be surprising if bibliographers could entirely escape the influence of what is, in P. B. Medawar's words, "an immensely prosperous and successful enterprise." 6 And to those seeking objectivity, the scientific method — a scientific method — must have seemed the way ahead. It is, therefore, not difficult for James Thorpe to select seemingly definitive statements by the most distinguished textual critics — Housman, Greg, Bowers — which bluntly state that textual criticism (or bibliography) is a science. 7 La 'Pataphysique est la science . . . . But Thorpe's selection of quotations do less than justice to their authors. He himself indicates, in a passage included in a note (a device he justifies by explaining somewhat ingenuously that the passage originally appeared in one of Greg's footnotes: but when Greg made his comment it was a genuine aside, whereas it is central to Thorpe's argument) that by 1950 Greg had modified his claim made in 1932 for "the science of the transmission of literary documents" to the point that he would rather rely "upon the impression of a critic in whose judgement I feel confidence than in an accumulation of mechanical tests." 8 The quotations from Bowers are nearly all modified by the use of single quotes, and significantly in the two most recent passages Thorpe quotes (1959 and 1964) Bowers correctly qualifies scientific by the word 'more.' A fairer and more useful picture might have been presented had Thorpe quoted Bowers's expression of preference for the taste of a Kittredge or an Alexander. The most striking discrepancy between utterance and quotation is to be found in the use made of Housman. Thorpe writes: A.E. Housman, a classical scholar with very nearly absolute confidence in his own authority, was careful to describe his work as being "within scientific bounds"; he could join the dominion of science and the power of that other great term of honor, "art," in his definition: "Textual criticism is a science, and, since it comprises recension and emendation, it is also an art. It is the science of discovering error in texts and the art of removing it. That is its definition, that is what the name denotes ." The hitching of these two stars to the bibliographical wagon has also been a frequent exercise in English studies, though one hopes that it is a practice more of the past than of the future. 9 Before going on to disappoint Thorpe's hopes, I would make one or two points about the selection of this quotation. First, this is not all Housman said. Immediately after stating what the name denoted — that is, in the very next sentence — Housman wrote: "But I must also say something about what it does and does not connote , what attributes it does and does not imply; because here also there are false impressions abroad." Housman went on to state, quite categorically: "Textual criticism is not a branch of mathematics, nor indeed an exact science at all." Rather than quote selectively in order to support such an argument, it might have been more profitable to have considered why scholars of no mean distinction should have presented this apparent paradox. Might not Housman, a textual critic and creative writer of considerable insight, be more sensitive to the relationship of textual criticism to science and art than Mr Thorpe's strictures suggest? Earlier I quoted P. B. Medawar. I should now like to continue that quotation: Science is an immensely prosperous and successful enterprise — as religion is not, nor economics (for example), nor philosophy itself — because it is the outcome of applying a certain sure and powerful method of discovery and proof to the investigation of natural phenomena. 10 Now it will be apparent (as Medawar himself indicates) that philosophy, history, and literature are not natural phenomena. The part played by nature and art (or artifice) in the creative arts has been argued since Pindar, but the materials upon which bibliographers work are clearly to be distinguished from natural phenomena. In this most important sense, bibliography cannot be scientific. But, for all that, it is in certain important respects, of science. I disagree most with Thorpe when he says he "can see nothing in the present or future of textual criticism, however it is carried on, which will make it answerable to the term 'science' or 'scientific'" (pp. 18-19). It is not difficult to find in the writings of as distinguished a scientist as P. B. Medawar a description of the scientist which, in its generalized form, applies with equal validity to the textual critic: A scientist is a man who has cultivated (if indeed he was not born with) the restless, analytical, problem-seeking, problem-solving temperament that marks his possession of a Scientific Mind ( Art of the Soluble , p. 147). In his essay "Two Conceptions of Science" in the same volume, Medawar discusses what seem to some people alternative, or even competing, accounts of that process which he argues as being "two successive and complementary episodes of thought that occur in every advance of scientific understanding" (p. 133). In the romantic conception, truth takes shape in the mind of the observer: it is his imaginative grasp of what might be true that provides the incentive for finding out, so far as he can, what is true. Every advance in science is therefore the outcome of a speculative adventure, an excursion into the unknown. According to the opposite view, truth resides in nature and is to be got at only through the evidence of the senses: apprehension leads by a direct pathway to comprehension, and the scientist's task is essentially one of discernment . This act of discernment can be carried out according to a Method which, though imagination can help it, does not depend on the imagination: the Scientific Method will see him through. (Here he refers to K. R. Popper's critical analysis, "On the Sources of Knowledge and of Ignorance," in Conjectures and Refutations (1963), for the conception that truth is manifest .) Inasmuch as these two sets of opinions contradict each other flatly in every particular, it seems hardly possible that they should both be true; but anyone who has actually done or reflected deeply upon scientific research knows that there is in fact a great deal of truth in both of them. For a scientist must indeed be freely imaginative and yet sceptical, creative and yet a critic. There is a sense in which he must be free, but another in which his thought must be very precisely regimented; there is poetry in science, but also a lot of bookkeeping ( The Art of the Soluble , pp. 132-133). All this strikes me as relevant to bibliography and the work of bibliographers. It is also (although I shall come to this later) an interesting passing comment on McKenzie's insistence on the hypothetico-deductive method, which seems to demand regimentation and book-keeping and to ignore imagination, creativity, and poetry. But Medawar also presents the contrary case. In his introductory essay to the whole collection of essays, The Art of the Soluble , he quotes from Arthur Koestler's The Act of Creation , which he had reviewed: No scientist is admired for failing in the attempt to solve problems that lie beyond his competence. The most he can hope for is the kindly contempt earned by the Utopian politician. If politics is the art of the possible, research is surely the art of the soluble. Both are immensely practical-minded affairs (p. 11). "Good scientists," Medawar goes on, "study the most important problems they think they can solve." Whether this is so or not, it is very different from the situation that faces the textual critic. Later in this collection of essays Medawar quotes from Introduction à l'Étude de la Médécin Expérimentale by Claude Bernard: 11 "if one proposes a hypothesis which experience cannot verify, one abandons the experimental method." Hypotheses must be of a kind that can be tested, says Medawar, following Bernard, and "one should go out of one's way to find means of refuting them" (p. 171). This accords exactly with the position taken up by McKenzie and it is not surprising, and perfectly logical, that McKenzie should argue, as Medawar does for scientists, that bibliographers "should normally proceed" by the hypothetico-deductive method which, whilst welcoming conjecture, yet faced with "but one piece of negative evidence, one contradictory occurrence" will conclusively falsify that hypothesis. 12 What McKenzie regards as normal he does not state, though the tone and rigour of his approach is such that it is difficult to conceive of abnormalities acceptable to him. McKenzie is of course right to protest at the use of unexamined evidence. But, and it is a very significant 'but,' if science is concerned with the soluble, and the hypothetico-deductive method is its Method (even if, as Medawar correctly puts it, "rightness" that lies beyond the possibility of future criticism cannot be achieved by any scientific theory' 13 ) is this applicable to textual criticism? Is textual criticism only concerned with the soluble in the sense that Bernard and Medawar imply? I think not. Kuhn states that "with scientific observation . . . the scientist can have no recourse above or beyond what he sees with his eyes and his instruments" (p. 113); can the textual critic be so limited? Must he not, by the very nature of his subject, venture beyond what is before his eyes? Can the relationship of the texts of Hamlet be verified by experience? Can the lost manuscripts that underlie those we have of the Oresteia or of the Epistles of St. Paul be restored and tested in a way that is scientifically acceptable? The answer must be 'No.' But the non-scientific nature of the problem is even more striking in those cases where we may have most, or even all, the texts. Can we scientifically demonstrate an edition of The Prelude — an ideal text of the kind, say, proposed by De Sélincourt? 14 Will hypothetico-deductive reasoning and tests for falsification produce a text for Murder in the Cathedral , complicated as it is by conflicting authorial versions? 15 Will we not in these cases have to go beyond what we can see with eyes and instruments? Contradictory occurrences are so prolific in these texts that the temptation to turn to enumerative bibliography is very strong. 16 But is not the temptation to run away based on a misunderstanding of the nature of bibliographic studies? Scientific research may be based solely on the art of the soluble but it should be obvious that bibliography poses problems that are not soluble in the Bernard-Medawar sense. It is not inferior because of that: but it is different. McKenzie seems to be implying that although bibliography is not a science, a specific scientific method — the hypothetico-deductive method — is essential to bibliographic studies and, where it cannot be applied, these studies should not be pursued. (There is here, I think, a discrepancy between his opening in which, among other things, he seems to accept Bald's conclusion that bibliography cannot claim the same validity as is appropriate to the exact sciences (pp. 2-3) and the tenor and conclusion of most of what follows.) Furthermore, McKenzie, in his advocacy of the hypothetico-deductive method seems under the impression that there is a scientific method, and that this is it and, indeed that science itself is all of one kind. Medawar has argued, far more authoritatively than can I, how erroneous it is to imagine that there is any such thing as a Scientific Method. There is no such thing as a Scientific Method . Scientists are people of very dissimilar temperaments doing different things in different ways. Among scientists are collectors, classifiers, and compulsive tidiers-up; many are detectives by temperament and many are explorers; some are artists and some are artisans. There are poet-scientists and philosopher-scientists and even a few mystics. What sort of mind or temperament can all these people be supposed to have in common? . . . . There is no such thing as The Scientific Method — as the scientific method, that is the point: there is no one rounded art or system of rules which stands to its subject-matter as logical syntax stands towards any particular instance of reasoning by deduction. 'An art of discovery is not possible,' wrote a former Master of Trinity; 'we can give no rules for the pursuit of truth which shall be universally and peremptorily applicable' ( The Art of the Soluble , p. 148). Pointing out the manifold errors of our colleagues, salutary though it is for them, does not, of itself, demonstrate the efficacy of the hypothetico-deductive method. McKenzie's strictures point to no more than the invalidity of specific arguments and they have less to do with general principles than he, or those such as the reviewer of his paper in the T.L.S. , 22nd May 1969, imagine. Perhaps I might take an editorial problem, where all the evidence is available, and apply the hypothetico-deductive method. I have chosen an instance in which the editor is demonstrably wrong, in which the problem is delightfully simple, in which 'the Method' (McKenzie will be our Stanislavsky) proves sterile, and in which, in the end, depends for an answer on the editor's taste and judgement. The problem concerns the notes to be played by the timpani in two places in Bizet's Symphony in C. I refer to the Edition Eulenburg, edited by Hans-Hubert Schönzeler; it is undated but the Editorial Comment is signed from London, June 1961. The text is in English and German and I refer only to the former. The editor makes what to most contemporary textual critics will seem a curious statement about his editorial procedure: This present edition of Bizet's "Symphony in C" was compiled from two of the existing printed scores, namely those of Choudens (Paris) and Philharmonia (New York). Discrepancies occurring in these editions were compared with the autograph score . . . . so that this present edition follows the autograph in all details (page v). Are we to assume that the autograph was only looked at when there was a discrepancy between Choudens and Philharmonia? What standing have these editions? Will this procedure result in the Eulenburg edition following the autograph in all details — surely not? Later in the Editorial Comment the editor refers to the special problem posed by the timpani part. Choudens and Philharmonia vary widely from the autograph and the editor has "as in all other respects," considered the autograph as final. The timpani stand in G and C throughout the first and last movements as well as in the trio of the Scherzo; in the main section of the Scherzo they stand in D and A, and only in the second movement is there a change in the tuning — at the beginning of the movement they stand in G and C changing to A and E at No 5 (pg. 113). Any deviation from these tunings , therefore, is arbitrary and not in accordance with the composer's autograph . (The italics are mine.) There appears, however, to be "a mistake on Bizet's part in the first movement." The autograph unmistakably shows that the timpani are to play D two bars before No 5 and in the fourth and fifth bars after No 6. The editor concludes: "As it has always been the policy of Edition Eulenburg to adhere to the letter of the autograph, these doubtful timpani notes have also been retained in the present score." Quite apart from what, in the retention of what the editor himself describes as a mistake, amounts to an abrogation of the editorial function, is this, in fact, what happens? Two bars before figure five they are certainly given D to play in the Edition Eulenburg. As the cellos, basses, and horns are all playing concert D, it is possible that, if the timpani is to play, it should be D, in which case there is no mistake — though retuning would be necessary. But it could be we have here our old friend, "attraction to a word or letter previously copied." 16a However, at the fourth and fifth bars after figure six, where in the autograph the "notes unmistakably are D," we find that the timpanist is given C to play (as in the second and third bars). Here also the cellos, basses and horns play concert D for all four bars and it could be that a discord is intended — and is required before figure five also. Clearly the editor has not done what he said he would do (even if that is what he should have done). Obviously D should not appear in one of these places and C at another — but which note ought the timpani to be playing, D or C? Will the hypothetico-deductive method help? I doubt it. If one hypothesises C it can be argued that the autograph clearly has D, and that is certainly "one contradictory occurrence;" if one hypothesises D, one can argue that the part is clearly marked in C and G and there is no indication "muta in D." 17 If one hypothesised that the notes should not be played at all, apart from the fact that notes are written down, one would have to explain the appearance of notes in the second and third bars after figure six. (From five onwards there is a reduction from ff to f which might account for the cessation of the timpani at the sixth bar). Both notes played simultaneously is possible but extremely unlikely — and that, too, would require retuning. A variety of hypotheses can be advanced but, even though we have a holograph, none can be 'proved true.' Now this is not to suggest that the hypothetico-deductive method is without its uses here. It can help us to discriminate between hypotheses, but it cannot itself provide an answer. It may be that the deliberately heavy weather I have made of this little crux will illustrate the limitations of the application to humanistic problems of a technique appropriate to science or logic. Demonstrating Schönzeler's error (as McKenzie has done for many of our colleagues) will not itself solve the crux. Suggesting that the hypothetico-deductive method is negative rather than positive certainly does not mean that bibliographers and editors can throw logic to the winds. McKenzie's strictures are necessary: but they must be seen in proportion. In practice editors, or those acting in that capacity, have to provide answers even if evidence is insufficient or contradictory. Thus, to remain in the sphere of music, Ansermet, Karajan, and Munch include the trumpet fanfares which Debussy omitted from the second edition of La Mer because he was hurt by the suggestion that they were reminiscent of those in Puccini's Manon Lescaut . Some conductors, including Toscanini and Bernstein, follow the second edition. Which approach is truer to the music? If one adopts the composer's second thoughts as being, after all, his final (even if mistaken) decision, how will one be placed in presenting Bruckner's Second Symphony at the point the composer substituted a clarinet for a horn solo, though there is no doubt the horn is much more effective — especially if it is correct that the substitution was only made because at the rehearsal for the first performance the horn player could not manage his solo? It is not responsible, if one cannot 'prove' a solution in such cases, to turn to enumerative bibliography. That will hardly serve the best interests of the music — which is surely its performance. It is sometimes argued that if an editor provides all the evidence, as the editors of the Ohio Browning set out to do, the reader can be left to make decisions for himself. It does not matter greatly, it can be argued, which text is given 'above the line' provided that, below it, a full register of variants is supplied. Quite apart from the effect that differences of typography between main text and notes have on the reader, the invalidity of this argument is at once apparent if performance is involved. One cannot perform simultaneously several variant readings of music or a play without doing serious damage to the author's creation. (A note omitted in one version and replaced by a rest but included in another version would present a particularly intriguing problem in such simultaneous performance!) The duty of an editor can surely not be less than that of a conductor or a producer and he ought to be in a much better position to make a judgement. If the hypothetico-deductive approach cannot solve this little crux in Bizet, how will it resolve the problems posed by Piers Plowman , or Hamlet , or even Murder in the Cathedral , where we have all the evidence? The short answer is that it cannot be more than a useful tool which may help us avoid the avoidable. Thus, in practice, one often has to choose between various courses, none wholly satisfactory, and the hypothetico-deductive method is a convenient means of testing the choices open to an editor, helping him to decide to which choice he should give preference. I am not implying a weakness in the hypothetico-deductive method but simply pointing to its relative inadequacy in dealing with the insoluble — that is in a field for which it is not designed. Thomas Kuhn, however, does argue that the hypothetico-deductive method is limited in use in scientific research itself. He concludes that "If any and every failure to fit were ground for theory rejection, all theories ought to be rejected at all times." It is the very "incompleteness and imperfection of the existing data-theory fit that, at any time, define many of the puzzles that characterize normal science." If only severe failure to fit justifies theory rejection, then the Popperians will require some criterion of "improbability" or of a "degree of falsification." In developing one they will almost certainly encounter the same network of difficulties that has haunted the advocates of the various probabilistic verification theories (pp. 145-146). It is, of course, verification theories that appeal most to bibliographers (and least to Dr. McKenzie) and especially that aspect of verification that asks, in Kuhn's words, "not whether a theory has been verified but rather about its probability in the light of the evidence that actually exists" (144). Later he argues: Verification is like natural selection: it picks out the most viable among the actual alternatives in a particular historical situation. Whether that choice is the best that could have been made if still other alternatives had been available or if the data had been of another sort is not a question that can usefully be asked (pp. 145). The best procedure, as I see it, in the practical dealing with texts, is a combination of probabilistic theory and falsification tests, endeavouring, where the hard evidence permits, to ensuring that this is subjected to a process of rigorous logic and being fully conscious of the moment when one is departing from the demonstrable and falsifiable, and into the realm of the subjective and unverifiable. One cannot, as a bibliographer, avoid sharing a certain fellow feeling with Bishop Butler when he says in the Introduction to The Analogy of Religion (1736), "but to us , probability is the very guide of life." If this seems inappropriate — perhaps even immoral — in so scientific an age, it might be worth noting that this is a position akin to that adopted by the great physicist Werner Heisenberg, the author of "The Principle of Uncertainty:" In the practical decisions of life it will scarcely ever be possible to go through all the arguments in favour of or against one possible decision, and one will therefore always have to act on insufficient evidence. . . . Even the most important decisions in life must always contain the inevitable element of irrationality. The decision itself is necessary, since there must be something to rely upon, some principle to guide our actions. 18 That describes, for me, exactly the position in which a bibliographer and an editor is likely to find himself. It does not mean logic can be disregarded; it does not licence woolliness; but it does recognize the realities of bibliography and editing in a way which, with all respect to Dr. McKenzie's learning, I think he fails to do.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III I should now like to consider the larger matter of which McKenzie's and Thorpe's arguments may be symptomatic: the possibility that the current paradigm in bibliographic studies is no longer acceptable. They are not alone in expressing dissatisfaction with conventional bibliographic and editorial practices. The editors of The Complete Works of Robert Browning 19 reject the conventional meanings of 'text' and 'author' and argue that punctuational changes ought not to be differentiated from substantival variants, or, to put it in their own language: An accidental, we maintain, is a variant that cannot alter the semantic function of the semiotic data. . . . . Punctuation, under which we include paragraphing, does not merely affect the semantic continuum; it is part of that continuum (p. ix). I have always taught that substantive variations may include punctuation. Thus, in The Dutch Courtesan , the 1605 corrected Quarto reads: I must haue the Sammon to, worship: Cocledemoy , now . . . . (The uncorrected quarto reads "to worship;") Martin Wine, in the Regents edition, 1965, takes this to mean: I must have the salmon to worship. Cocledemoy, now . . . . The Fountainwell edition, 1968, which rather unsatisfactorily partially modernizes (so 'to' means 'too') reads: I must have the Sammon to. Worshipful Cocledemoy , now . . . . Whatever the correct reading (and as that is not my concern here, reference should be made to the arguments in the respective editions), punctuation certainly affects meaning and the effect is substantival. The reader of Marlowe will not need reminding of the substantival effect on Edward II of an unpointed line: there was nothing accidental about Young Mortimer's omission. But even if one accepts such punctuational variants as substantival, this is not an open invitation to include all accidental variants as substantives. Even if the argument of a continuum is acceptable (and the word is overused by the Ohio editors, being applied to authorial, editorial, and semantic functions), if given effect it means readers will be faced with a welter of variants, from which, even when presented with the typographic elegance of this edition, it is extremely difficult to distinguish the significant from the insignificant. But, more seriously, are not the Ohio editors abrogating their editorial duty even if these poems do not, like music or a play, have to be performed? Can editorial responsibility be argued away by a continuum of semantic niceties (or, perhaps, by an anxiety to avoid assuming god-like pretentions)? The Ohio editors are right, I think, to be uneasy about the conventional meanings of 'text' and 'author', and they are very properly much alive to the significance of the least comma in Browning's work. Nevertheless, their analysis of the problem posed is confused and their solution is unsatisfactory. One senses, perhaps unfairly, that, having decided to abandon the variorum edition originally advertised, they settled on a policy of reprinting the final edition published in Browning's lifetime, supporting it with a register of all variants known to them, and that they then looked round for a policy to justify this procedure. The choice of such a text is unhappily reminiscent of a practice castigated by Housman in the preface to his Juvenal , 1905: A critic therefore, when he employs this method of trusting the best MS., employs it in the same spirit of gloomy resignation with which a man lies down on a stretcher when he has broken both his legs. But far other is the spirit in which it is hailed by the reciter of formulas. He is not dejected by its inadequacy, but captivated by its ease. 'Here', says he 'is a method, sanctioned by critics, employed in scientific enquiry, and yet involving not the slightest expenditure of intellectual effort: this is the method for me'; and he espouses it for ever. 20 We seem, indeed, to be back with the idea of a codex optimus and one feels that in the Ohio Browning inadequate attention has been paid to the readings of all the significant editions at the points at which they diverge. 21 On top of that there is a failure to differentiate between the authorial and editorial functions. In: there is no logical difference between an author's exercise of the editorial function and an editor's, who is also an unstable and continuously innovating continuum, but whose editorial function is precisely the same as the author's (viii) and: other individuals also exercise the editorial function: the compositor, the printer, and the copyreader (ix) (to which one could add friends such as Joseph Milsand (xii)), there is surely far more confusion than discrimination. What the logic of their argument for a continuum demanded was a genetic text like that produced by Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts Jr. of Billy Budd in 1962. There is, of course, no reason why editors should have to produce a variorum, a critical, or a genetic edition if none of these will serve their purpose, but what the Ohio editors have produced is not, I think, the happiest solution to their problem. Nevertheless, criticism about the way the Ohio editors interpret 'text' and 'editor' should not lead us to assume that the conventional meanings are without problems. The Ohio editors have touched on a matter of some concern. E.A.J. Honigmann has recently argued against the idea that there is but a single version of a Shakespearean text: I envisage, in short, two copies of a play, each in the author's hand, disagreeing in both substantive and indifferent readings: the play being regarded as 'finished' by Shakespeare in each version though not therefore beyond the reach of afterthoughts. Manuscript copies of their own works by at least one contemporary of Shakespeare and by many later writers reveal precisely the textual instability which I postulate, especially when written out shortly after their original composition (as, one imagines, Shakespeare's 'fair copies' would be too). In rejecting the notion of a finalised text I picture, then, not so much a fastidious author's determined attempts to improve passages that fail to satisfy as an author so unconceited with himself and so fluent that little verbal changes, not necessarily always for the better, ran quite freely from his pen when the process of copying refired his mind. 22 This is surely correct and not only for Shakespeare, as Honigmann shows. The sort of problem this poses for an editor may be represented by extracts from the 1869 and 1875 editions of Culture and Anarchy and J. Dover Wilson's treatment of one of these passages in his edition of 1932. These changes were made by Arnold himself, in order, Dover Wilson suggests, to suppress or tone down personal allusions or because the allusions were no longer topical. Whilst the two readings are not the result of the kind of instability Honigmann describes, the problem facing the editor is similar. As Dover Wilson prints the text it appears at one point as: we imagine we are delivering ourselves up captive to the ideas and wishes of our fierce aristocratical baronet Sir Thomas Bateson; if with the middle class in occupation of the executive government, to those of our truculent middle-class Dissenting minister, the Rev. W. Cattle; if with the working class, to those of its notorious tribune, Mr. Bradlaugh. In the notes to this passage 23 Dover Wilson explains: ed. 1 reads these names alone, ed. 2 suppresses the first two and reads instead, "our fierce aristocratic baronet . . . our truculent middle-class Dissenting minister . . . its notorious tribune, Mr. Bradlaugh." The names "Elcho," "Bateson" and "Cattle" are similarly suppressed in later passages of the book, and it is unnecessary to record instances. Dover Wilson therefore gives us a version which Arnold never authorised in this form. Whether it is acceptable is another matter; it is certainly convenient but obviously it can only work if the words changed are complementary — one cannot have the notes C and D simultaneously in the Bizet example, it will be recalled. Honigmann's solution, which is no more in accord with the hypothetico-deductive approach than is Dover Wilson's, is quite different: the editor must screw his courage to the sticking place and choose between each pair of variants. In short, he must discard the labour-saving idea of 'indifferent' variants, recognising at the same time that to attempt a feat left undone by Shakespeare, to finalise an unfinished text, will create a version that never existed in the author's hand (p. 168).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV The problem is much more difficult in the case of such works as Piers Plowman, The Prelude , and Murder in the Cathedral . These all challenge very strongly the concept of a single but lost text which the editor must seek to restore. This has implications of considerable importance for all textual critics and especially for those who can take their work no further back than an archetype which may be several removes from the author's original, which, of course, may not have ever existed in a single finalised form. Indeed, even if there is an absence of contamination, I am inclined to doubt how securely one can go back beyond the exclusive common ancestor (or hyparchetype). It seems to me increasingly doubtful to what extent one can relate one exclusive common ancestor to another in order to find their common ancestor (or archetype). The existence of more than one finalised text of so many works must make one wonder whether the various exclusive common ancestors do not descend from stages of these and that one is setting about doing what Dover Wilson has done with Culture and Anarchy — but at several removes and unaware that it is this kind of problem that one is tackling. Even in what might at first sight seem to be the most certain cases of single-text sources — private letters written before the age of the typewriter and carbon paper — we can be deceived. Many examples spring to mind, but one will suffice. Thomas More's letter to Henry VIII of 5th March 1534 also exists, as George F. Warner notes, "in More's hand with a few verbal differences, in the Public Record Office" as well as in the British Museum, the version he reproduces. 24 And, of course, letters might be copied after the author's death. Drake's letter to John Foxe included in a recent collection 25 is dated about 1615 by the editors and is most certainly not in its author's hand. To what extent do, say, the letters of St Paul go back to versions made, even by their author (or authors) for communities other than those to which they were specifically addressed? In no way is the paradigm accepted by textual critics more seriously in question than that of the modern theory of stemmatics. The nature of this acceptance is to be seen in the approval given to Paul Maas's Textual Criticism . 26 Fredson Bowers begins his Bibliography and Textual Criticism by remarking: "The general procedures of textual criticism as it deals with manuscript study have been formulated for some years." There is then appended in a footnote: "The most convenient summary of the principles for dealing with manuscript texts is Paul Maas, Textual Criticism ." Bowers goes on to suggest that the editor of a classical or medieval text "can attack the problem from a position of strength" and he concludes his paragraph by saying: Moreover, he can hopefully anticipate that if he follows these traditional methods for sorting out and arranging his texts, he will be left with few cruxes that cannot be solved by linguistic skill and ripe critical judgement. 27 These traditional methods do not, however, receive universal approval. H. J. Chaytor (who does not mention Maas) summarizing the work of Bedier, Dom Quentin, et al. , in 1945 said: the modern editor has abandoned the ideal of 'reconstructing the archetype.' There are no fixed rules of procedure which he can follow. The number of MSS at his disposal, the amount of agreement or disagreement between them, the competence of their copyists, the effect of dialectal differences between the copyists, the possibility of piracy producing divergent imitations, these and other considerations oblige an editor to regard each case as a special case. 28 Earlier he had argued that a genealogy required that the approximate dates of the manuscripts must be established and went on: the comparison between the genealogist and the editor is in the nature of a false analogy. The genealogist is concerned only to show a male line of descent; females are excluded, except for a bare mention of their marriages. In the male line, branches can be represented as divergent, but if female lines were represented in no less detail, convergence would be possible, other aberrations might result, and the genealogical tree would become a confusion rather resembling a bramble-bush (p. 149). And L. D. Reynolds and N. G. Wilson also point to the limitations of the stemmatic method: it has become increasingly evident as scholars have pursued more detailed inquiries that the tradition of many texts, including some of the highest interest and importance, cannot be elucidated by the application of the stemmatic theory. In these cases the manuscripts cannot be assigned to classes or families characterized by groups of errors because there has been contamination or 'horizontal' transmission (p. 143). The crucial weakness of the stemmatic method is, of course, its inability to deal with texts suffering from contamination. Maas certainly mentions contamination, stating quite clearly (paragraph 6) that his method is based on the assumption "that the copies made since the primary split in the tradition each reproduce one exemplar only, i.e. that no scribe has combined several exemplars ( contaminatio )." And in paragraph 10 he states that if contamination has occurred, eliminatio "is greatly hindered, if not made impossible." And in the very last sentence (before the retrospect of 1956 which does not mention contamination) he states: "No specific has yet been discovered against contamination." There seems little doubt that contamination was extensive in classical, Biblical, and medieval texts. Kane found that so much convergent variation had taken place in the A manuscripts of Piers Plowman that random groupings were extremely numerous and that it was difficult, if not impossible to show the whole genetic relationship of these manuscripts. Among the authorities he quotes, one is of particular interest in connexion with what I have to say about textual studies, science, and the rejection of paradigms. 29 According to E. Vinaver, writing in 1939: Recent studies in textual criticism mark the end of an age-long tradition. The ingenious technique of editing evolved by the great masters of the nineteenth century has become as obsolete as Newton's physics, and the work of generations of critics has lost a good deal of its value. It is no longer possible to classify manuscripts on the basis of "common errors"; genealogical "stemmata" have fallen into discredit, and with them has vanished our faith in composite critical texts. As a gesture to Mr. Thorpe, perhaps I should not omit the last sentence Kane quotes from Vinaver: "Nothing has done more to raise textual criticism to the position of a science than the realisation of the inadequacy of the old methods of editing." 30 In recent years some of those of us in the Departments of Greek, Theology, and English in the University of Birmingham who are interested in textual studies 31 have organised a joint seminar for our undergraduates to enable them to gain some insight into kinds of textual problems that they would not normally encounter in their main subjects. It is a modest enough scheme but it includes some account of problems presented by Aeschylus, the New Testament, the early Christian fathers, Piers Plowman , Elizabethan texts, The Prelude , and one or two modern authors such as Joyce and Eliot. What has proved most striking to those of us conducting the seminars has been the unanimity with which, quite independently, we have come to the conclusion that, because of contamination, the stemmatic approach is only of limited use — and then, as Kane suggests, often in a negative fashion: The support of a genetic group is equivalent to the support of the single manuscript which is their hypothetical exclusive common ancestor. Therefore, even having regard to the qualified value of genetic evidence in the case of the A manuscripts, the term majority is not to be simply understood. 32 In this area of textual studies it does seem that the old paradigm, represented by Maas's Textual Criticism , is no longer acceptable and one must evolve a new approach. For Thomson this has centred on the classification of errors. 33 This is closely related to "the identification of typical scribal substitutions" which, in Kane's view, "is, in default of recension, the main resource of the editor of these manuscripts." Kane's aim is "to establish presumption of originality among available readings, or, less often, to reconstruct the original reading from the variants." 34 Kane's method may be illustrated from this example: II 182 Wysshen hym &amp; wypide him &amp; wounde hym in cloclo isis cloclo isis] cloutes VHJWNM; clott es E At first sight it might seem that cloutes in the sense of 'clothes' ( NED Clout sb. 1 4b) was the original, and that clo clo is is was substituted as an easier synonym. But scribes might have taken an original cloutes in the more general sense of 'rags, shreds', and preferring to interpret the allegory as signifying that pardoners dressed Liar up in fine style, altered their copy to clo clo is is . Or, on the other hand, precisely this may have been the sense of an original reading clo clo is is , and scribes may have thoughtlessly expressed their antipathy to pardoners and to Liar by dressing him in rags like a beggar. This would be in accordance with the scribal tendency to increase emphasis, a consideration that weighs against the slight preponderance of manuscript evidence in favour of cloutes (pp. 152-153). It will be apparent that such an approach is hardly likely to stand up to a Popperian falsification test; nor may it be verified, except subjectively. Its appeal can only be on the grounds of probability: that one hypothesis is, in the light of the knowledge of the text, language, literature, and ideas of the period, and of the scribes' involvement in what they were doing, less unacceptable than another hypothesis. The hypothetico-deductive method can play a part in discriminating between hypotheses, but ultimately, as Bowers puts it, one has to prefer the taste of a Kittredge, an Alexander, or, in this case, a Kane, to a quasi-systematic, quasi-objective approach. The one element that Kane seems to take too little into account (in the light of what Honigmann has since written on the stability of texts) is the possibility of there being more than one authorial reading. This seems at least a possibility in the case of the example just quoted. Kane states that in Piers Plowman A he knows of no instance when it can be shown conclusively that because of authorial revision several variants are original (p. 147 fn 2). Of course, it cannot be shown conclusively: but then neither can Kane's editorial procedure prove it conclusively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V This brief account of Kane's approach, and the discussion that led to it, may have indicated not only how the old paradigm has given way to a new one in English textual studies but that in a limited way the experience of the old paradigm can be put to use, if in a very different manner from that originally intended (I refer to Kane's use of groups of manuscripts, not to create a tree but to limit support for a reading to the exclusive common ancestor of the group). But it is in that area of textual studies more generally called bibliography that McKenzie launched his attack. Is the current paradigm generally unacceptable here? 35 Have the puzzles become anomalies? The short answer, so far as I am concerned, is that I do not know. I suspect that the answer is 'no,' or rather 'not quite yet.' Nevertheless I feel concerned enough at the possibility of a shift in our paradigm to prepare the students I teach not only to understand current bibliographic practice but to try to prepare them to respond to a new paradigm. Of the need for there to be a paradigm, even if its validity is uncertain, I am convinced. A paradigm does not need to be wholly successful: Paradigms gain their status because they are more successful than their competitors in solving a few problems that the group of practitioners has come to recognize as acute. To be more successful is not, however, to be either completely successful with a single problem or notably successful with any large number. 36 The most striking example I know of the need being felt for a paradigm when it seems inadequate is in Herman Bondi's response to Heinrich Olbers's paradox that the sky at night, though apparently dark, ought to be light. My concern is not with this paradox but in Bondi's response. 37 Bondi showed that all Olbers's conclusions followed from his assumptions and he then argued that in consequence one of the assumptions must be wrong. Which he chose and why need not trouble us. What is of interest in this context is what Bondi accepted: that the known laws of terrestrial physics (i.e. the paradigm) must apply. To Bondi that assumption could not be usefully rejected since the system of terrestrial physics was all that was known and to abandon it required giving up the whole inquiry. A passage in Bowers's Bibliography and Textual Criticism is relevant here: That the working hypotheses of physics are occasionally modified in various serious respects does not mean that physics as a science, and its method, should be replaced by unmethodical speculation. So with bibliography. New discoveries extend our knowledge, modify our concepts but seldom show that everything that has been believed is dead wrong. Thus bibliography joins with science in requiring the assumption of normality as the basis for any working hypothesis. Any working hypothesis, in turn, is taken as leading only to provisional truth, but a truth strong enough to serve as the basis for critical decision. When a hypothesis will no longer work, then we are automatically forced to a more comprehensive and extended working hypothesis, and our understanding of truth is enlarged, even though only provisionally, and our scholarly techniques are refined (p. 74). It is characteristic of scholars that before taking decisions they require to have "all the evidence." It is this that especially distinguishes the scholar in the pursuit of his studies from the man who must base his decisions upon calculated risk. The bibliographer's and the editor's dilemma is that temperamentally he will think as a scholar but in his actions he will, in Werner Heisenberg's words, "always have to act on insufficient evidence." It is simply not possible to wait until one has all the information before one comes to a conclusion in bibliography or editing. One might wait for ever and attempt nothing. Even when all the evidence is available an 'answer' may still not be scientifically provable. It is exactly as Heisenberg puts it in speaking of life itself: "Even the most important decisions in life must always contain the inevitable element of irrationality. The decision itself is necessary. . . ." The bibliographer and the editor have to realise that their kind of scholarship lies not solely in the collection and arrangement of information (vitally important though that obviously is), nor even in the scientific demonstration and proof of what they have decided (desirable though that is) but in the resolution of problems that are humanistic, not scientific or enumerative. One must, as it were, find the narrow way between Popeian eclecticism and Popperian hypothetico-deduction. 38 At its highest pitch the work of the bibliographer and the editor is creative. It is not creative in the same way that the original author was creative (and I am not arguing for the continuum of creativity favoured by the Ohio editors of Browning, therefore). Whereas the author, given a certain romantic disposition, can argue that his audience is solely himself, or, hopefully, that it is for all time, the editor's very justification is that he acts in response to the needs, general and scholarly, of his own society, bringing his author's work before the editor's society so that it may be enabled to respond to it. At its simplest this may be no more than a matter of typography (and rarely the editor's responsibility); at a rather higher level it is the provision of matter explicatory and critical; but at its most significant, it is the bringing to bear upon the text of all the scholarship (bibliographical, historical, literary and linguistic) and all the intellectual and aesthetic insight characteristic of the editor and his age, without being restricted to that age or inhibited by any aspect of it. It was the new awareness of science and man which developed in the nineteenth century (and which can be seen in the great creative writers as well as the scientists of the time) which came to be applied to textual studies in English literature from the time McKerrow and Greg met at Cambridge in the 1890s. In the work of editors of the twentieth century one can see, covert and unrealised, or explicit and declared, the scientific and socio-realistic concerns of 'the new bibliography' brought to bear on the textual problems posed by the texts they edited. The response to the spirit motivating the understanding of man in society which influences the creative writing of, say, a Zola or a Shaw, or even a Lawrence or a Joyce, influences also that aspect of textual studies which seeks to discover what happened to texts in the societies which produced and transmitted them. This is particularly obvious in the way Kane takes account of the personal involvement of scribes in what they copied and the way this affected the texts that have come down to us. 39 It is this that has led to so many investigations into, say, the Stationers' Company, or Henslowe, and it is precisely this that underlies the second question Bowers poses for editors. 40</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI To what in our agonised society should the textual critic now be responding? It occurs to me that McKenzie, in his concern to import into bibliographic studies an approach appropriate to science and Thorpe, in his desire to dissociate bibliography from science, have in mind a kind of science which is only partially relevant to our world as it is now understood. One can see the same sort of thing in one of the most interesting critical studies of the last decade, George Steiner's The Death of Tragedy . 41 In part of his argument he suggests that: "When the new world picture of reason usurped the place of the old tradition in the course of the seventeenth century, the English theatre entered its long decline." Later on he argues: "The myths which have prevailed since Descartes and Newton are myths of reason, no truer perhaps than those which preceded them, but less responsive to the claims of art." My concern here is not whether the conclusions which Steiner draws are sound (though I believe these do not necessarily follow from his analysis, brilliant though that analysis is), but of the change since Einstein, Heisenberg, and Gödel pronounced The Special Theory of Relativity, The Principle of Uncertainty, and the Theory of Incompleteness, respectively. No longer is the world within the atom to be understood in terms of the laws of cause and effect, nor that universe beyond our world as ruled by time as marked at Greenwich. Time present and time past Are both perhaps present in time future, And time future contained in time past. If all time is eternally present All time is unredeemable. What might have been is an abstraction Remaining a perpetual possibility Only in a world of speculation. What might have been and what has been Point to one end, which is always present. 42 If within the limits of atom and universe our world works well enough according to Newtonian physics it is only with an awareness that this is only a partial explanation of physical being. Whether directly or not, creative writers have responded, since Strindberg wrote The Dream Play a year or two before Einstein published his theory, to this new understanding of the nature of our world. It is surely not mere coincidence that those in the forefront of physics and mathematics, and those in the avantgarde in the arts, are concerned in their very different ways and to very different purposes, with uncertainty, incompleteness and irrationality? In this at least, and most excitingly, science and art are related. If we do sense that we are at a point of crisis in bibliographic studies — that our paradigm is inadequate to cope with the anomalies with which it is faced — then perhaps it might repay us to take note of these changes in the physical explanation of our world and the response of creative writers thereto. What we could find is that the more precise techniques developed by 'the school of Bowers and Hinman' (if I may use such an expression) are to us not unlike what Newtonian physics is to scientists, but that outside the usefulness of these methods (which are, after all, rather extensive) we ought not to be afraid of irrationality and infinite coincidence. Or, to put it more conventionally, imagination and taste. Thus might we still be able to respond to the question Erasmus asked of Martin van Dorp: "What are we to say when we see that the exemplars of this edition do not agree?" 43 and we may, in Ben Jonson's words, in an aptly named work, "doe a welcome worke yet to helpe posterity to judge rightly of the old.", 44</field>

My first reactions to McKenzie's paper were given at the Second International Conference of Elizabethan Theatre, Waterloo, Ontario, July 1969 and published in the proceedings of that conference, The Elizabethan Theatre, II , (1970). I added to Dr. McKenzie's 'chamber of horrors' but argued against the suggestion (made by his reviewer in the T.L.S. , 22 May 1969) that Dr. McKenzie had demolished the greater part of the theory of skeleton formes (a claim he had not himself made) and questioned Dr. McKenzie's own use of historical perspective and his interpretation of the evidence provided of Bowyer's use of presses. I would here express my thanks and my indebtedness to several colleagues who have discussed that paper with me and read what I have to say here, in particular a former student, Peter Leach. It might be worth mentioning in this connexion that what Dr. Williams found in Troilus and Cressida (Variorum, ed H. N. Hillebrand, p. 346) and what I found in I Henry IV , Penguin ed. (1968, pp. 250-1) — a particular use of two single-skeleton-formes—has also been found by one of my undergraduates (Rosamund Bateman) in the 1607 Volpone . In addition, two more undergraduates, Silvie James and Gillian Atkins, noted single-skeleton-forme working in Spenser's Amoretti , 1595, and as late as 1630 in parts of A Chaste Maid in Cheapside . This should not destroy all faith in the theory of skeleton formes but it might modify our understanding of what happened in the Elizabethan printing house. Single-skeleton-forme working may have been more persistent than has been suggested, but this hardly means there was no methodology before the Industrial Revolution—rather the reverse, indeed. 5 The Library , 25 (1970), 159. 6 "Hypothesis and Imagination" in his The Art of the Soluble (1969), p. 147. 7 Thorpe , pp. 11, 14 and 16. 8 Thorpe , pp. 14 and 29.

Copernicus, they argue, "could not expect to persuade the run of traditional minds of his time" and he appealed, therefore, to the mathematicians. "In a sense, then, Copernicus was appealing to the aesthetic judgement of his fellow mathematicians.

      <field name="heading_text">Historical Grist for the Bibliographical Mill * by Edwin Wolf, 2nd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">American historical bibliography is still in its infancy-analytically speaking. Except in the field of the editing of manuscripts, as witness the textual studies of Body and Labaree, who incidentally never questioned the validity of the text of only a single copy of any printed work, there has been little textual criticism in depth of the works of an extra-literary American writer. ( John Dewey: The Early Works [Southern Illinois University Press, 1969—] is a notable exception.) In the 1968 Studies in Bibliography Tanselle wrote an excellent historico-critical article on "The Descriptive Bibliography of American Authors." He noted that "In the United States attention was first given to the statesmen," and he cited bibliographies of Hamilton, Jefferson, Washington and Franklin published from 1886 to 1889. At this point the curtain came down on statesmen and has not since gone up. Miller's soon-to-appear Franklin is a bibliography of imprints and only overlaps writings insofar as the printer published his own works which, happily, he did with gusto. Except for Eames's Smith section in Sabin, Holmes's Mathers and Skeel's Webster, works which admirable as they are attempted no collation of known copies to record such recondite variants as must exist, Tanselle mentioned no other historico-literary or purely historical bibliographies which he rated higher than enumerative compilations or checklists. There were uncounted literary Americans who were treated in a manner ranging, in his judgment, from excellent to unspeakable. Let me cite some examples. As I noted in an article in the Papers of the Bibliographical Society (1969), the variants of the proof copy of the first printing of the Declaration of Independence have not yet appeared in print. Nearer to home, if anyone has straightened out the editions and issues of the 1620 Declaration of the State of the Colony and Affaires in Virginia by examining all known copies of all the varying texts, I do not know of it. I did have at hand in the Library Company enough copies of another double Virginia book, Marshall's Life of Washington — not quite, but almost, the early American equivalent of Boswell's Life of Johnson — to hint at an unchronicled publishing history and a putative textual problem. What my casual observations mean in terms of text or printing practise, I cannot say; someone should. In the first volume the engraved portrait went through three recognizable states, which enabled me to set tentative priorities. Remember no page-by-page collation was made; the following indications are based on superficialities. Printing A1 of the first volume, dated 1804, has the first state of the portrait and an asterisk on a line with the first signature of each gathering; it has 488 pages of text and 45 pages of notes. Printing A2, also dated 804, has the second state of the portrait and no asterisks; it has the same pagination as above. Printing B, dated 1805, has the second state of the portrait; it has 500 pages of text and 43 pages of notes. Printing C, also dated 1805, has the third state of the portrait; it has 459 pages of text and 45 pages of notes. Finally, printing D, fictitiously dated 1804, has the third state of the portrait; it has the same pagination as printing A, but is clearly later because of the use of bold-face capitals on the title and at the beginning of each chapter. There are two editions of the second volume unequivocally dated 1804 and 1805; two of the third similarly dated; three editions of the fourth all dated 1805, and two of the fifth both dated 1807. In the atlas at least one plate exists by two different engravers. If all this turned up from a superficial comparison of only five copies, what might be discovered if the set were given the same treatment as Fitzgerald's or Crane's works. What kind of emendations were made, if any? What is the text of Marshall's Life ? Certainly, you will agree, not the chance reprinting from any old copy. I mentioned in the same article the major textual changes in two issues of that important Revolutionary play, John Leacock's Fall of British Tyranny . In 1798 at Petersburg, Virginia, there was printed Robert Munford's Collection of Plays and Poems . In the Library Company we have one complete copy and a fragment consisting only of the plays, The Candidates and the Patriots . A comparison of these shows that sheets C and N were completely reset. That fact is not recorded in the 1949 preliminary checklist of Petersburg imprints issued under the auspices of this and other Virginia institutions. I cannot tell you if this resulted in textual variants, but I submit if the fact of reprinting had been noted in a first edition of Hawthorne, we would have heard about it. by now. From every point of view the Columbian Magazine , later the Universal Asylum , is one of the most important 18th-century American periodicals, as Mott is my witness. The articles which appear in it are of literary, historical and scientific importance. The engraved plates which illustrate it are among the best and most interesting series of early American prints, as Middendorf is my witness. In the bibliography at the end of Richardson's 1931 History of Early American Magazines , he stated: "Some numbers passed through a second edition requiring a resetting of the types." What numbers no one since has bothered to record. The Columbian Magazine is not as fashionable as the London Magazine . Bibliographically, we seem to be Anglophilic before 1800 and after that date jingoistically Yankee. To return to the Columbian Magazine , the fact is that the issues from September, 1786, through February, 1787, were reprinted apparently to meet the demand for back numbers as the success of the periodical became assured. The pagination in the two printings is not quite identical, so that references to pages can be confusing. Furthermore, in July, 1787, two leaves were cancelled and the substitutes were printed with the supplement at the end. Sometimes the cancelling leaves were bound as intended, sometimes they were not. Their existence has not been noted. Although a number of collations of the magazine exist, no two seem to agree on the proper number of plates and none describes adequately the inserted advertisements, one of which depicts the earliest American portrait of Shakespeare. But this is not the only neglected early American magazine. Has anyone seen a bibliographical study in respectable detail of any? Yet, they are being filmed and reprinted from any old copy with gay abandon, perfect or not as chance decrees. Talking of pictures, there are few more sanctified names in ornitholoical illustration than Audubon. One might have thought that someone would have recorded what is apparent at a glance, that there are two states of some of the lithographs in the first American, the first octavo, edition of the Birds . In one state the titles are in roman letters, in the other in cursive script. What this means in the publishing history of the set, I do not know, but surely there is some priority and some history behind the differences. A much greater problem was created by one of the most popular and most common of all official publications of early western exploration, Emory's Notes of his expedition from Leavenworth to San Diego, printed in Washington in 1848. Wagner-Camp simplified the situation by describing three forms of the work: a Senate printing, called "the first issue of the first edition" with Emory's rank given as "Lieut. Col."; another Senate issue with his rank given as "Brevet Major"; and a fuller House printing, including Abert's report. It also noted a separate Senate printing of Abert's report. The history of the publication of the work, as evidenced from the journals of Congress and an examination of twenty copies of various editions and issues, is far, far more complicated. For instance, I have found three printings of the first sheet and multiple printings of others, including major differences at one place caused by the addition of a letter from the west which arrived during the course of printing. In a few copies sheets from the Senate or House edition, the same except for headlines, have been mixed in the binding. The lithographic plates were a major feature of the work. For some three different lithographers made stones of the same subject, and some of the scenes were executed on as many as five different stones. Once upon a time I began to try to make some order out of this vast confusion. After looking at a score of copies I found that I was only confusing myself. I have abandoned the effort until I have time and a collating machine at my disposal. What is amazing is that with all the possible combinations and permutations of text and plates not a word, except the simplistic statement in Wagner-Camp, has crept into bibliographical literature. Yet, in terms of number of copies printed, and Emory-Abert report was one of the biggest bestsellers of its day. This concern of mine has been very expensive for the Library Company. Our information about variations has come from a comparison of presumptive duplicates. We sell our duplicates, as I hope you are all aware; we keep our differing copies, as any good library should. And I am talking about gross differences: variant titles, reprinted sheets or pages, the adding or substracting of text, and, of course, wholly separate editions. For our Parke-Bernet sale early last year I noted that there were two printings of the New Testament of Aitken's Bible of 1781-82. The earlier bore the address in the imprint: "opposite the Coffee-House, Front Street"; the later: "Three Doors above the Coffee-House, in Market-Street." Aitken moved to the second location in 1781 while the book was being printed; all copies of the general title, dated 1782, bear the Market Street address. Our rebound duplicate containing the earlier New Testament fetched an amazing $13,000 at the sale. The same auction house later sold another copy in mismatched contemporary bindings for less than half that price, and Goodspeed's not long after offered another one in matching bindings for only slightly more. Neither mentioned which New Testament was present. Perhaps, our bibliographical virtue was rewarded. On the other hand we have turned up more variations, hidden under a single entry in bibliographics old and very new, than we would have dreamed of. These could not, therefore, be sold and turned into that every satisfying kind of new-purchase-money. In James Murdock's play, The Politicians , Philadelphia, 1798, there is an added "Editor's Note" on a page inserted between A1 and A2 giving valuable information concerning the writing of the piece, and the final line of the text was removed in one issue. For some reason in William Barton's anonymous Observations on the Trial By Jury , Strassburg, Pennsylvania, 1803, two notes were reset on pages 11 and 14. A much more important change took place in Benjamin Smith Barton's Fragments of the Natural History of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, 1799. Leaf C2 contains a section on birds resident in Pennsylvania. On the basis of additional, later information Barton updated the original material, apparently five or six years after the work was first issued, and the revised version was printed as a cancellans, quite obviously in a different and later type. James Cheetham's violent political attack, A Narrative of the Suppression by Col. Burr, Of the History of the Administration of John Adams , New York, 1802, has so many sheets which exist in different printings that there must be a history of unusual publication behind the changes. I note only that, in what seems to be the second printing of p. 11, Cheetham left out the words: "the wretched heralds of his will" to describe Burr issuing his mandates to his political tools. For no apparent reason sheet A of William Griffith's Washington funeral Oration , Trenton, 1800, was reprinted to add "(At the Request of The Committee" to the indication of the prayer at the end, and to eliminate "of Arrangement" from the denomination of the Committee on p. 2. Let me continue with a sample of the multiplicity of variations, and a tiny sample I can assure you it is. On page 139 of Anthony Benezet's Some Historical Account of Guinea , Philadelphia, 1771, a highly significant change was made in the wording of his suggestion that all slaves be freed. At first he wrote that they shall be declared free "after serving so long as may appear to be equitable"; then he added two lines to make the phrase read: "after serving so long as shall be adequate to the money paid, or the charge of bringing them up, which may be decided by courts of justice." Since this is a work of major importance in the history of the anti-slavery movement, I would consider that recognition of the two issues is of more than minor interest. Government documents are a jungle unto themselves, as the Emory-Abert volume indicates. Unless they happen to be the Declaration of Independence or preliminary printings of the Constitution they do not make much of a stir on bibliophilic waters. They hardly ripple the pools of bibliography. By chance, we have only examined in some depth one of the session laws of the Congress of the United States, the Acts Passed at the First Session of the Fifth Congress of 1797. I hate to think how many maids with how many mops will be required to start at the beginning and work through. The first edition of the 1797 Acts is quite clear and definite. It was printed by William Ross, Near Congress Hall, 1797. As you know, session laws were printed as they were enacted as separate entities. Some copies were kept by the printer or purchaser and bound up in volumes containing the complete sessions of any Congress. They were also reprinted, again separately or as part of an inclusive volume. It is these later reprints of which I speak. What I believe to be the second printing bears the undated imprint of Richard Folwell, No. 33, Carter's Alley. It was probably printed in 1798. It contains, as did the first printing, a two-page table of contents of the first session only. We have found two inexplicable printings of pages 3 to 6. When Folwell in 1799 issued Volume IV of The Laws of the United States , from his new address, No. 63, North Front-Street, he included as many copies of the Carter's-Alley first session as he had left, and then reprinted it using the Front-Street address. Copies exist with or without the two-page session index, but a volume index was issued. We are not finished. When Matthew Carey published another edition of Volume IV of The Laws in 1803, he had Folwell supply him with the first session, which he did with a third address, at William Penn's Head, No. 23, Strawberry-street, Corner of Trotter's Alley. This incomplete information comes from only two copies of the separate second edition, two copies of the 1799 Laws , and one of the 1803 Laws . Imagine what a thorough examination of many more copies would turn up! Needless to say, there is no hint of Folwell's successive editions in bibliographical literature. We shall jump back in time a moment to emphasize the haphazard nature of all these findings. Some years ago I bought for myself a copy of what I believe to be the first book of Jewish authorship, excepting, of course, The Bay Psalm Book , printed in America. It was the then-unrecorded Wonderful, and most Deplorable History of the Later Times of the Jews by, and so stated on the title, Joseph ben Gorion (also known as Josippon), printed at Boston by John Allen for Nicholas Boone in 1718, or so at least the imprint reads. The chronicle of Josippon, the 11th edition of the Encylopedia Britannica will inform any reader, is not by the better-known Flavins Josephus - Wing, Shipton-Mooney and Bristol contradicente — but probably complied in the 10th century from diverse sources. It was in the 16th and 17th century immensely popular in England as a corollary to the second-only-to-the-Bible Flavius Josephus. I cannot here go into its importance in Cromwellian times. Joseph ben Gorion's work was not known to Dr. Rosenbach, but he did record in his American Jewish Bibliography and reproduced the title of a 1719 edition of an epitome of the honest-to-goodness Flavius Josephus, printed at Boston by S. Kneeland for N. Buttolph. It was not photographed for the Readex cards, because the American Jewish Historical Society at Brandeis is quite a distance from Worcester, so the present location was not known. Shipton-Mooney described a variant copy at the American Antiquarian Society, lacking some leaves, printed by S. Kneeland for B. Eliot. Evans 2226 and Dr. Rosenbach went on to describe a second American edition of the real Josephus of 1721, the entry based on an advertisement of Daniel Henchman in a Boston 1723 Westminster Confession of Faith . No copy of such an edition is presently known, and I believe that it was still another variant of the 1719 printing with Henchman's name given as the bookseller. Nonetheless and notwithstanding, Readex reproduced the imperfect American Antiquarian Society copy of the 1718 Joseph ben Gorion, and Shipton-Money recorded it, as the 1721 Josephus, the latter stating that it had been filmed from the Boston Public Library copy. How mixed up can one be? To make things more complicated Shipton-Mooney and Readex did microprint under a supplementary number (it is also Bristol B627) the Huntington Library copy of the Joseph ben Gurion, calling it Josephus. It has a defective imprint. The problem is further confused in that all known copies — my now two (of which one is imperfect), the Boston Public Library's, the Huntington's, with a small piece missing from the lower corner of the title, and the American Antiquarian's, lacking the title and with a few following leaves defective — there are leaves at the end, an integral part of the last sheet, and a page of advertisement dated 1722. The book is a triumph of bad printing. Types change from larger (34 lines to a page) to smaller (38 lines to a page) not only within a forme, but on the same page. Since this was the reprint of an English text, the title is an integral part of the first sheet with the prefatory material and the beginning of the text. What Allen's printing problems were, I cannot guess. I can only believe that the bookseller Boone had trouble with him or his market, began his enterprise in 1718, but did not issue it until 1722. What is the story? Shifting to another aspect of American life, let me remark that by virtue of its history and by the steady accumulations of the 19th century the Library Company has a major collection of black history material. Thanks to a Ford Foundation grant we are now cataloguing the hundreds of relevant pamphlets which library values of the past relegated to limbo. Many of these appear in the Library of Congress catalogue or that of the Schomberg collection of the New York Public Library, some in the bibliographical works of Work or Dumond. None reveals the differences we have found by comparing multiple copies. Francis Lieber's anonymous No Party Now, But All For Our Country , Philadelphia, 1863, exists in two completely different printings, although there is no statement of that fact in the pamphlet itself. The Way to Attain and Secure Peace by William D. Kelley, a Philadelphia anti-slavery Republican and long-time congressman, who became so staunch an advocate of a protective tariff that he was nicknamed "Pig Iron" Kelley, was printed in Washington in 1862. That it went through two editions became obvious from a glance, although no catalogue listing so informs us. An address by a Negro, William T. Catto's Semi-Centenary Discourse , Philadelphia, 1857, exhibits the kind of variation which is discussed in detail in the BAL; it was published in dark brown cloth with a gilt title on the front cover and in printed wrappers. A curious permutation was found in copies of Robert Dale Owen's Future of the North-West , Philadelphia, 1863. In one issue the printed wrapper does not bear an imprint, but there is a colophon on the last page of text; in the other there is a wrapper imprint, but no colophon at the end of the text. There are two issues of Felix Kirk Zollicoffer's State of Political Parties , [Washington, 1856,] one with an advertisement for The Weekly American Organ on the last page, and one without. I make no claim that these differences are significant. I cannot be sure that they are not. The examples above were haphazardly pulled from literally hundreds of similar unrecognized, unrecorded and disregarded anomalies. As we have become aware of 18th-century press numbers — even if we are not yet quite sure how to use them — so we should be alert to the fact that two copies of a 16-page pamphlet of the 19th century, although ostensibly issued at the same place by the same printer in the same year, may represent two states, issues or editions. The new STC will painstakingly list all manner of issues and editions formerly lumped under a single entry. The BAL has routinely picked up and noted bibliographical "points." Sabin, Evans, Shipton-Mooney and Bristol have just as routinely ignored them. T'ain't fair! But is it important? In orthodoxy it depends upon whose ox is gored. Bibliography has never hesitated to record the trivial merely because it was trivial. Neither enumerative nor analytical bibliographers have made value judgments. In practice, it is sometimes a later edition of a deservedly forgotten work which has been spotlighted as the key to a certain facet of printing procedure. Theoretically, the motto of the bibliographer should be: "Nihil impressum me alienum." Let me end by discussing a text which was important enough to make the Grolier and the Princeton American "100," John Dickinson's Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania . It was, before Paine's Common Sense , the single most popular pamphlet of the Revolution. There were seven American pamphlet editions within two years, and the Letters appeared contemporaneously in nineteen American newspapers from Boston to Savannah. An excellent article by Carl F. Kaestle on the public reaction to the work appeared in the Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society in 1968. In it he noted that the Letters were first printed in Goddard's Pennsylvania Chronicle , but that Dickinson continued to revise thereafter. The author's final word, he told James Otis, was the version in Hall and Sellers' Pennsylvania Gazette . It was these latter printers who issued it first in pamphlet form. That sounds great. Print the text of the first edition and you are home safe. I have not studied the text of the Farmer's Letters , but I have worked over some Dickinson manuscripts and seen many more, as well as several of his own copies of his own writings. If ever there was a second-thinker, it was Dickinson. I find it difficult to believe that with the opportunities presented by subsequent printings, he did not make further alterations. The printing chronology gave "the penman of the revolution" ample time for his usual worry about the right words in the right order. The last letter appeared in the Chronicle on February 15, 1768, and in the Gazette two days later. Hall and Sellers' first edition was advertised on March 17, their second on June 16, and the Bradfords' third not until October 17. Dickinson's statement that the Gazette text was to be preferred was made on January 25, 1768, even before the last installment had appeared. Well, who knows what? has any attempt been made to find out if, indeed, changes were made from the first edition to the second, and from the second to the third? Perhaps, there were none, and, perhaps, Bernard Bailyn was textually safe printing the Farmer's Letters from a single copy of the first edition available to him. On the other hand, maybe he was not. The tradition of a wall separating bibliography as applied to literary works from bibliography as applied to historical or political works is an old one. It is nowhere better illustrated than in the points of view expressed by James G. McManaway and Lawrence C. Wroth in their Rosenbach lectures on Standards of Bibliographical Description . The former noted that the scholars who followed McKerrow and Greg are "frequently regarded by their colleagues with a sort of condescension because of their supposed indifference to esthetic values and literary history," but, accepting the hard rules of analytical bibliography, he stated: "The primary requisite, surely, is the general agreement that the purpose of a bibliography is to describe the ideal copy of each book after the examination of every surviving copy of the book in question." Dr. Wroth on the other hand deprecated this. "The historian is less interested in minor textual differences than is the student of literature," he said. "Such differences often are important, but the cost of discovering them and making them known is immense when it may be achieved only by the most intensive physical analysis of a volume." And so the matter has rested. Incunabulists, scholars of the STC period and literary textualists of all eras have subscribed to Greg's insistence upon the importance of "the study of books as material objects irrespective of their contents." And they have advanced this thesis by stressing the significance textually of what the catch-all discipline has uncovered. Americanists with the single exception of that painstaking disciple of the Bowersian school, C. William Miller, have opted bibliographically and textually for the simplicity of an accurate, but not intensive, description of the single copy at hand. Isn't it time for a change? The original address began with these remarks : Sometime in the year 1939 I, the little boy cataloguer in the back room, began to compile a catalogue of English Plays to 1700 from the rich stock of the Rosenbach Company. That was what can only be described in Renaissance terms as the Petrarchian age of American analytical bibliography. The enumerative bibliographers had and were doing works of quality. McKerrow and Greg were advancing the science — or is it an art? — suggesting more accurate standards of description and offering a more definitive terminology. Jackson had just entered on his new career at Harvard and was correcting the proofs of his model Pforzheimer catalogue. McManaway, assistant to the director of the Folger Library, had just completed his variorum edition of The Faerie Queene . Bowers did not yet have tenure at the University of Virginia, and Hinman was still working on his thesis there. The rather meager literature of such analytical bibliography as existed was available to me, so that it was no surprise to discover that no two copies of any 16th or 17th-century book were identical. That, you must understand, was grist for a bookseller's mill. It was not just another copy to be listed; it was a heretofore undescribed variant. Solemnly, painstakingly and without the aid of mirrors I compared dozens of what Dr. R had thought to be other copies of the same book. Solemnly and painstakingly I described all the observed press corrections in the catalogue which appeared in 1940. If primitive art be collected for its naivete, this catalogue should be sought as the first in the history of bookselling which recorded in an innocent fashion the wave of the future. I was so exhilarated by my findings in the process of writing that catalogue and its successor, English Poetry to 1700 , that I decided to be a pundit. I wrote about all kinds of things like two-skeleton methods, and inner and outer formes, and headlines as evidence, quoting my fellow nouveaux arrivés , Bowers and Hinman. You must remember that all the modern aids like press numbers, Hinman collators, time and motion studies in retrospect, the identification of compositors and pressmen and Studies in Bibliography were still in utero . For the Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America I wrote, and it published, a book-shattering article, "Proof Corrections in 16th and 17th-Century Quartos." It has disappeared from the literature of bibliography, because, like those superb 17th-century treatises on squaring the circle, it just was not so. Not discouraged in my pursuit of academic accolade, I turned to textual criticism. What does a bookseller's cataloguer do about a clutch of 17th-century manuscript commonplace books of poetry. Gee, gosh and golly, I thought, nobody has really looked at the poems which circulated in personal collections years before they were solidified in print. My soundest scholarly article, a mélange of careful collation, oral transmission and Freud on error, was published in PMLA . It dealt with the transmission of the text of "If shadows be a picture's excellence," the single most popular poem of the early Stuart period, judged by the frequency of its appearance in contemporary commonplace books and printed miscellanies. That surge into uncharted waters resulted in an invitation to address the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia in 1949 on "The Textual Importance of Manuscript Commonplace Books of 1620-1660." That survives only in mimeographed form on perishable/impermanent paper. As I disappeared, like Achilles, from the arena of analytical bibliography and textual criticism, the whole field blossomed. At first, I read the articles which appeared in the trade journals, but gradually I found that only one more dedicated than I could follow the increasingly complicated, highly technical reasoning of the new Bowersian school. Having taken the collational plus and minus of cancellendum and cancellans in my stride, I had at first been encouraged. My satisfaction was short-lived. It had occurred to me that the work of a drunken compositor might have resulted in all kinds of aberrations in print, including the use of triple consonants and triple vowels. An analysis of my own typewritographical errors led me nowhere. Yet, I read a literature which said that such and so was set by compositor A, B or C, with D, E and F operating the press or presses, sometimes divided into fractions, which were able to turn out x sheets of a 2 ens of type in π hours. But what happened when there was an unrecorded-in-history leak in the roof? My irrational questions would not, I feared, be answered or taken seriously. And besides I was faced with the problem of what to do about 400,000 uncatalogued, miscatalogued and really-in-danger-of-a-leaky-roof volumes at the old building of the Library Company. Jeffersonian theorizing had to give way to Franklinian pragmatism. Just then the Hinman collator made possible another giant stride for bibliography. More quickly and more accurately than the human eye the machine was able to signal with a flicker the slightest difference between two states of the same setting of type. First Folios, the plays of Dryden, a whole carload of first, second, third and subsequent editions of American authors have undergone the scrutiny of textualists. Not the smallest sign of the deterioration of a letter nor the wear of a stereotype plate has escaped them. Page after page of variants has appeared in one journal or another. Multi-volume editions of "Works," based on this clinical analysis, are being published. Following the lead of "Daniel Boone" Bowers, Todd, Tanselle, Bruccoli and others are civilizing the textual wilderness. Lest anyone fear that this is a Spironian attack on intellectuals, I hasten to state that I admire scientific color standards and illustrated binding definitions, that I stand in awe of the broken question mark. I, too, wonder what these road signs of printing and publishing mean, and whither they can lead us toward knowledge. My complaint is not what the novus ordo seculorum has done, but what it has not done. Not being a certified member of academe, I am able to skip gazelle-like from literature to science to history to art. I realize that it is not quite so easy for the English Department to tell the History Department what to do.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Some Principles for Editorial Apparatus by G. Thomas Tanselle</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Anyone who undertakes to edit a text must necessarily make some basic decisions about the kind of editorial apparatus that is to accompany that text. Sometimes these decisions are so thoughtless that they are hardly recognized as decisions at all — as when a publisher's editor selects a particular early edition to be photographically reproduced, without commentary of any kind, in a cheap paperback series. At other times they are the result of careful deliberation — as when a scholarly editor who has constructed a critical text sets forth in several lists the data he had at his disposal in examining variants and making emendations. In between, the spectrum includes a wide variety of kinds of apparatus: one edition may be entirely unannotated except for a prefatory note explaining the source of the text and perhaps generalizing about certain changes made in it; another may record variant readings (or the more important of them) in brackets within the text or at the foot of the page; another may limit its annotation, at the foot of the page or at the end of the volume, to definition of obscure words and identification of historical allusions; and still another may be principally concerned with citing previous critics' remarks about individual passages. But whatever form the apparatus takes — from the rudimentary to the elaborate — it represents some sort of thought about the extent to which the editor should make himself visible to the audience at which he is aiming. Some kinds of apparatus, of course, are in part determined by the purposes of the edition: thus a variorum edition must by definition include apparatus which records variant readings. But an editor's basic job is to produce a text, and normally neither the exact form nor the extent of the apparatus is automatically determined by that job. A careful and reliable text obviously could be published without any accompanying apparatus, while an irresponsible text could be offered with extensive notes and tables. Such is not usually the case; but the fact remains that the precise nature of the apparatus is determined by a different set of decisions from that which lies behind the establishment of the text. It is true that most of the recent editions based on Greg's rationale for choosing a copy-text 1 have similar categories of lists in the apparatus. But there is nothing in his theory itself which requires such lists; rather, it could be said that these lists provide the most important kinds of information which ought to be supplied in any scholarly edition, regardless of the principles followed in constructing the text. Decisions affecting the text involve questions of authorial intent; decisions affecting the apparatus involve questions of editorial responsibility. When an editor prepares a text for a scholarly audience, it is his responsibility to furnish all the information required for evaluating and rethinking his textual decisions; in a popular edition, on the other hand, he may feel with some justification that his primary responsibility is to provide explanatory annotation rather than textual evidence — but of course the care with which the text itself is prepared would not be less merely because the apparatus is simpler. 2 It should be clear, therefore, that a general rationale for editorial apparatus can be discussed independently of any rationale for editing. And equally obvious is the basic principle to be borne in mind in making decisions about apparatus: that the kind of apparatus presented is an indication less of the nature of the text than of the type of audience for which the edition is intended. Just what apparatus is appropriate for a particular audience is a matter about which opinion naturally changes over the course of time, as scholarly techniques develop and bibliographical knowledge accumulates. In the nineteenth century, conventional practice for scholarly editions was to list variant readings (usually a selection of those considered most significant) in footnotes, with more discursive notes placed either at the end (as in William Aldis Wright's Cambridge Shakespeare, which began in 1863) or in a second set of footnotes, below the first (as in Horace Howard Furness's Variorum Shakespeare, which began in 1874). A new standard was set in 1904, when the first volume of R. B. McKerrow's edition of Nashe appeared; though in arrangement it was similar to earlier editions (variants in footnotes, with discursive notes in a supplementary volume), it marked a turning point in its discussions of the bibliographical history of each work, leading to a careful choice of "copy-text" (the term was first used here) — which in turn lent an added sense of objectivity and control to the record of variant readings, for it was defined to include all departures (with a few minor exceptions) from that copy-text, as well as other significant variants. McKerrow went on, in his Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare (1939), not only to refine and elaborate his editorial procedure but also to discuss in detail the form which he believed editorial apparatus should take; although in general arrangement he advocated the old system of two sets of footnotes (one of variant readings, one of historical and linguistic information), his discussion of the symbols and form to be employed in each entry for a variant reading (pp. 73-98) was by far the most extensive that had ever appeared, and its influence is still present today. But the event which has been most important in influencing the form of the apparatus in many of the more recent scholarly editions was the publication in 1953 of the first volume of Fredson Bowers's Cambridge edition of Dekker. What Bowers did to make the apparatus more conveniently usable was to break down the listing of variants into several parts: only the substantive departures from the copy-text were recorded in footnotes; the departures in accidentals were then gathered into a separate list at the end of the text; and two more lists at the end dealt with press-variant formes and with substantive variants in other pre-1700 editions ("historical collation"). Since that time many editions have employed some variety of Bowers's plan, most notably the series of editions now in progress under the auspices of the MLA Center for Editions of American Authors. These editions maintain Bowers's distinction between lists of emendations and historical collation; but since they are "clear-text" editions, no apparatus appears on the pages of text, and all the emendations of the copy-text — both substantives and accidentals — are usually joined in one list. The adoption of this approach to editorial apparatus by the CEAA editions of Clemens, Stephen Crane, John Dewey, Hawthorne, Howells, Irving, Melville, and Simms 3 suggests that a new pattern for the treatment of apparatus in scholarly editions seems to be emerging—at least for works of the sixteenth century and later. The elements in this pattern are basically four: a set of discursive textual notes, a list of emendations in the copy-text, a record of line-end hyphenation, and a historical collation. Other lists are sometimes added to cover special problems, but these four, along with an essay setting forth the textual situation which accounts for the particular choice of copy-text, have come in recent years to represent one established kind of scholarly apparatus. 4 Although the form of the apparatus in a large number of scholarly editions from the last twenty years is therefore similar, it is by no means identical, even in those which follow the same basic plan. There is no reason, of course, to insist on such identity in outward appearance, so long as the approach to the material is sound, since different circumstances naturally entail somewhat different treatments. Nevertheless, if a standard form exists and if there is no special reason to depart from it, following that form can be a positive advantage: it makes the apparatus easier to use, since readers acquainted with other editions will already know the system and will not be distracted from the content by trying to keep in mind a new plan or new symbols. Because one possible standard of this kind has been developing in recent years, it seems worthwhile to give further thought to the rationale of apparatus and to the implications of certain differences in form. The comments which I offer in the following pages are not intended as an attempt to establish "rules" but simply as a discussion of some of the considerations involved in thinking through the details of an editorial apparatus. Although I shall be mainly concerned with scholarly editions, many of the principles apply equally to more popular editions. Some remarks on the general arrangement of the apparatus and on the symbols to be employed will be followed by discussions of the four main divisions of modern apparatus enumerated above: textual notes, emendations, line-end hyphenation, and historical collation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">i. Arrangement The first decision to be made about the arrangement of apparatus is its location. Are variant readings or editorial symbols to appear within the text itself? Or is the annotation to be provided at the foot of each page? Or at the end of the text? Or in some combination of these places? The tendency in recent years has been toward "clear text" — that is, no editorial intrusions of any kind on the pages of the text itself — and there are at least two important reasons for encouraging this practice. In the first place, an editor's primary responsibility is to establish a text; whether his goal is to reconstruct that form of the text which represents the author's final intention or some other form of the text, his essential task is to produce a reliable text according to some set of principles. Relegating all editorial matter to an appendix and allowing the text to stand by itself serves to emphasize the primacy of the text and permits the reader to confront the literary work without the distraction of editorial comment and to read the work with ease. A second advantage of a clear text is that it is easier to quote from or to reprint. Although no device can insure accuracy of quotation, the insertion of symbols (or even footnote numbers) into a text places additional difficulties in the way of the quoter. Furthermore, most quotations appear in contexts where symbols are inappropriate; thus when it is necessary to quote from a text which has not been kept clear of apparatus, the burden of producing a clear text of the passage is placed on the quoter. Even footnotes at the bottom of the text pages are open to the same objection, when the question of a photographic reprint arises. Once a scholarly text of a work has been established, every effort should be made to encourage publishers who plan to issue classroom or other practical 5 editions of the work to lease that text and reproduce it photographically, thus assuring wider circulation of a reliable text. 6 But in such cases it is the text which is leased, not the apparatus; and while the apparatus, like any other published research, is available for all to draw upon, it would not necessarily be appropriate for inclusion in such leased editions, which might more usefully carry an apparatus emphasizing explanatory rather than textual annotation. The presence of any apparatus on the pages of the text, therefore, may prove in the long run a hindrance to the dissemination of a responsible text. Arguments can of course be advanced for inserting editorial apparatus into a text, and it is true that on certain occasions this arrangement is desirable. For instance, the nature of such materials as letters, notebooks, and journals — works never intended for publication — may not always be accurately reflected in clear text, which requires a choice among alternative readings that is often alien to the spirit of a private document. In these cases a text which includes editorial insertions and symbols recognizes that canceled readings and uncanceled variants are in fact integral parts of such works and comes as close as possible (short of a facsimile) to reproducing their essential character. 7 In addition, manuscripts of works which conform to genres ordinarily intended for publication — whether or not they were so prepared — may be of interest in their own right as revealing steps in the author's creative process. Such manuscripts may appropriately be edited in the form of a "genetic text," which through symbols (often, necessarily, elaborate ones) makes clear the various stages of alteration and revision. The document being edited is still a private one (like letters and journals), even though it happens to embody a text intended for eventual publication. An outstanding example of a genetic text is the one prepared by Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr., from Melville's Billy Budd manuscript (1962); because a genetic text is not easily readable, however, and because Billy Budd is a work of fiction rather than a private journal, the editors have also established a "reading text," free of all apparatus on the pages of the text. (Another method of dealing with this sort of manuscript — footnotes describing the revisions — is discussed below.) Thus it can be said that clear text may often be inappropriate when the material to be edited is a working document of a private nature; but when a work of the kind normally intended for publication is being edited as a finished piece of writing 8 rather than as a semifinal document, any intrusion into the text works against the editor's ultimate goal of presenting a text as the author intended (or would have intended) it to be presented. 9 Notes at the foot of pages of text also can be defended at times. There is no denying the argument that the location is more convenient for reference than the end of the text, and editors may wish to place the most important apparatus there, even when they reserve the bulk of it for the end. Fredson Bowers, in his move to make apparatus less cumbersome, took the view that scholarly editions "should be made more attractive to the general user, first by removing all but the most immediately pertinent of the apparatus to appendices in the rear, thus freeing the text page from all information that is only of reference value and so of no immediate concern to the reader." 10 In his edition of Dekker, only substantive emendations are given at the foot of the page, and other editions have followed a similar plan — the California Works of John Dryden (first volume, 1956), for example, which records only the emendations (substantive and accidental) in footnotes. Once the decision has been made, however, not to clutter the text pages with the entire apparatus, it is a difficult question to decide just how much of the apparatus is of such immediate importance that it should be retained on those pages, separated from the rest of the apparatus. What the issue comes to in the end is whether the advantages of having some data available without turning any pages outweigh the decided disadvantages of having the text pages encumbered with visible signs of the editorial process. And the advantages of the former are less strong when related information must be turned to at the back anyway, while the disadvantages of the latter are strong enough to have dictated this shift of at least some of the material in the first place. 11 Of course, footnote apparatus is not objectionable in editions of manuscript drafts or journals, for the same reason that genetic texts are appropriate there. Sometimes footnotes, rather than symbols in the text, are used in such editions to record manuscript alterations: a good example is Bowers's parallel-text edition 12 of Whitman's Manuscripts (1955), in which footnotes to the manuscript texts describe in words rather than symbols the exact nature of the manuscript alterations (footnotes, that is, without reference symbols in the text, so that the text remains clear). At other times footnotes are used in addition to symbols in the text, as in the Harvard edition of Emerson's journals, where the footnotes (keyed to numbers in the text) provide both textual and historical information in discursive form. In neither case are the footnotes intrusions as they would be on the pages of the finished text of a novel or poem. But whenever footnotes do appear on any kind of text pages, the proximity of note to text should not lead an editor into thinking that his decisions about the readings of the text itself are less important. H. H. Furness, in the first volume of his Variorum Shakespeare, declared that, "in such an edition as the present, it makes very little difference what text is printed in extenso , since every other text is also printed with it on the same page" (p. viii). To take such a point of view is practically to abandon editing a text in favor of constructing an apparatus, for the text then exists largely as a frame of reference for the apparatus. A record of variants presented as a work of scholarship in its own right can be useful, 13 but there should be no illusion about its being an edition. 14 In the end, a decision to use or not to use footnotes reflects an editor's critical judgment about the nature of the text he is editing combined with his evaluation of the relative importance, in terms of psychological effect on the reader, of clear text as opposed to text with simultaneously visible apparatus. 15 If an editor decides to place his apparatus at the end rather than on the text pages, several questions of arrangement still remain. One of the first is whether, if a volume contains more than one work, the apparatus pertaining to a given work should come immediately after the text of that work or whether the entire apparatus should be gathered at the end of the volume. Practice has varied in the CEAA editions: the Ohio State Hawthorne and some volumes of the Virginia Crane have apparatus following each work, whereas the Southern Illinois Dewey has apparatus at the back of each volume. Of course, the number of separate works involved has some bearing on the decision: the first volume of the Dewey edition contains many individual essays never before collected, whereas the first volume of the Crane edition and the third of the Hawthorne each contain the texts of only two separately published books. In the case of the Dewey, therefore, apparatus after each work would have produced a cumbersome volume in which editorial material continually alternated with the text and in which reference to the apparatus was inconvenient since the reader would never know just which pages contained the apparatus to any given work; in the case of volumes made up of only two or three works, on the other hand, it could be argued that the proximity of the apparatus following each work is an advantage and further that this arrangement emphasizes the discreteness of the texts which happen to be published in the same volume. Nevertheless, even when the number of separate works is small, the act of consulting the apparatus seems more difficult when the apparatus is placed at the ends of the works rather than all together at the end of the volume; 16 in addition, the occurrence of apparatus at scattered points throughout a volume, though it does not violate the idea of clear text, is undeniably a greater editorial intrusion than would exist if all the editor's data were collected at one location. Essentially the difficulty arises out of the fact that, from the textual point of view, one is concerned with two or more "books," while from the point of view of design one is dealing with a single physical volume. Since the placement of apparatus does not affect an editor's principles for establishing a text but does affect the design of the finished volume, and since the volume, as the smallest separate physical unit in an edition — and not the literary work or "book" — is the unit which the reader must manipulate, it seems reasonable to suggest that the apparatus (once the decision has been reached to place it at the "end" rather than on text pages) should probably in most circumstances be gathered in one section at the end of each physical volume. 17 A related question is the precise arrangement of the material at the end of the volume. Just as it seems easier to turn to the apparatus if it is all at one location, so is it simpler to refer to the information about a particular work if it is presented at one spot within that section of apparatus. Normally when a reader consults the apparatus he is studying a single work, and he finds the apparatus more convenient if all the lists pertaining to that work occur together, so that he does not have to turn back and forth from the relevant part of a long list of emendations for the whole volume to the relevant part of a full historical collation, and so on. One might argue, of course, that to have only one list of each type for the whole volume — as in the Dewey edition — consolidates the information more economically and is in conformity with the view of the volume as a single physical entity. The difficulty, however, is that the volume is still composed of individual works, each with its own textual history and each requiring separate editorial consideration; any apparatus which does not segregate the material relating to each work is likely to obscure the variations in copy-texts and in numbers of authoritative editions involved and to suggest a greater uniformity than in fact exists. Obviously this is not to say that the true situation cannot be perceived by a careful reader — after all, neither system, in the hands of responsible editors, conceals relevant information. The whole point is whether one system is clearer and easier to use than the other, and the advantage in this regard would seem to lie with the system which presents separate blocks of data for each individual work. The greater ease with which, under this system, one can move from one category of data to another and gain an overview of the kinds of editorial decisions involved (even without remembering which pages the work covers) surely outweighs the slightly greater expenditure of space entailed. 18 Whether or not a volume contains more than one work or has apparatus arranged by work, another question which an editor must decide is the order in which the various parts of the apparatus are to be presented. Although the record of emendations in the copy-text generally precedes the historical collation, there is otherwise little consensus on this matter. Some editions place the discursive textual notes after the list of emendations, while others give them first; some put the list of line-end hyphenation last, while others insert it immediately after the record of emendations. The issue is not one of major importance: what is important is that these kinds of information be present, not that they be present in a particular order. Still, they have to appear in some order; and the editor, if he does not settle the question by flipping a coin, must have some rationale for selecting one order over another. If an advantage, however slight, does exist favoring one arrangement, that arrangement is preferable to a purely random order hit upon by an individual editor — preferable not only because there is some reason for it but also because its adoption would result in greater uniformity among editions. At any rate, the editor should be aware of the various considerations involved in the ordering of the lists. One common arrangement is to place the list of emendations first (if it does not appear as footnotes), since it could be considered of most immediate importance, recording as it does the editorial alterations in the copy-text. Generally this list is followed (as in the Ohio State Scarlet Letter , the California Mark Twain, and the Dewey edition) by the discursive textual notes; because a common practice now (following Bowers's Dekker) is to mark with an asterisk those emendations which are discussed in the notes, the section of notes can in a sense be regarded as an appendage to the list of emendations. On the other hand, most editors find it necessary occasionally to comment on readings they have not emended, giving their reasons for not altering what might at first seem to be incorrect. Notes of this kind obviously do not relate to the list of emendations, since no emendations are recorded at these points. One way of solving this awkwardness is to insert asterisked entries in the list of emendations calling attention to these notes, simply by citing the reading involved and adding " stet " to show that the reading was the same in the copy-text. 19 The result is that every discursive note can be located by means of the asterisks in the list of emendations; but the price paid for this convenience is that the list of emendations is no longer, strictly speaking, a list of emendations, because it also contains certain instances where emendations have not been made. This list is then less easy to use for surveying the emendations as a whole or compiling statistics about them, since one would have to be alert for those items which are not emendations at all. The function of such a list would be less clear-cut and less easy for the reader to comprehend; and the convenience of having asterisk references to all the notes (if, indeed, it really is a convenience) is probably not worth so high a price. An alternative, and more satisfactory, solution is simply to reverse the order of the two sections, placing the textual notes before the list of emendations. One effect of this change is to remove any implication that the notes are tied to the list of emendations; asterisks can still be used in the list of emendations to call attention to notes, but no awkwardness results from the fact that some of the notes take up readings not entered in the list. This arrangement emphasizes the real function of the notes: to comment on any readings — whether emendations or not — which raise some problem from a textual point of view and which thus require some explanation. Many readers not interested in rejected variants will be reading carefully enough to wonder about certain peculiar expressions and will turn directly to the textual notes to see what explanation is offered for the adoption (whether through emendation or retention) of these expressions. Placing these notes nearest the text is both suggestive and convenient: suggestive of the fact that the notes make direct comments on readings in the established text, and convenient because it allows all the sections of the apparatus in tabular, rather than discursive, form to fall together. 20 In recent years this position for the textual notes has been gaining favor and has been employed in the Crane, Howells, Irving, and Melville editions and in the Hawthorne edition beginning with the second volume. 21 Once it is decided to make the textual notes the first of the four main divisions of the apparatus, 22 it is not difficult to settle on the list of emendations as the second. Of the standard lists, it is the one most directly connected with the edited text, since it records the editorial changes which that text embodies and enables the reader to reconstruct the basic document, the copy-text. The question that remains, then, is the order of the other two basic lists — the historical collation and the record of line-end hyphenation. The hyphenation list is often put in last position (as in the Dewey, Howells, and Irving editions, in certain volumes of The Mark Twain Papers , and in the first volume of the Hawthorne edition); apparently the reason is that hyphenation seems in some intangible sense less "significant" than the instances of substantive variation in the authorized editions. Yet if one of the reasons for giving precedence, among the lists, to the record of emendations is that it is concerned with editorial decisions, consistency would suggest that the hyphenation list should follow immediately, since it too records editorial decisions — that is, one half of it does, the half that lists line-end hyphens in the copy-text. And the other half — noting the established forms of compounds divided at line-ends in the edited text — is of direct use to any reader who wishes to make a quotation from the text. The historical collation, on the other hand, is simply a factual register of the variations (usually only the substantive ones) present in a given group of editions; although it is valuable in setting forth much of the textual evidence at the editor's disposal, its purpose is not primarily to list editorial decisions, 23 and it is thus set apart from the other main sections of the apparatus in this regard. If the principle of arrangement is to be — as seems sensible — a movement from what is most directly associated with the final edited text to what is least directly connected with it, there is little doubt that the hyphenation list should precede the historical collation (as it does in the Crane, Fielding, and Melville editions and in the Hawthorne beginning with the second volume). A suggested standard order, therefore, for the four basic parts of the apparatus is as follows: (1) textual notes; (2) emendations; (3) line-end hyphenation; and (4) historical collation. Another essential part of the editorial matter is an essay describing the editorial principles followed in the edition, the textual history of the individual work, and any special problems emerging from the application of those principles to that particular historical situation. This kind of essay is frequently labeled as an "introduction" and placed at the beginning of the volume, preceding the text. Although such a location does not contradict the notion of clear text (since it obviously does not affect what appears on the text pages), it does result in the editor intruding himself at a very prominent place in the volume; what is probably more in keeping with the spirit of the clear-text principle and with the decision to place apparatus at the end is to think of the textual essay not as an introduction to the entire volume but only as an introduction to the apparatus — and thus to be placed at the end, though preceding the other parts of the editorial matter dealing with textual concerns (a plan followed by a number of editions, such as the Howells, Irving, Melville, and Simms). 24 In cases where related documents of textual interest exist (a manuscript fragment from an early draft, a published preface differing from the one in the copy-text edition, a map or other nontextual appurtenance of the copy-text edition, and the like), they can properly be printed or discussed as another section of the editorial apparatus — a section which should probably come last, since such material often is not keyed directly to the established text and in any case is only peripherally related to it. Finally, the editorial apparatus in some instances may include explanatory, as opposed to textual, annotation: many editions provide a historical essay on the background, composition, publication, and reception of the work, and some—especially those of nonfiction — also offer notes identifying allusions and an index. The historical essay is sometimes placed at the beginning of the volume, even when the textual essay follows the text (as in the Howells and Simms editions), and at other times it is put in the end matter, preceding the textual essay (as in the Irving and Melville editions); the argument for the latter position is the same as in the case of the textual essay — to allow the edited work to have the opening place in the volume. The explanatory notes — if they are not treated as footnotes 25 — might reasonably be the first section to follow the text, preceding any of the textual apparatus (as in the Howells edition), though they might logically follow the historical essay, if that essay were in the end matter; and an index, whether or not it covers the editorial contributions, should retain its conventional position at the very end of the physical volume (as in the Dewey edition). Since the nontextual annotation is discursive in form or is set up in forms (such as indexes) about which much has already been written, and since the related documents by their nature usually present special situations which must be treated on an individual basis, the remarks on form in the pages which follow will be limited to the strictly textual apparatus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ii. Symbols Practically every edition makes some use of symbols or abbreviations; indeed, they are almost unavoidable unless one is dealing with a text so uncomplicated that scarcely any apparatus results. The primary motive behind most (but not all) symbols and abbreviations is economy, for if an editor is going to refer dozens (or even hundreds) of times to a particular impression, published at a given time by a given publisher and identifiable perhaps only by certain typographical peculiarities, it is merely common sense that he devise some concise way of making the reference. But he must also realize that, beyond a point, the interests of economy work in the opposite direction from those of clarity. In 1863 William Aldis Wright recognized (as every editor must) this dilemma: "We will now proceed," he said in the introduction to the Cambridge Shakespeare, "to explain the notation employed in the foot-notes, which, in some cases, the necessity of compressing may have rendered obscure" (p. xxii). When symbols are multiplied to the point where it is difficult for the reader to keep them in mind, so that he must constantly consult a key to decipher what is being said, the time has come to rethink the whole system. In some fields, such as mathematics or chemistry, symbolic statements, however complex, are admirably suited to the purposes they are intended to serve; but the apparatus to a literary text is generally directed toward the readers and students of that text, for whom a knowledge of special symbols is not necessary in their principal work of understanding the text. It is not reasonable, therefore, to ask the users of a textual apparatus to become acquainted with an elaborate symbolic structure, since that apparatus is only a reference tool, rather than the central focus of their attention. Nineteenth-century editors tended to make excessive demands along these lines; and even McKerrow's Prolegomena , though its thoughtful treatment of symbols is important and though the symbols it advocates are individually sensible, sets up too many of them, with the result that in combination they can be bewildering. Fortunately, the recent trend, since Bowers's Dekker, has been toward the simplification of symbols. In thinking about editorial symbols, the essential principle to be kept in mind is that for this purpose the value of a symbol ought to be judged on the basis of convenience rather than economy (though economy is often a prime element in convenience): if a symbol, both in itself and in combination with others, makes the apparatus easier to refer to and understand, it is a good one; if it does not, it should be abandoned. Perhaps a distinction should be made between symbols which stand for particular editions or impressions and those which stand for concepts. One cannot object to a multiplicity of symbols representing editions, if there happens to be a large number of editions involved, for the symbols are still easier to manipulate than cumbersome identifications of the editions in words; but further symbols to be used in conjunction with the edition-symbols for making comments about particular situations may easily proliferate to the point where they are less easy to follow than the same concepts expressed in words. Thus when McKerrow uses parentheses to indicate "a reading which is not identical with the one given but which is substantially the same in meaning or intention so far as the purpose of the note is concerned" (p. 82) and then inserts two parallel vertical lines within the parentheses "as a warning that, although the editions thus indicated support the reading in question, the context in which their reading occurs is not identical with that of the other texts" (p. 85), one may begin to feel that the goal of the apparatus has become compression rather than ease of comprehension. 26 Yet no one would be likely to have strong objection to the many abbreviations and symbols — such as "Theo.," "Johns.," "Cap.," "Camb.," "Fl," "Q1"—which McKerrow employs as shorthand designations for individuals editions. Indeed, these abbreviations, though numerous, are largely self-evident and rarely would need to be looked up more than once; even aside from their economy and ease of transcription, therefore, they have the positive advantage of being recognizable at a glance (whereas a fuller identification in words normally would take somewhat longer to read). If it can be agreed, then, that the use of symbols is desirable for reference to editions and impressions, the practical question which arises is what system to use in establishing the symbols. There are two basic approaches: one is to arrange the editions in chronological order and then to assign them arbitrary sequential designations, such as the letters of the alphabet or numbers; the other is to construct each symbol so that it contains enough rational content connecting it with its referent to serve as a mnemonic. The choice of system depends on what kind of information is deemed most useful in connection with a given text, since each system, in order to make certain facts obvious, sacrifices other facts. In the first system, one can tell immediately that a particular reading is, for example, from the third edition (by means of a "C" or "3") but cannot tell (and may not be able to remember without checking) the year of that edition and whether it was English or American. The second system, conversely, might provide in the symbol the information that the edition was an 1856 American one (through some such symbol as "A1856" or "A56") but would not at the same time reveal its position in the sequence of editions. A variety of the first system has conventionally been used for pre-nineteenth-century books: a letter designating format (such as "F" for folio and "Q" for quarto), followed by numbers indicating the succession of editions within each format. Thus "Q4" would identify the fourth quarto but would not indicate the year of publication nor whether the edition came before or after the second folio. Attempts to combine the two approaches have not been successful because forcing too much significance into a symbol renders the symbol more cumbersome and to some extent defeats the purpose of establishing symbols as simple and easily recognizable designations. An edition reference like "3A56" is, on the fact of it, not simple, particularly when it occurs in a table full of similar references; furthermore, it contains a possible ambiguity (whether the 1856 American edition is the third edition or the third American edition) which may cause its meaning to be less easy to remember and may keep one turning to the key for reassurance. If it is also necessary to take impressions into account, the symbol becomes even more unwieldly, whether it is "3A2(56)," "3Ab56," "AIIIii56," or whatever. It is clearly a mistake to try to construct symbols which reveal edition, impression, year, and country of publication at the same time; if a symbol is to serve efficiently its basic function of providing a convenient and unambiguous reference, it cannot bear the weight of so much information, and the editor must decide which pieces of information will produce the most useful symbols in a given situation. For earlier periods (before the beginnings of machine-printed books), the bibliographical and textual information conveyed by reference to format makes such symbols as F1, F2, Q1, etc., more revealing than reference to years of publication would be — and simpler as well, since the common situation in which more than one quarto appeared in a single year would have to be reflected in letters or other marks appended to the year designations. This system is one of the few well-established conventions in reference notation, and, with usefulness and simplicity on its side, there is little reason to oppose its popularity. For later books, however, format cannot always be determined and in any case is a less useful fact for incorporation in the symbol, since the variants to be reported are likely to be between impressions as well as editions. The most obvious adjustment would be merely to eliminate the format designation and use consecutive numbers (or letters) to refer to successive editions, with attached letters (or numbers) to indicate impressions within any edition. The Hawthorne edition assigns capital roman numerals to editions, with superscript lower-case letters for impressions (e.g., "III c "), while the Howells edition employs capital letters for editions, with arabic numerals for impressions (e.g., "B2"). 27 Such a system is simple and neat; but, if a large number of editions and impressions are involved, it is difficult, even with repeated use, to remember with certainty what many of the symbols stand for, and continual reference to the key is unavoidable. A mnemonic system, on the other hand, may generally be somewhat less simple; but, so long as it is not a great deal more cumbersome, the fact that the user can remember numerous symbols without difficulty may be regarded as an offsetting advantage. (Besides being easier to use, brief symbols may be preferable for practical reasons of economy, especially if the apparatus is set in double column, where longer symbols might produce additional run-over lines.) Probably the most workable and adaptable mnemonic system is to identify editions by letters and to attach years for particular impressions. Thus if only one English and one American edition are involved, the letters "E" and "A" are sufficient, with a given impression referred to as "E1855" or "E55." When more editions are involved, letters representing the name of the publisher or the city of publication could be used; and when more than one impression occurs in a particular year, appended lowercase letters could indicate the sequence within the year. References to manuscript, typescript, and proof could employ the usual symbols "MS," "TS," and "P," as in the Howells edition. Obviously other adjustments would be required in certain situations. If, for example, there is more than one edition from the same publisher, a prefixed number could indicate the fact (as "2H," where "H" stands for the publisher's name), unless year-designations are going to appear so often as to make the symbol cumbersome. In that case the technique of consecutive lettering could be applied, though with some lessening of the mnemonic value of the system, which would then be evident principally in designations of later impressions ("C75" would be the 1875 impression of the third edition). Regardless of the variations in the basic system, an extremely useful convention which emerges is that a letter by itself stands for all impressions of an edition and a year is attached only when a particular impression is meant. But even this convention is best modified in certain situations: in the case of Irving's Mahomet there is only one English impression but nine American printings, all from the same publisher; the sensible way in which the Wisconsin edition assigns symbols here is to use "E" for the English impression and simple year designations without attached letters ("50" for "1850") for the Putnam impressions. 28 This arrangement is perfectly clear and is simpler than if a superfluous "A" or "P" were prefixed to the numbers. In another kind of situation, a letter may even be made to stand for more than one edition. Some volumes of the Crane edition, for example, involve syndicated newspaper pieces, for which the text in one newspaper is no closer to the syndicate's master proof and no more authoritative than the text in many other newspapers. In these instances of "radiating texts," Fredson Bowers introduces (in the fifth volume of the Crane) the symbol "N" to stand for all the located newspaper texts, attaching superscript figures when necessary to identify specific newspapers. The generic letter suggests the essential equality of the various newspaper editions, and the superscript figures distinguish themselves from the regular figures used in other symbols to indicate chronological sequence. The basic principle in each situation is to make the symbols as simple as the textual situation will allow, so long as they retain enough substance to be easily remembered. (Certain symbols which are sometimes used to stand for groups of edition-symbols are commented on below in the discussion of the historical collation.) In regard to symbols which stand for abstract concepts or relationships rather than concrete documents or impressions, the most prudent course of action is to keep their number as small as possible. Only two such symbols (both suggested in McKerrow's Prolegomena ) have gained any currency in recent editions, and the reasons for their importance will suggest the kinds of circumstances in which symbols are desirable. Both symbols are used in reporting variants in punctuation: one, the centered tilde or wavy dash (˜), stands for the word previously cited, when the variant is not in the word but in the punctuation associated with it; the other, the caret (V), calls attention to the absence of punctuation at a given point. The justification for the first is not simply that it saves the effort of repeating the identical word, for the small amount of effort saved would be no justification at all if the repetition of the word would be clearer; the fact is, however, that the information is conveyed more clearly with the symbol than without it: 218.4 indefatigable,] A; ˜; 218.4 indefatigable,] A; indefatigable; In the second example, the reader may see the difference in punctuation immediately, but he cannot be sure that no other difference is involved until he examines the two words closely to see that they are identical; 29 in the first, the curved dash tells him instantly that the only variant reported here is that of punctuation. Furthermore, using the curved dash eliminates the possibility of introducing a typographical error into the word the second time it is set; hopefully such an error would be caught in proofreading, but there is no point in needlessly setting up situations in which errors of this kind can enter. The caret is similarly useful in providing a clearer statement than is possible without it: 188.23 approaching,] 57; ˜V 188.23 approaching,] 57; approaching 188.23 approaching,] 57; ˜ The difficulty with the last two examples is that in them empty space is made to carry the burden of significance for the entry. It is true, of course, that no foolproof way exists to guarantee the accuracy of what appears in print, and it may be that in proofreading the danger of overlooking an unintentional omission of punctuation is no greater than that of failing to notice an incorrect mark of punctuation. Nevertheless, it is reassuring to the reader to find a caret calling attention to an intended lack of punctuation. In any case, the whole point of the entry is to inform the reader that punctuation is absent at a given spot in a particular text, and it is more straightforward to make this point positively by actually noting the lack than to imply it by simply printing nothing. As these two symbols illustrate, therefore, conceptual symbols are justified when they reduce the chances of error in proof-reading, when they are clearer in the context than their referents would be, or when they eliminate the necessity of regarding the absence of something as significant. The wavy dash and the caret may take a few seconds to learn, but the importance of what they contribute easily outweighs whatever unfamiliarity they may at first present to some readers. When a symbol fails to meet these tests — that is, when it is merely a shorthand device and makes no positive contribution to clarity — it is better not adopted, for only a slight proliferation of such symbols can render an apparatus needlessly forbidding. Except in certain editions of manuscripts, 30 there is rarely any need to have more symbols than the curved dash and the caret, along with the symbols for individual documents.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">iii. Textual Notes The section of discursive notes on textual matters is generally entitled "Textual Notes" but sometimes (as in the Irving and Melville editions) is called "Discussions of Adopted Readings." Both titles suggest an important point about the content of these notes: they are comments on individual problematical readings in the text which has been established, and any reading which appears there is the "adopted reading," whether it results from emendation or retention of the copy-text reading. The notes, in other words, discuss not simply emendations but also places where emendations might have been expected and yet, after careful consideration, have not been made. (The principal reason for putting the textual notes before the list of emendations, of course, is to emphasize the fact that they refer to the text itself and not to the emendations.) Since these notes deal with individual readings, it is important to keep general matters out of them and to limit them to cases which raise special problems. Any textual problem which recurs a number of times ought to be taken up in the textual essay, since it then constitutes a general textual problem and since a repetition of the same explanation several times in the notes or extensive cross-references between the notes would be more awkward and, indeed, less clear than one coherent discussion in which all the evidence is brought together. The most convenient form which the textual notes can take is a citation of page and line number (or act, scene, and line), 31 then the reading under discussion (shortened by an indication of ellipsis if necessary), followed in turn by the discussion itself. Generally a square bracket, the conventional sign to distinguish a lemma, separates the reading from the discussion but is of course not essential. 32 The note itself need not say what has been substituted or retained, because the reading of the edited text is the one fact which the reader inevitably knows at the time he consults the note, and if, in addition, it is cited at the head of the note, he has that reading before him on the same page. It is superfluous and uneconomical, therefore, to begin a note by saying, "We retain x at this point because . . ." or "This text adopts the reading y here owing to the fact that . . . ." Instead, all that is required is a direct statement, as simple as possible, of the facts which led to the decision which is already obvious. Thus a note might begin, "X, though unidiomatic, appears in a similar context at 384.27 . . ."; or, "No evidence has been discovered which would support z , the copy-text reading, as standard usage at the time, and the phraseology at 412.16 suggests that z is probably a compositorial error for y . . . ." The notes should be kept as few as possible: there is no point explaining matters easily checked in standard dictionaries or encyclopedias, nor is there any reason to refer to those general problems more cogently handled in the textual essay. Annotation which is unnecessary for either of these reasons only wastes the reader's time 33 and reveals the editor's failure to give sufficient thought to the rationale for textual discussions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">iv. List of Emendations The purpose of the list of emendations is to provide a convenient record of all the changes of textual interest 34 — both substantive and accidental — made in the copy-text by the editor(s) of a given edition. The essential parts of each entry are simply the page and line citation, the reading of the edited text, the symbol representing the source of that reading, and the rejected copy-text reading. The general form which these items usually take includes a square bracket to signify the lemma and a semicolon to separate the source of that reading from the copy-text reading which follows: 35 10.31 whom] W; who Another possibility, employed in the Melville edition, eliminates the bracket and the semicolon and places the two readings in separate columns. It could perhaps be argued that this scheme makes the list slightly easier to use for purposes of surveying the nature of the emendations as a whole or constructing various kinds of statistics about them, since the source symbols would more readily show up along the right side of the first column and the copy-text readings would have a common margin in the second column. In any case, if the list is limited strictly to those readings of the copy-text which do not appear in the edited text, no symbol is required after the second reading, since in each case it is by definition the copy-text reading. (In those unusual instances in which a deficient copy-text is rectified by intercalations from another text, so that the copy-text is in effect composite, symbols following the second reading are helpful, even though a separate list of the intercalations would presumably be available.) It is important, however, to understand the reason for setting up a list restricted in this way. So long as a historical collation is to be included in the apparatus, the readings of the copy-text could be ascertained from it and would not necessarily have to be presented in a separate list. But this arrangement would be awkward and inconvenient in two ways: first, since the historical collation is normally limited to substantive variants and since the reader may legitimately wish to know all emendations, including accidentals, the absence of a separate list of emendations would cause the historical collation to become an uneven mixture, combining a complete record of substantive variants with an incomplete record of variants in accidentals; second, discovering what emendations had been made would be somewhat less easy if notation of them were imbedded in the larger historical collation. There is no question about the necessity of having at hand a record of all editorial alterations in the basic authoritative document chosen to provide copy-text; and the greater convenience of having that record as a discrete unit, along with the resulting greater consistency of the historical collation, provides compelling reason for what might otherwise seem a superfluous or repetitive list. The situation is a good illustration of the principle that some sacrifice of economy is more than justified if the result is truly greater clarity and usefulness. In the light of this summary of the general rationale behind the idea of a separate list of emendations, two common variations in the basic form outlined above are worth examining. One is the segregation of substantives and accidentals into two different lists. This system is used in Bowers's Dekker and the Cambridge Beaumont and Fletcher (where emendations in substantives are listed at the foot of the page and emendations in accidentals at the end of the text), as well as in the Virginia edition of Crane's Maggie and the Wesleyan edition of Fielding's Joseph Andrews (where both lists come at the end of the text). Since the purpose of a list of emendations is to make the whole range of emendations easier to examine and analyze, it follows that under certain circumstances — particularly when there is an especially large number of emendations in accidentals — the separation of substantives and accidentals will make such examination easier still. In other words, if the total number of emendations is small or even moderate, little is gained by exchanging the simplicity of one list for the complication of two; but when there are a great many emendations, with the possible result that the emendations in substantives would be obscured by being included in the same list as a large number of emendations in accidentals, the data may be much easier to use if the two categories are listed separately. To do so is only to extend the principle of convenience and clarity on which the whole list is founded in the first place. And, by a further extension, certain large categories of automatic alterations within the list of accidentals itself may be separated so as not to overwhelm the other individual alterations of probably greater significance. For example, in the Northwestern-Newberry Typee 224 words ending in "-our" in the British copy-text are changed to the American "-or"; once the policy of making this category of changes is adopted, the changes themselves are automatic, and to list all 224 instances in a list of emendations would place an unnecessary impediment in the way of using the list to trace the more important alterations. Yet it is unwise to make any textual changes silently; 36 so these 224 alterations of spelling are recorded in a footnote to the textual essay. In the Dewey edition many emendations are made in the capitalization of words standing for concepts, and these emendations are gathered into a separate list of "concept capitalization." 37 Whenever there is a large separable category of emendations, this practice is a useful way to avoid, on the one hand, overburdening the main list and, on the other, risking the dangers of silent emendation. A second variation from the most basic form of an emendations list is the inclusion of at least some of the further history of the rejected copy-text readings. That is, instead of providing simply the copy-text reading at those points where the copy-text has been emended, the entry includes the sigla for certain other editions which agree with the copy-text and sometimes includes the full history of the reading in the collated editions. One often-used plan, 38 following Bowers's Dekker, is to trace, at each point of emendation, the readings of all collated editions (that is, all which might contain textual authority) down to the earliest which can serve as the source of the emendation. Thus in the entry IV.iii.19 we] Q3; me Q1-2 the earliest edition to contain the adopted emendation is Q3, and the history of the reading down to that point is given (Q1 and Q2), rather than just the copy-text (Q1) reading; what the history of the reading in any collated editions after Q3 may have been is not revealed here but can be ascertained from the historical collation. In other editions (such as the Howells and the Irving), the complete history (in the collated editions) of the readings at certain points of emendation is given, either explicitly or through a specified system of implication; when this plan is followed, none of these entries reappears in the historical collation, which is then limited to rejected substantives. In both of these arrangements, the distinction between the historical collation and the list of emendations has been blurred to some extent; as a result, the functions of these lists are less clear-cut, and therefore more cumbersome for the editor to explain and less easy for the reader to comprehend. Including in the emendations list the history of the readings down to the point of emendation means that the emendations list becomes partly historical in function and repeats part of the material from the historical collation; but the presence of some historical information in the emendations list does not obviate the need for turning to the historical collation, since anyone wishing to examine the evidence available to the editor at a given point of substantive emendation must look at the historical collation in any case to see if there were variants in editions later than the one from which the emendation is drawn. 39 In the other system, the emendations list takes over even more of the function of the historical collation — indeed, it becomes the historical collation for certain emended readings. 40 And though none of this material is repeated in the other historical list (now containing only rejected substantives), there is no one place where the reader can go to survey all the evidence at the editor's disposal relating to substantive variants. So long as it is agreed in the first place that there is value in having a separate list of emendations, the simplest way of dividing the data is to make one list strictly a record of emendations and the other strictly a historical record. The functions of the two lists are then easier to understand, and the lists are correspondingly easier to refer to and work with. The question of distinguishing between substantives and accidentals is often not an easy one, because some alterations of punctuation, for instance, do have an effect on meaning; but unless the substantives and accidentals are to be placed in separate lists, the question does not arise in constructing the record of emendations. Two other basic problems of definition always have to be faced, however: since the list aims to enumerate emendations in the copy-text, the editor must have precise definitions of what constitutes an "emendation" and what is meant by "copy-text" if he is to have a firm basis for deciding what to include in the list and what to leave out. In practice, defining the two concepts becomes a single problem, for however one is defined affects the definition of the other. Editors of critical editions 41 generally agree that there is no point listing as emendations such changes as those in the display capitals at the opening of chapters, in the typographical layout of chapter headings, in the length of lines, or in the wording of running titles. Whether an editor defines "emendation" so as to exclude changes concerned with styling or design, or whether he defines "copy-text" to exclude purely typographical features of the text, the result comes to the same thing in the end. Technically, of course, an "emendation" is simply a correction or alteration, and it is the qualifying phrase "in the copy-text" which through precise definition serves to delimit the kinds of alterations to be listed. There should be no difficulty in defining "copy-text," if the distinction between "text" and "edition" is observed: "text" is an abstract term, referring to a particular combination of words, spelled and punctuated a particular way; "edition" is a concrete term referring to all copies of a given printed form of a text. Thus a "copy-text" is that authoritative text chosen as the basic text to be followed by an editor in preparing his own text, and it does not include the formal or typographical design of the document which embodies that text. 42 The type-face, the width and height of the type-page, the arrangement of headings and ornaments, and the like, are all parts of the design of an edition but are not elements of the text which is contained in that edition; similarly, the formation of letters, the spacing between words, the color of the ink, and the like, are not parts of the text embodied in a manuscript. It does no harm for an editor to enumerate certain features of design which he regards as nontextual, but it is not actually necessary for him to do so if he has defined "copy-text" carefully, for his definition will have excluded such details as external to the text. 43 Omission of any notice of alterations in design does not constitute a category of silent emendations in the copy-text, since the design is not a part of that text at all. One problem in the specification of copy-text is raised by the existence of variations within an impression. Such variations may be caused by stop-press corrections or by type which slipped or shifted during the course of printing. The precise definition of copy-text in terms of particular states of the variations obviously determines which of these readings qualify for inclusion in the list of emendations: thus if uncorrected formes are taken as copy-text, the only press-variants which would turn up in the emendations would be those adopted from corrected formes; and if the correct spacings at points where letters shift around are regarded as characteristics of the copy-text, the only variants of this kind which would be reported in the emendations list would be those for which no copy with correct spacings had been found. The decision as to whether correct or incorrect states are taken as copy-text may vary in individual circumstances, but the point is that the copy-text must be defined in terms of the specific variants within the impression which embodies it; for this abstract "text" must have one and only one reading at any given point, 44 and to define a copy-text merely in terms of an impression is not sufficiently rigorous, since more than one reading may exist at many points within various copies of that impression. 45 Because sheets embodying corrected states of some formes (or correct spacings of letters) will be bound with sheets embodying uncorrected states of other formes (or incorrect spacings of other letters), it is unlikely — when more than a few press-variants occur — that any single physical copy can be found which contains the entire copy-text. 46 Emendations in the copy-text, therefore, are not simply emendations in the text of a particular copy; and the copy-text remains an authoritative documentary form of the text, even though no one existing physical entity (or even no one physical entity that ever existed) happens to preserve it. The exigencies of producing a book — the fact that the forme is the unit in printing and the sheet the unit in gathering a copy of a book together for binding 47 — makes it natural that the finished product may contain a mixture of states. One may have to examine a large number of copies of a given impression to discover the press-variants in it, and one can never be sure that any copies left unexamined do not contain additional variants. In the Ohio State Scarlet Letter , for instance, collation of eight copies of the first impression produced five variants, all examples of loosened type which either shifted position or failed to print. At four of the points of variance, some copies carried the correct reading; but in the remaining case one copy read "t obelieve," and the others read "tobelieve." Since the correct spacing in this one instance did not occur in any of the examined copies, it had to be listed as an emendation, whereas the other four variants do not enter the emendations list at all, since the correct form of each did appear in at least one copy. 48 If, however, another copy were to be collated in which "to believe" appeared correctly, that form would no longer be an emendation and should not appear on the emendations list. As with any other research, the conclusions must be based on the evidence at hand; and that evidence, in any inductive investigation, is probably incomplete. If the number of surviving copies is small, one can examine all the available evidence and still be far from the truth; if the number is large, one may reasonably wish to set some practical limits on the extent of the investigation. But in either case the results are liable to modification by the next copy which turns up. The danger is unavoidable; but at least one can operate with precision and rigor within the limits of the located evidence. Part of what that entails is defining the copy-text in terms of press-variants (saying, for example, "the text in a copy of the 1850 impression with x at 172.15, y at 234.21, and z 278.11"), for only in this way can one know what constitutes an emendation and belongs in the list. There are some variations among copies of a given impression which are nontextual and need not be reported, any more than differences in design between the copy-text print and the critical edition need be specified. Usually it is not difficult to distinguish between these nontextual press-variants and the press-variants of textual significance just discussed. They are frequently due to differences in inking or in the amount of damage which a particular piece of type (or letter in a plate) has suffered. Variations in inking need not be reported if all the letters are visible, but if the inking is so poor that some letters do not show up at all in any copy examined, the variation is in effect a textual one of the kind described above. Battered letters or marks of punctuation — whether or not the batter varies from copy to copy — can be silently corrected without involving textual emendation, so long as there is no question what letters or marks are intended. But if the damage is great enough to raise possible doubt about their identity, any attempt at correction becomes a textual emendation and must be listed. Thus if a dot appears in the middle of a sentence at a place where it could be the upper half of either a colon or a semicolon, and if no examined copy shows enough of the lower half for identification, a textual decision is required to correct the punctuation; or if a small mark appears between two words where it could perhaps be a hyphen, and if no examined copy clears up the matter, the editor's decision to consider it a hyphen rather than, say, a part of the damaged preceding letter is a textual one; or if a letter which ought to be "e" appears to be a "c" in every examined copy, the correction is a textual emendation. The importance of having access to a large number of copies for this kind of checking is obvious. Most editors rightly feel that it is unfortunate if their lists of emendations have to be overburdened with entries which are probably not really emendations at all and which might be eliminated if more copies were available for examination. But without those copies, there is no alternative to recording them as emendations, since there is no documentary proof that the copy-text contained the correct readings. Finally, a few minor points about form should be noted. (1) First, the list will be clearer in the end if each lemma consists simply of the word or words which constitute the emendation, without any of the surrounding words. 49 Occasionally an editor will feel that it would be helpful to the reader to have an additional word or two of the context, to enable him to see more clearly the nature of the alteration involved, while he is looking at the list. It is difficult to say, however, what would be sufficient context for this purpose, but generally a few words would not be enough; and as the cited readings become longer, the actual emendations become less easy to pick out, with the result that this approach makes the list more difficult to use (as well as less consistent, since there would be no way of defining objectively how much should be cited). The only times when a word in addition to the actual emendation should be reported are when the same word as the emendation appears elsewhere in the same line (so that one of the two words adjacent to the emendation is required to identify it), when a mark of punctuation is emended (so that the word preceding the punctuation—or after it, in the case of opening quotation marks — is convenient, and sometimes essential, for locating the emendation), and when something is deleted from the copy-text (so that the point of deletion can be located). (Even the first of these can be eliminated if one adopts Greg's device of using prefixed superscript numbers to indicate which of two or more identical words is at issue, but this system is perhaps somewhat less easy for the reader to follow.) (2) A second formal matter which might cause difficulty is the notation of a missing letter (or letters). When loosened type causes letters to shift, without any letters failing to print, there is of course no problem because the usual between-word spacing can be used (as in "t obelieve"); but when loosened type or a damaged plate results in the complete disappearance of letters, it is important to show that space for these letters exists. It clearly makes a difference whether a reading is reported as "race" or as "[]race," for the second shows that a letter has dropped out and that the original word was "brace," "grace," or "trace." These empty spaces can be noted in various ways. The Hawthorne edition simply uses a blank space, which works well enough between words but is less clear if the missing letter is at the beginning or end of a word; Kable's edition of The Power of Sympathy 50 employs a caret to mark the space, creating an ambiguity since the caret is also used to signify the absence of punctuation; and the Melville edition uses square brackets, which may be somewhat cumbersome but are fairly suggestive and do not conflict with another symbol. (3) Another question of notation concerns those emendations which are in fact additions to the copy-text — that is, words or passages for which there is no counterpart in the copy-text. One common editorial device is to use the abbreviation " Om. " or " om. " to signify the lack of corresponding text at a given point in the copy-text. If the abbreviation is specifically defined in this way, it is clear enough; but if it is not explicitly defined and is allowed to suggest "omitted," it can be misleading, since the omission of anything implies that something was available to be omitted, whereas the additions to a copy-text are often passages not yet written at the time the copy-text was completed. A phrase like "[ not present ]," which suggests no direction of change, would avoid the problem and would require no explanation. 51 (4) There remains the question of adjusting the symbols for editions and impressions to take variant states into account. If one of the uncorrected formes of a particular sheet is taken as copy-text but requires emendation at several points from the corresponding corrected forme, the symbol indicating the source of the emendations must note the state involved. For hand-printed books the conventional method is to attach a "u" or "c" in parentheses to the symbol for the edition — "Q1 (u)," "F2 (c)" — though of course superscript letters could also be employed. For later books, if the symbol for a given impression ends with figures, states can be represented by suffixed letters ("A55a," "A55b") or — regardless of the makeup of the symbol — by superscript letters ("A55 a "); these letters signify the sequence of presently known states of individual readings within an impression (not necessarily "uncorrected" and "corrected" states of formes). 52 Because no single copy of a book may contain all the uncorrected or corrected formes, or all the earliest or latest states of variants, these attached letters — for books of any period — must be understood to refer, not to physical "books" (that is, not to entire copies of a given impression), but to readings that may or may not be present in any individual copy of the proper impression. A copy containing one Q1 (u) reading may contain other Q1 (c) readings, or a copy containing some A55 a readings may have other A55 b readings. For this reason the superscript letter may have an advantage over the suffixed one in emphasizing the fact that it is essentially a different kind of symbol — referring to a stage of variation at a particular point within an impression, not to the whole impression (or edition), as does the basic symbol to which it is attached. Many formal matters such as these may seem of minor consequence in themselves, but, taken together, the decisions regarding them may make the difference between a list of emendations which is cumbersome and perhaps misleading and one which is convenient, logical, and easily understood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">v. List of Ambiguous Line-End Hyphenation Until Fredson Bowers called attention to the matter in 1962, 53 no consideration (to my knowledge) had been given to the editorial problems raised by possible compound words hyphenated at the ends of lines. Such hyphenation clearly presents problems in two ways: first, when a possible compound is hyphenated at the end of a line in the copy-text, the editor must decide whether to print the word in his edition as a hyphenated word or as a single unhyphenated word; second, when a possible compound is hyphenated at the end of a line in a scholarly critical edition, the editor must have some means for informing his readers whether this word should be reproduced, in any quotation from the text, as a hyphenated word or as a single unhyphenated word. As a result, the necessity of including two hyphenation lists in the apparatus of critical editions cannot be denied. The first of these lists, recording line-end hyphenation in the copy-text, is essential to complete the record of editorial decisions. The editor's decision whether or not to retain a line-end hyphen in a given word can be more difficult than some of his decisions reported in the list of emendations. Yet it does not really produce an emendation, for if he prints the hyphen he is only retaining what, after all, is already present in the copy-text; and if he eliminates the hyphen he is only treating it as the printer's convention for marking a run-over word. Obviously some line-end hyphens present no problems: those simply breaking a word which cannot possibly be a compound (as "criti-|cism"), where the hyphen is only a typographical convention, not to be retained when the word will fit within a line; and those dividing compounds in which the second element is capitalized (as "Do-|Nothing"), where the hyphen is to be retained whenever the word is printed. But in between is a large area of possible compounds where no automatic answers can be given; the treatment of these hyphens depends on various factors (the author's characteristic usage, the conventions of the time, and the like), and the editor is not providing readers with a full record of his textual decisions unless he specifies these cases. The second list, recording line-end hyphenation in the editor's own text, is necessary if the editor is to complete his task of establishing a text — for if there are places in a text where a reader does not know precisely what reading the editor has adopted, the text cannot be considered established. An editor has failed in part of his responsibility if he produces a text in which the reader, quoting a particular passage, has to make decisions on his own about the hyphenation of certain possible compounds. 54 Both these hyphenation lists, then, are indispensable parts of an editorial apparatus. (For convenience, I shall refer to the first kind of list described here as the "copy-text list" and the second as the "critical-text list.") Because the Center for Editions of American Authors has required editions prepared under its auspices to include the two hyphenation lists (as specified in its 1967 Statement of Editorial Principles ), the value and importance of these lists are becoming more widely recognized. Among the CEAA editions themselves, however, there are some variations in form, arrangement, and approach; and a glance at the principal variations will suggest some of the factors which need to be considered in setting up these lists. Probably the most noticeable difference among editions is in the order of the two lists. One may feel that it makes little difference about the order, so long as the two lists are there; but if an editor is trying to follow some consistent rationale in the overall arrangement of the entire apparatus, then surely one arrangement of the hyphenation lists fits that scheme better than another. Several editions (the Crane, Fielding, Hawthorne, and Simms and The Mark Twain Papers ) place the critical-text list before the copy-text list, while several others (the Dewey, Howells, Irving, and Melville) reverse this order. The general rationale outlined above suggests placing nearest the text those parts of the apparatus taking up decisions affecting the edited text. Following this plan, the copy-text list should precede the critical-text list, for the copy-text list does record editorial decisions and in this sense is an appendage to the list of emendations (the immediately preceding section, according to this arrangement); the critical-text list, on the other hand, does not involve editorial decisions in establishing the text 55 but only printer's decisions in setting the text (decisions necessitated by the exigencies of right-margin justification). Indeed, the functions of the two lists are so different that it is some-what artificial to place them side by side; only the superficial fact that both deal with hyphenation has caused them to be grouped together. The copy-text list fits logically into the textual apparatus because it is historically oriented: that is, it records certain words in a historical document about which the editor of a critical text has to make decisions. But the critical-text list is merely a guide to the proper interpretation of certain fortuitous typographical features (hyphens) of a given edition of that critical text; its usefulness is not in studying textual problems but simply in reading the edited text. In other words, the edited text is not really complete without the critical-text list, for without it certain hyphens in that text would be ambiguous. The other parts of the apparatus are important to certain audiences, but the edited text could of course be printed without them; the critical-text list, on the other hand, is essential to all audiences, and the edited text should never be printed without it. If, for example, a publisher leases a CEAA text and reproduces it photographically, he should include the critical-text list, whether or not he is including any other apparatus; if, instead, he sets the CEAA text in type anew, he should prepare a new critical-text list which applies to his own edition. It is extremely unfortunate that the copy-editors' convention for indicating to the printer which hyphens are to be retained (one hyphen above another, resembling an equals sign) has never become a generally accepted convention for use on the printed page; if an editor could utilize such a double system of line-end hyphens, the printed form of his edited text would be self-contained, without any typographical ambiguity requiring a separate list to elucidate. 56 As matters stand, however, to do so would violate the notion of clear text, since the double hyphen would strike the reader as an unfamiliar symbol. It will not be possible, therefore, in the foreseeable future to eliminate the critical-text list, and yet it presents something of an anomaly in the textual apparatus. Logically it should be separated from the rest of the apparatus and placed as an independent entity immediately following the text. Yet it is unrealistic to think that the easy grouping together of all matters connected with hyphens will be readily superseded; and one can only hope that this arrangement does not obscure the widely different purposes of the two lists nor cause reprint publishers to over-look the relevance of the critical-text list to their concerns. Some editions contain more than two lists in the section on line-end hyphenation. For instance, a third list that sometimes appears (as in the Crane, Dewey, Fielding, Hawthorne, and Simms editions) is a short one recording those instances in which a line-end hyphen occurs in a possible compound in the critical text at the very point where a line-end hyphen also falls in the copy-text. The function of a separate list of these words is to show that the established forms in these cases result from editorial decisions. Nevertheless, these words do not logically constitute a third category; they merely belong to both the preceding categories. A simpler arrangement, therefore, would be to have only the two lists — the copy-text list and the critical-text list — with certain words appearing in both. The introductory note to the critical-text list could not then say — as these notes do in some editions — that the words occurred with hyphens (or without hyphens) in the middle of lines in the copy-text; it would have to say that for each word the "established copy-text form" is listed. If the reader wishes to know which forms were established through editorial decision, he can quickly check the appropriate spot in the copy-text list to see if the word also turns up there. 57 Still another hyphenation list which has been employed (as in The House of the Seven Gables and The Marble Faun ) records line-end hyphens in the critical text which are true emendations (that is, hyphens at points where none are present in the copy-text). Again, such words do not form a separate category but, rather, readings that belong in two categories — in this case the critical-text hyphenation list and the list of emendations. The simplicity of an arrangement which keeps the number of word-division lists down to the basic two is not merely an advantage to the bewildered reader who may never have encountered any hyphenation lists before; it also dramatizes the logical division between the two functions which hyphenation lists serve. 58 Furthermore, it sets as few obstacles as possible in the way of the quoter or reprint publisher by presenting one, and only one, consolidated list of ambiguous hyphens in the critical edition. The matter of deciding just which line-end hyphens are to appear in these lists can be approached in two ways. One method is to list all compound words and all words which might be regarded as compound, if they are hyphenated at a line-end, recording the forms they should take when they fall within the line; such a list would contain both hyphenated and unhyphenated words. Another method is to list only those words whose line-end hyphens are to be retained when the words come within a line and to say that all other line-end hyphens can be ignored as compositorial word-division; such a list would contain only hyphenated words. 59 Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. The first system has the advantage of being explicit (listing all words about which a question might arise), whereas the second proceeds by implication (making the absence of a word assume positive significance); on the other hand, the second system has the advantage of covering in condensed fashion — through its combination of direct statement and implication — every instance of line-end hyphenation in an entire work, whereas the first may result in an extremely long list and still omit words that some readers would consider "possible compounds." Presumably one could infer, even in the first type of list, that omitted instances of line-end hyphens are not significant (that is, that those hyphens should not be retained in transcription), but the fact remains that the actual content of the list is not precisely defined, since the question of what constitutes a "possible compound" is a subjective one. It might never occur to one person to think that the line-end hyphens in "cup-|board" or "inter-|view," for example, should be retained, while another person might expect to find them in the list for explicit guidance. The first kind of list, in other words, is somewhat inefficient, because for all its length it may always fail to note words considered "possible compounds" by some people; the second type of list, in contrast, can in shorter space be positively complete, because the criterion for inclusion does not involve any attempt to define "possible compounds." This second type of approach, then, might seem preferable for the hyphenation lists in a scholarly edition, were it not for two further considerations. In the first place, this approach, for full effectiveness, requires that one have at hand the edition referred to. That is, if an editor says that all line-end hyphens, other than those listed, are merely compositorial, the reader who wishes to look over those allegedly compositorial hyphens must consult the edition under discussion and run his eye down the right margin of the pages. Furthermore, if the policy of an apparatus is to record all the editor's textual decisions, those instances in which a line-end hyphen in a possible compound has been dropped are just as significant for inclusion as those instances in which it has been retained; to define the first category by a process of elimination (as what remains after the second category is specified) 60 is as unfair to the reader as to make silent emendations, for it requires him to search through a text himself to locate the individual instances. It becomes obvious, therefore, that one of these methods is more appropriate for one of the hyphenation lists, and the other method is more appropriate for the other list. The copy-text list should follow the method of noting all possible line-end compounds and showing the editorially established form of each, with or without hyphens — for this list refers to a document outside the volume which the reader has in his hands at the moment, and it records editorial decisions necessary for the reader to know about in evaluating the editorial process or in reconstructing the copy-text. The critical-text list, on the other hand, more appropriately follows the system which notes only those line-end hyphens to be retained in transcription — for this list refers to the printed form of the text in the volume already in the reader's hands, and it has nothing to do with editorial decisions. In other words, the more explicit system is necessary for a full recording of editorial decisions, whereas the more concise system is preferable for elucidating purely typographical ambiguities of the new edition. Once again, the differences in the purposes of the two lists are reflected in differences in method. If the hyphenation lists are set up in this way, and if their introductory comment 61 and their form 62 are kept as simple as possible, the reader should have no difficulty following them or understanding why, in their different ways, they are important.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">vi. Historical Collation The remaining principal division of the apparatus is the one which records the variant readings that have occurred in significant editions of the text. Its emphasis is historical, as distinguished from the list of emendations, where the emphasis is on the changes made by the present editor in the basic text he is following. Some of those changes were probably adopted from (or noted in) other editions, but the primary function of the entries in the list of emendations is not to provide the history of the variant readings at those points; 63 such history, as well as the history of other variants (where no emendation of the copy-text occurred), is reserved for this "historical collation," as it is often called. Two limitations are normally imposed on the historical collation. In the first place, it does not usually survey (at least in the case of nineteenth- and twentieth-century works) every edition of the text which has ever appeared, but only those of possible textual significance; thus all authorized editions which were published during the author's lifetime are included (since any changes present in them could have resulted from his revision), as well as any posthumous editions which purport to utilize newly available authoritative documents or which could conceivably have utilized such evidence. 64 Second, the historical collation is generally limited to substantive variants, on the grounds that variants in accidentals from edition to edition are of so little significance (particularly in light of Greg's rationale for selecting a copy-text) as not to justify the great amount of space and labor which a record of them would entail. 65 This limitation obviously necessitates distinguishing substantives from accidentals, not always an easy task; but if the distinction is to be meaningful, one should guard against admitting variants in punctuation into the historical collation as "semisubstantives" unless they clearly involve substantial alterations of meaning. Some editions (such as the Howells and the Irving) limit the historical collation in one further way: by entitling it "Rejected Substantives" and listing in it only those substantive variants which are not adopted as emendations in the copy-text. Under the basic form of this system, each entry in the list of emendations must provide the full history of the readings at that spot, because none of these entries will reappear later in the historical collation. In effect, the historical collation is split into two lists, one containing entries involving emendation of the copy-text and another covering the remaining substantive variants, where no emendation is involved. (In another version of this system, any agreements with the rejected copy-text reading in editions later than the one from which the emendation is drawn — or any additional post-copy-text readings — would appear in the list of rejected substantives, and thus in these cases the list of emendations would not provide the entire history of the variants.) 66 The obvious motive for this arrangement is economy, and there is no doubt that in many cases the apparatus can be considerably shortened by the procedure; how much it is shortened depends on the number of substantive emendations (exclusive of those initiated by the editor at points where no other variants exist), since under this system none of them would have to be repeated in the historical collation. If a particular text requires an extremely large number of substantive emendations, it is possible that so much space might be saved as to justify this method on grounds of economy alone; but in most situations it is perhaps questionable whether the saving of a few pages is the most important consideration. The price paid for the economy, after all, is some loss of clarity and convenience. For one thing, the functions of the two lists become less clear-cut and distinct and therefore less easy to explain to the reader and less easy for him to comprehend: one list serves both as a record of editorial emendations (substantives and accidentals) in the copy-text and as a partial historical collation, and the other completes the historical collation (for substantive variants only). In addition, the reader making a serious study of the variants may be somewhat inconvenienced by not having the full range of historical evidence regarding substantive variants brought together in a single list or at a single place, 67 necessitating a search through the emendations list. Of course, if the emendations are divided into two lists, one for substantives and one for accidentals (as they probably should be whenever a list of "rejected substantives" replaces a full historical collation), this objection carries less force. But the fact remains that an emendations list is predicated on the idea that it is important to have a concise and readily accessible record of all textual changes made in the copy-text; if that list is made to carry part of the burden of the historical collation as well, then it becomes in effect a segment of the historical collation, and the logic of having two lists becomes less clear. In most cases, it would seem that the slightly greater space required for a full historical collation (that is, one which includes adopted as well as rejected substantive variants) is offset by the advantages of keeping the historical evidence intact — and separate from the record of the editor's conclusions based on that evidence. The form of the entry in a historical collation is essentially the same as in a list of emendations, except that the sources of the rejected readings must be specified (whereas in a list of emendations the rejected readings are by definition from the copy-text and thus do not have to be individually identified as such). In addition, since the reading from the edited text provides the lemma in each case, there is strictly speaking no necessity to identify its source, since if it is not from the copy-text its source is recorded in the list of emendations. Even in a simple entry, therefore, these differences reflect the differing functions of the two lists: 10.31 whom] W; who [ list of emendations ] 10.31 whom] who 50-60,E [ historical collation ] Although it is not necessary in the historical collation to specify the source(s) of the lemmata, it does no harm, particularly in the cases of those which are emendations. Furthermore, the list of emendations names only the immediate source of an emendation, and if the historical collation does not specify later editions in which this reading occurs, the history of the variant is provided only by implication: 127.4 moan] moon 37-42; mean 60-70 127.4 moan] 45-57; moon 37-42; mean 60-70 Both these entries convey the same information, but in the first the reader has to be told that any of the collated editions not specified agree with the lemma, while in the second the history of the lemma is provided explicitly. It is a common practice to say that editions not listed agree with the reading to the left of the bracket; when a great many editions and variants are involved, the economy of this system no doubt makes it a sensible one, but it does require that the reader be familiar enough with the editions collated to remember which ones are not specified (or else he has to turn to the list of collated editions to see which ones they are). Although the entries can be run on in paragraph form, they are generally presented on separate lines, and specifying the history of the lemma does not usually cause an entry to spill over into a second line; under these circumstances, there seems little reason not to aid the reader by naming explicitly (or in inclusive form, as "45-57") all the editions covered. 68 One of McKerrow's symbols, the plus sign, has frequently been used to signify all collated editions later than the one indicated; using the plus sign is preferable to allowing this information to be implied by the absence of certain sigla, but unless the number of editions is very large it would be still better to specify them individually. 69 When they are so specified, the reader can study the variants of any given edition by running his eye down the page and noting the appearances of the proper siglum (or the groupings which include it), without having to remember or figure out where that siglum would fall in entries which do not list it (or clearly refer to it). Finally, the form of the entire list may be further modified by leaving out the brackets and semicolons and arranging the readings in columns. The advantages are the same as when the column form is used in the emendations list, but the limitation of this arrangement is that it is awkward if more than two or three variants are involved in individual entries. When, for example, there is only one American and one English edition — as in the case of Melville — a two-column historical collation is feasible; 70 but when a work went through more than two editions, with the resulting possibility of more variant readings (but not the same number in each instance), the conventional form, with brackets following lemmata and semicolons following sigla, is to be preferred. 71 Variants within impressions raise special problems for the historical collation, just as they do for the list of emendations. Since a knowledge of such variants in the copy-text edition is necessary for the precise specification of copy-text, they should certainly be recorded (at least those which involve more than variations in inking or slight type damage); but since these variations are likely to be in accidentals as well as substantives, not all of them would be appropriate for recording in the historical collation (if, as usual, that collation is limited to substantives). It seems sensible, therefore, to set up a special list to record such variants 72 (examples are the lists of press-variants in the Dekker and Beaumont-Fletcher editions and the lists of variants within the first and within the second editions in the Ohio State Scarlet Letter ); alternatively — or additionally — these variants can be discussed in the textual essay as part of the definition of copy-text or of the bibliographical comment on other editions (as in the Melville edition). If any of the variants do turn out to be substantives, they should also be reported in the regular historical collation, since they form a part of the full history of the readings at these points. But determining which ones are substantives sometimes turns — as information about variants within impressions necessarily turns — on the particular group of copies collated or examined. In Chapter 70 of Melville's White-Jacket , for instance, the American edition (copy-text) reads "President" at a point where many copies of the English edition read "[]resident"; the space suggests that a "P" failed to print, but what did print — "resident" — is a different word, and, if no copies of the English edition could be found with the "P," the word would technically be a substantive variant. Copies reading "President" were eventually located, however, and this variant — though it deserves mention in the textual essay (or in a special list) — need not be entered in the historical collation. Once again, the intimate connection between descriptive bibliography and editing is evident: the greater the number of copies which are examined, the more reliable the evidence on which the edition is based. The idea of separating certain categories of historical information for presentation in special lists can be applied to other situations as well. Two kinds of special lists may result. One kind merely repeats data present in the full historical collation — data which the reader may find useful to have brought together in one spot. In the Hawthorne edition, for example, there are sometimes (as in The Blithedale Romance and The Marble Faun ) lists of rejected first-edition substantive variants (rejected in favor of manuscript readings). The entries in these lists are included in the full historical collation, but because of their importance for critical study they are made more easily accessible by this additional listing as a separate group. 73 This type of list is purely for the reader's convenience and can be a great help when there is an important category of variants difficult to survey as a whole in the regular historical collation. The other kind of special list (like the list of variants within an impression) records information which should be made available to the reader but which, though historical in nature, does not readily fit into the historical collation. This situation often arises in treating pre-copy-text variants (such as alterations in a manuscript), especially if variants in accidentals as well as substantives are to be reported. Of course, if only substantive pre-copy-text variants are recorded, and if they are not of such quantity as to overwhelm all the later substantive variants, they can simply be included in the regular historical collation (as in the Wisconsin Mahomet ), and no separate list is required. But when either of these conditions does not apply, a special list is advisable. In the Hawthorne edition, both accidental and substantive alterations in the manuscripts of The Blithedale Romance and The Marble Faun are listed, and the number of substantive alterations alone is far greater than the total number of substantive variants in the later editions; under these circumstances, the wisest course, adopted by the Ohio State edition, is to provide separate lists entitled "Alterations in the Manuscript." 74 These special historical lists including both substantives and accidentals are also appropriate on occasion for post-copy-text variants, as when a particular later edition is of enough importance in the history of the text to warrant recording all its textual variants. An example, in the Ohio State Scarlet Letter , is the list of variants between the first and second editions; any substantive variants in this list naturally occur in the regular historical collation as well, but they are repeated here along with the variants in accidentals to facilitate study of the precise relationship between the two texts. The basic historical collation, therefore, will often be buttressed by additional lists, sometimes regrouping information for the reader's convenience and sometimes reporting supplementary information. 75 Any consideration of editorial apparatus is misguided if it loses sight of the convenience of the reader. For some audiences, the apparatus may be irrelevant and need not accompany the edited text; but for most scholarly audiences an edition without apparatus resembles any other work that lacks documentation — it may be brilliantly done, but it provides no aids for facilitating the scholar's independent investigation of the evidence. The apparatus (as the word itself suggests) is a tool for expediting further study, and a tool, to be effective, must be as simple and as easy to use as the circumstances allow. Fredson Bowers — through his connections with editions of Dekker, Beaumont and Fletcher, Fielding, Hawthorne, Crane, and Dewey — has done more than anyone else to set the course of modern apparatus along these lines. As a result of his efforts, there is now not only a widespread acceptance of an efficient basic approach to apparatus but also an increased awareness of the significance of apparatus. Though just a tool appended to a text, the apparatus may well be the only part of an edition that can meaningfully be called "definitive": there may legitimately be differences of opinion about certain emendations which an editor makes, but a responsible apparatus is a definitive statement of the textual situation (within the limits of the copies examined). What constitutes an apparatus responsible in both form and content is therefore a matter worth serious consideration. Only by being fully cognizant of the issues and problems involved in setting up an apparatus can an editor make those decisions which will establish his apparatus as a lasting contribution to literary study.</field>

James Thorpe (1963; rev. ed., 1970), esp. pp. 53-54; and "Some Principles for Scholarly Editions of Nineteenth-Century American Authors," SB, 17 (1964), esp. 227-28. See also Statement of Editorial Principles: A Working Manual for Editing Nineteenth Century American Texts (CEAA, 1967), pp. 9-10. During the same years there have, of course, been proponents of other approaches to editing and to apparatus. Among the best known are Edmund Wilson (represented by his essays in the New York Review of Books on 26 Sept. and 10 Oct. 1968, reprinted the same year in pamphlet form as The Fruits of the MLA ) and F. W. Bateson (represented by his editorial plan for "Longman's Annotated English Poets" and reflected in his letter in the TLS on 1 Jan. 1971, pp. 14-15). Some discussion of Wilson's views can be found in Professional Standards and American Editions: A Response to Edmund Wilson (MLA, 1969) and of Bateson's in Thomas Clayton's letter in the TLS on 18 Dec. 1970, p. 1493. 5 The term "practical edition" is used here in the sense established by Fredson Bowers in "Practical Texts and Definitive Editions," in Two Lectures on Editing (1969), pp. 21-70. Further comment on the relation between definitive editions and widely disseminated reading editions appears in his "The New Look in Editing," South Atlantic Bulletin , 35 (1970), 3-10. 6 Encouraging such reproduction does not imply that only one reliable text of a work can exist. Obviously more than one text can be prepared following sound scholarly procedures, for there may legitimately be differences of opinion about certain emendations which rest on critical evaluation. (For discussion of this point, see G. T. Tanselle, "Textual Study and Literary Judgment," PBSA , 2nd Quarter 1971.) The point is that a practical edition should embody some reliable text, and, if such a text exists, the publisher of a practical edition should be encouraged to lease it rather than reprint, with no rationale, whatever previous text comes most readily to hand. 7 Some works of this kind may be of such importance that they will be frequently quoted; in these cases it may be more convenient to have a clear text (with variant readings recorded at the end), even at the sacrifice of the basic texture of the original. This sort of decision, involving a weighing of what is gained against what is lost, has to be made separately for each individual case. For further comment on this problem, see G. T. Tanselle, "The Editorial Problem of Final Authorial Intention," forthcoming in Bibliographia . 8 I use the term "finished piece of writing" rather than "literary work" in order to include historical, technical, and scientific writings or any other work completed for publication or of a type usually intended for publication. 9 Another use of symbols in the text, convenient in certain situations in practical editions, is to draw the student's attention to important revised passages. In the Signet Typee (ed. Harrison Hayford, 1964), passages which Melville deleted in the revised American edition of 1846 are enclosed in square brackets, and those which he revised are both bracketed and numbered, with the revised wording given at the end of the volume according to the reference numbers. 10 "Old-Spelling Editions of Dramatic Texts," in Studies in Honor of T. W. Baldwin , ed. D. C. Allen (1958), p. 14. 11 The question takes a slightly different form for practical editions, since it may be felt that a classroom edition with little apparatus except explanatory notes should offer those notes as easily accessible footnotes. It is perhaps true that more students will read them as footnotes, but the price paid for this attention is a high one: not simply the distraction from the text (which is after all more important for the students to read), but the cumulative psychological effect of always (or nearly always) encountering classic works encased in an obtrusive editorial framework which sets them apart from other books read outside of class. Sometimes it is objected that references to line numbers are awkward and inconvenient when side-numbers counting the lines do not appear on the text pages. Side-numbers have been so widely used in connection with poetry that they probably constitute little distraction there (and thus do not prevent a poetic text from being "clear"); but their presence on a page of prose remains an intrusion and lends the page a "textbook" air. The psychological advantages of clear text, therefore, can be said to compensate for the minor inconvenience of having to count lines. 12 The use of parallel texts is often a more sensible way of exhibiting complicated revisions than to present one established text with the revisions recorded in apparatus; besides, some complex revisions result in what amounts to a different work, so that both forms of the work deserve to be presented as texts in their own right. Placing two texts in parallel columns or on facing pages is in itself a kind of apparatus; but, except for that, the comments made here about the texts of other editions would also apply to the individual texts of a parallel-text edition. 13 Indeed, sometimes the apparatus appended to a text is more important to scholars than the text itself, since, if it is well done, it provides the evidence on which other editions can be constructed by editors who do not agree with the interpretation of the evidence represented in that particular edition. A good example of an apparatus presented as a piece of research in its own right is Matthew J. Bruccoli's "Material for a Centenary Edition of Tender is the Night," SB, 17 (1964), 177-93. 14 Even a facsimile or a diplomatic edition of one particular impression of a work or one particular copy of an impression is based on a decision to present a given text and cannot be approached with the attitude that "it makes very little difference what text is printed in extenso ." 15 Since the basic goal of an edition is to establish a text rather than to present an apparatus, the effect which the text makes would apparently—if it comes to a choice—be given somewhat more weight than the convenience with which the apparatus can be located. 16 Both because one knows less readily where to turn to find the apparatus and because comparative study involving several works requires more extensive page-turning. In addition, the editor may have practical reasons for preferring a single block of apparatus at the end, since it enables him to key all his apparatus to page proof at one time. If sections of apparatus are scattered through a volume, the process is inevitably less efficient; for if the editor gets galleys first, he must wait to key the apparatus for his second text until the apparatus for his first has been made into pages, so that the pagination of the second text is known, and so on through the volume; and if the editor receives pages directly, then the apparatus must be set up with blank references ("00.00") and all the figures later altered. 17 Considerations of the ease with which individual texts and apparatus can be reproduced photographically have little relevance here, for even when the apparatus immediately follows the work the pagination would be appropriate for separate issue only for the first work in the volume; and when pagination must be altered in any case, there would be no additional problem in taking the apparatus from the end of the volume and altering its page numbers also. A real problem might arise, of course, if the apparatus for a given work were not presented as a unit and if apparatus pertaining to other works appeared on some of the same pages; but there is no reason why apparatus at the end of a volume cannot be so arranged as to avoid this problem. (See the following paragraph and footnote 18.) 18 Some extra space is required, of course, for the additional headings which would be needed. Further space would generally be used if one always began the section for a given work on a new page, in an attempt to facilitate photoreproduction of an individual text with its apparatus (see footnote 17). But if only a few long texts were involved, little space would be wasted in this way, while for shorter texts, such as essays, stories, and poems (where more space might be wasted, since more of these works could be included in a volume), there would be less reason to accommodate photoreproduction, because less demand exists for separate reprints of individual short works. There would be little reason, in other words, for beginning the apparatus to each work on a new page except when a volume contains only two or three long works. 19 Bowers's Dekker employs this system, though the situation is somewhat different since the record of substantive emendations appears as footnotes. It is also used by Matthew J. Bruccoli in "Material for a Centenary Edition of Tender is the Night," SB , 17 (1964), 177-93, but again there are special circumstances since here the apparatus is presented independently of the text. And the Virginia Crane edition uses the " stet " system even though the list of emendations follows the textual notes. 20 Still another arrangement is employed in the first volume of the Simms edition, where the list of emendations and the textual notes are merged: that is, whenever a reading requires comment, the comment is inserted at the appropriate point in the list of emendations. The advantage, of course, is a reduction in the number of separate sections of apparatus, so that the reader is involved in less cross reference between sections. But, as usually happens when notes are tied to a list of emendations, some entries for unemended readings have to be included in the list. Furthermore, there is the danger that the insertion of blocks of discursive material into the list will make the list less easy to follow; in the case of the first Simms volume, the number of notes is small enough that this difficulty does not arise to any significant extent, but it remains a possibility when there is a considerable number of notes—and when the number is small, the notes may actually prove less readily accessible if imbedded in a list. Finally, difficulties of design in joining paragraphs and lists (as when lengthy notes must be accommodated to a double-column page designed primarily for listed items) provide an additional argument against using this system under ordinary circumstances. 21 The Cambridge Dekker and Beaumont-Fletcher editions also place the textual notes immediately after the text, but in effect these notes follow the substantive emendations, since the substantive emendations are recorded in footnotes on text pages. 22 The positions of various other special lists which may be required are commented on below, at the points where these lists are discussed. 23 Though incidentally it does list the substantive ones, since each entry has to be keyed to the reading which appears in the edited text. 24 In the Dewey edition, both a textual introduction and a historical introduction precede the text; but the pages on which they appear are numbered with small roman numerals, and this sequence of pagination is resumed at the back of the volume for the remainder of the apparatus. This arrangement thus makes it simple, in other printings or photographically reproduced sub-editions, to bring all the editorial matter together. 25 In the Wesleyan Fielding, though the textual apparatus is at the end of the volume, the explanatory notes are placed at the bottom of the text pages (keyed to footnote numbers in the text). 26 McKerrow was clearly aware of this feeling and admits that compression was his principal consideration: "I may say here that the conventions, which at first sight may appear somewhat complicated and even perverse, have only been adopted after careful thought and experiment, and actually do—at least in my deliberate opinion—make it possible to give all necessary facts in the minimum of space" (p. 77). 27 In both cases, however, some of the symbols do not follow the same system. In The Scarlet Letter , the first two editions are designated not by roman numerals but by "18501" and "18502"; and in Their Wedding Journey the serial publications are referred to as "S1" and "S2" (chronologically S1 would precede A, and S2 would follow C). Both editions use the mnemonic symbol "MS" for manuscript texts, and the Hawthorne uses "E" to distinguish English editions. In the Wesleyan Joseph Andrews , the five editions published during Fielding's lifetime are designated by simple arabic numerals, 1 through 5. 28 The system referred to in Mahomet , p. 584, note 17, as the standard system for the Irving edition uses such symbols as "1A1, "1A2," etc. It is difficult to decide whether the mnemonic value of these symbols is greater than that of symbols incorporating references to years; but under most circumstances of any complexity, symbols which employ the last two digits of the year (instead of the second figure here) and initials of publishers (when more than one publisher in a given country is involved) are probably easier to remember. 29 Of course, if a variant in punctuation were not involved, the punctuation would not be included in the reading at all; but the fact that it is included does not rule out the possibility that a spelling variant also exists at this point. 30 As stated above, editions of manuscript material which attempt to show stages of composition may require more elaborate sets of symbols (including perhaps angle brackets for canceled matter and vertical arrows for insertions, both of which have been fairly widely used); but the general principles for evaluating symbols outlined here would still apply. (Useful examples of symbols for editing manuscripts are found in the Hayford and Sealts Billy Budd and in the Emerson and the Irving journals.) It should be noted that complicated alterations in a manuscript can also be set forth in verbal descriptions, without any symbols at all, as in the Ohio State House of the Seven Gables and in the California Hannibal, Huck &amp; Tom and Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts . Fredson Bowers, in his review of the New York Public Library edition of Walt Whitman's Blue Book (ed. Arthur Golden), makes some comments on the relative merits of the two approaches and finds Golden's method an uneconomical mixture of the two—see JEGP , 68 (1969), 316-20. 31 A sensible convention which has become well established is to use periods to separate the elements of these reference numbers (e.g., "240.17" or "III.ii.75"). All references in the apparatus should obviously be to the edited text (though in the textual essay a discussion of type damage or defective inking in an early edition might well involve page-line references to that edition). 32 A space, for example, would suffice; or, as in the Howells edition, the reading itself need not be cited, since the discussion can be constructed so as to make clear what word or words in the cited line are in question. 33 It might not literally waste a particular reader's time if a given fact, though easily ascertainable in the dictionary, were not already known to him. But an editor cannot pitch his annotation at his text's least informed reader, even if he could discover who that is; some minimum level must be recognized, and it seems reasonable to say that spellings or usages readily discoverable in standard dictionaries fall below that level. (Explanatory, as opposed to textual, annotation is of course a different matter; in an explanatory note it may well be useful to have a brief identification of a historical figure, even though he is listed in the basic biographical reference works. The essential difference is that historical allusions, however numerous, are manageable in number and affect one's understanding of the meaning of the text, whereas the kind of textual notes ruled out here might logically involve half or more of the individual words of a text and by definition would not raise such special problems as interpretation or meaning.) 34 As opposed to those which may be classed, for one reason or another, as nontextual—about which more is said below. 35 Often each of these entries is placed on a separate line, but sometimes, to save space, they are run on in paragraph form (a form which makes individual entries somewhat less easy to locate). 36 Nontextual changes—those affecting the design of the document embodying the copy-text but not the text itself—may of course be made silently. But to make textual changes silently, even though the categories of such changes are announced and discussed in the textual essay, is to deny the principle that it is risky to allow the absence of a positive designation to be significant (cf. the comments on the caret above). Thus, in the Melville example, merely informing the reader that "-our" spellings are changed to "-or" does not allow him to reconstruct the copy-text with the certainty he would have if he could follow an actual list of changes; for he could not be sure that every "-or" word in the edited text was originally "-our," whereas with a list he would know explicitly just where the changes were made. Furthermore, the specific instances of any type of textual alteration, however trivial they may seem, may be of particular concern to some linguistic, literary, or historical scholar, and the burden of locating these instances should not be placed on the user of the text but is rather the editor's responsibility. 37 The same principle is followed in the Ohio State Fanshawe and the California Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts , where a number of groupings of identical changes in accidentals are made; here, however, the references are cited in paragraph form in the list of emendations at the point of first occurrence of each type. To some extent this arrangement disrupts the smooth sequential flow of the list of emendations and makes it somewhat less easy to follow; but there is no doubt that it is an advantage to the reader to have these groups of identical emendations brought together somewhere. 38 It is used, for example, in the Fielding, Hawthorne, and Crane editions. 39 Only if the source of the emendation were the editor himself or the last of the collated editions could the reader know that no additional information would be found in the historical collation. 40 In the Howells edition, when editions later than the one from which an emendation is taken agree with that edition, the complete history is implied in the entry. But when a later edition reverts to the reading of the copy-text, that further history is not offered in the emendations list. See footnote 66. 41 Of course, editors of facsimile or diplomatic editions are necessarily concerned with formal and typographical matters and must take them into account. 42 See G. T. Tanselle, "The Meaning of Copy-Text: A Further Note," SB , 23 (1970), 191-96. 43 Nontextual details often play a great role in the bibliographical analysis which leads to the establishment of the text (as when wrong-font types allow a bibliographer to learn something about the timing of the distribution of type from preceding formes or about the order of formes through the press), but they are nevertheless not a part of the text. 44 With the exception that, when all variants are manifestly incorrect and their order is indeterminate (as in the example cited in footnote 48), designating only one of them as the copy-text reading becomes a pointless exercise. (In the case of a manuscript copy-text, of course, alternative uncanceled readings may well exist at individual points.) 45 Thus Bowers, in the general textual introduction to the Cambridge Beaumont and Fletcher, defines the copy-texts as embodying the readings of corrected formes: "The normal assumption is that the present edited text reproduces the corrected readings when press-variation is present if no contrary record is made" (I,xix). 46 Since a photographic reproduction of a single copy is often used as printer's copy for a critical edition, it follows that not every textual alteration marked on that copy is an emendation in the copy-text, for some may bring the printer's copy into conformity with the copy-text. 47 Some further discussion of this point appears in G. T. Tanselle, "The Use of Type Damage as Evidence in Bibliographical Description," Library , 5th ser., 23 (1968), esp. 347-48. 48 When neither form is correct, as in "t obelieve"/"tobelieve," it makes little difference which is considered the copy-text form, since an emendation is required in either case; in such instances, especially when the order of the variants is not clear, there is no point in choosing among incorrect forms, and both readings might as well be listed as the rejected copy-text readings. 49 Similarly, punctuation following (or preceding) a word need not be cited when only the word, and not the punctuation, is at issue. 50 William Hill Brown, The Power of Sympathy , ed. William S. Kable (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1969). 51 Editorial comments of this kind should of course be enclosed in square brackets to show that they are not actual readings; italicizing them is usually not sufficient, since italic words could appear in the text. 52 In other words, the letters do not stand for general stages of revision or alteration but refer only to the sequence at a given point. Thus there is no reason to suppose that one reading labeled "A55 b " occurred at the same time or in the same process of revision as another with the same label; all that the symbol implies is that these are the second readings at each of these points. 53 In the Ohio State edition of The Scarlet Letter and in his paper before the South Atlantic Modern Language Association (cited in its 1964 published form in footnote 4 above). 54 And obviously, if the reader is accurately to reconstruct the copy-text from the critical text, he must have this information for interpreting the critical text. 55 If a possible compound coincidentally hyphenated at the end of a line in both the copy-text and the critical text is not recorded in a separate list, then it would appear in both these lists, and to that extent words involving editorial decisions might appear in the critical-text list. But their presence there has nothing to do with the fact that their established forms result from editorial decisions; they are there only because they are hyphenated at the ends of lines in the critical text. The fact that editorial decisions are involved can be learned only by noting the reappearance of the same words in the copy-text list. 56 Of course, an editor could insist that the lines of the text be reset until no hyphen which should be retained in quotation fell at the end of a line; in practice, this approach is often prohibitively expensive and, in some cases, virtually impossible of achievement. 57 And if the editor feels that it is of some help to the reader to have such words noted, a symbol can be placed beside those words which appear in both lists. (The Melville edition uses a dagger for this purpose.) 58 And emphasizing this division helps to make clear—as removing the critical-text list to another location would make still clearer—why some words turn up in two lists: since the critical-text list has nothing to do with editorial decisions, any word in it which in fact results from an editorial decision must naturally be found also in one of the two lists which record editorial decisions—the list of emendations or the copy-text hyphenation list. 59 It should be clear that the opposite possibility (employed in the first volume of the Simms edition)—that is, recording only those instances of possible compounds hyphenated at line-ends in the critical text which should be transcribed as single unhyphenated words—leaves ambiguities unresolved, for the reader still has to distinguish between purely compositorial hyphens, dividing unhyphenated words at line-ends, and the hyphens which should in fact be retained. (Of course, listing every line-end hyphen which should be eliminated in transcription—the only way to make this approach unambiguous—would be foolishly inefficient, since the majority of line-end hyphens in any printed work normally fall into this category, and the list would be extended inordinately.) 60 Of course, what remains is actually made up of two categories: possible compounds which, by editorial decision, should not contain hyphens, and words which are not possible compounds and which naturally do not contain hyphens. 61 Because the functions of these lists are not always grasped at first by the general reader, it is important that the headnote to each list not make the lists sound more complicated than they are. For the copy-text list, nothing more is needed than a statement of this kind: "The following are the editorially established forms of possible compounds which were hyphenated at the ends of lines in the copy-text." And for the critical-text list: "In quotations from the present edition, no line-end hyphens are to be retained except the following." 62 The simplest form is merely to list, following the appropriate page-line number, the word in its established form. Since the place where line-end division occurred is obvious in most cases, there is usually no need to mark it with a vertical line. Of course, when the point of division is not obvious—as in a compound with three elements and two hyphens—a vertical line can be used; but even then the vertical line is useful only in the copy-text list, not in the critical-text list. (The Dewey edition, in the critical-text list, gives the word first as a lemma, showing the line-ending with a vertical stroke, and then the established hyphenated form; such repetition does not make the function of the list clearer and indeed would seem to add a needless complication.) Furthermore, in the critical-text list, where every page-line citation would technically contain two line numbers (since each cited word runs over a line-end in the critical text, to which all citations are keyed), the awkwardness of the double-line reference serves no real purpose, and each page-line citation might as well refer simply to the line on which the word begins. 63 Sometimes certain of these entries do in fact provide histories of the readings involved, but that is not their primary function. 64 Certain other editions which, because of their wide popularity or impressive scholarship, have been influential in the history and study of the text may also be included in the historical collation, even though the variant readings present in them can carry no authorial sanction; indeed, editions of Elizabethan works often include practically every previous edition in their historical collations and thus provide the complete history of the treatment of the text with regard to substantives. 65 In the Melville edition the historical collation is entitled "List of Substantive Variants." 66 This plan is followed in the Howells edition (note the entries in Their Wedding Journey for 102.28 or in Literary Friends and Acquaintance for 223.23). As a result of the overlapping function of the two lists under this plan, the reader cannot know, when looking at the list of emendations, whether or not any given substantive entry contains the complete history of the variants at that point and must turn to the list of rejected substantives to see if any additional history is recorded there. 67 There might be more than one list with historical emphasis, as discussed below. 68 However, impressions of an edition need not be specified when there are no variants in them. Thus if "A" stands for the only American edition, that symbol alone could signify all the collated impressions of the American edition. But if a variant first shows up in, say, "A1847" (or "A47"), its history will be represented more clearly by "A47-76" than by defining "A47" to include all subsequent collated impressions. The use of inclusive notation, of course, does not result in the appearance of every siglum in each entry, but, when the symbols include mnemonic allusions to years or sequences, the grouping which would include any given siglum is obvious. For convenient reference, a list of all collated editions (or impressions) with their sigla should be included in the headnote to the historical collation (as well as in the headnote to any other sections in which the sigla are used). 69 A related symbol of McKerrow's, the plus-and-minus sign (±), is put to good use in Bowers's Dekker to stand for a general but not exact agreement among several editions, where the minor variations are irrelevant to the main fact which the entry is recording The same method could be applied to the specification of individual editions by enclosing in parentheses those sigla which refer to editions containing the slightly variant readings. (Such a practice would conform to McKerrow's use of parentheses, referred to above, to indicate "a reading which is not identical with one which is given but which is substantially the same in meaning or intention so far as the purpose of the note is concerned" [p. 82].) Sometimes earlier editions went too far in multiplying symbols of this sort: in the opening volume of the Variorum Shakespeare (1874), for example, Furness employs "&amp;c," " et cet. ," and " the rest " to stand for different groups of editions. Another symbol relevant to the matter of inclusive notation is the dollar sign, which has been borrowed from descriptive bibliography and introduced into textual apparatus by Bowers in the fifth volume of the Crane edition; it is used there to mean "all" or "every" when attached to symbols which subsume a number of documents (such as "N," the syndicated newspaper texts of a given work). The symbol is useful in "$N" to emphasize the fact that all the examined N texts agree and "$N (—N 4 )" to reinforce the statement that all but one agree; but since "N" is already a generic symbol, defined as all the examined newspaper texts, the dollar sign is essentially a device for adding emphasis rather than for condensing the statement. 70 Even in such a case, a variant at a point of emendation is somewhat awkward, since the reading in the edited text must be cited as the key for the entry, and it is different in these instances from the first-column (copy-text) reading. 71 It would be highly undesirable to have a situation in which a reading from a third edition had to be placed in a third column, even though it agreed with the reading in one of the other two editions; such an arrangement would make it more difficult for the reader to note agreements among editions and would open up more possibilities for typographical errors in the list. 72 Sigla in these lists would refer to particular copies of books, not just to particular impressions. 73 These lists do not record the complete history of the variants listed, for their function is only to note that the variants were present in a particular edition and are not adopted in the critical text. (Strictly speaking, therefore, no sigla at all would be required in such lists.) 74 When only a brief manuscript fragment survives, it can be treated either in a separate list (as "The Ohio State University Leaf" in The Blithedale Romance ) or in a complete transcription with accompanying apparatus (as in the Northwestern-Newberry Typee, Mardi , and White-Jacket ). 75 Placing all such lists immediately after the basic historical collation helps to make clear that they are parts of the historical record, appendixes in a sense to the historical collation. (The attempt to make the list of emendations serve as a partial historical collation is not an extension of the principle that certain categories within the historical collation can be conveniently separated, for it mixes the functions of the lists; all these special supplementary lists are purely historical in function.) Sometimes certain of these lists—especially those dealing with variants within an impression—are placed first in the apparatus, since they often deal with material which chronologically precedes that taken up in other lists; but chronology is not the general basis for the organization of the apparatus as a whole, and readers can probably find their way around in an extensive apparatus more easily if the arrangement is based on the distinct functions of the several lists.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Shakespeare's Merchant Of Venice in Sixty-Three Editions by Christopher Spencer</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With textual material collected for the New Variorum edition of The Merchant of Venice and with the assistance of a computer, the following study analyzes the readings of sixty-three editions of The Merchant from the First Quarto (1600) to the text prepared by G. Blakemore Evans for the forthcoming New Riverside edition. 1 It shows the degree to which each of the sixty-three editions was dependent upon its various predecessors in substantive readings and in accidentals, and it also shows the quantity and kind of contribution that has been made by each edition to the text of the play in terms both of its new readings and of its contributions to the modern text. The study also lays out the pattern of the historical development of the text with sixty-three points of reference and in the different terms provided by several sets of statistics. The results supplement existing opinion, and the study gives an account of the various editions and a history of the text in much more specific terms than has heretofore been practicable. The Merchant seems a fairly satisfactory play for a study of this kind. Since there are three quarto editions, two of which precede the First Folio, it has a more varied textual history during the seventeenth century than the eighteen of Shakespeare's plays that were not published before the Folio. On the other hand, the early texts of The Merchant are not independent: the differences among them are minor compared with the variations among quarto and First Folio texts of such plays as Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet , and The Merchant presents few special and no great problems for the editor. 2 The sixty-three editions on which this study is based consist of a group that have generally been collated by New Variorum editors (H. H. Furness, H. H. Furness Jr., S. B. Hemingway, M. A. Shaaber, H. N. Hillebrand, and M. W. Black), with additions and a few omissions resulting from the experience of G. B. Evans with I Henry VI and Richard Knowles with As You Like It , and from my own investigations. 3 Seven of the sixty-three are from the seventeenth century, 18 from the eighteenth, 24 from the nineteenth, and 14 from the twentieth. Of the 56 critical editions beginning with Rowe, 43 were prepared by British editors, 12 by American editors, and one by a German editor. The readings of the sixty-three editions are recorded for 2583 passages in The Merchant . These are the variants remaining in the second stage of my preparation of the textual annotation for the New Variorum edition. 4 Originally I recorded readings for about five thousand variant passages and included almost all punctuation and many spelling differences. In revising this material I omitted most of the spelling and many of the punctuation variants and excluded also non-substantive changes in stage directions, thereby reducing the number of passages by about half. There remained 2583 variants in a play of 2658 lines. 5 For the purposes of this study the variants are classified in ten categories and two values. The categories are: verbal differences (621 variants); characters' names (42); 6 punctuation (1000); 7 lineation (59); stage directions, scene divisions, and locales (196); transpositions (37); non-metrical word forms (125); metrical variations (388); spelling (106); and miscellaneous (9). Of the 2583 variants, 457 were considered major (substantive) and the remaining 2126 minor. 8 The computer produced two series of tables. One series consisted of a table for each of the sixty-two editions after Q1, listing the number of times the edition agreed uniquely with each of its predecessors and the total number of times the edition agreed with each of its predecessors; the tables recorded this information for each of the values. The second series of eight tables tabulated the number of new readings initiated by each of the sixty-three editions in each of the ten categories for each of the values (it also gave totals for each of the editions, categories, and values). Furthermore, this series gave the number of these new readings (for each edition in each category in each value, and with totals) that appear in Evans' edition and in Peter Alexander's edition of 1951. 9 The first series of tables showed the dependence of each edition upon its predecessors; the second series showed the contribution of each edition to the developing and to the modern text of the play. The three tables given below are composed of information from the seventy tables supplied by the computer and are designed to give the information in compact and emphatic form.

      <field name="fulltext">The foregoing table lists the sixty-three editions with the number of new readings originated by each edition in toto and in the different categories. The second column lists the total number of new readings, the third column the number of those new readings that appear in Evans, and the fourth column the number that appear in Alexander. The fifth column records the new readings in the 457 variant passages, and the figure in parentheses indicates how many of those major new readings appear in Evans' edition. The other eight columns tabulate the new readings in each category (followed, in parentheses, by the number of those readings that appear in Evans). Where there is no figure in parentheses in columns five through thirteen, there are no new readings in Evans. Because the numbers for transposition, 10 miscellaneous, word form, and spelling variants are small and comparatively lacking in significance, these four categories have been combined into two. 11 Character Punctuation Lineation SDD etc. Tr. &amp; Misc.

Thus, of Evans' readings in the 2583 passages recorded, 1479 come from the authoritative text (Q1), 465 from other seventeenth-century editions, 425 from eighteenth-century editions, 116 from nineteenth-century editions, 81 from other twentieth-century editions, and 17 from no previous text collated. Alexander follows the authoritative text less often (1354 times), uses more from other seventeenth-century editions (540), more from the eighteenth century (515), about the same amount from the nineteenth century (114), and less from his twentieth-century predecessors (43); he too seems to originate 17 readings. In 457 major variants, Evans follows Q1 370 times, other seventeenth-century texts 31 times, eighteenth-century texts 37 times, nineteenth-century texts 12 times, previous twentieth-century texts 6 times, and no text collated once. After 1700, the largest number of new readings was originated by Rowe in his three editions (401), followed by Capell (330), Pope (298), Theobald (239), New Cambridge (200), New Arden (175), Collier (128), and Dyce (121). The largest number adopted by Evans was originated by Rowe (115), followed by Capell (102), Theobald (84), Pope (61), and Johnson (34); the same five editors supplied the largest number used by Alexander. One edition originated no new readings (Old Cambridge II), and nine more editions contributed no new readings used by either Evans or Alexander (Johnson-Steevens II, Boswell-Malone, Hudson II, Rolfe II, Oxford, Old Arden, London, New Yale, and New Cambridge II). Only sixteen editions supplied more than one major reading (in 457 passages) adopted by Evans: Q1, Q2, F1, F2, Q3, F4, Rowe I, Pope I, Theobald I, Johnson, Capell, Knight, Collier I, Hudson I, Old Cambridge I, and New Cambridge I. (The list for Alexander would add Malone and exclude Hudson I and New Cambridge I.) F3 contributed no reading in a major passage to either Evans or Alexander. Of eighteenth-century editors, Rowe in his three editions supplied the most new readings in verbal variants (95) and the most adopted by Evans (13); Pope in his two editions contributed 86 (10 adopted); and Capell added 42 (8 adopted). In the nineteenth century Collier originated 30 in two editions (most of the 24 in Collier II are from the Perkins Folio) with one adopted, and Eccles, Dyce, and Keightley invented ten or more; the largest number adopted (three) was supplied by the Old Cambridge editors. The New Cambridge edition and Sisson have added the most new verbal readings in the twentieth century. In characters' names Rowe (16) and Capell (15) have added the most, with little contribution from others. In punctuation, Capell (170), Theobald (159), and Rowe (146) originated the most readings, and the same three in a different order (Theobald, Capell, Rowe) contributed the most to Evans' text. In lineation, Pope and Capell supplied the largest number of new readings and the largest number of contributions to the modern text. In stage directions, scene divisions, and locales, Rowe, Capell, Theobald, Pope, and Dyce have originated most; and Rowe, Capell, Theobald, Dyce, and Old Cambridge have contributed most to modern texts. 13 In every category, the quartos, folios, and eighteenth-century editors supplied the basic material, with fewer additions during the nineteenth century; new readings have appeared in the twentieth century but have not yet become established in the text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II By recording wholly new readings, Table I emphasizes the originality of editors; it favors those who were early enough not to be anticipated, and it looks forward to their lasting contributions to the text of the play. Table II notices the reintroduction or unconventional use of an old reading, thereby giving a broader base for evaluating an edition's individuality. It looks backward as well as forward, showing where an editor may have gotten most of the readings he did not invent and, at the same time, which editions supplied the most readings for their successors.

The fifth and sixth columns give the highest and second highest number of total agreements (unique and shared with one or more earlier or intervening editions) with any previous edition. The columns of unique agreement suggest both the extent to which an editor used readings that were not yet established and the degree to which he influenced his successors. Editions from Hanmer II to Eccles borrowed from Capell, some of them quite heavily, although none was actually based upon Capell. Pope, Johnson, Capell, Malone, Singer I, Knight, and the Old Cambridge editors went back to Q2 for readings not used since 1619 (as they thought, since 1600); and Ridley and New Yale adopted readings not used since Q1. Many later editors have borrowed from Johnson: unique agreements are shown in the table for Capell, Johnson-Steevens I, Collier I, Keightley, New Cambridge I and II, and New Arden; and unique agreements not listed appear in Hanmer II (2), Johnson-Steevens II (3), Rann (1), Steevens-Reed I (1), Hudson I (2), Neilson (6), Sisson (2), and London (1). In the fourth column — the number of editions with which there is unique agreement — Capell (9), Rowe (8), and Malone (8) are higher than their predecessors or contemporaries; Old Cambridge I and Hudson II with 12 and Collier I and Keightley with 10 are high for the nineteenth century; and New Cambridge I is most eclectic by far with unique agreements with 20 editions, followed by New Arden (13) and Sisson and Neilson (11). For the non-critical texts of the seventeenth century and for many critical editions (especially those that are early and those for which the figures in the table are high), the largest number of shared readings shows the edition used as base text. 14 However, as the text of the play becomes more established during the nineteenth century and there are more editions with less variation among them, this figure is a less reliable guide. The texts showing the least variation are often the second and third editions. Rowe II agrees with Rowe I in 2558 of 2583 instances, and there are, therefore, only 25 differences among the variants included in the tabulation. Similarly, Pope II differs from Pope I 28 times, Hanmer II from Hanmer I 165 times, Globe from Old Cambridge I 63 times, New Cambridge II from New Cambridge I 55 times, and so on. 15 However, Hudson II and White II are markedly independent of their first editions: the former agrees more frequently with four other editions than with Hudson I (2112 agreements), and the latter more frequently with six other editions than with White I (2159 agreements). Only four critical editions have fewer than 2000 agreements with any single predecessor: in the eighteenth century Capell with 1776 and in the twentieth New Cambridge I with 1856, Sisson with 1963, and New Arden with 1971. In Capell 807 readings (31 percent) had not appeared in the closest text (Warburton); and, according to Table I, 330 readings (13 percent) had not appeared anywhere previously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Table II provides insight into an edition's relationship to those of its predecessors from which it borrowed most, but only occasionally does the table suggest anything of the edition's relationship to the authoritative text (Q1) and the two principal early derivative editions (Q2 and F1). Table III, which records agreement for sixty-two editions with the three earliest texts, gives data on these relationships and, at the same time, outlines the historical development of the text of The Merchant , showing its departure from and then its return, to a limited degree, toward the early editions.

The closest agreement with Q1 in the seventeenth century is in Q3 with only 40 disagreements in major readings (457 minus 417), in the eighteenth century Malone with 124 disagreements, in the nineteenth century Collier I and Halliwell with 112 disagreements, and in the twentieth century New Yale with 65 disagreements. The low marks of agreement with Q1 by century are F4 (153 disagreements), Hanmer I and II (228 disagreements and 229 agreements), Eccles (151 disagreements), and Rolfe III (120 disagreements). The third column shows that after Rowe III and with the exception of only four modern editions, no text agrees with Q1 in even half the minor variants recorded. The same may be said for Q2 from Theobald I to Rolfe III (except two editions) and for F1 from Warburton to Rolfe III (except three editions). This table also shows that textual theory had only occasional influence upon editorial practice before the twentieth century, and that it has had some effect on both major and minor readings in modern editions. All editions since Pope have more major variant readings in common with Q1 than with Q2, despite the fact that before 1909 it was usually thought that Q2 was the earlier and the better text. 16 Even the Old Cambridge editors, with their strong support of Q2, actually used more major readings from Q1, though their respect for Q2 exceeded that of their contemporaries. 17 In recent years there has been a significant gain for Q1 over Q2 and F1, presumably because modern editors are certain that Q1 is the substantive text. In minor variants agreement with Q2 more frequently than with Q1 has been the rule since 1685, with the exceptions of only the New Arden and New Yale editions. Doubtless this situation results from the more modern accidentals in Q2 and the fact that the modernizing editor usually is not obligated to preserve the accidentals of an early text, as he is to preserve its substantive readings. Nevertheless, New Arden and New Yale have used more from Q1 than from Q2, and most modern editors have preserved substantially more minor readings from the early editions than did their nineteenth-century predecessors. The data support Fredson Bowers' generalization that among modern editions "a steady move has been observable towards the purification of the text, less in the direction of independent emendation, or the introduction of brand-new readings, than towards the restoration of original readings wrongly emended by eighteenth-century editors and subsequently established as traditional." 18</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV The data confirm the accepted view that Q2, Q3, and F1 are based upon Q1. In 2583 readings (Table II) Q2 departs from Q1 592 times (2583 minus 1991), whereas F1 departs from Q1 500 times and Q3 departs from Q1 434 times. The larger number of variants in Q2 may be accounted for as the work of Jaggard's Compositor B, who, as D. F. McKenzie has shown, seems to have been responsible for the quarto. 19 In major variants (Table III) Q2 introduces differences in only 101 of the 457 passages where the full textual history of the play shows editorial disagreement (457 minus 356), whereas F1 has variants in only 92 such passages. Since there are 17 unique agreements in major readings between Q2 and F1, 20 it follows that F1 adds 75 new major disagreements to the 101 originated by Q2: 176, then, of the 457 major variant passages originated in the second and third editions of the play, whereas 281 were added by later editors. According to Table III every edition before Ridley (except F1 and Q3) departed from Q1 more often in major variants than did Q2. A few words might be said for Q3, which was published in 1637 by the son of the man who had published Q1, Laurence Hayes. Furness called Q3 "merely a careless reprint of a careless book," 21 and other editors have had little to say about it. Although Q3 does have a number of typographical errors and some lines seem to have shifted and some letters to have dropped out, Furness' judgment needs qualification. From Table III it appears that Q3 is a more faithful reprint of Q1 than either Q2 or F1 — especially in major variants, where Q3 departs from Q1 40 times, in contrast with Q2's 101 and F1's 92 departures. Although Q3 originated fewer new readings than Q2, F1, or F4 (Table I) and although Evans and Alexander retain only 41 and 49 (respectively) readings that originated in Q3, editors have frequently come into agreement with Q3. Thus, Rowe I has 29 unique agreements with Q3, Rowe III has 6, Theobald I 10, Theobald II and III 2 each, 22 Hanmer I 3, Ridley 4, and New Yale 3. Sixteen other editions, have unique agreements with Q3 that are not listed in Table II, including F3 (6), F4 (24), Pope I (8), Capell (6), and New Cambridge (3). Perhaps editors have actually borrowed from Q3 on occasion; but the agreements are more likely to be accidental, and the large number of unique agreements probably results from Q3's being outside the main stream of development (from Q1 through the Folios to Rowe, etc.), so that revival of a Q3 reading is possible when an editor makes a fresh departure from Q1. Although Q3 has no authority, it is still an early reprint that should be of interest to editors. 23 In general, the data given above confirm the conclusions of M. W. Black and M. A. Shaaber in their study of Ff2-4. 24 In F2 there are 119 new readings, 58 of which (49 percent) are verbal; in F3 there are 81 new readings, 32 of which (40 percent) are verbal; and in F4 there are more new readings (225) without a corresponding increase in verbal changes (37; 16 percent), whereas there are many more punctuation variants (162; 72 percent). According to Table II, F2 departs from F1 only 171 times (2583 minus 2412), F3 from F2 only 169 times, and F4 from F3 342 times. The very large proportion of verbal changes in F2 and F3, which otherwise follow their base texts closely, suggests deliberate editorial attention as found by Black and Shaaber; but the small total number of changes (compare Q2's 592 and F1's 500 departures from Q1 and Rowe I's 462 departures from F4) indicates that the editorial attention was on a limited scale. Black and Shaaber found fewer verbal and more punctuation variants in F4 than in F2 and F3, although not as many of the latter as my data suggest. The emphasis on metrical changes that Black and Shaaber found in F2 is not reflected in my data, largely because I counted as verbal a number of alterations that they considered metrical. 25 Since 1700, Rowe and Capell have contributed most to the text of The Merchant . As the first critical editor, Rowe had the opportunity and made good use of it; Capell, coming after the material had been reworked several times, created his own opportunity and made even better use of it. 26 Next after these two in contributions come Pope, Theobald, and Johnson. As the reasonable possibilities have been tried out, the opportunity to find acceptable new readings has shrunk, but in the nineteenth century the Old Cambridge editors made some additions to the text, seconded by Collier and Dyce and then by Knight and Keightley. More eclecticism, originality, and respect for early seventeenth-century readings are characteristic of twentieth-century editors. The first two flower in John Dover Wilson's New Cambridge edition and all three in John Russell Brown's New Arden edition. Neilson, Ridley, Kittredge, Sisson, and A. D. Richardson III's New Yale edition show some of these characteristics to a lesser degree. Alexander and Evans are moderately conservative texts for their age, and London is extremely conservative, its second-highest number of agreements being with the Old Cambridge edition. General conclusions based upon the data for only one play are tentative. However, many of the relationships among folios and among critical editions pointed out above must apply to other plays as well. One might speculate that where there are considerable differences among early texts of a play with a large number of important alternative readings, a study such as this might set off much more sharply one editor's dependence on another for minor variants and at the same time show a greater cross-fertilization among editors in major variants. Thus, many of the same characteristics might appear, but in exaggerated form. Chief among the factors that seem likely to influence the data for other plays are the existence of two or more independent or partially independent early editions; the nature and quality of the authoritative text(s); and the presence of special problems (such as the "Sallies" in The Merchant ). The data for individual editions seem likely to vary significantly from one play to another as a result of these conditions or such others as different editors for different plays (e.g., New Arden), different base texts for different plays (e.g., Johnson), an editor's bestowing more care upon one play than upon another (e.g., F3 and F4), 27 or his publishing his plays over a long period of time (e.g., New Cambridge).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I am grateful to Computer Services of Illinois State University for the use of facilities; to Professor Richard C. Reiter for advice and for writing the program; and to my graduate assistant Joann Laetsch for coding the data. Professor Evans very kindly supplied me with corrected galleys of his text of The Merchant , and my collations were made from them. Most of my collating was done during the academic year 1967-68, when I had the good fortune to hold a Fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. 2 The Merchant was entered in the Stationers Register in July, 1598, by James Roberts with the stipulation that it not be published without the permission of the Lord Chamberlain. It was reentered in October, 1600, by Thomas Heyes with Roberts' consent, and Q1 (1600) was published by Heyes with Roberts as printer. Q1 offers a good text and is generally thought to be printed from clean copy "very close to Shakespeare's own manuscript" (John R. Brown, ed., The Merchant of Venice , 1955, p. xiv). Q2, dated 1600 on the title page, was published in 1619 and is a reprint of Q1. In Shakespeare Folios and Quartos (1909), A. W. Pollard showed that the date 1600 was probably false, and proof of this theory was supplied in the following year by W. J. Neidig, "The Shakespeare Quartos of 1619," MP , 8 (1910), 145-163. Previously most editors had assumed that Q2 was the earlier of the two quartos. It is generally agreed that the F1 text of the play was printed from Q1, although the evidence for this conclusion has been questioned by Hardin Craig, A New Look at Shakespeare's Quartos (1961), pp. 107-108. There was some influence of the playhouse on the Folio text, for it is slightly censored and contains new musical notes. Perhaps the copy of Q1 used for F1 had served as a prompt book, or, more likely, a prompt book was consulted in addition to Q1. 3 "Rough Notes on Editions Collated for I Henry VI ," Shakespearean Research Opportunities , ed. W. R. Elton, No. 2 (1966), 41-48; "Rough Notes on Editions Collated for As You Like It ," SRO , No. 4 (1968/69), 66-72. I conducted partial or spot collations of forty editions to test their value, and seven of them are included among the sixty-three. 4 The variants will probably be further revised for the New Variorum edition. 5 E. K. Chambers, William Shakespeare (1930), II, 398. 6 The names of the "Sallies" are omitted, since they are a problem peculiar to this play and the large number of variants for certain editions would distort some of the statistics. 7 The round number was not anticipated. 8 A computer card was made for each of the 2583 variants. One column was used for each edition. The reading of Q1 was recorded as zero, and every edition that agreed with it was recorded as zero. The earliest edition to disagree with Q1 received a one-punch as did all subsequent editions that agreed with it. The next edition to provide a new reading (if there was another reading) received a two-punch, and so on. It was thus possible to record up to ten different readings for each variant passage. One column was used for recording the value, one for recording the category, and four for recording the line number (according to Through Line Numbering, as used by Charlton Hinman in the Norton facsimile of the First Folio, 1968). The language used was 360 Fortran IV Level G, and the computer was an IBM 360 Mod. 40. 9 These two editions were chosen as recent, moderately conservative texts by single editors, one British and one American. 10 There are 37 transpositions; both Evans and Alexander agree with Q1 in 36 of these and with Q2 once. Often transpositions that appear in later editions were not intentional, but they were recorded in my collations if there seemed any chance that they were intentional or if they were repeated by a later editor. 11 The date of each edition is that of the volume which contains The Merchant . II and III indicate the second or third edition included in this study (not always the second or third edition). Corrected readings were used for Q1 and also for Q3 (see note 23 below). Since the quarto of 1652 (Q4) consists of pages of Q3 with a new title page, it is ignored. Charlton Hinman, The Printing and Proof-reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare (1963), I, 261, found no proof correction in the text of The Merchant . My collations of F1 were based on the Vincent-Sibthorp copy at the Folger Library with consultation of the Yale and Norton facsimiles. My collation of F2 was made from the University of Illinois copy, with consultation of Folger copy 6; no press variants were observed. The Illinois copy was used for F3, with consultation of Folger copy 1; four proof corrections appear in the Illinois copy on sig. O5v, where the page number is corrected from "163" to "166", "Ttribe" is changed to "Tribe," " Shyloc " is altered to " Shylock ," and "it is" becomes "is it" (I.iii.52, 62, 122). The Illinois copy primarily and Folger copy 1 were used for F4; no proof correction was observed. I have ignored the special punctuation marks in Capell's edition, except that where Capell indicates in aside, I have treated his reading as if he had given the stage direction. I have done the same for the New Cambridge edition, but have not included all the rewritten stage directions. 12 There are an excessively large number of metrical variants in Dyce and Old and New Cambridge because these editions used the - ed form where other editions used - 'd . 13 R. B. McKerrow in his British Academy Lecture for 1933, The Treatment of Shakespeare's Text by His Earlier Editors , 1709-1768 , pointed out that The Merchant is the only one of the comedies for which Rowe supplied scene divisions not in the folios and that the divisions correspond in part with those of Granville's adaptation The Jew of Venice (1701). 14 G. B. Evans, "The Text of Johnson's Shakespeare (1765)," PQ , 28 (1949), 425-428, showed that Theobald's edition of 1757 served as the basis of Johnson's text for I Henry VI , and he suggested that it served for a number of other plays as well. Arthur M. Eastman, "The Texts from Which Johnson Printed His Shakespeare," JEGP , 49 (1950), 182-191, concluded that Johnson used Theobald (1757) for twenty-three plays, Warburton for two plays, and both for eleven plays, including The Merchant . 15 Originally, I recorded about one hundred variants between Rowe I and II and about 280 between New Cambridge I and II. However, an unusually large proportion of these were trivial and were omitted when the 5000 variants were reduced to 2583. 16 See the New Variorum edition, ed. H. H. Furness (1888), pp. 275-276. Furness himself thought that Q1 and Q2 were printed from separate transcripts of a stage-copy, with an inferior transcript behind Q1 (Heyes). Although he knew it to be based on Q1, he printed the First Folio text in his own edition (see his Preface and pp. 274-275). In the Forewords to the Griggs-Praetorius facsimiles of Q1 and Q2, F. J. Furnivall maintained that the Heyes quarto was the better text, but he believed that the Roberts quarto was the earlier. 17 The Old Cambridge editors (Vol. II, p. x) thought that though the quartos were printed from the same manuscript, Q2 was more accurate. 18 "Today's Shakespeare Texts, and Tomorrow's," SB , 19 (1966), 43. 19 "Compositor B's Role in The Merchant of Venice ," SB , 12 (1958), 75-90. McKenzie gives a full analysis of the 3200 variants between Q1 and Q2 and rejects the possibility of a reviser other than Compositor B in the speeches. He finds 134 substantive alterations in the speeches in Q2 and thinks that the group of 116 "effective changes . . . does for the most part show the same combination of misdirected ingenuity, deliberate tampering and plain carelessness which Miss Walker has elsewhere found in the work of [Compositor] B." McKenzie discusses punctuation changes in Q2 in "Shakespearian Punctuation—A New Beginning," RES , n.s., 10 (1959), 361-370. 20 This fact is from the computer's table showing the relationship of F1 to each of its (two) predecessors. 21 New Variorum ed., p. 273; see also p. 150. 22 In each of his editions Theobald listed a quarto of The Merchant dated 1637 with a title page and publisher different from those in Q3. He did not list Q3. W. W. Greg, A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration , I (1939), 280, thinks that "presumably the description was based on a faked copy." 23 A collation of Folger copies 1-5 of Q3 shows that proof corrections were made, several of them substantive. For example, in the corrected state of sig. H1v there is a comma after the second "I" in "I wou'd lose all, I sacrifize them all" (IV.i.286): Qq 1-2 and the folios have "I" without the comma, Rowe emended to "I'd," and Pope, who is given credit for the emendation, emended to "Ay," which, with or without the comma, has been used by all subsequent editors. Credit should go to the Q3 corrector. Also, on sig. E4, where Furness (p. 273) calls Q3's emendation of "raine" to "reine" in "In measure reine thy joy" (III.ii.113) a spelling change by the compositor and the "only one real emendation" in Q3, the alteration is really a proof correction, the uncorrected reading (Folger copy 4) being "raine." (Copy 4 is probably uncorrected because in the next line it has "I feel to much" corrected to "too" in copies 1, 2, 3, and 5. There are four other press variants in the inner forme of sig. E, but the others are less conclusive.) Here Johnson conjectured "rein" and was followed by several nineteenth-century editions, including Old Cambridge, and by Neilson and London among modern editions. See Furness, p. 150, for commentary. 24 Shakespeare's Seventeenth-Century Editors 1632-1685 (1937), pp. 95-97. 25 Black and Shaaber, pp. 42-46, 68-69. For The Merchant Black and Shaaber recorded eleven metrical variants for F2, two for F3, and none for F4. Among those which I counted as verbal rather than metrical are F2's omission of "then" in F1's "To intrap the wisest. Therefore then thou gaudie gold" (III.ii.101) and F2's "happier then in this" for F1's "happier then this" (III.ii.163). The first improves but does not by itself succeed in regularizing the meter, and the second actually changes the sense in one of the cruxes of the play. 26 McKerrow, Treatment of Shakespeare's Text , and Alice Walker in her British Academy Lecture of 1960, Edward Capell and His Edition of Shakespeare , have emphasized Capell's contributions. See also Hymen H. Hart, "Edward Capell: The First Modern Editor of Shakespeare" (diss., University of Illinois, 1967) and the author's abstract of it in Shakespeare Newsletter , 17 (1967), 50. 27 In F3 Black and Shaaber found almost twice as many editorial changes per play in the tragedies as in the comedies, and in F4 almost three times as many; they suggested (p. 51) that the lack of interest in the comedies during the Restoration may have been partly responsible. It seems too that during three centuries, if not before 1700, the greater precision of wording and importance of thought expected of the serious plays may have stimulated textual variety, especially in conjunction with texts that are more difficult for other reasons. The number of editorial changes studied by Black and Shaaber in The Merchant was below average for the comedies in F2, slightly above average in F3, and average in F4.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">David Douglas and the British Publication of W. D. Howells' Works by Scott Bennett</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Literary piracy, and complaints about it, were rife in the United States and Great Britain throughout most of the nineteenth century, for there was no copyright agreement between the two countries until 1891. It is not clear what effect such piracy had on the development of American literature, but it is clear that writers and publishers on both sides of the Atlantic suffered commercially from their inability to protect literary property. Their loss is, however, the historian's gain, for the efforts made to compensate for the absence of an international copyright law help illuminate some of the bibliographic, commercial, and personal aspects of the profession of authorship in the nineteenth century. If authors looked on the international copyright situation as a flaw in the routines of their profession, historians can now look at the flaw to better understand the routines. The purpose of this paper is to detail some aspects of the profession of letters in the nineteenth century by describing the efforts of William Dean Howells and his Edinburgh publisher, David Douglas, to protect Howells' literary property in Great Britain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Howells was not one of the leaders in the movement to secure an international copyright law, but he greeted the prospect of one in the Christmas 1890 issue of Harper's Monthly by looking forward to the time when economic justice would finally be done to British authors. American publishers, he imagined, would pay foreign authors not only royalties but also, every year, a Christmas bonus in restitution for past deprivations. To keep these deprivations actively in mind a "Mount Restitution" would be built from old pirated editions, though Howells was afraid that Americans would take a "curious pride in such a colossal witness of the national wrong-doing." 1 He of course knew that the British might well build a similar monument with their own piracies, but — as he had good reason to know — it would have had a significantly different moral foundation. For it had been possible for Americans to protect their literary property under British law, and Howells was one of the writers who had done so. The story of Howells' publications in Great Britain begins with his first successful book, Venetian Life , first published not in America but in London, by Trübner, in 1866. Howells had made the final arrangements for this book on his way home from Venice, where he had been American consul. Trübner also published Italian Journeys in 1867, but from then until 1881 the only other of Howells' books to be published in Britain were the non-fiction Suburban Sketches (Sampson Low, 1871) and The Undiscovered Country (Low, 1880). 2 Howells was evidently little interested in securing a British audience for his novels during the 1870's, when he was establishing himself as a writer of "international" novels. 3 In 1881 Trübner re-enters the picture briefly. In July he sent to the British Museum a sixty-one page pamphlet containing the first serial installment of Howells' Dr. Breen's Practice , to be published in America in the August number of the Atlantic Monthly . 4 The words " English copyright secured " were printed on the wrapper, and they indicate Howells' first attempt to protect his work in Britain. The typesetting of this first part and of the entire book, which Trübner deposited in October, is the same as that used for the James R. Osgood edition in America. A letter of 30 June 1881 to Howells from Osgood, then in London, indicates that the type had been set in America and sheets of the first part sent to Trübner. 5 Thus Howells' first efforts to secure British copyright were made with sheets imported from the United States; for his next novel, and all subsequent ones until 1891, this arrangement was to be turned on its head. During the 1880's the type for Howells' novels was set in Britain and the plates made from it exported to the United States. The next novel was A Modern Instance . At first the procedure was the same as for Dr. Breen's Practice , except that the parts Trübner used for copyright deposit — he sent in only the first and last serial installments of the novel — were not printed from Osgood's type. Trübner evidently had them set himself. But he did not publish the complete book, for it was at this point that David Douglas took over the publication of all of Howells' works in Britain. Douglas had A Modern Instance entirely reset and deposited it by 3 October 1882, with the words " All rights reserved " on the title page. For the next ten years Douglas would be exclusively charged with the protection of Howells' literary property in Great Britain. Howells was indebted to Mrs. Sarah M. Sage and probably to Osgood for his introduction to Douglas. In 1879 Mrs. Sage, an American friend of Douglas, sent him a copy of The Lady of the Aroostook , introducing it as "by our best American Novelist Mr Howells." 6 It was a timely introduction, for Douglas had recently been reading the Literature of the United States since the conclusion of the Civil War. Hitherto I had only known the works of Fenimore Cooper, Washington Irving and perhaps Longfellow and Lowell. Between 1877 and 1882 I had made myself acquainted with the Atlantic Monthly and fixed upon a little book by Mr W. D. Howells' [ sic ] named "A Foregone Conclusion" as a trial or experimental volume. It met with so cordial a reception from our public that I was induced to follow it up with other works of the same author and others recommended by him — there are now . . . 66 vols. (Scrap book) The books Douglas refers to here made up his American Author series, about which more will be said later. The point here is that Douglas had been reading Howells and the magazine Howells edited, and his name surely would have come up when Osgood visited in Edinburgh in the summer of 1881. 7 Though Douglas began to reprint Howells' novels in the spring of 1882, there is no evidence that the two men met personally until May 1883 when Howells wrote his father, from Venice, that "my Edinburgh publisher is here; a very nice old gentleman, whom I like very much, and who is very enthusiastic about my books." 8 Douglas was sixty years old in 1883 and had been a publisher for almost thirty years. Between 1863 and 1869 he had been editor and publisher of the North British Review ; he was to form, along with James Thin and Andrew Elliott, a famous trinity of booksellers in Edinburgh; he was a member of the Antiquaries from 1861 and a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh from 1866; his editions of Scott's Journal and Familiar Letters were probably his most famous publications. As a publisher, his main concern was with Scotland — its history, geography, religion, and architecture; typical of this concern, his lavish publication of David MacGibbon's and Thomas Ross's The Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland (1887-1888) is still used as a reference book in many Scottish architects' offices. Douglas's interest in the literature of the United States was a significant departure from this and was marked by his scrupulous concern for its authors' interests, even when their books could not be protected by copyright. The care with which he practiced his profession was a mark of the man himself, and the letters between Douglas and Howells, written over a period of thirty years, bespeak the most cordial friendship. Howells acknowledged his esteem for Douglas by writing, in 1893, that "English writers seem largely to suspect their publishers . . . I cannot say with how much reason, for my English publisher is Scotch, and I should be glad to be so true a man as I think him." 9</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II David Douglas began to publish Howells' novels in 1882 and it was not until 1913 that he ordered the last reprinting of one of them. His printer's records and the surviving letters between Howells and Douglas indicate, however, that the first of these three decades was the most important one; these were the final years before a copyright agreement was reached between the United States and Great Britain. The story of these years — of the friendship between Howells and Douglas and of their business dealings — must be reconstructed from rather miscellaneous materials, and it is best to divide it somewhat arbitrarily between the two editions that Douglas published of most of Howells' novels. The first of these was a regular octavo trade edition, selling for six shillings a volume, with which Douglas secured British copyright on all of Howells' new fiction in the 1880's. The other edition was printed for Douglas's American Author series; it was smaller in format and sold from one to two shillings a volume. It was with these cheaper editions that Douglas won his greatest success with Howells' works, and they will be discussed in the third section of this paper. One of Howells' purposes was to secure British copyright. The Routledge v. Low case of 1868 had made it possible for aliens to secure British copyright by publishing their work first in Great Britain. The question of a residence requirement at the time of publication had been left unresolved, but in fact prior publication came to be acknowledged as sufficient grounds for copyright. 10 With this in mind, Howells sent copy for each serial installment of his novels sufficiently in advance of its publication in America so that Douglas could set and print that part of the novel for copyright deposit before the magazine appeared in the United States or went on sale in Britain. The result was a set of "books" at the British Museum (some were also sent to the Bodleian and to the Advocates Library in Edinburgh) made up of the several parts and representing technically the first published form of most of the novels Howells wrote in the 1880's. One important question about these volumes is the nature of the copy from which they were set. The first of them, A Woman's Reason , was evidently set from Howells' manuscript. Writing on 16 October 1882 to Osgood about the novel, Howells said that he was "having it stereotyped at Edinburgh, according to my last understanding with you, and I have sent it to New York in print" (Rutgers). Since the first installment of the novel was published in the February 1883 number of the Century Magazine , it is evident that there was ample time for Howells to send his original copy to Douglas and then use Douglas's proofs as copy for the periodical. But after this novel, publishing deadlines were such that Douglas usually had to set his copy from magazine proofs, which he had to have early enough so that each month he could secure copyright before the arrival of the magazine from America. The deadlines for any given novel could give rise to bibliographically complicated situations, such as that of The Rise of Silas Lapham . Pressed by time, Howells sent Douglas a set of the magazine proofs before he had finished revising the novel. The result is that the parts Douglas deposited for copyright contain some unique authorial readings later revised for the magazine. Fortunately, one of the readings that can be recovered from the copyright deposit copies is the passage about dynamite — a sensitive subject in 1885 — that the editor and publisher of the Century Magazine called on Howells to change: "I tell you," says one of Howells' characters, "that in some of my walks on the Hill and down on the Back Bay, nothing but the surveillance of the local policeman prevents me from applying dynamite to those long rows of close-shuttered, handsome, brutally insensible houses." 11 It is beyond the scope of this paper to detail the bibliographical tangles that resulted from Howells' efforts to secure British copyright. They will be reported in the individual volumes of the Howells Edition now being published. It is sufficient here to indicate their existence; that done, we can turn to another aspect, the economic one, of the regular trade editions of Howells' novels in Great Britain. Howells had for some time been able to command higher royalties from his American publishers by owning the plates for his own books, and one of the advantages of his arrangement with Douglas was that the plates could be made more cheaply in Edinburgh than in the United States. Not only were labor costs lower in Edinburgh, but also Howells could recover part or all of his cost from the royalties paid him on the copies Douglas printed from the plates before shipping them to America. Douglas's letter of 12 May 1885, suggesting a minor change in their arrangement, makes clear how it worked: Thanks for the first instalment of Indian Summer which I like very much and shall publish very willingly. My first idea was to insure you something by including it in the shilling series as I have not been able to move off more than 500 copies of the larger size novels, but on consideration I came to the conclusion that though such a shape would make you more popular here yet it would not benefit you in the same proportion — the smaller page &amp; type being of no use to you in "electros" — What I consider would be a fair proposal is that I should let you have a set of electros same as Silas Lapham at Constables price to me plus half the cost of composition — To publish the book at my own expense fixing the price &amp; number of the edition &amp; giving you a royalty upon each copy sold of 10 per cent as I have already done. The difference you will observe is that the plates of Modern Instance &amp; Womans Reason were supplied to you at [illegible word] without any part of the cost of composition being added. If you do not consider this an equitable plan for "Silas Lapham" &amp; "Indian Summer" I shall gladly let you have the plates on the old terms. Thus the arrangement for A Modern Instance and A Woman's Reason had been a conventional one, including the royalty, except that Douglas himself had no use for the plates Howells ordered and paid for. But after these first two books, because Douglas was more interested in his cheaper American Author series than in the regular trade edition, he asked that Howells begin to assume half the cost of composing type for the latter. Douglas had already told Howells (22 November 1884) that the demand for the trade editions of A Modern Instance and A Woman's Reason , of both of which he had printed 1500 copies, was disappointing, and by 5 February 1885 he had only lukewarm encouragement to offer: "You will be glad to hear that I have lost nothing on the whole by taking up your books, and I will add to the trifling royalties due to you a further sum of £20 and hope that the sales of the little volumes [i.e., the American Author series] will not 'dry up' for a year or two yet." In these circumstances, it must have gratified Howells to see that after a print order of only 500 for The Rise of Silas Lapham , Douglas could increase his printing of the trade editions of Indian Summer and the next three of his novels to 1000 copies. 12 Thus, Howells won at least a modest audience in Britain as a result of his arrangement with Douglas for regular trade editions of his novels. This arrangement was maintained for The Minister's Charge , April Hopes , Annie Kilburn , and A Hazard of New Fortunes (except that Douglas printed only 750 copies of the last novel), until the passage of the International Copyright Law of 1891 prohibited the importing of plates for books to be published in the United States. Howells had sent Douglas the first part of An Imperative Duty on 25 April 1891, hoping that the whole could be set and stereotyped in time to get the plates into America before 1 July, when the new law went into effect. Douglas replied on 7 May that he would willingly publish the book and promised to get it set as fast as possible. But they did not beat the July deadline. Indeed, it was not until 20 September that Howells sent copy for the complete book to Douglas, and when on 2 October Douglas wrote to thank him for the proofsheets, he explained "I had already set up 32 pages in fscp 8°. according to your wish but as the new copyright act rendered further introduction of English plates into the States useless I cancelled the pages. It was mainly to afford a set of stereotypes at a less cost than you could get them in New York that I adopted the larger size." Clearly Douglas was not much interested in the market for the regular trade editions of Howells' work and took them on, possibly at a loss to himself, only to accommodate Howells. 13 There is no way now to know whether Douglas did suffer a loss in providing plates for Howells, but the surviving royalty statements indicated how modest the continuing sales of these six-shilling volumes were. The statement sent on 24 January 1893 lists the following sales for 1892; five copies of A Modern Instance , ten of Dr. Breen's Practice , five of A Woman's Reason , three of Indian Summer , one of April Hopes , seven of The Minister's Charge , seven of Annie Kilburn , ten of A Hazard of New Fortunes , six of The Shadow of a Dream , and 614 copies of Mercy — Douglas's title for The Quality of Mercy , which he had published in 1892. It appears then that Howells' novels had a modest initial success but afterwards did not sell; about the only comfort Douglas could offer in sending the statement for 1892 was that he was glad to see that the royalty on the American Author series was "more substantial this year than I was able to make it last, but I find that I can do comparatively little for you with the 6/. volumes." 14 The check Douglas sent with his statement was for £85/17/10, but the royalties due on the trade editions accounted for less than a quarter of the sum. Clearly then it was not the regular trade editions but the cheaper American Author series that accounted for whatever fame or fortune Howells won in Great Britain. For where Douglas may not have been able to sell significantly more than 500 copies of The Rise of Silas Lapham at six shillings, he had by 1893 sold almost a dozen times that number at two to four shillings in his American Author series. It was the cheaper market that Douglas was interested in, the market where in the case of the popular A Chance Acquaintance Douglas could sell 14,000 copies within the first three years after he published it, another 5000 copies in the next seven years, and 10,000 more in the course of the ensuing twenty-one years before April 1913, when the last 1000 copies of the novel were printed for Douglas. The six shilling trade editions are interesting as a part of the effort American writers took to secure copyright in Britain and as presenting sometimes special bibliographical problems, but it is to the American Author series that one must turn for a measure of the popularity of Howells' novels in Great Britain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III In June 1882 Douglas printed his first of Howells' novels, A Chance Acquaintance and A Foregone Conclusion . Both volumes met with so cordial a reception, as Douglas said, that they had to be reprinted during the course of the year. By year's end, Douglas had added to his list A Counterfeit Presentment , Their Wedding Journey , The Lady of the Aroostook , Out of the Question , The Undiscovered Country , and A Fearful Responsibility — and with these eight titles he launched his American Author series. Douglas could hardly have timed their publication better, for Howells' article on Henry James in the November 1882 issue of the Century Magazine was to make its author infamous among British readers. And along with talent, nothing sells books better than controversy. 15 Howells had not been widely read in Britain before the 1880's, so he could hardly appear as anything other than an upstart brother Jonathan when, in the Century Magazine , he dismissed the lares of British fiction while praising his countryman Henry James: "The art of fiction has, in fact, become a finer art in our day than it was with Dickens and Thackeray." 16 It was this assertion and the outrage with which it was greeted that initially shaped Howells' reputation in England. 17 But by 1884 the fuss had subsided enough so that the Temple Bar was ready to recognize Howells' "European reputation" in a review concerned with the new school of fiction Howells had announced, and the Westminster Review suggested that Howells, with the help of his British publisher, might even deserve the recognition he had won: "Mr. Howells has had as friendly a reception from the British public within the past two or three years as he could well wish; the attractions of Mr. Douglas's pocket editions combining with those of the novelist's style, humour, and piquant narrative to lead even temperate novel-readers into prolonged dissipation." 18 The question of Howells' merits aside, Douglas had clearly earned his share of this praise. He printed his American Author series on good paper and bound it in illustrated paper covers at 1s., in printed calico at 1/6, and in a strikingly handsome blue cloth with gilt tops at 2s. per volume. It rankled the Blackwood's reviewer that an American author received such treatment: There stands at the present moment before us a set of charming little books, most creditable in appearance to everybody concerned in their reproduction, with the words "Author's Edition" respectfully printed on the title-page. . . . We hope Mr Howells finds the arrangement in every respect satisfactory; but when we remember not only the absolute want of any equivalent whatever, but even the slobbery broadsheet, like a double number of the "Family Herald," which is the shape in which English fiction is now presented to the American reader, it cannot be that we should view the contrast with the unalloyed satisfaction which we should desire to feel. (Mrs. Oliphant, p. 136) It was not only Howells on whom Douglas lavished his publisher's care, for it was in bringing out other writers (see the list, pp. 123-4 in the same format that he created the American Author series. Howells acted occasionally as Douglas's advisor here, and on 12 November 1883 Douglas wrote to thank Howells for "the great service you have done me in my business by sending the marked index [of the Atlantic Monthly ] which I have already read rapidly over &amp; shall very shortly read all the papers I can get hold of. . . . Your keeping me acquainted with anything good that appears will be of much service." During 1883 and 1884 Douglas added seventeen titles by nine different American authors, describing his intentions to Howells on 5 February 1885 as an endeavor "to give the very best specimens of your literature in the little series &amp; [illegible word] make it of permanent value to our people." 19 Howells' influence is visible in the series; some of the authors were his friends and acquaintance — like Holmes, Curtis, Mitchell, and Aldrich — and it is likely that he would have drawn them to Douglas's attention, as he may also have recommended to him some of the books that came his way in reviewing for the "Editor's Study." 20 If Douglas did not secure all the best American writing for his series, he did publish much that was very good, and with Howells, Cable, Holmes, and John Burroughs represented on the list with several titles each he had reason to be proud of the quality of his series. More than that, the emphasis on local color richly validated the promise of the series' title to be American. It is worth adding, finally, that the surviving evidence indicates that Douglas won the gratitude he deserved for his efforts on behalf of American writers. When, for instance, he brought out a four-volume collection of Holmes' poetry in 1892, he asked Holmes to write a preface for it. He got more than he asked for, as is evident from Douglas's letter about the preface to Holmes on 25 June 1892: "what you say of my work gratifies me extremely, but these words of praise however pleasant to me personally will I fear look egotistical in my own publication. I have always avoided any notice of this Head[?] preferring that the workmanship should speak for itself. If you agree with me perhaps you will delete the second paragraph, which however I am vain enough to tell you I shall preserve in my own private copy." Holmes made the change Douglas asked for but left a still generous compliment intact: "The proposal of Mr. Douglas to print an edition of my Poems gave me much pleasure, and I feel confident that they will be printed correctly and handsomely. The reader may find fault with them, but I am sure he will find pleasure in the form in which they are presented to his eye." 21 Douglas lavished care on these books because it was in this cheaper form, aimed at a popular audience, 22 that he was most interested in publishing American writings. His correspondence with Howells makes it clear that if the trade editions of Howells' novels had had a disappointingly small sale, Douglas was all the more satisfied to keep on with the American Author series, about which he was optimistic from the start. Douglas wrote to Howells on 28 January 1884 that I fear you will be disposed to say "Mickle cry &amp; little work" as regards your pocket editions, yet I know you will be glad, when I tell you, that I begin to see my way out of the wood[?] and if the sales should, by good fortune, keep up in 1884 as they did in 1883, there will be something more to divide [Douglas enclosed a check for £16/4/2] and even as it is — as everything is paid for including well on to £1000 for advertising — my profit may be looked for on the sales of the present stock which at the worst is bound to move off to some extent as the advertising [power?] cannot yet be exhausted for some months. . . . Douglas had invested heavily in Howells' fiction in both 1882 and 1883. Typesetting and printing alone cost £508 in the first year and £405 in the second, and Douglas mentions spending almost £1000 on advertising; there are no figures available on paper and binding, nor on Douglas's overhead costs, but £3500 is a conservative estimate of his total expenses on Howells' books in the first two years. 23 The royalty statement he sent Howells in January 1884, which covered both the trade and American Author editions, indicates that he had recovered his expenses on Howells' titles in the series, including presumably the heavy investment in reprinting the books issued in 1882. It is unfortunate that no royalty statement survives for the year 1884, but it is evident that Douglas had reached his break-even point before sales began to slow down dramatically. And even after this Douglas's hopes for continued sales must in some measure have been realized, for on 22 November 1884, in writing Howells to explain that the regular trade editions of A Modern Instance and A Woman's Reason were not selling, he could report that he had "no reason to be dissatisfied as [to] the demand" for the cheaper editions. The surviving royalty statements are spotty and sometimes not very informative because Douglas often paid Howells lump sums rather than a specified percentage on sales. In 1906, when Douglas was compiling his Scrap Book, he estimated that his total expenditure had been £16,000 and that he had divided the total profits of about £3000 evenly between himself and the authors. The only surviving records of payments made to Howells during the 1880's are those made in 1884 and 1886. The latter was for £20 (Scrap Book); assuming that this represents half profits and that of the total sold two thirds were bound in paper and one sixth each were bound in calico and blue cloth, the £20 suggests a sale of some 2100 volumes in 1885. Only one title was reprinted during 1885, A Chance Acquaintance , and only one new one was added, The Rise of Silas Lapham — and it was to be five years before Douglas could sell his initial printing of 5000 copies of this novel. Here again, the evidence of the printing records and of royalty payments indicates that after an initially brisk sale in 1882 and 1883 Howells' fiction in the American Author series moved more slowly. 24 The booming sales of 1882 and 1883 undoubtedly reflect the notoriety Howells won from his article praising Henry James at the expense of Dickens and Thackeray, but it is nonetheless clear from the printing records that Howells kept a modest but not unimpressive readership in Britain for the next fifteen or twenty years. For where titles in the trade editions were sold in the tens, those in the American Author series were sold in the hundreds. The chart facing this page indicates the course of these sales in so far as it is reflected in the orders Douglas placed with T. &amp; A. Constable, his Edinburgh printers. This chart indicates two general factors about the basis of Howells' reputation in Britain and raises a question about how Douglas's judgment as a publisher may have helped to shape that reputation. The first and most obvious factor in the record of Howells' sales in Britain is that three novels, Their Wedding Journey, A Chance Acquaintance , and A Foregone Conclusion , were vastly more popular than any of the other titles. Thirteen other of Howells' books appeared in the series, but these three novels alone account for about forty-three percent of the total sales and are the only ones to have any popularity after 1900. This suggests that Howells was, for many British readers, a one or two novel author; indeed, two of these novels — Their Wedding Journey and A Chance Acquaintance — share some of the same characters. A second factor is more striking: virtually all of Howells' popularity in Britain rested on what he had written in the 1870's, in the early part of his career before his talent and vision fully matured. Only four of his later novels appeared in the American Author series, and only two of them were major novels — The Rise of Silas Lapham and Indian Summer . It is clear that British readers had a severely limited exposure to the amazing string of good novels that Howells wrote between A Modern Instance (1882) and The Quality of Mercy (1892). The question of why Douglas did not publish works like Annie Kilburn or A Hazard of New Fortunes in the American Author series is an important one, because his decision not to include them kept Howells' most mature work out of the hands of most of his British readers. Unfortunately, the question cannot be answered with certainty. When Douglas added The Rise of Silas Lapham to the series in 1885, after two years during which nothing new by Howells had been offered, his print order was the largest initial one he had placed up to that time. He must have been optimistic about the book — as its subsequent reprintings indicate he had some reason to be. It is hard to imagine that the novels that followed, it, bespeaking a similar and maturing social concern, would not also have found readers in Britain. It may be, however, that the sales of Indian Summer , the next book of Howells' published in the series, discouraged Douglas from adding more of his works. Unfortunately, that novel, for all its excellence, lies outside Howells' main accomplishment as a novelist in the 1880's and offered no adequate measure of his potential popularity. If Douglas decided against publishing Annie Kilburn, April Hopes , and A Hazard of New Fortunes in the American Author series because Indian Summer was not successful, he made the mistake (visible only through the glass of hindsight) of measuring unlike novels against one another — a mistake the more regrettable because of the evident interest in The Rise of Silas Lapham . However the fact is to be explained that so few of the books Howells wrote in the 1880's were published in the American Author series, it is fitting to emphasize that Howells himself was always more than satisfied with what Douglas could do for him and returned his loyalty in kind. On 28 February 1897 Howells wrote to tell Douglas he did not want to transfer his books to Harper's London office unless Douglas were losing money on them, 25 and a year later when Howells did make the move he wrote to Douglas (25 March 1898) that he was "proud to think our relation has not been merely commercial, and I am glad to know that in any event we can always be friends." Howells' friendship with Douglas was to last until the latter's death — as indeed did the commercial connection, although on a much reduced scale. On 27 January 1905 Howells returned to Douglas the royalty check for the previous year's sales, saying that he was unwilling for Douglas to lose money on his books and offering — because Harper did not want to take over the stock — to buy the bound copies himself. A few days later, on 7 February, Howells wrote again, this time with the tenacity of a professional author, to suggest that the returned royalties be spent on advertising. This was of no avail and several years later, on 19 April 1913, Howells wrote that he wished he could suggest some way for Douglas to unload his unsaleable stock and authorized him to sell it without regard to himself. The last royalty payment came from Douglas's son on 4 February 1916 and brought with it news of Douglas's last illness — he was then ninety-three years old. Howells wrote back to acknowledge the check and to say that "unless you should make some strange unforeseen sale, you ought to consider me fully recompensed. Only yesterday, I was speaking to my daughter of your dear father. I wish you would give him my love; he is one of the dearest friends of my life."

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 "Editor's Study," Harper's Monthly , 82 (1890), 154. 2 The British issues of Italian Journeys and Suburban Sketches are listed in The English Catalogue of Books and referred to in BAL , but I have not seen either of them or the Trübner issue of the second edition of Venetian Life (1867). It is likely that these were all made up from sheets imported from America. Other of Howells' books, including A Foregone Conclusion (see BAL 9568), are listed in The English Catalogue of Books under their American imprints. Low first published The Undiscovered Country under his imprint using sheets imported from America, but in 1881 he brought out a second edition of this novel, printed from a new typesetting, as part of his Select Novelets series. This edition is not listed in BAL ; copies of it are at the British Museum and the Bodleian Library. 3 In 1879 Howells reported in Publishers' Weekly that he supposed he did not lose much in royalties because of the lack of an international copyright law: "it is very little, and mainly in Canada and Germany. Perhaps $200 or $300 a year" (1 March 1879, p. 262). Though Howells never did make large profits from the sale of his books in Great Britain, it is ironic that, as will be shown, it was exactly the novels he was publishing in the 1870's that were to be most popular with his British readers. 4 The copyright registration form in the Public Record Office is dated 28 July but lists 14 July as the date of publication. 5 A duplicate set of plates was probably made and sent to Trübner for his issue of the complete book; they were used again by Douglas when he published the book in 1883. Douglas's printer for this impression was T. &amp; A. Constable, Edinburgh. No printer is identified in the Trübner edition.

I am indebted to Mr. Douglas for his generosity in allowing me to study the notebook and to quote from it and from the letters written by David Douglas. Dean Sage was a lumberman, friend of Mark Twain, an expert on fishing, and author of Ristigouche and its Salmon Fishing , privately published by Douglas in 1888. 7 See Carl Weber, The Rise and Fall of James Ripley Osgood (1959), p. 186. 8 Mildred Howells, ed., Life in Letters of William Dean Howells (1928), I, 342. 9 "The Man of Letters as a Man of Business," Scribner's Magazine , 14 (1893), 436. 10 See Publishers' Weekly , 10 May 1884, pp. 549-550. But as late as 12 May 1885 Douglas reported his continued uncertainty on the matter to Howells: "I am trying to get at the bottom of this question of quasi copyright which, as you know, I have always feared will not hold good should any unscrupulous person choose to run the blockade. —I understand that not only is prior publication necessary but the residence of the author at the time of publication on British territory is essential." 11 For more on this passage and on the bibliographical complications of trans-Atlantic publication, see the "Textual Commentary" to The Rise of Silas Lapham , ed. Walter J. Meserve and David J. Nordloh (1971), pp. 373-388. 12 The print figures come from the Day Books of T. &amp; A. Constable, Ltd., Douglas's printer in Edinburgh; I am grateful to C. W. Kilpatrick for permission to quote from them. Douglas's letter of 22 November 1884 to Howells indicates that Douglas wanted to print 500 copies from Howells' plates "so as to lessen the cost of making a duplicate set." This suggests that Douglas made two sets of plates, one for himself and one for Howells, but the Constable ledger indicates only one was made. It is possible that the "duplicate plates" refers to those made for the American Author series, but in accounting to Howells for this series Douglas elsewhere always viewed it and the trade editions as separate ventures. 13 Douglas and Howells had evidently discussed the possibility of charging more than 6s. for the trade editions and depending more entirely on sales to circulating libraries for their profit. Howells agreed with Douglas in rejecting this strategy in a letter of 20 February 1886 (Scrap Book). 14 On 31 August 1921 William Douglas, David's son, replied to Mildred Howells' inquiry about the trade editions by saying that the demand for them had ceased more than a dozen years earlier, that the bound stock had been sold to a second-hand dealer, and that the rest, save a few sets, was used as waste paper. If the story of these trade editions is a bleak one commercially, Douglas nonetheless made clear to Howells his own personal pleasure in being his publisher: "Now my dear friend though I am disappointed at the [illegible word] popularity of your books among British readers (as I daresay you yourself are) and at the comparative failure of my efforts to make them a big success, yet I am proud of having introduced them here and grateful to you for your appreciation of what I have been able to do" (letter of 2 October 1891). 15 A Foregone Conclusion was reprinted in September, A Chance Acquaintance in October. A Counterfeit Presentment was first printed in August and reprinted in December; Their Wedding Journey and The Lady of the Aroostook were first printed in September and reprinted in November and December respectively; Out of the Question was first printed in October and reprinted in December; The Undiscovered Country and A Fearful Responsibility were first printed in October and December respectively. It is evident that Howells' talents had begun to recommend themselves to British readers before the appearance of the Century article. 16 "Henry James," Century Magazine , 25 (1882), 28. 17 See for instance, [Margaret Oliphant,] "American Literature in England," Blackwood's Magazine , 133 (1883), 145: "The English public has taken a much longer time to discover Mr Howells [than it had to discover Henry James]; and it is, we think, chiefly owing to the agency of the 'Century' that he has stepped into the region of visibility between the two worlds on which we have finally made his acquaintance." Besides the piece on Henry James, Howells had published an essay on Mark Twain and his novel A Modern Instance in the Century Magazine . Mrs. Oliphant is identified as the author of the Blackwood's review by Walter Houghton, ed., The Wellesley Index to Victorian Periodicals (1966), I, 159; I am indebted to Mr. Houghton for his identifying also the authors of the reviews cited in footnote 18. 18 [Miss Amy Levy,] "The New School of American Fiction," Temple Bar , 70 (1884), 386; [John Mackinnon Robertson,] "Mr. Howells' Novels," Westminster Review , n.s. 66 (1884), 348. 19 Douglas went on to mention specifically his desire to print half a dozen of Aldrich's works and "to make them sacred." Between 1885 and 1902 he published seven books by Aldrich, and if he did not make them sacred to British readers, he was at least able to make them profitable for Aldrich. Douglas sent him, for instance, £50 on 7 October 1893 for Two Bites at a Cherry , published in that year. 20 The most likely instance of this is James Lane Allen's Flute and Violin , which Howells reviewed in Harper's Monthly in September 1891 (pp. 640-641); Douglas published the volume in April 1892. Howells had also reviewed Burrough's Wake-Robin and Locusts and Wild Honey and M. W. Wilkins's Humble Romance , but too long before Douglas published these books to suggest any direct recommendation as a result of the review. Howells would have known the work of all the authors Douglas published, and he at one time or another had reviewed most of them. 21 Political Works (Edinburgh, 1892), I, v. 22 Little is known of how Douglas marketed the American Author series except that it rivaled in cost the least expensive novels and that Douglas's advertisements typically indicated that the books were "to be had at all the Railway Book-stalls." It is perhaps worth noting that the most popular of Howells' books in the series were the travel stories. 23 The printing costs given here include the cost of both printing and paper for the paper covers in which most copies were issued. The actual sewing and binding are not included. The Constable records indicate that in 1882-83 at least two-thirds of the print order of a new title would be bound in paper, leaving a third or less for cloth binding; subsequent reprintings were mostly bound in paper. The scarcity of American Author volumes is probably explained by the fact that the majority of them were bound so perishably. 24 The more numerous royalty statements sent in the 1890's confirm this pattern, except for the years 1892 and 1893 when Douglas's payments to Howells almost tripled. Douglas sent his statements in January and February for the preceding year. His letters and the amounts for the American Author series are as follows: 21 January 1892, £8/13/0; 24 January 1893, £65/7/9; 1 February 1894, £50/0/0; 5 February 1895, £15/0/0; 8 February 1896, £20/0/0. The only later statements to survive are dated 4 March 1906, £21/15/3 (in the Scrap Book, the amount covers royalties on both the American Author series and the trade editions); 4 February 1910, £4/9/0; and 4 February 1916 (paying for both the American Author series and the trade editions sold during the previous three years), £8/17/10. 25 Douglas was probably not making much on them, but in May and June of this year he brought out cheap editions of eight of Howells' dramatic farces: The Mouse Trap , The Garroters , Evening Dress , Five O'Clock Tea , A Likely Story , The Unexpected Guests , The Albany Depot , and A Letter of Introduction . Douglas printed 3000 copies of each play; his total printing costs for the series were £77/5/9. Two years later, on 5 March 1899. Howells wrote to Douglas to agree that free acting rights might be granted if that would aid sales (Scrap Book).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Oscar Wilde's First Manuscript of The Picture of Dorian Gray by Donald L. Lawler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There have been omens in the past two decades that the long suzerainty of biography, anecdote, and memoir in Oscar Wilde studies may be threatened by a new emphasis upon textual scholarship, critical bibliography, and analytic literary criticism. These new directions should be seen, perhaps, as a sign of the rehabilitation of Oscar Wilde as an important literary figure. Wilde has certainly become respectable as a writer of prose if not of verse and has emerged as one of the major authors of the 1880's and 1890's. It is to be hoped that in the wake of the present revaluation of Wilde's work, there will follow a better and a more balanced assessment of his writing. If this is to be the case, there must be even more attention given to primary scholarship of a bibliographical and textual nature. Such research can offer the literary critic the necessary facts and the accurate texts with which to work. One well-known instance of such a contribution came in 1964 when the Rupert Hart-Davis edition of the Oscar Wilde Letters gave us, at last, an accurate text of "De Profundis." 1 The original four act version of The Importance of Being Earnest did not come to light in English until Vyvyan Holland edited a composite text in 1957. Sarah Augusta Dickson's two-volume, 1956 edition of the original four act play manuscript was valuable for reprinting the surviving drafts. The revised and enlarged Portrait of Mr. W. H. was not generally available until 1958, and the original, sometimes called the short version of The Picture of Dorian Gray was practically inaccessible outside the rare book rooms until Wilfred Edener used it as the basis for a critical edition of the novel in 1964. The Edener edition was only the first step in providing the literary critic with adequate materials for reinterpretation and revaluation of Oscar Wilde's novel. The limited scope of the Edener edition restricted the study to recording variant readings for the two published versions of the novel. The revisions in the manuscripts have never been printed, and as yet, the problems relating to Wilde's intentions and the effects of the revisions remain to be published. 2 In the case of Dorian Gray and indeed many other major works by Wilde, collectors happily have preserved manuscripts and typescripts so that comparative studies of the different states of the text may be made. Such studies may reveal more than memoirs, biographies, and letters about the composition of the work and the realized intentions of the author. With this in mind, I offer the following paper as a preliminary study in textual bibliography to a more ambitious inquiry into the significance of the Dorian Gray manuscripts. The text of The Picture of Dorian Gray exists in two published states. The novel first appeared as the featured work of fiction in the July, 1890 number of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine . There are extant two manuscripts for the Lippincott's Dorian Gray . The holograph manuscript is at the Pierpont Morgan Library and the corrected typescript is now at the William Andrews Clark Library. In June of 1891, Wilde published Dorian Gray in an expanded version. The manuscript of the book version of Dorian Gray , published by Ward, Lock and Company, has not been found, if indeed a full manuscript ever existed. Chapters added to the original Lippincott's Dorian Gray have turned up here and there over the years: Chapter III and one leaf from Chapter V are in the William Andrews Clark Library. Chapter XV is in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library. Chapters XIV and XVI, sold at auction in the twenties, are, presumably, still in the hands of private collectors. As far as anyone knows, The Picture of Dorian Gray was begun sometime in 1889. The first allusion to the novel appears in the fragment of a letter Wilde sent to J. M. Stoddart, the editor of Lippincott's Magazine , after Stoddart had found one of Wilde's adult fairy tales unsuitable: "I have invented a new story which is better than 'The Fisherman and his Soul,' and I am quite ready to set to work at once on it." 3 The letter is dated 17 December 1889. Subsequent references in later correspondence make it clear that Wilde was referring to Dorian Gray in the letter cited above. It is possible, even likely, that Wilde had begun working on the novel earlier than December of 1889. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that Wilde had begun work on Dorian Gray before October of 1889. 4 At this point, the manuscripts themselves provide the best evidence of the novel's development. The holograph manuscript, thought to be the original of the novel, was revised extensively by Wilde. These revisions affect characterization, setting, action and theme as well as commonplace minor changes in spelling, syntax, and idiom. After the revisions in the holograph were completed, Wilde had the manuscript typed and then made further changes. The revisions in the typescript are as extensive and as significant as those made in the manuscript. It was from this corrected copy of the typescript that The Picture of Dorian Gray was set up in type and printed by Lippincott's . There is an interval of eleven months between the appearance of Dorian Gray in Lippincott's and the publication of Dorian Gray as a book by Ward, Lock &amp; Co. During that period, Wilde made his final revisions of the novel, and they are the most extensive of all. He added five new chapters, introducing many new characters and continuing with the alterations he had made earlier in atmosphere, theme, and action. The new chapters Wilde added were first written out in longhand. It is not known what procedures Wilde followed for the changes he made in the already published sections of his book. He did not use the original typescript from which the Lippincott's The Picture of Dorian Gray was set. If Wilde followed his customary method of revising, he would have worked from a fresh typescript. However, there is no evidence that, in fact, he did so. The novel, published by Ward, Lock &amp; Co. in June of 1891, represents the final state of the text and, therefore, expresses the author's final intention for his work. Wilde never again made any changes in the text. In the course of examining the manuscript of Dorian Gray , I discovered a number of irregularities in the holograph which indicate the existence of a manuscript version of the novel prior to the earliest one now known. The evidence is, I believe, strong enough to suggest that Wilde, in fact, revised his novel not two but at least three times before its original publication by Lippincott's . The evidence I have to present is wholly textual, based on Wilde's handwritten corrections in the manuscript. In classifying the various corrections made by Wilde in the holograph manuscript, I discovered a significant number of cases which could not be explained as arising from simple error, stylistic alteration, or those more substantial changes involving characterization, theme, and action. The corrections I shall investigate fall under the general category of errors emended in the course of writing the manuscript or possibly, in some cases, improvements made during the writing of the holograph. This fact is easily established by the character of the text. Each of the corrections to be discussed is part of the original writing, not added above the line or in the margin during a proof-reading. The kind of error and revision to be discussed in this paper has led me to the conclusion that in order to account for them, one is forced to postulate the existence of a still earlier original manuscript for the novel from which Wilde was working more or less closely. In some cases, words, parts of words, or phrases are repeated in a manner suggesting that an error had been made in copying rather than in composition. In other cases there are passages which had been deleted by Wilde from an earlier part of the holograph and moved to a later page or recopied further down on the same page. There is only one instance in which Wilde moved a passage from a later page in the manuscript to an earlier one, an exception which, in this case, does not violate the rule. It helps us immeasurably to have an example of a text which Wilde is known to have copied so that we may see whether or not errors of the kind found in the holograph manuscript of Dorian Gray appear there. We have such a specimen in the very manuscript under discussion. There is one part of The Picture of Dorian Gray which is known to have been copied by Wilde from one of his own earlier reviews, written while he was editor of Woman's World from June, 1887 until October, 1889. In November of 1888, about six months before the first reports that Wilde was working on a novel, he wrote a review of Earnest Lefebure's book, Embroidery and Lace : Their Manufacture and History from the Remotest Antiquity to the Present Day . 5 A significant part of the review reproduces or paraphrases Lefebure's text. More important for our purposes, when Wilde was scavenging for material to include in Dorian Gray's decadent pleasure house, he transcribed a number of paragraphs into the text of Dorian Gray from his old review of Lefebure's book. The self-plagiarism amounts to almost three pages of the holograph manuscript. 6 The leaves in question were copied verbatim from the text of the review, as a simple comparison reveals. In these copied leaves of the novel, there are four or five cases in which Wilde later made stylistic changes in the borrowed passages. However, there is one passage with an error of copying which has a relevance for this study. He longed to see the curious table napkins wrought for Heliogabalus on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast: the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic with its three hundred golden bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of King Chilperic the Bishop of Pontus, and were embroidered. . . . 7 The repetition of the words "King Chilperic" above (in my italics) is obviously in error. The original passage in the review read, "robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of Pontus." 8 Normally, a slip such as the one above would not be notable or likely to excite curiosity. Indeed, such an error would not be significant at all were it not for the fact that the mistake occurs in a passage known to have been copied by Wilde from his own review published in Woman's World , November, 1888. Instances of similarly repeated phrases or expressions dramatically out of place in the narrative may be cited as evidence that the holograph manuscript is probably a copy of an earlier draft. Such errors, while not frequent, occur throughout the holograph manuscript, indicating that any prior ur-manuscript must have been a nearly complete draft of the novel. 9 He turned to Hallward, and said, "My dear fellow, I have just remembered." — "Remembered what, Harry?" — "Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray." — "Where I heard the name of was it' 'asked Hallward, with a slight frown. (l. 26.) I don't know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to be furious. I don't care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and then I can do what I like I don't k have been right, Basil, haven't I. . . ." (l. 86.) "Nothing is serious now-a-days, at Hallward least, nothing should be." Hallward shook his head as he entered. . . . (l. 205). In each of the cases cited above, the color tones of the ink in the manuscript indicate that Wilde recognized his mistake at once and lined through the offending words. Wilde wrote the holograph manuscript on blue lined folio paper with a steel tipped pen and an India-type ink. Close examination of the manuscript will often reveal the intervals at which the pen was dipped into the ink. In each of the passages above we have an example of one kind of error Wilde is known to have made in copying from his own book review originally written for Woman's World . There are other anomalies in the manuscript which also suggest that they are errors of transcription rather than of composition. I refer to words left incomplete by Wilde and then lined through. Once again, the color tones of the ink reveal that Wilde must have crossed out the incomplete words before going on. I have chosen three representative examples of words left unfinished from different areas of the manuscript. 10 There was something in his face that made one trust him at once. All YOU the candour of youth was there. (l. 30.) Yes: Basil could have saved him. But it was too late now. REGR The past could always be annihilated. Regret , denial of forgetfulness could do that. (l. 156.) The harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert's grace, and Chopin's MI beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself fell unheeded on his ear. (l. 183.) Slips of the kind listed above are significant only as evidence which supports the hypothesis that some of the errors made by Wilde in the holograph manuscript were the result of a copying lapse made in the course of working from an earlier manuscript. It seems to me that the features of the manuscript cited above are of a kind that one might expect when one text is copied from another. There is further evidence I should like to consider before concluding my case in support of the claim that there existed a manuscript anterior to the holograph manuscript now in the Morgan Library. In the course of writing the holograph, Wilde transposed a number of passages forward in the text from an earlier leaf to a later one. Some passages were recopied further down on the same page. One passage was removed from a later to an earlier page, but that exception is revealing because of a change in pagination. These transposed passages are unlike any of the other cases in which Wilde moved phrases, expressions, or more complex elements around from one place to another because they were not written above the line or in the margin but are integrated in the script. This means that such passages were moved either in the course of copying or of composition. The first lines to be transposed by Wilde were spoken originally by Basil Hallward, the painter of Dorian's portrait, to Lord Henry Wotton, the man who tempts Dorian Gray with his gospel of new Hedonism. Wilde removed the passage from the dialogue of Basil Hallward and replaced it in a meditation by Lord Henry on beauty. I tell him that beauty like his is genius, is higher than genius, as it needs no explanation and is one of the great facts of the world, like sunlight or springtime, or the reflection in dark waters of that thin silver shell we call the moon. Wilde transferred these lines verbatim from leaf 22 of the holograph manuscript to leaf 38. The reason for the change is that the lines are really more appropriate to Lord Henry. Also they represent an early step in reducing the importance of Basil Hallward's role in the novel. This process was continued in the revisions Wilde later made on the completed holograph and carried on in the further revisions through which the novel was put before publication in its final form in 1891. I believe that this particular incidence of transferal may be taken as evidence of a pre-existing manuscript. Had Wilde been composing as he went along, it is doubtful that such a change in the importance and in the role of a character would have been conceived before the first chapter was completed and then forgotten in subsequent chapters, whereas the changes made in later proofreading revisions of the novel reveal a consistent program to expand the characterization of Lord Henry and to reduce the influence of Basil Hallward in the story. There are three other instances in which Wilde moved material from an earlier to a later position in the manuscript. As was the case above, no alterations were made in the passage and the lines were copied into the text without interruption. In the first of these passages, Dorian is speaking to Basil. It is the scene in which Dorian insists that Basil come with him into his abandoned nursery to see the portrait which Basil had painted many years before. The lines appeared first on manuscript leaf 212, lines 6-9. They were crossed out by Wilde and rewritten as lines 23-25 on the same leaf: I will show you my soul. You shall see the thing that you fancy only God can see. The second repeated passage is a phrase which appeared in the narrator's commentary on leaf 231 of the manuscript, was cancelled by Wilde, and rewritten on the following leaf. . . . during the eighteen months that their friendship had lasted. In the manuscript leaf 233, lines 30-31, the following passage is deleted, reappearing again on leaf 234 as lines 8-9. The words are those of Dorian Gray addressed to Alan Campbell, the scientist whose alchemy is enlisted to remove all traces of Basil Hallward's corpse from the upstairs nursery of Dorian's house: So it is, and to more than one person, Alan. It is obvious from the character of the manuscript that Wilde transposed the passages in question as he was writing. The question is whether the manuscript in which the passages are rearranged was copied or composed. I think that at this point, we may rely, in part, on the weight of the evidence already presented in favor of the hypothesis that the manuscript is a copy rather than a first draft. Further to support this interpretation of the transposed passages in question, I should like to call the reader's attention to Wilde's own habits of composition. After each revision of a text, Wilde liked to have a clear copy. In the beginning he would make a fair copy of his rough draft himself. Later he would have a typescript made and work from that. I submit that it would have been unusual and uncharacteristic of Wilde to have made the kind of changes shown in the removal of the passages cited above while he was composing. Further, the physical evidence of the ink tones supports the view that the passages were recopied rather than moved during the course of composition. As I have mentioned earlier, since Wilde wrote in India ink with a steel tipped pen, it is often easy to tell at which points the pen was returned to the ink well. The ink in the script becomes lighter just before he refreshed the nib. Now in the instances of the transposed lines, the ink tones indicate that the cancel lines were drawn directly after the lines had been written. What is more, there is no detectable alteration in the ink tones as the passages reappear later in the text. Something of the sort should be expected, unless Wilde's memory were so retentive that he could recall as many as eight lines over sixteen pages of newly composed fiction. Otherwise, there should be some indication that Wilde had paused to relocate his original words in the manuscript. One final passage deserves consideration. The lines below appear in the manuscript on leaf 27b. Wilde removed one passage from its original position at the top of leaf 28, made some additions and used it as the conclusion for Chapter One. Basil Hallward is speaking to Lord Henry Wotton. He begins by saying, "Don't take away the one person who makes life absolutely lovely to me, and that gives my art whatever wonder or charm it possesses. Mind, Harry, I trust you." He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will. "What nonsense you talk," said Lord Henry smiling, and taking Hallward by the arm, he almost led him into the house. This passage is the only instance I have found in which Wilde moved lines back to an earlier page. It is possible that Wilde made the change in proofreading, having forgotten to designate the beginning of Chapter Two as he composed; or he may have divided up a chapter which proved to be too long. If so, he had to have made the changes before he reached Chapter Four, which is numbered correctly. Once again, the evidence of the ink tones is helpful. There is a close match between the color tone of the ink in the first cancelled lines and the writing at the end of the chapter. Likewise there is a match up between the color tone of the ink in the last lines stricken and the first words recopied on 27b. This seems to indicate that Wilde cancelled the lines on the top of leaf 28 as soon as they were written, that he recopied them with an additional phrase or two on leaf 27b immediately afterward, and that, therefore, he was probably using another text from which he could safely copy his lines. Of course we have been dealing here with inferences drawn from the corrections made by Wilde in the holograph manuscript of Dorian Gray . The evidence leads, I believe, to but one conclusion: that Wilde copied his holograph text now at the Morgan Library from a pre-existing draft. No other hypothesis accounts for the kind of mistake made by Wilde in the holograph and examined in this paper. We must assume that such errors were made in the course of transcription and that the original draft from which the holograph was copied must have covered the entire story since the transcription errors are to be found throughout the manuscript from leaf 22 to leaf 219. Therefore, the original draft was more than merely a working outline. The fact that the errors occur in passages of trivial significance suggests not only that Wilde was more likely to be distracted in copying such material but it implies that the earlier text was more or less a complete draft of the novel as it appears now in the Morgan Library holograph. Finally, we may assume that the original manuscript was probably foul papers, heavily corrected and reworked by the author. That would account for the trouble Wilde took to make a fair copy of the original. That fair copy, in turn, was extensively altered and rewritten by Wilde. The significance of all this for Wildean criticism and for textual bibliography is easily seen. At the very least, it means that any future editor of a critical or a scholarly edition of The Picture of Dorian Gray should not treat the Morgan Library holograph as the original manuscript. Although it is an invaluable text in its own right, it cannot be taken to reveal all those things about Wilde's original inspiration and shaping of the novel which a first draft would expose. We must also revise upward from two to three the number of times Wilde rewrote his novel before its first publication in Lippincott's Magazine. Four full revisions of Dorian Gray before the novel took its final form suggest that the stereotyped view of Wilde as a careless and hasty writer may need reassessment. Perhaps a more thorough knowledge of Wilde's work habits would dispel some of the myths, partly self-created, about Wilde's insouciance toward his craft as a writer. The chances of the original draft of Dorian Gray turning up at this late hour do not appear to be good. It is now eighty-two years since Wilde began work on the novel. Not a trace of foul papers or a working manuscript has appeared in the auction room catalogues or in lists describing the holdings of libraries or private collectors. No mention of the original draft appears in the letters or in any of the biographies and reminiscences. It is likely that Wilde himself disposed of the original manuscript. It is also possible that it was lost or destroyed at the time of the infamous auction of Wilde's property from his house at 16 Tite Street, Chelsea, in April of 1895 when the house was thrown open to curiosity seekers and souvenir hunters. At that time, it is said that many manuscripts were taken, and to this day, some have not been recovered. Another, more optimistic view is that the true original manuscript may be in the hands of a private collector or even may be languishing in someone's attic. In any case, the possible existence of another Dorian Gray manuscript has a potential value not only for the collector but also for the textual scholar and the literary critic.</field>

Wilde was replaced as editor of Woman's World in October of 1889. The fact that he contributed nothing further of his own after June of 1889 is an indication that he was given notice before that date. If this inference is correct, and if we may rely on the substantial if not the literal truth of Wyndham's anecdote, we may assume that Wilde had been at work on Dorian Gray before June of 1889. 5 Oscar Wilde, The Complete Works of Oscar Wilde , ed.

Wilde crossed out the repeated phrase in the manuscript. 8 Wilde, Complete Works , p. 11. 9 In the quotations given above and below, each line is reproduced as it appears in the manuscript except that I have italicized the repeated elements. The additional examples of copying error given below will show the reader how these passages are distributed throughout the manuscript. A. Within the world, as men know it, there was a finer world that only artists know of, — artists of artists, or those to whom the temperament of the artist has been given. Creation within—that is what Basil Hallward had named it, that is what he had attained to. (l. 43.) B. — "Then you shall come. And you will come, too, Basil, won't you?" — " Then you and I will — "I can't really, I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do." — "Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray." (l. 51.) C. The elaborate character of the frame made the picture extremely heavy, and now and then he put his hand to it so as to help them in spite of Mr. Ashton who had a true tradesman's dislike of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful he put his hand to it so as to help them. (l. 160.) D. "Though your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them white as snow!" Suddenly a wild — "Those words mean nothing to me, now." — "Hush! Don't say that. You have done enough evil in your life, My God! don't you see that damned thing leering at us?" Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly a wild feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him. (l. 219.) In passage C above, it appears from the ink tones in the holograph manuscript that Wilde did not line through the expression "he put his hand to it" until later, probably in proofreading. I conclude from the evidence of the lighter color of the ink in the deleted passages and in the contiguous script as compared to the much darker cancel line that the repetition is a result of an anticipation of the phrase rather than merely an improvement in style. 10 In order to demonstrate the relevance of the incomplete word, it has been necessary to abstract a significant part of the text. I have used upper case letters to indicate the unfinished word and italics to identify the word when it reappears in the text.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Some Unusual Printer's Copy Used for Early Sixteenth-Century Editions of Erasmus' Encomium Moriae by Clarence H. Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The early editions of The Praise of Folly provide some useful information about how printers chose their basic copy. 1 Erasmus' masterpiece was frequently reprinted during his own lifetime. 2 It was extraordinarily popular and much sought after: no other single small book (except perhaps More's Utopia ) offered, both in matter and manner, such a brilliant condensation of the literary and theological attitudes of the humanists. From its first printing in 1511 until the death of Erasmus in 1536, it was printed 35 times, in Paris, Strasbourg and Lyons, in Cologne and Basel, in Florence and Venice and elsewhere. 3 During these years, Erasmus also revised and augmented the work seven times (in 1512, 1514, 1515, 1516, 1521, 1522, and 1532). About 18% of the final text did not appear in the first edition. The work was also printed by some of the finest printers of the age — Badius van Assche in Paris, Matthias Schürer in Strasbourg, Johann Froben in Basel, Aldus in Venice. In fact, these printers (with the exception of Aldus) vied with one another in producing editions with the latest revisions and (after 1515) with the commentary added to the work under the name of Gerardus Listrius. Badius was the first to print a revised edition in July 1512 (E841), but two years later Schürer (setting his text from Badius' edition) published a revised and augmented edition (E843), which was in turn reprinted about a year later by Froben (E846-7). But in 1516 Froben himself published an edition including an added passage and many smaller corrections (E848). A year later Schürer (E850) incorporated the revisions of the Froben edition, and in 1519 Badius (E852) brought his edition up to date by copying the Froben edition of 1517 (E849). The last three stages of revision appeared in Froben's editions of 1521 (E860) and 1522 (E862) and in the edition published by Jerome Froben and Nicolas Bischoff (Episcopius) in 1532 (E870). Much can be learned by collating the early editions and identifying the editions which printers used as their copy, but one point, I think, can be singled out as of special interest to the bibliographer. It is this: the convenience of the printer in designing his format, particularly when he was printing in the italic type dear to the humanists, sometimes influenced his choice of basic copy and the manner in which he chose to include the latest revisions. Among the important printers, Schürer is the only one who deliberately took his basic copy from an inferior edition, which he then proceeded to correct against the latest revised edition. But among the minor printers the phenomenon occurs more than once and for various reasons. To begin with Schürer himself. When he set out to publish a new edition (E850) of the Moria in 1517, he knew that the edition incorporating Erasmus' latest revisions was Froben's 1516 edition (E848). As a matter of fact, Froben had based his edition on Schürer's 1514 edition, adding to it Erasmus' revisions and one substantial passage. Now Schürer claimed the same favor by borrowing the changes in the Froben edition. But instead of printing directly from Froben's edition, Schürer chose to set his text from a copy of his own 1514 edition, after incorporating into that copy the additions and revisions from the Froben text. The question, then, is why did Schürer not choose for his basic copy the best edition with the latest revisions? The answer is that he actually found it easier to set from a copy of what he knew to be an inferior edition. The Froben edition included the long commentary by Listrius, which was set as a frame around pages of text that varied in size and shape. Schürer's new edition was not to include the commentary (as his old had not). He could set from his old edition page-for-page and line-for-line, except where he had to add a passage from the Froben edition. Hence he chose his basic copy from his own edition and corrected it against the Froben edition. Theoretically, the procedure is acceptable enough, but in fact, of course, Schürer missed quite a number of the corrections or changes made in Froben's edition and preserved instead old readings from his own. In fact, in one place the corrector even introduced an error from Froben's revised text. It seems to me quite clear that Schürer could have produced a more correct edition had he chosen to print directly from Froben's edition instead of a corrected copy of his own earlier edition. Indeed, Schürer himself became aware that he had not incorporated all the revisions of the Froben edition. Two years later, in 1519, when he issued a reprint (E853) of his own 1517 edition, he returned to Froben's 1516 edition (or one of two derivatives from it) and again corrected his text, attempting to incorporate the Froben's revisions more completely. He got more of them this time, but still not all of them. And the whole process would have been quite unnecessary if he had not decided to set page-for-page and line-for-line instead of following what he knew to be a better text. An even more troublesome form of basic copy was chosen by another Strasbourg printer, Johann Knoblauch, who symbolized his odoriferous name by three cloves of garlic at the top of the title-page of his 1521 edition (E859) of the Moria . Knoblauch found it convenient to set not merely from a copy of an inferior edition but from two copies, each from a different edition. In other words, his basic copy was composite. The evidence from the collation of his edition was most confusing at first because up to a point about two thirds through the text, his edition shares errors only with the 1515 edition of Aldus (E845), but after this point it shares some errors only with the 1517 edition of Schürer (E850). And yet, strangely enough, the first part also contains revisions, even erroneous ones, found only in Schürer's 1517 edition and not present at all in the Aldine text. The mystery cleared up when I discovered that Knoblauch printed from the Aldine edition line-for-line (not page-for-page) up to a certain point in his text (sig. E8 v ), with only slight variances in line-endings where a short passage had to be added from the Schürer text. But after this point, the line-for-line correspondence disappears. There was a good reason for Knoblauch to change his basic copy from the Aldine to the Schürer edition. Up to the point of change the passages to be added to the Aldine copy from Schürer's fuller text were quite short, usually no longer than a line. 4 But after this point the added passages were much longer so that it became easier to take the longer form as basic copy. One may ask why Knoblauch did not take Schürer's longer text as his basic copy from the beginning, since he corrected and amplified the Aldine text to conform with it. Again, the reason was his convenience. He intended to produce an imitation of an Aldine text, using italic print and a format like that of the famous Venetian printer. He specifically adverted to his Aldine pretensions in his blurb to the reader on the verso of the title-page, where he expressed the hope that his readers would not take it ill that he had pilfered some of Aldus' marginal notes to explain Erasmus' allusions. Setting line-for-line from Aldus' edition enabled him to cast off his copy rather easily, but only so long as the passages to be added were not lengthy. His whole Aldine ruse was perhaps designed to help him meet the competition of Schürer, who had already printed five editions of the Moria in his own handsome style with roman type. Schürer had been associated with the Moria almost from the beginning of its publishing history, and one of his editions had already made important additions and revisions. In fact, it was one of Schürer's editions (E842) that had provided the printer's copy for the Aldine edition Knoblauch was imitating. 5 Most of the additions and changes that Knoblauch made in his basic copy must have been written in the margins of the Aldine copy, as is shown by an error made by the compositor at one point (sig. B5 v ). There we find among the sidenotes in Knoblauch's edition a phrase which actually was supposed to have been introduced into the text; the compositor, apparently, mistook it for a marginal note. In at least two places (sigs. C7 v and E1 v ), Knoblauch's method of marginal additions has resulted in imperfect or partial correction, producing a combination of the earlier and later forms of the text. In his preface, Knoblauch struck a conscientious pose by making a correction at the top of one page, a change from the Aldine to the Schürer reading; but he had actually failed to change many of the Aldine readings in other places. Knoblauch himself was aware that his corrections were not complete: a year later, in 1522, when he issued a reprint (E861) of his 1521 edition, he continued the process of correcting it against the Schürer edition. 6 In this reprint Knoblauch also included a new address to his readers, whom he called the minions of Folly: he boasted that Folly now appeared "cleaner and neater, now printed once again in this typeface," that is, in italic. 7 It is quite true that his reprint is in some ways more correct than his first edition. But it would have been far cleaner, neater ,and more correct too, if the convenience of setting from an italic text had not dictated the choice of basic copy for his first edition. A final example of a printer's deliberately choosing an incomplete edition for his basic copy is provided by Sebastian Gryphius' edition (E869), printed in the late 1520's 8 at Lyons. This edition contains most of the revisions made in Froben's 1522 edition (E862), and yet it also contains many readings (and some errors) not found in that edition. In particular, it agrees at several places only with the editions of Knoblauch (E859, E861, and E865). In fact, it is clear that one of Knoblauch's three editions, corrected against the Froben 1522 edition, provided the copy for Gryphius' edition. But since Gryphius did not set page-for-page or line-for-line from the Knoblauch edition he used, it would have been impossible to say which of the three he chose if it had not been for a peculiar error which tends to single out Knoblauch's second edition (1522). Folly's indictment of bishops contains the sentence "At nunc belle faciunt, si sese pascunt" ("But nowadays they do a fine job if they feed themselves"). Only after several more sentences does Folly turn her attention to the laxness of the next group, the cardinals. And yet in the sentence about the bishops, Gryphius' edition inserts "cardinales" in the text after "faciunt": "At nunc belle faciunt cardinales, si sese pascunt" (sig. f1 v ). This puzzling and inappropriate addition can be explained by noting that in Knoblauch's second edition the marginal note "Cardina." has been displaced upward because of the need to insert a marginal translation of a Greek phrase which occurs right before the opening of the section about cardinals. Only in Knoblauch's second edition (E861, sig. G2 v ) does this displaced marginal note "Cardina." appear in perfect spacing and alignment right before the line beginning "belle faciunt." Having chosen this edition of Knoblauch, Gryphius proceeded to correct his copy by comparing it with Froben's 1522 edition, but the process of correction was sporadic and haphazard. If we ask again why Gryphius should have gone to the trouble to set from one edition and correct from a fuller version, instead of setting directly from the fuller version, the answer is not far to seek, since his reasons were similar to those of Knoblauch. Gryphius was printing in italic type without the Listrius commentary, but all three of the editions incorporating the latest revisions (E862, E864, E868) were set in roman type in pages of quite various sizes and line lengths because of the framing commentary. Since he found it more convenient to cast off his copy from regular lines of italic type than from varying lines of roman, Gryphius chose as his basic copy the fullest italic edition. 9 The general conclusion to be drawn from these examples of Schürer, Knoblauch, and Gryphius is that in a series of editions in the early sixteenth century the presence or absence of a framing commentary or the use of roman or italic type may have caused the printer to choose his basic copy from an edition which he knew to be deficient, or even to form his basic copy from two different editions, because the convenience he gained in casting off copy or setting his type outweighed the difficulty of supplementing his basic copy from a later and fuller edition. Unfortunately, what he gained in convenience might well be lost in accuracy. This practise has special relevance to Latin works because they were more likely to be printed with commentaries than works in the vernacular and because italic type, which was merely the printer's equivalent of the new humanistic script, had considerable prestige among humanist writers and editors. Among the early printers of the Moria , the normal procedure was to reprint an earlier edition, corrected more or less sporadically, usually without consulting any other edition. Those editions which contain authorial revisions or added passages were normally set from the most authoritative previous edition, even if some other edition might have provided more convenient printer's copy. 10 But when a modern editor of a humanistic work in Latin is confronted by anomalous conflations of old and new readings or strange blends of preceding editions, he may be dealing with unusual basic copy of the sort employed by Schürer, Knoblauch, and Gryphius in their editions of Erasmus' Moria .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 By the term "basic copy" I designate a particular copy of a particular edition which the printer corrected and then used to set his new edition. I have avoided using "copy-text" to mean "printer's copy," in accordance with the arguments advanced by G. Thomas Tanselle in "The Meaning of Copy-text: a Further Note," Studies in Bibliography , 22 (1970), 191-6. But "copytext," even taken in the strict sense supported by Tanselle, is also applicable to the phenomenon I am describing. For some printers (either alone or with help) functioned also as editors: they chose a particular edition as copy-text ("the text which an editor takes as the basis for his own text," Tanselle, p. 192) and by correcting and amplifying a single example of that edition they formed printer's copy ("the unique document which a printer follows in setting type," Tanselle, p. 192). Though Tanselle speaks of "basic text" as synonymous with "copy-text," it is perhaps useful to distinguish "basic (printer's) copy" from "printer's copy": a "basic copy" of a particular edition, once it has been corrected by marginal or interlinear additions, becomes "printer's copy" for a new edition. In some early editions of the Moria , passages to be added to the basic copy (either from authorial manuscript or from a different edition than the one to which the basic text belongs) were too lengthy to be written in the basic copy itself. In such cases printer's copy was presumably formed by combining the basic copy with parts of a copy from another edition or with passages written on separate sheets. 2 In their letters to Martin Dorp (1515) in defense of the Moria , both Erasmus ( Opus Epistolarum , ed. P. S. and H. M. Allen, 1906-41, II, 94) and St. Thomas More ( The Correspondence , ed. Elizabeth Rogers, 1947, p. 66) noted that the Moria had been unusually popular and frequently reprinted. On 13 June 1522 Erasmus wrote that over 20,000 copies had been printed ( Opera Omnia , ed. Jean LeClerc, 1703-6, IX, 360 and Opus Epistolarum , IV, 622). No doubt he chose a round number, which may have been rhetorically equivalent to "very many." But if the 1800 copies printed of E846-7 ( Opus Epistolarum , II, 64) can be taken as a usual or average number for an edition, Erasmus' estimate was quite conservative, for 24 editions would have produced over twice as many copies as he claims. 3 I have collated all these editions in the course of preparing an authoritative Latin text for the forthcoming Amsterdam edition of the complete works of Erasmus. All but three of these editions are identified and described by F. Van der Haeghen in Bibliotheca Belgica : Bibilographie générale des Pays-Bas , ed. Marie Therese Lenger, II (1964), E838-E871. It should be noted, however, that Van der Haeghen's E838 and E839 are not separate editions but rather the same sheets differing only in the title-pages and some stop-press corrections. E846 and E847 are also not separate editions. Three editions should be added to Van der Haeghen's list: 1) Thierry Martens' edition printed in January 1512 at Antwerp, Wouter Nijhoff and M. E. Kroneberg, Nederlandsche Bibliographie van 150 tot 1540 (1923-42), No. 831 (I have used a microfilm of the copy in the British Museum); 2) Jehan Lalyseau's edition printed at Paris between July 1512, and c. 1520, of which two copies are known: one in the Bibliothèque Municipale de Reims (A50319/Rés. P. 811), lacking two leaves (Aal and Aa8), and another in the University Library at Louvain (Rés. 3A 20852) which was once in the collection of Henri Omont and which was acquired by the University Library at Louvain in 1948; 3) an edition derived from the preceding edition, of unknown place (Mainz or Cologne?), printer, and date (1520?), a copy of which (perhaps unique) exists in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris (no. 542, Rés. Y2. 943). 4 With the exception of one longer passage which occurs shortly before the change in basic copy and which may have shown the difficulties the printer would face if he tried to go on using the Aldine edition as basic copy. 5 All five of the Italian editions published during Erasmus' lifetime (E844, E845, E851, E857, E867) are derived from Schürer's 1512 edition, which was merely a reprint of his 1511 edition (E840), so that these Italian editions contain none of the extensive authorial additions and revisions made after 1511. 6 Incidentally he also tidied up his pages somewhat. His 1522 edition was a page-for-page and line-for-line reprint of his 1521 edition. But some of the pages of his earlier edition had had 28 lines instead of the usual 27. In his reprint Knoblauch regularized the number of lines per page in 13 out of 14 instances. He also found it necessary to gain some space in the last gathering because he wished to print the colophon on the recto of the last page instead of the verso, which was now to be reserved for his own device. 7 "immaculatior, nitior, iam denuo hoc charactere excusa," sig. A1 v . 8 Julien Baudrier in Bibliographie Lyonnaise (Paris, reprinted 1964, VIII, 38) places this undated edition in 1528 or 1529. 9 Passing over a Venetian italic edition (E867) which, though it was later than Knoblauch's second edition, was far less complete. 10 Thus, for the first revised edition (E841) Badius used as basic copy the first edition (E838-9), which was wretchedly printed, not Schürer's intermediate edition (E840), which was much tidier and easier to work with but no more authoritative than E838-9. For the second revised edition (E843), Schürer himself used as basic copy the first revised edition (E841) printed by Badius, not one of his own editions (E840 and E842). In such cases, however, the basic copy might well have been chosen by Erasmus himself.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Was There A Lost 1593 Edition of Marlowe's Edward II ? by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The earliest known edition of Marlowe's Edward II (Greg, Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration , no. 129) has the imprint, 'Imprinted at London for William Iones | dwelling neere Holbourne conduit, at the | signe of the Gunne . 1594.' This is a 4°-form octavo collating A-M 4 , the text starting on sig. A2 and ending with a colophon on M3 r . Sig. M3 v is blank and so presumably was M4 r-v , wanting in the only two recorded copies. Whether this 1594 edition is the first or the second is a matter that has been in legitimate doubt. The imperfect copy of the next, or 1598, edition in the Dyce Collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum has had its first two leaves, the titlepage and the first seventy lines of text (plus the head-title and two lines of opening stage-direction), supplied by two leaves of manuscript written in an early hand. (A photographic reproduction is provided in the Malone Society Reprint [for 1925] prepared by W. W. Greg.) That the manuscript copy was not made from the 1598 quarto is clear from the readings, some of which follow 1594 instead of the 1598 variants; but that any of the manuscript variants from 1594 (and 1598) reproduce the readings of an edition earlier than 1594 is in the nature of the case not to be demonstrated (see footnote 9). No single reading offers what can be accepted as a good original corrupted in 1594, and indeed the numerous manuscript variants appear to be exclusively errors, sometimes of a singular and inexplicable kind arising from extreme carelessness. Probably no serious question of the copy would have been raised on the evidence were it not that in this transcript the date of the titlepage imprint is given as '1593'. This fact, combined with the July 6, 1593, date of entry for the play in the Stationers' Register, 1 has led critics — following Tucker Brooke and Greg — to take with some seriousness the possibility that the known 1594 quarto 2 may be the second and that an original 1593 edition may have been lost. Bibliographical evidence not previously adduced suggests that no such 1593 edition existed, that the manuscript date must in some manner be an error, and that the preserved 1594 quarto represents the actual first edition. In a Duke University dissertation The Printing of the Early Editions of Marlowe's Plays (University Microfilms, 1964), pages 59-72, Dr. Robert Ford Welsh examined the printing of the 1594 quarto and came to several conclusions that appear to be substantiated by the detailed evidence he offers. The book was printed presumably on one press by the efficient use of two skeleton-formes imposing respectively the inner and outer formes of each sheet in normal and unvaried sequence. Typesetting began not with sheet A (containing the titlepage and six pages of text) but instead with sheet B and progressed seriatim through sheet M, after which sheet A was both typeset and machined. The evidence is of three kinds. First, the patterns of substituted roman for italic sorts is found in contiguous pages between both formes in sheets C and L and nowhere is such substitution confined to a single forme in a sheet in a manner that appears to have significance. Other evidence that can be added confirms Dr. Welsh's conclusions. For instance, on B1 and B1 v the regular 'W' types are set, but beginning on B2 and continuing on B2 v , B3, B3 v , and B4 there is a substitution of 'VV' in all but one occurrence until on B4 v the setting of 'W' resumes. Also in this sheet the roman 'I' begins to run short on sig. B3 v so that italic ' I ' is substituted throughout starting towards the foot of sig. B3 v and continuing not only on B4 of the inner forme but also on B4 v of the outer forme. Italic ' I ' begins to reappear at the foot of sig. C2 v of the outer forme, is present on sigs. C3 v and C4 of the inner forme, and also on C4 v of the outer. Later sheets have the same pattern with this 'I' shortage as well as with other shortages that developed. This evidence shows that setting was not by formes from cast-off copy but instead was seriatim. Second, the pattern of the reappearance of identified pieces of type is regular between sheets B and M, types from the distribution of the formes of one sheet usually reappearing two sheets later, as types from sheet B in sheet D, from C in E, and so on through types of K in sheet M. However, distributed types from sheet A are not found in sheets B or C or succeeding sheets, but distributed types from L are found in sheet A. This indicates the typesetting of sheet A after sheet M. Third, the completion of the book by the machining of sheet A is also suggested by the evidence of the running-titles. From sheet B to sheet L the four running-titles in each skeleton remain absolutely fixed in their positions without shifting in relation to each other within the skeletons and without a turn of the skeleton in the imposition. Since the text of sheet M concluded on M3 r , the running-titles identified as VII and VIII which had appeared respectively on L4 and L3 v were removed from the inner forme of M's skeleton, and running-title IV (which had appeared on L4 v ) was taken from M4 v in the outer forme. When sheet A came to be printed, running-titles were needed only for sigs. A2 v -4 v . In the outer forme of A on sigs. A2 v and A3 running-titles II and III appear in their regular places, but VI, which had last appeared on sig. L1 v of the inner forme, having been removed from the inner forme of M, appears on sig. A4 v instead of IV. In the skeleton for inner A, running-titles V and VIII from inner M appear on A4 and A3 v respectively as the only necessary headlines, but taken in the case of VIII (A3 v ) from sig. L3 v since VI from M1 v had been detached for use in outer A as A4 v , leaving only V to transfer from the skeleton-forme of inner M to inner A. This running-title V from M2 is placed, with a turn of the forme, on A4. The dislocation of the running-titles by which they break their formes uniquely in sheet A is most readily explicable as occurring by reason of the imposition of the formes of sheet A from the skeletons of sheet M. As Dr. Welsh remarks, the evidence is not reversible, for "Were we to suppose that sheet A was the first to be printed, this evidence would force us to the difficult conjecture that after A outer had been printed, headline VI was taken from the skeleton imposing A outer and inserted in a different skeleton for the imposition of B inner." 3 The running-title evidence alone is perhaps no more than suggestive, but its interpretation is promoted to high probability if not to certainty by the evidence from identified sorts that distributed types from sheet A did not find their way into subsequent sheets but that types from sheet L may be found in sheet A at the identical distance from the distributed formes observed throughout the rest of the book. It would seem, then, that composition and printing began with sheet B and progressed in regular order by seriatim typesetting page by page accompanied by regular machining of the sheets through sheet M, whereupon sheet A with its titlepage and text was composed and printed to conclude work on the quarto. One can now see how Dr. Welsh's technical evidence about the printing can be applied to the problem whether the 1594 quarto is the first or second edition. Bibliographers have long recognized both in theory and in observation of practice that the printer of a first edition would generally begin with the text and leave the preliminaries for the last in order to accommodate any last-minute additions or alterations in the front-matter but that the printer of a simple reprint, since no changes in the preliminaries would ordinarily be anticipated, was likely in the vast majority of cases to start with the first sheet of the book, without regard for its contents, and to reprint the copy-edition in order. 4 That the printer of the 1594 quarto 5 in dealing with a posthumous play for which he had been furnished no preliminaries save for the titlepage would start his signing with A for the first text gathering is not necessarily to be wondered at, for there are parallels to this procedure. Evidently preliminaries were not anticipated, but if they had most unexpectedly arrived after sheet A was printed they could have been inserted in a separate half-sheet, arbitrarily signed, following the title. However, such an insertion is not always very convenient to bind-in, and it would appear that Robinson wisely left his options open by instead casting off copy for six pages of text and then beginning composition with sheet B. In this manner he protected himself from any eventuality. If, as actually occurred, no preliminaries arrived, he could set sheet A as it appears in the quarto. If extra material were sent to him during the printing, he could set its last one or two pages as sig. A1 and prefix a title-leaf either as part of a half or full sheet or as a single leaf that with luck might be printed as part of the final gathering. If, instead, he had started the text on sheet B, and no preliminaries had come in, he was stuck either with a single-leaf title or a somewhat uneconomic half-sheet with the first leaf blank. In short, he planned his quarto expertly and emerged with honor. 6 The clear implication of his treatment of sheet A, however, is that he was setting a first edition for which the matter of preliminaries might still be thought uncertain. If the 1594 quarto had been a reprint of a 1593 first edition, this procedure would have been unnecessary. Dr. Welsh's evidence about the printing of the book is clear as applying to the order of the composition and the progression of the sheets of a first edition through the press. This having been established, one can speculate that Robinson might well have set by formes what in a second edition of this particular lengthy quarto would almost necessarily have been a paginal reprint, whereas instead he set it seriatim. Moreover, a very small adjustment of the typography would have enabled him to have saved paper in a reprint by preparing for sheet M as a half-sheet of four pages instead of a more costly full sheet of only five. However, the evidence against 1594 as a reprint is not exhausted. Dr. Welsh (p. 60, fn. 4) remarked that he had found no evidence for a second compositor and thus conjectured that the entire book was set by a single workman. In fact, two compositors did set the quarto, Compositor X composing the five sheets A-E and Compositor Y the seven sheets F-M. The clue to the presence of these two workmen is the variant system of signing whereby the first three leaves of sheets A-E are signed but only the first two leaves of sheets F-M. Corroborative evidence from the text supports this bibliographical distinction without the need for the minutiae of a detailed series of spelling tests. Of the six appearances of 'France' in sheets A-E, the spelling is four times 'France' and twice 'Fraunce'; but of the thirteen occurrences in sheets F-M the spelling is twelve times 'Fraunce' and only once 'France'. In sheets A-E the exclamation 'Ah' occurs six times, and is invariably spelled 'Ah'. In sheets F-M 'Ah' appears fourteen times, of which no less than nine (starting with F4 v ) are given the rare variant spelling 'A'. (Marlowe's spelling, as we know from the manuscript fragment of The Massacre at Paris was 'Ah'.) Both compositors had some difficulty with part lines but Compositor X mislined his text only seven times whereas Compositor Y mislined his share twenty-two times and in more serious ways. If the number of required substantive emendations is any indication of expertness, supported by the problems of mislineation, Compositor Y was the less expert of the two, his share containing a minimum of seventeen necessary substantive changes to remove error whereas Compositor X made only eight, perhaps nine, substantive errors. 7 Whether it was the underlying text or compositorial styling cannot be determined, but at least it should be noticed that in Compositor X's stint there are no occurrences of 'Yea' or of colloquial 'A' for 'He', whereas Compositor Y has several of each. It would be mere speculation to take it that the use of two compositors with fairly even stints for seriatim setting of the first and latter parts of the text instead of for simultaneous composition has any bearing on the question of the 1594 quarto as first edition or as reprint. We have no means of knowing whether Robinson actually had more than one working press or if so what other books he was printing at this time and how he allocated his press-time. Instead, the significance seems to center on one particular treatment of copy by the two compositors that appears to have a pertinence to the problem. Variant spellings like 'France' or 'Fraunce' and 'Ah' or 'A' have little relevance in determining the nature of the underlying copy since the two compositors could impose such spelling habits either on printed or on manuscript copy. The incidence of substantive error, also, may not have a great deal to do with the case, for a high degree of error is not invariably a result of setting from manuscript. On the other hand, the extraordinary discrepancy between the ability of the two workmen to deal with problems of lineation, which are always present in setting from dramatic manuscripts, with especial reference to the correct determination of part lines without permitting them to throw off proper lineation, does appear to suggest that they were setting from manuscript and not from printed copy. 8 When Compositor X mistakes the correct lineation only seven times but Compositor Y fails in his interpretation of his copy no less than twenty-two times, the discrepancy is meaningful in conjecturing that a manuscript and not another printed edition was the copy for the 1594 quarto. Experience demonstrates that in setting reprints of dramatic quartos the cases are rare indeed in which a compositor takes upon himself to reline printed copy, no matter how faulty; and cases are rarer in which correctly lined printed copy is mislined in a reprint. If the 1594 edition were a reprint one would need to hypothesize that two compositors had set the 1593 edition in shares almost exactly the same as those assigned the compositors of 1594 and that Compositor Y was merely following the errors of his predecessor whereas Compositor X enjoyed the superior expertness of the compositor of the earlier sheets of 1593. Although this situation is not theoretically impossible, one would hesitate to hinge an argument on it for a lost 1593 edition. However, the indication from the marked difference in the degree of mislineation that the 1594 edition was set from manuscript joins with the powerful evidence of the order of printing sheet A in the manner of a first edition, not of a reprint, to introduce a double-pronged bibliographical conclusion. That is, in the absence of any trustworthy textual evidence to the contrary in the manuscript leaves of the 1598 Dyce copy, the odds may strongly favor the view, despite the date in the manuscript imprint, that in the 1594 quarto we have the actual first edition of Edward II . 9</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The date of registration was scarcely more than a month after Marlowe's murder. Naturally, the query has been made why Jones waited not less than five months, and possibly more, after acquiring title before he published the play if 1594 were the actual first-edition date. It is interesting also that the Register entry repeats the wording of the printed title though without the statement of acting, an indication, perhaps, of some preparation for the press. 2 For convenience the book is here referred to as a quarto (the actual method by which its cut halves of double sheets were machined on the press) although technically it is an octavo, distinguished as a 4°-form octavo. 3 To this statement (p. 61) Dr. Welsh adds a footnote which is pertinent to the argument, "We should also have to suppose, of course, that between the printing of A inner and the imposition of B inner headline V was moved to the opposite quarter of the skeleton." 4 For the basic discussion of this matter see R. B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography (1927), pp. 184 ff. This early examination, however, puts excessive weight on the question for a first edition whether a particular book may begin with the text in sheet A or in a later sheet, leaving A or arbitrary signs or other expedients for the preliminaries. For a useful corrective, see R. C. Bald, "Evidence and Inference in Bibliography," English Institute Annual: 1941 (1942), pp. 162-163. In fact, Marlowe's and Nashe's Dido (1594), and Doctor Faustus B-text (1616) were also printed with sheet A last, like Edward II . 5 This printer, on the evidence of the ornaments, and the initial on A2, was Robert Robinson, not Richard Bradock as conjectured by Greg (no. 129). See Robert Ford Welsh, "The Printer of the 1594 Octavo of Marlowe's Edward II ," SB , 17 (1964), 197-198. 6 One may speculate, however, that he had not perhaps cast off the whole text since he left himself with blank leaf M4. Because he was not setting by formes, or by simultaneous setting and printing in two halves, an exact casting-off was not required. 7 The question of expertness may just possibly be involved in the reason why Compositor X was brought back at the end to set cast-off sheet A, in addition to the partial equalizing of the stints that resulted. Professor Hinman has found that in the Shakespeare First Folio the apprentice Compositor E was not entrusted with the setting of head-titles and the text around initial letters. Since especial expertness would be required for the more difficult task of composing a balanced titlepage, it may be that one of the causes for the return of Compositor X was the need to set up the title on sig. A1. Of course, he may have started composition of sheet A while Y was finishing sheet M and thus speeded up the conclusion of the typesetting. 8 For the difference with which two compositors could treat the lining of difficult copy, see the Textual Introduction to Cupid's Revenge in The Dramatic Works in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon , ed. Bowers, 2 (1970), 324 ff. 9 It would then follow that if a lost edition of 1593 was not the copy for the Dyce manuscript leaves, the readings permit only the 1594 quarto to have been the source. In the seventy-two lines of stage-direction and text transcribed in the manuscript leaves Greg lists sixteen substantive differences between manuscript and the 1594 text, all of them manuscript errors so far as can be told. Many of these are egregious and make a hash of the sense, such as Its for 1594 As (22), bakt for Rakt (23), eate for dart (44), and gasing for grazing (62). It is not properly evidence, but one cannot help observing that a mistake in the date is no more careless than some of the errors in the text. Greg remarks, however, that whereas the date 1598 in a printed edition might be mistaken for 1593, the evidence is clear that the transcript was not made from a copy of the 1598 quarto. See, for instance, manuscript and 1594 horses but 1598 horse in line 31 and an for 1598 the in line 63. Also, significantly, 1594 Porpintine and manuscript Porpentine but 1598 Porcupine in line 43. In the Introduction to the Methuen edition of Edward II (1933) the editors Charlton and Waller (pp. 3-5) agree with Tucker Brooke that the manuscript variants thine, dinner , and Sylvan for 1594 thy, dinner time , and Sylvian (11,34, 61) are preferable, but this is much a matter of opinion and leans heavily on two manuscript normalizations and one mending of the metre. If these were indeed the readings of a 1593 edition, the rather extraordinary departures from them of a reprint in 1594 (away from normality) are difficult to account for since in the same breath the editors argue for the serious manuscript errors of Its, bakt, eate , and by (22,23,44,69), to which should be added gasing (62) and tantum (24), though corrected in 1594, as 1593 "mistakes which might easily be made by a printer working hastily from manuscript to catch a public still excited by Marlowe's death," and conclude, "It will be noticed that the six cases adduced by Tucker Brooke as inferior readings in the manuscript are really stronger evidence for the existence of a 1593 edition than the three in which the manuscript seems preferable; for the latter might be improvements made by the scribe himself, whereas Its, bakt , and eate require explanation by some antecedent corruption." There is difficulty in accepting this view. Superficially, of course, it is easier to account for the Dyce manuscript corruptions not as scribal errors in transcribing printed copy but as compositorial errors setting from manuscript. But in the seventy lines of manuscript text plus two lines of stage-direction there are sixteen substantive variants from 1594, and if only three are to be taken as certain 1594 corruptions, then we are left with six clear errors in the Dyce transcript purporting to come from the 1593 printed copy but corrected in 1594. To these, however, must be added seven more indifferent substantive variants that in the nature of the case cannot all be 1594 reprint corruptions but must in some part at least be taken as present in the hypothetical 1593 edition. To extrapolate that high proportion of one substantive error for at least every ten lines of 1593 throughout the rest of the text would be a fantastic proposition scarcely to be supported by the evidence of 1594, no matter how much haste might have occurred in the 1593 setting. The logic of this argument will not bear scrutiny.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Early Editions of Marlowe's Ovid's Elegies by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The order of the editions, the textual transmission, and the authority of the various texts of Christopher Marlowe's translation of Ovid's Amores have not been completely studied. The problems are complex but, fortunately, not insoluble. In all, six editions have been preserved, 1 each undated and purporting to have been printed in Middleburgh in the Low Countries. 2 Two of these editions — obviously the earliest — contain a selection of only ten elegies 3 which are printed as the second section of a book that begins with the Epigrams of Sir John Davies and includes as well three amatory poems headed 'Ignoto'. The third and later editions present all of the elegies; 4 in these editions the Ignoto poems are dropped and Davies's epigrams follow the elegies, distinguished merely by a head-title. The titlepages reflect this different order, obviously an indication of the relative popularity of the two parts. The earliest two editions, those containing the selection of the elegies, are listed in the Short-Title Catalogue under number 6350 as one edition, erroneously as duodecimos, and with a ghost copy in the Bodleian Library. The cross-entry 18930 under Ovid corrects this entry (although misspelling the imprint as 'Middlebourgh'), lists the two properly as octavos, drops the Bodleian copy, and assigns the order as the Huntington copy (1595?) and the British Museum copy (1598?). 5 Strictly bibliographical evidence, not previously presented, confirms this order. The earliest known edition, then, is O1, preserved in the Henry E. Huntington Library, an octavo collating A-G 4 (A1, G4 blank and wanting), unpaged, with the titlepage on A2 reading 'EPIGRAMMES | and | ELEGIES. | By I. D. and | C. M. | [two blocks of type-orn. arranged horizontally] | At Middleborough .' The text of Davies begins on sig. A3 and ends on D3 v with a 'FINIS. I. D. ' The second section begins on sig. E1 with the title 'CERTAINE | OF OVIDS | ELEGIES | By C. Marlow. | [two blocks of type-orn. as on A2] | At Middleborough .' The type of the imprint and the type-ornaments on the two titlepages are identical. Sig. E1 v is blank. Marlowe's text begins on sig. E2 and ends on G3 v . The first signed leaf is signed 'A3'. Thereafter only the first leaf of a gathering is signed, with the letter alone, as 'B', 'C', and so on, and the second and third leaves are signed only with the arabic numbers '2' and '3' respectively. The fourth leaves are unsigned. The first text leaf in Marlowe's section is signed 'E2', the third is simply '3', and thereafter the same system obtains (F1 is in italic). The general system for catchwords is to place a catchword only on sig. $4 v of the gatherings. Catchwords in Davies's section occur on sigs. B4 v and C4 v . Sig. D4 v precedes the title to Marlowe's poems and thus has no catchword. In the Elegies sig. E4 v lacks a catchword, probably because Marlowe's signature at the foot of the elegy ending on E4 v left little room. However, F4 v has the catchword 'Amorum' for Elegy III.vi beginning on G1. The first three elegies, all in sheet E, are signed at the foot 'C. Marlowe.' and 'C. Marlow.' (twice). Thereafter, starting with II.xv on F1 r-v the elegies are unsigned. The principle of selection seems to have been to start Book I and thereupon to make a selection from the more erotic of the poems, arranged in no perceptible order. The system of signing the leaves is a characteristic of the Edinburgh printer Robert Waldegrave, but some doubt may be cast on his having printed this book, not so much by the Middleburgh imprint (which is a convention and need not be taken seriously), but instead by the system of placing catchwords only on the last page of gatherings (as in some early manuscripts and the books that imitated them) — not one of his habits. Firm establishment of the unknown printer could be made only by identification of the mix of specific broken and damaged types in his font corresponding to the mix in this book. It may be that Waldegrave would prove to be the printer, or a printer abroad, or even Thomas Scarlet in London who — the late Mr. John Crow confirmed — also used this signing convention on occasion. The date is equally uncertain. The second edition (O2), another octavo, has been known only in the British Museum copy (C.34.a.28), which is imperfect, wanting sig. A4 of the text as well as the blanks A1 and G4. However, an unrecorded copy exists in the Carl H. Pforzheimer Library 6 which, though wanting A1, G4, does preserve A4, which contains a substantive variant from O1 in line 4 of "In Rufam" that is perpetuated in later editions. This O2 is a close imitation of the Huntington edition and collates the same, with the same system of signing the leaves. The titlepage repeats that of O1 except that the imprint reads ' At Middleborugh .' both in the general and the section title; however, although the same design of type-ornament is employed, only one block, made up from two halves, decorates the titles. The section title reads, 'CERTAINE | OF OVIDS | ELEGIES. | By C Marlowe, | [block of type-orn.] | At Middleborugh .' When the two earliest editions of a book are paginal reprints of each other with the same date or undated as in the present example, general typographical characteristics and the corruption of readings may offer some small hints as to their order, but the case can seldom be really proved when strict bibliographical evidence is absent. Fortunately, such evidence can be identified in these two editions to demonstrate with certainty the priority of the Huntington (CSmH) edition and the fact that the British Museum and Pforzheimer edition is the reprint. For example, on sig. D3, in line 10 of Davies's Epigram 47, the error 'starres' occurs in O2, which can be explained by reference to CSmH 'States' with a broken second 't' that resembles an 'r'. A better example comes on sig. E3 v in Marlowe's Elegy I.v, line 10, where the O2 nonsense error 'trells' is explicable only by reason of the use in CSmH 'tresses' of a broken ligatured pair of long s's that closely resemble a double 'll'. Similarly, on sig. F4 v in Elegy II.x.36 the O2 error 'let' was caused by a broken long 's' in CSmH 'set' that is very like an 'l'. Less obvious corroborative evidence of the same kind appears on sig. E3 when an O2 period in I.iii.18 can perhaps be explained as resulting from a CSmH comma so broken as to resemble a full stop. Four lines down better evidence appears in the commonplace error of O2 'loue' where CSmH 'Ioue' is set with a damaged 'I' that is difficult to distinguish from an 'l'. A really anomalous period in O2 on sig. G3 appears in I.ii.34 after 'Io' as the result of a damaged comma in CSmH that could readily be mistaken. Although the compositor of the BM edition imitated the unusual signing of the Huntington edition, he was less successful in restraining his normal impulse to set catchwords. Hence he omitted the catchword only on sigs. B2 r-v , B4, C2 v , C3, D1, D2, D3, D4, E2, E2 v , F1 v , G1 (and on E3 v , E4 v where the Marlowe signatures left no room). This irregularity suggests copying CSmH rather than an original most eccentric practice. Another small piece of evidence is useful for the same conclusion. The British Museum edition is a line-for-line and page-for-page reprint up to sig. G1, where Huntington has 23 lines but BM only 21. On G1 v and G2 CSmH has the usual 29 lines, whereas BM adds an extra line 30 in order to catch up. As a result, on G2 both editions end with the same line and the paginal reprinting is resumed. The anomaly in BM seems to have been created by two extra lines of white space set under the title of III.vi heading sig. G1. It would seem that when he discovered the error the compositor preferred to tie up the page and to add the extra lines to G1 v and G2 instead of disturbing the title arrangement. The text of O2 is marked by many literal errors, more usual perhaps in a reprint than in an original, and by a considerable amount of corruption in the readings. In the Epigrams O1 prints two lines in no. 40, "In Afrum," not found in any other edition. One cause of the omission — the eyeskip caused by the repetition 'No sooner' — suggests, further, that O2 was the reprint. In O1 lines 9-12 read No sooner is a shippe at sea surprisde, But straight he learnes the newes and doth disclose it No sooner hath the Turke a plot deuisde To conquer Christendom, but straight he knows it, In O2 and in all other editions lines 11-12 are wanting. (In the Elegies O2 omits I.xiii.14.) The Elegies contain a few variants that ordinarily would seem to go beyond reprint corruption. For example, on sig. E3 line 3 of I.iii O1 'I aske too much' becomes 'I craue too much', and in line 7 O1 'If loftie titles cannot make me thine' becomes the hypermetrical 'Yf loftiest titles cannot cause me to be thine'. Yet this apparently is true corruption (picking up Marlovian readings elsewhere), for this page has other examples of manifestly unauthoritative variants. In line 2 the sense is sophisticated by the substitution in O2 of 'euer' for O1's 'neuer' in the line 'Either loue, or cause that I may neuer hate'; in line 6 a hypermetrical 'thee' is added after O1 'loue' in "Accept him that will loue with spotlesse truth', an error picked up by contamination from the preceding line, 'Accept him that will serue thee all his youth'. In line 19 O2 has the dittographic 'the the' for O1 'the'. More of this sort of variation follows on sig. E3 v where in I.v.23 O1 'likt' is altered to O2 'pleasde' and in the next line O1 'naked bodie' becomes 'faire white body'. The variants continue sporadically, as in III.xiii on sig. E4 where in line 2 O1 'But let not mee poore soule know of thy straying' is changed to O2 'wit of thy straying'; in line 16 'folke' becomes hypermetrical 'people', and in line 18 'tricks' is altered to 'toyes'. In the third edition where the text of the first edition O1 has in some part been collated against another manuscript, all such cases of O2 variation are ignored and the readings remain those found in O1. This fact appears to confirm the belief that the altered words in O2 when they are deliberate and not merely mechanical errors or memorial lapses have no authority, that their nature is such as to make it highly doubtful that they derived from consultation of another manuscript, and thus that they probably originated with the publisher looking over the copy and 'improving' it for the worse, even though a few necessary corrections were made in the process. The first of the complete editions, which substitutes 'All' for 'Certaine' in the title and provides the full roster of elegies, is O3, represented by the Bodleian Library copy, Mason. AA.207. Other copies are found in the Dyce Collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum and in the Huntington Library. This is STC 18931 a , but the STC attribution of two issues to the Bodleian is in error. The titlepage reads, 'ALL | OVIDS ELEGIES: | 3. BOOKES. | By C. M. | Epigrams by I. D. | [double row of three asterisk orns., each row within square brackets] | At Middlebourgh .' This octavo collates A-F 8 G 4 ; Marlowe's elegies are now arrayed in order (as distinct from their O1 jumble), starting on sig. A2 and ending with 'FINIS.' on sig. F3 v . Davies's Epigrams start on F4 with a headtitle and end on G4 v with 'FINIS. I. D. ' The elegies not previously printed must, of course, have come from some manuscript. The possible effects of this manuscript on the text of the reprinted Certaine Elegies will be touched on below; but, first things coming first, one must see whether these ten elegies were printed in O3 from this manuscript. Or, on the other hand, whether in the standard Elizabethan manner — as has been demonstrated in the copy for such texts as the Folio version of Shakespeare's Othello , or of Richard III , or Troilus and Cressida , or King Lear — the publisher or the printer of O3 may have manufactured what was regarded as superior copy for the compositor by annotating the ten poems of O1 or O2 to bring them into general conformity with the readings of the manuscript. Until one or other procedure is established, no critic (or editor) is in a position to evaluate the authority of specific readings in the texts, not alone where they disagree but even where they agree with each other. 7 As a source of the Elegies in O3, O2 must be ruled out because O3 consistently retains O1 readings in all but four indifferent cases of variation between O1 and O2. 8 The best evidence that O1 served as printer's copy for the ten selected elegies would be mechanical and bibliographical, like that utilized to show that O2 must derive from O1 because it misread damaged O1 types. As is usually found when annotated copy is in question, this evidence is too sparse to take the whole weight of the case, but a few examples may be observed. In O1 I.iii.9 the final 's' of 'lands' is damaged so that in the Huntington edition the top part barely prints. Given a lighter impression than in this copy the 's' might not have been legible, and such a fault could explain the O3 reading 'land'. 9 More trustworthy evidence comes at I.iii.25 where a comma after 'rung' in O1 is damaged and looks very like a period, and a period (a real anomaly) is found in O3. 10 Then in III.vi.38 an O3 misprint 'moned' can perhaps be explained by reference to the typography of O1. In O1 the correct word 'loued' is turned under with a parenthesis so that the lines appear as Huge okes, hard Adamantes might she have moued, And with sweete words cause deafe rockes to haue Worthy she was to moue both God &amp; men (loued It would seem more than possible that the O3 compositor's eye, coming to the end of the line with 'to haue', was confused and by a slip, visual or memorial, he set 'moued' (with a turned 'u') from the preceding line, as if it had been turned up, instead of the turned-under 'loued'. 11 Finally, a standard Elizabethan confusion in reprints (already observed in O1-2) appears in O3 at I.iii.4 where O1 reads 'Loue', O2 'loue', and O3, incorrectly, ' Ioue '. Although it is true that the confusion usually results from lower-case 'l' as in O2, in this example the O2 'I' is clearly inked but the Huntington's 'L' is damaged and might in haste be mistaken for an 'I', especially since at first sight the context might seem to call for Jove. 12 These pieces of evidence do not add up to anything like demonstration but they may at least suggest the possibility that O3 had a printed source for the ten reprinted elegies. Less mechanical textual evidence may thus be brought up in support of the hypothesis. Of all parts of a text's accidentals, the punctuation is most likely to be compositorial owing to the usual light and sometimes almost non-existent punctuation of Elizabethan poetical manuscript whether dramatic or not. Thus identical anomalies in punctuation between two editions are more likely to reflect derivation of one from the other than independent compositorial faithfulness to faulty manuscript pointing. For example, in I.v.13-14 O1 (and O2) reads I snatcht her gowne being thin, the harme was small Yet striude she to be couered therewithall, where the comma after 'thin' is clearly wrong and should have been placed after 'gowne'. Although end-stopping the line with a comma after 'small', O3 repeats the mistaken modification offered by the comma after 'thin' instead of 'gowne'. Similarly, in II.iv.33-36 O1 (and O2) reads If she be tall, shees like an amazon, And therefore filles the bed she lies vppon, If short, she lies the rounder to speake troth, Both short and long please me, for I loue both: where O3 prints the last couplet as If short, she lies the rounder to say troth Both short and long please me, for I loue both. The removal of the O1-2 comma after 'troth' is only a partial improvement, for O3 still follows the lack of a comma or a stronger stop after 'rounder', an error that may well have originated in the O1 printed copy. One of the best examples of O1,3 concurrence in unusual or erroneous punctuation comes in I.iii.10. In O1 lines 7-12 read If loftie titles cannot make me thine, That am descended but of knightly line. Soone may you plow the little lands I haue, I gladly graunt my parents giuen, to saue. Apollo, Bacchus, and the Muses may, And Cupide who hath markt me for thy pray. This passage is so contorted in its translation as to cause considerable difficulty. Modern editors treat lines 9-10 as parenthetical, but they are not so in Ovid nor, properly, in Marlowe. The difficulty comes in the failure of the translation to distinguish a number of parallel statements each prefaced by if , which are (1) if I am only of knightly birth, (2) if my land is so small that numberless ploughshares are not needed to till it, (3) if my parents are penurious and not generous, yet at least I shall have on my side Apollo, etc. The O3 editor or compositor seemingly could make little of these lines, and followed the punctuation exactly save for substituting a comma after 'line' for the O1 period. In the crucial and gnomic line 10, however, O3 — one would suggest not by accident — duplicates not only the wrong O1 comma after 'giuen' but also the wrong period after 'saue'. Other punctuation anomalies are less striking, but several unusual placements of question marks in O3 seem to relate it to O1. An example occurs at I.i.11-12 in which O1-2 read That if thy Mother take Dianas bowe? Shall Dian fanne when loue begins to glowe. Here O3 follows the query after the first line instead of after the second, something of a characteristic of O1 typesetting. (O3, however, corrects the O1 error 'That' to 'What'.) Another case appears in III.vi.15-18, where O1 reads Like a dull Cipher, or rude blocke I lay, Or shad, or body was Io? who can say, What will my age do? age I cannot shunne, Seeing in my prime my force is spent and done, In O3 this is printed as Like a dull Cipher, or rude block I lay, Or shade, or body was I who can say? What will my age do? age I cannot shunne, When in my prime my force is spent and done. This substitutes the more conventional spelling 'shade' for what is perhaps an O1 misprint, and corrects the O1 misprint 'Io'. Of more concern is the intelligent repunctuating that transfers the question mark after 'I' to substitute for O1's comma after 'say', the lack of a stop after 'I' perhaps being the result of this mending, and particularly the anomaly of a comma after 'shade' as in O1 but — with the new punctuation — no stop after 'body'. The real misunderstanding in O1, however, lay in the compositor's failure to recognize 'age I cannot shunne' as a parenthesis within the total query 'What . . . spent and done' which should thus have had no question mark after 'do' but instead one after 'done'. This same error is repeated faithfully in O3 save for the substitution of a closing period for O1's comma. The O3 pointing here does not seem to be an independent interpretation of manuscript punctuation, or lack of it. 13 One may also note the lack of capitalization of 'age' in both texts. The attempt in the above passage on the part of the O3 compositor to mark the line 16 query by an appropriate question mark may emphasize the various times that O3 follows O1 in commas or periods when question marks of the same sort are definitely called for, as in I.ii.5-6 where O3 repeats the O1 period after 'him' in the second line of the couplet Were loue the cause, it's like I should descry him, Or lies he close, and shoots where none can spie him. Another example occurs in I.xiii.33-34. O1 prints Say that thy loue with Cæphalus were not knowne, Then thinkest thou thy loose life is not shown. Here O3 agrees with the final period where a query is required. A third case is in III.xiii.11-12, where O1 reads will you make shipwracke of your honest name, And let the world be witnesse of the same: Here O3 placed a question mark after 'name' but substituted an anomalous period for the O1 colon after 'same', where the question mark should ordinarily have come. Again, O3 seems under the influence of O1, although attempting an improvement. (O2 here reads with O3.) Exactly the same situation occurs again in I.xiii.41-42. In O1 the couplet runs Punish ye me, because yeares make him waine, I did not bid thee wed an aged swaine. Once more O3 sees the need for a question mark but mistakenly follows the O1 comma after 'waine' and places the query, incorrectly, after 'swaine'. (Incidentally, in line 41 O3 prints 'Doest punish me' for O1 'Punish ye me'.) To suggest that one text derives from another because it duplicates certain spellings is always difficult without such a compositorial analysis as will indicate the percentages of spelling preferences and of tolerances in the compositor conjecturally coming under the influence of certain copy. Therefore not a great deal of weight can be placed on an example like the following without an analysis of the O3 compositor in other books (if the printer could be identified 14 ) as well as in this. But the spelling 'yong-young' is at least suggestive. The O1 compositor never varies from 'yong', whereas the O3 compositor shows a preference for 'young'. For instance, in Ben Jonson's version of I.xv, in line 4 the compositor violates visual rhyme (against his strong custom of spelling rhyme words alike) by matching 'young' with 'sprong' as a rhyme. In I.ii.13 he spells O1 'Yong' as 'Young' but appears to fall under the influence of O1 copy at line 27 when he follows O1 'Yong', as also in I.xv.4, II.iv.41, and III.vi.53 where O2 had 'young' in all three places but O1,3 print 'yong'. Yet the value of this evidence may be called in question by the appearance in elegies set from manuscript of 'yong' in II.iii.3 and of 'yong-mens' in II.xvi.17, although these examples are all. The spelling evidence for O1 copy, then, will concentrate not on preferential spellings being interrupted by copy but instead on suggesting the influence of O1 on O3 either where the coincidence is unique or where the spelling is distinctly unusual. A striking example of O3 following O1 in a rhyme spelling comes in III.xiii.3-4 Nor do I giue thee counsaile to liue chaste, But that thou wouldst dissemble when tis paste where 'chaste-paste' is also the spelling in O3 although O2 and O4-6 all read 'chast-past'. Another striking example, this time of O3 following what may perhaps be a transposition misprint in O1, or else an eccentric spelling, occurs in I.xiii.13 where O1 and O3 read 'Poore trauailers though tierd' (O2: 'tired'). Elsewhere, O3 in copy set from manuscript has 'tire' in I.vi.44 (although as a rhyme word with 'hire') and 'tyred' in III.x.13, and it follows O1 'tir'd' in II.x.34. Because of the slight possibility of a misprint in O1 (although see O1 'fier' for 'fire'), this is particularly strong evidence. In I.v.4 O1-3 read 'twincles' but in copy set from manuscript the other occurrences in O3 are represented by 'twinckles' twice in I.viii (and 'wrinkles' in II.iv.7, 'anckles' in III.v.6). Significant, perhaps, is the fact that O3 invariably spells 'Oh' as 'O', this happening at least a dozen times in copy set from manuscript, and that the only appearance in its pages of 'Oh' comes when it repeats O1-2 'Oh' at II.iv.6. No weight at all can be placed on O3 and O1 agreeing at III.vi.23 in 'boorded' in the light of O3 (from manuscript) 'boord' in I.iv and 'foord' in III.v. However, although these next examples are not in a class with 'paste' and 'tierd' above, nevertheless it is interesting to see O3 agree with O1 in 'wooddie groues' (O2: 'woodie') in I.i.13, in 'fauorit' (I.i.23), 'easly' (I.ii.10), 'glimps' (I.v.5), and 'touldst' (O2: 'toldst') in II.x.1, this last the only time that 'told' is so spelled in O3. The agreement in 'doote' for 'do't in II.x.22 is interesting. In I.xiii O3 spells ' Cœphalus ' in line 33 but, more correctly, ' Cephalus ' in line 39. Possibly the first spelling was under the influence of O1 'Cæphalus' found in both lines. Finally, one can call on the evidence of common errors that are more likely to be O1's compositorial mistakes than mistranslations. The first comes in I.i.33-34, where O1 reads Elegian Muse, that warblest amorous laies, Girte my shine browe with sea banke mirtle praise. Here editors have adopted the Dyce emendation 'sprays' for 'praise' in view of the memorial confusion possible from the sound of the two, of the fact that myrtle is not a wreath that honors the wearer and thus could not be said to praise him (but is it praising Venus?), and of the Latin which gives no hint of 'praise', cingere litorea flaventia tempora myrto — surround with shore-loving myrtle your shining temples. A similar case involving necessary emendation comes in I.xv.3-4 which reads in O1-2 Or that unlike the line from whence I come, Wars dustie honors are refusde being yong, where 'come' is repeated in O3, as is the spelling 'yong', although editors since Dyce, on the example of Jonson's version in O3, rhyming 'sprong-young', have emended Marlowe. Jonson cannot be an authority here since it is probable that he was influenced in his translation by O1 or O2, not by a manuscript; nevertheless, his word may very well be what Marlowe also wrote, for such a marked assonance and non-rhyme are unknown elsewhere in the elegies. If 'sprong' is correct, therefore, and 'come' is an O1 error, then the appearance in O3 of 'come' derives from its use of O1. However, a much better and less arguable example appears in I.ii.51-52 where an O1 misreading or sophistication seems to have been transferred to O3: Behold thy kinsmans Caesars prosperous bandes, Who gardes thee conquered with his conquering hands. Here the Latin adspice cognati felicia Caesaris arma — | qua vicit, victos protegit ille manu (Look but on the fortunate arms of thy kinsman Caesar — the hand that has made him victor, he uses to shield the vanquished) gives no warrant for the O1-3 reading which makes Cupid the conquered guarded by Caesar. It would appear, then, that O1 'thee' is a misprint or misreading transferred to O3, and the reading should be 'the conquered' as emended by Dyce. The third example seems equally persuasive. In I.xv.17-18 O1 reads While bond-men cheat, fathers hoord, bawds hoorish And strumpets flatter, shall Menander flourish and 'hoord' is the reading in O3. The Latin here is durus pater , which in the succeeding version in O3 Jonson translated as Whilst Slaues be false, Fathers hard, &amp; Bauds be whorish Whilst Harlots flatter, shall Menander florish. It is difficult to take it that 'hoord' is Marlowe's archetypal word transferred independently from two manuscripts to O1 and O3. In the first place, the O1-3 line limps badly and must be corrupt. The reason seems to be that the original word 'hard' was mistaken by an a:o confusion for the verb 'hoard', perhaps under the influence of the preceding verb 'cheat' and the following verb 'flatter', and the intervening word 'be' ('fathers be hard' is the usual emendation) — which also is required to modify 'hoorish' — was overlooked or ignored. As a result, a grammatical mess and an imperfect line resulted in O1, to be repeated faithfully by O3, 15 even to the spelling 'hoorded' although 'hoorish' was modernized. In conjunction with the misprint or misreading 'thee' followed in I.ii.52, this misreading 'hoord' may help to clinch the case for the reprinting of the ten elegies by O3 influenced by O1 copy, and this conclusion is aided by the various pieces of slight bibliographical evidence and by other examples of O1 influence on O3, most notably in the misprint or odd spelling 'tierd'. If more proof were needed, it may be found in I.ii.31-32, which read in O1, faithfully followed by O3 (as by O2): Good meaning shame, and such as seeke loues wrack Shall follow thee, their hands tied at their backe. It would seem that O3 has repeated an O1 printer's error in omitting the necessary comma after 'meaning'. From the Latin Mens Bona ducetur manibus post terge retortia | et Pudor, et castris quidquid Amoris obest (Conscience shall be led along, with hands tied fast behind her back, and Modesty, and all who are foes to the camp of Love), it is clear that 'Good meaning' is not a compound adjective modifying 'shame' but instead an independent noun and personification in series with 'shame', and with 'such as seeke'. Wrongly punctuated O1 copy, not independent error from manuscript, most satisfactorily explains the O3 reading. One more example of O3 following O1 in error occurs in II.x.33-34. O1 reads Let marchants seeke wealth with periured lips, And being wrackt, carowse the sea tir'd by their ships: which is repeated in O3 except for a semicolon after 'lips', no comma after 'wrackt', and a period after 'ships'. The first line is imperfect unless one wishes to make 'periured' into three syllables, an arguable matter. More important, the second line as it reads in O1,3 is an unexampled hexameter. The odds strongly favor the Cunningham emendation which transfers the 'And' of line 34 to line 33, placed after 'wealth'. This has the virtue of making the metre of both lines regular; but in addition it brings the lines into conformity with Ovid's Latin, quaerat avarus opes et, quae lassarit arando , | aequora periuro naufragas ore bibat , translated in the Loeb classics as Let the grasping trader's quest be wealth, and his perjured mouth drink in when he is wrecked the billow his ploughing keel has tired . Here one has a complex of error, at least in major part presumably originating with O1, transferred verbatim to O3. The chief point is the absence of the 'and' from line 33, which in Cunningham's version would read Let marchants seeke wealth and with periured lips, Being wrackt, carowse the sea tir'd by their ships. Without the 'and' in line 33 the merchants seek wealth with perjured lips; but the metre is off both here and in line 34. When the 'and' is transferred to line 33, the English agrees with the Latin and the metre is mended. In this error it is possible, of course, that O3 is independently following a faulty manuscript that also influenced the manuscript behind O1. But in conjunction with the various other common errors in O1 and O3 it is more probable that O3 is merely repeating an error originating in O1 or in its manuscript. That O1 was the copy used by the O3 compositor — not O2 — would seem to be established by the readings, for in all but four indifferent forms O3 follows O1 in the various examples of O2 disagreement with O1 (see footnote 8 above). Any hypothesis that the annotation of O2 copy (not of O1) was so thorough as to bring every O1-2 substantive variant into conformity with the manuscript and thus to blot out the O2 departures from O1 lacks probability — somewhere there should have been a real slip — and is quite definitely discouraged by a not unimportant range of evidence for the derivation of O3 from printed copy that applies only to O1 and not to O2, with especial reference to the significant O1,3 'paste' but O2 'past'; O1,3 'tierd' but O2 'tired'; O1,3 'wooddie' but O2 'woodie'; O1,3 'yong' (at I.ii.27, II.iv.41, III.vi.53) but O2 'young'; O1,3 'Cæphalus' (at I.xiii.33) but O2 'Cephalus' (although this is reversible because of O3 ' Cephalus ' in line 39); O1,3 'touldst' but O2 'toldst'; and the damaged ambiguous sort in O1 that produced the anomalous period at I.iii.25 in O3 although O2 has a full comma. On the other hand, it is a curious fact that Davies's Epigrams in O3 were set from a copy of O2, and not from O1. The case is demonstrable. Of at least 38 substantive variants between O1 and O2, the O3 text follows O2 in all but 13 readings. The qualitative evidence is better than the quantitative, or statistical. All of the thirteen O1,3 concurrences against O2 represent no more than O3 corrections of relatively obvious O2 errors that hit upon the O1 readings, such as O1,3 'requite' but the O2 misprint 'require' (no. 24.9), or 'woorthy' (O3: worthy') for O2 'worthlie' (no. 25.4), or the obvious omission of 'Dacus' in O2 (no. 30.14), or 'After' for the O2 misprint 'after' (no. 40.1), or 'his' for O2 misprint 'hig' (no. 45.4), and so on. Some required a certain amount of luck, as well as ingenuity, on the part of the O3 editor, like the return to O1 'reprooue' from O2 'approue' ( Ad Musam , 7), or to 'this' from O2 'his' (no. 27.3), or 'do owe' from O2 'drawe' (no. 46.3), or 'his' from O2 'hie' (no. 48.7). That the changes were not made by reference to the O1 text of the Epigrams may be suggested by the various times that O3 repaired difficulties caused by O2 departures from O1 by different readings that clearly resulted from guesswork. Examples are O1 'Geron whose mouldie', O2 'Geron mouldie', O3 ' Gerons mouldie' (no. 20.1); O1 'which did in Epigrams excell', O2 'which in Epigrams did excell', O3 'that did in Epigrams excell' (no. 29.1); 16 O1 'which', O2 'with', O3 'must' (no. 36.3); and O1 'so ill', O2 'ill', O3 'my ill' (no. 48.4). No evidence that can be trusted suggests consultation of O1 at any time by O3 in these Epigrams. The case is positive for O2 as the copy. Not only does O3 repeat such sense-destroying O2 variants as O1 'Gentleman' but O2-3 'lawyer' (no. 38.1), or acceptable enough O1 'Then is he' but O2-3 'When he is' (No. 49.9), or O1 'so smooth' but O2-3 'forsooth' (no. 36.39); but O3's derivation from O2 is pretty well demonstrated by other evidence, such as its following the O2 misprint 'loue' for O1 'Ioue' (no. 17.2) and 'qd' for O1 'quoth' (no. 14.6), as well as its omission, as in O2, of the two lines in no. 40. Nor will some intermediate edition either before or after O2 that could have served as O3 copy satisfy the difficulties inherent in the O3 derivation from the O1 tradition for the Elegies but from the O2 tradition for the Epigrams. The bibliographical construction of the book whereby O3 starts the Epigrams on sig. F4 r does not assist a hypothesis that the two sections were simultaneously set, which might have made convenient the use of two separate copies for the whole. Indeed, although the present writer admittedly has not made a computer analysis of the compositorial characteristics of O3, yet certain relatively obvious compositorial tricks like the hyphenation of suffixes are found in both sections, as in 'money-lesse' on F6 (no. 16.2) of the Epigrams and in the Elegies 'luck-lesse' (I.xi.7) on B4, 'loue-liest' (II.10.6) on C7 or, on the same page, 'lust-full' (II.10.25). In these noted cases the printed copy gives no warrant for the hyphens. Other practices of hyphenation are found in both sections, like 'a-round' (no. 26.10), which may be compared with Elegies 'some-times' (I.vi.21, I.viii.79), 'hus-band' (I.ix.25), 'her-self' (I.x.31), 'neck-lace' (I.x.52), or 'al-fowles' (II.vi.2). The odd 'heau-ns' (no. 46.2) on G4 may not be a misprint, therefore, but could align itself with 'run-ning' in the Elegies (I.vi.42) on sig. A6. Close reading, but not detailed analysis, does not seem to disclose evidence for more than one compositor throughout O3. 17 The cause of this difference in the copy for setting the two sections of O3 remains a puzzle to which the present writer has no answer except the printer may somehow have secured a made-up copy. The Elegies section begins with its own title-page on sig. E1 in O1 and O2, a possible indication that the two sections could have been sold separately as well as together. However, see footnotes 18, 26 below for a suggested explanation based on the hypothesis that annotated O2 was given to the printer of O3 for the Epigrams but only the manuscript for the Elegies and that it was he who secured a copy of O1 to assist in the setting of the Elegies. The matter of the O3 editor having been raised requires some further remarks, for when his operations produce variants in the ten reprinted elegies a question must always be asked about the status of their authority. If the Elegies had been printed alone in O3 we should have little evidence, although it would be difficult to prevent a certain uneasiness from creeping in as to the authority of some variants which when they are not outright sophistications like O3 ' Temple ' for O1 'tempe' ( Heliconia tempé ) in I.i.19 or explicable misreadings like 'slackt' for 'shakt' ( vidi ego iactatas mota face crescere flammas ) in I.ii.12, may occasionally be suspicious in their bland smoothing out of normal roughness, like 'Doest punish me' for 'Punish ye me' (I.xiii.41). This is not the place for a detailed reckoning of the authority of these variants, but it is appropriate to compare them both in frequency and in kind with the changes that O3 made in the O2 control text of the Epigrams where fresh authority could not have entered from any manuscript source. In the relatively brief text of the Epigrams O3 makes 32 substantive changes. These must have come in large part from an editor, probably the same person who prepared the copy for the Elegies. 18 Of these 32 variants in the Epigrams at least two are manifest errors, such as the omission of 'the' in no. 40.11, and the printing of 'shall' for 'hall' in no. 43.9, but these may perhaps be assigned to the printer. Nine are necessary corrections of O2 errors, such as the return of 'Dacus' which had dropped out of O2 (no. 30.14) or the correction of O2 'with' to 'which' (no. 30.11), or of O2 'require' to 'requite' (no. 24.9). In no. 48.4 an attempted correction of 'for my' for O2 'for' produced a fresh error. Interestingly, nine represent tinkering with the metre by smoothing the syntax. Typical are O3 'doth him so often' for O2 'so often doth him' (no. 7.7), 'seauen years in towne' for 'in towne 7 yeeres' (no. 9.2), 'one another' for 'eyther' (no. 24.13), or ' George Gascoines ' for 'Gascoines' (no. 22.10). In no. 28.3 an attempted improvement of the metre by the addition of 'and' between O2 'braue, most' came to grief when the 'and' was inserted but the 'most' was thereupon inadvertently omitted. The remaining improvements alter individual words. Sometimes the motive seems to be modernization, as in O3 'an hundred' for O2 'a hundreth' (no. 13.8), and possibly this reason is behind the change of O2 'forsooke' to 'refus'd' (no. 14.2), of 'eke' to 'then' (no. 14.3), of 'come on' for 'come a' (no. 21.2), and even of 'listening' for 'harkning' (no. 38.14) and of 'heed' for 'mark' (no. 38.14). Such a change as 'newest' for 'flying' (no. 40.2) seems to have been motivated by a desire to reduce a bold metaphor to a conventional one. 19 The motives for alterations like 'spies' for 'lookes' (no. 23.2) or 'as a Pharasie' for 'like a Pharisie' (no. 13.6), or 'debitor' for 'debtor poor' (no. 38.15) cannot be determined with any certainty. In short, the history in O3 of the text of the Epigrams may serve to cast serious doubt on the authority of many of the readings that editors have conventionally accepted in the Elegies from their usual O3 copy-text. That the annotator of O3 consulted some authority other than O1 for the texts of the ten reprinted elegies is clear enough from its restoration, or insertion, of two sets of lines wanting in O1. 20 But that its general run of variants from O1 has manuscript authority is a doubtful proposition, on the evidence of the changes made by the editor in the Epigrams. This problem is, of course, intimately related to the vital question about the manuscript behind the Certain Elegies in O1 and that behind the complete set in O3. One hypothesis would be that the Certain Elegies represent Marlowe's first attempts at translation in which he selected those that most interested him. It would follow that he thereupon, whether or not after an interval, engaged himself to the complete translation. If so, did he then give something of a revision to the earlier translated ten when he incorporated them in the full series? Does the O3 text then represent the revised and the O1 text the earlier version? Attractive as such a hypothesis may seem, what evidence there is runs contrary to it. A considerable number of the approximately 75 substantive variants between O3 and O1 represent the relatively easy correction by O3 of O1 misprints or misreadings as well as new misprints and misreadings perpetrated by O3 itself. 21 When these matters are set aside, we find that O3 makes four changes that can be imputed to metrical improvement in smoothness, 22 and thirteen alterations that are nothing more than modernizations, 23 all these to be classed as sophistications that do not necessarily have any authority. The real case for revision (or for purer readings) in O3 must rest with the twenty instances when in substantive variation O3 is closer to the Latin than O1, in contrast to the four cases in which O1 is more faithful in its translation. 24 These examples range from the O3 restoration of the Latin preterite for the O1 present in I.i.5,8 or of the present for the preterite (III. vi.47), through the restoration of correct Latin meaning from O1's faulty punctuation that had distorted it, as in the O3 comma after 'tho' (I.ii.3) and after 'so' (I.ii.7) for O1 omission, 25 to more accurate translation of number, as in O3 'triumph' for O1 'triumphs' (I.ii.28) or 'my' for O1 'our' (I.xv.2), perhaps an O1 slip; of transposed pronouns, perhaps another O1 slip (possibly in the manuscript) in O3 'yours euer mine' for O1 'mine euer yours' (III.xiii.22). Relatively few, but they are the most interesting, alter O1's words in the interests of exactness to the Latin. Certain of these are changes in quite minor words, as in O3 'All' for O1 'This' (I.xiii.25), 'into' for 'to the' (I.xv.10), 'And' for 'The' (I.xv.34), 'say' for 'speake' (II.xiii.35), 'that being' for 'and being' (III.vi.19), or 'And' for 'Or' (III. xiii.8). 26 Only a handful concern more concrete words, like O3 'palme' for O1 'garland' (III.xiii.47) or 'heldst' for O1 'hadst' (I.xiii.39). The case of O3 'drugges' for O1 'droughs' is moot (III.vi.28). That is, since O1's word seems to represent either an eccentric spelling, or even a compositorial misreading, of 'draughs' or 'draughts', the possibility exists that the O3 variant is a sophistication or rationalization, particularly since the Latin herba nocent is at least as close to 'draughts' as to 'drugges'. The cluster in III.xiii. 40-47 may be suggestive. First, in line 38 O3 mends the metre by reading 'thorough' for O1 'through'. The change of O1 'dying' to 'dead' in line 40, 'And would be dead, but dying, with thee remaine' may be as much a metrical smoothing as a return to the Latin tunc ego, sed tecum, mortuus esse velim . In line 47 comes the correct word (and also metrically regular) 'palme' ( palma ) for O1 paraphrase 'garland'; but in between, in line 45, O3 changes O1 'yeeld not' to 'deny' ( quae bene visa mihi fuerint, bene visa negato ). There is no question that here O3 is simply adopting a more direct word for a slightly old-fashioned and less literal but certainly appropriate enough translation 'yeeld not'. These illustrations do not necessarily suggest authorial revision of early work (particularly in the last example) but instead the attentions of an editor. 27 In most of them, given the choice, one would be more likely to assign the O1 readings to Marlowe than the O3 versions. With Jonson's ' Accius high-reard straine' (I.xv.19) in mind as a gloss, we might place among these O1's 'With muse vpreard I meane to sing of armes' (I.i.5) instead of O3's bland 'With Muse prepar'd' despite its more literal translation of Arma gravi numero violentaque bella parabam | edere . (O3's change of 'meane' to 'meant' and probably of 'take' in line 8 to 'tooke' seem to be necessary, however, to mend the sense in O1.) And O1 'louers' is certainly better for Lais amata viris than O3 'wooers' (I.v.12). Nothing much can be made of O1 'deep vast sea' but O3 'vast deepe' (II.x. 14), 28 or of the neutral O3 'strugling' ( an subitum luctando accendimus ignem ) for O1 'striuing'. 29 The real puzzle is that although fairly numerous these O3 variants are in fact, given the amount of text, not much more frequent than the demonstrably unauthoritative changes made in the Davies Epigrams nor do they differ markedly in their kind. In no sense is there such a reworking as might be expected of a revising author and, especially in their occasional correction of loose or mistaken translation, they often seem to bear the mark of an editor, who also was concerned with exact metrical regularity and with some modernizing of what had become old-fashioned loose grammar and syntax as well as language. Indeed, if it were not for the addition of the couplet missing in I.xv and of the four lines in II.iv 30 there is little solid evidence that the O1 printed text was actually compared with the manuscript that furnished the full set of the elegies, since editorial tinkering would account satisfactorily for most of the changes made in O3. 31 Perhaps there is, in fact, not much connection between these additions and the question of collation. The kind of editor who was reading over the O1 text and altering it to suit his purposes would naturally notice the two hiatuses and supply them by reference to the manuscript; he need not, thus, have had his attention called to them in comparing the manuscript with O1. Indeed, if he was comparing O1 with anything, it would have been with the Latin text, on the evidence of the alterations made in the direction of greater exactness to the Latin. 32 Yet there are difficulties with this editorial theory if it is narrowly applied to the annotation of O1 to produce printer's copy. That an editor was present behind some features of the O3 text may be readily assumed from the attentions given to Davies's Epigrams. But if this editor applied himself to O1 instead of to the manuscript itself, the result is a curious combination of minute correction and coarse oversight. The evidence suggests the possibility, instead, that whereas a marked copy of the Epigrams was given to the printer, the manuscript alone was furnished him for the Elegies; and the compositor set those texts present in the Certaine Elegies either from the manuscript with consultation of the print or largely from O1 with consultation of the manuscript. In some obscure way this situation may have something to do with the fact that O2 was utilized as copy for the Epigrams but it was O1 that influenced the setting of the elegies in O3. If one wanted to engage in idle speculation one could even guess that the anomaly occurred because it was the printer himself who privately secured the copy of O1 to speed his labors. This matter of the mixed readings has an intimate relation to speculations about the nature of the manuscript behind O1 and that behind O3, and their relationship. Not only does the nature of the variants in O3 (even though not all perhaps can be attributed to the O3 editor) discourage a belief that the Certain Elegies represent early trials; the composite nature of O1's book of Epigrammes and Elegies makes a hypothesis quite plausible that it derived from someone's collection or commonplace book of satiric and amatory poetry, a possibility encouraged by the signing 'C. Marlow(e)' of the first three poems 33 and by the appearance between the epigrams and elegies of the three Ignoto amorous poems not to be attributed either to Davies or to Marlowe. If this is so, the manuscript behind O1 is a copy that stems from the manuscript behind O3 or from an ancestor. The printer's copy for O3 could be Marlowe's own papers worked over by a publisher's editor, or a transcript made of these, at what distance is impossible to guess. Who introduced Jonson's version of I.xv, and whether this has a bearing on the nature or derivation of the manuscript, are questions not to be answered. In short, no assumptions can be made on any evidential basis about the relative authority of each manuscript, including its distance from Marlowe's papers. 34 It is a fair conjecture, however, on the evidence of the treatment of the text of Davies's Epigrams that the larger number of variants found in the O3 text from Certain Elegies were inserted by a publisher's editor and were not present in the manuscript behind O3. This hypothesis helps to place the O3 manuscript as perhaps relatively close to the original if it is not itself the original, which we cannot know. Of one thing we may be sure, however. Given the degree of sophistication of the Epigrams and of the Certain Elegies in O3, we may expect the same treatment to have been given to the text of the elegies published there for the first time. Hence whatever authority might be credited hypothetically to the O3 manuscript because of a possible closeness to the original is vitiated for its substantives, in some part, by the editorial tinkering to which it has been subjected. The family tree of the remaining editions presents no difficulty. The Bodleian Library preserves another octavo edition (O4) collating A-F 8 G 4 like O3. This is Douce O.31 (STC 18931). Its title omits 'ALL' and reads '[row of type-orn., same as in O1-2] | Ouids Elegies: | Three Bookes . | By C. M. | Epigrames by I. D. | [narrow orn. of fish on each side of a man's head] | At Middlebourgh.' As in O3, the Epigrams begin on sig. F4 r with a headtitle. Since O3-4 are paginal reprints, the question of priority arises but is readily solved, for where Douce (O4) departs in the Epigrams or the Certain Elegies from Mason (O3), it is O3 that agrees with O1 (O2 for the Epigrams) and O4 that disagrees. Examples may be cited from II.iv: line 24, O1-3 She would] O4 She will; line 41, O1-3 blacke haire] O4 browne haire; line 46, O1-3 looks, that] O4 lookes and that. In III.vi.66, O1-3 more then] O4 more like. O5 and O6 are also paginal reprints, each collating 8 , A-F 8 . The O5 edition, which should be STC 18932, may be represented by British Museum C.57.i.42. 35 Its title-page reads 'ALL | Ovids Elegies: | 3. Bookes. | By C. M. | Epigrams by I. D. | [row of three vertical leaf type-orns. above two fists, the right inverted] | AT MIDDLEBOVRGH.' The elegies end on E8 v with 'FINIS.' and a rule, and beneath the Epigrams start with a headtitle, ending on F8 v with ' FINIS. I. D. ' In the readings cited above of variants between O3 and O4, this O5 edition agrees with O3, as in other variants between Douce and Mason. In turn, when O5 disagrees with O3, in these readings O3 agrees with O1. Examples are I.i.28 O1-3 Saying] O5 Saving; I.ii.14 O1-3 which] O5 that; I.iii.21 O1-3 horned] O5 honored. Other readings following the same pattern demonstrate that O5 derives from O3, since when O3 varies from O1 then O5 follows O3, as in I.i.5 O1 vpreard] O3,5 prepar'd; I.i.19 O1 tempe] O3,5 Temple . The last observed edition is O6 (STC 18933), represented by the British Museum copy, shelf mark 1068.6.20(2). 36 The octavo also collates A-F 8 and is a paginal reprint of O5. When O5 departs from O3, O6 follows O5 as in I.i.28, I.ii.14, and I.iii.21. On the other hand, it has various unique readings that show it to be a terminal edition from which O5 could not derive, as I.iii.i O3,5 he] O6 him; I.iii.13 O3,5 gives] O6 give; I.v.7 O3,5 shamefast] O6 shamefac'd. O6 also uses medial 'v' for 'u' and in other respects betrays a later origin. It employs a curious typographical device by which alternate elegies are set in italic. The title-page of O6 reads 'ALL | OVIDS ELEGIES: | 3. Bookes. | By C. M. | Epigrams by I. D. | [block of four lace type-orn.] | AT MIDDLEBOVRGH.' The Short-Title Catalogue's queried dates of 1595 for O1, 1598 for O2, 1635 for O5, and 1640 for O6 are, of course, purely conjectural and the evidence is not known on which these estimates were based. The O3 printing of Jonson's Elegy I.xv takes its text from the 1602 Quarto of Poetaster on the evidence of the accidentals, including the Q-O3 spelling ' Æney ' in line 25 for the 1616 Folio 'Ænee', as well as other spellings, supported by the Q-O3 'The frost-drad mirtle' in line 37 for the Folio 'Frost-fearing myrtle'. The first complete edition of the Elegies, therefore, was certainly printed after 1602. Whether its use of the Quarto instead of the 1616 Folio for its text of I.xv means that it appeared before the Folio is not subject to demonstration and would be a dangerous conjecture. Jonson himself seems to have consulted either O1 or O2 for his translation; if, instead, he used a manuscript, certain of the O1 readings would be authenticated as against the O3 variants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Despite the present writer's private search and the more thorough efforts of the revisers of the Short-Title Catalogue (STC), no edition not previously recorded has been turned up, although more copies of all known editions except O1 and O4 have been found than had been noticed before. In this note the STC numbers are of the current first edition and do not reflect the revised numbering that will presumably be used in the new STC now in preparation. Since two editions are known only in single copies, it would not be surprising if some editions have been lost. However, one must work with what one has, and the following account assumes a contiguous relationship between all editions, an assumption that, in fact, is supported by the evidence of the texts. 2 This imprint, often a false one, was a precaution for some books that could not be licensed and were surreptitiously printed although, apparently, sometimes openly sold. The precaution was a wise one, for on 1 June 1599 the Stationers' Register records that the episcopal authorities called in and commanded to be burned, among others, 'Davyes Epigrams, with Marlowes Elegys'. The order listed has usually led to the conjecture that the book so suppressed would have been either the first or the second edition in which Davies' Epigrams precede the Elegies. It is further conjectured that the objection was more to the Davies than to the Marlowe section but the evidence is uncertain. 3 These were I.i,ii,iii,v,xiii,xv; II.iv,x; III. vi, xiii, the latter two being vii and xiv in modern editions of Ovid. III.v, not always present in early editions, was not translated. The order in O1-2 is I.i., I.iii, I.v, III.xiii, I.xv (misnumbered II.xv), I.xiii, II. iv, II.x, III.vi, I.ii. 4 I.xv is also printed in a translation by B. I., i.e. Ben Jonson, who wrote it for his Poetaster , acted in 1601 and printed in 1602. 5 The date 1595 is approved by J. M. Nosworthy, "The Publication of Marlowe's Elegies and Davies' Epigrams ," R.E.S. , 15 (1964), 397-398, but the evidence is suspect. An earlier date may be possible, as has been suggested by others on the basis of reference and quotation. However, the quotation in Nashe's Unfortunate Traveller (registered September, 1593) is of no evidential value since it comes from an elegy first printed in O3. 6 This Pforzheimer copy has been collated against photographs of the BM copy and found to be invariant. 7 For example, in Hamlet I.ii.198 (TLN 389) 'the dead vast and middle of the night' found in many modern texts, which comes from the Bad Quarto, could be entertained only with difficulty if the editor did not believe that in some manner Q2 'wast' corrupted the pure reading 'vast' in its copy and passed this misreading 'wast' on to the Folio. If F were set from an independent manuscript, instead of from annotated Q2, one could argue, its support of 'wast' would be weighty indeed unless it were conjectured to be an archetypal error. 8 The only O2 variants from O1 that O3 prints are I.ii.21 O1 needes] O2-3 needst (O3 need'st); I.ii.36 O1 hath] O2-3 have; I.xiii.47 O1 chid] O2-3 chide; III.xiii.31 O1 makes] O2-3 make. Actually, the copy for O3 as a whole is a complicated one and the statement that O1 was the printer's copy applies only to the Elegies. For a discussion, see below. 9 On the other hand, the Latin would permit either plural or singular, nec meus innumeris renovatur campus aratis , which the Loeb Classical Library edition translates as 'and my fields are not renewed with ploughshares numberless'. 10 O3 prints lines 22-26 as: And she that on a fain'd Bull swamme to land, Griping his false hornes with her virgin hand. So likewise we will through the world be rung. And with my name shall thine be alwayes sung. 11 On the other hand, the error is less explicable from the O2 setting: Huge Okes, hard Adamãts might she haue moued &amp; with sweet words, cause deaf rockes to haue lo- Worthy she was to moue both gods &amp; men (ued 12 Contributing no doubt to the error is the fact that in O1-2 names are printed in roman although consistently placed in italic by O3, but not 'Love' for Cupid or Venus. The O3 compositor seeing 'Loue knowes with such like praiers I dayly moue him' in his copy, especially with 'Loue' not wholly clear because of a damaged 'L', could well expect that the poet was swearing by Jove, not Cytherea (as in the Latin). I am indebted to Mr. Kendon Stubbs for privately communicating to me the case of the damaged 'n' in O1 I.v.5 which barely prints in CSmH 'sunne' and might just possibly explain the misprint 'Suune' in O3, unless this is simply a fortuitous turned 'n'. 13 The Latin here is Quaea mihi ventura est, siquidem ventura, senectus , | cum desit numeris ipsa iuventa suis? 14 It might be useful in tracking him down to know that he did not have in his cases a ligatured long-s with k and set this combination always with two sorts. The printer of O6 had few roman 'k' sorts and frequently had to resort to italic. 15 Since O3 customarily mends metrical deficiencies, real or fancied, both in the Epigrams and in the Elegies, it is unusual to find it reprinting this faulty line without change. But fortunately for the case in hand it was preserved, perhaps because no alternative suggested itself to the editor. If so, in this instance he did not consult the Latin. 16 This is an example of O3's tendency to alter any rough metre. 17 Type-shortages show that some sheets, like B, were set by formes from cast-off copy. The possible oddity I have noticed is that the general trend in sheets A and B to the spellings 'mistresse' or 'mistrisse' begins toward the latter part of sheet C to give place to 'mistris', which had not appeared before with any frequency. The punctuation, also, grows somewhat heavier. Other characteristics do not seem to change, however, at least so far as I have observed. For example, the invariable spelling 'doest' (only one exception) is preserved throughout, and the italicized treatment of names is constant. The unusual hyphenation persists: see 'out-stander' (III. v.27) on sig. E2 v , or 'nimph- Neœra ' in the next line, 'hood-winckt' (III.v.79) on sig. E3 v , 'fal-shood' (III.viii.30) on sig. E7, 'in-tombe' (III.xiii.23) on sig. F3. 18 To identify the editor of the Epigrams with the editor of the Elegies is not necessarily to require him to have annotated the ten Certain Elegies in O1 printed copy for the O3 compositor. If, instead, it was the printer himself who chose to perform the annotation in order to speed up composition — or merely consulted O1 while typesetting — one would need to take it that the O3 variants in the Elegies were present in the manuscript, whether originally or by alteration of the editor who changed the Epigram readings. The identity of this person is, of course, a mystery. Whether it was a literary-minded publisher, whether the publisher hired some scholar or literary man to oversee and bring up to date an old-fashioned work now being given an important new complete edition, or whether they were already present in the manuscript, can be a subject only for speculation. 19 Just possibly the word 'flying' was not entirely legible in the print. In the BM copy the inking is poor for some letters of this word. 20 In I.xv the lines are 'The world shall of Callimachus euer speake, | His Arte excell'd, although his witte was weake.' In II.iv they are 'I thinke what one vndeckt would be, being drest | Is she attir'd, then shew her graces best. | A white wench thralles me, so doth golden yellowe | And nut-browne girles in doing haue no fellowe'. No reason exists to doubt that these lines are Marlowe's own. 21 O3 corrects seven O1 misreadings and misprints, such as O3 'What' for O1 'That' (I.i.11), 'sunne' for O1 'sonne' (I.i.15), or 'number' for 'numbers' (I.i.22). It makes nine misprints or misreadings of its own, such as 'slackt' for O1 'shakt' (L.ii.12), 'tride' for O1 'tyrde' (I.v.25), 'chide' for O1 'chid' (I.xiii.47), or 'sire' for O1 'sir' (III.vi.11). These are not always easy to separate from such O1 errors corrected by O3 as 'workes' for O1 'worke' (I.i.21), 'Loue' for O1 'I' (I.i.22), 'Am' for O1 'And' (II.iv.8), or 'glance' for O1 'glasse', which total seven, or the four O3 errors where O1 was correct such as O3 ' Temple ' for O1 'tempe' (I.i.19), ' Ioue ' for O1 'Loue' (I.iii. 4), 'rustie' for O1 'dustie' (I.xv.4) or the omission of 'now' (III.vi.70). 22 These are the O3 omission of O1 'both do' (I.xiii.21), O3 'And this' for O1 'This' (II.x.8), O3 'not' for O1 'her not' (III.vi.3), and O3 omission of O1 'and' (III.vi.47). 23 These modernizations remove several examples of the attributive case such as O3 'needles points' for O1 'needle poynts' (III.vi.30), or — better — 'nights pranckes' for O1 'night prankes' (III.xiii.7); create concord between verb and noun, as 'life . . . giues' for O1 'life . . . giue' (I.iii.13) or 'reasons make' for O1 'reasons makes' (II.iv.10); or mend grammar such as the objective case 'her I like' for O1 'she I like' (II.vi.29). 24 These four cases lose any possible significance on examination. One group is quite definitely O3 sophistication (the plural 'souldiours' and the change in pronoun to 'their' in O3 for O1 and Latin singular and 'his' in II.x.31-32, which make for rough syntax and lack of parallelism). In I.xv.4 O3 'rustie' for O1 and Latin 'dustie' is almost certainly a sophistication as well, if not a memorial error. In the third case the motive for the O3 variant 'wooers' of Lais for O1 'louers' (I.v.12), the Latin being et multis Lais amata viris , is not clear but the change may be sophistication. The fourth is O3 'ore' for O1 'on the sea' (I.xiii.1), fairly clearly a sophistication ( super oceanum venit ). 25 Perhaps in this category, although the point is a fine one owing to the ambiguity of the O1 modification, is the O3 straightening-out with 'And she thats coy I like for being no clowne, | Me thinkes she would be nimble when shees downe' of O1 'And she thats coy I like, for being no clowne, | Me thinkes she should be nimble when shees downe' (II.iv.13-14), the Latin being sive procax aliqua est, capior, quia rustica non est, spemque dat in molli esse toro . The O3 version is closer to spemque , and clarifies the O1 comma after 'like' (perhaps no more than a conventional caesural punctuation pause) which obscures the modification by making it possible for the 'for' to be taken as a conjunction that would associate her nimbleness directly with her lack of rusticity, a notion not encouraged by the Latin. 26 Another very literal correction but perhaps dictated as much by smoothing the language as by accuracy is O3 'Her armes farre whiter then the Sythian snow' for O1 'That were as white as is the Scithean snow' (III.vi.8). The Latin is bracchia Sithonia candidiora nive . In III.vi.18 O3 'When in my prime my force is spent and gone' is closer to cum desit numeris ipsa iuventa suis than O1 'Seeing in my prime'; but it is more likely that the editor made this change to reduce the line from eleven to ten syllables than to alter the translation of cum , for he keeps the same Marlovian use of 'seeing' in line 70 when the line totals ten syllables exactly. A real correction from the Latin (but perhaps from the Jonson version) comes in O3's 'Whilst Rome of all the conquered world is head' for O1 'conquering world', perhaps a mistranslation of Roma triumphati dum caput vrbis erit , or perhaps a scribal error. If the O3 compositor were merely consulting O1, many of the relatively indifferent words may have come from the O3 manuscript and need not reflect the activity of an annotating editor. This is an attractive hypothesis. 27 For instance, see O3 'why made King to refuse it?' in III.vi.49, which tightens O1 'why made king? and refusde it' in the direction of quo regna sine usu . 28 The Latin is in freta collectas alta quid addis aquas . This O3 variant, then, does not even have the excuse of a more literal rendition of the Latin such as seems to be behind the syntactical rearrangement in O3, I.xv.31, 'To verse let Kings giue place, and Kingly showes' ( cedant carminibus reges regumque triumphi ) of O1 'Let Kings giue place to verse and kingly showes', which is itself closer to Jonson's line 'Kings shall giue place to it, and Kingly showes'. But it seems clear that Jonson knew Marlowe's translation when he came to pen his own version. 29 O1 'yeelding or striuing [O3: strugling] doe we giue him might' for Cedimus, an subitum luctando accendimus ignem . Perhaps again O3 is merely modernizing the language. 30 These missing lines in O1 present an insoluble problem. The four lines in II.iv, particularly, are of a nature that would lead Marlowe to want to translate them. Whether in the manuscript given to the printer or somehow in the printing, however, they were skipped, for they must be thought to have been present in Marlowe's papers. At first sight a change on O3 from the O1 version in II.iv immediately following the four-line gap might seem to have something to do with a revision consequent upon their restoration. That is, after the couplet on Leda, O1 continues, 'Yellow trest is shee', but in O3 the reading is 'Amber trest'. One could speculate idly that 'Amber' was substituted in O3 by an author who was varying it in order to avoid the repetition of 'yellow' in the third of the missing lines — 'A white wench thralles me, so doth golden yellowe'. But the change probably has nothing to do with the omission since it aligns itself with other examples of editorial exactness. The phrase 'so doth golden yellowe' translates capiet me flava puella . But whereas O1 'Yellow trest is shee, then on the morne thinke I' also translates at the start seu flavent in identical terms as 'yellow', the continuation of the translation omits a distinction that follows, seu flavent, placuit croceis Auroris capillis . It is the croceis or saffron-yellow color that is being transferred in O3 from Aurora to the yellow-tressed girl. In passing one may notice the oddity that the first of the four lines restored in O3 has just the same sort of mistaken punctuation distorting the sense that O3 had sometimes followed from O1 and sometimes corrected: I thinke what one vndeckt would be, being drest Is she attir'd, then shew her graces best. Here the comma after 'be' is acceptable only if another comma or stronger stop is added after 'drest' to prevent a run-on line, and a question mark though not required would not be amiss after 'attird'. The Latin reads non est culta—subit, quid cultae accedere possit; | ornata est—dotes exhibet ipsa suas . 31 One example of possible consultation of the manuscript must be remarked although it may be thought a doubtful one. This is I.xv.39 which reads in O1: Then though death rackes my bones in funeral fier, Ile liue, and as he puls me downe, mount higher. O3, however, reads 'rakes my bones', which is argued for by the Methuen editor as meaning 'covers (sc. under the materials of the fire which have been raked together.' It is true that O.E.D. quotes some examples of this meaning under vb.II.4 'To cover with, or bury under, something brought together with, or as with a rake' and in 5. spec. gives quotations to illustrate 'To cover (a fire) with ashes or small coal in order to keep it in without active burning', the best of which is from Brathwaite's Strappado (1615), 'Yet shall not . . . those accomplisht parts . . . Lie rak't in Ashes.' The Methuen editor remarks another quotation with 'up' from 5.b, Stapylton's Strada's Low-Country Warres (1650), 'His Indignation, then rak'd up in Embers, would in time breake out.' The Latin reads, ergo etiam cum me supremus adederit ignis , in which the verb adedo means 'to eat away, gnaw at', and, specifically of fire, 'consume'. The contrast is then between what happens to his bones in the funeral fire, and 'Ile liue' ( vivam ). (Jonson's version reads 'when this body falls in funeral fire'.) It is possible that Marlowe is thinking of Death with a rake covering up his bones in the funeral fire so that they will be utterly consumed. This is very likely the intention, although the subsequent editions did not understand it. On the other hand, one can worry a bit about the connection between the fire gnawing away at his bones ( adederit ignis ) and Death torturing them by the fire as if tearing them apart on the rack ('to pull or tear [them] apart, to separate by force, to break up' O.E.D. vb.2b obs .). But this is perhaps fanciful, and the O3 variant 'rakes' may have come from manuscript. However, it is worth notice that 'rackes' as in O1 is a rare spelling of 'rakes'; so, in the end, it is quite possible all the O3 editor, or compositor, was doing was modernizing the spelling. The O3 form could not have come from the Latin, which does not suggest the word at all. 32 This care for the Latin readings did not prevent some slips, however, such as his passing 'thee conquered' in the last line of I.ii instead of altering 'thee' to 'the', or his leaving untouched 'fathers hoord' (I.xv. 17) and other common errors that have been listed. There are a scattering of examples of Marlowe's mistranslations being left unmended, such as II.x.19 'soft loue' for saevus (cruel), which Marlowe sems to have misread as suavis . Or I.iii.18, where O3's modernization of O1 'or' to 'ere' in 'Ile liue with thee, and die, or thou shalt grieue' does not mend the sense to conform to vivere contingat teque dolente mori (and to be sorrowed over by you when I die). Various of these examples are complicated, however, either by the difficulty of altering Marlowe except in single words or by the uncertainty as to the readings in the edition used by the editor. 33 Actually, the signing only of the first three elegies seems to reflect the copy, and the cessation to represent a compositorial decision. The main point is that they start off being signed. The first three are contained in sheet E, and the system without signing begins with sheet F. It is possible that some break took place between these two sheets on the evidence of the treatment of the heading capitals which in sheet E take up two lines of indented text but beginning with sheet F three lines, although the size remains the same. Yet no clear sign of a change of compositors can be seen and the spelling system remains the same, except for the anomalous use of 'hir' in I.iii on sig. E3 but 'her' elsewhere in E and invariably in sheets F-G. Moreover, type shortages in sheet E that dictated the substitution of 'VV' or 'w' for 'W', of italic ' F ' for 'F', and of italic ' T ' for 'T', continue in sheet F, just as they had appeared in sheets A, B, and C. The reason for the typographical change is obscure although it may have had an effect on the omission of the signatures. But at least the single compositor seems to remain constant. 34 A hypothesis that O1 was set from a portion of the manuscript behind O3 and then returned cannot be seriously entertained. 35 Other copies may be found in the Dyce collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, in the Bodleian, Huntington, Folger (3 copies), Pierpont Morgan, Carl H. Pforzheimer, Harvard, Yale, and University of Illinois Libraries. 36 Other copies may be found in the Bodleian, Huntington, Folger, and Newberry Libraries, and in the libraries of the University of Hull and Harvard and Yale.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Printer of Hamlet Q3 by J. A. Lavin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nicholas Ling, for whom the good second quarto of Hamlet had been printed by James Roberts in 1604-5, transferred his rights in the play to John Smethwick on 19 November 1607. The third quarto ( STC 22277) appeared in 1611 with Smethwick's device (McKerrow 376) on the titlepage, but without a printer's name in the imprint. W. W. Greg thought that the printer was "probably Valentine Simmes" ( Bibliography , I, 311), because of the one ornament it displays, a headpiece on sig B1 r (see fig. 1). W. Craig Ferguson has quite rightly pointed out that this ornament "cannot be taken as evidence that Simmes printed the book," for he had used the ornament in question once only, in 1604, seven years before the printing of Hamlet Q3 in 1611, by which time "Simmes's old ornament stock had been taken over by other printers or had disappeared." 1 The question of who owned this block in 1611 and employed it in the printing of Hamlet Q3 in that year is complicated by the fact that the last title bearing the name of Simmes as printer is dated 1612, The most famous . . . historie of . . . Mervine ( STC 17844), which he printed jointly with Ralph Blower. However, Ferguson has shown that Simmes virtually ceased printing after 1607, for he published nothing more until 1610, when a solitary reprint was done for him by Thomas Purfoot. Of the three Simmes titles dated 1611, one was printed for him, and the other two, although claiming to be printed by Simmes, contain none of his old ornament stock. 2 Apart from the unlikelihood that Simmes still owned the Hamlet headpiece in 1611, there are other reasons, as Ferguson indicates, for not attributing Q3 to Simmes: the fount of small capitals on the titlepage is not found in any other of Simmes's books; the signatures on sheets D-G and L have periods between the letters and the numerals, a practice never adopted by Simmes; stage-directions and exits are not uniformly treated; italic is introduced into the roman of the text, and roman into italic stage-directions (practices avoided by Simmes); and speech-prefixes are almost always abbreviated, in contrast to Simmes's habit of using unabbreviated tags. 3 Some other printer must therefore be sought for Hamlet Q3. It is apparent that a portion of Simmes's materials passed to Henry Ballard, as might be suggested by an entry in the list of printers appended to Arber (III.703): "1608 Henry Ballard from Simmes." In fact, as Ferguson notes, "Ballard seems to have acquired some of Simmes's stock as early as 1607, when no less than four Simmes ornaments and a device (379) appear in one book ( STC 25057)." 4 He used a Simmes device (McKerrow 142) in printing STC 17888 in 1608, and in Ferguson's list of Simmes's ornaments and initials the following are noted as having "passed to Ballard": ornaments nos. 1, 5, 10, 11, 12a, 19; flowers 1 and 2; factotum 2; initials C2, G1, G2, H3, I9, N2, O2, O4, R1, R2, R3, S4, T2, T5, Y2. To this list the following uses of Simmes's material by Ballard may be added: ornament 20 in 1608 17888, and 23 in 1607 25057; initial A1 in 1608 24577, C3 in 1608 24577, C4 in 1609 6499, I5 in 1608 1233, T9 in 1607 25057, and Y3 in 1608 7493. According to Ferguson two Simmes ornaments, nos. 14 and 19, passed to Ralph Blower. It should be added that a little later Felix Kingston is found using part of Simmes's stock: device 332; ornaments 2, 12a*, 23*; factotum 2; initials C4*, F1, F5, G1*, H1, H3*, I3, I6, I8, L2, M1, O1, O2*, O4*, R2*, R3*, T2*, T3, T5*, T8, T9*. The blocks marked with an asterisk were probably acquired from Ballard rather than directly from Simmes since they do not appear in Kingston's work until 1610 or later. It should also be noted that because of the conventional design of some of these blocks, which seem to have been cast, positive identification is not always possible. In other instances damage to the ornament makes identification easy. The above information should suffice to show that although five books printed by or for Simmes were published in the three-year period 1610-12, he had disposed of at least part of his stock in 1607. Nevertheless, the Hamlet Q3 headpiece is not found used by Blower, Ballard, or Kingston. However, though not noted by Ferguson, other Simmes materials were acquired by George Eld. Once again it is impossible to be certain that initials used by Eld which resemble Simmes's A1, L3, O4, T5, and T7, are not duplicate blocks. We have seen that O4 and T5 seem to have passed to Ballard and then to Kingston, but there may have been several such ornaments. The initials B5 and N5 pose a different problem, for although their chipped rules and less conventional design show the blocks used by Eld and those allegedly belonging to Simmes to be identical, they appear in only one Simmes title, in 1603. Since the initial N5 was in continuous use by Simson, Read and Eld consecutively from 1590 to 1622 it is clear that it did not belong to Simmes in 1603; the same is almost certainly true of B5 also. Shared printing is the likely explanation of their occurrence in a Simmes book. 5 On the other hand, Eld did use Simmes ornaments as follows: no. 3 1613 11309 14516 14697; no. 4 1613 14516; no. 6 1610 20290 to 1615 25240; no. 7 1613 11309 to 1620 3989; no. 8 1622 19321; no. 22 1616 1196. Eld also had ornaments which appear identical to Simmes's nos. 1, 10, 11, and 14, the first three of which Ferguson says went to Ballard, and the last to Blower; they may therefore either be cast duplicates, or 1, 10, and 11 were acquired by Eld after they passed through Ballard's hands. The latter supposition is supported by the fact that no. 1 does not occur in Eld's work until 1609 15485; no. 10 until 1609 22353; and no. 11 until 1610 24603. It appears that the Simmes materials used by Ballard from 1607 to 1609 were then divided between Kingston and Eld. Among the other Simmes ornaments which passed to Eld was the Hamlet Q3 headpiece (no. 26 in Ferguson's study). Eld employed it in 1610 in Rowland Vaughan's Most approved and long experienced water-workes ( STC 24603), sig. D1 r (see fig. 2), and in 1611 on the title-page of Doctor Faustus Q3 ( STC 17431). It was still in his possession in 1621, when he used it in Joseph Martyn's New epigrams and a satyre ( STC 17525), sig. D2 r . The various breaks in the ornament as it appears in Hamlet Q3 and these other three works show it to be the same block. Thus Hamlet Q3 was a product of George Eld's press. Apart from Shakespeare's play, Eld seems to have printed only one other work for Smethwick, Sir David Murray's The tragicall death of Sophonisba , which, perhaps significantly, is also dated 1611. However, he printed many plays for other publishers between 1605 and 1618, including Troilus and Cressida (1609) for Bonian and Walley, for whom he also printed Your Five Gallants . He was employed extensively by John Wright, for whom he printed Return from Parnassus, Caesar and Pompey, Travels of Three English Brothers, The Devils Charter, Doctor Faustus Q2 and Q3, The Shoemakers' Holiday Q2, and, according to Greg, three editions of Mucedorus . Another publisher of plays who used his services on several occasions was Thomas Thorpe, for whom he printed not only the first edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets, but also All Fools, Sejanus, What You Will , and The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Byron . There was therefore nothing odd in Smethwick's choosing him to reprint Hamlet .</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Printer of the Third Volume of Jonson's Workes (1640) by D. F. McKenzie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The 1640 folio edition of Jonson's Workes is composed of at least three bibliographically distinct books: the first volume, a reprint by Richard Bishop of the 1616 folio ( S.T.C. 14753); the sheets of the abortive 1631 folio of Jonson's new work, described as 'The second Volume' but containing only the three plays Bartholomew Fair, The Devil is an Ass and The Staple of News , all printed by John Beale; and then what Greg has described as 'the third volume', made up of the later masques, last plays, The Underwood , the two entertainments, the translation from Horace's Art of Poetry, The English Grammar and Timber, or Discoveries ( S.T.C. 14754).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In his admirable account of this collection, Greg wrote: 'The third volume bears no name of either printer or publisher. The only ornament is a factotum at the beginning of the masques, and of this there were several copies: the ownership of the present block has not so far been established.' 1 In fact, in 1639-40, this block belonged to John Dawson Junior and it was he who printed 'the third volume'.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The story of the printing and publishing of the book is complex but it is told succinctly by Greg and there is no point in repeating it here. It is sufficient to say that the material for it was secured by the bookseller Thomas Walkley and that it was he who placed it with John Dawson for printing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This 'third volume' has three sets of signatures which may be recorded briefly as: 2 : B-Q 4 R 2 S-X 4 Y 2 Z-2O 4 2P 2 2Q 4 ; 2 A-P 4 Q 2 R-V 4 ; 3 A-K 4 L 2 M-R 4 . That the printer was John Dawson Junior may be proved on the evidence of one factotum depicting Salome receiving the head of John the Baptist, and two upper case, French Canon 'H's. Their combined testimony removes all doubt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First, the factotum. It appears at B1, the first page of Christmas, his Masque , in the Jonson folio. The identical block, with the same characteristic marks of damage, also appears at the following points in books printed by John Dawson in 1639 and 1640: at E6 and F6 of R. Ward, Animadversions of Warre , 1639 ( S.T.C. 25025); at 2E2 of vol. III of G. Saulnier, The Love and Armes of the Greeke Princes , 1640 ( S.T.C. 21775; this work was printed for Walkley, vols. I and II by Thomas Harper); and at A2 of Threnoikos . The House of Mourning , 1640 ( S.T.C. 24048). The block was used by John Haviland in his 1634 edition of Andrew Willett's Synopsis Papismae ( S.T.C. 25700 a ) and must have passed into Dawson's hands shortly after Haviland died in 1638. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Also at B1 of the Jonson 'third volume' (in the word 'CHRISTMAS') appears the first of the two 'H's which may be evidenced as Dawson's (it lacks its lower right serif). This recurs at 3 A1 (in the word 'HIS') and at 3 I3 v (in the word 'THE') of the same book, and also at O2, 2Y2, 2Z4 and 3I4 of Threnoikos . The second 'H' (it has a small crack leading from the inner edge of the upper left arm) appears at 2 R1 of Jonson (in the word 'SHEPHERD') and at A1 and 4F1 of Threnoikos . It may also be found in another book printed for Walkley in 1640, although the printer is not given, namely The Third Speech of Lord George Digby ( S.T.C. 6844), where it appears on A2.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are many other display letters which link the several parts of Walkley's section of the Jonson folio with one another and with books printed by Dawson. An 'R' at R1 of Jonson recurs at A1 of T. Nashe, Miscelanea , 1639 ( S.T.C. 18384), at π1 of J. Stoughton, Seven Sermons , 1640 ( S.T.C. 2311), and on the section title preceding B1 as well as at H3 of Threnoikos . A 'D' at 3 I3v of Jonson recurs at A1 of W. Wood, New Englands Prospect , 1639 ( S.T.C. 25959), at A1 of Miscelanea , on the section title preceding B1, and at L6 and 3H2 of Threnoikos . An 'E' at F4 and Q3v of Jonson recurs at 2M3 of Cervantes, Exemplarie Novells, 1640 ( S.T.C. 4914), and at F3 and 2Z5 of Threnoikos . A 'T' at 2I4 of Jonson (in the word 'THAT') recurs at N2 of Threnoikos and A2 of The Third Speech . A 'C' at D3v of Jonson recurs at 2B3 of Threnoikos and H4 of Exemplarie Novells . A 'Q' at G4, M1 and S1 of Jonson recurs at 3I4 of Threnoikos . And a 'P' at V2v of Jonson recurs at *1 of G.A., Pallas Armata , 1639 ( S.T.C. 3), A1 of T. Carew, Poems , 1640 ( S.T.C. 4620, also printed for Walkley), and at A2 of Exemplarie Novells .</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Broadside Prologue by Farquhar by Shirley Strum Kenny</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A prologue by playwright George Farquhar published as a half-sheet broadside in October 1706 and never yet republished with his works provides an unquestionable addition to the Farquhar canon. The piece is entitled THE | PROLOGUE | Spoken by Mr. WILKS, | At the Opening of the THEATRE in the Hay-Market , | October the 15th, 1706. ∥ Written by Mr. Farquhar. ∥ It bears the imprint of Benjamin Bragg at the Raven in Pater-noster-row, the bookseller who published the first London edition of Farquhar's Stage-Coach in 1705. The one copy of this item that I have been able to find, the copy in the Houghton Library collection, contains on the verso a half-sheet bill printed for the government by Henry Hills in Black-Friars, near the Water-side, on 21 April 1708. 1 The greatest importance of the half-sheet is, of course, the discovery of a new theatrical poem by one of the major playwrights of the period, but the item also adds to the store of information on publication of theatrical literature at the turn of the eighteenth century and provides a footnote on the career of the piratical Henry Hills Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue and epilogues, an important part of the theater bill because audiences loudly demanded them, were published in several ways in Farquhar's day. Most frequently those written for premieres and once in a while later ones were printed with the plays they complemented; some, particularly occasional ones, appeared in miscellanies and literary periodicals; somewhat later they were inserted in newspapers. Farquhar himself was responsible for at least five prologues and epilogues published under his byline in editions of other writers' plays, two occasional ones published in his miscellany Love and Business in 1702, and one reprinted in the Poetical Courant No. 22 on 22 June 1706, not to mention the ones he wrote that were published with his own plays.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Separately published prologues and epilogues were unusual, if one can judge from the number that have survived. Survival is, of course, a some-what unreliable measure of the popularity of this mode of publication, for prologues and epilogues, like broadside ballads, theater tickets, and the big theater bills printed to be posted are the kind of literary artifacts that must have kindled fires more often than they lined libraries; further, those with political significance would have stood a better chance of survival than those without. So survival figures are inevitably less reliable than they are for printed plays or other "literary" publications. From available evidence, however, Mary E. Knapp believes that prologues and epilogues, particularly occasional ones, were often printed separately in the Restoration, most frequently in the decade between 1678 and 1688 when their political virulence outweighed their literary merit, but separate publication declined after the first two decades of the eighteenth century. 2 Autrey Nell Wiley, in Rare Prologues and Epilogues 1642-1700 , lists about seventy prologues and epilogues printed in 1681-1690 (in most cases a prologue and epilogue were printed on the recto and verso of one leaf); about ten for 1691-1700; about thirty for 1701-1710 (Farquhar's prologue is not among those listed); and six prologues and one epilogue for 1711-1720. 3 The most popular format, "the established mode from 1681 to 1700," according to Professor Wiley, was the folio half-sheet with a prologue printed on the recto, an epilogue on the verso, although in earlier years broadsides had been used. 4 In her list, however, she includes eight prologues and one epilogue published singly in 1701-1710, the decade in which Farquhar's broadside prologue appeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Separate publication, as opposed to other means of printing, suggests a particular interest in a prologue or epilogue that would make it worth the expense to turn it out; obviously occasional prologues would most often qualify for such treatment. Farquhar's prologue for the opening of the theater, with its theatrical rather than political satire, was most likely printed for immediate sale to play-goers. Perhaps it was ordered by the Haymarket company for distribution inside the playhouse on the night it was spoken; this was later the case with Nicholas Rowe's epilogue for Love for Love , spoken by Mrs. Barry at Thomas Betterton's benefit at the Drury Lane 7 April 1709 and, like Farquhar's piece, printed singly. 5</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The occasion was, certainly, an important one for the new Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket. Only eighteen months old, the theater had been conceived and built by John Vanbrugh, the architect not only of the building but of its financial scheme and its theatrical plans. It had opened 9 April 1705 with an opera called The Loves of Ergasto and had for the next season featured opera and "singing and dancing," interspersed with performances by Betterton's company previously housed at Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. In the fall of 1706 Vanbrugh entered an agreement with Owen Swiny, who, with the surprising approval of Christopher Rich, the manager of the Drury Lane Theatre, to whom Swiny owed £200, left the Drury Lane company to become manager of the new theater, taking with him to join Betterton's troupe most of Rich's best actors, including Robert Wilks, Benjamin Johnson, John Mills, William Bullock, Theophilus Keen, Henry "Jubilee Dicky" Norris, Henry Fairbank, Anne Oldfield, and, after the season opened, Colley Cibber. 6 These were actors with whom Farquhar had close relationships; several—Wilks, Keen, Norris—had played with him when he was an actor at the Smock-Alley Theatre in Dublin; Wilks and Norris had made their reputations in his Constant Couple ; Wilks was unquestionably his best friend; and not only had Oldfield apparently been his mistress at one time, but theatrical legend has it that he discovered her acting talents and introduced her to Vanbrugh who brought her to the stage. 7</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Despite its former policy of offering musical entertainment, the Queen's Theatre opened in 1706 determined to present good English plays, not foreign music. The policy must have appealed strongly to the actors who deserted Rich, for they felt that as czar of Drury Lane he had favored and overpaid the dancers, singers, and "exotic entertainers," many of whom were imported from France and Italy, while their own pay had habitually fallen in arrears. 8 In the 1705-1706 season the Drury Lane Company included twenty-seven actors and actresses, but there were twenty-nine singers, musicians, and dancers, including such foreign names as those of singers Joanna Maria and Mrs. de l'Epine, musicians Gasperini and Paisible, and dancers Cherrier, du Ruel and Mrs. du Ruel, Laforest, and Latourdy. By the 1706-1707 season the number of actors dropped to eleven while the number of singers and dancers stood at seventeen and more foreigners were among those employed. 9 The deserting actors had every reason to expect better treatment at the Queen's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On 14 October and 15 October 1706 the new company advertised in the Daily Courant a performance of Dryden's Spanish Fryar to open the season, defiantly adding "Without Singing or Dancing." It is notable that the advertisement did not mention the new prologue by Farquhar, because it would unquestionably have been an inducement to come to the opening performance. Because prologues were so popular with audiences, the management apparently offered Farquhar, the most popular playwright affiliated with the Drury Lane Theater, a few guineas to contribute one for the occasion. 10 The omission of any reference to it in the advertisements suggests that it was ordered very late, perhaps after the copy was submitted for the 14 October advertisement which was routinely updated and rerun the next day. All the plans for the opening were made in a hurry; Cibber says the actors' scheme of desertion was concerted and executed in a "very few Days" before the season opened. 11 Farquhar's prologue must have been composed at the eleventh hour; in Love and Business he himself speaks of his ability to write fast: "I have so natural a Propensity to Ease, that I cannot chearfully fix to any Study, which bears not a Pleasure in the Application, which makes me inclineable to Poetry above any thing else. . . . I ought to thank Providence that I can by Three Hours Study live One and Twenty with Satisfaction. . . ." 12 Wilks, not only Farquhar's closest friend but also a man jealous of his prerogatives as a speaker of prologues 13 and an actor noted for his efficiency in studying parts and his excellent memory, 14 was given the new lines to speak. If Farquhar's prologue were not completed until the morning of the 15th, it could have been memorized and printed broadside for that night's performance. 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To emphasize the actors' relief at being freed from Rich's tyranny, Farquhar used for his shaping metaphor a comparison of the theatrical battlefield of London with the theater of war in Europe. He likened Rich, the "Dramatick Prince of Drury-Lane ," to Louis XIV, the actors fleeing before Rich's musical "Dragoons" to Louis's subjects and more specifically to the Camisars, France's persecuted Calvinists. He compared the subscription of £100 each from thirty "Persons of Quality" to build the theater 16 to the loan issued by the government 17 which enabled Marlborough to campaign in Europe in the spring and summer of 1706 when his forces conquered Turin and Ramillies and then marched triumphantly into Louvain, Belgium, Madrid, and Menin to free Europe from Louis's grasp. He then ended the piece with the traditional praise of Queen Anne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The prologue reads: Great Revolutions Crown this Wond'rous Year, And Scenes are strangely turn'd, abroad, and here; A Year mark'd out by Fate's Supream Decree To set the Theatre , and Europe free: A Year, in which the Destinies Ordain } The Mighty Monarch LEWIS to Restrain, } And the Dramatick Prince of Drury-Lane .} Both boldly push'd, to make the World their Prey, Beggar'd their Subjects to inlarge their Sway; But here, we own, the Simile does break, Our Prince ne'er hurt us for Religion's sake. To you the Asylum of the Refugee, Like Poor Distressed Camisars we flee; Who Starv'd beneath our Vines, like those in France , To feed those Damn'd Dragoons of Song and Dance. The Muses Cause we own, here stand our Ground, With Sense to Combate all the Power of Sound: They take the Foreign; we the Brittish Law, The Poets ours, and theirs the Fa, la, la. You—whose Subscriptions rais'd this fair Machine,} Whose timely Loan recover'd lost Turin , } Declare for Action in this Glorious Reign. } A Female Reign gives Liberty to Man; And Tyrants vanish at the Name of ANNE : Our State, and Stage must Liberty pursue, When Rul'd by ANNA , and Maintain'd by you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Houghton copy, which survived through a fluke of printing history, serves as a rare reminder of how much theatrical literature of Farquhar's period has vanished and how great the gaps in our knowledge of the program of the playhouse and of its writers' canons remain. It is an unsold copy that lay in the printing shop of Henry Hills Jr., when in 1708, with paper costs high and Hills's operation necessarily as inexpensive as possible, he printed on its verso a copy of a government half-sheet broadside, " A LIST of the Names of the Prisoners , English, | Scotch, and Irish taken on Board the Salisbury, by | Her Majesties Ship the Leopard, who were this After- | noon being the 21st of this Instant April, brought to | Newgate, in order to take their Tryals, and receive a | just Reward for their intended Villany . . . ." The imprint reads " LONDON : Printed by Henry Hills , in Black-Friars , near | the Water-side. 1708." The men had been captured on 14 March when, Sir George Byng's forces having chased the French fleet from the Firth of Forth, the men of the Leopard boarded the Salisbury , a ship previously seized from the English by the French, and captured more than 700 officers and men including some British Jacobites. The men were dispatched on board several ships and the nineteen men listed by Hills were brought to London to stand trial on 21 April, as the broadside shows, and committed to Newgate that day. 18 Their names ran in the Daily Courant 23 April, the list tallying with that printed by Hills except for some typographical errors and variant spellings (the Daily Courant printed Cusaac for Busaac, Pendergras for Prendergast, Burket for Burker, Fannon for Fannion, Macarty for Maccarty, etc.). Although I have not found an official document that includes the names, presumably Hills, printing for the government, would have had the more nearly accurate list.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hills's half-sheet was obviously ordered by the government to be posted in order to discourage would-be Jacobites; the list is followed by a sermon on the evils of Jacobitism:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What these Unfortunate Gentlement have now to do, is only Seriously to Reflect with great Remorse of Conscience on the Justice of Divine Providence, who has for all their Wicked Actions and Loose Conversations at last detected them in the worst of Crimes; coming with an intent to set their own Country in Blood; and so subvert the Fundamental Laws of the Realm; and not only so, but to Support a Pretender , in order to dethrone the best of Queens, and bring in a French Tyrannical Government. Let them seriously Reflect on themselves, that God should out of such a Number of Ships and Men, suffer them and their Ship only to be taken, and made Examples of, and think in what a grievous manner they have Offended him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hills's relations with the government prior to his piracies of 1708-1710 which supposedly influenced passage of the Copyright Act of 1710 were distinctly strained. 19 His father Henry Hills Sr., a former Puritan and then Anglican who turned Catholic in the reign of James II, owned a share of the government printing patent which took effect in 1677, but when the old man's will was probated 21 January 1689, his eldest son Henry was turned off with twenty pounds, and the bulk of the estate went to his second wife Elizabeth, another Catholic, and her three children. Administrator of the will was Gilham Hills, Henry's full brother, also a printer, who thereby in effect succeeded to his father's share of the patent as King's Printer, which ran to 1707 and was renewed until 1740. Henry Jr. fought to break the will, petitioning the Crown 13 August 1691 on the grounds that the profits were going to recusants, Elizabeth and her children, and stating further that because Hills Sr. printed papist books the patent was forfeit before he made his will and therefore he could not bequeath it; he asked that a legitimate patent to him replace the illegitimate one inherited by Elizabeth Hills and her children. He petitioned again 9 February 1694, and a third time 9 June 1698, but in vain. Soon after the probate of the father's will, on 25 April 1689, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Hills Jr. on suspicion of high treason for reasons not now known, but he was never convicted. Hills had one other connection with the government: he served as "messenger, appointed to inspect printing presses for the discovery of unlicensed books, pamphlets, and newspapers" according to a warrant issued 2 September 1689 and continued in this function for at least three years. 20 But his relationship with the government between that time and the Copyright Act of 1710 remains a mystery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The list of prisoners printed in 1708 leaves no doubt that if Hills, who omitted Junior from his imprint after his father's death, never succeeded to the patent, he at least indirectly did government printing. A. F. Johnson mentions that an earlier patentee, Christopher Barker, farmed out his share of the patent to George Sawbridge, Henry Hills Sr., and others. 21 Obviously a later patentee, perhaps Edward Brewster or John Williams but probably not Gilham Hills because of the family rift, farmed out work to Hills. The frequency of Hills's work for the government printing office can not be gauged, since so few bills for posting or comparable items remain extant, but there can be no question that Hills did, under his own imprint, work for the Queen's Printer. He also indulged in cheap piracies, Velz believes perhaps as early as the 1690's; 22 by 1707 he had certainly printed at least a few; 23 and by 1709 he was notorious for cheap pirated editions of poems and sermons. But on 21 April 1708 he worked as a job printer at least indirectly in Queen Anne's employ. His list was tucked away by someone whose interest in the "Unfortunate Gentlemen" of the Salisbury led to the preservation of Farquhar's prologue.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Evidence from Defoe's Title Pages by Rodney M. Baine</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the misinterpretations from which Daniel Defoe has suffered, some of the most interesting have been due to scholars' ignorance of bibliography. Especially important distortions of his artistry have resulted from their misinterpretations of the title pages of his fiction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is delusive to suppose that the title page of a Defoe novel reproduces his own suggested title and especially fallacious to expect that it provides evidence of his original plan. The title page of a first edition was normally set last, as every student of bibliography knows, with the preliminaries. But more important, in the early eighteenth century the title page was still primarily the publisher's advertisement, or bill of fare, especially for popular literature like fiction and rogue biography. In such books especially the title page is best regarded, as McKerrow noted for books throughout the entire seventeenth century, "not as part of the work to which it is prefixed, or as a production of its author, but rather as an explanatory label affixed to the book by the printer or publisher." 1 The practice of preparing and posting title pages to advertise new books, a practice widespread in the last decades of the seventeenth century, was still in use in Defoe's day. The rubricated title pages for the editions of Defoe's Col. Jack in 1724 and 1738 would indicate that at least these titles were designed to be posted. Since the 1724 title page was prepared by the same syndicate of booksellers that published the first edition, one can assume that the original title page was similarly intended. Publication of Col. Jack by a syndicate of booksellers suggests that the author did not supervise, or perhaps even assist in the publication of his book, apart from contributing a preface. Ordinarily the publishing conger of the early eighteenth century evidently purchased outright the copy of a promising book and proceeded to market it in the most attractive way possible 2 The author was evidently not responsible for seeing the book through the press and often did not bother to correct the errors. It is hardly likely, under such circumstances, that he was responsible for the title page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus the only reliable indication of Defoe's intended title is the neglected head title, which was ordinarily set, in first editions, with the first sheet. As Mr. McKerrow suggests in general for works of the previous century, "we may probably infer that this heading preserves the name that the author originally intended" (p. 91). For Col. Jack the head title is simply "THE LIFE OF Col. JACK , &amp;c." For Moll Flanders it is "THE HISTORY AND MISFORTUNES of the Famous Moll Flanders, &amp; ." This is just about all the title which, we can be reasonably sure, owes to Defoe himself. For Defoe's fiction the comparative reliability of the head title is perhaps most vividly exemplified in A Journal of the Plague Year . Both the head title and the running title read "MEMOIRS OF THE PLAGUE," and it is probably by this title that the book should be known.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the title pages of Defoe's fiction have been used not only to authenticate his venality, but to demonstrate his heedlessness in planning and writing his novels. Such a charge has been levelled especially against Captain Singleton, Col. Jack , and The Fortunate Mistress .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The unjustifiable assumption that the title page would preserve the authors' original plan and would thus help in reconstructing the writing of the novel appears in M. Dottin's remarks concerning Captain Singleton : "Il était édité par un groupe de libraires, qui, vraisemblablement, avait traité avec De Foe au seul vu du titre et acheté d'avance le manuscrit. . . . Le titre était, selon l'usage du temps, un résumé du contenu du livre." 3 According to M. Dottin, the outlined plan was not actually followed: "En effect, il n'est pas question, dans le titre, de la traversée de l'Afrique: cette idée ne vint sans doute à De Foe que plus tard, en pleine péiode de rédaction" (III, 617, n. 11). Even had the title been written first, M. Dottin's postulation that the title page shows a novel planned without a trip through Africa is difficult to understand when one reads the original title page: THE | LIFE, | ADVENTURES, | AND | PYRACIES, | of the Famous Captain SINGLETON : | Containing an Account of his | being set on Shore in the Island of | Madagascar , his Settlement there, with a De|scription of the Place and Inhabitants: Of his | Passage from thence, in a Paraguay, to the | main land of Africa , with an Account of the | Customs and Manners of the People: His | great Deliverances from the barbarous Na|tives and wild Beasts: Of his meeting with | an Englishman , a Citizen of London , among the Indians. . . . Here the title clearly promises a trip into Africa. The real confusion concerns the " Englishman , a Citizen of London," whom Singleton supposedly meets "among the Indians." Singleton does meet an Englishman among the African natives, but he is not identified as a Londoner. 4 Probably the hurried reader who prepared the title page conflated this surprising figure with the Dutchman whom Singleton rescues from the Ceylonese and Robert Knox, whom Singleton does not meet at all, but whose Ceylon adventure is briefly narrated. At any rate, the confusion could hardly have been the author's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Particularly interesting are the unsubstantiated deductions from the title page of Col. Jack : THE | HISTORY | And Remarkable | LIFE | Of the truly Honourable | Col. JACQUE, | COMMONLY CALL'D | Col. JACK, | WHO WAS | Born a Gentleman, put 'Prentice to a Pick- | Pocket, was Six and Twenty Years a Thief, | and then Kidnapp'd to VIRGINIA. | Came back a Merchant, married four Wives, | and five of them prov'd Whores ; went into the Wars , | behav'd bravely, got Preferment, was made Colonel | of a Regiment, came over, and fled with the Chevalier , | and is now abroad compleating a Life of Wonders, | and resolves to dye a GENERAL. . . . Even those who do not recall fully the plot of the novel perceive at once the blunder "married four Wives, and five of them prov'd Whores ." The very fact that such a blunder appeared in the first issue should surely have suggested the strong probability that the title page was not the work of the author. Obviously this blunder is probably not a compositor's slip, but the mistake of a reader confused by Jack's remarriage to one of his four wives. But evidently alone among Defoe scholars, Sam Holt Monk was aware that this blunder might not have been Defoe's. 5 To Thomas Wright it was evidence "to show how hastily Defoe's works were written." 6 In a second issue of the first edition the title page was soon corrected to state that Colonel Jack "was Five times married to Four Whores ." But the other discrepancies were allowed to stand. In the text Colonel Jack is a thief for six years, not twenty-six. He does not fly with the Chevalier. At the end of the novel he is presented as a sober citizen of London, not an officer serving abroad.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Instead of correcting these inaccuracies, title pages of subsequent editions of the novel added inexactitudes and misrepresentations. For example the "third" (second) edition, of 1724, published by the same "conger," or syndicate of booksellers, made explicit the implication of the original title page, adding that Colonel Jack had "follow'd the Fortunes of the Chevalier de St. George." In 1738, when Defoe was in his grave, John Applebee added the misrepresentation that Jack "was taken at the Preston Rebellion" and specified that he "is now at the Head of his Regiment, in the Service of the Czarina fighting against the Turks." Applebee also added to the title page the attribution "written by the Author of ROBINSON CRUSOE " and signed the Preface "Daniel D'efoe." For this identification he probably had ample evidence: Defoe had begun writing for him in 1720. But for the additions to the title Applebee surely had no authority. Oddly enough the distinguished eighteenth-century scholar George Aitken suggested that the original title page "was revised because it contained a reference to" Colonel Jack's "service in the Czarina's army, 'fighting against the Turks,' a matter which Defoe did not mention in the book, perhaps because he found the story was long enough without it." 7 If Defoe scholars continue to utilize the title pages as evidence of the author's original plans, they should at least quote the titles of the first editions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The assumption that the author's original plan might be, or was, preserved in the title page has for decades afforded Defoe scholars explanations or examples of Defoe's haste and careless planning. Concerning Col. Jack , Paul Dottin posited, "Après avoir tracé les grandes lignes de son ouvrage De Foe en rédigea le titre, mais, comme d'habitude, sans s'intendire de modifier en cours de route son plan primitif" (III, 688). Regarding an incident in the text where the hero abstains from complete participation in the Jacobite rebellion of 1715, moreover, M. Dottin suggested, "En écrivant ces lignes, De Foe avait évidemment l'intention d'abandonner cet épisode qu'il avait pourtant annoncé dans le titre" (III, 700, n. 14). But from the title page of Col. Jack Mr. John Robert Moore has educed even more interesting conjectures concerning Defoe's alleged changes of plan. The discrepancy between the hero as Jacobite rebel in the title page and grateful supporter of George I in the text, Mr. Moore asserts, is "explained by the fact that the book was planned before Bishop Atterbury's conspiracy was discovered, but published while Atterbury was in the Tower awaiting trial for treason" ( Checklist , p. 184). In his biography of Defoe Mr. Moore elaborated upon his theory: When Defoe began the story, the last Jacobite uprising lay three years behind him, and he felt free to present an adherent of the Pretender as a romantic and successful figure. But in the late summer of 1722 a new conspiracy against the government was exposed. On August 24 the Bishop of Rochester was arrested, and he was still in the Tower awaiting trial when Defoe's novel was published. . . . In the novel as it was published, Colonel Jack was no longer a flamboyant rebel, serving under the Chevalier and resolving to die a general, but a peaceful English planter near Chesapeake Bay. 8 One should perhaps hardly bother to point out that at the time of writing Colonel Jack is represented as a citizen of London. The important error is the assumption that Defoe planned the novel as early as 1718, for which no shred of evidence is forthcoming, and that the title page can be relied on to embody Defoe's original plan. Surely we are not asked to believe that Defoe began to plan the novel at the time when Colonel Jack is represented as writing it. But even the late William McBurney, trained though he was in eighteenth-century bibliography, was misled by the evidence of this title page. Citing the original title, he commented, "Defoe seems again to have recalled what may have been his original plan for the work and decided to purge Jacque of his one dishonorable trait—the political indifference and thoughtless toying with treason." 9</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of all the title pages which introduce Defoe's novels, however, that of his last, The Fortunate Mistress , is the most confusing. Probably Defoe was not responsible for a single word of the subtitle: A History of the Life and Vast Variety of Fortunes of Mademoiselle de Beleau, afterwards called the Countess de Wintelsheim in Germany, being the Person known by the Name of the Lady Roxana in the Time of Charles II . If Defoe had intended to name his heroine on the title page, he would surely have named her in the novel. On the contrary, as Editor, he explained in the Preface "that it was necessary to conceal names." 10 Except for the casual information that her daughter Susan was named for her (p. 205), she is named only by her sobriquet, "Roxana." The name "Mademoiselle de Beleau" is probably the publishers' invention; the title "Countess de Wintelsheim in Germany" is almost certainly their error. So far as the novel tells us, Roxana is never in Germany. Her German prince never marries her or takes her there. Her last husband is Dutch, not German, and at the end of the story they are living in the Hague. The second, 1735 edition was entitled simply The Life and Adventures of Roxana , the Fortunate Mistress, or most Unhappy Wife .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the subtitle also indicates a setting in the time of Charles II. Was Defoe writing so rapidly and carelessly that he had his heroine, born in 1673, dancing, some forty years later, for the courtiers of Charles II? The chronology of the novel itself is fairly consistent. Roxana was brought over to England in 1683, when she was ten years old. She married at fifteen, was deserted by her husband eight years later, and after about a year of destitution she became the mistress of a jeweller for approximately seven years and then of a German prince for eight more. About a year later, about 1712, that is, or somewhat later by other computations, she returned to England. A few years later she became known as Roxana. Her setting as Roxana would then be London in the early reign of George I, not the late reign of Charles II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among other evidence, some too intricate to be detailed here, perhaps the most striking proof that Defoe had in mind his own times rather than those of Charles II is the elaborate attention which he gave to Roxana's Turkish costume. When she first performs in it, Roxana describes her attire in detail (p. 174); and when she next dances in it, she again describes it minutely and mentions the oriental costumes of her two visitors. Moreover her daughter Susan continually brings forward this costume as evidence for identifying Roxana as her mother. The emphasis which Defoe gave this attire in the plot thus justifies its selection for the original frontispiece: here Roxana is exhibited in her Turkish costume. Such a costume did not characterize the Restoration stage Roxana, who evidently wore some sort of turban and perhaps a veil, but little authentic to suggest genuinely oriental attire. 11 Roxana's Turkish costume suggests that Defoe expected the alert reader to visualize present time, in the fringes of the court of George I, where Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had recently popularized Turkish dress for women. Doutbless few readers of the novel had seen any of the numerous pictures which Lady Mary had had painted of herself in her Turkish garb, but many had probably seen the satirical engraving of Lady Mary as "The Female Traveller," where she is dressed in Turkish attire and wears a crucifix. 12 Interestingly enough, Roxana mentions wearing no crucifix, but only her diamond necklace. The crucifix which adorns her in the frontispiece of the novel probably derives from the print of Lady Mary. Very likely, moreover, Lady Mary and her protégée Maria Skerrett suggested Roxana's two visitors who arrive in oriental costumes "by Order of a Noble Person, who, with his Family, had been in Persia " (p. 178). If the title page had not misled us, we would long ago have perceived that the setting of the Roxana scenes is the London of George I.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Westminster Review : Change of Editorship, 1840 by Rosemary T. VanArsdel</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Details of the transfer of ownership of the London and Westminster Review in 1840 from John Stuart Mill to William Edward Hickson have never been clear nor have Mill's reasons for choosing a seemingly obscure and inexperienced editor as his successor. Although no precise statement of Mill's thinking on the matter exists, it is now possible to make some reasonable conjectures drawn from four basic bodies of evidence: Mill's letters to three correspondents, Hickson, Henry Cole and John Robertson; Henry Cole's unpublished diary from 1839 to 1841; a letter by John Robertson, Mill's assistant on the Westminster ; and a large amount of newly discovered biographical material about Hickson, which indicates that he was a man of much wider public interests and experience than previously had been thought. The four separate viewpoints which these sources provide offer insights to the private maneuverings by three men with widely different motives, for control of one of the great quarterlies of the nineteenth century. Mill assumed editorial control of the London and Westminster Review in 1837, later receiving it as a debt-ridden gift from its owner, William Molesworth. Molesworth had founded the London Review in April, 1835, merged it with the Westminster Review in 1836, always struggling to advance original Benthamite principles. Eventually he lost so much money that he no longer felt able to continue and handed it on to Mill with whom he was already collaborating. Mill was persuaded that there was no longer a place for unadulterated Benthamism and intended to conduct the review on somewhat modified political principles. In a letter to Edward Bulwer Lytton on 23 November 1836, whom he was wooing as a possible contributor of the London and Westminster , he stated that he had allowed himself to become connected with the review "to soften the harder and sterner features of its radicalism and utilitarianism, both which in the form in which they originally appeared in the Westminster, were part of the inheritance of the 18th century." 1 But three years later Mill was ready to withdraw as proprietor and devote his energies to India House and his own writing. His letters of 1838-1840 reflect the tensions, discouragements and vascillating viewpoints which he faced as he moved toward a decision about a successor. As Mill pondered the problem he found himself not only in the middle of a spirited three-way struggle for control of the Westminster but faced, as well, with the choice between trying to insure its continuance as a radical organ, or compromising with its Benthamite founders and allowing it to fall into the hands of purely commercial interests. In December, 1838, Mill's physician ordered him to the continent for a prolonged stay to improve his health, thus leaving John Robertson, his assistant editor, in full charge of the April, 1839 number of the Westminster . Robertson, a Scot, trained for the ministry but come to London for a literary career, was a man much bitten by ambition and, as Cole's diary shows, not entirely scrupulous in his principles. Mill had known him first as a fellow contributor to the Morning Chronicle and the London and Westminster , and later met him from time to time as a fellow member of the Reform Club. "Professor Bain, who knew him well, was rather surprised at John Mill's enthusiastic estimate of his attainments, which he thought were of the slightest, while his industry was, to say the best of it, fitful. He was a lively young man, with an unfailing eye for a careless feminine ankle; . . ." 2 The association with Mill as assistant editor must surely have satisfied Robertson's ego, because the connection was clearly more valuable for Robertson than for Mill. However, as soon as Mill was safely away, Robertson's high-handedness asserted itself as he assumed autocratic charge of the review. By April, 1839, Mill was writing decidedly irritable letters from Italy protesting his assistant's policies: I have been very much annoyed by seeing announced in the advertisement of the Review the article which, in a letter that must have reached you in time, I so very particularly requested you to omit; and my annoyance has not been diminshed by the manner in which the announcement is made, which is fitter for the Satirist or the Age than for any periodical which lays claim either to a literary character or a gentlemanly one (II. 396). Ill health, editorial worries and shortage of funds were not the only matters conspiring to persuade Mill to part with the review. He was also discouraged by failure of the Radical party to unite behind one leader and thus give the Westminster a base of power to support. In the latter part of the 1830's, many felt, including Mill, that Lord Durham was the man. (Packe, 224-235). Mill supported the Durham mission to Canada, applauded the soundness of his approach to Colonial government, and cherished high hopes that Durham would assume the Radical leadership. When Durham, upon his return from Canada, was viciously attacked by his enemies in Parliament as a tyrant and a bungler, Mill set forth in the pages of the Westminster the calm and measured defense which saved him. But Durham had returned to England mortally ill and broken by what he considered ministerial betrayal at home. He no longer had a taste for political organization. Mill realized that without him there were only warring factions and splinter groups, and from Rome, on 6 April 1839, he wrote dejectedly to Robertson: I have, as you see, taken plenty of time to consider about the manner in which what you told me about Lord Durham in your last letter affects the position of the Review and the question of continuing or not to carry it on. The result is to strengthen very greatly the inclination I had before to get it off my hands. . . . if there is to be no radical party there need be no Westminster Review, for there is no position for it to take, distinguishing it from the Edinburgh (II. 396). Later in the same letter, as if to underline his resolve, he remarked: I do not feel clear about publishing even another number. . . . I shall be glad if you can avoid entering into any positive engagements about articles for the July number till I return and can look about me. Returning to the subject on 31 May 1839, almost two months later, Mill wrote to Robertson from Munich: . . . I expect no change whatever in the politics of the ministry as long as Melbourne is at their head; and when a change does come it will be so gradual and imperceptible that the Review will not profit much by it. I must get rid of the Review not only on account of the expense, but the time and exertion (II. 399). Later in the same letter, as Mill's mind began to cast about for successors, he commented: "And I see no prospect of Lord Durham or anybody else taking it off my hands, as matters stand at present." Two sentences later he asked Robertson, "Do you think Dilke 3 would now be willing to take it, and would you sound him on the subject?" Sandwiched between these two sentences, however, is a single remark which contains the clue to most of the subsequent negotiating for the review, and to Mill's final decision to choose Hickson. He wrote: I ought not to drop it without trying to preserve an organ for radicalism by offering it to any radical who would carry it on, on radical lines. Mill continued to think of either a merger or of enlisting the aid of an established, experienced editor. He approached John Mitchell Kemble, editor of the British and Foreign Review , 1836-1844, which was owned by Thomas Wentworth Beaumont. Kemble evidently replied with a list of objections, citing a number of public questions on which there would be philosophical differences between the two reviews. Mill countered on 14 October 1839, saying that radicals were "people who wish to carry their changes beyond those which would be consented to by Whigs or Tories" and by means of this broad definition should be able to group varying shades of opinion under the same banner. He concluded: If I thought I could do better for my principles, different as they are in some important respects from yours, than by placing my review under your guidance, I would do so: but as in the present state of affairs in this country I know of no disposal I could make of it, without having to get over objections fully as strong and even stronger, I accept your offer of writing to Mr. Beaumont on the subject although I can hardly expect that your unfavorable opinion, if it should continue, will not turn the scale against me (II. 410). Mill continued to hope that this merger would be possible and even when he began to consider Henry Cole as a possible successor he qualified his words with the phrase "subject to the chance of Beaumont's accepting." (II. 410). Attention now shifts to the triumvirate seeking control of the Westminster . First, there was John Robertson, who, because of Westminster business, was Mill's chief correspondent during this period and was surely aware of his superior's discouragement and uncertainty. With his aggressive cast of mind he undoubtedly began to calculate the chances for the prestigious Westminster to fall into his own hands with little, perhaps no financial investment on his part. Mill did not regard the review as a business commodity, and because it had come to him virtually as a gift from Molesworth he thought of passing it on in much the same way. The second member of the triumvirate was young Henry Cole (later Sir Henry of Great Exhibition fame) who was busy building a career for himself in London public life. Cole, son of an Army captain, was born in 1808, educated at Christ's Hospital, and began his career in 1823, as clerk to Francis Palgrave (later Sir Francis), who was then a subcommissioner of the Record Commission. 4 Cole lived in a house owned by Thomas Love Peacock, who became his firm friend and introduced him to many young men of similar circumstances, including Thackeray, who became a life-long intimate. In the late 1820's, Peacock took Cole to the newly organized London Debating Society, which met fortnightly to seek the truth on public issues. It was here that Cole first met J. S. Mill, Charles Buller, George Grote and many other young liberals. He so ingratiated himself that by August, 1832, he accompanied Mill on a walking tour in the south of England. Cole was a man of enormous energy and drive. In 1832, he was appointed sub-commissioner of a new records commission and by 1838, when the Record Office was constituted, Cole became one of the four assistant keepers. In that year he also took up the cause of postal reform, under Sir Rowland Hill's direction, serving as secretary to the reform committee and editing its "Post Circular," his first journalistic experience. In August, 1839, Parliament authorized the new postal scheme and Cole immediately entered the competition for the best stamp design. By 23 September, this entry appeared in Cole's diary: "Hill called and told me he was empowered to engage my assistance for as long as it was required at the rate of £250 per ann." And, 24 September, "Called on Lord Langdale to tell him of the Treasury offer which he agreed to my accepting if it did not interfere with the Records." 5 Cole now had two official positions in addition to his many extra-curricular activities, the latter involving book publishing, sketching, wood cuts and design, plus his occasional contributions to the Westminster . While the full account of Cole's career deserves a volume of its own, the preceding sketch shows a young man of energetic determination, amiable and good-humored enough to please his superiors. Cole's manuscript diary for the years 1839-1841 reinforces these preliminary impressions of his character. He was a man of very regular habits, who walked to and from London almost every day, who often "napped" in the evening, but as frequently worked at his desk or "practised music." He appears to have had a warm and affectionate relationship with Marian, his wife, and two baby daughters, the first of his family of five sons and three daughters. Ever shrewd, Cole used those morning walks to town to keep himself in the confidence of those who were in a position to assist his advancement. During 1839, when agitation for postal reform became frenzied, the diary entries "called on R. Hill and walked to town with him" or "walked home with R. Hill" appear almost ad nauseam . And his persistence was rewarded by his official appointment to Hill's staff. Another of Cole's regular walking companions was John Stuart Mill, conveniently both a neighbor and a walker. After Mill's return from the continent in July, 1839, the refrain began anew, but with a different subject: "Called on John Mill and walked to town with him." Poor Hill was left to get to town as best he might! Presumably Mill talked with Cole about his Review troubles, for the entry for 16 August reads: "walked to town with J. Mill to talk with respecting the Review—he said that his connexion with it involved retenance [sic] of Robertson so I did not proceed to give him any hints." One wonders what those hints might have been, but the most likely supposition must be that Cole coveted Robertson's post. The walking continued fitfully throughout August and September, and reached a climax in October when Cole either walked with Mill or encountered him in some other way seven days out of twelve. The entries for these days have one theme, illustrated by the note on 10 October: "Called at and saw the Mills—walked to town with John who intimated that he should offer the L. and W. to Beaumont, proprietor of the Br. and For [ British and Foreign Review ]." Again, on the 18th, "Walked to town with J. Mill— talking chiefly on the management of the L. and W. R." Twice during these months Cole called on Hickson, but no mention is made of what was discussed. And then, as if in some divine retribution for all this exertion, Cole developed a serious boil on his leg which required lancing and kept him housebound for ten days. He did not walk to town again for nearly three months. Significantly, from the time of Cole's illness, 7 November, until 14 January, all contact with Mill came to an end, suggesting, perhaps, that Cole was pushing too hard. The diary entry for Thursday, 7 November, reads: "Robertson called to talk about the future management of the Review." Ten days later, on Sunday, 17 November, Cole notes in his diary: "Jackson, brass smith called—also William Hickson who promised to help in some new arrangements of the L. and W. R." Of the three men clearly intriguing for control of the London and Westminster Review Hickson was perhaps the most reluctant, as will be illustrated later, while the two younger men were plainly very eager indeed. Social contacts between the Cole and Hickson families continued. On Sunday, 8 December, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Hickson, Hickson's aunt and uncle, called. On the 17th Cole joined an evening party at the William Hicksons. One note, 7 January, reports, "Thackeray called and had a talk about the London and W. Review." Finally, 14 January, contact between Mill and Cole was re-established at a party given by the Mills. Events now moved toward two crises destined for the spring of 1840. The first illustrates the serious ambivalence in Mill's mind regarding the disposition of the review. Cole's diary for Thursday, 6 February, notes, "Walked to town with J. Mill — who assented to yielding up the L. and W. to me in case of Beaumont's refusal to buy it." This event was followed by two letters from Mill, one either later in the day on the 6th, or perhaps on the 7th, and a second on Saturday, 8 February. The first reads as follows: DEAR COLE, The review has been altogether so expensive an affair to me, &amp; I am at present drained so dry by that, by my own journey, by this new call upon me for Madeira, etc., that I cannot incur the smallest extra expense on account of the next number of the review, and, all things considered, I would not recommend your doing so. Unless the number sells more than 1,200, the article will do no good, as that has been for a long time the ordinary number sold — though I believe the last number sold rather fewer. The conditional authority you mention I readily give — subject to the chance of Beaumont's accepting. Ever yours, J.S. Mill (II.419). The forepart of the letter refers to Cole's postage stamp article for the Westminster and the plates he was evidently considering commissioning for illustrations, but it is the concluding sentence which is most significant. This would seem to be a reinforcement of their earlier conversation, underscored by use of the expression "you mention." The second letter, 8 February, represents a direct turnabout: MY DEAR COLE, I am afraid you will think me very changeable, but since I saw you last I have thought a good deal more about the proposed arrangement concerning the review, and have heard the opinion of one or two friends on the matter (I had consulted nobody before) &amp; I find their opinion to be exceedingly strong that if the review goes on at all under the same name it will not be possible for me to destroy the connexion in people's minds between it and myself — &amp; that it is much more to my credit that it should cease entirely than that it should be continued as anything else than the philosophical &amp; political organ it was designed to be. I am not sure that after what has passed between us you have not a right to hold me to what was conditionally agreed upon but I hope you will not think it necessary to do so. Of course I hold myself responsible for the expense of the Postage article &amp; will pay for any work that you have entered into engagements for, &amp; I hope that by laying all the blame, where alone it can justly fall, on me, you will be able to terminate the thing without any unpleasantness. Ever yours truly, J.S. Mill (II. 421) The reason for dating this letter the 8th lies in the diary entry by Cole for 9 February which states: "With Charles [his brother] called on J. Mill in reference to his letter wishing to recall his offer of the L. and W. Review." 6 The next day was a holiday, for the Queen's wedding, and the consecutive day the subject is not mentioned in the diary. Then for three mornings Cole called for John Mill and repeatedly found him gone, strongly suggesting that Mill was avoiding him. Finally, on the fourth morning, 15 February, they walked to town together again. During this period he was also seeing Hickson every day or so. Nothing seems to have been settled. The calls on Mill and Hickson continued. The diary is distractingly and painfully silent on what passed at these calls. On 20 February, the diary notes that Robertson appeared. Then for seven days the Review is not mentioned. On 28 February, Robertson re-appeared, he and Cole dined, and Mill, Fletcher, 7 Robertson and Cole walked to Kensington together, presumably conferring en route. Shifting to Robertson once more, the diary entry for Saturday, 29 February, reveals Robertson's character with devastating clarity and gives a sharp picture of the struggle which was taking place: Robertson, to preserve his job and perhaps better his position; Cole, to gain control of an influential quarterly; and Hickson, to see his duty and to do it. Walked to town with John Mill who seemed to think that Robertson could not manage the Review by himself . . . Robertson called and in a round about manner urged all sorts of reasons to influence his remaining Editor of the Review. He said he did not like J. Mill's conduct and that he had offers to write in the Edinburgh, that without him and J. Mill the character of the Review would be gone, that in fact the Review owed him £900, that he had never been able to have his own way, etc., etc . . . The diary entry for 3 March records: "Walked to town with J. Mill who spoke out strongly about Robertson's conceit." Robertson's character is further revealed by his lack of truthfulness about the offer to write for the Edinburgh Review . In an unpublished letter owned by the British Museum, J. S. Mill wrote to Macvey Napier to ask about the possibility of his (Mill's) contributing to the Edinburgh now that he was no longer proprietor of the Westminster . He also suggested Robertson as another prospective contributor. This letter is dated 22 April 1840, almost a month after Robertson made his claim. There is also another letter, in the possession of the National Library of Scotland, in which Robertson wrote to Napier urging his own qualifications as a contributor. This letter is dated 18 May 1840. Between the 19 February and 12 March entries, proposals flew in all directions. Cole walked to town with Mill almost every morning. They called on Hickson together, and Cole called alone, repeatedly. After one interview with Hickson on 7 March the diary notes: "Hickson asked if I should like him to have a greater share of the R. than myself," obviously an effort to accommodate the younger man, for they would bear the financial responsibility directly in proportion to their shares of ownership. Another entry for 5 March recorded: "Robertson called—and proposed that I should be sole proprietor and he editor of the Review—which I said must depend on Mill." This entry suggests that the following letter should be dated 6 March. MY DEAR COLE, Robertson tells me of a mode of carrying on the review with you and him combined which he says you are willing to agree to—on which however it is quite impossible for me to decide unless I first see you. I waited till rather late at Kensington this morning thinking you might possibly come—and should then have gone to your house if I had thought I should find you there. This misadventure makes it impossible to terminate matters immediately, as I go out of town this afternoon and cannot return till Monday. But I think you may proceed with your arrangements on either supposition. I am more annoyed about Hickson, who has reasons for wishing for a speedier decision. Ever yours, J.S. Mill 8 The same day, 6 March, Cole's diary notes: "Wrote to John Mill abt. Robertson's editorship. . . . In the evening writing to Robertson to decline his proposition." Mill wrote again to Cole, probably in early March, still hoping for a last minute solution which he could consider more suitable. MY DEAR COLE, If you are willing to carry on the review under the name of Westminster , &amp; with some slight alteration in the cover, I am willing to make it over to you, without requiring that it should be a new series or new numbering — unless before the present number comes out I receive some communication, at this eleventh hour, from Beaumont, or from another quarter almost as improbable. It will give me still greater satisfaction to deliver it over to you and Hickson jointly, as he proposes, as it will both diminish your risk &amp; aid you very much in the management. Ever yours, J.S. Mill 9 Events of 5 and 6 March seem to mark the point of decision. At last matters could be delayed no longer, for the June issue had to be prepared. Cole's diary for 10 March notes: "Walked to town with John Mill and with him called on Hickson." One feels that the verbal agreement must have been completed at this meeting. Later in the same day he says: "Hicksons, discussing future proceedings with the Review." Finally, on 12 March 1840, Mill wrote to Cole: MY DEAR COLE, I hereby make over to you &amp; Mr. William Hickson my whole interest in the London &amp; Westminster Review — the work hereafter to be called the Westminster Review &amp; the change of proprietorship to be announced in the next number. Yours very truly J.S. Mill (II.424) The Westminster at long last was in the possession of new owners, Hickson to supervise the editorial matters and the business management to be shared by both. Cole called at Hickson's almost every day for a week until 20 March, he states: "Drank tea at Hicksons settling terms of our partnership in the Review." The settlement was not without its disagreeable side, however, for Robertson was bitter at his loss of position and disappointed in his hopes to use the review to further his political ambitions. 10 In any case, there can be no question of Robertson's political leanings, expressed in his own words in the following excerpt from a letter to Macvey Napier, 18 May 1840. "Now, I do not think I shall say anything (let me publish the article wherever I may) likely to clash with the views of the oldest supporters of the Edinburgh Review. Though I was for three years, sole editor of the London and Westminster Review I have never been either a Benthamite, a Utilitarian or an Ultra-Radical. Molesworth left the London and Westminster Review on the appearance of the first number edited by me. The Roebuck set have always denounced me as a Whig, and accused me of making Mr. John Mill one. In fact like almost every young Scotchman of my standing I have a great deal more of the Edinburgh Review in me than of the Westminster." 11 Robertson lashed out at Mill for allowing control to pass to Cole and Hickson and for loss of his own editorial position, although evidence indicates that Hickson was the one who insisted Robertson should go, for reasons of economy. 12 Mill replied in conciliatory tones: I am exceedingly grieved by the consciousness that I must appear to you (what I never have been nor could be intentionally) unkind to you. The thought of this matter has been, ever since it was first mentioned by you in a letter last July, but especially of late no small addition to the burthens of various sorts that have lain upon me. I feel, however, that I have meant rightly to you and to every other interest concerned, and that I have acted to the best of my judgment; and though I feel painfully the impossibility of my convincing you that I am right, I am sure you will respect me more for acting upon my own conviction than for giving way, from feelings of friendship and confidence, without being convinced. Cole repeatedly expressed his wish not to stand in the way of any arrangement more beneficial to you and independent of him; but we seemed to have already exhausted the possibilities of such, and as it was impossible to keep Hickson any longer without an answer, I have told Cole that I considered the Review as made over to them, although the formal transfer has not yet taken place. I am sure you have that in you which a disappointment in so poor a hope as this cannot unnerve or permanently discourage. Ever yours, J.S. Mill 13 Robertson presumably replied ill-temperedly and the weary Mill wrote once again, answering five specific points of misunderstanding, and temporarily the long struggle was at an end. A second ownership crisis took place only a short time later, also recorded faithfully in Cole's diary. Immediately after formal transfer of ownership work began on the next issue. Cole applied himself with his customary tireless energy to recruiting contributors, visiting printers and booksellers, conferring with Hickson and supervising the innumerable details of editing a great review. He called on Hickson as indefatigably as he previously had on Hill and Mill. Evening after evening the diary notes, "writing at review correspondence." The Cole and Hickson families entertained back and forth, and many of Cole's days began with breakfast at the Hicksons. By mid-April he was busy reading proofs and dispatching advertising circulars; the record of calls paid and received day after day on review business is staggering and incessant. The end of May found him, "reading Ms. for next no. of Review," and at length, 26 May, "Review published or rather out today." Immediately thereafter one senses a let-down; Cole's enthusiasm waned with surprising speed for a man who had recently struggled so ardously to own the quarterly. For 1 June he noted, "Review moving though but slowly." On 22 June he observed, "The Review very torpid," and on 23 June, "Walked with John Mill to town and told him I thought of giving up the Review to Hickson." On 29 June the diary noted, "review very languid in its sale." On 1 July, in what sounds very much like a council of war, the three men met and the diary stated, "Breakfasted at the Hicksons—J. Mill called there." Finally, on 3 July, at the end of a busy, frantic day in the city, Cole noted, "to Hickson's to tell him abt giving up Review— but he did not seem inclined to take it." By Wednesday, 8 July, Hickson had evidently resigned himself to the inevitable departure. Cole breakfasted with him and the only thing to be decided was whether they would share the expenses of the last number (September), but by the 13th, the diary recorded: "Called on Hickson in my way home—he agreed to take all the risk of the last number of the Review." Hickson may have felt a clean break was better. Cole, not seeming to realize that he might have saddled Hickson with an intolerable burden, continued to call and breakfast at Hickson's in most amiable fashion, until 29 July, when the diary observed: "Bkfasted at the Hicksons—I thought Mrs. Hickson seemed rather cool—I dare say because her husband has the Review." On 4 August Cole mentioned "writing short notices for W. Review" and on 10 August "writing a notice of Goethe's theory of Colours which I sent to Hickson," so he did continue to help with the September issue. Indeed, there is evidence in the diary that Cole may have written as many as six or seven of the Critical and Miscellaneous Notices for that number. Cole worked in a flurry and gave up abruptly but other reasons for the break are not hard to find. Cole had pressed and cultivated shamelessly, but in the last analysis he was perhaps not temperamentally suited to the steady duties of editorship. He also had two other full time occupations with "Records" and "Postage" and his time was short. The suspicion lingers that Cole hoped the Westminster could be made profitable, whereas the reverse was true, and he was not in a position to assume prolonged underwriting. Finally, he was possibly more than a trifle impatient, a young man in a hurry, and the Westminster soon came to seem to him more of a roadblock than a vehicle for progress. Although Cole was an agreeable man some temporary coolness developed between him and Hickson as a result of this venture. Later entries in the diary refer to Hickson as "stiff," or speak disparagingly of him as a social companion. The diary records that Cole and Robertson gossiped about Hickson at the Reform Club occasionally for a time. At one point, 26 September, Cole records, "met Robertson there who said Hickson had not a spark of a notion of what gentlemanly feeling was." But eventually Cole and Robertson quarreled seriously, to the point of not speaking, and Robertson dropped from sight. Cole was basically an honorable man, caught up in this instance in a kind of youthful overconfidence, while Robertson was a man of little principle and integrity. Cole and Hickson repaired their relationship to the point that Cole contributed articles to the Westminster in 1841, 1842, 1843 and 1849, 14 and Hickson, when he drew up his will in 1862, left Cole "as a souvenir of the testator" all the French and German books in his library on industrial design. So the Westminster Review came to rest in the steady, if unimaginative control of Hickson, and only two questions remain to be asked: why, ultimately, did Mill choose Hickson, and what kind of man was he? When Mill finally faced the fact, early in 1840, that no merger was in sight, and that the review would have to pass either into private hands or into extinction, there were three men who appeared likely as successors. The choice was a difficult one, for to Mill this was not merely a business transaction; it also represented an emotional wrench with the past, and consideration of this caused his views to waver. The basic key to his decision was the relationship of the various men to early Utilitarianism, later simply to liberal thinking, and their willingness to maintain the Westminster as an organ of advanced thought in the future. Robertson, at 28, was the youngest and most unpredictable. His judgment was suspect. He had no money, but was dependent upon his pen for a living. Perhaps most damaging, he intended to use the review opportunistically to support the Whigs and possibly secure his own political advancement. Cole, 32, was only slightly older. He also had no money and was often forced to practice severe economies to provide for his growing family. He had, however, stronger ties to liberal thought through the Debating Society, and he had proved his ability with his work on Public Records and Penny Postage. Hickson, though perhaps less colorful, had the great advantage of independent wealth, a long record of service to liberal causes, plus a steady determination once he was committed to a project. Mill considered the Cole-Hickson team strong, but in Hickson alone he found a man of competence and dedication to radical causes. If he was somewhat short on editorial experience, this was the one thing he could acquire as he went. Born in 1803, Hickson was the son of a wealthy boot and shoe manufacturer. He was financially independent and able to devote himself with zeal to educational reform. His father, "Old William," had helped found several Lancastrian schools, and established a utopian community for his workers in Kent, emphasizing education for all, young and old. Young Hickson had a natural foundation for his interest. He early became involved in the innovative program, originated by John Turner, for teaching music and sight-reading to the poor, both as a means of civilizing them and to improve their moral character. 15 In 1835, he assisted his friend Edwin Chadwick in an inquiry into conditions of paupers "to secure information on the most improved methods of industrial training adopted for the children of paupers belonging to the industrial unions." 16 In 1839, he went abroad to study Dutch and German schools and published a lengthy report. By 1840, when the editorial negotiations were taking place, Hickson was serving on a commission to study and report on the appalling conditions endured by the unemployed Hand-loom Weavers, concluding that proper education afforded the solution to their problems. In addition to his established record of public service, Hickson had also been a steady and serviceable contributor without pay to the London and Westminster during Mill's editorship. He submitted five or six articles on municipal reform, taxes on newspapers and fallacies in the poor laws. Mill never forgot this generosity and when Hickson later was in trouble with the Review was always quick to contribute what he could. Writing to Sarah Austin in 1842, he observed about an article: It is the first fruits of my partial recovery from a three months illness, or rather out-of-health-ness, &amp; it at least helps to pay my debt to Hickson who used to write for the review without pay when I had it (II. 543). Hickson was thus well suited by experience and inclination to continue the Westminster as an organ for advanced thought. Mill had noted some years earlier: The Review ought to represent not radicalism but neoradicalism, a radicalism which is not democracy, not a bigotted adherence to any forms of government or to one kind of institution, &amp; which is only to be called radicalism inasmuch as it does not palter nor compromise with evils but cuts at their roots (I. 312). This was the course Hickson attempted to chart. Throughout the years of his editorship the Westminster Review championed formally, often combatively, such causes as reform of the law, abolition of taxes on knowledge, reform of the penal system and the poor laws, reform of sanitary and medical laws, and reform of metropolitan government. But first and foremost the review urged reform of education—proper education for pauper and factory children and improved education for the whole of England. When Hickson decided, in 1851, to part with the review, he could do so in the clear knowledge that he had observed the covenant. Mill wrote to him, 10 March 1851: I shall regret much if the review passes out of your hands into those of anyone who would have no object but to endeavour to make it profitable. It is the only organ through which really advanced opinions can get access to the public and it is very honorable to you that you have kept that organ in life and at work for ten years past and have made it so good a thing under difficult circumstances, as you have. 17 Hickson had kept the faith.</field>

The date for #278 should be 10 or 11 March, and for #279, Monday, 16 March. 7 George Fletcher, an occasional contributor to the Westminster Review . 8 Mineka, II, 420. Footnote #2 on the same page reads thus: "This was probably the proposal described in an unpublished letter (n.d., owned by Professor McCrimmon) from Cole to JSM: 'I had much talk with Hickson last night about the Review. He is most decidedly averse to Robertson's having the editorship . . . R. asked me whether I was willing to become sole proprietor—he remaining the Editor under certain conditions to be agreed upon between us . . . R. proposes to me . . . that I should have unconditional control of the Management or business part of the Review.'" 9 Mineka, II, 421. The dating of this letter is made difficult by the word "Thursday" at the top. 5 March was a Thursday and 12 March a Thursday, one too early and one too late. The better assumption would probably be 5 March. 10 Ibid. , 423, f.n. "Mrs. Towers [editor of a previous series of twenty-one letters of JSM to John Robertson] explains that Robertson had hoped to get into Parliament, 'and he would have used the Review, had he continued his editorship, to support the Whigs . . . Lord Normanby had had one interview, if not more, with Robertson with reference to this subject.'" 11 BM, Add. Ms. 34,621. Macvey Napier Papers, Vol. XI. 12 Packe, 247. "His [Mill's] attempt to keep Robertson's salary intact was defeated by the strict economy applied by Hickson. Giving his own labour as editor and author free, and dividing any profit there might be between the contributors in place of regular payments, Hickson reduced the cost." 13 Mineka, II, 422. This letter was probably written either 10 or 11 March—after the conference on the 10th between Mill and Cole and Hickson, and before Mill's letter of transferral on the 12th. This establishes the date of the next letter to Robertson, #279, as the following Monday, 16 March. 14 I am indebted to the Wellesley Index and Professor Walter E. Houghton, for authenticating these dates. 15 Hickson's book, The Singing Master , 1836, exerted a wide influence and established Hickson as one of the early pioneers of National Education. He continued his activities in this field with an address on 29 May 1838, to the powerful Sunday School Union titled Use of Singing as a Part of the Moral Discipline of Schools , later published as a pamphlet. 16 S.

      <field name="heading_text">Index and Author Guide to the Family Companion (1841-43) by Robert A. Rees and Marjorie Griffin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the twenty-five year period between 1825 and 1850 the number of magazines and journals in the United States increased from one hundred to six hundred. So great was the interest in magazines that the Illinois Monthly Magazine called this period the "golden age of periodicals." 1 But it was golden only if one looked at numbers; most magazines survived between six months and two years. 2 The New York Mirror described the reasons for the ephemeral existence of most periodicals: These United States are fertile in most things, but in periodicals they are extremely luxuriant. They spring up as fast as mushrooms, in every corner, and like all rapid vegetation, bear the seeds of early decay within them. . . . They put forth their young green leaves in the shape of promises and prospectuses — blossom through a few numbers — and then comes "a frost, a killing frost," in the form of bills due and debts unpaid. This is the fate of hundreds, but hundreds more are found to supply their place, to tread in their steps, and share their destiny. 3 This is an accurate, if general, description of the Family Companion and Ladies' Mirror , published in Macon, Georgia, between October 15, 1841, and February 15, 1843. Spurred by the challenge for the South to publish magazines competitive with those of the North, Benjamin F. Griffin and his wife, Sarah Lawrence Griffin, began their new magazine with solid planning and high hopes. Southern praise of the venture was as high as expected and the following from the Northern Brother Jonathan suggests the Companion enjoyed more than a regional reputation: "It appears to be gaining favor on all hands, East, West, North and South, and better still, to deserve it. It is beautifully printed — contains a very large amount of reading matter, is wholly original, and among its regular contributors, are some of the best living writers." 4 The most important of the "best living writers" spoken of by the Brother Jonathan were William Gilmore Simms and John Neal, both of whom helped guide the journal and contributed heavily to it. 5 Other contributors whose works regularly appeared in anthologies of the period or who are noted by literary historians were: William A. Caruthers, Emma C. Embury, Caroline Lee Hentz, George Frederick Holmes, Mirabeau Lamar, Mary E. Lee, Caroline Orne, Frances Osgood, Albert Pike, Mrs. L. H. Sigourney, William Tappan Thompson, and Samuel Woodworth. In his book on Early Georgia Magazines , Bertram Flanders makes the following estimate: "The Family Companion stands at the very top of Georgia ante-bellum monthlies, sharing honors with the Magnolia (Savannah) and the Orion (Penfield). Mrs. Sarah Lawrence Griffin, though not the best judge in the world of reading matter, in some way managed to get contributions that were among the best to be found in Southern periodicals." 6 A problem facing scholars wishing to examine the Companion is that its index, like others of the period, is by title only, is inaccurate, and is incomplete. The index following this introduction is expanded beyond mere rearrangement of the original by study of internal evidence and by study of letters from many of the Companion contributors to the Griffins. Some eighty of these letters are in the hands of descendants of the Griffins, and they clearly establish authorship of a number of works which, in the magazine, are anonymous or pseudonymous. The correspondence also makes clear that many of the anonymous items were supplied by Mrs. Griffin and by John Neal. We have refrained from any attribution based on assumption or analysis of style, and have supplied names only where the question seems beyond dispute. There are indirect identities such as "By the author of 'The Partisan,'" which leads unmistakably to William Gilmore Simms; in such a case the author's name is given here in brackets because it did not actually appear in the magazine. Other attributions were achieved in a more roundabout fashion but are equally valid. For instance, many items in the Companion are identified as "By the Author of 'The Ins and the Outs,'" a sketch appearing in the first issue of the Companion and identified in John Neal's letters as his own. The first of the "Poetry of Flowers" series is anonymous, but five others are credited to Clifton; on internal evidence we have credited the first one to Clifton also. "Clifton" and "Charles Clifton" are probably the same individual but evidence is lacking and we have listed the names separately. We have included in the author list such pseudonyms as "Arion," "Old File," "Somers," and others, rather than have a separate listing. Under "Anonymous" the titles are arranged alphabetically; works of known authors and the pseudonymous authors, however, appear chronologically. Because many of the authors are somewhat obscure and the titles are not always descriptive, we have added the terms article , fiction , and poem in square brackets; we have used the term sketch as a catch-all for whatever did not fit into the first three categories. Where the title provides a good indication, no category has been added. Pagination of the original volumes includes duplications and skips. We have given the numbers shown on the pages involved, with the indication "includes pagination error." In these cases, the reader must be alert for a break in sequence. Original spelling has not been changed. Punctuation has been normalized in a few cases to avoid distraction of the modern reader's eye. When a title in the original appears in all capital letters, it is impossible to know if the author or editor would have capitalized prepositions; in such a case we tend to modern usage. Irregularities such as "NO. I" in one issue and "No. 2" in the next have been altered to conform to the first appearance. In order to present a compact index readily consulted by scholars interested in magazine publication of the early 1840's, we have not introduced notes detailing exactly how each attribution was made. In several cases it is by internal evidence available to anyone who studies the magazine; in some cases it is available only in the as-yet-unpublished Griffin letters. Should a scholar in the field find an item of particular interest, the present authors would be happy to correspond on the subject.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Thoreau Rejects an Emerson Text by Wendell Glick</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All printings of the material Thoreau wrote for delivery at the Concord services for John Brown held December 2, 1859, the day Brown was hanged in Virginia, include Thoreau's translation of the eulogy to Agricola by Tacitus. 1 The printings which follow that of the Riverside (1883) allege also that Thoreau read the passage from Tacitus at the services, in English, in his own translation. In that edition, the second printing, Horace Scudder bracketed into the text, following Thoreau's statement of the appropriateness to the occasion of Raleigh's "The Soul's Errand," the following (p. 251): "[Mr. Thoreau then read these verses, as well as a number of poetical passages selected by another citizen of Concord, and closed with the following translation from Tacitus made by himself.]." But Scudder was in error. Thoreau had translated the Tacitus selection, to be sure, but he had not read his own translation at the services for John Brown. Nor did the source from which Scudder had printed his text of "After the Death of John Brown," as he named the selection, so state. Redpath in Echoes of Harper's Ferry (p. 444) has no bracketed statement between the texts of "The Soul's Errand," which was printed from the manuscript Thoreau had used at the services, and the selection from Tacitus, titled simply, "Tacitus.*" 2 In deleting the text of "The Soul's Errand" from the Riverside Edition, Scudder found it necessary to provide a transitional statement, which he concocted by amalgamating a previous sentence in Redpath (p. 442) which introduced poems read by Thoreau from Collins, Schiller, Tennyson and others with his own supposition that if Thoreau had done a translation of the eulogy to Agricola, and if he had read a translation of the eulogy at the Concord services, he must have read his own translation. It is difficult to imagine a more plausible supposition. But it was nonetheless wrong. In the Pierpont Morgan Library, under the number MA 884, is preserved all of the holograph matter used at the Brown services, as it was sent to James Redpath for its initial publication in Echoes of Harper's Ferry . Thoreau's personal observations on Brown, and the transcriptions of many poems, are in Thoreau's hand. But not the translation from Tacitus. It is written on alternate lines of a blue wove paper, quite unlike the white wove which Thoreau used for his transcriptions, and in the script of Emerson. And it is placed in the MS at the point where James Redpath printed what he labelled as Thoreau's own translation. A comparison of the first sentences of the Emerson version and that printed by Redpath reveals that the two versions differ sharply in tone and content. Emerson's version begins rather flatly: "You, Agricola, we may now congratulate." Thoreau's reads: "You, Agricola, are fortunate, not only because your life was glorious, but because your death was timely." 3 Why, the question arises, did Redpath, in printing the MS record of the event, depart from the Morgan text at this point? Franklin B. Sanborn, self-appointed editor of Thoreau and steward of Thoreau's reputation, supplies the answer. Though Thoreau's notations in MA 884 in ink and pencil, supplying the links between the different speakers and readers at the services, make it clear that Thoreau was the program director who supervised the John Brown commemoration, it was Sanborn who sent the record to Redpath and who shepherded the matter into print. With MA 884 is preserved a typescript of Sanborn's letter of transmittal for the final (presumably the second) consignment of papers from the meeting to go to Redpath. The letter (dated December 9, 1859) begins: "I send you the rest of the Papers read at the meeting here a week ago. When you get proofs of them, please let me correct them, and let them go in this order:" and Sanborn then lists eight items in the order in which they were subsequently printed by Redpath. One of the reasons, presumably, why Sanborn sent the material to Redpath in two or more consignments emerges in the second paragraph of the letter. Sanborn observes: "The passage from Tacitus read by Thoreau was so badly translated in Emerson's copy, that Thoreau has made a new one, to take its place." But the statement is significant for other reasons as well. Untrustworthy as Sanborn often is, it is enough to whet the curiosity of the scholar fascinated by the vicissitudes of the relationship between Emerson and his independent-minded junior neighbor. Did Thoreau, as director of the John Brown event, have the temerity to reject the older man's rendering of the Tacitus selection, which he had commissioned Emerson to do? Did he substitute his own translation with or without Emerson's consent in the printed record? Sanborn, of course, does not explicitly state that the translation tendered by Emerson for Thoreau to read was Emerson's own; he says only that the passage "was so badly translated in Emerson's copy, that Thoreau has made a new one, to take its place." And of course the translation's being in Emerson's hand does not prove, ipso facto , that Emerson did not copy it from some English version he had on his shelves. But the internal evidence from Emerson's holograph draft argues that Emerson not only wrote out the passage from Tacitus, but that he translated it also. Though the first three pages of the draft are fair copy, containing only one cancellation, the matter of the fourth page apparently gave Emerson considerable trouble. Six lines of the original version on p. 4 are heavily stricken in ink, and a new translation interlined; the sheet fairly obviously reflects Emerson's struggle to refine his text. Presumably he was not happy with his draft; indubitably Thoreau was not. With or without Emerson's concurrence, Thoreau struck Emerson's version from the record, substituting his own. The explanation as to why he did not read his own version of the Tacitus selection at the Brown services is that he had not yet prepared it. Perhaps it was in reading orally Emerson's translation that Thoreau discovered it lacked the vitality he felt the occasion demanded. Printer's copy for Thoreau's version has disappeared. It apparently was not returned by Redpath to Sanborn, along with the remainder of the papers, which Sanborn kept in his possession until deciding to sell them to the dealer C. E. Goodspeed in 1909. They were bought almost at once by the Morgan Library from Goodspeed as Goodspeed's letter of 27 January, 1909, preserved with the MS, testifies. But Thoreau's translation of Tacitus was not with them. The best conjecture is that Thoreau sent the manuscript of the translation directly to Redpath, rather than routing it through Sanborn, and that this accounts for Sanborn's never having had possession of the draft. The two translations follow in parallel columns, courtesy of the Morgan Library. The version at the left is that of Emerson read by Thoreau at the commemoration, which lacked, one can surmise that Thoreau believed, the sublimity which attached to the character of John Brown. The version at the right is Thoreau's translation as printed by Redpath in Echoes of Harper's Ferry , bearing the mark of Thoreau's conviction that Brown was among the most heroic men of the age.</field>

Thoreau's translation begins in Redpath on p. 444. I am indebted to the Morgan Library for permission to comment on MA 884, and to publish selected portions of the MS. You, Agricola, we may now congratulate. You are blessed, not only because your life was a career of glory, but because you were released when it was a happiness to die. You met your fate with calm serenity. We have lost a parent, and we suffer that it was not in our power to gaze upon you with earnest affection, and see your expiring glance. Your dying words would have been ever dear to us. Your commands we should have treasured, and graved them in our hearts. Few tears bedewed thy cold remains and, in the parting moment, your eyes looked up for other objects, — but they looked in vain, and closed forever. If, in another world, there is a pious mansion for the blessed; if, as the wisest men have thought, the soul is not extinguished with the body, — you shall enjoy a state of eternal felicity. From that station behold your disconsolate family. Exalt our minds from unavailing grief to the contemplation of your virtues. Those we must not lament: it were impiety to sully them with a tear. To cherish their memory, to embalm them with our praises, and, if our frail condition will permit, to emulate your bright example will be the truest mark of our respect, the best tribute your family can offer. By dwelling on your words and actions, they will have an illustrious character before their eyes, and, not content with the bare image of your mortal frame, they will have what is more valuable, the form and features of your mind. I do not mean to censure the custom of preserving in brass and marble the shape and stature of eminent men, but busts and statues, like their originals, are frail and perishable. The form of the soul is eternal, and we can retain and express that, not by a foreign material and art, but by our own virtues. All of Agricola that gained our love and raised our admiration, still subsists, and will ever subsist, preserved in the minds of men, the register of ages, and the records of fame. You, Agricola, are fortunate, not only because your life was glorious, but because your death was timely. As they tell us who heard your last words, unchanged and willing you accepted your fate; as if, as far as in your power, you would make the emperor appear innocent. But, besides the bitterness of having lost a parent, it adds to our grief, that it was not permitted us to minister to your health, . . . to gaze on your countenance, and receive your last embrace; surely, we might have caught some words and commands which we could have treasured in the inmost part of our souls. This is our pain, this our wound . . . . You were buried with the fewer tears, and in your last earthly light, your eyes looked around for something which they did not see. If there is any abode for the spirits of the pious; if, as wise men suppose, great souls are not extinguished with the body, may you rest placidly, and call your family from weak regrets, and womanly laments, to the contemplation of your virtues, which must not be lamented, either silently or aloud. Let us honor you by our admiration, rather than by short-lived praises, and, if nature aid us, by our emulation of you. That is true honor, that the piety of whoever is most akin to you. This also I would teach your family, so to venerate your memory, as to call to mind all your actions and words, and embrace your character and the form of your soul, rather than of your body; not because I think that statues which are made of marble or brass are to be condemned, but as the features of men, so images of the features, are frail and perishable. The form of the soul is eternal; and this we can retain and express, not by a foreign material and art, but by our own lives. Whatever of Agricola we have loved, whatever we have admired, remains, and will remain, in the minds of men, and the records of history, through the eternity of ages. For oblivion will overtake many of the ancients, as if they were inglorious and ignoble: Agricola, described and transmitted to posterity, will survive.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Gilbert and His Ballads: Problems in the Bibliography and Attribution of Victorian Comic Journalism by John Bush Jones</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During the past decade there has been renewed scholarly interest in the popular culture and literature of nineteenth-century England, including — seemingly for the first time — serious attention to Victorian theatre and popular magazines. Much in evidence among these studies is a small but generally perceptive and carefully executed body of essays and books on W. S. Gilbert and the Gilbert and Sullivan operas — perceptive and carefully executed, that is, as long as the works confine their interest to criticism, biography, and literary and theatrical history. On the other hand, the scholarship seemingly relaxes its standards for scrupulous accuracy, sound theory, and consistent methodology in matters relating to the bibliography and attribution of Gilbert's texts. Mr. James Ellis' "The Unsung W. S. Gilbert" ( Harvard Library Bulletin , 18 [1970], 109-140) forms a useful example. It is, as a critical and historical discussion, an insightful and useful introduction to the Gilbert of the Bab Ballads, yet its bibliographical and textual studies need some correction, containing as they do various factual errors and questionable theories. Of more general interest are the stated or tacit approaches to bibliography, attribution, and textual problems that have implications reaching beyond the treatment of a single author and into the whole emerging field of the serious study of nineteenth-century periodical literature. The problem of fixing the publication date for a book with an undated title-page is seen in the assignment of 1873 to the first Routledge edition of More "Bab" Ballads (pp. 109 and 110, n. 2), the source for this date presumably Townley Searle's bibliography, Reginald Allen's checklist, 1 or the published catalogue of the British Museum. The dubious authority of such secondary materials in matters of dating is demonstrated by the observation that two other generally reliable catalogues, those of the Newberry Library and the Library of Congress, give the date of this book as 1872. The chief problem in accepting evidence from these catalogues, checklists, and bibliographies without further authentication is the absence from them of discussions on how each conjectural date was determined. In the case of More "Bab" Ballads , it is likely that 1873 became popularly established as the publication date through the appearance of reviews in that year. Reviews are, at best, a kind of secondary evidence for questions of dating. As in all matters bibliographical, the chief source of information on dating should be the physical book itself, but if, as in the present case, no clues to the publication date can be found in the physical make-up or text of the book, the collateral evidence of documents pertaining to the printing and publishing of it may be brought to bear on the problem. For More "Bab" Ballads this kind of evidence exists in the form of a contract between Routledge and Gilbert dated 18 May 1872, agreeing that an edition of two thousand copies of the book will be published in 1872, presumably in time for the Christmas-gift market. 2 This dating is corroborated by the admittedly secondary yet still contemporary evidence of advertisements and entries in the "Publications of the Week" column of the Spectator and in the English Catalogue which fix the latest possible date for the publication of More "Bab" Ballads at 26 October 1872. 3 Misstatements about the texts occur at three points, the first two having to do with the same poem, "The Advent of Spring," the earliest verse positively attributable to Gilbert. A footnote states that Punch reprinted this poem "with the title 'Sing for the Garish Eye'" (p. 111, n. 8). In fact, when Punch published it (albeit in a version somewhat altered from Gilbert's original verse), it was printed without a title, beginning only with a new first line "Sing for the garish eye," the "S" being a large illustrated initial capital. Similarly, "The Advent of Spring" appears in Mr. Ellis' essay with its original text but without Gilbert's comic by-line "By a Devout Admirer of Mr. T------n," an omission which seriously impairs a full understanding of the poem. It is quite correct to describe the piece as Gilbert's "only attempt at sustained nonsense writing," 4 but the poem is more than that. The omitted by-line taken together with the character of the nonce words and syntax in the text demonstrates that this verse is Gilbert's deliberate parody of early Tennyson, whose most salient poetic feature was a plethora of archaic and obscure words and word-forms. 5 The third has mostly to do with the nature of the material contained in one of Gilbert's magazine contributions and his source for that poem. The author maintains that "an article in the Marseilles Publicité on 'la grève des célibataires' forms the basis of one poem ('The Bachelors' Strike')" (p. 117). The text of this poem as it appears in Fun begins with the following prose quotation enclosed in quotation marks as it is here: "A Warning to Ladies.—The Publicite [sic] of Marseilles announces a new kind of strike—that of bachelors. Not fewer than 6,000 young men, it states, of that place, between the age of 20 and 30, held a meeting in the open air a little way out of the town, and entered into an agreement not to ask any young woman in marriage until a complete change shall have been operated in the manner of living, and particularly in the dress, of the fairer sex. The young men insist on greater simplicity in every respect, and a return to the more modest habits of a century or two ago." ( Fun , 22 July 1865, p. 99) Gilbert lifted this head-note to his poem verbatim and in toto from page 10 of the Times for 10 July 1865. The appearance of this paragraph along with the verse suggests that it and not the French original was Gilbert's source. In his edition of Gilbert's poems Mr. Ellis quotes the French original, but he attributes the Times paragraph to Gilbert as his "note of explanation" to the verse (pp. 317-318). In the area of enumerative bibliography, at several points the essay mentions the number of poems Gilbert contributed to Fun during stated periods of time; twice these figures are incorrect (pp. 117 and 123). It is stated that "Gilbert definitely contributed twenty-three" poems to the New Series up to May 1866, whereas a count of his verse contributions to that date—even excluding dramatic burlesques wholly or partially in verse—shows the number to be thirty. 6 The number twenty-three corresponds to the number of poems from this period which Mr. Ellis includes in his edition of "all of Gilbert's poems," (p. 4) combining two individually printed verse contributions under one title and excluding altogether six other verses as "some brief macaronics which he [Gilbert] describes as French translations of poems by Thomas Moore, and a few bits of unworthy doggerel." 7 Again in the essay it is observed that "only five of Gilbert's poems" appeared in Fun "in the twelve months following Archy's story" (June 1866 through May 1867); there are, however, seven. 8 The footnote citing "To My Absent Husband" as the only poem of Gilbert's in Punch (p. 119, n. 12) reveals another instance of the untested authority of secondary evidence. The note tacitly approves the popular misconception that no records exist to identify the anonymous pieces published in Punch during the nineteenth century. In fact, the contributors' ledgers for every year from 1848 forward are extant and housed in the library of Punch Publications, Ltd. The ledger for 1865 discloses that on 21 October of that year Punch printed "The Return," an unillustrated poem by Gilbert exploiting the same subject matter as "Back Again!" which he had published in Fun two weeks earlier. 9 The ledger also corroborates the identification of "To My Absent Husband" as Gilbert's, an attribution which otherwise could only be conjectural, based as it is on the attendant drawing signed "Bab." The Punch problem falls between purely bibliographical matters and questions of attribution and evidence. Similarly, to say of Gilbert that "Down to the Derby" (28 May 1864) is "the last of his poems in the old series of Fun " (p. 113) contradicts the remark that after June 1864 "he presumably wrote more in the old series" (p. 117). The latter statement is a well-considered and plausible conjecture, although the absence of such external evidence as the Proprietor's Copy provides for the New Series precludes positive identification of Gilbert's contributions. The former assertion, however, that a given poem was Gilbert's "last" in the "old series" skirts the entire complex matter of identifying any of Gilbert's "old series" work without the aid of documentary evidence. 10 It would be more accurate to offer "Down to the Derby" as the last of those poems in the "old series" of Fun which may be even tentatively attributed to Gilbert on the tangential evidence of the accompanying illustration signed "W. S. G." 11 Such occurrences of signed artwork—"closely related, initialed drawings known to be his" 12 —furnish the author his only evidence for ascribing five poems from the "old series" of Fun to Gilbert. Yet one of his footnotes wisely cautions against automatically attributing to Gilbert every item attached to a "W. S. G."—signed illustration, justly citing Gilbert's disclaimer of "The Lie of a Lifetime" in support of this caveat. 13 The grotesque caricatures of Napoleon III which accompany "The Lie," however, as well as the graceful young lady who adorns Tom Hood's "Croquet: An Anticipation," 14 are as closely related to the texts of their respective poems as are the illustrations upon which the attributions put forth in the essay are grounded. These drawings are more faithful in detail to the accompanying texts than the invariably toothy representations of the Baron which jar with his description as "a tyrant, a Tartar, a toothless and tough 'un" in the First Fytte of "The Baron Klopfzetterheim," a poem which the essay assigns to Gilbert with no reservations. 15 The one surviving piece of external evidence regarding a verse printed with "W. S. G."—signed illustrations (the letter on "The Lie") argues against Gilbert's authorship. This should not imply the equally extreme position that the presence of a drawing signed "W. S. G." denies to Gilbert any poetry or prose it accompanies. Rather, it should suggest that, since the only external evidence relates a series of such drawings to the verse of another contributor to Fun , Gilbert's practice as an illustrator of texts not his own is documented, thereby raising at least a reasonable doubt as to the authorship of verse or prose found in conjunction with drawings signed "W. S. G." Hence, the absence of external evidence should preclude admission into the canon of the five "old series" poems so illustrated and signed. Indeed, the footnote on "The Lie" argues convincingly for the exclusion of these five poems, whereas the text proper offers no valid justifications for their place among Gilbert's verse writings. Before directly analyzing further the problems of attribution, some explanation seems desirable for the above insistence on the need for external evidence in identifying Gilbert's, or for that matter any Victorian journalist's, anonymously published magazine contributions. The case for the superior value of external evidence and the pitfalls of casually treating internal evidence in an area as seemingly remote from the present concern as Tudor and Stuart drama has been stated in a now near-classic essay by S. Schoenbaum, 16 which transcends most considerations of period and genre. The conditions of the Victorian comic paper were such as to create what amounts to a species of mass-produced literature (this view is not meant to denigrate artists who triumphed over the strictures imposed by production schedules); and this mass-production was at least one of the causes responsible for phenomena with which the student of authorship must work. Briefly, when numerous comic journalists (many of them hacks) were busily cranking out countless pieces for openly commercial—and, hence, not altogether "respectable"—enterprises, the net result for attribution studies is the high percentage of similar styles (or lack thereof) among the authors and the equally high percentage of anonymous publication. The investigator of authorship is thus faced with a vast quantity of markedly similar unsigned work. Professor Schoenbaum's dictum of "no style, no stylistic evidence" (p. 109) has as much validity in assigning authors to Victorian comic periodical verse as Elizabethan drama. Or, perhaps his advice to "beware . . . the formulas of style and expression that are the common currency of an age" (p. 119) is here more to the point. To read through issues of Punch, Fun , or other humorous weeklies of the 1860's is to discover an almost overwhelming, flat similarity of style and tone, not only in the verse and prose, but in the engravings as well. Perhaps this flatness, often characterized in prose by prolixity and in verse by tortured wrenching of syntax to achieve rhyme, is an absence of style, but taken altogether it could be considered a recognizable style of its own—the overall style of mid-Victorian comic journalism, but not to be associated with any specific writers in particular. And much of Gilbert's output in the mid-sixties is no different from, no better than, the rest. 17 The most eloquent testimony to the dangers of relying on stylistic evidence to identify Gilbert's anonymously published verse is the work of Townley Searle and John Malcom Bulloch in the 1930's. In his Lost Bab Ballads (1932), Searle wrongly included four poems, not counting others of dubious authorship. His brief introduction does not discuss methodology and omits mention of the criteria by which he admitted unsigned poems into the collection. It is fairly evident, however, that the "Bab"-signed drawing for "Croquet: An Anticipation" led him to include that poem, while Searle's own intuition of some "Gilbertian" style in the drawing and text of the unsigned "Jopkins's Ghost: An Irregular Ballad" ( Fun , 17 August 1867) and "King Archibald Naso" ( Fun , 2 May 1868), and in the text alone of the unillustrated "Crinoline on the Ice" ( Fun ["old series"], 16 January 1864) must have been responsible for their temporary intrusion into the canon. 18 Similarly, Bulloch's alphabetical list of Gilbert's poems includes forty-three verses which Gilbert did not reprint in his own published collections. Just under half of these had previously been discovered by Dark and Grey, Goldberg, and Searle, and most of them are correct attributions; Bulloch, however, lists twenty-five additional poems (admitting his indebtedness to Searle in locating them), of which six are from the New Series of Fun . The Proprietor's Copy shows that five of these are not by Gilbert, and while the sixth is, it is not a verse at all but an illustrated prose piece. 19 The remainder of Bulloch's new attributions are from the "old series" of Fun and The Comic News , papers for which no contributors' ledgers have yet been located, thus leaving his accuracy in doubt. His poor record, however, with the New Series of Fun raises sufficient question as to the validity of his method, one which apparently relied heavily on internal stylistic evidence. The chief fault with the approach of Searle and Bulloch is summed up by Professor Schoenbaum's point that " intuitions, convictions , and subjective judgments generally, carry no weight as evidence" (p. 112). Returning to Mr. Ellis' article, one could suggest that the five "old series" poems have been admitted into the Gilbert canon not by internal evidence at all, but on the basis of the "W. S. G." signatures to the illustrations, which might be taken as analogous to the author's name on the page or in the table of contents or index to the periodical. And yet, the facts of "The Lie" and "Croquet" demonstrate that an illustration and a text must be treated as separate entities, and that the signature to one cannot necessarily be taken to apply to the other. 20 The essay contains direct application of stylistic evidence in dealing with "The Cattle Show" in The Comic News , although this attribution is cautiously qualified with words like "perhaps" and "probably." 21 The process begins with the observation that the poem has the same title and subject as a verse in the 12 December 1863 issue of Fun , a piece earlier ascribed to Gilbert on the strength of a "W. S. G."—signed drawing. This method of attribution by means of comparing things greater than direct verbal parallels—here, specifically, content—Professor Schoenbaum calls "the larger correspondences of thought and theme" and again he points out that such matters are as common to a period or genre as to an individual author (p. 117). Vogues for apt subjects are observable in the London comic weeklies of the 1860's; some, such as lampoons on Napoleon III and jokes about chignons or crinolines, appear in bunches as the object of the humor is currently topical; others, such as pieces on Derby Day, the Christmas Pantomimes, and the Cattle Show, are cyclical and come in waves as the annual events come around. That the Cattle Show was a favorite target for humorous treatment by the comic papers and other popular journals is documented by the fact that the December issues of Fun, Punch , and London Society for 1861 through 1865 contain no fewer than twenty-two poems, prose pieces, and engravings concerning the event, nine of which use "the Cattle Show" as a part or the whole of their title. Nor is it proof of mutual authorship that in 1863 the alleged Gilbert "Cattle Show" in Fun preceded by only a week the piece of the same name in The Comic News . Without further documentary evidence these events can be taken only as an example of the popularity of the topic and, perhaps, as the conscious imitation of one journal by another; H. J. Byron was the editor of both, and he may have been trying to make as much as possible of a proven annual subject for humor. There is no direct evidence to support the contention that this is an example of Gilbert's known economical re-use of material. A demonstrable instance of this practice was noted earlier with regard to the similar poems on returning from the continent which were published two weeks apart in Punch and Fun . But this observation of a particular case of one of Gilbert's life-long habits of composition could not be made until the two poems were shown to be his through the agency of documents external to the texts. This illustrates Professor Schoenbaum's principle that "internal evidence can only support hypotheses or corroborate external evidence" (p. 105). The last step in the attribution of the second "Cattle Show" poem employs the device of comparing stanzaic forms. It is noted that the same stanza is used in "Down to the Derby" (another poem identified only by the "W. S. G." illustration), although Mr. Ellis is careful to point out that the stanza was not peculiarly Gilbert's—a frank admission of the weakness of metrics as evidence (pp. 113 and 113, n. 10). Given the desirability of physical data in bibliographical investigations and the validity of Professor Schoenbaum's arguments for external evidence in attribution problems, the specific difficulties in the study of Gilbert's journalistic verse may be seen as part of larger weaknesses in the overall approach to the subject: a neglect of factual information, the treatment of tentative and conjectural possibilities as proven certainties, and the lack of a consistent and workable method fit for the problems and materials involved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Townley Searle, Sir William Schwenck Gilbert (1931), and Reginald Allen, W. S. Gilbert : An Anniversary Survey and Exhibition Checklist (1963). 2 This contract is preserved in the archives of the publishers Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, Ltd., in their offices at 68-74 Carter Lane, London. The sense in which "publication" and "publish" are used here is the precise bibliographical definition referring to the date on which a book is first offered for public sale. This standard definition is given its fullest presentation in Fredson Bowers, Principles of Bibliographical Description (1949) pp. 374-376. The evidence of additional contracts, letters, advertisements, and publication notices shows that The "Bab" Ballads published by John Camden Hotten and dated 1869 on the title-page was in the bookshops by 19 December 1868, and Fifty "Bab" Ballads (Routledge) with its printed date of 1877 was on sale officially by 16 December 1876. Accepting the precise bibliographical definition of publication forces the dating of The "Bab" Ballads as 1868 and Fifty "Bab" Ballads as 1876, despite their imprints. Only expedience and a wish for consistency with the title-page dates can justify continued reference to publication in 1869 and 1877 respectively. The British Museum catalogue notation " The 'Bab' Ballads , . . . . , 1869 [1868]" seems most desirable because most fully descriptive of the bibliographical facts. 3 On 111, the final issue of the so-called "old series" of Fun edited by H. J. Byron is also misdated. The date is given as 20 May 1865, whereas the last number produced under Byron's editorship was that for the previous week dated 13 May. The 20 May issue inaugurated the New Series with a large notice to that effect. Unfortunately the Proprietor's Copy of Fun is wanting that first number of the New Series, ruling out the possibility of positively identifying in it any contributions by Gilbert. 4 Ellis, 111. In Mr. Ellis' edition of Gilbert's poems, The Bab Ballads by W. S. Gilbert (1970), as in the article, the comic by-line is not printed along with the text of the poem, but only recorded in a note (p. 313). (Future reference to this book will be made as "Ellis Edition" to distinguish it from the essay.) 5 For a full discussion of the poem as parody, with quotations from Tennyson, see John Bush Jones, "The Uncollected Verse of W. S. Gilbert: A Critical Edition," Diss. Northwestern University 1970, pp. 220-222; hereafter cited as "Jones Diss." 6 The poems in chronological order are "Ne T'en Va Pas," "Something Like Nonsense Verses," "Ode to My Clothes," "In Re Dawkins," "Garryowen," "Something Like Nonsense Verses No. II," "The Student," "Tempora Mutantur," "The Bachelors' Strike," "Good-Bye, Sweet-Heart, Good-Bye," "A Bad Night of It," "A Good Joke: To (Say) Phoebe," "Ozone," "To the Terrestrial Globe," "The Monkey in Trouble," "Back Again!" "An Impromptu: To Mademoiselle Lucca," "Musings in a Music Hall," "Pantomimic Presentiments," "The Bar and Its Moaning," "'I Do Adore Thee!'" "To Euphrosyne," "The Phantom Curate," "To a Little Maid," "Ferdinando and Elvira," "The Pantomime 'Super' to His Mask," "The Yarn of the Nancy Bell [sic]," "Monsieur le Blond on London," "Haunted," and "The Reverend Rawston Wright." The dates and pages of Fun containing these verses will be found in John Bush Jones, "W. S. Gilbert's Contributions to Fun , 1865-1874," Bulletin of the New York Public Library , 73 (1969), 257-259; hereafter to be cited as "Jones." 7 Ellis Edition, p. 13, n. 24. "Something Like Nonsense Verses" and "Something Like Nonsense Verses No. II" are combined as a single poem under the former title; the verses excluded from the edition are "Ne T'en Va Pas," "In Re Dawkins," "Garryowen," "Good-Bye, Sweet-Heart, Good-Bye," "An Impromptu: To Mademoiselle Lucca," and "'I Do Adore Thee!'" 8 The poems are "To My Bride," "Only a Dancing Girl," "To My Steed," "A New Ballad: Upon the Shore," "King Borria Bungalee Boo," "Jack Casts His Shell," and "How to Write an Irish Drama." See Jones, 259-260. Of these verses, only "A New Ballad: Upon the Shore" is omitted from Mr. Ellis' edition. That in this period Gilbert contributed to Fun only seven verses and the fourteen installments of "Men We Meet" should not suggest that he was reducing his activities as a comic journalist; his total output for Fun alone during this twelvemonth was fifty-nine items. 9 For a full discussion and the reprinting of "The Return" see John Bush Jones, "Bab and Punch : Gilbert's Contributions Identified," forthcoming in Gilbert and Sullivan , papers from the International Conference on Gilbert and Sullivan, May 1970, to be published in the University of Kansas Libraries Series. 10 This is not meant to include "The Advent of Spring," the attribution of which Mr. Ellis delineates precisely and thoroughly on 111. 11 It may be better to say that no attribution can be made at this time because of insufficient evidence. 12 Ellis, 112. The two "old series" "W. S. G."-illustrated poems not mentioned in the essay are "Sixty-Three and Sixty-Four" (2 January 1864) and "The Dream" (27 February 1864). Both are included in Mr. Ellis' edition of Gilbert's verse. 13 Ellis, 112, n. 9. A portion of Gilbert's letter containing this denial of authorship is quoted as "the absurd verses were not written by me." Phrased in this manner, however, the extract requires an ellipsis indicated, as the full remark is "the absurd verses on Napoleon III, published in an early number of 'Fun' were not written by me." Als. dated 29 January 1885 from Gilbert to E. Bruce Hindle, quoted by permission of the Trustees of the Pierpont Morgan Library and the Royal General Theatrical Fund Association, the owner of the subsisting copyright of the unpublished letters of Sir William Gilbert. In both his essay and his edition, Mr. Ellis refers to the recipient of this letter only as a "correspondent" (Ellis, 112, n. 9, and 139; Ellis Edition, p. 7). Hindle did have some correspondence with Gilbert, but this letter is Gilbert's formal written reply to Hindle's long review article "W. S. Gilbert, Playwright and Humorist" in the January 1885 Manchester Quarterly . Gilbert's disavowal of "The Lie of a Lifetime" is not an off-hand answer to a correspondent's query of authorship, but his ultimate defense against a critic who said the poem was "turgid, uneasy, pretentious; the lines often limp sadly; and altogether the performance, though intended for poetry, could scarcely be so called, and did not contain much promise" (Hindle, 59). For further consideration and an additional interpretation of Gilbert's letter to Hindle, see Jones Diss., pp. 195-196. 14 Fun , 4 May 1867, p. 77; this drawing is signed "Bab" and shows Gilbert to be an occasional illustrator of other men's verse even when the illustrated Bab Ballads were beginning to appear in Fun . Searle wrongly took this drawing as evidence of Gilbert's authorship and included the poem in his Lost Bab Ballads . The Proprietor's Copy contains the needed external evidence for the correct attribution of both the drawing and the text. 15 On 113, "The Baron" is referred to matter-of-factly as "the longest, most abundantly illustrated of Gilbert's poems." The quoted line occurs in Ellis, 114; the Baron, replete with teeth, may be seen there and on the preceding page. 16 S. Schoenbaum, "Internal Evidence and the Attribution of Elizabethan Plays," Bulletin of the New York Public Library , 65 (1961), 102-124. 17 Reference is made here to all his work —prose, verse, dramatic parody, and illustration—in the New Series of Fun in 1865 and 1866, positively identified in the Proprietor's Copy; for the full list, see Jones, 257-260. 18 The Proprietor's Copy identifies Tom Hood as the author of "Jopkins's Ghost," with illustration by Alfred Thompson; the writer and artist of "King Archibald Naso" are, respectively, Clement Scott and one Wells. Because "Crinoline on the Ice" appears in the "old series," its author cannot as yet be identified. 19 Sidney Dark and Rowland Grey, W. S. Gilbert : His Life and Letters (1923), reprint seven verses Gilbert did not collect; Isaac Goldberg, The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan (1928), reprints an additional eleven. Bulloch committed his errors in "The Bab Ballads by Titles," N&amp;Q , 172 (22 May 1937), 362-367. 20 There are additional documented instances of Gilbert's illustrating prose by other contributors to both Fun and Punch . 21 Ellis, 112-113. The fact that Gilbert's name appears in a list of contributors to The Comic News lends no particular strength to any of these arguments. It only shows that one or more pieces by Gilbert are somewhere buried anonymously in the single volume of this short-lived periodical.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Mather's Melville Book by George Monteiro</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The appearance in 1929 of Lewis Mumford's Herman Melville gave Frank Jewett Mather, Jr. (1868-1953) an opportunity to recall his own early efforts on Melville's behalf. Before turning to the book at hand, he recalled how "a Melvillian and Melville himself were outsiders twenty-five years ago": I sought Herman Melville's daughter, Elizabeth, who was living in the old Florence amid her father's books and pictures. She talked of him with constraint, but was interested in my quest, giving me the two privately printed pamphlets of poems, which completed my first editions, and letting me read casually from that japanned tin cakebox which contained Melville's letters and unpublished manuscripts. Thus I took a few notes from the diaries of travels, sampled "Billy Budd," and the last poems. Miss Melville generously promised me the use of all the papers except Melville's letters to his wife. In high hopes I wrote to the American publishers whose list is heaviest with our classics, and proposed a modest biography in one volume. The answer was friendly but decisive: Herman Melville was a hopelessly bad risk and one that no prudent publisher could undertake even to the extent of a few hundred dollars. 1 Although Mather never did reveal the identity of his "prudent publisher," it has long been speculated that it was the Boston publisher, Houghton, Mifflin and Company. The contents of a hitherto unpublished letter dictated and signed by Ferris Greenslet, then at the beginning of an illustrious career as a Houghton Mifflin editor, confirms that identification. November 20, 1906 Dear Mr. Mather, I turned your letter of November 16th over to the proper authorities in Houghton, Mifflin and Company. I am sorry to have to report to you that after having given it the most serious and sympathetic consideration they report that they do not feel very sanguine over the possibility of making a publishing success of the life of Melville, interesting as is his personality and admirable as is his work. It chances that they have lately been considering a similar proposal from another writer and after a thorough survey of the field have been compelled to decide in both instances that the interest of the American reading public in Melville is scarcely sufficient to warrant them in undertaking a biography. They are of the opinion that interest in Melville is more widely spread in England than in this country, and that very likely an English publisher would be glad to understake the publication of your proposed book. In that case they would be glad to make arrangements, if possible, to import a moderate edition of the work in sheets for sale in this country. Speaking for the Atlantic, I should say that we might be able to use to advantage one good critical and appreciative paper on Melville, or possibly two papers based upon fresh manuscript material, provided it should prove to have sufficient zest. Speaking for the Department of Limited Editions, I am not very sure that an anthology of the unpublished verse of a not very popular author would be very successfull, but it would be a pleasure to have the opportunity of considering it. I am particularly sorry that the reply has to be so lukewarm on nearly all points of your letter. I beg you to believe that the decision as to the business aspect of the case has been made with very great reluctance in view of our recognition of the admirable character of the book you would undoubtedly do. Believe me, with best wishes, Sincerely yours, Ferris Greenslet Frank Jewett Mather, Esq. 2 Apparently this letter put an end to Mather's efforts, for after it, there was nothing forthcoming, not even the essay or two for the Atlantic Monthly that Greenslet had himself encouraged.</field>
