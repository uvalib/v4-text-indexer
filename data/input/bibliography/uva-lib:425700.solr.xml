      <field name="heading_text">Proofreading Lockhart's Scott : The Dynamics of Biographical Reticence by Francis Russell Hart</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Caricatures of Victorianism, mercifully defunct in more sharply defined areas of literary history, survive in chronicles of biography. Sir Harold Nicolson's sketch was drawn in the anti-Victorian ether of a long generation ago: "then came earnestness, and with earnestness hagiography descended on us with its sullen cloud." It was redrawn recently by Professor Garraty, who wrote of the year Victoria became queen, "Already the fiery reformist spirit of romanticism was degenerating into the smug moral earnestness of the era that bears her name. . . . John Lockhart's Life of Sir Walter Scott . . . provided a foretaste of what was to come." 1 Now, the ascription to Lockhart of a culpable reticence would have seemed strange indeed to contemporary readers; to them, the work seemed painfully candid. However, the purpose of this essay is not to challenge the ascription. Rather, it is to depict the processes of composition and revision through which a degree of reticence evolved. The depiction is made possible by the survival of Lockhart's corrected proofsheets. 2 The proof-sheets show Lockhart at work; but more than that, when considered in conjunction with pertinent correspondence in the National Library of Scotland, they allow us to detect the presence of significant influences on that work in its final stages of preparation. Ultimately, my thesis will be that Lockhart's procedures cannot be properly understood without reference to those influences, to the conditions imposed by his own ideas of biographical form and style and by his inevitable dependence on the world of Scott's surviving contemporaries. The proofsheets offer noteworthy evidence in support of such a view. But it will be best to begin with their more obvious implications. During the past thirty years, authoritative editions of Lockhart's major documents — specifically, Scott's letters and diary—have revealed much about Lockhart's editorial attitudes toward his raw materials, and, incidentally, about his considerable skill as a compiler. 3 The proofsheets corroborate and illustrate what has been revealed. His "unscientific" habits of "manipulating" 4 documents and anecdotes have been the subject of many a modern preachment. These habits, however reprehensible by modern editorial standards, were neither careless nor irresponsible, as should be clear to anyone who studies his fastidious structural workmanship. Obviously, Lockhart assumed that the responsibilities of the editor/biographer necessarily implied the freedom to excerpt, edit, and integrate his materials as form and emphasis required. Clearly indicative of that assumption is the scissors-and-paste process of compilation he used. He had before him a transcript of Scott's journal "from which I might when I chose clip out a fragment to stick into my page as I went on." 5 Contributors aided by responding to requests for Scott letters with transcripts "each on a separate sheet &amp; no writing on the off pages." 6 Suppliers of reminiscences and anecdotes understood that their contributions, too, were simply raw materials for Lockhart to adapt as and where he saw fit. Sending his memoranda, James Ballantyne assumed Lockhart would "desire to have no more than the mere materials, and indeed I hardly expect to be able to put them into shape; but this is to bring no disparagement on my taste, for I shall give you them all unboulted." 7 The "boulting" of raw materials continued even on the margins of the proofsheets, and so did the carrying out of the precept best expressed in a letter to Lockhart from Scott's friend Morritt of Rokeby: "nor would I print for another what he would not have printed himself." 8 Evident at once is Lockhart's practice of correcting quotations and foreign expressions in Scott's letters and journals. One discovers such marginal requests as the following: "To Mr C[adell]. get some good latinist to see that this page is quite right—Archdeacon Williams E.g." (II, 184). If the request is to "be sure as to the Gaelic" (II, 315), the response is in a hand I assume to be that of "T.T.," Scott's friend Thomas Thomson, "first legal antiquary of our time in Scotland." Realizing Scott has unconsciously quoted Burns, Lockhart sets off the line as verse and corrects it from Scott's "when life draws near the closing" to the original, "When ance Life's day draws near the gloamin" (V, 230). When Scott misquotes II Henry IV II.3—"the old bore feeds in the old park"—Lockhart corrects it (VI, 80-81). Other letters and diary excerpts show, in proof, occasional clarifications of diction and syntax of the kinds already familiar to anyone who has collated Lockhart's versions with the originals. The most significant of Lockhart's habits as manipulator is the practice of amalgamating extracts from separate letters, or from journal entries, into what appear to be single texts. Modern scholars are understandably outraged by the practice; but it can be demonstrated that such "contamination" was, for Lockhart, merely an effective means of simplifying and clarifying the structure of his compilation. It allowed him to satisfy the contemporary demand for ungarbled originals—"in publishing letters," wrote one editor, "the epistolary form and manner must be preserved" 9 —and at the same time to eliminate irrelevant or repetitious portions of documents otherwise valuable. Two good examples may be given from the proofsheets. The portion of narrative (with letters) relating to Joanna Baillie's The Family Legend seemed long and repetitious; the proofsheets show what was done about it. They contain a long letter of January 30, 1810, and parts of two others (January 31 and February 6) which, essentially, were continuations. 10 In order to condense, Lockhart crossed out the bulk of the other two letters and left two separate passages, above the first of which he wrote "P.S." The published result is a single letter with a coherent and relevant postscript (II, 260-267). The other instance involves three letters from Scott to James Ballantyne. 11 Whatever the Ballantyne partisans might have found blameworthy in Lockhart's excisions, it is significant that all three letters survived until the proofsheet stage. Then, apparently with nothing more than the desire to reduce the number of documents and eliminate irrelevancies, Lockhart made careful cuts. As a result, the three letters (with openings and closings removed) became one coherent whole (VI, 324-325). Thus did Lockhart retain the documentary directness of the biographical compilation and at the same time function successfully as a selective structural artist. The method must be understood as an artistic device, and not as an editorial sin. For the most part, such excisions and revisions had been made before the work reached proof. In the area of Lockhart's textual emendations, however, the proofsheets do have one important contribution to make to Scott scholarship. Over two hundred of the Scott letters printed in the twelve-volume Centenary Edition are, owing to the failure to recover manuscripts, given in Lockhart's published versions. Some of these received editorial attention in Lockhart's proofsheets. Now, whatever changes may have been made before the letters reached the proofsheet stage, it seems safe to assume that the proofsheet versions are at least closer to the missing originals than the versions eventually published. Specific examples will be given later; but to mention one prominent instance, the proofsheets show considerable editing of Scott's otherwise unrecovered letters to the actor-manager Daniel Terry, one of his largest and most important correspondences. Since the manuscript of Scott's journal is now available for collation with Lockhart's extracts, we need not speak in detail here of the editorial attention given those extracts in the proofsheets. Suffice it to say that even at this late point in the work's composition, Lockhart still viewed such extracts as plastic elements in the total work, open to revision. Nor is it pertinent at present to scrutinize his manipulations of contributed memoranda, since they, too, belonged mostly to an earlier phase of composition. One example from the proofsheets will suffice. The minor changes in Basil Hall's lengthy journal extracts are characteristic: three paragraphs which open the published version were moved there from the end; Hall's own opening was moved to the end; and four short passages, repetitious or irrelevant, were eliminated (V, 374ff.). Of greater interest to the student of biography is the fact that in the proofsheets Lockhart was still touching up conversations and the Boswellian "business" accompanying them. The specific instances are less important than the general fact. Hogg's nickname is added to Scott's command: "Take your pencil, [Jemmy] and I'll dictate your ballad to you" (V, 305). In the conversation of Scott and Constable at the inception of plans for Constable's Miscellany, Constable's remarks are stylistically modified, and the depiction of one or two of Scott's actions is altered slightly. In another of the exchanges which Lockhart reported from memory, the speech of John Ballantyne is augmented as follows: "True, indeed? [not one word of it!—] any blockhead may stick to truth" (IV, 171). In James Ballantyne's account of the conversation on the failure of The Lord of the Isles , Scott's own remark is similarly clarified: "Well, well, James, [so be it—] but you know we must not droop, for we can't afford to give over" (III, 323). A rare instance of the proofsheet revision of talk which alters fact is found in the account of Scott's day of ruin (in January, 1826). Skene, his close friend, comes to call in the morning and finds Scott at his table. Scott makes his famous pronouncement—"My friend, give me a shake of your hand—mine is that of a beggar," which, incidentally, is Lockhart's rendering of Skene's recollection: "Skene, this is the hand of a beggar. Constable has failed and I am ruined du fond au comble ." 12 The proofsheet revision follows: Proof (VI, 214) He requested his friend to apologize for his absence from the Court, and added, "Don't fancy I am staying at home to brood idly on what can't be helped. I was at work upon Woodstock when you came in, and I shall take up the pen the moment you go." Revised He added, "Don't fancy I am going to stay at home to brood idly on what can't be helped. I was at work upon Woodstock when you came in, and I shall take up the pen the moment I get back from Court." Such is the sort of evidence the proofsheets offer in corroboration of what has been known, though less directly, of Lockhart's editorial procedures, of his confident manipulations of raw materials. Less obvious, but of greater general importance, the proofsheets help make it possible to trace the social circumstances of the work's completion, and lead to the realization that this biography which contemporary readers found distressingly candid would have been more so had Lockhart really enjoyed and preserved the independent control of the work which his modern critics assume. Let me recall the circumstances. Lockhart commenced publication of his seven volumes in March, 1837, a mere four-and-one-half years after the death of a national institution and an international idol. Scott's life and correspondence included a world of public prominence up to and including the British throne; many of the participants were still alive, some at the peak of their prominence. Nevertheless, Lockhart conceived his work largely in terms of that correspondence and the relationships it embodied. Named Scott's literary executor, Lockhart was one to whom Scott had been father, patron, literary counsellor, and symbol of responsible aristocracy. In the years following the dissolution of old Toryism and the passing of the first Reform Bill, he might well have viewed Scott's career with the jaundiced eye of Scott's crusty political persona Malachi Malagrowther; further, the sympathies of the fellow Scot and the demands of his role as Quarterly editor should have been enough to complete his ruination as a responsible biographer. That he accomplished even limited candor and objectivity, then, is a striking proof of moral independence. Edinburgh Whigdom, in the person of Lord Cockburn (no friend of Lockhart's), was surprised: "nothing is kept back or misrepresented so as to exhibit Scott in a false light." Cockburn could recall "no biography which gives a truer account of its subject." For Robert Southey it was "the most compleat biography that has ever appeared of a great man." William Wordsworth conceded that nothing remained for Lockhart "but to act as openly and sincerely as you have done." The historian Lord Mahon acknowledged that Lockhart had avoided the dangers of his domestic perspective; and R. H. Cheney praised the work's moderation of tone, citing its "union . . . of the greatest candour with that affectionate veneration which the public requires of those who approach one of its former idols." 13 For some, however, this union was too subtle. Harriet Martineau and J. F. Cooper mistook Lockhart's candor for moral obtuseness and censured as needless the exposure of "motives that are never admitted by the upright, and never avowed by the sensitive." 14 Cockburn, too, felt needless exposure to be the work's weakness; and George Ticknor, reporting on the transatlantic disillusionment the work had effected, conceded that Scott's letters were delightful, but protested that "in some of them Sir Walter is made to expose himself. There was no need of this, and it has given great pain." 15 Indeed, some were so pained that they gave currency to the startling hypothesis, ridiculed by Carlyle, "that Mr. Lockhart at heart had a dislike to Scott, and has done his best in an underhand treacherous manner to dishero him!" 16 Such were the earlyimpressions of Lockhart's candor. Some of the honesty and fullness of his account was, of course, unavoidable. "So much of Sir Walter's affairs" had become "objects of public investigation," wrote Wordsworth, that there was no alternative. 17 Lockhart was aware that with Scott dead, the tourists and peeping Toms who had infested Abbotsford would spring into print to capitalize on their eavesdroppings. Disclosures had been made already, often in inaccurate or misleading form; others would be made, and only by anticipating the efforts of those who would flood the English-speaking world with irresponsible Scottiana could Lockhart hope to control the inundation. "I feel that you are right in anticipating all injurious disclosures," wrote one in close touch with Lockhart's aims and procedures; "You have done this well, and by truly exhibiting the mixed motives on which Scott really acted you have done him full justice." 18 Some of his candor was more deliberate. To B. R. Haydon he expressed the faith that had sustained him: "I trusted to the substantial greatness and goodness of the character, and thought I should only make it more effective in portraiture by keeping in the few specks." 19 He voiced the same sentiment to the Lord High Commissioner Adam, while the work was still in progress: "I really could not have any pleasure in my task unless I carried with me throughout the strong and perfect faith that by telling the truth in all things I shall ultimately leave the character of Scott as high &amp; pure as that of perhaps any man ever can appear after being subjected to a close scrutiny." 20 To Scott's factor and amanuensis Laidlaw, he spoke of a "stern sense of duty" which impelled him to tell the truth in all things. 21 One feels that faith and that sense operative in the work. However, Lockhart's duty was not just to an abstract ideal. Neither the responsibility he espoused nor the image he struck off could be merely personal. Boswell, wrote Geoffrey Scott, "knew the best he could do must still fall short of that platonic standard, the idea of Johnson, laid up, in those who knew him, incommunicably, behind all words." 22 Lockhart's scepticism was even stronger, and in addition he was determined to avoid the disproportion and limited perspective of Boswell's work. But though he had known Scott better and had lived close to the center of Scott's life for several years, he recognized that he alone could not measure the degree of verisimilitude. So much he conceded to Laidlaw: "my chief anxiety on the appearance of the book will be, not to hear what is said by the world, but what is thought by you and the few others who can really compare the representation as a whole with the facts of the case." 23 Thus, he was ready to share his authority over the work with those few. Of course, some of the control was delegated involuntarily. His biographical ideal of copious detail and fullness made him hugely dependent on living contributors, and every contributor was to some extent editor of his own materials and memories. Some owners sent originals of Scott letters; but often, their notes to Lockhart refer instead to "faithful transcripts," even to such disquieting aids as that supplied by Harriet Scott of Harden, who had difficulty reading Scott's hand and put in a few words he seemed to have left out. Some contributors, like C. K. Sharpe, did their own selecting: "what I think may be of use to you shall be transcribed." Lady Louisa Stuart picked out the "most characteristic" of her letters. 24 Some transcribed and interwove their letters with reminiscences; while some, supplying reminiscences, sought to retain editorial control by specifying what must or must not be printed. There were a few, however, to whom Lockhart delegated authority more voluntarily, and the proofsheets supply evidence of the influence they wielded. When the work reached proof, Lockhart's independent efforts had been largely completed. He had begun the collection of materials at Scott's death, September 21, 1832. 25 Two years later he reported he was about to begin writing the work "for which I have hitherto been collecting and arranging the vast mass of materials." In March, 1836, it was again reported that he had commenced writing; he worked throughout that year, but, as his wife explained, he had been "arranging it so long in his mind" that it would not take long to write. Thus the proofs, circulating throughout 1837, represented the biography after Lockhart had worked over four years selecting, editing, compiling, and integrating materials. Had it appeared as it then stood, it would have been a fuller, darker picture, giving those who felt pain additional cause for dismay. That it did not is, in some measure, attributable to the influences we can trace in the proofsheets. In a letter to Laidlaw, Lockhart named and defined the most obvious influence: "I have waived all my own notions as to the manner of publication, etc., in deference to the bookseller, who is still so largely our creditor, and, I am grieved to add, will probably continue to be so for many years to come." "Cadell," he specifies elsewhere, "is at my request a copious annotator on my proofsheets &amp; I fancy he will keep a pretty strict watch over me when either Whigs or personal cronies of Constable are handled. But indeed I shall on all serious points take good care that I take him with me." 26 That Cadell was an unreliable traveling companion has been a principal theme of Sir Herbert Grierson's strictures. 27 Cadell was cannily aware of his own position in the Life : "here is Lockhart," he wrote, "telling about all of us to posterity. We will all be handed down as appendages to the great man." Of the Ballantyne-Constable part of Scott's world, he alone survived, "having cuckooed all these men out of their nests." 28 Thus, he was in a position to shape the history of Scott's business affairs. At the outset Lockhart's trust in him was considerable, as Basil Hall hints in replying to a Lockhart letter: "I am truly glad to see you writing in such terms of Cadell &amp; I feel well assured that you will never have reason to alter this tone. At least I never yet met a person with whom I have acted so confidentially &amp; so long without a shade of suspicion." When the shade crossed Lockhart's mind, it was too late. "I dare say," he wrote Murray in 1838, "you have seen a Ballantyne pamphlet nominally against me but really against Cadell whose evidence as to the affairs of Constable &amp; Co. I relied on &amp; thought I might well do so as it seemed criminative of his own house at least as much as of the other parties." 29 Lockhart's reliance may be seen in the proofsheets. He depended on Cadell for bibliographical facts and figures: marginal notes and corrections on the size of editions are signed "RC"; blanks left for the actual monetary obligations of the various houses at the time of the crash are filled in by Cadell. In his role as Edinburgh agent, he "saw to" Latin, Gaelic, and law phraseology. He was Lockhart's intermediary with Scott's Edinburgh friends, and through him their opinions and recollections were brought to bear on the work in progress. For one example, in the margin beside Lockhart's account of the advance printing of "Lenore," which Scott was alleged to have presented to Miss Belsches, Cadell has written: "Thomson and other comrades doubt the separate printing." 30 Of greater importance are the proofsheet revisions of passages relating to Cadell's own role in the Scott-Constable dealings. Especially suggestive is the difficulty and delay over the proof of the third chapter of the sixth volume. 31 This is the chapter that introduces Scott's journal and deals extensively with "commercial affairs." In it, Lockhart recalls the warning of financial chaos he had brought Scott in the autumn of 1825, and describes Scott's midnight ride for reassurance, allegedly from Abbotsford to Constable's house at Polton and back to the Lockharts' at Chiefswood in time for breakfast. Sir Herbert Grierson has argued that the ride could not have taken place; a more moderate view is that Lockhart's incident is a narrative adaptation of fact. 32 But what concerns us is that it was Cadell who gave Scott deceptive reassurance at this time, and hence, the proofsheet attempts to mystify or generalize the account of this early warning can be explained only as effects of Cadell's influence. Here is a short paragraph as it appears in the proof: It is proper to add here that the story about the banker's throwing up the book was, as subsequent revelations attested, wholly groundless. The incident on which the rumour rested occurred in the first week of November (VI, 100). Several attempts were made at revision of the second sentence: "rested" became "originated"; "A trifling enough" was added at the beginning of the sentence; "in the first week" became "early in." Finally, the whole sentence was vigorously crossed out, I believe by Cadell's pen, and Lockhart substituted the vague second sentence of the published version: "Sir Walter's first guess as to its origin proved correct." An excision in the opening of the following paragraph further obscures the timetable. Originally, Lockhart's allusion to Murray was followed by: "with whom I had formed a very strict connexion in the preceding month." Such exclusions of detail, when they conceal Cadell's role in the commercial affairs of 1825-26, tend to increase the severity of Lockhart's presentation of Constable. There is, for a related example, the mystery of Lockhart's reported second meeting with Constable in London (January, 1826), at which Constable is alleged to have proposed that Scott borrow 20,000 pounds and forward it to Constable in London. James Glen has concluded that no such proposal was made, and Grierson has recalled that Scott's pointless advances were made at the insistence of Cadell. 33 In view of these assertions and Grierson's argument that the second Lockhart-Constable meeting did not occur, one finds significance in the fact that this "scene of the same kind a day or two afterwards" was written into the proofsheet by Lockhart after Cadell's reading (VI, 177). This is not the only instance in the proofs of the birth of an incident by binary fission. Another influence on the Life was John Wilson Croker, sometime Secretary of the Admiralty and longtime political mainstay of the Quarterly Review . In January, 1837, Lockhart wrote to ask Croker if he could recall any circumstances of Scott's first dinner as guest of the Prince Regent at Carlton House. "Can you recall for instance what song it was that the Prince sung—for Scott in a minor poem alludes to having heard him perform in that way &amp; I take it on that occasion." Anxious to depict the Prince in song, he wrote to Adam with the same request. Adam, who had already sent an account of the dinner, could not help on "the subject of the songs": "it was the only dinner at Carlton House where I met Sir Walter; . . . I soon after left London &amp; was never there at the same time again with Sir Walter— There was no singing at that dinner. Croker was not there, indeed I never dined with Croker at Carlton House." Croker was not sure he remembered Adam's being there, either; and he reported Lord Hertford's certainty that Adam was not present. Yet they all claimed to be recounting the same dinner of twenty-two years before. 34 But they agreed as to the absence of singing, and the proofsheets show what Lockhart did about that. Originally, the account of the Prince's "several capital songs" made up part of the account of the first dinner, following the Prince's quoting of Tom Moore and immediately preceding the "Author of Waverley" toast. In the proofs, the brief paragraph has been cut out of that position and pasted in following the end of the account, where it is introduced by these words written in the margin: "Before [Scott deleted ] he left town he again dined [w deleted ] at Carlton House, when the party was a still smaller one than before, and the merriment if possible still more free." Thus, one dinner has become two (III, 336-339). Croker found the account "disgraceful" even after this change; and Lockhart, in a note added to his second edition, attributed the misunderstanding to Adam's confusion of this 1815 dinner with another at Dalkeith in 1822. Meanwhile, Adam was dead, and the account stood—in spite of Croker. But his influence was by no means disregarded in other areas. Among the Scott letters he forwarded to Lockhart were two of the 4th and 5th of February, 1818, in which Scott tells Croker of the discovery of the Scottish Regalia. The second of these letters is known only in Lockhart's published version; the proofsheet version contains a hint of Scott's hope that a traditional office associated with the Regalia might be revived in his favor. The bracketed portion of the following has been crossed out: I think that the Knight Marischal's office rested in the Kintore family until 1715, when it was resumed on account of the bearded Earl's accession to the Insurrection of that year. He escaped well, for they might have taken his estate and his earldom. [It was not afterwards conferred on any other person on account of the Regalia being shut up, but it appears for the credit of the ancient kingdom of Scotland, that now they are brought to light, they should have their proper offices as formerly.] I must save post . . . . (IV, 118) The excision must have been dictated by Croker, for Lockhart, in his letter of acknowledgment, expresses his "doubt about suppressing his hint as to the Knight Marischalship." 35 Lockhart continues with a request for further information: "At all events tell me whether the P.R. at the time shewd any disposition to comply w Scotts request." The direct embodiment of Croker's reply in a passage of narrative must, to Croker, have seemed disturbingly indiscreet, for the passage in the proofsheet was cancelled. Originally it followed the sentence ending "a revenue sufficient for remunerating responsible and respectable guardianship": The merely honorary office which Scott had fancied might be revived in his own favour, would have been so, Mr. Croker informs me, without delay, had the then Prime Minister attended to the wishes expressed on the occasion by the Regent. But the dull moderating of Lord Liverpool's intellect, and the coldness of his feelings, prevented his either appreciating Scott's claim to such a distinction, or the interest with which his Royal Master had received the results of the question itself. It was obvious, however, that some gentleman must be appointed to the post which Scott had, from the beginning, been anxious to see conferred on Captain Ferguson, and on this score he was gratified (IV, 120). In the published Life , only a revised allusion to Captain Ferguson's appointment remains. But the area in which Croker's restraining influence was most apt to appear was that of Scott's later political activities. Years after the Life was published, Lockhart explained to Croker his editing of Scott's journal. He looked ahead to the time when an heir would "sell the complete Diary for a larger sum than my book brought for the relief of his immediate representative," and predicted: "Posterity will know that I at least endeavoured to avoid the offending of Scotts surviving contemporaries and you will not doubt that I had to spare Tories about as often as Whigs the castigation of diarizing Malagrowther." 36 The problematical relationship of Croker, Malagrowther, and Malagrowther's Tory biographer may account for other signs of reticence in the proofsheets. Some such influence, at least, is apparent in chapters and journal extracts dealing with the London reaction to Malagrowther's defense of the Scottish banks. Journal entries have received considerable excision and modification, but of greater practical interest here is a small group of letters pertaining to the same subject, whose suppressed passages have never been published. For example, there is the undated letter (early Spring, 1826), to Sir Robert Dundas, pertaining to Lord Melville's continued kind feelings for Scott, and expressing Scott's continued resistance to Lord Melville's policies. But this expression is faint once Lockhart has suppressed the end of the long first paragraph (following "opinions are waxing old"): Their tenants are as yet faithful and steady, especially in consequence of the late indulgence of their landlords. What a check may do, if this small-note measure be followed by such consequences as are generally apprehended, no man can pretend to foretell. The question is not entirely, as Lord Melville apprehends, of abstract policy; it is wagering a speculation against the length of experience, and the probability of great and extensive distress. I wish to God they would back out of it, and let Malachi be considered as the greatest liar and calumniator ever existed. I would rather it were so than that my friends should have fatal reason to find I had been a true, though unregarded prophet (VI, 270). Such exchanges occurred during Lockhart's first months in London. That his career was implicated in Malagrowther's wars is evident from this passage, suppressed in the Croker letter that follows Scott's to Dundas: if an opportunity should occur of doing him any service or kindness, I think you will see that Lord Melville and your other friends will not recollect that he has any relationship with Malachi, or if they should, it will only make them more anxious to convince you that they bear no malice to the cynical ancient (VI, 274-275). Scott's reply, published by Grierson from Lockhart and the Croker Papers , 37 is much fuller in the proofsheet, where it has been considerably altered. From it have been cut Scott's assurances of Malagrowther's local support, and also, two months after the financial disaster, this bland denial of concern for his loss: I cannot say it broke my sleep for a night, and why should it? I have a much larger provision remaining than admirals and generals who have fought and bled for their country receive for their services, and I should be ashamed of myself (as Lady Anne Hamilton says) if I were giving myself much trouble about a loss which cannot be helped. Besides, I have means of retrieving my affairs, and if the effort misgives in that respect, it will at least furnish me some amusement, as my attempts must be of a literary character (VI, 277). Such cuts are better understood as parts of a larger pattern of reticence, a pattern which points to the influence of a far more important adviser than Croker. Lockhart dedicated the work to Scott's intimate friend, Morritt of Rokeby—and with good reason. Though it has been known that Morritt helped Lockhart select the diary extracts to be published, it has not, to my knowledge, been previously remarked that Morritt exerted a considerable influence on the Life as a whole. 38 Morritt's letters to Lockhart make clear that he and W. S. Rose read and annotated Lockhart's proofsheets. For example, "I sent you this morning the proofs of the whole 2nd Volume with a swinging long letter enclosing also a sheet of references and comments noted on the margin." 39 We needn't—nor can we—identify all Morritt's alterations. But we can see that he wasn't ignored. It was Morritt who contributed the sceptical comment on Scott's report of "50,000 blackguards . . . ready to rise between Tyne and Wear" for which Cockburn credited Lockhart. It was Morritt who urged the cutting of two passages which "clog the march of narrative"—the account of Joanna Baillie's Family Legend , and the extracts from Scott's "Essay on Judicial Reform"; and they were cut. Some of his suggestions signify nothing more than a desire to protect or conceal himself. To conceal his authorship of the account of Scott and Jeffrey in 1808, he has, he tells Lockhart, "mystified and generalized" the description. Finding a letter written by himself to Scott, in which he speaks impertinently of "the Earl of Darlington now Duke of Cleveland," he insists it be changed: "I will recast it as I wish it to stand or leave it out altogether in revising the proof." In themselves, these are insignificant; yet they indicate his general attitude. Consider his support of a cut urged by Cadell. Cadell had questioned some early expressions of Scott's financial fears and a hint of subsequent dubious transactions. Morritt's position is clear: "it were better to suppress even the heart rending appeal here made to our posthumous sympathy than to expose his character to malignant comment, for subsequent inadvertency at a more sanguine moment." Concerning the same passage he adds this broad directive to Lockhart: "I would at all events not name Gillies, or indeed any innocent or unfortunate name in private transactions. I have on the same principle &amp; stronger feeling begged quarter for other more distinguished names as you will see. Do not 'make one worthy man' (or woman) his foe, or your own. ' Non est tanti ,' for rogues, fools, &amp; coxcombs lay it on &amp; spare not; &amp; there are plenty to season the book." Morritt was free to revise, and one of his characteristic revisions involves a particular editorial license for which Lockhart has been blamed. Among other "improvements" of his documents, Lockhart has been charged with the cultural betrayal of "correcting" Scott's Scotticisms. The charge seems most peculiar in the face of other evidence. One thinks, for example, of the strong cultural nationalism of Dr. Peter Morris's view of Scott. One recalls this statement in a letter from Lockhart to Allan Cunningham: "I shall never cease to have some difference of opinion w you as to the Scotch tongue—which nobody uses quite to my satisfaction but Sir Walter. . . . he alone writes what is all over Scotland Scotch National." One thinks of Lockhart's later enjoyment of Lord Cockburn's style in the Life of Jeffrey : "the locality of all his views with the Scotch of his style are to me among the attractions of the book." 40 Why, then, would Lockhart have yielded to the murderous snobbery of Anglicization in the case of his ultimus Scotorum ? The answer is simply that he did not. Morritt's sheet of "References and Comments" identifies the ubiquitous editorial hand sprinkling "shalls" and "shoulds" through the proofsheets. "Rose agrees with me in all the substitutions I have made of words and sometimes of collocations, except where he has dissented in red ink. They are chiefly in Scott's own letters, and are Scotticisms or at least not English, (shalls, wills, etc.) I would alter these that they may not be of example to our hackney writers, and confound the language by giving them authority and precedent like this." Lockhart yielded to Morritt and Rose. He yielded to Morritt's pleas, too, in the excision of "damns" from diary and letters: "they are banished from print," Morritt argues, quoting Bob Acres on their obsolescence; "nor would I print for another what he would not have printed himself." Apparently applying the same principle, Morritt urged reticence in the depiction of Scott's mental deterioration during his last months. Nor was he alone in this. Laidlaw had found a few letters written from Malta and Naples and vowed he would not even give them to Lockhart if he thought they would be printed: "Although it seems to be well known that this powerfull [ sic ] mind went utterly out of joint it is not for you or me to print his letters written in that state." 41 Lockhart answered with a plea to see what use might be made of them, and the proofsheets indicate that he had gone far in trying to accomplish the purpose he described to Laidlaw: "to put together a picture that will be highly touching of a great mind shattered, but never degraded, and always to the last noble." 42 Then came Morritt's plea: "Do not print a line of the diary that indicates decay of mind, or relate except in a general way the painful close of the scene in which he only partook of the universal lot of all mortality. Facts serviceable to medical science may be medically told, but as Benjamin Constant told Lady Davy when she objected to some superfluous improprieties of his heroine as indecorous in his book, 'Je mettrai cela dans une note.'" The result is obvious in the proofsheets. References to and manifestations of the mental effects of Scott's illness have been cut from letters, journals, narrative links, and reminiscences. The following is cut from Lockhart's narrative: "His bookseller and printer had before them daily evidence that, whatever the origin of the ailment might have been, it had not left either the mind or the hand exactly what they had used to be" (VII, 202). Also cut (and hence absent from the Grierson edition) is a long extract of a letter to Cadell on Castle Dangerous and Scott's pathetic determination to salvage Count Robert . It ends: "I will talk to you about my plan when I see you, for which I am sufficiently eager, and will show you also what I have thought of as to Count Robert—but I fear it will always be liker mended china than whole. However, it must not be lost; but I wish to start with something on which I have bestowed the pains I am now taking. We must play our best bout at the ceasing of this long frost, and show, if we can, that Richard is himself again" (VII, 289). Large cuts are made in accounts by Sir William Gell and Edward Chency of Scott in Italy. Gell's manuscript is in print. 43 The whereabouts of Cheney's are unknown to me; but the proofsheets contain valuable suppressed passages. "He spoke of his last work with contempt," says Cheney. "'Never read it,' he said, 'it smells of the apoplexy.'" Lockhart prints: "'No author,' he continued, 'has ever had so much cause to be grateful to the public as I have. All I have written has been received with indulgence.'" He suppresses all that follows: "'I was astonished at my own success. At first I wrote for amusement, and from the pleasure I had in spending money I acquired so readily, and surely no man's money was ever more his own than mine, for I made every halfpenny by the sweat of my own brain—latterly I wrote from necessity, and to satisfy my creditors; and my last thing has served my turn—for it cleared me'" (VII, 378). Suppressed, too, is the opening of Dr. Ferguson's account of Scott's homecoming: "During Sir Walter's absence from this country, I heard from his family that he had lost all control over his appetite, and was at times so irritable and excitable, as to render him nearly unmanageable. He was tormented by an incessant desire to return home, but believed there was a conspiracy to prevent his doing so. This fixed wish extinguished every other; and he scarcely ever evinced the slightest desire to see or explore any of the objects which his situation presented" (VII, 384). Such suppressions are in keeping with Morritt's views—and, incidentally, with the views of other older members of the Scott circle whose influence was less directly felt. But it will be suggested that Lockhart accepted only that advice with which he agreed. In answer we might appeal to the very fact that the suppressions were not made earlier, to the fact that Morritt had to state his case so strongly and repeatedly, to the fact that surviving correspondence shows Lockhart for years in the position of one pleading for permission to be honest and full in his use of materials. But there is an admirable bit of evidence to show that on a crucial moral issue Lockhart might yield somewhat to Morritt's demands that the portrait be softened, and yet persist in his own judgment. On Scott's blacksheep brother Daniel, Morritt wrote: I think the facts of Scott's conduct on his brother Daniel's death though truly given do not leave a true impression of his feelings. The particular misconduct and stigma on poor Dan's character are not and should not be specified, but then, in justice to Scott, the detail of his refusal to see him, even in extremis , and his not attending the funeral or wearing mourning should also be suppressed, and only mentioned in general terms. I write this in justice to the tenderest and kindest heart I ever knew, which ever open to the distress even of an enemy, still recoiled from the disgrace even of a brother. Lockhart added Morritt's last phrases in the proof—but only after they had been fused with his own: "Thus sternly, when in the height and pride of his blood, could Scott, whose heart was never hardened against the distress of an enemy, recoil from the disgrace of a brother" (II, 247). When issues were less crucial, the proofsheets stand as evidence that during the final months of work, when Lockhart was in "painful anxiety" about his wife, or in mourning for her, he was willing to delegate authority. This is not to say that the delegates ever took sharp exception to his views. Lockhart, a bafflingly complex man, experienced strikingly various feelings and attitudes in his relationship with Scott. His combination of Calvinist severity with philosophic hero-worship recalls that other West Scot, his admirer Carlyle. At times, provoked by the worldliness of Scott's "energetic &amp; tumultuous existence," the austere puritan would prevail. To Commissioner Adam, for example, he revealed the limits of his sympathy for Scott: He had various faults if I may venture to speak openly to you who knew him &amp; loved him as well as anybody did—but I think they may all be traced to the same boundless energy of imagination that gave us his immortal works. This imagination exalted &amp; embellished for him things which I never could bring myself to respect &amp; worship as he did — rank — fortune — mere worldly distinction — even down to the investing wt. a chivalrous dignity objects which a tithe of his observation wd have made any man less under the sway of romantic association contemplate as (especially with reference to Scott's own self-won position in the eye of all mankind) mere nothings. 44 An influence such as Morritt's sanctioned some feelings at the expense of others. Had Lockhart heard less from Morritt, and from interested parties such as Cadell and Croker, had he received more of Adam's frank encouragement, more backthumping adjurations like Basil Hall's —"be bold—let yourself out—d-n the expence—dont be afraid—express heartily and manfully all you yourself feel and think—and be well assured that this is the genuine inspiration in matters of biography especially" 45 —perhaps the sterner tone would have sounded more insistently.</field>

In his New Life (p. 32n.) he reports his inability to find any reference to the early printing other than that sent Lockhart from the Baroness Purgstall (J. A. Cranstoun) by Basil Hall. Cadell's note was ignored, and the Purgstall story stayed. 31 Lockhart held it up for further proof, sent the following to press. 32 "Lang, Lockhart, and Biography," pp. 31-34. His argument is that the ride could have been made only after Nov. 11, and that after Nov. 11 Scott was in Edinburgh, Lockhart at Chiefswood. Dr. Corson, in conversation, recalled Una Pope-Hennessy's guess that the ride was actually to see Cadell: The Laird of Abbotsford (1932), p. 264n. But it would be wrong to absolve Constable of blame in the deceptive reassurance of Scott. The day after the news came from London (Nov. 22), Constable, in the presence of "J. B. and R. Cadell," "convinced me we will do well to support the London House" ( Journal , p. 11). Is it so unlikely that at some time during the last ten days of November, Scott rode from Edinburgh to Polton, and then, late at night, decided to go on to Chiefswood (c. 35 m.), arriving for breakfast? The only contradictory detail would be Lockhart's strolling over to Abbotsford to warn Scott the evening of the drive; but this might well have occurred at an earlier date. It was not uncommon for Lockhart to amalgamate incidents in such a way; it was not part of his practice to invent incidents ex nihilo . 33 Letters of Scott , I, xciii; Grierson, New Life , p. 260 &amp; n., and "Lang, Lockhart, and Biography," pp. 35-36. 34 Lockhart, late Jan., 1837, Croker Papers, Clements Lib.; Adam, MS. 924, and Croker, MS. 927, Nat.

      <field name="heading_text">Thomas Carnan and the Almanack Monopoly by Cyprian Blagden *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is well known that, in the 1770's, Thomas Carnan challenged the Stationer's Company's right—derived from grants by James I — to be the sole publishers of Almanacks, 1 and that he won resounding victories first in the Court of Common Pleas and then in the House of Commons. One story is told of his keeping a clean shirt in his pocket during November against his annual arrest at the suit of the Stationers' Company, 2 and another of his driving his 'lofty phaeton and pair' again and again through St Paul's Churchyard, down Paternoster Row and past the entrance to Stationers' Hall, after his first triumph. 3 I hope that the second story is true, for there is, I am sorry to say, no foundation for the first. Carnan was the kind of man about whom stories were told: what did 'this eccentric and singular character' achieve and how much did the Company suffer? Thomas Carnan came to London from Reading in 1744 when his step-father, John Newbery, opened a shop in St Paul's Churchyard. Here he learned to distribute cheap publications and patent medicines, not only in the capital but throughout the provinces; and here he was very close to the warehouse of the English Stock at Stationers' Hall, from which nearly half a million Almanacks were sold during the last two months of each year. The English Stock was the name given to the trading organization which exploited James I's grants to the Company of the sole rights in certain classes of books. Before the end of the seventeenth century the most profitable of these monopolies was that for Almanacks and Prognostications, and in 1744, when Carnan began working in London, about 150 Liverymen (or their widows) were drawing a 12½% Dividend on their investments in the English Stock. More than half the Almanacks sold were in the form of sheets to hang on the wall and were not unlike the modern Oxford Almanack; the Stationers' Company offered three varieties at 6 d. each. The other kind, of which Old Moore's is the best known of the twenty then available and of which Whitaker's is the modern descendent, were in the form of little books, of 3 or 3½ sheets, to sell at 8 d. or 9 d. stitched. All had calendars for the year and some information — astrological, meteorological, historical, topographical, horticultural, agricultural, medical, social — of varying value. Parker's for instance — one of the more respectable — gave the Law Terms, Saints' Days, the times of moon-rise and the daily motions of the Planets, details of eclipses, tables of the English sovereigns since the Conquest and of the Lord Mayors and Sheriffs of London since the Restoration, lists of active Bishops and Judges and Aldermen of London, rates of hackney-coaches and hackney-chairs and watermen, and a 'Table of the Planets' Essential Dignities'. Improving verses were thrown in for good measure: Short Bounds of Life are set to Mortal Man, 'Tis Virtue's Work alone to stretch the span; Learn to live well, that thou may'st die so too; To live and die is all we have to do. is set at the foot of the page for November and December 1753. Parker's was first published for 1690 and after 50 years was selling at the rate of 3000 copies a year. But the turnover on all Almanacks distributed from Stationers' Hall was about £10,000 and the gross profit sometimes £2000 a year. 4 This business was tempting enough to encourage interlopers up and down the country; printers in London, and at York (as early as 1665), at Chester and Exeter, had pirated the Company's Almanacks. A standard warning was printed at the foot of the broadside which announced each year the titles for sale and their prices. 5 This asserted firstly that all Almanacks not printed for the Company of Stationers were counterfeit and secondly that several 'Sham Predictions and Prognostications' had been published 'to serve instead of Almanacks, whereby the People are greatly Imposed upon, the Company of Stationers much injured, and the fair Trader abused'. Rewards were offered for information about such shams and the prosecution of offenders promised. The Company's monopoly in these cheap publications was obviously vulnerable and, as the warning shows, open to attack from two sides. One of the Almanacks might be reprinted exactly and copies distributed as if they had been received from the warehouse of the English Stock; James Leake of Bath was involved in such a transaction in 1724, and in 1757 there was a report that counterfeit copies of Poor Robin were circulating in Leeds. The other threat came from pocketbooks designed to 'serve instead of Almanacks' — what we call Diaries — which could be easily compiled and safely marketed. Parker's Emphemeris could be turned into a Diary only when it had been interleaved by the binder, and it then became somewhat bulky; the pocket-book designed from the beginning as a Diary would appeal to the man — or woman — who preferred space for entering engagements or for recording expenditure to prophesies about the weather, advice about the desirability of making a journey on a particular day, or even details of the geocentric motions of the Planets. In the middle of the eighteenth century the demand for this second kind of annual publication — the Diary — was still, apparently, small, whereas the demand for the Almanack with information and guidance was enormous. But the survival chances of either of these kinds of ephemeral printing are minute; how many hundreds of the fifty million true Almanacks of the eighteenth century can one find today? One is therefore thrown back on advertisements, which may possibly give a false picture. In the first place, it was safe to draw public attention to a Diary and there was risk in announcing a clear infringement of the Stationers' Company's copyright. In the second place, it is not always easy, from the wording of an advertisement, to distinguish today between an Almanack and a Diary. I suspect that the confusion was, in part, deliberately created in an attempt to encroach on the Company's market, without actually infringing its copyright and without the necessity of paying the Stamp Duty which true Almanacks had to carry. On the basis, however, of evidence which I realize may be proved to be shaky, I believe that, while there was a certain amount of surreptitious piracy of Almanacks — mostly in the provinces — reputable London booksellers were exploring the market for Diaries; and that only when the Company grew anxious and threatened action against the publishers of the latter, was a full attack, headed by Carnan, launched on the Almanack monopoly. On 30 November 1748, four years after Carnan's arrival in London, Robert Dodsley published The New Memorandum Book , for the year 1749, in different bindings at 1 s. and 1 s. 6 d. 6 This was almost certainly not the first of its kind but it is the first of which I know the title and the name of the bookseller behind it and of which I have seen an early example. 7 By the following year two other London booksellers had joined Dodsley in this field. On 29 November Richard Baldwin junior, of Paternoster Row, entered in the register at Stationers' Hall The Gentleman's and Tradesman's Daily Journal , and at about the same time Thomas Carnan published The Ladies Complete Pocket Book . 8 Both were for the year 1750. In a later advertisement 9 Dodsley describes not only the contents of The New Memorandum Book and by implication the contents of the others — but the irritation which the imitators — Baldwin, Carnan and the rest — were causing him . It is neatly Printed in a Pocket Size on fine Writing Paper rul'd for Accounts, Appointments, and Memorandums, with Pockets for keeping Bills and Letters, Price 1 s. 6 d. , neatly bound. . . . .

At the same time he announced a similar book for the ladies. In 1755 Carnan, armed with a formal resolution of the Court of Aldermen, applied for the freedom of the Stationers' Company by redemption; on 8 April the Court of Assistants voted against admitting him but recorded no reason. The warning about imitation Almanacks continued to appear each year, but it was not until the spring of 1772 — well over twenty years after Dodsley entered the field — that the Court was sufficiently worried to take counsel's opinion whether these annual publications, though called Pocket-Books or Journals, were really Almanacks. On the strength of the advice given, it was decided to warn publishers of such imitations that next time they would be prosecuted. Even so, no action was taken that year. It was not until the following year, 1773, that the fun began. On 13 November Thomas Carnan published Reuben Burrow's A Diary for the Year of Our Lord 1774 . Two days later William Strahan, the son of the Upper Warden, called on Carnan; there are two versions of what passed between them. 10 Carnan averred that Strahan brought an overture from the Company which he contemptuously refused; Strahan maintained, in evidence given two years later, that he could not exactly remember the conversation but he never had authority, from his father or anyone else, to say that the Stationers wished to come to terms. On 18 November the Company filed a bill in Chancery and asked for an injunction to prohibit the further sale of the Diary ; on 25 November the injunction was served on Carnan, who continued to sell his other Almanacks and Diaries — Weston's Gardeners's and Planter's Calendar , for instance, which he had entered on 20 July, and The Ladies Complete Pocket Book . In his answer to the bill, which is dated 4 February 1774, he admitted the printing of 2,500 copies of the Diary and the sale of 1,900; but he boldly asserted that James I had no power to grant a perpetual monopoly in Almanacks. The timing of his answer (though Carnan had chafed — with some reason, I think, — at his lawyer's delay) could hardly have been better, for in the same month of February 1774 11 the House of Lords gave its famous judgment on copyright; it upheld Alexander Donaldson's appeal against the Lord Chancellor's injunction to restrain the sale of Thomson's Seasons , which Thomas Becket claimed as his property. The idea of perpetual copyright no longer had even a suggestion of legal support. On 1 March the Lord Chancellor, under the shadow of this decision, made two orders on the bill brought by the Stationers' Company: first, that Carnan be allowed to sell any Almanacks he had published provided only that he set apart, in a manner approved by the Accountant General, all profits until the suit was finally settled; and second, that the case of the monopoly should be argued in the Court of Common Pleas, where the Judges were to give answers to these two questions: (1) Did the grant of James I apply to all Almanacks or only to those approved either by the Archbishop of Canterbury or by the Bishop of London? (2) Has the Crown the power to grant to one party a right which excludes all other parties? Nearly fifteen months passed before, on Monday 29 May 1775, the opinion of the Judges was made known. The answer to the first question was that the grant protected approved Almanacks only; the answer to the second was that the right could not be exclusive. On that same Monday, William Waller of Lincoln's Inn, Carnan's counsel, called on his client; of what passed between them — as of the conversation with Strahan in 1773 — there is more than one version. According to Carnan, Waller, 'to his very great surprise' and in the presence of George Robinson (whose participation I shall explain in a minute), offered £10,000 from the Company of Stationers if he would refrain from praying for the dissolution of the Chancery injunction. Carnan maintained also that, after Waller's departure with a blunt refusal, Robinson had argued in favour of acceptance and had repeated his arguments before witnesses at the Globe Tavern in Fleet Street on the following Friday evening, 2 June. He later swore to the truth of these statements in the presence of the Lord Mayor. 12 Robinson averred that no offer was made which he could have taken in earnest. Waller admitted that 'in Sport &amp; upon Mr Carnan's Boasts about Bribery' he had offered sums up to £10,000 and then £10,000 a year for life, and that, even if Carnan had not at the time seen a joke which was quite clear to Robinson, it had been explained to him later. It is difficult to be certain about the part played by George Robinson. He was not a freeman of the Stationers' Company but he built up a very successful wholesale business at 25 Paternoster Row. His name appears with Carnan's on the latter's Almanacks for 1776, and the advertisements of November 1775 (six months after the Common Pleas verdict) say that he and Carnan 'at their joint expense, dispossessed the Stationers' Company'. It is possible that the following publishing season with his headstrong partner was enough to convince him of the wisdom of his original advice. But whether or not he ever gave this advice, he and Carnan parted company and on 22 October 1776 he announced in the press 13 that he first had the idea of testing the legality of the Company's monopoly and that no offer which he could take seriously was ever made to him. It was this declaration by his old ally which led Carnan to make his deposition before the Lord Mayor on 26 October and to publish it in his advertisements. At the same time he admitted that Waller's little joke had been explained to him six days earlier, but he pointed out that 'the Sporting Counsellor' had offered to produce a draft for £10,000 on 29 May, the day of the interview — which to him 'did not seem very jocular' — and that the promise of further approaches from the Company had driven him out of town until the Chancery injunction should be dissolved. Pretending that a rejected offer was never seriously intended is a manoeuvre which has often been employed; but though it relies on that most telling gambit — the suggestion that one's opponent has no sense of humour — it is seldom convincing. Carnan may have exaggerated the sum named 14 but he was right, I believe, in his assertion that the Company was eager to settle with him; it had been making such financial compromises with rivals for nearly 150 years and it was still paying the Universities £1,000 a year as compensation for not exercising their rights to print certain popular books — Almanacks amongst them. The wisdom of trying to buy out a rival after Donaldson's successful appeal to the Lords may seem doubtful; but I shall show that, in the conditions prevailing up to 1834, it was well worth while. In 1775, however, the attempt, if made, was unsuccessful; the injunction was duly dissolved on Friday 2 June, when Carnan returned to London and met Robinson — and others — at the Globe. In the year of Wilkes's Mayoralty Carnan may well have been a hero where book-sellers who were not partners in the English Stock were gathered together; and he may well have ordered round his 'lofty phaeton and pair'. But an injunction in Chancery was as near as he ever was to the necessity of carrying a clean shirt in his pocket against his expected arrest at the suit of the Stationers' Company. The gloom at Stationers' Hall was not entirely unrelieved for the Company was able to win one immediate advantage — to the tune of £1,000 a year — from Carnan's success; it gave up the payments to keep the Universities 15 out of a market which was now, theoretically, free for all. Moreover, this freedom, being on a par with our freedom to use the Ritz Hotel, tended to favour the Company as the wealthiest operator. All Almanacks had to be printed on stamped paper. The Stamp Duty had been first imposed in 1711 and after the increase in 1742 a sheet Almanack had to carry a 'double 1 d. ' stamp and a book Almanack a 'double 2 d. ' stamp. The Company, in consequence, had to find £6,000 each summer for the stamps on the half million Almanacks which it published in November. 16 Unless a man were prepared to risk cheating the Revenue (as provincial printers no doubt did) he had to have considerable capital to be a dangerous competitor to the Company, even after 1774; and, though the duty was passed on to the customer, the return on the outlay, of which the cost of paper and print might be not more than a fifth, was bound to be less than normal. 17 But Carnan, with the assistance at first of George Robinson, was able to raise the capital and considered the enterprise well worth while. By the autumn of 1775 he was publishing eleven jointly with Robinson; 18 nine of these, all stamped, were improved versions of the Company's Almanacks — a powerful invasion of the monopoly. In addition, he published the Lady's Complete Pocket-Book , at 1 s. bound, jointly with his partner Francis Newbery, with Stanley Crowder and Richard Baldwin in Paternoster Row, and with Benjamin Collins of Salisbury. According to his advertisements, he also supplied Baldwin's Daily Journal , at 1 s. bound in red with pockets for letters. By the autumn of 1777 he had increased the number of his Almanacks to thirty-one, twenty-five of which he entered in the register. (The number is not really as impressive as it sounds, because twenty were modifications of a single pattern to suit different parts of the kingdom — a tactic employed in the past by the Company.) The only evidence for the quantities handled by Carnan comes from his answer to the Chancery bill of 1774 and from his printed petitions to the House of Commons in 1779 and 1781. The 2,500 of Burrow's Diary (which I have already mentioned) is unlikely to be an exaggeration; 3,000 is the figure given for his large sheet Almanack. Carnan asserted that, up to and including the Almanacks for 1779, he had printed a total of 96,000 books and 220,000 sheets, and that the numbers of books for the two succeeding years were 36,000 and 47,000. Since these claims, so publicly made, could be checked at the Stamp Office and since there was a comparable falling off in the sales of Almanacks from Stationers' Hall in these years, I am inclined to accept Carnan's claim that by 1781 he was distributing, almost single-handed, well over 100,000 Almanacks a year. For the reasons I have given, it is impossible to be certain how many other Almanacks and Diaries were being published in London or the provinces at this time. Only two were entered in the register: The Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas for 1779 , by Thomas Baker (possibly the Southampton bookseller) on 27 November 1778; and Bell's Military Almanack by Robert Wilson on 20 November of the following year. London newspaper advertisements during the autumns of 1775 to 1777 offer eight for ladies 19 and half a dozen others, one of which was boldly called The Stationers Almanack . 20 Outside London there were almost certainly others besides The Newcastle Memorandum Book , which had been first published in 1755. 21 It is quite impossible even to guess at the numbers of these printed and sold; all that can be said is that the autumn of 1776 was the English Stock's worst publishing season in the eighteenth century and its sales of Almanacks fell below 300,000; that this was followed by a recovery during the next five years as individual interlopers found the competition or the Stamp Duty too fierce a deterrent; and that this recovery was then gradually whittled away largely by the enterprise of Carnan alone, until in 1787 the sales were well under 350,000. 22 What steps did the Stationers' Company take to repel this invasion of its territory by Carnan and the others when the reliable and often used Chancery injunction had failed? Little enough was done by press advertising. Less than £36 was spent in 1776 and Carnan claimed that the £400 he had expended up to 1778 was more than the Company had spent in 170 years. It had, however, persuaded the compiler of Poor Robin for 1774 to include a dedication to all the Almanack makers in 'the Empire of Great Britain' with a neat résumé of what each of the Company's authors set out to do. Andrews, for instance, 'gives Monthly Observations enough, and (sometimes) pretty good Weather;' 'Pearse affords some sublime Poetry'; 'and the best comes at the last, ( viz ) White's Coelestial Atlas, which is perhaps the most useful annual publication in all Europe ,' — a generous tribute from the compiler of one publication to the compiler of another but probably not very effective as a piece of sales promotion. Rather more was done to improve the contents of the Almanacks. On 5 October 1775 the Company made an agreement with Charles Hutton, Professor of Mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, for checking the much criticized astronomical and meteorological data in the old Almanacks and for rewriting some of them. Special care was taken over obtaining licenses, at 2 s. 6 d. a time, from the chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury. On 24 October seventeen 23 Almanacks were entered in the register to the Master, Wardens and proprietors of the English Stock — an attempt to establish copyright in the separate publications after the removal of the all-embracing protection. For 1777 and the two following years the prices of most book Almanacks were reduced from 9 d. to 8 d. , and of the sheets from 6 d. to 5 d. 24 'with what noble Design', as Carnan said in one of his advertisements, 'is submitted to the Consideration of the Public'. This is the normal tactics of the big firm prepared to lose money for a year or two in order to drive a rival from the field and the tactics used by the Bible monopolists in the seventeenth century. A loss of over £400 was achieved without appreciable effect on the sales; since the public was aware of the 4 d. stamp on each book, any greater reduction was probably not wise. These minor adjustments to well-established habits may have been sensible but they did little to exploit the Company's three major assets: goodwill, distribution machinery and capital. In the end it was the third of the three — and one piece of good fortune — which kept the monopoly alive, for Carnan's better standard of printing and more up-to-date approach to Almanack compilation soon began to eat into the Company's stock of goodwill, and George Robinson's network of provincial outlets, allied to the organization built up by John Newbery, successfully handled larger and larger numbers of books and sheets. It was, however, not immediately obvious how the financial reserves could best be employed. On 5 December 1775 Thomas Cadell, the treasurer of the Stationers' Fighting Fund, reported that nearly £1,500 had been spent on unsuccessful prosecutions for infringements of copyright and on unsuccessful approaches to Parliament. A year later £2,000 worth of Bank Stock, invested during the years of prosperity, was sold and, two years later, still a further £3,000 — with nothing to show for the expenditure. Even though the income of the English Stock from sources other than the trade in books and Almanacks — from house-property, from investments, from the Londonderry Estate, and from fines at elections to shares — was about £2,500 (enough to pay three quarters of the normal 12½% Dividend), the Company was worried. The House of Lords reached its decision in the case of Donaldson v. Becket on 22 February 1774. On 28 February two of the members for the City of London successfully moved the House of Commons on behalf of the booksellers and the Stationers' Company. By 26 May, in spite of a petition against it from provincial booksellers, a bill to reestablish perpetual copyright on the basis of a King's Bench decision of 1766 25 had passed through all its stages in the Commons; but since it was designed to reverse the verdict of the Peers it never reached the Statute Book. The Company was forced to lay more careful plans and it induced the Universities, which had suffered financially from the breaking of the Almanack monopoly, to support a bill investing the sole right to print Almanacks in the three interested parties. On 10 May 1779 Lord North, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, introduced such a bill in his capacity as Prime Minister. A petition from Carnan and the eloquence of Erskine are traditionally responsible for its defeat by 45 votes. The Company thereupon resorted to a manoeuvre based on its ability to raise capital; supported once again by the Universities, it prayed for a further increase in the Stamp Duty. For years it had cherished the protection afforded by the Duty; the only action taken in 1757 over the pirated Poor Robin in Leeds was to refer the report to the Stamp Office. The argument with which Lord North was provided in April 1781, for use in the House of Commons, came ostensibly from the printers of book Almanacks; they complained that they were losing work, as the Revenue was losing income, from the growing practice of printing sheet Almanacks, which carried 2 d. stamps, in such a way that they could be folded and bound as books, which ought to bear 4 d. stamps. (Old Jenour, the printer, had deduced — from the preponderance of sheets which Carnan in his 1779 petition claimed to have printed — that Carnan was alive to this dodge.) 26 North quoted figures to show that, out of a total of 577,000 stamps purchased for 1780, 316,000 had been for sheets and that, out of a similar total for the following year, the number for sheets had increased by 32,000 — a potential loss of over £2,500. The Prime Minister proposed to make good the loss by doubling the duty on sheets and to devote £1,000 of the extra revenue to compensate the Universities for the annuities which the Stationers' Company no longer paid. On 21 April Carnan petitioned against the bill; he maintained, perhaps rightly, that the Company had been the first to make, and the most persistent in making, a sheet serve as a book, and that the Universities had been paid to keep out of markets which were much more profitable than that for Almanacks; he produced figures to show that he had increased his purchases of 4 d. stamps and that he would be hard hit because he was making his sheet Almanacks pay. For once he was not successful; the House of Commons approved North's two proposals and initiated the practice of steady increases in Stamp Duties over the next forty years — a policy which was to suit the Stationers' Company well. For seven more years, however, the number of Almanacks distributed by the English Stock continued to fall annually by about 10,000 copies. Early in 1785 Richard Snagg, who ran from Paternoster Row a business similar to that of Carnan and Newbery, suggested to the Court of Assistants that, in view of the losses suffered by the Stock from the sale of Pocket Journals, the Company should either enter this market or persuade the Government to impose the same Duty on Diaries as book Almanacks were compelled to carry. The advice given by the Stockkeepers, to whom the suggestions were referred, is revealing. 27 In the first place, they pointed out that Diaries 'were originally set on foot by persons of reputation in the Trade [e.g. Robert Dodsley], whose representatives still continue to print them; [and that] however they may have been infringed upon by individuals [e.g. Thomas Carnan] the Stockkeepers apprehend it will be thought unbecoming the Company of Stationers to interfere with their inventions'. In the second place, they forsaw the risk that, if the Stamp Duty were extended, the publishers would include in Diaries the normal features of Almanacks and that any profit which the Company might gain from entering this market would be offset by the loss from the new competitors. In the third place, they were not convinced that the sales of Pocket Journals affected the sales of true Almanacks. The figures support the Stock-keepers' arguments. For the year 1768 — that is, when the Diaries had been openly published for twenty years and before Carnan began his direct piracy — the Company had paper stamped for 576,000 Almanacks. For the years 1780 and 1781, when Carnan was well in the field, the number of all Almanacks bearing stamps was 577,000. The London wholesalers' market for true Almanacks was remarkably constant and had to be fought for amongst those who were in that business. In the main it was Carnan who was building up his sales at the expense of the Company's; if he could be removed — by another offer of compensation, for instance — all might yet be well for the old monopolists. In 1788 he was removed — by death. Thomas Carnan died on 29 July in Hornsey Lane on the outskirts of Highgate; and on 20 August the Company acquired from the administrators of his estate all his Almanack interests. For £1,500, paid to them on 1 November, Francis Newbery and Carnan's sister, Anna Maria Smart the widow of Christopher Smart, assigned 28 the copyrights in all publications which were chargeable with Stamp Duty as Almanacks and promised not only to give up the Almanack trade but to refer all their customers to the Treasurer of the English Stock. The Company also agreed to pay the outlay on stamps and authors for the coming year (1789) and a further £500 when the prices of Moore's Vox Stellarum and Wing's Sheet Almanack had for three (not necessarily consecutive) years been raised by ½ d. The figures for 1789 and the following years are the outstanding proof of the success of Carnan's challenge — success, at least, as measured in terms of damage to the Company. It is unlikely that Carnan made much profit; he declared in his 1781 petition that, though he was making a little money on the County Almanacks before the Duty was increased, he had dropped two of the other kind and retained the large Sheet only 'to supply the Trade with Variety'. His chief satisfaction from dealing in Almanacks was, I imagine, his ability to say: 'I broke the monopoly'. I wish I knew more about the man himself. 29 From the autumn after Carnan's death it is possible, owing to the survival of fuller records, to follow in detail the mounting prosperity of the Company's Almanack business for the next fourteen years. A comparison of the first and last years of this series 30 shows that all the expenses went up and that in 1794 a new liability was incurred; this was an over-riding discount of 2% to London wholesalers, who between them handled more than £15,000 worth of the business in the autumn of 1801. (The turnover was then £24,890.) The astonishing feature of the other side of the account is the dominance of Moore, Old Moore; whereas the total number of Almanacks sold during this period increased by only 2%, with the old favourites like Poor Robin and Raven's falling back and the new County Almanacks, taken over from Carnan, doing rather better than holding their own, Moore came right away from the rest of the field and provided nearly 97% of the profit. 31 Of Moore alone the sales for 1802 were 365,000. 'There was scarcely a house in Southern England,' wrote Charles Knight 32 'in which this two shilling's worth of imposture was not to be found. There was scarcely a farmer who would cut his grass if the Almanack predicted rain. No cattle-doctor would give a drench to a cow unless he consulted the table in the Almanack showing what sign the moon is in, and what part of the body it governs.' But the profit was nearly £3,000 and the Company — 'the only Company who give bread to conjurors' 33 — was interested in making profits for the shareholders in the English Stock; it was no use giving their readers what they would not read — or, worse still, what they would not buy. A contributor to The Gentleman's Magazine in 1804 34 bewailed the decline in the certainties of the prognostications. 'What, in the name of wonder,' he asks, 'have prognosticators to do with hopes and fears?' But a writer thirty-five years later 35 tells of an experiment by the Company (which I am unable to corroborate) of 'partially reconciling Francis Moore and common sense by no greater step than omitting the column of the moon's influence on the parts of the human body'. The experiment was not repeated; farmers would not buy a Bowdlerized version and many thousands of unsold copies were returned. 'The company,' he concludes, 'appear to have acted from a simple desire to give people that which would sell,' — just like any successful modern publisher. It was not until 1927 that Old Moore with its sales down to 15,000 copies, was assigned to a modern publisher because, in the words of a member of the Stock Board, 'it does not enhance the reputation or dignity of the Company.' But, back in the 1790's the Assistants obviously regarded the overwhelming success of Moore as a healthy state of affairs for they altered the shareholding structure of the English Stock no fewer than five times between 1796 and 1805; they thereby increased the capital by £10,560 and the Dividend liability, which had been £3,200, by £1,320. Under the umbrella of the Stamp Duties the prosperity continued for nearly half a century and clearly showed that Carnan's breaking of the Almanack monopoly was immediately effective only for the fifteen years during which he lived to enjoy his triumph. His much advertized benefit to the public did not begin to be felt until the Almanack Duty was swept away in 1834. Thomas Carnan would, I think, have appreciated the twist by which his old rivals were partly responsible for this sensible move. In 1832 and 1833 deputations of Stationers waited upon the Commissioners of Stamps and upon Lord Althorp, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to bring to their notice once again the sales of vast numbers of unstamped Almanacks, to plead for greater severity in dealing with those caught selling them and to demand increased inquisitorial powers for the Company in order to track down the real offenders. Charles Knight and Henry Mayhew 36 bear witness to the quantities of unstamped Almanacks sold openly up and down the country; both saw that the only way to stop this flagrant breaking of the law was to remove the cause of offence. The petitions for more power turned into further reasons for the abolition of the Stamp Duty in 1834. Even Carnan, for all the severity of his lesson, had not been able to teach the Stationers' Company that the good old days of the Stuart regime had come to an end before the death of Queen Anne.

Francis was the nephew, not the son, of John Newbery; he was the son of Francis, baker of Easthampsted, Berks, and was apprenticed to William Faden, printer of Wine Office Court, on 3 Aug. 1756 (no premium); he was free on 4 Sept. 1764 and was never called to the Livery. 9 The London Chronicle , 22-24 Nov. 1757.

His declaration was published in, among other newspapers, The London Chronicle , 2-5 Nov. 1776 and reprinted as part of Carnan's petition to the House of Commons of 29 April 1779. Carnan had printed the story, unattested, as part of his advertising campaign in 1775—in The London Chronicle of 5-7 Dec., for instance. The advertisements of Carnan and the Company, appearing as they sometimes do one above the other, make engaging reading. 13 The London Evening Post , 19-22 Nov., 1776, where he advertised eight of the Almanacks which he and Carnan had published jointly the year before. The full text of his statement reads as follows: 'Mr. T. Carnan having asserted, in a circular letter, that he was the only person who prevented a compromise with the Stationers Company, it becomes necessary for me to declare, that the project of printing an almanack, and to try the legality of it, was originally mine; and that I admitted Mr. Carnan to be concerned with me, at his earnest request. With respect to the compromise, I can with great truth aver, that I never had the least intention to drop my scheme; and that no offer was ever made to me on the subject, which I could believe to be serious. The intelligent public will therefore judge what degree of credit is due to a man, who is capable of asserting whatever is likely to answer his self-interested purposes.' What is 'the intelligent public' to make of a statement by a man who admits, by implication, to degrees of truth? 14 It may be pure coincidence that in the winter of 1774-5 the Stock-keepers were flirting with the possibility of lending £10,000 at 4½% on the security of freeholds in Monmouthshire and Buckinghamshire. 15 On 26 Oct. 1775 it made the last payment to Messrs Wright &amp; Gill, the farmers of the Oxford privilege, and on 28 June 1776 the last to the Vice Chancellor at Cambridge; the threat of legal action two years later was successfully met with a bland reply. 16 See Table I, p. 40. 17 Mr. Graham Pollard has suggested to me that the advantage which the Stationers' Company may have had from its ability to raise capital was not as great as I have assumed, and that wholesale stationers were perhaps as ready to supply stamped paper on credit for the printing of Almanacks as they were to do this for the printing of newspapers. I have no evidence for or against this possibility; I can only say that stationers were, at this period, keener supporters of the Company than the booksellers, and more interested in becoming partners in the English Stock.

This is plainly nonsense. The English Stock suffered a set-back of £2,000, from a profit of about £1,500 to a loss of over £400; some of this derived from the cut in prices, some from a drop in sales and some, perhaps, from an improvement in the terms offered to the trade as a reply to Carnan's boast in a 1775 advertisement that a 'greater Allowance will be made to the Dealers in Almanacks than ever was given before'. From 1784 the Company incurred a small additional expense by following the growing practice in the trade and instituting a Subscription Dinner at the beginning of November and a Customers' Dinner, later in the month, when stocks were delivered. 25 In the case of Millar v.

      <field name="heading_text">The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (VI) by Cyrus Hoy *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher canon to be considered in what follows pose authorial problems of considerable complexity, and the linguistic evidence is not always sufficient to account for all the dramatists who appear to be present in them. Two plays, The Captain and Love's Cure , I am now persuaded, contain the work of Beaumont, and should by rights have been treated in section three of this monograph; they bring to a total of fourteen the number of plays in the canon in which Beaumont's work is present. The Captain is, in the main, the work of Fletcher, but Beaumont has, I think, contributed four scenes in Acts IV and V; and, to judge from the diminished occurrence of the Fletcherian ye , he has given the play its final form. Love's Cure , in its extant text, is very largely the work of Massinger, but there are sections of the play which are clearly not Massinger's, and in a detailed examination of the play below, I attempt to show that what the extant text represents is a Massinger revision of a Beaumont and Fletcher original. The Tragedy of Rollo, Duke of Normandy contains the work of Fletcher and Massinger, but it contains as well the work of two other dramatists. Studies of the play's authorship prior to this one have suggested Chapman and Jonson as the dramatists responsible for the non-Fletcher, non-Massinger sections of Rollo , and in my discussion of the play below, I present such linguistic evidence as is available for their presence in it. The Captain Beaumont: IV,4. Fletcher: I-IV,3; V,1-2. Beaumont and Fletcher: V,3-5. About this play, two things are immediately certain: (1) that Fletcher is not the sole author, and (2) that his share of the play has been altered in some measure by another. Both these facts are deducible from the evidence of ye in the folio text of the play. From the outset, its occurrence is suspiciously low, and it decreases steadily throughout the play, from a total of 40 times in Act I, to 26 times in Act II, 21 times in Act III, 17 times in Act IV, and 3 times in Act V. But though the low occurrence of ye implies that Fletcher is not responsible for the final form of his share in the extant text of The Captain , I think that all of the play from the beginning through IV,3 is essentially his. To that point, ye is found sprinkled at some rate throughout every scene but three; only in III,1 (where you occurs 8 times), III,6 ( you once), and IV,1 ( you 9 times) does ye fail to appear. And of these, III,1 certainly contains traces of Fletcher's work. The structure of such a line as Julio's reference to the courtesan Lelia: "I dare see her / Were she as catching as the plague, and deadly" is typically Fletcherian, this being his characteristic manner of phrasing comparisons (cf. The Loyal Subject , II,5: "as bounteous as the aire, and open"; The Humourous Lieutenant , I,1: "as sudden . . . / As arrowes from a Tartars bow, and speeding"; Valentinian , IV,4: "more glorious then my life, and lasting"; Rule a Wife , V,1: "I had thought he had been a Devil. / He made as many noises and as horrible"; The Pilgrim , I,1: "her sweet humor / That is as easy as a calme, and peacefull"). It is, I think, only with the long and important IV,4 that we are in the presence of a second dramatist. The scene contains but a single ye , as against 64 you 's. It contains as well all 3 of the play's occurrences of the non-Fletcherian verb form doth . This is the notorious scene between the courtesan and her father, and its authorship has occasioned much interested speculation. It is masterfully done in its kind, and while its kind is not essentially un-Fletcherian, its verse—a regular pentameter measure after the prose exchange of the first 76 lines—to say nothing of the pattern of linguistic preferences which it displays, decidedly is. In seeking the identity of Fletcher's collaborator here, it seems unnecessary, finally, to look beyond Beaumont. Oliphant ( The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher , pp. 164-167) came to this opinion at last; and even C. M. Gayley ( Beaumont, the Dramatist , p. 306), who was inclined to deny Beaumont's presence in The Captain because it displayed "no vestige of his faith in sweet innocence," conceded that if any scene exhibited "his imaginative elevation or his dramatic creativity," it was this one (both Oliphant and Gayley refer to the scene as IV,5, but the folio designation IV,4 is correct). The lines with which Angelo opens the scene—"I cannot keepe from this ungodly woman, / This Lelia , whom I know too, yet am caught"—and the remainder of his speech (an admixture of verse and prose) in which he explains how, knowing the worst, he yet pursues it, convey precisely that wry sense of human frailty which I will have occasion to note below in Beaumont's handling of a similar occasion in Love's Cure . There are traces of Fletcher's extra-metrical blank verse in IV,4 of The Captain (notably, at the point of Lelia's recognition of her father, where the scene's sole ye occurs), but Beaumont's hand is the predominant one. The 3 ye 's of Act V are contained in the first two scenes. It is probably inevitable that the single ye of V,2 is contained in Clora's speech instructing the maid to empty the contents of a chamber pot on the head of the woman-hating Jacamo. And on this characteristic note, Fletcher's share in the play, so far as the linguistic evidence is concerned, ends. His presence can be traced—in the verse, and in sundry turns of phrase—through the last three scenes, but here his work is inextricably mingled with what I take to be Beaumont's. In V,4, for instance, the manner in which the woman-hating Captain Jacamo is dragged to a chair and forcibly held in it while a young maiden declares her love for him is reminiscent at first of the scene in which Gondarino is tormented by the ladies in V,5 of The Woman Hater , a scene in which Fletcher has been shown to have had a share ( SB , XI, 98-99, 106). But where Gondarino is never cast from his humour, Jacamo is won by what he hears (he has thought no woman could love him), and by the end has come to seem less like the egregious misogynist that is, essentially, Beaumont's creation, than one of Fletcher's rough diamonds. It will be understood that the attribution set forth above is only approximate. Fletcher, as I have already indicated, seems to be present at one point, at least, in Beaumont's IV,4. And Beaumont, to judge from the diminished occurrence of Fletcher's ye , gave the final form to the whole of the play through IV,3, as well as the first two scenes of Act V. If he did not give the final form to the Prologue that follows the text in the 1647 folio (as, to judge from the 2 ye 's and the single y' , he did not), his presence is nonetheless felt: To please you with this Play, we feare will be (So does the Author too) a mystery Somewhat above our Art . . .. For to say truth, and not to flatter ye, This is nor Comody, nor Tragedy, Nor History, nor anything that may (Yet in a weeke) be made a perfect Play: Yet those that love to laugh . . ., May stumble on a foolish toy, or two Will make 'em shew their teeth . . .. Again we are reminded of The Woman Hater : specifically, of what is said in the Prologue prefixed to the 1607 quarto edition of that play (Sig. A2): I dare not call it Comedie, or Tragedie; 'tis perfectly neyther: A Play it is, which was meant to make you laugh . . .. The theory that The Captain is the joint work of Beaumont and Fletcher need not founder on the Prologue's reference to "the Author." The Prologue to The Woman Hater twice refers to a single author ("he that made this Play," "he, that made this"), and it, as we know, contains the work of both Beaumont and Fletcher (cf. SB , XI, 98-99). Love's Cure Beaumont: III,1,3b (from entrance of Malroda to Malroda's "Do ye ask?"). Fletcher: II,2a (to first exit of Bobadilla); III,3a (to entrance of Malroda), 5. Massinger: I,1,3; IV,1-3a (to entrance of Alvarez, Lucio, Bobadilla), 3c (from entrance of Alguazier to end), 4; V,1-2, 3c (final speech). Beaumont and Fletcher: II,1, 2c (from Clara's "No, he do's not" to end); V,3b (from Bobadilla's "I am not regarded" to final speech). Fletcher and Massinger: I,2; II,2b (from first exit of Bobadilla to Clara's "No, he do's not"); III,2, 3c (from Malroda's "Do ye ask?" to end), 4; IV,3b (from entrance of Alvarez, Lucio, Bobadilla to entrance of Alguazier). Beaumont, Fletcher and Massinger: V,3a (to Bobadilla's "I am not regarded"). The one certainty about the authorship of this play is the presence of Massinger. In the only extant text, that of the 1647 folio, he is responsible for virtually all of Acts I, IV, and V. The great authorial problem which the play poses centers upon the authorship of the non-Massinger scenes, all of which, with the exception of the prose passages of I,2 and V,3b, occur in Acts II and III. Oliphant (pp. 431-432) regarded Love's Cure "as originally written by Beaumont" prior to 1605, "revised by Jonson and another in 1622," and revised again, "this time by Massinger," probably in the early 1630's. There is external evidence for revision in the 1647 folio text of the play, with its alternative title The Martial Maid , and its prologue spoken "At the reviving of this Play." Oliphant's theory of a Jonsonian revision, however, can be safely dismissed; there is no shred of evidence for positing Jonson's presence in the play. Revised the play has certainly been, and there is no doubt at all that the reviser was Massinger. But it is necessary to assume no more than a single revision to account for the evidences of multiple authorship which the extant text displays if one makes the further assumption that what was revised was, not as Oliphant conjectured, the unaided work of Beaumont, but the joint work of Beaumont and Fletcher. That Massinger is present in Love's Cure as reviser, and not as one of the original authors, is evident, among other things, from the extent of his share in the extant version. It is not credible that Massinger's contribution to a play written in collaboration with Beaumont and Fletcher prior to 1613 (the date of Beaumont's retirement from the theatre) should far exceed the combined shares of both his more celebrated associates. Then, as one examines the folio text, one comes to see that Massinger's work is not altogether confined to Acts I, IV, and V; there are traces of his presence in Acts II and III as well (notably in II,2 and III,2-3). The play has been re-worked, in some degree, from beginning to end, but it has been re-worked much more extensively in some places than in others. Massinger's revision of the first and the last two acts has been so extensive as to amount to re-writing, though there are faint traces of the original in the prose of I,2, and distinctly clearer ones in that of V,3b. His handling of Acts II and III was much less thoroughgoing; there he has been content to stitch some of his favorite turns of phrase on to a textual fabric clearly not of his own devising. The linguistic evidence which the folio text affords seems at first glance pitifully scant, but to the practiced eye it tells its story, and its story confirms all that I have just conjectured about the authority of the extant version of the play. It is no accident that all 27 occurrences of ye in the folio text occur either in Act II, Act III, or in the prose passage near the end of Act V which I have designated as V,3b: that is to say, in the non-Massinger portion of the play. The occurrence of hath , which is found in the play 27 times as well, complements the occurrence of ye in a manner that is familiar. The tendency here, as with the joint work of Fletcher and Massinger elsewhere, is to find ye and hath appearing solely in alternating scenes, but seldom together in the same scene. Thus Acts I, IV, and V (excluding V,3b) of Love's Cure contain 20 hath 's, no ye 's. Of the 7 remaining hath 's in the play, Beaumont may be responsible for the two that appear in Act III. But the 5 hath 's that are found anomalously occurring side by side with the 9 ye 's of Fletcher's II,2 are almost certainly evidence of Massinger's revising hand. Massinger, in the scenes to be attributed to him, typically prefers the full pronominal form them to the contraction 'em. His Act I contains 5 them 's, no 'em 's; his Act IV, 11 them 's, 1 'em ; his share of Act V, 5 them 's, 2 'em 's. Elsewhere in the play, the preference is reversed. Act II contains 8 'em 's, 4 them 's; Act III, 6 'em 's, 2 them 's; V,3b, 3 'em 's, no them 's. The play's 6 occurrences of o'th' (which appears thrice as o'the ) are all found in Acts II and III. Of the play's 7 occurrences of i'th' , 6 are found in Acts II and III, one in Massinger's Act I, where it appears as i'the ; and i'the , as I had occasion to note at the very outset of the present study ( SB , VIII, 144-145), is the form of the contraction for in the which Massinger appears to prefer on the infrequent occasions when he uses one. The play contains 2 occurrences of contractions in 's for his , a form which is found only 3 times in Massinger's fifteen unaided plays; here both occurrences appear in non-Massinger scenes: one in III, 3a, one in V,3b. The play's 3 occurrences of ha' for have are all contained in Act III. This is a form which occurs in none of Massinger's unaided plays. Elsewhere in the present study ( SB , XI, 88 ff.) I have noted Beaumont's use of the form; he is, I think, responsible for its appearance in the extant text of Love's Cure . In the opening section of the present study ( SB , VIII, 144-145), I discussed the use of the contraction t' for to as evidence for the work of Massinger. There are 6 occurrences of t' in the folio text of Love's Cure , and all are found in scenes which bear the heaviest stamp of Massinger's presence: one in Act I, 5 in Act IV. Finally, the play contains 2 occurrences of doth , one in III,4, the other in V,3b. Both, I think, point to the presence of Beaumont, who, as I have shown elsewhere ( SB , XI, 86 ff.) employs the form with much greater frequency than either Fletcher or Massinger, in whose unaided work doth rarely occurs (cf. SB , VIII, 145). Thus the linguistic evidence leaves no mystery about what is Massinger and what is non-Massinger in the extant text of Love's Cure . But to determine what, in the non-Massinger portion, is Beaumont, what is Fletcher, what is an inextricable blend of both, and to what extent Massinger the reviser is present in this, the section of the play which he did not re-write, is a harder matter. In so far as one can judge of the original version of Love's Cure on the basis of what remains of it in Acts II and III of the extant text, I think it likely that individual scenes contained much composite writing; at any rate, nearly every scene of the present Acts II and III shows signs of both Beaumont and Fletcher. With regard to the evidence of the Fletcherian ye in the extant text, one hardly knows whether to marvel that it has survived at all in a play to which, originally, Beaumont might have been expected to give the final form, and which has undergone a subsequent revision by Massinger, or whether to seek in one or both of these alterations an explanation for the form's low rate of occurrence. Doubtless some of Fletcher's ye 's have disappeared under Massinger's revising hand. But I think it is significant that as many ye 's survive as do, especially in the context of scenes that otherwise bear the strong stamp of Beaumont's presence. If Beaumont has made any attempt to change the Fletcherian ye to you in accordance with his own practice, it has not been a very thoroughgoing one—nothing in the manner of such other Beaumont and Fletcher collaborations to which Beaumont demonstrably gave the final form as The Coxcomb, Philaster, The Maid's Tragedy , and A King and no King . The collaboration in Acts II and III of Love's Cure resembles far more what we have observed of the joint work of the two dramatists in The Woman Hater , where the ye 's that mark Fletcher's contribution to Beaumont's play stand forth in conspicuous isolation (cf. SB , XI, 98-99). In this, I think, there is evidence that Love's Cure , in its original form, was one of the earliest of the Beaumont and Fletcher collaborations. Here, as in The Woman Hater , the two dramatists have joined forces without, apparently, deeming it necessary to impose on the finished product any such uniform pattern of linguistic preferences as Beaumont came to impose on their later, more polished collaborations. There are further connections between this play and the early Woman Hater . In II,1 of Love's Cure , which I think is essentially the work of Beaumont, we are introduced to the character of Lazarillo, the hungry knave. Oliphant (p. 429) is probably right in viewing "the ravenous glutton of this play" as a first sketch of his more fully drawn namesake in The Woman Hater . At least one verbal parallel dealing with the two characters connects the two plays. In II,1 of Love's Cure , Pachieco, Lazarillo's master, instructs his man in the virtues of fasting: "I will make thee immortall, change thy humanitie into dietie, for I will teach thee to live upon nothing" (129a). * And Pachieco caps his argument against eating with a bit of syllogistic reasoning: Be abstinent; shew not the corruption of thy generation: he that feeds, shall die, therefore he that feeds not, shall live. (129a) In Beaumont's II,1 of The Woman Hater , the Count, speaking of the Lazarillo of that play, presents the reverse side of the argument: He knowes that man is mortall by his birth; He knowes that men must dye, and therefore liue; He knowes that man must liue, and therefore eate . . .. (Q 1607, sigs. D1-D1 v ) But if II,1 of Love's Cure is essentially Beaumont's, there is evidence, however slight, that Fletcher is also present. The scene contains 5 ye 's. Three of these occur in two consecutive lines of dialogue: in the Alguazier's "I know you not: what are ye? hence ye base Besegnios," and in Pachieco's reply: "do'ye not know us?" (130a) Whether Fletcher wrote these lines is beyond proof, but I think it probable that he did; and I expect the scene's two remaining ye 's—which occur in widely separated speeches, one by Pachieco (129b), one by Lazarillo (130b) — are signs of Fletcher's presence as well. The action of II,2 falls into three distinct parts: (a) an opening scene of comic horseplay between Lucio and Bobadilla, joined by Clara, which occupies the first 164 lines, to the first exit of Bobadilla; (b) an intermediate scene of 26 lines, during which the stage is cleared of Alvarez, Bobadilla (for the second time), and Lucio, and Vitelli is shown on; (c) a final scene of 106 lines in which Clara and Vitelli declare their mutual love. The scene as a whole contains a total of 9 ye 's. Of these, 6 occur in (a), one in (b), and 2 in (c). II,2a is, essentially, the unaided work of Fletcher; II,2b is unaided Fletcher revised by Massinger; II,2c is, essentially, unaided Beaumont. It may be that Massinger is present as reviser in this last section of the scene, as well as in the preceding section (b). And it may be that the original of II,2c contained the work of Fletcher; the 2 ye 's that survive in the extant text at this point may be evidence of his presence. The fact that one of these appears in the phrase "My vow hath offerd to ye" (132b), where the Fletcherian ye and the un-Fletcherian hath appear together in the same line, may point to the presence of the revising Massinger. It is the movement of the blank verse in which the whole of the Clara-Vitelli love scene is cast that points to Beaumont as the principal presence in II,2c. The sustained use of verse throughout the last 106 lines of the scene is itself striking, verse having occurred but fitfully amid the prose that predominates, not only through the earlier part of this scene, but through the whole of Act II to this point. What I take to be Beaumont's blank verse continues through III,1, a scene which I regard as wholly his. Everything about III,2, on the other hand—its content, its large number of extra-metrical blank verse lines, to say nothing of its 2 ye' s—points to Fletcher, revised by Massinger; I see in it no trace of Beaumont. And from considerations of the verse and the vocabulary alone, neither ye nor you occurring in the passage in question, I think Fletcher responsible for the first 22 lines of III,3, to the entrance of Malroda. But what immediately follows can redound to the credit of no one but Beaumont. The courtesan Malroda's finely extravagant speech beginning "Leave your betraying smiles," and Vitelli's reply, with its musing sense of the ridiculousness of human conduct—aiming so high, falling so low, and consistently failing to profit from experience—are the finest things in the play. Malroda's following speech beginning "Do'ye ask?" presumably signals the return of Fletcher. He may, in fact, have returned five and a half lines before this, at the close of Vitelli's afore-mentioned speech. Vitelli concludes with an appeal to the tears of his sometime mistress: Oh, those tears If they were true, and righ[t]ly spent, would raise A flowry spring ith' midst of January: Celestiall Ministers with Christall cups Would stoop to save 'em for immortall drink: (135b). This is very close, both in sentiment and in phrasing, to the following from Fletcher's I,3 of The Captain : Oh faire teares were you but as chast, as subtill, Like Bones of Saints, ye would worke miracles (51a) In any case, Fletcher's hand is decidedly the predominant one through the last 54 lines of the scene, though inevitably what we are dealing with in the extant text is Fletcher revised by Massinger. The dislocated proportion of ye 's (found twice) to you 's (found 26 times) in III,3c is evidence of Massinger's presence. So is such a tag as Vitelli's "Madnesse transports you," a speech formula distinctly in the Massinger manner. The single ha' in III,3c, with the two additional occurrences of the form in the following III,4, together with the single occurrences of hath and doth in the latter scene, may be traces of Beaumont. But III,4, with its 7 ye 's, like the preceding III,3c, is basically Fletcher's, revised by Massinger. The brief III,5, a prose scene, I attribute to Fletcher on purely verbal grounds. Ye does not occur in it, though you is found 6 times. But the scene provides several verbal parallels with what I regard as Fletcher's work elsewhere in this play. For instance, "fall to brabling" in III,5 echoes "I did never brable" in Fletcher's II,2b. The reference in III,5 to "rug-gownes" sets up verbal echoes in all directions: in "watch for rug" in IV, 3b, a Fletcher scene as I will presently show, and in two separate passages from what I take to be Fletcher's contribution to II,1: "sate snoaring cheeke by joll with your signiorie in rug at midnight," and "thy beares skin ( viz . thy Rug-gowne)." The viz . of the last passage itself has a parallel earlier in the same II,1: in Pachieco's words to the Botcher, "thou art a hider of enormities, viz. scabs, chilblaines, and kibed heeles"; four lines later in the same speech occurs one of the scene's 5 ye 's. And so by a circuitous route, the "rug-gownes" of III,5 become associated with the parenthetical viz .'s of II,1, and ultimately with the Fletcherian ye . Act IV, as I have already stated, has been virtually re-written by Massinger. His presence is clearly evident throughout IV,1-2, and the first 21 lines of IV,3. From the entrance of Alvarez, Lucio, and Bobadilla to the entrance of "Alguazier, Assistente and other Watches" we are dealing, I think, with what is basically the work of Fletcher. This section of the scene—IV,3b—contains no ye 's, Massinger having presumably given it its extant form; but verbally the passage is of a piece with Fletcher's work in the play elsewhere. Here we have the aforementioned reference to rug gowns; and Alvarez's threat to his son a few lines later: "I will beat thee dead / Then bray the in a morter, and new [F 1647: now] mold thee," is a direct echo of the same character's similar threat concerning both his children in Fletcher's II,2a: "I will rectifie, / and redeem eithers proper inclination, / Or bray 'em in a morter, and new mold 'em." I think that Massinger is responsible for the remainder of IV,3, all of IV,4, and the whole of V,1-2. The first 242 lines of V,3 bear strong evidences of Massinger, and yet traces of the original are discernible beneath his revision, and the original would appear to have been, authorially, of a composite nature. Thus Vitelli's boast to Alvarez: upon thy death Ile build A story (with this arme) for thy old wife To tell thy daughter Clara seven yeeres hence As she sits weeping by a winter fire, (144b) reminds one of Viola's "I have made a story, / Will serve to wast many a winters fier / When we are old," from Beaumont's V,2 of The Coxcomb (114b). And near the end of V,3a there are unmistakable traces of Fletcher. Sayavedra's comment, "A gallant undertaking and a happie" is a Fletcherian line if ever there was one. The schematic pattern of article-adjective-noun-"and"-article-a second adjective is a recurrent feature of Fletcher's rhetoric (cf. e.g., "A hard choice, and a fatall" [ Valentinian , III,3]; "A stout man, and a true" [ The Loyal Subject , I,3]; "a neat one, and a perfect" [ A Wife for a Month , I,2]; "a sweet bud and a beauteous" [ Ibid. , III,2]; "a new death, and an odious" [ Ibid. , V,3]; "a right one and a perfect" [ Rule a Wife , II,1]; cf. as well Fletcher's work in collaboration: "a goodly protection, and a gracious" [ Philaster , IV,1]; "a strange Iustice and a lamentable" [ Cupid's Revenge , IV,3]). And Alvarez's words to his daughter a few lines later apropos of her prospective husband—"if he bring not / Betwixt you, boyes that will finde out new worlds, / And win 'em too I'm a false Prophet" (145b) —are stamped with Fletcher's particular brand of jollity. The passage of 69 lines—extending from Bobadilla's speech beginning "I am not regarded" and continuing to the final speech—has been salvaged from the original. With its 2 ye 's, 3 'em 's, and single doth , it is best regarded as the composite work of Beaumont and Fletcher. The play's final speech is certainly Massinger's. Vitelli is commenting on Clara's wonderous change from a martial maid to a gentle mistress: Behold the power of love, to nature lost By custome irrecoverably, past the hope Of friends restoring, love hath here retriv'd To her own habit, made her blush to see Her so long monstrous metamorphoses, May strange affaires never have worse successe. (146b) It is the next to last line which points to Massinger as the author of this. If ever a dramatist can be said to have his favorite words, "metamorphosis" is one of Massinger's (cf. The City Madam , IV,4: "What a strange, nay monstrous Metamorphosis"; cf. also The Picture , IV,1; The Guardian , II,3; The Bashful Lover , IV,3). But it is not the occurrence of the word alone that identifies the line as Massinger's; the construction of the line itself, with its "so long" followed by adjective and noun, is typically Massingerian (cf. e.g., "Such a Princesse, / And of so long experienc'd reservednesse" [ The Maid of Honour , IV,4]; "my so long try'd loyalty" [ The Guardian , III,6]; cf. as well Massinger's work in collaboration: "your so long congealde and flinty hardnesse" [ Thierry and Theodoret , IV,2]; "those so long wishd embraces" [ The Knight of Malta , IV,1]). A word should be said of the manuscript behind the extant text. On the evidence of the marginal stage direction "2 Torches / ready" (137a) in III,4, the folio text was printed from a prompt book. It would appear to have been a prompt book prepared either from foul papers or a transcript of these. The long final scene has apparently been marked for two theatrical cuts of, respectively, 19 and 27 lines which were never actually made in the prompt book, but the cues for which survive in the folio text in the otherwise inexplicable repetition of two speeches. Genevora's line: " Lamorall : you have often sworne / You'ld be commanded by me" (145a) is repeated 19 lines later (145b), where, following Lamorall's answer, her reply "Your hearing for six words" anticipates by 27 lines the point at which it is repeated, this time in a speech of Eugenia's. Rollo, Duke of Normandy Chapman: III,1a (to Edith's "O stay there Duke"), 1c (from entrance of Citizens to end); IV,3. Fletcher: II; III,1b (from Edith's "O stay there Duke" to entrance of Citizens), 2; V,2b (from stage direction: "Sophia, Matilda, Aubrey, / and Lords at the doore" to end). Jonson: IV,1-2. Massinger: I; V,1a (to exit of Hamond). Fletcher and Massinger: V,1b (from exit of Hamond to end); 2a (to stage direction: "Sophia, Matilda, Aubrey, / and Lords at the doore"). This play is extant in two quarto editions: the first published in 1639, where it is titled The Bloody Brother , and ascribed to "B. J. F"; the second published in 1640, where the play is called The Tragoedy of Rollo Duke of Normandy , and attributed to Fletcher alone. Each quarto derives from an independent manuscript. The manuscript behind Q2, to judge from the stage direction "A Stoole set out" at the head of III,1 (sig. D3), would appear, as Prof. J. D. Jump, the play's most recent editor, suggests, to have been "either a prompt-book or a manuscript in the direct line of descent from a prompt-book" ( Rollo Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother , 1948, p. xii). The manuscript behind Q1, on the other hand, according to Prof. Jump, was "of a more 'literary' type" (p. xiii); it seems, he conjectures, "to have been the work of a scribe who took it upon himself to edit the text," modernizing certain Massingerian idioms and spellings, and almost invariably altering the Fletcherian ye to you ( Jump , p. xiv). It is this last point which is of most importance to the present study. Of the 51 ye 's that appear in Q2, only 4 are found in Q1. This is typical of Q1 practice with regard to the linguistic forms displayed in Q2. The contraction 'em , for instance, is used 32 times in Q2; it occurs but 18 times in Q1. The contraction i'th' is found 9 times in Q2, but only thrice in Q1. Comparison of the two quarto texts of Rollo provides yet another striking example of what happens when, as in the case of Q1, a work is transmitted through the offices of a scribe who has not seen fit to reproduce the linguistic forms that stood in his manuscript copy. The authoritative text of the play is, clearly, that of the second quarto, and any account of the formidable authorial problem which the play poses must be based on it. We are dealing, in Rollo , with the work of four authors, two of whom are demonstrably Fletcher and Massinger. Their shares present no real difficulty. Though the occurrence of ye , even in Q2, seems somewhat low, it is sufficient to show that Fletcher is the author of the whole of Act II; III,2; the last 97 lines of V,2; and a highly charged emotional outburst in the midst of the otherwise non-Fletcherian III,1. In at least two places, there are signs of composite writing on the part of Fletcher and Massinger. Fletcher is almost certainly responsible for Aubrey's speech beginning "I am both waies ruin'd, both waies mark'd for slaughter," near the end of Massinger's V,1. The speech contains neither ye 's nor you 's, but the extra-metrical blank verse of its first 23 lines is characteristically Fletcherian, as are the repetitions in such a pair of lines as these (V,1,105-6 of Prof. Jump's edition): "Am I afraid of death? of dying nobly? / Of dying in my innocence uprightly?" And yet, by the time the speech has come to an end, it would appear that we are once again in the presence of Massinger: And though it [death] beare, beyond what Poets feigne, A punishment; duty shall meet that paine, And my most constant heart to doe him good, Shall check at neither pale affright nor bloud. Here the verse has flowed back into its regular blank verse channels; and the reference to feigning poets is very much in Massinger's manner (cf. The Maid of Honour , IV,4: "Wise Poets faine that Venus coach is draw'n / By doues, and sparrowes"; A New Way to Pay Old Debts , III,3: "beleeve the Poet / Fain'd not but was historicall, when he wrote / Pasiphae was enamour'd of a bull." Massinger makes repeated allusions to the authority of "Poets" or "the Poet." Cf. as well Believe as you List , I,1 and V,1; The City Madam , III,2; The Roman Actor , IV,2; The Parliament of Love , I,4). I think it likely that Massinger is present as well, together with Fletcher, at the beginning of V,2. Such a line as V,2,26 of Prof. Jump's edition, "The gentle sacrifice of love and service," echoes "this last tryall of my sacrifice / Of loue, and seruice" from III,2 of Massinger's Roman Actor . And Rollo's apostrophe to Edith at V,2,39-41: The sweetnesse of th'Arabian winde still blowing, Vpon the treasures of perfumes and spices, In all their pride and pleasures call thee Mistris employs a number of verbal strands that Massinger frequently associates elsewhere (cf. e.g., "those smooth gales that glide / O're happy Arabie, or rich Sabaea, / Creating in their passage gummes and spices" [ The Great Duke of Florence , II,3]; "Like a soft Westerne wind, when it glides o're / Arabia , creating gummes, and spices" [ A New Way , III,1]; "Beyond all perfumes or Sabean spices" [ The Bashful Lover , I,1]). It is surely significant that ye —which occurs in this scene only 6 times, as against 36 occurrences of you —does not appear in the first 135 lines. All occurrences of the form, together with the scene's 6 occurrences of the contraction ' em , are contained in the last 97 lines of the scene. On the other hand, the single occurrence of hath in V,2 appears at line 38, immediately preceding Rollo's already quoted tribute to Edith. Such linguistic evidence as this, together with the evidence of such verbal parallels as the early part of the scene exhibits with Massinger's acknowledged work, makes it clear, I think, that he has revised in some measure the first 135 lines of Fletcher's V,2 (to the stage direction, that is to say, which has "Sophia, Matilda, Aubrey, / and Lords at the doore"). But Massinger is not present in the play simply as a reviser. He is solely responsible for the whole of Act I, and for all of V,1 with the exception of the aforementioned speech of Aubrey (which is to say, to the exit of Hamond). However, when we have determined the extent of the shares of Fletcher and Massinger in Rollo , we are left with the problem of the authorship of the non-Fletcherian portion of Act III, and the whole of Act IV. The part of the play that is in question here cannot be the work of a single dramatist. The author of III,1a and 1c, and of IV,3 is much given to the use of rhyming pentameter couplets; the author of IV,1-2 employs a regular blank verse measure. In his edition of the play, Prof. Jump (p. xxvii), following the lead of W. Wells, identifies Chapman as the author of III,1a and 1c, and IV,3; following the lead of C. Crawford and R. Garnett, he identifies Jonson as the author of IV,1-2. I will consider the possibility of Jonson's presence in the play first. Linguistic evidence for Jonson's last five plays is given in tabular form below. I have chosen these five plays as sources of linguistic evidence for Jonson because they represent his dramatic output during the period (1614-1632) to which the composition of Rollo is generally assigned (the play has been variously dated from 1613 to 1625, with the weight of the evidence pointing to the later date [see Jump , pp. xxx-xxxi]). As is well known, Jonson had strong preferences among contractions, and these are apparent in his last five plays no less than in those, the printing of which he so carefully attended to, published in the 1616 folio edition of his Works . Instead of the more familiar pronominal contraction ' em for them , Jonson regularly uses 'hem . The contractions that appear in other dramatists' work as i'th' and o'th' appear in Jonson as i'the and o'the . He occasionally uses ye and contractions in y' , but the more usual contraction for you found in his work is yo' . H'as (for he has ) often appears as h'has . He makes frequent use of ha ' for have . With the exception of h'has , all the contracted forms that I have designated as Jonsonian are present in one or the other of the two quartos of Rollo , but they are present only in a very slight degree, and in the case of Q1, in a manner which raises rather more problems than it solves. 'Hem appears twice in the Q1 text of Rollo , once in II,1, once in II,2. And though Fletcher's is the predominant hand in both scenes, both have in fact been claimed for Jonson by G. C. Macauley in the Cambridge History of English Literature (Vol. V, pp. 129, 138). But Macauley's attribution has not, in general, been viewed with favor, and one would be inclined to write off both occurrences of the form as the vagaries of the scribe who prepared the Q1 manuscript, or one of the three or more compositors who, according to Prof. Jump (pp. ix-x), were engaged in setting the 1639 quarto text, were it not for the fact that the 'hem of II,2 (II,2,13 of Prof. Jump's edition) occurs near the beginning of a passage (the Cook's description of a richly laden banquet table) which, within nine lines, has come, as all commentators on the play habitually note, to possess certain affinities with two passages of similar import from Jonson's Neptune's Triumph (lines 89-98 and 185-91), passages that Jonson re-used at, respectively, IV,2,19-29 and III,3,35-40 of The Staple of News . Such elements as the Cook's speech in II,2 of Rollo and the Jonsonian passages share are not, in fact, impressive as evidence for their common authorship, involving as they do conventional descriptions of fortifications in pastry, standing lakes of white broth, and, the ultimate culinary conceit, " Arion on a Dolphin." The Simpsons are probably right in denying Jonson's presence in the scene ( Ben Jonson , X, 293-295); still the fact that such a contraction as 'hem should occur at this of all places is at least arresting. 1 The only other piece of linguistic evidence which the Q1 text of Rollo affords, and which is even faintly suggestive of Jonsonian usage, is the single occurrence of the contraction w' for with , in the phrase 'Ile contend w'yee", near the end of IV,1 (sig. g1 v ). A. C. Partridge ( The Accidence of Ben Jonson's Plays, Masques &amp; Entertainments , 1953, p. 144) says that Jonson seems to use wi ' "before the and you ( r ), w' only before you in the conventional greeting ["God b'w'you"]." But I note at least one occasion on which Jonson uses w' in something other than the conventional greeting: in the 1631 folio text of Bartholomew Fair , (sig. L4), in the phrase "Came ouer w' you" (V,4,174 of the Herford and Simpson edition, where w' has been emended to w [ i ]'). When we turn to the text of the second quarto of Rollo , we find such evidence of Jonson's linguistic preferences as is present there to be confined to the first two scenes of Act IV, a fact which in itself might be taken as evidence of something, for these, as the Simpsons affirm ( Ben Jonson , X, 295) comprise the only part of the play "which shows any real affinity to Jonson's work." IV,1 displays a single occurrence of yo ' for you in the phrase "Yo'have woon upon me" (sig. G2 v ), and a single occurrence of o'the , Jonson's contraction for o'th' . The scene's 5 hath 's and single doth are in accord with Jonsonian usage as well. IV,2 displays a single occurrence of i'the (sig. H2), Jonson's contraction for i'th' , and 3 of the play's 4 occurrences of ha' for have. Hath appears 3 times, but doth does not occur. The most significant of these occurrences is, I think, the "Yo'have" of IV,1. The yo' contraction for you is a good deal rarer than might be imagined. Apart from its occurrence in the 1640 quarto text of Rollo , it appears elsewhere in the plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher canon but twice: once in the 1639 quarto of Fletcher's Monsieur Thomas , once in the 1647 folio text of Love's Pilgrimage . 2 Jonson uses the form more often than any other dramatist whose work has been examined in the course of the present study. In the five plays of his represented in the linguistic tables below, yo' does not occur in Bartholomew Fair , and it is found but once in The Staple of News . But it is used 6 times in The Magnetic Lady , 8 times in The New Inn , and 22 times in The Devil is an Ass . In the plays of the dramatists whose work I have considered to this point in the present study (Massinger, Field, Middleton, Rowley, Webster, Tourneur, and Ford), I note but a single occurrence of yo' : in the contraction "yo'are" in the 1633 quarto of Rowley's All's Lost by Lust . The linguistic evidence for Jonson's share in Rollo , after everything has been said in its favor, is pitifully slight; and yet I think that, taken together with the parallels of phrasing and thought which others have noted between the first two scenes of Act IV of this play and Jonson's acknowledged work, the six occurrences of four Jonsonian contractions (1 yo , 1 i'the , 1 o'the , 3 ha 's) in the authoritative Q2 text of IV,1-2 not only serve to support but, in their small way, to strengthen the arguments for Jonson's authorship of these scenes. The occurrence of the w' contraction in the Q1 text of IV,1 might be considered to corroborate, in some slight measure, the linguistic evidence for Jonson displayed in Q2, IV,1-2. What significance, if any, is to be attached to the equivocal 'hem 's of Q1, II,1-2, I will not presume to say. The evidential value of both these Q1 contractions is diminished by the fact that neither is altogether unknown elsewhere in the plays of the canon. I note 7 occurrences of w' for with in the 1637 quarto text of Fletcher and Massinger's The Elder Brother , and 'hem is found 4 times in Fletcher's Pilgrim . As for Jonson's other contractions, and the extent to which they have been encountered in the plays considered to this point in the present study: Massinger, as has been observed ( SB , VIII, 144, and above, p. 50), sometimes uses i'the ; o'the has occurred sporadically in a number of plays, all instances of which have been duly noted in the appropriate linguistic tables. Ha' is found in the work of Beaumont, Field, and Middleton (cf. SB , XI, 88 ff.; SB , XII, 92 ff.; SB , XIII, 82). But no one of these dramatists employs the forms in question as regularly as Jonson does. The case for Chapman's authorship of the non-Fletcherian portions of III,1 and the whole of IV,3 of Rollo has been stated by William Wells ( Notes and Queries , CLIV, 6-9). Mr. Wells has examined the vocabulary of Chapman's acknowledged work, and finds a number of parallels of word and phrase to exist between it and the scenes which he would claim for Chapman in Rollo . Mr. Wells's evidence is of the sort which, viewed piecemeal, seems worthless; when viewed in the aggregate, it amounts to convincing proof. I am personally persuaded that he has established Chapman's presence in the play, and here it remains but to determine what light the linguistic evidence for Chapman's unaided plays sheds on the theory of his partial authorship of Rollo . Linguistic evidence for four of Champan's acknowledged tragedies, plus three of his unaided comedies, is given in tabular form below. What is immediately apparent from the evidence of the tables there is that Chapman's linguistic preferences differ markedly from tragedy to comedy. His language in tragedy is notably uncontracted. In the four of them examined below, 'em never occurs, i'th' appears 4 times (once in Byron's Tragedy , once in The Revenge of Bussy d'Ambois , twice in Bussy d'Ambois ), o'th' is used once (in Bussy , where it occurs as ath' ), h'as is never used, and there are but 2 contractions in 's for his (both in Bussy ). As might be expected in such a conservative linguistic pattern as this, there is frequent use of hath and doth in all four tragedies. Ye occurs, to a varying degree in them all: from the 3 occurrences of Byron's Conspiracy , to the 23 occurrences in both Bussy and Bussy's Revenge . In Bussy there is a single occurrence of d'ee . The linguistic pattern displayed by such a comedy as May Day is very different. First of all, hath and doth occur much less frequently than in any of the tragedies, and the language of the comedies becomes, inversely, much more highly contracted. May Day displays 42 occurrences of 'em (plus 2 of 'am , one of 'm , and 2 of 'hem ), 7 of i'th' , 7 of a'th'/a'the (apparently Chapman's contraction for o'th' , which appears once), and a variety of other contracted forms: h'as, 'tas, d'ee, t'ee, w'ee, a for he . The one contraction which Chapman uses regularly in comedies and tragedies alike is t' for to . This is found in all the plays of his that I have examined: 7 times in Byron's Conspiracy , 8 times in Byron's Tragedy , 16 times in Bussy , 12 times in Bussy's Revenge , 18 times in The Gentleman Usher , 3 times in May Day , 4 times in The Widow's Tears . Finally, there is what may be the most distinctive Chapman linguistic form of all: an for on/of , which often occurs in the contraction an't for on/of it . This is found in only four of the seven plays examined here, but the very infrequency of the form in other plays of the period makes it worth noting. There are 7 occurrences of an't in The Widow's Tears , and there are single occurrences of the form in Bussy, Byron's Conspiracy , and May Day ; elsewhere in the latter play, an is used for on/of 4 times. It is interesting to find Chapman's contractions appearing in his acknowledged work in collaboration. Thus, in the 1605 quarto of Eastward Ho , there is a single occurrence of an for on on sig. B2 v , and a single occurrence of an't for on it on sig. C2 v ; and Chapman may be responsible as well for the single occurrences of a the and ath for on the that are found, respectively, on sigs. B1 and C1 of that edition. Since Chapman's style in tragedy is so markedly uncontracted, it is not to be expected that his presumed share of Rollo should contain anything very positive in the way of linguistic evidence. The best that can be hoped for, indeed, is that it should be just as barren of contracted linguistic forms as his acknowledged tragedies are. The very absence of such linguistic forms will become, in such a case, positive evidence of an author's presence; and when we turn to the portions of Rollo which Wells has assigned to Chapman, we find evidence of just this sort, for it is fair to say that II, 1a and 1c, and IV,3 are among the most uncontracted sections of the play. III,1a contains 2 ' em 's and 2 i'th 's, but thereafter, in the scenes attributed to Chapman, these forms do not occur, nor do such other contractions as o'th' , h'as , ha' , or 's for his . The 4 hath's of III, 1a are in accordance with Chapman usage in tragedy ( hath occurs once as well in III,1c). The single contraction which appears in all the supposedly Chapman scenes is, significantly I think, t' for to . This occurs 10 times in the Q2 text as a whole. The single occurrence of the form in I, 1 is Massinger's (his use of the t' contraction has been discussed in SB , VIII, 144, and above p. 50). The 4 occurrences of t' in IV,1-2 would appear to be Jonson's. The remaining 5 occurrences of t' are all found in the scenes attributed to Chapman: one in III,1a; one in III,1c; 3 in IV,3. The linguistic practice evident here is at one with Chapman's use of t' for to in the seven plays of his unaided authorship examined in the linguistic tables below. The linguistic evidence for Chapman's presence in Rollo would be strengthened if either quarto edition displayed any occurrences of contractions in an for on or of , but neither does. As with Jonson, so with Chapman: the linguistic evidence for his presence in Rollo is painfully slight; one does not attribute a share in the play to him without a blush. All that can be said in favor of the attribution is that it is made not alone, or even principally, on linguistic grounds. Here the linguistic evidence has served merely to show that the language practices exhibited in the scenes claimed for Chapman on literary grounds are consistent with the language practices displayed in his acknowledged tragedies. That, I would submit, given the nature of those practices, is all that the linguistic evidence can be expected to show. At best, linguistic evidence for Chapman's work in tragedy is bound to be of the sort that can only corroborate, and never prove.

      <field name="heading_text">Literary Problems in Seventeenth-Century Scientific Manuscripts by H. W. Jones *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of the many anecdotes related in The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides one is of especial interest. 'In the 65th page of the first volume of Sir George Mackenzie,' 1 writes Boswell, 'Doctor Johnson pointed out a paragraph beginning with "Aristotle", and told me there was an error in the text, which he bade me to try to discover. I was lucky enough to hit it at once. As the passage is printed it is said that the Devil answers even in engines . I corrected it to — ever in œnigmas . "Sir," (said he), you are a good critick. This would have been a great thing to do in the text of an ancient authour."' 2 What, in sum, does one expect of the 'good critick' of texts? What qualities should he possess, and what desiderata are to be sought in him? It is a pity that one of the most lively introductions to the subject at large, although with especial reference to dramatic texts, should remain unpublished. 3 At first sight, to quote a practical instance, it would not seem to require a Theobald or a Bentley to emend the second line of the following: 'Tis by no common Mandate of a God, A Soul beautify'd, the blest Abode Thus low deserting, quits Immortal thrones, 4 yet caution here is well rewarded; a glance will show that the OED . recognizes the catachrestic usage of 'beatified'. Apart, however, from diffidence in emendation as a prime requisite, one can hardly postulate definite criteria of the textual critic — one can only appraise his text. What is required is, therefore, not advice but rather a practical, and preferably an as yet untrodden, training ground which embraces if possible both print and manuscript versions of a given passage. 5 One possible example, relating to Roger North's Examen (1740) of White Kennet's Compleat History is lost: the first professes that its manuscript is at Jesus College, Cambridge, but it is no longer there. The purpose of the present paper is to draw attention to another such source of material, one which has as yet hardly been touched by scholars specializing in the transmission of texts. Though the subject matter is of little interest as literature, it is safe to say that hardly a problem which the editor of a Restoration prose text (other than the dramatic) is likely to encounter does not occur there. An immediate advantage of its perusal is the furnishing of a reliable source-text for the writer on the history of science. Clearly this is no place to revive or discuss the logical-positivist interpretation of such material, but it may be pointed out in passing that many of the problems in its interpretation are not 'scientific' at all, but literary or bibliographical, a point which I have stressed elsewhere. 6 The present purpose is twofold: (I) to consider the relevant manuscripts and printed sources, attempting to assess briefly their relative provenance and value, and (II) to note some variants encountered in the texts as the results of (a) deliberate editorial policy, (b) copyists' errors and printers' literals, and (c) instances where a decision may be made between alternatives.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I A realization of the exact nature of the materials under discussion is essential if the comments on the textual problems which follow are to be made clear. As their format has been discussed in some detail elsewhere, however, 7 a summary will suffice. In order, the manuscripts are (1) the 'Classified Papers' (hereinafter called CP ), the first drafts, often holograph, of scientific matters read or communicated to the Society, of which most were transcribed by the Secretaries into (2) the Register ( R ), which consists of several folio volumes. The other manuscript source (we disregard the Society's Letter-Book) is interesting as regards its provenance and independent value: it consists of transcripts of selected materials from the CP or from the Register made by copyists for Sir Hans Sloane and these now form certain of (3) the Sloane MSS in the British Museum ( Slo. ). It is not always clear what their copytext was; in some instances it seems no longer extant, and the reasons for some of their variants, considered later, are often indeterminate: some seem to be honest endeavours to correct or to clarify a corrupt text, as happened in the later Shakespearan Folios, were these manuscript; others are clearly no more than errors in transcription. Our printed sources are, firstly, those pages of Thomas Sprat's History of the Royal Society which constitute versions of selected scientific materials contributed by Fellows and form its Second Part. The four editions (1667, 1702, 1722, 1734; the symbol HRS below should be taken as referring to the first, which alone is of any authority) are for practical purposes identically paged. A facsimile reprint of this first edition 8 records only significant variants in the scientific papers; it does not discuss the reasons for any corruptions. In general, variants there available for examination are not repeated here. Next we have Thomas Birch's four volumes (1753-56) of the same title. It suffices our present purpose to note that this work, in the main, consists of transcripts from the Society's Journal illustrated and supplemented by extracts from the Register and from the Letter-Book. What formed the copy for the relevant parts of Sprat and for Birch is unknown: with the former it was probably a fair copy made by clerks either from the CP or from R ; Birch probably prepared his own from the same sources, but there is some evidence, in the form of alterations in his hand in R , that he used Sprat where he could. Accordingly he is used little here. Apart from the occasional instance in the later editions of Sprat, noted below, no instance has been found in connection with the present enquiry where any printed text is of independent authority — one trivial instance may be ignored. 9 The last printed source is the Society's Philosophical Transactions which, broadly speaking, consist of edited versions of scientific papers, much as in Sprat, but published regularly. Most changes are clearly deliberate, and frequently go as far as a complete re-casting of materials. As a couple of small examples we may take the 'Answers return'd by Sir Philiberto Vernatti, Resident in Batavia in Java Major, to certain enquiries. . . .' (Sprat, 158 ff .), of which certain of the questions figure in the Transactions (11 March 1666/7, 415-419) in much altered form, and the 'Direction for the observations of the eclipses of the moon', of which the version in Sprat (180 ff .) and in the Transactions (11 February 1666/7, 388-390) differ only in occasional alteration of word-order and other small details. Fortunately in the printed materials to be dealt with there appear to be no examples of the 'correction-of-a-correction' error (discussed fully by McKerrow in the unpublished lectures already noted) which, if I may recall his argument, are errors at two removes: the compositor cannot read his copy and conjectures, or else he accidentally mis-sets, and a second person, often the proof-reader, sensing an error in the printed proof, alters it yet again, but from his own judgment and without consulting the copy, so causing a double corruption and one very hard to correct once the true manuscript copy has been lost. Finally it must be made clear that only a small sample from the vast manuscript resources available is here being considered — those papers which happen to occur in Birch, Sprat and the Transactions , or in some of them. Few general conclusions will be attempted at the end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II (a): Editorial changes . 'It is far more dangerous for a corruption to pass unrecognized than for a sound text to be unjustifiably attacked.' 10 Nowhere can this sage pronouncement be more clearly illustrated than in the materials under discussion. The R version of 'A relation of the Pico Teneriffe' starts the account with the names of persons supplying the information ( cf. Birch, I, 393-394). When the style of the passage is tightened for publication it is with the loss of interesting detail, as when a personal touch is sacrificed: . . . About a mile up, one of the Company fail'd, and was able to proceed no further; ( HRS , 201); . . . About a mile up, Mr Cowling, one of the Company fail'd; ( CP, R ); or . . . We were almost stifled with the sudden Emanation of Vapours. . . ( HRS , 202); . . . Dr Pugh was almost stifled. . . ( R ); and . . . One of our company . . . made this journey again two years after. . . ( HRS , 203); Mr Jo: Webber, one of the Company, made. . . ( CP, R ). Likewise we have: 'A Friend of his' ( HRS , 206) for R 's 'one Gilbert Lambell a friend of his'. For some reason vivid points of the narrative are sacrificed, as when 'We descended by a Rope. . .' (204) replaces 'They descended, an active Spanyard shewing them the way, by a Rope' of CP and R . Pugh, the original compiler of the notes, speaks (204) of 'a round Pit of water . . . about six fathom deep. We suppose this Water not a Spring, but dissolved Snow blown in. . .', which is condensed from differing originals but omits CP 's 'One of Dr Pughs company drank of the water.' R adds: 'One of Dr Pughs company drank of the water as Mr Lambell reports who plumbed it. We suppose this water; for some yeares it lyes so full, one cannot get into the cave.' Often the truncations do ensure clarity; the statement that [He] found himself all wet, and perceived it to come from a perpetual trickling of water from the Rocks above him ( HRS , 203) is condensed from [He] found himself all wet, and admiring whence it should proceed, perceived it to come from a perpetual trickling of water from the iminent Rocks above him ( CP, R ); yet the graphic He added several Stories of their [ sc. the Guancios'] great activity in leaping down rocks and Cliffs ( CP ) unnecessarily becomes ( HRS , 213): He added several Stories to this effect of their great activity in leaping down Rocks and Cliffs. An occasional explanatory interpolation is helpful; hence the bare term 'curar' of all the manuscripts becomes in HRS (209), ' Curar , to cure a piece of wood', which also substitutes (205) the neater 'perhaps' for the diffident 'happly &amp; as I conjecture' of the manuscripts in: 'This Plant [the cardencha] is also universally spread over the Island [the Gran Canaria], and is perhaps a kind of Euphorbium .' Often it is an apparently pointless omission, as when HRS and R omit (208) both the short sentence in CP : 'Camells are brought from Lancerote [Lanzarote], besides other Cattell' and the detail: '(In the upper Lands the Corne grows so rank, as two men on horseback, riding at a very smale distance, cannot see each other. The Trees of this Iland are universally greene all the whole yeare.)' The principles guiding those preparing the version for press will appear clear enough from the foregoing, but a few illustrative examples may be added: 'If I light upon it [ sc . Batavian volcanic dust],' writes the Society's correspondent in the East Indies ( HRS , 159), '[I] shall send you some', or rather, his editors' words; instead of 'some' he has, and all the manuscripts follow him, 'a muster'. His statement ( HRS , 160) that '[boisterous winds do not disturb the] Sea or cause a contrary motion in it, being sheltered by these Mountains' is, in its later portion, altered by the Sloane scribe, perhaps to improve the rhythm of the sentence, perhaps to cover an error in copying and to avoid rewriting, to: '. . . Sea, especially being shelter'd by these mountains, and to cause a contrary motion in it' ( Slo . 3959, fol. 16 f .) Did not all the manuscripts support the text, with the exception of the word 'here', added by the HRS copywriter (161), one could well suspect the following as corrupt: Q. 7. Whether those Creatures that are in these parts plump and in season at the full Moon, are lean and out of season at the new, find the contrary at the East-Indies. A. I find it so here . . . Another rather puzzling reading but one which, in conjunction with some points above, may support the hypothesis that the copy for HRS was an edited transcript from R , not from CP , is the unnecessary expansion of the clear reading of Slo. and CP : 'It is forbidden strictly under a great penalty to make use of the same' ['suyker-bier'] into: 'It is forbidden strictly under the penalty of a great pain to make use of the same' ( HRS , 162). When no answer was returned (there is a deliberate hiatus in CP ) to the question as to 'whether in Pegu there is a poison that kills by smell' R waxes literary: 'Nihil respondet', but HRS (165) politely states that 'To this no Answer was return'd', just as it changes to 'a pattern' (165) the conversational 'a muster' of all the manuscripts, although by error or design it deprives its readers of the exotic term Juserts for ' a certain winged Ant' which ( HRS , 167) produces one kind of gumlac. That those who prepared the copy for the scientific portions of the volume were themselves scientists is proved by an addition they made to a sentence in Sir William Petty's paper on dyeing. He wrote ( CP ): 'The restringent binding materials are alder bark.' Adding a comma after 'alder', they added ( HRS , 295): 'Pomegranate Pills, Wallnut rinds and roots, Oaken Sapling Bark, and Saw-dust of the same; Crab-tree Bark, Galls, and Sumach.' We close this section as it was started, with readings from the paper on the Pico Teneriffe. The criticism levelled by Coleridge at Sprat that in his Life of Cowley he suppressed homely detail and would not show his friend in his slippers and dressing-gown could well apply to the editors of his History too. From the end of the following: 'The rest of us pursued our Journey till we came to the Sugar-loaf , where we begin to travel again in a white sand, being fore-shod with shooes whose single soles are made a finger broader than the upper leather, to encounter this difficult and unstable passage' ( HRS , 201) they expunged the vivid: '. . . till they are halfe way up; and then being ascended as farre as the Black Rocks, Dr Pugh (as he relates) went crying all the way having the skin burnt off his foot '( CP ). Likewise 'Being ascended as far as the Black Rocks, which are all flat, &amp; lie like a pavement, we climbed within a mile of the very top of the Pico, Mr Clappham, who was the foremost, would have persuaded Mr Cove to descend againe, as he was imagining the top all on fire' ( ibid .). (b). Errors: printers' literals, misreading of copy . Section (a) has been demonstrative, seeking to show how a particular editorial policy was put into effect. The appeal of an editor printing the papers referred to can ultimately be only to CP , though he may record, and discuss possible reasons for, variants in the later texts. Instances in which the transcribers for press have misunderstood technical terms or foreign words call for some little research in order to amend errors. Sometimes omissions in transcription have to be filled from the manuscripts, as in: '. . . boysterous, called Travant , come suddenly . . .' ( HRS , 160; a further corruption in this passage was considered above). Here, however, it is possible to restore this particular corruption before consulting the manuscript, since the paper deals with the East Indies and a knowledge of Dutch simplifies our task: read, with CP and R : '. . . boysterous winds, called Travaat. . .' Again, '. . . A sort of wild Lavender . . . grows there [in Teneriffe] in great quantities on the Rocks' ( HRS , 211), where the HRS text follows R over 'wild': CP has 'white'. Sir Philiberto Vernatti, who answers the East Indies questions, was, in spite of his name, English. He speaks ( HRS , 168), with reference to a glutinous substance, that it is of a ' Zeequal viscosity'. This is the Dutch 'zeekwal,' jellyfish. Assuming that the homophonic spelling was not the normal Dutch spelling of the period — I have been unable to document it otherwise — this variant may have occurred at some stage when the text was perhaps communicated orally; the same may, with some confidence, be said of 'sivyboa/ sawoeboom' (163, noted in the facsimile edition) and of 'cherna/ cierna' (Italian) on p.208. Several words in Spanish the compositor, in fact, misread: . . . Some [earthware pots] are found in the Caves and old Bavances (HRS, 212; follow CP , 'Barancos,' caves). In some parts of this Island [Palma] there grows a crooked Shrub which they call Legnan . Another Grass growing near the Sea, which is of a broader leaf, so luscious and rank, as it will kill a Horse that eats of it, but no other cattle ( HRS , 207, om . 'Another . . . cattle'). The ambiguity of the last sentence cannot escape notice. In CP and R a seeming gloss of Legnan (Spanish, leñan, 'wood') which starts 'vel. . .' is erased, and the latter text omits 'and rank', intelligently substituting a semi-colon for the comma after 'of it'. Other examples of variants in effective punctuation are few (see also (c) below), but we may note the following: 'This greasie Oyl. . . doth by nature so wonderfully adhere to every part else of the [salt-] Peter (it may be ordained for the nutriment and augmentation of it) that the separation of it is the sole cause of the great charge and labour that is required to the refining of Peter ' ( HRS , 262), where R , the only extant manuscript, inserts a comma after 'may be'; and ' Maxima, Satellitum in Umbra incidentium, a limbo Disci Jovialis distantia . . . hebdomada contingit ' (185-186), where CP and R have no comma after 'incidentium'. We conclude this section, several of whose items may, in interpretation, overlap with those of the next, with a few miscellaneous variants, such as HRS 'candescentibus' (262) for the true reading 'canescentibus' in a passage of Pliny; 'gravulate' for 'granulate' (272; perhaps a literal); 'The Ascension of the Brimstone' (205), which is contextually possible, as against the more tempting 'Accension' of R ; 'It will require your patience to observe a few short remains' (262; R , 'remarks') 'out of the same Pliny,' ; 'Each Boat hath a certain quantity of square Stones, upon which Stones' (169; all MSS, 'stands') 'the Divers goe down'; ' English Woad is counted the strongest, it is commonly tryed by staining of white Paper with it, or a white Limed wall' (300; CP , 'lomed wall'); and, with reference to the paper on the eclipses of the moon mentioned above: 'The Knowledge of the Eclipses Quantity and Duration, the Shadows, Curvity and Inclination, &amp;c. conduce only to the former [purpose, sc. the theory of the moon's motion]', where the true reading would appear to be 'the shadow [']s curvity' of the manuscripts. The remaining Latin variants, though important in their own right, are somewhat esoteric, and are therefore relegated to a footnote for reference. 11 (c): Opportunities for an eclectic text . Our last category, where some textual errors listed arise probably from copyists' carelessness, gives us the opportunity for some investigation into the source and reliability of the Sloane transcript. As already stated, it seems to have been commissioned for Sloane himself, possibly when the original volume of the Register it duplicates was temporarily misplaced; but the copyist has allowed himself some latitude, for some variants we meet in it appear to be founded on no authority but their own. Often he indulges in tautological paraphrase: . . . diminishing more and more; according as the Tree groweth in greatness; and as soon as the Worm is wholly turned into the Tree, rooting in the ground, and so growing great ? ( HRS , 161) becomes . . . diminishing more and more, according as the Tree groweth in greatness; and as the tree groweth in greatness and as soon as the Worm is wholly turned into the Tree, rooting in the ground, and so growing great? ( MS. cit. ) where, it is true, the error may be akin to that noted above which was due to the eye having mistaken the lines of the original, but this does not account elsewhere for the synonym 'squib' for the 'jeer' 'put upon the Portuges ' ( HRS , 161), nor for 'seed' replacing 'wood' ( sc. aloes, which 'comes most from Cambodia , and Siam ', 171-172). In the latter instance all manuscripts are changed to the correct reading, 'wood', in a later hand, again probably Birch's, an alteration akin to the erasure, in the Register, of the words 'and Scritores' after the word 'Chests' in the passage in HRS , 165, given as: 'Chests which comes from Jappan into Europe ' and to the alteration of the original reading of the manuscripts, 'Pharmocopedia', to conform to HRS 'Pharmocopeia ' (167). Likewise the word 'removing', nonsense in its context, has been emended to the correct 'renewing' (Birch, i. 485, has the text correctly as has HRS , 199) in the following ( HRS , 232): '[On taking away a pair of bellows thrust into the windpipe of a dissected, yet living, dog, the heart had] convulsive motions; but upon removing the motion of the Bellows, the Heart recovered its former motion .' This may be further evidence for attributing to Birch the Register emendations of Robert Hooke's paper on the weather ( HRS , 173 ff. ); Slo (698, ff. 58-61) seems to be a transcript of R rather than of CP . Examples of careless mis-copying are, happily, infrequent: only one need be noticed. HRS , 'observabit' (187) for the doubtlessly correct 'aberrabit' of CP and R in the sentence 'Calculus . . . a vero aberrabit' may be compared with the error of 'observe' for 'above' in 'the more Peter you allow it [gunpowder], it will still be the better, till you come to observe Eight parts' (278) to prove that both papers were the work of the same copyist or compositor. In the latter quotation R is again emended to follow the printed text, here of course wrongly. Small graphical errors rarely affect the sense materially: '. . . People of the Country do take' ('rake,' R ) 'it [saltpetre] off the ground' (262-263); '. . . Great Rains may easily bring it to the Lake in Macedonia . . . ' (263), where the Register's 'that Lake' makes clear the point, destroyed in the History text, that the particular lake was one specifically referred to earlier in the paper, citing Pliny: Natural History , X. 107; 'The Stuffs to be dyed are first boyled in Allum-liquors, and the Allum afterwards (as they say) cleared from the said Stuff again' ( CP : 'same Stuff'), 'before any Colour at all to be applyed' (288); and 'Some Colours or Stuffs are best dyed by reiterated Dippings ever' ( CP : 'even') 'into the same Liquor at several distances of time' (304). Two similar Latin examples are relegated to a footnote for the reason given previously. 12 All manuscript sources agree in the sentence (164): '[Chewing durian] causes a Dirthea , which easily degenerates to a Tenasmus , by us called Peirsing', where the fourth edition of HRS conjectures and prints 'diarhea'; one hesitates, however, to give the more modern forms 'tenesmos' and 'piercing'. Since the CP draft of the paper about salt-petre is no longer extant we may legitimately make a text compounded of that of HRS and of R , just as editors compound texts of some Shakespearean plays based on the Quarto or Quartos and the Folio; the legitimacy of such a procedure has, of course, been denied. An example is: '. . . Though Peter go alway in Gun-powder, yet if you fulminate it in a Crucible, and burn of[f] the volatile part with Powder of Coal [ sc. 'charcoal'], Brimstone, Antimony or Meal, there will remain a Salt' (274-275), where the Register reads 'go all away' in the sense of 'calcine'. Sometimes punctuation can affect the issue: compare The last I shall name is . . . other great variety of Handling: An account of all which is that History of Dying ['dyeing'] we intend (287) with The last I shall name is . . . other great variety; of handling, an account of all which is the history of Dying we intend ( R ), and the following, where the writer is referring to ambergrease: To endeavour the getting of more certain knowledge; what it is, being reported to be bred in the bottom of the Sea like to a thick mud ? (168) with To endeavour the getting of more certain knowledge what it is; being reported to be bred in the bottom of the sea like to a thick mud? ( R ), where the latter perhaps gives the better sense. Finally, readers are invited to take their pick of readings in the following four samples: Yet such Effects of the Macassars Arts [i.e. sympathetic poisonings] are unknown to us' (165. CP, Slo. : Macassar dartes); [Cinnamon has] a most Excellent taste; so that by Sunning it looseth rather than acquires any taste or force; the Tree being pill'd is cut down to the root; but the young Sprigs after a year or two give the best and finest Cinnamon' (169. Slo.: evil for 'ex ct ' of CP and adds before 'young Sprigs ' the Surac or); It [saltpetre] is no sooner dilated by Rain-water, or the Moisture of the Earth, but it is immediately appylyed to the production or nutriment of some Plant' (265. R : diluted); The use of Allum is to be a Vinculum between the Cloth and the Colour, as clammy-Oyls and Gum-waters are in Painting and Limming' (290. CP : claying-Oyls; R : Clayie Oyls). Lest the materials presented above be considered ill digested, a word must be said by way of summary. It must be emphasized that they are only samples, intended to show the kind of problem likely to be faced by the editor of a seventeenth century science text: they neither postulate nor prove any thesis. Data are inadequate, for instance, to furnish any clues as to what kind of error, if any, 'T.R.' 's compositors were prone when setting HRS , and the Errata of its first edition are all literals and refer only to Sprat's portion of the book. In what specific tasks, then, may the examples cited be of service? There is much to be done in the publication or republication of seventeenth century science authorities: Boyle, long recognized as an English stylist, needs reprinting; Wren's scientific work has not yet been satisfactorily collected; only recently has the publication of Newton's correspondence been put in hand; and in addition there is the whole corpus of unpublished material by lesser men, British and Continental — it is surprising, moreover, but typical of this state of affairs that although we have a satisfactory biography of Robert Hooke (Margaret 'Espinasse, 1956) we have as yet no collected edition of his works. Rarely, in this discipline, is any one text absolutely authoritative as a source text. One day, nevertheless, we may see the magnum opus of a dictionary, by subjects and by persons, of every major scientific activity in Europe during the century: to such an El Dorado the present paper can only tentatively point the way.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Scottish Printers and Booksellers 1668-1775: A Second Supplement (I) by Robert Hay Carnie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This second supplement to the Scottish entries in the dictionaries of the British book trade for the period 1668-1775 1 records 180 printers, booksellers, bookbinders and papermakers not contained in these dictionaries nor in the first supplement. 2 In so far as it consists of new names only it differs from the first supplement which consisted both of new entries and of additional material to existing entries. The sources of information used on this occasion proved to be so fruitful that a large bulk of additional and corrective material to existing entries has been laid aside to await a complete revision of Plomer and Bushnell. In the meantime, the following list may be of use to students of the Scottish book trade. The sources which lie behind the entries can be divided up into three main groups: Imprints, manuscripts records and secondary printed material. 1. The imprints of several hundred books and pamphlets printed between 1668 and 1775, and not utilized by previous investigators in this field, have been examined. 3 As might be expected at this stage of investigation, such works are usually of an ephemeral or specialized variety and are not commonly found outside Scottish academic or theological libraries. These imprints provided a valuable cross-check on information taken from secondary sources. 2. Four manuscripts sources were used. The first of these was an account book for The Weekly Magazine, or Edinburgh Amusement . 4 This magazine ran from 1768 to 1784 and was conducted by Walter Ruddiman, Junior, until his death in June 1781, but the account book covers only the period 1768 to 1773. The account book deals chiefly with the purchase of sets of the magazine, rather than single numbers, by Edinburgh and country booksellers. It seems unlikely that it provides a complete list of the booksellers who handled Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine , for the names of a number of well known Edinburgh booksellers are missing; but it provides a useful guide to booksellers in the smaller towns, and reveals that the magazine was read all over Scotland. It has long been known that the magazine was extremely popular. The weekly news section and the popularity of Robert Fergusson's poetry, much of which appeared in its pages for the first time, both helped to build up its circulation to three thousand copies weekly in the winter of 1776. Another manuscript source interesting in itself was the records of the Wright Incorporation of Perth. Minute books and indenture books of this ancient calling cover the period 1538 to 1864 and have been described in full elsewhere 5 but I have incorporated into this list men concerned in the book trade in Perth from 1668 to 1775 whose names are not to be found in Plomer and Bushnell. The Hammerman Book of the hammermen trade in the ancient Burgh of St. Andrews 6 has provided two entries, and the Library—quaestor accounts of St. Andrews University 7 provided the name of an unrecorded bookbinder to that university who operated in the last two decades of the 17th century. 3. These primary sources taken altogether provided much less new material than the main secondary source which was the advertisement pages of contemporary newspapers. A systematic examination of The Caledonian Mercury from its beginning in April 1720 to the end of 1775, and of The Aberdeen Journal from its beginning in December 1747 to 1775 8 was made. The greatest gains made here were amongst those whose main function was what we would now call the retail side of the book trade—that is, those who were concerned with the sale of books, pamphlets and newspapers over their counters in the smaller Scottish towns. The names of such men do appear sometimes on the title papers of the period—particularly when they had a financial interest in a publication and had that work printed for them in Edinburgh and Glasgow. 9 The advertisements, however, proved even in those cases to be the guide which could lead an investigator to the publications themselves. Bookbinders are another group which are unlikely to figure in imprints in their capacity as binders, 10 though in a large number of cases in the 18th century a bookseller was also a bookbinder, or, alternatively, a large bookselling establishment would have a bookbinder on their staff. It is important to note, however, that the advertisements reveal the names of both booksellers and bookbinders at the journeymen level in the bigger establishments whose names might otherwise never be known. Certain kinds of advertisements other than straightforward lists of books for sale proved useful. Most of these were primarily concerned with the booktrade itself and include such things as prospectuses for books to be printed by subscription, or in number-issues, but the list would be seriously circumscribed if the investigator had limited himself to this kind of advertisement. Notices of property for sale; advertisements by the stockists of patent medicines, and lists of names of those shops who were willing to take in cloth for the bleaching mills of Scotland all provided further examples of Scottish retail booksellers. It has long been well known that such patent medicines as Turlington's Drops, Radcliff's Purging Elixir, Baume de Vie and Anderson's Pills were a profitable side-line with bookseller-stockists in the smaller towns. It is not so well known that a number of booksellers were prepared to collect linen cloth for the large bleach fields which are found on so many rivers in Scotland and which required collecting points in nearby towns. In both these kinds of advertisement, only stockists or collectors actually designated "bookseller" in the advertisement itself, have been included in the list. In most cases the fact that the individuals concerned were booksellers is corroborated by other kinds of evidence. It should perhaps be noted that the advertisements concerning book auctions—a favourite method of stock dispersal in the 18th century both to the public and to other members of the trade—reveal that such auctions generally took place in large halls or rooms and not on the booksellers' own premises. The file of The Scots Magazine , from its beginning to the end of the 18th century, was also carefully scrutinized, particularly the book lists and the sections dealing with domestic events and criminal proceedings. The other secondary printed sources used were modern. Great assistance was gained from Ewing's provisional list of Glasgow printers, which was not issued to the public; from the Scottish Record Society's list of burgesses of Glasgow from 1751 to 1846, and from the memorial catalogue of the 1894 Glasgow Exhibition. The entries on paper makers owe much to Waterston's important articles on paper makers in the Edinburgh district.

ALLAN (LAURENCE), printer?, servant to Robert Fleming, 1767.

William Annandale, the elder, won silver medals for his papers from the Edinburgh Society. (S.M., Jan., 1757; S.M., April, 1759; Waterston O.E.C., XXV, 70; XXVII, 54.) BAILLIE (JAMES), advocate in Edinburgh, 1734-36. Baillie was not properly a bookseller, but for some reason he was publisher and selling-agent of Sir Thomas Craig's De Feudis . He issued a notice to subscribers in July, 1734, pointing out that the book was now available from Walter Ruddiman at the Printing-house, Parliament close, and another in February, 1736 which said: 'Subscribers are asked to call for the book at Mr Baillie's house, about the middle of Muslin's Wynd, opposite to the back entry of the Poultry-market where all others may be served with the same book'. (C.M., July 25th, 1734; C.M., February 5th, 1736.) BAILLIE (JOHN), printer and bookseller, Edinburgh, 1753-1755. Parliament Close, 1753.

A.U.L. copy of Mahomet .) BANKS (R.), bookseller in Stirling, 1755-1771. James Fordyce's The Method of promoting edification . . . was printed in Glasgow for Banks in 1755. In 1758 his name is listed in The Aberdeen Journal as holding proposals for a London edition in weekly numbers of Smollett's History of England . Similarly in The Caledonian Mercury in 1771, we find him holding proposals for printing by subscription an edition of The Works of George Whitefield . (Copy of Fordyce A.U.L.; A. J., Feb. 14, 1758; C.M., Mar. 2, 1771.) BAXTER (WILLIAM), foreman papermaker at Gifford, 1774. In 1774 the paper-mill at Gifford, owned by the Marquis of Tweeddale, was offered to let for the remaining five years of tack at 40 pounds per annum. Gifford was 16 miles from Edinburgh and 3 miles from Haddington. Prospective tenants were asked to get in touch with William Baxter, foreman at the mill. (C.M., April 11, 1774.) BELL (ALEXANDER), stationer in St. Andrews, 1707-1742(?). Alexander Bell, stationer, and treasurer of St. Andrews, was admitted to the Hammerman Craft on 12th Sept., 1707 (cf. Bushnell, p. 282). (Hammerman Book, St. A.U.L.) BELL (WILLIAM), printer in Glasgow, 1766-1780. In 1766 Bell printed a two-volume edition of De Re Medica by Celsus, and in 1780 A new Collection in Prose and Verse, for the Use of Schools . Ewing says that Bell was printing in 1766 and William Bell and Company in 1769. He was certainly printing with W. Gilmour in 1768. William Bell was made Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow on 24th April, 1777, by right of his father, Malcolm Bell, Merchant. (B. &amp; G.B. 1751-1846, p. 104.; Old Glasgow, pp. 394-395.) BLACK (JAMES), glazier and stationer in Perth, 1696. Black was admitted as a freeman Wright on 8 Feb., 1696. He was lawful son to Thomas Black, Wright, and his right of entry was as a freeman's son (cf. Bibliotheck, I, no. 4, p. 32). BLACK (PATRICK), glazier and stationer in Perth, 1687. Probably the eldest brother of James Black. He was admitted freeman of the Wright calling on 31 Dec., 1687. (Bibliotheck, I, no. 4, p. 32.) BOGLE (ROBERT), bookseller in Glasgow, 1759. Robert Bogle, bookseller, was made a Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow as eldest lawful son to the deceased Robert Bogle, merchant on 19th April, 1759. (B. &amp; G.B. 1751-1846, p. 31.) BOYD (P.), bookseller in Dundee, 1759-1760. Boyd is named as a bookseller stocking the following book in the pages of The Aberdeen Journal in 1759: The British Negociator, by S. Thomas, Merchant . In 1760 he is said to stock No. 1. of the London publication called The Christian Magazine , Price 6d. (A.J., April 3, 1759; May 26, 1760.) BREUSCH (PETER), papermaker at Canonmills, Edinburgh, 1681. Breusch made paper at Canonmills about 1681. He afterwards set up the same manufacture at Restalrig. (Waterson O.E.C., XXV, 54-55.) BROWN (WILLIAM), bookseller in Glasgow, 1769. The Scots Magazine for June, 1769, reports that 'John and James Sword, merchants in Glasgow indicted for a rape, committed on the body of Janet Orr, spouse to William Brown, Bookseller in Glasgow were, after a trial which lasted ten hours, found not guilty by the jury and assoilzied'. It was said that Brown and his wife had instigated the matter to extort money. (S.M., June, 1769, p. 332.) BRUCE (JOHN), merchant in Aberdeen, printer and bookseller, 1768-1769. Bruce had a short-lived partnership with John Boyle, printer and paper maker in Aberdeen. In 1768 they published together The Works of Josephus , and in 1769 they issued together from 'their Printing Office in the Broadgate', The Works of Willison . But the partnership ended some time before 16 October, 1769, when it was advertised in The Aberdeen Journal that 'the co-partnership in the printing trade between Bruce and Boyle hath for some time past been dissolved, and is now wholly carried on by John Boyle. . .'. (A.J., May 30, 1768; 16 October, 1769; A.B.L., V, 36-38.) BRYCE (PATRICK), printer and bookseller in Glasgow, 1743-1757. Patrick Bryce is found listed in The Caledonian Mercury as a bookseller stocking the following work: A Review of the Preface to the Narrative of the extraordinary Work at Kilsyth. . . . By James Fisher, Minister of the Gospel in the Associate Congregation . Bryce is not included in Ewing's list. He was made a Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow on 8 Feb, 1759, by right of his father, Patrick Bryce, Hammerman. (C.M., Jan., 1743; B. &amp; G.B. 1751-1846, p. 22.) BUCHANAN (DAVID), bookseller in Montrose, 1774-. This very well known Scottish bookseller of the latter part of the century was in business in 1774 and thus should be included in the supplement. He stocked Coke's Catalogue in 1774. (C.M., May 21, 1774.) BUIST (D.), bookseller in Perth, 1747. Buist is one of the many booksellers listed in the imprint of The Acts and Proceedings of Associate Synod in April, 1747, Edinburgh: Printed by William Gray, for Andrew Stevenson: and sold by the said W. Gray, and by G. Crawford in Edinburgh, D. Buist in Perth, T. Lundin in Glasgow, J. Nimmo in Kilmarnock, W. Henderson in Dunfermline, J. Henderson in Abernethy, W. Marshal in Home, J. Kerr in Selkirk, and other Booksellers in Town and Country, MDCCXLVII . (Copy of pamphlet. St. A.U.L.; A.U.L.) BURNETT (JAMES), bookseller and bookbinder in Aberdeen, 1769-1775 (1805?) Middle of the Lodge Wall, 1769; Foot of the Lodge Wall, 1775. According to advertisements in The Aberdeen Journal , Burnett bound books, sold books and issued catalogues in the period 1769-1775. He was in business after that date and may be the Aberdeen bookseller, J. Burnett, who sold Francis Peacock's Practice of Dancing , in 1805 . (A.J., Dec. 25, 1769; Sept 25, 1775. A.B.L. IV, no. 4, p. 96.) CHALMERS (------), bookseller in Dumfries, 1771-1773. This Chalmers was in partnership with A. McLauchlan, (see later entry) and bought sets in 1772 of Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine . The last date connected with his name in the accountbook is February 2nd, 1773. (La. III, 752) CHALMERS (ROBERT), bookbinder, bookseller and stationer in Aberdeen, 1764-1775. In the Narrow-Wynd, 1764-1766. In the Broadgate opposite to Mr John Dyce's, 1767-. There are many entries in The Aberdeen Journal concerning Robert Chalmers. He is described in April, 1764, as a bookbinder and his change of address to the Broadgate is given in December, 1766, when he is said to bind books 'in the neatest manner and at the lowest prices' and to sell stationery. He seems to have published a number of books in partnership with John Mennye, including The Works of Willison . This book was printed in numbers and must have had a large sale, for the advertisements state that the first three numbers had to be reprinted. Mennye and Chalmers also issued proposals for printing by subscription The Sermons of the late Reverend Alexander Howie in 1769. The partnership apparently ended in 1769 for both Chalmers and Mennye published books on their own in 1770 (cf. Bushnell, p. 332). There is evidence of financial trouble in the years 1771 and 1772, for in November, 1771, John Boyle issued catalogues of a list of books to be sold in the shop lately possessed by Robert Chalmers, a little below the well in the head of the Broadgate, and on 8th March, 1772, there was a meeting of the creditors of Robert Chalmers. He seems to have survived in business after this event, for we find him issuing catalogues of books to be sold from an address 'opposite the Broadgate well' in December, 1773, and October, 1775. (A.J., April 2, 1764; Dec 29, 1766; Oct 23, 1769; Dec 4, 1769; July 16, 1770; Nov 4, 1771; Feb 10, 1772; Dec 27, 1773; Oct 16, 1775.) CHAPMAN (JOHN) JUNIOR, publisher in Edinburgh, 1765-1769. John Chapman, Junior, was the publisher of The Universal Scots Almanack from 1765 to 1769. This useful almanack was printed for him by Walter Ruddiman and John Richardson and was sold by the author at the following addresses: 1765, at his House, 4th storey of Cleghorn's Land, Grassmarket; 1769. 1st storey of the Shoemaker's Land, South Side of Alison's Square, Potterrow. (E.U.L. has copies of these almanacks.) CHAPMAN (MRS ----), widow of John Chapman, Senior, Publisher in Edinburgh, 1754-1764. Mrs Chapman sold The Universal Scots Almanack from 1754 to 1764. The date of her husband's death is unknown. In 1761 she sold the Almanack 'at her house 3rd storey of Cleghorn's Land, Grassmarket', but in 1764 she was selling it from her house on the 4th storey of Cleghorn's Land. (E.U.L.) CHISHOLM (------), bookseller in Edinburgh, 1756-1760. Chisholm is listed in the book lists of The Scots Magazine for February, 1760, as selling Notes on Scripture Texts . . . . By John Glas . I have not found his name elsewhere than in The Scots Magazine . (S.M., Feb., 1760; April, 1756.) COCK (DANIEL), printer and bookseller in Glasgow, 1748. Cock's name is found on the title page of the following work The New Constitution of pretended Synod, which first met at Mr Gib's house, April 10, 1747 unmasked . . . Glasgow : Daniel Cock 1748 ; not listed in Ewing. (A.U.L. pamphlets. K. 282) COCKBURN (------), bookseller, Kelso, 1749. Cockburn is listed in The Caledonian Mercury as one of the many Scottish Provincial Booksellers stocking The Newcastle General Magazine for 1749. (C.M., Feb. 14, 1749.) COLVILLE (ROBERT), stationer in Glasgow, 1765. Robert Colville, stationer, was made a Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow on 14th June, 1765, as having served an apprenticeship with James Robb, stationer. (B. &amp; G.B. Glasgow, 1751-1846, p. 51) COUTTS (W.), merchant and bookseller in Aberdeen, 1775. The anonymous writer of an article on Aberdeen's early booksellers in the trade periodical called Brown's Bookstall lists W. Coutts amongst a number of Aberdeen booksellers who had books printed for them and at whose shops they were to be sold. I have not personally examined any book which had Coutts's name in the imprint. (B.B. Vol. I, no. 7, July, 1892.) CUNNINGHAM (WILLIAM), bookseller in Haddington, 1772-1773. Cunningham bought sets of Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine throughout 1772. The last date attached to his name in the account book is February, 1773. (La. III, 752) DAES (ALEXANDER), papermaker at Dalry before 1679 and after 1681. Waterston gives a short account of Daes's interrupted career as a papermaker, and of his short essay into showmanship. (Waterston O.E.C., XXVII, 41-42.) DOWS (WILLIAM AND ANTHONY), booksellers in Cullen, 1773. These two names are listed amongst the booksellers of the North East of Scotland who stocked the periodical The Scots Farmer . (A.J., Oct. 2, 1773.; Nov. 15, 1773) DRYSDALE (THOMAS), bookbinder in Dunfermline, 1759. The only recorded fact concerning this bookbinder is that of his death. John Marshall, Carrier in Auchtermuchty, was tried for the murder of Thomas Drysdale, bookbinder, in Dunfermline on March 13, 1759, 'by assaulting him when intoxicated with liquor, at or near the bridge of Gourly and drowning him in a pond, or strangling him with a handkerchief which he wore about his neck'. The charge was found not proven and Marshall was freed. (S.M., Sept., 1759, pp. 493-494.) teDUNCAN (------), Baillie in Kilmarnock, 1718. Duncan is named in the imprint of The History of the Late Rebellion which was printed by Robert Rae at Dumfries in 1718 and sold by Baillie Duncan in Kilmarnock. (Copy St. A.U.L.) DUNCAN (ALEXANDER), printer and bookseller in Glasgow, 1767-1797(?). Duncan was printing in Glasgow, according to Ewing, under the title Alexander Duncan and Company from 1767 to 1772. In 1768 he published John Witherspoon's Sermons on Practical Subjects , and in 1770, an edition of Scripture Songs: or Translations and Paraphrases of several Passages of Sacred Scripture . In 1774 Duncan was apparently printing on his own, for he published in that year The A. B. C. With the Shorter Catchism . Whether or not he was in fact on his own at this time, there is no doubt that he had a partner in the following years. From 1775 to 1788 he published with Robert Chapman the elder who died in 1788 (Ewing). Within this period he published in 1775 the Reverend John Willison's A Sacramental Catechism . . . ., and in 1777 A Chronological Index of the most Remarkable Events and Persons recorded in Ancient and Modern History . Again, according to Ewing, one Alexander Duncan and Robert Chapman Junior were printing together in the period 1790 to 1795, while J. and A. Duncan printed at least two books in partnership in the period 1796 to 1797. An Alexander Duncan, printer and bookseller, was made Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow on 12th April, 1777 as having served an apprenticeship with Mr. Robert Foulis, deceased, barber. All these facts probably concern the same man, or possibly two men of the same name. (B &amp; G.B. 1751 to 1846, p. 104; Old Glasgow, pp. 377-378.) DUNCAN (JOHN), bookbinder and bookseller in Glasgow, 1754(?)-1770. A John Duncan appears on the imprint of a work called Heaven upon Earth; or the History of the Transfiguration of Jesus Christ . . . . This book was printed in partnership with James Duncan in 1754. This may be the same man as the John Duncan, bookbinder, who was made a Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow on 10th September, 1770, as having served an apprenticeship with Robert and Andrew Foulis, printers. It is possible that two John Duncans are involved. (B. &amp; G.B. 1751 to 1846, p. 70; Old Glasgow p. 376.) DUNCAN (ROBERT), printer and bookseller in Glasgow, 1768-1785. In 1768, The Works of the Pious, Reverend, and learn'd Mr Hugh Binning, Late Minister of the Gospel at Govan was printed in Glasgow for James Robb and Robert Duncan. The latter was admitted Burgess and Guild Brother of Glasgow on 31st July 1769 as a bookseller by right of his father the deceased William Duncan, bookbinder (Bushnell, p. 303). Ewing gives Duncan as a printer in 1769 and 1784-1785. He is presumably the same Robert Duncan who was in partnership with Thomas Duncan in the years 1770 to 1784. In 1770 they printed Thomas Boston's A View of the Covenant of Grace from the Sacred Records and in 1784 Roman Stories: or, the History of the Seven Wise Masters of Rome . The Thirty-third Edition . (St. A.U.L.; B. &amp; G.B. 1751-1846, p. 63; Old Glasgow p. 378.) DUNCAN (THOMAS), printer and bookseller in Glasgow, 1770-1784. All that is known of the activities of this member of the Duncan family can be found in the entry for Robert Duncan. In 1772 an edition of Allan Ramsay's The Gentle Shepherd was printed in Glasgow and sold by R. and T. Duncan. (R.G.B.S. X, 61.) DUNLOP AND WILSON, booksellers in Glasgow, 1773-1776. Advertisements can be found in The Caledonian Mercury for the period 1773 to 1776, naming Dunlop and Wilson as selling a number of Edinburgh books. Typical of these is The Memoirs of the Life, Time and Writings of the Reverend and Learned Thomas Boston A. M. printed by Murray and Cochran of Edinburgh. (E.E.C., April 17, 1776; C.M., Oct. 2, 1774; C.M., Dec. 29, 1773.) DUPYNE (NICHOLAS), papermaker near Edinburgh 1694- . Dupyne floated the Scots Paper Company about 1694. He started paper mills at Yester, East Lothian and at Braid, near Edinburgh. The mills were still making paper in 1703. (Waterston O.E.C., XXV, 46-69.) EDWARD (ROBERT), bookseller(?) in Edinburgh, 1692. Edward's name is found in the imprint of the following work: Phalainologia Nova sive Observationes de rarioribus quibusdam Balaenis in Scotiae Littus nuper ejectis. . . . . Edinburge; Typis Joannis Redi . MDCXCII . Vaeneunt apud M. Robertum Edward, verbi divini Ministrum, in vice dicto the Bishop's Land Closs . A Robert Edward, minister at Murroes and citizen of Dundee published a Latin Description of Angus in 1678. (St. Paul's Cathedral Dundee. Vestry Library.) ELLIOTT (GEORGE), bookseller in Kelso, 1773-1776. Elliott often appears as a bookseller in advertisements in the Edinburgh newspapers for the period 1773 to 1776. In 1776 he sold The Memoirs of Thomas Boston , printed by Murray and Cochran and in 1773 he was listed as stocking The Scots Farmer . (E.E.C., April 17, 1776; C.M., Feb. 13, 1775; Mar. 26, 1774; Jan. 30, 1773.) FERRIER (JOHN), bookbinder in Aberdeen, 1758. Our sole notice of John Ferrier is found in a newspaper advertisement. This advertisement points out that Mr Richard Smith had succeeded Bartholomew Smith as a papermaker at Culter sometime in 1758. It also states that Smith was prepared to give ready money for rags 'at the house of John Ferrier, bookbinder, Aberdeen.' (A.J., Oct. 10, 1758.) FORBES (ROBERT), printer in Aberdeen(?), previous to 1746. This man is named as a printer in the magazine accounts of the trials of the Jacobite Rebels at Carlisle in 1746. Amongst those who pled guilty when brought to be tried and were sentenced to be executed was one Robert Forbes, printer. It seems not unlikely that he was a member of the Forbes family at Aberdeen. (S.M., Sept. 1746, VIII, 438.) FORSYTH (ALEXANDER), bookseller in Ayr, 1770-1773. Forsyth bought sets of Ruddiman's Weekly Magazine from 1770 to 1772. The last date attached to his name in the account book is March 25, 1772. Two Discourses , by William Dalrymple were advertised in May, 1773, as being printed for and sold by A. Forsyth, bookseller, Ayr, and by J. Meuros, bookseller, Kilmarnock. Alexander Forsyth was probably related to James Forsyth, bookbinder in Edinburgh, for in the same advertisement, the Edinburgh bookbinder is named as an agent for this book (cf. Bushnell, p. 307). (C.M., May 22, 1773; La. III, 752.) FORSYTH (L.), bookseller in Edinburgh, 1775. A number of booksellers advertised the fact in September, 1775, that they were selling The Decisions of the Court of Session to 1764 . Amongst these booksellers was one L. Forsyth. (C.M., Sept. 2, 1775.) FRASER (ALEXANDER), papermaker at Polton, 1768-1772. Fraser was manager of a small paper mill belonging to Adrian Watkins, His Majesty's Printer for Scotland. Because of this experience he was placed in charge of the large five vat paper mill at Polton. The Polton Paper-Mill Company became bankrupt in 1772, and the inefficient Fraser was discharged. The Polton Paper-Mill had a warehouse at the Royal Exchange, Edinburgh and Fraser was also in charge of this in 1771. (C.M., May 11, 1771; Waterston O.E.C. XXVII, 57-58.) FRASER (JOHN), running stationer in Edinburgh, 1754. We know of Fraser's existence through the account of a trial in The Scots Magazine . George Johnston, running stationer in Edinburgh, and Andrew Mason, servant to Captain Robert Merry, were tried for hamesucken. It is noticed that two accomplices, one of whom was John Fraser, running stationer in Edinburgh, were fugitate. The trial was on 9th December, 1754. (S.M., Dec., 1754, p. 592.) GALBRAITH (JOHN), printer in Glasgow, 1771-1773. Nothing has been discovered about this printer. Ewing lists him as having been in business in Glasgow from 1771-1773. GILMOUR (WILLIAM), bookseller in Glasgow, 1768-1771. This young bookseller who died in January, 1771, was a partner with his father in publishing The Glasgow Weekly Chronicle . Gilmour published a number of books in partnership with W. Bell, including Thomas Boston's Select Discourses on a Variety of Practical Subjects in 1768. (Old Glasgow, pp. 394-395.) GLAS (JOHN), bookseller and divine; bookseller in Dundee, 1740-1744. This is the well known founder of the Glasite Church. He was born in 1695, and in 1728 moved to Dundee after being deposed from his charge at Tealing. He moved to Perth in 1733 but seems to have come back to Dundee. He is specifically described as a bookseller in a number of advertisements in The Caledonian Mercury , and probably established the business carried on by his son Thomas (cf. Bushnell, p. 311). (C.M., Dec. 12, 1743; Jan 31, 1744; E.E.C., April 21, 1740.) GRANT (WILLIAM), merchant and bookseller in Elgin, 1757.

GRAY (G or GEORGE?), bookseller in Edinburgh, 1760-1763 (1801?) In January 1760, George Gray, merchant in the Parliament house, is listed in The Caledonian Mercury as one of twenty Edinburgh booksellers stocking The British Magazine . In 1763 his name appears on the title page of Les Avantures de Telemaque, Fils d'Ulysse par feu Messire Francois de Salignac de la Mothe Fenelon. . . . A Edimbourg: De l'imprimerie de J. Bruce et Societe: et se vend chez A. Kincaid &amp; J. Bell, J. Brown, G. Gray et J. Wood. MDCCLXIII (Copy A.U.L.). The creditors of one George Gray, bookseller in Edinburgh, met on 12th. June, 1801, to consider an offer of composition of 15/- in the £. This may be the same man. (C. M., Jan. 9, 1760; D.W.A., May 8, 1801.) GRIERSON (J.), bookseller in Dumfries, 1745-1749. In July, 1749, Grierson is named as one of the provincial booksellers holding proposals for an edition of Bp. Burnet's Exposition of the Thirty-nine Articles , while in October, 1749, he was also receiving subscriptions for an edition of The Whole Works of Flavius Josephus published by R. Fleming, Edinburgh. Subscriptions are taken in by the Booksellers of Edinburgh and Glasgow and by R. Fleming, the publisher, second shop below the Laigh Coffeehouse, Edinburgh, at Aberdeen by A. Thomson, and R. Farquhar; at Perth by R. Morison; at Dundee by T. Glas; at Stirling by J. Jeffries; at Dumfries by J. Grierson and at Irvine by G. Leechman. (C.M., July 18, 1745; Feb. 14, 1749; Oct 5, 1749.)

Hamilton was also a printer of playing cards and the cards were 'printed, made, and to be sold by James Hamilton at his house on the South side of the head of the Canongate a little above St. John's Cross, 1691.' Hamilton's mill at Restalrig was on a little stream called 'The River of Tumble.' Hamilton was still in business in 1693. (Waterston O.E.C., XXV, 70; XXVII, 43.). HAMILTON (JOHN), printer in Edinburgh, 1767. John Hamilton, printer, was the publisher of a work to be printed by subscription called A Companion for the Festivals and Feasts of the Church of England by Robert Nelson. Subscriptions were taken in by John Hamilton, printer, at the foot of Burnet's Close. (A.J., May 18 1767). HAMILTON (WILLIAM), papermaker at Penicuik, 1716. William Hamilton was the son of James Hamilton of Little Earnock. This Hamilton made paper at Penicuik from 1716. He acquired the mill from his famous grandmother, Mrs Agnes Campbell or Anderson. Hamilton was later a papermaker at Redhall Mill in Colinton. (Waterston O.E.C., XXV, 70; XXVII, 50.) HENDERSON (J.), bookseller in Abernethy, 1747. It seems unlikely that J. Henderson gained his living only from bookselling in such a small town as Abernethy, but he is named in the imprint of The Acts and Proceedings of the Associate Synod as one of the many stockists of this work in small Scottish towns. (St A.U.L.; A.U.L.) HENDERSON (ROBERT), warehousekeeper to the White Paper Company of Scotland, 1699-1703. Henderson signed on 29 July, 1699, an obligation to the tacksmen of the White Paper Company as being accountable as store and warehousekeeper to the company. On 8 May, 1703, Henderson signed another obligation undertaking to account for his intromissions. He had been imprisoned in the Tolbooth, Edinburgh, 'for aledged imbazelling the effects belonging to the said manufactory,' and was released by his employers. (Waterston O.E.C., XXV, 66-67.) HENDERSON (W.), bookseller in Dunfermline, 1747. The sole fact known concerning this man is that he sold The Acts and Proceedings of the Associate Synod in 1747. (St. A.U.L.; A.U.L.) HOME (ARCHIBALD), papermaker in Dalry, 1675. Home's name is given by Waterston in his invaluable list. (Waterston O.E.C., XXV, 70.) HUME (D.), bookseller in Glasgow, 1760. I have found no other reference to this bookseller except the fact that he is named in The Caledonian Mercury in January, 1760, as one of the Scottish booksellers selling The British Magazine or Monthly Repository for Gentlemen and Ladies . (C.M., Jan. 9, 1760.) HUNTER (G.), printer and bookseller in Paisley, 1772. Hunter's name is found in 1772 in the imprint of a work entitled A Cry from the Dead, or, The Ghost of the Famous Mr. James Guthrie Appearing . . . . ( cf. J. H. Baxter, A Bibliography of St. Andrews , (St Andrews [1924], no. 494). HUTCHESON (------) or HUTCHINSON, bookseller in Greenock, 1749-1751. Hutchison is named as one of the booksellers stocking The New Practice of Piety , a London publication, in The Caledonian Mercury in July, 1749. In 1751 he is specifically named as a bookseller in several advertisements for Dr. Anderson's Original Pills and Lozenges. (C.M., July 31, 1749; Feb. 10, 1751; April 2, 1751.) IMLACH (JAMES), bookseller and stationer in Banff, 1770-1773. In September, 1770, James Imlach and James Smith, Merchants in Banff, advertised that they had engaged a bookbinder to supply the binding needs of their customers. They also reveal that they sold books and stationery, and had a circulating library in which there were 'a large assortment of curious and entertaining Books . . . which are lent out by the Year, Half Year, or Quarter.' It is also clear from the files of The Aberdeen Journal that Imlach had book auctions in March, 1773, and sold The Aberdeen Almanack . (A.J., March 15, 1773; Jan. 4, 1773; Sept. 17, 1770.)

      <field name="heading_text">Franklin's Poor Richard Almanacs : Their Printing and Publication by C. William Miller *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On December 28, 1732, Benjamin Franklin announced in the Pennsylvania Gazette that he had just published the first edition of a new almanac, the Poor Richard for 1733 , by Richard Saunders, Philomath. The address to the reader was an amusing one in which Richard pleaded poverty as his reason for undertaking the writing of the almanac and concluded with the prediction that Mr. Titan Leeds, the writer of the most popular almanac in the Middle Colonies, would die in October of the ensuing year. The Swiftian trick was an old one, and Franklin's delaying until after the other Philadelphia almanacs were on sale to launch his new publication seems on the surface to have been ill-timed, but the purchasers liked what they read, bought out the first edition, and called for a second, and then a third during the early weeks in January. In this final printing Franklin appears either to have over-extended himself or to have set his sights on a market larger than that of the Province of Pennsylvania, for in March, 1733, he shipped 500 almanacs to his partner Whitmarsh in Charleston, and in the following August, 300 and 200 almanacs respectively to his brother James in Newport and Thomas Fleet in Boston, this last at 1/5/0 per hundred, a figure twenty-five per cent higher than Franklin was to charge Whitmarsh for new ones the next year. It is remarkable enough that a Boston bookseller would be interested in Philadelphia almanacs which were almost out of date—harder to believe that he would buy them for the price he did. Perhaps in the intervening months the reputation of the Poor Richard had spread to New England, and Fleet saw an opportunity belatedly to satisfy the curiosity of his customers. In any case Franklin successfully rid himself of the remainder of his third impression and made a start in creating a geographically wider market for his next year's almanac. Thus began the successful publication of the Poor Richard almanacs, a series that ran on into the nineteenth century though Franklin was responsible as author only for the first twenty-five, those from 1733 to 1758. By 1739 the sales had risen so sharply that the almanac-maker presented himself in his preface as hard-pressed to justify any longer his name "Poor" Richard, but excused himself jestingly with the claim that "When I first began to publish, the printer made a fair Agreement with me for my copies, by virtue of which he runs away with the greatest Part of the Profit." Eventually as Franklin states in his Autobiography the printing reached "annually near ten thousand" 1 copies, and when finally in the almanac for 1758 Franklin strung together a selection of his wise-sayings in the form of an old man's rambling discourse on economy, publishers here in the colonies and in Europe began reprinting the piece under the title A Way to Wealth and quickly created for Poor Richard an international reputation. So much for the widespread popularity of Franklin's almanacs and the main facts of their publication which to Franklin scholars are a familiar story. My principal concern here is to deal with the hitherto unattended study of the printing of these famous almanacs: (1) the imposition, (2) the determination of reimpressions, (3) the problems of the text, and finally (4) their sale and distribution. Before I turn to this fourfold discussion, however, it is necessary to clarify two matters. The first is that, under the name of Richard Saunders, Franklin published not one but three separately titled almanacs: the original Poor Richards from 1733 to 1747, the enlarged Poor Richards Improved from 1748 to 1758, and starting in 1741, the much smaller Pocket Almanacs . I plan in this paper to deal only with the first two series of publications. The Pocket Almanacs , strikingly different in format and text from the others, merit separate study. The second matter needing brief consideration is the number of copies extant today. Franklin, as we noted earlier, fixed the peak number of copies printed in any one year as near ten thousand, but he does not tell us when publication reached that level; it is improbable that he was printing anything like that number in the first years. But even if, from the number of copies preserved, we were to assume that he ran off 3600 copies in 1733, and half again as many in each of the next few years, it is clear at the outset that we can scarcely hope to reconstruct the full history of their printing. No one library has a complete run of the first fifteen almanacs. Of the 1733 almanac there exist two copies, neither of which is the first state of the first printing where Franklin acknowledged in the Gazette that he had mistakenly transposed two pages. The largest number of copies preserved for any single year is twelve; the average for most of the others is eight, though of the Poor Richards for 1734, 1735, and 1745, we have but three copies apiece. Copies of the Poor Richards Improved are somewhat more numerous. The average for each of the years from 1748 to 1758 is seventeen, with eleven libraries possessing complete runs though approximately one-quarter of these are imperfect. 2 With this background we may turn now to the first of the major considerations—the format and imposition of the first fourteen of the original Poor Richards , from the start in 1733 through the almanac for 1746. In their perfect states these almanacs consist of three unsigned gatherings in 4's—in all, twelve leaves. The format is octavo with each four-leaf gathering consisting of one-half sheet of Pro Patria stock, a paper roughly 12½" by 15½" which Franklin used almost exclusively during his first decade of printing. Described in terms which an eighteenth-century London bookseller would understand, the Poor Richard resembles somewhat those British almanacs called "sorts." It devotes one, not two, pages to each month; offers the reader no blank pages for notes, though a handful have survived interleaved; and beginning with the almanac of 1735, it prints the holy days in black letter but without rubrication. Franklin had open to him two methods of imposition. He could have imposed formes of two of his three signatures together (twin half-sheet imposition), or he could have imposed together the outer and inner formes of a gathering (single half-sheet imposition), and after perfecting end with two copies of the same signature. The evidence points to Franklin's journeymen having used regularly the second method, for numerous copies contain watermarks in all three gatherings and exhibit the use of the identical rules in the rule-frames of all three signatures. The second major consideration—that of determining reimpressions—offers no great obstacles among the very earliest Poor Richards . Franklin himself indicated "The Third Impression" of the 1733 almanac and the "Second Edition" of the Poor Richard for 1734 on the title-pages (Plate 1, no. 2). The difficulty arises, however, with the almanacs of the late 1730's and early 40's where one finds in the text little more than proof corrections, dropped letters, and changes in alignment as the bases for distinguishing the several impressions which Franklin advertised in the Gazette that he had run off. It is possible by these means to determine tentatively a few of the impressions, but the one piece of evidence for distinguishing the various reprintings, I discovered, lay not within the letterpress but in the varying configurations and broken parts of the single rules framing each page of text. Confirmation of the validity of this evidence occurs first in the labeled later printings of the 1733 and 1734 Poor Richards where the rule-frame for each page differs in its configuration from those in the earlier printings, and, second, in the direct and consistent correspondence between frame-rule patterns and marked variants in the text. Working with the evidence of the varying rule patterns, I turned first to the 1737 almanac where among the seven extant copies there occur no variants in the text. The compositor in imposing his formes treated the frame-rules as parts of the furniture and after each machining inserted the letterpress for the new forme page for page into positions occupied by the corresponding pages in the previous forme. All seven copies are clearly from the same printing with the rule-frames matching exactly, gathering after gathering in both the outer and inner formes. Distinguishing the several impressions of the 1738 almanac is more difficult, partly because the printing of the Poor Richards had apparently by this year settled into a routine shop procedure involving compositors with different work habits hurrying to complete their jobs, and partly because it became evident that the rule-frame configurations while suggestive offered too many variations to be completely reliable evidence. The only trustworthy guide here proved to be several distinctive broken frame-rule fragments in one series of formes. These could be traced in whatever position they occurred. With their help it was possible to distinguish two impressions of the 1738 almanac. The compositor in this year followed the method of imposition of his fellow worker in the 1737 Poor Richard with but one exception. Instead of transferring his furniture page for page and corresponding forme for forme, he moved it in one impression exhibited by the Huntington copy from inner A to outer B and C, and in the other impression, of which the remaining ten preserved copies are examples, from outer A to inner B to outer C. The surest way of telling the two impressions apart is to locate and follow the reoccurrences of a short (7 mm.) side-rule fragment appearing always near the top of the frame. In the one impression it stands as a part of the right side-rule on A2, B1, and C1; in the other, it forms a part of the left side-rule on A2 v , B1 v , and C2 v . The proof for determining which of the two impressions of the 1738 almanac was first printed is equally clear-cut. In the Huntington copy page B3 v (Plate 3, no. 1) exists in the unproofed state; the identical page in the New York Public copy (Plate 3, no. 2) and the other nine extant copies is corrected. Since the rule-frame evidence just presented indicates that the printing of the Huntington copy was a continuous process, the priority claimed for B3 v holds for the other pages of the text as well; and the Huntington copy stands, therefore, as the one preserved example of the first impression; the remaining ten copies, as examples of the second. Distinguishing the reimpressions of the 1739, 1740, and 1742 almanacs is not so simple as that for the 1738 almanac. For one reason, not all of these almanacs have broken rules; but more important, I encountered evidence that makes futile the attempt to label precisely the several reprintings of these three almanacs. The copies of the Poor Richard for 1739 highlight the problem. A broken top-rule in the American Philosophical Society copy with the break toward the left occurs on A3 v , B4 v , and C3 v (Plate 3, no. 3), a not unexpected inner-outer-inner alternation. The same broken top-rule occurs also in all three signatures of the Boston Public copy, but this time the rule falls on C4 v rather than on C3 v , and in the A and C signatures is turned about so that the break is closer to the right than to the left—all evidence pointing clearly to another printing. The difficulty arises with the B signature where the rule break on B4 v lies closer to the left than to the right, just as in the APS copy. Any speculation that the MB copy is unique, and this confusion perhaps the result of sophistication, is demonstrated to be false, for the copies in the Rosenbach, Yale, Pennsylania, and Library Company collections agree with the Boston Public. The lone reasonable explanation which does not contradict the orderly procedure of imposition exhibited by the other Poor Richards is that Franklin's binders stitched together at random half-sheets from different printings. This explanation would help also in accounting for the odd combination of gatherings in the Franklin Institute copy where the rule break on A3 v lies to the right as in the MB copy, but where the B and C gatherings, unlike those of any other extant copy, contain no broken rules—evidence that Franklin either replaced the fragmented rules during the second impression or ran off still a third impression. The likeliest explanation for this apparent confusion which I can offer, and I do so only conjecturally, is this. Franklin, knowing that he could not tie up his press at any time long enough to run off all the copies of an almanac needed in a given year, anticipated the demand by machining several smaller impressions as his press fell free. A printing of 1200 copies run off at the rate of 250 sheets an hour would take only a day and one-half of steady presswork if Franklin's pressmen could match the pace which those in Moxon's day were capable of setting. 3 After each of the printings except the last, Franklin normally kept his type standing, having removed the type pages from the forme, laid aside the rules, and bound the pages of standing type with twine until they were needed for another run. When that time came, his compositor reimposed the type pages, fitted them with new rules or the old ones in whatever configuration they happened to fall, and locked his forme. Thus, it is possible to account for the several different impositions which probably represented in Franklin's thinking merely interrupted segments of a single long machining and can only technically, therefore, be termed distinct impressions. Further, it explains how when Deborah Franklin and her helpers came to the stitching, they had sheets from two or three printings to draw upon. The format and imposition of the last of the original Poor Richards , the almanac for 1747, differ from those of its predecessors and offer an easy transition to the consideration of the printing of the Poor Richards Improved , the first of which appeared in the following year, 1748. The 1747 almanac, like the earlier ones, contains three unsigned gatherings in fours, but the format in this year is duodecimo, not octavo. The chain-lines run horizontally and segments of watermarks appear toward the top of the outer margins. Franklin had thus in 1747 discarded his three Pro Patria half-sheets per copy in favor of one sheet of demi, roughly 15" by 20" and marked with a fleur-de-lis. The shift from octavo to duodecimo, I believe, was experimental, looking forward to the publication in 1748 of his "Improved" almanac, enlarged to thirty-six pages. This increase permitted Franklin to devote two pages of text to each month in imitation, as he explained in the preface, of the "well known method" of his friend Jacob Taylor, whose long established almanac had stopped appearing with his death in 1746. Franklin in the interval had arranged with the colonial papermakers to supply him with adequate supplies of the larger sheets—the initials in the watermarked paper of the later almanacs can be traced to local mills—and had almost certainly acquired a new press with a larger platen than his first one. The firm of Franklin and Hall owned at the dissolution of their partnership in January, 1766, according to James Parker, "Three Presses, one much shattered." 4 The Poor Richards Improved for 1748 to 1758 were printed on one and one-half sheets of demi paper imposed in duodecimo with six signed gatherings, A 4 B 2 C 4 D 2 E 4 F 2 . It is likely that Franklin and Hall followed the established practice of printing this new almanac in three half-sheets as they had done with the old one, but there is no clear evidence to prove the point. In these later almanacs each page of text is enclosed with a frame of double-rules usually so well fitted that they offer no distinctive variations in configuration helpful in distinguishing reimpressions. The formes do contain a series of recurring broken rules, but their evidence is useful only in establishing how David Hall, Franklin's former journeyman, and after 1747 his working partner, handled the storing of the standing type used in succeeding editions. It had been Franklin's practice from the outset to keep standing as much of the text of the Poor Richards as he could reprint with only slight alteration the following year; this included the title-page, the month head-titles, the numbering of the days, the holy days set in black letter, a group of recurring features, and nearly all of the final signature—the places and dates of court sessions and fairs, advertisements, and the routes with mileage from Philadelphia northeastward to Norridgewock and southwestward to Charleston. He stored this type without the accompanying frame-rules. Starting with the Poor Richard Improved for 1748 , Hall carried over from one year to the next the double-rule frames with the standing type. Two broken side-rules present in the 1748 almanac reappear in the frames of copies for each succeeding year until 1758 when Hall replaced all of the frame-rules. James Parker, Franklin's former partner in New York and his agent at the dissolution of the Franklin-Hall partnership in 1766, confirms the bibliographical evidence of Hall's practice by a chance remark in a letter to Franklin in England dated February 3, 1766, some two months after the 1766 almanac had been printed: ". . . we weigh'd the Forms and Pages of Almanacks etc. with all their Rules in and about them. . .." 5 The analysis of the printing procedures for the original Poor Richards and for the Poor Richards Improved just presented indicates comparatively few significant departures from normal printer's practice; it does, however, verify Franklin's announcement of reprintings, sometimes as frequently as three within a year, especially among the almanacs from 1733 to 1747. The next question—and the third major consideration in this paper—is what textual variations do the almanacs show, particularly those several times reprinted. At the outset it is worth remembering that printers thought of these publications as primarily a money-making venture. They ran off large quantities of the popular ones, sold them very cheaply, and since the demand fell largely during the months of December and January, realized a quick return on their investment. Franklin's attitude toward his Poor Richards , I am convinced, was no exception despite his being author as well as printer and despite his growing pride in the widespread popularity of his almanac. My collating of the texts of the extant copies has turned up frequent textual variation, but no extensive rewriting. Franklin's chief concern was to see his original text reproduced in type accurately and literally correctly. The many changes that occur stem almost entirely from efforts to make do with inadequate stocks of type or from his workmen's faulty practices, over which, even during his years as master, Franklin seemed helpless to exercise control. Like any good printer he insisted that his almanac copy be proofread; this practice did not, of course, prevent some unproofed sheets like the B gathering in the Huntington copy of 1738 (Plate 3, no. 1) from getting into circulation. Stop-press corrections waste press time; consequently few of them are to be found in the Poor Richards . Franklin's practice where several impressions were planned was usually to make the corrections between printings. In the lone impression of the 1745 almanac Franklin did, however, stop his press, but only long enough to insert an errata list in the A signature covering the misprints in gatherings B and C. In doing so, he indicates incidentally the reverse order in which he machined the signatures. First, he ran off the C gathering, the one which consisted largely of text kept standing from year to year and which could therefore be made ready most conveniently for the press, then the B gathering, and, finally, the A signature, containing the preface, the portion which Franklin, were he pressed for time, could compose last without delaying the printing of the greater portion of the almanac. That the errata list is actually a stoppress insertion is evident in that it occurs in the New York Public copy (Plate 3, no. 4) but is missing from that of the American Antiquarian Society. The major factor contributing to widespread textual variation, however, especially in the original Poor Richards , was Franklin's limited font of long primer, both text letter and planet sorts, and his very short supply of long primer black letter. The frequent scattered variants conjure up a picture of Franklin's compositors continually filching letter from the standing type of the almanacs between printings for use in other current printing, and later replacing it, at times carelessly. In several Poor Richards one finds new literal errors occurring in second and third impressions which carry proof corrections caught after the first run. The greatest disturbance in the text appears in those few instances where the compositors were forced for lack of letter to tear down whole pages or entire signatures and then reset them, probably hurriedly, for the new settings are often textually inferior to the original ones. The reset page in the 1740 almanac, for instance, is markedly faulty by Franklin's standards (Plate 4, no. 3). So far I have dealt generally with the many minor variants to be found throughout the texts of the Franklin almanacs, particularly in the early ones. Once the printing house began to prosper, acquire additional fonts and presses, and increase the number of journeymen, the printing of the Poor Richards became a less eventful procedure. By 1750 Hall was running off most of his yearly large editions as a single operation. The variants disappear except where stop-press changes were intended beforehand or a rare mistake occurs. It remains now to discuss in detail those almanacs notable for their variants, certain of which have heretofore gone unrecorded. Those widely recognized for years by collectors and rare book dealers include the two printings of the 1733 almanac. The earlier Rosenbach Museum copy is reproduced in the initial volume of The Writings of Benjamin Franklin (1959) and "The Third Impression" owned by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania was reprinted in facsimile by The Duodecimos in 1894. Of the twenty-four pages in the Rosenbach copy, four entire pages and portions of six others are in a setting different from that of the HSP copy. Franklin announced in the Gazette three impressions of the 1733 almanac. Whether the Rosenbach copy is a part of the corrected issue of the first impression—it does not have the months of September and October transposed—or of the second impression it is not possible to determine in the light of present knowledge. Well known also is the unique copy of the "Second Edition" of the 1734 almanac in the library of the American Philosophical Society (Plate 1, no. 2). Three of its pages and portions of three others are in a different setting from that of the first edition. The textual variants in it as in the 1733 almanac resetting are confined to changes in capitalization, spelling, and punctuation. Equally well known are Franklin's two stop-press alterations in the almanacs of 1744 and 1748, designed it seems to stimulate wider sale of his Poor Richards outside the Province of Pennsylvania. In the Huntington and HSP copies of the 1744 almanac Franklin has altered the imprint to read: "Printed and sold by B. FRANKLIN . Sold also by JONAS GREEN at Annapolis " (Plate 5, no. 2). No other bookseller enjoyed this special designation in the entire twenty-five years of Franklin's authorship. The alternate page settings of F1 v in the 1748 almanac are, for readers living in the Middle Colonies, a listing of the Pennsylvania governors, speakers of the Assembly, and mayors of Philadelphia (Plate 5, no. 3); and, for New England readers, a listing of the dates of court sessions in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island (Plate 6, no. 1). Two other such substitutions which appear to have escaped notice occur in the Boston Public copy of the 1749 almanac (Plate 6, no. 2) and in the Yale, Huntington, and New Jersey Historical Society copies of the 1751 almanac. In the MB copy of 1749 the page-long listing of the New England court dates appears on F2 in place of " A TABLE for the more ready casting up of Coins, in Pennsylvania" found in all the other copies of the 1749 almanac which I have examined; in the Yale, Huntington, and New Jersey Historical Society copies of 1751 the same New England court list replaces on F2 v the mileage table for roads northeastward and southwestward found regularly in preserved copies of the 1751 Poor Richard Improved . In the MB, New Jersey Historical Society, Huntington and Yale copies the court list is printed from the same body of standing type, differing from the New England court list in the MB copy of the 1748 almanac (Plate 6, no. 1) only in the relineation of the Connecticut court list and the expansion of the text of the courts of Rhode Island. The variants in the almanacs of 1736, 1749, and 1755 constitute the principal new material emerging from this study. That of 1755 is more of a bibliographical oddity than an important textual change. Hall's compositor reversed in his imposition of the D signature the two pages of the month of September (Plate 8, no. 3), committing once again the mistake Franklin had made in his first Poor Richard . The only copy that I have found with the error is that in the Boston Public Library; the other extant copies show the correct arrangement. More significant is the discovery that the copy of the 1736 Poor Richard in the Library of the American Philosophical Society is a unique resetting (Plate 2) —the one almanac of the original fifteen which may be said to exist virtually in two editions, though Franklin gave no hint of this fact either on the title-page or in his announcement in the Gazette . In all, seven copies of the almanac have come down to us, one of them from the second printing, the result possibly of Franklin's having to work with a limited font of long primer; the other six, parts of the first uncorrected edition. The several jobs he had in hand at the time reveal, I think, the cause of his difficulties. In the final months of 1735, Franklin's shop-force was working on three almanacs, Franklin's and those of John Jerman and Jacob Taylor, the largest number which Franklin had yet attempted to print in one year. All three are advertised as "now in press" in the Gazette on November 13. If we may rely on the "Just Published" announcements that appear in the later issues of the Gazette for the order in which Franklin printed the almanacs, the Jerman almanac was finished first (November 27). Jerman invariably included some features so similar to those later used by Franklin in the Poor Richards that the printer found it convenient to print whole pages of the same type-setting in both almanacs. The second almanac printed was Franklin's (December 4), and then came Taylor's (December 24). Once the presswork was completed on the Poor Richard , it is clear from a comparison of the APS copy with the earlier ones that the compositor distributed the type for all pages except the title and the final four leaves, the greater portion of which Franklin regularly kept standing from year to year. One can only guess at the reasons for Franklin's consenting to the distribution of the type. Perhaps he thought he had printed enough copies to satisfy the trade and then later discovered that he had underestimated the demand, or it could be that if he kept the text of his Poor Richard standing, his compositor would lack sufficient letter to set the Taylor almanac. Whatever the circumstances, this much is clear. At some point after running off Taylor's almanac, Franklin saw that he needed more copies of his own almanac. In the type-setting that followed, more extensive by far than that in any of the other original Poor Richards , Franklin added point to his jesting in the preface by italicizing the phrases "appear publickly" and "in print" (Plate 2, no. 2), corrected several transposed planet symbols on A3 v , replaced two black-letter T's mistaken for C's on B4 v , and made a major change in typographical arrangement that set the pattern for his later almanacs. It is this last alteration that offers conclusive proof of the order of the two settings rather than the textual corrections, for in the other Poor Richards , much resetting usually done in haste tends to yield inferior, not superior textual readings. In the almanacs prior to this one of 1736 and in the first printing of this almanac, Franklin set in italic type both his weather predictions and his wise-sayings throughout the left-hand column of the calendar for each month. In the second edition of 1736, and in the later almanacs, he set the prognostications in roman and only the wise-sayings in italic, presumably to distinguish the one from the other more clearly for his reader. The evidence that Franklin had decided in the first printing to set both predictions and proverbs in italic type, and only later decided to reset the predictions in roman rests with the typographical pattern found in "November" and "December" (C1 and C1 v ), the two months out of the twelve in which the type was left standing after the first printing, and therefore used again in the second printing. In these two months both predictions and wise-sayings are set in italic type. Hence in six of the seven copies of the 1736 almanac, which I have labeled parts of the first edition, the typographical pattern is consistent throughout all twelve months; in the APS copy—the lone copy of the second printing —the pattern is consistent for the first ten months, and then markedly different in the last two. The Poor Richard Improved for 1749 offers clearly the most interesting variants I have encountered in this investigation. A starting point is the attention Franklin himself focused upon its text in the preface to his almanac for 1750. He wrote: In my last, a few Faults escap'd; some belong to the Author, but most to the Printer. Let each take his Share of the Blame, confess, and amend for the future. In the second Page of August , I mention'd 120 as the next perfect Number to 28; it was wrong, 120 being no perfect Number; the next to 28 I find to be 496. . . . In the 2d Page of March , in some Copies, the Earth's Circumference was said to be nigh 4000, instead of 24000 Miles, the Figure 2 being omitted at the Beginning. This was Mr. Printer's Fault; who being also somewhat niggardly of his Vowels, as well as profuse of his Consonants, put in one Place, among the Poetry, mad , instead of made , and in another wrapp'd , instead of warp'd; to the utter demolishing of all Sense in those Lines, leaving nothing standing but the Rhime. These, and some others, of the like kind, let the Readers forgive, or rebuke him for, as to their Wisdom and Goodness shall seem meet. . . . (A1 v ) Poor Richard's confession appears to be a full and candid one both for his own errors and those of his printer, and couched as it is in somewhat bantering terms was evidently designed to amuse his readers and to dispel any bad opinion they may have harbored concerning the previous edition. Further, some readers must have remembered Poor Richard's earlier insistence in perpetuating the jest that he was an individual in his own right (Plate 2, no. 2), and not Franklin, both the author and the printer. But in the 1749 almanac for the first time matters were different. Franklin was only the author, and David Hall, Franklin's newly acquired partner, had the sole responsibility for printing the almanac. The 1750 almanac preface read in this light may perhaps take on a somewhat different meaning, and with what mixed feelings Hall viewed Franklin's public reprimand of his work one can only guess. An examination of the text and printing of the 1749 almanac reveals even more interesting detail on what may possibly have been a momentarily strained relationship between the new partners. The almanac, I found, exists in not one but two printings, the only edition of the Poor Richards Improved to appear in this fashion. Further, in the second impression the three pages of the address to the reader have been entirely reset (Plate 7, no. 2). What disturbed Franklin, now retired from an active role in the printing business and absorbed in his scientific studies, was, I suspect, finding in a copy of the first printing of the 1749 almanac which came to hand the omission of the "2" in the phrase "24000 Miles." His discovery of the error was mere chance, for the missing numeral having been pushed down had stopped inking during the run and was, therefore, neither the result of compositorial carelessness nor faulty proofreading. Three extant copies of the first machining, those in the Library of Congress, Boston Public, and the American Philosophical Society, reveal the "2" faintly inked. Franklin's statement ". . . in some Copies . . . the Figure 2 being omitted . . ." I construe to mean not the variant readings in the first printing, but the re-elevation of the numeral in the second impression where in the preserved copies it appears consistently. A non-inking type was, of course, no unique fault with Hall's printing. One can find a dozen occurrence of the same sort in the earlier Poor Richards printed during the years in which Franklin had been master of the printing house. If my assumption is accurate—and it is buttressed by the fact that none of the other errors mentioned in the 1750 preface were caught either by Franklin or Hall in time to be rectified in the second printing —then it was ostensibly the missing "2" that brought Franklin down to the printing shop to register a protest. What he found must have pleased him. Hall had completed his first impression and had in fact ordered the distribution of the type in the three pages of the preface. It is difficult to believe that Franklin would have insisted on Hall's resetting the three pages and running off another impression merely to correct one error. Evidently Hall had been obliged to redistribute some of his standing letter and free his press for a more urgent job, and planned on a second impression later. Franklin saw to it that the "2" was inking properly and took the opportunity to revise and enlarge the section on the Courts of Assize in Maryland (Plate 7, no. 4). What Franklin does not mention in the 1750 preface is that he had discovered or had called to his attention another error of his own making which he quietly corrected—or thought he had corrected—in the only other rewritten passage to be found within different machinings of a single almanac. As an historical note under November he had written: "The 5 th of this month, November, seems to be a lucky day to the English church and British liberty; for on that day 1588, the popish gunpowder treason was detected; and on the same day in 1688, just one hundred years after, our glorious deliverer from popery and slavery, King William, landed at Torbay ." (Plate 8, no. 1). In the second impression Franklin, of course, changed "1588" but to "1604" instead of the correct date, 1605, and deleted "just one hundred years after"; reluctant, however, to forego the allusion to significant events occurring in the year '88 of succeeding centuries, he added: " Eighty-eight seems likewise a lucky year; for in 1588 was the Spanish Armada defeated" (Plate 8, no. 2). Finally as the fourth major consideration in this paper, it seems appropriate in an investigation that concerns itself with the history of the printing and publication of the Poor Richards , to attempt to bring together the sketchy and scattered facts relating to their sale and cost. From the outset in 1733 Franklin designed his almanac for use principally in Pennsylvania and the surrounding colonies. On his title-page he announced that it was "Fitted to the Latitude of Forty Degrees," which is that of the city of Philadelphia, but went on to add, that it ". . . may without sensible Error, serve all the adjacent Places, even from Newfoundland to South-Carolina " (Plate 1, no. 1). In his list of court session dates he included from the beginning those of New York, New Jersey, and Maryland as well as Pennsylvania. The substitution of the page of New England courts appeared with the first of the Poor Richards Improved in 1748, and reappeared in 1749 and 1751; the addition of the list of Virginia courts came later, in 1754, 1755, and again in 1758. The single greatest reason for the success of the Poor Richards was Franklin's ability to spice the prosaic matter of the ordinary almanac with more engaging commentary than his competitors could write, but certainly most helpful in promoting the large sales were the publicity the almanacs received in his widely circulated Pennsylvania Gazette and the willingness of a group of partners and friendly booksellers in colonies other than Pennsylvania to handle the Poor Richards and advertise them locally in their own newspapers. The entries in the extant Franklin account books 6 are too incomplete for one to estimate the total number of almanacs printed each year for sale outside of the province; we do know, however, that in the 1730's he was sending annually from 200 to 500 copies to his partners Whitmarsh and later Timothy in Charleston, to his brother James in Newport, and to Fleet in Boston (FAB I, 36-37). Starting with the 1743 almanac Franklin appears to have increased greatly the size of his printings. Thomas Fleet ordered 300 Poor Richards (FAB II, 54-55). Parker in New York received 2000 copies (pp. 91-92); James's widow in Newport, 600 (pp. 55-56); and Mrs. Timothy her usual 300 (p. 121). Green in Annapolis increased his order in 1743 to 1500 copies and took a like number in 1744 (p. 64), the year Green's name was added to the imprint of the lot he had purchased. After 1748 when Franklin began publishing his Poor Richard Improved , the size of the printings remained steady. Hall in 1765 credited the partnership with an aggregate total of 141,257 copies for the fourteen years from 1752 to 1765, 7 an average slightly in excess of the "near ten thousand" annually which Franklin had set down as an estimate in his memoirs. The information on the prices of the Franklin almanacs is even more fragmentary than that on the numbers printed. For the original Poor Richards we must rely almost entirely on the entries in the extant Franklin account books (FAB I and II), which list the number of copies sold but often omit the price charged as though Franklin kept the records of his almanac sales in a special ledger no longer preserved. The retail price of an individual copy Franklin tells us by oblique reference in the 1737 almanac preface was "Fi' pence," and the cost per dozen, 3 s. 6 d. , according to the "Just Published" announcement of the first Poor Richard in the Gazette for December 28, 1732. This is the same price which Franklin charged for the Jerman (FAB II, 47), Ball, or Birket by the dozen, and a half shilling cheaper than the almanacs of Leeds or Godfrey (FAB I, 37). The price of the Poor Richards in lots of 100 copies was understandably cheaper. To his favored Charleston partner Timothy in 1734, the cost was £1 per 100 (FAB I, 36), as it was likewise to Jonas Green of Annapolis in 1743 and 1744 (FAB II, 64), the years in which he bought 1500 copies; but normally the price per 100 was set at 1/5/0, a figure which held without change from 1732 to 1746 (FAB I, 37; II, 54, 63-64). The currency of Pennsylvania remained, in fact, remarkably stable during the entire twenty-five years of the publication of the Franklin almanacs and in the price of these publications, at least, reflected none of the inflationary pressures present in the currency of Massachusetts where the cost of the Ames almanacs, for instance, rose from 8 d. , or 6 s. a dozen, in 1743 to 1 s. 6 d. , or 12 s. a dozen, in 1749. 8 What exactly Franklin charged for a single copy of his Poor Richard Improved I have not yet been able to discover, but the statement which he inserted on the titles of his almanacs for 1748 and 1749 leaves no doubt that the cost had increased: " Note , This Almanack us'd to contain but 24 Pages, and now has 36; yet the Price is very little advanc'd." The inference is clear. The prospective buyer will be getting in this improved almanac half again as much reading matter as he once received, but without the commensurate increase in cost. The price is, in fact, "very little advanc'd" over the five pence which he has been accustomed to paying. Without the detailed evidence of any extant shop records to help fix the retail cost of an individual copy, one is obliged to work with several statements made by Parker in drawing up the balance sheet of the accounts of the firm of Franklin and Hall (AFH) early in 1766 on the occasion of the formal dissolution of the partnership. In entry four among the debits Hall charged Franklin 62/13/4 for 4000 Poor Richards Improved sent to his nephew in Newport over a ten-year period from 1752 to 1761. This which I take to be the most advantageous wholesale price at which the almanacs could be purchased amounts to 1/11/4 per 100, or about 3¾ d. a copy. In entry forty-one on the credit side Parker has analyzed the "Account of Almanacks printed and sold by D. Hall from 1752 to 1765" and lists first the "Poor Richards— 141,257 &amp;c.mmat; 4 d (sticking deducted)." This figure of 4 d. , I assume, was Hall's average wholesale price for a single copy of the improved almanac over a fourteen-year period, or 1/13/4 in lots of one hundred. To counterbalance those copies sold at 3¾ d. a piece to Franklin and possibly to the occasional bookseller who made a purchase of several thousand almanacs in one order, Hall would need to sell other copies at a higher price. These were in all probability the Poor Richards he sold by the dozen at about 4½ d. per copy to the many small shopkeepers in Philadelphia and the surrounding communities. If one may reason then on the basis of comparative prices asked by Franklin in the sale of his original Poor Richards and in that of his Poor Richards Improved , the figures in tabulated form would fall like this: Poor Richards Price per hundred Price per copy £ s d d Wholesale to partners 1 0 0 2⅖ Wholesale 1 5 0 3 Per dozen 3½ Per copy 5 Poor Richards Improved £ s d d Wholesale to partners 1 11 4 3¾ Wholesale 1 13 4 4 Per dozen 4½ * Per copy 6 * And thus the retail price of six pence per copy seems the most reasonable one which Franklin might ask. It would afford him the same two-penny differential between the wholesale and retail prices which he had established for his earlier almanacs, and still fit the description of a sum "very little advanc'd" over five pence, the price which his readers had got used to paying for an original Poor Richard .

      <field name="heading_text">Jefferson as Collector of Virginiana by Richard Beale Davis</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On March 29, 1764 the clerk in the bookshop connected with the Virginia Gazette office in Williamsburg recorded the purchase by Thomas Jefferson, for ten shillings, of a copy of "Stith's History of Virginia." 1 This is the earliest surviving record of the acquisition of an item of Virginiana by the young man who was later to gather in his library the most significant material pertaining to his native state ever assembled by an individual. "When young, I was passionately fond of reading books of history," 2 he commented in 1787. In 1789 he added that "[I am] sensible that I labour grievously under the malady of Biblomanie." 3 Still later he agreed with a fellow Virginian "that it is the duty of every good citizen to use all the opportunities which occur to him, for preserving documents relating to the history of our country." That "our country" here is his native state is proved by his next sentence, for William Waller Hening's Statutes at Large pertains only to Virginia: "That I have not been remiss in this while I had youth, health, and opportunity, is proved otherwise, as well by the materials I furnished toward Mr. Hening's invaluable collection of the laws of our country." 4 These statements afford a glimpse of the complex motivations behind this particular activity of Jefferson. He said several times that he was assembling a library which would be useful to him as a lawyer and as an American statesman. Since he was a Virginia lawyer and eventually a Virginian in national office, much of the material gathered to assist him in his profession was Virginian. And many items of Virginiana came to him incidentally or accidentally through his personal and public reputation as a scholar and author of Notes on the State of Virginia and through his positions in the national as well as state government. Americans and Europeans who had anything to say about Virginia frequently sent him copies of their books, with autograph inscriptions. Many actually dedicated the books to him. But Jefferson the collector of Virginiana was first of all an eighteenth-century colonial gentleman building a library which would answer all his needs. Like his distinguished predecessor William Byrd, he planned and gathered a general collection representing all fields of knowledge. Like his kinsmen Sir John and Peyton Randolph, he brought together the law books, some of them two centuries old, which might be practically useful. During his long life Jefferson gathered three libraries for himself and another for the University of Virginia. In his youth he inherited forty-odd books, useful ones, from his father Peter. He had added to these judiciously 5 until by 1770 his library was valued at £200. On February 21 of that year he lamented to his friend John Page the loss of his mother's house by fire, and his own loss, "of every pa[per I] had in the world, and almost every book" ( Papers , I, 34). Thus ended his first gathering. From this moment he began the steady accumulation of his greatest library in quality and quantity, that which he was to sell to Congress in 1814 to replace the national library destroyed by the British. The trouble, expense, and care which went into this collection is reflected in the wistfully proud letter of 1814 to Samuel H. Smith, who was negotiating the sale to Congress: You know my collection, its condition and extent. I have been fifty years making it, and have spared no pains, opportunity or expense, to make it what it is. While residing in Paris, I devoted every afternoon I was disengaged, for a summer or two, in examining all the principal bookstores, turning over every book with my own hand, and putting by everything which related to America, and indeed whatever was rare and valuable in every science. Besides this, I had standing orders during the whole time I was in Europe, on its principal book-marts, particularly Amsterdam, Frankfort, Madrid and London, for such works relating to America as could not be found in Paris. So that in that department particularly, such a collection was made as probably can never again be effected, because it is hardly probable that the same opportunities, the same time, industry, perseverance and expense, with some knowledge of the bibliography of the subject, would again happen to be in concurrence. During the same period, and after my return to America, I was led to procure, also, whatever related to the duties of those in the high concerns of the nation. So that the collection. . . extends more particularly to whatever belongs to the American statesman (September 21, L&amp;B, XIV , 191-192). The last sentence was intended, of course, to emphasize the appropriateness of the library for the Congress of the United States. The penultimate sentence summarizes very modestly the enormous labor and care of his collecting between 1789 and 1814. Miss E. Millicent Sowerby's recent invaluable Catalogue of the Library of Thomas Jefferson (5 vols., Washington, D.C., 1952-1959) supplies detailed and interesting information from his correspondence and book orders covering these years. 6 Booksellers all over America and western Europe supplied his demands. Professional dealers and publishers like John Stockdale and James Lackington in London, Armand Koenig of 'Strassburg,' Dufour of Amsterdam, Mathew Carey of Philadelphia, and Samuel Pleasants of Richmond, among several dozen, sought books for him. But he also called upon friends, men like Joseph Hopkinson in Philadelphia, to secure copies of significant items. According to the Catalogue published in 1815 after this collection became the Library of Congress, it contained approximately 3,200 items in about 6,500 volumes. Miss Sowerby, using both the 1815 Catalogue and an earlier manuscript rough-draft catalogue and counting in a somewhat different way, actually numbers 4,931 items, books and pamphlets, in her published list of those received by Congress. 7 Because so many of the items have disappeared, she was unable to check effectively the earlier count of number of volumes. Even before the wagon loads of this library began their slow journey towards Washington, Jefferson had begun collecting his third library, intended "to amuse" him in his old age. Again he resorted to professional agents like Carey and Dufief in Philadelphia, and he accepted the offers of friends abroad like David B. Warden, Richard Rush, and George Ticknor to procure for him convenient editions of the classics. A favorite agent, George Milligan of Georgetown, D.C., continued to bind and to procure books. 8 Individual admirers continued to contribute copies of their own writings. A sales catalogue of this collection, published in 1829, indicates that there were in this library by 1826 between 900 and 1,000 items. 9 It is understood that Miss Sowerby is now preparing a descriptive catalogue based on this list. Meanwhile the short-titles of the printed sales list may be fairly easily, though sometimes tentatively, identified. The last Jefferson library, that assembled for the University of Virginia, contained over 3,000 items in more than 7,000 volumes. Jefferson drew up its catalogue, persuaded friends like Madison and Ticknor to assist him, and in 1824 sent abroad an agent, Francis Gilmer, who was to procure both professors and books. 10 Particularly rich in science, it is the least rich in Virginiana, though there are some twenty-eight items in seventy-odd volumes, principally history and law, almost all of which duplicate items in one of Jefferson's personal libraries, which might be designated Virginiana. As some of the quotations from his letters given above indicate, Jefferson was at the same time an incidental and deliberate collector of Virginiana. Some items were thrust upon him. Others were simply constituent elements of his Americana assemblages. But he went to the trouble himself to secure many things about his "country" primarily for the sake of preserving them, as good collectors have often done. Almost two dozen of the printed Virginiana were authors' presentation copies, ranging from medical treatises to law reports. In various ways scattered items came into his possession from fellow Virginians such as his brother-in-law Dabney Carr, the Tory William and Mary Professor Samuel Henley, several members of the Corbin family, his physician George Gilmer, Lunsford Lomax, Philip Ludwell, his friend John Page, his kinsmen Beverley and Edmund Randolph and John Randolph of Roanoke, his son-in-law Thomas Mann Randolph, and Robert Beverley. Probably through his wife came seventeen books from the library of her father John Wayles and twenty-one from her first husband's brother Bathurst Skelton. 11 At various times and in various ways Jefferson obtained some ten volumes from the famous collection of William Byrd of Westover, 12 and sixteen bearing the autograph of his second son-in-law John Wayles Eppes. George Wythe bequeathed his library to his former student. Though only about thirty-one volumes from it now survive, in the Library of Congress, 13 some of the extant legal items are quite valuable. From the administrators of the estate of Richard Bland (1710-1776) Jefferson purchased whole segments of a library. Among the priceless items were a number of seventeenth and eighteenth-century manuscript records, to be discussed below. Perhaps the most valuable purchase, from any point of view, was of Jefferson's kinsman Peyton Randolph's library, "bookcases and all as they stood." 14 Much of this collection had come to Peyton from his father, the distinguished Sir John. More than fifty items survive from it today, including several priceless and unique volumes of early Virginia laws and records in manuscript. To add to these Bland and Randolph manuscripts, Jefferson's friend Page gave him a volume of unpublished laws once belonging to his grandfather Mathew Page. But more of all this later. Jefferson's famous cataloguing system, based upon the divisions of learning made by Francis Bacon, did not allow him to place all his Virginia materials together, though within subclasses they often do appear side by side. Jefferson sent his manuscript catalogue, with its three major divisions of History, Philosophy, and Fine Arts, to the Librarian of Congress, George Watterston, who used it with perhaps slight modification when he published the 1815 Catalogue of the Library of the United States (Washington, D.C.), a list of the books as they were received from Jefferson. Miss Sowerby in her five-volume Catalogue has followed the same system, listing in Volume One all of the History, in Volumes Two, Three, and part of Four the Philosophy, and in the remainder of Four and Five the Fine Arts and "[Polygraphical] Authors who have written on various branches." In order to indicate clearly the nature, quality, range, and significance of the Virginiana items it is necessary to depart somewhat from this awkward system of classification and group the material primarily according to format, allowing it to fall into natural subdivisions. Therefore printed books and pamphlets with Virginia as subject, or with Virginians as authors, or with Virginia imprints will be first considered. These will be followed by an account of his Virginia newspapers. Then his remarkable collection of Virginia manuscripts will be surveyed, and their use and means of preservation discussed. Unless otherwise indicated, references will be to his 1815 library, his greatest collection, for in it were most of his significant acquisitions. Within the format classifications suggested above, individual items will usually be discussed in the order in which they appear in the 1815 and 1952 (Sowerby) catalogue. 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. Printed Books and Pamphlets A. With Virginia as Subject and/or Virginians as Authors: In his Notes on the State of Virginia Jefferson emphasizes the importance of the study of the past: History, by apprizing [young men] of the past, will enable them to judge of the future; it will avail them of the experience of other times and other nations; it will qualify them as judges of the actions and designs of men; it will enable them to know ambition under every guise it may assume, and knowing it, to defeat its views ( L&amp;B , II, 207). In many other places he emphasizes History's significance. 16 It is one of the major classifications for his library, as noted above. Under it he had subdivisions of Civil and Natural; under Civil, Civil Proper and Ecclesiastical; under Civil Proper, Ancient and Modern; under Modern, Foreign, British, and American. Under American History, Sowerby gives ninety-two items (not counting newspapers, which have an informal subclass of their own). Of these only fifteen, including a dozen books, two pamphlets, and a manuscript volume are strictly Virginiana. But this is more by far than he has on any other state, and among the books are John Smith's Generall Historie (1632), Keith's History of the British Plantations in America. . . Part I Containing the History of Virginia (1738), William Stith's The History of the First Discovery and Settlement of Virginia [1747], John Daly Burk's History of Virginia (1804, 1805), William Robertson's History of America, Books IX and X (1799), and Robert Beverley's Histoire de la Virginie (1707, the French edition), all today, with the exception of Robertson, valuable items. Along with them are several George Washington items, including the Journal (1754), Official Letters to the American Congress (1795), Marshall's Life (1804, 1805, 1807; Jefferson was an original subscriber), Weems' Life (1808), and Ramsay's Life (1807). In addition there are Henry Lee's Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department (1812) and interesting pamphlets by Edmund Jennings and Lewis Littlepage. Before he died in 1826 Jefferson was able to replace some of these items which had gone to Congress. Again he had Keith's History (the same 1738 edition), Marshall's Washington , and several other Washington items including the Letters . He added the new Girardin supplement to John Daly Burk's History . William Wirt's Life of Patrick Henry (1817) and Lee's Memoirs of R. H. Lee (1825), along with a number of historical pamphlets incompletely identified in the 1829 sales list. Under the second division of History, Natural, Jefferson included Physics, Natural History Proper, and Occupations of Men. Under Physics were Natural Philosophy, Agriculture, Chemistry, Surgery, and Medicine. Under the last five subheadings Jefferson seems not to have done much deliberate collecting, although his letters show considerable interest in most of the topics discussed. Most of the items which might be designated as Virginiana are so because their authors were Virginians. Medical theses and essays from Edinburgh to Philadelphia by James McClurg, Theodorick Bland, William Tazewell, William Stokes, and Thomas and James Ewell discuss a variety of topics from yellow fever to the human bile and "asphyxia." Then here is John Rouelle's Complete Treatise on the Mineral Waters of Virginia (1792). Other books and pamphlets on agriculture (in this case both subject and author were frequently Virginian) were probably closer to Jefferson's personal interests. Here one finds John A. Binns' Treatise on Practical Farming (1803), Jacquelin Ambler's Treatise on the Culture of Lucerne (1800?), G. W. P. Custis' Address . . . on the Importance of Encouraging Agriculture and Domestic Manufactures (1808), John Randolph's Treatise on Gardening (1793), and John Taylor's famous Arator (1813). Under Natural History Proper appear other Virginians' books or pamphlets on surgery, the laws and property of matter, and The Noble and Useful Animal the Horse (Petersburg, 1811). Quite valuable among the botanical books is the Gronovius-Clayton Flora Virginica (1762), though it is not a first edition. And under the Technical Arts ( i.e. , "The Occupations of Men") there is Quesnay de Beaurepaire's interesting Memoire (1788) concerning the proposed Academy of the Sciences and Fine Arts for Richmond. James Rumsey "of Berkeley County, Virginia's" Explanation of the Steam Engine (1788) and William Tatham's prospectus for a Dismal Swamp Canal (1808) indicate that all of Jefferson's contemporary fellow-citizens were not farmers, politicians, lawyers, or physicians. In the years after 1814 Jefferson continued to receive medical treatises from the Ewells and replaced his editions of Binns, Randolph, Taylor, and Gronovius-Clayton. James Madison sent him his own Address on agriculture (probably that before the Agricultural Society of Albemarle). The letters show that in these last years Jefferson was more than ever the farmer. Under his second major division of Philosophy Jefferson had the headings Moral and Mathematical. Under Moral were Ethics and Jurisprudence; under Jurisprudence, Religious, Municipal, and Œconomical. Under Municipal were Domestic and Foreign; under Domestic were Equity, Common Law, Law Merchant, and Law Ecclesiastical. Under Œconomical were Politics and Commerce. Virginians contributed something in each of these classes. Joshua Peel, from Bedford County, dedicated to Jefferson his Truth and Reason: or, A Fair Investigation of many of those things which keep them in the shade delivered in a course of Theological Lectures (1805). Quaker and Virginia-born Warner Mifflin contributed to the Ethics of Nature and Nations A Serious Expostulation with Members of the House of Representatives of the United States [1793]. Mason Locke Weems, David Rice, Barnaby Nixon, Richard Watson, and an anonymous Anglican clergyman sent him sermons, letters, and addresses dated from 1797 through 1806, all placed in the Religious classification. Under the various Law classifications Jefferson listed a large number of Virginia items. What are perhaps the most valuable of them, the manuscript volumes, will be discussed later. But Jefferson was equally proud of his printed laws. In 1803 he wrote John Daly Burk that I possess a tolerably compleat set of the printed laws of Virginia. this being the only set in existence, (for they are lost from the offices) and being now resorted to from all parts of the state as the only resource for laws not to be found in the late publications, I have been obliged to decline letting the volumes go out of my possession further than Milton or Charlottesville, because the loss of a volume would be irreparable. . . . (February 21, Sowerby, I, 212). Jefferson owned John Purvis' A Complete Collection of all the Laws of Virginia now in Force ( c. 1684), A Collection of the Acts of Assembly (1733), the Revisal of 1661/2-1748, the Acts of Assembly (1661/2-1678), the Chancellor's Collection of Acts and Ordinances (1783); an eight-volume "collection of all the printed laws of Virginia" which included Purvis, the Revisals of 1733, 1748, and 1768, the "Fugitive Sheets of printed laws" of 1734-1772, and 1775-1783, and the Revisals of 1783 and 1794. He possessed William Waller Hening's Statutes at Large (1809, 1810, 1812). Among other items are his copy as committeeman of the Report of the Committee of Revisors appointed by the General Assembly of Virginia . . . in [1776] (1784); Draughts of Such Bills, as Have Been Prepared by the Committee Appointed under the Act, Intituled . . . . (1792); Edmund Randolph's Abridgement of the Public Permanent Laws of Virginia (1796); A Collection of all Such Acts of the General Assembly of Virginia, of a Public and Permanent Nature, as are now in force (1803); William Beverley's Abridgement (1728), John Mercer's Exact Abridgement (1737) and another edition of the same (1759); two accounts of the Burr trial (1807, 1808); George Webb's The Office and Authority of a Justice of the Peace (1736); Hening's The New Virginia Justice (1795); George Hay's Essay on the Liberty of the Press (1803), Bushrod Washington's Reports (1798-1799); Daniel Call's Reports (1801); William Tatham's Report of a Case (1794), and Hening and Munford's Reports (1808, 1809). The Common Law section of Virginiana is rounded off with a copy of The Charter, Transfer, and Statutes, of the College of William and Mary (1758). And the whole Law section concludes with a James Madison pamphlet on neutral trade (1805), Jefferson's own Report of the Secretary of State, on the Privileges and Restrictions on the Commerce of the United States in Foreign Countries . . . 1793 (1806), and An Abridgement of the Laws in Force and Use in His Majesty's Plantations; ( viz. ) of Virginia . . . . (1704). To these may be added some of the things received from George Wythe, including Wythe's Decisions of Cases in Virginia, by the High Court of Chancery . . . . (1795) and a set of six pamphlet Reports (c. 1796?) of cases with annotations in Wythe's hand. A number of these, notably Wythe's Chancery Decisions , Hening's New Virginia Justice , Washington's Reports , Mercer's Abridgement (1758), and a number of Acts of Assembly , Jefferson managed to duplicate after 1814. And according to the 1829 catalogue (see items 562-583) he added Revised Codes and Reports of the Session Acts of the 1814-1825 period, as well as Munford's General Index to the Virginia Law Authorities (1819). Under the subdivision of Politics Jefferson sent to Congress his largest number of printed items pertaining to Virginia. Of a little over thirteen hundred items from all nations, about one hundred are by Virginians, frequently on Virginia topics. In these books and pamphlets one may trace among other things the history of Democratic-Republican and Jeffersonian politics over a quarter of a century, from Jefferson's years in Paris to those of his retirement from public life. In this group are his own Act for Establishing Religious Freedom (an English-French edition of about 1786), A Summary View of the Rights of British America (a unique copy with manuscript notes by the author, c. 1774), An Appendix to the Notes on Virginia Relative to the Murder of Logan's Family [1800], the Speech of . . . delivered at his Instalment, March 4, 1801 [ First Inaugural Address ] (1801), A Test of the Religious Principles of Mr. Jefferson; Extracted (Verbatim) from His Writings (1800), Discorsi del Signore Tommaso Jefferson delli Stati Uniti di America fatti tradurre e pubblicare dall' Illustrissimo Signore Leandro Cathcart (Livorno, 1804), The Proceedings of the Government of the United States, in maintaining the Public Right to the Beach of the Missisipi, and adjacent to New-Orleans . . . . (1812, two copies), and Message from the President of the United States, Communicating Discoveries Made in Exploring the Missouri . . . by Captains Lewis and Clark . . . . (1806). And there is an interesting edition of Destutt de Tracy's Commentary and Review of Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws (Philadelphia, 1811) for which Jefferson wrote the Preface. The first President is also well represented in George Washington to the People of the United States, Announcing his Retirement from Public Life (1800), A Message of the President of the United States to Congress relative to France and Great-Britain [1793], and Letters from George Washington to Several of His Friends . . . 1776 ( c. 1795; Washington declared the 1778 edition of this spurious). And it is not remarkable that Jefferson's close friend James Madison is even better represented by The Federalist (1788; on the flyleaf Jefferson has identified the numbers by Madison); Letters of Helvidius: Written in Reply to Pacificus, on the President's Proclamation of Neutrality [1796], Political Observations (1795; Jefferson identifies this as Madison's), A Memoir, Containing an Examination of the British Doctrine, Which Subjects to Capture a Neutral Trade, Not Open in Time of Peace (1806), All Impressments Unlawful and Inadmissible (1806), Letters from the Secretary of State to Messrs . Monroe and Pinkney (1808), and Extract from a Letter from the Secretary of State to Mr. Monroe, Relative to the Impressments (1806). James Monroe naturally too is present: Some Observations on the Constitution &amp;c. (1788; Jefferson attributed this to Monroe), The Governor's Letter, of the 6th of December, 1802, to the Speaker of the House of Delegates of Virginia (1802), A View of the Conduct of the Executive in the Foreign Affairs of the United States, as Connected with the Mission to the French Republic during the Years 1794, 5, and 6 (1798), and Correspondence in Relation to the British Treaty of Peace (1808). Many Virginia followers of Jefferson's party from its beginnings to the War of 1812, and a few anti-Jeffersonians, are represented among the political books and pamphlets. St. George Tucker's Dissertation on Slavery: with a Proposal for the Gradual Abolition of It, in the State of Virginia (1796) and his Reflections on the Policy and Necessity of Encouraging the Commerce of the Citizens of the United States of America (1785) are significant essays by the William and Mary professor. Jefferson's Albemarle neighbor the Italian Philip Mazzei is represented by two essays, one in French and one in Italian (1788 and 1803); English James Currie, physician, and Scottish Patrick Colquhoun, economist, both of whom lived in Virginia for some years, by one treatise each (1793 and 1788 respectively). Included here are essays by prominent citizens such as Fulwar Skipwith (1806), Richard Henry Lee (1787), Arthur Lee (1774), Robert Carter Nicholas (1774), Carter Braxton (1776), William Tatham (1791), John Taylor (1794), Edmund Randolph (1795, 1796), John Page (1796), W.C. Nicholas (1799?), Benjamin Watkins Leigh (two in 1811), Richard Evers Lee (1800), John Daly Burk (1803), Philip Grymes (1803), William Branch Giles (1808), and John Thomson (1804). Other native Virginians whose reputations were acquired outside the state, men such as William Henry Harrison (1807) and Henry Clay (1813), are also represented. There are two essays by Jefferson's eccentric neighbor the orator and schoolmaster James Ogilvie (1798, 1802), several pseudonymous essayists under names like Virginius and Oliver Fairplay who wrote for or against Jefferson, and several contributions to the Logan controversy. There are Virginia essays on systems of banking (1811), militia (1813), the Navy (1808), and the Burr Trial (1807). Here may be found the notorious James Thomson Callender's The Prospect before Us (1800). 17 Here is the only known copy of a 1769 edition of John Dickinson and Arthur Lee's The Farmer's and Monitor's Letters, to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies . Altogether these items form an amusing and entertaining as well as significant representation of early American politics. Naturally it was difficult if not usually impossible to replace these so frequently topical books and pamphlets after 1814. But Jefferson did secure a new copy of Hay's essay on the liberty of the press and a new 1818 edition of The Federalist as well as an additional older one. Old friends sent him their current political writings, and this section of the 1829 catalogue lists a now valuable collection of essays and books by people such as John Taylor of Caroline, who sent Construction Construed, and Constitutions Vindicated (1820) and New Views of the Constitution of the United States (1823); Francis Gilmer, who contributed his Vindication of the Laws . . . against Usury from the Objections of Jeremy Bentham and the Edinburgh Reviewers (1820), and David B. Warden, whose book On the Origin, Nature, Progress and Influence of Consular Establishments (1813) must have interested the old statesman at Monticello a great deal. And he received in this period printed copies of series of State Papers covering the 1793-1820 period. Almost all these seem to have been gifts. There is little or no evidence of conscious collecting of this kind of Virginiana during these last dozen years. The second principal subdivision of the classification Philosophy was Mathematical, and under Mathematical were included the various types of Mathematics, Physico-Mathematics, Astronomy, and Geography. Under Pure Mathematics and Astronomy one finds no Virginiana in the collection completed in 1814, and under Physico-Mathematics only Jefferson's own Notes on the Establishment of a Money Unit, and of Coinage for the United States [ c. 1785] and Report of the Secretary of State, on the Subject of Establishing a Uniformity in the Weights, Measures and Coins of the United States (1790). It is not until we come to Geography that there is Virginiana again. Here are a group of sixteenth and seventeenth-century books that might perhaps have been included with History earlier. A magnificent set of DeBry's The Great or American Voyages, Parts I to XI, in Latin (1590-1619); Richard Hakluyt's Principal Navigations (1589, the Richard Bland library copy); Edward Williams' Virginia: More especially the South part thereof, Richly and truly valued (1650); Robert Johnson's Nova Britannia (1609); and William Bullock's Virginia Impartially Examined (1649) are in themselves realizations of a book collector's dream. Here under Geography he also includes a rare tract by his friend William Tatham, Address to the Shareholders and Others Interested in the Canals of Virginia (1794), and the two-volume 1814 edition of Lewis and Clark's History of the Expedition under the Command of Captains Lewis and Clark . Also he lists here a first edition of his Notes on the State of Virginia (Paris, 1785), Appendix to the Notes on Virginia (1800; there was another copy earlier in the Catalogue ), and Message from the President of the United States, Transmitting a Roll of the Persons Having Office or Employment under the United States (1802). Jefferson had a good collection under the third and final major classification, Fine Arts, but it is hardly strange that very little of it is Virginian in subject or author. What little there is hardly indicative of his aesthetic tastes, for most of the items were presentation copies from authors. Such is Thomas Northmore's Washington, or Liberty Restored: a Poem in Ten Books (1809). Dedicated to him was Judith Lomax's The Notes of an American Lyre (1813). Jefferson subscribed for twelve copies of this latter work, presumably out of friendship for the author's father Thomas Lomax. More interesting among the volumes of verse is St. George Tucker's (identified as author by Jefferson himself) The Probationary Odes of Jonathan Pindar, Esq. (1796). After 1814 he received one more volume of native poetry, Mrs. Alfred W. Elwes'[?] Potomac Muse (1825). Under Logic in the Fine Arts division were Rhetoric and Oratory. Here one finds Jean François Coste's oration given at Williamsburg in 1782 in Latin (1783) and James Lyons' medical dissertation, in Latin, on the cholera (1785). Here also are a volume of eulogiums on Washington (probably 1802), an oration (1808) by Ferdinando Fairfax, Thomas E. Birch's anthology (containing an ode to Jefferson), The Virginian Orator: being a Variety of Original and Selected Poems, Orations and Dramatic Scenes; to improve the American Youth in the Ornamental and Useful Art of Eloquence and Gesture (1808), a copy of William Wirt's [and others'] volume of essays, The Rainbow, First Series (1804), and (all that was ever published of) James Lyon's National Magazine: or, A Political, Historical, Biographical, and Literary Repository, for June 1, 1799 (1799). Only one such item of Fine Arts-Virginiana does the 1814-1826 library contain, a copy of George Tucker's Essays on Various Subjects of Taste, Morals, and National Policy (1822), probably presented by the author in 1825 when he came to Charlottesville as first chairman of the faculty of the University of Virginia. B. Virginia Imprints The bibliographer may be even more interested in Jefferson's Virginia imprints than in his Virginia subjects and authors. These imprints can be determined accurately only for his greatest library, that already catalogued by Miss Sowerby. But these alone reveal a great deal about printers and publishers in early Virginia. The many Richmond, Williamsburg, and Petersburg impressions indicate more or less sustained publishing activity in those places, and the smaller numbers for Abingdon, Alexandria, Charlottesville, Fincastle, Fredericksburg, Martinsburg (now West Virginia), Norfolk, Shepherd's-Town (now West Virginia), and Staunton are significant in various ways. 18 Joshua Peel's Truth and Reason [1805], though written by a resident of Bedford County, was taken over to a printer named David Amen, of Fincastle, in neighboring Botetourt, for publication. Why Richard Watson, Bishop of Landaff's, Christian Panoply , a series of letters addressed to Thomas Paine, was published by P. Rootes &amp; C. Blagrove of Shepherd's-Town for the Presbyterian Synod of Virginia in 1797 might not be too hard to guess or even to determine exactly. William Thomson, an Abingdon lawyer, got the Holston Intelligencer in his place of residence to print his Compendious View of the Trial of Aaron Burr . . . Together with Biographical Sketches of Several Eminent Characters (1807), a volume Jefferson professed to have read with great satisfaction. Martinsburg is represented by a Protestant Episcopal sermon, published by John Alberts. James Lyon, and later John McArthur, published the Political Mirror under a Staunton imprint. John Dunlap and James Hayes in Charlottesville published two official volumes of state Acts and Journals for 1781. Fredericksburg appears on the dateline of two newspapers, The Genius of Liberty, G. Carter and others 1798-1800, and The Virginia Herald and Fredericksburg &amp; Falmouth Advertiser , Timothy Green 1795-1796. In Norfolk, besides newspapers like The American Gazette , William Davis 1795-1796, there had been printed William Tatham's View of the Proposed Grand Junction Canal (1808), presumably by the author; Daniel Bedinger's Letter . . . to Robert Smith (1808), A. C. Gordon &amp; Co.; and Arrowsmith and Lewis' New and Elegant Atlas (1804), Bonsal, Conrad, and Co. (this last also published at a number of other places). Sir Robert Wilson's History of the British Expedition to Egypt (1803) and Benjamin Rush's An Inquiry into the various Sources of the usual Forms of Summer &amp; Autumnal Fever in the United States . . . . (1805) likewise have Norfolk imprints along with those of other cities. Alexandria, though a part of the District of Columbia rather than of Virginia during much of this period, may also be considered. This city's printing activity is evident in a number of pamphlets such as James Ogilvie's Cursory Reflexions on Government, Philosophy and Education (1802), J. &amp; J. De Westcott; James Workman's Political Essays, Relative to the War of the French Revolution (1801), Cottom and Stewart; Richard Dinmore's A Long Talk, Delivered before the Tammany Society of Alexandria (1804), the Expositor Office; August B. Woodward's Consideration on the Government of the Territory of Columbia (1802), S. Snowden &amp; Co., and G. W. P. Custis' Address to the People of the United States (1808), also Snowden. Jefferson's thirty-five Williamsburg imprints, in several instances multi-volumed with different printers within the series, range in time from 1733 to 1781 and include a number of the official records of the colony and state. The first printer, William Parks, is represented in eleven items such as Journals of the House of Burgesses (1740-1748), A Collection of All the Acts of Assembly, Now in Force (1733, the first collection of Virginia laws published in Virginia), Biscoe's The Merchant's Magazine (1743), Stith's History (1747), Treaty Held with the Indians of the Six Nations at Lancaster (1744), Mercer's Abridgement (1737), Webb's Justice of the Peace (1736), The Virginia Gazette (1741-1750), and interesting English books on fencing and the small-sword (1734), a sermon on death (1744), and a treatise on the Lord's Supper (1740). William Hunter's press is represented in four imprints, including some of the official papers and The Virginia Gazette , 1751-1778. John Dixon and Alexander Purdie appear in combination twice, Dixon and Thomas Nicolson together four times, Purdie alone about ten times. William Rind's name on his Virginia Gazette and official papers appears alone at least three times, with Purdie and Dixon once. Rind also printed the rare edition of The Farmer's and Monitor's Letters (1769, referred to above). His widow, Clementina Rind, published Jefferson's Summary View in 1774; and John Pinkney, "for Clementina Rind's Children," printed Francis Hopkinson's A Pretty Story the same year. Petersburg is represented by eight imprints, three of which, the Sir Thomas Wilson, Benjamin Rush, and Arrowsmith and Lewis (map) items referred to above, are also Norfolk imprints. But John Daly Burk, a resident of the little city, published there in 1804 and 1805 the three volumes of his History of Virginia , printed for the author by Dickson &amp; Pescud, and in 1803 An Oration , T. Field. Here appeared Richard Mason's The Gentleman's Pocket Companion (1811), John Jackson; [James Monroe's] Some Observations on the Constitution (1788), Hunter and Prentis; and Debates and Other Proceedings of the Convention of Virginia [1788, 1789], Hunter and Prentis, and Prentis. Richmond is represented in more than sixty items, ranging in time from 1780/1, when the official printers Dixon and Nicolson moved to the new capital from Williamsburg, to items published in 1813. Again the largest single group is the official state publications, more than two dozen, works such as Acts Passed. . ., A Collection of Such Acts. . ., Debates and Journals of the Senate and House of Delegates, and Reports of the Supreme Court of Appeals. The official printers include Nicolson alone, Dixon and Nicolson, Dixon and Holt, Nicolson and Prentis, J. Dunlap and James Hayes, Augustine Davis, Pleasants and Pace, Pleasants alone, Meriwether Jones, and various combinations of these men. The same firms also printed semi-official and private books and newspapers. Pleasants published several newspapers, including The Virginia Gazette (1795), The Virginia Argus (1797) and its successors (Jefferson's copies 1797-1803, 1804-1808, 1809-1813, etc.), and The Richmond and Manchester Advertiser (1795-1796). He also printed the volumes of Hening's Statutes at Large (1809, 1810, 1812) and belletristic items such as Birch's The Virginian Orator (1808) and Lomax's The Notes of an American Lyre (1813). Thomas Ritchie printed the famous Richmond Enquirer and items like Sidney Smith's Letters on the Subject of the Catholics (1809), "from the Office of the Enquirer;" and his firm of Ritchie and Worsley published Wirt's Rainbow essays (1804). Thomas Nicolson printed a number of things other than the official records, agricultural pamphlets such as Ambler's Treatise on the Culture of Lucerne (1800?) and John Randolph's Treatise on Gardening (1793), and semi-official books like Hening's The New Virginia Justice (1795). Seaton Grantland's imprint appears on Sketches of the History of France . . . By an American (1806) and Barnaby Nixon's A Serious Address to the Rulers of America in General, and the State of Virginia in Particular . . . . (1806). John Dixon supplemented his official printing with two newspapers, The Virginia Gazette and Richmond Chronicle (1795) and Richmond Chronicle (1795-1796), apparently neither very successful. Jones and Dixon as a firm published another James Ogilvie essay, A Speech . . . in Essex County (1798) and Jones alone Richard Evers Lee's Letters (1800) and James Monroe's Governor's Letter (1802, perhaps semi-official). Dixon and Holt printed St. George Tucker's Reflections on commerce (1795). Augustine Davis supplemented his official publishing with such works as Decius' Letters on the Opposition to the New Constitution in Virginia (1789). The National Magazine (1799-1800) was printed "by and for the Editor," James Lyon, who also lived and worked elsewhere. Other Richmond imprints bear the names of printer-publishers Manson and John O'Lynch. Jefferson's library alone would indicate that for the little more than a quarter of a century between the Revolution and the War of 1812 the new little village-town-capital of Richmond was a fairly busy publishing center. C. Rare Books and Pamphlets The fact that only a fraction of the library which went to Congress in 1814 survives makes it impossible to assess at all precisely the rare-book value of Jefferson's greatest library. But the items which do remain, added to others which may be identified, indicate that the Americana or Virginiana collector today would place a high valuation upon it. First perhaps one should take a glance at association and dedication copies. There were hundreds of presentation copies in the library without Virginia or even American relationship. Miss Sowerby's Index lists all of the presentation copies together (V, 385-391). Among those of Virginia origin in some sense are Mason L. Weems' Washington (1808) and The True Patriot (1802), medical essays by Edmund Jennings, William Stokes, William Tazewell, and the two Ewells (see below), Thomas Northmore's Washington (1809), Colvin's Historical Letters (1812) and his Letter to the Honorable John Randolph (n.d.), and Birch's The Virginian Orator . Miss Sowerby also lists all the dedication copies (V, 329). Dedicated to Jefferson, though of course his copy does not always survive, are, among others, Burk's History of Virginia , James Ewell's Medical Companion (1807), Thomas Ewell's Plain Discourses (1806), Lomax's Notes of an American Lyre , Joshua Peel's Truth and Reason , and Stokes' De Asphyxia (1793). The list of books in which Jefferson is mentioned (Sowerby, V, 329-331) runs into the hundreds. Already pointed out in connection with their listing under author, subject, or imprint above were a number of interesting association copies. Other association copies, with manuscript additions of value, are Sir John Randolph's common-place book bound with A Brief Method of Law (1680), Jefferson's own Summary View (1774) with several notes by the author, and the two volumes of the 1788 Federalist with Madison's contributions noted in Jefferson's handwriting. This last book is of interest also as the copy belonging to Mrs. Alexander Hamilton received by Jefferson through his good friend her sister Mrs. Angelica Church. Other items now or once present are scarce editions or apparently unique copies (as far as present location is concerned). No copy is known to exist of the 1793 edition of John Randolph's Treatise on Gardening which Jefferson once owned, and the only copy Miss Sowerby was able to locate of the Dickinson-Lee The Farmer's and Monitor's Letters is Jefferson's. Rare Virginia pamphlets, many of them unincluded in most Virginia bibliographies, are Peel's Truth and Reason (1805) and Sherlock's A Practical Discourse Concerning Death (1744). Hakluyt's Principal Navigations (1589), Johnson's Nova Britannia (1609), and Bullock's Virginia Impartially Examined are first editions of considerable value. Williams' Virginia (1650) and DeBry's Voyages (1590-1619), the latter not quite complete, are also rare. The first editions Jefferson owned of the histories of Virginia by Smith (1632, first issue), Keith (1738), Stith (1747), and Burk (1804, 1805) bring high prices today. And the first editions of Marshall's Washington (1804, 1805, 1807), Jefferson's own Notes on the State of Virginia (Paris, 1785), and Lewis and Clark's History of the Expedition . . . . (1814) are prized items. There are scores of others. As noted above, Jefferson was well aware that his most valuable printed items were his copies of the Virginia laws and legislative journals. He knew that he had the most nearly complete collection of them in existence. They were equally useful to lawyer, historian, and statesman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. Newspapers Though the irresponsible attacks made on him, especially during the election campaigns of 1800 and 1804, soured Jefferson as to the usefulness or veracity of newspapers, he did preserve a considerable number of them in bound files. They are included in the 1815 Catalogue under American History (items 535-602), each item representing one or more volumes. Among them were journals published in fifteen American cities outside Virginia and in one foreign capital. But by far the largest number, approximately eighteen items, 19 are from Virginia. Originally he owned many more. In a letter to John D. Burk of June 1, 1803, he mentions his collection of newspapers which Burk had asked to borrow. They dated from 1741. downwards. the vols. preceding 1752. shall be sent with the other [ sic ] to Richmond to be used by you either there or at Petersburg according to your convenience. these also [as well as printed laws] being the only collection probably in existence, I purchased &amp; cherish it with a view to public utility. it is answering one of it's principal objects when I put it into your hands . . . (Sowerby, I, 213). It is well that Burk used them profitably, for Jefferson never recovered his newspapers, and they have disappeared from view. A later letter (October 29, 1810) from Thomas to his kinsman George Jefferson mentions that the collection included " 3 volumes of Virginia Gazette from 1741 to 1760." The writer adds the interesting information that he purchased these volumes from "Parson Wiley's executors before the revolution, and paid their original cost for them which I think was £30. for the whole collection down to his death" (Sowerby, I, 213). The Library of Congress does not possess a single bound volume of newspapers from the 1815 library, at least in recognizable form. But the manuscript and printed catalogues indicate that he had twelve volumes folio and one volume quarto of "Virginia gazettes." These included in whole or part Parks' Virginia Gazette , 1741-1750; Hunter et al, Virginia Gazette , 1751-1778; Rind's Virginia Gazette , 1766-1776; Purdie et al, Virginia Gazette , 1775-1780; all Williamsburg; and Dixon and Nicolson's Virginia Gazette , 1779-1781, Williamsburg and Richmond. Another manuscript catalogue entry, "Gazettes. 1795-7, d° 1797" [or in the 1815 printed Catalogue : "Miscellaneous Gazettes, 1795-1800, 4 vols."] seems hopelessly obscure until one looks with Miss Sowerby at the 1831 Library of Congress catalogue, which breaks this down and lists in two places a number of out-of-state items but also the Political Mirror , 1800-1802, Staunton; the Genius of Liberty , 1798-1800, Fredericksburg; The Enquirer , 1809-1814, the Virginia Argus , 1797, the Virginia Argus and Virginia Enquirer , 1804-1808, 5 vols., the Virginia Argus and Virginia Examiner , 1797-1803, 1809-1813, 7 vols., the Virginia Gazette , June 1795, the Virginia Gazette and Richmond Chronicle , 1795, the Richmond Chronicle , 1795-1796, The Richmond and Manchester Advertiser , 1795-1796, all Richmond; the American Gazette , 1795-1796, Norfolk; and the Virginia Herald and Fredericksburg and Falmouth Advertiser , 1795-1796, Fredericksburg, 20 Not long before he died Jefferson named one of these Virginia journals as his favorite in a letter to his old friend William Short but at the age of 80. I seek quiet and abjure contention. I read but a single newspaper, Ritchie's Enquirer, the best that is published or ever has been published in America. you should read it also to keep yourself au fait of your own state; for we still claim you as belonging to us (September 8, 1823, Sowerby, I, 279). Although Jefferson may have overestimated the uniqueness of his collection of Virginia newspapers, much would be given today for his eighteenth and early nineteenth-century files. The Cappon and Duff microfilmed edition of the Virginia Gazette of Williamsburg, for example, might be far more complete than it is. In most cases today files of the other newspapers are incomplete or fragmentary. 21 Jefferson never made any claim for inclusiveness or completeness for his own collection, but quite obviously it was at least on a par with his printed laws in value as history.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. Manuscripts Jefferson's collection of manuscript materials relating to the history of the colony and state grew as steadily and intelligently as his printed collections. From his young manhood he was on the alert for unpublished materials. So well was he known by 1816 as an authority on Virginia manuscripts that it was to him that the American Philosophical Society appealed for information when it wanted to identify the author of an unpublished "History of the Dividing Line between Virginia and North Carolina" it had recently discovered among its papers. And Jefferson did not fail the Society. He reported promptly that it was probably "Dr. Byrd's" and suggested members of the Westover family who should be consulted. In doing so he gave evidence that he knew of a considerable number of Virginia private papers still at large. 22 Jefferson's own Virginia manuscripts came to him in a variety of ways, but all these ways are indicative of his awareness of the need of preserving records of the state's history. They consist of twenty-one items, some comprised of several bound volumes each, seventeen or eighteen of which went to the Library of Congress in 1815 and the remainder in 1829. Of the total number, only three are not legal or legislative or judicial or miscellaneous records of the colony. That he considered these official relics of time worth considerable care is indicated in a letter to his old law teacher, George Wythe, who wished to borrow the manuscript as well as the printed laws in Jefferson's library. Jefferson declined to send the manuscripts on the excuse that they were not pertinent to the study Wythe was making and that they were too fragile anyway. Some, said Jefferson, fall to powder at the touch: These I preserve by wrapping and sewing them in oil cloth, so that neither air nor moisture can have access to them. Very early in my researches into the laws of Virginia, I observed that many of them were already lost, and many more at the point of being lost, as existing only in single copies in the hands of careful or curious individuals, on whose death they would probably be used for waste paper. I set myself therefore to work, to collect all which were then existing, in order that when the day should come when the public should advert to the magnitude of their loss in these precious monuments of their property, and our history, a part of their regret might be spared by information that a portion had been saved from the wreck, which is worthy of their attention and preservation. In searching after these remains, I spared neither time, trouble, nor expense; and am of opinion that scarcely a law escaped me, which was in being as late as the year 1790 in the middle or southern parts of the State. In the northern parts, perhaps something might be found. . . . But recurring to what we actually possess, the question is, what means will be most effectual for preserving these remains from future loss? (January 16, 1796, L&amp;B , IX, 319-320). His answer is that everything should be printed and distributed. "How many of the precious works of antiquity were lost while they were preserved only in manuscript!" He demonstrated his belief in publication in what he did with the most valuable of the non-official manuscripts which came into his hands. In 1803 Rufus King sent for his perusal an account of Bacon's Rebellion which he had picked up abroad and which differed from the published accounts. 23 In 1804 Jefferson wrote a letter to King returning the manuscript and saying that he had taken the liberty of making a copy of it. The copy was being placed in the hands of a person who was writing a history of Virginia. He promised King that he would try to trace the author, who in 1705 had signed only the initials "T. M.", "among the antient MSS. I possess at Monticello." The copy seems to have gone to George Wythe, who turned it over to the editor of the Richmond Enquirer for publication. It was printed in that paper on September 1, 5, 8, 1804. The Enquirer states that the printed account is an exact copy of the original sent by the President of the United States for the express purpose of publication. The copy now in the Jefferson papers in the Library of Congress seems to be that returned by Jefferson to King. It is clearly of c. 1705, but if it is the original it has lost its covers and other marks of identification. It appears in the 1815 printed Catalogue but not in Jefferson's rough-copy manuscript catalogue. How and why it stayed in or came back to the Jefferson library is puzzling. This work, T[homas] M[athew]'s "The Beginning Progress and Conclusion of Bacon's Rebellion in Virginia in the years 1675 &amp; 1676," is of course one of the major documents of this era in colonial history. The other non-official papers are not nearly so valuable. One, Sir John Randolph's manuscript commonplace-[legal]book bound with A Brief Method of the Law (1680) and written partly by Benjamin Harrison and partly by Randolph, has been noted above. Another commonplace-book of legal materials precedes it (Sowerby, II, 225). The other non-official manuscript is bound with the non-Virginia manuscript of Paul Alliot's Reflections historiques et politiques sur la Louysiane ( c. 1803) and is called "Extracts from a letter written by a Gentleman who had explored Kentucky to his Friend in the lower part of Virginia relative to that country—Bedford in Virginia." Covering only two leaves, it was labelled laconically by Jefferson "Western country." Of the official or semi-official items, the six containing records from 1606 to the dissolution of the Virginia Company are described in detail in Susan Myra Kingsbury, Records of the Virginia Company of London (4 vols., Washington, D.C., 1906, 1933, 1935; I, 41-52). She points out that they came to the Library of Congress in two different groups, in 1815 (with the library) and in 1829 (when they were bought at the auction). Those which came in 1815 are themselves in four groups: 1) "Laws and Orders concluded on by the General Assembly March the 5th. 1623"; 24 2) "Journal of the Council and Assembly 1616- 1634"; 25 3) "Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692"; 4) "Miscellaneous Papers, 1606-1683, Instructions . . . [etc.]." 26 The 1829 acquisitions were: 1) the "Records of the Virginia Company" in two volumes folio, and 2) the "Old Records of Virginia," in four volumes folio (1829 catalogue item 122). All of those acquired in 1829 are unique copies or contemporary transcripts of incalculable value. The "Miscellaneous Papers, 1606-1683" is a seventeenth-century transcript. The "Laws" of 1623 and the "Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1683" are transcripts of the earlier eighteenth century attested by R. Hickman, Clerk of the General Court in 1722. Jefferson himself gives the best account of the provenance of the 1829 volumes in a letter to Hugh P. Taylor, October 4, 1823, in which he states that the first two volumes are accounted for in the preface to Stith's History of Virginia , that they are the records of the Company copied under the eye of the Earl of Southampton, bought at the sale of the Earl's library by William Byrd, who lent them to Richard Bland, in whose library they reposed when Jefferson bought it. 27 The other four volumes, Jefferson goes on to say, he supposes were original office records borrowed by Sir John Randolph for a projected history of Virginia and never returned. They remained in the library Jefferson bought from Peyton Randolph's executors. Though Kingsbury and Sowerby do not agree with this in certain details, they do in general. Of the items from the 1815 Catalogue listed in Kingsbury, the three volumes containing transcripts of the Virginia records are unique. The "Laws and Orders" of 1623 bears an endorsement in Jefferson's hand to the effect that it was found among the manuscript papers of Sir John Randolph and given by his son Peyton to Jefferson. It is an early eighteenth-century transcript attested by Hickman. The "Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692" is a seventeenth-century copy bought from the Bland library. The "Miscellaneous Papers" is another eighteenth-century copy attested by Hickman and once belonging to Bland (Sowerby, II, 244). As noted above, the "Journal of the Council and Assembly, 1616-1634" as listed by Kingsbury (I, 42n) is probably the rediscovered "Commissions and Proclamations, 1616-1634." 28 If so, it came from the library of Peyton Randolph. Most of the other official manuscript gatherings, ignored by Kingsbury because they did not affect the story of the Virginia Company of London, came to Jefferson, as those already discussed did, from various other libraries. A manuscript copy of John Mercer's "Abridgement of the Public Acts" and "An Abridgement of the Common Law" have no known provenance beyond Jefferson's library. The first is an eighteenth-century, the second a seventeenth-century manuscript. Sir John Randolph's "Opinions of Learned Counsel" (the second half in his autograph) is in seventeenth and eighteenth-century hands. It bears Sir John's and Peyton Randolph's names on the flyleaf and certainly came from the two Randolphs' library (Sowerby, II, 224). The "Journal of Council and Assembly, 1642-1662," the "Edmund Randolph copy," was on loan from Jefferson to Edmund for many years, lost, recovered, and finally sent by Hening to the Library of Congress (Sowerby, II, 240). It also had once belonged to Sir John and Peyton Randolph. "Legislative Records, 1652-1660," in Jefferson's own autograph, was copied from the Mercer manuscript used by Hening (Sowerby, II, 242). The "Laws, 1662-1702" Jefferson stated he found ready to be used for waste paper in Lorton's tavern in Charles City county. The Clerk of the Court, Debnam, gave it and "Laws. 1705" to Jefferson without hesitation (Sowerby, II, 242-243). "Laws. 1662-1697" came from the Randolphs' library (Sowerby, II, 242). The "Acts of Assembly. 1705-1711" was given to Jefferson by his old friend John Page. It had belonged to the latter's grandfather, Matthew Page, who had in 1705 been one of the commissioners for a revisal of the laws. An edition of Purvis' A Complete Collection of All the Laws ( c. 1684) contains a manuscript continuation of some interest. Jefferson says the volume was given to his father-in-law, Mr. Wayles, by the late Colonel William Byrd [III] (Sowerby, II, 245). "The Virginia Court Book, 1622-1629" has been taken apart and rebound so that its provenance is difficult to determine (Sowerby, II, 352). In the 1828 sales list (no. 565) appears one more manuscript, a copy of the "Revised Code, 1779." That Jefferson acquired any of the manuscripts listed in 1829 after 1814 is improbable. Though it seems unlikely that he consciously held back anything when he sent his library to Washington (he complained in 1815 to Hening that he had never intended selling his Virginia law items to Congress but had been obliged under the terms to do so), we do know that he did not include a very few things and that some things "missing" or on loan but represented in the Catalogue never got to Washington. Whatever the cause, the Library of Congress did add in 1829 these companion volumes to its collection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. The "Usefulness" of Jefferson's Collection From the quotations given above it is clear that Jefferson had posterity more in mind when he acquired Virginiana than he did when gathering his more general materials. These manuscripts, newspapers, pamphlets, and books would probably not, he felt, be preserved at all, and certainly not together so that they might be used, unless he undertook the task. He was almost surely right. There had been in past generations men like William Byrd II and Sir John Randolph who might be numbered among the careful or the curious, but even they seem to have been haphazard collectors as far as matter pertaining to the Old Dominion was concerned. Jefferson had no illusions about the immortality of libraries in private hands. He knew too much of the fine old collections of his Virginia predecessors for that. And he sent documents of national significance, when they came to him, as did certain Lewis and Clark materials, to the American Philosophical Society library as a way of ensuring their survival. Perhaps he took some satisfaction in the anticipation that his things going to the Library of Congress would be carefully preserved. But the Virginia manuscript and printed laws and other records, as he says in his correspondence several times, he never intended to go to Washington. Though in 1814 the University of Virginia was not so near physical realization as in 1823-24, it is probable that even in 1814 he had it in mind as a repository for his Virginia materials. Certainly it was the destination he planned for the volumes of the proceedings of the Virginia Company of London and the other miscellaneous early records, for he informed Hugh Taylor in 1823 that he "would deposit them in the library of the University" (October 4, L&amp;B , XV, 472). His testamentary gift of the whole of his last library to the University was never realized because of the financial conditions of his estate when he died. It had to be sold at auction. Even during his lifetime Jefferson put his Virginiana to good use. Young neighbors or relatives like Francis Gilmer and Peter and Dabney Carr came to browse or study in his library. One of the tasks he urged upon them was the acquisition of an extensive knowledge of their own "country." Their letters give evidence that they acquired something. Dabney Carr became a judge and authority on Virginia law. Gilmer not only was elected first professor of law in the infant University of Virginia but was behind the first American printing of one of the books he probably first saw in Jefferson's library, Captain John Smith's Historie . 29 Gilmer's letters harp on the theme that Virginia must fulfill the promise of her past. What remains one of the most significant items of pure Virginiana, Jefferson's own Notes on the State of Virginia , was composed in part while he was surrounded by his beloved books at Monticello. 30 The famous bibliography of Virginia history at the end of Query XXIII could hardly have been compiled without his own volumes. Still essential for any student of Virginia is John Daly Burk's three-volume History of Virginia (1804, 1805). As already noted, Jefferson lent Burk while the composition of the work was going on an invaluable file of Virginia newspapers which the owner never recovered but which the author used most effectively. Burk, in dedicating the comprehensive study to the man who had supplied so much of its primary material, said that "The History of Virginia, by a sort of national right, claims you as its guardian and patron." 31 Without the manuscript and printed laws described above William Waller Hening could not have compiled his monumental The Statutes at Large; being a Collection of all the Laws of Virginia, from the First Session of the Legislature, in the year 1619 (1809, 1810, 1812). In the preface Hening traces the history of Jefferson's connection with the publication, which began in 1795 when George Wythe approached his former student as to the use of his materials for such a work. After much correspondence Jefferson in June 1808 sent Hening eight units of "Manuscripts of the laws," which the owner systematically listed. 32 These items included the Peyton Randolph, the Bland, the John Page, and Charles City — derived manuscripts described above. Later Jefferson lent him other laws, manuscript and printed, which Hening collated with other surviving copies when possible but often had to use as his only source. In the twentieth century most of Jefferson's Virginia manuscripts , especially, have been reproduced with scholarly introductions or used as bases for critical and historical studies of the periods they represent. H. R. McIlwaine printed "The Virginia Court Book, 1622-1629" (Sowerby, II, 352-353) in his edition of Minutes of the Council and General Court of Virginia, 1616-1676 (Richmond, 1924). Susan Myra Kingsbury, in the four volumes of The Virginia Company of London (Washington, D.C., 1906, 1933, 1935) describes the Jefferson manuscripts and reproduces all the old records pertaining to the years she covers (1606-1624) in a work used by students of the period everywhere in the English-speaking world. Historians like Charles M. Andrews and Wesley F. Craven, among others, have studied Jefferson's Virginiana, in the original and/or in later printed form, in preparing their own distinguished interpretations of colonial history. The scholars who have concentrated especially on Virginia history (to whom manuscripts such as Mathew's "Bacon's Rebellion" are of particular interest) and have employed Jefferson's materials, from Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker to the most modest of genealogists or local historians, run at least into the scores. Thomas Jefferson, one recalls, measured almost everything by the degree of its usefulness to mankind. His definition of usefulness was an inclusive one, embracing the production of intellectual and aesthetic pleasure as well as of material comfort. If he could come back and observe the ways in which his collections of materials relating to Virginia have been put to use, there is every evidence that he would be well satisfied.</field>

Smith, September 21, 1814, L&amp;B , XIV, 191. 17 This is one of the two books in Jefferson's library called objectionable in the debate in Congress as to whether to buy his collection. The book has a Richmond imprint and may be called Virginiana whether Callender's brief "residence" within the state entitles him to be called Virginian or not. 18 One should keep in mind that all of these once in Jefferson's library do not survive today, though many of them do. In the instances when Miss Sowerby had only the title as printed in the Catalogue , she exercised considerable effort and ingenuity in determining other bibliographical data. 19 This is following Miss Sowerby's listing, which is necessarily indecisive, since no known volume of Jefferson's newspapers survives and the detailed listing, as pointed out below, has to be guessed at from a later Library of Congress listing. One may add that the designation of eighteen out of sixty-eight items as Virginiana seems reasonably accurate by this later (1831) catalogue. 20 Publishers of most of these papers are named in the discussion of imprints just above. For others, see Sowerby, I, 267-285. 21 See C. S.

      <field name="heading_text">The Amazing Career of Andrew Barclay, Scottish Bookbinder, of Boston by Hannah D. French</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Andrew Barclay was phenomenal among American bookbinders of the eighteenth century—a craftsman who signed his work. The bookbinders in Colonial America were an obscure lot. Their work was utilitarian and primitive as might be expected. More often than not they combined the business of binding with that of bookselling, and sometimes with publishing. No native binder is known to have signed his work. The two exceptions to this rule of anonymity, in this country, were both emigrant binders: Andrew Barclay from Scotland, 1 working in Boston, and Samuel Taylor from Berwick-upon-Tweed, at the Scottish border line of England, working in Philadelphia. Both have been known for some time by the elaborate, engraved trade cards or labels with which they marked their work. Barclay's trade label is more elaborate and somewhat more widely known than Taylor's. It has been found in place within the covers of five volumes whereas Taylor's is presently known in three. Barclay's label exists in two different versions, both reproduced in Bookbinding in America . 2 A third simple, typographic label, discovered in the course of research for that work is less interesting, and has never been reproduced. The larger of the two pictorial labels which Barclay used was presumably designed for use within folio volumes and carries more detail than the smaller. Within a Chippendale cartouche bearing the initials A. B. in a shield at the top center, and his address, "Three Kings in Cornhill, Boston," at the base, is a rectangular engraving within a ruled frame. In the upper portion is an engraving of a bookbinder in the costume of the 1760's at work at the plough and press, surrounded by bound volumes, with folios numbered 1—4 and 5—8 on either side at the front. Below is the legend, "Books Bound and Sold, Gilt or plain, by Andrew Barclay, Next Door but one to the sign of the Three Kings." Three Kings is squeezed into the lower right-hand corner as though it were the catchword for the address in the cartouche directly beneath. This larger label exists apart from the books it once adorned in copies in the American Antiquarian Society and in the New York Public Library. Not long ago it was found inside the front cover of the John Carter Brown copy of Tans'ur's The Royal Melody Completed , together with the smaller Barclay label, unseparated from it. The two labels cover the entire endpaper of this oblong music book and they were obviously printed from the same copper plate. Indubitably the prints were usually cut apart for use separately in folios and in smaller volumes, since the larger label is almost twice the size of the smaller. The label of Samuel Taylor, Book-Binder &amp; Stationer, the Corner of Market &amp; Water Street, Philadelphia, is also engraved within a Chippendale border and has its own charm though it is simpler. 3 Instead of being ornamented with the shop interior as Barclay's is, its sole decoration is the shop sign of a book in hand enclosed in the cartouche at the top. Several Taylor labels have come to light within the covers of a book. 4 A copy which has been removed from the book it once adorned is found in the same collection in the American Antiquarian Society that contains the Barclay label. Mr. Wroth described them, over twenty years ago, as "sufficiently rare to be looked at twice, or even, less elegantly, to be gaped at," and he added, "I have never come upon a volume with the label of Samuel Taylor in position." 5 These unique examples of bookbinders' labels give a glimpse of unexpected elegance which has not been found in such labels before or since. They appear to have been made in Boston and in Philadelphia about 1765 or 1766. Clearly they were suggested by the eighteenth-century trade cards which had been common in the mother country and were used extensively in the American colonies. 6 They were smaller, however, and were not printed on card stock. The printed bookbinders' tickets which superseded them early in the nineteenth century were prosaic identification by comparison, having none of the intrinsic charm of the pictorial engravings. Unfortunately, in spite of their distinction the labels were unsigned so that it is impossible to tell with certainty who engraved them. The engraver of Andrew Barclay's shop interior was tentatively identified as Thomas Johnston (1708-1767), engraver in Boston, when the copy belonging to the late Victor Hugo Paltsits was exhibited in the New York Public Library in 1928. 7 This identification was made largely on the basis of Johnston's having engraved the music for A New Version of the Psalms , by Brady and Tate, published in Boston in 1755. Stauffer dates the known Johnston plates between 1727 and 1763 and states that he "did his best work as a heraldic engraver. . . ." 8 An examination of the Johnston print of the fort at Crown Point shows considerable similarity in the descriptive lettering for this picture which had been advertised for sale in the Boston Gazette , June 7, 1762, and the Barclay label. It is entirely possible that Thomas Johnston did engrave the interior of Barclay's shop for his label, but, lacking the authority of a signature, other engravers of the period may be considered too. Two younger engravers worked not far away from Andrew Barclay's shop "at the North Side of the Three Kings" in Cornhill,—Nathaniel Hurd and Paul Revere. Nathaniel Hurd not only worked near at hand but he shared common political beliefs with Barclay, as we shall see later. Paul Revere had also engraved hymn tunes and was producing trade cards in the Chippendale style somewhat later than Thomas Johnston. 9 Barclay's shop was first advertised in 1765 so that his plate was probably not done before that date, and very likely a year or two later. His simple, typographic label which resembled the bookplates used in the Colonies some fifty years earlier may well have preceded the more elaborate engraving. It is impossible to tell from the one example which was turned up in the Massachusetts Historical Society, back in 1938. The binding on Mellen's Fifteen Discourses upon Doctrinal Connected Subjects , printed in Boston by Edes and Gill, in 1765, was simple and undistinguished. Inside the front cover this hitherto unknown label bore the familiar legend, "Bound by Andrew Barclay, Next Door but one to the Sign of the Three Kings in Cornhill," this time in type ornamented only by a narrow typographical border. It was a plain ticket for a plain binding, albeit one of good workmanship. Though it might have been used because of the simplicity of the binding it adorned it seems more likely to have been the only label Barclay then owned since his engraved label was used on plain bindings also. The search for the prototype and for the identity of the engravers of these labels which were in turn identifications might go on so long as to prevent the study of the binders they identify if no arbitrary stop were put. By now Andrew Barclay had emerged as an eighteenth-century binder of parts, perhaps the only one in Boston who could be studied in connection with work which was unmistakably his. He and his bindings have been pursued during the past fifteen years or more. Sometimes the search has been exhilarating and sometimes discouraging. There are still lacunae but they may never be filled. Meanwhile the story is amazing. Barclay is one of the many bookmen who combined binding with bookselling. Isaiah Thomas recollected him as primarily a binder: "1764. Andrew Barclay, 'at the Bible in Cornhill,' from Scotland, was bred to binding, and followed that business several years after he arrived in Boston. He sold a few books." 10 On the other hand, Evans refers to him as a bookseller only, and gives his earlier address, "second door north of Three Kings in Cornhill." 11 Evans lists seven imprints containing the name of Andrew Barclay, dated between 1765 and 1775. Barclay's name appears in the imprint of twelve known titles. 12 Six of the books printed for him were for children: Samuel Davies's Little Children Invited to Jesus Christ; Tom Thumb's Play-Book, To Teach Children Their Letters as Soon as They Can Speak; The New Book of Knowledge; The Friar and Boy, or, The Young Piper's Pleasant Pastime ; and the inevitable copies of The New England Primer Improved , and of Watts's Divine Songs Attempted in Easy Language for the Use of Children . The first three titles were printed by Zechariah Fowle, and the first two were doubtless set in type by Isaiah Thomas who was serving the last year of his apprenticeship with Fowle in 1765. Although Evans does not locate a copy of Tom Thumb , he provides the note, "Thomas says he printed the above for Barclay when an apprentice to Zechariah Fowle." 13 It is interesting to find that this young binder and bookseller from Scotland was publishing children's books contemporaneously with the Newberys in England, and in connection with Isaiah Thomas who was to issue children's books from his own presses much later in his career. Other titles published by Barclay were Ames's Astronomical Diary , printed for him by a fellow Scot, William McAlpine, in 1766 and again in 1768, and editions of Brady and Tate's New Version of the Psalms of David , published in 1769, 1771, and in 1773. The last edition was printed for Barclay by Nathaniel Mills and John Hicks, of which more later. In 1774, a fifteen-page pamphlet by Samuel Clarke, called, A Short Relation, Concerning a Dream Which the Author had on the Eighteenth Day of September in the Year One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Nine. With Some Remarks on the Late Comet , was printed. Very few copies of these publications have been located and even if they had been it is unlikely that they would appear in fine bindings as they were hardly fitting subjects for the binder's skill. Children's books, almanacs, and pamphlets like these would be bound, presumably, in unornamented sheepskin or in stitched blue paper covers. Only one of the lot, Brady and Tate's Psalm book, printed for Barclay by Mills and Hicks in 1773, exists in one copy, at least, which appears to have been bound by Barclay. The copy in the British Museum seems to have had a label inside the front cover which was removed at some time. Furthermore the marks it left give every indication that it was the right size for Barclay's smaller one. The volume is neatly bound in sheep over raised cords. Its only ornamentation is provided by double gold fillets bordering the covers. All edges are gilt, and there are embroidered headbands, refinements which might be expected from the emigrant Scot but are not found in the work of native Boston binders. Of the five bindings which still carry Barclay's trade card as positive identification of his work not one bears his name in the imprint. Two cover London imprints and the other three contain Boston and New-bury-port printings. Only two carry more decoration than the volume just described. Both of these are gold-tooled panel bindings for A New Version of the Psalms of David . One wants a title page and the other bears the imprint, "Boston: Printed by D. Kneeland, for J. Eliot, at the Tree of Liberty, 1766." The latter is in the New York Public Library, and it contains the smaller of Barclay's labels. The binding is rather worn as one should expect, for these eighteenth-century Psalm books were heavily used. The material appears to be black morocco. The double panel on the covers consists of the customary double gold fillet bordering the covers, with a narrow, ornamental gold roll forming an inner panel. At the outer corners of the inner panel are four rather large, three-branched fleurons. There is nothing to distinguish the covers from those of an English binding of the period. The spine, however, is typical of Scottish work. It contains six panels made by five raised cords bordered on either side by narrow broken gold fillets. Each panel is divided into four sections by a dotted gold fillet, in the traditional form of the St. Andrew's cross. In each of the panels is placed a small fleur-de-lis ornament, and at the outer ends of the cross in the extreme four corners of the panels there is a small, circular, gilt ornament. The second gold-tooled binding, now owned by Mr. Thomas Streeter, was described as item number 20 in that same Catalogue No. 376 of Goodspeed's Book Shop which bore the reproduction of the label on its cover. In addition to the copy of the Psalms, without any title page, it contains Watts's Collection of Hymns (1765), and an undated copy of Daniel Bayley's The Psalm-Singer's Assistant . It was catalogued as contemporary calf, gilt back, gilt panels on sides. This volume, too, shows signs of use and the gilt is rubbed out in spots. The spine is identical with the New York volume except that the circular ornament appears not only at the extremities of the St. Andrew's cross on the spine, but also at the point where the two gilt fillets cross, in the center. The inner cover panel is made with a different gold roll, a narrow chain, and it has smaller fleurons at the corners, this time small Scottish thistles surmounted by crowns. The small ticket appears also within a copy of Tillotson's Sermons , in the American Antiquarian Society, first noticed by Mr. Wroth. 14 The binding, however, hardly bears out the pretensions of the ticket. It is a rather crude binding in plain calf. The five raised bands of the spine are bordered by a double gold fillet, and the red morocco label in panel two is lettered in gold, with the final n of Tillotson left off for lack of room. Of similar interest, the simple, blind-tooled sheepskin binding on the John Carter Brown copy of Tans'ur, already described as having the two Barclay labels uncut within, was brought to the writer's attention by Mr. Wroth, a few years ago. Both the Tillotson and the Tans'ur have London imprints. The fifth volume to bear a Barclay label is the copy of Mellen's Fifteen Discourses which contains the simple printed label. This book is sewn on the usual five raised cords, the covering is of sprinkled calf adorned by a double gold fillet line around the covers, unmitred at the corners. The cords on the spine are likewise bordered with double gold fillets, and the second panel contains a red leather label, lettered in gilt. The leather inside the covers is untrimmed. There are plain lining papers, the board edges are blind tooled and all edges are sprinkled red. The six Barclay bindings that have thus far come to light signify that Andrew Barclay was an honest, conscientious worker, presumably "bred to binding" in Scotland, that he brought at least some of his tools from there, that he took an unusual pride in his work and was ambitious to make it widely known, as evidenced by the three different trade cards which he used. Fortunately Barclay was not dependent upon his own imprints for stock for his shop though Thomas gave that impression when he concluded his brief reminiscence with, "He sold a few books." Previous to the Revolution it was customary for booksellers to import the bulk of their books from Great Britain and Andrew Barclay was no exception to the rule. An undated broadside, A Catalogue of Books,/ Lately imported from Britain;/ And to be Sold by A. Barclay. / Second Door North of the three King's,/ Corn-hill Boston ./, lists in three columns more than 140 titles—English and Scottish,—in all subject fields. Among them are: Calvin's Institutions [sic]; Hocus, Pocus; Laugh and be Fat ; Ramsay's Poems ; Webster's Book-keeping ; and Tansurs's [sic] Royal Melody , perhaps the very copy which now reposes in the John Carter Brown Library, complete with the two Barclay labels. At the end of the broadside is a note, "All Sorts of Books bound, gilt or plain, in the neatest Manner by said Barclay. . . . Cash given for Sheepskins fit for Bookbinding, at the same Place. Gentlemen in Town and Country, who please to favour him with their Custom, may depend upon being served with Fidelity and Dispatch." 15 Barclay's advertisements for binding brought him patrons from the country as indicated by a letter from Joseph Clarke, Northampton, written Jan. 18th, 1774, to Henry Knox, bookseller, in Boston. It begins: Sir,—I should be glad if you would send me a blank manuscript book, which contains about a quire and an half of paper in it. . . . If you have not any already made of the above size, as I suppose you have not, I should be glad if you would get one made by Mr. Berkley the book binder, or if it suits you best by some other book binder. 16 This was written in the year in which Henry Knox, later a General under George Washington, was advertising: London Book-Store, a little to the southward of the Town-House, Cornhill—Henry Knox imports. . . an elegant, valuable and large assortment of books—also the magazines, reviews. At the same place Dr. Keyser's highly celebrated pills—the never failing cure for the bite of a mad dog. 17 The letter gives no clue as to whether Andrew was still at the Second door north of the three Kings or whether he had moved, by this time, to his new address at the Sign of the Gilt Bible. Actually he had moved at the end of 1769 as a newspaper notice records: Removal from the Shop North Side of the Three Kings, to the other side of the way, nearly opposite to the Heart &amp; Crown, about half way between the old Brick Meeting &amp; Dr. Sewall's. . . . At the Sign of the Gilt Bible in Cornhill. 18 Presumably this move across the street from the proximity of "The Three Kings" where Thomas Knight sold English and West Indies goods, to a spot nearly opposite the Heart &amp; Crown, home of the Boston Evening-Post , published by T. &amp; J. Fleet, was a good one. At least Barclay could now, for the first time, boast his own sign, "The Gilt Bible." On this important street of the Town House, the Town Pump, and the old Brick Meeting House, there were at least five other booksellers at this period. It was a street of commerce where paper hangings, drugs, millinery, hardware, groceries, wine and beer, tobacco, drygoods and all kinds of clothing could be purchased, at "The Sign of the Crown and Mortar," "The Three Nuns and Comb," "The Button Tree," "The Golden Lyon," "The Black Boy and Butt," and so on. Since this move was made at the end of 1769, the broadside Catalogue of Books should reasonably be dated earlier as it bears the old address. Almost two years later we find Barclay advertising in Isaiah Thomas's patriot newspaper: Andrew Barclay, At the Gilt Bible in Cornhill, Hereby informs his customers and others, that he has just imported from Glasgow, a neat Assortment of BOOKS. . . . Likewise, all Sorts of Binding, Lettering, and Gilding done in the neatest and best manner. . . . 19 The next newspaper notice contains the name of Andrew Barclay in a different context. Before going forward with the story it is important to know what there is to know, at this point, of the life of this Scottish emigrant. To uncover the few facts that could be found about this man's life it was necessary to study him as a member of a group as well as an individual. Thomas recorded that he came to Boston from Scotland. A search of the Boston records where one might hope to find the date of his arrival was disappointing. Unhappily the shipping records containing the names of immigrants are lacking for the years before 1763, and the only information to be found was the marriage intention of Andrew Barclay &amp; Mary Bleigh—Oct. 15, 1761. 20 One John Barclay is recorded as having come over on the Ship Sterling Castle, from Greenock, on April 16, 1766, but there is no further mention of Andrew, not even a record of the marriage he intended. 21 A newspaper notice, nearly two years later, linked the names of John and Andrew Barclay in an interesting way: John Barclay, clothier and Dyer from Britain: Continues at Lynn Fulling-Mill, lately occupied by Mr. Mansfield; where he carries on the Clothing and Dyeing in all its Branches. . . . Any Persons who have not an opportunity of conveying their Cloth or Wool to the Mill, may send them to Andrew Barclay, Book-binder, second Door North of the Sign of the Three Kings, Cornhill, Boston, where they will be regularly sent to the Mill, and returned according to Direction. 22 Perhaps John Barclay was a younger brother who had left Scotland after favorable reports from Andrew in his new establishment in Cornhill. Andrew Barclay was one of a group of Scottish bookbinders and booksellers who worked in Boston before the War for Independence. Thomas names eight others: Walter and William MacAlpine, Alexander Carlisle, William Lang, John Hodgson, William Miller, John Mein, and John Fleming. In his brief biographical notice of William MacAlpine he spells out that printer's pronounced royalist sympathies, recording that he left Boston when it was evacuated by the British army and that he died at Glasgow, Scotland, in 1788. John Mein wrote against the colonies and, he reported, "became extremely odious." 23 Several books had been printed for Barclay by William MacAlpine and at least one by Nathaniel Mills and John Hicks. 24 The latter were not Scots but they were loyalists who also left for Halifax with the British army in March of 1776. It seems quite likely that Andrew Barclay may have joined his countrymen and associates in remaining loyal to Government, and so he did. Although his name is not listed with those of William MacAlpine, Scottish printer, and Nathaniel Hurd, engraver, as "Addressers" to Governor Hutchinson before that gentleman left the country in 1774, he joined them as "protesters" against the Solemn League and Covenant for the non-importation of goods, an act which would have ruined him commercially. 25 It is not hard to see why Andrew Barclay saw fit to join his neighbors on Cornhill in opposition to the Solemn League and Covenant. Many of the merchants and tradesmen in this busy street dealt almost exclusively in English goods or other importations. Barclay's binding and importations must have furnished the bulk of his income since his American publications were so few and insubstantial. The last book he is known to have published in Boston was a forty-seven page chapbook of Watts's Divine Songs (1775), which sold for only eight coppers. From now on Andrew Barclay, loyalist, was more prominent than Andrew Barclay, bookbinder, although he managed to practice his craft throughout the war. In his new role as "a protester against the Whigs" Barclay was duly chronicled with new information which led to a life beyond Boston: At the peace, accompanied by his family of ten persons, and by four servants, he went from New York to Shelburne, Nova Scotia, where the Crown granted him fifty acres of land, one town and one water lot. His losses in consequence of his loyalty were estimated at £200. He was living at Shelburne in the year 1805. 26 This opened up two new phases of Barclay's life, in New York and in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, but contributed little to his Boston career, or the transition to New York. Later a more detailed notice included several important clues: Andrew Barclay took an early and active part against the rebels at Boston, by taking up arms in the Loyal North British Volunteers. At the evacuation of Boston by the British troops in March, 1776, he sailed for Nova Scotia and thence to New York where he remained until the evacuation, where he was honoured by Sir Guy Carleton, Commander-in-chief, with the charge of a company of loyalist refugees bound for Shelburne, Nova Scotia, and settled there. 27 In joining the Loyal North British Volunteers, "said to have been the first volunteer company raised in America," Barclay was associating himself with about seventy others, most of them Scots like himself and many of them in the booktrade. 28 General Howe described the group in his Orderly Book , under date of 29th Octr 1775: Some North British Merchants residing in town with their adherents having offered their services for the defence of the place, the Commander in Chief has Ordered them to be Armed and Directed their being formed into a Company to be called the Royal North British Volunteers. . . they will be distinguished by a Blue Bonnet with a St. Andrew's cross upon it. 29 Only the officers are named and Andrew Barclay is not among them, but the third Lieutenant was J. Fleeming, a fellow bookseller. At least one member of the Loyal North British Volunteers was also a prominent member of the Scots Charitable Society, twenty of whose twenty-seven members were banished for loyalty. 30 This venerable Society had been formed in 1657 to help the prisoners of Cromwell sent over to New England following the battles of Dunbar and of Worcester and it remains in continuous existence since that date to this day, except for the years of the War for Independence. Andrew Barclay's name appears in the membership record, under date of 1772, with his origin as Kinross, Fifeshire. John Barclay is named under date of 1772 as coming from the same place, with the additional designation of "Keykeeper." 31 Andrew's original home place had at last been discovered and possibly his final home. But what of the years 1776 to 1783 and his New York experience? During the seven years before the peace in 1783 New York was filled with loyalist refugees from the north and from the south and it was more than doubtful that a Scottish bookbinder from Boston would distinguish himself sufficiently among them to become a part of the written history of that chaotic period. Andrew Barclay carried on his trade of bookselling and bookbinding, however, and continued to advertise in the newspapers. Fortunately there was a loyalist newspaper in New York at this time, published by two Scots, Alexander and James Robertson. In fact, there were four newspapers during the British occupation of New York so that one paper appeared each day. Files of the Royal American Gazette , published by the Robertsons, are not complete but it seemed worthwhile to seek them out in preference to other papers for several reasons. The paper was printed by Scots. The Robertsons were later joined by Nathaniel Mills and John Hicks, not only loyalists from Boston, but printers of one of Andrew Barclay's publications there. Most important of all, the newspaper was continued by the Robertsons in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, after the peace. If Barclay were to advertise at all in a newspaper this would surely be the one. In the year after he reached New York Andrew Barclay had a shop over a grocery store on Queen Street where he continued to sell and bind books. His advertisement in the newspaper appeared in the form of a long list of books on one page, with further data about his activity on another page, below an advertisement for vinegar, pickles, mushrooms, and catsup, at 25 Queen Street: N.B. At the shop above said cellar, Stationery of all kinds, Bibles, Testaments, Spelling Books &amp; variety of other books. Bookbinding done with expedition. . . . Cellar Store, next door to the Gilt Frying Pan, 1 Queen Street, between the Fly Market &amp; Bowling-slip. 32 Not quite a year later Mr. Barclay was advertising, "Books &amp; Stationary Just Imported, and to be Sold, by Andrew Barclay at No. 25, next door to the Gilt Frying Pan, King [sic] Street," in a double column list. 33 His business seems to have flourished for his shop became Shakespear's Head a few months later. 34 At the same address, he offered books in divinity, law, history, physic, geography, husbandry, novels, and so on, as well as all kinds of stationery supplied, ivory and rake combs, razors, tooth brushes, hair powder, three kinds of spectacles, buckles, silver and gilt sleeve buttons, . . . . Bibles, Testaments, Prayer-books, Spelling Books, Psalters, Primers, Playing Cards, etc., in that order. A gayer store than the Gilt Bible in Boston, surely. About this time Barclay may have been thinking of leaving New York for he begins to advertise auctions of books at his store, saying that the sales will be continued every Tuesday and Friday evening "during the present Winter." 35 He offers to give ready money for old books or to exchange them for new "upon reasonable terms." 36 The following February he lists for auction, "a collection of Valuable BOOKS, The very best Editions, elegantly bound." 37 In the spring of 1783 the Gazette printed many accounts of ships carrying refugees to Shelburne, or Port Roseway, as it was called, but there was no mention of Barclay's ship by name. Later accounts, however, indicate that it was in the fleet that left New York in the spring. On May 20 the paper reported, "Friday arrived a vessel from Hallifax, by which we learn that the fleet with about 6000 Refugees, which lately left this city, was safely landed at Port Roseway, after a six days passage." 38 Thus ended the New York sojourn. The romantic story of the rise and fall of Shelburne, Nova Scotia, a loyalist refuge, has been told often. Shelburne had been settled originally by a dozen Scottish and Irish families presumably attracted by "one of the finest harbours of the Atlantic." 39 It was first called Port Razoir, later corrupted to Port Roseway, and was finally named Shelburne after the refugees arrived there. When it was surveyed by two agents from Massachusetts, in the autumn of 1782, with a view to settling loyalist families there it was an abandoned settlement with only two or three fishermen in residence. The first, or "Spring", fleet set sail from New York on April 26, 1783, and about 4000 settlers arrived in May, 1783. Sailing ships continued to come all that year and were still arriving in January of 1784. Before the end of 1784 Shelburne had no less than 10,000 souls and it became, briefly, a place of business and of fashion. At one time there were no less than three newspapers published in the town, among them the Royal American Gazette of the Robertson brothers. Houses were taken down in New York, transported to Shelburne and re-erected there. The town was said to have been modelled on Philadelphia. By July 11, 1783, the clearing was advanced and lands were allotted. There were five long parallel streets with others crossing at right angles. "Each associate was given a town lot fronting on one of these streets as well as a water lot facing the harbor, and a fifty acre farm in the country." 40 Slaves who came with the refugees were settled in a neighboring town called Birchtown. In the end the ambitious plans for Shelburne came to nothing. It was, after all, a small fishing village with almost no means of livelihood for a population of this size, most of whom came from the large towns of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, and were not frontiersmen in any sense. In less than a year after the original allotments of land there was so much discontent with them that the Governor and Council found it necessary to appoint agents to assign lands to the settlers, "according to the king's instructions, and to report to the Governor." 41 One of these agents was Valentine Nutter, a bookseller and stationer from New York. Provisions and sums of money were donated by Quakers of Pennsylvania, "Being informed that a number of their brethren, Loyalists in Nova Scotia who had been driven from the United States on account of their fidelity to Great Britain, were in extreme distress, after the rations allowed by his Majesty's treasury had been withdrawn." 42 It is not altogether surprising to find that the community declined seriously after rations from the Crown and from charitable sources failed. This decline was so great that the population was only 379 in 1816. 43 Into this community came "Captain Andrew Barclay's company of fifty-five men and women and forty-nine children . . . no less than fifty-seven 'servants', . . ., nearly all slaves." 44 The Robertson brothers were in Barclay's company and they went about the business of publishing the Royal American Gazette in the new location but Andrew Barclay seems never to have advertised in it again. More attention was being given, in the press, to the primary necessities of life than to books. The former bookseller, Valentine Nutter, was advertising beef, codfish, and flour. The only book auction was advertised on February 21, 1785, by Robertson &amp; Rigby, auctioneers in King-street, opposite the British Coffee House. 45 The Port Roseway Gazetteer , published by the New York printers, T. &amp; J. Swords, between 1784 and 1787, and the Nova Scotia Packet , published by James Humphreys from Philadelphia, from 1785 to 1787, also contain no Barclay references. There is nothing in the scanty records of his life in Shelburne to indicate that Andrew Barclay ever pursued his career of bookbinding and bookselling as a business there though he is designated as a stationer in two separate documents. 45a The local records make it clear that "Captain Barclay" had a house in Shelburne as early as September of 1784, as the surveyor of the town noted in his diary, under date of September 19, "Capt. Turnbull came to meet me with a message from Capt. Barclay and others desiring me to meet them at Captain Barclay's house." 46 On May 17, 1784, Andrew Barclay was granted town lot No. 5, North, 60 feet, which carried with it a quitrent of one farthing, payable two years from the date of grant. The grant of water lot No. 88, South Division, was dated eleven days later and noted a quitrent of "One farthing for each lot, on the feast of St. Michael next after the expiration of ten years from date." 47 In June of 1784 Andrew Barclay was appointed by Governor Parr as Collector of the District of the River St. John from Point Labreate to Quaco Head. 48 Meanwhile he continued to acquire land. In 1785 he owned a fifty acre lot on McNutt's Island. 49 A deed, dated 1811, reads, "Stephen Skinner to Andrew Barclay—East Side of Jordan River, three lots—1260 acres more or less and said buildings." 50 In 1819 a grant of 500 acres on Roseway River West was escheated. 51 In the Capitation Tax for the Year, 1794, Andrew Barkley, Farmer, is taxed for three cows and horses. Farmer and landowner he was, and only incidentally still a bookbinder. A receipted bill submitted by Andrew Barclay to Capt. White, under the heading of Barclay Valley, September 9, 1809, includes an item midway, dated August 27, "To Binding Nelison's Memoirs, £0-3-0." The other services are those of a farmer: "To carrying the big wheels to Town. . . . To making 20th Candels &amp; 4 ounces wick. . . .," and for plowing with a man and four oxen. 52 No other record that Andrew Barclay bound a book in Shelburne has come to light. Of course the bookbinding tools and equipment had been left behind in Boston. Like all the other loyalists who had suffered losses Barclay submitted a claim for recompense from the Crown. In fact, he submitted more than one. His "New Claim," made from Shelburne, 15th April 1786, was rejected on 30th May thereafter. It notes that he arrived in Shelburne in May 1783, "where he has resided ever since." His schedule of losses is modest enough and he explains that, "altho infinitely short of what he really lost from the length of time elapsed he cannot be more particular." 53 The schedule lists Shop Goods of various kinds to the value of £20, Household Furniture valued at £40, and tools at £5, or a total of £65 Sterlg., a considerable scaling down from the £200 reported by Sabine. This claim hardly compares with that of £1800 from William MacAlpine of Boston, and the claim of £2000 from Valentine Nutter of New York. Obviously Andrew Barclay's business was not nearly as large, and the bindings containing his trade card which have turned up thus far may be representative of his entire output and a more elaborate binding in keeping with the label may not have ever existed. The escheat of his lands in 1819 must have been a climax to a precarious and uncongenial existence in Nova Scotia. An attempt was made to reclaim the escheated lands for his father by James Barclay. In March of 1823 he petitioned the Lieutenant Governor and Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty's Province of Nova Scotia for the return of his father's grant of a five-hundred acre lot on the West side of Roseway River, escheated "about two Years past, for want of the said Andrew Barclay knowing the proper steps to be taken, and not being able through infirmity to get up to Halifax to defend the said Lot." 54 About four months later Andrew Barclay died, "At Shelburne, July 2d, . . . in the 86th year of his age, an old and respectable inhabitant of that place." 55 His estate was appraised at £280.0.6 and among the items listed in his will were a set of bookbinder's stamps, a set of bookbinder's tools, one large and one small press and screw and a glue pot, all of them doubtless remaining from his New York days. 55a For forty of his eighty-six years this bookbinder, bookseller, who had clung to his trade throughout the Revolutionary War had lived in this isolated town of diminishing inhabitants earning a living from the soil. The fifteen or sixteen years Barclay passed in Boston were the high ones of his career. If little is known of the last forty years of his life, in Shelburne, even less is known of his early years in Scotland. He did not come from Kinross and Kinross is not in Fifeshire, the records of the Scots Charitable Society notwithstanding. Nor did he come from Fifeshire. He came from a hamlet called Cleish, near Kinross, the county seat of Kinrossshire and also in that shire. The fourth child and the third son of James Barclay, "litster", at Craigend, and his wife, Marion, he was baptized March 31, 1738. 56 A fourth son, John, was baptized September 21, 1740. Inasmuch as "litster" was the Scottish designation of "dyer" and John Barclay who came to Boston in 1766 pursued that occupation, these must have been the two brothers who emigrated there, Andrew, the bookbinder arriving first at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two, and brother John, coming six or seven years later at the age of twenty-six. Presumably Andrew learned his trade of binding in Scotland and was an apprentice there. The records of apprentices in Edinburgh name a James Barclay, "son to Alexr. Barclay, fermorer at Cleish, prentice to George Mosman, bookbinder, 10 December 1690," and no other Barclay. 57 James Barclay and his wife, Marion, neé Anderson, were married the 15th of October 1730. The Cleish registers do not go back of 1700 so they do not permit tracing Andrew's antecedents back of his father. It is tempting to speculate that the James Barclay who was apprenticed to George Mosman, bookbinder, bookseller, and printer to the Church of Scotland, in Edinburgh may have been Andrew Barclay's grandfather and that he might have learned bookbinding from this grandfather who, in turn, had learned the art from one of Edinburgh's distinguished booksellers. There was a bookbinder in Kinross, however, an Elizabeth, or Elspeth, Hutchison whose will was registered November 11th, 1765. 58 If Andrew had been apprenticed to her he might have had more reason to sign the Scots Charitable Society register as being from Kinross. At any rate, soon after he became of age Andrew Barclay sailed for America, there to practice his craft. A long search has produced the year of Andrew Barclay's birth in the village of Cleish in Scotland, 1738, the date of his death in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, July 2, 1823, and certain additional biographical data, as well as records of his publications and examples of his bookbinding. Though it is not possible to say with certainty exactly when and to whom he was apprenticed in Scotland, just when or why he came to Boston, or anything about "his family of ten," except for son James, it has emerged that he worked as a bookbinder and bookseller in Boston for at least ten years, between 1765 and 1775, that he looked forward to a career in bookbinding as shown by his label, that he gave up his work in the booktrade after pursuing it during the occupation of New York, that he became a political refugee and passed the last forty years of his life as a farmer and landowner working under difficult conditions in the undeveloped country around Shelburne, Nova Scotia. Despite its gaps this is a more complete picture than can be given for any other bookbinder in the American Colonies. The examples of Barclay's work in Boston which are presently known, show him to have fulfilled his promise of, "Binding, Lettering, and Gilding done in the neatest and best manner." Whether he did "all Sorts of Binding", or not, it is impossible to judge from six examples. This loyal Scot with the elegant trade card may have turned out handsome folios and quartos in the unique Scottish style. They remain to be discovered.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Contributors to the American Quarterly Review , 1827-1833 by Ralph M. Aderman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One frustrating aspect of many nineteenth-century American periodicals is that their contributors remain anonymous, usually with no marked set or other records left behind to identify them. While many of the writings justly deserve their anonymous entombment, others may add to the fugitive writings of well-known authors and increase our understanding of them. The American Quarterly Review is a case in point. Taking all knowledge for its province, it noticed everything from legal commentaries to histories of German and Italian music and systems of Egyptian hieroglyphics. Along with these more unconventional and esoteric subjects the magazine also discussed many of the important histories, biographies, travel books, and scientific works which had recently appeared or which continued to arouse interest despite their age. Linguistic barriers did not exist for the Review ; volumes in all languages ancient and modern which came under its critical scrutiny were dispatched with sureness and authority. The quarterly appealed to the serious cultured reader who had the patience to plumb the prolixities of the pages and dig out the nuggets buried therein. Edited by Robert Walsh, the American Quarterly Review was published by Carey and Lea in Philadelphia during its first six years. From the entries in the publishers' account book (now in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania) we learn some pertinent details about the contributors, most of whom heretofore have not been positively identified. 1 Even in these entries we find the name of an occasional reviewer omitted; frequently in these instances he was an editorial assistant who wrote just enough copy to pad out the issue. In the account book the usual pattern for the entry for each issue is to list, in order of appearance, the reviewers, the total number of pages they contributed, and the payment they received. In a few instances the order of the contributors in the listing in the account book does not correspond to the order in the magazine, but usually these discrepancies can be worked out by checking the number of pages in the review with the number assigned to contributors in the account book. Although Robert Walsh often assigned books to the best authorities in the field, he still drew heavily upon the intellectuals of the Philadelphia area to write the essay-reviews for his journal. Professors, lawyers, physicians, and writers contributed articles which are thorough, searching discussions but all too frequently written in a heavy-handed style that today repulses all but the hardiest reader. The dullness of the pages of the American Quarterly Review is no greater than some of its contemporaries, and it doubtless appealed to a thoughtful segment of the population which passed its time in reading learned discourses such as these. Reader interest is reflected in the size of the printings, which varied from 4500 copies per issue to 1250. In the following list, details from the account book and the magazine are combined. First, the reviewer is identified, together with the pages which his article occupies in the issue and his payment as listed in the account book.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 I wish to thank the Historical Society of Pennsylvania for permission to use this account book. I wish also to thank the Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin for financial assistance for this study. Through a study of the relevant correspondence Sister M. Frederick Lochemes corroborates the author identifications of twenty-seven of the reviews which fall within the period when Carey and Lea published the American Quarterly Review . On the basis of allusions or inferences in letters she also ascribes several reviews to authors who are not acknowledged as the contributors in the account book. Despite her assiduous detective work she was unable to identify a large proportion of the articles. See her Robert Walsh: His Story (1941), pp. 140-144. Professor Frank Luther Mott says that he used a set of the American Quarterly Review which identified some of the contributors. The set, at the Cadmus Book Shop, New York City when Mott consulted it, has since been sold, with no record of its purchaser. A History of American Magazines , 1741-1850 (1938), pp. 272-278. 2 Walsh (1784-1858), who earlier had edited the American Review of History and Politics (1811) and the American Register (1817-1819), was known for his spirited defense of the United States in An Appeal from the Judgments of Great Britain (1819). 3 Renwick (1792-1863), a man of wide interests, was professor of natural and experimental philosophy at Columbia College, 1820-1853. 4 Beasley (1777-1845) was professor of moral philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, 1813-1828. 5 Godman (1794-1830), who lectured on anatomy in Philadelphia from 1822 to 1824, was professor of anatomy at Rutgers College from 1826 until he resigned because of ill health a year later. 6 Hopkinson (1770-1842), known as the author of "Hail, Columbia," was judge of the United States District Court at Philadelphia from 1828 until his death. 7 Pitkin (1765-1847) was working at this time on The Political and Civil History of the United States, from 1763 to the Close of Washington's Administration (1828). 8 Bancroft (1800-1891), one of the proprietors of the Round Hill School, Northampton, Massachusetts, is known for his History of the United States (1834-1874). His payment for this article is not at the usual rate of $2 per page because the review contained 5⅓ pages of direct quotations which Carey and Lea did not include in the computation. 9 Duponceau (1760-1844) was a lawyer and philologist who was particularly interested in the languages of American Indians. 10 Paulding (1778-1860), author and Navy official, published The New Mirror for Travellers, and a Guide to the Springs (1828), a study of watering places in New York. 11 Patterson (1787-1868) was professor of natural philosophy at the University of Virginia and later director of the United States Mint at Philadelphia. 12 Rawle (1789-1858) was reporter of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania from 1814 to 1836. 13 Lochemes (p. 141) ascribes this review to George Tucker (1775-1861), a professor at the University of Virginia. However, it might possibly have been written by Beverly Tucker (1784-1851), a professor of law at William and Mary College who wrote The Partisan Leader (1836) defending the states' rights position. 14 Snowden was editor of the Philadelphia Monthly Magazine . Lochemes (p. 141) attributes this review to William W. Snowden. 15 La Roche (1795-1872), a physician by profession, was interested in music, in consequence of which he collected a large, valuable library of music scores and criticism. 16 Wharton (1791-1856) was a scholarly Philadelphia lawyer who specialized in real estate law. 17 Sanderson (1785-1844), a contributor to the Port Folio , wrote The Lives of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence (1820) and Skecthes of Paris (1838). Lochemes (p. 143) states that Peter S. Duponceau was the reviewer, but the account books do not list him as a contributor to this issue. 18 Vethake (1792-1866), who published Principles of Political Economy (1838), was provost of the University of Pennsylvania from 1852 to 1859. 19 Probably Theron Metcalf (1784-1875), who compiled a digest of the decisions of the Massachusetts Supreme Court. 20 Murat (1801-1847), who immigrated to Florida in 1822 and spent the rest of his life there, wrote about the United States government in Esquisse morale et politique des Etats-Unis de l'Amérique du Nord (1832) and Exposition des principes du gouvernement républicain, tel qu'il a été perfectionné en Amérique (1833). 21 According to Lochemes (p. 143), President John Quincy Adams was the reviewer. If Adams wrote the review, he is not mentioned in the account book either as contributor or recipient of payment. Perhaps because of Adams' position his contribution was handled differently. 22 Cooper (1759-1840), a student of law, chemistry, and medicine, translated the Institutes of Justinian in 1812, while he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. A review of a Homeric study hardly seems beyond the reach of his vast erudition. 23 Read (1769-1854), a lawyer and Pennsylvania legislator, was president of the Philadelphia Bank from 1819 to 1841. Lochemes (p. 141) calls Joel R. Poinsett the author of this review. 24 Not identified. 25 Dunglison (1798-1869), a professor of physiology and pathology at the University of Virginia, wrote Human Physiology , which was reviewed by Robert Patterson in the American Quarterly Review , XIII, 375-403 (June, 1833). 26 Ticknor (1791-1871) was professor of French and Spanish at Harvard College from 1817 to 1835. 27 Lieber (1798-1872), a German refugee who taught gymnastics upon his arrival in America in 1827, was later professor of history and political economy at South Carolina College from 1835 to 1860. 28 This review is credited to a Dr. Bode by Lochemes (p. 143), but the account book lists Paulding as author. The entry for this issue sets down together the two reviews by Renwick and the two by Walsh in the appropriate order of the first article, with an indication that the other article has the same author. In this sequence, with omissions for articles VIII and X, Paulding's review of thirty pages fits into its proper place. Dr. Bode is mentioned nowhere in the American Quarterly Review accounts. 29 Wayland (1796-1865), who studied medicine and later entered the ministry, became president of Brown University in 1827. 30 Rantoul (1805-1852), at this time a recent graduate of Harvard, later represented Massachusetts in Congress. 31 Mitchell (1798-1858) was a poet and physician who from 1841 till his death was a professor at the Jefferson Medical College. 32 James (1766-1835), editor of the Eclectic Repository from 1811 to 1822, was professor of midwifery at the University of Pennsylvania from 1810 to 1834. 33 Wheaton (1785-1851), chargé d'affaires to Denmark from 1827 to 1835, published History of the Northmen in 1831. 34 Lea (1792-1866), associated with Mathew Carey in the publishing business, was interested in geology and natural history. 35 The name is partially illegible but probably Gilpin (1801-1860), at this time editor of The Atlantic Souvenir (also a Carey and Lea venture), who served as Van Buren's Attorney-General in 1840-1841. 36 Pickering (1772-1846) was a Boston philologist particularly interested in Greek and the American Indian languages. 37 Bedell (1798-1834) was rector of St. Andrew's Church, Philadelphia, from 1823 to 1834. 38 Bayard (1767-1840) was interested in legal and religious matters. 39 Not identified. 40 In the account book this unpaid review is referred to as "Russia." On several occasions this pattern of reference is used. Probably the article was prepared by Walsh or one of his editorial assistants. 41 Cushing (1800-1879), a lawyer from Massachusetts, served in Congress from 1835 to 1843. 42 In the account book this anonymous paid review is referred to as "Libel." 43 Not identified. 44 This may be Nathaniel A. Ware (d. 1854), who served as the last secretary of the Territory of Mississippi (1815-1817). Ware knew Henry C. Carey of Philadelphia and supported his ideas. 45 Alexander (1804-1859), who studied history at Princeton, was a professor at the College of New Jersey and later at Princeton Seminary. 46 Hall (1793-1868), judge and editor in Illinois, wrote numerous stories about the West. 47 Brevoort (1793-1848) was a cosmopolitan friend of Washington Irving. 48 Robert Moylan Walsh (1812-1895), son of Robert Walsh, Jr., became editor of the American Quarterly Review in 1836. 49 Possibly Joseph Ray (1807-1855), a teacher and mathematician. 50 Laussat (1806-1833), a member of the Law Academy of Philadelphia, published An Essay on Equity in Pennsylvania in 1826 . 51 Meredith (1799-1873), a Philadelphia attorney, served in the Pennsylvania legislature from 1824 to 1828 and presided over the Select Council of Philadelphia from 1834 to 1849. 52 Since there is no entry for this issue in the account book, only the pages of each review are listed here. 53 The account book lists the contributor as "Eckhard," who is probably James Read Eckard (1805-1887), who studied law before entering the ministry in 1830. 54 Tanner (1786-1858) published The American Traveller; or Guide through the United States in Philadelphia in 1834, a work which went through ten editions; in 1841 he published A Geography, History and Statistical View of the Central or Middle United States . 55 Lochemes (p. 144) attributes this review to Walsh, while the account book credits the preceding article to him. Since all of the other essays in this issue follow the order of the list in the account book, I think it is safe to insist that article VII was written by Paulding. In addition, Walsh frequently reviewed books of travel as earlier entries indicate. 56 Da Ponte (1749-1838), Mozart's librettist who came to the United States in 1805, was professor of Italian literature at Columbia College. 57 Probably William H. Keating (1799-1840), who published Conversations on Chemistry (1824) and collaborated on Narrative of an Expedition to the Source of St. Peter's River, Lake Winnipeek, Lake of the Woods . (1825). 58 The account book lists Walsh as the author of Article VIII, while Lochemes (p. 141) states that Joel R. Poinsett wrote it. Article IX on Cuba, which is omitted entirely from the account book, might fall within Poinsett's interest in Spanish America. 59 Ingersoll (1782-1862), a lawyer and Representative from Pennsylvania, was a staunch defender of the United States in Inchiquin, the Jesuit's Letters (1810). 60 McHenry (1785-1845), a Philadelphia poet, playwright, and physician, published the short-lived American Monthly Magazine in 1824. 61 Not identified. 62 Markoe, an attorney in Philadelphia, later became the corresponding secretary of the National Institution. 63 Walsh is credited with thirty-two pages of contributions, so probably he is also the author of article V. 64 Gallatin (1761-1849), long active in public life, was United States Minister to France from 1816 to 1823. 65 All reference to this review is omitted from the account book. Lochemes (p. 143) attributes it to Albert Gallatin, although he is credited in the account book with only twenty pages for which he received no payment. 66 This review Lochemes (p. 142) ascribes to Renwick, probably on the basis of his earlier articles on hieroglyphics. However, the account book credits Bedell with twelve pages. Renwick's thirty-three pages are listed second in the account book, even though his review of "Iron" is the fourth article. Articles II and III are listed in the third and fourth places in the account book. 67 Paulding, who is listed in sixth place in the account book with twenty-one pages, was certainly well qualified to review a study of Europe and America. This article Lochemes (p. 144) attributes to Walsh. 68 The account book enters this review covering thirty-seven pages with no payment for it as "Webster." Lochemes (p. 141) suggests that it was written by George Ticknor. 69 The account book labels this item "View." 70 Possibly Henry Reed (1808-1854), professor of literature and moral philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania from 1831 to 1854. 71 This signature was used at times by the editor, Robert Walsh. 72 Parsons (1797-1882), editor of the United States Literary Gazette from 1824 to 1826, was later a professor at the Harvard Law School. 73 Meigs (1792-1869) was a prominent Philadelphia physician and a professor in the Jefferson Medical College. 74 Lochemes (p. 141) attributes this review to Senator Josiah Johnson (1784-1833), but I think that Reverdy Johnson (1796-1876), a Baltimore constitutional lawyer and later United States Senator from Maryland, is just as feasible. 75 Follen (1796-1840) taught German, philosophy, and theology at Harvard College from 1825 to 1835. 76 Probably Capt. James Harman Ward (1806-1861), who published numerous scholarly works on scientific subjects. 77 Probably Joseph Blunt (1792-1860), who published The Shipmaster's Assistant, and Commercial Digest: Containing Information Useful to Merchants, Owners, and Masters of Ships (1837). Lochemes (p. 143) credits George Bancroft with writing this article. 78 Caldwell (1772-1853), a resident of the West from 1819 until his death, was head of the medical department of Transylvania University. 79 Dew (1802-1846) was professor of moral science at William and Mary College. Lochemes (p. 141) attributes this article to Senator Josiah Johnson, but he is not in the list in the account book. 80 This may be Henry Clay (1777-1852), who occasionally contributed to magazines during his busy political career. 81 Hare (1781-1858) was professor of chemistry at the medical college of the University of Pennsylvania. 82 Emerson (1777-1833), a clergyman, educator, and Mason, had written in 1828 Letter to the Members of the Genesee Consociation protesting the anti-Masonic resolution of that group. 83 This may be a misspelling of William Gilmore Simms (1806-1878), Southern historical novelist. 84 Not identified. 85 Probably Alfred Langdon Elwyn (1804-1884), a wealthy graduate of Harvard who took his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1831. Elwyn collected a valuable library of source materials on United States history. 86 Sydney G. Fisher (1809-1871) was a Philadelphia lawyer interested in political and social problems. Lochemes (p 143) states that Salmon P. Chase reviewed the book, but "Syd. Fisher" is the author listed in the account book. 87 Not identified. 88 Probably William Beach Lawrence (1800-1882), a well-known New York lawyer. Lochemes (p. 142) ascribes this review to George Bancroft, but the account book clearly indicates that Bancroft wrote article VI and Lawrence article VII. 89 Gerhard (1809-1872) was a Philadelphia physician who studied in Paris. 90 Hood (1780?-1875) wrote Practical Treatise on Law relating to Registers, Registers' Courts, Orphans' Courts, Auditors, Executors, Administrators, Guardians, and Trustees in Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, 1847). 91 Probably Timothy Walker (1802-1856), who left Massachusetts for Cincinnati in 1830, organized a law school there in 1833, and was prominent in Ohio legal circles thereafter. 92 Not identified. 93 Budd was a Philadelphia attorney. 94 Probably William Logan Fisher (1781-1862), a Philadelphia writer.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Agent and Author: Ellen Glasgow's Letters to Paul Revere Reynolds by James B. Colvert 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shortly after Harper and Brothers published her first novel, The Descendant , in 1897, Ellen Glasgow laid out a program. The success of The Descendant notwithstanding, she decided after candid self-examination that she had no technique, no art, no way of controlling her ideas; and to remedy these weaknesses she plunged into a study of the great masters of the craft of fiction—James, Flaubert, Maupassant, and Tolstoy. Her ambition was to be a great novelist, and she was determined to spare nothing in her preparation for the achievement of her goal. The forty-one letters to her literary agent, Paul Revere Reynolds—now in the Barrett Collection at the University of Virginia—throw a good deal of light on these ambitious years. They help to date the various stages of composition of some of her early novels, reveal something of her attitude toward them and the novel in general, and show how carefully, even jealously, she protected her conception of herself as a writer. Although the letters cover a period of thirty-two years (1897-1930), more than half were written in the crucial years before 1901, when she was carefully laying the groundwork for her career. With poise, judgment, and sense of sureness remarkable in a literary novice in her mid-twenties, she shows that she had no intention of allowing her aesthetic goal to be compromised by carelessness in bringing her work before the public. She shows too that she knew from the very beginning precisely what she thought about her talent, the medium best suited to it, and the kind of audience she wanted for it. Proper audience—and by this Miss Glasgow meant an intelligent, discriminating audience—is the most commonly recurring subject in the letters. It was her consideration for the right kind of audience, in fact, which seemed to govern a number of her opinions and decisions. Success, she pointed out several times, meant to her succès d'estime . "I hope," she wrote Reynolds in reference to her second novel, Phases of An Inferior Planet , "that the book will be successful, but the kind of success I prefer most now is that which comes from a discriminating public—which is never large" (Letter 17). And she reminded Reynolds again and again that she wanted none of her work to appear in second-rate magazines, a condition rigorously enforced until she was established well enough to command top prices for her stories. But even then the standing of the magazine was a major consideration with her (Letters 34, 36 and 40). It is clear, I think, that Miss Glasgow was convinced that England could afford a more discriminating audience than America. Consequently, the English publication of her novels—a subject touched on in a good many of the early letters—was a matter of special concern, perhaps even, as Letter 2 suggests, of anxiety. The most pointed and emphatic letters in the group are those dealing with this subject, and their firmness of tone suggests an attitude bordering on Anglophilia. Writing to Walter Hines Page in March, 1898, she asked rather wistfully, "Given equally good work, do you believe that an American writer has as fair a chance of fame as an English one? I confess my own doubts strengthen the position that it is well for a writer to manage to be born in England if he can . . . ." 2 Her letters to Reynolds reflect the same attitude. She wanted a distinct English edition of her work, one issued by "a wholly English house" (Letter 10), a request that seems to say that she would prefer her English edition to have as little association with America as possible. "You know the opinion I have of Mr. Heinemann as a publisher," she wrote, but the crossed out capital "E" suggests that she started to write "English publishers" instead of "Mr. Heinemann," a slip which shows that she might have been thinking in generic rather than in specific terms. One notes, too, that the question of financial return was even less a consideration in respect to the English edition than in respect to the American. It might have been her concern for proper audience which helped Miss Glasgow decide that the novel, not the short story, was her true medium, though the opinion also seems to have rested partly on aesthetic grounds. She renounced the short story early in her career and expressed the wish that she could recall those she had already written (Letter 5). Although she continued to write them occasionally and even published a collection, The Shadowy Third and Other Stories , in 1928, she was never really very interested in them. It was probably Walter Hines Page who confirmed her in the opinion that the medium was of little value in developing the kind of audience she should have. "As regards my work," she wrote Page in November, 1897, when he was literary advisor to the Atlantic Monthly , "I shall follow your advice in full. I shall write no more short stories. . . ." Page's reply warned her that "authors of promise scatter the influences that ought to go towards the firm and steady building of great reputation by appearing in print here, there, and everywhere," 3 by which he meant appearing in print with short stories. Miss Glasgow's comment to Reynolds, however, suggests that her reason for renouncing the story was that she regarded the form as unsuited to her talent: "The truth is that I am a novelist, not a writer of short stories, &amp; in putting them upon the market I am trying to pass my least good work upon the public." Page, incidentally, influenced Miss Glasgow in another matter touched on in the letters—her decision to give her third novel, The Voice of the People (1900) to Doubleday, Page, and Company rather than to her regular publishers, Harper and Brothers. He informed her in 1899 that Harper and Brothers was operating on a subsidy from the banking house of J. P. Morgan, a subsidy so large, in fact, that the publishers were for all practical purposes in the hands of a receiver. Miss Glasgow, fearful for the safety of her book, gave it to Doubleday, Page and Company—on the condition, one notes, that Page should say that he "heartily believed in the novel." 4 Reynolds, as Letter 29 indicates, protested this action and Miss Glasgow's reply to his objection shows how firmly and jealously she regarded the welfare of her novels. The most dramatic letter in the collection is the last one, a single sentence refusal of an offer of $20,000 for the serial rights to one of her novels. Earlier in her career she expressed a good deal of interest in serialization of her work (Letters 7 and 27), but a growing reluctance (Letters 33 and 36), eventually became, as Letter 41 shows, a positive antipathy. Her objection, if we can judge from Reynold's memorandum of June 8, 1910, was primarily aesthetic. "She thinks," Reynolds noted, "there might be too much atmosphere and characterization to make it [ The Miller of Old Church ] a good serial but thought it could be cut and condensed" (note to Letter 33). But nothing came of this plan; only one of her books, The Builders , was ever serialized. 5 The blunt refusal of the final letter, though, is in no way out of character, for the letters, taken all together, record a continuous refusal of everything that conflicted with her principles. She refused quick and easy financial returns and popular fame, but above all she refused all uneasy doubts about the final worth of her work. As the letters show, she served her ambition to be a great novelist with bold, decisive, and uncompromising action—action as bold and decisive as the looping, nervous handwriting in which she issued her directions to Reynolds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 1. 400 West 57th Street | [New York, N. Y.] | November 1, 1897 Dear Mr. Reynolds : I enclose a note received some days ago from the McClure Company. You will know whether or not to submit one of the stories 1 to that magazine before disposing of them. I received also a very cordial letter from the Editor of Harper's Magazine, 2 expressing the hope that the Messrs. Harper would publish all my work. Before leaving the city I should like to talk with you concerning the placing of my new book 3 in England. Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 2. Richmond, Virginia | [ November, 1897 ] Dear Mr. Reynolds : I have just received a letter from Harper, stating that "since Mr. Paul R. Reynolds has already begun negotiations for the publication of the work in England, we think it better, under the circumstances, not to interfere with his arrangements." So you see the book must be placed with an English publisher. Furthermore, since they intend to bring it out immediately, it must be copyrighted before they do so. As you know I am perfectly willing to accept the lowest terms, but it must be brought out as soon as possible—or, at least, placed in ms. Harper has the Canadian rights. The thought that I may not secure English publication is worrying me very much. Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow Heinemann first and then Sampson, Low &amp; Co; and what about John Lane or Dent? However, left to you, I am sure it will be all right. I told you my arguments would convince Harper. 1 E. G.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 3. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | December 3, 1897 My dear Mr. Reynolds : Your letter has just been received &amp; I forward my address at once. If the check is made payable to you will you kindly deduct your commission &amp; the price of the copy of "The Descendant," which you sent Mr. Heinemann. I forgot to mention this before. As soon as you hear from the English publisher, will you let me [ know deleted] hear from you. On one point I am quite decided &amp; that is that I wish an English publisher for my new book—the English edition. If Heinemann does not wish to take it, will you consult with another publisher for me—some young enterprising firm preferred, who will take a special interest in pushing my books. When the book is completed I shall have two typewritten copies made, one to be sent to England by you—if you can arrange matters. I hope to finish it in March. 1 Very sincerely, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 4. One West Main Street | [ Richmond, Va. ] December 6, 1897 Dear Mr. Reynolds : I received the check which was quite satisfactory. I shall await the reply of Mr. Heinemann &amp; hope that it will be all right. If not I suppose I can make other arrangements. Thanking you for your trouble. I am Very sincerely, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 5. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | January 27, 1898 Dear Mr. Reynolds : I have just received your letter. My novel is finished and I am now making arrangements for its publication. As soon as the arrangements are settled I will let you know. Will you kindly write me if it is better to send a typewritten ms. to England or the corrected proofs. I don't know whether I explained to you that in the English transactions the question of financial returns is the least to be considered. From a publisher interested in pushing the book, a merely nominal royalty will content me. I should prefer that Mr. Heinemann should take the novel— Will You kindly return me the short story you have. I have decided to write no more short articles—and I wish I could recall them all. Very sincerely, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 6. Richmond, Virginia | January 28, 1898 My dear Mr. Reynolds : I will send you a typewritten copy of the novel in time for Mr. Heinemann to see it in New York if you will let me know when he is to be here. Of course, there will be many corrections in the proof sheets and the copy I have is in very bad condition, but I suppose he is used to that. I shall be so grateful if you will do your best for me in this English affair. By that I mean secure me an able and enterprising publisher. I don't know just yet who is to have the American rights, but even if the Harpers bring it out over here, I should still prefer an English publisher in London. Indeed, no, I do not in the least feel it to be your fault that the short story has not sold. The truth is that I am a novelist, not a writer of short stories, &amp; in putting them upon the market I am trying to pass my least good work upon the public. This is my point of view and this is why I asked you to return it. In placing my ms. of my novel in your hands I am giving proof of great confidence in you. Its success (from an artistic standpoint) means more to me than I can say. Very sincerely, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 7. Richmond, Virginia | February 12, 1898 My dear Mr. Reynolds : I am sending you by the express of today or tomorrow the ms. of my novel "Phases of an Inferior Planet." I can't tell you just yet when it will be published in this country, but I should like, of course, to arrange for simultaneous publication in both countries. Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 8. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | February 17, 1898 Mr. Paul R. Reynolds : Please deliver to Messrs. Harper Brothers the copy you have of my book "Phases". They will return it to you after reading it. Yours truly, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Reynolds No 70 5th Av. Letter 9. Richmond, Virginia | [ February, 1898 ] Dear Mr. Reynolds : Of course I am greatly pleased that Mr. Heinemann will publish the book and I accept his terms, with thanks . I much prefer the royalty and agree with you that it will probably prove better in the long run. Please write Mr. Heinemann that I accept the 15% royalty. The Canadian rights belong to Harper, as I have signed a contract to that effect. I think Mr. Heinemann is incorrect in supposing that Harper intends to publish the book in the autumn. My impression is that they wish to bring it out at once. I have already corrected the proof of about one fourth of the book and they are sending them rapidly. I have written to them for a double set. Yes, please confer with them in regard to the copyrighting, etc. Indeed, I think I am very much to be congratulated upon the placing of the book, and I feel very heartily that I owe it entirely to your management of my affairs. I wish to thank you again for the trouble you have taken. Of course all the business transactions between Mr. Heinemann and myself will take place through you, and you will deduct your commissions when it reaches you. Please return the manuscript and I will send the proofs as soon as I secure them. Believe me, Very sincerely, Ellen Glasgow Kindly send me Mr. Heinemann's London address. I wish to answer his letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 10. Richmond, Virginia | February 28, 1898 Dear Mr. Reynolds : The American rights of my book I have given to the Mssrs. Harper, they having cheerfully agreed to take it on such terms as I myself thought satisfactory—entirely so, I may say. They spoke to me concerning the English edition and I have told them that should they desire it, I would ask you, to confer with them, if you had not made other arrangements. Of course Mr. Heinemann [ is my deleted] must have the first opportunity and I must confess that in my unbusiness-like fashion I have spoken very strongly to the Messrs. Harpers in favour of a wholly English house. You know the opinion I have of [ E deleted] Mr. Heinemann as a publisher. In treating with the Harpers I do not care to be exacting with regards to the English rights, but any concessions I should wish to be my loss, not yours. I do not know as yet, but it is probable that the book will be brought out in the U. S. immediately. Thank you very heartily for your kind inquiries as to my health. As you will doubtless gather from this scrawl I am still very unwell and have not as yet been able to leave my room. When you write again will you kindly tell me if Mr. John Lane of the Bodley Head is ever to be found in his American office? This, of course, has nothing to do with my novels. 1 With regards to yourself, I am, sincerely, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 11. Richmond, [Va.] | [ March, 1898] Dear Mr. Reynolds : The Messrs. Harper have written me that they are desirous (as I wrote you some time [a]go I thought they were) of publishing the book late in May or early in June. To postpone it until this autumn would mean sacrificing the best selling season of the year, &amp; it would be a decided loss to me in many ways. Has Mr. Heinemann any objection to its appearing then? Will you kindly communicate with him and arrange it as best you can, remembering that my urgent wish is to have the book appear in this country not later than early in June. Very sincerely, Ellen Glasgow I forgot to ask you please to return the ms. at my expense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 12. Richmond, Virginia | [February or March, 1898 ] Dear Mr. Reynolds : Please explain to Mr. Heinemann that the proofs that have been sent to him were corrected before I knew of the changes he desired, and that they went to him before I had an opportunity to re-correct, since out of consideration for me, the Messrs. Harper forwarded you corrected proofs. I have neither proofs nor ms. by me, but the changes to be made are as follows: 1st When the word "fire escape" occurs it should be altered to "balcony." It is in constant use throughout the 1st part. 2nd The word "jag" occurs once, I think, in Chap. 1. "Spree" should be used instead. 3rd If the past form of the word "got" is written "gotten" it should be replaced by "got." This form is in constant use down here, but I notice it does not appear in English books. 1 The Messrs. Harper wrote me that if Mr. Heinemann does not care to publish until autumn they will send him over, at my expense, the six copies required by law. I leave this entirely to your desire, of course. I wish Mr. Heinemann to bring the book out when he thinks best. Very sincerely, Ellen Glasgow I am very anxious to get this book off my mind. Please let me know if the Harpers sent you proofs of the extract pages, especially the dedication? I have been very ill again, which accounts for my seeming inconsequence in the last few letters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 13. Richmond, Virginia | March 9, [1898] Dear Mr. Reynolds : My illness has made it out of the question that I should go to Washington to meet Mr. Heinemann, but I wrote to him at the Shoreham as you suggested. Thinking that I might interest him to see a little of the South, I suggested his coming to Richmond to make us a visit. Frankly, I can't see what there was for us to say to Providence and make too few individual attempts to curry favour with it. 1 Thanking you for the interest you have shown. I am, Very sincerely, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 14. Richmond, Virginia | March 25, 1898 Dear Mr. Reynolds :- The Mssrs. Harper have written me to the effect that they have stated to you terms at which they will let Mr. Heinemann have duplicate plates of "Phases." 1 Of course, whether Mr. Heinemann accepts them or not does not concern me. If he does not they will send me proofs to correct. At any rate some small changes will have to be made in the English plates which I do not wish to make in the American—for instance "balcony" instituted for "fire escape" over here would impair the naturalness of New York summer days, and the word "jag" for "spree" is much more in keeping with the young journalists I know. But these I wished changed for the English. Also it would be impertinence on my part to offer a foot-note explaining Tammany to the American public. Very nearly half the proofs are corrected. Please let me know when a date for publication is decided. Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 15. Richmond, Virginia | April 17, 1898 Dear Mr. Reynolds : I forwarded you the other day the last proofs of "Phases of an Inferior Planet." I hope you have received the whole of it. I enclose the dedication and title-page motto for the book. Will you kindly send them to Mr. Heinemann in view of the possibility that they were not included in the first supply of proof which the Messrs. Harper sent you. Will you also inform Mr. Heinemann that at his suggestion I added a foot note to the last proofs [ defining deleted] giving definition of Tammany, but that unless he thinks it advisable I should prefer the note not to be used.

      <field name="fulltext">Letter 16. [ Richmond, Va. ] | May 10, 1898 Dear Mr. Reynolds : Will you kindly get the enclosed poem into some English Journal—the price doesn't matter. I purpose bringing out a small volume of poems within the year, 1 &amp; I should like this to appear before then in any English magazine or daily paper— What do you think of asking McClure's if they would care for a poem to be brought out within the next few months? You might sound them &amp; let me know. Very sincerely, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 17. Crockett Arsenic-Lithia Springs | Shawsville, Virginia | September 27, 1898 Dear Mr. Reynolds : Thanks for the English copy of "Phases." It was very thoughtful of you to send it. I have not seen it as yet for I am stranded afar off in the mountains, but I return home next Monday—the 3rd of October—and the book will be awaiting me. So far I have only seen the American edition through the chance order which a guest in this little place sent to Brentano's—there having been some delay in the delivering of the package from Harpers. Yes, I hope that the book will be successful, but the kind of success I prefer most now is that which comes from a discriminating public—which is never large. At all events I am very well satisfied with my publishers. As for the work I am doing now it is the beginning of a serious and tedious amount of toil. I am beginning a long novel upon modern conditions of life in Virginia and I have made a vow not to be drawn from it for the next two years. 1 Of course, to refrain from publishing anything until two years from last spring (when the book was begun) will try my patience sorely, but I hope to be repaid in the end. Yes, I should like to make a serial of it very well. I expect, by the way, to be in New York for a month about the middle of November. Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 18. [ Richmond, Va. ] | October 18, 1898 Dear Mr. Reynolds , I should like the enclosed poem to appear in some Christmas magazine if possible—how about McClure's? An early publication is imperative since I may bring out a collection before long. If you find any trouble about selling either of them, don't mind about sending them home again. Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 19. [ Richmond, Va. ] | December 23, 1898 Dear Mr. Reynolds: It is all right about the verses. Send them back, by all means. I am expecting to leave America the 1st of February for a period of eight months or so and if I am in New York long enough before sailing, I should like to see you and to ask you a few questions. I shall most probably sail for Egypt first, reaching London about June. It was very kind of you to see about the English verses. Wishing you a pleasant Christmas, I am, Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 20. New York, N. Y. | February 3, 1899 My dear Mr. Reynolds , I am very sorry not to see you in New York, but my doctor has forbidden my stopping in the city, so I am only here for a night's rest. I sail for Egypt tomorrow on the Allen at eleven o'clock. I hope that the sea trip will strengthen me sufficiently to keep me working at fever heat for the next few years.

      <field name="fulltext">Letter 21. Richmond, [Va.] | September 7, 1899 Dear Mr. Reynolds , I have just returned to America, reaching New York on the Kaiser Wilhelm last Tuesday. It had been my intention to see you in New York, but I was there so short a time that I found it impossible to do so. I now find your letters here that were sent me last spring and I make a late acknowledgement of them. My trip was quite successful and I am stronger and readier for work. Mr Heinemann, whom I saw in London, is extremely nice and Mrs. Heineman is very charming. I am now going back to my book. 1 But it will not be completed for some time. I hope you have had good luck, and I am Very sincerely, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 22. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | December 7, 1899 My dear Mr. Reynolds : It has become so natural for me to demand advice of you that I shall not even ask pardon for the trouble I may put you to. This is what one gets for being kind to such an ignorant thing as an author. Will you let me (and this of course is confidential) [know] what you know of the present condition of the house of Harper &amp; Brothers? I have been approached by another house upon the subject of my new book—the new publishers taking for granted that I shall not wish to continue with the present management, which, they maintain, is not Harper and Brothers at all, but merely a business conducted by a receiver to pay off his creditors, in which he may sell any of the books at any time. As you know I like the Messrs. Harper—they have always been kind to my interests, and I do not wish to leave them unless it is true that the business is not really under their direction, or unless I might reap greater advantages for my book. Will you write me what you think about it? Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 23. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | December 10, 1899 My dear Mr. Reynolds : It was very good of you to answer my questions so promptly. The overtures regarding my new book have come through Mr. Walter H. Page (who wanted me to give my last novel to Houghton and Mifflin). He writes me, confidentially, that Mr. Doubleday is to withdraw his publishing interests from Mr. McClure, and that the firm will henceforth be "Doubleday, Page, &amp; Co." Do you know anything of this arrangement? Mr. Page has shown a great deal of interest in my book, but as a publisher, I have no knowledge of either Mr. Doubleday or himself. As a rule I do not like new firms, but I should be glad to hear what you think of the matter. Mr. Page tells me that it (the house) will "devote itself to you interests—literary and financial," and "be willing to make any reasonable arrangement with you that you may wish," as well as look after my books that are now "in the hands of the receiver of Harper &amp; Brothers." This of course is confidential, as I am upon very friendly terms with Mr. Page. What I do want to know is the standing, financial and otherwise, of the new firm. Indeed, I thank you very much for your willingness to serve the new book. If I do not give it to the Messrs. Harper, I shall certainly be only to[o] glad to have you do what you can for me—though as I know Mr. Page personally of course it will not be courteous for me to send anyone else to consult with him. As for the others—Macmillan, Scribners, &amp; the rest, I should like to learn their attitude with regard to my work. At any rate, the novel goes to Mr. Heinemann, through you, as did the other. It is a book about Virginia, &amp; so vastly different from my former works, that I suppose it will both please and disappoint. It is not historical in the conventional sense, &amp; it is not romantically exciting, but it is a good, sound, solid, true-to-life kind of novel. I am afraid I shan't be in New York this winter—I am working too hard, and the weather here is too glorious to forego. Thanking you for your letter, I am, Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 24. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | January 1, 1900 My dear Mr. Reynolds : I have been ill or your letter should have been answered before this. Even now I am not able to reply to it in full, but send a line to let you know that I shall do so later. Perhaps it is as well to let things remain as they are until the book is finished. I am at present unequal to the work of completing it, so it may not be ready to soon as I expected. Thanking you for your letters, I am, Very sincerely, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 25. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | February 26, 1900 My dear Mr. Reynolds : The book is with Doubleday and McClure 1 —and in the printer's hands, they write me. When I came to the point, I gave the novel (as I always do) to the publisher who seemed most interested in my work. Will you please be so kind as to secure proof sheets from them to send to Mr. Heinemann. Mr. Page writes me that he thinks this book much the strongest I have done. He will publish it at once, but, I believe it would be well to have Mr. Heinemann hold it over until the tour is ended. In a letter I had from Mr. Heinemann a few days ago, he mentioned that he was leaving London for six weeks—however I don't suppose the proofs will be ready for him for some little while. When you write to him will you suggest that he should hold the book over? With kind regards, Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 26. One West Main Street | [ Richmond, Va. ] | March 8, 1900 Dear Mr. Reynolds : Do you know whether Doubleday &amp; McClure are sending you corrected proofs of my book or not? The Harpers did so &amp; it saved me a great deal of trouble, as it would be almost impossible for me to make the same changes in the second set unless I had the first to go by. I forgot to mention this when I wrote before, but if the corrected ones are sent it will make a great deal of difference to me. Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 27. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | March 21, 1900 My dear Mr. Reynolds : Thank you a thousand times. I could not understand what was meant by the omission of "United States of America," which I suppose was an oversight. I have sent the contract you were so kind as to copy for me—there must be no mistake about the English rights. I suppose I may have been wrong in not asking for an advance royalty (I was offered $500 in advance on the last book—but I have an absurd presentiment (the only superstition I entertain) that if I take any advance, I shall never get any more from the book. This of course is ridiculous. At any rate I am very much obliged to you. If this book makes the impression of [. . .] 1 that I think it will, would it be possible—do you think?—to place my next as a serial. I can't hold a book over for a serial, but I should like to have it start in a magazine as soon as it is finished—say in from two to three years. It is not begun as yet, but I have the plot—and it will be laid before &amp; during the late war. 2 Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 28. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | April 17, 1900 My dear Mr. Reynolds : I have asked my American publishers to take charge of the English rights. As they have a representative on the spot this seems to me to be much better than to make you deal through a third party. I was greatly surprised at Mr. Heinemann's decision—I had thought he cared to have it—but no matter. I suppose it will all come right. I am much obliged to you for your trouble. If you were in London I should like to have you place it, but since you are not, will you kindly turn it over to Mr. MacArthur. Very sincerely yours. Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 29. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | April 19, 1900 My dear Mr. Reynolds : It never occurred to me to think that you had been anything but kind and helpful to me, and I am very sorry that you don't like my giving the book to Doubleday and Page. It seems to me that I have done the right thing in so doing. I gathered from your letter that you were doubtful about being able to place it, and I confess that I was amazed at Mr. Heinemann's refusal. All of this seemed to consider my book of slight value—and this is not my opinion at all. The same mail brought me an enthusiastic letter from my American publishers, and, in a way, they are responsible for the well-being of my novel. You are not in London, as I said before, and your letter certainly left me under the impression that it might be difficult to arrange matters. It seemed to me that I was merely taking a troublesome piece of business out of your hands. I do not regret what I have done, but I regret very much if it has offended you. You have been most kind about advising me, and I hope you understand that I appreciate this. The question of the amount charged has nothing whatever to do with my decision. I am quite willing to abide by my arrangements with Doubleday, Page, and Company, which will yield quite as much if not more, than fifteen per cent. Indeed, if you have been at any expense about the book that I can make good, I shall esteem it a favour if you will let me know of it. Believe me, Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 30. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | May 20, 1900 May dear Mr. Reynolds, I do not know whether there is any foundation for the news you have received from London or not. So far I have heard nothing on the subject from the publishers. And indeed, if it is so I am neither glad nor sorry. There are perhaps twenty publishers in London whom I should like to have this book quite as much as I would like Mr. Heinemann to have it. It really makes very little difference to me who brings out the book. However, I thank you for your letter, and I am Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 31. The Glen Springs | Watkins, N. Y. | January 1, 1905 1 My dear Mr. Reynolds : Messrs. Archibald Constable and Company are my regular English publishers, and for some years all of my arrangements for the British rights of my books have been made by Mr. A. P. Watt. Yes. I have a novel to be published in January, but it has been placed for two years or more. It was very kind of you, though, to write me of this opportunity. Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 32. Hotel Royal | Grande Bretagne &amp; Arno | Florence | May 7, 1910 Dear Mr. Reynolds , Your April letter went to Constantinople &amp; has just reached me. I am much interested in the serial you speak of and I should like to talk it over with you when I return to New York in June. My address on this side is in care Messrs.

      <field name="fulltext">Letter 33. Hotel Seville | Madison Avenue &amp; 29th Street | New York | June 7, [1910] Dear Mr. Reynolds , I am in town for a few days—and hope to see you while I am here and talk about the serial. Can you come over Friday about three o'clock—or would Wednesday suit you better? 1 Sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 34. One West Eighty-fifth Street | [ New York, N. Y. ] | November 22, 1911 Dear Mr. Reynolds , I haven't anything new I could possibly use as a serial. My new novel won't be finished for at least two years. 1 Of course, if I could get a good price for that from a first straight [ sic ] magazine, I wouldn't refuse to consider it. But it's a big book, a long book, a serious book. It's going to be I think really my best book. Sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow I've moved to New York for the winter, you know.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 35. One West Eighty-fifth Street | [ New York, N. Y. ] | January 19, 1912 Dear Mr. Reynolds , You have written to me so often about the serialization of my books, that I would like to discuss the matter with you some day when you are at leisure. 1 Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 36. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | May 9, 1913 Dear Mr. Reynolds : No, I am sure I did not get the letter you wrote me in January. As for short stories—well, I've tried hard to interest myself in them, but simply can't. The work is so tiresome that I'd rather not have the money they bring than try to write them. If a serial could be well placed before the book is written, that would be very nice, but after the work is finished, I never want to have it back long enough to search out a place for it. Sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 37. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | July 1, 1916 My dear Mr. Reynolds : You have asked me so often about short stories that I am wondering if there happens to be any particular demand for them just now. I am writing a story about a haunted house, 1 and I should like to get the largest possible price for it. Of course I cannot let my work appear in the second rate magazines; but could you give me some idea of the price you think you can get from a good magazine? 2 Very truly yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 38. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | November 26, 1916 My dear Mr. Reynolds : I shall be very glad to have you place the next story I write. Those that I have written are already sold; but I realize that you might secure larger prices than I am able to do. The Editors of Harper's Magazine are anxious for other stories from me; but they do not pay as much as I wish to ask. I do not care to take less than a thousand dollars (Good Housekeeping paid me this for one 1 the other day) and I should like, if possible, to get more. Of course the standing of the magazine must count somewhat. Very truly yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 39. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | January 5, 1917 My dear Mr. Reynolds , I have finished the story, 1 and I hope to send it to you before long. It is a ghost story, not unlike my story in the Christmas Scribner's. Please get me the largest price you possibly can—even if it has to go to the Cosmopolitan. I couldn't appear in Hearst's Magazine or in some others. Sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 40. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | February 22, 1917 My dear Mr. Reynolds , No. I haven't any story for the Ladies' Home Journal . Will you let me know if you have shown this story to any one else? I would rather have it appear in one of the first class magazines even if I take a smaller price—but I would like to sell it as soon as possible. Have you spoken to the editor of the Century ? I cannot understand the delay for I sold my other stories within a week. Very sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow I much prefer that this story should not come out in a woman's magazine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter 41. One West Main Street | Richmond, Virginia | November 28, 1930 My dear Mr. Reynolds : Thank you for your letter. No, I am sorry, but I am not interested in serials, and certainly an offer of twenty thousand dollars would not tempt me. With best wishes, I am Sincerely yours, Ellen Glasgow</field>

Lane never published any of her work. 1 An undated, unaddressed note appears to have been enclosed with Letter 12: "In the 3rd line on page 238 of the corrected proofs, I find a slight mistake which alters the sense of the words. The sentence, 'I have not one voter , but dozens,' was originally written, 'I have not one vote, but dozens.' Will you kindly see that this word 'voter' is changed to 'vote'." All of these changes were made for the English edition with the exception of one. "Fire-escape," which appears on page 43, line 12 of the Harper and Brothers edition, appears as "fire escape" on page 42, line 25 of the Heinemann edition. "Fire-escape" on page 14, line 14 of the Harper and Brothers edition was altered to "small iron balcony" on page 13, line 33 of the Heinemann edition. "I have not one vote, but dozens" appears in both the English and American editions (Harper and Brothers, page 238; Heinemann, page 228). "Gotten" appears as "got" in both the English and American editions. 1 Almost illegible handwriting makes the reading of this sentence uncertain. 1 The Heinemann edition was not printed from the Harper plates. 1 The Freeman and Other Poems , published in August, 1902. 1 The Voice of the People .

As Letter 28 shows, Heinemann refused this novel, which was published in England by Constable. 1 The letter appears to be misdated. The Wheel of Life , the novel referred to, was published in January, 1906. 1 The discussion was about the possible serialization of The Miller of Old Church , and the next day Reynolds wrote the following memorandum for his files: June 8, 1910 MISS ELLEN GLASGOW: She is working on a new novel, as I understand something like 40 chapters. She thinks she would give me 25 sometime in the summer. I told her the sooner the better. McClure and the American both asked to see it. I told her I thought I could place it. It is a story dealing with the new life in the south and the people who are coming up. There is no problem in it. She thinks there might be too much atmosphere and characterization to make it a good serial but thought it could be cut and condensed. Moffat Yard offered $2500 advance, and I think they would pay $3000 for a book. She said she was really committed to Doubleday, and apparently has made a contract with them to give them all of her books, so I didn't mention this offer. Moffat Yard thinks her books except the Battleground sold about 15000 copies. P. R. R. [Over the words "the Battleground" Reynolds pencilled: "about 30,000"] 1 Virginia , published 1913. 1 On January 25, Reynolds made the following note on Virginia: Ellen Glasgow is working on a story of a woman's life down south since the war, her love affair, marriage, divorce and so forth. She doesn't expect it will be finished for at least a year and probably not published before two years. It is going to be an analytical story, and she thinks it is going to be something like 150,000 words. She is going to communicate with me a year from now and let me know how the story then is and I am to see if it can be sold. I told her I thought it was useless to mention it now, when it would be so long before it was completed.

      <field name="heading_text">THE Grammaticæ Artis Institutio of Joannes Susenbrotus: A Bibliographical Note by Joseph X. Brennan</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In spite of the growing recognition of the important contribution of Joannes Susenbrotus (1485/6-1542) 1 to 16th-century learning, 2 the bibliographical information concerning his publications is still extremely scant and very much confused. Most confused of all is the publication history of his Grammaticœ Artis Institutio , a Latin grammar widely used and distributed in its day. As Susenbrotus relates in the dedicatory epistle to the first and second revisions of this work, he had begun many years earlier a haphazard compilation of material from the grammars of Priscian, Diomedes and others; this compendium he then began to teach and dictate to his students. 3 After some fifteen years of such experimentation, he finally submitted the compendium for publication. The first edition and the original version of the Grammaticœ Artis Institutio , which survives today in only a few copies, reads on the title-page as follows: 4 "Grammaticae Artis Institutio per Joannem Susenbrotum, Ravenspurgi ludimagistrum ex Grammaticorum Coryphæis accurate concinnata." No date or place of publication appears on the title-page, but the date of this edition is accurately fixed on fol. 88r, where the section on syntax ends with the notation, "Valete Ravenspurgi. Kal. Jan. An. M.D. XXXV" (January 1, 1535). Of this first printed version of the grammar there was apparently only the one edition. Although the book is without imprint, a preliminary study of the type indicates that it was very probably printed by Christopher Froschauer of Zürich, the publisher of both later revisions of the Grammaticœ , as well as two other textbooks compiled by Susenbrotus. 5 In the first revision of this grammar—considerably expanded and heavily indebted in both form and content to the grammar of the English humanist, Thomas Linacre 6 —the title is also considerably extended: "Grammaticae Artis Institutio per Joannem Susenbrotum Ravenspurgi ludimagistrum ex Grammaticorum Coryphæis iam denuo accurate concinnata, à mendis item repurgata, ac multis etiam in locis citra Lectoris fastidiu locùpletata." No date appears on the title-page of this revised edition either, but the dedicatory epistle closes with a misprinted date which has frequently misled those who have had to deal with it: "Vale optima indole adolescens, Rauěspurgi octavo Kalědas Iulij. Anno à Christi seruatoris nostri natali 1518. Aetatis meæ anno 54" (fol. 6r). The year of this volume's appearance, however, we can determine quite accurately by comparing certain of its statements with those found in other Susenbrotus publications. In the dedication, for example, Susenbrotus stated that he was then in his 54th year; since we know from the Epitome Troporum ac Schematum that he was in his 56th year on March 5, 1541, and from the Methodus octo partium orationis that he was in his 57th year on July 31, 1542, 7 it is clear that Susenbrotus must have completed the dedication to the first recension of the Grammaticœ on June 24 ("octauo Kalědas Iulij") of 1539, in order to have been in his 54th year at the time. This date can be confirmed further by a collation of information, respecting Susenbrotus' years of service as a teacher, which appears in all of his texts. In the last paragraph of the 1535 edition of the Grammaticœ , first of all, Susenbrotus stated that he had already endured the trials and tribulations of the classroom for 28 years ("ipse qui duo de triginta iam annos, phrontisterii sordes, molestias, ac curas pertuli"); in the first revision of this grammar the figure is changed to 32: "Ego ipse, qui duos &amp; triginta iam annos, etc." The introduction to the Epitome (1541), moreover, states that he was then in the 35th year of his "scholastic administration"; and the dedicatory epistle of the Methodus (1542) indicates that he was in the 36th year of his "scholastic function." It should be noted here that the figures which appear in the grammar, "duo de triginta" and "duo &amp; triginta," were reckoned in terms of years already completed ("iam . . . pertuli"), whereas the figures in the Epitome and Methodus include the year already in progress. We know from the dedicatory epistle found in both revisions of the Grammaticœ , furthermore, that Susenbrotus had begun his teaching career in 1506 ("anno minoris numeri sexto")—a career which was interrupted for a year in 1521-1522, while he studied for his M. A. at the University of Basel. 8 However improbable such an error, all the evidence nevertheless points unequivocally to the fact that 1518 was a misprint for 1539. On the title-page of this second version of the text, finally, appears the characteristic device of Christopher Froschauer, a willow (?) tree with a number of frogs ( Frosch , in German) below. By some strange oversight, the misprint of 1518 for 1539 was left uncorrected in the second revised form, also, even though the author assures us on the title-page of this third version of the text that he had not only added notations in the margin but made useful corrections in the text as well: "Grammaticae Artis Institutio per Joannem Susenbrotum Rauenspurgi ludimagistrum ex Grammaticorum Coryphaeis iam tertium recognita, additis et in contextu et in margine haud aspernandis." In the interval between the publication of the first and second revised texts, Susenbrotus certainly detected or had brought to his attention the gross misprint in his introduction, but why it was allowed to remain or how it could possibly have been overlooked a second time remains a mystery. The date of the first publication of the third version of the Grammaticœ we can establish as definitely later than September 1, 1540, and perhaps before November 21 of the same year, by means of the marginal commentary concerning his home town, Wangen im Allgäu, mentioned in the text (40v-41r): 9 "Anno 1539 2. Septemb. inter octavam &amp; novam ante meridium a latrone ac incendiario crudelissimo totum fere Vulcano dicatum est, qui sequente anno in monasterio Marchtal ad Danubium sito meritas luit poemas." Matters are somewhat complicated here by the additional misprint of 1530 for 1539 in both the University of Chicago and University of Illinois copies; in another edition of this recension, however, the year is given as 1539, 10 the date which is verified in contemporary records. 11 From these records we learn that the culprit who set fire to the city was indeed apprehended at Marchtal on September 1, 1540, and executed soon thereafter. From the same source we are also informed that on November 21, 1540, Wangen suffered from an equally disastrous fire which destroyed whatever had escaped the conflagration of the year before. 12 It seems likely, therefore, that had Susenbrotus written this marginal note after the date of the second burning, that fact too would have been noted in some way. It is rather unlikely, in any event, that this final form of the text was prepared later than 1540, since in the year and a half before his death in 1542 Susenbrotus was furiously busy with other matters; in this short space of time, in addition to performing his many duties as schoolmaster, he edited with scholia and other information the Scholae Christianae Epigrammatum Libri duo (1541), compiled the Epitome Troporum ac Schematum (1541), and composed both a Methodus octo partium orationis (1542) and a combined Latin and Greek grammar, which had been prepared for publication before his death but was never printed. 13 Of this third form of the text of the Grammaticœ Artis Institutio there were at least two undated and five dated editions. 14 Of the two undated editions, that which carries the correct date 1539 in the margin of fol. 40v is undoubtedly the earlier and very probably the first edition, sometime late in 1540. Since another Zürich edition of this recension was dated 1544, it is most likely that the second of the undated editions appeared sometime between these two dates, 1540 and 1544. Thereafter the Grammaticœ was reprinted at Lyons in 1556 15 and at Zürich in 1558 and 1565. There is record also of a final edition in 1570, presumably at Zürich by Froschauer, who issued another of the many editions of Susenbrotus' Epitome in this same year. All told, then, there were three distinct versions of the Grammaticœ Artis Institutio in the lifetime of Susenbrotus: the first in 1535, the second in 1539, and the third most probably in late 1540 or early 1541 at the latest. From information that is by no means complete, moreover, it is fairly certain that of this third form there were at least seven different editions between 1540 and 1570.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Although no records have yet been found which indicate the exact date of Susenbrotus' birth, from information found in his works we can nevertheless restrict the time of that event to the period between August 1, 1485, and March 5, 1486. The preface to his Epitome Troporum ac Schematum , for example, closes with the notice: "Rauenspurgi ex museolo nostro 5 Martii Anno humanitatis Christi reconciliatoris nostri [15]41. Scholicae administrationis 35. Aetatis meae 56." At the end of the dedicatory epistle to the Methodus octo partium orationis , appears this information: "Ex Ravenspurgo ultima Iulii. Anno domini quadragesimo secundo. Aetatis meae 57. Scholicae functionis 36." From records in the archives of Ravensburg, furthermore, we learn that Susenbrotus died a short time after being struck and mortally wounded by a drunken cooper in 1542. 2 For an account of Susenbrotus' influence upon the classroom in England, see T. W. Baldwin's William Shakspere's Small Latine &amp; Lesse Greeke (1944), vols. 1 and 2 passim, and particularly pp. 138-175 of vol. 2. For an account of his influence in Germany, see the Geschichte des humanistischen Schulwesens in Württemburg (1912-1920), vols. 1-4 passim. 3 ". . . Compendium Grammatices, ex Prisciano, Diomede &amp; aliis tumultuanter collectum, pueris dictabam. . ." 4 My discussion of this edition is based upon photostats of a copy preserved in the Universitätsbibliothek, Tübingen. 5 With no more than photographic reprints of the title-pages to judge by at the moment, I nevertheless feel fairly certain that a more detailed study of the various types which appear in the 1535 and 1539 editions of the Grammaticœ would bear out my present opinion that several of the types are not only identical in style and from the same font, but even from the same cases. Particularly striking is the fact that on the lower right stem of the first M of the word Grammaticœ there appears an identical defect, a fine fissure slanting downwards from right to left, in both editions. 6 The fact of this indebtedness is directly acknowledged in another version of this title, found in Conrad Gesner's Bibliotheca Universalis, sive Catalogus omnium scriptorum (Zürich: Christopher Froschauer, 1545): "Grammaticæ artis partium omnium integra institutio ex Grammaticorum coryphaeis cum alijs pluribus, tum praecipue Thoma Linacro, iam denuo accurate concinnata, emendata, &amp; citra Lectoris fastidium locupletata." 7 See footnote 1 for the Latin text of this information. 8 See the matriculation entry in Die Matrikel der Universität Basel (Basel, 1951), Band I 1460-1529, ed. Hans Georg Wackernagel, p 348. 9 Fol. 40v of the University of Illinois and University of Chicago copies mentioned below. 10 In his brief but valuable study, "Hans Susenbrot, ein verschollener schwäbischer Humanist und lateinischer Schulmeister" ( Diözesanarchiv von Schwaben , Stuttgart, 1907, pp. 8-12), P. Fox, S. J., quotes this marginal from a copy in the library of the Jesuit college at Feldkirch which shows the correct date, 1539. The British Museum copy and a copy in the archives of Ravensburg also have the correct date, 1539. 11 See pp. 383-384 of Gerwig Blarer Abt von Weingarten 1520-1567 , vol. I, edited by Heinrich Günter, Stuttgart, 1914. 12 Ibid. , p. 395. 13 Gesner, op. cit. , lists among the works of Susenbrotus: "Rudimenta Latinae &amp; Graecae Grammatiæ simul coniuncta, nondum impressa." 14 These conclusions are based upon information obtained from German libraries through the Öffentliche Wissenschaftliche Bibliothek in Berlin. 15 Listed in the catalog of the Bibliothèque Nationale, vol. 180, col. 790.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Lydgate's Serpent of Division , 1559, Edited by John Stow by William Ringler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Studies in Bibliography , VIII (1956), 215-217, I suggested that the phrases "newly collected by I. S." in the 1568 Workes of maister Skelton , and "published by I. S." in the 1597 Certaine Worthye Manuscript Poems , indicated the editorship of the antiquary John Stow. Professor Franklin B. Williams, Jr., thereupon suggested to me privately that STC 17028 might also have been edited by Stow. This is titled, "The serpent of diuision. Whych hathe euer bene yet the chefest vndoer of any Region or Citie, set forth after the Auctours old copy by I. S. Anno .M.D.L.IX. the .iiii. of May", concludes, "Thus endeth this litle treatise entituled: the Serpent of diuision, made by Iohn Lydgate", and has as colophon, "Imprinted at London by Owen Rogers dwelling in Smithfielde by the Hospital in litle S. Bartelmewes". The Serpent of Division , composed in 1422, is Lydgate's only known prose work, being attributed to him by name in the Calthorpe MS and the Rogers print. It was edited in 1911 for the Oxford University Press by H. N. MacCracken from the Fitzwilliam MS, with citation of a few selected variants, too scanty to be of use in determining textual relationships, from the Calthorpe, Pepys and Harvard MSS and the Treverys and Rogers prints. A fifth MS, formerly Ashburnham Appendix 128 and now British Museum Additional 38179, which MacCracken mentioned (p. 45) but had not seen, is an early eighteenth-century transcript of the Pepys MS. The fragment of the last four leaves of the earlier Treverys edition, not listed in the STC but reprinted in full by Joseph Haslewood in Censura Literaria , IX (1809), 369-373, has the colophon, "Thus endeth this lyttle treatyse entytuled the Damage and destruccyon in Realmes. Newly and of late Enprynted by Peter Treuerys. Dwellynge at London in Southwarke, at the sygne of the Wodowes". Treverys printed from 1521 to 1535. So far as can be determined from MacCracken's apparatus, Treverys appears to have followed a MS similar to the Fitzwilliam; though either Treverys or his source slightly rephrased and modernised Lydgate's text. Thus where MacCracken (p. 64 line 20) indicates that the four substantive MSS read "Ano th er prodigie", Treverys reads "An other maruelous sygne or prodygy"; the MSS (line 24) "toforne", Treverys "before"; and the MSS (line 31) "smete", Treverys "smyten". MacCracken (p. 47) suggested that the 1559 Rogers edition "seems to derive from the Treverys print, with possible reference to earlier MSS. The title, Serpent of Division , is probably derived from the title of Treverys which is lost." That the Treverys edition was used as copy by Rogers is proved by their identity of wording and their agreement in error against the MSS. For example the MSS (p. 64 line 26) read "Vincent in his historiall meroure", where Treverys has "Vnyce n t in his hystoryall boke" and Rogers, "Vnicent in hys hystoriall bookes". But I find no evidence to support MacCracken's suggestion that Rogers's editor, I. S., made textual changes by referring to earlier MSS. Complete collation of Haslewood's reprint of the Treverys fragment with Rogers reveals only 14 verbal variants, all errors, changes, or obvious corrections of a kind commonly made independently by early printers. For example, Rogers reads "a feminiue" for Treverys's "femynyne", "vnclose" for "enclose", and "Pompey" for "Pomney". A third sixteenth-century edition, STC 17029, has the title-page: The Serpent of Deuision. Wherein is conteined the true History or Mappe of Romes ouerthrowe, gouerned by Auarice, Enuye, and Pride, the decaye of Empires be they neuer so sure. Three thinges brought ruine vnto Rome, that ragnde in Princes to their ouerthrowe: Auarice, and Pride, with Enuies cruell doome, that wrought their sorrow and their latest woe. England take heede, such chaunce to thee may come: Fœlix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum. Whereunto is annexed the Tragedye of Gorboduc, sometime King of this Land, and of his two Sonnes, Ferrex and Porrex. Set foorth as the same was shewed before the Queenes most excellent Maiesty, by the Gentlemen of the Inner Temple. At London Printed by Edward Allde for Iohn Perrin, and are to be sold in Paules Church yard, at the signe of the Angell. 1590. The text of this edition has been extensively rephrased and modernised. MacCracken (p. 47) said that "Allde followed Rogers, in setting forth his copy", though he did not cite any readings to substantiate his statement; but he was mistaken, for collation reveals clearly that Allde followed the earlier edition of Treverys. For example, in a verse quotation Treverys reads, "Wha n many a regyon he had brought full low", which was too long for the larger font of type used by Rogers, who in order to avoid running over the line omitted a word and printed "when many a region he had broght lov"; but Allde printed the earlier reading of Treverys, "When many a Region he had brought full lowe". Since Allde took his text from Treverys, he probably also reproduced his title-page, which substantiates MacCracken's suggestion that the lost Treverys title-page was headed, "The Serpent of Deuision", even though his colophon described the work as "the Damage and destrucyon in Realmes". It is significant that neither Treverys nor Allde name the author of the treatise. Only Rogers's edition, "set forth after the Auctours old copy by I. S.", contains the information that it was "made by Iohn Lydgate". Actually I. S. did not use "the Auctours old copy" for his text, but merely reproduced the Treverys print; so that his only editorial contribution was the addition of the name of the author. John Stow had a life-long interest in the works of Lydgate. He owned or made copies of many Lydgate manuscripts, appended Lydgate's Siege of Thebes to his 1561 edition of Chaucer, and contributed an extensive bibliography of Lydgate's writings, in which "The serpent of diuision" is listed, to Speght's 1598 edition of Chaucer (sig. Zzz6 v ).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Note on the Printing of E. K.'s Glosses by Jack Stillinger</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In their frequent conjectures on revision in The Shepheardes Calender scholars have not fully exploited the well-known disorder of E. K.'s glosses for evidence. The disarrangement of the five hundred or so notes, identical in the five quartos printed before Spenser's death, was retained "in all preceding editions except perhaps Herford's" until tidily "corrected, and . . . made more convenient" in the Variorum Edition of The Minor Poems (I, 231). On good grounds one may urge that, in scholarly editions, at least, the old order continue to be printed. Of the two dozen irregularities (including two glossed words not in the texts of the eclogues) more than half are simple reversals of glosses to words occurring in the same or adjacent lines of poetry, or rearrangements of short glosses printed together in a single line in the first quarto. 1 They are often accountable as attempts by the printer to balance his page and save space, or simply as instances of a genial lack of fastidiousness on his part or that of E. K. In any case, since the glosses occur near their proper places (it should be remembered that neither the lines in the eclogues nor the glosses were numbered), these "errors" of order would have caused early readers no trouble. If they may be discounted, there remain only five or six discrepancies of arrangement that are not readily, even conjecturally, explainable: "Sere" ( Jan. 37) is glossed between "Stoure" (51) and "His clownish gyfts" (57); "Coronall" ( Feb. 178) and "Flouret" (182) between "O my liege" (150) and "The Primrose" (166); "For thy" ( Mar. 37) between "Ascaunce" (21) and "Lethe" (23); and "Euer among" ( Dec. 112) and "Thus is my" (97) in that order between "Scathe" (100) and "The fragraunt flowres" (109). For lack of a better course, we must call these printer's errors. Still other peculiarities, however, offer possible evidence of revision in the poems. One such instance, though not concerning errors of order, is well known. C. H. Herford, T. P. Harrison, and R. B. Botting, of those cited in the Variorum Minor Poems (I, 339, 349, 614), have inferred from the absence of glosses to the August sestina and the stanzas framing it that the sestina was a late addition, "an after-thought." The passage represents 57 lines untouched by E. K.; the next longest unglossed span (in January ) is 26 lines long, and other sizable gaps are considerably shorter. There is a good chance that Spenser added Cuddie's "doole" (and mention of it in the Argument) after the glosses were written, possibly because he felt that the singing match was not good enough to carry the eclogue by itself. Where disorder appears, however, E. K.'s notes have been treated cavalierly. The glosses to the words not occurring in the text have not been sufficiently commented on. For "Bett," which appears in the July glosses between "Melling" (208) and "Bynempte" (214), the Variorum editors supply in the "Critical Notes on the Text" (I, 718): "[ July ] 230. Herford. E. K.'s Gloss makes it almost certain that Spenser wrote 'bett,' though 'better' is the reading of all the editions. And that the change to 'better' was not due to Spenser himself is clear. For it produces an anapaestic verse, of which there is no other example in the Eclogue; and Spenser did not avoid the form 'bett' (cf. Oct. 15)." But Herford is partly wrong about the metrics. The first three feet of "This had a brother, (his name I knewe)" ( July 161) are rhythmically identical with "but shall be better in time" (230); and one can just as easily read "but shall be bett'r in time" as "They bene yclad in purpl' and pall" (173) or "Now sick'r I see, thou doest but clatter" (207). That is, while Herford may be right in thinking Spenser wrote "bett" in line 230, his hasty reasoning must be rejected. For "Soote," glossed in September between "Lorne" (57) and "Vncouthe" (60), the Variorum editors twice observe (I, 365, 719) that the word is "not in the text," and in summarizing an article by R. B. Botting they refer to it (I, 614) as an indication of Spenser's "hurry." But some further, more specific comment is called for, and they could have expanded with Botting's own words ( PMLA , L [1935], 434): "It would appear [from this gloss] that in at least one instance Spenser removed a passage after the explanatory notes were composed." It may be noted that both July and September are among the moral eclogues, "which for the most part be mixed with some Satyrical bitternesse," and that late revision in the form of deleting overbold statements, especially after the persecution of John Stubbe and his and Spenser's printer Hugh Singleton in October 1579, would not be surprising. The final evidence to be gleaned from the arrangement of E. K.'s notes lies in the patterned disorder of the glosses to the April "laye of fayre Elisa ." The glosses to lines 92, 99, 73, 82, 86 (in that order) are printed between the glosses to lines 136 and 145. The pattern—lines 92 and 99 occur in one stanza not connected in thought with the preceding or succeeding stanzas, and lines 73, 82, 86 occur in two stanzas that are connected with each other but not with those on either side—may suggest that these stanzas were originally grouped in the order in which E. K. treats them, just before the last stanza of the song. The phrase "decked as thou art" (145), linking the last stanza with the preceding one in the text as we now have it, could easily have been substituted for another phrase ending in "art" if Spenser did make the change. Any instance of disorder or other irregularity in the glosses must be conjecturally explained as E. K.'s error, as the printer's error (in handling either the glosses or the text of the poems), or as evidence of revision by Spenser. Of the "errors" just discussed, the disorder of "Bett" is probably attributable to the printer, who may well have put its gloss on the same line with two other short ones ("Bynempte," 214, "Gree," 215) to avoid printing the tiny explanation by itself after the two-line gloss to "Algrin" (219: see below). If the disorder may thus be explained, it seems reasonable to accept the editors' correction of "better" to "bett" in line 230 of the eclogue. The instance of "Soote," however, is not easily explained as error by either E. K. or the printer, nor is the patterned disorder of the glosses to April . If we could accept E. K.'s date of 10 April 1579 for the completion of the glosses, and the Stationers' Register entry of 5 December 1579 as a date for the completion of printing, then we could urge on slightly better grounds than one finds in the Variorum that Spenser revised his work between those dates, possibly when he was in London in October, "minded for a while to haue intermitted the vttering of my writings" (Variorum Prose Works , p. 5). While I would be the first to urge that these considerations are only further speculation, I think they offer reason for saying that the Variorum editors should have retained the original order of E. K.'s glosses, or at least recorded the "errors" in the "Variant Readings" or the "Critical Notes on the Text" (they scrupulously note [I, 698] that the gloss to "Ouerhaile," Jan. 75, is wrongly printed after the heading "Embleme"). As it is, in correcting the order of the glosses they have introduced new disorder, wrongly assigning the gloss to "There" ( July 65) to line 63 of the eclogue and rearranging it to appear before "The Shepheard" (64) —and they have shown poor judgment in two other corrections of order. In January they reverse the glosses to "Rosalinde" and "I loue" (61): the "Rosalinde" gloss explains an entire stanza (61-66) rather than the specific mention of her name in line 60, and it need not have been moved. In assigning "Algrin" to July 213 they make a similar mistake: the gloss clearly refers to " Algrins ill" (219), the "myshap" described by Spenser in lines 217-228.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Guide-Lines in Small Formats (about 1600) by Giles E. Dawson</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Printed fragments recently recovered from an old binding in the Folger Library (MS. V.a.213) reveal a printinghouse practice that appears, not surprisingly, to have escaped the notice of bibliographers. They are the first two half-sheets (A and B) of a 24to Book of Common Prayer printed between 1602 and 1631. The bound manuscript is a heraldic compilation of such matter and in such a manner as is most probably attributable to a professional herald. The whole of the writing, or nearly the whole, can with some confidence be assigned, from internal evidence, to the years 1603 and 1604. The style of the binding is right for the earliest decades of the century, but unfortunately we cannot know whether the sheets were bound before or after the writing of the manuscript. The binder, following a practice common then (as now, among hand binders), lined both sides of his two boards with strong but thin paper. For this he used the two half-sheets of printer's waste—a half-sheet for each board. Apparently it was after he lined them that he cut the boards down to the right size, trimming all four edges. Thus each half-sheet is in two equal pieces and each piece has had all of its edges so cut away that sixteen of its pages have lost some ten lines of text at the bottom of each (together with whatever signatures and catchwords they bore) and the other eight have lost a horizontal band through the middle that contained about eight lines of text (about 1.7 cm.). I estimate that the original size of the ruled type-page was close to 9.7 x 4.1 cm. and of the whole sheet about 48 x 33 cm. (19 x 13.5 inches). The title-page (A1) having lost its imprint, the date can only be inferred. Luckily a clue has survived. On the verso of the title-page is printed "An Almanacke for 30. yeeres", beginning with 1602 and lacking the ten years after 1621. These almanacs, then printed in virtually every Book of Common Prayer, were reprinted from year to year without being brought up to date, so that they usually lead off with a number of past and useless years. The forty-five-year almanac in STC 16370, for example, begins with 1597 and was thirty years wasted when it was published in 1627. The STC records two editions in twenty-fours between 1602 and 1631— STC 16331 (1606), represented by a single copy in the Bodleian, and STC 16346 (1615), a single copy in the British Museum. The newly-found fragments do not correspond with either. Miss A. O. Donovan, of the British Museum, to whom I sent a photostat, tells me that while the title and certain other preliminary pages of the 1615 edition were printed from a different setting of type, the thirty-year almanac and the monthly almanac appear to have been printed from the same setting as those of the Folger fragments. She cogently adds that this use of standing type suggests dates not widely separated for the two editions. What we can say of the date of the fragments then is this—that they could not be earlier than 1602, that a date much after 1620 is unlikely, that a date within a year or two of 1615 is more likely than others. We must then favor an opinion that the manuscript was bound years after it was written. Each of the two half-sheets shows an imposition exactly like that of a 12mo sheet. The two could have been printed in either of two ways: as a whole sheet of twenty-fours with two signatures, 1 or by half-sheet imposition. Since a whole sheet of twenty-fours would be too thick for sewing as one unit, it must always, I imagine, have been printed in one way or the other to produce half-sheets. Neither Johnson nor Hansard illustrates any scheme that would not do so. Which of the two methods was used in this Book of Common Prayer there is no way of determining. A sheet of twenty-fours with two signatures in 12's would normally result in one half-sheet with a watermark and one without, and that is just what I find—a watermark, partly torn away, in the outer margins of B9 and B10. When half-sheet imposition is used we cannot have, in one copy of a book, the two half-sheets that originally formed one whole sheet, but in any two successive half-sheets we may find one watermarked and one not. Two watermarks or none in the two halves would tip the balance of probability in favor of half-sheet imposition, but it would do no more, for clear proof could not exist in two detached halves. The printinghouse practice that I speak of in my opening paragraph lies in printed lines whose only conceivable purpose was to indicate where the binder should cut each of the two halves. Following the usage common in English printing of 12mos, the type for these half-sheets was imposed for 12mos by cutting, instead of by folding. One-third of each half-sheet would have to be cut off and separately folded to form the inner four leaves of the gathering. It is this cut that is indicated by the lines printed on each side of each half-sheet. Each line is in two sections, interrupted at the vertical center gutter. Like most rules the eight used here were somewhat bent, especially at the ends. It is not apparent to me why such lines would be needed at all, and why, if they were, they would be needed on both sides of the paper. Surely any binder would have to know how and where to cut a 12mo sheet; nor could he fail to know that a 24to sheet when cut apart became two miniature 12mo sheets. Perhaps—though even this seems to me redundant—the lines were designed to show the binder, not that a cut was to be made or which one-third was to be cut off, but precisely where the cut was to be made in order to produce the desired margins: half as wide at the top as at the bottom. These sheets were of course printed by the King's Printer—probably Barker, possibly (if after 1617) Norton and Bill. We can assume that the printing of the guide-lines was standard practice in at least this one important house. And it is safe further to assume that the lines would possess the same utility in a 12mo as in a 24to and that therefore the King's Printer used them in 12mo printing. And since the printing of the guide-lines, which had to be more or less precisely placed, could not have been as easy as not printing them, their use by one printer suggests some distinct value inherent in the practice which would have led to its general adoption. But if such lines were commonly printed in 12mos and 24tos, why have they not been observed or commented upon before now? This is a question to which I think an answer can be found. In the two prayerbook half-sheets the lines are so printed that any single cut would leave traces of them—because they are not quite straight and because the register is poor. Unless the binder made his cut with greater care than we have any right to expect, even perfectly straight and well-registered lines would leave traces at the bottom edges of $3 and 4, $9 and 10, or at the tops of $5-8. That we do not find them is owing to the fact that we do not find uncut 12mos and 24tos. Uncut edges are repugnant to the bookbinder's concept of what a finished book ought to look like. This was no less true in the seventeenth century than in the present one, and at that time neither collector nor reader seems to have complained very loudly even of losses to sidenotes or headlines, to say nothing of useless uncut edges. 2 The few uncut books that have survived from earlier centuries are for the most part those that were never exposed to the binder's tender care until the age when collectors began to value uncut condition. Most of those few are quartos. Quite aside from the fact that about 1600 approximately half of the books published were quartos, this is the format most likely to be sold—and to be kept—unbound. Unless it was too thick, a quarto was almost always stabbed and stitched and so could be kept unbound. Now and then an octavo was stabbed and stitched, but not often, because the gutters were too narrow. When we get down to 12mos and smaller formats, it is hard for a reader to see down into the valley even when the sheets were folded and sewn with unusual care. Stabbing and stitching would render the book unreadable. These formats were bound, then, before they were read, and from this it follows that they were cut and are therefore quite unlikely to show traces of printed guide-lines at the edges.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Penny-Pinching Printers and Tampered Titles by Franklin B. Williams, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since the titlepage is in some degree the show-window of a book, printers from Elizabethan to Caroline times usually took pains to make it conform to the pattern intended. As a result, cancellation of titlepages was common, whether —among other reasons— to eliminate a misprint, as in the first edition of Ignatius his Conclave , 1611, by John Donne, or simply to substitute a better piece of advertising copy, as in The Period of Mourning , 1613, by Henry Peacham. Once in a while, however, a printer was so intent on economy that he endeavored to patch up a titlepage rather than replace it. This note calls attention to some of these penny-pinching expedients. In one of his lighter moments, Donne himself dashed off a Latin catalogue of amusing imaginary books, a catalogue now available in English as The Courtier's Library . One imaginary book that Donne overlooked may be consulted by the curious at the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris. In an edition printed at London by Thomas Vautrollier in 1577, it is the Commentarius in Epistolam Pauli ad Iacobum of the Danish Scripture scholar Niel Hemmingsen (or Hemmingius in the more familiar Latin form). A glance at the text will satisfy any divinity student as to the true identity of the book, but the bibliographer is concerned rather with the way in which the blunder originated. Luck rather than ratiocination makes it possible to trace the error to careless use of standing type, aggravated by the loss of a paste-over cancel. The book is one of a series of three Hemmingsen commentaries, all unknown to the Short-Title Catalogue but printed by Vautrollier in 1576 and 1577. Copies of all three are in the Bibliothèque Nationale, and doubtless single copies may be traced elsewhere. 1 In presumed order of printing, the three titles are as follows, with the third in both its actual and its intended form (in the originals, diminishing type sizes reverse the pyramid effect): COMMENTARI-VS IN EPISTOLAM PAVLI AD EPHESIOS COMMENTARI-VS IN EPISTOLAM PAVLI AD ROMANOS COMMENTARI-VS IN EPISTOLAM PAVLI AD IACOBUM COMMENTARI-VS IN EPISTOLAM IACOBI APOSTOLI Now Vautrollier was a more responsible and conscientious printer than most, and yet in this instance he apparently balked at cancelling the title-page. Instead he resorted to a one-line paste-over cancel slip. Such paste-over slips exist within the text of books in fascinating variety, but they are rare on Renaissance title-pages —much rarer than on titlepages today, where they supplement or substitute imprints on imported books. The disadvantage of such slips is that with time and wear they may be lost. That is just what happened with some copies of this book. Happily Joseph Ames observed the phenomenon and carefully collected an example in each state. These are preserved today, together with the titles of the other two Hemmingsen items, in the Ames titlepage collection in the British Museum (Vol. I, items 301-304). The freak imperfect state was also preserved by John Bagford, so that the Museum has a second, partly defaced copy (Harl.5936, item 13). The Paris copy shows traces of paste where the slip fell off. An alternative method of amending a titlepage is by over-printing, akin to the process of surcharging in philately and familiar to book buyers nowadays in the price alterations on dust jackets. An unusual Caroline example resulted from doubt about authorship—a technical question that this note will evade. Among the works that the Short-Title Catalogue attributes to the puritan preacher Thomas Hooker is The Christians Two Chiefe Lessons , 1640. In its original form, represented by the copy at Harvard, the titlepage has an inconspicuous statement: "By T. H." Subsequently the bookseller or editor must have had doubts about either the authorship or the copyright, for there is a revised issue, represented by the Harmsworth copy at the Folger Library. Here a pattern of type ornaments is printed over the authorship inscription, effectively camouflaging it. In addition there is a fresh editorial dedication by Z. S., which refers only to "a grave and godly Author." Better known instances of titlepage over-printing, or perhaps hand-stamping, involve the augmentation of imprints, usually the addition of a bookseller's name or a date. The alteration of engraved copperplate titlepages to make the date and edition number fit successive printings is too commonplace for mention, but the combination of engraved titles with paste-over slips may cause bibliographical headaches. This economy was devised by Dutch and Belgian publishers of engraved picture-books, such as Jacob de Gheyn's Exercise of Armes , printed at the Hague in 1607. Alternative printed texts in various languages were provided for the basic sets of plates. Merely for a small English edition the publisher was unwilling to alter his handsome title plate or, heaven forbid, pay for a new one. As a compromise, cancel-slips were printed in the desired language, usually two in number: a larger panel with the title information and a smaller slip with the imprint (which might differ in date as well as wording from the imprint on the plate itself). Subsequent owners have usually kept the title panel intact, but less interest has been shown in the imprint slips. Loss of them results in ghost editions, for careless cataloguers now accept the imprint of the underlying plate. The handsome large-folio Mercator atlas published in English at Amsterdam (the Hexham version competing with the cheaper small-folio Saltonstall version printed in London) is a fine example. The Short-Title Catalogue lists two "editions," and other variants are claimed elsewhere. Yet all the copies I have been able to consult that preserve the imprint slips show a single pattern that in part explains the conflicting descriptions: Volume I dated 1636 and Volume II dated 1638. Expediency reached the stage of fantasy in a small remainder issue perpetrated in 1637 by Humphrey Moseley. This book was James Mabbe's translation of Juan de Santa Maria's Christian Policie , alias Policie Unveiled , which has a tangled bibliography starting in 1632. 2 Moseley obtained sufficient copies of the engraved titlepage of another book, cut out the original oval title panel with great care, and pasted a fresh title panel on the back so that it could be read through the window. One conjectures that this was an attempt to salvage engraved leaves that were either surplus or had been provided for a book never published. The rarity of the 1637 book might mislead one into thinking it a unique freak, since STC lists only the Cambridge University copy (in which the title panel has been clumsily pasted in upside down!). Yet other copies may survive, and certainly there is a duplicate title among the Bagford fragments at the British Museum (Harl.5965, item 43). Furthermore, Moseley made a last effort to dispose of the slow-moving remainder by printing a fresh panel for the same engraved titlepage in 1650. Of this the only recorded copy is in the Library of Congress, showing the same curious window technique. 3</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The Folger Shakespeare Library, for instance, has a copy of the Romans volume. The three Paris copies, which are bound together, must have been brought to my attention by the oracle on STC locations, Prof. William A. Jackson. 2 The original (uncancelled) state of the book, not noted in STC but preserved at the British Museum, has the imprint: T. Harper f. E. Blount, 1632. Blount died the same year. Arthur M. Secord establishes the identity of the translator and provides other information in JEGP , XLVII (1948), 379-381. 3 Any bibliographer determined to clear up the puzzle of this title plate will start with the information given by Secord ( op. cit. ) and by A. F. Johnson, A Catalogue of Engraved English Title-pages (1934), p. 20. By failing to mention the paste-in panel, however, Johnson implies that the plate was engraved for this book. And Secord finds it odd that the original dedication was restored in 1650, whereas of course Moseley simply did not bother to cancel it from the remainder sheets.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The First Edition of Greene's Quip for an Upstart Courtier by I. A. Shapiro *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Only two copies of the first edition of Greene's Quip for an Upstart Courtier (STC 12300) are known to survive: one is in the Bodleian and the other in the Huntington Library. They appear to be identical save in signatures E and F, where important differences are found. A mistaken ordering of these variant readings has obscured the history of the Quip's text. A collation of the two copies has already been printed in Studies in Bibliography 1 and is therefore omitted here, but it is necessary to review fully the variant readings in signatures E and F. It will be convenient to discuss the latter first. In the outer margin of F1, opposite the passage in which Greene asserts that knavish curriers are evading the statute forbidding them to buy leather hides or backs from tanners, the Bodleian copy has the following side-note:- W el sho[uld]/ the lords [of]/ the Coun[cil]/ do to loo[ke]/ to those b[ase]/ knaue s[hoo-]/ makers t[hat]/ ioyne wi[th]/ coosenin[g]/ curriers [a-]/gainst th[eir]/ own com[pa-]/nie to the [vn-]/doing of [ma-]/ny hones[t]/ poore m[en]/ of that tr[ade.] 2 In the Huntington copy this side-note does not appear, but otherwise the setting of the page seems identical with that in the Bodleian copy. Another variant in sig. F occurs on F4v. In the Bodleian copy the last six lines of the page (the last of sheet F) read as follows:- your faults. And for you goodman Baker, you that are co- / sine to Christ in brooking the pillorie as hee did the crosse, / the world cries out of your wilinesse, you craue but one / deere yeare to make your daughter a Gentlewoman, you / buy your corne at the best hand, and yet will not be content / to make your bread weight by many ounces, you put in / The corresponding six lines in the Huntington copy read:- your faults. And as for you goodman Baker, that delight to / be seene where most people resort, euen on the pillory in the / cheefe market place, the world cries out of your wilinesse, / you craue but one dere yere to make your daughter a gen-/ tlewoman, you buy your corne at the best hande, and yet / will not be content to make your bread weight, you put in / The type and setting of the rest of this page are the same in both copies. It should be obvious, though it has not been so, that the Huntington text of F4v is a revision of that found in the Bodleian copy, and that the text was changed to remove the blasphemous comparison of the baker's behaviour in the pillory to that of Christ on the cross. It is astonishing that the version in the Bodleian copy should ever have been set up, let alone printed off and used. There is nothing in this alteration to indicate that the author necessarily had any hand in it; indeed the wording of the revised version suggests rather that the printer or publisher (in this case the same, John Wolfe) was responsible for it. Clearly the first step was to remove the offending words, 'And for you goodman Baker, you that are cosine to Christ in brooking the pillorie as he did the crosse,' and find a substitute of about the same number of letters. It looks as if the printer began by substituting 'And as for you goodman Baker, that delight to be seen where most people resort, euen on the pillory', and, finding himself still left with blank space, added the otiose 'in the cheefe market place'. Having thus overcompensated heavily, he was driven to omit from the last line the much more meaningful phrase 'by many ounces', for he had to end the page with the same words as formerly, 'you put in', so that the opening words of signature G should follow on naturally. His concern on this last point is evidence that at least some substantial portion of signature G was already set up before F4v was altered. There can be no reasonable doubt that Greene's original text is to be found in the Bodleian copy of F4v and that the Huntington's variant must be a revision. There seems every reason to suppose that the side-note found on F1 in the Bodleian copy, but not in the Huntington, was removed at the same time as F4v was revised, since both pages are in the same (outer) forme. The alteration on F4v was evidently made to avoid possible, or rather inevitable, offence. No doubt the same motive accounts for the removal of the side-note on F1. The Lords of the Privy Council might well have been annoyed by Greene's jaunty admonition that they 'should do well to look to' one of their responsibilities. There is little likelihood that the side-note was omitted through some accident in the printing-house. It is much more probable that the prudent publisher, looking over a proof of the outer forme of F, decided to play for safety and remove the side-note from F1 at the same time as he ordered a revision of the blasphemous passage on F4v. For the original text of signature E we have to turn to the Huntington copy, a facsimile of which is now available. 3 This contains, on E3v-E4, the attack on the Harvey brothers which provoked Gabriel Harvey's famous reply in his Foure letters . . . Especially touching Robert Greene . . . 1592. Greene's references to the Harveys fill the last 13½ lines of E3v and the first 8⅓ lines of E4, which also has, in the outer margin, a long side-note designed to make it quite explicit that Richard Harvey and his brothers are here referred to. In the Bodleian copy the original leaves E3-4 have been replaced by a cancel consisting of two conjugate leaves, the contents of which differ substantively from those of the corresponding leaves in the Huntington copy chiefly by omission of the passage about the Harveys and its accompanying side-note. The original leaves are signed 'E3' and 'E4' whereas the cancel is signed 'Eiij' and 'Eiiii', the variation in the numerals conveniently distinguishing them for reference purposes. The omission of the allusion to the Harveys was compensated for largely by resetting the rest of the text into thirty-three lines on 'Eiij' and its verso, into thirty-four on 'Eiiii' and into thirty-five on its verso, as against thirty-seven lines on all the original leaves, and by reducing slightly the length of the lines of type in the new setting. As well as spacing the diminished text more generously, the compositor of the cancel has stretched it further by frequent use of longer spellings such as bee, twoo, dooth, woorthy, manne, writtes, Infourmer, aunsweare . He also inserted many final and some medial e 's, even indulging in the unusual pieece and learge , though otherwise his spellings keep within Elizabethan norms. He has also taken advantage of opportunities to expand abbreviations, changing M. to Maister, 3 to three , &amp; to and (twice) and qd. to quoth (thrice; he unaccountably ignored a fourth opportunity in E4r, l. 26). His substitution of upon for of in 'bestow some odde Angell of Maister infourmer' (E3r, l. 33) may have been prompted by idiomatic considerations as well as by desire to fill more space. More important than the changes so far reported are the textual expansions he permitted himself. These begin in the middle of Eiij v and end at the top of Eiiii v where, presumably, he realized he now had sufficient material to fill the final page of the cancel. His expansions are of interest in several connections, and are therefore given below with their immediate context, the additional matter being italicized; page and line references are to the context in the original version: E3v, ll. 14-15: you may apparently see I am made a curtall, for the Pillory, ( in the sight of a great many good and sufficiente witnesses ,) hath eaten off both my eares, l. 21: with a good crab-tree cudgell E4r, l. 25: but questioned with them of their seuerall occupations. l. 26: the seconde a Shoomaker, and the third a Curriar: E4v, l. 2: by the aunciente lawes and Statutes When the compositor of the cancel text came to the beginning of a new paragraph in the middle of Eiiii v he found it expedient to follow the rest of E4v line for line. But since the length of a line of type in the cancel is shorter than in the original, and the same fount was being used, the compositor was now compelled to set his type more closely, and to reverse the procedure he had followed hitherto. In the second half of Eiiii v final and medial e 's are dropped almost as frequently as earlier they had been introduced, and we find the occasional spellings Lether, shomaker, coms , although in adjacent lines the same compositor used the spellings normal in Elizabethan texts. Since the compositor of the cancel had obviously taken care that the last line of his last page should end with the same words as his copy, it follows that the cancel was set up at earliest after the outer forme of signature F had been printed off, for had that not yet been done it would have been quicker and cheaper to re-arrange any type already set, no matter how far composition had proceeded. In fact there is nothing to suggest that the cancel was printed before the whole book was completed. Thus there is no reason to question the statements of Gabriel Harvey and Thomas Nashe that the offensive allusion was cancelled only after the Quip was in circulation. Now that we know how scurrilous were the lines removed, there seems more probability than McKerrow allowed to Gabriel Harvey's assertion that Greene paid the printer to omit the offending passage for 'feare to be called Coram for those forged imputations'. 4 Although we possess only two copies of the first edition of the Quip , the range of variants they chance to include proves that at least three different states of the Quip must once have existed. The first copies put on sale must have contained E3-4 in its uncancelled form (as found in the Huntington copy). This is confirmed by what we know from other sources about the effect of the pamphlet's first publication. Since the Huntington copy contains a revised state of sheet F, it will be safer to assume that no impressions of F's unrevised state (found in the Bodleian copy) got into this first batch. After the Quip was already in circulation the two leaves E3-4 were removed from unsold copies and replaced by the cancel Eiij-iiii (found in the Bodleian copy). Thus the new state of the Quip must have contained a number of copies which combined the cancel Eiij-iiii with a revised version of F; it may indeed consisted entirely of copies so constituted. Of this state no copy has survived though, as we shall see, its former existence is proved by the readings of the second edition. The Bodleian copy represents yet a third state of the first edition. If it was not always unique (which is possible) it must be one of a relatively small number with that make-up, for there is no reason to suppose that many unrevised versions of sheet F were printed. If, however, any others were used, obviously one or two copies of the first edition may once have existed in yet another state, in which the original E3-4 was combined with the unrevised version of F. It should now be clear that an editor who wishes to produce a text of the Quip as close as possible to what Greene wrote must reprint signature E from the Huntington copy of the first edition and signature F from the Bodleian copy. Undoubtedly these present the text as Greene sent it to be printed. We cannot determine certainly whether the changes in signature F were made by Greene or by the printer (with or without Greene's knowledge or approval); but since the rewording of F4v in its second state drops, without absolute necessity, a phrase Greene would have wished to retain, 5 it will be safer to attribute these changes to the printer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Each of our only two copies of the first edition of the Quip shows two different and important variants. It is by this chance that we know the original contents of sheet E, and also that sheet F was revised during printing. Quite possibly changes were introduced into the text of other sheets during printing but if so, the chance that gave us variants of E and F has left us with duplicates of the same state of any other sheets that may have been altered. The Huntington and Bodleian copies do not represent all the different combinations that existed even of the varying states of sheets E and F, for it is clear that the copy of the first edition followed in the first reprint of 1592 must have contained the cancelled version of E (as in the Bodleian copy) and a revised version of F. It could not have been the Bodleian copy or another exactly similar to it, for the original comparison of the baker in the pillory to Christ on the Cross does not reappear in the reprint. 6 Moreover the 1592 reprint which Mr Miller believes to be the earliest of that series seems to be following here an improved version of the Huntington text of signature F. The Huntington reading has already been cited above; the Westminster Abbey copy of the Quip reads instead (E3, lines 16-21):- . . . . And for you / goodman Baker, you that loue to be seene in the open Market place / vpon the Pyllory, the world cries out of your wilinesse, you craue / but one deere yeare to make your daughter a Gentlewoman, you / buy your corne at the best hand, and yet will not be content to make / your bread weight by many ounces, you put in . . . This follows the original (Bodleian) wording exactly from 'the world cries out . . ." onwards, and is clearly better than the revision in the Huntington copy, for it gets rid of the Huntington's redundant 'where most people resort' and restores the significant phrase 'by many ounces'. We must conclude either that there was a second revision of sheet F (and consequently a third state, now lost), or that the printer of the first 1592 reprint, finding the reading of the revised version of F4v (as in the Huntington copy) unsatisfactory, sought out a copy of the original version (as in the Bodleian) and conflated the two texts to produce a better version. I find the latter explanation difficult to credit, and therefore conclude that sheet F was revised twice during the first printing of the Quip . There are other grounds for holding this view. Mr Miller has found that some at least of the type of Wolfe's 1592 reprints of the Quip was kept standing. 7 Is it possible that Wolfe, a shrewd printer and publisher of somewhat unorthodox business methods, realizing that Greene's Quip might be a 'best-seller', kept the type of the first edition standing, ready to meet any unexpectedly heavy demand for copies? If so, we have a very simple explanation of how several states of sheet F came to exist, for standing type lends itself in many ways to the generation of variants. If this surmise is correct, the first edition of the Quip may have been much larger than was usual, perhaps even larger than was officially permitted. Whatever its size, the disappearance of all but two copies shows how widely Greene's pamphlet was read, and thumbed out of existence, on first publication. It is also a warning that the total number of variant states may have been greater even than those postulated above, and that most of the textual alterations (possibly all except the cancellation of the passage about the Harveys) may have been introduced by the printer and publisher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III It would help towards solving a variety of problems about Elizabethan printing practice if we knew whether E3-4 and Eiij-iiii had been set by the same compositor, or by two different members of John Wolfe's printing house. On the whole it seems more than probable that the two texts are by different compositors. The cancel was set up by a compositor with a strong preference for spellings with y rather than i ; he set bewrayes, slye, exclayme, wype, smylinge, wyll, tryall, hys, villanyes, tyme, hym, wyth , (to take the first examples that occur) whereas his copy spells all these with i . It might be supposed that this spelling variation was adopted only to fill space in the cancel, since the letter y occupies more space than i . But this inference must be rejected because the same compositor equally consistently sets a final - y instead of the longer (and numerous) - ie spellings of his original, although, if his preference for y spellings were merely an expedient to fill space, one would have expected him to set - ye always instead of - ie or y . This he does only twice (Eiij, line 27: anye ; Eiiii, line 28: commoditye ); in the latter case at least he was clearly under more than ordinary pressure to fill his line with another letter. Significantly he drops a final - e after y (E3, line 5; E4v, line 17) three times. This abundant evidence that the compositor of the cancel would not suppress his personal preference for - y instead of - ie endings, even when it was expedient to do so, makes it certain that he cannot have set up the original leaves E3-4. It also warns us not to assume that his other substitutions of y for i were made solely, or even partly, to fill space.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Notes on the Text of Thierry and Theodoret Q1 by Robert K. Turner, Jr *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1621 The Tragedy of Thierry King of France, and his Brother Theodoret was first printed by Nicholas Okes in an anonymous quarto edition for Thomas Walkley. 1 The authors' names, omitted from the Q1 title-page, were partially supplied by Q2 (1648), the first issue of which attributed the play to Fletcher and the second to Beaumont and Fletcher. Massinger's hand has also been detected in the work, and Cyrus Hoy, 2 the most recent investigator of the authorship of the Beaumont and Fletcher plays, divides Thierry and Theodoret between the three dramatists in the following way: Beaumont: III; V,i Fletcher: I,i; II,ii-iii; IV,i; V,ii Massinger: I,ii; II,i,iv; IV,ii. From a purely literary point of view, the play is distinctly inferior to the great Beaumont and Fletcher collaborations, but Q1 is interesting to the textual critic because it apparently is a member of the rather mysterious cluster of King's Men properties, including Philaster, The Maid's Tragedy, A King and No King , and Othello , which appeared in the four-year period from 1619 through 1622. Thierry and Theodoret is the only one of these plays whose first edition was not succeeded within a few years by a second edition containing a corrected or even a materially different text. Hence Q1 is of particular importance and is worthy of close scrutiny. In what follows I shall discuss some bibliographical features of the book which permit an insight into its printing and then attempt to make some inferences about the kind of copy from which it was set up. Let us first consider the following categories of bibliographical evidence: Running-titles Q1 collates A 2 B-K 4 . The running-titles are The Tragedy of / Thierry and Theodoret . ( Theodoret and Thierry . on D3 and D4). Two skeleton formes, I and II, were used to machine the early sheets: I imposed B(i), C(o), and both formes of D and was thereupon abandoned; II imposed B(o), C(i), both formes of E, and all of the remaining formes. The running-title The Tragedy of appears undamaged on B1 v , C4 v , and D4 v , but on D3 v and in subsequent printings the " f " is broken off at the top. 3 Thus, D(o) is established as the first forme of that sheet to go through the press. Spelling A spelling test indicates that the book was set up by two compositors, A and B; the former preferred the spellings honour, doe, lye, onely, Bawd . or Baw . (in speech prefixes of the character Bawdber ), and either terminal - ie or - y . The latter preferred honor, do, lie, only, Bawdb. , and terminal - y . A composed sigs. B1-B4 and B sigs. C1-K4 v . B4 v contains few significant spellings but probably it was also part of A's stint. In the differentiation of the work of the two compositors, it may be significant that A fairly consistently indented speech prefixes with quads of uniform size, whereas B used quads of varying sizes. Type shortages Both Compositors A and B seem to have preferred roman capital "W" to "VV", but in sheets B, C, and D an apparent shortage of W's forced the workmen to substitute VV when W was needed. The occurrence of W and VV in these three sheets is as follows: B C D 1 1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v 1 1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v 1 1 v 2 2 v 3 3 v 4 4 v W 1 5 - 1 2 1 1 3 5 1 3 3 4 3 - 3 - 6 3 - - 3 3 3 VV - 1 5 - - - - - - - - - - 3 2 - - - - 5 3 - - 1 On B1 v the VV is found in the catchword; on C3 v the W's occur in lines 3, 8, and 22 and the VV's in lines 23, 34, and 37; and on D4 v the VV appears in line 2 and is followed by the three W's. From this pattern we can infer that sheet D at least was composed by formes rather than seriatim, and since D(o) is known by the broken type in the D3 v running-title to have preceded D(i) through the press, the order of composition was probably as follows: D(o) D(i) 1 2 v 3 4 v 1 v 2 3 v 4 W - - - 3 6 3 3 3 VV - 5 3 1 - - - - It appears, therefore, that Compositor B began setting sheet D with no W's in his case. After the composition of line 2 of D4 v and before the composition of line 10 (where the first W is found) a supply of W's was secured, doubtless from the distribution of wrought-off type. Broken and deformed types Certain of the types used in the composition of Thierry and Theodoret Q1 are so broken or deformed that they are individually recognizable, and their reappearances in various parts of the book give valuable clues to the order and speed of composition. As we should expect, the first types to reappear are those which had been used in the composition of sheet B. On C1 v we find in "by" (l. 13) the "b" of "be" from B3 (l. 18), in "the" (l. 3) the "h" of "thy" from B3 (l. 20), in "last" (l. 12) the "l" of "least" from B4 v (l. 3); on C2 we find the act head which had previously been used on B1 (with the numeral of "Act 1" appropriately changed to "2") as well as in "Which" (l. 23) the "h" of "this" from B4 (l. 32). I can locate no sheet B types on C2 v . On C3 the "b" of "booke" (l. 25) appears to be printed from the same type as that used in "but" (B2, l. 13) and the "d" of "and" (l. 22) that used in "debt" (B4, l. 22). On C3 v the "n" of "and" (l. 1) appears identical with the "n" of "not" (B2, l. 23). Types from both formes of B appear on C4, but C4 v seems to contain types from B(o) only — e.g. , the "o" of "owne" (l. 8) from "To" (B4 v l. 25), the "W" of "With" (l. 17) from "With" (B3, l. 4), and the "y" of "yet" (l. 29) from "my" (B2 v , l. 25). From this evidence we can draw at least one conclusion immediately: there must have been a delay between the printing of sheets B and C since both formes of B were distributed before the setting of either forme of C could have been completed. Since, as we shall see, some type from a source other than the early formes of Thierry probably was introduced into the cases during the composition of sheet D, we may surmise that some other work was done between the machining of sheets B and C. Moreover, it seems quite likely that the delay in the presswork on Thierry was somehow related to Compositor A's replacement by Compositor B. It may also be significant that no B type is found on C1 and C2 v . Similarly, type which had been used in sheet C reappears in sheet D, but this time the source of the recurring types seems to have been only the outer forme of the old sheet. The last "e" of "Beleeue" (C4 v , l. 14) is found again in "Were" (D1 v , l. 3 — first "e"), the "m" of "my" (C2 v , l. 29) in "comfort" (D1 v , l. 37), the "o" of "owne" (C4 v , l. 8) in "almost" (D1 v , l. 12), and, in addition, other C(o) types reappear on D3 v and D4. C(i) types do not show up before E1 v : on that page in "of" (l. 16) the "f" seems to be the same type which previously appeared in "proofe" (C3 v , l. 11) and in "liude" (l. 4) the "d" that of "aimde" (C3 v , l. 21). Evidence from recurring types must, I believe, be treated with reasonable caution: countless variations in the printing process ( e.g. , differences in inking, in pressure, in paper shrinkage) conspired to affect the impressions of the individual types and occasionally different types sustained nearly identical injuries, perhaps because of weaknesses inherent in the design of the letter or because of defects in the punches or the matrices. 4 Moreover, the location of a recurring type on a particular page does not mean that the forme which previously contained that type was distributed at the time the page on which the type reappears was set but by the time it was set. However, either by itself or, preferably, in conjunction with evidence from other sources, information furnished by the reappearance of types can tell a great deal about the method of printing a book. In the case of Thierry , the evidence of the running-titles, type shortages, and type recurrences suggests that sheet C, as well as sheet D, was composed by formes. Had C been set seriatim, we would expect to find some type either from B(i) or B(o) on C2 v since the former was distributed by the setting of B1 v and the latter by the setting of B2. In addition, we would have to suppose that after running out of W's on C3 v and using VV's in the composition of the rest of that page and all of C4, the workman distributed enough type to obtain the three W's which appear on C4 v and then ran out of the letter again, for he apparently had no W's when he began to set D(o). It seems more reasonable to think that C(o) was first composed, B(i) being distributed after the setting of C2v but before the completion of C3 and B(o) being distributed after C3 but before the completion of C4 v . Thus C(o), in skeleton I, could have been sent to the press either before or during the composition of C(i), which was imposed in skeleton II. From type reappearance, we know that C(o) was off the press and distributed at least by the time D1 v was composed; however, we should recall that during the setting of D4 v the supply of W's, which had been exhausted at C3 v and which had remained so during the composition of C4, D1, D2 v , and D3, was replenished. We may assume, then, that C(o), which contained fifteen W's, was distributed during the setting of D4 v , thus freeing skeleton I for use in imposing D(o). But D(i) was also imposed in skeleton I; hence, by the time the composition of D(i) was completed D(o) was off the press and skeleton I was again freed for use. It may be possible that type which had not previously been used in Thierry was also distributed during the setting of D(i); eighteen W's were used in the setting of C4 v and D(i) but C(o) had contained only fifteen pieces of this type. Since there is no sign of the distribution of C(i) before sheet E and no further indication of type shortage in the remaining sheets of the book, it may be that the additional W's were secured from standing type which had been set for another job. After the perfecting of sheet D, skeleton I was abandoned and skeleton II was used to impose both formes of all subsequent sheets. D(o) must have come from the press at about the time the composition of D(i) was completed because its skeleton was used to impose D(i). D(o) type begins to appear at E1; C(i) type, however, does not begin to show up before E1 v . Hence, it seems probable that sheet E was also composed by formes, outer first, and that C(i) was kept standing until after the composition of E4 v , at which time skeleton II was freed and placed around the type pages of E(o). Type reappearances show that D(i) was distributed before the setting of E3 v was completed, thus freeing skeleton I, but E(o) was off the press in time for skeleton II to be used in preference to I for E(i). From this point on, the picture seems fairly clear. Composition so lagged behind presswork that the re-use of skeleton I (or the construction of a new skeleton) was never advantageous; in all cases the wrought-off forme seems to have come from the press before, or perhaps just as, a new forme was ready for imposition. There seems every reason to believe that composition continued by formes. In order to change to seriatim setting, Compositor B would have had to set three more type-pages in any given sheet to get the first forme of that sheet ready for the press than would have been required had he continued to set by formes. Moreover, had he been able to gain enough time with respect to the pace of his press to accomplish this additional work, the setting of only one more type-page would have made the second forme of the sheet ready for imposition. Under these circumstances, he would almost certainly have reintroduced his abandoned skeleton, for by doing so he could have avoided all of the inefficiencies of the one-skeleton process. 5 From 1615 to 1626 Okes is known to have printed fifteen dramatic quartos, excluding eight triumphs (which are less than four sheets long). 6 With the sole exception of Lingua Q3 (1617), these were all multiple-skeleton books; hence, we may take it as a general rule that for dramatic quartos two-skeleton procedure was standard in Okes's shop during this period. The reversion to one-skeleton printing in Thierry , therefore, may be regarded as distinctly unusual. Possibly an analogous situation is found in Philaster Q1, printed by Okes in 1620, where there is a temporary change from two- to one-skeleton procedure and where the general condition of the text justifies the inference that bad copy caused the composition to lag behind presswork. 6a But, as I will attempt to show below, the manuscript from which Thierry was printed, while perhaps not ideal copy, was probably no worse than average; it certainly was far superior to the copy of Philaster Q1. Hence, we should look elsewhere for an explanation of the lag in composition, and I suggest, on grounds that must remain speculative until further investigation has been completed, that the difficulty lay with the compositor rather than the manuscript. The preferred spellings of Compositor B, the workman who set sheets C through K, compare reasonably closely with the preferences of the workman who set most of sheet G of The Maid's Tragedy Q1: the two agree in favoring blood, deare, eye, honor , and yeare to alternative spellings. 7 If my identification is correct, we have some reason to think that this workman was not a regular compositor but a person who had other duties in Okes's establishment. His part in The Maid's Tragedy was clearly that of a relief compositor: he set only seven pages of one sheet. His replacement of Compositor A in Thierry after a delay in the printing suggests that there too he stepped in to complete a job which one of the regular compositors for some reason could not finish. Perhaps, then, we should not be surprised to find that his work was rather more deliberate than that of an ordinary compositor, nor would it be unlikely that the material he set was proofread with more than ordinary care. 8 Until all extant copies have been collated, we cannot say a great deal about the proofing of Thierry . However, the copy now part of the Thomas Pennant Barton Collection of the Boston Public Library has an extra leaf C1 inserted, the verso of which bears proof-reader's corrections (see plate). 9 Like the proofsheet of Tichborne's A Triple Antidote , a book printed by Okes in 1609, this one shows a concern primarily for purely mechanical matters. 10 In line 10 the word "traine" is to be deleted, since it had been duplicated erroneously in the turnover (one wonders why the turnover was not deleted instead); in line 26 the compositor is evidently directed to replace or drive down a type whose shoulder was inking; in line 28 a letter (obliterated -- perhaps an "r") wrongly set between the "u" and the "ft" of "Mufter" is to be removed; and in line 37 a comma is to be inserted after the nominative of address " Martell ." I think that the mark at line 37 which was cancelled and encircled was a period intended to replace the comma after " Vitry "; the proof-reader, realizing that the sentence was not concluded there but on C2, scratched it. Comparison of this page with a page in the corrected state shows that all indicated errors were repaired. It is clear that the corrector was not meticulously concerned with the sense of what he was reading. "Mothers" in line 6 is a pretty obvious error for "mothes," and in line 10, the very line in which the first correction was made, the egregious omission of "her" before "vertuous" went unnoticed. There is no indication, of course, that the proofreader consulted copy. Although a collation might turn up other variants which could change our opinion, we are probably safe in thinking that even if Thierry was set by a relief compositor, it was proofed primarily for mechanical rather than literary errors. Corruption in a text for which no control exists is often difficult to isolate because many of the sophistications of compositors and proofreaders must necessarily go undetected. However, in these cases an examination of the manifest errors can provide some insight into the nature of the manuscript which underlay the print. Of particular interest are errors which were apparently caused by misreading; if they abound we are probably justified in assuming illegible copy, although this assumption must be tempered by whatever knowledge we have of the compositor's performance in other books. The care with which the book under study was proofed is also relevant since we know that readers, in addition to correcting mechanical errors, would also tamper with parts of the text which seemed to them defective. I have based what follows on an examination of the Folger Shakespeare Library's copy of Thierry Q1, which may contain one or more uncorrected sheets. A complete collation of the extant copies of Thierry would doubtless reveal some variants of which we are now unaware, but on the evidence of the Boston proof I doubt that they would affect the results of my analysis substantially. Compositor A's one-sheet stint is too short to give us a fair sample of his work, yet in his eight pages twelve errors which can probably be attributed to him are detectable. Of these at least seven pretty clearly spring from the misreading of terminal flourishes or superscripts: B1 13 Actions followes ] Actions follow B2 25 Lyes ] Lye B2 v 16 watch ] watched or watcht B2 v 24 weeper ] weeper's B3 v 36 you ] you'r or you're B4 10 you ] your B4 v 26 you ] your One of the remaining errors (B3 v 33 on ] of) is probably either a misreading or a foul case error; the others (at B1 v 25, B2 14, B2 v 4, and B2 v 23) are mechanical errors — foul case, transposition, and turned letters. In the rest of the book, all Compositor B's work, we can observe the same tendency toward minor misreading errors that we have seen in little in the first sheet. I count eighteen errors which can reasonably be placed in this category: C1 v 6 mothers ] mothes C2 14 neere ] neerer C2 v 2 doner ] owner C3 v 4 care and hidden acts ] rare and hidden arts 11 D1 v 37 mothers ] mothes E1 v 18 him, which ] him with, F1 32 We are ] N'ere 12 F3 v 8 son's ] sum's F4 23 I do ] I'd G3 1-2 wishes/Outrunnes ] wishes/Outrunne G3 13 Giue ] Giues G4 v 16 hard ] heard H1 15 they'r ] thou'rt H2 14 worthies ] worthes I3 v 11 good ] God I4 12 preferre ] preuent K2 24 prayers ] prayer K3 v 3 are ] haue There are other errors which are probably attributable to misreading, foul case, or the careless substitution of one letter for another: D1 8 texde ] texte D4 v 3 man ] men E2 v 14 stags falls ] stags falle F2 6 not ] nor F2 v 23 Forts ] Forte F3 31 matcht ] marcht G1 31 Bequeathe ] Bequeathd I3 24 tones ] tongs And others which most likely proceeded either from misreading or memorial failure: C4 5 your ] you E1 7 you ] your E4 28 worke ] worde F3 21 to ] do K3 v 31 thine ] then I cannot pretend that these lists are exhaustive; indeed, I have deliberately excluded errors of which misreading does not seem to have been a possible cause. Some of these are errors, primarily of omission, which seem to result from eyeskip or memorial failure; careless spelling; and such mechanical mistakes as transpositions of words and letters, turned letters, incorrect spacings, and obvious foul cases errors which result in nonsense words. In addition, the entire book contains a number of punctuation errors which indicate that the compositors misunderstood the sense of the material which they were setting. I have found some fifty errors of these kinds in B's stint, excluding mistakes in punctuation. Furthermore, other errors are certain to have been omitted which are concealed by the looseness of Elizabethan grammar and sentence structure or the sophistications of the compositors. That Compositor B made at least some textual changes in the light of his own judgement is suggested by a reading found at I4 32. The correct version, "Come there a band of em, i'le charge single," is rendered as "Come, there are a band of em, i'le charge single," a statement contradicted by the facts of the plot. Although the handwriting created some minor difficulties, the copy was far more legible than some that Okes's compositors were asked to cope with. Nowhere do we find, as we do in Philaster Q1, such gibberish as "sight song" for "sigh'd, wept, sung" or "number without Probatum" for "nunne without probation." Nor do we get such corruptions as "resterine" for "re-stem" or "Loue lines" for "loueliness" as we do in Othello Q1, a book which Miss Walker believes to have been printed from a reasonably legible manuscript. 13 Thierry does, however, preserve certain characteristics which indicate that it is descended from a non-theatrical manuscript. I regard none of these features as conclusive in itself, but their cumulative effect is to point away from underlying prompt copy. Let us first look at the stage directions. Five are clearly permissive: C2 v Enter Protaldie, with souldiers . F3 v Enter Protaldy, a Lady, and Reuellers . H3 v Enter Thierry, and Courtiers . K2 Enter Thierry, on a bed, with Doctors and attendants . K2 v Enter Martell, Brunhalt, Deuitry, souldiers . In addition, there are three directions, all at the beginnings of scenes, which use the formula "&amp;c." apparently to indicate that the scene commences with the characters named but that others enter later in the scene: B4 Enter Theodoret, Martell. &amp;c. C2 Enter Thierry, Brunhalt, Bawdber, Lecure. &amp;c. E1 Enter T [ h ] ierry, Ordella, Brunhalt, Theodoret, Lecure, Bawdber. &amp;c. Such a notation suggests the author's rather than the book-keeper's hand, and it may be significant that a similar direction is found in Crane's transcript of Demetrius and Enanthe which is thought to have been copied from Fletcher's foul papers. 14 Stage directions do not furnish an altogether reliable means for distinguishing between theatrical and non-theatrical copy because the book-keepers often let authorial directions stand in prompt copies. 15 However, their presence combined with a complete absence of "professional" directions provides some ammunition for argument against prompt copy. Minor confusion in the designation of characters also argues against prompt. A stage direction on D3 v calls for the entry of two huntsmen, but the text and subsequent stage directions refer to them as keepers; the honest soldier is referred to variously in the text, stage directions, and speech prefixes as "Vitry" or "Devitry"; the astrologer who is impersonated by Lecure is known as both "Forte" and "Leforte." It is doubtful that all of these variations could have occurred in transmission, and they probably would have been undesirable from the book-keeper's point of view. Hence, they provide another indication that the manuscript underlying Thierry was non-theatrical. What evidence there is suggests that the Thierry manuscript consisted of the authors' papers, and the general freedom from confusion and serious misreading indicates that these were in the form of fair copy. Of particular interest is the frequent use of parentheses in Massinger's scenes chiefly to punctuate nominatives of address and non-restrictive modifiers. No parentheses whatever appear in the rest of the play except in one of Fletcher's scenes (III,iii) where they are used to mark several asides occurring within a longer speech (E2). Since parentheses abound in the early editions of Massinger's unaided works and are used profusely in the autograph manuscript of Believe as you List , we are justified in considering them as a distinctive Massinger characteristic. 16 Thus, we have reason to believe that the Massinger scenes of Thierry were set up either from fair copy made by the dramatist himself or from an unsophisticated scribal transcript of his papers, probably the former. Similarly, the Fletcher and Beaumont scenes were probably printed from holograph manuscripts. Dr. Hoy points out that the linguistic divisions between the different shares are distinct: Fletcher's scenes, for example, contain twenty-one of the twenty-two ye 's found in the play. 17 It is also interesting (and somewhat puzzling) that the contraction um is found only in the Fletcherian parts; the form occurs in certain of Fletcher's unaided works, yet in Philaster and A King and No King it also turns up in Beaumont's scenes. Therefore, um cannot be considered distinctly Fletcherian, and, as far as we know now, there is no reason to think that it is either scribal or compositorial. Nevertheless, Dr. Hoy suggests that the exclusive occurrence of the form in Fletcher's scenes of Thierry constitutes, for that play at least, a valid distinction between the work of the two dramatists, 18 and the fact that the distinction has been preserved in the print argues against the intervention of a scribe. Furthermore, the number of misreading errors is, I believe, about what we should expect if the compositors were working from author's fair copy; it is too high to reflect the very legible copy that would have been produced by a professional scribe and at the same time too low to reflect the illegibility of early working papers. A misassigned speech in Fletcher's share tends to support this view. The speech occurs at H1 v 20 in the midst of dialogue between Ordella and Martell; it properly belongs to Martell but is prefixed Deui. It seems nearly impossible that this error could have been made by a compositor or scribe, since the single incorrect prefix is found some ten quarto pages after Devitry's last speech and some ten before his next. The only reasonable way to account for the error is to regard it as an authorial slip, probably made during transcription. If it is true that Beaumont's scenes as well as Fletcher's were printed from holograph, we must account for several serious errors which are found in them. The first of these is the incorrect reading in V,i (I4), which, as I have indicated above, could very easily be a compositorial sophistication. The second is two misassigned speeches in III,i (F3). Lecure enters to Brunhalt at F2 v 31: in the short colloquy which follows, the two discuss the several evil plans which the Queen has set in motion. The interview concludes with the following speech by Brunhalt: A sore that must be plasterde [a reference to Protaldye's loss of reputation], in whose would/ Others shall find their graues, thinke themselues sound,/ Your eare, and quickest apprehension. Exeunt : There is no way to interpret the action here but that Brunhalt and Lecure leave the stage talking to one another. However, immediately after, we find: Enter Bawdber, and a seruant . Bawdb . This man of war will aduance. Lecure . His houres vpon the stroake. Bawdb . Wind him backe as you fauor my eares, I loue no noyse in my head, my braines haue hitherto Bin imployde in silent businesses. Enter Deuitry . Lecure . The gentleman is within your reach Sir. Exit. It is clear, as Dyce indicated, that the two speeches here assigned to Lecure must have been intended for the servant, who is brought on the stage solely for the purpose of delivering them. 19 The misassignments are undoubtedly transmission errors, probably resulting from memorial failure induced by the "Lecure" speech prefixes at the foot of F2 v and the top of F3. The compositor may have been responsible, but it is not impossible that Beaumont himself made the mistake in transcribing his drafts into fair copy. The last of these errors, a misplaced stage direction, is not so easy to explain away. At F3 v 14 Protaldye and a Lady correctly enter to Bawdber and Devitry, but the stage direction — Enter Protaldy, a Lady, and Reuellers — also brings on revellers who are not required for some forty lines. The text is quite explicit on this point: at F4 23 Thierry, who has since entered, states, "Command the Reuellers in." At C2 v 8 a direction that was evidently in the margin of the manuscript was placed by the compositor one line late, but it is difficult to see how he could have been guilty of placing a direction forty lines early. Similarly, it is very unlikely that Beaumont, whose mind must have been on the working out of the comic discomfiture of Protaldye, would have introduced the revellers in the wrong place. I think, therefore, that this stage direction and possibly others in Beaumont's scenes were touched up by someone else, perhaps Fletcher. On the face of it, we should expect at least one of the collaborators to look over the whole manuscript to make minor revisions and to expunge glaring inconsistencies. In this connection it may be significant that in both Beaumont's and Fletcher's parts we find stage directions in similar phraseology, i.e., Exeunt all, but Brunhalt, Protal. Lecure, Bawdber. in II,iii (E3 v ), a Fletcher scene, and Exit all but Thierry. Brunhalt. in III,i (F2), a Beaumont scene. Massinger's corresponding form is Exeunt omnes, praeter Brun. Bawdber [ etc. ] (D1 v ). 20 Moreover, in the entire play there are only three stage directions in roman rather than italic type ("Reades" D1 v 9, "aside" E1 v 16, and "aside" E1 v 26), a fact which suggests that in the copy they were written in the secretary rather than the Italian hand and therefore may have been added later than the original writing. The first of these occurs in a Massinger scene; the other two in a Fletcher scene. To summarize, the evidence suggests that Thierry Q1 was set by a compositor whose speed was deliberate enough to cause him to adopt one-skeleton procedure, although there is nothing to suggest that his copy slowed him down very much. He may have been an apprentice or a relief compositor. The characteristics of the print indicate that he was setting from a composite fair copy written in the hands of the three collaborators which may have been reviewed and slightly revised by Fletcher. There is nothing to suggest that this manuscript had served as prompt or that it had been annotated for transcription into prompt. The print conveys the general impression of a clean job, marred by only a few accidents of transmission.</field>

John Okes, who gained his freedom in 1627, should have begun his apprenticeship about this time, and, to compound speculation, he might have assisted the regular compositors during the early part of his training. Possibly he was Compositor B of Thierry . 9 All indications are that the markings are contemporaneous with the leaf, the existence of which was called to my attention by Mr. John Alden of the Boston Public Library. Mr. Alden furnishes the following information regarding it: "The leaf is definitely an insert and disjunct: removed, no doubt, from an imperfect copy. It contains on the inner margin a watermark, that of a vase made up of crescent designs, found elsewhere in the complete copy. As to where the leaf came from, I suspect that it was inserted by Thomas Rodd, but this will have to remain a conjecture. The book itself was purchased for Thomas Pennant Barton by John Russell Smith for 17/ at the Sotheby-Wilkinson auction of 23 May 1856 and is described in the Catalogue of a Very Valuable and Important Collection of Shakesperian and Dramatic Literature as item no. 150. In referring to this sale, both Russell Smith and the British Museum's catalogue of English book auctions identify the books as coming from the possession of Halliwell-Phillipps. On one of the blank fly-leaves, provided by the early 19th-century binder, there appears a manuscript annotation, as follows. 'The duplicate title at the end [pasted down inside the back cover] is added on account of a ms. note showing the original price of the book ["d 1-2"?]; &amp; the duplicate leaf, sig. C., because it has some contemporary corrections of the text.' If I am not mistaken, this annotation is in the hand of the dealer Thomas Rodd. I suspect he inserted the leaf and title page in the volume, had it bound, and sold it to Halliwell-Phillipps." I am much indebted not only to Mr. Alden but also to the Trustees of the Boston Public Library, who gave permission to reproduce the leaf. 10 See John Russell Brown, "A Proof-Sheet from Nicholas Okes' Printing-Shop," Studies in Bibliography , XI (1958), 228-231. 11 So emended by Dyce, following Seward; see The Works of Beaumont and Fletcher (1843), I, 123.

      <field name="heading_text">Richardsoniana by T. C. Duncan Eaves and Ben D. Kimpel</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All scholars who have worked on Samuel Richardson have used the six large bound volumes of manuscript material in the Forster Collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum—for the most part letters to Richardson and copies or first drafts of his replies, once part of his own collection. But most of them seem not to have been aware of a bound volume of printed matter labeled "Richardsoniana" which also forms part of the Forster Collection. Comparison of this volume with Richardson's manuscript indices to items about Clarissa and Sir Charles Grandison 1 shows that all but the second of these printed works in the "Richardsoniana" volume are from Richardson's own collection and that it, therefore, answers several minor questions which Richardson scholars have been unable to settle conclusively. The first item is the anonymous pamphlet entitled Remarks on Clarissa, Addressed to the Author (London, 1749). 2 Professor Alan Dugald McKillop states that this pamphlet was probably written by Sarah Fielding: "A manuscript bearing exactly this title is entered in the Index to Clarissa material, Forster MS XV, 3, f. 2, but is no longer to be found in the collection. The entry is marked in Richardson's hand, 'By Miss F------g.' The pagination recorded in the Index shows that this piece was over fifty pages long, thus corresponding in length to the printed pamphlet." 3 The index to the Clarissa material reads "p: 216:—Remarks on Clarissa address'd to y e Author. By Miss F------g." The next item in the index is on page 272. The last page of "Remarks on Clarissa" should, therefore, be page 271; and the pamphlet in the "Richardsoniana" volume is, in fact, numbered in ink from 216 through 271. This confirms Professor McKillop's conjecture that the item listed in the index is Remarks on Clarissa , and that Remarks on Clarissa is, therefore, by Sarah Fielding. The second item is a copy of the catalogue of the Southgate sale of January 21-22, 1828, at which the Richardson material in the Forster Collection was purchased. The third item is Answer to the Letter of a Very Reverend and Worthy Gentleman, Objecting to the Warmth of a Particular Scene in the History of Clarissa , an eleven-page pamphlet without a title-page (the verso of page 11 is blank), dated at the end "London, June 8, 1749." The pamphlet is numbered in ink from 204 through 215, which corresponds to the item in the Clarissa index "p: 204:—Letter to a Gentleman who had objected to y e Fire Scene in Clarissa." The next item in the index is numbered 216. Austin Dobson gives a brief description of this printed letter, 4 but Professor William Merritt Sale, Jr., (page 54) states that he has not seen a copy and Professor McKillop (page 266) refers only to Dobson's description and a Dutch translation of the letter by Johannes Stinstra. It appears likely that Dobson had examined the "Richardsoniana" volume and that it is this copy of Richardson's Answer that he has described. For scholars who could not read Dutch, Dobson's brief and incomplete account of the letter's contents has been the only source of information about this pamphlet. A good deal of Richardson's defence of the fire scene is, as Dobson says, on artistic grounds. Richardson carefully analyzes the situation which makes such a scene necessary and the character of Lovelace (who describes the scene) which justifies the terms of the description. "You, [ sic ] know Sir, what is required of Writers, who aim at personating (in order to describe the more naturally) a particular Character, whether good or bad" (page 7). He also points out that unless such a scene is detailed and vivid there will be no apparent justification for Clarissa's flight to Hampstead. However, Dobson implies that Richardson justifies the scene only on artistic grounds, whereas he justifies it on moral grounds as well. Young women should be warned by being shown "the sly, the artful Progressions to a criminal Attempt" (page 5), and should also be shown how to triumph, as Clarissa does, if such an attempt is made. If the scene had not been described, the licentious would have been ready to blame Lovelace for not succeeding "and to boast what They would have done on the like Occasion" (page 7). If the attempt had not been particularly described, the licentious would have imagined "that the Indignities offered to her were of an higher and grosser Nature, than now there is room to suppose they were" (page 8). Richardson mentions another worthy gentleman and several ladies of his acquaintance who have also objected to the scene, but he himself cannot imagine that it can really be inflaming: in writing it "the Passion I found strongest in me, whenever I supposed myself a Reader only, and the Story real, was Anger , or Indignation : I had too great an Aversion to the intended Violator of the Honour of a CLARISSA, to suffer any-thing but alternate Admiration and Pity of her, and Resentment against him, to take place in my Mind, on the Occasion" (page 7); "What a Mind must that be, that could make Sport to itself, or even light, of what was Death, or worse than Death, to a Fellow-creature supremely excellent!" (page 11). The fourth and fifth items are clippings from the Gentleman's Magazine , XIX (June, August, 1749), 245-246, 345-349, which contain a character of Clarissa "by an Ingenious Foreigner" and remarks on and objections to Clarissa "Translated from the French," with a long note answering the objections. The Clarissa index lists for page 272 "Critical Acct: of Clarissa Translated from y e french. Objections answer'd &amp;c." The clippings are numbered in ink from 272 through 279, and the next item in the index is listed as on page 280. Professor Sale (pages 54, 107-108) and Professor McKillop (page 252) identify these articles as translations of articles by Albrecht von Haller in the Bibliothèque raisonnée of Amsterdam. Nothing in these copies would confirm or disprove their conjecture that the note at the end of the second article was written by Richardson himself. The last two items are two copies of the printed letters "Copy of a Letter to a Lady" and "Answer to a Letter from a Friend," written by Richardson and described by Professor Sale (pages 94-95). The first page of the first copy is numbered in ink 157, and the first page of the second copy 277. In Richardson's manuscript index to the Sir Charles Grandison material are two items "Printed Letters--------p. 157" and "Printed Letters--------p. 277." The letters are eight pages long and eight pages are left for them in the index in the first place and nine in the second.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Thomas Taylor's Biography by G. E. Bentley, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the last thirty years there has been a surprising amount of speculation about the influence of the enthusiastic Platonist Thomas Taylor upon most of the major poets of the Romantic Movement. 1 There is great difficulty in establishing these claims, because, although Taylor was notorious as "the English Pagan," his life and friendships are shrouded in considerable obscurity, and there are important bibliographical problems connected with a number of his works. Our knowledge of Taylor's life comes principally from an anonymous article entitled "Mr. Taylor, the Platonist" which appeared in a history of some Public Characters of 1798 . Much of the information in this article is of an extremely minute and personal nature (though there is a large and troubling unconcern for dates), and the assumption among scholars has been that it was written either by Taylor himself or by a very close friend. On the other hand, the statement that "the celebrated Mrs. Woolstoncraft and her friend Miss Blood, resided with our philosopher for nearly three months" distressingly lacks the warranty of correct spelling. 2 It is a matter of considerable interest, therefore, to verify the authorship of this essay. In particular, it would be interesting to know the authority for the statements that Taylor made many friends "through the means of Mr. Geo. Cumberland," and that one of his first efforts "to emerge from obscurity" was to give a series of lectures on Platonism "at the request of Mr. Flaxman . . . who very benevolently permitted him to read his Lectures in the largest room of his house." About this time, the early 1780s, Flaxman and Cumberland were probably among Blake's closest friends. 3 The following letter, addressed to Cumberland at "Bishops Gate, near Egham, Surry," is therefore of some importance. Adelphi, Society of Arts Octr: 7th 1798 Dear Sir A volume will be published next month entitled "Public Characters of the Year 98". In this volume I am to make my appearance: and as the Editor requested me for this purpose to give him some memoirs of my stormy life, I have drawn up as accurate an Account of myself as memory would permit; thinking it was better to be my own executioner, than to be murdered by any editor, or hierling Author in Great Britain. In the course of these memoirs, I have taken care to inform the world, that it was principally owing to you, that I was enabled to emerge from the obscurity &amp; servility of a Bankers Clerk; &amp; have mentioned you as well known, by the publication of several ingenious works. This I thought no more than justice, &amp; hope you will consider what I have done in that light. Wishing you health, peace &amp; temperance, I remain Yours sincerely Thomas Taylor 4 Scholars interested in the career of Thomas Taylor may therefore accept as absolutely authoritative the essay in Public Characters of 1798 .</field>

"Blake's Engravings and his Friendship with Flaxman," SB , XII (1959). According to the rate books in Westminster Public Library, Buckingham Palace Road, London, Flaxman lived in a small house at 24 Wardour Street in 1783-84 when the lectures were given in his house. George Cumberland was the first man to praise Blake in print, in a previously unnoticed review of the Royal Academy exhibition in the Morning Chronicle and London Advertiser , May 27th 1780. It seems likely that Blake's method of printing his illuminated books was derived from Cumberland's article on a "New Mode of Printing," A New Review , IV (October 1784), 318-319. Paradoxically, on January 22nd 1809 Cumberland referred to this as "Blakes Method" (B.M. MSS., 36,501 f.360). 4 Quoted from a microfilm of the manuscript in the collections of The Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Though Taylor does not appear in the list of friends to whom Cumberland sent copies of his Thoughts on Outline (B.M. MSS., 36,518, f.60), he evidently sent him a copy as a result of the above letter, for on October 16th 1798 Taylor thanked him for it (B.M. MSS., 36,498, f.246), though he did not mention the plates by Blake. Taylor may have told the publisher of the Public Characters , Richard Phillips, of what he had done, for Phillips wrote asking Cumberland to use his great knowledge of public figures to correct the volume (B.M. MSS., 36,498, f.267). A little later (February 6th 1799), Cumberland's cousin Richard wrote saying that he too had written an autobiographical essay for the Public Characters (B.M. MSS., 36,498, f. 278).</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Unrecorded Coleridge Variants: Additions and Corrections by David V. Erdman, Lucyle Werkmeister, and R. S. Woof</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Publication in Studies in Bibliography, XI (1958), 143-162 of a chronological report, by David V. Erdman, of uncollected variant readings and occurrences of Coleridge's verse in British newspapers has elicited a good deal of helpful response from the Coleridgeans of three countries. Professor J. R. MacGillivray has come forward with a discovery that pushes back the date of the first known Coleridge publication from 1793 to 1790, and subsequently Mrs. Lucyle Werkmeister has located another appearance of the same poem even five days earlier. Mrs. Werkmeister (whose research at the British Museum was supported by a grant from the Johnson Fund, American Philosophical Society) has also discovered that the Horne Tooke poem of 1796, destined for the Morning Chronicle but never found there, actually was published in the Telegraph . She is responsible for the new listings of 1794, 1795, and 1797; and she has brought home in triumph a lost Coleridge poem (see January 3, 1798) at the end of a hunt that engaged also Professor Carl Woodring and all the others named in this paragraph. Mr. R. S. Woof, working from the Coleridge Notebooks to the Morning Post , has rescued from oblivion a considerable list of Coleridge "epigrams"; his are most of the new discoveries of 1799 (September 2, 3, 19, November 4, December 9) and 1800 (January 1, February 5, August 22) and 1801 (December 21). He and Mr. Morchard Bishop and the original compiler are responsible for corrections of errors and ambiguities in the original list. Its compiler is responsible for there having been need of correction—and for most of the additions from the Courier and the Albion and Evening Advertiser . The limited nature of the original survey, as regards the Courier , was not made quite plain: "all items have been attended to" meant that all poems known to have appeared in the Courier had been collated, not that an exhaustive search of a complete run of that paper had been made. More precisely: exhaustive search had been made of the Courier for the years 1804-1820; of the Morning Post for the years 1797-1804 (except that no papers of January 3, April 5, May 15, or December 8, 1798, have been located); of the Morning Chronicle only for the years 1794-96; and of the Cambridge Intelligencer (with the exception of several missing numbers) for 1792-1803. An exhaustive survey of the Courier has now been extended to the years 1797-1803 (except for missing issues of February 27, March 16, May 19, June 1, August 15, September 12-14, 1797, and October 20, November 7, 23, December 7, 1798). The Morning Chronicle has been examined up through 1798. And a survey has been made of the few extant copies of the Albion (May 26-December 27, 1800, incomplete; June 29-July 2, 4-10, 1801). Most of the new items from these two surveys are merely reprintings from Coleridge's Poems or his Schiller or the Lyrical Ballads —or the Morning Post . But a peculiar interest attaches to the reprintings in the Courier . After the summer of 1799 (and perhaps secretly much earlier) Daniel Stuart owned both Post and Courier . As the mocking editor of the Albion observed (October 3, 1800), the evening paper was considered but "a supernumerary" of the morning one; puns and paragraphs and verses were often carried over from one to the other. If a text appearing in the Morning Post during Coleridge's contributorship may be considered an authorized text, so may a modification of it appearing in the Courier (see June 21 and August 22, 1800). It may be noted here that two sonnets itemized in the first list as tentative and possible attributions (January 29 and February 21, 1795) were examined in detail by Mr. Erdman and the first, a Sonnet. To Mrs. Siddons , found to be intimately related to the known work of Coleridge. ("Newspaper Sonnets Put to the Concordance Test: Can They be Attributed to Coleridge?"

Discovered in this newspaper by L. Werkmeister. See next entry. *†July 31. Cambridge Chronicle. The Abode of Love . Signed "S.T.C." Identical with preceding. Discovered by J. R. MacGillivray. Coleridge was still a schoolboy in London; his poem preceded him to Cambridge by a year. For text and attribution see MacGillivray, "A New and Early Poem by Coleridge," BNYPL , LXIII (March, 1959), 153-154. 1794 ?*†June 28. MC. Sonnet. On Reading Miranda's Sonnet to a Sigh . "Thy plaintive voice, so eloquent and meek" Unsigned. Enough like Coleridge's effusions to be worth considering. Dated "Dec. 9, 1793," by which time he was already Comberbache in the Dragoons in Reading; but December 9 may be taken as the date of the occasion (Miranda's [Mrs. Mary Robinson's?] Sonnet to a Sigh published that day in the MC ); the writing could have been done in the ensuing 7 months. But we list this sonnet with misgivings; the concordance test yields only a neutral answer: possible. ?*†July 25. MP. Sonnet To an Infant at the Breast . "Dear, lovely Babe! equal in birth to all" Signed "C." This equalitarian effusion by a war-widow contains sentiments and language which the Coleridge of 1794 might have put into a female vagrant's mouth (see letter to Southey July 6). But "C." is too general a signature, by one-third. Neither this nor the preceding item could be admitted into the canon without compelling external evidence. 1795 Jan. 29; Feb. 21. For text and discussion of sonnets previously listed, see BNYPL , LXI and LXII. ?*†March 23. Times . "Oh People! whither are you led" Signed "C." A quatrain submitted in a contest (possibly with cash prizes) for the best renditions of a French epigram. Over 50 were submitted. The "C." might be Coleridge; the "R.S." on another entry Robert Southey. Coleridge and Southey were together at the time; needed money; were alert to possibilities of writing for London papers (see Coleridge's letter of March 10 to Dyer). Yet the text is too slight and uncreative to afford evidence of authorship. The other three lines read: Oh People! surely turn'd to Brutes; To have a Cap without a Head, To have a Tree, without the Roots. 1796 *July 9. Telegraph. Poetical Address. Written for the Late Meeting of Mr. Tooke's Friends . By S. T. COLERIDGE. 53 lines, with three footnotes. This must be the draft which Charles Lamb, in a letter of July 1, expected to see in the June 30 MC ; it differs much from the obviously later draft which Coleridge sent in a letter of July 4 to Estlin (Griggs, I, 224-225; E.H.C. pp. 150-151). The title in E.H.C. is made up from phrases in the letter; otherwise E.H.C. and Griggs give the same Estlin text ( E ) except for punctuation, the use of ampersands, "lightning's" in line 24, a mistake in E.H.C. for "lightning," and a footnote in Greek not given in E.H.C. For the following collation we use Griggs for E . The Telegraph version ( T ) omits the footnotes of E but has three of its own, attached respectively to "when*" in line 1, "whose†" in line 13, and "bore,‡" in the third line from the end, thus: *Alluding to Horne Tooke's first contest for Westminster, and the comparatively small numbers, which he then polled. †Diversions of Purley. [ E gives the Greek title.] ‡Jun. Brutus. T has only two words in italics, " superstition's " and "determin'd ", as against 15 in E . Instead of E 's numerous capitalized words within the line, T has only Genii, TOOKE, Corruption's, Calumny's, Senate, Justice, Freedom's, not counting proper names. Except for punctuation, the other variants follow.

Text identical, except for mechanics, to that in the Cambridge Intelligencer of Dec. 17, 1796, as reported in previous list. Dec. 12. MP. Melancholy. A Fragment . E.H.C. (p. 74) gives the MP variants by mistake to " M.C. " (for lines 7 and 13-16). *Dec. 16. MC. Sonnets Attempted in the Manner of 'Cotemporary Writers .' Signed "NEHEMIAH HIGGINBOTTOM." Sonnet I only (E.H.C. pp. 209-210) reprinted from the Monthly Magazine of November, as in our previous list, with "befel" for "befell" in line 10, and with this headnote: The inundation of Sonnets with which we have been for the last ten years overrun, has justly made our sentimental Sonnetteers objects of ridicule. Nehemiah Higginbottom, in the Monthly Magazine, imitates their insipidities with good effect in the following specimen. 1798 *Jan. 3. MP. The APOTHEOSIS, or the SNOW-DROP . Signed "FRANCINI." 72 lines, a variant of the 64-line "Snow-drop" poem in E.H.C. pp. 356-358, there mistakenly dated 1800. As noted above, this day's issue of the Morning Post is not extant; but on the following day "the beautiful poem , by Francini, in our paper of yesterday" is commended; and Mrs. Werkmeister has now located, in the thrice-weekly Express and Evening Chronicle of January 6-9 (No. 516) the full text of the poem. For the text and an account of the collaboration that led to its discovery, see a forthcoming issue of BNYPL . (There remains a remote possibility that the MP text differed in some respect from the reprint in the Express , but authorial revision is ruled out by the fact that Coleridge was not in London at the time.) 1798 April 16. MP. The Recantation. An Ode . Line 95 reads "priesthood's" (as 4° and Poetical Register ) and not "Priestcraft's" (E.H.C. p. 247). July 30. MP. A Tale . Line 88 reads "And" not "Till" (E.H.C. p. 302). 1799 Aug. 29. MP. To a Proud Parent . (Should have been starred; E.H.C., p. 960, does not note newspaper appearance.) In line 2 " My Lud !" is italicized. *Sept. 2. MP. Epigram . "O would the Baptist come again" Unsigned. 6 lines, which E.H.C. (p. 959) believed to have been first published in Annual Anthology (1800). E.H.C. brackets the title "[NINETY-EIGHT]" as his own invention; see Wise p. 59. The only variant is "vip'rous" for "viperous" in line 3. The MS ( Notebooks , I, 432) differs in line 7. *Sept. 3. MP. Epigram . "I hold of all our vip'rous race" Unsigned. 12 lines, which E.H.C. (p. 959) believed to have been first published in Annual Anthology (1800); there they are entitled Occasioned by the Former . There are no variants except in spelling and mechanics, of which "Things" for "things," "antient" for "ancient," and " locusts " in italics are perhaps worth mentioning. The MS varies in several places ( Notebooks , I, 432). [Sept. 11. MP. Epigram . "As gay Lord Edward . . ." Unsigned. Should definitely be dropped from the canon. See Wise (p. 171): "It was written by Sir James Henry Lawrence . . . . Reprinted over the initials 'J.L.,' in The Poetical Register , 1803, Vol.iii, p. 412." It was printed in the European Magazine for July, 1799 (p. 47) as "Epigram By Sir James Lawrance, Knight of Malta." It was first collected by Mrs. H. N. Coleridge as " probably from my Father's pen," in Essays On His Own Times (1850), III, 974, see 964 n.] *Sept. 19. MP. The Lethargist and Madman. A Political Fable . "In good King Olim's reign, I've read". Unsigned. 39 lines. E.H.C. guessed 1809 as date of composition—ten years off. His text (pp. 414-416) of 45 lines and a reversed title (" The Madman and the Lethargist / An Example ") has the same original as Notebooks , I, 625 (19), from which one can see how unnecessarily E.H.C. fiddled with Coleridge's punctuation. Olim is Latin—but also German, and it suggests a German original to Professor Coburn. Her text is cited here only to illuminate differences between E.H.C. and MP. MP omits lines 1-2, 11-12, 40-45 and hence the quotation marks. Other variants, besides capitalization (Olim's and Mad Bess) and punctuation, are: 3 old King] good King MP 5 one] first MP 6 Lay] Was MP 14 true] best MP 15 ghostly] ghastly MP (and Notebooks ) 19 The other] His neighbour MP 21 when] while MP 22 Citizen ] Jacobin MP 26 sprang] sprung MP (and Notebooks ) 29 Belabr'ing] Belabouring MP 31 roll'd from every] ran from ev'ry MP 32 flying fingers fleet] "flying fingers sweet" MP 36 Slumberer] slumb'rer MP 37 half-prepared] fiercely girds MP 39 Sunk down and slept] Sunk fast asleep MP 40-45 replaced by : THE MORAL. The Allies and the French * * * Ye Fable-mongers in verse or prose; By all your hopes of Cash or Laurel, Save, O save us from the Moral. MP *Nov. 4. MP. Imitated from the German . "An Oxford brothel-house caught fire." Unsigned. Not in E.H.C. nor any collection. 7 lines, as in Notebooks , I, 625, No. 8, except for capitalization, punctuation, and 3 Leapt up] Up leapt MP 4 To quench] And quench'd MP 5 this philanthropic] this truly christian MP ?*† Nov. 9. C. Epigrams. From the German of G. E. Lessing . Unsigned. 5 couplets, not in MP but possibly an overflow from that paper and hence possibly Coleridge's. The fourth is a variant of epigrams 9 and 10 in E.H.C. p. 954 and Notebooks , I, 625, No. 7. The third is the original printing of the epigram which Erdman noted under 1803 in The Poetical Register , a variant of E.H.C. p. 953, No. 8 ( Notebooks , I, 625, No. 13). But, as Morchard Bishop has cautioned, these are not necessarily Coleridge's; they may be someone else's adaptations of the Lessing source. There is some Coleridge-like phrasing, but the impression is not enough to base ascription on. Here is the text, for consideration: On an Epigrammatist. IN his first Epigram much point is found, Bee like, he lost his sting by that one wound. Fabullus locks his iron chest with care, Lest any one should know that nothing's there. You hesitate if you shall take a wife; Do as your father did—live single all your life. Not one of all his tales I swallow, Once he spoke truth, and dup'd me hollow. Grudge leaves the poor his whole possessions nearly: He means his next of kin shall weep sincerely . [Nov. 14. MP. Epigram . "Doris can find no taste in Tea" Unsigned. This epigram belongs to Southey, as Wise correctly notes (p. 171).] * Dec. 9. MP. Epigram. On a Maiden, More Sentimental than Chaste . "Tho' forc'd to part from my sweet Will". Unsigned (but just above To a Young Lady , over the signature "LABERIUS"; the signature could cover both poems). Not previously collected. Eight lines as in Notebooks , I, 625, No. 30, except for mechanics, the italicizing of bear, image, heart, truth , and below , and: 1 dear Will] sweet Will, MP 3 heaven] Heav'n! MP 5 So oft . . . sings Nancy] These words . . . said Nancy MP * Dec. 21. C. Introduction to the Tale of the Dark Ladie . Introductory letter signed "S. T. Coleridge." Poem and letter reprinted from MP of same date. Dec. 24. MP. Ode to Georgiana . . . . E.H.C. (p. 336) has not noted that the variants he gives for lines 32 and 33 in Annual Anthology are also the readings in MP . 1800 ? * † Jan. 1. MP. Impromptu. On Candles Being Introduced While a Young Lady Was Singing . Signed "J.P." Wherefore, wherefore, most unwise, Did you bring the candles here? Why remind us we have eyes, When we wish'd to be all ear ? (Seems to be identified as Coleridge's by the signature, which is that of his "Billy Brown" verses of Feb. 5. The internal evidence is at least not negative.) * Feb. 5. MP. On a Supposed Son . "Billy Brown, how like his Father". Signed "J.P." Not previously collected. 4 lines, identical to the undeleted lines in Notebooks , I, 625, No. 31; " but thinks not so !" in italics. * June 21. C. Song, from the German of Lessing [sic]. "I ask'd my fair, one happy day," Unsigned. Curious not only because appearing ten months after first printing in MP (Aug. 27, 1799: see previous list) but also because the text is independent, a half-way version between MP and the text in Poetical Register for 1803 (correct in E.H.C. pp. 318-319). This Courier version agrees with PR in lines 4, 6, 10-12, but has this unique reading in line 5: "Laura, Lesbia, Delia, Doris," * Aug. 22. C. City News . "Last Monday all the Papers said" Unsigned. A reprint of the 12 lines in MP Sept. 18, 1799 (as in E.H.C. p. 956) with new title and the following variants: 2 Mr.--- was] Billy Pitt was surely C 3 Why, then] Ah—then 4 tenth part . . . their] tenth part . . . the 7 said report] sad report 9 Why, then] Ah—then 10 nine parts . . . their] nine parts . . . the * Sept. 6. MP , also A . and C . Air, from the Piccolomini of Schiller . Thekla (plays and sings) "The cloud doth gather, the greenwood roar". "Translated by S. T. Coleridge." 10 lines as in E.H.C. p. 653. Coleridge's translation of "Schiller's New Dramas" was advertised in MP June 17, 1800. Thekla's song was promptly (reprinted and) parodied in the Sun , September 13, 1800. * Sept. 12. C. The Dungeon . ( From the Lyrical Ballads ). * Sept. 27. A. The Dungeon, Recommended to the Perusal of the Defenders of Bastiles in Every Country . ( From the Lyrical Ballads .). The subtitle is the Albion 's contribution, evidently. Dec. 4. MP . The Two Round Spaces . Unsigned. E.H.C. (pp. 353-355) misses these MP readings: 31 those] these MP 32 sat] sate MP 1801 * July 16. C. To an Old Man . "By Mr. Coleridge." Follows 1797 text (as E.H.C. p. 93) except in mechanics and "Sarah" for "Sara." Sept. 22, 25, 26 and Dec. 1. MP . The transposition of the Greek letters in the signatures is a typographical error of our first list and not of the printers of the MP . Nov. 28. MP . Translation of a Greek Ode on Astronomy . It should have been stated that the original Greek text is given in Coleridge's Poetical Works , ed. James Dykes Campbell, London, 1903, pp. 476-477. * † Dec. 21. MP . Pastoral from Gesner . [sic] "See I the Shepherd," Unsigned. Not previously collected, but the German original appears in Notebooks , I, 396. It seems fairly safe to deduce that the translation is Coleridge's: See I the Shepherd, The bold brown Shepherd, I tell him, "Shepherd! "I will not love thee!" Ah tell me, Maidens! Who've lov'd already, There's nothing, think you, In this to alarm me, That I say it sighing , Whene'er I tell him, "Thou bold brown Shepherd, "I will not love thee." ? Dec. 26. MP. The Compliment Qualified . ( Vide Thursday's Paper .) Signed "P." Woof queries the attribution to Coleridge: Why not equally the epigram of Dec. 24 signed "O"? And then along comes one on Jan. 29, 1802, signed "Q" (with address: "British Coffee-House, Jan. 26, 1802"). 1802 Oct. 7. MP. An Ode to the Rain . Signed "EΣTHΣE." A misprint appeared in the first list: "* Here is seems" should have read "* Here it seems". There was also a mixup of the variant given for line 25 of the Wallenstein quotation, which should have read: 25 Fast fly the clouds 1800 ] Fast sail MP * Oct. 14. C. France .— An Ode . "By S. T. Coleridge." Text identical to MP of same day, but unleaded. The note ("The following Ode . . . corrected copy") is omitted. 1803 The 1803 entry in the first list should be queried; at least see above, Nov. 9, 1799.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Elizabeth Barrett and R. Shelton MacKenzie by David Bonnell Green</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although the letters of Elizabeth Barrett to Shelton Mackenzie 1 printed here for the first time do not contain startling revelations, they characteristically display her thought and opinions, her humor, and her essential femininity, 2 and they do disclose the existence of an interesting early review of her work that has not previously been known. The chances are strong that even after their exchange of letters Miss Barrett and Mackenzie never met, 3 for during her years of invalidism in London she went out infrequently and entertained few visitors. But she maintained an extensive correspondence, and it is likely that Mackenzie wrote to her without prior introduction. He was a journalist and man of letters who after a varied career in England emigrated to the United States where he settled in Philadelphia and continued his literary work. Among his projects was a biographical dictionary of living authors, and it was in connection with this venture—never brought to completion—that he wrote Miss Barrett. 4 The first letter presented is evidently not the earliest in their correspondence but makes clear enough what the course of it has been. Miss Barrett devotes the opening paragraph to her first translation of Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound and includes mention of the review of it that appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine . 5 This review is of particular interest, for unlike the brief, unfriendly notice in the Athenaeum —the only one hitherto known—it is encouraging and alludes to the shorter poems in the volume. The reviewer is plainly aware of the author's identity, and he treats her work with gentle enthusiasm. 6 The question of who the reviewer might be is an intriguing if apparently insoluble one. Edmund Henry Barker, the eccentric classical scholar, who tried at one time to ingratiate himself with Miss Barrett, is a possible candidate, although no definite evidence of any kind links him to the review. 7 Miss Barrett always refers to the reception of the volume in a disparaging way, however, and words of praise from Barker, whom she did not like, may have been unpalatable to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">50 Wimpole Street 17 Septr. 1844. 8 Dear Sir If you think it necessary to mention the translation I will not oppose it obstinately—although, being the work of twelve days, printed without a name &amp; never advertised nor reviewed, few persons, I believe, ever heard of it, &amp; still fewer ever read it. To prove to you how thoroughly I repudiate &amp; am ashamed of it, I will tell you that I have half finished a new version of the same tragedy, in order to wipe off the blot on my poetical escutcheon. 9 I love poetry too well &amp; Aeschylus too reverently, not to see as clearly as you must see, if you know the version, all its stiffness, baldness, coldness, &amp; general inadequacy. But my object was a wrong one— —the attainment of a literal rendering;—besides the immaturity of power. The only review which noticed the attempt was I think the "Gentleman's"—&amp; I think it was there, recommended to the junior idle scholars as a literaltranslationcramming book. Inglorious glory! But the version is, in fact, tolerably close &amp; accurate,—&amp;, for the rest, intolerable. As to scholastic &amp; anonymous matters, I do not know whether such a trifle as my papers 'On the Greek Christian Poets' which appeared in the Athenaeum of either last year or the year before (I fancy last year) would meet your purpose to hear of. 10 They are in plain prose, with poetical translations from the poets, &amp; are without my name,—but they drew some attention, &amp; have been referred to in general reviews of my writings— I thank you much for what you kindly &amp; encouragingly say of America,— &amp; indeed the Americans have been very kind to me, &amp; not only at New York &amp; I felt it to be a kind as well as honorable concession when a New York bookseller agreed to print in the best types &amp; paper (paying for the privilege) a work which might be snatched out of his hand by the bookseller next door &amp; printed as a tract. 11 For if they took liberties with your 'Titian,' 12 dear Sir, you must consider the state of the copyright here, &amp; how the trade is surrounded by temptations to piracy, &amp; undefended in its attempts at honesty. In fact, if the wrong is to English authors, the ruin is to American authors, who behold themselves superseded at their own hearthstones. I am taking a great liberty in writing more than a simple answer to your questions;—I return to them. It gave me too much pleasure to receive Mr. Leigh Hunt's gracious praise, 13 for me to object to your referring to it. I was born in the county of Durham, but spent the greater part of my life, &amp; from my infancy, at Hope End, Herefordshire, close to Malvern— As to dates, I never could remember one in my life — I am constantly forgetting the Annus Domini &amp; doubting myself into the middle ages. I am afraid I must be past thirty by three or four years—but your readers will not care "too curiously to enquire" which;—and your "living authors" of the feminine gender, in general, will not, I fancy, on such a point, combine to afford you information of such unlimited frankness— You will decide, as you see best, on the mention of the 'Prometheus'. I am ashamed of this abundance of light words, &amp; beg to remain, dear Sir, with much esteem. very faithfully yours Elizabeth Barrett Barrett</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the foregoing letter indicates, Elizabeth Barrett took a lively interest in the United States, an interest warmly reciprocated by many Americans. 14 And the second letter gives further evidence of her concern with American literary affairs. Cornelius Mathews, of whom she speaks, was along with Poe one of her most enthusiastic admirers and worked diligently on her behalf. 15 Her sympathy and gratitude does not, however, exclude an astringent sense of the realities, and her remarks are properly balanced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">September 22, 1844. 50 Wimpole Street Dear Sir, I must trouble you with a line in which I thank you for the kind opinion you have expressed to me of my poetry. To give me credit for truth &amp; earnestness in it, is not more, I may venture to say, than is due to one who has lived in her art from childhood to this day, &amp; who has tasted in it her sweetest experiences . . . . . she might almost say her only very sweet experiences;—of life under the earthly aspect. It is true of me indeed that I am an earnest writer,— that I write from impulse &amp; conviction of heart &amp; mind,— that my faculty, whatever it be, angel or demon, rather possesses than is possessed by me. I thank you for giving me credit for that quality of truth in my poems, without which I shd. be less than I am. Mr. Horne's notice of me was kindly intended &amp; written,— but there was no attempt in it at analysis of the character of my poetry. 16 The Quarterly did not please me, I confess, very well— 17 It is difficult, you know, for a reviewer to please his subject . The North American Review was something fuller— 18 but the attempts at critical analysis in respect to me, have certainly not found any particular favor in my sight. My last volumes having, according to my own impression far more maturity of mind &amp; power in them than the 'Seraphim' book, I am presumptuous enough to hope for more fulness in the judgment likely to be held on them &amp; there has yet been only time for a gust of newspaper criticism, ruffling the leaves,— 19 Your observations upon American literature are precisely suitable, I think, to the case, —and I particularly agree with you on the matter of its being no compliment to be called the 'Mrs. Hemans of America'. That Mrs. Sigourney shd. have been ruffled at all by your remark, proves . . does it not? . . the American view of things,— &amp; their ignoble indifference towards their own individuality in letters? If you never read a little volume of poems "On Man" by Cornelius Matthews of New York, 20 I wd. recommend it to you as a rare instance of exception from the ordinary smooth run, on a beaten road, of American poetry. It is defective in grace,— &amp; perhaps in clearness,— but it is strong &amp; bold &amp; suggestive, &amp;, as a transatlantic production, is on those grounds, a curiosity. When Mrs. Sigourney was in England she did me the honour of writing a letter to me once,— but I am not acquainted with her otherwise, either personally or by correspondence. 21 I hold that Dr. Channing &amp; Emerson are the two greatest names for letters which America has yet given us. Add another,— Cooper's,— Which reminds me that I am preparing to read your 'Titian' with the advantage of a personal association,— I am very fond of romances,— and the class called 'ArtNovels,' is full of interest to me.

      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The best sketch of Mackenzie (1809-1881) is that by Albert C. Baugh in the DAB ; see also DNB . 2 W. O. Raymond in a review of Gardner B. Taplin, The Life of Elizabeth Barrett Browning ( Victorian Studies , I [1957], 96) has recently said of her letters: "Their sparkle, charm, and easy, graceful style are as delightful as their naturalness and sincerity." 3 She did not know him "personally" at that time: see The Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning , ed. Frederic G. Kenyon (1898), I, 200. 4 Ibid . 5 CLIII (June 1833), 610-611. 6 He writes: "As this very interesting volume modestly presents itself to our notice without a name, we deem it uncourteous to break the studied silence of the author, or to say more than that it is to a female pen we are indebted for what we believe to be absolutely unique in English literature—an attempt on the part of a young lady to translate a play of Aeschylus; and who, if report speaks truly, has read every word of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; and this, too, ere she is well out of her teens. . . . For ourselves . . . the appearance of a volume, that reminds us of the days of a Dacier and Carter, cannot fail to be highly welcome. . . ." After quoting a specimen of the translation he concludes: "By comparing this version with the original, it will be seen that our author has, to use her own words, 'kept as closely to the sense, as was poetically possible'; and so little, indeed, has she swerved, not only here, but through the whole play, from her purpose, that every reader of the Prometheus, who wants a crib-book , would do well to bind up this translation with the Greek text, in lieu of the literal prose Latin or English version usually put into the hands of their pupils by the teachers of the March-of-Intellect area. "As regards the Miscellaneous Poems attached to the translation of the Prometheus, and for which the authoress pleads so prettily in her preface, we are free to confess that to our taste they are the gems of the volume." 7 It was through Barker, however, that the volume was published by Barker's friend A. J. Valpy: see Elizabeth Barrett to Mr Boyd, Unpublished Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning to Hugh Stuart Boyd , ed. Barbara P. McCarthy (1955), p. 158. The letters generally contain numerous references to Barker. 8 I wish to thank Messrs. John Murray, holders of the Browning copyright, and Mr. R. Norris Williams, 2d, and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania for their kind permission to publish this and the following letter, and Mr. Williams and the Society to print excerpts from the letters of Cornelius Mathews of November 26, 1842 and July 26, 1843. I should also like to thank the Haverford College Library for permission to publish the excerpt from the Mathews' letter of March 30, 1843, which is in the Roberts Collection. 9 This second version was finished in 1845 and included in the Poems of 1850; see Taplin, Life of Elizabeth Barret Browning (1957), pp. 230-232. 10 "Some Account of the Greek Christian Poets," Athenaeum , Feb. 26, 1842, pp. 189-190; Mar. 5, 1842, pp. 210-212; Mar. 12, 1842, pp. 229-231; Mar. 19, 1842, pp. 249-252. These were later collected in The Greek Christian Poets and the English Poets (London, 1863), pp. 1-103. 11 Cornelius Mathews arranged for Henry G. Langley to publish the book in America, where it was given the title A Drama of Exile: and Other Poems (New York, 1844); see Taplin, p. 109. 12 Titian, A Romance of Venice , 3 vols.

Excerpts from three unpublished letters of Mathews to Rufus W. Griswold give additional demonstration of his interest. He writes on November 26, 1842: "Be good enough not to forget the [word illegible] 3 or 4 extra copies of Dec. Graham for Miss Barrett— I see this lady, by the by, announced as a regular contributor to your Magazine. Have you opened any correspondence—? I am about to write to her in a few days &amp; if you wish any proposition laid before her I shall be happy to serve you." And on March 30, 1843: "On enquiry at Mr. Wiley I learn that Mr. Putnam (his partner) is not in funds at London to honor a draft in favour of Miss Barret, for Mr. Graham. The proper &amp; briefest method of adjusting the matter will be remitting to me $52—in current funds which will cover the draft, postage, Messr. Wiley &amp; Putnam's comission. Be good enough to have Mr. Graham do this at once ." On July 26, 1843, he writes: "You will oblige me by stating in what manner the claim of Miss Barrett on Graham's Mage. has been arranged? I beg to ask an immediate answer, &amp;, as I desire that no farther unpleasant feeling shall grow of this matter I trust it will be, a satisfactory one." For Miss Barrett and Griswold, see further Taplin, p. 135. In another letter to Griswold, October 28, 1844, printed in Passages from the Correspondence and Other Papers of Rufus W. Griswold , ed. W. M. Griswold (1898), p. 233, Mathews reveals that Evart A. Duyckinck is the author of the review of the 1844 Poems in the American Whig Review , I (Jan. 1845), 38-48, and indicates that Griswold wrote the review appearing in Graham's Magazine , XXVI (Jan. 1845), 46-47. 16 Perhaps the chapters on her, written by R. H. Horne, in A New Spirit of the Age (1844), II, 131-140, although she seemingly is referring to a review of The Seraphim, and Other Poems . It may be that Horne wrote the review of that work in the Monthly Chronicle , II (1838), 195, but, if so, the review does not correspond very well with her description of it. 17 John Gibson Lockhart wrote the review in the Quarterly , LXVI (1840), 382-389. 18 LV (1842), 201-218, possibly by George Stillman Hillard. 19 Such as those in John Bull , Aug. 31, 1844, pp. 551-552, the Atlas , Aug. 31, 1844, pp. 593-594, to which she refers elsewhere ( Letters , ed.

      <field name="heading_text">Elias Burling, A Call to Back-Sliding Israel , New York, 1694: An Unrecorded Tract Printed by William Bradford by A. N. L. Munby</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The purpose of this brief note is to draw attention to a New York-printed pamphlet, apparently unrecorded hitherto, which has recently been acquired by Cambridge University Library. It would ill become an English librarian, who has handled a couple of Bradford imprints in his life, to make any pronouncement on the pamphlet's place in the Bradford canon: and it would be still less appropriate for him to attempt to assess its position in the intricate mosaic of controversial literature occasioned by George Keith's secession from the orthodox Quakers in late seventeenth-century New England. These matters will, I hope, receive the attention they deserve from specialists; and in the meantime I offer a physical description of the tract and some notes on the provenance of this copy. Coll. 8 0 A-C 4 ; $2, A1 and A2 unsigned, A3 wrongly signed A2. 12 leaves, pp. [1-4] 3-20 [2], 10 misprinted 01, pagination in round brackets. A1 recto and verso blank. A2 recto title, verso blank. A3 recto (signed A2) to C1 verso text. C2 recto to C3 verso postscript, signed E.B. C4 recto and verso blank. The paper has vertical chain-lines and a cropped watermark at the head of the last leaf only, a fleur-de-lys in a pointed shield (not in Heawood). The type size is pica , roman and italic, with thirty-one lines to a full page, excluding pagination and catchword. Twenty lines of text measure eighty-two millimetres. The format, watermark, chain-lines and surviving deckles on $1 and 2 are consistent with octavo printing by half-sheet imposition. 1 The pages, trimmed at the upper and lower edges, measure 5¾ x 3½ inches, indicating a sheet measuring at least 11½ x 14 inches. The pamphlet has been stabbed and sewn, the original light grey wrappers surviving. The text, which is addressed 'to the inhabitants of Burlington etc.', is one of those trenchant and hard-hitting pleas for love and unity with which students of ecclesiastical controversy will be familiar. The author cudgels his opponents with a well-knotted olive branch, vigorously supporting the cause of George Keith and accusing his opponents, "a Scorn to Fools, and a Reproach justly among the Heathen", of disrupting the unity of the Friends. The Postscript adds examples of the "denial of Christ" by the orthodox Quakers, in particular their opposition to G. Hutcheson's testimony. The pamphlet, which bears no note of previous ownership, came to light in the parish library of Broughton, a little village not far from St. Ives in the County of Huntingdonshire. This collection, consisting of about eight hundred bound volumes and a large group of unbound pamphlets, was almost exclusively composed of divinity books of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, and contained a sizeable assemblage of Quaker tracts. Many of the books bear the inscription "The Rev. Mr. W. Torkington's gift", others the names of Robert Hodson senior and Robert Hodson. William Torkington, of St. John's College, Cambridge, was Rector from 1705 to 1737 of the village of Wistow, Hunts., not far from Broughton, and his will, which was proved in the Court of the Archdeaconry of Huntingdon is preserved in the Hunts. County Record Office. ". . . Also I give and bequeath to the Reverend Mr. Hodson of Broughton in the County of Huntington all my printed Books of which he hath none of the kind towards the setting up a publick Library." Torkington's books therefore reached Broughton at his death in 1737. Three generations of the Hodson family provided Broughton with Rectors for over a century, with one short break; Robert senior, a member of Magdalene College, Cambridge, from 1668 to his death in 1680, Benjamin, also of Magdalene, from 1680 to 1697 and Robert junior, of Jesus College, from 1713 to 1774. The will of the last, also in the Hunts. County Record Office, throws more light on the books at Broughton. It is dated 8 January 1772 and after certain bequests to "Philippe Holmes Spinster the Niece of my Friend Mr. John Cox deceased now living with me" it adds:— And likewise I give to the said Philippe Holmes all my printed Books (except such of them as shall be in the Possession of my aforesaid Nephew Robert Hodson at my Death) to be by her plac'd in my Library in the Chancel of the Parish Church of Broughton aforesaid and I do hereby give to the said Philippe Holmes Forty Pounds to enable her to place the Books in proper Cases there and to make such Alterations in the Room of the Library as I have directed her to make. A codicil dated 19 November 1773 confirms the placing of the books in the chancel but revokes the bequest of forty pounds, "I having in my Lifetime been at the Expence of procuring proper Cases for their Reception." Time dealt hardly with Mr. Hodson's "publick Library". The Victorian restorers in their zeal for emptying the churches banished it from the chancel and in due course it was housed in a room at the top of the tower, where the books were exposed to damp and, when I first saw them in 1956, were coated deep with a century's dirt and pigeon droppings. To the enterprise of the present Rector, the Rev. Norman Marshall, must go the credit for the subsequent salvage operations. By a Faculty dated 21 July 1958 the Chancellor of the Diocese of Ely gave his permission for the collection to be transferred to Cambridge University Library, where it is now in the process of being catalogued.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Some Remarks on the Extant Manuscripts of Hawthorne's Short Stories by Seymour L. Gross and Alfred J. Levy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Because Hawthorne's short stories were published in an era when authors did not have the close control over their manuscripts that they enjoy today, there has always been some question among Hawthorne scholars of just how reliable the texts of the tales are. Frank Luther Mott has noted in writing of the period in which Hawthorne did his magazine and gift-book publishing that the "rights of the author . . . in the products of his pen were little recognized when once he had turned his manuscript over to the editor." 1 John M. Mason, for example, the editor of Christian's Magazine , piously announced in his "Prospectus" (1806) that as editor "he will feel himself not only at liberty, but under obligation, to make such alterations in the pieces which may be offered for insertion, as he shall judge expedient." A rather egregious example of editorial high-handedness was the action of the editor of Holden's Dollar Magazine (in which Hawthorne's "Ethan Brand" appeared in May, 1851), who, when J. H. Dugannes refused to finish his serialized story, The Atheist , until he was paid, blithely finished the story himself. 2 Nor is Hawthorne silent on the problem of editorial fiddling. In a letter to the New York editor, C. W. Webber, Hawthorne irritably comments, "I am as tractable an author as you ever knew, so far as putting my articles into the fire goes; though I cannot abide alterations or omission." 3 And again in "P.'s Correspondence," P. asks Hawthorne, ". . . do those infernal compositors and proof readers misprint your unfortunate productions as vilely as ever?" In view of the general editorial policy of the era and Hawthorne's objection to it, it seemed profitable to undertake a comparison of the extant manuscripts of Hawthorne's short pieces with their first published versions. Unfortunately, after extended search, we were able to turn up only four manuscripts: "The Wedding Knell" ( The Token , 1836), "Earth's Holocaust" ( Graham's Magazine , May, 1844), "The Snow Image" ( International Magazine , October, 1850), and "Feathertop" ( International Magazine , Feb.-March, 1852). 4 Four manuscripts (out of a possible one hundred or more), needless to say, hardly constitute an occasion for reliable generalization. But we have assumed that some evidence, cautiously interpreted, is better than none at all. Although they are spread over a fourteen-year period, the manuscripts of "The Wedding Knell," "Earth's Holocaust," and "The Snow Image" reveal certain consistencies in the editorial revision they underwent. ("Feathertop," except for three typographical errors, completely follows the manuscript, the reasons for which we will speculate on in a moment.) For one thing, Hawthorne was far more conservative in his punctuation than Goodrich of The Token , Graham of Graham's , or Griswold of International Magazine wanted him to be. There are about 100 instances in the three stories of an editorial lightening of punctuation—usually from a comma to no mark at all, or, more infrequently, from a semicolon or dash to a comma. Hawthorne was likewise more conservative (or old-fashioned) in his choice of spelling than the editors to whom he submitted his work. For example, in "Earth's Holocaust," staunch (adj.) is changed to stanch , and worshipper to worshiper ; in "The Snow Image," sate and skipt become sat and skipped ; in "The Wedding Knell," the editor preferred stepped, diverse , and stopped to Hawthorne's stept, divers , and stopt . 5 The Americanizing of Hawthorne's spellings is, most probably, another reflection of the desire for an American literature, a cause strenuously ballyhooed in American magazines and annuals in the first half of the nineteenth century. The manuscripts also clearly demonstrate Hawthorne's predilection for generic capitalization—a practice of which the editors did not approve. This tendency shows up most noticeably in the parabolic "Earth's Holocaust," where the editor reduced no less than fourteen of Hawthorne's capitalizations, including such terms as Last Toper, Child of Dust, Immortality, Eternity, Last Thief, Last Murderer, Evil Principle, Heart , and so on. Similarly, in "The Snow Image," Providence is put into the lower case, as is Time in "The Wedding Knell." 6 Evidently Hawthorne's typically allegorical cast of mind led him to capitalize many abstract terms and epithets which he wished to be taken as representative; his editors, however, probably wished to make these tales somewhat less removed from common terminology by their de-emphasis. From such evidence as is available in these three manuscripts, we should conjecture that this procedure (as well as that of changing his spelling and reducing his punctuation) was one of the things to which Hawthorne explicitly objected. The manuscripts turn up very few editorial changes in Hawthorne's diction, certainly never a major alteration which would significantly affect the meaning of a passage. The majority of these revisions occur in "The Snow Image." Where Hawthorne wrote "Violet . . . was struck with a new idea ," Griswold changed the last word (reasonably, since Violet is a child) to thought . Griswold made another reasonable change. In describing the Snow Image (whose objective reality is always kept extremely ambiguous) Hawthorne wrote that she was "dressed all in white, with rose-tinged cheeks and ringlets of golden hair ." The "hair" is too concrete to maintain the ambiguity of the Snow Image's existence and so Griswold changed it to hue (which can more easily be accounted for by "the bright, blinding dazzle of the sun"). The other changes simply involved the cutting out of some excess words: e.g. handsome as possible to handsome , and may prove to be absolute to may prove absolute . Perhaps the most interesting change in diction occurs in "The Wedding Knell." At one point in the story Hawthorne asks of the decrepit couple who are about to be married after forty years, "But why had she returned to him, when their cold hearts shrank from each other's touch?" The somber, sexless touch is connotatively correct for a "hoary bridegroom in his shroud [and his] aged bride," but Goodrich, following the sentimentalized diction of the gift-book tradition, changed it to embrace , which is tonally all wrong. 7 We may now come to the problem of why Rufus Wilmot Griswold made ten changes in "The Snow Image," but left "Feathertop" absolutely unaltered. Early in 1850 Griswold asked Hawthorne for a contribution for the volume memorializing the recently deceased Mrs. Osgood, and Hawthorne authorized James T. Fields to sell him "The Snow Image." But several months before the tale appeared in the memorial volume (1851), it appeared in Griswold's International Magazine . 8 Some time in 1851 Griswold asked Hawthorne to write a series of twelve stories for the International ; but Hawthorne, now a reasonably successful novelist and utterly disgusted with tale writing, which he called "the most unprofitable business in the world," refused and sent him instead "Feathertop," which he had written several years before. 9 It is possible that Griswold's faithful following of the manuscript of the story was part of an attempt to get Hawthorne to change his mind about writing the series, a motive which did not enter into his earlier revision of "The Snow Image." All four manuscripts are almost certainly the final copies which Hawthorne submitted to the editors. 10 As such, they exhibit fewer revisions than we would expect from Hawthorne, who, like Poe, was a reviser. 11 Even so, Hawthorne made more changes in his manuscript—at least in the matters of diction and phrasing—than did his editors. The majority of the twenty-nine changes seem to be arbitrary: e.g. a thrill to a swell of exalted sentiment; pealed to poured forth an anthem; she had been left to she found herself again a widow ("The Wedding Knell"); reach to attain; there to in that spot; with their aprons to holding their aprons ("Earth's Holocaust"); good to kind lady; cold-pinched to frost-pinched ("The Snow Image"); face to countenance; only to merely; image to picture; answered to said; examine to analyze ("Feathertop"). Occasionally, however, Hawthorne's revisions decidedly clarified his intentions. In "The Wedding Knell," Hawthorne altered his description of Mr. Ellenwood from diseased sensitiveness to diseased sensibility , a change which helps to point up the emotional derangement of that wild eccentric's "abortive life." In "Feathertop," the eeriness of Mother Rigby, the witch, is heightened by having her supernatural powers described as singular rather than remarkable , and by having her have made rather than merely have seen devil dolls of all sorts. (One revision, however, works against the grotesque intention: there is something more macabre about the witch's having skinny palms rather than the more literally accurate skinny hands , which was Hawthorne's final choice.) Perhaps the most significant manuscript revision is to be found in "The Snow Image." In describing Mr. Lindsay, that well-intentioned, "common-sensible" destroyer of the imaginative world, Hawthorne originally wrote that he "was glad to get back to his wife and children and his quiet home." Hawthorne then deleted the reference to the wife and children. This deletion helps to prepare us for Lindsay's "stubborn materialism," which keeps him from committing himself to the imaginative life of his family and makes him cruelly, though unwittingly, annihilate their imaginative vision of life, as it is symbolized by the Snow Image. On the basis of the four available manuscripts of Hawthorne's short stories, it is difficult to see the reason for Hawthorne's annoyance with his editors. The frequent changes in capitalization and rare changes in diction are the only revisions that affected the meaning, and then only slightly. But, after all, one can hardly blame an author for wanting his work to be printed precisely as he wrote it. What we regret, of course, is that more manuscripts were not available so that this study might not be so extremely tentative.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Imposition Figures and Plate Gangs in The Rescue by Matthew J. Bruccoli and Charles A. Rheault, Jr. *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It would not have been wholly frivolous to entitle this note "The Case of the Unnecessary Numbers," for the problem at hand provides an example of how the bibliographer's pursuit of the seemingly trivial can lead to the uncovering of useful information about printing-shop techniques. Joseph Conrad's The Rescue was originally published in America by Doubleday, Page in 1920; a second edition was published in the same year in England by J. M. Dent &amp; Sons. A first impression of forty copies from standing type was distributed by Dent for review. These have the status of proofs, for the text was revised by Conrad before plates were made for the trade impression. But in addition to textual alterations, a curious system of numbers was also introduced before the book was plated. These figures, which first appear in the Dent second impression, are in the lower right-hand corners of certain pages. Although a few are absent it is clear that they constitute three cycles of thirty-two numbers, each cycle being repeated every eight gatherings. For example, in the first cycle: Signature Page Key Figure A 1 7 2 23 3 17 4 1 5 3 6 19 7 21 8 5 9-16 -- B 17-32 -- C 33 15 34 [31] 35 [25] 36 9 37 [11] 38 27 39 29 40 13 41-48 -- D 49-64 -- E 65 8 66 24 67 18 68 2 69 [4] 70 20 71 22 72 6 73-80 -- F 81-96 -- G 97 [16] 98 32 99 26 100 10 101 12 102 28 103 30 104 [1]4 105-112 -- H 113-128 -- These figures are not signatures (the book is signed A-I, K-U, X-Z, 2A-2C 8 ), and the figures could not have been of any use to the compositor or publisher. The remaining possibility, that the figures were imposition keys, was put forward by T. J. Wise: "These are control numbers; they were inserted in the stereo-plates as a guide to the pressman when laying them down for the printing machine." 1 It is noteworthy that Wise is the only Conrad bibliographer to mention these figures. The plates were cast by the firm of Richard Clay, and Wise had reason to be familiar with Clay's operations because his fabrications were printed by Clay. It remained only to test the explanation by dummying up an imposition, but no arrangement of the individual plates yielded a meaningful sequence for the pages with the key figures. The fact that only 25% of the pages have the figures suggested that the pages were ganged—i.e., four pages were cast as a single large plate and reckoned as one plate in the imposition. This is represented in the charts for the inner and outer formes—with the key figures greatly enlarged. The book was intended to be printed sixty-four pages up (but only 16 ganged plates). Each sheet would have been slit in half on press and then slit on the folding machine into four sections. A standard machine folding (quad not insert) would then yield four sixteen-page gatherings from each half-sheet, folded twice parallel and once at right angles. Gangs have long been in regular use in England for rotary press work, but they have been used only infrequently and experimentally in the United States. When the actual ritual of a pressman laying out his pages is reviewed, the time saving represented by gangs becomes apparent. On receiving his pages as plates from the foundry, the pressman first divides them into two stacks. One will be used to print one side of the sheet, the other for "back-up." He also divides these two stacks into groups of thirty-two or sixty-four each, depending on how many can be accommodated by the press bed. Next, carrying the plates to either the front or back forme (or cylinder), he proceeds to lay them out—not in a row, but rather: one at the bottom, one at the top, two in the middle; then he switches to the next row with two in the middle, one at the top, and ends with one on the bottom next to the starting point; and so on across the forme. Next the plates have to be fastened securely and accurately, probably with two catches on each side—a total of 512 small adjustments for a sixty-four page forme. This is for only one side of the sheet, of course. By ganging four pages together, the number of adjustments per forme is reduced to 128. The English printer may have hit upon the idea of increasing efficiency still further by marking the press bed or cylinder with a key figure and then putting that same figure on the gang. Nothing more difficult than matching numbers would be required of the pressman. After imposition, the key figure could easily be chipped off or pounded flat. The reason why the figures survived in this case is that The Rescue was not in fact printed as planned . The gangs were made at Clay's Chaucer Press in Bungay for printing on a Goss rotary press at their London plant, the Cornwall Press. For reasons now obscure, the printing was actually done at the Temple Press in Letchworth, where flat plates were cast. 2 The Temple Press workmen, being unfamiliar with the use of imposition figures, failed to remove them when printing the trade copies of The Rescue —the only instance in which they have been noted. Although the American printing industry's lack of enthusiasm for plate gangs seems perverse, examination of the problem indicates that the savings expected from this method may be more apparent than actual. Experiments conducted by eastern printing houses have shown that the additional time required for imposing the pages for gang plate making wiped out some of the savings anticipated in the first printing. In effect, press-room costs were transferred to the composing room. The difficulty in handling and storing gangs is also a deterrent. Even more important is the fact that the American equivalent of the Goss rotary press was not introduced for book printing until after the second world war. Profitable operation of these presses requires big runs (25,000-50,000 copies); such printing orders are unusual for a first printing—and the first printing is where the savings from ganged plates would be expected. The factor of cheaper labor in England probably makes the use of the Goss rotary press practical for smaller runs. The nature of ganged plates must also be considered. Once they are made, there can be no change in imposition. Of course, a one-page cancel cannot be printed without printing all four pages on the gang. The owner of the plates would be able to lease or sell the gangs only to a publisher who was equipped for the work. The final factor acting against gangs is the introduction of positive formes in American printing. The acceptance by publishers of minor irregularities (1/32") in line-up or register prepared the way for the general use of fixed catches on the press bed. The positive forme method requires only four catch adjustments per plate, the other four catches being permanently attached to the bed. The result is that the number of adjustments required for a sixty-four page forme is 256 instead of 512. 3 The experiments with imposition figures and plate gangs in The Rescue were, finally, just experiments. New methods and different publishing standards make it most unlikely that these experiments will be repeated. But for the bibliographer, at least, the second impression of the second edition of The Rescue makes for an intriguing volume.</field>
