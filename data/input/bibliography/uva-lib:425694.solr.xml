      <field name="heading_text">New Approaches to Textual Problems in Shakespeare by Philip Williams, Jr. *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of the most promising approaches to the textual problems in Shakespeare is the study of those compositors who from manuscript copy first set the plays in type. In the transmission of the texts, these type-setters played a role the importance of which can hardly be overemphasized: if they were literal and painstaking, they reproduced relatively accurately the manuscript from which they worked; if they were inept, careless, or intent on improving their copy, the printed texts differed considerably from their manuscript copy. Thus in a given text we may find what a printing house employee thought Shakespeare wrote, or what he thought Shakespeare might have written, or—more disastrous still—what a printing house employee thought Shakespeare should have written, rather than what he actually wrote. In what follows I shall not discuss the methods by which compositors can be identified, but assuming that identification is possible, I should like to examine some of the implications of compositor analysis and related bibliographical techniques for the texts of Shakespeare. I shall here be concerned with those plays in the 1623 folio that were set from manuscript rather than printed copy. For purposes of illustration, I shall rely mainly on the histories, although the comedies or tragedies would serve equally well: the same or related textual problems are encountered in all three sections of the first folio. One of the weaknesses in editing Shakespeare has been a tendency to specialize: a single editor does one play. While such a procedure has much in its favor, it sometimes seems to prevent the editor's bringing to bear on the problems of his text a detailed knowledge of other related textual problems. Those editors who, like Dover Wilson and Peter Alexander, have worked their way through the texts of many plays have each been able to make important contributions that might have been beyond the scope of the editor of a single play. The texts of the twenty-four plays that, according to Sir Walter Greg, were set from manuscript copy in the First Folio should be studied collectively as well as singly, just as those plays set from annotated quartos must be studied as a group as well as individually. Only when studied in this way can we obtain reliable information about the hypothetical editor of the folio, for example, and the character of his work. To make deductions about his editorial practices on the basis of the study of a single play is almost useless. The value of this broader approach is amply demonstrated by Dr. Alice Walker's Textual Problems of the First Folio . For our purposes, it is unfortunate that William Jaggard printed so few plays. Unlike Okes, Simmes, and Eld, for example, the Jaggards did not specialize in drama. In the ten years from 1617 to 1627, no plays (except those in the First Folio) were printed from manuscript copy in their shop. In 1619, however, William Jaggard had printed ten plays for Thomas Pavier, but the so-called Pavier collection consists entirely of reprints of quartos that had appeared earlier. If instead of turning out rather pompous heraldries, histories, and books on theology, Jaggard had printed first editions of plays, these texts would serve as useful checks and controls for conclusions about how his compositors handled manuscript dramatic copy. The study of these compositors in Jaggard's shop has had a brief yet significant history. In 1920, Mr. Thomas Satchell published in The Times Literary Supplement some observations on the spellings in the folio text of Macbeth , noting that some words consistently spelled in one way in the first part of the play were consistently spelled differently in the latter part. Satchell's deductions from these observations were modest: he simply raised the question whether the variant spellings were to be explained by a change in the manuscript copy or by a change in the compositors who set the type. Dr. Willoughby, in 1928, supplied the answer: the different spellings in Macbeth were to be explained by the habits of two compositors whom he distinguished as A and B, and some (but not all) of the spelling differences in Macbeth could be used to identify their work in other parts of the folio. Dr. Willoughby found these two compositors at work in The Tempest , with which the folio opens, and in Troilus and Cressida , the last of the plays to be printed. Although the importance of Willoughby's discovery should have been immediately recognized, compositor determination and analysis was almost completely neglected until an important article by Professor Hinman in 1940 stimulated interest in the subject. Since then, the study of the folio compositors has received considerable attention both here and in England. The unfortunate neglect of the subject following the publication of Dr. Willoughby's monograph resulted in serious defects in several important editions of Shakespeare. Professor Shaaber, for example, in his almost model Variorum edition of 2 Henry IV , did not make use of compositor determination and analysis. Had he done so, the vexing problem of the exact relationship of the quarto and folio texts might have been solved then and there. Since the publication of the Variorum edition in 1940, Dr. Walker has argued that the folio text was set from an annotated quarto; Professor Shaaber has re-affirmed his earlier position that the folio text was set from a manuscript having independent authority. The implications of this controversy for the editor are of course considerable. In view of the basic disagreement between two outstanding authorities, the relationship of the quarto and folio texts will have to be re-examined. There are indications that neither Dr. Walker nor Professor Shaaber is wholly correct. As Professor Bowers has observed, the quarto and folio texts are clearly not independent as Professor Shaaber believed, and yet an annotated quarto can hardly have served directly as copy for the folio text. The abnormal spellings of both compositors A and B are not consistent with such a theory. Printed copy exerted a greater influence on the compositors than did manuscript and caused them to deviate from their normal practices, but the abnormal spellings in 2 Henry IV cannot be accounted for by the quarto text. The most likely explanation now seems to be that the copy for the folio text of 2 Henry IV was neither an independent manuscript nor an annotated quarto but rather a manuscript transcript of a quarto annotated for use in the theater. But until the work of the two compositors has been competently analyzed, the answer to this puzzling question must remain in doubt. Whatever the answer may be, I am confident that it will not be achieved without the use of compositor analysis. But deductions based on even the most detailed study of a single text are at best hazardous and at worst dangerously misleading and wrong. After his remarkably thorough study of the Hamlet texts, Professor Dover Wilson concluded that the good second quarto had been set from Shakespeare's foul papers by a hurried compositor—perhaps a dishonest Welshman—who could not work quickly because he had not mastered his craft. On this theory, Wilson constructed his complex textual and critical structure. Professor Wilson's single harried compositor now turns out to have been two men, both regular compositors in Roberts's shop, and both competent workmen at that. I once made an outrageous generalization about a minor point in the folio text of Troilus and Cressida . In the Troilus quarto the spelling of the exclamation oh varies, apparently indiscriminately, between o and oh . The folio text reproduces this variation with remarkable fidelity. I used this evidence, validly I think, to support my theory that the folio text had been set directly from a corrected copy of the quarto, but I added that the usual spelling of both folio compositors seemed to be o on the basis of my analysis of their work in Julius Caesar . It is true that the spelling in Julius Caesar is o , but it is likewise true that in The Comedy of Errors , another play set by the same two compositors, the spelling is oh . For reasons that I now do not pretend to understand, the folio compositors generally reproduced the copy spellings of this form. I can not seriously believe that two compositors mutually decided to use one spelling for one play, another for a second, and to mix the two spellings in a third. These o and oh spellings must then represent the spellings found in the copy, and because they do, they shed some light on the underlying manuscripts. It would be useful to know what Shakespeare's own usage was. Unfortunately the Hand D of Sir Thomas More (which I accept as Shakespeare's) is not much help, for the form appears only once, spelled o . But I would suggest that the answer is not beyond the reach of the analytical bibliographer. The good second quarto of Romeo and Juliet was almost certainly set from Shakespeare's foul papers. A study of Thomas Creede's compositors (not in this text alone but of their total output) might reveal that they generally reproduced the copy spelling without imposing personal idiosyncracies. If so, we might establish that Shakespeare, in his early career at least, used one spelling or the other, or both indiscriminately. We could then apply this evidence to the folio text of King John , which Sir Walter Greg believes was printed partly from Shakespeare's foul papers and partly from prompt copy. In the first three acts (which may have been set from foul papers) the spelling is o ; in the last two acts, the spelling is predominantly oh . Knowing how conservatively Compositors A and B treated this form, we should have a neat, and I think rather convincing, bit of evidence to support Greg's theory about the copy for King John . For the later period, a like study of the second quarto of Hamlet might be applied to Timon of Athens to support Greg's belief that Timon was set from unfinished foul papers, or my belief that it was set from a fair transcript made by the same scribe who prepared the manuscript from which the folio text of Coriolanus was set. The trivia of analytical bibliography can sometimes be put to good use. The text of King John will serve to illustrate another use which compositor analysis can serve. Although he found it "difficult to envisage a composite manuscript actually made up partly of foul papers and partly of a section of the prompt-book," Sir Walter discovered what seemed to be confirmation of sorts when he noted that "in the first three acts the directions tend to appear a line or two late, in the others a line or two early." The fact that some pages of King John were set by Compositor A and others by Compositor B raises some question as to the significance of Greg's evidence. There are, at the very most, twelve stage directions (of which two are very doubtful) that can be described as being either early or late. The ten certain ones occur on pages set by Compositor A; the two doubtful ones on pages set by Compositor B. Judging from his work throughout the folio, Compositor A tended to reproduce the copy position of directions, whereas B tended to normalize and was reluctant to interrupt a speech to insert even a needed stage-direction. Greg's theory therefore receives very little support from the positions of these stage directions, for the variation is better explained by the typographical practices of the two compositors who set the folio text. If indeed there was a change in the character of the manuscript copy from which the folio text of King John was set, the evidence to establish the fact will be found by an analysis of the eight pages in Acts I, II, and III set by Compositor A as compared with the four pages in Acts IV and V set by the same compositor. Because Compositor B reproduced the accidentals of his copy less faithfully, the pages set by him are less likely to produce helpful evidence, but compositor analysis can certainly help to elucidate the textual problems of this play. My discussion so far has been based on the assumption that in the transmission of the text from manuscript copy to type, some characteristics of the manuscript were preserved, perhaps quite inadvertently. This palimpsest of the underlying manuscript is fainter in the work of Compositor B, stronger in the work of Compositor A. The folio text of Titus Andronicus furnishes a useful illustration to support the validity of the basic assumption. Titus Andronicus was not, of course, set from manuscript in the First Folio: the folio text was set from a copy of the third quarto of 1611. But one scene in the folio text (III.2) does not appear in any of the preceding quartos and must therefore have been set from manuscript copy. Had no copy of the three earlier quartos survived, it would nevertheless have been possible to show that the copy for Act III, scene 2, differed from the copy for the rest of the play. In this scene the name Tamora is spelled with an i ; in a speech-heading Andronicus is used rather than Titus , and—more interesting—the word upon which appears four times in this short scene is each time spelled with a double p —a spelling that is extremely rare elsewhere in the First Folio. Because of the weight that I would have the textual scholar attach to such apparently trivial evidence, it is reassuring to have this one example that has the unquestioned check of external evidence. One would like to see what compositor analysis can reveal about the troublesome Hecate scenes in Macbeth or the Fool's distasteful prophecy in Lear . Unfortunately, both were set by Compositor B who may well have obscured any traces of a change in copy. The three parts of Henry VI present problems that may be insoluble; certainly at present they are far from solution. All three parts were set from manuscript in the First Folio, but for parts 2 and 3, some use was made of the earlier corrupt quartos which the folio texts supersede. No version of Part 1—whether memorial reconstruction or early draft—had previously appeared in print. It is Part 1 that I wish briefly to consider for what compositor analysis can and what it can not contribute to the study of this text. Of the folio text, Sir Walter Greg writes: "Many directions are elaborate and descriptive; most noticeably so in the first two acts, but 'Enter in skirmish with bloody pates' is a nice example from the third, and the closely following 'Begin again' also suggests the author. Several . . . [directions] begin with 'Here': this has an archaic appearance and may be a personal peculiarity. . . . Instances are confined to the first act, except for one in the third . . . . As in other early plays we seem to have an authorial manuscript used with little modification as prompt copy. Either composite authorship or revision would explain certain contradictions and inconsistencies in the text. Whether the copy itself was 'heterogeneous' is uncertain. . . ." We now know that the text of 1 Henry VI was set by Compositors A and B. The former set all of Acts I, II, and III save for the first 46 lines of Act II; Compositor B set all of Acts IV and V save for page 113 which is the work of A. The unusual features of the text (including the 'Here' directions) that Greg comments on are all found on pages set by Compositor A. Such directions may, as Greg suggests, be a personal peculiarity of one of the disputed hands in the play, and one wonders if the absence of the unusual directions in Acts IV and V is not to be explained by Compositor B's revamping the directions of his copy. He was, as we know from his work elsewhere, quite capable of doing so. But the most striking textual anomaly of 1 Henry VI can not be attributed to the two compositors and their differing practices. The act division is very imperfect and irregular: only Acts III and IV are divided into scenes, and Act V consists of a single 108-line scene. Credit for the introduction of scene division can not be given Compositor B, nor can the absence of division be blamed on Compositor A, for having set Acts I and II without division, Compositor A set all of Act III, which is divided into four scenes. It is incredible that having set two acts without scene division, Compositor A should have introduced the convention with the third act. We are therefore left with the puzzle of manuscript copy with scene division in Acts III and IV only. If this anomaly does indicate a change in the manuscript copy for 1 Henry VI , analysis of Compositor A's work in Acts I and II compared with his work in Act III should disclose it. The evidence may be slight, but because of the literalness with which he followed copy, a change, if there was one, should be demonstrable. I cite the following as examples of the kind of evidence that should be brought forward to support such a theory. In Acts I and II, Burgundy is invariably spelled with a d , but when the name appears in Act III (coinciding with the introduction of scene division) Compositor A consistently uses the spelling Burgonie . Even more striking is the treatment of the name of Joan of Arc. In undivided Act I, Compositor A consistently spells the name Puzel for the eighteen times that it occurs in directions, speech-headings, and text. But in divided Act III, in which the name appears twenty-six times, he invariably spells it Pucell . In short, the name appears spelled with a z in the pages before scene division, and spelled with a c (by both compositors) in the pages after scene division is introduced. Because the change is not due to a shift in compositors, and because Compositor A was literal in such matters, it is safe to conclude that the change represents a spelling change in the manuscript. Coinciding as it does with the introduction of scene division, the obvious conclusion is that there was some change in the manuscript at the beginning of Act III. When corroborated by additional evidence of this kind, it will be possible to refine Greg's statement "Whether the copy itself was 'heterogeneous' is uncertain." The copy for 1 Henry VI was almost certainly heterogeneous. But evidence of this kind can be very tricky and must be handled judiciously. In this same play, for example, two spellings for the name Joan are used: Joane and Jone . At first sight it might appear that this variation is as significant as the Puzel—Pucell variation, but such is not the case. The o spellings all appear on pages set by Compositor B; the oa spellings on pages set by A. Without the check of compositor analysis, a naive scholar might well fall into the error of attempting further to disintegrate the text on the basis of these variant spellings. Henry VIII , the last of the histories, offers an even better illustration of the curb that compositor analysis can put on unbridled and injudicious speculation. If the bibliographer cannot solve the principal problem of this play, he can at least lay solid foundations upon which other disciplines can build. The problem here, of course, is divided authorship. When Alfred Lord Tennyson remarked to his friend James Spedding that "many passages in Henry VIII were very much in the manner of Fletcher," he set up a puzzle that has fascinated Shakespearians ever since. Spedding—who was a scholar—took the poet's hint and made a 'stylistic' analysis, publishing his findings in The Gentleman's Magazine for August, 1850. To Shakespeare he assigned Act I, scenes 1 and 2; Act II, scenes 3 and 4; Act III, scene 2, lines 1-203; and Act V, scene 1. This division, corroborated by many subsequent studies, has been generally accepted. To distinguish the hands of Shakespeare and Fletcher, Professor Thorndike later developed and applied the ' em vs. them test; Dr. Partridge analyzed other contracted forms; and Professor Oras, in a study published only last year, found confirmation for the traditional assignments to Shakespeare and Fletcher. Among recognized authorities, only Professor Alexander has held out for single and Shakespearian authorship. His argument, however, is far from convincing: the 'stylistic' differences that have so often been reduced to statistics do exist; they are in the printed text to be counted, analyzed, and interpreted as one sees fit. In all the counting and tabulating that has been done, not one of the investigators has been aware that the folio text of Henry VIII was set in type by two compositors with very different working habits and very different ways of treating some of the data that have been subjected to statistical study. Henry VIII occupies about twenty-seven pages in the folio. Of the twelve pages attributed to Shakespeare, Compositor B set seven and Compositor A set five; of the fifteen non-Shakespearian pages, B set six and Compositor A set nine. It is therefore significant, in the vocabulary of statistics, that of the sixty-six 'em's found in the text, fifty-five appear on pages set by Compositor A, and only eleven on pages set by Compositor B. The conclusion is, I think, inescapable: Compositor A reproduced his copy more literally than did B who, taking expected liberties, normalized many of his copy spellings to them . If the paucity of 'em's in the pages set by Compositor B represents the compositor's sophistication of copy rather than a Shakespearian characteristic in the copy from which he worked, I am afraid that in a text worked on by Compositor B any division between Shakespeare and Fletcher on the basis of this test is of questionable value and may be dangerously misleading. Another characteristic that has been used to distinguish the hands of Shakespeare and Fletcher is Fletcher's well established fondness for the pronoun ye . On the pages set by Compositor B, we find that the ratio is 208 you's to 25 ye's , or eight to one. On the pages set by Compositor A, the ratio is 191 to 48, or four to one. In other words, the ratio between you and ye is almost exactly twice as great on A pages as it is on B pages. John Fletcher may have had a preference for 'em and ye , but we can be sure that the anonymous Compositor B of Jaggard's shop was not William Shakespeare. I do not mean to suggest that the differences between what are generally called the Shakespearian parts of Henry VIII and the non-Shake-spearian parts are all to be explained away by the practices of the two folio compositors. The differences in the play are most striking, and Tennyson's ear was a good one. But I would insist that no stylistic analysis of Henry VIII can be satisfactory that is not based on a knowledge of the two compositors, the pages they set, and their practices, not only in this play but throughout the folio. I have illustrated some of the many uses that compositor analysis can serve in solving problems in the text of Shakespeare. The most important use (from the editor's point of view) has not been mentioned: the number and kinds of errors that the different compositors were likely to make. The uses to which this relatively new approach can be put are so varied that there has been no need for me to poach on what has become Dr. Walker's particular territory. But almost as important for the editor is the information that compositor analysis can supply about the character of the manuscripts from which the folio texts were set. When we find a compositor consistently tending to mix his spellings of words for which he has an established preferential spelling, it is safe to conclude that the aberrant forms represent copy spellings. If, in a single play, Compositor A consistently gives up his characteristic deare-deuel-young spellings while retaining other characteristic spellings of his own, he presumably did so because of the influence exerted by his copy. When Compositor B intersperses frequent deuell-young-Weele spellings, the same conclusion seems inescapable. After compositor spellings have been isolated and the copy spellings established, the manuscripts from which the folio texts were set can be grouped according to common spelling characteristics. We may find one group of manuscripts characterized by the chain of doe-heere-honour-Wee'll (and so on) spellings; another group by do-here-honor-Wee'l . A third group will, I suspect, be related by short spellings of wil , shal , tel and the like, a marked preference for final ie instead of y , and the long spelling of pronouns ending in e . When we find Compositor A spelling to the as toth' (one word) in Macbeth and Coriolanus , and nowhere else in the folio, we have strong evidence linking the manuscripts from which these two plays were set. And when we find the pages set by Compositor A in Henry VIII and Hamlet characterized by a phenomenally great number of semi-colons, quite in excess of his usual usage, we have a link between the manuscripts which is supported by his aberrant spelling Wee'l etc. in both texts. When the varnish of the folio compositors has been removed, the grain of the underlying manuscripts will be revealed in its true color. Then, and not until then, shall we have exhausted the evidence possible about the kinds of copy from which these plays were set. I may be too optimistic, but I venture to hope that when the job is done, we shall be able to distinguish those plays which were set from Shakespeare's holograph from those set from scribal transcripts, and to assign with some certainty the transcripts to the scribes who made them. A good place to start will be with the five plays which are now thought to have been set from transcripts made by Ralph Crane. The extant manuscripts in his hand will first have to be studied not only to isolate his personal idiosyncracies that may show through in the folio texts, but also to establish the latitude of variation that can be expected in his work. In spite of similarities, there are marked differences in his work as exemplified, for example, by the manuscript of Barnavelt and the Bodleian manuscript of A Game at Chess . When the spade work has been done, we may find absolutely convincing evidence to support Greg's hypothesis that The Tempest , The Two Gentlemen of Verona , The Merry Wives of Windsor , Measure for Measure , and The Winter's Tale were set from Crane manuscripts—or we may find something else. Until the possibilities of compositor analysis are fully exploited, we can not be sure. Having spoken at such length about the importance of compositor analysis, it is embarrassing to own up to some of its deficiencies and to point out difficulties that, in the case of the Jaggard compositors, have yet to be overcome. Neither Dr. Walker nor I have yet been able satisfactorily to identify the compositor who set the folio texts of Titus Andronicus and Romeo and Juliet and whose work we suspect in other plays. * While Compositor B remained remarkably stable and changed very little from 1619, when he worked on the Pavier collection, through 1623 and the last play printed in the folio, Compositor A, who was more sensitive to copy, is more difficult to isolate. There are long stretches in the folio that may have been set by Compositor A or that may have been set by a third compositor whose work, either because of copy influence or because of his own A-type characteristics, closely resembles Compositor A's work. The deficiencies in spelling tests based on a few words only have been well demonstrated. On some pages the key words simply do not appear, or appear so infrequently as to be of little use. What is wanted is a fuller list of preferential spellings, supplemented for Compositor A by a list of copy spellings that he would tolerate and that B would not. Neither compositor was willing to reproduce Crane's habitual spelling theis for these , but there are many spellings that A might reproduce but which B would balk at. Although a great deal of work remains to be done before we shall have perfected the techniques by which Jaggard's compositors can be pin-pointed, there is every reason to believe that the effort will be successful, especially so if supported by other investigations that the analytical bibliographer can make. ** An analysis of the press work of the First Folio is urgently needed. If Dr. Walker is correct in her assumption that Compositors A and B followed their copy more closely when working rapidly, it follows that we should like to know when the compositors were hurried by the press or presses. I should like to see corroborative mechanical evidence to explain the almost literatim faithfulness with which the folio reproduces the quarto texts of Much Ado About Nothing and Titus Andronicus , if hurried composition is indeed the answer. Or, from many important examples that come to mind, to cite a minor one: the use of white-space in the folio should be investigated. It is surprising how often act or scene division coincides with the top of a column. In King John , six of the sixteen divisions are found in this position. In addition to other ways of conserving or wasting space, the compositor could leave white-space above and below stage directions. Sometimes he left space above and below, sometimes above only, and sometimes none at all. This practice explains the loose appearance of Compositor B's page 305 in Lear and the tighter appearance of the same compositor's page 135 in Macbeth . The subject has never been investigated, but a study might reveal that some of the copy for the folio was looked over and roughly counted off before it reached the compositors. Unless it was known by pre-arrangement that Compositor A was to take over in Hamlet at II.2.219, it is difficult to explain why Compositor B stretched out the prose speeches of Polonius and Hamlet into irregular lines of verse at the bottom of 003. If copy for the folio was first read over by the printer for this purpose, perhaps other indications to guide the compositors were made at the same time. Sir Walter Greg suggested long ago that it may have been the printer rather than the illusive folio editor who removed some of the profanity from certain of the 1623 texts. The more closely compositor analysis is related to other approaches, the more productive it will be. It can support the paleographer who attempts to recover manuscript spellings by analysis of errors caused by misreading Elizabethan handwriting. The linguist who brings order out of the seeming chaos of Elizabethan spelling can be of great help. Is the quarto spelling arre ( Troilus and Cressida , I.3.392) a compositor's error and therefore to be emended, or is it an acceptable spelling of a 17th-century variant form of the folio's tarre ? Is there any real significance in the folio's alternation between does and do's , or is it just chance that in Hamlet the contracted form is used in unstressed syllables and the full form in stressed? Anyone interested in Shakespeare's prosody would like to know. Much of the bibliographical work that remains to be done for the text of Shakespeare may seem terribly time-consuming and unrewarding. Much of it certainly is. The collation of the extant copies of the 1609 Troilus and Cressida quarto revealed only the most trivial and uninteresting variants. But until the job was done, the editor of this play—if he had a conscience—had qualms when he spoke of "the quarto reading," for he could not be sure. All of this tedious collation and analysis must be done. The task is not more overwhelming (although it may be more complex) than that presented by the text of Chaucer. The Chicago Chaucer was undertaken, and the Chaucer scholar has a text for which he need not apologize—as we must today for the antiquated Old Cambridge edition of Shakespeare, reproduced substantially in recent years by Kittredge, Neilson, Harrison, Craig, and others. Inexpensive old-spelling editions of Milton are readily available, and few of us would care to read Paradise Lost in a modernized text. When an old-spelling edition of Shakespeare finally does appear, the study of the compositors in the dozen shops where substantive editions of Shakespeare were printed, will have contributed to the excellence of this badly needed edition.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Editorial Problems in Shakespeare: Semi-Popular Editions by Arthur Brown *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The difficulty of attempting to define what is meant by a semipopular edition of Shakespeare is perhaps best overcome by the use of a few examples. I have had particularly in mind for the purpose of this paper—although the list is not intended to be anything like a complete one—such multi-volume editions as the Arden Shakespeare, the Yale Shakespeare, and Dover Wilson's New Cambridge Shakespeare, and such one-volume editions as that produced by Peter Alexander, or, more recently, by Charles Sisson. These all have certain characteristics in common, though they naturally differ in the emphasis which they give to each of these characteristics. The most obvious point is that they all give the text of the plays in modernised spelling, with at times a little variation in the point at which the line is drawn between complete modernisation and the retention of what to the editor appear to be the more interesting Elizabethan spellings, a subject which will require further attention later. In the second place, some of them make available to a greater or lesser degree variant readings from the earlier editions from the sixteenth century onwards; the Arden Shakespeare generally attempts a full collation of quartos and folios, and a fairly full collation of subsequent editions, while Dover Wilson and Charles Sisson, on the other hand, are content to note and discuss only one or two of the more outstanding examples of variant readings in each play, usually where some important question of interpretation is involved. 1 Thirdly, there is often some attempt to give the reader a picture of the textual history of each play, ranging from the brilliant, if at times erratic, hypotheses of Dover Wilson, to the more conservative introductions of the Arden volumes, some of these, perhaps, so conservative as to show that the editor in question is out of touch with modern developments in this field. Finally, these editions attempt, by means of introductions, notes, appendices, and glossaries to make available more general information by means of which the readers' appreciation of the plays may be enhanced. In short, it may be said of these editions that their aim has been to combine scholarship with popular appeal, almost to bring Shakespeare 'out of Closets and Libraries, Schools and Colleges, to dwell in Clubs and Assemblies, at Tea Tables and in Coffee Houses', or their modern equivalents. The editor of this kind of edition is faced from the start by a very difficult problem, which is perhaps best demonstrated by reference to the two classes of reviewer into whose hands his work will fall, the one praising him for having made Shakespeare and Shakespearean scholarship more widely available to the general reader, the other doubting whether the general reader will in fact profit much from these efforts on his behalf. The point is a fundamental one, determining to a considerable extent the approach of such an editor to his work, and even leading some critics to question the whole basis upon which these editions have been established. It was raised acutely in a review by Miss W. M. T. Dodds of the New Cambridge 1 Henry IV in Modern Language Review , 1947. She first listed the aims and methods of the edition: (1) to advance textual study; (2) to advance the literary appreciation of the general reader; (3) to present to the general reader a text embodying the results of specialist methods at present beyond that reader's ken; (4) to give due weight to literary considerations, as well as to strict textual analysis, in arriving at an established text. She then pointed out that, considered individually, these aims and methods were unexceptionable, but that within the limits of a single edition they were incompatible. 'As long as critical method kept within the comprehension of the general reader,' she says, 'and editors were in fact required to be no more than especially gifted general readers, they could in one and the same edition appeal to scholar and general reader alike. But the newer critical methods of the scholar are beyond the ken of the general reader; therefore what must be offered him is decision. One cannot at the same time offer the scholar what he needs, the material for decision—the presentation of alternatives, specialised debate, and tentative solution offered for consideration.' This challenge has never, apparently, been seriously taken up. It has certainly had little effect on the New Cambridge editors, and Arden editors, while being reminded that their volumes are intended primarily for the use of undergraduates in English Universities and for teachers of senior forms in schools—neither class, surely, being able to lay claim to much acquaintance with the methods of the new critics or of the modern bibliographers—are nevertheless required to include 'adequate and if possible impartial discussion of textual problems . . . giving due, but not undue, attention to the most recent work in the field', to give very full collations of earlier editions, and to be aware of the most advanced thought in the field, for example, of Shakespearean imagery. More recently Charles Sisson, while keeping fairly clear of such matters, has nevertheless thought fit to introduce questions of Elizabethan handwriting to the general reader, and both he and Peter Alexander have considered that the preliminary matter of the First Folio, a notorious source of much misunderstanding, also forms suitable material for the same reader. They may be right; but the trouble which seems to underlie all these semi-popular editions to some degree is the simple fact that editors are working not with any class of reader clearly in mind, but in order to give expression to their own particular interests, their own private line of business in the great Shakespeare industry; and the result is editing for the sake of the editor, not the reader. To some extent this is inevitable, and editors cannot be required to suppress entirely their personal beliefs, idiosyncracies, preferences, or interests; but what should be a cardinal principle in this semi-popular editing is that editors should be aware that their responsibilities are far greater than those of scholars who are presenting material primarily for the consideration of other scholars. Their readers will be much more inclined to accept their word as the last word on the subject; lacking the discipline which enables a scholar to distinguish between true and false reasoning, between the significant and the non-significant, they may be led by almost every volume so far mentioned into some strange beliefs about Shakespeare and his plays. It will be convenient to see how this principle of editorial responsibility works out in connection with certain other problems confronting the editor of a semi-popular edition of Shakespeare. In his choice of text, naturally, he has no option but to proceed according to the soundest textual and bibliographical principles; whether a reader is well versed in Shakespearean scholarship or not is immaterial here—he is entitled in any case to be treated honestly, and provided with a text which is as close as scholarship can make it to the intentions of the author. It ought to be unnecessary to labour this point, but it is pertinent to recall that as recently as 1950 R. C. Bald drew attention to the fact that two new college Shakespeares , prepared by two of the most distinguished Shakespearean scholars in the United States, and 'bound to exert a strong influence on the teaching of Shakespeare for a generation or so', reproduced the Globe text 2 ; and although wiser counsels prevailed, the publishers of the Arden Shakespeare were prepared to retain in the new volumes the stereotype plates of the text as it appeared in the original Arden series, making only minor alterations where absolutely necessary. As Bald remarked, such an attitude would be understandable only if there had been no advances in the textual study of Shakespeare during the present century, and this clearly is far from being the case. The original Cambridge editors, with all respect to the fine work they did, can no longer be regarded as supplying the best text for any class of reader, although even within the last year one volume at least has specifically advertised its reliance on this authority. How far should the editor of a semi-popular edition attempt to justify his choice of text, or to present any kind of discussion of the textual background of the play? This, surely, is one of the matters upon which the general reader requires decisions, not arguments. Any attempt to pour the dry wine of bibliography down his throat will only succeed in choking him, and any attempt to weaken the draught by watering it down will only give him a totally false impression of his capacity to absorb the stuff. This means, therefore, that the editor must do all the hard work in advance, and must be prepared to sacrifice all his labours, his arguments, and his theories for the sake of an authoritative statement of conclusions; the scholarly journal is the place for the other material. This is, perhaps, one of the editor's most difficult tasks; the desire to argue, to flourish evidence triumphantly, is one of the strongest temptations of the scholar. It is well to bear in mind, however, in this connection, Dr. Shaaber's remarks before the English Institute in 1947 on good and bad Shakespearean texts; in picking out what he considered to be some of the best modern texts he remarked, 'That they are the best, the average reader would never recognise . . . the difference is visible only to an experienced eye.' Nor can it be expected that this reader will be any more sensitive to fine argument on the subject. In this respect, the New Cambridge and the Arden editors have sinned exceedingly; the former has overloaded his pages with arguments and evidence which could be of interest or value only to the scholar, and with conclusions which could only mystify and often mislead the general reader; the Arden editors have gone astray in almost as many directions as there have been editors, ranging from the lack of comprehension of the significance of press variants brought to light by Dr. Hinman's collation of multiple copies of the First Folio, to an imprecise, if full, recording of the bibliographical and technical data pertinent to the text of Titus Andronicus —and of the latter Sir Walter Greg remarked in a review 3 that the account of some of the phenomena is too condensed to be intelligible; if this is the effect on Sir Walter, what of the reader to whom this edition is allegedly appealing? Similarly T. M. Parrott, reviewing the Arden Love's Labour's Lost , was forced to conclude that 'as the play stands in this, or in any other edition, instead of giving the delight it should, it presents a puzzle to the general reader and offers a battle-ground for scholarly critics.' 4 All these cases suggest lack of clarity in the minds of the editors about the kind of edition they are producing, and lead one to suspect that they have been more concerned with the fullest possible expression of their own ideas on a selection only of the many matters which ought to be of editorial concern than with the ultimate effect of the edition upon the reader interested in Shakespeare. It would be possible to speak at length of the problems arising during the process of modernising the spelling of the plays, and indeed on the question whether this process is any longer worthwhile. One has at times more than a vague suspicion that the habit has more to do with the continued reliance of many semi-popular editions upon the traditional Cambridge text than with the alleged difficulties that an old-spelling text would present to the general reader. But this is beside the point at the moment; most modern editions are committed to modernised spelling, and the General Editor of the Arden series has made the principle involved quite clear: 'To present a reliable text within the limits imposed by modernisation'. Sir Walter Greg, in the review of the Arden Titus Andronicus previously mentioned, discusses some of the resulting problems. 'While necessarily modernising spelling,' he says, 'he [the editor] retains what he regards as distinct early forms, like murther, banket , and vild , and would, I suppose, have kept fadom had it occurred. At the same time he refuses tortering , and so would, I suppose, reject venter ; what would he do with the well authenticated form totter for tatter ? As he says, consistency is hardly attainable, and it is difficult to draw the line. He very sensibly refuses to reduce and to an when it means if , but how when the original reads an't or an if , both of which occur in the Folio?' For the present writer, at least, complete modernisation as far as this is attainable has seemed to be the right principle, and he is happy to find agreement from Dr. Alice Walker in this matter. 5 Problems remain, none the less. What, for example, is an editor to do when a rhyme requires the retention of a form murther ? or when, as in Midsummer Night's Dream , the forms murther and murder lanthorn and lantern occur in adjacent lines? If, as in some editions, lanthorn is retained at one point for the sake of an alleged pun, is it inconsistent to reject it elsewhere? There is, of course, little excuse for the juggling with forms which occurs on one occasion in the New Cambridge 2 Henry IV , where the editor, anxious to retain what he presumably thought of as a Shakespearean spelling berod for 'bear-herd' (although what the general reader would make of such a spelling it is difficult to say), actually transfers from Much Ado About Nothing the even more complicated spelling berrord 'for the sake of consistency.' There is not room to discuss here the confusion between alleged Shakespearean spellings and what are, in fact, compositors' habits, a subject on which Dr. Walker, in the paper already referred to, has spoken with some authority, but it is clearly something which an editor must have very much in mind. The way of the modernised spelling editor is hard compared with that of his old spelling colleague; the points mentioned so far may be small ones, but they occur frequently and require a decision each time, and the cumulative effect is wearying! Consider also the use of the apostrophe before final s , a mark which did not come into general use until late in the seventeenth century; the modernised spelling editor is constantly coming up against words which require the decision—singular or plural, and sometimes the decision on whether the contraction for is is not the right answer. Lysander in Midsummer Night's Dream , pleading his claim to Hermia against Demetrius, says I am, my lord, as well derived as he, As well possessed; my love is more than his; My fortunes every way as fairly ranked. . . . Does he mean 'my fortune is every way as fairly ranked', thus forming a parallel to 'my love is more than his', or are we to take fortunes as a plural with the verb are understood? Editors from Rowe onward are fairly evenly divided on these possible interpretations; the old spelling editor would not need to make up his mind since he can print fortunes from the quartos and folios with a clear conscience, and leave it at that. In the same play Titania urges her fairies to steal the honey bags from the humble bees, And, for night tapers, crop their waxen thighs, And light them at the fiery glow-worms eyes. . . . One glow worm, or more than one? The former has usually won editorial favour, I think, but the latter has been urged in order to form a parallel with humble bees . Bottom, having received the acclamations of the fairies, replies, 'I cry your worships mercy heartily. I beseech your worships name.' The context makes it clear that the second use of worships is addressed to Cobweb only, but there remains honest doubt whether the first is addressed to all the fairies or already directed at Cobweb only. None of these illustrations are of grave importance, but they do help to emphasise the question of editorial responsibility once more; the editor of an old spelling reprint need not worry about them; the editor of a scholarly critical edition might feel that some comment is called for, some justification of his decision in each case, but he could console himself with the knowledge that his scholarly readers were in possession of sufficient evidence to make up their own minds. Is the editor of a semi-popular text justified in bringing such questions to the attention of his readers? Surely he would do better to make up his own mind and present his readers with decisions; which means that in all honesty he must be as certain as he can be that he has made the right decision, whether the question be one of the number of glow worms or of much greater significance. And this principle applies to the whole mass of detail which arises in the process of transforming the less restricted spelling habits of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries into the standardised forms of our own day. If spelling is to be modernised, there can be little justification for expecting the general reader to be edified, or even impressed, by any attempt to retain the punctuation of quarto or folio. McKerrow seems to have had the two things in mind together when he remarked of the punctuation of the First Folio that 'though it is undoubtedly less regular than we are accustomed to nowadays, it really presents no more difficulty than the old spelling does, while it often suggests the way in which a speech is intended to be uttered more clearly than does the more "logical" punctuation of the modern texts.' 6 This is true enough, but one may nevertheless doubt whether a reading public which seems to require modernised spelling will be able to make very much of what is at times the quite subtle dramatic punctuation of quartos and folios. (One might add as a parenthesis that there is also a temptation to suspect that here too, as in the case of strange spellings, the alleged subtlety may sometimes exist rather in the mind of the scholar contemplating the text than in any conscious intent on the part of the compositor, still less of the author; but this is another question.) The editor is also faced with the problem of the modern attitude towards punctuation, which regards it often enough neither as a dramatic device nor as a grammatical discipline, but at best merely as a concession to practicality in the avoidance of complete misunderstanding—and even this is not always achieved—or at worst as sheer pedantry. Whether we like it or not, we are faced with a reading public which, like Peter Quince, 'Knows not the stop', or at least knows no stop beyond the point and an occasional haphazard comma, and the seed of dramatic punctuation, if too liberally scattered in semi-popular editions, is likely to fall on stony ground. It may have been with the idea of getting at least some of it on more fertile soil that Dover Wilson multiplied each grain by four, but it is difficult to believe that the horrid rash of points which disfigures his pages as a result is really the best answer to the problem. In one respect, the modern distaste for niceties of punctuation is an advantage in that it enables an editor to get away with considerably lighter punctuation than he could have done some fifty years ago, and thus in a sense he may be able to give more of an impression of dramatic presentation to the speeches than if he were compelled to observe the requirements of a stricter grammatical tradition. As an example might be instanced some of the speeches of Puck in Midsummer Night's Dream , where the sense is so clear in any case that they could almost be printed without any punctuation at all, but which require at the most only the lightest sprinkling of commas and the occasional stop to fulfill the demands of the dramatist and the grammarian, and to avoid offence to even the most rabid of the 'no pedantry' school. The principle upon which the editor must work, therefore, is fairly clear; he cannot hope for many readers capable of appreciating the retention of much original punctuation on dramatic grounds, and in any case, if he has once given way over the spelling, it seems merely quixotic for him to make a stand at this point; in the second place, the plays clearly do not call for the application of strict grammatical punctuation, which would be difficult to impose and, for better or for worse, out of touch with modern trends. Once again the question of responsibility arises, and the editor himself must decide, to the satisfaction at least of his own conscience, without any attempt at justification in the volume itself, just how a passage ought to be interpreted, bearing in mind naturally the pointing of the original editions, and how best this interpretation may be presented in terms of modern practices of punctuation. 7 If this sounds like an involved statement of the obvious, the critic should look again at what can happen in the New Cambridge Shakespeare when originality takes over. Faced with the problem of act and scene divisions, Dover Wilson has, on the other hand, given a more satisfactory answer. Two apparently opposed facts have to be dealt with; the first, that most of the divisions have probably little authority as far as Shakespeare is concerned, and little to do with the actual presentation of the play; the second, that they have been traditionally accepted in practically all editions from Rowe's on, and serve as a useful means of reference. Dr. Shaaber, in his paper before the English Institute in 1947, seemed to hint that for scholarly editions he would prefer to see all this apparatus abandoned; but probably for the editions under discussion a discreet removal of these divisions from the centre of the body of the text, where they draw too much attention to themselves, to one of the margins, where they may still serve their only purpose and harm no one, is the best solution. It does, in fact, seem improbable that the general reader will be affected for better or for worse either by their rejection or by their retention, but there is little point in calling his attention too closely to them. Certainly there need be no discussion in these editions about the editors' ideas on the 'right places' for these traditional divisions, and to load one's collations with the various opinions on the matter seems to be a singularly useless proceeding. Once more let the editor select what divisions he will, and keep them discretely proportionate to the text. The problem of collation is not one which should concern the editor of a semi-popular edition to any great extent, but it seems that here too the tradition established by the original Cambridge editors is having too much influence, especially, for example, in the case of the Arden series. Clearly in a full scale Variorum edition the job needs to be done thoroughly, completely, and accurately, although even here one may, in the last resort and over matters of importance, legitimately take leave to doubt the infallibility of the editor and consult the original texts—in fact, what textual critic worthy of the name will not do this frequently? Still, it is useful to have all the material of this nature pertaining to one play at hand in a single volume. Is there, however, much of a case to be made for the inclusion of any degree of collation in a semi-popular edition, let alone the somewhat elaborate apparatus of the Arden volumes? If the full collation of the Variorum is abandoned, what is the purpose of a partial collation? It is, of course, to give the authority for readings printed in the text, and to provide a selection of other possible readings which the editor thinks worthy of consideration. Regarding the authority for readings printed in the text, it has already been suggested that this is a matter upon which the editor is required to present his readers with decisions which they can accept, not with evidence which they are not trained to weigh, nor with argument which they are not trained to follow. Possibly something could be said for the inclusion of other readings thought by the editor worthy of consideration, particularly in cases of serious corruption in the text; but these may be included as part of the commentary, and should in any case be kept to a minimum. It should once more be the editor's responsibility to sift the available material, and to present, if he feels that the occasion requires it, only those readings which, bearing in mind palaeographical and bibliographical considerations, have some chance of being connected with what Shakespeare may have written. We are still carrying far too much dead wood in the way of conjectural emendations from the later folios and the eighteenth century editors, and certainly our semi-popular editions should not be made the vehicle for these. 8 With regard to the apparatus of a more general nature—explanatory notes on text and collations, notes on obscure passages, on Elizabethan vocabulary and syntax, general literary comment on the play itself, its action, imagery, and so forth—clearly there is a great temptation to think that the general reader will need as much of this as the editor can possibly cram in. It is to be hoped that there will soon be a complete disappearance of the editor whom Fredson Bowers castigates as 'not caring too much about his text because all he needs is a peg on which to hang his annotations', 9 but there is still danger from the editor whose mind has become a veritable rag-bag of odd tags of information and more recondite allusions which he is determined to drag in at all costs whenever an occasion presents itself—and sometimes without an occasion; still danger from what Bowers again has called 'wilful haring after the idly speculative'. The General Editor of the Arden series writes in her Preface to the Macbeth volume that it is the purpose of the edition to offer readers 'as much as could be presented in brief and intelligible form of the immense body of scholarship which the first half of the twentieth century has contributed to the field of Shakespeare studies.' This is an admirable enough purpose on the face of it, but one fraught with danger for editor and reader alike. The former, unless he exercises the strictest possible control over himself, will be submerged under the mass of material that seems to clamour for inclusion, and will be hard put to it to separate the wheat from the chaff. Sir Walter Greg hints at the problem in his review of the Arden Titus Andronicus : 'I must not embark upon a discussion of the commentary', he says, 'which is professedly "designed to meet the requirements of relatively elementary as well as of more advanced students", beyond recording my impression that along with much that is acute and useful, there is not a little that could be dispensed with.' The danger of attempting to appeal to elementary and advanced students within the limits of a single volume has already been mentioned in connection with textual and bibliographical material, and it is a danger present also in connection with the more general commentary; if a reader can be choked with dry wine, he can also be made very uncomfortable with a surfeit of clotted cream, and it is probably better to say too little than too much. 10 It should not be necessary—though some recent examples seem to suggest that it unfortunately is—to insist that the editor should deal fairly with his readers, and, whatever his private opinion may be, should not make something appear to be fact which is still no more than conjecture. It is very easy to do this, particularly when the objections to a theory may appear to be purely academic and the space is short. But it must be emphasised that it is from this kind of edition that a great many people get their initial ideas and impressions about Shakespeare, and it should surely be worthwhile to take the trouble to ensure that these ideas and impressions are as free as they can be from the possibility of error and misunderstanding. In this connection the very difficult problem of alleged topical allusions in Love's Labour's Lost may be cited as a single example, though many more could be given; this problem, revived in the most recent edition of the play, has there been presented in such a way as either to mislead the general reader quite seriously as to the nature of the play, or at least to confuse him almost beyond hope of recovery. This is admittedly an extreme case, but a model example of the kind of occasion on which editorial responsibility needs to be of a very high order indeed; it illustrates well almost all the pitfalls, literary and bibliographical, which lie in wait for an editor, and almost all the ways in which the non-scholarly reader in particular can receive distorted notions about Shakespeare. The editing of Shakespeare—and indeed the editing of any seventeenth century author—has reached an important stage of development, and before any further progress is attempted it is well to take stock of the situation. The present century has seen great advances in critical interpretation and appreciation of the texts, in the understanding of the technical processes by which the texts were made available to readers, and in the knowledge of the general historical background which affected their production at all stages. In addition, it is scarcely any longer possible to say, as Dr. Shaaber did in 1947, that 'there are possibly not more than thirty men alive, in English speaking countries, who have edited a play of Shakespeare, and this happy band of brothers is not likely to grow much larger in the near future.' The band is growing, for various reasons, nor perhaps is it accurate any longer to speak of it as a happy band! Shaaber was right to talk of the editing of Shakespeare as 'a highly specialised industry', but for better or for worse we are faced with a great increase in the number of specialists and would-be specialists, who seem increasingly to regard editing as a happy hunting ground for the exercise of their peculiar talents. Both textual and critical studies suffer from them, and the trouble lies in their refusal to recognise their limitations, to see that the language they speak may be incomprehensible to ninety per cent of their readers. There is no great danger as long as they confine themselves to lecturing their fellow specialists, but when they take upon themselves the task of bringing the light to non-specialist readers their crusading enthusiasm often leads them either to include excessive amounts of material, not always well digested, or to attempt such a degree of popularisation as to lead their readers into a false sense of security. This paper is an appeal to those who undertake to supply the demand for semi-popular editions of Shakespeare for a greater sense of editorial responsibility, arising from a clear understanding of the limitations of the prospective readers—and there need be nothing patronising about such an understanding—an appeal for a willingness on the part of an editor to state conclusions without a lengthy demonstration of his cleverness in reaching them; for a realisation that writing for non-specialists does not mean either that they must be forcibly fed with rich food and left to digest it or take the consequences, or that popularisation implies the neglect, or at least the glossing over, of conclusions established by scholarship. The task calls for considerable self-discipline, for a degree of suppression of a too exuberant editorial personality in favour of a sober and authoritative presentation of reliable conclusions. The appeal is for more common sense and less virtuosity (in its meaning of excessive attention to technique), for a retention of the high standards of scholarship without a too ostentatious display of the material rewards of this virtue. There is little fear that the scholarly world, in its present highly competitive state, will be grossly misled by its more brilliant light; but there is considerable danger that the general reader will gain, from work at present being made available to him, either nothing at all of any value for his peculiar requirements, or entirely false impressions of what the scholars are doing, or, worst of all, of what Shakespeare was doing. The demand for semi-popular editions of Shakespeare is not likely to diminish; we ought, in all fairness, to see that it is honestly met.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes * Read before the English Institute on 13 September 1954. 1 It should be added that Sisson proposes to publish as a separate work two volumes of more detailed commentary and justification of the readings adopted in his text.

R. Ridley in the Arden edition of Antony and Cleopatra : 'In the early texts we have, pretty certainly, at least "playhouse" punctuation, and very possibly a great deal of Shakespeare's own. . . . No editor can desert it without very careful consideration. . . . An alteration in the original punctuation should be regarded as no less an emendation than a change in a word, and should be felt to need the same kind of justification.' Earlier in this Introduction, however, Mr. Ridley seems to suggest that there are differences between punctuation for the stage and punctuation for a reading text. 8 The case for the full collation of the later folios is stated by Frank Kermode in the Arden edition of The Tempest : 'The variants of the three later folios are fully recorded; not of course because they have such contact with the copy as might give them authority . . . but because they illustrate the mechanical progress of that corruption which vitiated the copy of the early eighteenth century editors, and the first rather undiscriminating attempt to castigate the text of errors surviving from manuscript as well as errors acquired in the process of transmission. The readings are, I think, of interest to anyone who wishes to familiarise himself with the antecedents of modern textual criticism.' All of which is perfectly true, but hardly consistent with the stated purpose of the Arden series. 9 Studies in Bibliography III (1950-1), 61. 10 In fairness, attention is drawn to the following statement on the apparatus criticus of Antony and Cleopatra edited in the Arden series by M. R. Ridley: 'This I have considerably lightened. In an edition such as this . . . it is important that what is given should be readily comprehensible, and should not obscure salient points by a cloud of minor ones. . . . I have tried to keep in mind . . . the student who is in the early or prentice days of his study of textual problems, and the ordinary reader who is mainly concerned with reading the plays as plays, who relies therefore on his edition primarily for discussion of points of meaning or dramatic presentation, but who is prepared every now and again to be interested in a technical problem.' This seems to me an excellent statement of the requirements of this section of a semi-popular edition.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Roberts' Compositors in Titus Andronicus Q2 by Paul L. Cantrell and George Walton Williams</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The problem of distinguishing the work of James Roberts' two compositors, X and Y, in Titus Andronicus Q2 (1600) provides an interesting compositorial analysis. John Russell Brown first revealed the orthographical personalities of these two men and identified their work in two other Roberts' quartos, Hamlet Q2 (1604/5) and The Merchant of Venice (1600). 1 The evidence for the respective stints of the workmen in the two latter plays is quite definite and clear-cut. Titus Andronicus , however, offers a different problem for two main reasons: first, because it is a fairly accurate reprint of a previous edition; second, because the two men did not set their respective shares of copy in well-defined and obvious bibliographical units. The printer's copy for Titus Andronicus Q2 was an exemplar of the first edition printed in 1594 by John Danter. Hamlet Q2 and The Merchant of Venice were set from manuscript. It is ordinarily accepted that the identification of different compositors is more difficult in a reprint than in an original edition set from manuscript. In some cases it may be impossible. The reasons for this are easy to see. Considering the somewhat casual nature of Elizabethan manuscript copy, it is only natural that when a compositor comes to set up this manuscript into type, to some extent he will—almost unwittingly—impose his own personal orthographical and typographical characteristics upon it in his ordering it for the press. From previous studies, it appears that no two compositors are likely to do this in the same way. 2 The transition is a real one, a matter of transferring comparatively unorganized handwritten material into organized material suitable for printing. The case for a reprint is quite different. Here the copy is printed material with an orthographical and structural order which has already been imposed upon it by previous compositors. The normal tendency is for the reprint compositors conveniently to follow the original print in many matters of form, spelling, and typographical detail. In a recent article on compositorial determination, Dr. Alice Walker writes: "Reprints are, of course, a trickier problem than first editions, since we must expect the trail to be confused by the spellings of the print used as copy. Roberts's reprint of Titus Andronicus certainly gives a much distorted picture of the habits of the compositors who set it and suggests that it may be little use to try to arrive at a compositor's normal practice from a reprint." 3 The problem of Titus Q2 is further complicated by the fact that in the reprint X and Y did not combine to set their material in a normal pattern for two-compositor work in which each man serves a different press. In fact, the peculiar feature of Titus is that there should be a second compositor at all. The running-title pattern indicates no such second workman. The book was printed throughout with one skeleton-forme, and so necessarily on one press, with the one set of four running-titles transferred from inner forme to outer forme in orderly succession. The only aberration occurs in sheet K where the recto quarters were exchanged diagonally in the forme as they were shifted from outer I to inner K, and then are maintained in that reversed position into outer K. There is nothing in this minor shift, however, that has anything to do with the question of a second compositor. And this second compositor, Roberts' X, is at work long before K. In Hamlet and The Merchant , each compositor's work-unit was the sheet, with the sole exception of sheet L in Hamlet , where X set two pages, L1 r and L4 v , and Y the remainder, L1 v -L4 r . In Hamlet , X set sheets B-D, F, I, N, and O + A; Y set sheets E, G, H, M, K, and L (with the exception of two pages as noted above 4 ). In The Merchant , Y set sheets A, B, D, F, and H; X set sheets C, E, G, I, and K. Thus in these two plays an equable pattern of composing is observed which is not to be seen in Titus , where Compositor Y seems to have been responsible for the bulk of the reprint, but we find X assisting him at unpredictable intervals and for differing lengths of time. Such irregularity, along with the fact that Titus is a reprint, makes it harder to distinguish the work-pattern of the compositors. Mr. Brown's work on Titus Andronicus naturally stemmed from the data for his successful spelling tests in Hamlet and The Merchant , but many of the significant factors did not apply since Titus was a reprint. Of the twenty-odd paired spellings for X and Y which he found in Hamlet and The Merchant , 5 only nine have any significance for Titus , and these in varying degrees. Those that he did find, however, are meaningful because they definitely identify X and Y as being the same two compositors in Roberts' shop. On the strength of all of the evidence he could garner which separated X and Y in Hamlet and The Merchant , Mr. Brown tentatively assigned 38 of the 79 pages of type (A1 v is blank) in Titus to Y, and 14 pages to X, leaving 27 pages unassigned. His allocation is as follows: Y: A1, 2, 3 v , 4, 4 v , B2 v , 4, C1, 1 v , 2, 3 v , D1, 1 v , 2, 4, E1, 1 v , 2 v , 3 v , 4, F1, 1 v , 2, 3 v , 4, 4 v , G1 v , 2, 4 v , H2, 3, I1, 1 v , 4 v , K1, 1 v , 2, 2 v . X: B1, 1 v , 2, 4 v , C4 v , D2 v , 3, 3 v , E3, 4 v , F3, I2 v , 3, 3 v . It is the purpose of this present paper to indicate the results of another examination of the compositorial problem in Titus , an examination which will amend and augment Mr. Brown's findings and which will allow of a new and more certain allocation of pages. This further examination confirms how many of the characteristics of Hamlet and The Merchant are not applicable to Titus , owing to the retention of many uncharacteristic forms by the two compositors in the reprint. Re-examination also indicates that at least four of the spelling factors which Mr. Brown used for tentative attribution to X and Y in Titus are without supported relevance and must be omitted from the analysis. These are the -ow,-ew/-owe,-ewe distinctions, and the spellings honor , etc./ honour , etc., sweete/sweet, maddam ( e )/madam ( e) , which Mr. Brown notes are "not entirely trustworthy" (p. 34). This leaves him a small core of nine very strong differentiating factors. These invariable factors, which we may designate as Class I of the evidence, are the more significant because their Q2 form in Titus is a change from that in the Q1 copy. These words and the pages on which they occur in Q2 are: Q1 Q2 Q2 Pages (Y-FORMS) their theyr A1, A2, A4(3), A4 v , D1(2), E1(2), E1 v , F1 v (2), F2, F4 v , G1 v (2), I1, I1 v (3), I4 v (3), K1, K1 v (3), K2 v . mooued moued F1 v deare, -er deere, -er A4(2), C1, D2, E2 v , E3 v (2), E4, F1, F1 v , I1 v , K1, K2 v . being beeing D1 v ile Ile I1 choise choyse F3 v noise noyse 6 C4 (X-FORMS) Ile ile D3, E3, E4 v , I3(2), I3 v moude, proue moou'd, prooue B4 v , D2 v perceiue, deceiude perceaue, deceau'd E3, I2 v howres houres C4 v Two facts may be instantly noted from this array: seven of Y's pages and one for X are confirmed by the appearance of two factors, and no pages contain conflicting X and Y evidence. Further, since the Ile/ile distinction is so strong in The Merchant of Venice (printed the same year as Titus ), we may with some confidence admit as oblique but suggestive evidence those instances where Ile is copied from Q1 to Q2 as being Y's normal practice; similarly, the one instance where ile is copied from Q1 to Q2 we may attribute to X. This attribution allows further confirmation of seven pages already allocated to Y, tentatively adds four new pages for him, and adds one new page for X. These are the occurrences of the straight copying: 7 Y: Ile B2 v (2), D1 v , D4, E2 v (2), F1(3), F4 v (3), G3 v , H2 v , I4 v , K1, K1 v . X: ile H4 v . Still no conflicts occur. This fact, along with the fact that seven previously-established pages were confirmed for Y, is almost the sole justification for the admission of such evidence. Proof of this sort is tenuous and inferential at best, for it may very well be that the compositor was faithfully adhering to his printed copy. This faithfulness is a practice which X, unfortunately, appears all too prone to follow. The point is that in analyzing a reprint, inferential evidence of a negative character is sometimes the only evidence available because of the nature of the work. It should only be used, ideally, when at least three of the following four conditions are met: (1) when no conflicts develop; (2) when confirmations for previously-allocated pages are obtained; 8 (3) when the factor is a very strong one, verified by reference to other works set by the same man; (4) when there is an almost invariable positive factor (a definite change of the same word in the copy-spelling) by the other compositor to balance the permissive, negative factor. Of such a nature is X's spelling of deare , and Y's spelling of howrely and here , which will be discussed later. The re-application of a spelling test to the three Roberts' plays also uncovered several pieces of fresh evidence which fell into three general categories: (1) New, differentiating characteristics found in a reappraisal of Hamlet and The Merchant , unnoted by Brown, which also have significance for Titus . (2) Identifying factors, very few in number, which serve to differentiate the two men in Titus , but which do not appear in either Hamlet or The Merchant . (3) Pertinent copy-spellings which are retained from Q1, but which, under the limitations just discussed above, it seems safe to admit as permissive factors of negative evidence. These three categories of fresh evidence we may designate Class II. Obviously, these categories are not of equal weight, and are valuable in a descending scale of importance. The last two are considerably weaker than the first, which, because not invariable, is itself weaker than those invariable factors in Class I with which we began. In the first category of Class II—those factors which are applicable to all three plays—five more determining characteristics for Y were uncovered; none, regrettably, for X. These five are: (1) Y's preference for the ampersand, which he uses about three times as much as X, a practice particularly revealing in The Merchant ; 9 (2) Y's exclusive use of the tilde, usually for justification; 10 (3) his preference for the oo -form in doone, dooing , and in doost ; 11 (4) his occasional spelling of do ; 12 (5) and his spelling of greefe ( -s, -ues ). 13 The following assignments in Titus are predicated on these fresh distinctions: (Y-FORMS) Q1 Q2 Q2 Pages and &amp; 14 B1 v , C3 v , D2, E1 done doone I1 v , K2 doing dooing I1 dost doost C2 v , D3 v , D4, E1 v , F2, G2(2), I4 v doe do F3, I4 v them thē I4 v griefe, etc. greefe, etc. C1(2), E4, I2 In addition to confirming ten Y-pages, this last group of spellings common to all three plays has added eight new pages to Y's span, B1 v , C2 v , C3 v , D3 v , F3, G2, I2, and K2, pages which had not as yet been assigned. In the second category of new evidence, four identifying factors unique to Titus were found, one of which serves to separate X and Y, but the other three to add to our pages for Y. It appears certain that Compositor Y altered the Q1 speech prefix Moore to Aron in Q2 on C2 v , D1, F1, and G1 v . In a typographical change, he altered the alignment of stage directions on E1, where a two-line reverse pyramid is converted to one in which the lines are equally indented, and on C4, G3 v , K1, and K1 v , where paragraphed stage directions are identically altered to this indented form. Sig. K1 v offers a typical example: Q1: Sound Trumpets. Enter Emperour and Empresse with Tribunes and others . Q2: Sound Trumpets. Enter Emperour and Empresse with Tribunes and others . It is also fairly certain, as Brown assumed, that Compositor Y changed the Q1 spelling of this to thys on C1 v (2), C2(2), C3 v , F4(2), and I1 v . In addition, pages for both X and Y may be allocated by their differing spelling, both in the text and in the speech prefixes, of the name of Saturninus' brother, as indicated by the following divergences from the copy: Q1 Q2 Q2 Pages Y: Bascianus Bassianus 15 B2 v (2), C1, D1, D1 v X: Bassianus Bascianus A3, B4 v , D4 v (6) All of these four practices (for they can hardly be called characteristics on the basis of one play) have the virtue of confirming an array of Y-pages already allocated to him on other evidence. The three new pages which are added for him—C2, C4, and F4—have no X evidence in them. Conversely, of the three pages attributed to X on the basis of his spelling of Bascianus , one of them, B4 v , is now confirmed, and two new ones—A3 and D4 v —are added, with no conflict with any Y evidence. In fact, the more evidence that accumulates, the more meaningful the lack of any Y characteristics becomes for any given page. The last category of new evidence in Class II, three examples of negative copying, may be cited with less certainty. The stipulations that must be observed before this sort of evidence can be admitted have already been set out above. The spellings are: 16 Q1 Q2 Q2 Pages Y: here here A4 v (5), B1 v , D1 v , D2(3), E1, E3 v , F1 v (2), F2, F3 v (2), G1 v (2), G1(2), G2(2), G4 v (3), H1 v (3), H2, K1. howrely howrely G2 v X: deare(-er, -ly) deare(-er, -ly) 17 B4, F2 v , F3, H4. Compositor Y's copying of here in Q2 as it is found in Q1 is a case in point for permissive evidence. It is again inferential, but the attribution is formulated on sound support. Compositor X is almost invariably a heere- speller; only twice (once for obvious justification) does he use the simpler spelling in The Merchant (G2,K1), and at no time in Hamlet . Y uses the short form nine times in The Merchant (A2 v , D2(2), H1(2), H2(2), H2 v , H3 v ), and twice in Hamlet (M1 v (2)). Of the 31 times this short spelling is used in Titus , on no occasion does a conflict develop with X evidence. 18 One copy-spelling of deare conflicts with Y's spelling of do on F3 (see below). Finally, in Class III, there are two other rather general typographical practices which seem indicative of differing treatment by the two men, not always distinctive, but more correlative than not. Each practice involves a choice on the part of the compositors: the first is the placement of one sort of stage direction; the second is the spelling of the speech prefixes in the transfer from the original to the reprint. In the matter of certain stage directions, the point of difference is their comparative centering in the line, whether it is precise or only approximate. Excluded from consideration are those stage directions which are not amenable to centering (or which appeared so to X and Y)—those either obviously flush right or nearly right in Q1 (such as Exit, Exeunt , etc.), or those (like the indented forms already noted as set by Y) which, whatever their indentation or paragraphing, continue to the right margin, or nearly so, and take up the bulk of the line. Within a tolerance of two millimeters, Compositor X as a general proposition made sure that his medial stage directions were precisely centered in the line, or to put it another way, were centered in his long stick. This involved setting the stage direction first, then placing quads or blank spaces equally on either side of the setting until the line was of the proper length. Compositor Y, however, while he obviously intended these stage directions to be approximately in the middle of the line, made no such precise effort to center them, and apparently guessed at the spacing on either side; hence, his medial stage directions usually deviate from the midpoint of the line in varying degrees. Into his stick, which was the same length as X's, Y would evidently put first the amount of quads or spaces which he felt would place the stage direction in the approximate center of the line, set the stage direction, then fill the line out with the number of spaces required for justification. This procedure most often yielded an off-center setting, but, depending on the accuracy of the guess, sometimes accidentally resulted in a centered setting. The 22 pages in which these precisely-centered stage directions occur may be divided as follows: (1) nine pages where X's presence is confirmed: A3, B4 v , C4 v , D4 v , E3, E4 v , H1, H4, and I2 v ; (2) six hitherto neutral pages on which no prior evidence has been established either way: A3 v , B3, B3 v , E2, H3 v , and I4; (3) seven pages attributed to Y with which this evidence conflicts: A2 v , D3 v , D4, F1 v , F3, G4 v , and H1 v . Non-centered stage directions which we have postulated as the result of Y's practice occur on no X-pages, a fact certainly meaningful, and thus serve to confirm the following 13 pages already suggested for Y: A4, A4 v , C2, C4, D1, D2, E1 v , E2 v , F1, H2, H2 v , I2, and K2. While not always decisive, the above evidence does show a high degree of correlation with what has already been established with antecedent material. 19 In the matter of speech prefixes, from what is observable in the pages already assigned to the two men it would appear that X's general tendency is to copy the speech prefix exactly as it stands in Q1; on the other hand, it seems to have been Y's general tendency to alter the original settings several times on a page, more often by contraction than by expansion. Such a broad division tends to support many pages previously allocated. This general correlation can be seen by examining what happened to the speech prefixes on the pages which, either on strong evidence or weak, have been already allocated in this study. In the following table, the numerator of the fraction represents the number of changes made in the speech prefixes, the denominator the number of speech prefixes on the page, and therefore the number of opportunities for change of copy. 20 (X-PAGES) 21 B4 0/13; B4 v 0/8, C4 v 0/9; D2 v 2/12; D3 0/10; D4 v 0/9; E3 0/8; E4 v 0/7; F2 v 0/1; H1 0/12; H4 0/3; H4 v 2/9; I2 v 0/6; I3 1/7; I3 v 2/7; K3 v 0/4; K4 0/5. (Y-PAGES) A4 2/7; A4 v 0/3; B1 v 3/11; B2 v 4/18; C1 1/4; C1 v 3/7; C2 1/3; C2 v 5/9; C3 v 3/9; C4 0/4; D1 1/2; D1 v 1/7; D2 3/7; D3 v 2/10; D4 3/8; E1 5/13; E1 v 3/3; E2 v 0/4; E3 v 0/5; E4 2/7; F1 1/10; F1 v 1/6; F2 2/8; F3 3/7; F3 v 4/11; F4 2/4; F4 v 0/7; G1 3/8; G1 v 7/14; G2 6/20; G2 v 2/8; G3 v 2/4; G4 v 0/6; H1 v 1/7; H2 0/2; H2 v 2/9; I1 2/8; I2 2/9; I4 v 2/15; K1 0/1; K1 v 2/6; K2 2/13; K2 v 2/11. Analysis of this array is tabulated as follows: Compositor no. of pages no. of pages on which changes occur no. of pages on which no changes occur total no. of prefix changes total no. of prefixes % of change X 17 4 13 7 130 5.3 Y 43 35 8 90 335 26.8 There is no doubt that the difference in the percentage of change is statistically valid. Lack of speech-prefix change is the only evidence appearing on six pages, B1, C3 22 , G3, G4, H3, and K3, where 4, 7, 9, 5, 6, and 1 speech prefixes, respectively, are unchanged; but since the practice is not invariable, any attribution to X must still be indecisive. On the other hand, four pages contain only speech-prefix evidence combined with comparative-centering evidence: A3 v , B3 v , E3, and H3 v , where both practices combine to suggest X. 23 Two pages contain no other evidence except that of speech-prefix changes: B2 3/5; and K4 v 1/2. The final allocation of pages in Titus is therefore predicated on material of various degrees of assurance. In Class I are placed those pages for which there is strong evidence: 24 Y: A1, A2, A4, A4 v , C1, C4, D1, D1 v , D2, E1, E1 v , E2 v , E3 v , E4, F1, F1 v , F2, F3 v , F4 v , G1 v , I1, I1 v , I4 v , K1, K1 v , K2 v . X: B4 v , C4 v , D2 v , D3, E3, E4 v , I2 v , I3, I3 v . In Class II are those assignments for which there is fresh evidence based on similar occurrences in Hamlet and The Merchant : Y: B1 v , C2 v , C3 v , D3 v , D4, F3, G2, I2, K2; for which there is fresh evidence unique for Titus : Y: B2 v , C1 v , C2, F4, G3 v X: A3, D4 v ; and for which there is only negative permissive evidence: Y: A2 v , G1, G2 v , G4 v , H1 v , H2, H2 v X: B4, F2 v , H1, H4, H4 v , K3 v , K4. In Class III are those assignments for which the evidence is purely tentative, based on a correlation of speech-prefix and comparative-centering evidence only: X: A3 v , B3 v , E2, H3 v . If we may bring together all ranges of evidence, the pattern of assignment is: There remains only briefly to consider why Titus was composed in such an irregular pattern, or why Compositor X came to assist on the book at all. One hypothesis, consonant with what we know went on in Elizabethan printing shops, would in general explain X's irregular share of the work and also account for the fact that most of the X-pages occur late in the sheet. This hypothesis, based on the assumption that Titus was composed in continuous but not simultaneous setting by the two men, is simply that X was called in to help while Y was distributing the type from a forme that already had been printed. We know that distribution was a necessary and regular operation throughout the printing of a book. If, at the times Y was distributing, X were available, or could easily be made available, this postulation could be feasible. Since, theoretically, Y would be ready for distribution at about the same time in relation to the composing schedule of each sheet—distribution which would not of course take exactly the same amount of time for each forme—Compositor X could then be called in approximately at the same time in the schedule for each sheet. While Y was distributing, it is reasonable to suppose that X continued with the setting of new pages. If X was not in precise control of the exact moment when he could become available, this delay would account for his irregular entrances into the sheets, perhaps in the middle or lower part of a page, since, presumably, Y would leave off composing only when X appeared. This could easily have happened when, in a stint of two or three consecutive X-pages, an X-factor occurs only in the lower section of the first page of the stint. Similarly, on the conclusion of his distribution, Y would not always return to relieve X at the precise moment of a bibliographical break within the forme, and could take over at some place within a page which X had begun. Since, as has been estimated, distribution time is about one-third of composing time, this division of the work would explain the shorter share of X, which on the basis of the allocations posited in this study is about one-third that of Y's. In conclusion, any complete division of Titus Andronicus by compositors is at this moment impracticable. The larger picture is reasonably clear, but beyond the allocation of those pages established in this study, it is now difficult to proceed without an undue amount of conjecture. Further progress must await two desiderata , the accumulation of additional knowledge of the compositorial habits of X and Y by examination of other works, preferably plays, set by these two men, either together or singly; and subsequent research from Titus itself, or Hamlet , or The Merchant of Venice , which will reveal significant materials unnoticed so far. The present results are not completely inutile: enough definite pages have been noted for the two men to be of use in analyzing what they did to printed copy, information which has its use elsewhere.</field>

Hook, "The Two Compositors in the First Quarto of Peele's Edward I," Studies in Bibliography , VII (1955), 170-177; and Harry R. Hoppe, The Bad Quarto of Romeo and Juliet (1948), pp. 46-56. 3 "Compositorial Determination and other Problems in Shakespearian Texts," Studies in Bibliography , VII (1955), 7. 4 Further evidence may definitely confirm that Compositor X set L1 r and L4 v in Hamlet . Throughout this book the two compositors differ in their treatment of the spacing between the speech prefix and the first word of the line of text which follows. Compositor Y generally placed exactly the same amount of space—approximately two millimeters—after the speech prefix before setting the first word of the speech. Compositor X generally varied the amount of spacing after the speech prefixes in order to align the first letters of the speeches vertically, regardless of the length of the speech prefix. A ruler placed along the initial letter of the first word in each speech will indicate the uniform indentation of X's settings. This practice is most easily observable on pages where a great many short speeches occur in succession, but its value as bibliographical evidence is naturally obviated to a large extent when the speech prefixes are of the same length. Sig. F1 r is an ideal example of X's practice; E4 v , en face , is illustrative of Y's. This evidence, along with the spelling differences remarked by Mr. Brown, set L1 r and L4 v apart from the remainder of the sheet. Unfortunately, this practice of X's does not appear in either Titus or The Merchant of Venice . 5 It is admittedly possible that what are considered characteristic spellings for one of the compositors may not be personal preferences, but may reflect the scribal copy-spellings of the manuscript underneath. This could be so if all of the copy for Hamlet and The Merchant , for instance, was in the hand of the same scribe, and if one of the compositors was a faithful follower of copy. The other workman, then, altered according to his personal bent. Two different spellings of the same word therefore result, one of them a retained scribal spelling, the other a compositorial variant. For that matter, as far as we know now, this possible unequal influence of copy-spellings on the two men may very well have been one of the reasons why so many of the apparent characteristics for X and Y fade out and are invalid in other (mostly prose) books which Mr. Brown examined (pp. 34-37), particularly since the copy for these other books must have been of varied nature. Without further evidence, however, this is undemonstrable. Reprint work, of course, offers more substantial evidence since the original edition serves as a control. 6 A Y-spelling which Brown found of value in Hamlet , but did not apply to Titus . 7 In two instances, once on F4 v and once on K1, Compositor Y added an apostrophe, changing the spelling from Ile to I'le . 8 As will be seen later, all 11 pages on which Ile is copied from Q1 are confirmed by other evidence for Y. 9 In The Merchant , Y uses the ampersand 10 times to only three times for X; in Hamlet , Y uses it 29 times; X, 12 times. 10 The tilde is used three times in Hamlet (G4, K2 v , L2 v ) and twice in The Merchant (B1 v , H1); all are on Y-pages. 11 Compositor Y sets dooing three times in The Merchant (B3, F3, F4 v ), twice in Hamlet (G4, L4); he sets doone seven times in Hamlet (G4, H1 v , H2 v , K1 v (2), M4(2)); Compositor X does not use either of these spellings. Y sets doost 12 times: 10 times in Hamlet (G3, G4 v , H3, K2, M2 v , M3(2), M3 v , M4 v , M2), and twice in The Merchant (D3, H3); X sets it only twice in Hamlet (F1 v , N2) and three times in The Merchant (C2 v , E1, G2 v ). 12 Both X and Y are normally doe -spellers; however, X uses the do -form only once, in Hamlet on C1 v , whereas Y uses the shorter form 10 times in Hamlet , on G3, G3 v , H1, H2, H2 v , H4(4), K2 v , and five times in The Merchant , on A2, A4 v (2), D1 v , and F4 v . 13 Compositor Y uses the ee -form of greefe , etc. four times in Hamlet (E3 v , G3 v , G4, H2), in addition to using the ie -spelling; X, on the other hand, always uses the ie -spelling. 14 Ampersands are also copied by Y from Q1 on B1 v , C4, and H2, all pages in need of support. The spelling dooings is also copied on A4, a strong Y-page. 15 The copy-spelling of Bassianus is retained, characteristically, by Y fourteen times (A2(3), A2 v , B1 v , B2 v , C1 v , D1, D1 v (2), D4(2), I1(2)), and it is evident that he preferred that spelling. Sig. A2 v is the only page attributed to Y on the sole basis of this copy-spelling; it contains no other evidence. Bascianus is retained by X six times, on B4 v (4), C4 v , and D3. Y retains this spelling four times, on C3 v , C4, D1, and D1 v . It is also retained on C3 (see footnote 22). 16 In addition, the retained copy-spelling of hither appears also to be somewhat significant for X, although there is no support for it in the other two plays. It occurs on E4 v , H1, H2 v (2), H4, K3 v and K4, of which only H2 v (with a retained Ile ) conflicts. On the other hand, the change of hither to hether on D1 v , D2, F1, I4 v , and K2 v , seems to be a definite factor for Y, at least in this play (see Brown, p. 38). 17 Two copy-spellings of the word Deare are duplicated from Q1 by Y on E3 v where both uses are involved in a pun on deer/dear. 18 The spelling Here's (here is), normally a Y-form, occurs on sig.H4, but this example has not been listed with the other instances of this spelling as it appears to have a peculiar history. A probable conjecture is that the compositor set Her's , faithfully following the Q1 error, then, realizing the line was somewhat garbled, added the single e to correct the sense, careless of his customary spelling. If this conjecture is true, this example obviously can not be used as evidence for either compositor. 19 No stage directions of this category appear on 36 pages. The evidence on B4, F4, G1, G1 v , and K1 v is mixed. Each of these pages contain more than one stage direction, some centered, some not. 20 Excluded from consideration are those speech prefixes which are centered in the page above the characters' speeches on A2, A2 v , A3, and I1 v , an aberrant practice duplicated from Q1. This type of speech prefix would not normally be abbreviated. 21 Excluded from the count on H1 and K4 are speech prefixes which evidently were editorially changed for the reprint. 22 Except for two retained spellings of Bascianus , an X characteristic which is inconclusive. 23 The two practices are contradictory on B3 and I4. 24 To avoid duplication, each page is listed only in the class in which it initially appears.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">The Textual Relation of Q2 to Q1 Hamlet (I) by Fredson Bowers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I With the publication in 1934 of J. Dover Wilson's detailed monograph on Hamlet , 1 the general textual problem appeared to be solved in all important matters, and a scholar could well have believed that no new information was likely to be recovered which could basically affect editorial procedure. It was soon generally accepted, following Wilson, that the Folio manuscript was a copy of a copy of the manuscript which stood directly behind the Second Quarto, and that this earliest manuscript was Shakespeare's own autograph 'foul papers.' Though seriously corrupted from time to time by an inexperienced and blundering compositor, Q2 was therefore elevated as the primary substantive text, and the Folio print lowered in esteem as an actor-sophisticated and unreliable witness at two removes. Some 'bibliographical links' between the bad Q1 and the good Q2 were identified in the first act, but the number of these was minimized. Professor Wilson gave it as his impression that the relation was one only of occasional consultation when the Q2 compositor was puzzled by Shakespeare's handwriting; that "it would be going much too far to suppose that act I of Q2 was printed from a corrected copy of Q1"; and that the compositor, "knowing, as he probably did, a good deal about its origin," would no doubt have consulted Q1 cautiously. 2 Professor Wilson's plausible arguments for the generally supreme authority of Q2 had a heady effect on editors, as may be seen in the Craig and Parrott edition of 1938 which attempted the first scientific old-spelling text of Hamlet according to Wilson's principles. Since the Folio was taken to be an independent authority, concurrence of F and of Q2 was almost automatic proof of the authenticity of the reading; otherwise, such agreement in a wrong reading could be explained only with difficulty either as fortuitous or else as a common error in reading the original by the Q2 compositor and Wilson's Scribe P, the copyist of the promptbook. Agreements between Q1 and F against Q2 when they did not suit editorial taste could usually be brushed off as reflecting actors' changes introduced into the promptbook. On the other hand, agreement between Q1 and Q2 was the double-eagle guarantee of authenticity in all cases where contamination was not suspected, for here, it was assumed, one had the acting version supporting the foul papers at an earlier stage than the special manuscript made by Scribe C to serve as printer's copy for F. In this reconstructed textual history the problem of corruption in Q2 deriving from Q1 ought to have been highlighted as of singular importance, since agreement between the two quartos as against the Folio was ordinarily taken as the strongest demonstration of Folio sophistication; and hence it is rather odd that in the succeeding years no further enquiry was made into the exact physical relation of the quartos. That editors seemed content to approve of the Wilson 'impression' is evident and may in part be explained, perhaps, by the new optimism induced by Wilson's rehabilitation of the Second Quarto, combined with the theory that the Folio was an independent witness which could be counted on to vary and to produce the right reading in those few and surely obvious cases when the Q2 compositor had consulted Q1. Editors, indeed, found great comfort in the Q1 contamination theory. It neatly explained without recourse to the always troublesome common-error hypothesis such a manifest double mistake as cost for cast in I.i.73 of Q1 and Q2, for example; and for those unwilling to believe with Wilson that sallied flesh in Q1 and Q2 was merely a misprint for correct sullied , fortification was given for preferring the traditional F solid . Wilson's hypothesis that the consultation of Q1 by the Q2 compositor was cautious and occasional was buttressed by his listing (I, 159) of only twenty-five readings in which Q2 had felt Q1's influence and from these his segregation of only five in which he felt that Q2 had departed from its manuscript to follow Q1 in error. I.i.44 horrowes (Q1 horrors) I.i.73 cost I.ii.129 sallied ( for sullied) I.iii.74 of a most select ( ditto F1) I.iv.49 interr'd Such a list could not give rise to serious doubts about substantive error, for, of the five, three were really only spelling errors. This list of five is not, however, very accurate, for the evidence either of MSH , I, 161, or of the New Cambridge text shows that Wilson also preferred the Folio reading in the following cases when F diverged from Q1-2 agreement: I.ii.40 or 42 [ no exit ] I.ii.205 gelly, with . . . feare ^ I.iv.71 bettles (Q1 beckles) I.v.33 rootes I.v.64 leaprous I.v.113 Heauens I.v.132 I will goe pray (F Looke you, . . .) In each reading the Q2 'error' ought reasonably to have arisen from Q1 contamination. It is interesting to observe that this list, conservative for its number of five (really twelve) assumed errors, did not meet with universal approval by subsequent editors. More disagreement might, of course, have been expected from the Old Cambridge editors. However, of Wilson's assigned five errors they had anticipated him in four and differed only about I.ii.129 sallied . This general concord contrasts strongly with the opinions of six post-Wilson editors (Kittredge, Craig-Parrott, Harrison, Campbell, Alexander, and Sisson 3 ) who as a group concur that Q2 has indubitably been contaminated by Q1 in only two readings of the five. And since these two readings are horrowes and cost , we do not have much of a bag. Moreover, of the seven additional contaminations in which Wilson believed, as shown by his text, the Old Cambridge editors had anticipated him in all but one (I.v.33 rootes ); on the other hand, the six later editors agree as a unit with Wilson in only two trifling readings ( bettles as a misprint for beetles , and the supplying of an exit at I.ii.40 or 42). The textual situation in the view of recent editors may be summarized thus. Of the 70 significant variations of F from Q1-2 agreement in sheets B-D (for the list, see the Appendix A), Wilson and all the listed editors after him concur that the Folio is in error and that there has been no contamination in Q2 from Q1 in respect to these readings in 48 cases. If, thereupon, we deduct from the remaining 22 readings the 4 cases in which all editors agree that Q1-Q2 are in error, we are left with 18 disputed readings in which some one of seven recent editors of Shakespeare feels (as shown tacitly by his preference for F over Q1-2) that Q1 has contaminated Q2. (It is interesting to see that of these disputed 18 the Old Cambridge edition preferred F in 17 and in no case is unique. The New Cambridge, on the other hand, prefers F in only six of the disputes.) If we allow these editors either a moment of extraordinary insight, or else one of temporary aberration, and deduct the four cases in which only one prefers F and thereby disagrees with the others, who go along with Q1-2 (Campbell at I.i.17 and I.v.91; Kittredge at I.i.34; Craig-Parrott at I.iv.9), and the two times one editor holds out for Q1-2 as against the preference of the six others for F (Craig-Parrott at I.ii.205 and I.v.64), we find reasonably serious disagreement in 13 readings. Of these there is substantial agreement at I.iii.74 (except for Wilson) that something is wrong with Q2, but three editors are content to repeat the Folio while the other three make different attempts to emend (Kittredge, Alexander, Sisson), of which Kittredge's may be the most successful perhaps. From the remaining dozen disputed readings, therefore, we have 5 in which two editors, or a minority, think Q1-2 corrupt and choose F: Q2 I.ii.177 prethee ( i.e. prithee) Harrison, Campbell I.ii.185 Where Kittredge, Harrison I.v.33 rootes Wilson, Kittredge I.v.62 Hebona Harrison, Campbell I.v.126 in the [right] Harrison, Campbell Of these, Q1-2 roots versus F rots is perhaps the most important, followed by Q1-2 Where versus F Oh where . The others represent forms of words or, in one case, a presumed metrical consideration. Of the remaining 7 readings only a bare majority of four editors retain faith in Q1-2, whereas three indicate their belief in corruption by choosing F: Q2 I.i.164 that time Kittredge, Harrison, Campbell I.iii.65 new hatcht vnfledg'd courage Kittredge, Harrison, Campbell (who emend both Q and F) I.v.150 Ha, ha Kittredge, Harrison, Campbell In these three readings, of which only Q1-2 courage versus F comrade is of especial importance, it is interesting to see that the three dissenting editors follow the Old Cambridge text. We begin to arrive at more general agreement about Q1-2 corruption in 3 readings in which four editors, or a majority, take the F variant: Q2 I.ii.226,227,228 All . Kittredge, Harrison, Campbell, Sisson I.iv.49 interr'd Wilson, Kittredge, Harrison, Alexander I.v.113 Heauens Wilson, Kittredge, Harrison, Campbell Of these interr'd versus F enurn'd is the most interesting. In the remaining two readings there is a preponderance of opinion, five to two, in favor of F: Q2 I.ii.129 sallied ( i.e. sullied) all but Wilson and Craig-Parrott I.v.132 omits Looke you, all but Craig-Parrott and Sisson, though Wilson and Alexander choose Q1-2 I will instead of F Ile As given the acid test of editorial treatment, therefore, in the twenty years after Wilson's monograph, which publicized the 'bibliographical links' between Q1 and Q2, only some one of seven important editors has considered that in the first act there were as many as 22 possibilities for corrupt readings in Q2 derived from Q1, although the most any individual editor has been willing to assign as corrupt and to reject is Harrison's and Campbell's 20. Only two editors of the seven have agreed there were as many as 19 corruptions, and three that there were as many as 14. When we finally come to a majority opinion, 11 errors are assigned (as against the 11 or 12 in which Wilson seems actually to have believed: he is, of course, one of this majority). Five editors (a stronger majority since Wilson does not now tip the scales) can agree on only 8 contaminated readings; six editors on 6 such readings; and all seven on only 4. These figures very likely indicate the opinion of the editors concerned about the general accuracy of the 'foul-papers' Q2 text and cannot be taken to result from any searching individual enquiries into the Q1 contamination problem. 4 Given the new view of the authoritative origin of the Q2 text which Wilson so largely introduced, the acceptance of his impression that the consultation of Q1 was cautious and occasional, and then of his belief that F provided an independent witness, it follows that the editorial treatment of the more 'scientific' of the editors is about what might have been expected. Certainly there is no indication of any fear that contamination from Q1 offered a serious problem. And in this connection it is interesting to observe that the only reading of any importance in which all three early texts agree and yet which editors have viewed with some suspicion is of the most select ; but even this is not a clearcut case. No stronger evidence could obtain for the belief in F as an independent witness. Recently, Dr. Alice Walker has attacked two of the three components of the Wilson hypothesis upon which this particular editorial reconstruction rests. 5 Her main thesis is that F is not an independent witness but instead that the printer's copy was an example of Q2 annotated by reference to the playhouse manuscript. Although the precise details of her reconstruction have not gone unchallenged and the question has been raised either of an intermediate manuscript copying an annotated-quarto promptbook or else of some slightly indeterminate use of Q2 short of annotation, 6 that Q2 was in some manner and to some degree an ancestor of the mixed F text seems demonstrated. If this is so, not only is the total textual picture changed but there are important applications to the specific problem of the Q1-Q2 relationship: given an inadvertent failure in F to select the manuscript rather than the Q2 reading in cases when the Q2 reading has been contaminated, it is quite possible for all three texts to agree in a reading which is non-Shakespearian. 7 Operating under the Wilson hypothesis, editors could reasonably believe that, with luck, in all cases of Q1-Q2 contamination the Folio would vary and would normally provide the correct reading. The only problem, therefore, was to assess F's variants from Q1-Q2 agreement either as typical F corruptions and sophistications where Q2 was correct, or else as true readings in contrast to Q2 errors. Strongly armed with a high respect for Q2 as set directly from Shakespeare's autograph papers, the more textually 'scientific' the editor the more he favored Q2 and depreciated the F variants as unauthoritative. 8 The statistics presented above tell the story. And they would presumably justify the position taken by such a middle-ground editor as Alexander, say, if the corruption in Q2 from Q1 were no more serious than was exposed by F variation, even accepting the new status of F according to Walker (which none of the four editors had the opportunity to consider). The argument would be appealing that if no more corruption than was suspected could be found by F variation, it was unlikely that much if any by bad fortune would have escaped the annotator or comparer of the F printer's copy, since as a general rule it would seem that he had introduced more annotations than he had failed to make. Thus the soundness of the Q2 text would be reaffirmed. However, the second pillar attacked by Walker was the hypothesis for only occasional consultation of Q1 by the Q2 compositor. In her view the evidence is convincing that Act I of Q2 Hamlet had in turn been set from an annotated copy of Q1. If this is so, the textual picture changes radically again. Under the former view, except for between 5 and 22 readings taken over from Q1 in error from a total of 25 (or up to about 40) specific consultations, Q2 was an independent witness set from manuscript. Under Dr. Walker's theory, if Q2 were set from a copy of Q1 annotated in the printing house by reference to the manuscript to serve as easier printer's copy, the incidence of error would be markedly higher. Thus even with the new theory about the formation of F's printer's copy, instead of a comparatively narrow base for Q2 corruption from Q1 to be passed on to F, there would instead be a comparatively wide base. Moreover, since neither of the two editions which had some transcriptional link with authority could in the area of Act I be counted on to have a full and uninterrupted link (for neither had been set directly from a manuscript), the number of Q1 'bad' readings which could be transmitted directly to F through Q2 must pyramid sharply, and this increase in possible corruption would be accompanied proportionally by a decrease in the evidence of textual variation as a means for detecting it. Each part of Dr. Walker's hypothesis, therefore, has its own importance. If only one of the two texts had as a basic ancestor an earlier print, the textual case for Act I is not so serious; but if in this same area both Q2 and F cannot be called substantially independent witnesses, then the editorial problem is extremely serious and the amount of corruption in the early part of the Hamlet text might be really considerable. It is of importance, therefore, to test her hypotheses with some scrupulousness in order that we may know where we stand. In this connection I must point out that any estimate about the nature of the corruption, as well as the amount to be anticipated by an editor, is dependent on more than the simple establishment of some immediate dependence of one printed text on another, either of F on Q2, or of Q2 on Q1. That Q2 in some manner used Q1 is self-evident; and I am willing to accept Dr. Walker's basic arguments and to believe at least that in some manner Q2 is an ancestor of F, even though I am inclined to query whether an annotated copy of Q2 served directly as printer's copy. My concern here is not with the Q2-F relationship, however, but with that between Q2 and Q1. And in this matter (as with Q2-F) we cannot estimate either the kind of contamination, or the amount of it, until we can establish a working hypothesis based on the best evidence that can be secured as to whether Act I of Q2 was set from an annotated copy of Q1, or whether it was set instead from manuscript with consultation of Q1; and if this latter is the case, whether the consultation was only occasional as has been traditionally accepted or whether it was more extensive and peculiar. In such an investigation, the basis must be bibliographical in so far as such techniques can properly be employed. We must recognize, however, that as bibliographical investigation turns from the analytical to the textual the evidence on which it operates becomes less certain and therefore the results grow more speculative and tend more to argue for probability than to offer practical demonstration. This is especially true when we come to study compositorial characteristics, an extremely variable matter from which evidence can be adduced only with caution. What we may determine about the relation of Q2 to Q1 starts with what is known about the printing of Q2. This subject has recently been investigated both in relation to the presswork and to the composition, with mutually supporting results. The analysis of the running-titles reveals that two presses printed Q2, as follows: Press I machined sheets B, C, D, F, I, N and O+A (in that order); Press II machined sheets E, G, H, K, L, M. 9 An analysis of the variant spellings of certain significant words indicates that two compositors, whom we may call X and Y, typeset the quarto according to the sheets assigned to the two presses, except that compositor X assisted his fellow by setting sig. L4 verso, and sig. L1 recto, in sheet L. Thus to compositor X we may assign sheets B, C, D, F, I, N, O+A, and sigs. L1,4 v . To compositor Y go sheets E, G, H, K, M, and sigs. L1 v -4 of sheet L. Moreover, these two workmen can be identified by their spelling habits as the compositors who set The Merchant of Venice Q1 (1600) and Titus Andronicus Q2 (1600), as well as various other books which came from James Roberts' shop. 10 If compositor X had begun to set this book and was subsequently assisted by compositor Y and Press II after he had set three sheets B, C, and D, the above facts would not have a great deal to do with the problem of the relations between the quartos. But, on the contrary, compositor X (who may well have been a somewhat faster workman) was very likely still engaged on sheet B or at the most had no more than started sheet C when his fellow Y joined him on the book. The running-title and spelling evidence indicate something like the following schedule for the typesetting and printing. 11 When this schedule is surveyed, it may be seen that the irregularity of assignment of sheets in the quarto to the two compositors had no physical reason for its existence in the time relationship, and that there was no reason why Q2 Hamlet could not have been printed as was The Merchant of Venice in regularly alternating sheets: Here, it seems clear, X started The Merchant at a point very close in time to that at which Y was to start Q2 Hamlet . But in Hamlet copy was cast off as far ahead as sig. E1 for compositor Y's beginning, although at the very least sig. C1 would have served in case X had already commenced on sheet B, or sig. D1 if X had started sheet C. A comparison of the printing of these two quartos re-inforces normal bibliographical interpretation of the evidence from Hamlet that some special reason must have existed for starting compositor Y so deep in the book as sheet E, although he was beginning his work no later than the time that compositor X was starting sheet C. Since this reason does not inhere to any part of the normal mechanical process, we may raise the question of the printer's copy. Apparently the circumstances of printing Q2 are not unrelated to the fact that Act I, in which the major if not entire share of influence from Q1 can be detected, is contained exclusively in sheets B, C, and D, except for the last seven lines which run-over on sig. E1. And it is seemingly not fortuitous that this area of influence coincides with the bibliographical oddity that compositor X set these three sheets in sequence, though by normal printing practice compositor Y should have set one of the sheets. It is reasonable to conjecture, therefore, that the use of Q1—evidence for which can be detected in each of the three sheets—must have dictated the abnormal sequestration of these sheets for X to work on. And if this is so, it follows that there was some physical circumstance in the use of Q1 which made it impossible for both compositors simultaneously to typeset those Q2 sheets in which Q1 was being employed. This circumstance must have been either (1) the fact that, as Dr. Walker believes, Q1 had been annotated to serve as printer's copy for Act I (sheets B-D); or (2) Q1 was not annotated but was being closely consulted by the typesetter. If (2) is to have any credibility, we must suppose (a) only one copy was available, 12 and (b) the consultation was not occasional, as has been supposed, but instead so constant, or general, as to prevent two workmen from using the single copy at the same time. Finally, if we are to believe in this modified consultation theory, we must conjecture that the usefulness of Q1 had been determined and the method by which it would be employed had been worked out before compositor Y came on the job and was forced to cast off copy to begin his stint so late as sheet E. The bibliographical evidence for an unusual division of the compositorial responsibility joins with the textual evidence, therefore, to suggest that Q1 was utilized in a rather important manner in the typesetting of sheets B-D of Q2 and that this fact must serve as the basis for any hypothesis about the method of its employment. If this is so, the compositor could not merely have consulted it with caution on the 25 occasions posited by Dover Wilson but must instead have utilized it almost continually. The inadequacies of the occasional-consultation theory have already been pointed out on the evidence of the text itself by Dr. Walker. 13 I am in full agreement with her that the evidence of the outsetting of the Q2 speech-prefixes at the start of the first scene (of which more later) combines with the four curious similar spellings she remarks in scenes iv and v to force us to discard the consultation theory in the form in which it has previously been presented. The question, then, enforces itself: was an example of Q1 annotated in the printing house to provide the copy for Q2 sheets B-D, as Dr. Walker argues, or was Q1 employed in some other manner but one that prevented two compositors from making simultaneous use of what must have been only a single example. As remarked above, this question is more than an academic one, and on it hinges extremely important estimates as to the nature and extent of Q1's corrupting influence. Critics have been content with the solution that Q1 was 'occasionally consulted'. The implications of this conclusion are disquieting. We cannot suppose that Q1 was only consulted when the texts make identical errors or introduce the same anomalous spellings. There must have been many other occasions when the Q2 compositor, baffled by his manuscript, found a plausible solution in Q1, which he accepted; and we accept it, similarly, because it makes sense and because we find it in Q2. But we have no means of determining how often, or when, the Q2 compositor turned to Q1 for a solution of his difficulties. Consequently, even if Q1 was only occasionally consulted, since we know neither how often nor when, all readings of Q2 which agree with those of Q1 incur suspicion, and there is no certainty that a reading common to Q1 and Q2 has independent authorities behind it. Hence, to suppose Q1 was occasionally consulted and to suspect contamination of Q2 only where readings common to Q1 and Q2 are either plainly wrong, or look as if they might be, is fallacious and no warrant for reliance on Q2 elsewhere as an independent witness. The editorial position is no easier for this uncertainty. It is merely hazier. If an editor can work on the assumption that the one text was printed from a corrected copy of the other, he does at least know that readings common to the two texts may have only a single authority behind them and can feel reasonably confident that variants in the later text (unless manifestly printer's errors) were deliberately introduced. If all he knows is that an earlier edition was at hand and was occasionally consulted, he does not know where he stands and the authority of the later edition is no greater in the one case than in the other. 14 If some more definite conclusion concerning the typographical relationship of Q1 to Q2 could be arrived at, the editorial problem would be clarified and simplified. 15 In her investigation of Hamlet , Dr. Walker's main purpose was to deal with the Q2-Folio relationship, and hence she did not offer in support of her hypothesis for an annotated Q1 the same detailed evidence as was attached to her Q2-F argument. Her brief statement is in two parts. (1) On sig. B1 of Q1, as first noticed by Greg, 16 the compositor set his speech-prefixes sans indentation and full out to the left margin of his text. On sig. B1 v , for whatever reason, he reverted to the conventional indentation of his prefixes. Correspondingly, on sig. B1 of Q2 the speech-prefixes are unconventionally treated, being outset beyond the text left margin. The text is expanded from that of Q1 so that when Q2 turns the page to sig. B1 v the material is still that on B1 r of Q1; and on Q2 B1 v the prefixes are set flush to the left margin (as in Q1) precisely to that point where Q1 passed over to normal usage after turning the page to its B1 v . Here, a third of the way down on Q2 B1 v , the prefixes immediately forsake the flush setting and are indented like Q1's. The change in procedure midway on Q2's page coinciding with the change in procedure as Q1 began a new page is so manifestly the result of Q2's imitation of Q1 that Dr. Walker argues, "the change . . . can only have been due to the Q2 compositor's working from Q1 and mechanically following his 'copy'. Corroborative evidence that the Q2 compositor was working from a copy of Q1 is found (as Greg also noted, loc. cit. ) in the commas which appear at the end of speeches at I.i.6 and I.i.15." (2) After noting that the Q2 title-page was obviously set up from that in Q1, she continues: There was, of course, no need for Roberts's compositor when he began work on Q2 to consult Q1 in order to determine how to arrange speech prefixes, and there was even less need for him to continue to consult Q1 when he had decided what arrangement to adopt. We must therefore, I think, assume that the compositor worked from a corrected copy of Q1 at any rate as far as I.i.30 where indenting of speech prefixes begins. If correction of Q1 had proved practicable so far (and it cannot have been a light matter in the opening dialogue), there is no reason why it should not have been continued until the divergence between the texts was such that correction of Q1 was of no further advantage. Correction as far as the end of Act I would certainly have been practicable, and that the compositor of Q2 worked to this point from a corrected copy of Q1 is abundantly evident from the spellings common to Q1 and Q2: 'glimses' (I.iv.53), 'Angle linckt' (I.v.55), 'leaprous' (I.v.64), 'Sellerige' (I.v.151). 17 Dr. Walker then rests her case by pointing out that (with the possible exception of Valtemand's speech in II.ii) the agreements in anomalous spellings cease after Act I and thereafter Q2 continues by introducing anomalies of its own. No common typographical errors appear after Act I, and various of Q2's blunders could scarcely have been made from Q1 printed copy. After the end of Act I, therefore, it is concluded, the use of Q1 was abandoned, and it was not even consulted occasionally since finding the relevant matter would have wasted much time, often to no purpose. "In the absence of any reading common to Q1 and Q2 which is certainly erroneous, it would seem legitimate to suppose that Q2 is an independent witness from the end of Act I." It is perhaps unnecessary to point out (as stated above, this was not Dr. Walker's main case) that rather far-reaching inferences are here drawn from evidence which may be susceptible of quite another interpretation, and that the evidence itself is suggestive rather than demonstrative. For example, it is assumed that the only purpose for which the Q2 compositor would consult Q1 on sig. B1 recto and verso would be to determine how to arrange his prefixes, and since that proposition is patently absurd, the inference is drawn that the similarity in treatment of the prefixes could have resulted only from the use of Q1 as actual copy. On this assumption it is further assumed that since the far from easy annotation of the text on B1 recto and verso was therefore practicable, it would be no more difficult elsewhere in the first act, and that the anomalous spellings demonstrate it. On the other hand, if we start with a different set of inferences, and conjecture that the Q2 compositor was closely consulting Q1 in conjunction with his manuscript, it is by no means improbable that he would have his eye so fixed on Q1 that he would be led to follow its typographical treatment of the speech-prefixes. And roughly similar close consultation would thereupon explain, just as well, the further evidence for agreement between the quartos. Neither logic nor the available evidence enforces us to believe one or other theory without the presentation of more detailed and certain evidence than has hitherto been published. Before the presentation of such evidence is attempted, we may try to clear the ground of the 'occasional consultation' theory. Dr. Walker is certainly correct in her arguments that the speech-prefix typography on B1 r-v goes far beyond anything that would have resulted from occasional and cautious reference to Q1 by the Q2 compositor puzzled about a reading in his manuscript. Moreover, two of the three irregular commas on sig. B1 come direct from Q1: Q1 1. O you come most carefully vpon your watch, Mar. And leegemen to the Dane, O farewell honest souldier, . . . Q2 Fran. You come most carefully vpon your houre, (I.i.6) 18 Mar. And Leedgemen to the Dane, Fran. Giue you good night. (I.i.15-16) In spite of the fact that an anomalous end-of-the-speech comma (without reference to Q1) appears in Q2 after Bernardo's "Long liue the King" (I.i.3), the first comma at the end of both the above speeches is imitative; and the second is decisive, for a comma in Q1 at the end of a line that was continued has become a comma to end a speech in Q2. Occasional consultation to puzzle out a difficult word cannot include such close imitation as this. Nor is it possible to assume here, as has been done in Q2 of Romeo and Juliet , 19 that once the compositor referred to his printed bad quarto to confirm a difficult manuscript reading, he thereupon for a few lines set from the quarto rather than his manuscript. What reading would have proved difficult enough by line 6 of the play to call in use the printed Q1 is certainly questionable, but even so the second comma cannot result from continuing to set from Q1, for the two texts diverge so greatly that only the manuscript would have provided the intervening readings. One would not wish, perhaps, for another consultation to have taken place by line 14 or 15 in order to decipher a manuscript word. However, the case cannot rest on only one page, positive as its evidence is, for one might argue, on the evidence of the speech-prefixes and these commas, that the Q2 compositor gave a special treatment, which he abandoned later, to the first page or so. For a typical passage we may turn to sig. C2: Q1 Hor. Two nights together had these Gentlemen, Marcellus and Bernardo , on their watch, In the dead vast and middle of the night. Beene thus incountered by a figure like your father, Armed to poynt, exactly Capapea Appeeres before them thrise, he walkes Before their weake and feare oppressed eies. Within his tronchions length, While they distilled almost to gelly. With the act of feare stands dumbe, And speake not to him. . . . Q2 Hora. Two nights together had these gentlemen Marcellus, and Barnardo , on their watch In the dead wast and middle of the night Beene thus incountred, a figure like your father Armed at poynt, exactly Capapea Appeares before them, and with solemne march, Goes slowe and stately by them; thrice he walkt By their opprest and feare surprised eyes Within his tronchions length, whil'st they distil'd Almost to gelly, with the act of feare Stand dumbe and speake not to him. . . . (I.ii.196-206) Here Capapea is one of the usually noted coincidences offered as evidence of consultation for a difficult reading. Wilson also lists tronchions and gelly as other words in which the spelling has been drawn from Q1. If so, we have rapid consultation, for the text between Capapea and tronchions could not be set from Q1 alone. If, on the other hand, Q1 was again consulted, this time from tronchions , then we should be forced to believe that the compositor did in fact continue from Q1 without reference to his manuscript, not only to produce gelly but also, possibly, the stop after gelly instead of after feare , which affects the modification in a manner rejected by most editors. In the same scene, studient is another of Wilson's concurrences. Q1 Ham. O I pre thee do not mocke mee fellow studient, I thinke it was to see my mothers wedding. Hor. Indeede my Lord, it followed hard vpon. Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio , the funerall bak't meates Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables, Q2 Ham. I prethee doe not mocke me fellowe studient, I thinke it was to my mothers wedding. Hora. Indeede my Lord it followed hard vppon. Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio , the funerall bak't meates Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables, (I.ii.177-181) The anomalous apostrophe in bak't is in fact as imitative in Q2 as is the spelling studient , and demonstrates that if the Q2 compositor consulted Q1 to read studient (granted there could be the necessity), then he certainly kept on with Q1, setting Q2 from the printed text, on the evidence of the form bak't . As suggested before, this goes far beyond occasional and cautious consultation if it were true. Many other passages of similar nature could be offered to the same result. In this connection one may compare the lines in the familiar I.i.70-79 containing the much noticed common error cost as well as strikt , forraine marte , and ship-writes listed by Wilson. But these are no stronger as evidence than the inconspicuous Q1 How look't he, frowningly? His beard was grisleld, no. Keepe wassel, and the swaggering vpspring reeles, And as he dreames, his draughts of renish downe, The kettle, drumme, and trumpet, thus bray out, That beckles ore his bace, into the sea I sent the mornings ayre, Hic &amp; vbique Then are Dream't of, in your philosophie, Q2 What look't he frowningly? (I.ii.231) His beard was grissl'd, no. (I.ii.240) Keepes wassell and the swaggring vpspring reeles: And as he draines his drafts of Rennish downe, The kettle drumme, and trumpet, thus bray out, (I.iii.8-11) That bettles ore his base into the sea, (I.iv.71) I sent the morning ayre, (I.v.58) Hic, &amp; vbique (I.v.156) Then are dream't of in your philosophie, (I.v.167) A careful collation establishes, in my opinion, evidence not for sporadic consultation for the definite purpose of deciphering a single word, as has formerly been argued, but instead a relatively constant and steady influence on Q2 from Q1 in small as well as in the more obvious coincidences. Moreover, this influence is steadier than would have occurred if there had been occasional consultation followed by setting a few lines direct from Q1, as convenient, in the manner conjectured for Q2 Romeo and Juliet . Not only this, but most of the passages of any extent where such a procedure might have been practicable show that, in fact, it was not employed, for always readings intrude which must have come from manuscript. Lines I.ii.177-181 above, which exactly mirror Q1, are most unusual if not unique. Ordinarily we have mixed passages like I.ii.196-206 and I.iii.8-11, also quoted above. Occasional consultation to decipher some special word, followed by setting for a few lines from Q1, cannot be established in Hamlet . It was undoubtedly the observance of this steady stream of influence which led Dr. Walker, quite justly, to reject the Wilson occasional-consultation theory. Whether the alternative must be the hypothesis that Q1 was annotated for Act I to serve as printer's copy may now become the point of enquiry. Only recently has the basic material been made available to conduct such an investigation. Results for which any validity might be claimed could be reached only if the text from which the evidence must be drawn could be established as uniform in its typesetting, or diverse; that is, whether one identifiable compositor set the text so that we can count on uniformity of treatment, or whether two were engaged, who would need to be distinguished and their work isolated for separate examination. Moreover, some control material set by the compositor in question would need to be studied to offer independent evidence about his characteristics when setting from manuscript and from printed text. From the researches of Dr. Walker, of Mr. J. R. Brown, and of Messrs. Cantrell and Williams, we now know that only one compositor, the man we call X, set sheets B-D containing Act I; and we also know that among other books for Roberts this workman had a hand in setting The Merchant of Venice from manuscript and the second quarto of Titus Andronicus from printed text. We thus have not an ideal but at least some amount of contemporary dramatic text of two sorts to act as a control for comparison. The method of investigation will be to analyze the characteristics of compositor X chiefly when setting parts of Titus Andronicus Q2 from printed copy and then to compare these with his characteristics in Q2 Hamlet , the purpose being to attempt to determine whether in Hamlet he was using an annotated quarto as printer's copy. Such an investigation could be readily managed if the purpose were merely to demonstrate that Q1 had exerted an influence on compositor X. For example, one could point to his usual practice in Hamlet of spelling gracious and malicious either when Q1 is not present or when Q1, as usual, spells gratious and malitious . One could also point to these characteristic spellings in the Merchant and show in Titus that t spellings in Q1 were similarly altered to c. Thus when in Hamlet on B3 v , I.i.164, we find—for the only time—compositor X setting gratious , we are justified no doubt in pointing to the Q1 t spelling at that place as the reason. Similarly, the concurrence of the two quartos at I.v.17 (D2 v ) in stars , whereas elsewhere compositor X sets starres , is also evidence for influence, and there are other cases of the same sort of thing. For instance, though X has some predilection for odd apostrophes, as in tain't (I.v.85), low'd (III.iv.52), temp't (III.iv.182), yet even the similar op't at I.iv.50 and pop't at V.ii.65 cannot destroy the significance of Q2 agreeing with Q1 in bak't and look't (I.ii.180, 231). On the other hand, it is freely admitted that the Q2 compositor of sheets B-D must have consulted Q1 frequently and closely, either in annotated or in unannotated form. Hence there is no reason to suppose that concurrence of the two quartos in spellings uncharacteristic of compositor X can be used in any profitable way as evidence for the precise method by which he employed Q1. His own spelling characteristics were so strong for some words and forms (as in heere ) that both in Titus and in Hamlet he habitually altered his copy for these words. Even though for other words his habits were less firmly fixed, it appears to me to be impossible to show that in line after line his concurrence with Q1 was so extreme that no form of consultation could explain the agreements satisfactorily, and hence one would be forced into the assumption that annotated Q1 must have been the printer's copy. The extreme concurrence in all details necessary to convince us of an annotated quarto is not, in my opinion, found in Q2 Hamlet . Moreover, as will be illustrated below, there is such a comparative lack of influence from Q1 in some details that should have affected Q2 if Q1 had actually been the printer's copy that the case against annotated Q1 copy can, in effect, be demonstrated by negative evidence. Other evidence must first be surveyed, however. Despite the undoubted indications that Q1 influenced Q2 spelling with some frequency, it is still possible to argue that when Q1 contains a characteristic X spelling, and when in Q2 compositor X diverges into an uncharacteristic form, the uncharacteristic form came from manuscript copy and hence we cannot have an annotated quarto. An example might be the Q2 spelling of eies at I.i.58 where Q1 reads eyes . From Titus Q2 we know that compositor X preferred the y spelling in such forms: in the Titus pages assigned by Cantrell and Williams 20 to X, eyes appears thrice (E2, E3, I3), and each time with y despite the fact that the Q1 copy was spelled eies . Better evidence for X's preference is found in The Merchant of Venice : here in the seven times that the word appears in X's share the spelling is invariably eyes . Of the total of fifteen appearances in X's pages in Hamlet , fourteen times the spelling is eyes despite the occasional Q1 eies . Thus when in I.i.58 for the only time in three plays we meet the anomalous spelling eies in X's typesetting, given the Q1 spelling eyes at that place it is possible to argue that eies was produced by manuscript influence and that an annotated Q1 was therefore not the printer's copy. To take another example, we find at I.i.23 that Q2 has saies though Q1 reads sayes . In the Merchant X's spelling is invariably sayes, which is the form for the only three occurrences in Titus (all on H1) although Q1 read saies . Elsewhere in Hamlet X sets the word only three times and in each place in text that must have had manuscript copy. Twice it appeares as saies (I.ii.57, I.iii.24) and once as sayes (II.ii.198). By analogy with y forms that X prefers in words like dayes and wayes , as well as from the evidence for y in the Merchant and Titus Q2, it would appear that ordinarily X preferred sayes but could be influenced by his copy to set the form saies . The difficulty of this method is to secure a sufficient number of reasonably invariant or strongly preferential spellings from which to argue for the influence of manuscript copy when Q2 veers to an uncharacteristic spelling in places where the Q1 form represents his normal usage. The preferential spellings listed by Mr. Brown to distinguish X from Y provide insufficient data since X is so very conservative in departing from them. For example, of the eight times in sheets B-D of Hamlet that X uses the uncharacteristic ending -ow or -ew instead of his normal -owe and -ewe , three must have been set from manuscript even though the remaining five agree with the very characteristic -ow or -ew endings in Q1 for the same words. The evidence is a stand-off, it would seem, for the appearance of the short form in parts set from manuscript suggests that the concurrences with Q1 may be fortuitous and X merely indulging in a minority spelling. Similarly, in the one time that X sets uncharacteristic said , and in the two occurrences of maddam , the manuscript must have been his copy. Hence the single occurrence of uncharacteristic honourd following Q1 may be fortuitous. Of all these distinguishing words, perhaps the strongest case is reuenge . Elsewhere in Hamlet X sets reuendge invariably, but the first three times the word appears (all on one page, D2 v ) it takes the conventional form of reuenge found in Q1. Some argument might be made for Q1 influence here; but even so there are difficulties, for on this Q2 page the first occurrence of reuenge (18 lines above the second) must have been set from manuscript. Moreover, although in Titus and the Merchant X exhibits a general liking for dg spellings, he never sets reuendge in either play. It is unfortunate that in the B-D pages the word does not appear again, for the evidence of sig. D2 v is far from conclusive. Clearly, such evidence as the above that rests in this manner on the distinguishing spellings is so mixed as to be of dubious value either as showing the influence of Q1 or of manuscript. 21 On the other hand, Mr. Brown points out that various of the significant spellings which he chooses as characteristic of each compositor in Hamlet do not always hold from book to book set by the same two men, and therefore some of the seemingly significant spellings may do no more than reflect the compositors' general faithfulness to the characteristics of their copy. In his opinion, this appears to be especially true of the -owe and -ewe endings which are one of the best means of indicating the two compositors in Hamlet . If this is so, the evidence that in sheets B-D compositor X spelled such words just as uniformly as he did in the other sheets he set, which must have been at least predominantly uninfluenced by Q1 and utilizing manuscript as printer's copy, might well have a significance. For example, in Titus Q2 in the pages assigned to X of at least 23 occurrences X follows the Q1 -ow and -ew forms 21 times and only twice alters -ow to -owe (F2 v and I2 v , the latter time possibly for justification). This is so slavish a following of copy as quite to reverse the characteristics X exhibits in Hamlet . That these heavily majority -owe and -ewe endings in Hamlet represent the characteristics of the copy behind Hamlet and not a hardening of X's habits in the interval between 1600 and 1604 is an opinion rather firmly held by Mr. Brown on the evidence of the mixed characteristics of other books he has examined between these years, and after Hamlet , in which X's typesetting appears. In Hamlet Act I, of the 22 times that Q2 has a corresponding word in Q1, compositor X concurs in the -ow and -ew form with Q1 only five times, and would have changed Q1's -ow or -ew to -owe and -ewe seventeen times. This contrasts so markedly with Titus and yet is so consistent with the remaining Hamlet sheets as to lead to a presumption that Q1 was not the copy from which X was basically setting his type. More marked spelling differences in which Hamlet departs from the Q1 form like twelfe for twelue (three times), hundreth for hundred ( hundred on sig. F2 v ) and perticuler or particuler for particular fail for lack of evidence in the Merchant or Titus . The form a leauen for eleuen is also found as a leuen in X's part of the Merchant but whether this is compositorial spelling or the influence of copy is not clear. However, in these spellings, as also in staukes for Q1 stalkes , brazon for brazen , forfait for forfeit , a maz'd for amazed , a bord for aboord , familier for familiar , a doption for adoption , springs for springes , beckins for beckons , horrable for horrible , pray for prey , barckt for barked , oremastret for or'emaister it , it would appear that we have compositor X departing more widely from his copy spelling than he did in Titus , provided Q1 of Hamlet had been his copy. There are some readings which it is difficult to derive from Q1. Perhaps the most prominent of these comes in I.v.55-57. Q2 reads: So but though to a radiant Angle linckt, Will sort it selfe in a celestiall bed And pray on garbage. The Angle linckt here has placed this passage on all lists as influenced by Q1, which has So Lust, though to a radiant angle linckt, Would fate it selfe from a celestiall bedde, And prey on garbage: a version supported by Folio Lust and sate , though F corrects the misprint fate (f for ſ) and supports Q2 in reading in for from a celestial bed. Although an argument might be raised in favor of reading sort it selfe from , I have no doubt that the editorial choice of the Folio version is correct, since Q2 in shows that sate must be the reading; and otherwise we should need to believe that Q1-F sate was a prompt-copy corruption. If sate is correct, then sort is scarcely a memorial error for Q1 fate , but instead—as has been remarked—a handwriting misreading as or of an a open at the top of a kind found elsewhere in Shakespeare. I have no opinion about Q2 but for lust except that it is more probably a simple handwriting misreading than the product of Wilson's ubiquitous miscorrector. The nature of these two errors does not suggest by any means (despite the Angle linckt ) that when he was setting these specific words the compositor had his eye on Q1. An annotated quarto corrector would, one would suppose, merely substitute an s for the Q1 misprint f in fate , and not write out the whole word. If, on the other hand, we exonerate the compositor and blame the annotator for the misreading, thus still arguing for an annotated quarto, we must presumably blame him also for substituting nonsense not only here but also in but for Lust . On the evidence of Titus , compositor X was quite reasonably careful when setting from printed copy and his mistakes are few, at least of such a serious nature. On the other hand, how he could get mixed up with manuscript copy may be shown by such lines as Hamlet I.iii.129-131: But meere imploratotors of vnholy suites Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds The better to beguide. Here a misprint appears in three successive lines (there is not much doubt, I think, that bonds should be bauds ). Such typesetting is unknown in Titus (or in the Merchant where copy seems to have been clean), but it is found in Hamlet Act I, where it provides evidence, or strong presumption, for composition from manuscript. It is perhaps fortunate that the two misreadings but and sort occur in the same and the next line to the Angle linckt phrase, commonly taken as one of the strongest proofs of Q1 influence. On the evidence of but and sort , if Angle linckt came from Q1, as I agree it must, it was not set from an annotated quarto. Memorial error in a compositor is difficult to analyse sometimes, but I should believe that the following errors or oddities in Q2 were less likely to have come from Q1 copy than from setting from a manuscript: brazon for Q1 brazen (I.i.73), your spirits for Q1 you Spirites (I.i.38), Or euer for Q1 Ere euer (I.ii.183), what someuer for Q1 whatsoeuer (I.ii.249), fonde deedes for Q1 foule deeds (I.ii.257), Or of a most select for Q1 Are of a most select (I.iii.74), Withall for Q1 With all (I.v.79), Oremastret 22 for Q1 Or'emaistret (I.v.140), and perhaps even horrowes for Q1 horrors . 23 Except for the Lust-but and fate-sort readings, which I am inclined to take seriously, the import of the above may perhaps be a matter of opinion. However, there are two other orders of evidence which must be considered. On the evidence of X's pages in Titus , he followed his printed copy in the matter of elision and its forms with some scrupulousness. It is true, that he showed some tendency to introduce an apostrophe: in these Titus pages he reproduced 4 Q1 apostrophes, ignored none, and added 7 to Q1 elisions without apostrophe. On the other hand, at least 41 times he followed the exact form from Q1, with especial reference to final d or t in preterite or participle, as in skipt , possest , and distild among a number of others. He did not elide any word for metrical reasons, although various might have been so treated. The treatment in Hamlet differs. In Act I compositor X could have followed 12 Q1 forms with apostrophe, but 11 times he omitted an apostrophe (though maintaining the elision) when one was present in Q1. Only 3 apostrophes were added to Q1 forms elided without apostrophe; he followed elided forms without apostrophe 10 times with the same -d or -t ending; he elided 6 Q1 full forms (of a sort less likely to be an annotator's) without apostrophe, and 11 with apostrophe. The additional freedom with which the Q1 text would have been treated, if it had been copy, is marked compared to Titus, especially for the freedom with which in Hamlet X dropped the apostrophe, a habit not observed in Titus . All in all, such variation would seem to point to manuscript rather than to printed copy, for we cannot suppose an annotator would busy himself about such minutiae, and X (on the evidence of Titus ) was a compositor much influenced in such matters by printed copy. 24 It is interesting, moreover, to see that in Act I of Hamlet whenever he is setting from manuscript he uses the spelling then for than invariably, and that his practice does not change in lines which could have been set from Q1, although Q1 normally has the than form. On the other hand, setting from printed copy in Titus he follows Q1 than four times, and changes than to then only once. Since in Titus he shows only a slight tendency towards then , it might be argued that in the intervening years his habitual spelling hardened and hence the difference developed in Hamlet ; but this will not hold water, for in the Merchant , set the same year as Titus Q2, then for than is as invariable as it is in Hamlet . 25 General experience with compositorial characteristics shows a tendency for the workman to be more influenced by copy-spellings when setting from printed copy than from manuscript. It would seem, then, either that in Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice compositor X's usual habits showed much more strongly than in Titus because in both he was working from manuscript, or else, as Mr. Brown has argued from other evidence, the copy for Hamlet and the Merchant was basically similar in its spelling characteristics and that compositor X followed these with some faithfulness in his setting of the two plays. In either case, the evidence is against the use of an annotated quarto for Hamlet Act I. Despite the fact that various Q1 spelling and other forms are repeated in Q2, there is more essential divergence than similarity. The comparison with Titus , supported for some words by the Merchant , does not encourage the hypothesis that annotated Q1 was X's immediate printer's copy: his divergences from Q1 characteristics are more likely to agree with the Merchant set from manuscript than they are with Titus set from printed copy. The treatment given the punctuation by compositor X in Act I of Hamlet constitutes the next range of evidence. Mr. Brown, who went through various Roberts books for his investigation, believes that the light punctuation found in the Merchant and in Hamlet is not especially characteristic of the two compositors. Lumping their work together, he points out that in the Titus reprint they made some 240 changes towards heavier punctuation in comparison with some 120 in which the Q1 punctuation was made lighter. He concludes, " Titus Andronicus therefore suggests that the compositors of Hamlet and The Merchant tended to add to the punctuation, not reduce it." 26 A study of X's specific treatment of his copy punctuation in Titus has various points of interest for the Hamlet investigation. In the Titus pages assigned to X by Messrs. Cantrell and Williams, I count 18 commas added where Q1 had no punctuation, but only 8 of Q1's commas omitted. One Q1 comma is wrongly made into a period, very likely a misprint; a wrong Q1 comma is correctly altered to a full stop; five Q1 clause-ending commas are changed to periods; and a period is correctly added at the end of a sentence. In an obvious query a question mark is substituted for a Q1 period. Two Q1 colons are reduced to commas as slight improvements, and one colon is correctly removed. Only one semi-colon appears, where it is copied from Q1. X thrice strengthens a Q1 comma to a colon, once a comma to a query, and once a colon to a period. The evidence shows that he was usually content to follow printed copy with remarkable fidelity, and that his alterations were only sporadic and far from consistently introduced. The increased heaviness of the Titus Q2 punctuation over that for Q1, therefore, seldom lies in the substitution of heavier for lighter stops but instead in the addition of commas. Ten of these added commas are inserted between independent clauses, ordinarily when no conjunction is present; two separate parts of a complex sentence; and one each marks apposition, direct address, a vocative, an ejaculation, and a phrase. Once an unnecessary line-ending comma is added. Of the eight Q1 commas omitted, five delete not wholly necessary line-ending pauses, one a caesural pause; and two omissions are in error. The single copying of a semi-colon in Titus compared to the fairly frequent use of this stop in the Merchant and Act I of Hamlet could indicate similarity of copy in the latter but might also indicate that when setting from manuscript compositor X felt free to follow his own proclivities. In sheets B-D of Hamlet in all places when Q2 and Q1 verbal readings coincide, there are 44 changes strengthening the punctuation as against 114 making it lighter. The largest number of changes comes (exactly contrary to Titus ) when 75 Q1 commas are removed and nothing substituted. In this lightening of punctuation the next in number are 10 semi-colons reduced to commas, 8 colons reduced to commas, 5 question marks reduced to commas, 4 periods altered to commas, 3 sets of parentheses removed, 2 each of queries reduced to periods, colons to semicolons, periods to nothing, semi-colons to nothing, and one exclamation reduced to nothing. On the heavier side, we find 15 additions of commas where no punctuation had appeared, followed by 8 commas made into semi-colons, 7 commas made into periods, 3 sets of parentheses added, 2 each of added periods from nothing, colons from nothing, colons changed to queries, colons changed to periods, and 1 each of a semicolon added, a query added, an exclamation substituted for a comma, and a query for an exclamation. Obviously, the treatment in Titus Q2 of the punctuation in the Q1 printed text differs from that found in sheets B-D of Q2 Hamlet if annotated Q1 had been the printer's copy. We cannot say that Q1 Hamlet is an overpunctuated text; but in contrast to the 18 commas added in Titus and 8 reduced, we have 14 added as against 75 reduced. These statistics, moreover, must be viewed against the fact that as a general proposition the punctuation of Q2 Hamlet (with special reference to sheets B-D) approximates that of the Merchant . Finally, although such a judgment is bound to be subjective, perhaps, I am not impressed by any differences in the punctuation method between the parts of Hamlet after sheet D which compositor X set from manuscript and the system he employed in the area of contamination. Since in Titus he had shown himself to be a close follower of his printed copy's punctuation, the natural inference in Hamlet is that—whether he was following his manuscript copy fairly closely or else largely punctuating for himself—compositor X was not setting type directly from printed copy. There are agreements in oddities of punctuation, just as there are agreements in spelling, but the results will not permit us to conjecture that conditions were the same (plus annotation) in Hamlet as in Titus . One final variety of evidence may be mentioned. It is perhaps speculative to assert that an annotator of Q1 would not be likely to prove so scrupulous to make such minor changes as he to colloquial a and similar small matters. But speech-prefixes and their forms are something else. In reprints, in so far as the compositor can—consistent with any problems of justification—there is a general tendency to follow the forms of speech-prefixes in printed copy, and indeed this fact has been used as bibliographical evidence for the reliance of one edition on another. 27 One should notice that in Titus Q2 compositor X alters the forms of Q1 prefixes only seven times, and thus shows that he was a conservative follower of printed copy. Hence it is more than a trifle odd in Hamlet sheets B-D that though the Q1 prefix for Horatio is invariably Hor. , we find with but three exceptions on one page, sig. B3, 28 that Q2 invariably prefixes the form Hora. , and this even on the first page, B1, when certain Q1 characteristics are being followed so closely that the speech-prefixes are outset and two faulty speech-ending commas are faithfully reproduced. This alone is suspicious if an annotated quarto is in question. But there are also other grounds for suspicion. In some respects the prefixes of the two compositors differ sufficiently to show that they did not (as we should scarcely suspect) make up an agreed-upon list. For example, in sheets C and D compositor X sets Ophe . (Q1 Ofel. ) but in sheet G and H compositor Y almost invariably sets Oph. Compositor Y's treatment of Horatio is interesting. On G4, the first time the character appears in Y's stint, he is initially Hora. but then Hor. once on the same page and once on the verso. On H3, next, he is Hora. three times and Hor. once. On L2 v he is Hora. twice and Hor. twice; on L3 Hor. once. In sigs. M2 v -3 v he is Hora. seven times and Hor. twice. Yet when X takes over with sheet N he is Hora. without exception to the end of the play. The fixity of X's use, though it runs counter to the Q1 form which in an annotated quarto he would constantly have been looking at in sheets B-D, may well have been taken (at least originally) from manuscript; and the manuscript may well be reflected in Y's variable but majority use of the longer form, also, although elsewhere Y almost invariably sets prefixes of only one syllable, as Oph. for X's Ophe. In X's persistence against Q1 in the long form Hora. , I believe we have additional evidence of some especial weight to oppose the theory that an annotated quarto was used as printer's copy. As a postscript to this presentation of the evidence against an annotated quarto as printer's copy one matter of opinion may be mentioned. If a copy of Act I of Q1 had been annotated in the printer's shop, we should presume this had been done before copy was cast off for Y's entrance. If so, it is almost inexplicable that copy was cast off with such exactness as to bring the last seven lines, only, of this annotated material onto the first page of Y's stint rather than assigning it to X and starting Y off with the first scene of Act II. On the other hand, if the example of Q1 had not been annotated, the division which runs over the last seven lines of Act I onto sig. E1 set by compositor Y is the more understandable. Incidentally, it is clear that Y did not have access to a copy of Q1 when he was setting sheet E. [ to be concluded ]</field>

Alexander 9, Sisson 10, Wilson 10, Kittredge 19, Harrison 20, and Campbell 20. These compare with Old Cambridge 21. In this list I.iii.65 has been omitted as ambiguous. Also, Wilson's notion that I.ii.129 sallied is a contaminated misspelling for sullied has not been counted as an item of contamination since the issue is actually between sallied (or sullied ) and solid . For a new view of this celebrated crux, see my "Hamlet's Sallied or Solid Flesh: A Bibliographical Case-History," forthcoming in Shakespeare Survey, vol. 9. 5 "The Textual Problem of Hamlet : A Reconsideration," RES , new ser., II (1951), 328-338.

See also under Additions and Corrections in the present volume. 10 J. R. Brown, "The Compositors of Hamlet Q2 and The Merchant of Venice ," Studies in Bibliography , VII (1955), 17-40. It will be noticed that this evidence quite upsets Dover Wilson's conjectures that Q2 was set throughout by a single workman who was inexperienced and incompetent. Instead, Q2 was composed by the two regular workmen in Roberts' shop, who had been setting type for him quite efficiently for some time. 11 The reason why X assisted with two pages from sheet L are somewhat obscure, as is the reason for the behavior of the running-titles with sheets M and N if this is indeed the order of the sheets printed at this point. However, these difficulties have nothing to do with the central fact for our purposes here, which is that sheet F was begun by Y in fairly close conjunction with the start of sheet B by X. 12 The same publisher Nicholas Ling was responsible for both editions. However, we have no evidence whether he supplied Roberts with a copy of Q1 at the time he handed him the manuscript, as we might reasonably suppose, or whether Roberts independently secured a copy to see if it would assist him in the printing. Under the circumstances, the first is perhaps the more plausible. 13 RES , op. cit. , pp. 328-330. 14 I take this sentence to mean that—because of the uncertainty about the amount of consultation—the authority of Q2 could be considered by an editor to be no greater if he hypothecates occasional consultation than it would be if the printer's copy were taken to be an annotated Q1. 15 Walker, ibid. , pp. 329-330. 16 W. W. Greg, The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare (1951 ed.), p. 64, n. 2. 17 RES , op. cit. , p. 330. The importance in the similar anomalous spellings from the fourth and fifth scenes lies in the fact that Greg, who believed (following Wilson) that Q1 was merely consulted by Q2, also placed the consultation only near the beginning. Dr. Walker then continues with arguments against the similarities having been introduced independently from the use of 'parts' in the copy for Q1; and emphasizes that they are too close to have been fortuitously produced in two different printing houses from two dissimilar manuscripts. 18 Line references to Hamlet throughout this paper are to those marginally printed in the Shakespeare Association Quarto Facsimile of Q2. These correspond almost exactly to the standard Globe numbering. Quotations, with modernized s , are from this edition of Q2 and the Huntington Library facsimile of Q1. 19 The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet , ed. Richard Hosley (Yale University Press, 1954), p. 162. This hypothesis is elaborated in the same author's "The Copy for the Second Quarto of Romeo and Juliet (1599)," in SQ for autumn, 1955. 20 P. L. Cantrell &amp; G. W. Williams, "Roberts' Compositors in Titus Andronicus Q2," in this present volume, an article correcting and amplifying the earlier investigation of J. R. Brown. The pages in Titus Q2 assigned to compositor X are as follows: A3, A3 v , B3 v , B4, B4 v , C4 v , D2 v , D3, D4 v , E2, E3, E4 v , F2 v , H1, H3 v , H4, H4 v , I2 v , I3, I3 v , K3 v , K4. The evidence for some of these pages is better than for others; but if a few should subsequently prove to be Y's work, instead, I doubt whether the statistics will be materially altered. 21 It will be recalled, of course, that evidence must bear differently on the two problems. Demonstration that Q2 follows Q1 spellings does not prove the copy was an annotated quarto, whereas demonstration that manuscript spellings influenced the compositor to set uncharacteristic forms in places where Q1 agreed with his habitual practice and the printed word would have been his copy will prove that the annotated-quarto theory cannot be maintained. 22 It is worthy of note, also, that compositor X prefers the spelling maister in the Merchant . 23 It is possible that the form horrowes exhibits only the standard a:o confusion, although I should not wish to deny the possibility that a mixed memory of Q1 here contaminated the Q2 word. On the other hand, if we are to hypothecate an annotated quarto, we must suppose that the annotator altered r to w but neglected to correct the vowel. This may be harder to envisage. Similarly, bettles at Q2 I.iv.71 seems unlikely to be an annotator's incomplete alteration of Q1 beckles , though here (as perhaps with horrowes ), it seems more probable that a mixed memory of the word in the manuscript and in Q1 (with the sound influence from Q1 of the short e ) has produced the Q2 form. 24 Yet for some words his copy had no influence whatever on his conventional spelling.

      <field name="heading_text">Quarto Copy for Folio Henry V by Andrew S. Cairncross</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I I propose to argue that the First Folio text of Henry V was set up, so far as that was found feasible, from one or more corrected exemplars of the bad quarto. 1 To my knowledge this has not hitherto been suggested. In spite of the later developed evidence for Richard III and King Lear , Pollard's original belief 2 that no bad quarto served as copy in any sense for the Folio may be largely responsible for the reluctance of modern critics to follow out the consequences of certain QF similarities in Henry V that seemed to point in this direction. Sir Walter Greg, for example, called attention to a "minor problem of interest"—certain "alterations made in the text" of The Contention and The True Tragedy , Q3 (1619), which "anticipate the yet unpublished texts of 2 and 3 Henry VI ," and added, "The same phenomenon is found less markedly in the 1608 (1619) edition of Henry V (Q3) . . . the exact origin and significance of the alterations have never . . . been explained." 3 Sir Edmund Chambers 4 noted Greg's point, but made no comment. He noted also (p. 391) that "a few marginal notes for action (II.i.103; IV.viii.9; V.i.30) are common to Q1 and F," and suggested a skeleton "plot" in the hands of the reporters of Q. Greg later 5 doubted the existence of this "plot." As for the "notes for action," or stage-directions, he though that "If anything these may point to some influence of Q upon F, an influence also suggested by the occasional appearance at the same point in both of anomalously divided lines, though there is no question of F having been printed from a copy (however much corrected) of Q." No reason is given for this opinion, nor any alternative explanation of what this "influence" could have been, or how it worked. Presumably he thought that the certainty of Pollard's conclusions made the supposition incredible. I propose to argue further that two editions of the quarto, Q2 and Q3, were used as basis for F, and—though this is independent of the use of Q copy in general, and much more tentative—that such use was due to the printers, and not to Heminge and Condell, or the theatre; that the use of Q2 at irregular intervals occurred at those points where correction of Q3—the main copy or basis—proved to be so heavy or complicated that some technique requiring the independent use of both sides of a quarto leaf—one from each quarto—was desirable; and that transcription, while not used for the whole of the "copy," was used, probably in the form of attached slips of paper, to supply the gaps, or "cuts," in the Q text, and perhaps (exceptionally) where a complicated rearrangement of Q material, especially from one Q page to another, made it necessary or convenient; that the whole procedure, in short, was flexible and contingent, and directed to the one aim of providing the compositors with copy, printed as far as possible, in the most convenient way. The practicability of the operation can be demonstrated from sample pages similarly corrected and illustrated below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II It is known and acknowledged that Henry V Q is a bad, or reported, text, much abbreviated, often inaccurate and unmetrical, and published, we may be certain, without the authority and consent of the author or his Company. The only passages with any claim to authenticity are those where players' "parts" are conjectured to have been available, such as those of Exeter, Gower, or the Governor of Harfleur (Chambers, op. cit. , I, 391-2). F, which includes much material absent from Q and, naturally, corrects its faulty metre and arrangement, necessarily rests (at least in the main and in intention, with the qualifications that will appear presently) on a manuscript supplied by Heminge and Condell. Between Q and F, therefore, except in the "parts," no bibliographical or other textual links ought to exist, except by the merest coincidence, if an independent manuscript served as printer's copy for F. Still less ought such links to exist between F and Q2 or Q3. For each of these, it is also agreed, was printed direct from Q1. 6 Both diverge, though in different ways, from Q1 in the introduction of a number of variants, especially misprints, and (particularly in Q3) of deliberate attempts, generally misguided, to improve the sense and the metre, and to modernise. Since, therefore, Q2 and Q3 are ( variant ) reprints of a bad quarto, any links between F and Q2 or Q3 where these vary from Q1, except in the correction of obvious errors or misprints, furnish double proof of F use of Q copy. In no other way is it possible to account for the close relationship between one text deriving from a theatrical manuscript (F) and another text removed from it, first by the process of reporting, and second by the errors or editing of a reprint (Q2 or Q3). A few chance coincidences could, of course, have occurred if the same compositors could be shown to have set exactly the same parts of Q2 and Q3 as each of them set in F. This is, on the face of it, highly improbable; and the suggestion is rendered further unlikely or irrelevant by the facts that most of the evidence offered below is beyond the scope of a compositor, and that Q2 was printed some twenty years earlier than F and in a different printinghouse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Now such links between F and Q2 or Q3 do exist in considerable numbers in Henry V . The verbal links are as numerous as those indicated by Dr. Alice Walker in her arguments for the use of Q copy in other plays ( Text. Pr. , pp. 1-3). And the number can be extended, for Henry V , by the latent errors, some of which can be identified, where F has failed to correct an error common to the quartos. Like the much more numerous QF links of punctuation, spelling, and lineation, these are beyond the range of coincidence, or of transcription, or indeed of any form of transmission except F use of corrected Q copy. The main verbal links (correct or probably correct readings are italicised) are:- Q2,F II.iii.49 world Q2,F; word Q1,3 IV.i.65 lewer Q1,2; fewer F; lower Q3 IV.viii.3 toward Q2,F; towards Q1,3 Q3,F II.i.32 honest Q1,2; omit Q3,F ii.177 ye Q1,2; you Q3,F iii.22 at Q1,2; on Q3,F iii.42 hell fire Q1,2; hell Q3,F iv.75 brother Q1,2; brother of Q3,F III.vi.106 abraided Q1,2; vpbraided Q3,F IV.iii.124 am Q1,2; vm Q3,F (= 'em) v.19 inough Q1,2; enow Q3,F vii.88 Cryspin, Cryspin Q1,2; Crispin Crispianus Q3,F vii.150 off from his Q1,2; from's Q3; from his F viii.50 as Q1,2; but as Q3,F V.i.14 Here a Q1,2; Heere he Q3,F i.31 meane time Q1,2; in the meane time Q3,F Here the greater number of Q3,F (as compared with Q2, F) agreements is explained by the fact that Q3 was the main "copy," and by the fact that Q3 varies much more widely from Q1 than does Q2. While one or two of the links may be disputed as doubtful ( e. g. lewer—lower—fewer), or as due to a common tendency towards modernization, or to a common printer, the general trend is clear enough. The same impression is conveyed by the stage-directions. These furnish particularly valuable evidence. They differ from the rest of the text in that they are independent of the memorial process of reproduction, and are therefore most unlikely, in the ordinary course, to agree exactly with those of a manuscript such as must have been available for F. Excluding possible "parts," which just might have carried some directions with them, the close agreement of so many stage-directions in Henry V adds further weight to the bibliographical connection between Q and F. It is fairly obvious that many F directions have been copied or edited from those of Q, sometimes abbreviated, and sometimes elaborated or conflated; and where the quartos vary among themselves, F agrees consistently with Q2 or Q3 against Q1. For example:- I.ii.7 Q Enter . . . 2. Bishops . . . (Q3 . . . two . . .) F Enter two Bishops. 234 Q Enter the Ambassadors from France. (Q1 Thambassadors; Q2 Th'ambassadors) F Enter Ambassadors of France. II.i.79 Q Enter the Boy. F Enter the Boy. 95 Q They draw. F Draw. III.ii.1 Q Enter Nim, Bardolfe, Pistoll, and Boy. (and om. Q1,2) F Enter Nim, Bardolph, Pistoll, and Boy. III.ii.1 Q Enter Gower and Flewellen. (Q3; Enter Gower. Q1,2) F Enter Captaines, English and Welch, Gower and Fluellen. IV.i.85 Q Enter three Souldiers. F Enter three Souldiers, Iohn Bates, Alexander Court, and Michael Williams. IV.iii.16 Q Enter the King. (Q2; the om. Q1,3) F Enter the King. IV.viii.7 Q He strikes him. F Strikes him. V.i.27 Q He strikes him. F Strikes him. V.ii.1 Q Enter at one doore, the King of England and his Lords. And at the other doore, the King of France, Queene Katherine, the Duke of Burbon, and others. F Enter at one doore, King Henry, Exeter, Bedford, Warwicke, and other Lords. At another, Queene Isabel, the King, the Duke of Bourgongne, and other French.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV Two of the most significant links between Q and F would be sufficient of themselves to prove the case for F dependence. The first makes it certain, also, that Q3 was the edition used at this point—II.i.39. According to the usual practice, Nim's interjection "Push." (Q) or "Pish." (F) is here given a line to itself in Q1 and Q2. In Q3 and F, however, it is printed in the same line as the last line of the previous speech—the only example of this in F. The second link shows F dependence on either Q2 or Q3. The texts compare as follows (IV.viii.104):- Q1 . . . but fiue and twentie. O God thy arme was here, Q2,3 . . . but fiue and twenty. King . O God, thy Arme was heere, F But fiue and twentie. O God, thy Arme was heere: The F indent in the second line is pointless and exceptional. It is merely a survival of the deletion, in the text of Q2 or Q3, of the erroneous speech-prefix King . This is also true of the retention of the unnecessary division of what are really two parts of the same verse line. To these links may be added a third, of equal significance, the unique instance, at II.i.98, in which both Q3 and F diverge from their normal practice and from that of Q1 and Q2 to use the speech-prefix form Pi. instead of Pis. or Pist. or (rarely) Pistoll . No doubt the Q3 compositor shortened the prefix in order to justify the line; but Q1 and Q2 had already used a fuller form in the same space, and Q3 has other lines, just as long, with the fuller forms. Again, the influence of Q, and of Q3 in particular, may be reasonably inferred from the following collation, from the only F passage which departs from the normal speech-prefix King .:- IV.vii.80 Q1 Kin. Q2 King. Q3 Kin. F Kin. 84 Kin. King. Kin. Kin. 101 Kin. Kin. King. King. 112 K. Kin. King. King. 116 Kin. Ki. Kin. Kin. 127 K. Ki. Kin. Kin. 131 Kin. Ki. King. King. 139 Kin. Kin. King. King. Here F follows the quite fortuitous variations of Q3, but shows no consistent relation to Q1 or Q2. Another significant phenomenon among the speech-prefixes is that they often change immediately after, and just as far as, Q copy ceased to be available (since the passages were wanting in Q, or too bad to be used as copy), and F had therefore to be set from the manuscript. This implies that, when the compositor switched over from one type of copy to another—from corrected quarto to manuscript—he was liable to switch, on some occasions, to the (different) speech-prefixes of that copy. This is what must have happened, for example, when the normal F prefix Flu. (Q Flew. ) becomes Welch. eight times consecutively at III.ii.64-133, a passage wanting in Q; and when the normal Hostess. becomes Woman. at II.iii.33. The coincidence of the changes with the gaps in Q confirms the use of Q copy on both sides ( i. e. before and after) these passages. Some of the most striking examples of corroborative evidence may now be presented in summary form; the Q text, unless otherwise stated, being taken from Q3, though Q2 may equally well have served, in most cases, as the copy. The strokes indicate the accepted line-division. Common QF mislineation II.iv.127-132 Q3 Dol . Say that my father render faire reply, It is against my will: For I desire nothing so much, As oddes with England. And for that cause, according to his youth, I did present him with those Paris balles. Exe . Hee'l make your Paris Louer shake for it, F Dolph . Say: if my Father render faire returne, It is against my will: for I desire Nothing but Oddes with England. To that end,/as matching to his Youth and Vanitie, I did present him with the Paris-Balls. Exe . Hee'le make your Paris Louer shake for it, The coincidence of Q and F in the erroneous line-ending "England" betrays the F dependence on its copy. Further bibliographical traces or links may appear in the common colon after "will", and the common spelling of Louvre. IV.i.295-8 (see also Plate VI below) Q3 Which euery day their withered hands hold vp To heauen, to pardon blood, And I haue built two Chanceries, more will I do: F Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold vp Toward Heauen, to pardon blood: And I haue built/two Chauntries, Where the sad and solemne Priests/sing still For Richards Soule. More will I doe: Here F ends two lines wrongly, one (296) directly from Q, the other by beginning a line with the F insertion ("Where . . . Soule."), which is itself misdivided. IV.viii.38-41 Q3 King . Let me see thy gloue. Looke you, this is the fellow of it. It was I indeede you promised to strike. And thou hast giuen me most bitter words. F King . Giue me thy Gloue Souldier; Looke, heere is the fellow of it: 'Twas I indeed thou promised'st to strike, And thou hast giuen me most bitter termes. Here the QF agreement in dividing the first line into two, at the same point, is suggestive, whether the line is prose (as usually printed), or verse, as Shakespeare probably intended. It is perhaps worth adding that F agrees specifically with Q3, since Q1 and Q2 divide after "Looke you". Italics The influence of Q on F may also be illustrated by the occasional departure of F from its normal practice as to the use of roman or italics for proper names, where it is influenced by, and follows, Q. For example, the conservative F compositor A, following his copy—at this point, Q3—diverges into using italics for "Dolphin" in the text, at III.v.64:- Q1 Q2 Q3 F II.iv.29 Dolphin Dolphin Dolphin Dolphin 111 Dolphin Dolphin Dolphin Dolphin 115 Dolphin Dolphin Dolphin Dolphin III.v.64 Dolphin Dolphin Dolphin Dolphin vii.88 om. om. om. Dolphin A's more unorthodox colleague, B, also, who was inclined to the opposite extreme of treating the word as a name and italicising it, departs from this practice at I.ii.221 and 235, to follow Q in using roman type, while in the remaining nine instances in the scene, he returns to his normal italics. So, at IV.vi.11, 15, 24, B follows Q3, as against Q1 and Q2, in printing "Suffolke", used alone as a proper name, in roman; and all the quartos in printing "Monmouth", seven times, and "Macedon", five times, in italics (IV.vii.); and "Lucifer" and "Belzebub" in roman. Spelling The use of - t and ' d (- ed to indicate unvoiced weak past-participial endings was arbitrary between 1590 and 1623, but the tendency to favour ' d was progressive. One would therefore expect and allow for a certain degree of "modernisation" in F as compared with Q. As Dr. Alice Walker pointed out in the case of quartos that were certainly used as copy for F ( op. cit. , pp. 154-5), one would expect the pattern of modernisation to be a random one, if the two texts, Q and F, were entirely independent of each other. When one finds, therefore, that the pattern of F follows that of Q in its irregularity, one can only conclude that Q influenced F. In Henry V , there is an almost complete coincidence of such irregularity in these variants where they appear in both texts. The following complete list shows that Q and F agree in 13 - t endings (14 counting Q3 only), 7 -d, -ed , or ' d endings (9 counting Q3 only), while 5 are modernised (Q -t , F ' -d, -ed ). There are only two exceptions; one of them is Fluellen's (Q digd ; F digt ), and was presumably intended to emphasize his Welsh pronunciation; the other is fac't out , III.vii.80, and, since the words occur at the end of a prose line in F, the form might be due to an attempt to justify the line. Q,F -t accurst alewasht astonisht establisht matcht Q3 pickt rackt steept toucht vnfurnisht vsurpt vanisht washt worshipt Q,F -d, 'd, -ed chac'd disgrac'd enforc'd Q3,F finished fixed forc'd Q3,F practis'd stretched wink'd Q -t F 'd, -ed burnt, burned punisht, punish'd stopt, stop'd steept, (in-)steeped talkt, talk'd Peculiar, and often unique, spellings are also encountered throughout both texts, e.g. I.ii.164, Owse (all other Shakespearean plays ooze ); II.iv.132, Louer (= Louvre ); IV.iii.105, crasing (=grazing); V.i.8 sault (all other plays salt ). Punctuation Here F dependence on Q2 or Q3 may be sufficiently illustrated by the following significant examples:- 1. Q How now sir Iohn , quoth I? II.iii.17 F How now Sir Iohn (quoth I?) what man? The retention of the Q question-mark within the F brackets, if not impossible in Elizabethan punctuation, is at least unusual enough to be taken as a clue. 2. Q,F great grandfather I.ii.146 ( Camb. great-grandfather) 3. Q1,3,F Doll Tear-sheete, she by name, and her espowse II.i.75 ( Camb. omits first comma.) 4. Q3 Now Lords to France: The enterprise whereof II.ii.182 F Now Lords for France: the enterprise whereof 5. Q3 And I: if F and I: If III.ii.13-14 ( Camb. And I:/ If) Compositors' spelling The F text seems to have been distributed as follows between compositors A and B:- 7 A H1 r —h2 r col. a (pp. 69-71a) I Prol.—I.ii.135 B h2 r col. b—h4 r col. a (pp. 71b—75a) I.ii.136—II.ii.179 A h4 r col. b—i4 r (pp. 75b—87) II.ii.180—IV.iv.43 B i4 v —i5 r (pp. 88-89) IV.iv.44—IV.vii.142 A i5 v —i6 r (pp. 90-91) IV.vii.143—V.i.34 B i6 v col. a (p. 92a) V.i.34—V.ii.11 A i6 v col. b—k2 r (pp. 92b—95) V.ii.12—end Both compositors normally alter certain spellings of their copy-text to suit their own preferences. But, especially in the case of a printed text, they occasionally adopt the spelling of that copy. Thus, for example, we find compositor A, in his first stint, departing from his known habits to follow the Q spellings in such words as:- Normal A spelling F Henry V Q Henry V I.ii.96 clayme claim claim 155 bene, beene bin bin Q1,3 (bene Q2) 30 belieue beleeue beleeue 177 thieues theeues theeues Even allowing for the occasional use of shorter spellings ( e. g. bin) which might have been introduced to "justify" a line, there is a marked series of such variations in the work of both compositors —variations characterized by the consistent adoption of the Q spelling. The whole point may be neatly illustrated from their use of speech-prefixes, and in particular that for Gower. I have not seen it noticed that A consistently uses a longer form of prefix than B. Thus B can be identified immediately on the evidence of such forms as War., Suf., Mes., Con. ; while A prefers Warw., Suff., Mess., Const . For Gower, A uses the full name, while B prefers Gow . Each, however, departs from his normal practice once (apart from an exceptional Gour. at V.i.36). All the quartos are inconsistent, and use several forms of the prefix. But in both the F variants, A and B adopt precisely that form which their quarto copy happened to favour at that point, A taking his Gow. from Q2 at IV.1.81, and B his Gower. from Q3 at IV.vii.19, quite contrary to their habitual forms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI A general illustrative passage may draw these points together, at IV.iii.117-132: Q3 They'l be in fresher robes, or they will plucke The gay new cloaths ore your French souldiers eares, And turne them out of seruice. If they do this, As if it please God they shall, Then shall our ransome soone be leuied; Saue thou thy labour Herauld, Come thou no more for ransome, gentle Herauld. They shall haue nought I sweare, but these my bones: Which if they haue, as I will leaue vm them, Will yeeld them little, tell the Constable, . . . King . Take it braue Yorke . Come souldiers let's away, And as thou pleasest God, dispose the day. F They'le be in fresher Robes, or they will pluck The gay new Coats o're the French Souldiers heads, And turne them out of seruice. If they doe this, As if God please, they shall; my Ransome then Will soone be leuyed. Herauld, saue thou thy labour: Come thou no more for Ransome, gentle Herauld, They shall haue none, I sweare, but these my ioynts: Which if they haue, as I will leaue vm them, Shall yeeld them little, tell the Constable. . . . King . Take it, braue Yorke . Now Souldiers march away, And how thou pleasest God, dispose the day. Here may be noted, in particular:- Lineation: the common break at "leuyed" in the middle of the verse line: the printing of "Take it . . . away" as two lines, common to Q3 (but not Q1 or Q2) and F. Punctuation: the colon after "bones/ioynts". Errors: "or", in line 117, was amended by Hanmer, justifiably, to "for"; "or" has been defended, but is not really satisfactory."vm" (Q1,2 "am"); Camb . "'em". Spelling: "Herauld" is unusual in F.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII Since the evidence, then, points clearly to the use of Q as copy or basis for F, is there anything to determine what procedure was followed? Was the copy simply consulted, or was it physically amended, or was it transcribed, or was there a blend of more than one of these methods? The use of two quartos seems to indicate amendment or correction, and the facility of using both recto and verso of a quarto leaf when difficulty was encountered. Marginal (including possibly interlinear) correction there certainly seems to have been. This was on the whole feasible. Many quarto pages could have been collated with an authoritative manuscript and corrected without much trouble, and would provide copy no worse than an ordinary corrected proof; for example, of the first two quarto signatures—14 pages of text—only two, B1 v and B4 v , would be rather crowded after correction. The main difficulty would arise from Q omissions, passages to be inserted in the Q copy. Here it is worth noting that, in general, there was more blank space on the Q page than is usually realized. As the photographs reproduced below will confirm, there was often room for ten or a dozen lines to be inserted, not to mention minor corrections. No doubt some of the smaller insertions would be made on the Q page; the longer or more involved could be written on slips of paper and attached to the page, or included as separate leaves; or they might even be set from the manuscript itself—though this might raise other difficulties. The top half of E1 r (of Q2), given below (plate VI), is an example of the lighter type of correction; the lower half illustrates some of the relatively few more difficult stretches. It is by such a process of correction that many F errors, the existence of which has already been recognized on literary grounds (in, e. g. H. T. Price, The Text of Henry V , 1920), may, and, in some cases, must, have originated. The test is to edit the quarto as the F printers may be presumed to have done, and watch the errors arising in the process. Sample pages are given below. As far as possible, illustrations are drawn from the Q2 copy, since its use, and the evidence for its use, are scarcer (because of its greater conformity with Q1) than for Q3, and Q3 has been amply illustrated above. ( a ) Excessive deletion : II.i.26-27 Q3 Bar. Good morrow ancient Pistoll . heere comes ancient Pistoll , I prethee Nim be quiet. Nim. How do you my host? F Bar. Heere comes Ancient Pistoll and his wife: good Corporall be patient heere. How now mine Hoaste Pistoll ? Price ( op. cit. , pp. 52-3) points out the dramatic necessity of giving the last sentence to Nim, as in Q, in view of Pistol's reply, "Base Tyke, cal'st thou mee Hoste. . . ." The F omission of the prefix " Nim. " is explicable on the assumption that the corrector of the Q copy wrote his corrections, as he might well do here, for want of space, in such a way as to obscure it. That the corrector sometimes drew an arrow or equivalent pointer from a marginal addition to its position in the text of Q, and seemed (to the compositor) to delete in the process the words printed in its path, is suggested by the proximity of some F omissions to passages where an insertion was necessary. For example:- V.i.75-76 Q3 Well France farewell, newes haue I certainly That Doll is sicke. One malady of France F Newes haue I that my Doll is dead i'th Spittle of a malady of France Here the corrector, besides deleting "certainly" and inserting "my" before "Doll", would require to delete "sicke" and substitute for it "dead i'th Spittle". If this were done in the left-hand margin, a pointer drawn to indicate an insertion after "sicke" might well run through, or seem to run through, the phrase "Well France farewell," and account for its omission in F, where it is just what is wanted to fill the gap in the verse. The passage and its correction are illustrated below in Plate II. ( b ) Inadequate deletion : On a theory of marginal correction, it seems clear that the last two words in the F passage given below are to be explained as superfluous, and their presence due to an oversight after the insertion made at the correct point earlier in the line. II.i.39-40 Q Pist. What, dost thou push, thou prickeard cur of Iseland F Pist. Pish for thee, Island dogge: thou prickeard cur of Island. Another probable example of the same kind, where the Q "and" is superfluous in F, and should have been deleted, is II.ii.13-14: Q My Lord of Cambridge , and my Lord-of Massham , And you my gentle Knight, giue me your thoughts, F My Lord of Cambridge , and my kinde Lord of Masham , And you my gentle Knight, giue me your thoughts: Similarly, deletion applied to the wrong one of two identical phrases in two successive lines, and applied, or interpreted, inadequately, seems to be what is needed to explain and smooth out the F tangle:- I.ii.207-8 As many Arrowes loosed seuerall wayes Come to one marke: as many wayes meet in one towne, The trouble seems to have originated with Q:- As many arrowes losed seuerall wayes, fly to one marke: As many seuerall wayes meete in one Towne: The corrector, we may suppose, intended to delete "seuerall wayes" from the first Q line, but instead deleted the same phrase from the second, and in such a manner as to leave "wayes" undeleted, or at least legible, so that it was later recovered for the sense. Allowing for the other minor corrections, the F version should therefore read, more smoothly, and perhaps more sensibly:- As many arrows, loosed, come to one mark; As many several ways meet in one town; ( c ) Errors arising out of transposition : The corrector seems also to have used single or double arrows or a similar device to indicate transfer or transposition, and sometimes in such a way as to leave the process incomplete or liable to be misinterpreted. At two important points, for example, where editors adopt the Q arrangement, or Q lines omitted by F, a method of inadequate transfer seems to furnish the probable explanation of the F error. IV.iii.11-16 Q2 Cla . Farewell kind Lord, fight valiantly to day, And yet in truth I do thee wrong, For thou art made on the true sparkes of honour. F Bedf . Farwell good Salisbury , &amp; good luck go with thee: And yet I doe thee wrong, to mind thee of it, For thou art fram'd of the firme truth of valour. Exe . Farwell kind Lord: fight valiantly to day. Bedf . He is as full of Valour as of Kindnesse, Princely in both. It is agreed that the second and third lines in F ought to follow the fourth as part of Exeter's speech. The error is usually attributed to a marginal insertion of these two lines, and a mistake as to the correct point of insertion. The theory of corrected Q copy for F provides a somewhat similar explanation, and at the same time supplies a reason why the two lines should have been inserted at all. If the missing speeches of Bedford were added to Q where the immediately following stage-direction provides some space, or at the foot of the page, where there is plenty of room, the first of these speeches could then be transposed with that of Cla. (corrected to Exe. ) by pointers connecting the two speech-prefixes. The printer might then erroneously transpose the two lines thus connected, leaving the intervening lines (12-13) as they stood. The process is conjecturally illustrated on Plate VI below. IV.iii.48: The F omission of the Q line And say, these wounds I had on Crispins day. also occurs at a point where a transposition sign might be attached to the line above it , and is thus very similar to the preceding example. Q3 reads:- F line And say, to morrow is S. Crispins day: 46 [12 lines] 51-63 Then shal he strip his sleeues, &amp; shew his scars, 47 And say, these wounds I had on Crispins day. 48 And Gentlemen in England now a bed, 64 ( d ) Erroneous incorporation from marginal corrections : There are two outstanding examples of this:- 1. IV.viii.26ff. [See Plate I] The resulting F version of this passage reads:- Flu . . . . a Villaine . . . ha's strooke the Gloue which your Maiestie is take out of the Helmet of Alanson . Will . My Liege, this was my Gloue, here is the fellow of it: and he that I gaue it to in change, promis'd to weare it in his Cappe: I promis'd to strike him, if he did: I met this man with my Gloue in his Cappe, and I haue been as good as my word. Flu . Your Maiestie heare now, sauing your Maiesties Manhood, what an arrant rascally, beggerly, lowsie Knaue it is: I hope your Maiestie is peare me testimonie and witnesse, and will auouchment, that this is the Gloue of Alanson , that your Maiestie is giue me, in your Conscience now. The intrusion of "will" into the third last F line is curious. Editors have managed to incorporate it, and possibly to make sense of it, but have fought shy of explanations. Yet, on the basis of corrected Q2 as copy for F, the reason for its presence, and its lack of authenticity, may be demonstrated. It will be observed that, owing to a number of natural associations, here and in the immediate context, Q has mistaken the position of the two lines "And your maiestie . . . the gloue." The corrector, to restore the true order, would transfer either the two lines to their proper position below, or the succeeding eight lines (duly corrected) to theirs above. He would also correct the prefix " Soul. " and write in the margin, or above the prefix, the F form " Will. " In either case, it could easily be read as for insertion between "And" and "auouchment" in the line above. And, one passage or the other to which it belonged being due for transfer, what more natural than that it should go with it, besides being inserted, correctly, as the speechprefix for " Soul. "? Since the lineation of the first four Q lines is different in Q3, so as to make this error impossible, it seems certain that here Q2 was used. This is confirmed by the detailed collation of this page (sig. F2 r ) given below. In Q3 the critical passage is arranged, differently:- And testimonies, and auouchments, That this is the gloue. Soul . And it please your maiesty, (2) The other outstanding example of erroneous incorporation in F of marginal correction from Q copy occurs in an extremely corrupt Q passage, V.i.75-83, part of which has already been dealt with, and which exhibits in F all the symptoms of corrected copy—common errors, punctuation, and spelling; and F omissions due to the heavy correction and the difficulty of the copy. Here the word "cudgeld" (line 82) spoils the metre, and is obviously in some way connected with the same word three lines earlier. Editors, with the exception of Pope, have apparently been tied to the authority of F, and allowed the word to stand. A comparison of the Q version, however, and a consideration of the marginal corrections necessary to transform it into the F version, suggest a simple explanation—the word has been duly inserted in its proper place, but also caught up again from the end of the insertion, which would stretch down the right-hand margin so as to place the word opposite or above the end of line 82, thus:- [See Plate II] It is to be remarked, further, that:- (i) F is mainly in prose, while Q is, correctly, in verse. The prose of F may be set down to the heavy and confusing correction. Only the last two lines show that the rhymes at least have helped to indicate the necessity of verse. (ii) In the confusion, a line (The warres . . .) and a half-line (Well . . . farewell,), both of which seem authentic, and one of which completes an otherwise defective line, have been omitted. (iii) "Cudgeld" has been, erroneously, caught into line 82. (iv) The Q error "Doll" for "Nell" has been left uncorrected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VIII Passages not represented in Q must of course have been either printed direct from manuscript, or from a transcript, probably on a slip or sheet of paper that could be inserted or pasted into the copy. That some transcription was done is rendered likely by the evidence of mislineation in such passages; though of course mislineation, of itself, proves little, and could arise from many other causes. In particular, IV.i.226-245, a piece of blank verse throughout, is mislined by F in one way, and by editors in another. The corrector seems also to have used transcription, on at least one occasion, to resolve confusion in the corrected copy. He ran into trouble for the first time at the foot of B1 r , where, as on the verso, heavy correction was necessary, as well as the transposition of various lines from verso to recto. Transcription is suggested by the manuscript-type error "name" (II.i.23) for the correct Q reading "mare". However that may be, the evidence points to this limitation on transcription, namely, that F peculiarities previously detailed cannot be so explained where the text is common to F and Q, nor would transcription seem to require the use of two quartos.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IX The most intriguing question is the reason for the use of two quartos as copy. Once again, the way to the probable solution is to follow the procedure that the corrector may be assumed to have adopted, and at the same time to identify, as near as can be done in the circumstances, the particular quarto used at each point. From a treatment of the text in this way, it emerges that Q3 was the main copy, and in particular for gatherings A and B, where, with the exceptions noted above, it presents no difficulty. Elsewhere, beginning from signature C, the use of Q2 occurs at intervals. Its use seems to coincide with difficulty of corrections, i.e. heavy correction on at least one side of the Q leaf, where both sides are usable. This means that, in such cases, Q3 was used, as corrected, for e.g. the recto, while Q2 was similarly used for the verso. The obvious advantage of this procedure was, of course, that it dispensed with the need for transcription of a passage as a whole, while allowing either side to be cut up, re-arranged, and supplemented by the necessary material and corrections from the manuscript. And, as we should expect on such a hypothesis, the use of the Q copy was determined in general by the Q page. This is confirmed by the fact that it has no consistent relation to the F page or column, or to the stints undertaken by the F compositors, or to act and scene divisions. The Q page is normally that of Q3, though occasionally that of Q2 is allowed to determine the limit of use. All this is well illustrated by the first appearance of Q2 as copy—on C1 r . The division is sharply marked, with two clear variants—Q3,F "hell" (Q1,2 "hell fire") in the last line, II.iii.42, of B4 v ; and Q2,F "world" instead of the correct Q1,3 "word" in "The word is pitch and pay:" in the seventh line of C1 r . Actual correction of Q to bring it into conformity with F shows that the corrector here found himself in difficulty owing to the combined need for transposition, correction, and addition. The initial result would be so complicated as to give a compositor some trouble, thus—and this is the result of various trials:- [See Plate III] The corrector seems to have decided, of necessity, to make a better copy. Rather than rewrite the passage, he sought another exemplar, which happened to be one of Q2. Here he discovered—if he was not already aware— that this passage occupied the lower half of B4 v , which he was naturally free to cut up and re-arrange so as at the same time to allow for the insertion of any omitted matter. The process turned out to be extremely simple and economical, and provided much better copy, something like this:- [See Plate IV] Continuing with the correction of C1, the corrector immediately came to a corrupt passage of five lines, for which he had to substitute twenty, II.iv.1-20. This was followed by six gaps, in rapid succession, including one of 13 and one of 15 lines. He therefore continued with the scissors-and-paste method, using the still intact recto of C1 in Q2, and thus preserving for further use the verso, C1 v , of Q3, thus:- [See Plate V] The collation suggests that he continued the use of Q2 until he came to the stage-direction at the foot, and for that, and the one line of text after it, II.iv.75, returned to Q3, where only a part of the verso was now required. The collation is:- Q1 Q2 Q3 F Q2 II.iv.21 foorth forth foorth forth 22 France : France : France France: 25 busied busied troubled busied 26 kingd Kingd kingd King'd 27 fantastically phantastically fantastically phantastically 65 Embassador Embassador Ambassador Embassador Q3 75 brother brother brother of brother of One must, of course, make allowances for accidentals, compositors' habits, etc.; but the trend in favour of Q2, and the absence of any clear case of dependence on Q3, are evident enough. Q3 proved adequate for the next two pages. The Chorus of Act III intervened approximately between the recto and verso of C2, which would allow, possibly, of the verso being cut up for the interposition of several long omissions; though separate slips could also have been used. In the case of C3, the verso, containing the French of III.iv., was almost certainly unusable, and the corrector was thus free to do as he wished with the recto. On similar lines, Q3 seems to have sufficed for D1 to D3 inclusive, though D3 r may either not have been used at all, or may have been cut up on account of heavy transposition, and Q2 used for the lightly corrected verso. The evidence is too slight for a firm decision. The next instance where Q was difficult on both sides but not unusable on either, is D4. At this point, the Q2 page begins and ends the previous signature one line earlier than Q3, i. e. D4 r of Q3 begins at IV.i.62, while D3 v of Q2 begins at IV.i.61. This correspondence must have favoured alternate use of the quartos. Collation suggests that the recto was set up from Q2, i. e. D3 v : IV.i.61-103:- Q1 Q2 Q3 F IV.i.65 lewer lewer lower fewer 67 ancient auncient ancient aunchient 71 bable bable babble bable 81 Gour. Gow. Gower. Gow. Although a case can be made out on general grounds for "fewer", as by Greg ( Pr. Em. , pp. 18-19), the Q3 "lower", which is supported by "I will speak lower" at line 81, is almost certainly correct, and, on a theory of Q copy for F, it is clear that "fewer" has not the independent authority it was supposed to have, and is, in fact, nothing but a conjectural emendation, by the F corrector or compositor, of the Q2 "lewer". Besides heavy correction, both sides of the leaf (as in Q3) have substantial gaps, amounting to some 65 lines, the recto some transposition, e. g. lines 113-114 with 101-103, and five lines that are, rightly or wrongly, omitted altogether in F. Here again, use of one quarto for each side of the leaf would give the advantage of the scissors-and-paste method. On the next page, E1 r , the corrector continued with Q3 (IV.i.186-289). He encountered heavy correction, five small gaps, and a little transposition. Near the end, 60 lines had to be inserted, and 20 of these appear in F mislined (226-245), suggesting that they were copied on to a slip, not too intelligently. On the verso, correction is particularly heavy on the second half of the page, and a whole scene of 64 lines, IV.ii., had to be restored in the middle. Again, recourse seems to have been had to Q2 (E1 r ; E1 v in Q3). Such variants as do occur point to Q2 here:- IV.iii.4 Exe. Q1,2,F Ex. Q3 4 all are Q1,2,F are all Q3 12 Lord Q1,2,F Lords Q3 16SD. the King Q2,F King Q1,3 Exactly the same procedure was applied to the next signature, E2—Q3 being used for the recto and Q2 for the verso. The use of Q2 was here due, not so much to the state of the verso, which is good, as to the very heavy correction and transposition necessary on the recto (IV.iii.33-72). The verso (IV.iii.73-116) shows the following indications of Q2 copy:- IV.iii.90 backe Q1,3 back: Q2,F 100 famed, Q1,3 famed: Q2,F 113 flye:Q1 flye, Q3 flie: Q2,F The only significant Q2 exception "within are trim" at line 115, for "are in the trim" (Q1,3,F), must have been restored by the corrector. The remainder of E presented no difficulty; E3 v , another French scene, was probably useless; and the other pages could be corrected easily from Q3. Both sides of F1 are fairly heavily corrected, and Q2 may have been used for the recto, though it is hard to be quite certain. Q2 next appears on signature F2 (IV.vii.114-161; IV.vii.161—IV.viii.35). Q3 was used for the recto, which still coincides, to within a line, with the previous Q2 verso. The evidence of the speech-prefixes (section IV above), and readings like "from's" Q3; "from his" F ("off from his" Q1,2) confirm. The recto has all the familiar features—heavy correction, gaps, and transposition—that accompany the introduction of Q2. It is not surprising, therefore, that the collation of the verso, itself containing a number of gaps, and requiring (in Q2, where the corresponding side, the recto, takes in 12 more lines) some transposition, shows evidence of the use of Q2, as follows:- IV.viii.1 SD. Captaine Gower Q3 Gower Q1,2,F 3 towards Q1,3 toward Q2,F 18/23 now? Whats Q1,3 now whats Q2,F 26 in person Q3 om. Q1,2,F 30 in's Q3 in his Q1,2,F The incorporation of the speech-prefix " Will. " from the margin into the text, from Q2, has already been mentioned and illustrated (Plate I). Here we have again the tendency to complete the page of whichever quarto was in use. The corrector continued to the end of the Q2 recto, which carried him well over into the Q3 recto of F3. The resumption of Q3 at that point is clear from e. g. the reading "but" ( om. Q1,2) at IV.viii.50. The last evidence of Q2 copy occurs on the second half of F4 r , and may be confined to that half. The top half of both recto and verso needs only light amendment, the lower half of both a great deal. The Q3 page may therefore have been cut across, so that the verso could be cut-and-pasted (from Q3; "in the meane time" Q3,F;"meane time"Q1,2, at V.i.31); the lower half of the recto being done on Q2, where it formed the top of F3 v ; or the whole of the recto could have been corrected on the Q2 copy (IV.viii.106—V.i.13) so that the Chorus to Act V could be inserted between the end of F3 r and the beginning of F3 v . The return to Q3 was made, as we have seen happen before (sig. C1), on the stage-direction " Enter Pistol. " required before the last line of the page (F4 r ) of Q3. The outstanding evidence here of Q2 is the spelling "sault" at V.i.8 in Q2 and F, a spelling not found elsewhere in F or the quartos; and this is corroborated by:- IV.viii.109 other. Q1,2 other, F (an other ? Q3 109 God Q1,2,F O God Q3 112 proclaimed Q1,2,F proclaim'd Q3 The resumption of Q3 at line 14 is suggested by the variant: Here a Q1,2 Heere he Q3,F G1 r bears the last obvious traces of F use of Q copy, but, as a single side or page, presents no problem. The discontinuance of Q copy must have been due to the difficulty it presented from this point to the end of the play; it would not have proved worth while to try to use it. To sum up: A system such as that outlined above may, in the description, seem rather complicated, and more trouble than it could have been worth. But, with the two quartos in hand, it works out in fact very easily, and is eminently feasible. Enough Q pages could be corrected with a minimum of labour to make the process economical. Enough leaves could be used on both sides, or proved to be usable on one side, to permit one corrected quarto (Q3) to serve as the main copy. Leaves of which both sides were subject to heavy correction, but still usable either as they stood or after scissors-and-paste treatment, called into play the supplementary Q2, one side of the leaf being used from each of the quartos. This probably happened with the following Q3 pages, where the coincidence of heavy two-side correction with the introduction of Q2 suggests a causal connection:-C1 r , D3 v (?), D4 r , E1 v , E2 v , F1 r (?), F2 v , F4 r (pages as in Q3). Occasionally, for a short passage, where correction created confusion, a transcript may have been made, as in B1 r . The main gaps in Q were probably sometimes supplied by transcription, as is suggested by verse mislineation; elsewhere, of course, they could have been set up direct from the manuscript. As a means of providing copy for two compositors with a known preference for printed copy, this method has its obvious advantages. We do not know exactly how Jaggard's compositors worked on the copy; but in Henry V it is possible to see how both could have been provided, on this loose-leaf system, with copy so that neither need have interfered with the progress of the other. And it may have been a further incentive, though again we can only conjecture, that by this method the manuscript could have been preserved and returned to the Company intact.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">X The general conclusion seems justified that F was set up from corrected Q copy within certain limits. Further, both Q2 and Q3 were used—there is no sign of exclusive dependence on Q1—Q3 serving as the main copy, and Q2 being drawn on wherever that gave the advantage of using independently a separate side of a Q leaf. Since the use of the quartos as copy coincides with the Q pages, but with no other known factor in relation to the copy, this may be taken as a printing-house device to ease the task of correction and speed the delivery of the copy, if necessary, to the compositors. It would also serve, alternatively, for speed in making a complete duplicate of the play for later use, if the manuscript were urgently required or demanded by the players, or if there was likely to be a long delay in setting up. It is difficult, if not impossible, to imagine any other explanation of the facts here presented. One cannot imagine such a copy originating, for example, in the theatre. It certainly would have been impossible as promptcopy; nor is it likely that, even if Heminge and Condell set themselves, or their scribe, to make a transcript, it would have been done in this way, or on two exemplars. The use of Q is much too widespread to admit of a "patching" theory, such as has been offered for Richard III ; a manuscript that required patching to that extent would obviously have been so dealt with long before, and one hesitates to think what it would look like after the "patching." Again, if there was to be transcription, it is difficult to see the point of the intermediate use of the quartos; it would have been better to do the transcript direct from the manuscript. In short, except as a printer's device, there seems to be no accounting for all the phenomena of the F text.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XI Apart from possible repercussions on the general theory of Shakespearean texts, which are beyond the scope of this article, it is clear that the approach to the text of Henry V will have to be revolutionized. All existing texts, to my knowledge, are based on the assumption that F is independent of Q, and that therefore, as Greg puts it ( Pr. Em. , p. 16), "Where the texts differ, one possesses vastly greater authority than the other: where they agree, we not only have direct transcriptional witness to what the author wrote, but we know . . . that this was actually spoken on the stage." If the theory of Q copy, however, is correct, the opposite will in fact be largely true: where the texts differ, we may infer that, apart from F compositorial intervention, the corrector has been at work, and that F is likely to be correct; where they agree, it may well be an agreement in error owing to the failure of the corrector to correct. This means that an editor's task will include the detection of latent errors, the still more difficult task of deciding between a F correction and a F error, and in general, the reconstruction of the process of correction for the light it can throw on the text of F. He will have the certainty that in many cases the authentic text is lost beyond recovery; but at least he will be able to remove a great many blemishes that have been obvious enough, but remain secure on the supposed independent authority of the Folio. The task, however, has yet to begin.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Some Editorial Principles (with special reference to Henry V ) by Alice Walker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In what follows my object is to demonstrate how compositor analysis contributes towards the solution of editorial problems in Shakespeare. I use the Folio text of Henry V for illustration, partly because it is rightly held to be one of the most reliable Folio texts and partly because it was the work of the two Jaggard compositors, A and B, whose habits are of considerable importance to editors. I do not propose to suggest which readings require emendation, except by way of illustration, or even to consider the general problem of the transmission of this text, which is the subject of another article in this volume: my aim is merely to show how answers to a few important questions may be found. It would be agreed, I think, that the most crucial question today is the amount and kind of corruption we may expect to find in good substantive texts. Clearly one cannot generalise, as it varies from play to play and depends on two things: (1) the character of the copy, and (2) the kind of care taken in its printing. Compositors' errors thus represent only a fraction of the evidence an editor needs to take into account in formulating the principles on which he must work, but I shall concern myself with the habits of compositors because emphasis on the printing of Shakespeare's texts is urgently needed in order to correct some of the false premises of present-day editing, often resting on past fallacies rather than present realities. Earlier in the present century when the first gigantic strides were made towards recognition of the kind of copy from which early good quarto and Folio texts were printed, the immediate reaction was one of confidence. It seemed as if, given reasonable care over proof-correction (and this was assumed), there could not be much wrong with good substantive texts which familiarity with the secretary hand might not put right, since even casual proof-reading with copy would have provided a safeguard against omissions and interpolations, anticipations and recollections detrimental to sense and 'absolute numbers.' The assumption that proof was read with reasonable care was the keystone of conservative editorial theory, but it has recently been badly shaken by what Hinman 1 has so far published about Jaggard's proof-reading of the Folio. If Jaggard's preoccupation, throughout the Folio, was with typographical blemishes and not with fidelity to copy, then the character of the compositors who set the type is as important as the character of the copy itself. In recent years, recognition of the need to know all that can be discovered about compositors, press-work, and proof-reading has, in fact, undermined in some ways the textual theory of the pre-war years. In the last resort, an editor must be prepared to take responsibility for the readings of his text: for seeing that the emendations he makes are consistent with the kind of transmission he postulates and for seeing too that he does not flightily emend one kind of error in one place and then jib at emending its like in another. There may be cruxes which defy emendation and there will certainly be doubtful readings where it is difficult to know what to do for the best. But there is, in every text, a nucleus of readings which are certainly wrong and it is from these that an editor must develop the principles on which he emends other readings. Disregarding errors in foreign names and foreign words, requiring an apprehension of the matter which Jaggard's compositors plainly did not possess, there are just over 50 such readings in the dialogue of Henry V emended by the Old Cambridge and recent English editors (Dover Wilson, Alexander, Walter, and Sisson). When these are referred to the stints of the two compositors who set this play, it is clear what types of error an editor should be on the watch for and where the greater number of one type of error or another is likely to be. Spelling evidence shows that Compositor A set pp. 69-71a, 75b-87, 90-91, 92b-95 (I.i.-I.ii.135, II.ii.180-IV.iv.43, IV.vii.143-V.i.34, V.ii.12 ff.); Compositor B set up pp. 71b-75a, 88-89, 92a (I.ii.136-II.ii.179, IV.iv.44-IV.vii.142, V.i.34-V.ii.11). 2 The unanimously rejected readings are as follows: Compositor A's stints p.71 I.ii.131 (1) Bloods for blood F3 75b II.iii.16 (2) Table babbled Theobald II.iii.49 (3) world word Q1,3, Rowe 77 III.Ch.4 (4) Douer Hampton Theobald III.Ch.6 (5) fayning fanning Rowe III.i.7 (6) commune summon Rowe; conjure Walter III.i.17 (7) Noblish noblest F2 III.i.24 (8) me men F4 III.i.32 (9) straying straining Rowe 79 III.iii.32 (10) headly heady F2 III.iii.35 (11) Desire Defile Rowe 80 III.v.46 (12) Kings knights Theobald conj., Pope ii 81 III.vi.107 (13) Leuitie lenity Qq, Rowe III.vii.12 (14) postures pasterns F2 83 IV.Ch.16 (15) nam'd name Tyrwhitt conj., Steevens 84 IV.i.94 (16) Iohn Thomas Theobald conj., Pope ii 85 IV.i.241 (17) Odoration adoration F2 IV.i.271 (18) Hiperio Hyperion F2 IV.i.287 (19) reckning of reckoning if tyrwhitt conj., Steevens; . . . or anon conj., D.W.

Repetitions: 17 Anticipations: 12, 19 Inexplicable: 18 6 It is evident that in A's stints there are certainly 7 instances of misreading (nos. 2, 5, 11, 14, 15, 27, 29 7 ). Among the readings I have queried as possibly due to other causes, no. 1 might have occurred through assimilation to 'sword' ('blood and sword'); no. 6 presents a problem but, as I have no doubt that Walter's 'conjure' 8 will have wide appeal, it should, I judge, be numbered at least provisionally among misreadings, bringing the total to 8; nos. 8, 9, 18, 20, may have been due to the accidental omission of a letter (especially in view of the graver omissions, nos. 22, 24, 28); no. 13 may be a turned 'n'; no. 17 might have occurred through assimilation to the following 'o' (cf. no. 7), and no. 23 ('Co me , goe me ' for 'Come, goe we') certainly looks like an error of this kind. The number of misreadings in A's stints therefore lies between (say) 8 and 16. The only certain misreading in B's stints is no. 4, though no. 1 may be an error of this kind; no. 2 might have been a misreading (assuming the line began with a minuscule), but it looks more like a typical error of anticipation ('End in one purpose, and . . .'), like nos. 12, 19; and it would seem unrealistic to regard nos. 20-23 as anything but typical perversions, such as abound in B's work in 1 Henry IV , in the absence of any certain misreading in B's stints except (perhaps) no. 1 and (certainly) no. 4. The number of misreadings in B's stints thus lies between (say) 2 and 7. This means that between 10 and 23 out of 52 certain errors were misreadings—less than half, even if we unrealistically accept the higher figure. These two lists of indubitable errors need to be related to the conclusions reached by Mr. Cairncross elsewhere in this volume, and it is not my purpose to discuss them in detail or in relation to the question of copy except to remark that Compositor A had the lion's share of the setting from manuscript and B from corrected quarto 9 . The point I want to make is the general one that a start from the indubitable errors, analysed on a compositor basis, makes it easier to judge which of the many emendations that have been made, or suggested, is warranted on the evidence; and, as one of the main tasks of an editor today is that of separating the grain from the chaff in three centuries of critical opinion, it is important to have some systematic means of winnowing. I am not suggesting that a survey such as I have made need be applied rigidly. There may be types of error frequently made by a given compositor which are not clearly exemplified in the manifest errors of every text; further, my survey gives only an inkling (A, no. 3) of the certainty of contamination from Q2 and Q3 opened up by Mr. Cairncross's conclusions. But in spite of inevitable limitations, these lists provide four useful pieces of information: (1) that the ductus literarum as the solution to textual difficulties represents half measures at the best even when the copy was difficult manuscript 10 ; (2) that misreading may be more appropriately invoked in explanation of errors in A's stints than in B's; (3) that errors in B's stints may be twice as numerous as in A's; and (4) that B's errors may include a very high proportion due to the kind of carelessness exemplified in his stints in I Henry IV . 10a This nucleus of certain errors touches, of course, only such corruptions as would seem obvious to anyone attentively following the matter. This is clear from the fact that (as the lists reveal) most of the errors of this kind in Henry V had been corrected by the mid-eighteenth century. But, starting from this nucleus, it is easier for an editor to test past opinion as well as his own. Thus, at II.iv.107, the emendation of 'priuy' to 'pining' is warranted on the evidence of difficulty with minims 11 ; the evidence of no. 19 warrants the assumption that 'by' at V.Ch.29 was A's interpolation due to repetition; and the evidence of no. 23 suggests that 'for' for 'or' at IV.iv.14 (clearly wanted, since Pistol's threat is 'death or ransom') was an error of assimilation to the preceding 'fortie'. Compositor B's 'Maiesties surueyes' (I.ii.197) is on a par with no. 9 (the addition of a final 's' was, in any case, one of B's most pernicious habits 12 ) and 'come' for 'came' at II.i.114 looks like a characteristic error of anticipation. These are among the doubtful readings which some, but not all, of the five editions emend. There are 36 such readings in all: 22 of them in A's stints (6 or 7 attributable to misreading), 14 in B's (of which only 1 is explicable as a misreading) and most of the emendations are in accordance with what the indubitable errors suggest about likely types of error in their stints. There might have been greater uniformity of opinion over these doubtful readings (which are by no means all that are questionable) had the ductus literarum not proved a stumbling block. A further point worth remark concerning the indubitable errors in this text is that on at least a dozen occasions the Quarto preserved the truth where the better text failed. Most (though not all) of the Folio errors which can be set right by reference to the Quarto are trivial and could have been corrected with certainty in the absence of a collateral text. All the same, it is not reasonable to suppose that chance will have operated so that a good text and a bad will have corrupted the same readings, and because Pope was too partial to the Quarto is no reason for flying to the other extreme by trying to avoid its aid. There is no reason for rejecting two Quarto readings, followed by the (Old) Cambridge editors at IV.vi.15—' And cries aloud "Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk"'. The Folio's substitution of 'He' and 'my' for the italicised words is entirely characteristic of Compositor B, making first an error of repetition and then one of anticipation. So too is the substitution of 'black and white' (II.ii.104) for 'black from white', the Quarto reading and a better complement to 'stands off'. The Folio reading is again Compositor B's, who presumably anticipated 'and' at the beginning of the following line ('Treason and murder'). Fear of bad texts is only justified if we can be quite certain that there were no errors in either the copy or the printing of the more authoritative text. Provided that an editor can explain how the corruption came about (and B's certain errors justify our assuming similar errors in the above two readings) it would be dangerous, in view of the superficial character of Jaggard's proof correction, not to accept the better readings. In an article in the last volume of Studies in Bibliography 12a I argued the need for eclecticism in the editing of collateral substantive texts with the reservation that eclectic editing today was something very different from that of the eighteenth century. Under the impression that there was grave corruption of readings both in the printer's copy and in its printing, far greater freedom of choice was then exercised than would now be warranted, but this does not mean that there must be no choice at all. Thus, Capell's rejection of the Folio's 'tomb' for the Quarto's 'grave' at I.ii.103 would now seem inadmissible on two counts: first, because it presupposes a memorial error of the kind we can postulate in the Quarto copy but not in the copy for the Folio; and secondly, because the reading was Compositor A's, whose errors in this text give no warrant for assuming he was prone to inexplicable verbal substitutions of this kind. On the other hand, at III.iii.47, where the Folio reads To rayse so great a Siege: Therefore great King, there is much to be said for Capell's substitution of the Quarto's 'dread' 13 for the second 'great', since there is grave suspicion that Compositor A made a similar error at IV.i.287 (no. 19). The emendation of the Folio is here the more admissible because the Governor's speech seems very well reported in the Quarto. Consequently, Capell's emendation of the Folio's 'Succours' to 'succour' (Q) two lines earlier also merits serious consideration. So too does Capell's 'contaminate' (Q 'contamuracke', one of its oddest misreadings) at IV.v.16 for B's 'contaminated'. 14 The tendency is now to draw on the Quarto only when the Folio is manifestly in error. But we cannot suppose that all compositors' errors resulted in an obvious breakdown in the sense, and although we know that something is missing at IV.v.11 (B, no. 16), the Quarto's 'dread' at III.iii.47 is, in fact, a reading in which greater confidence can be placed than its 'honour' as a stop-gap at IV.v.11, since the Quarto seriously garbled the dialogue of the latter scene. 15 Where there are errors of repetition and anticipation in plays for which we have a single substantive text, there is often nothing to be done about them. Editors have beaten their brains in vain over 'Cleanse the stufft bosome, of that perillous stuffe' ( Macbeth , V.iii.44)—a B crux to which a collateral text might have provided a satisfactory solution. Where we have a collateral text, even a bad one, we are indeed fortunate, and a number of Quarto readings in Henry V merit more consideration than they have recently had. The quandary in which the variant readings at IV.vi.15 ('And cries . . . Suffolk') place an editor was pursued to its logical conclusion by Greg ( Principles of Emendation , p. 47): It is, indeed, difficult to suppose that the undoubted improvement [the Q reading] is due to corruption: at the same time it is difficult to suppose that F can be merely misprinted. Revision would offer a solution. This, however, affords very slender support for a rather revolutionary theory. I mention this here, not because I think it probable, but in order to draw attention to its textual implications. If the performance on which Q is based was of a version revised from that transmitted by F, editors would be placed in a truly unenviable position. They would namely be presented with the alternatives of either reproducing the unrevised version of F, only removing as best they might obvious errors of the scribe or compositor, or else of endeavouring, by an almost pure process of intuition, to recover such fragments of the author's second thoughts as may lie embedded in the corruption of Q, and weaving them into the texture of the earlier version. There is an all too common type of editor who would revel in such a problem as this, but one who took his task seriously might well be pardoned for giving it up in despair. Nor would it only be the choice of readings that would be affected: we should have in every instance to inquire whether an absurdity of Q could not be emended into something that might pass muster as a revision of F's reading. It is to be hoped that we are spared this nightmare. The logic of this is applicable to every case where an inferior text has a reading which is manifestly superior to its counterpart in a better text, but the dilemma can probably be resolved in most cases by an examination of what the compositor's errors reveal, since confidence in Jaggard's proof correction is not now so strong as it was in 1928. B's unfortunate habit of attempting to memorise more than he could reproduce accurately, resulting in errors of recollection and anticipation, certainly seems to leave an editor freedom of choice at IV.vi.15. The only escape from the 'rather revolutionary' theory above (involving an editor in a choice between Shakespeare's first and second thoughts) is, in fact, a counter-revolution towards eclectic editing (involving a choice between truth and falsehood in collateral texts) or the abandonment of literary values—and what serious risks editors would be taking if they accepted all but the most blatant errors of the more authoritative text is evident from Compositor B's performance in 1 Henry IV . Because the copy for a particular text was more authoritative than that for a collateral it does not follow that it was proof against carelessness in its printing. The above lists also show how frequently one of the later Folios corrected a Folio error. Such corrections have, of course, no authority and there is no reason why an editor should not reject F2's 'noblest' (A, no. 7) in favour of Malone's 'noble' if he thinks the latter the more Shakespearian reading—just as he is at liberty to reject Malone's 'and their' for Pope's 'while their' at IV.vii.75 (B, no. 19) if he thinks that B's garbling involved more than a single word. The corrections of the later Folios, like the conjectural emendations of later editors, must stand on their merits—and this holds for F2's emendations for the sake of metre, now often slightingly dismissed as 'metrical tinkering.' But accidental omissions that sometimes made a breach in the sense are just as likely, at other times, to have potholed the even road of a blank verse, and there is no reason why the one kind of error should be emended and not the other. 16 If a line is halting and there is an obvious remedy, even though it was conjecturally made by F2, why should an editor reject it? The very fact that F2 took an interest in this kind of error is surely evidence that metre mattered in the early seventeenth century; and if printing-house editors or compositors interested themselves in 'numbers,' they presumably recognised their importance and knew how often omission and interpolation had made them less 'absolute' than they should have been. Mostly, there is no hope of recovering a missing word or phrase, but metrical emendations are entitled to the same kind of consideration as any other kind of emendation made in derivative texts. F2's emendation of 'against' to ''gainst' at IV.ii.25, though lacking the finesse of Dyce's 'Ay, ay' for 'I' at IV.i.302, should not be rejected because it seems so simple and because F2's emendations for metre were sometimes senseless stop-gaps. What is undoubtedly needed is a conspectus of the certain errors in all good substantive texts. No one who edits Antony and Cleopatra , for instance, can afford to neglect the evidence for the number and kind of errors made by Compositor B in Othello ; nor can the editor of King Lear safely disregard the evidence of Hamlet on the one hand and of Othello on the other, though it would be rash to infer that the rot that set in during the printing of the Tragedies was noticeably present in the Histories. Ultimately, any assessment of the trustworthiness of Folio texts will need to be related to what Hinman's collation of the Folger First Folios reveals about proof-reading, the order of formes through the press, and the order of their setting. In the meantime, an editor's only resource is to consider one Folio text in relation to another, set by the same compositor (or compositors) about the same time, as a check on his findings. I mentioned above that it might happen that a type of error commonly found in a compositor's work might not be exemplified in the unanimously rejected readings of a single text. Thus, for instance, there is no case of word transposition in my lists above; but the lists exclude errors in foreign words, and a transposition does, in fact, occur in A's 'bien parlas' (Q 'parte fort bon') at III.iv.1, which editors unanimously correct to 'parles bien'. Further, most editors rightly transpose B's 'defie thee' to 'thee defy' at II.i.70 (following Q). Apart from the merits of the latter reading, it is useful to remember that there are 6 transpositions in B's stints of Richard II , and as quire c of this play (according to Willoughby) immediately preceded Henry V in order of printing, the Folio variants can profitably be considered in relation to the errors and suspect readings of Henry V . The Folio text of Richard II merits, incidentally, more attention than it has recently had. It was printed from an example of Q3 which had to some extent been brought into line with a prompt book 17 . The Folio omissions are generally explained as 'cuts' in accordance with the acting version (as in the Folio Hamlet and Lear ) and the very thorough overhaul of Q3's stage directions certainly suggests reference to prompt copy. The Folio text also exemplifies some mechanical changes in speech prefixes (e.g. the substitution of ' Ser. ' for ' Man. ') and a few of the variants introduced for the worse suggest a collator's misreadings ('soules' for 'smiles', 'placed' for 'plated', 'Rainston' for 'Ramston', 'Beares' for 'beards'). We have, there fore, in this Folio text some evidence for the kind of alteration a collator might make in preparing Folio copy. The text is also interesting, like 1 Henry IV , as a sustained example of the more stylish kind of Folio reprint 18 , shedding light, in particular, on the way in which Compositors A and B altered speech prefixes 19 and on their use of italics. To consider the Folio Richard II as a whole would take me too far from my purpose here, since the situation is complicated by edited copy and requires full discussion of a number of variants. I shall therefore use two characteristic pages from quire c, pp. 31-32, set by B and A respectively, as a sidelight on Henry V . The Folio divergencies from Q3 make it evident that we must postulate (1) alterations in the example of Q3 prior to composition, and (2) errors introduced by the compositors. Since the following features are common to the stints of A and B, it is reasonable to assume they stood in their copy: act and scene divisions; a thorough revision of stage directions; the substitution of ' Rich. ' for ' King. ' as speech prefix (though this was not made on the first leaf printed, according to Willoughby, two years earlier); some cutting; the occasional restoration of a Q1 reading corrupted in Q2-3; some alterations of Q1-3 readings; some expurgating of oaths; and a number of necessary metrical improvements with also some conjectural bodging, presumably editorial. 20 B set p. 31 (II.ii.32-II.iii.6). Readings for which he was probably responsible are: II.ii. 51 Rauenspurg for Rauenspurgh 52 ?O Ah 72 hopes linger Hope lingers 77 Line omitted 89 Herfords 21 Herefords 99 Come Comes 103 om. two 108 om. go 122 ?Exit Exeunt Duke, &amp; Queene, manent Bush. &amp; Greene 134 ?haue beene euer euer haue beene 148 S.N. Bush .(misplaced) 149 S.N. Bush . II.iii.S.D. ?Enter the Duke of Hereford, and Northumberland Enter Hereford: Northumberland 6 our your I have queried readings which might have been due to copy. I assume that the three additional entries for Green, York, and the Servant (after II.ii.40, 72, 85) and the Exit at the end of the scene were in his copy, though I am more doubtful as to where responsibility lay for the alteration in the stage direction at II.ii.122 22 and in the heading to II.iii. I credit the copy also with the addition of 'Castle' at II.ii.119, the correction of 'for' to 'to' at II.ii.123 23 and the restoration of Q1's 'here' ( om. Q2-3) at II.iii.3. It is plainly not easy to draw a firm line between editorial alterations in B's copy and his errors. The situation is clearer in A's work where, if we similarly put down to copy three additional stage directions, one correction of a Q1-3 reading and four of corruptions introduced in Q2-3, we have four variants which look like compositor's errors: II.iii.29 we last for last we 35 direction directions 87 om. no uncle 90 these those Two variants remain unaccounted for: A's 'kinsman' for 'Coosin' (Q1-3) at II.iii.125, almost certainly a correction from the prompt book, 24 and ' H. Percie ' (II.iii.20 S.D.) for Q3's ' Harry Persie ', which may similarly have been the collator's alteration, since Compositor A was not given to scamping his task. This picture of the greater care of Compositor A is in accordance with the evidence of Richard II as a whole and suggests that we may be right in finding twice as many errors in B's work as in A's in Henry V . A single page of a compositor's work will not necessarily reveal all its facets. Thus, on p. 31, B lost one of Q3's two parentheses and added only one, whereas A on p. 32 added two; and it was B who indubitably put the metre wrong (II.ii.92-94), whereas A generally showed the less sensitive ear. Nor does p. 31 exemplify B's habit of ravelling the wording, through recollection, anticipation or inexplicable substitutions (like 'just' for 'right', rhyming with 'fight', at I.iii.55). But the range and distribution of Folio variants (mostly errors) can easily be seen from an analysis, on a compositor basis, of Pollard's list on pp. 77-79 of his edition of Q3. Some of the items he included might have been disregarded, while on the other hand some additions need to be made to his record (which omits, for instance, the B errors at II.ii.103, 108, 134 mentioned above); but since his account of Folio errors can easily be referred to, I summarise on the basis of that. The stints of the two compositors were as follows: B pp. 23-31, 38, 42-5 (I.i.-II.iii.6, III.iv.54-IV.i.71, V.ii.7 ff.) A pp. 32-7, 39-41 (II.iii.7-III.iv.53, IV.i.72-V.ii.6) An analysis on a compositor basis gives the following results: A B Letters omitted 3 9 Letters added 2 8 Letters substituted 1 4 Words omitted 3 2 Words transposed 2 5 Words substituted 18 43 -- -- 29 71 Pages set 9 14 The most interesting category of variants is Pollard's last, which includes almost certainly a few corrections of Q1 errors, prompt book changes (such as are evident in some Q1 and Folio agreements in Hamlet ), collator's misreadings, editorial bodges, and a very generous contribution of compositors' errors, mainly from B. There are, for instance, in B's stints 12 cases of garbling due to repetition (8 instances) and anticipation (4 instances) to one error of repetition and one of anticipation in A's. I have so far exemplified what the analysis of compositors' errors in Henry V suggests about the kinds of error we must expect to find and where the greater concentration of errors is likely to be; and I have shown how the basis of enquiry can be broadened by considering the evidence of immediately antecedent text set by the same compositors. But the basis needs to be as broad as possible and, as I have already suggested, Richard II and 1 Henry IV are important as shedding light on the kind of alteration that a collator, an editor, or a compositor might make. In this way, they are fundamental to the understanding of Folio texts printed from more elaborately corrected quartos: 2 Henry IV , Richard III , Hamlet , Lear , Othello , Troilus and Cressida , and—we should now add, in view of Mr. Cairncross's conclusions— Henry V . It is therefore the more surprising that Professor Jenkins in a recent article on the Folio Hamlet 24a makes no use of their evidence and argues for conclusions about the Folio copy on mere assumptions about what a collator or compositor might do. On his premises, we should have to postulate in the Folio copy for 1 Henry IV , for instance, the speech prefix ' Falst .' (which occurs only once in Q5, where the prefixes are ' Fal. ' or ' Fals. ') and the spelling 'Bardolph' (which never occurs); we should further have to assume that a scribe and not the compositor was responsible for the free handling of B's stage directions and, therefore, that the Folio text was printed not from Q5 but from a transcript. Professor Jenkins's assumption that compositors reproduced copy word for word and point for point is, of course, at variance with the facts. By accident and design they altered the features of their copy very considerably and, although it seems fairly clear what the designs were, very few were executed consistently. 25 The fact is that an editor today cannot afford to take the risk of concentrating on one text. He needs to be familiar with the whole canon, so that he can work on comparative lines, for the reason given at the outset of this article: that Jaggard's failure to correct proof with copy is a factor that textual critics of the present century have not systematically reckoned with; it undermines conservative editorial policy, since fidelity to a Folio text may be no virtue but merely the condonement of vicious errors, and it complicates more than need be the problem of transmission. The elimination of compositors' errors requires attack from within, on the lines suggested with reference to the indubitable errors in Henry V , and from without, by relating what one text has to contribute to the elucidation of another. The editor of Troilus and Cressida , for instance, faced with the Folio's 'just' for 'right' (Q) at I.iii.164 should connect it with B's substitution in Richard II , already mentioned, and he should recognise A's 'emulations, factions' (II.iii.69) for 'emulous factions' (Q) as an error of assimilation, like his 'Noblish English' in Henry V . B's habit of carrying in his head more than he could reproduce accurately (leading to paraphrase and memorial substitutions), his meddling with stage directions, and justifying lines by altering the wording are always a possibility to be reckoned with. Above all, ramifications outside the Folio should be followed up, especially the Pavier quartos, which shed a great deal of light on the sophistication of texts in Jaggard's printing house. 26 If evidence is not co-ordinated in this way, the danger is that compositors' errors will be interpreted as authoritative corrections (derived from the prompt book) in the Folio Lear , as suggesting far more corrupt copy than need be for the Folio Hamlet , and as Shakespeare's first shots in the Folio Troilus and Cressida (thus suggesting that he revised the manuscript from which the quarto was printed). The number of arbitrary alterations on the first page of the Folio Romeo and Juliet should also act as a warning against taking too seriously all the variants in Hamlet , Lear , Othello , and Troilus and Cressida . Falsification of readings in the printing of Folio texts has done much to ravel the lines of transmission. When an editor has settled the substantive readings of his text, taking into account what can be deduced about the copy, the compositors who set it, and the proof-reading (if any), he is not nowadays out of the wood. To start with, does he head his play 'Henry the Fift' (preserving the Folio's old ordinal numeral) or does he modernise to 'Henry the Fifth'? What must he do about 'accompt', 'wrack', 'venter', 'murther', 'apparence', 'Dolphin', 'eech', 'lyms', 'creeple', 'banqu'rout', 'strooke', 'vawting', 'cursie'—to give only a selection of the problems that face him? Obviously, if he is not a phonologist he is severely handicapped, since it is one thing for an old spelling editor to preserve all copy-text spellings which are not errors but a very different matter to preserve a selection of old spellings and to justify one's choice. An old spelling editor, for instance, would not hesitate over 'strooke' (p.p.) in the above list. Even if he cannot give a phonological account of the spelling, he will have seen it often enough. But what must the partially modernising editor do about it? He has to interpret the spelling in terms of a pronunciation related, by one means or another, to the O.E. strong verb which, by normal sound development, would have resulted in 'strike', 'stroke' (pret.), 'stricken', and he must canvas the possibilities of analogy (with, for instance, 'stick', 'stuck') or dialectal influence (as suggested by Kökeritz) before he can decide whether 'strooke' indicated a different sound from 'struck', which was in process of superseding it. An old spelling editor is concerned with old spelling ; partial modernisation involves discrimination between one spelling and another on a phonological basis. This is a far more tricky business, which must inevitably lead to arbitrary measures, since even experts may often be put to it to decide what sounds some spellings represent; nor will experts always agree. 27 An appreciation of the ways in which Elizabethan speech habits differed from our own is, of course, important; but an impression of what the differences amount to can only be given by phonetic transcription and a survey of the influences that have affected the spoken language since the sixteenth century. The arbitrary preservation of a few seemingly significant spellings is of negligible value, since so many Elizabethan spellings identical with ours (e.g. stream, join, George, hostess, realm, throne, adieu, suit, etc.) represented a pronunciation different from that of today. As a reflection of Elizabethan speech habits, even an old spelling edition will give a totally inadequate picture. The linguistic interest of an old spelling Shakespeare will, in fact, be mainly orthographical: if we want to know how actors spoke their lines, we shall find a truer record in the unsophisticated spelling of Henslowe or John of Bordeaux than in the conventional spelling of printed books. It has often been said that 'Shakespeare' has one spelling oftener than another, as if the spelling of printed books was the author's and the antiquarian zeal for partial modernisation is perhaps prompted by the belief that compositors reproduced the spelling of their copy. But a preponderance of 'murther' and 'shew' spellings in the Folio, for instance, was merely due to the fact that Jaggard A and B preferred these spellings to 'murder' and 'show'—and compositors' preferences tell us nothing about the writer's. Though a start has been made on compositor identification on the basis of differential spellings (a very different matter from the consideration of a compositor's spelling as a whole), 28 nothing is known about conventions in printing-house spelling during the thirty years between the publication of Venus and Adonis and the First Folio: the whole subject awaits analytical investigation on a basis of printing house, date, and compositor. All that seems clear is that, in the metamorphosis of manuscript into print, compositors largely followed their own orthographical bent and that the trade showed no inclination to make spelling more phonetic. Most of the changes introduced or established during the sixteenth century tended, in fact, to widen the breach between orthography and pronunciation (e.g. the restoration of 'b' in 'debt', 'l' in 'realm', and 's' in 'isle'), so that we should beware of supposing that, when Jaggard A and B substituted 'murther' for 'murder', as they usually plainly did, they were expressing anything more than a preference for one spelling over another. The significance of the spelling of printed books in Shakespeare's day remains to be seen. In the meantime, the advantage lies with the traditional practice of bringing spelling into line with current usage, since a gallimaufrey of ancient and modern contributes nothing to the understanding of Shakespeare's meaning or to a critical appreciation of the differences between Elizabethan speech habits and ours. In accidentals, as in substantive readings, we need to be chary of supposing that compositors reproduced copy with the conservatism that has sometimes been assumed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See especially "Variant Readings in the First Folio of Shakespeare," SQ , IV (1953), 279-288. 2 References are to the Cambridge edition, 1891-93. 3 My list does not include his more trivial errors (foul case, turned letters, and an occasionally garbled spelling) 4 It is generally assumed, I think rightly, that these confusions in place and personal names were due to Shakespeare's forgetfulness. 5 Presumably due to a cramped abbreviation. 6 Possibly B registered what he saw not by the eye but by the ear, voicing the sound: 'x' for 'z' might therefore be an error of foul case; if he had intended to set up 'mist-full' he would have used the ligature 'st'. 7 It looks as if Compositor A did not recognise the word, possibly spelt 'paccion' in his copy. The letter cannot have been omitted accidentally, since for 'ct' he would have used the ligature. 8 The leisurely ritual associated with conjuring makes the sense seem less apt to this stirring passage than Rowe's martial 'summon'. 9 Mr. Cairncross's evidence seems to me very strong indeed. 10 How difficult the manuscript was is evident from the many mistakes in transliterating foreign words. 10a See A. Walker, "The Folio Text of 1 Henry IV ," Studies in Bibliography , VI (1954), 45-59. 11 Since the error occurs in a passage where Q3 could easily have been corrected to serve as copy for F, we must suppose the mistake was the collator's. I see no obstacle to supposing that a collator, with a perfectly satisfactory reading in his printed text, none the less sometimes altered it for the worse. How else can we explain F's 'Fenne' for 'sunne' (Q) in T. &amp; C. , V.ii.171, 'Sword' for 'foord' (Q) in Lear , III.iv.52, or 'soules' for 'smiles' (Q) in Rich. II , I.iv.28? How many editors, using the Old Cambridge text as copy for their own, have struck out a better reading (e.g. 'pious bawds') and substituted something inferior? Why should collators have been less fallible? 12 Cf. his 'welcomes newes', 'Lords Staffords' in 1 Hen. IV , I.i.66, V.iii.13. 12a "Collateral Substantive Texts (With Special Reference to Hamlet )," SB , VII (1955), 51-67. 13 Over this and a number of Q readings I find myself in agreement with H. T. Price on the text of Henry V (1920). I also suspect, like Price, that there is a similar error of repetition in F at IV.i.156-7, though I think it likely that Q's 'crave' was a misreading of an abbreviated 'command'. 14 There are 4 instances of B's addition of 'd' in 1 Hen. IV (I.iii.159, 236; II.iii.30; V.i.72). 15 All the same, Q's 'honour' is a great deal better than Walter's 'arms', as two syllables are wanted. 16 The strange heresy that Shakespeare could not write metrically presumably rests on the assumption that proof was read with copy. 17 See Richard E. Hasker, "The Copy for the First Folio Richard II," Studies in Bibliography , V (1953), 53-72; but I doubt whether the example of this quarto had been corrected for use in the theatre (as he argues) in view of the considerable number of Q1-3 errors which the copy for F contained. 18 These are, in fact, the only two F reprints executed throughout in a style comparable to that of plays set from manuscript and corrected quartos. The four reprinted comedies are more mechanical work, and the two tragedies (plus the 3 pages of T. &amp; C. set to follow R. &amp; J. ) are both mechanical and careless apart from some window-dressing on their first pages: contrast, for instance, the first page of R. &amp; J. with the second, or the first page of T. &amp; C. (first setting) with the second—all B's work, exemplifying how variable his style of reproduction might be. 19 B liked a short speech prefix and tended to shorten; A inclined to longer speech prefixes and often expanded: compare, for instance, what they did with Q5's speech prefixes for Falstaff in 1 Hen. IV ; B immediately shortened Q5's ' Fals. ' to ' Fal. ' and stuck to this as his norm, A immediately lengthened Q5's ' Fal. ' to ' Falst. ' and stuck to that as his norm. The length of speech prefixes is often, in fact, a means of discriminating between their stints. The need to justify a line would naturally lead to departure from the norm and might establish a new pattern: thus A in 1 Hen. IV , p. 57, first expanded Q5's ' Pri. ' to ' Prince. ', shortened the latter to ' Prin. ' in a full line, and did not revert to ' Prince. ' for some time. 20 Reminiscent of the metrical bodging in the F Rich. III . For some of this the compositors may have been responsible, but I isolate it since it is common to both. 21 Probably a deliberate alteration: Q3's spelling wavered between 'Herford' and 'Hereford' and for a time B had regularised in favour of the former. 22 At first sight, this looks like one of the characteristic alterations found in B's stints of 1 Hen. IV , but in Rich. II there is an instance of this kind of curtailment in A's work (IV.i.320), so that the collator may have been responsible (cf. Hamlet , II.ii.39 for a similar curtailment of B's). 23 A characteristic error of repetition in Q1. A consideration of proof-corrections (clearly made with reference to copy) in the five known variant formes makes it evident that the substitution of one word for another (especially through repetition) was liable to occur in Q1: only 1 out of 17 errors corrected was due to misreading. 24 The Q1 reading (though preferred by editors) looks like an error of repetition (cf.II.iii.123), like Q1's 'grief' for 'joy' at III.iv.11 (cf. III.iv.9). 24a "The Relation between the Second Quarto and the Folio Text of Hamlet ," Studies in Bibliography , VII (1955), 69-83. 25 Thus, although the F compositors normally reproduced the parentheses of their copy, Hamlet shows that the practice was not invariable; losses, however, occur elsewhere—6 in F Rich. II (1 by A, 5 by B) and 11 in F T. &amp; C. (2 by A, 9 by B). 26 The deliberate absurdity of the 'mobled' queen in Hamlet is, for instance, the kind of reading one finds 'inobled' in the 1619 quartos (cf. the substitution of 'thundering' for Lear's 'pother' in Q2). 27 Thus Kökeritz (p. 176) seems inclined to think that Shakespeare's rhymes of 'chaste', 'haste', 'taste', and 'waste' with 'blast', 'fast', 'last', etc. were eye rhymes, though citing Bulloker and later evidence for a pronunciation going back to M.E. ă in the former group of words. Since some compositors (e.g. Roberts's) almost invariably used the short spellings ('chast' etc.) and others (e.g. Simmes's) had as firm a preference for the long spellings, the partially modernising editor has to decide whether to follow Shakespeare's compositors' spellings or act on Kökeritz's conclusion that Shakespeare used the obsolescent pronunciation (from M.E. ă) in rhymes and some puns. 28 It should always be remembered that what serves for compositor identification may be inadequate for copy identification, which requires the fullest possible information about a compositor's habits. Thus, Jaggard's, Roberts's, Danter's, and Simmes's compositors share certain habits which need to be taken into account in connection with copy but are useless for compositor identification (e.g. the preference of Simmes's two compositors for 'haste', 'chaste', etc.) Further, my own lists of words which serve for compositor identification in the Folio Histories and Tragedies are certainly incomplete. More will certainly be added and I have, in any case, deliberately excluded words of infrequent occurrence; e.g. A (normally) B (normally) idly idlely pesant pezant raze race shrewd shrew'd and I have similarly excluded words for which one of the two compositors' spelling was variable: answere/answer answer bloud/blood blood heire heyre/heire</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Alexander Dyce was the first to notice variant readings in copies of the first quartos of Webster's plays, but his list, which was accepted by F. L. Lucas for his edition of 1927, is by no means complete. I have now collated all the copies of The White Devil (1612), The Duchess of Malfi (1623), and The Devil's Law Case (1623) which are known to me, and this article lists all the press-variants I have found. The very minor variants due to deterioration of the type during printing are excluded from my lists. Normally, changes in the spacing of the type are also excluded. My work has been greatly facilitated by the use of microfilm copies supplied through the kind permission and co-operation of libraries in the United States. To many of their librarians I am also indebted for answers to queries arising from the scrutiny of these films.</field>

For the outer forme of sheet H, it is conceivable that the Latin benediction was cut out by a printing-house 'editor', that 'state' was substituted for the technically correct, but little known, 'seate', and that the entry for Monticelso was omitted on the mistaken notion that this character remained on the stage after his speech ending line 73. The fact that only three out of fifteen copies are in the state which I believe to be the corrected one must also raise a doubt about the order I have given. But the arrangement of the type on H2 v and 3 clarifies the issue. First, the speech prefix for the benediction is indented considerably less than the others on H3, which are all equidistant from the left of the body of the type even when there is a run-on for line 51. Secondly, if the benediction had been removed, the space on the page could easily have been filled up by re-arranging line 50 or line 51 as two lines, or, more simply still, by allowing a line space before the centralized direction ' Enter Monticelso in state '; there would have been no need to move line 48 to H2 v and alter the catchword. On the other hand, if the benediction was added, as I believe, then line 48 would have to be moved to make room, for no two consecutive lines on H3 are short enough to be re-arranged as one. It therefore seems preferable to consider the states in the order I have given, and to presume that either the surviving copies of the quarto give a false impression of the proportion of corrected to uncorrected copies, or else that the changes were made very late in the printing of this forme. The second state of the outer forme of sheet I survives in only four of the copies I have collated, but 'two' seems more suitable than '10' because Webster alludes in this passage to the story of Eteocles and Polynices whose bodies when burnt gave a flame which parted in two directions. 5 Moreover my order is supported by a correction of 'ten' to 'tow' (for 'two') on G4, the order of the states of the inner forme of this sheet being indicated by the correction of 'life' to 'list', 'Well' to 'Wee'l', and, possibly, 'Sir' to 'O Sir'. The order in which I have arranged the states of the inner forme of sheet M is dictated by the consideration that if 'true' had first been printed as 'treu', the corrector would not have taken another ' e ' from the case to put matters right but would merely have transposed the ' e ' and ' u '. It seems more probable that finding the erroneous 'treue' he at first removed the wrong ' e ' and then, discovering his error, transposed. Most of the press-variants in The White Devil can be readily explained as the simple correction of graphic or compositor's errors, but a considerable number of the errors could not have been detected by reading the proofsheets alone. For the correction of the outer forme of sheet D, the inner of G, the outer of H, and the inner of K either the copy or the author himself must have been consulted. The variants suggesting that Webster may have visited the press are confined to G inner and H outer: they are the change of 'Looke' to 'Call' (G2), of 'thought on' to 'louely' (G4), the addition of the Latin benediction (H3), and the addition of an entry for Monticelso with a consequent change of speech direction (H3). The large proportion of uncorrected copies for H outer and I outer suggests that normal proofing was interrupted at this point. The evidence is not, perhaps, considerable enough to make it certain that Webster visited the press, but it will be seen that such a visit would correspond to his probable practice for the other two plays. The running-titles in this quarto are so similar to each other that it is very difficult to trace the press-work in detail. It is, however, reasonably certain that two skeleton-formes were used.</field>

The variants are restricted to single formes and are so few in number that they probably represent a second stage of proof-correction. The first irregularity is the correction of the signature on E1; the inner forme also shows a minor correction and the fact that only five out of seventeen copies are in state ii suggests that the erroneous signature was discovered by accident late in the printing of the outer forme. The correction of proper names on F3 v and the addition of an explanatory stage direction on F4 are the first suggestions that the corrector may have consulted his copy or some other authority. Such consultations are certainly implied by the variants in the outer forme of sheet G and, more particularly, in the inner forme of H. The change of "Pewterers' to 'Painters' on G4 v is not the correction of an obvious error in the proof-sheets, for both readings make good sense; nor is it likely to have been made through reference to the copy, for it is hard to see how, if 'Painters' was in the copy, 'Pewterers' was set in its place. The change was almost certainly due to the personal whim of a corrector or to the second thoughts of the author himself. The greater number of corrections in this forme and the fact that it is in three states also suggest that a new method of proof-correction was adopted at this point. For the first time, too, spelling changes are included among the variants. Corrections in the inner forme of sheet H make it all but certain that it was the author who was helping with the proof-correcting at this stage: they are the change of ' order ' to ' habit ', and ' Hymne ' to ' Ditty ', and the addition of ' in dumbe-shew ' on H1 v , and the excision of the heading 'The Hymne' and the addition of the note 'The Author disclaimes this Ditty to be his' on H2. The addition of a stage direction on H4 and of 'sir' and 'a' (twice) on H2 and H4 may be accounted for in the same way. That the normal course of work in the printing house was interrupted around sheets G and H is also implied by the arrangement of the running-titles. The evidence may be tabulated: I B2 v -C1 v -D1 v -E1 v -F1 v -G1 v -H2 v -I2 v -K 2 v -L2 v -M1 v -N2 v II C2 -D2 -E2 -F2 -G2 -H1 -I1 -K1 -L1 -M2 -N1 III B4 v -C3 v -D3 v -E3 v -F3 v -G3 v -H4 v -I4 v -K 4 v -L4 v -M3 v IV B3 -C4 -D4 -E4 -F4 -G4 -H3 -I3 -K3 -L3 -M4 -N3 V B2 -C1 -D1 -E1 -F1 -G1 -H2 -I2 -K2 -L2 -M1 -N2 VI B1 v -C2 v -D2 v -E2 v -F2 v -G2 v -H1 v -I1 v -K 1 v -L1 v -M2 v -N1 v VII B4 -C3 -D3 -E3 -F3 -G3 -H4 -I4 -K4 -L4 -M3 -N4 VIII B3 v -C4 v -D4 v -E4 v -F4 v -G4 v -H3 v -I3 v -K 3 v -L3 v -M4 v -N3 v From sheets C to G the two skeleton-formes alternate regularly with the inner and outer formes, but at sheet H the skeleton-forme hitherto used for the outer forme appears for the inner; the order of printing may have been disturbed in order to allow the author to introduce his own corrections. Similar change-overs occurred between sheets B and C, L and M, and M and N.</field>

The profusion of corrections in the inner forme of sheet G and the fact that it alone shows variants in both formes suggest that here, as for sheets G and H of The Duchess of Malfi , the normal method of proof-correcting for this book was modified. For this forme the corrector must, at least, have consulted his copy, for several of the errors are not self-evident. The correction of IV.i.17 suggests that Webster himself might have been responsible: it is hard to see how 'sheet' could have been printed if it were not in the copy, and, if it were there, some other authority probably caused its excision. The change of 'salt' to 'rough' on K2 v may also be authorial. The identification of headlines is difficult in this quarto but other bibliographical details suggest that Webster visited the press after the first delivery of the manuscript and before printing was completed. On A1 v the catchword 'The' is incorrect, being appropriate to A3 and not to the dedication on A2; A2 has no catchword, while A2 v repeats 'The' appropriately for A3. It seems probable that sheet A was at first printed with title-page (A1), dramatis personae (A1 v ), and the beginning of the text (A3-4 v ), while A2-2 v was left blank. If this were so, Webster probably brought (or sent) a dedication and preface to the printing-shop some time later; these would then have been set up separately and sheet A sent through the press two more times. This unusual procedure is further attested by the alignment of the type. A2 v and 3 are conjugate pages—none of the copies in England which I have examined leads me to think otherwise—and have similar type ornaments at their heads, but these ornaments vary between copies in their alignment with each other, that on A3 usually being a little higher than the one on A2 v Similarly the alignment of the equal-sized type ornaments at the head of A1 v and 2 varies between copies. Sometimes there is variation in the alignment of the running-heads and type on A3 v and 4. The misalignment of the several pages in different copies does not suggest a perfectly constant spatial relationship between the type on A2 and 2 v and that on the rest of sheet A, and, therefore, my hypothesis of a double printing for sheet A and of a late delivery of the prefatory matter seems the simplest explanation of the facts. Webster's allusion in his preface to unprinted 'Commendatory Verses' may, perhaps, be due to insufficient space on A2 and 2 v , and not to his own modesty as he asserts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV The Compositors of The Duchess of Malfi (1623) Special interest attaches to the printing of The Duchess of Malfi ; not only did the 'Pied Bull' quarto of King Lear and the 1622 quarto of Othello come from the same printing-house, but it is very probable that its compositors were working from a copy in the hand of Ralph Crane. 11a The remarkable similarity in handwriting, spelling, and punctuation in the extant dramatic manuscripts in Crane's hand means that we can watch Okes' compositors at work on a manuscript whose peculiarities can be guessed at with a more than usual confidence. Not only will this add to our knowledge of these workmen, but it may also help to evaluate the evidence for believing that certain plays in the 1623 Shakespeare Folio were set from transcripts by Ralph Crane. Certainly the identification of the work of the two compositors for The Duchess of Malfi strengthens the argument that its copy was such a transcript. A spelling test alone might not enable this identification to be made. The clearest differences between the work of the two men are the spellings Dutchesse Duchesse doe do goe go But these distinctions are only valid from E1 onwards and on these grounds alone one might look for a third compositor setting sheets B, C, and D. Other significantly varied spellings are infrequent and sometimes equivocal when taken by themselves. For instance, i'th/i'th' , and I'll/I'le, ile, i'll , or i'le support the more important spellings in 17 out of 18 occurrences from E1 to F4 v , but thereafter i'th' and I'll are almost invariable. Three more words, litle/little, sudden/sudaine , and young/yong are only helpful occasionally. There is perhaps, a slightly greater tendency to end words in - consonant + ie rather than in - consonant + y where the Dutchesse, doe, goe spellings predominate, 12 but such 'block' spellings are not fully reliable. 13 This evidence becomes much clearer when the spelling of Crane's dramatic manuscripts is taken into account. Barnavelt (BM. Add. MS. 18653), Demetrius and Enanthe (Brogyntyn MS.42), The Witch (Bodleian Mal.12), and two transcripts of A Game at Chess (BM.Lansdowne MS.690 and Bodleian Mal.25) all spell litle, sodaine , 14 and yong invariably, and only very occasionally depart from doe and goe . The Witch spells Duchesse invariably. Now if these forms which appear usual to Crane are discounted in the appraisal of the spellings from The Duchess of Malfi , their counterparts, implying a change from the spelling of the copy, more clearly differentiate the work of the two compositors throughout the book. The preponderance of Duchesse, doe and goe at the beginning appears to be due to both compositors getting used to Crane's hand—it is a very clear hand and their work soon became straightforward, and then, with gathering speed of reading, they each introduced some of their own spellings. The spellings tabulated above now suggest that the work of the two compositors for The Duchess of Malfi may be divided as follows: Compositor A A1-4 v , B3-C2 v , D3-E2 v , F3-G2 v , H3-I2 v , K3-L2 v , M3-N2 v Compositor B B1-2 v , C3-D2 v , E3-F2 v , G3-H2 v , I3-K2 v , L3-M2 v , N3-4 The evidence for sheet A is very slight, but, of the rest of the book, only a few pages (mostly in sheets B, C, and D) remain doubtful. This division of the book is supported by two other kinds of evidence. The markings of scene divisions may be considered first. Two forms are used, 'SCENA.I.' and 'SCENA I.' etc. They occur on the following pages: SCENA. D4, E1, 2 v , F3, I1, L1, 2, M3 v , 4 v , N2 SCENA B2, D1, E4, F1 v , G4, H1 v , 2 v , I3 This corresponds exactly with the suggested division of pages between the two compositors. The other collaborative evidence is the varying frequency of colons and semi-colons throughout the text of The Duchess of Malfi . The numbers may be given for each stint. B B/C C/D D/E E/F F/G G/H H/I I/K K/L L/M M/N N 3 8 4 12 4 10 8 15 4 18 10 14 10 3 v 14 4 13 1 13 5 18 9 15 10 9 11 4 13 9 14 5 14 3 12 9 21 10 19 2 4 v 15 4 8 4 19 1 8 3 18 6 4 1 2 15 5 15 5 14 3 18 11 5 7 13 1 v 11 17 9 14 5 12 2 25 6 16 7 16 2 6 16 9 23 5 21 5 12 4 9 9 12 2 v 6 17 8 8 7 17 2 21 11 21 - 22 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Total 25 115 52 107 36 120 29 129 57 123 59 109 23 The pages probably could not be divided between the compositors on these figures alone, but they are of value as supporting evidence. They may also support the assumption that the copy was a Crane transcript, for it was this assumption which clarified the evidence of the spellings; the two theories hang together. The knowledge of the stints of the two compositors throws interesting light on the evidence for the copy being in Crane's hand which was detailed in Volume VI of Studies in Bibliography . In general the Crane characteristics are found in the work of both compositors; they used brackets and capitals with more or less equal frequency, both used the hyphen in unusual ways, and both set 'neu'r', 'you'll'd' etc., and special spellings like 'noyce', 'whether', 'wincke', etc. Only the past tense ending in '-'de' is restricted to one compositor; the final word cannot be said until more is known about these workmen in other books, but in view of the other evenly distributed forms, it seems probable that for '-'de' endings, as for colons and semi-colons, A reproduced his copy more closely than B. The question of how Crane's professional, clearly written manuscript copy would influence a compositor is of general interest; so far, it can be said that a few of the rarer pecularities which make identification of the copy possible are likely to be found throughout the book, but, with some compositors Crane's forms of some simple, commonly recurring words may disappear altogether after the first few pages. The new knowledge about the compositors will help future editors of The Duchess of Malfi and of other texts from Okes' printing-house. For instance, in view of the paucity of stage directions in this play, it is important to notice that they are found in the work of both compositors; the copy, not the negligence of a compositor, must be blamed for the shortage. Something may also be learnt from the kind of errors to which each compositor was prone: it seems that A was more likely than B to transpose letters within a word, and to omit or confuse speech prefixes; B was apparently more likely to omit a letter from the end of a word. These tendencies need to be checked in other books set by these two compositors.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon (I) by Cyrus Hoy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I The Beaumont and Fletcher canon consists traditionally of fifty-two plays, but it has long been recognized that of these only a small number represent the work of the two dramatists in collaboration. 1 The exact number has yet to be determined, but modern scholarship is agreed that less than twelve of the vast corpus of plays which are currently designated by Beaumont and Fletcher's names are indeed products of their joint authorship. Essentially, the some forty plays that remain represent the unaided work of Fletcher, or Fletcher's work in collaboration with dramatists other than Beaumont. Chief among these is Philip Massinger, whose share in the plays of the corpus can be demonstrated beyond any doubt, but there are others, and Beaumont-and-Fletcher scholarship from Fleay to Oliphant has suggested as candidates for the authorship of the non-Beaumont, non-Fletcher, non-Massinger portions of the plays in question, the names of virtually every dramatist known to have been plying his trade in Jacobean London. Among those whose names, with varying degrees of plausibility, have been advanced, are Nathan Field, William Rowley, Middleton, Shirley, Ford, Webster, Tourneur, Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Chapman, Daborne, and Robert Davenport. Any investigation into the authorship of the plays which comprise the Beaumont and Fletcher canon will not, in the nature of things, consist merely in separating the work of Beaumont from the work of Fletcher. Quite apart from the problem of determining which among the fifty-two plays of the corpus are indeed Beaumont and Fletcher collaborations, there remains the very sizeable task of distinguishing the work of Fletcher from that of his various other collaborators apart from Beaumont. To distinguish any given dramatist's share in a play of dual or doubtful authorship, one must possess some body of criteria which, derived from the unaided plays of the dramatist in question, will serve to identify his work in whatever context it may appear. On this score, the question of authorship in the Beaumont and Fletcher canon is complicated at the very outset, for with the exception of his Masque , there is no play that can with any certainty be regarded as the unaided work of Beaumont. And while the Masque may afford a good enough indication of Beaumont's metrical habits, the poetic diction in which its verse is cast tends to preclude any widespread use of the linguistic forms—especially contractions—which comprise the particular body of criteria to be used as authorial evidence in the present study. Thus, in establishing evidence that can be used in determining the respective shares of the collaborating dramatists, it is necessary to proceed from the known to the unknown, the known in this case being the unaided plays of Fletcher (which, as will be seen, can be identified) and of Massinger (about which there is no problem of identification). My purpose in the present study is to show (1) how the unaided plays of Fletcher can be singled out from among the other plays of the canon, and (2) how the pattern of linguistic preferences which emerges from Fletcher's unaided plays contrasts sufficiently with the language practices in the unaided plays of Massinger as to afford a basis for distinguishing the work of the two dramatists one from the other. It will be noted that the tests to be applied in this and subsequent studies tend not so much to overturn the usual assignment of shares in the plays of the canon as to confirm previous attributions by a more extensive use of linguistic evidence than has hitherto been brought to bear upon the works in question. This is particularly true of Fletcher and Massinger, whose shares have been assigned within reasonably specific limits since the days of Boyle and Oliphant; though it might be argued that tests of the present kind serve to base such assignments on rather more demonstrable evidence than has sometimes been used in the past, while they tend as well to define somewhat more precisely the extent of previous attributions. In the case of such dramatists as Field, Shirley, and Ford, it will be seen in a later article that linguistic evidence provides a more certain basis for assigning their share in the plays of the canon than has yet been available. I The criteria which I propose to apply in investigating the plays of the Beaumont and Fletcher corpus is of a linguistic nature. By linguistic criteria I mean nothing more complicated than an author's use of such a pronominal form as ye for you , of third person singular verb forms in -th (such as the auxiliaries hath and doth ), of contractions like 'em for them , i'th' for in the, o'th' for on/of the, h'as for he has , and 's for his (as in in's, on's , and the like). There is nothing particularly new in the use of criteria of this sort, and I can claim no originality for any of the linguistic tests that I apply in the course of this study. In 1901, A. H. Thorndike drew attention to the use of the colloquial contraction 'em as a possible test of authorship. 2 Thorndike found the form to occur frequently in Fletcher, and not at all in Massinger, but since his evidence for Massinger was based on Gifford's edition—wherein 'em is consistently expanded to them —his conclusions were vitiated, as he later pointed out in an errata slip. Nonetheless, the use of 'em as opposed to them can afford a significant clue to distinct linguistic preferences, and the relevance of Thorndike's evidence remains, though it does not apply in quite such a clear-cut fashion to Fletcher and Massinger as he originally believed. In editing The Spanish Curate for the Variorum Beaumont and Fletcher in 1905, R. B. McKerrow noted the marked preference for the colloquial form ye of the pronoun you in Fletcher's portion of that play, and W. W. Greg, in his Variorum edition of The Elder Brother , made the same observation with regard to that play. The extent to which Fletcher employs the pronominal form ye was noted independently by Paul Elmer More, who commented upon it in an article in The Nation in 1912. 3 In 1916, in an article in the Publications of the Modern Language Association of America , W. E. Farnham considered the use of such contractions as 't (for it , as in to't, on't, in't , etc.), 's (for his or us , as in on's, in's, to's , etc.), i'th', o'th' , and the like, as a possible clue to authorship. 4 Most recently, in 1949, A. C. Partridge has applied linguistic evidence of this sort in his study of the authorship of Henry VIII , adding such additional criteria as is to be derived from the occurrence of the auxiliary do as a mere expletive in affirmative statements, and the use of the inflexional ending -th in the third person singular of notional and auxiliary verbs. 5 Linguistic tests of the sort that I have indicated have not, however, been hitherto applied to the question of authorship on any very considerable scale. The observations of both McKerrow and Greg were made incidentally in the course of editing single plays, and neither ever pursued the matter further. Paul Elmer More, after examining the occurrence of ye in fourteen plays, and pointing to the possible value that such evidence might have as an indication of Fletcher's share in the plays of the canon, added that work of the sort required for any detailed study of the subject was not much to his taste, and must be left to another. Farnham, who did not consider at all the occurrence of ye , dealt with 't, 's and contractions involving the ( i'th', o'th' , etc.) in only eight plays. And Partridge, to the present time, has been concerned only with Henry VIII . Thus the various linguistic tests that have been proposed during the past half century have yet to be applied systematically to all of the plays which comprise the Beaumont and Fletcher canon. From an examination of the language forms present in the plays of the canon, at least one distinct pattern of linguistic preferences is evident at once. This is chiefly marked by the widespread use of the pronominal form ye , together with the frequent use of such contracted forms as i'th', o'th', 'em, h'as, 's for his , and a markedly infrequent use of third person singular verb forms in -th . The pattern can be traced throughout fourteen plays: ye is used repeatedly from the beginning to the end of each, and this is enough to set them apart from every other play in the canon. They are: Monsieur Thomas, Rule a Wife and Have a Wife , Bonduca, The Chances, The Island Princess, The Humorous Lieutenant, The Loyal Subject, The Mad Lover, The Pilgrim, Valentinian, A Wife for a Month, Women Pleased, The Wild Goose Chase, The Woman's Prize . In no one of these does ye ever occur less than 133 times (in The Woman's Prize ), and in the remaining thirteen plays its rate of occurrence is much higher than this, as high as 543 times (in The Wild Goose Chase ). Elsewhere in the canon, ye never occurs with anything approaching this frequency. In certain plays (e.g., The Knight of the Burning Pestle, The Nice Valour, The Coxcomb, A King and no King ), ye appears sporadically or not at all. In certain others (e.g., The Spanish Curate, The Prophetess, The False One, Barnavelt, The Maid in the Mill ) the form appears, but it is to be found clustered in single acts or scenes, and does not occur throughout the length of an entire play. Thus, when ye is found to occur regularly throughout each of fourteen plays—and this in a manner that is not paralleled in any of the other thirty-eight plays of the canon—it seems reasonable to conclude that one is here in the presence of a distinct linguistic preference that can be of use in determining the work of the dramatist whose practice it represents. To identify the dramatist whose linguistic practice is marked by the widespread use of ye is not difficult. He is clearly not Beaumont. The plays of the canon with which Beaumont's name is most closely associated—plays like Philaster, The Maid's Tragedy, A King and no King, The Knight of the Burning Pestle —are precisely those in which ye seldom or never occurs. Nor is Massinger the dramatist in question. An examination of Massinger's fifteen unaided plays shows that, in all of these, ye occurs but twice; in all other instances, Massinger employs the pronominal form you . And the contracted forms ( i'th', o'th' , and the like) which are found to accompany the use of ye in the plays of the canon, are like ye itself conspicuous by their absence in the unaided work of Massinger, whose use of contractions is remarkably conservative. The assumption—a virtually inescapable one—is that the linguistic pattern characterized by a superabundance of ye 's must represent the pattern of Fletcher. For three of the fourteen plays in question ( The Loyal Subject, A Wife for a Month , and Rule a Wife ) there is external evidence for Fletcher's sole authorship, 6 and I have no hesitation in regarding them all as his unaided work. That they are unaided work can, I think, be demonstrated by comparing the manner in which ye occurs in them with its occurrence elsewhere in the canon. As I have already observed, in these fourteen plays the occurrence of ye , and all the linguistic phenomena that accompany its prevalence (absence of third-person verb forms in -th , frequency of such contractions as i'th', o'th', h'as, 's for his ), is constant in its appearance through every act and virtually every scene. In plays of the type of The Spanish Curate and The Prophetess , however, the linguistic pattern established by the occurrence of ye is to be found only within single acts, or within individual scenes within acts, at the end of which it is abruptly broken off. In such cases, it is usually preceded or followed by a pattern of a quite different sort: one in which, first of all, the occurrence of ye is sharply reduced, and in which a decrease in the occurrence of other contracted forms is accompanied by an increased use of the verb form hath . In a very great number of cases, the linguistic pattern which accompanies the pattern established by ye is that of Massinger. A comparison of the first two acts of The Spanish Curate , the first two acts of The Prophetess , and the first act of Barnavelt , to cite but three examples, will indicate the manner in which the two linguistic patterns alternate within the same play. It is, I think, valid to conclude that when a play, of the type represented by The Spanish Curate , demonstrates in consecutive acts and scenes two such sharply opposed linguistic patterns as those characterized by the prevalence and the absence of ye , then that play must represent the work of two separate dramatists. On the other hand, when in a play of the sort represented by The Loyal Subject or Monsieur Thomas a single linguistic pattern is found to be maintained through virtually every scene of its five acts, there is I think no real room for doubt that that play is the work of a single author. Regarding the fourteen plays of this sort in the canon, the linguistic pattern which links them together as the work of a single dramatist is far too distinct in itself, and far too evident throughout each, to admit the possibility of a second hand intervening in their authorship. When a second hand appears in a scene that has been formerly dominated by the Fletcherian linguistic pattern, its presence is noticeable at once. If the second hand is that of a collaborator, then the pattern will be immediately interrupted, and will appear but sporadically throughout the play, as it does in such plays as The Spanish Curate and The Prophetess . If the second hand is that of a reviser, then the whole pattern will be obscured: ye 's will, for the most part, disappear, or their number will be greatly reduced, and the whole texture of Fletcherian accidence is altered. The canon affords an illustration of this in The Night Walker , originally one of Fletcher's unaided plays, but revised in its extant text by Shirley. Since the Fletcherian linguistic pattern is so pronounced and so discernible wherever his unaided work is present, I cannot consider his unaided work to be in fact represented in any play where this pattern is not evident. Thus I cannot agree with all those who have previously studied the Beaumont and Fletcher corpus in placing Wit Without Money among the plays of Fletcher's sole authorship. The linguistic pattern that emerges from this play resembles far more closely the pattern to be found in The Night Walker than the pattern which prevails in such plays as Monsieur Thomas or The Wild Goose Chase . 2 In evaluating linguistic criteria as a test of authorship, it is obvious that no linguistic form can be regarded as distinctive of a particular dramatist in any absolute sense; the extent to which he employs a given form may distinguish sharply enough his practice from that of two other dramatists, but not necessarily from that of a third. Thus emerges the necessity, in determining linguistic criteria for the work of any one dramatist, of singling out forms which are at once representative of his language preferences, while serving to differentiate his work from the maximum number of his known or supposed collaborators. The value to be attached to any piece of linguistic criteria is, in the end, completely relative: all depends upon the degree of divergence between the linguistic patterns that are to be distinguished. With regard to the linguistic patterns which distinguish respectively the work of Fletcher and Massinger, these, as has been observed, and as will be seen readily enough from the tables at the end of this study, are composed of language preferences which are of an essentially opposite nature. From this it is to be concluded that, in distinguishing the grammatical usage of two dramatists, a given linguistic form need not be present in an author's work to afford evidence for determining his share of a collaborated play. On the contrary, when his collaborator is found to employ that form, its absence in the work of the dramatist in question affords the best possible evidence for distinguishing the work of the two. In a play of Fletcher and Massinger's joint authorship, the fact that Massinger is known to make little or no use of the pronominal form ye constitutes evidence just as positive for his work as Fletcher's known preference for the form constitutes for his. Evidence of this sort is of the best, precisely because here the degree of divergence between the linguistic patterns that are being distinguished is as great as it can well be. The one pattern is marked by a strong preference for ye , with the use of the form averaging fifty per cent; the other reflects a tendency to avoid the form altogether. Such clearly opposed linguistic preferences are, unfortunately, rare. The extent to which the work of two such collaborators as Fletcher and Massinger can be distinguished by the presence or the absence of a single linguistic form—pronominal ye —is, indeed, quite exceptional in the annals of the Jacobean collaborated drama. More often, such linguistic preferences as can be shown to exist in the work of two dramatists are of a more quantitative sort, with a given linguistic form present in the work of both, but present at a higher rate of occurrence in the work of one than in that of the other. In such a case, the value to be attached to any single linguistic form as evidence for authorship must depend upon the extent to which, in their unaided work, the one dramatist will tend to employ it and the other to eschew it. The less the degree of difference in the use which two dramatists make of the same linguistic form in their unaided work, the less will be its value as evidence for distinguishing their shares in a play of divided authorship. As two dramatists tend to approximate each other in their use of a given language form, the evidential value of that form is accordingly diminished. Fortunately for any attempt to determine authorship on the basis of linguistic preferences, a single language form may be used by both of two dramatists and yet be of value in distinguishing their work in collaboration, provided only that that form can be shown to occur at a consistently higher rate in the unaided work of one dramatist than in that of the other. The value to be attached to the verb form hath , as it occurs in the unaided work of Fletcher and Massinger, is a case in point. Hath is to be found in the unaided plays of both dramatists, yet its occurrence in any single play of Fletcher's never equals its occurrence in any one of Massinger's plays. Similarly with ye in the work of Fletcher and Field: ye occurs with some regularity in Field's unaided plays, but its occurrence there never approaches the extraordinary frequency with which Fletcher employs the form. The evidence to be derived from linguistic preferences as sharply opposed as these is second in importance only to that which is the most significant of all: the evidence that is based upon language preferences which reveal themselves in the prevalence of a given form in the work of one dramatist and its absence in that of another. Thus far, in considering the factors that must be taken into account in evaluating linguistic criteria, I have tried to emphasize the necessity for determining the extent to which a given language form does indeed point to a clear and unequivocal linguistic preference that will serve in distinguishing the work of two dramatists. It need hardly be said that no single linguistic preference will serve equally to distinguish the work of a given dramatist from that of all others. As I have already observed, a grammatical or linguistic practice that may tend to set a particular dramatist apart from two of his fellows will not necessarily set him apart from a third. It should be obvious that no piece of linguistic criteria can be evaluated in isolation; the significance which a single form may possess for distinguishing the work of any one dramatist will derive directly from the extent to which that form is present in the work of his collaborators. The frequent use of ye, hath, i'th' or whatever in the plays of any dramatist is of no value in distinguishing his work from that of dramatists who employ such forms with equal or even approximate frequency. And no importance can be attached to the absence of a particular form from the work of any one dramatist unless it is known to occur in some noticeable degree in the work of another. The linguistic pattern that has been adduced for a dramatist on the basis of his unaided work will, of course, remain constant. However, the value of the evidence to be attached to the presence or absence of such linguistic forms as contribute to the distinctive nature of this over-all pattern will obviously shift in relation to the prevalence of those same forms within such other linguistic patterns as may be present with it in a single play. Or, stated in another way: if a given linguistic form is known to occur with approximately the same frequency in the work of dramatists A, B and C, but does not occur at all in the work of dramatist D, then while that particular form will have no value as evidence for distinguishing the work of A, B and C, it will have considerable value for distinguishing the work of any one of these from dramatist D. The use of the verb form hath in the plays of Massinger and Field will not serve to distinguish these dramatists from each other, but it may serve to distinguish both from Fletcher. And while the absence of ye from the plays of Massinger will have very little value in distinguishing his work from that of Beaumont, who seems to have employed the form at least as sparingly as Massinger himself, the fact that Massinger almost never uses ye will serve to distinguish his work not only from Fletcher's, but from that of Field as well. Clearly, no linguistic form can be regarded as the exclusive property of a single writer. Just as clearly, however, writers can, and often do, demonstrate a preference for certain colloquial and contracted linguistic forms (a fact that is strikingly evidenced in the case of Fletcher and Massinger) and such preferences can often serve to set apart the work of one author from that of another. In a study such as this, the problem must be to distinguish what are, indeed, an author's preferential forms, and then to determine which of these can serve to differentiate his work from that of his associates. For such a purpose, the very best linguistic evidence will always consist in those forms which a given writer can be shown to have used with conspicuous frequency, but which those with whom he collaborated can be shown to have used ever so sparingly or not at all. 3 The language forms which constitute the greater part of my evidence for authorship consist, as will have been observed, of linguistic preferences which—in a great number of cases—are made manifest in only the most minute typographical features of a printed text. In dealing with such forms, and especially when one is preparing to attach any great importance to the frequency of their occurrence, the question is naturally raised as to the extent to which an author's choice of contractions is preserved in the transmission of his text. It is well known that certain seventeenth-century compositors possessed clearly defined spelling preferences which were imposed upon whatever text they might be setting, and one wonders just how far such compositorial preferences were carried. Would a compositor, for instance, venture to impose his own preferences among colloquial and contracted forms upon a text as well? If so, then any study such as the present one is the sheerest kind of folly, for the linguistic forms by means of which one is seeking to identify a given dramatist's share in a collaborated play might have been introduced into the text by any number of unknown compositors. There is no reason, however, to believe that compositors took undue liberties with the contracted forms in the manuscript before them; there is, on the contrary, good reason for believing that they reproduced such forms with considerable fidelity. Both W. E. Farnham and Paul Elmer More have drawn attention to the extent to which the same contractions occur, with only slight variation, in the Beaumont and Fletcher quartos and folios. As Farnham has observed, it is clear from the verse that such contractions were intended by the author, and honoured by the printer, because they are a necessary part of the metrical structure. And equally to the point is his further observation that differences in the use of contractions in the parts of a collaborated play are "too orderly to be ascribed to the vagaries of a printer" (Farnham, op. cit. , p. 332). No one can seriously consider the two linguistic patterns present in such a play as The Spanish Curate , coinciding as they do with the beginning of acts and scenes, to represent the language habits of two compositors. If such linguistic patterns did in fact represent the language preferences of two compositors, their occurrence would be found to accord with the bibliographical units of the printed text, and would not in any way be related to the act and scene divisions of the play itself. Finally, the manner in which the same linguistic preferences can be shown to persist throughout the unaided plays of a given dramatist, though the extant texts of these are the work of several different printers, affords the ultimate proof that language forms of the sort which can furnish evidence for authorship originated with the author himself, and are sufficiently preserved in a printed text. Fletcher's strong preference for the pronominal form ye is just as evident in the 1639 quarto text of Monsieur Thomas , printed by Thomas Harper, or in the 1640 quarto of Rule a Wife , printed by Leonard Lichfield, as in the remaining twelve plays of his unaided authorship, printed for the first time by Humphrey Moseley in the 1647 folio. The unaided Massinger canon presents what is perhaps an even stronger argument for this contention, for it is the product of even more diverse compositorial hands. Of Massinger's fifteen unaided plays, thirteen were published, and these represent the work of eleven printers. Yet the linguistic preferences which emerge from these are completely consistent within themselves, and what is equally striking, they are preferences which in no way contradict what we know of Massinger's language from the manuscript—in his autograph—of one of his unpublished plays. A study of the occurrence, in some one hundred plays, of the linguistic forms that are here employed as authorial evidence, convinces me that, in the greater number of cases, the use of such forms—either in the unaided plays of a given dramatist or in plays of divided authorship—is far too systematic to admit the possibility that their presence has been affected, in any truly significant degree, by compositorial intervention. If, however, the evidence available would tend to absolve compositors from the charge of tampering with the contractions in the manuscript which they were set to reproduce, the same cannot, apparently, be said for certain scribes in their preparation of transcripts for the use of the theatre, the printer, or a private patron. The three scribal transcripts which exist for Fletcher's unaided plays demonstrate, on the one hand, a reasonable accuracy in reproducing the linguistic preferences of the author on the part of such a scribe as Ralph Crane and, on the other, the far more erratic practice of such a scribe as Edward Knight, with the practice of the unidentified scribe of The Woman's Prize falling somewhere between the two. Crane prepared a private transcript of Fletcher's The Humourous Lieutenant (titled in his manuscript Demetrius and Enanthe ). Since his text contains some seventy-five lines not present in the text of the first folio, the supposition is that Crane's transcript derives from Fletcher's original manuscript, whereas the folio text represents a prompt-book containing theatrical abridgements. In his transcript, Crane introduces some thirty-four ye 's not present in the text of the folio, while he omits some fourteen ye 's which the folio text exhibits, but the difference of approximately twenty ye 's in the total occurrence of the form in the two texts is not great. It speaks, in fact, well for the care with which Crane reproduced his copy when it is compared with the wide divergence in the occurrence of ye in the two extant texts of another of Fletcher's unaided plays. Bonduca (For a careful study of Crane's characteristics as a transcriber, see R. C. Bald, Bibliographical Studies in the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647 , p. 95 , but more especially his edition of A Game at Chesse by Thomas Middleton , pp. 171-173.) The text of Bonduca is extant in a scribal transcript, prepared by Edward Knight, the book-keeper of the King's Company, from Fletcher's foul papers, and in the text of the 1647 folio, printed from the prompt-book. In the folio text, the pronoun ye is used 352 times; in Knight's transcript, the occurrence of the form has been reduced by more than half, to 147 times. The variation in the two texts in this respect is of significance because, on the basis of the first folio, the percentage of ye 's to you 's is the highest to be found in any play of Fletcher's unaided authorship. If, however, Bonduca survived only in Knight's manuscript, the play would present the lowest percentage of ye 's to you 's in all Fletcher, with the occurrence of the form falling markedly below its normal frequency in his unaided plays. There is evidence of scribal intervention affecting the use of ye in another Fletcher play, The Woman's Prize , and there is good reason to suppose that the scribe responsible for the reduction in the occurrence of the form is once again Knight. Like Bonduca , The Woman's Prize is extant in two texts: an undated private transcript, prepared by an unidentified scribe, and the text of the 1647 folio. In the first folio text, ye occurs but 84 times, a number far below the usual occurrence of the form in Fletcher's unaided work. In the manuscript, ye is found 133 times, and while this still represents the lowest occurrence of the form in Fletcher, the increase of 49 ye 's makes for a rather more satisfactory basis for regarding the play as Fletcher's own. There is external evidence which almost certainly has some bearing on the first folio text of the play and the linguistic forms which it exhibits. On 18 October 1633 the Master of the Revels, Sir Henry Herbert, suppressed a performance of The Woman's Prize (he refers to the play by its alternate title, The Tamer Tamed ), which the King's Company had scheduled for that afternoon. On the following morning the prompt-book was brought to him, whereupon he proceeded to purge it of "oaths, prophaness, and ribaldrye" ( Herbert , p. 20). The play, Herbert explains, was an old one, evidently licensed during the Mastership of one of his predecessors, which the King's Company had sought to revive, under a different title, without applying for a new license. Herbert was thereby deprived of his licensing fee, a matter about which he felt strongly, as he indicates in the entry in his Office Book, though he advances another and more public-spirited reason why old plays should not be restaged without the allowance of the Master of the Revels: "they may be full of offensive things against church and state; the rather that in former times the poetts tooke greater liberty than is allowed them by mee" (p. 22). The upshot of the whole affair was that two days later, on 21 October, Herbert returned the prompt copy, properly expurgated, to the players, accompanied by a note to Edward Knight enjoining him to "purge [the actors'] parts, as I have the booke." The players' capitulation to Herbert's demands was complete; two of their chief members apologized for "their ill manners" and asked his pardon, and the following month Fletcher's The Loyal Subject , which had been licensed by Sir George Buc in 1618, was submitted to Herbert for re-licensing. Mr. R. C. Bald, in a most valuable discussion of the two texts of The Woman's Prize in his Bibliographical Studies in the Beaumont and Fletcher Folio of 1647 (p. 60), points out that, while "the manuscript omits two whole scenes (II.i and IV.i), two passages of fourteen and seven lines respectively, and eight of three lines or less" that are included in the folio, the manuscript exhibits, on the other hand, "eleven passages . . . varying in length from half a line to nine lines," which the folio omits. It is Mr. Bald's opinion that the manuscript gives the play, which was originally performed in 1610 or 1611, "as cut for acting before Herbert's time," while "the folio gives a fuller version of the play, but observes the cuts that were made by Herbert in 1633." To observe the cuts that Herbert demanded, it does not seem unreasonable to suppose that a new prompt-book was drawn up, and if a new prompt-book was prepared, it seems clear enough from Herbert's note of 21 October that the task would be performed by the book-keeper Knight. From Knight's transcript of Bonduca we know how the Fletcherian ye diminished under his hand (see Bald, pp. 99-100), and I can only account for the small number of ye 's in the folio text of The Woman's Prize by supposing the manuscript from which that text derives to have been prepared by him. With regard to the scribal transcript, the supposition would be that the scribe responsible for it has been somewhat more faithful in reproducing the language forms that must have stood in the original. Since the manuscript text reflects more clearly than the folio the quality of the Fletcherian original, I have used it as the basis for the statistics set forth for The Woman's Prize in the linguistic tables at the end of the present study. The possibility of scribal intervention should perhaps be considered in relation to two other of the plays which can be regarded as Fletcher's unaided work, Rule a Wife and A Wife for a Month . These, apparently Fletcher's last plays, exhibit after The Woman's Prize the least number of ye 's of all the fourteen plays that I consider to be his. The first folio text of A Wife for a Month gives clear indication of author's foul papers, but it is not impossible that the text has derived from a not too careful transcript of these. Two speeches are printed in alternately abridged and expanded versions, and there is a bad tangle in the second scene of the fourth act which clearly would have had to be set to rights before the manuscript in back of the first folio text could have been used as a prompt book. But if Knight's transcript of Bonduca is any indication of his work for a private patron, he would not have been above letting such difficulties stand in a text which he prepared, if it were not to serve as a theatrical prompt copy. And if the total number of ye 's still present in the text of A Wife for a Month (176) does indeed represent a reduction from the original number, Fletcher's favourite pronoun has here been given much the same treatment as Knight accorded it in his Bonduca manuscript. The substantive text of Rule a Wife , that of the 1640 quarto, probably derives, as Prof. Jump has suggested, "either from a prompt-book or from a manuscript directly descended from a prompt-book." 7 The play was licensed for acting by Sir Henry Herbert on 19 October 1624, and four months later, on 8 February 1625, Herbert re-licensed The Honest Man's Fortune , for which Knight had prepared a new prompt book that is extant in his autograph. It would seem likely, then, since he was actively employed by the King's Company at this time, that Knight prepared the prompt-book for Rule a Wife as well. There is evidence of a sort in the quarto of Rule a Wife that might be considered to link it with his work. The chief feature which the quarto and the Bonduca manuscript have in common is a frequent occurrence of the contraction 'um (for 'em ). Since Knight employs 'em throughout his manuscript of The Honest Man's Fortune, 'um is not likely to represent his own linguistic preference. And since the form is 'em throughout the 1640 quarto of Rollo, Duke of Normandy , printed in the same house and in the same year as Rule a Wife , it seems improbable that the 'um spelling is compositorial. I regard it rather as a Fletcherian form which Knight has reproduced forty-six times in his transcript of Bonduca , and—perhaps—thirty-two times in the manuscript behind the quarto of Rule a Wife . Seventeen times in the Bonduca manuscript, Knight uses the spelling hir for her . The hir spelling occurs twenty-nine times in the quarto of Rule a Wife , and it is the prevalent spelling throughout the manuscript of The Honest Man's Fortune . The evidence is admittedly not great, but combined with the fact that Knight was the probable person to have prepared a prompt-book for the King's Company at this period, it seems at least possible that the diminished number of ye 's (213) in the quarto of Rule a Wife may be traced to his intervention in the transmission of the text. 4 The following tables set forth the rate of occurrence, in the unaided plays of Fletcher and Massinger, of those linguistic forms which are of value in distinguishing the respective shares of the two dramatists in plays of divided authorship. I have omitted The Faithful Shepherdess from the number of Fletcher's unaided plays, for although it is undoubtedly Fletcher's own, linguistically at least it has nothing in common with any other of his unaided works. Its language is that of pastoral poetry, uncol-loquial and somewhat archaic. It abounds in linguistic forms (most notably the third person auxiliary forms hath and doth ) which Fletcher seldom or never uses in his other unaided plays, while all the most distinguishing of his colloquial forms are either completely absent, or present in only a negligible degree. Nothing could be more misleading than to regard the language of The Faithful Shepherdess as typically Fletcherian. Of the linguistic forms cited in the tables below, ye is much the most important for purposes of authorial evidence. Since Fletcher employs the form as both subject and object, direct or indirect, in either singular or plural number, the rate of its occurrence in his unaided plays is very high. In the fifteen unaided plays of Massinger, the form occurs but twice. Contractions in y' ( y'are, y'ave and the like) are much less frequent in Fletcher, and are of no value in distinguishing Fletcher's work from Massinger's. The two occurrences of y'are in Fletcher's Monsieur Thomas, Rule a Wife, Bonduca , and The Pilgrim , for example, are matched by the two instances of the form in Massinger's The Bondman . The single instances of y'ave and y'have in, respectively, Fletcher's The Chances and Bonduca are paralleled by single appearances of the same forms in, respectively, Massinger's A New Way to Pay Old Debts and The Guardian . There is nothing to distinguish Massinger's use of contractions in y' from Fletcher's, and I have not included them among the forms cited in the following tables. Regarding the verb form hath , there is a distinct difference in the Fletcher-Massinger usage. In Fletcher, the form never occurs more than 6 times in a single play, and in two plays it occurs not at all. In Massinger, on the other hand, hath never occurs less than 8 times in any one play, and generally it is found a good deal more often than this—as often as 46 times in a single play. Doth comes in only one of the fourteen Fletcherian plays listed below, but since it appears but 5 times in Massinger, the distinction in the practice of the two dramatists on this point is not great. The contraction 'em appears in all of Fletcher's unaided plays, from 23 times in Women Pleased to 130 times in The Loyal Subject . In certain of Massinger's plays, it will be noted, 'em is to be found occurring as frequently as it does in certain of Fletcher's. But it seems significant that all of these (e.g., The Picture, The Guardian, The City Madam ) are late plays, licensed for acting after Fletcher's death in 1625. 8 In Massinger's early plays, which would presumably reflect his language practices at the time of his collaboration with Fletcher, 'em is used a good deal more sparingly than in the unaided plays of Fletcher or in the later work of Massinger himself: 7 times, for example, in The Parliament of Love , 9 times in The Renegado , 12 times in The Duke of Milan . I tabulate the occurrence of the form for whatever value it may have as a piece of corroborating evidence for distinguishing the work of the two dramatists. The evidence to be derived from the contraction i'th' is, on the whole, good. Despite the fact that the 7 occurrences of the form in Fletcher's The Island Princess are equalled in Massinger's The Guardian , the form is found at least 4 times in all of Fletcher's plays, where it may appear as many as 28 times, while it is found in but 5 plays of Massinger's, and in none of these more than 7 times. It may be worth noting that the five plays in which the form occurs are late ones, and that i'th' appears in no play of Massinger's written before Fletcher's death. A form, however, which Massinger tends to employ occasionally, but which occurs only a single time in Fletcher, is the contraction i'the . The contraction o'th' affords evidence of a sufficiently clear-cut sort: the form occurs at least once in all fourteen of Fletcher's unaided plays; it occurs not at all in Massinger. The colloquial form a (for he ) is found in six of Fletcher's plays, but appears in none of Massinger's. Of a similar nature is the contraction 'is (for he is ), present in five of Fletcher's unaided plays, but not present in Massinger. H'as (for he has ) is found at least twice in each of the fourteen unaided plays of Fletcher, but it occurs only a single time in Massinger. The contraction t' (for to , before a following vowel or h ) affords evidence of a sort for Massinger; it occurs at least once in ten of his fifteen unaided plays, but is found only a single time in Fletcher. Contractions involving 's for his occur chiefly in Fletcher following the prepositions in and on . There are single instances in Fletcher of enclitic 's for his with four other prepositions ( at, for, to, up ); with an adverb ( than ); with a verb ( strike ). In Massinger, 's for his occurs but three times: twice in the contraction in's , once in the contraction of's . Only the uses of 's for his with in and on have seemed worth recording in the tables that follow. As for contractions in 's for us , these occur most commonly in Fletcher with the imperative verb form let. I find only two occasions in which Fletcher has used enclitic 's for us after other notional verbs ( put and make ); elsewhere, he uses the form only after the preposition on (5 times). In Massinger, 's for us is used only in the contraction let's , and even this quite normal form Massinger uses very sparingly. It is the only contraction in 's for us that I have recorded below. The enclitic use of 't for it with both prepositions and verbs (in contractions such as in't, on't, for't, to't, is't ) is standard in the work of Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists, and contractions of this sort are of no worth in distinguishing the work of Fletcher and Massinger, for their rate of occurrence in the work of each is virtually identical. In the following tables I have recorded only one form in 't for it , the contraction of't , and this only because the form does not appear in Fletcher, while it occurs from one to nine times in thirteen of the fifteen unaided plays of Massinger. To summarize the chief features of the linguistic patterns of Fletcher and Massinger: the Fletcherian pattern is one which is marked above all by the constant use of ye ; one which exhibits a strong preference for the contraction 'em to the expanded form them ; one which regularly employs such other contractions as i'th', o'th', h'as , and 's for his , and which makes sparing use of the third person singular verb forms hath and doth .

There ye occurs twice in fifteen plays. Hath occurs at an average rate of 27 times. In the seven plays of Massinger's sole authorship written before Fletcher's death, and so reflecting most nearly the author's linguistic preferences during the period of his collaboration with Fletcher, 'em is used an average of 12 times per play, them an average of 23 times. The contraction i'th' is found 18 times in five of Massinger's unaided plays, all of which date after the death of Fletcher. O'th' does not appear in any of Massinger's unaided plays; h'as is found but once (in a post-Fletcher play); 's for his occurs twice (both times in a play written after Fletcher's death). In the linguistic pattern which emerges from the unaided plays of Massinger written during Fletcher's lifetime, it can fairly be said then that the Fletcherian ye has no parallel; that Massinger's average use of hath is nine times greater than Fletcher's; that the Fletcherian preference for 'em to them is precisely reversed in Massinger; and that the contractions i'th', o'th', h'as , and 's for his are completely absent from his work at this period. The linguistic patterns of the two are as nearly opposite as they could well be.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A Printer's Manuscript of 1508 by W. H. Bonds</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joannes Jovianus Pontanus, the Neapolitan humanist, died in 1503, leaving a number of important unpublished works in verse and prose, and an active coterie of friends and admirers who were determined that they should be published. During his lifetime, Pontanus had been the leading spirit of the academy which took his name. After his death, the Accademia Pontaniana embarked upon an ambitious program of gathering and editing his works, a program which was to bring forth eight volumes from the press of Sigismund Mayr at Naples between 1505 and 1512, some of the texts of which eventually served as the basis for Aldus's collected edition in three volumes, 1518-1519. The labor of preserving these works was well organized and devotedly carried out. Jacopo Sannazaro, famous as the author of Arcadia and one of Pontanus's leading disciples, assisted in collecting the texts; Francesco Puderico undertook the raising of funds to make publication possible; and Pietro Summonte assumed the editorial burden. No doubt they were also assisted by the scholarly printer, Mayr, who never failed to refer to himself in the colophons of the several books in some such terms as "singularis ingenii artifex." In order to protect the venture, Summonte secured a ten-year patent for the publication of Pontanus's works in the Kingdom of Naples, which he announced in the colophon of the first of the series in these terms: "Nequis praeter unum P. Summontium aut hoc: aut alia Ioannis Iouiani Pontani opera in tota Regni Neapolitani ditione imprimere: siue haec ipsa aliunde aduecta uendere per decennium impune queat: amplissimo priuilegio cautum est." ( Parthenopei , 1505, sig. T8 v ). These publications were prepared with extraordinary care, and great pains were taken to preserve the prototype manuscripts after the works were in print. Although the manuscripts were scattered during the sixteenth century, most of them survive, the greatest numbers being in the Vatican Library and at Vienna. 1 In the British Museum is preserved the manuscript of one of the works, De Prudentia (Add. MS. 12,027), which was prepared for the press and from which was set up the undated edition published by Mayr, probably in 1508. This manuscript may be taken as representative of the entire group, which forms an important block among the relatively few examples of early printer's copy which have survived to the present day. It testifies to Summonte's meticulous editorial preparation, which even extended to some attempt at typographical design, and it shows clearly how the printer treated the text. 2 The edition is question is a well-printed folio of 94 unnumbered leaves, and its collation is a-g 8 h 6 i-m 8 . The title-page reads: PONTANI | De Prudentia : ac deinceps alii de Phi-|lofophia libri : ut per indicem qui in | calce operis eft : licet uidere. Evidently, when typesetting began, it had been determined that De Prudentia was not to stand alone, but no decision had been reached as to what other work or works should accompany it. De Prudentia occupies quires a to h, and the remainder of the volume is taken up with the De Magnanimitate of Pontanus. The colophon to which the title refers is on sig. m8 v , and it reads, "Quae toto contineantur libro: haec sunt. De Prudentia libri quinque: De Magnanimitate duo. Cum decennali priuilegio." No date appears in the book, but Michele Tafuri, the bibliographer of Pontanus, established its date beyond reasonable doubt as 1508. 3 He showed that references in Summonte's dedications to Pontanus's Actius (1507) and De Sermone (1509) indicate that it must have appeared after the one and before the other. The situation is a little complicated by the fact that a dated octavo edition of De Prudentia was published by Filippo Giunta in Florence, also in 1508. But the Giunta edition has no direct connection with the Mayr edition. It was derived from a different manuscript and passed through the hands of a different editor. It is thus for all practical purposes totally distinct from the Mayr edition, and it needs no further consideration in the present instance. In common with all of Mayr's editions of Pontanus, De Prudentia contains a most circumstantial explicit . It occurs on m7 r , following the register, and reads, "Neapoli per Sigismundum Mayr Alemanum: singularis ingenii artificem: Ac fideliter ex archetypis: Pontani ipsius manu scriptis: quae post operum editionem: P. Summontius qua par fuit in Iouianum suum pietate: Neapoli in bibliotheca Diui Dominici seruanda collocauit." What is known of Pontanus's library casts some light on this explicit . When Pontanus died in 1503, he was succeeded as head of the Accademia by Summonte, who at once began the pious labor of preserving the master's works from dispersal and loss. Pontanus's two daughters, Aurelia and Eugenia, seem to have placed little value on either the achievements or the library of their father. Summonte made it his first task to persuade them to turn over to him the bulk of the holograph and other manuscripts of the unpublished books, and these were to form the basis for the Accademia's editions. The transaction appears to have taken place shortly after Pontanus's death, and by it Summonte became both custodian and literary executor of the writings. In 1505 the younger daughter, Eugenia, was persuaded to present the remainder of her father's library to the church of S. Domenico in Naples. The inventory of the gift lists forty-nine volumes, and includes four of Pontanus's works, while several of the classical manuscripts were copied out in his own hand. 4 De Prudentia and De Magnanimitate do not appear in the list. Presumably they were among the manuscripts already in Summonte's safekeeping. However that may be, the original manuscripts (or archetypi , as Summonte always called them) of the works printed between 1505 and 1512 were added by their editor to the library of S. Domenico as they appeared in print. Apparently this scheme for their preservation developed after Eugenia's gift, for there is no mention of it in the poems of 1505 or the Actius of 1507, the first two publications in the series. But most of the later volumes contain some such statement as that in De Prudentia , and it is reasonable to assume that Summonte placed all the manuscripts in S. Domenico. But the plan for safeguarding the manuscripts and books of Pontanus was doomed to failure. In the turbulent years of the mid-sixteenth century, the library of S. Domenico was dispersed. How, when, or by whom is not known. Some volumes eventually found their way into the Vatican Library, and it is possible that they came there by way of the collection of Cardinal Guglielmo Sirleto (1504-1585). Sirleto had strong Neapolitan connections, and he began and ended his career at Rome as custodian of the Vatican Library. He was also a notable collector in his own right. At his death, his collection passed into the hands of Cardinal Ascanio Colonna, and at last into the Vatican. Several more of the manuscripts came into the possession of Joannes Sambucus, and with the rest of his extensive collection were added to the Imperial Court Library at Vienna. The manuscript of De Prudentia here under consideration contains no indication that it was among those placed in S. Domenico by Summonte, but such negative evidence should not be given too much weight. It evidently remained at Naples, for it bears at the head of the text the inscription "BER. ROTAE," the mark of ownership of Bernardino Rota (1509-1575), the Neapolitan poet and humanist. Since another manuscript of De Prudentia was among those taken to Vienna by Sambucus, 5 it may well be that our manuscript was never deposited in S. Domenico at all; but the case is far from certain. Add. MS. 12,027 is written on paper in a clear humanist hand, with some additions and revisions in the same hand, and further revisions by at least two other hands. The book is a folio, and the normal page contains twenty-three lines of text. Its gatherings are unsigned, and its collation is 1-3 10 4 14 5-11 10 12 12 13 10 , one hundred and thirty-six leaves in all; the last five leaves are blank, as are also leaves 99 and 100. Catchwords appear only on the last verso of each gathering, written downwards vertically at the foot of the inner margin. The volume is foliated in an early hand, and the old foliation runs to 138. There is a gap of two numbers following the last page of text, and it may be that the last quire once contained twelve leaves, of which the central pair is now missing. Two leaves of a different kind of paper precede the text. These were originally end-leaves, and the verso of the first bears the inscription in an early hand, "Pontani manu opus conscriptum, et jn Actij Sinceri Bibliotheca Repertum." This inscription has been said to be in the hand of Aldus Manutius, but comparison with specimens of Aldus's autograph indicates that it is not; nor is it in the hand of the younger Aldus. A later, probably eighteenth-century, hand has added beneath this the words, "ejusque Actii Sinceri Sannazarii manu castigatum." On the facing page what appears to be the same later hand has written, "Joannis Joviani Pontani opus M. S. ad Tristanum Caracciolum et Franciscum Pudericum, de Prudentia in quinque libros distributum; repertum in Actii Sinceri Bibliotheca. Codex chartaceus manu ipsius Pontani castigatum." 6 This last inscription agrees best with the evidence supplied by the manuscript itself. There is no indication other than these three inscriptions that the book was ever in the possession of Jacopo Sannazaro, 7 whose distinctive autograph certainly does not appear anywhere in the manuscript. The text itself is not holograph, but the work of a good professional scribe. However, many of the corrections and revisions are in the hand of Pontanus, and the second revising hand was that of Summonte. In addition to the work of author and editor, the manuscript contains various markings made by the printer both before typesetting commenced and also while it was in progress. Some account of these revisions and markings, in the approximate order in which they were made, may serve as a history of the manuscript on its way towards and through the composing-room. 8 The work of the author is limited almost entirely to the rectification of scribal errors: the insertion of omitted words and phrases and, in one or two cases, lacking chapter-headings. It is impossible to determine who made many of the smaller changes of capitalization and orthography. Page 8 b (fig. 1) may be taken as an example. The interpolation at the foot is undoubtedly in Pontanus's autograph, and his was probably the hand that altered "beneficitia" to "benificentia" in the last sentence preceding the heading "De Fortuna." Who corrected the q of "assqutrices" to c, capitalized the F of "Fortuna," and deleted "per" before "multa" in the penultimate line, can scarcely be determined. In any event, it is obvious that Pontanus read through the manuscript with care and attention, looking principally for places where scribal carelessness had altered his meaning. Summonte's hand may be seen in a variety of alterations in the text and directions to the press. His editorial duties were discharged with exemplary thoroughness, and his work throughout shows that he was thinking not only of the accuracy but also of the visual effect of the publication. These two aspects of his labors are epitomized in the interesting and unusual publisher's "blurbs" which appeared on the two parts of the volume which next followed De Prudentia from Mayr's press, the De Bello Neapolitano et De Sermone of 1509. On the last verso of the first section of this book, completed in May, are the words, "Mira orthographiae ratione impressum," and on the last verso of part 2, finished in August, "Rara impressionis elegantia." Each of these phrases appears alone on its page, where it would be exposed to tempt the buyer as the unbound sheets lay in the bookseller's shop. No one can doubt what Summonte considered to be the strongest points of the publications. Some, if not most, of the minor alterations of single letters in the text are the editor's. At least one long interpolation, that at the foot of 128 b , is in his handwriting. He inserted the formal headings of Books II-V inclusive (that of the first book is in the scribe's hand), and indicated the form the headlines were to take in the printed volume. Fols. 1-11 have in his hand at the top of the versos "DE PRV." (see fig. 1) and at the top of the rectos "LIB. I." After fol. 11, he contented himself with merely writing the book-number on all rectos, usually in both arabic and roman numerals (see figs. 2, 3). The latter evidently represent second thoughts, as the printed book uses roman numerals. It also follows throughout the exact style of abbreviated headline prescribed in the early pages of the manuscript. Summonte was also responsible for the rectification of one major disarrangement of the text in this manuscript, where the order of certain sections of Book V was incorrect or had been revised. A large part of Book V is taken up with brief paragraphs setting forth examples of prudentia culled from the pages of history. In the manuscript, the paragraph dealing with Hostilius is followed (109 b ) by that concerning the Roman Senate. But the final order placed there instead the paragraph on Fabius Ambustius, which occurs in the manuscript on 112 a , followed in turn by the next five sections in order, running to the middle of 118 a . The new arrangement then returns to the paragraph on the Senate and runs on through the two following sections, which complete the rearrangement; the text then skips back to 118 a and takes up the remaining sections to the end of the book in the order in which they appear in the manuscript. The text affected by this change appears in the published book on sigs. g5 v -h1 r . Summonte's method of indicating the changed order was very simple. In the margin at the beginning of each of the sections he placed an encircled capital letter, the alphabetical order showing the proper position of each in the rearrangement. (These index letters are printed without their circles in the ensuing discussion.) The section on the Senate is thus lettered G. In the margin above the G is an encircled A preceded by the section-mark, §, indicating to the compositor that he was to seek the section so marked. The section on Fabius Ambustius, of course, bears the letter A. At the end of the section F, on 118 a , is the marginal note, "quaere hanc litteram G et pone omnes per ordinem usque ad I." The short paragraphs of Book V also show an editorial policy determined and then abandoned. The manuscript as originally written set the paragraphs down without headings. Summonte then inserted all the headings, and at last, before publication, struck them all out again (see margin in fig. 3). This may have been done either to save space, or to improve the appearance. A number of the sections occupy no more than two lines of type. Section-headings for all would have swelled the size of the book, and would also have given it a choppy and cut-up look. Besides the disarrangement in Book V, the text of the manuscript is seriously defective at two points: it lacks the prologues to Books IV and V. These were evidently supplied for the printed book from another manuscript. At the head of Book IV (82 b ) is drawn a long acute angle enclosing an encircled dot, to indicate an insertion. At the head of Book V (101 a ) is a more complicated signal, consisting of two concentric circles cut by a vertical straight line, with another straight line emerging to the right. 9 In addition there is pasted on the facing blank page a label in Summonte's hand reading, "Qua se haue da ponere lo prologo de che serra vna facciata integra poco piu o meno." The last four words appear to have been altered from "ne piu ne meno." Thus Summonte was indicating to the printer not only the existence of the interpolation, but also its probable length. In the printed book, the prologue occupies six lines more than one page (sigs. g1 r -g1 v ). In fact, if the heading of the book were eliminated, the whole prologue would fit comfortably into a single page. The altered decision on the section-headings of Book V and the estimate of the length of its prologue reflect a concern for the physical appearance of the printed book which is to be seen even more clearly in a series of directions to the printer which runs through the whole manuscript. Summonte wrote most of these on small slips of paper or labels inserted at the appropriate points; a few were simply written in the margins. They represent what must be one of the earliest attempts at book-design by a person outside the staff of the printing-office, and as such they are extraordinarily interesting. The simplest of the directions relate to the oblong space six lines deep containing only a guide-letter, which occurs at the beginning of each prologue and book in the printed work, intended for the insertion of an illuminated or pen-work initial. On fol. 4 a is the first of these, a label which reads, "Spatium pro Tonsa, secundum primum." (See fig. 4.) This is at the beginning of the text of the main part of Book I; if any direction was inserted for the beginning of the prologue, it has disappeared. At any rate, the printer was ordered to leave a space for the initial just as he had the first time. At the beginning of the prologue to Book II is simply the word "tonsa" in the margin, while at the head of the main text of Book II is the notation, "Tonsa come la prima." Thereafter only the word "tonsa" is used. 10 A second class of direction relates to the insertion of additional chapter-headings, which were written in by Summonte. Where space permitted, he inserted them in the text as they would normally have appeared; where there was not enough space, he indicated their proper point of insertion in the text with a gallows-like paragraph mark, repeated in the margin with the heading following it. The label pasted at the foot of fol. 72 a (fig. 2) is the earliest and most detailed of the directions dealing with this circumstance: "Questa é rubrica et pero farite qua capitulo." 11 Simpler labels to this effect were pasted on fols. 73 a and 73 b , after which a number of insertions were permitted to pass without comment; but when another insertion was made somewhat later, Summonte felt it wise to be specific again, and a label on fol. 122 a reads, "fate capitulo et cosi farete in li altri conveneno appresso" (fig. 3). Even more directly concerned with the design are the labels intended by Summonte to indicate differences in layout between manuscript and printed book. In the manuscript the prologue to Book II ends with a blank space of nearly half a page; here Summonte wrote, "vna riga vacua in mezo." Unfortunately in this case good typography forbade the following of the instruction, for the prologue ended only seven lines short of a full page (sig. c4 r ). Leaving one line blank would have allowed only the six lines necessary for the "tonsa" at the beginning of the main text of Book II, with a totally unacceptable visual effect. Very wisely Summonte's direction was countermanded or ignored; the manuscript contains no further mark to indicate which. But Summonte's other instructions of this kind were carried out as nearly as possible by the printer. The last section of Book II has no heading, and in the manuscript (fol. 56 a ) it is set off from the preceding section by a blank line. Summonte inserted a label reading, "la ultima riga sia meza o poco piu ó manco di meza / et lo capitulo che seguita non habia da sú riga vacua ma siano continuate le righe." In the printed book (sig. d3 v ), the preceding section ends with a little more than half a line of type. The last section follows immediately in the next line, only being indicated in the usual fashion by having its initial letter set out in the left margin. Very similar labels appear in similar circumstances on fols. 69 a and 122 a (fig. 3), and both are likewise carried out in print. Finally, on fols. 100 b and 130 b appear instructions to leave a blank line in the text, also carried out in print. Summonte's attentions to the manuscript thus ranged from the purely textual to the purely typographical, and his concern is clearly perceptible in the resulting publication. The collation of a few pages of the book with the manuscript is sufficient to show how faithfully the text was followed, and its continued close scrutiny is shown by the lengthy and minute list of errata, embodying sixty corrections, on sig. m7 v . The book is also excellent typographically, with its pages well proportioned and crisply printed. And one of the governing principles of design running throughout is that expressed in the most detailed of Summonte's labels. A definite effort was made to end every section with a half-line "poco piu o manco," and there are in fact only two of the many sections of De Prudentia which end with a full line of type, and only eight or ten others that come close to doing so. On the evidence of the labels, then, it seems reasonable to give Summonte credit for a very large share of the book's design. The marks made in the manuscript by the printer were, as one might expect, on a severely practical level. First of all, he cast off the copy to determine how many pages of print it would occupy. Probably by experiment he found that forty-nine lines of manuscript produced about one page (forty-two lines) of printing; so one of his first acts was to mark the manuscript every seventh line, that being the common denominator of these two figures. Some of this marking was done in pencil, but most with a very light pen-stroke, usually in the left margin. The entire manuscript, with very few exceptions, was so marked; in a few instances, the unit of measurement was eight lines, but these seem to represent mistakes. The rubricated section-headings were counted as normal lines. The manuscript was also marked to show the division into pages of type. The exact point where it was divided was indicated within the line by the step-like mark of division commonly used by printers, and in the margin was written the number of the page within the particular quire which began at that point. Thus, the beginning of the text of sig. d1 r in the printed book is marked in the manuscript, "D.p a .1."; d1 v is marked "2"; d2 r is "3"; and so on. The signature-letter is given for only the first page of each quire. Some of these marks appear to represent experimental casting-off or else trial settings, where as many as three divisions appear for each page. In these cases, all but the mark for the eventual division are deleted by crossing out. In fig. 2, the cancelled division-mark is opposite the numeral 6; the true division-mark is about a line later, a smaller T-shaped mark. In the printed book this is the division between e3 r and e3 v (the beginning of the sixth page of quire e). Lightly but crudely pencilled numerals appear in the margins against the section headings in the first dozen leaves of the manuscript. The number 25 preceding "De Fortuna" in fig. 1 is an example. These relate to one series of the cancelled division-marks, and indicate the number of lines of manuscript between the proposed page-beginning and the heading. They may probably be taken as evidence of typographical experiment at the start of composition. After this initial period of experiment, the manuscript was evidently cast off in pages; then when composition was in process the actual points at which pages began were also indicated in the manuscript where they differed from the estimated divisions. Estimated and actual page-beginnings generally came very close to agreement, differing only by a word or two in most cases, and seldom by more than a line of type. The printer's method, then, appears to have been to establish a working ratio between manuscript and book, next to cast off the text on that basis, and finally to record the actual progress of typesetting as the work went forward. One other mark appears in the manuscript, and it very probably has nothing to do with either the editing or the printing of it. This is the word "breue" which appears nine times in the margins of Book V, in a hand which I cannot identify. There is no unusual effort at compression of text in either manuscript or printed book at these points, and there seems to be no ready explanation of the appearance of the word there. Possibly it is an indication by some unknown reader of the manuscript that certain portions of the text were to be summarized for his notes. The printed text contains, in fact, more abbreviations throughout than the manuscript, and within the printed book the amount of abbreviation varies widely from page to page; in some portions there are only one or two abbreviations to the line, in others as many as five or six to the line. It is evident that as usual the compositor followed his own whim and the requirements of justification in employing abbreviations; there is no observable relation to the manuscript in this respect. Otherwise, he followed the manuscript very faithfully, regarding in particular the changes in orthography and capitalization which had been made in it. He also followed its punctuation exactly, with one major change. The most common mark of punctuation in the manuscript was the slant or virgule, and this apparently was not in his roman fount, so it is everywhere replaced by the colon—not, perhaps, a happy choice, as it tends to break up the type-page. We have, then, in the British Museum manuscript of De Prudentia , a good example of scholarly editor and scholarly printer working harmoniously together to produce an edition not only meticulously edited but also carefully designed—certainly a very early instance of such a partnership.</field>

Pal. 3413, fol. 305 a -418 a . 6 Caracciolo and Puderico were the dedicatees of Pontanus's work. 7 Actius Sincerus was the sobriquet bestowed on Sannazaro by Pontanus, in accordance with the custom of the Accademia. Thus Pontanus had also given himself a middle name, Jovianus. 8 Bound in at the beginning of Add. MS. 12,027 is a modern manuscript in French containing fourteen leaves (two are blank), signed "E. Audin" and dated "Florence, 30 November 1821." In it Audin discusses the manuscript and attempts to relate it to the printed editions known to him. Unfortunately, the undated edition actually printed from the manuscript was not among these, and consequently much of Audin's speculation is without foundation. 9 Similar markings are used at several other points in the manuscript to indicate shorter insertions. 10 Tonsa is an abbreviation for littera tonsa ( lettera tonda, lettre tondue ). In the thirteenth century litterae tonsae meant a perpendicular and elongated alphabet, derived in part from capitals and uncials and in part from minuscules, used for the headings of papal bulls and to signalize letters or words supplied in copies of earlier documents to fill lacunae ; see L. Delisle, "Les 'Litterae Tonsae' à la Chancellerie romaine au XIII e Siècle," Bibliothèque de l'École des Chartes , LXII (1901), 256-263. I am indebted to Mr. Stanley Morison for this reference. But to the humanist scribes and their followers, litterae tonsae came to mean the upright roman script as differentiated from the cursive. Thus at the end of the sixteenth century the writing-master Marc'Antonio Rossi ( Giardino de Scrittore , Rome, 1598) explains that his lettera antica tonda derives from the ancient Roman majuscule (plate 80), and proceeds to give nine plates of specimens of various sizes. Evidently the phrase meant the same a century earlier, and Summonte's direction referred to a roman capital to be inserted in the manner customary in early books. 11 Here and elsewhere in quoting these annotations, abbreviations are silently expanded.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">New Light on the King's Printing Office, 1680-1730 by Robert L. Haig</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The history of the King's Printing Office and its patentees from the accession of James I to the beginning of the eighteenth century was set forth in some detail by Henry R. Plomer more than fifty years ago. More recently, Mr. A. F. Johnson has supplemented Plomer's account for the period following the Restoration and has carried the history of the patent down to the year 1742. 1 The main outlines of the patent history are now clear, but details must be added as they are brought to light. For example, the names of some shareholders in the office, designated in imprints only as "the assigns of" an original patentee, are still unknown. Johnson cites a record of payment for official printing made in 1694 to a "Richard Hutchenson," but reports: "Of this Hutchenson I can find nothing more." 2 The incidence of such names, not known to have been connected with the patent, requires explanation. More significantly, the date at which John Baskett acquired an interest in the office remains uncertain, and the circumstances under which his interest was obtained are completely obscure. The purpose of this paper is to offer solutions for a few of the problems raised by earlier accounts, and to supply a body of new information relative to the King's Printing Office during the half-century from 1680 to 1730. It is based principally upon Chancery documents in the Public Record office which have not previously been cited.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I In January, 1680, the printing patent originally granted by James I to Robert Barker and then held by John Bill II and the assigns of Christopher Barker III expired. 3 At the same time, the thirty-year reversion which had been granted by Charles I in September, 1635, to Charles and Matthew Barker, the younger sons of Robert Barker, became effective. 4 The earliest imprints under the new patent contained, as had those immediately preceding, the names of John Bill, Thomas Newcombe, and Henry Hills; only the omission of Christopher Barker's name indicated that the earlier patent had expired. Thomas Newcombe, manager of the King's Printing Office since the Restoration and, with Henry Hills, titular King's Printer since 1677, is known to have acquired "a right in certain letters patent granted . . . to Charles and Matthew Barker for 30 years. . . ." 5 The continuation of the names of Henry Hills and John Bill in the imprints has not been explained, although, as A. F. Johnson observed, Bill and his heirs evidently had some share in the patent for the next thirty years. 6 Complete explanation of the 1680 imprint and the changes which occurred later requires an account of the vicissitudes through which Charles and Matthew Barker's reversion passed from the time it was granted in 1635 until 1710, the date at which it expired. Such an account has hitherto been lacking. The divisions and subdivisions of the patent reversion which took place during the forty-five year interval before it became effective were not, obviously, reflected in the imprints of the incumbent patentees; neither were they recorded in the official patent rolls. Information concerning the transfer of ownership in the reversion has existed, presumably, only in fragmentary references scattered through unsearched wills and among unrecorded indentures, many of the latter no longer extant. There is, however, a secondary source for such information which has apparently been neglected. During the final decades of the seventeenth century, and until at least the middle of the eighteenth, shareholders in the King's Printing Office found it necessary to defend their monopoly on frequent occasions by instituting proceedings in Chancery against printers, publishers, and booksellers who allegedly infringed upon the royal patent. The Bills of Complaint filed by the King's Printers in these cases are closely-written parchments, some of them exceeding five feet in length, each of which sets forth the patentees' grievance against a particular defendant. But the actual complaint, in nearly every instance, occupies a relatively small part of the unwieldy document. Almost invariably, the greater portion of each Bill of Complaint is devoted to a demonstration of the plaintiff's right to bring suit for patent infringement; and the demonstration, in every case, takes the form of a recitation of the history of each share in the patent from the time of the original grant to the date at which the suit was filed. These redactions purport to be based upon primary sources; some of them make reference to particular wills, indentures, and other relevant documents. The following account has been compiled chiefly from a group of sixteeen Bills of Complaint exhibited in Chancery by the King's Printers between 1680 and 1750. 7 Details omitted in some of the bills have been supplied, whenever possible, from others, and disagreements between bills on proper names and dates have been indicated. Little more than two years after they had been granted their thirty-year reversion in the King's Printing Office, Charles and Matthew Barker sold, for an unspecified sum, half of their interest in the reversion. The purchaser, by an agreement made early in November, 1637, was one Jane Lucas, a widow, of London. 8 This interest was later sold by Mrs. Lucas to John Bill II, King's Printer under an earlier patent. The date of the sale is not recorded in the Chancery Proceedings. In 1682, two years after the reversion had become effective, Bill's share passed to his son, Charles, whose name first appeared in the official imprints of 1686. 9 Since this moiety remained intact from 1637 until the expiration of the patent in 1710, its history is a simple one; that of the other moiety is more complex. The second division in the Barker reversion occurred on December 3, 1667, when Matthew Barker, who had survived his brother Charles, sold one-third of his remaining share (i. e., one-sixth interest in the reversion) to a Richard Brailesford of Askham, Nottinghamshire. Brailesford died sometime during the ensuing seven years, leaving his interest to his widow, Rachel, who subsequently married one William Scroop of East Retford. The Scroops' share in the reversion was purchased in 1674 by Thomas Newcombe, then manager of the Printing Office. He retained it until his death in 1681. Of Newcombe's share, more must be said later. In 1672, Matthew Barker sold his remaining two-sixths interest in the reversion to Henry Hills and George Sawbridge, who shared it equally. 10 Sawbridge's interest in the 1680-1710 patent seems never to have been made public. It was inherited in 1681 by his widow, Hannah, and at her death, apparently in 1686, 11 by their son, Thomas. In 1692, Thomas Sawbridge died intestate, and Letters of Administration for his estate were granted to Edward Brewster, a former partner in publishing of the elder Sawbridge. 12 This fact explains the occurrence of Brewster's name in the Treasury Books as a recipient of payment for official printing between 1692 and 1710, 13 but it introduces further complexities. From 1692 until 1700, Brewster held Sawbridge's share of the patent in trust. In June, 1700, this third of a half interest was subdivided into four equal shares, one of which Brewster assigned to each of the following: Sir Thomas Wheate, Baronet, of Glympton, Oxfordshire; John Little (or Littell), Esquire, of London; John Blackall (or Blackhall), Gentleman, of London; and Elizabeth Bent, a widow, of Agmondesham, Buckinghamshire. 14 By 1706, John Blackall's one twenty-fourth share had passed to his son George. The incidence of Brewster's name in the Treasury Books after 1700 presumably indicates that he continued to administer the property in the patent for Sawbridge's assigns. The one-sixth interest in the reversion purchased by Henry Hills from Matthew Barker in 1672 was retained by Hills until his death in December, 1688, or January, 1689. By his will, dated December 10, 1688, Hills ordered a division of his share into thirds. One-third of his sixth interest (i. e., one-eighteenth of the property in the patent) was to go to his widow, Elizabeth; one-third was to be shared equally by three of his sons, Gilham, James and George; the remaining third apparently went to another son, Henry Hills Jr. 15 Elizabeth Hills, one of the executors of the will, was convicted of recusancy, and Adiell Mill, the other, was declared a bankrupt, whereupon Gilham Hills was granted Letters of Administration, and Elizabeth's share in the patent was vested in him and two of his brothers, James and George. Gilham Hills now held, for himself and his brothers, two-thirds of his father's one-sixth interest in the patent; however, possibly because Henry Hills Sr. had become a Roman Catholic before his death, the name of Hills vanished from the official imprints after the Glorious Revolution. It returned only after the Barker patent expired in 1710. By an indenture of March 11, 1699, James Hills borrowed £200 on his one twenty-seventh share in the patent from Edward Darell (or Darrell), a "citizen and stationer." 16 On July 15, 1701, Darell lent James £50 more on his share, and on April 27, 1708, Gilham Hills mortgaged his one twenty-seventh to Darell for £300. In November, 1708, Darell sued in Chancery for repayment of the loans; alternatively, he requested a free title to the shares in the patent so that he might recover his money by disposing of them. In their joint answer to Darell's complaint, the brothers estimated the value of their interest in the Printing Office at "considerably more than double the sumes lent by the complaint upon the same" (£550) and denied that the value had "in any way lessened but dayly increaseth considerably." There were, they stated, "severall very considerable sumes of mony due to them from the government for printing Acts of Parliament and other things in the reign of the late King William the third and her present Majesty . . . the accounts whereof lye now before the Lord High Treasurer. . . ." With this money, they intended to repay Darell's loans. The Treasury Books for the period reveal that a warrant for £3,524 18 s. o d. was made to the Queen's Printers on July 25, 1709, in payment for printing and stationery wares supplied by them during the year preceding Michaelmas, 1708. 17 Apparently, James and Gilham Hills retained their interest in the office until the expiration of the patent six months later. I have found no record of a judgment in the case. Thomas Newcombe's acquisition of one-sixth interest in Charles and Matthew Barker's patent has already been explained, and it is known that on Newcombe's death, December 26, 1681, his share passed to his son, Thomas II. The younger Newcombe, who became titular King's Printer in 1682 and succeeded his father as manager of the office, died on March 21, 1691. 18 By his will, proved April 11, his interest went to his widow, Dorothy, with the stipulation (also contained in his father's will) that ten pounds be set aside from the annual profits of the office for the benefit of ten ancient printers or their widows. From April, 1691, to the expiration of the Barker patent in 1710, "Charles Bill and the Executrix of Thomas Newcombe" were designated in official imprints; but the imprints reflected nothing of the fortunes which befell the "executrix" and her share in the patent. Three years after the death of her husband, Dorothy Newcombe was declared to be of unsound mind. By Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Chancery dated February 19, 1694, custody of her person and property was assigned to John Williams, who had succeeded Thomas Newcombe II as manager of the King's Printing Office. 19 According to the terms of the commission, all of Dorothy's lands, tenements, goods, chattels, and money were turned over to Williams to be used for her maintenance, and Williams was to render an account of these to the Lord Chancellor. The responsibility was no small one, for Thomas Newcombe's estate was extensive, but Williams was soon relieved of it. Less than six months after the commission had been issued, Dorothy was officially declared to have recovered, being once more of sound mind and sane memory. On June 8, 1694, Williams' custodianship was revoked, and control of Dorothy Newcombe's property was restored to her. 20 Shortly after her recovery, the widow of Thomas Newcombe II was married to Richard Hutchinson, of the parish of St. Margaret, New Fish Street. Articles for the marriage were executed on May 29, 1694, more than a week before John Williams' guardianship of Dorothy Newcombe terminated. From references to the articles we learn that Dorothy's property included (besides an estate at Wandsworth, Surrey, where she resided) an interest in some houses and land near Puddle Dock, London, leased by Thomas Newcombe I from King's College, Cambridge; ownership "in fee simple" of several houses in Clinkard's Court, Westminster; and a share in other houses at "Wandsworth Hill." 21 At the date of the marriage articles, her one-sixth interest in the King's Printing Office "and stock thereof" was reported to yield an income of £200 annually, with an additional fifteen pounds being received from a share in certain houses "in the printing office yard." Her total income was estimated at £439 a year. Richard Hutchinson, who must have assumed control of Dorothy's interest in the Printing Office, 22 died intestate on August 1, 1695, the year following the marriage, leaving two sons by a former wife, Richard Jr. and George, who reached majority in the early years of the eighteenth century. The circumstances of Dorothy Hutchinson's life in the twelve years following are not recorded, but by July, 1708, she had been again declared a "lunatique," and John Williams, with one Thomas Welham of London, had as before received a royal commission for custody of her person and estate. On July 30, 1708, Williams and Welham assigned custody of the widow's person to her younger stepson, George Hutchinson, who pledged himself by a bond of £1,000 to care for her at her home in Surrey, the costs to be borne by Williams and Welham out of income from her property. 23</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II With the final transfer of Dorothy Hutchinson's share to the control of Williams and Welham, the history of Charles and Matthew Barker's patent in the King's Printing Office comes to an end. On January 10, 1710, this patent expired, and the interests of Charles Bill and the assigns of Thomas Sawbridge were terminated. The new thirty-year term, which began on the same date, had been granted by Charles II to Henry Hills and Thomas Newcombe I on December 24, 1675. 24 Its transmission to their successors had followed the pattern outlined above for their shares in the Barker grant. Early imprints under the new patent read: "The Assigns of Thomas Newcombe and Henry Hills, deceased"; in 1711 the name of John Baskett was added. Questions of the date and the circumstances surrounding the origin of Baskett's interest in the office have been raised by A. F. Johnson, who inferred correctly that Baskett purchased a share in the Newcombe-Hills patent, though he had found no document confirming this and no account of Baskett's being sworn in as King's Printer. 25 The original documents have still not come to light, but a relatively detailed account of the transactions by which Baskett became King's Printer is given in a 1715 Bill of Complaint filed by the patentees against Edward Berrington, printer of the Evening Post . 26 According to the bill, those shareholders in the patent whose terms expired in January, 1710, had intended when they withdrew from the office to "take away their part &amp; share of the printing presses letters tools &amp; other utensills &amp; stock used &amp; employed in the carrying on the business of the s d office. . . ." John Williams and Thomas Welham, described in the bill as custodians and managers "of the person and estate of . . . Dorothy Hutchinson . . . during her lunacie (which still continues)," had felt that it would be "more for the advantage of the office &amp; the s d Dorothy Hutchinson . . . to lett in another partner into the s d office who should lay down such a sume of mony as should be sufficient to purchase in the share &amp; interest of the partners and proprietors whose term was then expiring rather than suffer them to withdraw &amp; take away the same in specie. . . ." Gilham Hills, administrator of his late father's half interest in the new patent, had agreed, whereupon Williams and Welham had applied for and been granted an order in Chancery permitting them to sell a portion of Dorothy Hutchinson's share in the office to John Baskett. By an indenture dated May 20, 1710, between Williams and Welham, Gilham Hills, and Baskett, one-third of Dorothy Hutchinson's moiety was conveyed to Baskett for a sum unspecified in the Bill of Complaint. A notation among documents relating to the Newcombe-Hutchinson estate reveals that in April, 1710, the month before Baskett purchased his interest, an appraisal of the "books, paper, printing materials, additional building &amp;c." belonging to the Printing Office was made by Robert Knaplock and John Walthoe, two of the leading booksellers in London. Their valuation of the property totalled £13,812 4 s. 3¾ d. This would appear to place the value of Baskett's sixth interest at just over £2,300. 27 Continuing the account of Baskett's title to the office, the Bill of Complaint states that after his purchase, "to wit on or about the month of April [1712] . . . John Baskett by &amp; with the consent of . . . Thomas Welham John Williams and Gilham Hills &amp; for the benefitt of them &amp; the s d John Basket[t] was duly admitted &amp; sworne printer to her late Majesty Queen Anne as hath been formerly accustomed in the like cases[,] &amp; in or ab t the month of November last [1714] . . . was also duly admitted &amp; sworne printer to his p r sent Majesty King George. . . ." In February, 1718, some six years after Baskett's official appointment as King's Printer, Dorothy Newcombe Hutchinson died, having never, apparently, recovered her sanity. 28 Surviving documents indicate that John Williams and Thomas Welham still retained custody of her property at the time of her death, and they were responsible for it for several years thereafter. Among various accounts and memoranda relating to the estate which are preserved in the Public Record Office, one is of particular interest. It is a general inventory, probably compiled by John Williams, of the stock and equipment at the King's Printing Office in March and April of 1720. 29 I reproduce it here, normalizing abbreviations which cannot be reproduced in type.

Despite its promising title, it is disappointingly vague about the equipment of the printing house. Nevertheless, several features in the list of printed stock are of interest: the division between London and Oxford of octavo Bible production, for example (reflected in the imprints of the Old and New Testaments, 1718-19), and the fact that relatively inexpensive editions of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer comprised slightly more than sixty per cent (£1,151 9 s. 4½ d. ) of the total value of the stock. Impressions on fine paper of the individual Acts of Parliament were intended, perhaps, for the libraries of discriminating lawyers and the reference shelves of governmental offices. The final item in the list, the South Sea Act, must have enjoyed a substantial sale between April, 1720, and the bursting of the "Bubble" four months later. From the date of his appointment as King's Printer until the expiration of the Newcombe-Hills patent, John Baskett's name dominated the official imprints. In 1723, five years after Dorothy Newcombe Hutchinson's death, the imprints read: "Printed by John Baskett, Printer to the King's Most Excellent Majesty, And by the Assigns of Thomas Newcombe and Henry Hills, deceased." In the following year, the reference to Newcombe's assigns—probably John Williams and Thomas Welham—dropped out. While I have found no explanation for this among the Chancery records, Baskett's purchase of privileges as King's Printer in Scotland between 1711 and 1725 and his acquisition in 1715 of a thirty-year reversion upon the English patent makes it seem probable that by 1724 he had purchased the remaining two-thirds of the Newcombe moiety in the 1710-1740 patent. 30 Between 1725 and 1727 the name of Thomas Norris, described as "assignee to George Hills," was added to the imprints, but in 1728 Baskett's name is found alone. A. F. Johnson states that from 1727 until his death in 1742 Baskett's name appeared alone on publications of the King's Printing Office, 31 but I have observed that A Table of the Statutes, Publick and Private for the year 1729 was "Printed by the Assigns of His Majesty's Printer, and of Henry Hills, deceas'd," and the title-page of a quarto New Testament dated 1731 bears the same imprint. This would indicate that Baskett did not gain exclusive rights to the Newcombe-Hills patent until after 1730, if indeed he ever did. I have found among the Public Records no new information about the King's Printers during the final decade of the Newcombe-Hills patent term. When it expired in 1740, the thirty-year reversion which—partly as a result of Jonathan Swift's influence—had been granted in 1713 to Benjamin Tooke and John Barber became effective. 32 Baskett's name continued in the imprints, and it has been assumed, in the absence of documentary evidence, that he had purchased the Tooke-Barber reversion. 33 The assumption is now further substantiated by litigation of 1747 in which Thomas Baskett, John's son and successor as King's Printer, declared that the 1740-1770 patent had "become legally vested in John Baskett" by virtue of "several assignments and other good acts in the law." 34 The same Chancery suit reveals that Robert Baskett, who with Thomas inherited his father's rights to the Printing Office in 1742, assigned his moiety in the office, by an indenture of June 18, 1744, to William Mount and Thomas Page, partners in bookselling and publishing on Tower Hill. These matters, however, belong to a later chapter in the History of the King's Printing Office. That important and exacting work should one day be undertaken.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Simms's First Magazine: The Album by John C. Guilds, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the Southern Patriot and Commercial Advertiser of June 9, 1825, announced that "a Society of Young Gentlemen" was planning to publish by subscription "a Weekly Literary Miscellany to be termed The Album ," probably few Charlestonians raised their eyebrows. Magazines and newspapers came and went in Charleston, and the appearance of a prospectus was old news to the citizens of the old city. Hardly a handful of readers could have known that included among the "young gentlemen" editors was a nineteen-year-old litterateur named William G. Simms, Jr.; and certainly those informed few found their knowledge no reason for excitement. Gilmore Simms in 1825 was to them yet a nonentity; and the magazine he was to help edit attracted so little attention that its name was never mentioned by the Charleston press after the few encouraging comments inspired by its prospectus. Perhaps this early lack of interest in the Album helps to account for its strange "disappearance" for more than a century and a quarter. Simms's biographer, W.P. Trent, apparently knew nothing of its existence; Guy A. Cardwell, in an unpublished study of Charleston periodicals, dismissed it as follows: "No copies located; or, projected but probably did not appear"; 1 and William Stanley Hoole, the one writer to associate Simms's name with the Album before its recent "discovery" by Alexander S. Salley, also concluded that it "failed to materialize, perhaps because of the lack of guaranteeing subscribers" 2 —a natural assumption since no mention of its actual appearance was made by the contemporary newspapers. Not, then, until the publication of the first volume of Simms's Letters was the existence of the Album established—by the owner of its only extant file, Mr. Salley. 3 For the past decade and a half Mr. Salley has had in his Simms Collection an inconspicuous little half-leather-bound volume made up of the first twenty-six numbers of the Album —the first and perhaps the only volume of an early Charleston literary journal that has waited long and patiently for its first review. But, since the title-page of the Album does not list its editor or editors and since the contributions are either unsigned or signed with initials or pseudonyms, the fact that Simms was associated with the Album is not nearly so evident as the fact that the Album did exist. Included in the magazine's 210 pages, however, are at least twenty-six poems that later appeared in volumes of Simms's poetry, and in addition there are at least thirty-one other contributions, discussed below, which may be added to a list of his writings. That Simms's connection with the Album was closer than that of a mere contributor is indicated by his statement in a letter to James Lawson, October 15, 1841: "Prior to this [the editorship of the Charleston City Gazette , 1830-1832] however, I had more than once been engaged in editing Literary Journals. My editorial career (in letters) commenced when I was yet quite short of eighteen." 4 One wishes, however, that Simms's correspondence of 1825 were extant: none of the later letters mention by name the "Literary Journal" that he first edited. Thus, although one has proof that Simms at an early age edited a Charleston literary journal called the Album , one still is faced with the problem of showing that the magazine which Simms edited was the same magazine to which he contributed so heavily. Since external evidence is not conclusive, one must look at the Album itself for confirmation of Simms's editorial connection with it. Although evidence derived from an examination of the Album is not sufficient to prove that Simms was the only editor, it can be clearly demonstrated that he was at least one of the editorial board. In the Album for October 29, 1825, appears an essay, labelled simply "For the Album" and signed "Numpo," that obviously is the work of the editor or editors. Dreaming that he is a mouse in the "Communication Box" of the Album , "Numpo" discloses information about contributors that could be known only to someone actually engaged in reading manuscripts for the magazine. "Numpo" reveals, for instance, that "Almirez," "Wilton," "Sydney," and "Triptolemus Twig" are pseudonyms for the same person; and since poems signed "Almirez" and "Wilton" were later published under Simms's name, it cannot be doubted that the "Poet" described in the following paragraphs is Simms: The being who approached, seemed to me to bear the appearance of a Poet, and from the confidence of his air, and apparent intimacy with every cranny of the office, [it seemed] that the pages of the Album were not unfrequently the arena of his poetical exploits. I was moreover inclined to think that this wayward wight, held some seat of consequence in the wigwam, by the intimate and jocular manner in which he conversed with one of the publishers, 5 who had entered immediately after him. He immediately proceeded to empty his pockets of their varied contents, much to my surprize, as the source from whence they were taken seemed to be inexhaustible. Essays, Fragments, Odes, Epistles, Scraps, Monodies, Sketches, and other dishes of Literature, so varied that it reminded me of the numerous modes of cooking eggs in France. First came a Tale of "Robbers and Ghoules," by Sidney [ sic ], and then a multitude of Stanzas and Sonnets, by Wilton, closely followed by a "Greek Warrior's Address at Thermopylae," "The Captivee" [ sic ], and half a hundred others, by "Almirez," and now "Sketches," Essays, and a complete medley of Prose and Poetry, poured out so quickly that I was unable to decypher their different titles. I remember, however, having by a few gleams of "Moonshine," found out that "Wilton," and that reprobate potatoe thief, "Triptolemus Twig," were so nearly allied that death alone could part them. 6 The picture of Simms as one holding "some seat of consequence in the wigwam" lends irrefutable support to the belief that he was active in the editorial management of the Album . One might even hazard a guess that young Gilmore was the only editor, posing as the "Society of Young Gentlemen" in an effort to hide his identity and to win supporters for what seemed a community project. 7 Nevertheless, whether Simms was the magazine's only editor or not, the fact that he had a part in making policy and in setting standards means that any study of the Album is certain to throw light on his early development as an editor. Perhaps the best way to understand the aims of the Album is to allow its editors to speak for themselves. In the prospectus already referred to, the "Society of Young Gentlemen" self-consciously announced that "this is our first sin, our debut in the Literary world": When we declare that we have no hope or expectation of pecuniary recompense, but the desire of furthering the Literary character of our state, it is presumed that we will not be suspected of selfish views, but that proper and decided support will be given by a generous public, to a Publication, which has for its object their amusement and instruction. The ALBUM, will, with a few trifling exceptions, be totally devoted to Original matter. It will be open to every department of Science, and Literary information, and will be published as soon as 100 subscribers can be obtained. . . . The ALBUM will be published weekly, on fine medium paper, and will consist of eight large octavo pages. . . . 8 That some Charlestonians were sympathetic and quick to encourage the efforts of these literary-minded young men is indicated by two letters that appeared in the Southern Patriot and the Courier , respectively, almost immediately after the publication of the prospectus. Addressing himself to the editor of the Patriot , "Candidus" remarked, "I have long thought that for the credit of our city, and the improvement of taste, particularly of the younger part of our community, a publication like the one announced was much to be desired." 9 A few days later an urgent appeal for the public support of the Album appeared in the Courier , again in the form of a letter to the editor. The writer, who styled himself "A.B.C.," asserted that "If anything were wanting to induce us to patronize the work in question, the sole consideration of those to whom its superintendance [ sic ] is committed, would prompt us to promote their ends." Because the Album's editors were " young Charlestonians, not excited by any sordid or pecuniary view, but urged by the laudable and honorable motive" of establishing in their native city a literary periodical which "will be of an advantage to the rising generation," the "liberal public" owed the projected work its support. "A.B.C." emphasized that the Album would be devoted largely to "such original matter, as may be sent to their [ sic ] columns by those at home," and added that he had "every reason to believe" that the journal would be "well-conducted." 10 The writer of this long letter seems so thoroughly familiar with the aims and plans of the yet unpublished Album that one wonders if "A.B.C." was not somebody among the "Society of Young Gentlemen"—perhaps Simms. 11 At any rate, in view of the publicity the Album received before publication, it is strange that apparently not a word was written in notice of the first number, issued on Saturday, July 2, 1825. Even if it was published without the "100 subscribers" asked for in the prospectus, the new journal obviously had at least limited backing; and in the October 22 number its editors (assuming that there was more than one) assured it readers that "our form will, at the commencement of the second volume, be considerably enlarged and otherwise materially improved" 12 —a statement which suggests high hopes if not prosperity. An announcement in the issue for August 27, however, had indicated that some subscribers had been "neglectful" in the "prompt payment of their subscriptions" 13 —a bad omen. Nevertheless, with the completion of the first volume, the editors, "grateful for the encouragement" their journal had received, again proposed to issue it "in a more enlarged form." 14 If the second volume ever materialized, however, it has escaped notice. 15</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II It has been noted that the Album was "with a few trifling exceptions, [to] be totally devoted to Original matter," and that it was to be "open to every department of Science, and Literary information." As "A.B.C." had predicted, this small miscellany, unlike most of the literary journals of its day, did not depend upon translations or excerpts from foreign authors to fill its pages; it apparently relied upon "original matter" written by local citizens exclusively for the Album . The common practice of using pen names or initials makes the identification of contributors difficult, but "Caroliniensis," "Juan," "Mortimer," and "Florio," for instance, appear in the Charleston newspapers as well as in the Album . Simms, like other contributors to his magazine, also found time to write for the newspapers; a check through the Courier alone revealed some ten or twelve poems signed by his pseudonyms. 16 In make-up the twenty-six issues of the Album do not vary much. The "eight large octavo pages" of each number usually contain an installment of a continued story, one or two essays or sketches in the Spectator tradition, four or five short poems, and perhaps a book review and a complete story, more often than not with an "exotic" setting. Although the prospectus claimed scientific as well as literary interests, the Album is actually entirely literary, there being not a truly "scientific" article in the volume. 17 In this respect—and in the even more surprising respect that it completely ignores politics—the Album is a rarity among early Southern periodicals. "A.B.C." had "surmised" that the Album would be modeled upon the "Ladies' Literary Gazette, of New-York" 18 —by which he unquestionably meant the New-York Mirror , and Ladies' Literary Gazette , then edited and published by George Pope Morris. And once again that conjecture proved to be remarkably accurate: both the Mirror and the Album were eight-page weeklies "of a very miscellaneous nature," 19 although the Mirror's pages were of quarto size. Both emphasized the American character of their work; both scorned everything political; and both made a definite bid for women readers. The Album (as its name suggests) was in many ways a "ladies' gazette"—its pages abound with "Epistles to the Ladies" and with sentimental poems, stories, and essays designed to make the female heart flutter. In rejecting a contribution by "Malvina" in the third number, the editors made a statement implying that the Album's reading audience was composed largely of women: ". . . however we may ourselves wish to oblige the Ladies, we must still remember that we serve the Ladies." 20 Another indication of the importance of women in the eyes of the editors is the relatively large amount of space given to a controversy over woman's station in life. 21 A periodical of exclusively literary interests nearly always experiences financial difficulty; the young editors' statement that they expected no "pecuniary recompense" indicates their realization of this truth and underlines the sincerity of their "desire of furthering the Literary character" of their state. Exactly how much the Album was able to accomplish was of course restricted to the amount of interest and support given it by the city of its origin. And in view of the fact that the Album was admittedly a literary miscellany in a political-minded section, was edited by inexperienced hands, and lacked even the attraction of European reprints or translations, 22 it seems surprising that it survived for as long as six months. The editors evidently had an overabundance of material for their opening number, 23 and in the second they tried to establish a criterion for contributors in a notice "To Correspondents." "Orlando," for example, was told that he "is too trite" and that the "want of interest in his communication prevents its insertion." Another correspondent, "M.G.A.," was found "inadmissible" because he "has not been sufficiently careful" in the exercise of judgment; ". . . a laxity on our part," the editors concluded, "would only tend to make him more careless." 24 Apparently the editorial staff of the Album recognized the importance of maintaining critical standards, for such comments as these appear rather frequently in the early numbers. On one occasion, after making some cynical remarks about the "rage for Poetry," the audacious young editors tactlessly offered advice to potential writers of poetry for the Album . "Let the example he [the would-be poet] takes as a model," the editorial reads, "be a great one—and let him follow, not imitate. Never be content with the bare symphony of sweet sound, but even sacrifice ear to nerve. . . ." In conclusion the editors stated that these "remarks are intended for a considerable number of our metrical correspondents, who are particularly averse as well to reason as rule, and are satisfied by merely stringing rhymes together. . . ." 25 Such cocksureness did not endear the journal to all its correspondents. In an editorial entitled "Ourselves" in the August 20, 1825, number, the editors disclosed that their policy was bitterly resented by some of the authors whose offerings had been rejected: . . . we have now discovered that there are other concomitants to Editorship besides the matter to fill our pages. . . . In the first place, patience in enduring the squibs of irritable authors, who reposing unbounded confidence in their own powers of intellect, tax, in our rejection of their effusions, both our judgment and our candor. In the second place, a certain obstinacy of disposition is necessary, which in some measure entitles us to the characteristic of prejudice, when we are really least so. And in the third place, endurance of the numerous gratuitous opinions of friends , whose judgments are unerring, and who all differ. The "Young Gentlemen" then took to task one "Vernon," a correspondent who evidently had belligerently protested when his contribution had been refused. "If, in the rejection of his verses of which he so virulently complains," the editors wrote, "he concieves [ sic ] that we have acted with any discriminate favor, he is at liberty to submit his effusion to the public eye through any other vehicle; it shall not disgrace ours." 26 After this untactful blast at vain would-be contributors, the Album apparently was willing to let its case rest, usually refraining from editorial comment in the later numbers. Perhaps this reduction in criticism of rejected articles simply means a decrease in the number of contributions; certainly it does not indicate a significant change in policy, for the editors on occasion still ridiculed the attempts of certain of their correspondents. In the November 19 issue, for instance, a brief critical notice—seemingly an imitation of Jeffrey's "slashing" humor—reads in part: ". . . we cannot publish EVERY THING; we are conscious already of having admitted much more, than our sober judgment could recommend or approve." 27 Even the admission that too many inferior pieces had already been accepted confirms the belief that the Album had not (intentionally, at least) lowered its standards. One reason, perhaps, why the editors could afford to use some kind of measuring stick on the offerings of their correspondents is that they filled a large portion of their periodical with their own writings. Depending as it did upon untried editors and correspondents, the Album of course contains little of real literary worth, but there is no decline in general merit in the later issues. The truth seems to be that the "Young Gentlemen" remained steadfast in their efforts to encourage the best literary efforts of their fellow South Carolinians, and when these efforts were particularly futile, they did not scruple to reject them, even at the cost of writing last-minute fillers themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III The student of American literature is interested in the Album primarily because it contains some of the first published writings of an important literary figure. Most of Simms's contributions are no better than what would be expected from the pen of an inexperienced young author steeped in Scott and Byron; but occasionally there is a flash of vigor and gusto that anticipates the work of the mature Simms. Already apparent are his ability to tell a story and his diffuse style. It is impossible to determine exactly how much of the Album is Simms's handiwork, but probably he wrote considerably more than the fifty-six items that can be definitely ascribed to him. These contributions consist of forty-four poems, four reviews, and eight works of fiction of varying length. There can be little doubt as to Simms's authorship of the forty-four poems: all are signed with pseudonyms proved to be his and (as has been stated) twenty-five were later republished in volumes of his poetry. The four book reviews and a series of three "sketches" appear under common pen names of Simms—"G." and "S.," respectively. The other fictional items—at least two of which are best classified as novelettes—bear five different noms de plume: "E—," "P.," "Sydney," and "Triptolemus Twig." 28 The poems by Simms in the Album are signed with six pseudonyms: "Almirez," "Wilton," "Florio," "S.G.W.," "M.E.S.," "T.G.," and "G." As a whole, these selections are not distinguished poetry, but they represent the best to appear in the Album , and several of them ("The Captive," "The Miniature," "Shadows," "Come seek the ocean's depths with me," and "Ruins") are almost as good as any that Simms ever wrote. It is perhaps significant that Simms republished all but three of the poems signed "Almirez," which at the time was apparently his favorite nom de plume. The book reviews are notable chiefly for their independence and fairmindedness; 29 the young critic seems already to have realized that if his opinions were to be of value they must be independently formed, and that if his critical writings were to possess merit, they must attempt to analyze both virtues and defects, without compromising his own standards of excellence and without regard to the author's reputation or popularity. Although the five reviews are largely devoted to synopses of the books involved, either in his introductory or in his closing remarks Simms attempted an estimate of the book as a piece of literature. Perhaps the best of the reviews is "The Christian Indian," which combines a pleasing style with some critical acumen. The three "Sketches," 30 which in reality are a connected series of brief tales, are marred by the sentimentality and the gloomy sensationalism that mark the excesses of the Romantic movement. They are good examples of the misguided zeal of the inexperienced writer under the spell of Byron and the Gothic novelists. Simms was later to learn that his forte was the "realistic" depiction of the historical events of his own state, not the portrayal of strange scenes in foreign or nameless lands. The best that can be said for these sketches is that they make easy, pleasant reading in the popular fashion of their day. 31 Two other of Simms's contributions to the Album , "Country Comforts" and "The Return," might also best be labelled "sketches" rather than short stories. Each revolves about a single humorous incident. Although the intended humor of "Country Comforts" is not altogether successful, the piece is an interesting attempt to record the manners, the dialect, and the customs observed at a country inn. "The Return" has to do with the oversolicitous gentleman who is given a tweak of the nose as reward for his efforts to rescue his young lover-friend from the kisses of a beautiful maiden. 32 Simms's authorship of "The Vision," a fanciful short story of the pursuit of happiness, is established by "Numpo" in the article already referred to. "Numpo's" essay not only gives clear evidence that Simms was one of the editors of the Album ; it also establishes several new pen names for Simms and—more important—reveals that his contributions were both varied and prolific. Although no names are given, as has been already demonstrated the essay is helpful in that it lumps together unsigned articles and articles signed with various pseudonyms as coming from the same person. For example, the following paragraph identifies the author of "The Corsair," signed "G.," and the author of "The Vision," signed "T.G.," as one and the same: The person who now approached, was tall in his figure, and his dejected countenance, which seemed expressive of settled melancholy, while it interested the eye, also elicited the sympathy of the beholder. I soon discovered him to be the pensive dreamer of the battery, and could hardly reconcile in the author of "The Vision," the "Corsair" of a former Album . 33 Since "G." is an established nom de plume of Simms, "T.G." can be added to the long list of his pseudonyms, and "The Vision" and a poem entitled "Lafayette's Farewel[l] Stanzas" added to his canon. "Numpo" also confirms Simms's authorship of the two novelettes published serially, "The Robber—an Eastern Tale" and "Moonshine." "The Robber," signed "Sydney," appeared as the featured work of fiction in the first seven numbers of the Album ; it is another Gothic tale of terror, equipped with a villainous protagonist, an innocent heroine, gloomy caves with secret passages, a flesh-devouring ghoul, and fierce voracious birds. It anticipates in a way "The Confessions of a Murderer," which in turn became the basis for Martin Faber (1833). 34 The second short story or novelette, "Moonshine," appearing under the pseudonym "Triptolemus Twig," begins in the number before "The Robber" terminates, and continues through twelve more installments. Even without "Numpo's" confirmation, there is enough internal evidence to convince one of Simms's authorship. Although the tale lacks unity, and its author changes his design after it is well under way, 35 "Moonshine" appears almost unmistakably to be a forerunner of the first of Simms's "Revolutionary Romances," The Partisan (1835). "Moonshine" is laid in South Carolina just before the outbreak of the Revolutionary War and, like the novel, has as one of its leading characters a Colonel Walton, who is a British sympathizer at the beginning of the "rebellion" and the widowed father of the beautiful and charming heroine—Charlotte in "Moonshine," Katherine in The Partisan . In each case the heroine has a sympathetic maiden aunt and—more important—loves a partisan leader in General Marion's army. To carry the striking similarities even further, in both the story and the novel a decisive battle is fought near Colonel Walton's plantation. "Numpo's" awe at the number and the variety of contributions pulled from the pockets of the productive "Poet" tempts speculation as to what other "dishes of Literature" may have been written by Simms. The quotation immediately preceding Chapter IX of "Moonshine" offers a clue: "Forward yet not advanced; the weary frame "Quails at the task, imposed upon itself." Myself. The signature "Myself" immediately arouses curiosity: could Simms be quoting himself? Perhaps Simms, like Scott, made up quotations for mottoes when he could not find anything suitable in the works of other poets. There is a poem in the Album signed "Myself," but the quotation is not from it. Included also are four essays by "Myself," one of which reads very much like the work of an editor of the Album : If I have even an imperfect idea of the labours of an Editor, his situation must indeed be critical, when the time approaches for making up the form of his paper, and he finds there is still much matter wanted before it can be completed; then is he obliged to write in compulsion; and not unfrequently at such times may he find himself involved in a sad dilemma for a subject, and although a person in his circumstances should ever have his wits about him, yet would it me no more than charitable to make all due allowance, recollecting that a man cannot at all times speak from the soul, as when the spirit moves. 36 Admittedly, these five pieces cannot be safely assigned to Simms on the basis of this slight evidence; since it has been demonstrated, however, that he contributed heavily to the Album, even faint clues should not be overlooked. And if one accepts internal or circumstantial evidence, at least nine other works (excluding "Numpo's" essay) can be added to the list of probable contributions by Simms. These nine pieces consist of two brief poems and an essay by "M."; two poems by "Edwin"; a "tale" by "Amirald"; a sketch by "Jeremiah Birdeye"; and two unsigned editorials. "M." is thought to be Simms because he used that pseudonym in 1828-1829 and again in 1845; 37 one of the poems by "Edwin," "Song" (beginning "Ah! say not, say not, love is sweet"), is similar to "Say'st Thou That Love is Sweet?" included in Areytos ; or , Songs of the South (1846); "Zamor and Zuelieme—An Arabiam [ sic ] Tale" by "Amirald," written in a style characteristic of Simms, has the exotic setting, the beautiful heroine, and the dashing hero favored by him at this early period. It is also worth noting that "Zuelieme" (with a slightly modified spelling) appears again in Simms's work as the heroine in The Cassique of Kiawah (1859). "Not At Home" by "Jeremiah Birdeye," a sketch consisting of the conversations among members of the "club of Choice Spirits" in Charleston, is an attempt at the Spectator and Blackwood's "Noctes Ambrosianae" idea that he was to try again in the Cosmopolitan (1833) and to think of trying in the Southern and Western Monthly Magazine and Review (1845). 38 "Not At Home" contains some of the salty humor and vigor characteristic of Simms at his best. The two unsigned editorials, almost unmistakably by Simms, are mentioned elsewhere. 39 For want of evidence one cannot say definitely, but the possibility exists that most of the Album was written by Simms. In summary, then—whether or not one accepts the doubtful assignments mentioned above—it has been shown that Simms actively engaged in writing for the Album as well as in directing its editorial policy. Though crude in themselves, his contributions represent the spade work for some of his best poems and for at least one of his major novels. The experience of serving as an editor of the Album must have been invaluable to him, for it gave him not only an organ for the publication of his own juvenilia (and one suspects that this was not a minor attraction to the young editor), but also an opportunity to formulate a policy for his future, larger-scale editorial ventures. Already he had learned to strike out boldly and fearlessly as a critic; and already he had hit what was to be the keynote of his career as a magazine editor: the advancement of Southern literature.</field>

I am indebted to Mr. Salley for the use of his Simms library, including the Album , and to Professor Eaves for his advice in the preparation of this article. For a study of Simms's editorship of the Album and four other magazines, see J. C. Guilds, Jr., "Simms as a Magazine Editor, 1825-1845: With Special Reference to his Contributions" (Duke University Ph.D. thesis, 1954). 4 Letters , I, 283. One other "Literary Journal" that Simms edited before 1830 is the Southern Literary Gazette , 1828-1829. Simms's statement that he began his editorial career at "quite short of eighteen" suggests (1) that he may have edited yet another journal of earlier date than the Album , or (2) that he was predating the Album —a mistake common enough among authors reflecting upon their youthful work. I have searched the Charleston newspapers of 1822-1823 without finding a clue to a magazine Simms might possibly have edited. Simms himself gave conflicting evidence; on October 16, 1841, he wrote to Lawson: "When I was 18 I commenced editing, and continued to do so until I was 23—either in literary or political journals" ( Letters , I, 285)—which seems his most accurate statement; yet Evert A. Duyckinck quotes Simms as saying, ". . . at seventeen I was editing a juvenile periodical . . ." ( National Portrait Gallery of Eminent Americans , 2nd ed., New York [1867?], I, 514). 5 The publishers of the Album were Gray &amp; Ellis, No. 9 Broad Street. 6 Album , I, 138-139. There is reason to believe that Simms is "Numpo." "Wigwam" as used in the first paragraph was a favorite expression with him. For example, see his letter of April 6, 1843, to James Lawson, Letters , I, 346. 7 William Stanley Hoole, who believed the Album never materialized, stated in his unpublished Duke University dissertation (1934): "I have a strong feeling that Simms and others under the guidance of the elder Timrod had an interest in the proposed Album . . ." ("The Literary and Cultural Background of Charleston, 1830-1860," p. 307n.). Simms later spoke highly of William Henry Timrod (see "Early Writers of South Carolina," XIX Century , II [February, 1870], 695-696). If there were other editors of the Album , however, it seems more probable that they were young men of Simms's age. For Simms's description of the activities of "a host of juvenile writers" in Charleston in the early 1820's, see "Reminiscences of South Carolina," XIX Century , II (May, 1870), 920-924. 8 Southern Patriot and Commercial Advertiser , June 9, 1825. The following "Terms to Subscribers" were announced: "25 cents monthly, Payable on receiving the first Number of each Month." 9 Ibid. , June 11, 1825. 10 Courier , June 15, 1825. 11 "A.B.C." closed his letters by suggesting "as a motto for your Album , the celebrated saying of SYMS. Discipulis [ sic ] est prioris , posterior dies ." The quotation is from Publilius Syrus, a writer of Latin Mimes of about 44 B.C. The printing of "Syms" for "Syrus" probably is simply an amusing typographical error, but the possibility exists that it is a play upon Simms's name. In addition to whatever interest these letters might have aroused, the "Prospectus" appeared consistently in the Southern Patriot (sometimes on the front page) from June 9 to July 21, 1825. 12 Album , I, 136. 13 Ibid. , I, 72. 14 Ibid. , I (December 24, 1825), 210. 15 It seems probable that at least the first number of the second volume was issued. Informing their subscribers of the method of payment for the new volume, the editors wrote in the December 24 issue: "Our first number of the Second Volume, with a Subscription Book, will be sent to our Patrons, who may be disposed to continue on the same terms" ( ibid. ). A search of the Charleston newspapers of 1826 revealed no mention of the Album . 16 Poems by "S.G.W.," "Delta," "Musaeus," and "P." appear in the Courier of 1825. 17 Perhaps "science" as used in the prospectus means knowledge or learning, the sense in which the word was frequently used by Jefferson in his letters. 18 Courier , June 15, 1825. 19 Frank Luther Mott, A History of American Magazines, 1741-1850 (New York and London, 1930), p. 321. The Mirror had first been issued on August 2, 1823, with Samuel Woodworth as editor and Morris as publisher. Morris took over both jobs in 1824. 20 Album , I (July 16, 1825), 24. 21 See the following essays in the Album : "On Women" by "Z.," p. 102; "For the Album" by "A.," pp. 118-119; "Idle Hours" by "W.A.," pp. 146-148; "For the Album" by "Common Sense," pp. 163-164; "For the Album" by "W.A.," pp. 173-174; "For the Album" by "Common Sense," pp. 179-180; and "For the Album" by "Richard Threadlace," pp. 187-189. Later, as editor of the Magnolia and the Southern and Western Monthly Magazine and Review , Simms was to have little use for sentimental literature written for women readers. 22 The exception to prove the rule is the "Translation from the Spanish, of Mr. Letamondi's Opinion on the Education of Women ," which appeared in four installments beginning October 15, 1825. 23 See Album , I (July 2, 1825), 8. 24 Ibid. , I (July 9, 1825), 16. 25 Ibid. , I (July 30, 1825), 39-40. 26 Ibid. , I, 61-62. 27 Ibid. , I, 170.

Simms is probably the author. 28 See Appendix for a list of Simms's writings in the Album . Of Simms's pseudonyms mentioned in this essay, only "S." has hitherto been attributed to him. See J. Allen Morris, "The Stories of William Gilmore Simms," American Literature , XIV (March, 1942), 28n. 29 The books reviewed are The Leper of Aost , author and date of publication unknown; The Christian Indian ; or, Times of the First Settlers (New York, 1825), author unknown; James McHenry, The Pleasures of Friendship : A Poem in Two Parts (Philadelphia, 1825); and George Houston, ed., National Tales , 2 vols. (New York, 1825). 30 The first sketch, "First Love," appeared July 16, 1825; the second, "The Queen of May," July 3; and the third, bearing no title, July 30. 31 The Gothic strain continues, however, in those stories and novels by Simms which in a letter to Griswold he termed works of "passion &amp; imagination"— Martin Faber , Confession , Carl Werner , The Wigwam and the Cabin , and Castle Dismal . See Letters , II, 224. 32 "Country Comforts" is signed "E—," a pseudonym that Simms used again while editor of the Southern Literary Gazette in 1828-1829 and of the Southern and Western in 1845. "P.," the pen name attached to "The Return," was likewise employed by Simms in the Southern Literary Gazette . 33 Album , I (October 29, 1825), 137. If Simms is the writer, this quotation is an interesting self-portrait. 34 See "Advertisement to the Second Edition," Martin Faber , the Story of a Criminal; and other Tales , 2 vols. (New York, 1837), I, xi-xii. 35 See Album , I (September 10, 1825), 85-86. 36 "To the Reader," Album , I (October 15, 1825), 122. Contributions tentatively assigned to Simms are listed in the Appendix. 37 Both the Southern Literary Gazette and the Southern and Western contain contributions by Simms signed "M." 38 See "A Chat in the Symposium," Cosmopolitan : An Occasional , I (1833), 17-24, 41-46, 69-74; and Letters, I, 449. 39 See above, p. 176 and note 27. 1 When I have found that a contribution was republished—often with extensive revision—in another volume by Simms, I have indicated the republication in parentheses. The following is a key to the symbols used: Areytos Areytos : or , Songs of the South (1846) EL Early Lays (1827) L&amp;OP Lyrical and Other Poems (1827) PDDLC Poems Descriptive , Dramatic , Legendary and Contemplative (1853) Poems Simms's Poems , Areytos or Songs and Ballads of the South , With other Poems (1860) SLG Southern Literary Gazette , 1828-1829 SP&amp;P Southern Passages and Pictures (1839) SWMMR Southern and Western Monthly Magazine and Review , 1845 2 Many poems signed "Florio" are preserved in Simms's scrapbooks in the South Caroliniana Library of the University of South Carolina. 3 I also have reason to believe that the eight poems signed "Juan" and the three poems signed "Roderick" are by Simms. If "Juan" and "Roderick" are Simms, then the five prose contributions signed "W.A." are by him also. See Album , I, 130. 4 This list does not contain mere editorial notices.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Checklist of the Writings of John William De Forest (1826-1906) by E. R. Hagemann</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John William De Forest was born in Seymour (Humphreysville), Connecticut, on 31 March 1826. He attended private schools until ill-health forced him to depart from the United States in January, 1846, for a sojourn in the Near East where he resided with his brother, Henry, a medical missionary, in the Levant. De Forest returned to his native Connecticut in the autumn of 1847. After completing his first book, History of the Indians of Connecticut , he journeyed to Europe in the winter of 1850 and remained on the continent, living in Italy, central Europe, and France, until the spring of 1855, when he once again returned to the United States. On 5 June 1856 De Forest married Harriet Silliman Shepard, daughter of Charles Upham Shepard, professor of chemistry in the Charleston (S. C.) Medical College and Amherst College. Their only child, Louis, was born 23 February 1857. In 1859, Amherst awarded De Forest an honorary M.A. In the autumn of 1861, De Forest volunteered his services to the Army of the United States and was commissioned captain in the Twelfth Connecticut Volunteers on 1 January 1862, the unit he was to serve with for most of his Civil War service. De Forest saw combat in Louisiana from March, 1862, until 30 January 1864, and took part in the sharp and bloody attacks on Port Hudson on the Mississippi River. From August, 1864, until his discharge from federal service on 2 December 1864, De Forest served in Virginia. He was not done with military duty, however, and early in 1865, he was nominated for a captaincy in the Veteran Reserve Corps. He served for a time in Washington, D. C., then was transferred to the Freedmen's Bureau and sent to Greenville, South Carolina, where he took charge of the subdistrict, with the title of Acting Assistant Commissioner, on 1 October 1866. He remained there until 1 January 1868, when he was finally mustered out of military service. De Forest settled in New Haven and began his long, frustrating, and often disappointing career as writer. For over thirteen years, from 1868 to 1881, he published novels, short stories, essays, and poems, but gained little in the way of recognition from the reading public of the day, although he did gain some critical success. The publication of The Bloody Chasm in 1881 brought to a close this busy period in his life, and he was silent, although actively engaged, to some extent, with writing, until 1898, the year his last novel appeared. In the summer of 1884, De Forest once again went to Europe and lived in France until his return in the spring of 1886. He made at least two attempts to issue a collected edition of his works, but they came to naught. His health, always a serious problem with him, plagued him in the 1890's, and he struggled to remain alive. The vogue for historical romances which developed in the late years of the nineteenth century brought De Forest out of enforced retirement, and his A Lover's Revolt , a tale of the American Revolution, appeared in the autumn of 1898. He subsequently issued a family history in 1900 and two collections of his poems in 1901 and 1902. The end was quiet for him, and he died on 17 July 1906 in New Haven. He was buried two days later in the Grove Street cemetery. There has long been a need for a checklist of De Forest's writings, many of which, especially his short stories, are uncollected and scattered in various periodicals of his day. No foolish claim will be made that this list is exhaustive; indeed it is my hope that other scholars interested in De Forest will add to my efforts. It is just possible that his two manuscript novels, The Senator , lost while De Forest was traveling to New York in 1867, and A Daughter of Toil , written in the 1880's and rejected by Century Magazine and Harper's , will some day be found. The checklist is divided into (1) book publications, (2) periodical publications. Part III is a list of contemporary reviews. Acknowledgement should be made to Professor James H. Croushore, Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia, for his pioneer work on De Forest. His unpublished doctoral dissertation, John William De Forest ; A Biographical and Critical Study to the Year 1868 (Yale, 1944) and editions of A Volunteer's Adventures (New Haven, 1946) and A Union Officer in the Reconstruction (New Haven, 1948) are invaluable to the student of American letters.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Notes on the Unrevised Galleys of Faulkner's Sanctuary by Linton Massey *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Almost twenty five years ago Jonathan Cape and Harrison Smith published on February 9, 1931, 1 in an edition of 2219 copies, 2 a sixth novel by William Faulkner, entitled, Sanctuary . On its surface level the book appeared to be a narrative in Freudian terms of sex, sin, and depravity. 3 It was an immediate success and soon reached the best-seller list, as a grateful public, not then conditioned to the sadistic splendors yet to be unfolded by latter day Mickey Spillanes, manifested a shocked pleasure in the contemplation of young Southern womanhood in terms of corn cobs, rather than moonlight and honeysuckle. Until this moment few readers had indeed been aware of William Faulkner; now he dusted off the old stories and sold them at suitably higher prices to editors who had previously rejected them. Hollywood bought his book, and sought to place Faulkner himself under contract. He was from this moment a made man, with a secure though tempestuous reputation as a literary craftsman. That Sanctuary was in fact a work of some complexity in both structure and content did not become apparent until the Yoknapatawpha cycle had grown in magnitude and velocity; then his early novel was recognized as a key book, springing directly from Sartoris , and stretching on through the series to The Hamlet and Requiem for a Nun and A Fable. Sanctuary , so viewed, restated the myth of Beauty and the Beast, modified to assure no miraculous transfigurations; and the book surely represented a study of evil,—not the duality of good and evil, but of evil as corruption. Faulkner's characters were symbols of a materialism 4 that revolted him as profoundly as their callous brutality affected the sensibilities of his impercipient readers. Here was vileness, and the more pictorial of the seven deadly sins. Here, too, was irony: for each one who dies in Sanctuary , Tommy or Goodwin or Popeye or Red, each comes to his end for the wrong reason. Those who are abused, but do not perish, are not necessarily guilty of wrong-doing; however, this is not quite the same thing as saying they are innocent, because no one is wholly innocent in Sanctuary . Indeed, it could be said of the author, "—thou hast done much ill well," and he might not demur in this instance, if only because he has later shown that sin and suffering must be experienced if man is to be saved. This idea assuredly owed as much to Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and Hawthorne as ever it did to the simple, though perhaps not entirely orthodox, protestantism fashionable at the time in north Mississippi. Sanctuary was, however, a study in sin, not in salvation. While it was his sixth novel to be published, it was the fifth in actual order of composition. 5 When his third, Sartoris , was published by Harcourt, Brace in January, 1929, 6 two years had elapsed since the publication of its predecessor, Mosquitos ; and in the interval he had, as he later phrased it, written his guts into The Sound and the Fury , a manuscript that was taken by still another publisher who warned that the book would not sell, as indeed it did not, when it was issued in October, 1929, 6 hard upon the heels of Sartoris . In the summer of that year, 1929, Faulkner, with three commercial failures on his hands and a prospective fourth in the presses, "began to think of books in terms of possible money. I decided," he wrote later by way of explanation, "I decided I might just as well make some of it myself . . . I had been writing books for about 5 years, which got published and not bought . . . I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could imagine and wrote it in about three weeks and sent it to Smith who had done The Sound and the Fury and who wrote me immediately, 'Good God, I can't publish this. We'd both be in jail. . . .'" 7 Harrison Smith's editorial judgment may quite possibly have been unexceptionable. His dilemma was certainly acute, faced as he was on the one hand with a wish to publish an author who bore the plain touch of genius, and on the other, with a not altogether unnatural wish to escape the consequences of a professional visit by the Reverend John Sumner. Smith resolved the question by begging it: he postponed publication of Sanctuary and filed away the manuscript for the time being. Faulkner pitched into the labor of writing still another book, As I Lay Dying , in the short space of six weeks; Smith accepted it, and it was issued in October, 1930. 6 Critical acclaim had been the principal satisfaction gained from the publication of both The Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying , for neither of the small editions sold very well. Smith himself was obviously not disheartened. He had the courage at this point, in bad times and with two other novels by the same author neatly stacked on warehouse shelves, to proceed with Sanctuary . Some months previously, and despite his doubts, he had ordered the setting of type on Sanctuary beginning on May 16, 8 1930; but upon the arrival of the manuscript of As I Lay Dying , that novel was rushed to press, and work was suspended on Sanctuary with four galleys, only, set in Linotype. Since As I Lay Dying thus took precedence, it was not until November 3rd 9 that typesetting was resumed on Sanctuary ; but the job was then completed without interruption, and galleys were sent to the surprised author. "I think I had forgotten about Sanctuary ," Faulkner wrote several years later, 7 "just as you might forget about anything made for an immediate purpose, which did not come off. As I Lay Dying was published and I didn't remember the mss. of Sanctuary until Smith sent me the galleys. Then I saw that it was so terrible that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite it. I thought again, 'It might sell; maybe 10,000 of them will buy it.' So I tore the galleys down and rewrote the book. It had already been set up once, so I had to pay for the privilege of rewriting it, and trying to make out of it something which would not shame The Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying too much and I made a fair job. . . ." Now this retrospective glance by Faulkner was made some two years after the revisions just mentioned had been completed. On this occasion he waved a deprecatory hand and told how he had debased his art by writing the book for money. His pettishness at the time ignored the cynicism of the Great Cham himself, who had remarked that nobody would write at all, except for money, just as it overlooked the fact that Faulkner's early, imitative novels had been composed out of motives not too circumspect, frankly to make money and to fashion a career resembling that of Sherwood Anderson. "I liked that money," he said when Liveright gave him an advance of $200. "It seemed to me a mighty easy way to earn money." 10 It was not until Faulkner was well along into Sartoris that he realized "—writing was a mighty fine thing," that "—you could make people stand on their hind legs and cast a shadow." 11 In any event, his own dismissal of Sanctuary at that time is now rejected by responsible critics, who do nevertheless mourn the fact that Faulkner once ventured to impeach his own artistic integrity, when that attribute is in point of truth his distinguishing characteristic, his shield of honor, his white plume. Those who presume to sit cross-legged over the nativity of another man's intellectual offspring may be expected at very least to voice some opinion as to the legitimacy of the birth. But to grant or not, as one may choose, Faulkner's quick hop from Beale Street to Grub Street and back again, he began in any case the not wholly agreeable task of tearing down the galleys of Sanctuary , in mid-November, 1930. There was presumably not much time to spare. Perhaps Harrison Smith already wanted the book for publication in the following February; still, the work was soon finished, and a revised text was dispatched to Smith. In the years that succeeded, many unanswered questions arose regarding the nature, extent, and effect of those revisions. No set of the original galley proofs, from which comparisons could be drawn, was known to have survived the passage of time. Assuming that six sets had been pulled in accordance with usual practice, two sets would have been sent to the author, two would have gone to his agent, and two would have been retained by the publisher. Out of these six sets, one was torn down in the course of the rewriting and might be presumed lost in the process, or discarded by the printer; the other set might possibly remain in Faulkner's files, of the two sets sent him. Of the agent's sets, the whereabouts of one is unknown; the other forms the basis of these notes. Both of the sets once in the possession of the publisher are in existence, and their present owners have been identified. 12 Until this time, however, no preliminary examination of any set has supplied for the record even tentative answers to the teasing questions: what were the changes? How acutely did they alter the novel as first written? Presumptive evidence would indicate a drastic revision of the text. Those students of Faulkner's work who recognize the Byzantine intricacies often introduced into the action of his stories, could expect alterations centered on the structure of his book, even though they would at the same time be prepared to encounter those literary devices already his very own:— his handling of pure suspense, ironic suspense, and the dramatic emphasis to be obtained by a manipulation of the time element, along with his idiosyncrasies as to syntax, his abrupt transitions, and his deliberate procrastinations. Such students of his work would expect a meticulous revision and a thorough one. They would not be disappointed. A reference to Appendix A 13 illustrates the extent of the changes made. In terms of the galleys, this table shows how chapters were transposed, and how material was rewritten, condensed, or canceled; but it does not designate the points where new portions were inserted. Appendix B remedies this deficiency by turning matters about and viewing the published book in terms of the galleys. Both tables are, of course, complementary. Together they suggest, as well as such tables may, the lengths Faulkner was willing to go in the reconstruction of his book. They reflect the labors of a proud, sensitive, and, at this stage of his career, an almost desperate craftsman. But no tabulation can possibly reveal the character of the alterations made, nor can it disclose how profoundly the changes affected the motivation of the novel. When Faulkner first wrote Sanctuary back in that summer of 1929, his mood, it will be recalled, was one of despair: his previous novels had not sold very well, and he needed money. 14 He had written Sanctuary in a few weeks and had shipped it off to Harrison Smith. Proof sheets did not reach him until mid-November of the following year; when they arrived, he found 103 galley sheets, and a narrative as loose in structure as it was infirm in purpose. An abstract of those galleys will readily indicate both the confusion, and the necessity of an entirely new approach to the narrative. In these proofs of the story as it was first written, then, the tale opens with Horace at the jail interviewing Goodwin after his arrest for the murder of Tommy. Chapter Two establishes the incestuous nature of Horace's attachment both for his sister and his stepdaughter; and episodes out of the earlier book, Sartoris , are recalled, those relating to Horace's affair with Belle, the woman he eventually married, and those concerning his behavior at the time Narcissa decided to marry. An inadequate transition, still within this Chapter Two, reveals that Horace has deserted Belle and is walking to Jefferson, though he is thirsty enough at the moment to be looking for a spring. Horace is then detained by Popeye; he drinks a good deal of whiskey at Goodwin's; and in due course, with no dramatization of the scenes at the Frenchman Place, he reaches Jefferson. Here Horace calls on Miss Jenny and finds Narcissa in the garden with Gowan. After supper there is a long conversation between Horace, Miss Jenny, Narcissa's son, and a character out of Sartoris , Saddie, who will disappear in the printed book. There is here incorporated a long description of Miss Jenny's living room and an account of her ancestors' lives, all destined for removal in the revised version. Horace recounts his meeting with Popeye and goes on to explain why he has left his wife; thereafter, back in his hotel room he remembers Ruby and how he had watched her in the kitchen at Goodwin's, where events and scenes are now recalled in detail, even to the pocket watch Popeye had inherited from his grandfather, which contains a lock of his mother's hair in the back of the case. Horace, staying at Miss Jenny's for two days, once again gazes at the photograph of his stepdaughter, Little Belle. Later, in the ensuing action, there is a considerable amount of shuttling back and forth between Miss Jenny's and his own old house, into which he finally moves, where yet again he broods over his unhappy marriage and where he thinks about Ruby, and, inevitably, of Little Belle. On one of his trips to town he sees the crowd at the undertaker's parlor where the murdered Tommy now lies. Once more at Miss Jenny's, Horace tells her about his talk with Goodwin, who stubbornly refuses to accuse Popeye; then comes the message from Ruby and her subsequent admission that a young girl was present when the murder was committed. Not until this point has been reached in the story, on what would have been about page 85 had the galleys been reduced to page proofs, does Temple Drake make her appearance. Heretofore she has not been so much as mentioned; now she is shown returning from that dance at the University, meeting Gowan the next day, wrecking the car at the Frenchman Place, and so on, with the action stopping just as Ruby is about to serve supper. Quite unnecessarily, the scene reverts to Ruby, back in Jefferson, as she resumes her account of what went on thereafter, telling how the men came into Temple's darkened room one by one while she waited inside for them to leave so she could secrete Temple in the corn crib for the night. Again rather unnecessarily, the point of view shifts abruptly and the anonymous narrator interposes to continue the story and to relate the events leading up to the murder of Tommy and the entrance of Popeye into the corn crib. Still another quick transition allows Horace to resume his central position in the narrative, as Ruby continues and tells of her telephone call to the sheriff, of Gowan's running away, and of Temple's departure with Popeye. Horace, back at Miss Jenny's, studies Little Belle's photograph, goes to the University with his enquiries about Temple, and runs into Senator Snopes. The account of Popeye's trip to Memphis with Temple follows, along with the subsequent episodes at Miss Reba's and the comic interlude with the apprentice barbers, all without material change from the printed version. Then again Horace returns to the reader's view as he buys the news of Temple's whereabouts from Senator Snopes, moons over that photograph of Little Belle, and finally talks with Temple at Miss Reba's, before catching the train for Jefferson. Temple now makes her telephone call to Red; Popeye takes Temple to the speakeasy; Red is murdered; there is the wake and the funeral and the amusing party at Miss Reba's afterwards, when so much is learned about Red, Popeye, and Temple, all before the action reverts to Jefferson and Horace and the opening of the trial. In the courtroom Ruby and Temple each testify in turn, and Temple leaves with her father. There now appears in the galleys a letter from Horace to Narcissa, followed by Narcissa's reply. Both letters are dramatically ineffective, allow the author to evade his responsibilities by failing to provide a climax, and virtually destroy the artistic validity of the narrative. These letters wholly disappear in the published version. The first, from Horace in Kinston, says he was obliged to run away from Jefferson after Temple had testified and the jury had announced its verdict, because he had found more reality than he could stomach. He had gone back to Belle and to Little Belle; as for the case itself, it would be referred to another lawyer. Narcissa's reply is brief enough, and is almost peremptory in tone. She reports that Goodwin was removed from Jefferson on the same day Horace left. They were getting ready to lynch Goodwin, she says, so his going spared them that, at least. Then comes the concluding chapter, giving a truncated account of the false murder charge against Popeye, his trial, and execution. No mention is made of Popeye's early life, or parentage. Here, then, was the script as it lay before William Faulkner on that mid-November day of 1930, when he faced the necessity of rewriting a book that had been dashed off in an incredibly short space of time, well over a year ago. In examining those loose galley sheets today, an observer may in fancy imagine the author's dismay and concern as he turned idly through them: for here was not a wholly bad book, but one that surely revealed carelessness and disclosed a lamentable dichotomy in purpose. And in looking over the author's shoulder, such an observer might, with all the assured glow of omniscience and infallibility conferred by hindsight, presume to advance a few plausible, if entirely unauthenticated, guesses regarding the problems facing Faulkner on that notable day. For one thing, to consider the lesser faults in turn before viewing the graver imperfections, an investigation should be undertaken regarding those multiple and often inexplicable shifts in time and locale. Even allowing for a virtual magic in the manipulation of these elements, the galleys appeared to be almost crude in this respect, with their abrupt and apparently capricious changes, to say nothing of a further contribution made to disorder and general untidiness by frequent alterations in the point of view, from that of the author himself to one or another of the characters, and back again. To be sure, these were all quite unimportant technical corrections that any competent author could effect. Then, as another matter, there were the excrescences, those passages which delayed the action without serving it, such as, for instance, that episode transplanted in full bloom out of Sartoris depicting Horace's affair with Belle while she was still married to her first husband, Harry Mitchell. Conversely, there were other, new, as yet unwritten portions that should be inserted in the revised book, passages that would clarify or dramatize the action, a case in point here being the absolute necessity of portraying Horace after the trial, when he should run full tilt into a mob ready to lynch him as Goodwin's lawyer. But all such alterations, the parts to be omitted and the passages to be inserted, were mechanical, or nearly so, for any trained writer. Two questions remained, however, and the answers to them were of primary importance, since on them the book would stand or fall. Whose story is this? What does the story mean? Because these questions are inseparable, let them be examined together in the search for a single answer. In its original, unrevised form, the story is patently a Freudian study of Horace Benbow, a man who is so much the victim of his half-hidden incestuous fantasies that he has no will of his own, cannot act, and possesses no courage. He was a minor figure in Sartoris , here enlarged into the shadow of a man and magnified as the protagonist. About him the story swirls, as he moves dreamily through it with all his tiresome obsessions and preoccupations, with his furtive and futile love for both sister and stepdaughter, with his ambivalence toward the mother-substitute whom he has married. So ineffectual a hero, acting in such brilliant counterpoint with so witless a heroine as Temple Drake, no doubt was designed to dazzle the eye, but the truth was that the spectacle merely fatigued the optic nerve. Actually, there were two stories in these pages of galley proof, the Freudian study of Horace Benbow in the one; and in the other, the adventures of Temple Drake, an inquiry into the nature of sin as one facet in that trinity of the ritualism of re-birth: sin, suffering, and salvation. Evil was projected symbolically in this second story, with terror springing out of the corruption. There was no innocence and little goodness anywhere; there was no salvation and little suffering. Only by suffering for his sins could a man be saved, but then he must be capable of suffering and he must be capable of redemption. The paradox was clear: to save his soul a man must possess one. Repent not, and you are not to be saved; be corrupt and recognize it not as evil, and you are already defiled and lost and condemned. 15 Knowing you are doomed and damned you find sanctuary, no matter how fleeting, in a corn crib or in a Memphis bordello if your name is Temple Drake; or in a jail if you are a Lee Goodwin; or in death if you are a Popeye. You acquiesce in your fate, not as a nebulous form of determinism, but as an inevitable consequence of your folly, your debasement, and your unfitness to win salvation. What happens to you is symbolic of what had already happened to your soul. Your choice was made before you undertook the act. Thus, perhaps, did William Faulkner analyze those galley sheets and consider how best they might be revised, so as not to shame too much The Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying . Which should it be: Freud and Horace, or sin and Temple Drake? A decision could not have been very difficult. Horace and his aura of languid libidinousness had been conveyed once before in the earlier Sartoris , a fact that possibly accounted for the warmed-over flavor in the unrevised text of Sanctuary . On the other hand, Temple Drake as a current manifestation of profane love was new; and participation in vice, even vicariously, was always more interesting than a mere contemplation of its possibilities; and maybe 10,000 of them would want to read about it; and that was the immediate objective, to write a book that would sell. Once such a decision had been made, the rest was easy. Out must go the psychological overtones, the domesticity and warmth of Miss Jenny, and the ascription of any humanity whatever to most of the characters. Popeye must be denied any such sentimental affectation as the ownership of a watch that belonged to his grandfather and had a lock of his mother's hair in the case. Out, too, and speedily, must go the emphasis on Horace. This was largely a matter of transposition and exclusion. Viewed in the round, a complete reorientation was a prime requisite, with a smash finish to replace those really dreadful letters between Horace and Narcissa,—an immolation scene, perhaps, with the helpless and blameless victim as a sacrifice to appease the angry mob. Place the opening of the book at the Frenchman Place, as Horace looks up from the spring to find the diabolic Popeye staring at him with those eyes like two knobs of rubber, but whisk him away before he can dominate the action. Bring Temple into view, then plunge her into a tragedy that will be all terror and no pity whatever, for with no pity there could be no purification and hence no katharsis. Keep enough of the bumbling Horace, that dispirited Daedalus who was never able to remember where he had dropped the skein of linen thread, that somnambulist neither quick nor dead who was beyond good and evil because he was incapable of the one and too spineless for the other, keep this tragic failure of a man to contrast with the more forthright and animated bootleggers and gangsters and madams who had the merit if not the virtue of honesty; but subdue the light falling upon him, and always thrust Temple back into the glare. Be heartless, therefore, in stamping this pattern of evil; be unrelenting; be direct. Cut here, rewrite there, transpose, elaborate, condense. In some such fashion, and with a minimum of effort, Faulkner altered the entire focus and meaning of the book; he simplified a too-complex structure; he excluded the irrelevant; he clarified the obscure passages where ambiguity was not an asset; he amplified those portions requiring emendation; he gave the novel a climax; and he freed it from its bonds of previous servitude to an earlier book. For the magnitude of his accomplishment there can be only admiration; for the skill he revealed there can be only respect; and for his minor miracle of revision there can be only gratitude. Had he failed, had he served up in error that mishmash of Freudianism out of day-before-yesterday's scraps, then it is possible to believe he might at the same time have committed the artistic suicide he once mentioned when, long ago, out of sheer desperation, he took refuge in the writing of a book with the magnificently ironic title of Sanctuary .</field>

The book was reviewed by John Chamberlain in The New York Times , February 15, 1931. Starke and others give the publication date of March, 1931, without supporting evidence; but this date is manifestly in error. 2 Starke, "An American Comedy, an Introduction to a Bibliography of William Faulkner"; The Colophon , Part 19 (1934), states 'about 2000 copies.' Daniel, A Catalogue of the Writings of William Faulkner , Yale University Library, 1942, states "2219 copies"; and this figure has been accepted here, even though no authority is cited by Daniel. 3 The summary of the plot as given in The Oxford Companion to American Literature contains a number of inaccuracies, so serious as to invalidate the whole. 4 Cowley, in his introduction to The Portable Faulkner , reads 'mechanism' for 'materialism,' an interpretation that now seems more political than literary. 5 Cowley is guilty of an unaccountable lapse when he asserts in his introduction to The Portable Faulkner that The Sound and the Fury was written before Sartoris , a statement that has been uncritically accepted by Howe, and others. Cowley's unsupported assertion would not seem to be susceptible of proof, particularly in view of Faulkner's own recollections as outlined in his introduction to the 1932 Modern Library Edition of Sanctuary . 6 Copyright Office, The Library of Congress. 7 Introduction to the 1932 Modern Library Edition of Sanctuary . 6 Copyright Office, The Library of Congress. 8 Month and day printed on 1st galley. 9 Month and day printed on 5th galley. 7 Introduction to the 1932 Modern Library Edition of Sanctuary . 10 Robert Cantwell, quoting an unspecified source in his introduction to the Signet Edition of Sartoris . 11 Cantwell, Signet Edition of Sartoris . 12 While the private owners of these two sets are known to the present writer, he has not been authorized to make their names public. When this paper was in proof, the writer learned that Professor Carvel Collins of M.I.T. owns the author's set of galleys with Faulkner's typed inserts and substitutions. 13 References to the published version in both appendices A and B are based on the first edition, or to the first Modern Library Edition, which was printed from the original plates. 14 This need was doubtless accentuated by the fact that he was married on June 20, 1929. 15 Faulkner's idea that a soul may be redeemed through suffering is explicit in Requiem for a Nun . It is, moreover, neatly summarized in that book in Nancy's own words on p. 278, first edition. Mr. Carvel Collins of M. I. T. in "A Note on Sanctuary " in the November, 1951, issue of The Harvard Advocate , underscores the sometimes forgotten fact that Sanctuary merely recorded corruption, and never made it appealing, nor registered any approval.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Variants in the 1479 Oxford Edition of Aristotle's Ethics by Dennis E. Rhodes</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not since the days of Falconer Madan and E. Gordon Duff have the results of detailed research on early Oxford printing been published. Now, as the British Museum's cataloguing of English incunabula proceeds, it is possible to give an account of the variants which occur in the second book printed at Oxford—Aristotle's Ethics in the Latin translation of Leonardo Bruni. The book is a small quarto of 174 leaves, the first blank, with signatures a-x 8 y 6 and with 25 lines to a page. It is not relevant to the present note to argue whether or not Theodoric Rood was the printer of the first three Oxford books: controversy which has raged for years has never settled this point. Meanwhile it does not appear ever to have been noted in print hitherto that the Aristotle of 1479 exists in different states. 1 The variants which I have been able to discover in the British Museum's two copies seemed to be sufficiently numerous and interesting to justify a detailed examination of all known copies. I am very grateful to all the librarians who have answered my questionnaires on this subject. First, however, it is necessary to re-examine Duff's entry for this book in respect of the number of extant copies. Of the nine copies which he records, only seven can be traced today, with the addition of an eighth in the Broxbourne Library belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Ehrman. There never was a copy in Norwich Public Library, although the Broxbourne copy was formerly in the possession of Norwich Cathedral, which may account for Duff's error. The Earl of Pembroke's copy, sold in 1914, is now in the Chapin Library at Williamstown, Mass. Lord Amherst's copy, wanting four leaves and (says Duff) sold in 1908, I have not traced. 2 Further, the Gesamtkatalog (2373) lists a copy at Cambridge University Library which is in fact a single-leaf fragment; it repeats from Duff the error of locating a copy at Norwich; and it unaccountably locates one at the Henry E. Huntington Library in California, which again is untrue. Extant copies other than fragments are therefore as follows: (1) British Museum, C.2.a.7; (2) British Museum, Grenville 7930; (3) Bodleian Library, Oxford, S. Seld.e.2; (4) All Souls College, Oxford, L.R.4.e.14; (5) Chetham's Library, Manchester; (6) John Rylands Library, Manchester, no. 15969; (7) Chapin Library, Williamstown, Mass.; (8) Broxbourne Library (imperfect). 3 In the account which follows, these copies are listed thus: BM1, BM2, Bd, AS, C, JR, W, and Bx.</field>

(2) All the remaining variants occur by press correction in the second half of the book, and in each case both pages of a forme are affected. However, neither of the formes here involved has been reset: indeed, in the press correction the setting of as few letters as possible in each of the lines affected has been changed. (3) BM1 is the only copy which shows the uncorrected state of n and q combined with the original setting of a; and BM2 the only copy showing the resetting of a (combined with the corrected states of n and q): this is perhaps purely fortuitous but the copy may have been made up from late-printed sheets. Three copies show a mixture of the original setting of a and the corrected states of n and q. Two copies show a mixture of original quire a, uncorrected n, and corrected q. Bx (defective in quire a) is the only copy which shows (u) in q and (c) in n. Conclusions (1) It is clear from the arrangement of the variants that the book was printed in formes of only two pages. It now occurs to one to ask whether the sheets were cut in half before printing or whether each full sheet was printed on the one half with a two-page forme and then put through the press a second time to print the other half with its appropriate two pages, the process being repeated in the perfecting. In three copies examined to check this interesting point (BM1,2 and Broxbourne, the latter missing five leaves in quire a), in some one sheet of each quire in the series a-f there is an impossible combination of watermarks or of their absence; and this evidence shows that quires a-f were printed by cut sheets. On the other hand, in these three copies all the remaining quires exhibit normal watermarking, this indicating that printing by full sheets (each sheet going through the press four times) was the method in quires g-y. (2) It is not likely that the inner forme of a4 was reset merely to correct its two small misprints (a4 v ,l.18 and a5 r ,l.1). Indeed, the fact that this, the only forme to be reset, is also the forme which would normally be the first to be printed, strongly suggests a decision taken during its printing to increase the size of the edition. Other explanations are possible: for instance, the forme might have been hopelessly upset during printing, and have had to be reset; or insufficient copies of it might have been printed, and this error have been noticed before or during the printing of the outer forme. But then one would have to ask: why did the accident happen to this of all formes? The balance of probability points to a decision to increase the size of the edition, because no other interruption involving resetting would be specially associated with the printing of a first forme. It would be unsafe to assume offhand that the state of this forme in which the misprints are corrected is the later. The compositor makes so many misprints in the remainder of the book, that he might well here have introduced new errors in resetting a forme which he had previously set correctly. But the fact that one state survives in six copies and the other in only one may perhaps indicate that the single-copy state is the later; and this is also the one in which the misprints are corrected. Lastly, a sudden discovery by the printer that the possible market for his book was larger than he had hitherto foreseen (or an unexpected order for further copies from his patron or agents, etc.) is particularly liable to occur with a book in considerable demand. Such, certainly, was Aristotle's Ethics in fifteenth-century Oxford. Other similar cases will readily be called to mind, as for instance that of Fust and Schoeffer's Mainz Psalter of 1457. (3) No variants have been discovered in the remainder of the book, although similar misprints occur throughout, even in the non-variant formes of quires n and q. It would be useless to speculate what accident led to the correction of misprints on only two formes of n and q. It is noticeable however that each page of these formes contains a corrected misprint. Evidently in each case whoever noticed the first error (it need not necessarily have been the careless compositor) was thereby stimulated to find the second; but he did not notice or understand the misprint 'mitua' for 'mutua' on q7 r ,l.6, and this was only made worse by the substitution of 'mictua'.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 Except that Duff, Fifteenth Century English Books (1917), no. 32, notes that in the capital-space on 9 r both British Museum copies have a printed guide-letter O, which is absent in other copies. He further notes that on 2 r , 11.6 and 7, the misprints 'visitatum' (for 'usitatum') and 'insidnant' (for 'insudant'), which are visible in the British Museum copy, have been corrected in all other copies by erasure occasionally supplemented by inking. It may be remarked that correction by inking without erasure is here found in one of the British Museum copies (C.2.a.7.). These manuscript corrections were presumably carried out in the printer's office. 2 It is just possible that this copy is now the Broxbourne copy, which also lacks four leaves, not including the first blank; but no indication is provided by the book itself that its previous owners were other than the Dean and Chapter of Norwich. See also Falconer Madan, Oxford Books, (vol. 2, Oxford Literature 1450-1650, and 1641-1650 , p. 3): "Lord Ashburnham's copy was the Bright copy and became Lord Amherst's, sold in turn in 1909 ( sic )". But Madan does not name the next purchaser. 3 The Bodleian also has fragments of two other copies: at Inc.c.E7. 1(1) are leaves v3, and v6-8, mutilated; while at Arch.G.e.7(3) are leaves l3, l6, l7 and l8. Leaf m5 is in the National Library of Wales.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A Volume from the Library of Sebald Pirckheimer: Libri Impressi Cum Notis Manusciptis, VIII by Curt F. Bühler 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Pierpont Morgan Library recently acquired a copy of Ovid's Metamorphoses printed at Parma by Andreas Portilia in 1480 (Hain 12160). Below the colophon on the last printed page of the volume (PML 46607) there is a note which now reads: "Rubrica p er me sebaldum Pirkeym er anno m cccc lxxx &amp; Octaua epiphanie." 2 It is with the identity of the Sebald Pirckheimer who rubricated the volume that we are now concerned. This copy of the Metamorphoses also bears the stamp of the Royal Society in London, which plainly tells the history of the volume. 3 It will be recalled that Wilibald Pirckheimer's 4 library remained in the family till 1636, when Hans Hieronymus Imhoff sold the books to Thomas Howard, second Earl of Arundel. Thirty-one years later, his grandson, Henry Howard (sixth Duke of Norfolk), presented his library (including the Pirckheimer books) to the Royal Society. The greatest part of these books was sold by the Society in 1873 to the antiquarian bookseller Bernard Quaritch, and the present volume appears in his General Catalogue of Books (London, 1874, p. 1444, no. 18109) with this description: "Ovidii Metamorphoseos libri, folio, with MS. notes by Pirckheimer, who writes his Christian name Sebald, a few rude drawings on the margins, bd. Rare £ 12. Parma, Andreas Portilia, 1480." However, to return to the inscription as quoted above, history records only three contemporary Sebald Pirckheimers, all descended from Hans Pirckheimer the second (d. 1400). His grandson Sebald, 5 through the family of his first marriage (to Katharina Graser), died at an early age shortly after the turn of the century and can thus be excluded from our consideration. Sebald's nephew and namesake, in turn, was married to Katharina Praun, became a member of the "grosser Rat" of Nürnberg in 1477, suffered a catastrophic bankruptcy in 1492 and thereupon retired to the Carthusian monastery in Nürnberg. 6 He also appears in the records as "Sebald the Carthusian", but such books as he had (mostly on moral philosophy) he left to his Charterhouse. The third Sebald 7 was Wilibald's younger brother, concerning whom precious little is known; he and Wilibald were, of course, the great-great-grandsons of Hans Pirckheimer II by his second wife (Katharina Teufel). Dr. Hans (d. 1501), the father of the boys, records Sebald's birth (Arundel MS. 449, f. 278 v ) as "Anno d omi ni 1475 q ui nto k a l endas februarii, q uae fuit dies sabathi." 8 In 1475, January 28th did fall on a Saturday, thus establishing the fact that Dr. Hans was using the "style of the Circumcision" (January 1st) as the beginning of the year; 9 this was then the customary style at Nürnberg. This Sebald was certainly still alive on 26 April 1485, when he was mentioned in the will of his step-grandmother, Walpurg Dönninger (Doniger). 10 It is generally assumed, on what authority I have been unable to discover, that he died before his mother; the death of Barbara Löffelholz Pirckheimer took place on 21 March 1488. Since the Ovid we are discussing subsequently turned up with other books from Wilibald's library, it seems reasonable to suppose that his brother was not only the former owner of the volume but also the author of the note. But on 13 January 1480, Sebald Pirckheimer was not yet five years old; even in the fifteenth century children were not so precocious that they could rubricate volumes at this early age! Fortunately, modern technology can here come to our aid and offers a solution for our problem. In studying the inscription, one notes that the "-aua" is written in a different colored ink, with the last two letters written beyond the edge of the type-page and extending well into the inner margin. Examination by microscope suggests that another letter lies below the first "a". Further, only the characters "aua" have offset on the opposite (blank) page. The fourth letter of "epiphanie" seems to have been an "f" over which another hand has written a "p". The "-hanie" may also have been written at the same time and with the same ink as the "-aua". In the infra-red photograph of the inscription taken by the Library's expert photographer, Mr. Mark D. Brewer, almost the entire passage disappeared, the only characters clearly surviving being the "-aua" and "-phanie." Incidentally, the rubrication in the colophon (capital strokes and underlinings) made by the same ink also disappeared in this process. It is plain by now that the original inscription has been tampered with. Furthermore, close examination reveals that it is equally probable that the original letter under the beginning of "-aua" was an "o". This now suggests that the inscription be read as: "Rubrica p er me sebaldum Pirkeym er anno m cccc lxxx &amp; Octo. epif." It would, of course, have been quite possible for Sebald Pirckheimer to have rubricated the volume, and drawn some of the crude but interesting sketches in it, by 6 January 1488 when he was almost thirteen years old. In any event, that is how the present writer reads the inscription. But why, then, was the date altered? The only explanation that is at all plausible is that some later reader "corrected" the date to agree with the year of the colophon (M.CCCC-LXXXX) without noting that the inscription now proclaims the astonishing fact that the book was rubricated before it ever was printed (Idibus MaiisMay 15th)!! Since we are now assured that Sebald Pirckheimer was alive in January 1488 and did not die shortly after 1485, 11 a further deduction becomes possible. Among the "carmina mea quae Paduae composui anno domini 1491," there is a poem by Wilibald addressed to his "most gracious" grandfather ("Ad avum obsequentissimum") in which reference is made to the "iuvenes nepotes." 12 Now Wilibald arrived in Padua to commence his studies there in the autumn either of 1488 or 1489 (the authorities disagree). 13 Dr. Emil Reicke, in editing this poem, assumed that the word "nepotes" had to refer generally to descendants rather than specifically to grandsons, since he maintained (without offering evidence to that effect) that by this time Wilibald was the sole surviving grandson. May one not assume, just as readily, that Sebald was still alive at the time of the writing of this poem or, at least, that Wilibald in far-off Padua still thought that his brother was alive in Nürnberg? Such an interpretation would certainly underscore the words "avus" and "nepotes", and give them a natural and proper relationship. In that case, it is clear that Sebald was either still alive or Wilibald believed he was so when Wilibald was a student at Padua.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 This series of notes was undertaken in the hope of arousing more general interest in manuscript notes found in printed books than has hitherto been the case. Here one may still come upon "discoveries" which have escaped the notice of earlier students.

I am most obliged to Mr. T. J. Brown, of the Department of Manuscripts in the British Museum, for a new and full transcript of this entry in the Arundel manuscript. 9 On this point, compare Frederick R. Goff, "The Dates in Certain German Incunabula," PBSA , XXXIV (1940), 17-67 (esp. p. 18). 10 Reicke, p. 38; Reimann, p. 112. The date of the death of Sebald's mother is given by Reimann, p. 132, note 4. 11 No date for Sebald's death is given by Reimann ("Er ist wohl jung gestorben", p. 142, n. 1) or by Reicke ("er starb jung, wenn auch schon über zehn Jahre alt," p. 289). 12 Compare Reicke, pp. 36-38. The poem was written down by Wilibald on the flyleaves of an Italian incunable. These leaves, removed from the book, were in 1940 in the possession of Dr. Erik Waller of Lidköping, Sweden (Reicke, p. 32). 13 Offenbacher, loc. cit. , states that Wilibald was in Padua in 1488 (p. 241), while Reicke (p. 8) maintains that he did not reach Italy till 1489.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">John Stow's Editions of Skelton's Workes and of Certaine Worthye Manuscript Poems by William Ringler</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Stow, best known as an Elizabethan historian, author of The Annales of England, A Survay of London , and principal editor of the second edition of Holinshed's Chronicles , admitted himself that his earlier interests had been poetry and divinity rather than history. 1 He remained throughout his life a diligent collector of early poetical texts, and many of the manuscripts containing texts of Chaucer, Lydgate, and others passed through his hands; 2 but so far his only known published works dealing with poetry are his edition of Chaucer in 1561 and the notes he contributed to Speght's edition of Chaucer in 1598. In view of his avowed interest in, and extensive manuscript collections of, early poetry, I believe it highly probable that he edited at least two other volumes of verse. The first of these is Pithy pleasaunt and profitable workes of maister Skelton, Poete Laureate. Nowe collected and newly published. ANNO 1568. Imprinted at London . . . by Thomas Marshe (STC 22608). The table of contents (* 4 v ) is headed: "Workes of Skelton newly collected by I. S. as foloweth." At this time Stow was working for the printer Thomas Marsh, who published five editions of his Summarie of Englyshe Chronicles between 1565 and 1573; and in his own historical works he showed a knowledge of the satirical poems of William Cornysshe, whose "Treatise bituene Trouth and Information" is added to the present collection. 3 It is therefore highly probable that the editor "I. S." was John Stow. The Workes contains thirty-two items assigned to Skelton. The editor had gathered all the material (nineteen poems and a fragment) from seven earlier printed volumes of Skelton's poetry, printed twelve other poems for the first time, and made one wrong attribution. 4 The volume was reprinted in 1746 and 1810, and remained the standard edition of Skelton until Alexander Dyce published his Poetical Works in 1843. Dyce reprinted the entire contents of the 1568 volume, and added seven poems from three early prints that I. S. had overlooked; but beyond that he could find only three short items in manuscript that are certainly Skelton's. 5 I. S. was even more reliable in establishing the canon of Skelton's writing than was Dyce; for only one of his thirty-two items was wrongly attributed, while Dyce admitted six poems which are either doubtfully or wrongly attributed. 6 Since Dyce's time A Ballade of the Scottysshe Kynge has been reprinted; and four fragments, all wrongly or doubtfully attributed, have been proposed posed as additions to the Skelton canon. 7 The 1568 Workes , therefore, contains all but eleven of the poems which can certainly be assigned to Skelton. The second volume probably edited by John Stow is Certaine Worthye Manuscript Poems of great Antiquitie Reserued long in the Studie of a Northfolke Gentleman. And now first published By I. S. . . . Imprinted at London [by Robert Robinson] for R [obert]. D [exter]. 1597 (STC 21499). This has a one-line dedication, "To the worthiest Poet Maister Ed. Spenser," and prints for the first time three fifteenth-century poems. The first, "The Statelie Tragedie of Guistard and Sismond in two Bookes," a versification of Boccaccio's Decameron , IV, i, probably made about 1485, is also preserved in an early sixteenth-century manuscript; the second, "The Northren Mothers Blessing, Written nine yeares before the death of G. Chaucer" (probably too early a date), a version of "How the Good Wife Taught her Daughter," is also preserved in five manuscripts; and the third, "The Way to Thrift," a moralizing poem in nine stanzas, is also preserved in three manuscripts. 8 Certaine Worthye Manuscript Poems contains just the kind of early verse that especially interested Stow, and the dedication to Spenser is evidently a salute from one student of British antiquities and earlier English poets to another. 9 The balance of probabilities favors the assumption that the editor "I.S." was John Stow.</field>

We need a checklist of the literary manuscripts that were in Stow's possession, with an analysis of his marginalia and of the quotations from and comments on poets in his historical writings. If this were done, Stow might appear as the most important preserver and cataloguer of early poetry before Thomas Warton. René Wellek, The Rise of English Literary History (1941), discusses Leland, Bale and others, but omits Stow. 3 Z6-8 v ; see Annales (1615, p. 488). Stow may have found Cornysshe's poem in what is now Brit. Mus.

"Of thre fooles," X1-8, was shown by F. Brie ( Englische Studien , XXXVII [1907], 18-21) to be an extract from H. Watson's The Shyppe of Fooles (STC 3547). 5 Dyce reprinted Dyuers Balettys and Dyties (STC 22604), Magnyfycence (22607), and A Replycacion (22609); he omitted A Ballade of the Scottysshe Kynge (22593), an earlier version of "Against the Scottes," which was first reprinted by John Ashton in 1882. Dyce printed from manuscripts "The Rose both White and Rede" (I, ix-xi), "Agenst M. Garnesche" (I, 116-131), and the presentation verses beginning "I, liber, et propera" (I, 147). 6 In the Garlande Skelton said he had written poems on "Mannerly Margery" (printed by Dyce, I, 28-29), "Woffully araid" (I, 141-143), and "Vexilla regis" (I, 144-146); but we cannot be certain that the texts of the surviving songs, the first two set to music by William Cornysshe and John Browne (d.1498), are Skelton's—"Vexilla regis" is definitely not his (Brie, op. cit. , pp. 22-26; E. B. Reed, Christmas Carols [1932], p. 71). The attributions of "The Maner of the World Now a Dayes" (I, 148-154), "Salve plus decies" (I, 177—printed in the 1568 Workes but not claimed as Skelton's), and "Hoyda joly rutterkyn" (II, 245-246) have no acceptable evidence to recommend them. 7 "Petevelly Constraynd am y," proposed by W. Birch, Athenaeum (29 Nov. 1873), p. 697; rejected by Brie, op. cit. , pp. 21-22—both these scholars were unaware that an earlier and more complete text (beginning "Petyously constraynyd am I"), with music by Doctor Robert Cowper, is in Brit.

Wright's thorough study of all the early English versions, EETSos, CCV (1937), xxxvi. 9 In his Annales (1615, p. 811), Stow listed Spenser in his roll of honor of "our moderne, and present excellent Poets"; just as in the same place he enrolled Skelton, along with Chaucer and Lydgate, among "the chiefe of our auncient Poets . . . by whose singuler paines, and industry, our natiue language, hath from time to time, been much refined: and at this time directly by them, brought to great perfection."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">William Barley, Elizabethan Printer and Bookseller by John L. Lievsay</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Barley, the subject of this brief sketch, was a minor Elizabethan whose shortcomings remained far enough on the hither side of the law, and whose virtues lacked enough of being spectacular, to prevent the recording of either in the Dictionary of National Biography . Yet in many respects he was a worthy, even remarkable, 1 representative of his age. And, since his years of London activity overlap those of numerous lesser literary figures and coincide almost exactly with those of William Shakespeare, the curious student of our literary history finds in the record of his career and interests much to repay investigation. We have his own word that he was born about 1565; 2 but where, deponent sayeth not. Possibly his family was originally of Sussex. Some support for this conjecture may be seen in his being twice before the Court of High Commission for illegal sale of printed matter in the Sussex town of Cowdry, 3 and again in his dedicating two of his publications to residents of that county. 4 He first appears in the London records as a member of the Drapers' Company, his term of apprenticeship in that company ending in 1587. 5 Apparently there is no record of his translation from the Drapers' to the Stationers' Company, which must have taken place shortly thereafter. Such translations were not uncommon; but in Barley's case the change must have involved some irregularity. It is difficult, otherwise, to account for the fact that a man who had followed the stationer's trade for sixteen years should be made free of the Company only so late as 1606. 6 Whatever may be the facts behind his obscure and possibly clandestine entry into the ranks of the Stationers, it is a matter of record that between 1591 and 1614 Barley's name is associated—as printer, publisher, agent, or patentee—with approximately one hundred publications. The number is not great enough, of course, to place him among the most noteworthy members of his profession; but it is sufficiently impressive to warn the historian of the period that Barley is not entirely negligible. What is here proposed, therefore, is a cursory examination and evaluation of his output. So far as his own printing and publishing are concerned, Barley's career falls into two clearly marked active periods separated by a long and unexplained period of virtual silence. The first and more vigorous period extends from 1591 to 1599; the second begins in 1606 and continues to 1614. In the "dead" period between 1599 and 1606 only three imprints bearing Barley's name have been discovered. 7 Throughout these more than two decades Barley's interests, as reflected in the titles issued, remained pretty much the same: music, popular patriotic and sensational topical matters, works of utilitarian or "improving" nature, mild religious guidance, and, at the fringe, a few works which might almost step into the category of belles-lettres . A tradesman himself, it is clear that he was intent upon entertaining, instructing, and improving the members of his own class. By way of illustrating this somewhat narrow range of interest let us examine for a moment Barley's offerings for a single year, 1595. This, the peak year of his earlier period, saw the issuing of Adriano Banchieri's The noblenesse of the Asse , a curious piece of lore appealing to the popular love of paradox; Nicholas Breton's Marie Magdalens Loue , a bit of religious, sermonizing prose to which is added A Solemne Passion of the Soules Loue , a highly alliterative poem in the common six-line ballad form; and B. H.'s The Glasse of Mans folly, and meanes to amendment of life , a series of preacherly attacks, in a kind of debased Euphuism, upon the vices of drunkenness, whoring, and excess of dress. In this last book the unsigned address "To the Christian Reader," for which Barley may himself be responsible, gives an interesting and characteristically Barleian apology for the publishing of the work: If any . . . doe obiect that ther be many good bookes set forth, and therfore this is needles: it is more requisite for them to consider there may be vnlawful bookes of ribaldrie, merry lyes and vnprofitable stories to please fond phantasies, which doth derogate the glorie of God: I wish the inuenter, the seller and buyer to remember that they are the meanes to enlarge the diuels kingdome. It is miraculous to see how in many places they are delighted, perused and iterated againe &amp; againe. And the bookes which are a meane to draw vs from the diuell and hel torments, be little exercised of many: which doth diuulgate and euidently declare such people haue not the sweet taste that those haue which be indued with Gods holy spirit. It is apparant that sathan hath bewitched vs, and that the tares and his adherents spring thicker then the good corne. And therefore needfull there should be more good bookes to improoue the impietie that most be adict vnto. . . . 8 Other publications of 1595 were the Strange and wonderfull things happened to Richard Hasleton in his ten yeares Trauailes in many forraine Countries; John Hawkins' A Salade for the Simple . . . out of Prouerbs ; and Thomas Johnson's Cornucopiœ, Or diuers secrets: Wherein is contained the rare secrets in Man, Beast, Foules, Fishes, Trees, Plantes, Stones and such like, most pleasant and profitable, and not before committed to bee printed in English. Newlie drawen out of diuers Latine Authors into English by Thomas Iohnson . Notwithstanding the mouth-filling pretensions of the title-page, Johnson's compilation is in reality a rather slender collection of outrageously "unnatural" natural history in which all the entries, as if directed to very simple readers, are exceedingly brief. Johnson is possibly to be identified with the "T.I." or "T.J." whose sensational pamphlet Barley published in the same year under the appropriately descriptive title, A World of wonders. A Masse of Murthers. A Couie of Cosonages, etc. A pamphlet of similar cosening and conny-catching claptrap is the anonymous Brideling, Sadling and Ryding, of a rich Churle in Hampshire, by the subtill practise of one Iudeth Philips, a professed cunning woman, or Fortune teller. With a true discourse of her vnwomanly vsing a Trype wife, a widow, lately dwelling on the back side of S. Nicholas shambles in London, whom she with her conferates (sic), likewise cosoned: For which fact, shee was at the Sessions house without New-gate arraigned, where she confessed the same, and had iudgement for her offence, to be whipped through the Cittie, the 14. of February, 1594 . For convenience in wading through this title-page epitome, the printer has grouped the lines paragraph-wise; and for the reader's greater delectation and conviction, since "seeing is believing," he has also supplied a crude woodcut of this modern Judith bestriding her saddled and bridled Holofernes. The historian, however, hot upon the scent of current events, will do well to place this veracious account beside his copy of the Travels of Sir John Mandeville ; for of authentic Hampshire or London chronicle there is here no trace. The whole episode of the bridled "churl" is, in fact, lifted bodily from Henry Chettle's Kind-Harts Dreame , a work published three years earlier. Two plays and two pamphlets of topical interest by the egregious patriot-propagandist, Henry Roberts, 9 complete Barley's output for 1595. One of the plays was W. Warner's translation—which has the distinction of being the first published in English—of Plautus' Menœchmi . The other, an early instance of an English play printed in Roman letter, was Robert Wilson's The Pedlers Prophecie . Neither performance has much to commend it as a work of art. With the two pamphlets we are carried into the midst of the bustling swagger of British seafaring life in the Great Age. The first of these, Lancaster his Allarums —to give it only an inch or two of its page-long title—a tall, thin quarto in black letter and roman, recounts a typical freebooter's sortie into Brazil. It is true that certain "men of worth"—duly enumerated—lost their lives in the adventure; but the patriotic reader is left to infer that this trifling detail was more than offset by the fetching home of fifteen good ships laden with "spoyles and rich commodities . . . which was Sinemon, Sugar, Pepper, Cloues, Mace, Calloco-cloth and Brassel-wood." The second of Roberts' pamphlets, of which a single copy has survived, 10 this time in verse, though lacking the lavish detail of Lancaster his Allarums , is launched upon the same salt-spray of British naval enthusiasm and bears the stirring title, The Trumpet of Fame: Or Sir Fraunces Drakes and Sir Iohn Hawkins F [ are ] well: with an encouragement to all Saile [ rs ] and Souldiers that are minded to go in this worthie enterprise . . . . Barley knew where to place his appeal: No Elizabethan worthy of his salt could possibly have felt other than aggrieved that he had but one life to sacrifice at the side of a Lancaster, a Drake, or a Hawkins. The sensational, the patriotic, the pseudo-marvelous, the utilitarian and improving, the mildly religious, and the quasi-literary—these, as represented in the foregoing titles, constituted Barley's stock in trade. Lacking representation there, however, is one important item to which we must now turn our attention. In 1575 the Queen issued a twenty-one year patent for the printing of ruled music paper and of "all music books whatsoever." At that time the patent was looked upon as of little consequence and went uncontested to the musician Thomas Tallis and his pupil, William Byrd. By 1596, however, the printing of these musical supplies had apparently become a more lucrative endeavor. When the original patent expired, therefore, Barley, ever alert to turn an honest or even a slightly tarnished penny, stepped into the breach and published his Pathway to Musicke (1596) 11 and A New Booke of Tabliture (1596). For these, lacking music type at that time, 12 he made shift to print from wooden blocks. No further musical publications by Barley can be traced before 1598, in which year Thomas Morley, the musician, secured for himself a renewal of the expired Tallis-Byrd patent. Thereafter, until Morley's death in 1602 or 1603, Barley issued various musical works as one of Morley's several assignees. Just how this association came about is obscure. Pattison 13 conjectures that Barley's earlier "conflicts with authority may have enabled Morley to drive a harder bargain with him than with a better-established printer." This seems not unreasonable; but the arrangement may also have resulted from their being neighbors in Little St. Helens, Bishopsgate, though Morley's residence there has been disputed. 14 Certain it is that in the years 1596-97 a far more interesting figure than Morley was haunting Barley's neighborhood. The records 15 show that the petty collectors of subsidy were in those years finding it difficult to lay hands upon the taxes or person of one "Willelmus Shakespeare," resident "In Warda de Bishopsgate . . . In parochia Sancte Helene." One cannot help wondering whether the tax-delinquent poet-player and the law-flouting anti-monopolist printer ever exchanged views —or the time of day—in the parish streets or within the walls of the printing shop in Little St. Helens. But to return to Barley's musical ventures. During the period from 1598 to 1602 Barley issued, as Morley's assignee, some half dozen publications: the Sternhold and Hopkins' Whole Booke of Psalmes. With their woonted Tunes (1598?), and again, with Richard Alison's music, The Psalmes of Dauid in Meter. The plaine song to be sung and plaide vpon the lute, orpharyon, citterne or base violl (1599); John Bennet's Madrigalls to Foure Voyces (1599); John Farmer's The First Set of English Madrigals: To Foure Voices (1599); Anthony Holborne's Pauans, Galliards, Almains, and other short AEirs both graue and light, in fiue parts, for Viols, Violins, or other Musical Winde Instruments (1599); and Thomas Deloney's collection of ballads, Strange Histories, Of Kings, Princes, Dukes , ( etc. ) . . . Verie pleasant either to bee read or sunge (1602). What happened to Morley's patent immediately after his death is not known; but by 1606 the rights had passed to Barley. 16 Perhaps there is a connection between Barley's new rôle and his having been made free of the Company of Stationers in that year. In any event, from 1606 to 1613 all English music books were printed by him or by his assignees. With the rather numerous 17 productions of these latter we are not here directly concerned. Barley himself, in his second period, seems to have printed but three: Thomas Weelkes' Ayeres or Phantasticke Spirites for three voices (1608), Thomas Ravenscroft's Pammelia. Musicks Miscellanie (1609), and Thomas Robinson's New Cithare Lessons (1609). To these should possibly be added T. S.'s folio broadside with musical notes, A Psalme of Thanksgiuing, to be sung by the Children of Christs Hospitall (1610), printed for Barley by Edward Allde. Barley's rôle among our early printers of music is thus clearly one of considerable importance. 18 It has, as a matter of fact—and with some justice—hitherto been regarded as his chief claim upon our remembrance, though I am inclined to believe that an equally good case can be made out for him on other grounds. Before turning to a discussion of his more purely "literary" associations, it may be well here to mention a miscellaneous group of titles further illustrative of Barley's range of interest. What is probably his first known publication, The Honourable Actions of . . . E. Glemham, Esquire 19 . . . against the Spaniards (1591), is obviously part of the patriotic afterwash of the Armada. A Most wicked Work of a wretched Witch wrought on R. Burt (1592) bespeaks an interest which he and his fellows shared with James I—and not a few of their New England descendants. Gods Arrowe against Atheists (1593) is a long and labored tract by the esteemed puritan preacher, Henry Smith, popularly known as "Silver-tongued Smith." Present Remedies against the Plague (1594) speaks for itself, as does A Booke of Curious Strange Inuentions, called the First Part of Needleworks (1596). The Pathway to Knowledge , also of 1596, is a substantial black-letter quarto, largely of elementary mathematical nature. Especially useful (and therefore attractive to Barley and his clientelle) would have been the method of "keeping of a marchants booke after the Italian maner," which concludes the work. Epulario, Or, The Italian Banquet (1598) is a cook-book "wherein is shewed the maner how to dresse and prepare all kind of Flesh, Foules or Fishes. As also how to make Sauces, Tartes, Pies, &amp;c. After the maner of all Countries." And The Penniles Parliament of Threed-bare Poets: Or, All Mirth and Wittie Conceites (1608) is a kind of modified and inferior jestbook, a second part to the famous Jack of Dover . 20 I reserve to a place of its own the little morsel known as Strange Newes out of Kent, of a Monstrous and misshapen Child, borne in Olde Sandwitch, vpon the 30. of Iulie last, the like (for strangenes) hath neuer beene seene (1609). A crude cut on the title-page, reproduced in the text, 21 graphically depicts a misshapen creature of dumb-bell shape, head set in breast (i.e., with no neck, like Mandeville's anthropophagi), and with too many fingers and toes on the ducklike hands and feet. According to the statement preceding the account proper, the tract is published (and written by Barley?) as a warning to Englishmen for our sinnes and transgressions, therefore good Countrymen, and you whose Christianlike mindes will relent at the relation hereof: good Countrymen, I say, let me intreat you, that both your eyes and eares, may bee gentle witnesses to the truth of this strange wonder in nature, and that your hearts and mindes may be bent to a repentant vnderstanding, for the discourse here following, is both strange, true, fearefull, and full of much wonder, and because there shall be (no doubt) made of the veritie thereof, I haue here placed downe the names of such personages of credite, now dwelling in London, that were eye-witnesses thereof, and personably ( sic ) saw the same . . . 22 Then follow six names of witnesses, four men and two women. Their social level, and that of the prospective readers, may be gauged by the three whose trades are specified: M. Dickson , a Cooper, in Thames streete, neere to Saint Dunstons church. M. Smith , a victualer, in long-Southwark. Richard Rawson , Waterman, dwelling in East-Smithfield. 23 Barley knew as well as you or I that every reader is looking not merely for facts but for what our college freshmen call the true facts; and a fact attested by such a "personage of credit" as " M. Dickson, a Cooper , in Thames streete, neere to Saint Dunstons church" is just bound to be a truer fact than one sworn to by any old John a' Nokes or John a' Styles. 24 To come now to the most important consideration of all: What, if anything, do we owe to Barley in the realm of literature? The answer is, Not much that could not be spared; yet some things which we should be loath to relinquish to oblivion. Mention has already been made of his publishing the earliest English translation from Plautus—an accidental distinction, no doubt. But during the '90's Barley also published five other plays, 25 among them that curious dramatized sermon on repentance known as A Looking Glasse for London and England (1594), by Robert Greene and Thomas Lodge. 26 The others are of less intrinsic interest: George Peele's The Famous Chronicle of King Edward the First (1593); two anonymous plays, The True Tragedie of Richard the Third (1594) and The Life and Death of Jacke Straw, a notable Rebell (1594); and Robert Wilson's The Pedlers Prophecie (1595). Barley is sometimes disparagingly referred to as a publisher of ballads, and it is true that most of his verse offerings are of sub-literary calibre. Still, even here, he cannot be dismissed entirely. It will suffice to recall his publication of Nicholas Breton's A Solemne Passion of the Soules Loue (1595; 1598), and to remind ourselves that to him we owe the preservation, in a fragmentary and unique exemplar, 27 of Thomas Watson's second sonnet sequence, The Teares of Fancie. Or Loue Disdained (1593). Only two works of (admitted) prose fiction figure in Barley's list, and both are translations—or are said to be. The first, allegedly "done out of French" and doubtfully ascribed to Barley himself as translator, 28 is The Delightful History of Celestina the Faire (1596). If this euphuistic romance is less entertaining than those of Lyly, Greene, or Lodge, it is hardly less so than those of Melbancke, Dickenson, and Turner; and it is certainly to be preferred to the conglomerative pastiches of John Hind. The book has, incidentally, nothing whatever to do with the better-known Spanish work, La Celestina , with which the STC has confused it. Of the second, and undoubted, translation little need be said. It is a rendering by "W.B."—probably William Braunche (or Branch)—of Pope Pius II's The Most Excellent Historie, Of Euryalus and Lucresia (1596), an erotic tale already long familiar to English readers through earlier versions. In style it is even more exaggeratedly euphuistic than Celestina the Faire , as the following sentence may suggest: The branch which earely bloometh, is like to haue his blossoms bitten with disdainfull blasts, whereby they oftentimes proue but meer blights, and better had he fared with a friendly biting frost, to haue had his new peeping Iemmes gently nipped, and at first detained within their buds, then perswaded with the pleasing applause of sweet Zephyrus , so timely, or rather vntimely to display them to the full view, which exposed should bee iniured by the baleful breaths, violent and virulent blasts, proceeding from those freezing quarters, and their cold collaterals. 29 There remains to be assessed Barley's relation to certain prose pamphlets of half a dozen lesser Elizabethan writers whose works he printed or sold. These are among the most interesting of the publications with which Barley is connected; but, unfortunately, the precise nature of his connection with them is frequently shadowy, often hinting of something just short of piracy. We have seen, for instance, how one of his anonymous sensational pamphlets made use of Chettle's Kind-Harts Dreame. In exactly the same way, but with more extensive verbatim pillage, two other of his anonymous books represent reprints, under new titles, of works already published. His Pilgrimage of Man, Wandering in a Wildernes of Woe (1606) is simply a disguised re-issue of John Alday's popular translation (1566?) of Pierre Boaistuau's Theatrum Mundi ; and his Court of good Counsell (1607) is made up of selected verbatim transcriptions from the Third Book of George Pettie's translation, The Civile Conversation (1581), of Stefano Guazzo. No doubt there are still other instances of this kind of bookmaking among Barley's publications; but it is a problem beyound the modest scope of this paper to discover them or, having discovered them, to determine just how far Barley is himself responsible for this crafty dealing with other men's wares. In addition to those already mentioned, Barley published an illustrated and undated issue of the Troublesome Trauailes of Edward Webbe ; 30 a reprint of Thomas Harman's Caveat under the title—probably influenced by Greene's popular series—of The Groundworke of Conny-Catching (1592); and a reprint of Nashe's blast against Gabriel Harvey, The Apologie of Pierce Pennilesse: Or Strange Newes, Of the intercepting certaine Letters (1593), better known from the running-title of the earlier editions as Foure Letters Confuted . The last of Barley's publications that need be noticed here is his original (and sole) edition of Thomas Dekker's A Knight's Conjuring, done in earnest: discovered in jest (1607). I have not tried to depict Barley as an important figure in Elizabethan culture, nor have I here been able to set down all of the little that is positively known about him. I have, further, no doubt that some of his conduct was highly reprehensible. But even on the basis of the small evidence here submitted, I suggest that his interests and associations make of him a person about whom we would gladly learn more.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">In Re George Sandys' Ovid by Richard Beale Davis</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(1) The 1623 Edition of the First Five Books In George Sandys: a Bibliographical Catalogue of Printed Editions in England to 1700 (New York Public Library 1950), Professor Fredson Bowers and I mentioned that Mr. F. S. Ferguson had located a 1622 edition of The First Five Bookes of Ovids Metamorphosis by George Sandys. No details were at the time available. In 1954 I examined the book in the Library of Winchester College and arranged to have a microfilm made for further study. 1 A brief examination showed that the date was 1623 instead of 1622. Further investigation proves that the interesting little volume is not a reissue of the 1621 edition but a complete resetting. Before going into details, however, we should consider some general facts about the author and this particular work. George Sandys' translation of the whole fifteen books of Ovid's Metamorphoses (1626, rev. ed. 1632) is in its major part ( i.e. , more than half the books) the first poetry written in English in the New World. 2 But before Sandys came to Virginia in 1621 he had translated the first five books. 3 And in that year, before or after he sailed, appeared a second edition of this first one-third of the Ovid. The 1621 edition was described by J. Haslewood in 1808, 4 but until 1947 even the copy he examined had disappeared from view, and there was even some doubt that it had ever existed. 5 In the latter year, however, Dr. James G. McManaway of the Folger Shakespeare Library was able to secure for his institution a copy of this "elusive little book." He describes it in detail in an article published in 1948. 6 In 1950 in George Sandys: a Bibliographical Catalogue appeared a bibliographical descriptive summary of this copy. Both these considerations point out that at least two questions remain concerning the little book: 1) what and where was the first edition? 2) was there originally in the 1621 Folger copy the "head of Ovid in an oval, with verses beneath, as in the folios," as described by Haslewood? The first question remains unanswered. But in the 1623 edition we have an answer to the second. And a consideration of the 1623 brings up other interesting matters. The Winchester Ovid is bound in old, probably contemporary vellum. Facing the engraved titlepage and conjugate with it is the missing head of Ovid with engraved verses beneath, with the head facing left, in the opposite direction from what it does in the 1626 (first complete) edition. The engraved titlepage reads: THE | First Five Bookes | of | Ovids Metamorphosis | edit 3 d . | Imprinted for W: B: | 1623 The engraved page is certainly the same as that used in 1621. Whether the "edit 3 d ." and "1623" are workings over of "edit 2 d ." and "1621" or whether they are reengravings after obliterations is more doubtful. The collation differs somewhat from that of 1621 (see Sandys: A Bibliographical Catalogue , p. 26) and perhaps should be considered next: 12°: [fold, two leaves, engraved tp and Ovid's head], a 6 (— a 1) A-F 12 (original F12 perhaps missing and replaced by blank leaf with stub bound before F1) 7 , 77 leaves (counting the present F12 leaf but not the engraved fold), pp. [ 10 ] 1-8 6 10-141 142-144 ; $5(— a 4, 5) signed. ( Note : p. 1 is signed here, though in 1621 this is doubtful.) In their Contents the two editions are identical with the exceptions noted below. The five books begin respectively at A1, B2 v , C6 v , D8, and E11, each headed like Bk. I except for appropriate number and argument, as in 1621. Actually there is entirely satisfactory evidence that the whole of the 1623 edition is a page-for-page resetting of the 1621 (or possibly an earlier first) edition. Punctuation, catchwords, and capitalization are among the many indications. Thus we have evidence that while the poet was completing his translation in the Virginia colony during the hours snatched from night and repose, the first five books was reset and republished in London. Like Michael Drayton, who had encouraged Sandys to go on with the work, 8 the publisher felt that here was something the public would read. Perhaps the appearance of at least three editions of the first five books before he returned to London in 1625 impelled Sandys to the almost immediate publication of the whole, without taking time for the polishing of the couplets and for the commentaries he was to add later. 9 This apparently hurried publication may have been partially motivated by the author's confidence in the book's salability but probably partially to get it back into his own hands again. For in 1626 Sandys secured from Charles I a license for the exclusive rights to the complete edition for twenty-one years. 10</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(2) The Decree: Sandys v. Stansby The complete or second edition of George Sandys' Ovid's Metamorphosis was published in 1632 with elaborate commentaries on the text. Sandys, who was never wealthy, had borne the costs of publication himself. When in 1635 he found that one of the two booksellers who were handling the sale of the copies would or could not return him the amount expected from his investment, he was more than perturbed. He turned to the law for redress. Because of the peculiar conditions of the agreement, he felt that a "court of common law" would do nothing for him. Therefore he entered suit in His Majesty's Court of Exchequer. Sandys entered his plea against the established and reputable printer William Stansby in Hilary Term, 10 Charles I. His Bill, which covers the conditions of the agreement and outlines Sandys' complaint, the Answer, and the Depositions of a group of Oxford printers testifying in Sandys' favor were all published in an article in The Library in 1948. 11 These earlier documents supply interesting names and details of procedure and distribution in book printing and selling in the earlier seventeenth century. But they do not settle the suit, for the depositions of Stansby's witnesses were not to be found, nor the Decree or Order. Professor Fredson Bowers gave at the end of the article a detailed analysis of the situation as it stood in the light of the documents available. Since 1948 the present writer, in further investigations in the Public Record Office, has come upon the Order in the case, though the Stansby witnesses' depositions remain unlocated after extensive search. This Order reviews the suit, and for the sake of clarity should perhaps be printed entire. It seems unnecessary to repeat most of the details and explanations already in print in The Library . As we noted in the earlier article, Stansby's figures as to the number of copies he received from the printer were obviously in error. The Court bore the plaintiff out in deciding that the plaintiff's own figures were correct. We should like to know what the auditor, Mr. Pevey, decided about the exact amount to be paid to Sandys. And Stansby's specific charges for the printing and engraving of the first and last sheets are still not given, though of course almost surely he had to present the itemized account to the auditor. So far my own investigation and a later one by a professional researcher have not uncovered these figures or decisions—if they exist. Perhaps the auditor's report did not have to be formally entered. At all events, our earlier feeling that the poet was entirely justified in appealing to the law for justice is here confirmed. It took a long time to get legal justice. Whether Sandys ever actually received financial remuneration we should like to know. Stansby was dead by 1638 or 1639.

      <field name="heading_text">Patterns In Press Figures: A Study of Lyttelton's Dialogues of the Dead by William B. Todd</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several years ago I reported, as somewhat out of the ordinary, the issue of six different impressions of Burke's Reflections (1790), all within a period of seventeen days. 1 Even more remarkable, I now suggest, is the publication of three distinct editions of Lyttelton's Dialogues (1760), all in less than a week. If the rapid appearance of two editions, the two easily distinguished, provoked some comment at the time, 2 the actual existence of three may deserve this later notice. Of greater interest than mere numbers, however, is the extraordinary manner in which the book was prepared. Superficially the Burke and Lyttelton are much alike: both are octavos running over 300 pages and, in the initial printing, both have several cancels. But where the one, a product of the end of the century, was efficiently machined by some fifteen pressmen, the other, printed thirty years before, was tortuously worked—so far as they can be identified—by no more than eight. And where in the course of printing the one required only two alterations in procedure, each easily arranged from standing type, the other necessitated at least five, most of them achieved with the greatest difficulty from new settings. By one means or another, though, Lyttelton's printer, the eminent Samuel Richardson, accomplished more in less time than Burke's. How he performed this miracle remains to be seen. Throughout the account of the three editions (ABC) and, later, of a fourth (D), the reader should consult the accompanying table of press figures. As these appear, at first sight, to be a very heterogeneous mixture they have been partitioned in several groups, or phases of press-work, and assigned distinctive numbers. For the first edition it may also be convenient to arrange these figures and phase signs in a graph indicating the skeleton-formes used for the work. As illustrated in the graph, work began in an orderly fashion, after a tentative beginning at B, with pressmen 3 and 4 sharing three formes for the first two signatures in each sequence and 3 or 2 working the odd pair in the third signature. Since this book has a running-title across both pages of an opening (DIALOGUES | of the DEAD), the arrangement of the headings in any one skeleton generally limited its use to one forme. Thus through signature H skeletons I, III, and IV carry letter only for inner formes; and V, together with II, the common property of two presses, carry letter only for the outer. At I, however, the headlines were completely transposed, not only for the three but for the independent two-skeleton sequence, so that from this sheet onward the frames previously used for one forme are now consistently used for the other. Whatever the reason for this, work continued to K when, as noted, the pair of formes for each signature, hitherto assigned to a single press, are now allocated to two. This shift from successive to simultaneous printing was doubtless intended, here and elsewhere, to speed up the work and thereby reduce the accumulation of ready-type set by the compositors. Once this backlog was eliminated, upon the completion of L, the presses again revert to successive printing. At signature O occurs the first major alteration (phase 2), an increase in issue perhaps by another 500 copies. While this eventually complicated matters its only immediate effect was a further delay in presswork and thus, from R through U, further simultaneous printing to reduce the accumulation of type. Then again, from X through the preliminaries, the pace slackened as 8 alone finished off the remaining sheets needed to complete the book for publication on Friday, May 17. Of the preliminaries signature A 4 was probably machined as a half-sheet and a 2 imposed with eight reset pages of C, all required for an extensive cancellation in that sheet. Once the book went on sale it immediately became apparent that the demand would exceed the original order; but as that possibility had already been anticipated, in part, by an overprinting of O-X and the preliminaries, it seemed an easy matter to reset and machine the earlier sheets and thus bring all signatures up to the count for the expanded issue. Work therefore began on the third phase of operations, a sequence including the first four text sheets less only C, a signature deferred until the pages newly set for cancels could be reimposed with the others required for this sheet. Towards the end of the run, however, it became apparent that the supplementary issue would still fall short of the demand, and again the men were obliged to overprint, now most 5 of F, all of G through K, and the reimposed C. But in this, the fourth phase, the situation was far different from that encountered in the second, for any extension of the run after publication only served to delay the issue. Though Richardson endeavored to finish the job by assigning every available man to press and simultaneously printing the formes of every sheet, his best efforts, as he must have realized, were not enough. Whether he maintained the increased issue or reverted to the lesser number, some customers would fail to receive their copies. Faced with this unhappy dilemma Richardson, we may suppose, admitted defeat and immediately sought assistance from another printer. The sheets produced by the other shop, all easily recognized by differences in ornaments and measure, and by the absence of press figures, extend in this edition from M through N, the two signatures needed to complete an issue previously expanded from O through X. With these off his hands, Richardson then ordered his own shop to reduce the issue of L, the last of the sheets in his sequence. 6 So by dint of various strategems edition B hastily emerged as a composite of sheets, some produced from an earlier overprinting (2) and thus shared with A, some produced from a later overprinting (4) and thus shared with C, and some produced by a normal run before (3) and after (5) the later extension (3, 5) and thus peculiar to itself. As the advertisements disclose that C, the 'Second Edition', also appeared less than a week after A, it is easy to believe, as the figures indicate, 7 that this too was rushed through the press and hurried to the stalls. Fortunately some of the work was already done, by virtue of the overprinting in B, and what remained was now conveniently divided between two shops. Among the 17 sheets still lacking the second office reimpressed M and N, the two it had set for the preceding edition, and reset O through X, while Richardson's men reimpressed L, the sheet they had previously underprinted, and reset A, a, B, D, and E. To equalize the work Richardson also probably undertook the printing of an errata leaf Y1, a list belatedly received to correct errors in the first edition, as well as a cancel leaf I2. Perhaps the cancel was also intended for the first edition but, if so, in the rush of events on this work it could be supplied only for the last several copies of C. It now appears, so far as I know, only in the British Museum copy, which has several lines transposed to page 115 so that on 116 space is allowed for Boileau to remark, in further commendation of Pope: "Nor could I, nor did even Lucretius himself, make Philosophy so poetical , or embellish it with such charms, as you have, Mr. Pope, in your Essay on Man ." All the shuffling of type required to introduce this sentence must have been particularly annoying to Richardson, already much harrassed with the production of the book, for the encomium came sixteen years too late to be appreciated by its recipient. Even so it may be admitted, I suppose, for these are dialogues of the dead. With all these little details arranged, the so-called 'Second Edition' (C) was published on May 22, and both shops now stood ready for any eventuality. To the extent other commitments would allow, the type was now held intact, one shop retaining all the letter for B, D, and E, the three sheets most recently impressed, and the other retaining most of the letter from M through R. But alas, after clamoring for copies the public was now, for awhile, sated with Lyttelton; and it was not until September that the printers could again use, for edition D, what they had so carefully preserved. Thus after many desperate measures the well-laid plans which finally evolved were all to little avail. Nonetheless the work was done, and while Richardson and his unknown associate have left us none of their Dialogues the book itself is adequate testimony of their remarkable achievement.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Hawthorne's Income from the Token by Seymour L. Gross</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hawthorne published more of his tales and sketches in Samuel Griswold Goodrich's gift-book, The Token , than in any other single magazine or annual. In the years 1831-1838 no less than twenty-seven of Hawthorne's pieces, including some of the finest he ever wrote, appeared amongst a welter of sentimental engravings, incredibly puerile verses, and fantastic fictions in this the most popular "painted bladder" of its time. A knowledge of how meager Hawthorne's income from The Token was, gives us, I believe, an insight into at least one of the causes of Hawthorne's depression during "the solitary years," a depression that became so profound in 1836, that Horatio Bridge sincerely feared that Hawthorne was "too good a subject for suicide." 1 Even allowing for that kind friend's tendency toward the hysterical, there is little question that Hawthorne's emotional nadir was reached in the months before the publication of the Twice Told Tales , and that the meagerness of his remunerations was no small contributing factor to his depression. Bridge, obviously echoing Hawthorne's recent letter, writes: "I coincide perfectly with you touching the disparity between a writer's labor and a publisher's. It is hard that you should do so much and receive so little for [from?] the "Token" ( Hawthorne and His Wife , I, 149. Letter dated Feb. 1, 1837). Robert Cantwell has estimated that Hawthorne's work for The Token brought him an income of $100 a year. 2 Small as that sum is, even by nineteenth-century standards, it is still too high an estimate. Hawthorne contributed tales or sketches to The Token in each year between 1831 and 1838, with the exception of 1834, so that by Cantwell's figure Hawthorne would have earned $700 from his writing for that annual. Because we have positive evidence for the amount paid Hawthorne for only nine of the twenty-seven published pieces, any estimate of the total income must, of course, be hypothetical; but, for reasons I shall briefly outline, an estimate of about half of Cantwell's would seem more nearly to approximate the truth. We know that Goodrich paid Hawthorne $35, or about 75 cents a page for "The Gentle Boy" ( Hawthorne and His Wife , I, 132). It therefore seems reasonable to assume that the other three stories which appeared along with "The Gentle Boy" in the 1832 Token , "The Wives of the Dead," "My Kinsman, Major Molineux," and "Roger Malvin's Burial," were purchased at the same rate. If this is so, then all four brought Hawthorne $84. There is no certain way of telling what Goodrich paid Hawthorne for "Sights from a Steeple," which was published the year before, but if Goodrich offered $35 for a forty-six page story, chances are that he would not have given over $10 for a ten page sketch. Hawthorne might justifiably have expected a higher rate of pay for the three pieces he published in the 1833 Token from an editor who wrote him of his 1832 stories, "they are as good, if not better, than anything else I get" ( Hawthorne and His Wife , I, 132), and who admitted that he was "gratified to find that all whose opinions I have heard agree with me as to the merit of the various pieces from your pen." 3 But if Goodrich did give Hawthorne a raise, it was probably to no more than a dollar a page, for a dollar a page in 1837 was the most Hawthorne ever was paid for his work for The Token . It is more than likely, however, that Goodrich, who, on the whole, had the predatory ethics of most commercialists, paid Hawthorne at the same rate as for the 1832 pieces. Hawthorne, then, probably received either $36 or $45 for his three pieces in the 1833 Token , depending on whether the rate was 75 cents or a dollar a page. The only fact we have to go on in ascertaining the payment for the six pieces which appeared in the 1835 and 1836 Tokens is an irritatingly enigmatic remark dropped by Hawthorne's son-in-law, George Parsons Lathrop, in his introduction to the Riverside edition of the Twice Told Tales . After asserting the fact that Goodrich skimmed off parts of the defunct Story Teller for his annual (a fact substantiated by Elizabeth Peabody 4 ), he says, "It is worth recording as a curious fact in literary history that for the accompanying stories which Goodrich used in his annual he gave Hawthorne about three dollars apiece." 5 Which stories or how many were so meagerly paid for, Lathrop does not say. We do know, however, that the manuscript of The Story Teller was sent to Goodrich early in 1834 (Conway, p. 22), and since no work by Hawthorne appeared in the 1834 issue, any parts of The Story Teller which Goodrich wished to use would have had to wait until at least the 1835 volume. Moreover, we know for a certainty that Goodrich paid Hawthorne $108, or about a dollar a page, for the eight pieces in the 1837 Token ( Hawthorne and His Wife , I, 138), and that the five pieces in the 1838 volume, the last Hawthorne ever submitted to the annual, were solicited by Goodrich in February, 1837: "If you have any articles written for the 'Token,' I should be glad to get them soon, as I am putting the work into the hands of the printers" ( Hawthorne and His Wife , I, 150). Therefore, by a process of elimination, the stories referred to by Lathrop must be among the six published in the 1835 and/or 1836 Tokens . We can, however, exclude "Alice Doane's Appeal." This tale, we know, was originally a part of Seven Tales of My Native Land ( Hawthorne and His Wife , I, 124), and was then carried over to Provincial Tales . 6 The version which appeared in the 1835 Token was almost certainly a revision in which the incest and other sexual elements of the original version have been deleted or toned down. 7 My own feeling is that all five of the remaining pieces were part of The Story Teller , for everything else published by Hawthorne during this period was part of The Story Teller , except two hack pieces for the American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge , a magazine he edited for six months in 1836. There is no reason to believe that Hawthorne wrote special pieces for The Token during this period: he seemed willing to ride along on the strength of the segments of this the third of his ill-fated projects. If my surmise is correct, then these five pieces (which, by the way, included "The Maypole of Merry Mount" and "The Minister's Black Veil") earned Hawthorne $15, or about 22 cents a page! The figure seems incredible, but we have no reason to believe that Lathrop is lying. What probably happened was that Hawthorne, disheartened by the unforeseen decision to break up The Story Teller , 8 despondently allowed the opportunistic Goodrich to take the five pieces for the criminally low price of $3 apiece. In speaking of the fracturing of his project into unrelated fragments, Hawthorne told his sister-in-law, Elizabeth Peabody, that "he cared little for the stories afterwards, which had in their original place in The Story Teller a great deal of significance . . ." (Conway, p. 32). Since "Alice Doane's Appeal" was contracted for along with the four 1832 tales, perhaps Goodrich paid for it at the same rate (75 cents a page), or about $13. As we have already said, Goodrich paid Hawthorne $108 for the eight pieces in the 1837 Token . The five pieces in the 1838 Token were probably paid for at the same rate as those of the previous year. Goodrich's letter requesting material for the 1838 Token seems tacitly to accept the fact that Hawthorne would submit his material at the same rate (about a dollar a page): "The 'Token' is out; the publisher owes you $108 for what you have written,—shall it be sent to you? I shall want three or four sketches from you for the next volume, if you can finish them." ( Hawthorne and His Wife , I, 138). The last five pieces in The Token , then, probably earned Hawthorne $68. When we add the figures we come out with a rather dismal total. As I estimate it, Hawthorne's income from The Token was somewhere in the vicinity of between $334 and $343. Certainly more ought to have been given the man who, if he did not quite "save" The Token with his writing, as Bridge once angrily exclaimed ( Hawthorne and His Wife , I, 143), did adorn its otherwise pallid pages with some of the most notable short stories in the language.</field>

Accordingly, the first two installments of The Story Teller appeared in the November and December, 1834 issues of the magazine. But when Buckingham gave up the editorship at the end of 1834, the new editors, Samuel G. Howe and John O. Sargent (as well as Park Benjamin, who carried editorial weight even before he acceded to the editorship titularly in March, 1835), decided that the work should be broken up into unrelated fragments. It seems Hawthorne could do nothing about the change in plans.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">John Esten Cooke on Publishing, 1865 by I. B. Cauthen, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has become almost axiomatic that Southern writers, particularly just after the Civil War, found it difficult to place their writings with Northern publishers. 1 The reasons for such a belief are not hard to find: the latest literary history of the South is filled with references to the difficulties of "placing" an article with journals above the Mason-Dixon line. 2 Indeed, the Southerners themselves may be guilty of refusing to acknowledge the temper of the times, a movement away from the chivalric ideals, the golden glow of the past, towards the new day of business and realism. 3 Among those few writers who turned northward for publication 4 should be included John Esten Cooke, the Virginia novelist, who less than three months after Lee's surrender at Appomattox declared his intention of sending his "wares," as he called them, to New York editors. A letter of his, previously unpublished, makes his reasons clear. 5 the letter is dated June 23, 1865, and was written at "The Bower," the home of Cooke's old friend, "Ned" Dandridge; it is addressed to "Overton."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Overton, I write to ask another favour in addition to the numerous ones performed for the late Captain Cooke of the so called C. S. Army. I have "nothing to wear" this sweltering weather but a tremendously hot suit of Confed. cloth, and want you to get from Mammy's and send me by Express, my broadcloth coat and pantaloons. I am obliged to ask you to pay the dollar more or less, it will require, which I will repay, the moment I sell my horses, which will be soon. Direct the package, tightly wrapped in brown paper, with thick twine, to "A. S. Dandridge Esq Care Garland Butler P. M. Kerneysville Jefferson Co. Va". It will then come straight. Please do this for me, as early as may be, as I want to go over to the Vineyard [his brother Philip's home] soon, and really require the clothes. Tell Mammy I am well, and send my love: and that I don't want anything else. [overleaf] Now for a "few remarks" as to matters and things in general. I am like thousands of others, afloat, and my plans are rather unsettled; but I do not take a blue view of affairs by any means. I believe that a "better time is coming" and that the professions will soon begin to be more lucrative than ever. My resource for the present, will be literature—for the New York market, not the Richmond, where I can see nothing but a cowardly sett [sic] of time servers, whom I for one don't intend to harbour with. I have already sent to N. Y.—to the News ,—sketches of Jackson and Stuart which will bring me, I think, about $50—and I have little doubt of finding a market there for all my wares. For the present I am following my ordinary programme of spending the summer with the clan hereabouts—only I came up a little earlier than usual. [Five paragraphs pertaining to family matters follow.] Send along the clothes, and tell me what they cost. Please do this at once Yours affly Jno. Esten Cooke, late Capt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sketches of Jackson and Stuart duly appeared in the New York Daily News under the title "Southern Generals in Outline / Personal Sketches and Anecdotes"; a footnote to the first, the sketch of Jackson, which appeared on Tuesday, October 24, 1865, established the spirit in which they should be read: The design of the writer of these lines is to present a few familiar sketches of the more prominent Southern Generals, illustrated by characteristic anecdotes, many of them hitherto unpublished. His position gave him an opportunity of seeing in undress, so to speak, many of the most notable personages of the time; and these sketches may prove interesting, whatever the opinions or sympathies of the reader. They pretend to be nothing more than sketches. The fully finished portraits of the great historic figures of the recent contest cannot now be made; but the outline may be traced, and, perhaps, the likeness caught. The sketch of Jackson is for the most part drawn from the articles that Cooke had published in February, 1863, in The Southern Illustrated News 6 of Richmond as well as from a three hundred-page biography of Jackson that Cooke was to publish later that year. Only a few details are changed, those which might possibly offend Northern readers. The description that Cooke gives of Jackson "moving about slowly and sucking a lemon (Yankee spoil, no doubt)" is retained except for the parenthetical. Otherwise, the article has importance only as the intermediate step between the 1863 articles and the biography and the longer "revised" biography of 1866. The second sketch, that of General J. E. B. Stuart, appeared in the News for Wednesday, November 22, 1865, and was signed "J. E. C." It was "puffed," as Poe might have remarked, by this notice on the editorial page, headed "General J. E. B. Stuart": We publish today a charming sketch of this distinguished soldier, written by one who served under, and with him, and who knew him, and loved him; and whose skillful and graceful pen contributed to our columns the admirable sketch of Stonewall Jackson which we published a few weeks ago. 7 For these sketches, John O. Beaty tells us, 8 Cooke "received ten dollars a column and the cash in hand was a godsend." The two sketches cover about seven columns and Cooke's pay for them must have been approximately $70, a little more than he expected. Without any doubt the newspaper thought that this was worthwhile for them: in the issue of October 25, 1865, they boasted that " The News has a larger circulation in the Southern States than all other New York daily papers together." The boast was addressed to the advertisers, for certainly a newspaper that carried articles on two of the South's heroes would appeal both to the Southerners and to the advertisers' sense of a potential market. Along with the fortunate John R. Thompson and George Cary Eggleston, who both secured literary positions in New York, can be counted John Esten Cooke. He turned away from Richmond and Baltimore and dispatched his articles to the North where he was a bit more certain of a favorable reception. Indeed, of the thirty-one titles listed in the Cooke bibliography (Beaty, pp. 164-165), all but two of them were published outside the South: only Ellie , an early novel, and the 1863 biography of Jackson appeared under Richmond imprints. The other novels and biographies were issued from presses in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and even Toronto. Perhaps Cooke's letter to a friend concerning the forwarding of clothes suitable for the Virginia summer will allow us to modify an axiom too long automatically accepted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 The most recent statement of this generally accepted belief that I have seen occurs in Professor Jay B. Hubbell's excellent study, "Charles Chauncey Burr: Friend of Poe," PMLA , LXIX (1954), 833-840. He points out that both William Gilmore Simms and John Esten Cooke "were finding great difficulty in inducing Northern editors and publishers to print any of their writings" (p. 834). 2 See Professor Hubbell's statements on "Authorship in the New South," The South in American Literature 1607-1900 (1954), p. 710, where he writes that "the lot of the Southern writer had never been a happy one, but in the lean years of the late sixties it was pitiable indeed." 3 For an analysis of the antagonism between Northern and Southern ideals, see Henry Nash Smith, "Minority Report: The Tradition of the Old South," in the Literary History of the United States , ed. Spiller, Thorp, Johnson, and Canby, I, 607-617. 4 Professor Hubbell points out in his history of Southern literature (p. 711) that whereas Simms, Bagby, and Hayne failed to establish connections with Northern publishers, John R. Thompson and George Cary Eggleston both served as editors of Bryant's Evening Post . 5 The letter is preserved in the Hunter Garnett Papers at the University of Virginia. 6 For a reprint of these articles, see Stonewall Jackson and the Old Stonewall Brigade , ed. R. B. Harwell (Charlottesville: The Tracy W. McGregor Library, 1954). 7 In addition to these two sketches, there appears also a series of articles on "Mosby and his Men," almost certainly by J. Marshall Crawford. 8 John Esten Cooke, Virginian (1922), p. 87.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Walt Whitman's Correspondence with Whitelaw Reid, Editor of the New York Tribune by Edwin Haviland Miller</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the papers recently deposited by the Reid family in the Library of Congress are eleven unpublished letters of Walt Whitman to Whitelaw Reid, who, as editor of the New York Tribune from 1872 to 1905, frequently published the writings of the poet. These letters are significant for two reasons: they establish first printed appearances of some of Whitman's prose and poetry, and they also demonstrate that the poet was not quite accurate when he averred that he had difficulty publishing his works in the United States. 1 Despite reservations about Whitman's artistic stature, the New York Tribune encouraged him by printing many of his self-styled "gossipy" letters and a lengthy review of his 1876 author's editions of Two Rivulets and Leaves of Grass ; in addition, in its "Personals" the newspaper gave Whitman a great deal of publicity by printing, among other items, his own press releases. Reid's friendship with Whitman began when the poet "came to Washington as a nurse in the Army Hospitals." Reid adds: "No one could fail then to admire his zeal and devotion, and I am afraid that at first my regard was for his character rather than his poetry. It was not till long after 'The Leaves of Grass' period that his great verses on the death of Lincoln conquered me completely." 2 However, in the first extant letter to Reid, the editor did not hesitate to reject a Whitman contribution. 431 Stevens st. cor West. Camden, N. Jersey Dec 5. [1874] 3 My dear Reid, Hasn't this got vim enough—from your point of view, even as editor of the paper —to make you print it in the Tribune ? I am still tediously invalided here—but have not at all given up the hope of getting out of the woods, &amp; doing some work yet. When you come to Philadelphia, try to come over &amp; see me. Walt Whitman The next note to Reid is of importance, for it establishes that Whitman reviewed his 1876 books in the Tribune on February 19, 1876 (p. 4, cols. 3-5), under the heading, "Walt Whitman's Poems. | Extracts from 'Two Rivulets.'" private Calculated to make from 2 1/3d to 2 2/3d. columns, in the ordinary nonpareil, (or minion is it?) you use for reading matter. If convenient, when in type, send me a (revised) proof, which I will return by next mail. Walt Whitman 431 Stevens st. Camden, N. Jersey . [ 8 Feb. 1876 .] Whitman's review begins: "Herewith are presented, in advance of their publication, sufficiently copious extracts from Walt Whitman's new volume of poems, 'Two Rivulets,' to give a fair and pretty full summary of it. The book is an intertwining of the author's characteristic verse, alternated throughout with prose; and hence the name." In the article, Whitman, with considerable journalistic skill, excerpts significant passages from Two Rivulets . First he quotes from the Preface two paragraphs (pp. 5-6) 4 which explain his purpose in this miscellaneous collection of prose and poetry. Then he reprints his title poem "Two Rivulets" (p. 15) and the second poem "Or from that Sea of Time" (p. 16). 5 Next appear two more paragraphs from the Preface (pp. 12-13), with the deletion of a quotation from his poem "Eidólons" (pp. 17-20), which he reprints in entirety in the newspaper. Without comment he reprints a prose section entitled "Thoughts for the Centennial" (pp. 16-17), probably because of the topical interest in the Centennial exposition in Philadelphia later in the year. Then, abruptly returning to the biographical, he includes the first stanza of "Out from Behind this Mask" (p. 24). Once again rapidly changing subject matter, but always alternating prose and poetry, Whitman includes a prose section on "Freedom" (pp. 31-32), the poem "To a Locomotive in Winter" (pp. 25-26), and the prose "New Poetry —Prose Grander than Verse" (pp. 28-30, here entitled "New Poetry"). At this point in his review Whitman introduces descriptive material concerning his volume which the ordinary critic probably would have placed at the beginning: The volume, in its 350 pages, comprises, besides the "Two Rivulets," from which the foregoing extracts are taken, the prose essay, "Democratic Vistas," and the poetical pieces already published under the name of "Passage to India." Quite a large part of the book is occupied with Whitman's "Memoranda During the War," in the army hospitals, or down at the front, being given verbatim from the original notes of the time, "blotch'd here and there with more than one blood stain, hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom amid the excitement of uncertainty or defeat or of action, or of getting ready for it, or a march." He says, as he introduces these little note-book mementoes of the war. . . . Thereupon he quotes three paragraphs from "Memoranda during the War" (pp. 4-5). Then, turning to his 1876 edition of Leaves of Grass , Whitman writes: "We also add a few hitherto unpublished forthcoming pieces from 'Leaves of Grass.' On the new title page of the volume appears the following verse, signed by Whitman's autograph. . . ." He reprints "Come, said my Soul" from the titlepage, "After an Interval" (p. 369), "When the Full-Grown Poet Came" (p. 359), and "The Beauty of the Ship" (p. 247). 6 He concludes his article by quoting again from Two Rivulets : "A Song by the Potomac," which is called "By Broad Potomac's Shore" (p. 16) in the printed book, and "Ship of Democracy," which is the third section of "As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free" (p. 3), also the title of part four of Two Rivulets . The works quoted in Whitman's article mark first appearances in print which, I believe, have not been previously noted. The third letter to Reid refers to the publication of Whitman's "A Death-Sonnet for Custer" (later entitled "From Far Dakota's Cañons"), in the Tribune on July 10, 1876. 7 431 Stevens st. Camden N Jersey July 18 '76 My dear Reid, The cheque has reached me $10, as pay for the little poem—Thanks—I enclose a a for the "Personals,"—if thought proper. Walt Whitman The "Personal," which appeared on July 19 (p. 4, col. 5), is another unnoted Whitman item: The burial of little Walter Whitman, an infant year-old nephew of the poet, occurred a day or two since at Camden, N. J. It was very simple, without sermon or ceremony. In the middle of the room, in its white coffin, lay the dead babe, strewed with a profusion of fresh geranium leaves and some tuberoses. All the young ones of the neighborhood, by groups or couples or singly, kept coming noiselessly in, surrounding the coffin. Near the corpse, in a great chair, sat Walt Whitman, enveloped by children, holding one encircled by either arm, and a beautiful little girl on his lap. The little one looked curiously at the spectacle of death and then inquiringly in the old man's face. "You don't know what it is, do you, my dear?" said he, adding, "We don't either." Many of the children surrounding the coffin were mere babes, and had to be lifted up to take a look. The willingness of the Tribune to print this flattering account of the poet—by the poet—is a tribute to its sense of fairness. For earlier in this year Robert Buchanan, the English poet and admirer of Whitman, created a veritable international incident in which this newspaper vehemently took sides—against Whitman. 8 On March 28, the London correspondent of the Tribune , in a first-page article on "Anglo-American Topics," devoted two lengthy paragraphs to Buchanan's impassioned, but not very accurate, assertion, in the London Daily News of March 13, that Whitman was impoverished by the refusal of American editors to accept his poetry. The skepticism of the reporter—"Save me from my friends—or from one of them—must be Mr. Walt Whitman's cry when he gets this week's mails from London"—is also apparent in a long editorial in the same issue of the newspaper, "In Re Walt Whitman." On March 30 an editorial note again assails Buchanan for the recklessness of his charges and maintains, somewhat gratuitously, that Whitman's position in the Attorney General's Office "supported a family of four persons, before he received it; he held the place several years, and if he failed to accumulate any surplus during that time, the cause thereof was certainly not 'persecution.'" 9 Another hostile editorial appeared on April 12, "American vs. English Criticism," in which the author evaluates Whitman's poetry and, while acknowledging the power of his verse, laments the absence of discipline and restraint. Whitman's American friends soon rushed to his defense. On April 13, the Tribune printed a letter from John Burroughs, "Walt Whitman's Poetry" (p. 6, col. 1), 10 although the newspaper evidently withheld this letter, dated March 30, until after the appearance of the third editorial on the preceding day. Then a letter from William D. O'Connor, one of Whitman's most fervid admirers, was printed on April 22, "Walt Whitman. Is He Persecuted?" (p. 8, cols. 1-3). In answer to this extravagant, and garrulous, encomium appeared an editorial, on the same day, entitled "Intellectual Convexity." In May the Tribune returned to its former policy of treating Whitman objectively. Perhaps Whitelaw Reid himself restored the balance after Bayard Taylor, 11 evidently the author of the editorials referred to above, had run roughshod over the poet. At any rate, after the storm caused by Buchanan, the newspaper continued to reprint Whitman's contributions and to give him good publicity, as evidenced in the letter of July 18 reproduced above. 12 The next letter, although undated, can be assigned to 1878 through the reference to "A Poet's Recreation," a "gossipy" letter printed in the Tribune on July 4, 1878 (p. 2, cols. 1-2). 13 431 Stevens street Camden New Jersey July 12 [1878] My dear Reid I forward you same mail with this the little "Passage to India" we spoke of, with the "Captain" bit in. 14 If convenient have the pay for my letter of July 4 in Tribune ($20) sent me here. —I am well, for me—All the better for my pleasant N Y jaunt. Walt Whitman The following three letters deal with the publication of "Gathering the Corn," a previously unnoted signed article which appeared in the newspaper on October 24, 1878 (p. 5, cols. 4-5). 15 431 Stevens Street Camden New Jersey Sept 21 [1878] My dear Reid, Won't the herewith do for an editorial these days? The price is $10— Walt Whitman I am keeping quite well &amp; hearty yet for me— 431 Stevens Street Camden New Jersey Sept 30 [1878] My dear Reid Yes—put my name to the piece, if you like it better that way—But I think you had first better send the M S back to me, &amp; let me fix it up for an October article Yours Walt Whitman 431 Stevens Street Camden New Jersey Nov 27 [1878] My dear Reid If convenient please send me the pay for the Gathering the Corn article ($10) published Oct: 24 —All goes about as usual with me— Walt Whitman On April 15, 1879, the Tribune carried a two-column report of Whitman's Lincoln address—"A Poet on the Platform" (p. 2, cols. 3-4). The first paragraph of the "news report," The poet Walt Whitman made his beginning as a lecturer last night at Steck Hall, in Fourteenth-st. His subject was the death of President Lincoln. He reads from notes, sitting in a chair, as he is still much disabled from paralysis. He desires engagements as a reader of his own poems and as a lecturer. The following was last night's discourse. . . . draws upon a letter sent to Reid the preceding day: Monday afternoon April 14 [1879] 1309 Fifth av: near 86th st My dear Reid— As you might possibly have room in the paper—&amp; a full report might hit—I send you a complete copy of my lecture, to take the chances for to-morows paper —(As I calculate, it would make about three quarters of a column of small type)— —My plan is to break the tedium of my half invalidism from time to time (&amp; also collect a few shekals) by getting engagements as a lecturer &amp; reader,—&amp; this is an attempt to break the ice. Walt Whitman 16 The next two letters refer to three of Whitman's "gossipy" articles which appeared in the Tribune in May, 1879. 1309 Fifth av. near 86th st Thursday afternoon May 8 [1879] My Dear Reid Can you use this for Saturday's paper ? (Will make a column &amp; a third or half about)— —If put in type please have me the proof (which I will return forthwith) sent to-morrow afternoon anytime before 7 o'clock to above address— Walt Whitman 1309 Fifth av: near 86th street Monday noon May 12 [1879] My dear Reid If you put this in type perhaps you could send me a proof to-morrow Tuesday afternoon say by 2, (if convenient order it so, specifically) —It will make, I think, from 1½ to 1¾ columns—Can you use it in Wednesday's paper? —I have another screed— Central Park jottings , &amp;c—which I think of offering you for Saturday's paper—I return to Camden in a few days— Walt Whitman The first "Letter to the Editor," on May 10 (p. 2, cols, 1-2), is entitled "Broadway Revisited. | Letter from Walt Whitman. | Sights and Sounds in the Metropolis— Broad-|way, from the Battery—The Old Park | Theatre—John Jacob Astor— The Old Omni-|bus Drivers." The second letter appeared on May 17 (p. 2, cols. 3-4): "Real Summer Openings. | Letter from Walt Whitman. | Jaunting Up the Hudson—The Ulster County | Region—Spring Sights amid Hills and Rocks | —The Birds; Bees; Turf-Fires—Shows on | the River—Vassar and Manresa—Walter | Dumont and his Medal." 17 The "screed— Central Park jottings , &amp;c" was called "These May Afternoons" when it came out in the May 24 issue (p. 2, cols. 3-4). 18 (The first two letters have not been recorded in the Whitman canon.) The next letter is interesting because it reveals a promotional scheme which, if successful, would have been a profitable venture for the poet. However, Reid evidently was not enthusiastic about the project, for the material does not appear in the Tribune . London Ontario Canada June 17 '80 My dear Reid Herewith find a letter for the paper. The price is $12—If used it must be printed in the paper of Tuesday, June 22 (or afterward) The letter is sent in the same manner as this to several other papers in Canada &amp; The States—(no two papers in same city)—one each in Boston, Phila: Cincinnati, Denver, &amp;c—on the same condition— this condition being a point of honor —It is sent to no other but you in New York Walt Whitman I am well for me—&amp; having a good time—fine country, many fine people here— I go all about leisurely but this will be my headquarters &amp; p. o. address all summer 19 The last extant letter to Reid confirms what any one examining the publicity Whitman received in the Tribune , particularly in 1876, suspected: the poet frequently supplied Reid with press clippings from Philadelphia and Camden newspapers. In this letter, at the top of the page, Whitman has scrawled: "? Under Bits of Criticism in Sunday Tribune ." Then he supplies the headline: "A defence of Walt Whitman From the Philadelphia Press." There follows a clipping from the Press concerning the Boston censorship of the Osgood edition of Leaves of Grass . So far as I can discover, this excerpt did not appear in the Tribune . Significantly, presumably in the hand of Whitelaw Reid, we find at the bottom of the letter the words "not answered." Camden May 23 [1882] My dear Reid Couldn't you feel to print the above say for instance in the Bits of Criticism in next Sunday's Tribune ? Walt Whitman Thus Whitman's relations with the New York Tribune in the 1870's and the early 1880's were not only cordial, despite the brief hostility during the Buchanan incident, but also remunerative. As we can see from references to payments, Reid was not miserly in his treatment of the poet, and, with the exception of two articles, he freely opened to Whitman the pages of one of the most influential newspapers of the era. Such was Reid's interest that he permitted the poet to act as his own publicity agent. That Whitman's contributions were not always of the highest caliber is probably in part the responsibility of the Tribune , which preferred, according to Henry James, "'newsy' and gossipy" reminiscences to more substantial fare. 20</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notes 1 See the excellent article by Portia Baker, "Walt Whitman's Relations with Some New York Magazines," AL , VII (1935), 274-301. 2 See the facsimile of Reid's letter of December 21, 1911, in Charles N. Elliot's Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and Friend (Boston, [1915]), p. 213. 3 This letter has been dated "1874," evidently by Reid. The following letters reprinted here have been dated by the same hand: February 8, 1876; September 21, 1878; November 27, 1878; May 8, 1879; May 12, 1879; May 23, 1882. The dates are confirmed by references to articles or letters in the Tribune . On the basis of internal evidence I have dated the letters of July 12, 1878, and September 30, 1878. 4 All references are to the Author's Edition (Camden, 1876), which consists of five parts separately paginated. 5 In reprinting this second poem in the newspaper, Whitman treats it as a continuation of "Two Rivulets." Although the poet in his note to Reid asks for proof, he evidently did not receive it, since the texts of the newspaper versions reveal minor differences in capitalization and punctuation. In line 20 of "To a Locomotive in Winter" in the Tribune , the phrase "rumbling like an earthquake" is omitted. 6 All references are to the Author's Edition (Camden, 1876). 7 The letter, dated July 7, 1876, in which Whitman forwarded the poem to Reid has been published in Royal Cortissoz' The Life of Whitelaw Reid (New York, 1921), I, 312. Reid's reply appears in Horace Traubel's With Walt Whitman in Camden (1908), II, 212. 8 An analysis of references to Whitman in the Tribune during the first seven months of 1876 reveals a sharply fluctuating attitude. On January 29 (p. 6, col. 6) and again on February 25 (p. 4, col. 5), Whitman interviews, reprinted from other newspapers, emphasize the poet's complaints about his treatment by American magazine editors. The first interview, which appeared in the West Jersey Press , was sent by the poet to William Michael Rossetti and was the basis for Buchanan's provocative letter. See Clifton Joseph Furness, Walt Whitman's Workshop (1928), pp. 246-248. On February 10 (p. 4, col. 5), the Tribune observes: "A gentleman of Philadelphia has sent Walt Whitman a present of $100." On March 1 (p. 4, col. 6), the newspaper reprints another excerpt from Two Rivulets , on the murder of Lincoln, which appears in "Memoranda during the War" (pp. 48-49). Until March 28, then, the newspaper revealed no animosity toward Whitman. While the controversy raged over the Buchanan allegations, the Tribune was hostile to the poet in news dispatches. See the references on March 30 (p. 6, col. 2), April 10 (p. 4, col. 5), April 17 (p. 4, col. 4), and on April 26 (p. 4, col. 5). The last two items are based on communications from Moncure D. Conway, the Unitarian minister and early friend of the poet, who labeled Buchanan's charges "gross exaggerations." 9 A bitter attack on this editorial appeared in the Camden New Republic on April 1, reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke's Walt Whitman (Philadelphia, 1883), pp. 216-217. 10 This letter is reprinted by Clara Barrus in Whitman and Burroughs Comrades (1931), pp. 125-128. 11 See Barrus, p. 173; Burrough's letter to Edward Dowden in April, 1876, in The Life and Letters of John Burroughs (1925), I, 182; O'Connor's letter to Dr. Bucke in Esther Shepherd's Walt Whitman's Pose (1938), p. 356. In an unpublished letter to John Burroughs, dated May 4, 1876, O'Connor attacks, with his customary vehemence, the editorial of April 12 and vilifies Taylor with such phrases as "small potatoes" and "peach blossom." (This letter is in the Estelle Doheny Collection of the Edward Laurence Doheny Memorial Library at St. John's Seminary, Camarillo, California.) In a letter to Kennedy in August, 1886, Whitman refers to Bayard Taylor and Whitelaw Reid as "the most malignant and persistent enemies of W. W. and L. of G. from the beginning and throughout"; see William Sloane Kennedy, Reminiscences of Walt Whitman (1896), p. 51. 12 The neutrality of the Tribune is evident in the allusions to Whitman during the next three months; see May 6 (p. 6, col. 6), May 26 (p. 4, col. 5), June 3 (p. 6, col. 5), June 20 (p. 6, col. 2), and July 6 (p. 4, col. 5). 13 Noted in CHAL , II, 560. The material in this letter appears in Specimen Days and Collect (Philadelphia, 1882-1883), pp. 113-118. 14 "O Captain! My Captain!" appears in Passage to India (Washington, 1871), p. 41. This volume appeared separately and was later bound with Leaves of Grass . Whitman refers to the former state. 15 This article, with minor phrasal changes, appears in Complete Prose Works (1914), pp. 495-496. 16 The text of this letter is based on a typescript prepared by the secretary of the late Ogden Reid. 17 The first letter, rearranged, appears in Complete Prose Works , pp. 506, 12-14; the second, rearranged and abridged, in Specimen Days and Collect , pp. 129-133. 18 This letter is erroneously dated May 23 in CHAL , II, 560. The material was abridged when reprinted; see Complete Prose Works , pp. 127-130. 19 An almost identical letter of the same date, addressed to the Editor of the Denver Tribune , is in the Doheny Collection. Except for minor phrasal changes the only difference is the price Whitman asks—$10 rather than $12. According to CHAL , II, 560, the article entitled "Summer Days in Canada" appeared in the London [Ontario] Advertiser on the date stipulated. 20 See James's letter to Reid on August 30, 1876, in Cortissoz, I, 308-309. Other letters by Whitman to the Editor of the Tribune were printed on August 4, 1881— "A Week at West Hills" (p. 5, col. 4)— and on August 15, 1881—"City Notes in August" (p. 5, col. 5). Both are noted in CHAL . The first article is referred to in a letter to Reid (now in the New York Public Library), dated August 3, 1881, which has been reprinted by Professor Rollo G. Silver in AL , VII (1935), 80-81. In the preparation of this article I am greatly indebted to the following: Mrs. Ogden Reid; Dr. David C. Mearns, Chief of the Manuscripts Division, The Library of Congress; the Rev. Patrick O'Brien, librarian of St. John's Seminary; and Professor Rollo G. Silver.</field>
