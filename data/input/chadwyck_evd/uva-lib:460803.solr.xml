      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. —The Council Chamber—The King discovered in Council. King. Props of our power and pillars of our State, Supporting of our government the weight, Like—I may say without offence—like bricks; To you King Gander turns, when in a fix, That as you in your wisdoms may think fit, You may advise him to get out of it. Min. My liege, as you sagaciously surmise, That is exactly what we do advise. King. What? Min. To get out of it without delay. King. But how? By what means? In what kind of way? 1st Councillor. Ere we decide, perhaps 'twill please your grace To favour us by stating first the case. King. The case? 2nd Coun. We can't well argue it without Knowing a little what it is about. King. Can't you? Why how, do other councils do That know no more of anything than you? Min. But we are not a common council, sire. King. Certainly not! 1st Coun. And if we might inquire— King. Well, it won't make much difference, and so The case is this. Some nineteen years ago I prayed for three fine boys my name to bear. Indulgent fortune granted my fond prayer By sending me three girls. 2nd Coun. Three graces! 1st Coun. Goddesses! Not to be matched in Iliads or in Odysses. King. The eldest, Princess Idelfonza, who Does nothing— Min. As a princess ought to do. King. The second, Babillarda, fair as young, But with no end whatever to her tongue. 1st Coun. But then so musical each word it drops, It may be called an organ— King. Without stops. The third—Finetta—who one happy morn, With a full set of wisdom teeth was born, So shrewd—so prudent—'tis our firm impression, That all her years have been years of discretion. Min. A fact almost to make one doubt her sex. 1st Coun. A fact to please you, sire; and not perplex. King. Granted; but there is yet to state another: Fate has deprived them of their royal mother; And when I go, as by my vow I'm bound, The Paynim foe in Palestine to pound, Like all the ancient Ganders of my race, Who shall protect them in their parent's place? How keep them from believing gay deceivers Whilst I am pummelling the unbelievers? Answer me that, ye Councillors, who can. Min. My liege, methinks I could propose a plan On which your Majesty might act with ease. King. Which is—? Min. To do whatever, sir, you please. King. Humph! that idea had occurred to me. What say you, Baron? 1st Coun. With humility, I differ from so learned an authority; No doubt I shall be quite in a minority— But still my sense of duty makes me dare, Dread sire, emphatically to declare That in a case—permit me the expression— A case, my liege, affecting the succession, You're bound to do—not as has been expressed, Just what you please—but just what you think best; And we, as loyal subjects, bending low, Are bound to think what you think best is so. King. Courageous Councillor! who ventures thus To speak his mind, and tell the truth to us! I'll follow your advice, sir, to the letter, And let me see the man who dares think better. Has any one another word to say? (all shake their heads) Min. They answer, nothing—in the usual way. The Council is unanimous. King. And so Am I. (they rise) Accept my thanks before you go, For having, after grave deliberation, Confirmed me—in my own determination. (Exeunt all but King) Though what that is, I have not quite decided. Kind fortune, who has every gander guided, Since 'twixt the legs of Jove one saved his life From old Philemon's hospitable knife, Be to an anxious father of some use, And to my goslings prove a— (Music—The back of the throne opens and discovers Mother Goose) Mother Goose! Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings! What would your gracious figure? Mother G. First of kings, In whom I've ta'en an interest for ages, Being a special pet of my own pages, I come to solace your paternal pains, And with my art supply your lack of brains. King. I feel the compliment. Mother G. I know you do. I read your thoughts, and could your mind look through. If you had one. King. I've half a mind, good mother, But can't quite make it up, some way or other. Mother G. Yes! to lock up your daughters in a tower! As if Dan Cupid hadn't got the power To make in adamantine walls a gap! Love laughs at locksmiths! King. That's a farce. Mother G. Mayhap. There's but one way the tempter to avoid; Keep head and hand in honest work employed. Idleness of all evil is the root. King. A fact established quite beyond dispute! I wrote it in my copy book at school; Mother G. Then make your daughters copy the same rule. King. A brilliant thought! 'tis plain whate'er inviting, They can't be wronging if they're always writing; I'll order in, of copy books, a van full, Hundreds of pens, of ink a mighty can full. Mother G. Nay, nay, though goose quills I must needs respect, Young ladies' hands they sometimes mis-direct. I'll keep them safer occupation in, The proper task of spinsters is to spin. (Music—Waves her crutch—Three Glass Distaffs rise through the stage.) (presents them) There is a precious gift for each fair lass. These distaffs are of fine cut fairy glass; Though force can make upon them no impression, They shiver at the slightest indiscretion. King. Odds bobs! they're ticklish tools for girls to handle! Mother G. But safeguards against violence or scandal. On your return, if they're produced unbroken, Of prudence you can't have a surer token. Farewell! upon my friendship reckon freely. (music—Mother Goose disappears) King. No fairy could behave much more genteelly. Astounding incident! But quick! time presses; Ho! some one—summon hither the Princesses. Enter Scharp. Scharp. One Princess comes unsummoned, gracious sir. King. 'Tis well! if so, you need not summon her. But tell the other two to bring their too— Too solid flesh to melt into adieu! (Exit Scharp) Enter Finetta. Fin. “Adieu!” in time I come, then. King. Ah, Finetta! Or, as thy mother called thee, Pin Basketta! Thou always comest apropos, my dear. Fin. It's apropos de bottes this time, I fear; For if the news be true about that's bruited, By glory spurred, you'll speedily be booted King. The tidings are authentic, daughter mine, Like brave Dunois, I'm bound for Palestine. Fin. And wherefore off to Palestine thus bustle men? King. We go to Palestine to fight the Mussulmen. Fin. But why to fight the Mussulmen, in fine? King. Because, my love—we go to Palestine. Fin. That is no answer, sir, my question to. What have the Mussulmen, pray, done to you? King. What have they done to me?—Good gracious, why? They have done—Pshaw! what can that signify? If people stopped to ask why out they fall, There'd be no fighting in the world at all! Suffice it that for glory I've a passion— Besides, “Partant pour la Syrie's” the fashion. Composed by Queen Hortense. It was substituted by Napoleon III. on his accession as Emperor for “Vive Henri Quatre” and the “Marseillaise.” Enter Scharp. Scharp. The Princess Babillarda. Enter Babillarda. Babil. Oh, papa! What's this they tell me—you are going to war? And not alone—which nobody would mind, sir— But leaving not an officer behind, sir, To chat or flirt with—it is much too hard. Not a young Guardsman to take off his guard— No Grenadier to form a forlorn hope with— No Light Dragoon a lady could galope with— To dance “The Lancers,” not a Lancer near us, And when we're toasted, no Hussar to cheer us! It's too bad—all our beaux off thus to walk too, And leave us not a single soul to talk to! I— King. Hold your tongue! Babil. I can't! I never could! And is it likely in this case I should! I've got a thousand things to you to say. King. Well, tell me all then—when I'm gone away. Babil. But— Song—Babillarda—Air, “Domino Noir.” I must to-day, sir, have my say, Before you go away; And so I beg you'll stay, And hear me, pray. For not a word as yet I've heard Of what has just occurred, That doesn't seem absurd, say what you may. If go you must for glory's sake, sir, There's no reason you should take, sir, All the nice young men in town, sir, Who don't care about renown, sir; And would rather here at home at soldiers play. It's folly, quite, to go and fight, When at your ease you might Be morning, noon, and night—says Mr. Bright. And I'd agree with that M.P., If folks would let you be! But then they won't, you see—despite advice: Yet still, I think, if you'd but send To them, some “honourable friend,” Who to practise what he preaches, Would do nothing but make speeches, They'd be glad to buy his peace at any price. King. Silence! Fin. Dear sister! Pray obedient be— Or, if you can't stop talking—talk to me. (they go up stage talking aside) Enter Scharp, preceding Idelfonza, Scharp. (announcing) The Princess Idelfonza! King. So! At last— You haven't made much haste! Idel. I can't walk fast— You know, papa, it puts me in a flurry. Where are you going, sir, in such a hurry? King. To Palestine, to gather laurels! Idel. Law! Why can't you gather laurels here, papa? Or send somebody—though it cost you double— To gather 'em and save you all the trouble? King. The trouble is a pleasure! Idel. Well, I vow, I can't think trouble pleasure—any how. King. You must be taught to think so, daughter. See Here are three distaffs. (Finetta and Babillarda come down) Idel. There then let them be King. Nay, they are presents from a learned friend— There's one for each—and, girls, you may depend During my absence you'll find great enjoyment In this serene and primitive employment. Babil. I spin! King. Why not? you love to spin a yarn. Idel. You'll tell us next our stockings we should darn. Fin. Nay, sister, history, and fable show Princesses used to spin some time ago; And Babillarda knows such occupation Is no impediment to conversation. Babil. Well, that's some comfort certainly and though— King. Let me get one more word in, ere I go, And then talk till you're tired, if you can. Idel. Let me sit down, then, there's a dear good man. For I am tired. (sits) King. Hear me, girls, all three! Through these glass distaffs you don't clearly see. They have been made by magic. Three Princesses. Magic! King. Magic! And your ends may be tragic. Three Princesses. Tragic! King. Tragic! If by misconduct you should chance to break 'em! Babil. Then what a shame of you to go and make em! King. I didn't. Fin. No, he told us just before They're made by magic. Pa's no conjuror! King. Not I! But to proceed. They will protect you Whilst you behave as prudence should direct you. But if you swerve the least from her dictation, You'll find 'em brittle as your reputation. Babil. Do you suspect us, sir, of— King. Heaven forbid! But I shall treat you just as if I did, And upon this score to feel quite at ease, Make you your own “material guarantees,” By wisely locking up the stable door, Not after the steed's stolen—but before! Babil. What! Lock us up? 'Twill be my death, sir! Fin. Pshaw! Papa's not going, child, to lock your jaw. With work and books it won't be so distressing. Idel. Well, I shan't have to move, and that's a blessing! Babil. And where's this hateful prison, pray, to be? King. In the Round Tower, which I go to see Prepared for your reception. You safe in it, On my own tour I set out the next minute. Quartett—King, Babillarda, Finetta, and Idelfonza—“Goosey Gander.” King. Like a gallant Gander, Ere hence I wander, You three I'll see Safe in the Tower yonder. Three Princesses. If any young man Drops in unawares?— King. There's a policeman Ready, if he dares! To take him by the right leg, Take him by the left leg, Take him by both legs, And drop him—down stairs. All. Like a gallant Gander, Ere hence I/he'll wander You three/Us three I'll/He'll see Safe in the tower yonder. (Exeunt King and Princesses.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. —Exterior of the Round Tower. Music—Workmen enter, and employ themselves in fixing a crane and pulleys (to which are attached a rope and basket) to Tower—Stone-masons enter with materials for walling up the door, Grand Chamberlain superintending. Air and Chorus—Grand Chamberlain and Workmen—“Bartlemy Fair.” Come bustle, boys, about, It is time you'd all cleared out; Get the crane and pulley ready, And the basket to make steady, Select a very sure rope. Don't the balance lose of your rope, Or you'll find it an awkward affair, O! Work away—no delay Scrub and burnish—paint and furnish; By the drumming, the King's coming? If he find you all behind you Will sing, hey down, ho down, Derry derry down, To a very, very different air, O! Flourish—Enter Peasants, preceding Guards, Pages, Ladies of Honour, then enter the three Princesses, with their Pages, and the King, attended by his Minister and Councillors. King. The hour is come, when from my dearest daughters I must depart for foreign country quarters, But first secure 'gainst Cupid's artful dodgings, I'll place you in genteelly furnished lodgings; You'll find in them your own linen and plate, And as upon yourselves you'll have to wait, There'll be no extra charges for attendance. Idel. And upon what, sir, can we place dependence, For board, as well as lodging, pray? Babil. I hope You'd not have us depend upon a rope! King. No, not without a basket at the end on't. But by these simple means you may depend on't, You'll be provided with three meals a day, “Provided always,” as the lawyers say, You turn a button you'll find in the wall, As you would have the basket rise or fall. I've given strict orders to my Major Domo, And he alone, of all the genus homo, Will have with you intercommunication— All persons else by Royal Proclamation, Are warned from coming even near this spot, On pain of being sent to instant pot. Babil. Only the Major Domo! Cruel whim! But I may say whate'er I please to him? King. Whate'er you please, without the slightest fear, For he's as deaf as the door post. Babil. Oh dear! But shan't we be allowed to take the air? King. Upon the top you'll find a garden fair, Laid out in plots, where you may walking go. And laugh to scorn plots laid for you below. Thus, armed at all points, do I take my leave. Fin. 'Tis too late to prevent you, I perceive, You've ta'en your place already in the mail, And fate alone has power to turn the scale. King. True! But although I've steel'd this manly breast, To which, for the last time, perhaps, thou'rt pressed, While all the father in my bosom warms, I feel myself again a child in arms! (weeps) Snivelling! O shame! A Gander and in tears! Brush off fond drops, and you, my pretty dears, Brush in. Three Princesses. Good-bye, papa! (the King embraces them as they pass—then all Three Princesses enter the tower) King. Farewell! Once more! They've entered! Men of stone, block up the door! (Masons busy themselves in building up door) Adieu, my people! When I'm far away, Remember me, and punctually pay Your taxes. You'll be gratified to learn They will be doubled until I return— Which, though of parting it increase the pain, Ensures you joy to see me back again. Strike up, my drums, and let my trumpets bray! Like a good knight, I wish you all good day! (March—Exeunt King, followed by Minister, Councillors, Guards, Pages, Ladies, Peasants and Workmen) Babillarda appears at window of tower. Babil. Heigho! What will become of me now! There Is Idelfonza sunk in an arm-chair And half asleep already—sister Fin In her own room has gone to sit and spin, No mortal creature, not e'en a poor bird, With whom I can exchange a single word. Well, I must talk then to myself until Somebody passes, but nobody will! The horse patrol would stop 'em on the high road, And this bye-road is not a passing-by-road. Yet sure there's something moving on it now! Is it a man, a donkey, or a cow? It's an old beggar woman, I declare! Who looks as if just come out of Rag Fair. Music—Enter Richcraft, as an old woman, with basket and long string of ballads. Babil. Here, here! Good woman! What have you to sell? Rich. Ballads, my pretty mistress. Babil. Ballads! Well I love a ballad in print. Have you many? Rich. Three yards of songs, miss—forty for a penny— Here's “Old Dan Tucker,” “Will Watch,” “Nelly Bly,” “Love Not,” “Hot Codlings,” “Coming' thro' the Rye.” “Long ago,” “Mary, I believe thee true,” “I'd be a Butterfly,” “Red, White, and Blue,” “Pop goes the Weasel,” “Far upon the Sea,” “When the wind blows,” “Then you'll remember me,” “Cheer, boys, Cheer,” “On the Banks of Allan Water,” “Gentle Zitella,” “The Ratcatcher's Daughter.” Babil. Oh! the Ratcatcher's Daughter! How I should Like to hear that. Pray sing it. Rich. That I would, But I'm afeard to stop so long, my dear, I'm told they'll hang me if they catch me here— Couldn't you let me in? I'm old and poor— Order your porter, pray, to ope the door. Babil. Order our porter! We've no porter here, To order—if we wanted it—our beer; No door to open, if we had a porter, They've gone and blocked it up with stones and mortar. Rich. Oh! dear! To take me in, find some way, do, I'd try to find some way to take in you. If you've no servant, you'll want one, no doubt— And if you'll let me in, I'll serve you (aside) out. Babil. How can I let you in, when— Rich. What's to hinder Your winding me up safely to the winder? The basket I see hanging to that pulley, I'm pretty sure would hold me beautifully! Babil. I never thought of that! The very thing! What fun to trick papa! But where's the spring? Oh! this must be it—yes; down goes the basket; My explanation's ready if they ask it— I've but obeyed his Majesty's commands, To take up any one found on these lands. Say when you're ready. (Richcraft steps into the basket which has descended) Rich. Now then—that will do, Haul up! (aside) And 'twill be soon all up with you. (Music—The basket ascends with Richcraft— when it is level with the window, Babillarda helps him in, and the scene changes to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Third —The Garden on the top of the Tower. Enter Babillarda, followed by Richcraft (as old woman). Babil. One more step, and you're at the top. Rich. I'm glad To hear it, for my breath's so very bad. Babil. Sit down, and take some fresh then—for, no doubt, You couldn't sing conveniently without. Rich. Who was the lady fast asleep below? Babil. My eldest sister, Idelfonza. Rich. Oh! But you've another sister, I've been told. Babil. Oh, yes, Finetta! Won't she fume and scold, When she finds— (Richcraft goes to alcove and leaves basket) Enter Finetta, followed by Idelfonza dragging a camp stool. Fin. Ha! my fears then were too true! Babil. (aside) Oh, my! she's here, and Idelfonza too! Idel. Why, Babillarda! who on earth's this stranger? Fin. Who let her in? Babil. I did, and where's the danger? Fin. There's always danger where there's disobedience. Babil. Folks shouldn't drive one, then, to such expedients. Fin. Your indiscretion will be punished—see Your distaff's broken! Babil. So it is—dear me! When could I break it? Fin. When you broke your word. Babil. I never gave it, so don't be absurd. Fin. Alas, more mischief may be brewing! Babil. Stuff! Don't preach. I've done it, child, and that's enough. What mischief can this poor old body do, I should just like to know, to me or you? I brought her in to wait on us. Idel. Delightful! The thought of waiting on one's self is frightful. Babil. Besides she can sing songs, and so amuse me! If you don't like it, you can go. Fin. Excuse me, I shan't leave you such company alone in. Babil. Well, I don't care, if I'm not left my own in. So sing, good mother, and don't mind her prosing. Idel. Yes, do sing! it's so pleasant while one's dozing. Rich. What shall I sing? ugh, ugh! I'm rather hoarse. Babil. Oh, “the Ratchatcher's Daughter,” dame, of course. Rich. D'ye know the song? Babil. I know the air—no more. Rich. Then you have never heard these words before? Song—Richcraft—Air, “The Ratcatcher's Daughter.” Not long ago there lived, somewhere, A king who had three fair daughters; But he didn't quite like to leave 'em there, While he went t'other side of the waters. The father smelt rats, for he'd often caught flats, A prowling about his quarters; So packed up snug, in a sort of stone jug, Were these purty little Flatcatcher's Darters. Singing, Doodle dee, doodle dum, Didum doodle da. Chorus, Ladies—Doodle dee, &amp;c. But Cupid is a downy cove, Wot it takes a deal to hinder; And if you shuts him out o' the door, Vy he valks in at the winder. So one day there came a poor old dame, Who all in rags and tatters, By an artful dodge, got into the lodge Of these purty little Flatcatcher's Darters. Singing, Doodle dee, &amp;c. Now I have heard since, that a rich young prince, Who had come from a foreign land, O, Laid a wager that he, out of one of the three, Would inveigle her lily-white hand, O. So in this disguise, he flung dust in the eyes, Of the girls wot he was arter; And like a sly fox, spite of bolts, bars, and locks, Bolted off with one purty little Darter. Singing, Doodle dee, &amp;c. Rich. In plain prose, I'm the hero of the story, And thus fling off the mask, like gay Count Ory. Music—Richcraft throws off his old woman's disguise— Babillarda screams and rushes off, followed by Finetta— Idelfonza, who has gone to sleep during the song, is aroused by the scream, starts up, and is about to follow, but Richcraft intercepts her. Rich. Fly not, sweet princess! Idel. I don't want to fly; It's so much trouble, but perforce must try. Rich. Wherefore? Idel. Because 'twould be great impropriety, For me to stay alone in your society. Rich. Oh, say not so! For you alone I came, For you alone I've played this desperate game! You are alone the prize I have in view. Idel. Leave me alone, then—and be quiet, do. Rich. Not till my passion moves you to compassion. Idel. It bores me to be moved in any fashion— Besides, how can you talk such trash to me? It was my sister you came here to see. Rich. What, Babillarda! That eternal chatterer, Who, to call magpie, would but too much flatter her! No; 'tis the sloe black of those sleepy eyes! 'Tis Idelfonza that I idolise! 'Tis the delicious languor of that air That laps me in Elysium! Matchless fair, I am a Prince—of money I have plenty, And love, like you, the “dolce fa niente.” Of slaves you will possess a countless band, Besides your humble servant, to command. And you shall sit as long as daylight lingers, Twiddling, in graceful ease, those fairy fingers. And you shall have not only naught to do, But your own time to do it in! Idel. 'Tis true You talk this well! Rich. By Heaven, I'll do this, lady! Say but to marry me that you are ready— I've lords in waiting, who in ambush tarry, To carry you off, if my point I carry. Idel. Somebody must, for I will ne'er be married Unless to church, at any rate, I'm carried. Rich. You shall be, in a litter! Idel. Really! Shall I! You don't mean what you say? Rich. Yes! Liter-ally. Idel. Well, I suppose I ought to ask papa. Rich. But then your father's gone so very far, And never may come back again, I'm told, And by that time we should be both so old. Idel. Well, you may take my hand, then. Rich. Rapture! thus, Upon my road to bliss, I take a buss! (Music—As he kisses her, the Glass Distaff she carries at her girdle flies into pieces.) Idel. Ah! There's my distaff, now, gone all to shatters? Rich. (aside) That's number two! (aloud) Well, dearest, and what matters? Idel. Not much, I grant, for I should never use it. Rich. (aside) Now for the third! Time flies! I mustn't lose it! (aloud) The sun is going down, and so must I, To call my friends up—off with you to hie! Rest in this bower till 'tis time to start. Idel. Oh, I'll rest anywhere with all my heart. (aside) He really is a charming little man! (goes into alcove) Rich. (quickly shutting the door and locking it) I have caught you, now catch me if you can! Song—Richcraft—Air, “Like the lightning.” Like the lightning, or as slick as grease, I fly to conquests grander, And, please the pigs, I'll cook the geese Of all the race of Gander! I'm aware that time is fleeting, But I can't avoid repeating, That like lightning, or as slick as grease, &amp;c., &amp;c. (Exit Richcraft)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fourth. —A Room in the Tower—Door in centre with staircase leading to upper part. Finetta and Babillarda appear at opposite entrances. Fin. Ah! Babil. Ah! Fin. It's only me! Babil. It's only you! Are you quite certain? Dear! what shall we do? Fin. Where's Idelfonza? Babil. Haven't the least notion; So limited her power of locomotion, It's possible she's still just where we left her. Fin. And of her life that wretch may have bereft her, Following us, I'm sure I thought I heard her. Babil. Let's up stairs to the window and scream murder! Here she comes! No, she doesn't! It is the man! Where shall we fly to? (Exit Babillarda) Fin. You fly where you can! I will not budge a foot! This Tower shall fly From its firm base as soon as basely I— Though I've not here Clan Alpine's warriors true, I'll do exactly as did Roderick Dhu! For, as like him, I stumbled here some sacks on, I fortunately laid my hand this axe on. (takes axe from wing and conceals it behind herself) Song—Finetta—Air, “Di quella. Pira.” Let him appear, ah Shan't he get toco For yam as surely As I stand here! On his base marrow-bones I with this cleaver, Will “Con fuoco” Play without fear! Yes, from this chopper He'll get a topper; And since with oper- —A plots he makes free, While of “Count Ory” He apes the story, “Il Trovatore!” This bold air gives me! Enter Prince Richcraft. Rich. So here you are at last! I've had some pains To find you, Princess. Fin. If you've any brains Move not a step, or I shall solve the doubt By trying if I can knock any out. Rich. With what? That distaff? You'll excuse my grinning— Fin. No, something that will set your head a spinning. Behold! I have a weapon! (brandishing axe) A small toy Left in a corner by some chopping boy, It has cut blocks as thick as yours. Rich. The deuce! You wouldn't make of it so bad a use; To gain that hand these brains I have been taxing. Fin. You'll find my hand's not to be had for axing. Rich. But hear me, Princess! Fin. I can hear you there. Where's Idelfonza? Rich. I don't know or care. You are the idol that I worship! Fin. How? Rich. 'Pon honour! Fin. Poh! I know your worship, now, And doubt your honour. Rich. You know me! Who am I? Fin. My father's deadly foe—Prince Richcraft! Rich. (aside) Demme! Fin. Of old King Fogrum, eldest son and heir. Rich. Discovered! Then I'll candidly declare Since I'm found out, that I am Richcraft, and Delighted to find you at home—your hand. Fin. Not without this! Some mischief you intend. Rich. No, with our union let all discord end! Say you'll be mine, and of your father I Will henceforth be the good and true—ally. Fin. (aside) Exactly! (aloud) After such a declaration There may be grounds for some negotiation; I will despatch a letter to my father And let you know his answer. Rich. Let me rather Have yours at once. Fin. But I am not of age, And can't against his will my hand engage. I am a minor. Rich. Say, an under-miner, Though you're a fine girl, you will find me finer. I'll wait for no man's will, so don't be silly, Mine you must be, proud Princess, willy-nilly! Lay down that axe while I am yet pacific; And drive me not to acts much more terrific. Fin. (aside) I'll feign a little female hesitation. (aloud) Grant me a short time for consideration. Rich. I will. It shall be short, as you implore; I grant you just five minutes, not one more, If still you hesitate you'll to your cost Prove that the maid who hesitates is lost; You can't imagine how uncommon funky You'll feel, if once you quite put up my monkey! Song—Richcraft—Air, “The Campbells are coming.” Not e'en Gordon Cumming—oh, oh, oh, oh! Not e'en Gordon Cumming—oh, oh, oh, oh! Has e'er seen a lion, That you mightn't try on, More safely your humming—oh, oh, oh, oh! No tiger Van Amburgh had ever to dare, No bear ever petted by Labarriere, Was half so ferocious, rapacious, atrocious! So, madam, I'd have you beware, beware! (Exit Richcraft) Fin. What's to be done? Not Richcraft, I'm afraid; He is a keen, though badly-tempered blade! Oh, my poor distaff! Quite of spirits I'm out, You won't be wanted now to spin the time out! But till the spinsters three my thread shall sever, To hold you harmless I will still endeavour! Heyday! how's this? It made me quite spin round, And makes a point of pointing to the ground— (trap opens) And a trap opens in it, and displays One of those horrid cells of other days, Called “Oubliettes,” because when in they let you, Though they would ne'er forgive they'd quite forget you. This opens a new prospect of success; To make it work, I've but this spring to press; Though Richcraft is a very downy chap, He may not be quite up to such a trap; And if he's not up to it—he must be Down in it—ere he can be down on me! I hear his step—quick! let me set the trap for him. (touches spring and trap closes) There! it's all right! and I don't care a rap for him! Re-enter Richcraft. Rich. Time's up! Am I to count on your axe-cession? Fin. Sir, I surrender at my own discretion; I lay my arms down (flinging axe away) and present my hand. Rich. On ceremony, then, no more I stand, But thus— (Music—Springs forward to seize her hand, but the moment he steps on the trap he disappears) Fin. You fall! Victoria! That's a case, I hope, of the right man in the right place! Recitative—Finetta. The plot was deep!—the plotter now lies deeper! Babillarda! Enter Babillarda. Duet—Finetta and Babillarda—“Il Trovatore.” Babil. Oh, joy! I scarce can trust my eyes! Alive I thus behold you; And no “alarming sacrifice,” To him who thought he'd sold you. My tongue, in vain, for utt'rance tries, I want words, I declare, dear, A want in me so rare, dear, It adds to my surprise. Fin. “Full fathom five,” the traitor “lies,” Like—I forget whose—father; Those mayn't be “pearls that were his eyes,” But he a purl had—rather. Babil. Huzzah! Fin. Away, away! if most unwise To let him in you were, dear; I've let him in, just there, dear, Much more to his surprise. (Exeunt)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fifth. —Exterior of the Tower—(Night). Music—Enter Wolf and Wurm, cautiously. Wolf. Hush! Wurm. Silence! Wolf. Soft! From yonder turret high Methought I heard—Nothing! Wurm. And so did I. Wolf. No signal! Then I fear Richcraft's success Will not be signal. Wurm. I suspect, no less. Wolf. Within the Tower, all's as dark as pitch! Wurm. There's something darker rising from that ditch! Richcraft, covered with mud, rises slowly out of the ditch. Rich. (faintly) Wurm! Wolf. It's old Bogie! And he's come for you! Rich. Wolf! Wurm. Oh! It must be! For he wants you too! Rich. Knaves! Don't you know!—the Prince— Wurm. Of Darkness! Oh! Rich. (advancing) Fools! I'm Prince Richcraft! Wolf. Eh? You don't say so? Wurm. His Highness! Is it possible? (they both go to assist Richcraft out of ditch and lead him forward) Rich. Too true! Wolf. All over black! Rich. I grieve to add—and blue! Wurm. How came you in this pickle—pray explain? Have you been up a flue? Rich. No, down a drain! Wurm. Into the Tower, then, you never stole? Rich. Oh, yes! And went completely through the whole. Flung through what oft has lost a man his station, A story utterly without foundation! The mud I fell in only broke my fall, But I have spoiled my clothes, both great and small. Wolf. Take comfort, sir, and change them. Rich. Never! No! Like to the Pontic Sea whose icy flow Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but still goes on tick, By rushing up the spout to the Propontic Without a change—even so, behold, I swear This jacket and etcetras to wear. Till I have washed the stains out in a flood Of blood! By Jingo! Blood! Blood! Blood! Blood! Blood! Wurm. Whose—gracious sir? Rich. Finetta's That false fair's— If all her hairs were lives— Wolf. First, catch her hairs! Rich. In course! So hounds!—I let you slip, and woe Betide you, if you let her slip, also! Wurm. Footsteps! If it should be the bobbies! Run! Wolf. It's but a booby! (looking out) Rich. Then you're two to one, And where he twice a booby—quite his match. Wurm. It's a King's messenger, with some despatch. Rich. Dispatch him, then! First knock him gently down, And then we'll hear—the message from the Crown. Music—They retire—Enter a Messenger—He approaches the Tower, and raises a horn to his mouth, but before he can sound it he is knocked down by Wolf—Wurm takes a letter out of the man's pouch, and hands it to Richcraft. Rich. A letter! But of light there's not a spark! Wurm. (at back) I've got a lantern, though it's rather dark. Rich. (takes lantern—breaks the seal of letter and reads) What do I read? My eyes deceive me, surely! King Gander has been taken very poorly, And feeling in his head a sort of dizziness, Is coming home on “urgent private business.” See Preface. Accursed chance! Wurm. A happy chance, sir, rather. Let's give Finetta this note from her father,— 'Twill lure her out. Rich. O, mischief! thou art quick, To enter into heads, however thick. With speed about it! Doff your cloak and cap, And put on those belonging to this chap; Then fling his body in the ditch there plump, (Music—They act accordingly) Now, take his horn, and blow it like a trump. (Wurm blows the horn—Finetta appears at the window of Tower—Richcraft and Wolf retire) Fin. What means that mournful blast, mysterious stranger? Wurm. Madam, your royal father's life's in danger. Fin. My father's life in danger! Is he ill? Wurm. Dying! but can't die easily, until He see his darling child, Princess Finetta. Fin. What proof of this? Wurm. An autographic letter. Drop me a line, sweet maid, and, by return, The truth you in a line from him will learn, Fin. You'd get me in a line, insidious knave! I much suspect this is some barbarous “shave.” Wurm. I shave a lady! Not with softest soap. Fin. Send up the line, then—and beware the rope! (Music—She lets down the basket—Wurm throws the note in it—Finetta draws up the basket, takes out the note, and reads it.) My father's hand. I can no longer doubt! But the seal's broken!—how came that about? Who dared to ope this scroll, thou, naughty elf? Wurm. His gracious Majesty's most royal self. He wanted to add something, but he couldn't, And so, on second thoughts, he thought he wouldn't. Fin. How like the circumspection of his race! Wurm. O, hasten to receive his last embrace. Fin. Where is he? Wurm. Hard by, in the wood; no further Could he bear carriage? To delay is murther! Fin. I come! (Music—Finetta gets into the basket and descends) Wolf. (aside) We have her! Rich. Seize the jade and gag her. (as Finetta steps out of the basket, they obey Richcraft's order, by throwing a cloak over her head) Call up your fellows! O'er the border drag her! (Wolf hurries out with Finetta) Would she had forty thousand lives, that I Might forty thousand ways to take 'em try, Or that she had but nine lives, like a cat— But as she has but one, I will take that In such a way, that no cat of nine tails, Could ever raise of woe, such horrid wails. Get me a barrel, stick it full of spikes, So sharp, nobody ever felt the likes! In it I'll cram the baggage like a ball, And roll it down the Brockeneckerthal! Once off, she'll find her way to the bottom. Mizzle! (Exit Wurm) On the hot gridiron of hate I grizzle! Vengeance, be thou my Lord Mayor; at thy feast, See if I don't just make myself a beast. (Exit Prince Richcraft)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Fourth. —Summit of a mountain—Wolf, Wurm, and other Attendants of Richcraft enter with Finetta prisoner. Wolf. Of Gander's kingdom we're safe o'er the border, And there's the pit to which she'll have an order. Fin. Are ye banditti? If so, name my ransom, My father is a king, he'll come down handsome. Wolf. Will he? If that's your hope it is but small, 'Twould'nt be like his Majesty at all. Fin. Answer my question, man of features grim! Wolf. Here comes his Highness, pop it, ma'am, to him. Fin. His Highness!—this low mudlark? Enter Prince Richcraft. Ah, Prince Richcraft! Alive, and out of limbo! This is witchcraft! Rich. No, traitress! Deep the craft through which I fell, But here is trap for trap, and sell for cell. Fin. No traitress I, but double traitor thou, Who to two sisters equal love could vow. Rich. For equal love read henceforth equal hate; For know I found out in the “Book of Fate,” And sticking sundry pins in fortune's wheel, Thy father's kingdom fallen “en quenouille” Would with my father's to some other pass By one of those three distaffs made of glass; If indiscretion caused them not to snap. Two are in two— Fin. Too sad is our mishap. But yet there is a third thou canst not harm While I am wide awake. Rich. Despair thy charm! And let old Mother Goose who manufactured The distaff, tell thee though it mayn't be fractured, Richcraft will still be of the crown a winner, By breaking all to bits the artful spinner. Fin. Upon the wheel? Rich. No, in a novel way. (Wurm beckons on Men with barrel, the inside of which is furnished with steel spikes, hooks, &amp;c.) Invention is the order of the day, And here is my new organ of destruction, To which you shall have speedy introduction. Fin. A barrel organ! Rich. Yes, to grind your bones At every turn it takes over those stones. (Men take barrel up the mountain) You needn't be afraid of falling out, The spikes in it will hold you fast no doubt. Fin. What, chuck me down the mountain? Rich. Yes, my chuck. Not long ago you made me run-a-muck, Now I'll see how you like it, my fair lady! Fin. I'll not be cast down. Rich. You look so already. Fin. Will no just lightning singe this dirty dog's head? Mercy! Rich. No, you shall go the entire hogshead! (Music—He drags her up the mountain) First let me see though, there are spikes enough in it, Before this dainty bit of goods we stuff in it. Music—Richcraft mounts on a piece of rock and looks into the barrel, Finetta tipping him over—He falls into it, and the barrel rolls down the hill and disappears, amidst the cries of the Attendants, who rush after it, leaving Finetta to run out unperceived. Wurm. (on rock piece) Stop! Stop him! Ha! Upon a rocky shelf He has been good enough to stop himself! If it had only rolled another yard with him, Over those stones it had gone very hard with him. Music—Re-enter Wolf and the rest, bearing and surrounding Richcraft, insensible. Wolf. Gently, boys, gently! Here's a sad disaster, In a rude spot where there is no court plaster! Of opodeldoc, not a drop to use! No spermaceti for an inward bruise! Wurm. If you are dead, sir, speak, and tell us so! Rich. (slowly reviving in arms of Attendants) I think that I may venture to say, no. (Attendants set him down) Of stout bull's hide my under jerkin, tough, Kept those vile spikes from working my own buff. But oh, my back! (they rub him) Upon the other side! Where is the minx? I'll have her sliced and fried! The very thought a thrilling joy diffuses, Like Friar's balsam, over all my bruises! Wurm. Sir, without warning she has dared to quit again. Rich. Finetta 'scaped! Ah me! then comes my fit again; And all my pains return—because I've lost 'em! Who let her 'scape? their dog's ears it shall cost 'em! Wolf. We couldn't run two ways at once. Rich. That's true. What's to be done? for something I must do, To bar that fatal prophecy's fulfilment. Wurm. Administer some “leperous distilment!” Some “juice of cursed hebanon in a vial!” Wolf. Or some new pill, that “only asks one trial!” Rich. Ha! I remember a low sort of shop, Where they sold peppermint and lollipop, And lozenges in boxes by the score, With this inscription o'er them “cough no more.” I gazed upon the things, red—green—and blue, And others of a still more sickly hue; And thought if one for poison had a whim, There lived a seedy chap would sell it him; And prove the truth that brief inscription bore, For in his coffin he would “cough no more!” Ha, ha! I feel unnaturally merry! Wurm. (to Wolf) I think his head's a little— Wolf. (to Wurm) I think—very. Rich. My brain is overtaxed! Oh, yes, I feel Fate has surcharged me, and I must appeal: They have assessed my wits in schedule D, As if wit ever was a property! Now they're distraining on them, I'm done brown. An undone brother sits upon my crown, And takes away the use on't! And my scept- Re—changed to the distaff which Finetta kept, Is lost and gone! Hah! fiends to Pluto's region Have come to drag me! Though you were a legion, Aye, e'en the Foreign Legion, thus I'd fall Among you, and—and—over-reach you all! Music—The Retainers rush off alarmed—business of “Sir Giles Overreach”—Richcraft sinks into the arms of Wolf and Wurm, and they bear him off—Scene closes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE SEVENTH. —Interior of King Gander's Palace— Flourish and shouts without—Enter King Gander, leaning on his Minister, and followed by his Councillors and Pages, bearing his helmet and shield. King. Thanks, countrymen! Thanks, loving friends Alack! You're always glad, I know, to see me back! What! (to Minister) Have the Masons made my daughters free Of the Grand Lodge, in which we lodged all three? (loud knocks heard) Min. My liege, e'en now they're knocking at the door. King. It's no use knocking at it any more, For here, I take it, are our daughters come. Min. But one, and she is looking rather rum. (Exeunt Minister and Councillors.) Enter Finetta. King. My child! Fin. He lives! And I've a parent still! How fares my gracious father? King. Not so ill, But that we might be worse, yet not so well, But that we might be better. Fin. Tell, oh, tell Thy daughter all. The worst, oh, let me learn! I fear small profit from this quick return. King. You may be a false prophet. Fin. Aye! indeed? But you were indisposed? King. Yes—to proceed— Thou shalt know all! Yon moon which rose last night Round as my shield— Fin. Which is not round. King. Not quite, Had not quite risen, when with great long bills, A band of fierce barbarians from the hills, Rushed on my gallant host. My warriors fled For safety and for succour. I, instead, On bended bones—familiarly called marrow, For quarter sued. When lo! a young cock-sparrow Flew to my rescue with his bow and arrow. Fin. A young cock-sparrow! Surely not the sparrow That killed cock robin? King. No, ingenious child! Not the winged hero of that legend wild, But a young stripling, fair as early dawn! We fought and conquered ere a sword was drawn! Fin. Oh, speedy conquest! King. Interrupt me not! I made a vow, if off scot-free I got, One of my daughters should become the bride Of that brave youth, and wear my crown beside— When I have done with it. Fin. And who's the man, sir? King. I asked that question, but received no answer, But I will know who my deliverer is— He comes. Music—Enter Prince Belavoir. Fin. (aside) Oh, Cupid! what a charming phys— Iognomy! If he be marrièd, My grave is like to be my wedding bed. King. Young sir, I think you said you were a knight, Bel. I'm a knight-bachelor. Fin. (aside) So far all's right King. You want a wife, then? Bel. Frankly, I declare, I want just such an one as I see there! King. I have two more such, and have sworn that you Shall take your choice. Bel. Oh, then allow me to— King. Allow you two! Bel. To take her, this choice fair. Her eyes are load-stars, and her tongue's sweet air, More tunable than lark to shepherd's ear. King. Why, you've not heard it. Bel. No, but long to hear. With one sweet syllable my ear then bless, And let that sweet one be your sweetest yes. Fin. Sir, first my sisters let me beg you'll see, They are much handsomer indeed than me; If, after that, you still should press me so, It is just possible I mayn't say “no.” King. (embraces her) Still of thy sex discreetest, wisest, best— But ah! I had forgot the magic test, Thy distaff! Fin. (aside) Heavens! King. Thou hast it not? Ha! say! Is't lost? Is't broken? Fin. No, over the way! I left it in my haste to fly to you. King. Fetch it! Fin. I will! (aside) What will my sisters do? Ah, here they come, and all must out 'tis clear! King. She hesitates! Bel. What mystery is here? Enter Princesses Idelfonza and Babillarda, the former has Finetta's distaff, which she holds behind her. Babil., Idel. Papa! King. Before I answer to that name, Your distaffs! Idel. (shewing Finetta's) Here is mine, sir! Fin. Oh, for shame! Babil. (to whom Idelfonza has passed the distaff unseen by the King) And here is mine—and here is yours, Finetta, We brought it for you. (giving it to her) Fin. Come, that's rather better. King. Humph! Here's some sleight of hand! Fin. (aside) I feel a feather Would knock me down. King. Shew all three, both together! Present arms! Two are absent! Wretched sire! Fin. (aside) 'Tis done, and all the fat is in the fire. King. Who is the owner of the one unbroken? Babil. Well, then, sir, if the truth must needs be spoken, It is Finetta's. But my fault was small. Idel. And I did nothing, sir, I'm sure, at all. King. Both guilty! Six months with hard labour, you. (to Idelfonza) For you, the silent system! (to Babillarda) Fin. Oh, sir, do Forgive 'em, I implore you, for my sake, Or else their little hearts they next will break; They've saved the pieces, let that make their own. King. Well, for your sake, but yours shall be my throne, And as I've sworn, your troth you now shall plight To this illustrious and renowned knight, Sir Something—Thingumbob—zounds! What's your name? Your patronymic you must now proclaim; For though your modesty mayn't care about one, You can't be asked in church, you know, without one. Bel. I dread to name my name, yet must, I know; I am the son of Fogrum, your old foe. All. The son of Fogrum! King. Richcraft! Bel. No; the other— Prince Belavoir, his poor and younger brother; Turned out of doors by that insidious sinner, And forced to go a hunting for a dinner. Babil. The brother of that wicked little man! Idel. Oh, no; it can't—oh no; it never can! Fin. My only love sprung from my only hate, To early seen, unknown, and known too late. King. O, fatal vow! The son of my worst foe— The poor one, too! Consarn it—here's a go! This bitter pill is far too big to bolt; And yet, my honour! Shall a Gander moult One feather of his white, unsullied fame? And for a name—a name—“What's in a name?” Yet reputation's called, by the same poet, “A bubble!” 'Sdeath! I could almost say, blow it! (a trumpet sounds without) Somebody has blown something. What's the row? Enter Scharp with a scroll. Scharp. A letter for the unknown stranger. Bel. How? For me? Art sure of that, sir? By what sign? Scharp. There's no name on it. Bel. Then it must be mine. (reads) Ah! can I credit what is herein stated? My brother dead—my father abdicated! The people call me to the vacant throne. King. My son-in-law!—the son I'm proud to own! King Belavoir, Finetta is thy queen. Bel. The future, now, will sure be all serene. Fin. (aside) O, happiness, I feel too great to last; By his shade I cast over—overcast. Song—Finetta—“The Tempest of the Heart”—Il Trovatore. Though 'twas in self-preservation That I threw his brother over! Still I dread his condemnation, When the truth he shall discover! So to me joy brings no gladness— Pleasure wears the dress of sadness; Mem'ry with a spoon, like madness, Stirs the tempest in my heart. Quintette—King, Gander, Finetta, Babillarda, Idelfonza, and Prince Belavoir. Recitative—King. Away! Prepare A banquet rare! Babillarda—“Polka”—Allary. Who'd have thought it? Cunning little puss! Here's for the Court Circular a pretty piece of news, dear! Our youngest sister married before us, At the wedding we shall have to dance without our shoes, dear! Idel. Why about the matter rave? It don't seem to me so serious; I don't dance, and so shan't have To go without my shoes. Fin. (aside) Wherefore am I pestered thus, With presentiments mysterious! In the midst of all this fuss, I tremble in my shoes. King and Bel. Here's a splendid day for us; I with joy shall go delirious! All my woes are banished, thus! By this glorious news. (Exeunt)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Eighth. —Gardens of the Palace by moonlight—Bank, alcove. Enter Prince Richcraft, enveloped in a mantle, carrying a scroll. Rich. After a long succession of short fits, I have got back a small part of my wits; Only again the lot well nigh to lose, At hearing this extraordinary news! My father has resigned his crown in favour Of Belavoir; and that smooth-faced young shaver Is going to be married to Finetta, And so heal up the deadly old vendetta. This is the fun fate's book was at me poking; But fortune's wheel I still may put a spoke in. I've hoaxed my brother with a billet-doux— He thinks he's coming here to bill and coo; And now, that upon horrors he may sup, I'll act the ghost, before I give it up; E'en such a ghost, so pale, so woe begone, As I have seen another brother warn. For a costume, to me now most accessible, The loss of mine, being all but inexpressible; (throws off his mantle, and appears in his tights and white shirt, like the Ghost in “The Corsican Brothers”) In this attire, upon him gently stealing, I'll try to work on his fraternal feeling. If I can but persuade the simple elf To kill Finetta—he will kill himself. Lo, where he comes, in mood the most romantic! Now to look Corsican and Corsicantic! (powders his face, then resuming his mantle steals behind a tree) Enter Prince Belavoir. Bel. In a sweet note, than note of wood lark sweeter, My love, by moonlight begged alone I'd meet her. I thought she seemed something to have to say Too tender to be told by light of day. This is the spot—the centre of the grove; There stands the oak, and there a snug alcove. (Richcraft groans) What sound was that? 'twas like some yawning grave That teems with an untimely ghost; or cave Through which winds squeeze, like courtiers at a levée; No matter what: and yet my heart feels heavy. (seats himself on a bank in front of the oak) Music—Richcraft comes from behind the tree, as the ghost does in the last scene of “The Corsican Brothers,” and touches him on the shoulder. Bel. (starting up) Kings, Queens, and Ministers in place defend us! Be thou my brother, or a fiend they send us? Bringing with thee an air from the Princess's, In the most questionable of un-dresses. I will speak to thee, ask thee, what's the matter? Oh, answer me! and tell—who is your hatter? That thus bare-headed he can let you go; Say, why is this? wherefore do you do so? Rich. Mark me! Bel. I will, if you touch me again! Rich. Bully me not! I rise, sir, to explain. I am thy brother's spirit! Pray desist From asking questions, and list, list, oh list! If ever thou didst thy dear brother love. Bel. I can't say you were over and above Affectionate to me; but never mind, You're dead, and I forgive you. Rich. Well that's kind. Bel. What can I do, pray, to oblige you further? Rich. Revenge my foul and most unnatural murther! Bel. Murther! Rich. The most unnatural ever seen. Bel. Haste me to know it then, that I, as clean As a new broom, may sweep to my revenge. Rich. Swear! Bel. By my head! Rich. Swear harder! Bel. By Stonehenge! Rich. That's hard enough; now hear—'tis given out, That slipping on a mountain here about, I cracked my cranium; but that's rank abuse; For know that she who cooked thy brother's goose Would share thy crown. Bel. Oh, my prophetic soul! Finetta! Rich. Aye, she gave me such a roll! Oh, brother! what a falling off was there! But soft! methinks I scent the morning air! (music—piano) So, as I always was—brief let me be! Adieu! Adieu! Adieu! Remember, She! (Exit Richcraft) Bel. Remember she! I wish I could forget her! But I have sworn—and off I must not let her— She's here! Confusion! I've forgot my dagger! Back to my chamber for it, I must stagger! But though her gruel, I am bound to give her, I'll take another oath—I won't outlive her! (Exit Prince Belavoir) Rich. (who has peeped and listened) Hurrah! The work goes bravely on! I've tricked him! And here, in good time, comes the other victim! (retires) Enter Finetta. Fin. Some mischief's in the wind.—Some wicked folks Have played upon my Belavoir a hoax. I found a little note he dropped, inviting Him to meet me here—but 'tis not my writing— My mind misgives me! It is only Richcraft Who could be up to anything like sich craft— So for myself I've brought a substitute— (goes to wing and returns with a milliner's doll's head and dummy figure, dressed like herself) And trust once more to circumvent the brute! Song—Finetta—Air, “Meet me by moonlight.” I'll meet him by moonlight alone, And then I will tell him a tale Of a tub, which I managed, I own, To tumble down into the dale. I must say, if Richcraft's not dead, That he certainly ought to have been; But no more on that—or this head, Till the object more clearly I've seen, Of this meeting by moonlight alone! Lie there, my double! (placing figure on bank) If there's aught to dread, This plan must surely bring it to a head. Meanwhile to foil my foe, and guard my love, I'll bide the issue in this dark alcove. (hides in alcove) Re-enter Prince Belavoir, with a dagger. Bel. What would make some men drunk, has made me bold! I've drained a full pint of “Tom,” called “the old,” And now I must fulfil the pint of honour! Lo! Where she sleeps! I dare not look upon her! (stabbing the doll, as he turns away his face) Thus! thus! I keep my oath! (Finetta screams) O cruel brother! Thou art avenged! Rich. (aside) One's gone! Now for the other! (retires) Bel. I swore I'd not survive her, and I won't! Thus! thus! I follow thee! Eh! No I don't! (looks at the dagger, which has changed into a bunch of roses) What potent power my stern will opposes? My dagger's changed into a bunch of roses! Rich. (advancing) The deuce it is! And I have none to lend him! Fin. (entering) And if you had, I'm here, sir, to defend him! Bel. Finetta living! Yet Finetta dead! Fin. I backed myself, and beat him by a head! Mother Goose enters. Mother G. Yes, but there's few can beat me at a tale, So I'll wind this up! Fin. I hope without fail! (music—Mother Goose waves her crutch, and the scene changes to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Ninth. —Fairy Palace of the Golden Eggs. Fairies discovered at back—one Fairy in centre with three glass distaffs—The Princess Babillarda and Idelfonza, with King Gander, Minister, Councillors, Guards, Pages, and Ladies of Honour discovered. Mother G. (joining the hand of Belavoir and Finetta) Here crown'd and wedded happy may you be. Rich. Well, but I say, what's to become of me? Of crown—of queen—of vengeance all bereft. Mother G. Without 'em for the moral you are left. Rich. I! Well, I shan't be the first rogue of quality Who at the last has taken to morality; (to audience) We've all been guilty of a deal of folly, But then it was to make our young friends jolly, And teach them, too, some lessons often told, But not at all the worse for being old; And first the Author owns he's made strange use, Of these thrice golden eggs of Mother Goose: But you'll observe he humbly hopes and begs, Some reason in this roasting of her eggs. As idleness of evil is the root, So safety is, of prudence, the rich fruit; We've not been idle, that I think you'll own— Whether we have been prudent will be shewn By your decision; if a kind one, we To golden eggs shall change the distaffs three! Finale—Air, “The Ratcatcher's Daughter.” Fin. At Christmas time, whate'er the rhyme, It should convey a moral; For giving you a piece with two, With us you will not quarrel. So may distress, through idleness, Ne'er make your children smarters; But prudence still ensure success To your pretty little sons and daughters. Singing, Doddle dee, &amp;c. Babil. The “Yellow Dwarf” to Easter ran, And a very long time arter; And our Princess may do no less, If you'll but kindly start her; Then from east and west, come here, and just Make these your winter quarters; And every night, we'll strive to delight, All your pretty little sons and daughters. Singing, Doodle dee, &amp;c. Rich. Wych Street's not fur from Westminster, As you come up the Strand, O; And here we are, at Temple Bar, With the City close at hand, O. There are busses vot run to Islington, And t'other side of the water; So we trust you'll bring, every mother's son, With his purty little father's darter. To sing, Doodle dee, &amp;c.
