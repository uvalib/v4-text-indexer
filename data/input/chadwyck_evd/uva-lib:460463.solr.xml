      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. TO MISS WALLIS,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by John Litchfield, Esq. Spoken by MR. MACREADY. LONG hath the Tragic Muse, in secret mourn'd Her pow'r abus'd, her empire overturn'd, Her sacred laws in mixt confusion tost; Her rights insulted, and her virtues lostâ Her children long profess'd, dispute her reign, Deserting her's to hold her Sister's train. âNo griefs sublime now swell th'impassion'd breast, âArray'd in Truth's, or flowery Fiction's vest; âNo melting tear now swims in sorrow's eye, âNor terror screamsânor pity vents the sigh. âTime was, when Genius struck the plaintive lyre, âAnd Fancy lent her intellectual fire, âWhen Poets rais'd the sympathetic strain, âAnd claim'd Compassion's tearânor claim'd in vain,â The changeling Fashion now disdains to pay Her sullen tribute to the serious lay; While cold and impotent our Authors move, And scorn to wake or pity, fear or love, By secondary means they strive to raise The paltry meed of meretricious praise; With flags, spears, helmets and processions rise, âPride, pomp and circumstanceâ of scenic strife, To storied deeds of bold emprize they lead, An army conqueredâor a nation freedâ Prompters and properties their pow'rs unite And drum, fife, trumpet, rouse the mimic fight. Hark! here a chargeâthe trumpetâthere retreatâ A victory hereâtattooâand there defeat. Thus action bustle is, and passion rage, As Bards decree, or mightier Chiefs engage; While as the fight grows warm, the Pit are froze, The Audience shiver as the Actor glows. âNor more the Verse has cunning skill to wind âThe secret springs that agitate the mind: âHigh rais'd on stilts, in measur'd Prose, it creeps, âWhile judgment sickens, and while fancy sleeps; âNor pause of thought nor passion's vivid glow âDisturb its studied but unmeaning flowâ âMonotonous and dull the periods roll, âAllure the ear but leave untouch'd the soul. âNature, howe'er, is never all the same, âIn multifarious forms she makes her claim, âExpression varies as the Passion turns, âSoftens with love or with resentment burns.â This night, a Bard, to different views inclin'd, Demands the tribute of the willing mind; Happyâif such his enterprizing art, To waken feeling, and to touchâthe heart. What time the policy of German Rule Fetter'd the native freedom of the soul; When superstition held her sanguine state, And dealt, at will, the rapid blow of fate; The world beheld all pledge of safety gone, And even Monarchs trembled on the throne. Judges, with functions unconfin'd and free, At midnight issued many a dark decreeâ The culprit once condemn'dâa numerous Band Of secret Agents, hunt him through the land; Nor age, nor character, nor kin have force, To stay their barbarous unrelenting course; Bound by an oath th'avenging steel to draw, Guilt became piety, and murder Law. Britain! rejoiceâThe envied pow'r is thine, To punish malice, and to thwart design; Open as day our Courts judicial move, And Rich or Poor their equal influence prove; Rejoice! Your upright Juries make you free, Bulwarks of Fame, of Life and Liberty. To you, our Author now submits his cause, Unbiass'd guardians of dramatic laws; Guilty or notâthere rests at once his all, For by you Verdictâhe must stand or fall.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Holstein's House. HOLSTEIN and ELLEN. HOLSTEIN. Although now past the exercise of arms, And in inglorious ease condemn'd to waste The brief remains of lifeâMy fancy ranges With our brave Prince th'experienced files of war, And paints him governing the course of battle; Beholds him strike the opposer to the ground, And aids his pity to relieve the fallen. ELLEN. Heaven's grace preserve him to his happy people! I grieve no welcome waits on his return, Where it would charm the most, upon the brow Of our beloved Duchess. HOLSTEIN. Her complaint, Yields it not then to time and medicine? Has Ida lately been here from the Palace? ELLEN. Not latelyâfor our lovely child has gain'd So warm a seat within the generous breast Of our dear mistress, that she seems to live But while her duteous services are paid; And every help is minister'd by Ida. HOLSTEIN. Danger may lurk beneath such proud distinction. The favourite of a Prince is doom'd to feed On hollow smiles, and envious adulation: To raise, or to repulse, alike are fatal; He rears ingratitude that will supplant him, And all whom he repells are sworn his foes. ELLEN. Yet when her Highness sought the lovely child, Struck by her beauty, innocence and youth, Could we refuse her? HOLSTEIN. No, I mean not that. But still my fondness aches for her return. And, when the healing power shall deign to bless, With former health, my royal mistress, then, I will entreat her to restore our darling To those, whom quiet shuns, while she is absent. ELLEN. But see, the nephew of Duke Wirtemberg; The gentle Herman comes in haste from Courtâ I hope his tidings are thus wing'd by comfort. Enter HERMAN. Health and the lengthen'd happiness of life, Attend my much rever'd and valu'd friends. HOLSTEIN. We feel this honour sensibly, my Lord. May we indulge a hope, your aunt recovers? HERMAN. We flatter still ourselves with the belief; And what we pant for credulously coin; But the physicians fear herâall the aids Of science, and the many-breathed prayer From holy lips, yet keep her from the skies. The lovely Idaâ ELLEN. Is my daughter well? HERMAN. She suffers but in sympathizing woe. Her fondest greeting, to each honour'd parent, Salutes you by my tongue.âShe longs to see you. ELLEN. We've taught ourselves, to bear a tedious absence, From which the slightest good results to one, To whom we most owe duty and affection. HERMAN, My valiant friend, if now your leisure serves, I could desire some private speech with you; If not, I'll wait a fitter season. HOLSTEIN. Sir, I am entirely your's. My dear your leave. ELLEN. Adieu, my Lord. [Exit. HERMAN. I will not waste a moment In idle preparation of my suit. Thus speaking with the frankness of a soldier, I lay my heart plainly, at once, before you. The gracious Ida, your most beauteous daughter, Has here inspir'd the most unbounded love. HOLSTEIN. Unwelcome tidings! O, my fears presag'd this. [aside. HERMAN. I could not reconcile to manly conduct A close clandestine furtherance of my passion; To her most honour'd parent, I address me, Court his indulgence, bow to his decision. HOLSTEIN. Young Prince, is this a time for such a theme, Ev'n were I prone to listen to the honour, When sickness menaces the throne itself? HERMAN. Spare this reproach, for even there, my friend, Passion collected fuel to the flame, And love illum'd his torch at pity's shrine. I saw my Ida, like some angel, tend The pillow of disease, whose pallid brow, Flush'd at the comfort, which her care bestow'd; While she, unwearied, all relief declin'd, And seem'd th'embodied soul of consolation. HOLSTEIN. Excuse me, if I hear no more, young friend, Your candour has my praiseâis worthy of you. I have a debt, like you, to open dealing. My obligations to the Duke, my master, Forbid my countenance, where his is wanting. If he object not to your lowly choice, I can find nought but honour in the union. HERMAN. My friend, my father, take my fervent thanks. Ever indulgent, the thrice gracious Duke Will never frown upon my chaste desires. Adieu! may every bliss descend upon you, That I have power to wish, or you enjoy. [Exit. HOLSTEIN. Fare you well! rash and inconsiderate youth! Such is the nature of that hour of prime! The bud of young desire shoots unsuspecting, Touch'd by the genial gales of ripening time; Regardless of the wayward blasts of winter, That smite the evening of a day all sunshine; Blighting the unguarded bosom of the flow'r, Whose form then withers, and its sweets expire. [Exit. SCENE, The Palace. Enter RATIBOR. The promis'd day of power at length dawns on me: One daring step will seat me on a throne. The Duke returns but slenderly attended, A band of brave associates shall assail him, And rid me of my only bar, this Brother! Curse on my mind for conjuring up that term! To that word prejudice and folly join Sensations, deadly to ambition. And yet, fraternal discord is as common As any rebel passion of our natures, And the first blood, that stain'd the new-made earth, Envy shed forth, and by a brother's hand. But see, where Ida comes to still this tempest. Enter IDA. My Lord, your sister charg'd me to enquire, If your Grace knows when to expect the Duke? Alas, I fear he will arrive too late, And find his angel wife a speechless corse. RATIBOR. Your fears, dear maid, outrun all likelihoodâ With her physicians I have held some converse, And they incline to give me better hopes. IDA. My Lord, my constant view of her condition Forbids me to indulge such grateful thoughts. Her patient temper yields not to complaint, But all the healing art will ne'er prevail, If symptoms may be known of dissolution. RATIBOR. O mis-becoming terrors! Think ye not The presence of her husband will dispose Her drooping powers to happy renovation? Trust me no cordial to the heart has force Equal to him, whose image it enfolds. IDA. This I can well believe. RATIBOR. And why my fair one? Has any suitor yet upon thy heart Impress'd indelibly his gay perfections? This is a perilous spot for youthful beauty. IDA. I am unconscious of such indiscretion. RATIBOR. The soft confession of your eye denies The coy reserve that lingers on your tongue. I had expected, to a friend like me, Not youthful, and thus fit for confidence, A warm eulogium on some favour'd swain. IDA. At whom thus points your Grace? RATIBOR. Perhaps at Herman. He has discernmentâYou have youth and beauty. It is, as I suspected. (aside) IDA. Sure, my Lord, You do not deem your handmaid so presuming! The Prince is dearly amiableâbut I, Born in an humble sphere, attract not him. RATIBOR. O disregard the difference of rank, Love levels the distinctions of the world, And raises up the Peasant to the Prince. Perhaps your beauties have obtain'd an interest In rank to his superior farâI've said it. Your prudence will digest the hint at leisure. Say to the Dutchess, that my royal Brother Has left the camp, and will be here to-morrow. At some, not distant period, loveliest Ida, I shall demand your private ear awhile; Adieu! a splendid lot awaits you. [Exit. IDA. (Curtesies low, and arises with an expression of terror.) How! Did I hear rightly? What said Ratibor? Interest obtain'd in far superior rank! It is too clearâO my beloved Herman, What fiend has started thee so dread a rival? Enter HERMAN. My love, if ent'ring now, my ears deceiv'd not, I heard my name, and coupled with a rival! Give me the cause of that alarming junction. IDA. O Prince, I beg you leave me to my fate! I was not fram'd to be the sport of greatness; And, little suited to its flowery bands, Suffer me to obliterate the past, And fly distinction, that would make me wretched. HERMAN. What sudden change is this? O tell me, Ida, Speak clearly, instantly, lest my despair Dash your fond victim senseless at your feetâ Thou said'st I had a rival! Who is he? Give me the wretch's hated name, that I May dare him to contest his claims with me, And rid you of the suitâ IDA. Of Ratibor. HERMAN. My uncle! then indeed I find a rival, The most pernicious that my mind could image! His influence with the Duke, and more his power As a chief member of that dreadful band, Who judge in secretânay the constant hate Which spite of artifice, I know he bears meâ All call for double vigilance against him. IDA. O, Herman, why should I excite a contest, Where most I wish for harmony and love? Let me retire, and peace will be restor'd. HERMAN. No, I disdain the creeping timid prudence, That gives up honour to make sure of safety. To your dear father, I have frankly pleaded That passion which must govern all my life: By him referr'd where most I owe allegiance, I'll trust to goodness which has ever flow'd From Wirtemberg upon his favour'd Herman. [Exeunt. A gloomy Vault. RATIBOR enters. Since I have form'd this bold design, a cold And aguish tremor shakes my very flesh, And my heart heaves at every noise around me: When the alarm subsides, a chilly dew Bathes all my limbsâAnd yet it is'n't done! How when he falls beneath the hireling dagger? A diadem! will that repay these shudders? The essay may soon be made, for here comes Rudolph. Enter RUDOLPH. (Dressed as a Member of the Secret Tribunal.) My Lord, I wait your ultimate directions. The sums of gold have silenc'd every scruple; Your Brother dies, had he a thousand lives. RATIBOR. Name not the hated tie to me, good Rudolph. The troops, you say, are well dispos'd and readyâ His way lies through the wood that skirts the town; There then assault him; and, remember, friend, Transfix the body to some blighted oak, And leave the weapon there; the deed will then Seem the just vengeance of the Secret Judges, And none will question the proceeding further. RUDOLPH. Not of a Prince so slain? RATIBOR. Art thou to learn The pow'r by the invisibles possess'd? Which makes the Emperor tremble on his throne. And, through this country more especially, Judges and punishes in secresy. He is a heretick, the slave of Huss, And therefore blotted from the breast of love, Devoted to destruction. RUDOLPH. Deem it done. I shall acquaint you how we speed to-morrow. RATIBOR. Rudolph, remember, I expect your haste; Exchange your dress, and come strait to my chamber. RUDOLPH. Ere noon, my Lord, expect me. [Exit. RATIBOR. Fare you well. Would he had led me hence! fie on these terrors! O guilt, that, seeking to conceal its purpose, Flies to a spot, that aggravates the horror! If any one should cross me in my path, Would not my trembling limbs betray my purpose? O, who can banish night, and talk down conscience? The beams of day and revelry combin'd May dissipate this sickness of the soulâ And then ambition crown'd! There's comfort still. [Goes off in alarm. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Wood. Enter DUKE WIRTEMBERG, and Train, assaulted. [Exeunt. Re-enter RUDOLPH, With his sword drawn and bloody. Curse on this failing handâthe Duke escaped! The country soon will rise, and vengeance reach me. I dare not trust to Ratibor's protection. Let me then fly! Enter HERMAN. Who talks of flight, the noise, That echoes through the wood, speaks some attack, And this man the assassinâyield thee, slave. [They fight, in the scuffle both are disarmed, and Herman takes up Rudolph's sword, who rushes off with Herman's.] His sword still stain'd with blood is in my hand! Has treason dar'd attack our gracious Prince? Here lay his path, and I had hope to meet him, And so prepare him for the mournful visit. Let me inspect this weaponâgracious Heaven! Upon the blade I read a legend plainlyâ âRegiment of Ratibor.â Ungrateful villain, Thus to conspire against a brother's lifeâ But hark, what noise! SOLDIERS, PEASANTS. SOLDIER. This way th'assassin fled. Ha! this is he! assail him friends, the wretch, Whose sword is recent from the bloody strife. 2d SOLDIER. Yield, or thou dy'stâ HERMAN. How, Soldiers! know ye not Your Prince, 'tis Herman you assault thus rudely. SOLDIER. Herman! forgive me, Sir, we find you here, With most suspicious circumstance attending; You must submit, and go hence to the castle. HERMAN. I mean not to dispute your order, Soldiers, Nor here explain myselfâBefore the Duke I may disclose a mystery of horror. SOLDIER. Your sword, my Lord. HERMAN. Aye friend, be sure you keep it! Unwip'd tooâ'tis your only testimony! And may confound a traitor. To the Castle! [Exeunt. SCENE, RATIBOR'S Apartment. He sitting, with a book. By this the deed is done! how still the Palace! Rudolph will soon be here to tell me all! He dies then, and the black tale dies with him. This can seal down the most loquacious tongue. [Shews a poniard.] My brain now akes with expectationâO! The foot, that brings ambition to his aim, Should be as swift as the keen northern wind, And as invisible! I'll read awhile! In vain! my eye courses o'er words and words, From which no meaning strikes the wand'ring mind. How, if he fail!âI hear a noiseâHe comes! How weak was my alarm! (triumphantly) Enter WIRTEMBERG. Well Rudolph? ha! my brother! Wirtemberg! WIRTEMBERG. I wonder not at your alarm, my brother, To see me thus, by miracle I think, Sav'd from the swords of an assassin band, Who rush'd upon me, as, with slender train, I journey'd through the wood. RATIBOR. You bleed, Sir, Are you not hurt? WIRTEMBERG. But triflingly, I think. Thanks to this mail within my outer garment. The villains wore the habit, as it seem'd, Of the associates to our secret Judges. They might mistake me for some chief proscrib'd, And thus attempted to inflict the sentence, Which, usually, in unfrequented tracts, Strikes the lost victim. RATIBOR. Rather say, my liege, Some traitorous attempt to cut you off, And instigated by a hidden foe. WIRTEMBERG. I do not think I have one; for my power Has still pursued alone my people's good. Where is my nephew Herman? RATIBOR. Did he not Return with you? He went, he said, to meet you, And I fearâ WIRTEMBERG. Speak plainly, brother, Has Herman's conduct giv'n you ground to think? I tremble to enquireâHe hesitates!â Unnatural boyâI lov'd him like a parent. RATIBOR. Sir, you outrun my fears, they pointed not That way, although of late his conduct much Is chang'd for dissolute and unbridled manners. But who comes thus in haste? Enter SOLDIER. My liege, I grieve my duty bids me speak, A most unwelcome truthâOur young Prince, Herman, We o'ertook near the place of your attack, With his sword drawn and bloody.âHe demands To speak, in explanation, 'fore your grace. RATIBOR. What, has the devil work'd him to my toils? This is beyond my hopes. (aside) WIRTEMBERG. Accomplish'd villain! Tell him, in me, his interest is gone. Let him address himself unto our brother. O, poison to the soul, obdurate vice, Let but ambition touch the chords of feeling, The strings relax and shrivel in the blaze, And nature's stifled in the unnatural fire. Dear Ratibor pity me, and take the seat Of judgment more impartial than my own. [Exit. RATIBOR. Bring up the Prince, and then attend without. [Exit Soldier. How! found so near, and thus a combatant, Belike that Rudolph perish'd by his handâ But he approaches. HERMAN. Where's the gracious Duke, To whom my explanation is address'd? RATIBOR. His pow'r's in me, to bring thee to thy answer. HERMAN. Answer to thee! to a malicious foe, And one, who, if appearances were righted, Should stand suspected, not as I do wrongly. Dar'st thou to breathe a doubt of my true love? Look on meâshake not in the judgment seat. RATIBOR. An humbler tone would better suit the guiltless. Wert thou not found, as they report the fact, Near to the spot, where they attack'd the Duke, And thy sword stain'd with gore? HERMAN. And this is true, But yet you must not thence presume to think Me the assassin. RATIBOR. Yes, and I accuse thee, That, mov'd by hellish malice, thou hast suborn'd A band of ruffians to assail the Dukeâ HERMAN. O that this arm were not now weaponless! But what still hinders, naked though I am, That I should rush thus on thy coward frame, And trample calumny beneath my foot. RATIBOR . (stamps with his foot.) Enter SOLDIERS. Seize him, and bear him hence to close confinement. HERMAN. Hark thee, thou very wretchâAt the Tribunal Where I shall meet this charge, I'll tell a tale Shall blank the impudence of accusation. Till then, take my defianceâfor I know thee. [Exit guarded. RATIBOR. 'Tis well, that threat has arm'd me, The Tribunal! But I may cut thy pleadings briefly boy. Rudolph is slain, and known by him perhapsâ I'll send to seek the body instantly. Re-enter WIRTEMBERG. From the sad couch of exquisite disease I turn to listen to ungrateful treason. Bear with me brother, if this tide of evil O'er pass the manly boundaries of temper. How brook'd the villain your interrogation? RATIBOR. As I expected, with outrageous fury: Like some fierce savage struggling in the toils, Whom the alarmed hunter views at hand, He rush'd in powerless rage to seize my person; The summon'd guards compell'd him then to prison. WIRTEMBERG. What urg'd he nothing in his mere defence? RATIBOR. Nothing; but on my head recrimination. Unspotted truth makes malice impotent. My personal wrongs shall not invade my justice. WIRTEMBERG. Give orders straight to bring him to his trial. Now to my suffering love, o'er whom the dart Of death yet menacesânot long in vain. Though bred to horrors, in the school of battle The soldier studies the grim tyrant's art, And speculates innumerable wounds; Restor'd to thy soft reign domestic peace, He deeper mourns than others the decree, Which tears his consolation from his arms. [Exit. RATIBOR. Matilda must not liveâshould she recover, A mewling Mammet might at length start up And step between me and my promis'd good. That Badendorff has prov'd a genuine leach; Has pledg'd himself to push her from the verge, If long she linger.âHe shall be my physician. No, hold you thereâhis conscience is too supple; Another might outbid for his prescriptions. [Exit. SCENE, a Dungeon in the Castle. Enter ULRIC, and then HERMAN. HERMAN. Come friend, conduct the innocent to prison. Let murder and ambition roam at large, Stab in the day, and none avenge the deedâ I ask'd but to be heard, and was denied. ULRIC. Dear Prince, yet moderate this useless rage. All that the limited authority I have, can give you, gratitude supplies, However end the cause that now confines you. HERMAN. My comfort is, that I shall meet that fiend, Where justice strikes the guilty. ULRIC. I am order'd, By no means to confine you rigorously; Your friends may have access to visit you. HERMAN. Ulric, I think thy friendship is a blessing, Which no surmise alone can ever shake. Wilt thou entreat the lovely Ida hither; Her counsel will sustain my resolution. ULRIC. I will dear Princeâand suffer no intrusion. But I'm preventedâlo, she comes to seek you. [Exit. Enter IDA. Where is heâlet me clasp him to my heart! Away with coy and maidenly reserve, Let modesty be bold when virtue suffers! Have they writ there on that ingenuous front The assassin's title?â'tis to blaspheme nature, And make apocryphal her sacred text.â HERMAN. Bear witness, gods, I joy in this disaster! It has procur'd for me more genuine transport, Than years of unsuspected life had giv'n. Were I to die, I should depart in peace; Thy love would waft my spirit into bliss. O my soul's only hopeâI've much to tell thee! I've been betray'd, and deeply wrong'd, my Ida, Even by the villain who conspir'd this treason. IDA. I heard the vague reports, how thou wert foundâ Your sword too recently embath'dâ HERMAN. My sword, O, no! the sword the soldiers found upon me Was none of mineâI met its flying master; Engag'd him, in the scuffle we exchang'd Our weaponsâthen the assassin fledâthe sword, Which had been his, upon my nearer view Express'd its owner, âOfficer to Ratibor.â That circumstance must never pass our lips, Until the judges call for my defence. IDA. And can you thus securely wait a trial? HERMAN. The innocent know no alarm at justice. IDA. Not, when, in midnight secrecy and silence, Judges disguis'd mysteriously decide, Unknown, unseen, the terrors of mankind!â I think my feeble frame would die with horror, And find a grave ere prejudice could doom me. HERMAN. Think not, my Ida, their decisions partialâ Their eyes are every whereâunseen they hearâ Their agents mingle in the walks of life, And even our servants are their secret spies. IDA. Still Justice should not mask her awful face. O, if there be a land, where equal laws And open judgment are the claims of all, Where those of our own rank pronounce upon us, There true decision calls on punishment, Temper'd in anger by enthroned Mercy. HERMAN. The vision lifts my soulâand thou my country, May'st ere long emulate the âIsle of Glory.â But with thy forms, however harsh they seem, The good man will comply. Still art thou just. IDA. But are we sure, you ever may abide them? He who could find a poniard for a brother, May not await the uncertain march of judgment. Ah then, my Prince, fly from assassination, Fly to the humble mansion of my father, Now while thus slackly guardedâ HERMAN. How, my Ida, Will that not be presumption of my guilt? IDA. To Wirtemberg at first perchance it mayâ But, public summons to appear once issued, You can explain your flight before the judges. HERMAN. Sure heav'n inspir'd that thoughtâI yield me to it. Thy love shall nerve me to the prudent toilâ IDA. O would my wish could give Herculean power! Chains should be gossamer that clasps the rose, And the strong fortress as the yielding corn, Through which the light roe bounds her airy way. HERMAN. Farewell, my loveâbe large in hopeâ IDA , (embracing). Farewell! [Exit. HERMAN. Now to explore my prisonâere the morn I shall be free at least from private wrong. O, how prevailing are love's arguments! Light of my soul, accomplish all thy work! [Exit. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A Superb Antichamber. Enter RATIBOR, and to him IDA. IDA. Sir, your attendant signified your pleasure, I should thus come before you. RATIBOR. Not so, fair one. He did my thoughts injustice, if his tongue Gave to request the language of command; For I am here the suppliant. IDA. My Lord! RATIBOR. O chace that wint'ry scowl of cold reserve, It ill requites the fervour of a lover. When last we met, I ventur'd to present A hint for your mature considerationâ Shall I be more explicit now? IDA. It needs not. On such a theme I cannot, will not listen; I beg I may returnâmy aid within, By this is wanted. RATIBOR. Stay, for I command you. IDA. Command! am I awake? Is this the Palace? RATIBOR. Off with this flimzy veil of admiration. Hear me speak plainlyâYour ear may not be tun'd To accents ruder than a traitor whispers; Your gallant lover, the guilt-spotted Herman. IDA. And dost thou dare to talk to me of treason? Thou whose dark soulâbut I forbear thy portrait. He is too amiable for thy enduranceâ Too near a crown not to alarm thy envy. RATIBOR. Am I thus brav'd, and for a vile assassin? IDA. O, that he had thee in some desert wild, Without one bravo's sword to shelter thee! Where the keen vulture waited for the vanquish'd, To prove upon thy heart the sland'rous falsehood! RATIBOR. Truce with this high heroic flight, and mark me. His life is in my power, and you may save it. IDA. O teach me how, and though thou hast ensnar'd him, I will endeavour to forget the wrong, And honour thee for mercy shewn at last. Behold, I kneel and supplicate your pity. Youth may have led me too precipitatelyâ RATIBOR. Who triumphs now? Arise, and hear the terms, The only terms, on which I deign to save him. Teach thy coy charms compliance with my willâ IDA. Not for the wealth of worlds. RATIBOR. The villain dies. IDA. Inhuman! is this love? Behold my transports! Feast on the agonies that shake this frame, And glut thee with my groans.âCurs'd be my tongue For the mean supplication it has fram'd! No, I will not implore. Possess me now The black and silent horror of despair. RATIBOR. Fantastic, changeful sex! in mad extremes By boiling passions still to tempest tost; And the light shallow bark of reason flung At random o'er the waves, engulph'd and sunk. I half disdain the prize I will atchieve. Enter ULRIC. My Lord, pardon, I pray, this bold intrusion. Herman has in the night escap'd from prison. IDA. Hah! RATIBOR. Let pursuit be madeâstay, no, retire. [Exit Ulric. IDA. Now monster, I defy theeâHe will meet His judges in the perfect spirit of truth, And bring home to thee all thy black delusions. The hand of Heaven is stretch'd to disappoint thee. [Exit. RATIBOR. One way this flight may serve me. It conveys A clear presumption, that he dreads a trial, And furnishes to bold and dextrous heads, The means to render his defence suspected. Now to acquaint the Duke of his escapeâ His spouse dispatch'd, and Herman in my grasp, The failure of one blow may be repair'd, Then minion thou shalt feel me. [Exit. Holstein's House. HOLSTEIN following ELLEN. HOLSTEIN. Would I had listen'd to my boding heart, Nor suffer'd Ida to have left our roof! Danger surrounds her now in every shape; That fancy cannot aggravate the peril. ELLEN. Speak plainly to my eager apprehensions. What menaces my child? Dear Sir, inform me. HOLSTEIN. I have been listening to such things, my Ellen, That a wild chaos overpowers all thought. The Prince, our Herman, now is close confin'd, Suspected to have been the vile assassin, Who, arm'd, assail'd the Duke within the wood. ELLEN. O, he is innocent. I would be bold To hazard even salvation on his truth. HOLSTEIN. I think no lessâbut truth may be betray'd, And innocence by foul insidious arts Wear the apparent garb of guilt. Yet worse, To his accuser, Ratibor, the Duke Consigns the charge of bringing him to judgment. ELLEN. The gracious Prince himselfâ HOLSTEIN. Is one engross'd And swallowed up by griefâsilent he sits By the pale spectre of his wedded joy, And trembles like the Flamen, who beheld The sacred flame but glimmering to expire. ELLEN. All power then rests in Ratibor, his brother. HOLSTEIN. Yes, and the knavish herd have found the fact. Their hypocritic sympathy with grief, Pass but the door that bounds the royal presence, Is chang'd to smiles and bows, that silent speak A lesson to the greatness which they flatter. ELLEN. But see, one comes in haste; the Prince, 'tis Herman. Enter HERMAN. Are we alone, good friends, quite unobserv'd? I would not subject those I love to censure For the kind shelter which I must implore. HOLSTEIN. You are quite private; and command your servant; This caution, Sir, informs us you have fledâ HERMAN. Not from the judgment, but the assassin's dagger. I had remain'd a thoughtless sacrifice, But clear conviction from your Ida's tongue Taught me the peril, urg'd me to escapeâ With patient effort I unfix'd the bars That grated the high window of the dungeon, And by the aid of a strong coil of rope, Which from a rack I took within the cell, Descended to the baseâthe fosse was dry; Night and the silence of my lonely work Eluded the high centry's cold observance, And I arriv'd, I think, by all unnoted. HOLSTEIN. What is your object, Prince? HERMAN. To wait citation. When the dark summons of the secret judges, Calls me to answer for imagin'd treason, Immediately I will present myself And hurl confusion upon Ratiborâ Till then I must request your house's shelter. ELLEN. I will myself prepare for your concealment; And, while you stay, attend alone upon you. My heart bleeds for you, in this dreadful business. HERMAN. Grieve not thus over-much the proof of virtue. The faithless bark, whose planks are rotted through, Sinks at the first rude buffet of the gale: But the tough timber'd lanch, with heart of oak, Stems the loud torrent, and repells its surge, Bearing in billowy triumph for the shore. [Exeunt. A Gothic Chapel. A Statue of Herman's father. Enter RATIBOR. This feign'd devotion and continual prayer Work wonders on dull Grief's credulity. Sorrow ne'er plucks the napkin from the eye, To scrutinize for tears, but counts them there, And numbers sighs of weariness for woe. How soon our terror lessens!âI who ere while Shook at the phantoms of my idle brain, Now plot destruction ev'n before the shrine. Behold! the frowning front of Herman's father! How solemn and majestic, how severe! On me he bends the gazeâof senseless stoneâ I'll look on it no more. Enter a VERGER. My Lord, a letter. RATIBOR. I'm not to be disturb'd. From Badendorff! 'Tis well my gentle friendâI pray you leave me. [Exit Verger. Reads. âTo the Lord Ratibor. âAll is accomplish'd. âThe deadly mixture is by your command âInfus'd, and Ida ministers the draught. âEre this your sister dies. (Signed) âBadendorff.â 'Tis wellâshe sits not near my heartâSoft, soft! What were it best to do with that gay fugitive, Herman? I have itâHe has broken prison! That bespeaks guiltâI will forestall his sentence. What if, without a slow deliberation, I wrote the secret order for his death, Pretending to have born it from the judges: It shall be so. [He steps to a table and writes. Stay, who shall execute it? Ulric, for that I think he favours him And suffer'd his escape, bound by an oath, Which even demons shudder when they hear, I'll punish by entrusting with the charge. By my appointment he should now be here. And see, he comesâUp paper for the presentâ Enter ULRIC. My Lord, in strict obedience to your will, I come to learn your pleasure and perform it. RATIBOR. I look'd, Sir, for no lessâDo I not know thee, Most zealously attach'd to the Tribunal, So that, whate'er its high decrees enjoin'd, Thou would'st perform the bidding! ULRIC. Gracious Sir, I hope no act of mine has made it needful Thus to remind me of my obligations. RATIBOR. Not absolutely soâBut this we think: The mere indifferent act of punishment, When blood or friendship suffer not the blow, Asks little resolution from the agent; But, when it menaces a breast beloved, The fortitude that strikes is strong indeed. ULRIC. Your solemn preparation teaches me My heart must suffer by the present duty. RATIBOR. The traitor Herman is adjudg'd to dieâ A sentence from the secret Judges dooms him, And you are fix'd upon to execute it. ULRIC. If ever I found favour in your sight, Spare me, dread Sir, the horror of the task! I lov'd him as a brotherâWe were bred In the same school of youthful exercise, And he has heap'd his friendship on my headâ RATIBOR. There is no remedyâThy hand must strike him. ULRIC. O bid me rather plunge th'accursed steel In my own bosomâ'twill be mercy in you, Compar'd with murderous ingratitude. RATIBOR. Think of your oathâThe associate among us, Who even spares the bosom which has rear'd him, Is perdurably damn'd. Think that the fiends, Who wait for perjur'd souls, are hovering round To disappoint the justice we are sworn to. ULRIC. O miserable state! RATIBOR. I tell thee, Ulric, That were the silver'd head ev'n of a parent Condemned to fall, these hands could execute, Though nature shriek'd at the tremendous deed. [a piercing shriek without.] Hah! (shuddering) what sea of blood rises before me! While through the crimson waves a phantom glides In threat'ning horror!âLo! it is my sisterâ O shield me Ulric from her frown. Hide, hide me, [clings to his bosom.] ULRIC. Your fancy, labouring on a dreadful theme, Presents this image of reality. RATIBOR. How, did it feign that shriek too? ULRIC. No, my Lord. But I much fear it spoke, I heard it plainly, Your sister dead. It came from her attendants. RATIBOR. O, trueâtis very like, indeed, good Ulric. I shall subdue this fanciful delirium, And teach my grief the natural flow of sorrow. The Duke, my brother, comesâhis look confirms it. Here, Ulric, take the warrant, and be firm. [He gives him the letter of Badendorff instead of the sentence.] When next I meet you at the secret court. Thy lifted dagger tells me he is dead. ULRIC. (aside) It is resolv'd; that way alone is left me. [Exit Ulric, in great disorder. Enter WIRTEMBERG. O, whither shall I bear this bulk of grief, Where find a med'cine to my great affliction? Brother, she's gone, my wife is flown for ever, And but the dregs of life remain behind! RATIBOR. O say not so, dear Sir. WIRTEMBERG. Even in my arms Her quiet spirit from its feeble dwelling Aspir'd to Heav'nâI clasp'd the gentle earth, Till all the fervour given by pain grew cold, Its icy clasp at length struck to my heartâ I shudder'd and withdrew. RATIBOR. Have her physicians Pronounc'd the latent cause of her decease. WIRTEMBERG. How can I whisper to thy generous ear What my enquiry learn'd! that Badendorff, In the low sullen tone of horror, hinted His fears of poison. RATIBOR. Ah, my mind misgives me! Some curs'd accomplice of that murderous slave. WIRTEMBERG. Dear spirit, yesâBe this thy meed of sorrow, The eager vengeance upon thy assassins. Give instant orders to examine strictly All her attendantsâSend them to the rack! Find but the wretch, and give her to my fury. RATIBOR. With winged speed.âNow to consummate all. [Exeunt. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Palace. IDA , alone, Since my dear Sov'reign died, a sullen stupor Has rob'd me of reflection. Even the terror Of interrogatory back'd by torture, Fail'd to arouse me. Slowly sense returns, And reason strives to work upon remembrance. I call to mind some doubts express'd of poison. O, could there bosom black enough be found, To strike at such an angel? Why, I know not, But I am yet unquestion'dâSure my heart Will speak its love by language so convincing, That ev'n malicious hate would credit me. I should enquire the eventâbut every face Would by its woe increase the pangs I feel. [The door is thrown open suddenly by Holstein, who totters forward to one side; and in large letters the following is seen affixed to it:] IDA HOLSTIEN, TRAIT'RESS! APPEAR BEFORE THE SECRET AVENGERS OF THE ETERNAL. Gracious Heav'n, my Father! [He silently points to the placard.] Speak to me! Or I shall die with horrorâDo I wake? HOLSTEIN. Lo, thy poor father, stung by thy dishonour, Is hither come to rend his hoary hair, And so expire before thee. (falls) IDA. O look up, Kill me not thus, my father, with your anguish; Look up, and hear your child. HOLSTEIN. Begone, pollution! Thou stain of my unsullied life and honour! But, god of justice, hear me! if this wretch Be guilty of the crime imputed to her, Send thy sharp vengeance down, and strike the trait'ress! Or let her liveâbut live to see like me, A darling object canker'd and deprav'd, To break her heart with grief, and so expire. IDA. Yet hear me, O, my fatherâI am innocent. HOLSTEIN. I will be calm and hear theeâO, my child, Did I ere think, when, smiling in these arms, Thy infancy seem'd consecrate to goodness, That thus I should behold thee stain'd at last! IDA. Yet still that sacred breastâBy him I swear Whose essence is the truth, I know no more Of what they charge upon me, than the babe Whose eyes first opens on a sinful world. HOLSTEIN. Guilt cannot be thus stedfastâmy dear daughter, Yet must there be presumptions of thy guilt; I tremble to enquire them. IDA. Lord of my being! Were I so wretchedly estrang'd from virtue, Could I thus gaze upon that form rever'd? From which no act of mine, so mercy save me, Ere merited parental ire should frown. Lead me! where I may answer my accusers. HOLSTEIN. Alas! my child, I know not where myself. The great avengers secretly assembleâ No man divulges where. IDA. How then, though cited, Is the accused person brought to judgment? HOLSTEIN. I can acquaint you so farâAll accus'd, When the first quarter after midnight tolls, Go to the centre of the Market-placeâ Thence they are led before the Secret Judges. If guilty, they are never heard of more. IDA. My father, do I tremble? HOLSTEIN. Glorious Ida! (embraces her) I'll lead you to the place. IDA. It is now lateâ HOLSTEIN. It isâLook! when you orb illumes the heavens, Above the spire, that fronts the palace gate, It will be time we secretly set forwardâ IDA. You'll stay with me, until the hour arrive. HOLSTEIN. I will my childâMy limbs will scarce support thee, Old, and thus palsied by surprise.âCome, Ida. [Exeunt. Holstein's House. Enter ELLEN, followed by HERMAN. ELLEN. O tell me not of comfortâShe's devoted! Accursed tyranny has reach'd her life! I could as soon be brought to think her guilty, As credit her acquittal. HERMAN. Madam, hear me! Know you the independence of her judges? Be satisfied, they'll ask for other proof, Than the mean artifice of Ratibor. ELLEN. Would she had ne'er approach'd the domes of greatness! Had she not been unfortunately lovedâ HERMAN. I pardon the reproaches of despair. But as my passion drew this storm around her, I'll fly, and either dissipate the danger, Or perish with her. ELLEN. Say, what means my son? HERMAN. To hasten and defend herâWhere's your husband? ELLEN. Soon as the public accusation met him, A burst of passion blinded his discernmentâ The soldier's honour govern'd all his mind; He rav'd of ignominious disgrace, A life of glory blasted now by treason. HERMAN. Alas, unhappy friend! Went he in anger? ELLEN. I beg'd his patience, but he flung me from him; And, imprecating curses on himself, Vow'd if his daughter faulter'd at his presence, He would himself punish his house's stigma. And thus at dusk he left me for the palace. HERMAN. Madam, I goâthus menaced by a villain, I will this instant rush to the Tribunal, Defend myself and herâIf there I fall, And guilty power destroy my Ida with me, O do not hate my memory! Farewel! (As he is going outâenter Ulric in armour and the sable plumes and mantle of the Tribunal. Herman starts.) HERMAN. Sir! spare a woman's terrors. [Ulric signs to Ellen, who goes out. Now, your pleasure. ULRIC. To Herman, a convicted foul assassin, A parricide, a fugitive from prison, The Invisibles decree immediate death. HERMAN. And could their cruelty find out no hand To urge the vengeance home, but thine, my friend? For, thus in terrors cloth'd, I know my Ulric. And wilt thou strike the bosom that has lov'd thee? ULRIC. Oh! [turning aside. HERMAN. Do not turn away, my early friend! Think not I meanly wish to owe my life, To the opposing friendship against duty. It is my wish to meet these dark avengers. ULRIC. Would it were in my choice to lead you there! Heav'n knows the anguish that this cruel office Has planted in my heartâbut 'tis not mine, To mitigate, but execute their pleasure. HERMAN. Lo! I am readyâ [baring his breast. ULRIC. Spare me yet awhile. A few short moments to this struggling fondness! Then as we liv'd in amity together, United we will quit this wretched world. HERMAN. What means my Ulric? ULRIC. To perform my oath;â But never to survive the deed of horrour. Seek not to shake my well determin'd purpose: We die togetherâLet that expiate all. HERMAN. Might I but hope my Ida were secure, I think my death would never raise a pang. ULRIC. I am forbid to speakâSee there, peruse The mandate, which thus buries us together. [Gives the letter. HERMAN. Amazement! horror! providential mercy! ULRIC. What means my friendâO give me the contents! That warrant is for deathâ'twas Ratiborâ HERMAN. It was indeed: mark, Ulric, its contents. âTo Ratibor. âAll is accomplished. âThe deadly mixture is, by your command, âInfus'd, and Ida ministers the draught, âEre this your sister dies.â âBadendorff.â ULRIC. Mysterious powers, for this eternal thanks. [kneeling. His order death, and this the warrant giv'n! 'Tis virtue now to disobey the mandate, Giv'n by a murd'rer, who usurps the judge. HERMAN. O let us instant hence to succour Ida! ULRIC. Stay, let me first consider of the means. I risk my life to save her. Herman, hear me. You shall for me appear at the Tribunal; Ev'n in this dressâI'll teach you the dark signals; Describe the place of subterraneous meeting. Haste to the market placeâOne there will meet you: To his two questions, answer âearth and groan.â He leads you to the centre of the wood, Where, to the question of the guard there plac'd, âHow many steps lead to the throne of truth?â You answer âthirtyââWhen you're in the cave, And one of rank crosses the solemn court, Draw and hold up this dagger. There Heav'n shield you! Act then as the emergencies demand. I'll after Badendorff and lead him thither. HERMAN. Let us dispatch, and change habiliments. A tempest of emotions crouds upon me. ULRIC. Nay hence, a moment may be fatal to us. [Exeunt. SCENE, the Market-place. Four streets there centering, and the Church and Porch of St. Bartholomew upon the right hand. A quarter strikes from the tower. Enter slowly HOLSTEIN, supporting IDA. HOLSTEIN. This is the spotâHow cold it is, my child. IDA. Bitterly keen, and yet my cheek now glows, Although an ague seems to shake my joints. HOLSTEIN. The chimes have struck, and yet no one appears. IDA. My father, look, what dark gigantic form, Stalks solemnly this way? HOLSTEIN. Hush! [The Minister of Vengeance approaches.] Who goes there? HOLSTEIN. 'Tis Ida Holstein, and her aged father. MINISTER OF VENGEANCE. The Ministers of Vengeance seek the former: The latter may depart. HOLSTEIN. No, lead me with her. Force not the parent from his guiltless child. MINISTER OF VENGEANCE. That must depend upon your answering me. What are the names we give to these four streets? This which the moon illumines, I call fire, That in the shadow, ironâName the others. [Finding him silent.] Ha! silentâhence! this is no place for you. HOLSTEIN. I will not leave my child, my darlingâ MINISTER OF VENGEANCE. [Furiously tearing her from him.] Hence! [Ida first clasps her father's knees, and then submits. Holstein still about to follow her is prevented by two other followers of the Tribunal, who drive him quite exhausted into the porch, and exeunt. A long pause, after which the second quarter strikes, and then HOLSTEIN. Again that dreary voice reluctant tolls, In sullen signal, that my child has perish'd. Her sighs now agitate the moaning wind, And deepen every gustâHark, 'tis her voice! That shriek! O God! what horrors croud upon me! Groans, deadly groans, are humming in my ears, And my mind shapes such horrible conceits, That my brain boils! Behold, the murd'rer comes, To tell me that my fears are realiz'd! Enter HERMAN in the habit of the Tribunal. HOLSTEIN (rushing towards him.) Thou sable arm of a mysterious judgment, Reveal to me her fateâI will sustain it. Madness has touch'd me with his iron mace, And I am proof against calamity. HERMAN. Restrain this transport, my beloved friendâ Know you not Herman? HOLSTEIN. He too sacrific'd! HERMAN. No! I am heâfollow meâand be firm. There is nor time nor place for explanation. Follow, observe my conductâbut be silent. [Exeunt. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. The Scene represents a spacious Crypt, or vaulted Court of Justice, under ground, of Gothic Architecture.âAt the upper end is a luminous Cross of a deep red, and over this, surrounded by Clouds, an Eye, radiated with points of fire. A Throne adorned with trophies in gold, upon a ground of black velvet.âThe benches of the Judges the same. Dignitaries of the Church. Canons.âMonks. Judges.âAdvocates. Banners of the Tribunal. Knights.âPages. Barons.âWirtemberg. Attendants with Torches. They take their seats in profound silence. Among them Herman in the habit of Ulric. Ratibor crosses the Stage: Herman rises and holds up his poniard. WIRTEMBERG. Ye ministers of vengeance! I could wish That any other, than my personal wrong, Had summon'd us together at this time. And more, my nature moves me to regret On that account the eminence I hold; Since though no partial judgment can be fear'd From men enlighten'd, sanctified to truth, I fear the frailty of this widow'd breast, Too much, to think myself dispassionate. It is well known, with what unnatural hate A cherish'd viper rose against my life; Ye know his flightâpresumption of his guilt. But guilt still blacker now obtrudes upon you, Suborn'd assassination, timeless death.â Thus, having broke the business of the sitting, Into your hands, I delegate my power, With full reliance on your grave decision. [He comes down, and sits by Ratibor; the Principal Judge takes the Chair.] A Bell tolls. Then, from the extremity of the Hall, the Minister of Vengeance is seen leading Ida down a flight of stepsâhe brings her forward, seats her on a stone, and then in a low voice speaks. MINISTER OF VENGEANCE. These are your Judges. You will soon be call'd on. Take off your veilâYour face must be uncover'd. [He retires. Bell tolls again. A JUDGE. Ida, accus'd of murder and of treason, We, the invisible avengers, cite thee To answer at the awful bar of truth. Appear, appear, appear! IDA. To such citation, I ought not to answer. I who am Ida, shudder at such crimes. A JUDGE. Come near, and listen to thy accusation. Thou art accus'd in foul conspiracy, With the convicted traitor Herman, who, By mad ambition tempted, sought the crown, To have abus'd thy confidential trust, And, by administ'ring a subtle poison, Struck to the grave our much lamented Princess. This charge substantiated by proof. Your answer. IDA. My gracious Lords, my answer isâNot Guilty. Lend me your kind indulgence for a while. I speak not in extenuation nowâ For fancy cannot furnish one conjecture, How this most fearful charge can bear on me. But here surrounded with mysterious horror, Yet surely strung with fortitude from heav'n, I am to beg no ignorance of form May weigh against meâtrusting my defence, To conscious honour, and unvarnish'd truth. A JUDGE. Is it not true, that such excess of fondness The Princess bore thee, thou alone didst give Those medicines her physicians had prescrib'd? IDA. It is most true, such was my honour'd lot. I gave them, would I had prepar'd them also. A JUDGE. The dear lamented has been heard to say, She could nor live, nor die without her Ida. What meant this phrase, so singularly strong? IDA. Did she say so? O matchless, sainted spirit! See how my foes convert thy love to guilt! The reason is my prideâ'twas faithful service. A JUDGE. It is affirm'd you were betroth'd to Herman. That when his guilt was known, himself in prison, You visited him on the night he fled. IDA. I did so, and I know his innocence. A JUDGE. Is Herman yet o'ertaken in his flight? [To the attendants. RATIBOR. Ulric, my Lords, had order for his seizure: The slave resisted, and the poniard smote himâ Swept him from earth. IDA. And have they murder'd thee, My Lord, my love, my very vital spirit! Hear me, ye judges! I was proud in honour, And a stain there regarded as a wound, Venom'd beyond the power of cautery. It was my only wealth, and that I meant To have brought him spotless as my nuptial dow'r. I'm reckless now of lifeâPronounce your sentence. Defence is breathless in my Herman's grave! WIRTEMBERG. Let not this rash despair be deem'd confession. If any here have purpos'd her defence, Let him be summon'd. RATIBOR. This is lenity, That such audacious guilt but ill deserves. WIRTEMBERG. Let us be just, my brotherâLenity Becomes the Judge, but him especially, Who aims to emulate the Judge of all. A JUDGE. If any here defend the accused Ida, Let him ariseâAppear, appear, appear. HERMAN. (Rises and takes off his helmet.) I stand forth her defender. RATIBOR. Herman! hell! (aside) IDA. He lives! he lives! ye pow'rs accept my heart And let each fibre swell in gratulation, My Herman is alive! HERMAN. Thus I defend her, My most beloved Lord, into your hands I give the sentence dooming me to death. WIRTEMBERG. Read it aloud. A JUDGE , (reads) To Ratibor, All is accomplished. The deadly mixture is by your command Infus'd,â RATIBOR. 'Tis forgery all. A black contrivance meant, To turn his treasonous plots upon my head. ULRIC brings forward BADENDORFF. WIRTEMBERG. Who wrote that letter? BADENDORFF. I did, Badendorff. WIRTEMBERG. Suborn'd or freely? Speak, wretch! BADENDORFF. Freely wrote it. But the contents are falseâThe maid accus'd Ne'er gave the deadly drug; nor was it given. A JUDGE. The slave prevaricatesâ RATIBOR. I can but smile, when villany accurs'd Imps her dark course with injuries like these. The court will give my honour ample justice. But my dear Sovereign's cause demands my call For instant punishment of that assassin, Whose bloody weapon was secur'd upon him. HERMAN. Ye have it in your archivesâlet me see it. RATIBOR. Here is the traitor's sword. HERMAN. True; look upon it. Mark well the legendâLo! the fiend deserts him. RATIBOR. [Shudders violently, and lets the sword fall, which WIRTEMBERG rushes to take up.] WIRTEMBERG. âRegiment of RatiborââWhat shudders seize me! BADENDORFF. If any doubts remain, let me explain them. That monster, yonder, oft had tempted me To do the abhorred deed this paper speaks of. In fear of agents more corruptible, I promis'd to perform itâOft he chid me For cold delayâAt length too certain signs Of speedy dissolution mark'd her Highness;â Then I dispatch'd this letter to yon brother, Deceiv'd himâled him blindly to his fate. WIRTEMBERG. Inhuman traitorâWhy have all these deeds Assail'd the breast, that lov'd and cherish'd thee? RATIBOR. Why? Ask thy heart? Is but ambition there? Seek for a cause no furtherâthou hast found one, For which all human bonds at once are cancell'd: Place but that tempter there, a fury rises With ceaseless goad, to urge on crime to crime, Till the wretch dares eternal misery, Nor shrinks to leap the gulf, Lead to your dungeons. WIRTEMBERG. Bear him away. For thee, my dearest nephew, [Exit Ratibor. Whom confidence abus'd so much has injur'd, I shall endeavour ample reparation. HERMAN. I am indeed rewarded in the power To dedicate my life to do you service, And mitigate our loss by love unfailing. WIRTEMBERG. But we delay lustration to this innocent. Judges of truth, here in the eye of Heav'n By our most dreadful oath, I answer for herâ She is innocent. A JUDGE. We rise in confirmation. Back to the world again, more truly honour'd [To IDA. By this conviction of your spotless fame. Enter ULRIC, leading in HOLSTEIN, and ELLEN. WIRTEMBERG. Holstein, receive thy daughter. HOLSTEIN. O, my child, Balm of my life, my beautiful, my pious, I could expire with transport in thy arms. Thus to behold thee sav'dâI've much to ask. IDA. My mother too, a flood of struggling passions Subdues my heart, and drowns acknowlegments. The debt of love and gratitude immense Asks an extended life of zeal to pay. ELLEN. Long be that life, my love, and fill'd with honour. Nor will your danger die without its fruit, If it encrease compassion to the sufferer. The purest innocent through artful malice May wear the semblance of the guilty. Charity Is large in her construction; slow to censure. ULRIC. My Lords, the instrument of a design Which he believ'd your pleasure, throws himself Upon your liberal justice. For the oath, A seal of secresy, yet broke by virtue, I stand accountable. JUDGE. He who consults The sacred honour of the cause he serves, Corrects its error, to secure its glory. WIRTEMBERG. But one thing now remains. Amid the storm Of passion, malice, treason, which howl'd o'er us, I heard some gentle gales of love breath'd out, Then, when the heart most plainly speaks its purpose. HERMAN. (kneeling) Yes, gracious Sirâas warm as those that waft Saboean odours to the sinking spirits; Amid the doubts of death they pierc'd my heart, Add but that blessing, make my Ida mineâ WIRTEMBERG. Take her, and destine virtue to the throne. They who have suffer'd, best can feel for others. HERMAN. Shine forth bless'd spirit, purified by trial; My monitress, my ever-destin'd wife! To whose dear guidance every act shall bend, And all my life be influenc'd by thy virtue. HOLSTEIN. My old breast akes with transportâO, my children, Blessings be on ye! and when in wint'ry nights I bend across the blaze, and hear without The shrilling blast, that drives the shuddering seamanâ I'll still my fears, and sit resign'd, here taught How, beyond hope, a gracious power can save. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, By the Author of the Play. Spoken by MISS WALLIS. SUCH the dread scenes of a benighted age, Now only known in the historic page: Thence by our Poet drawn, but to display Old English Justice in unclouded day. But are these institutions quite destroy'd? Secret Tribunals, are none now employ'd? Thousands. Yes, while we sink in soft repose, Our Judges eyes no gentle slumbers close: The Heart is the tribunal which we fear, For ever hid, and yet for ever near; Its Agents are the Senses, and they gain Intelligence for that shrewd Judge the Brain. The mighty censure, carefully conceal'd, Until the doom is fix'd lies unreveal'd. Lo! the warm Patriot, that, with ceaseless din, Clamours against his rival, who is in; Who loads the land with ruin and disgrace, And paints the charms of Revolution's faceâ What says the Heart to this?âHe wants a Place. The wrinkled Tabby, who, on youthful joy, Frowns like a fiend, as eager to destroy; Who wears her poor thin frame to skin and bone, In hopes she may detect some pair aloneâ Let but our Secret Court the motive scan, The Heart will tell usâall she hopes is Man: Give but that banquet to her eager tooth, âAnd Virtue may be Wax to flaming Youth.â The poor old Soldier, whom, in rending pains, Some pious Daughter's tender breast sustains; Whose plain memorial, still in vain renew'd, Speaks him by unrequited toil subdu'd; Though passive sufferance he can not command, Yet in his heart acquits his native land: From his last efforts these proud accents rise, âBlest be my King, my Country!â and he dies. Such the decisions of our Court, the Heart, O! may the touches of the Poet's art, Win there an int'rest for his injur'd Maid, And feeling fix our doom with Candour's aid.</field>
