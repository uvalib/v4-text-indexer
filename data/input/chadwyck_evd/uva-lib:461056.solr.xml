      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS REPRESENTED. FLERIDA, Duchess of Parma. LAURA. her Lady. FLORA, her Lady. LIVIA, her Lady. HENRY, Duke of Mantua. FREDERICK, Secretary to the Duchess. LISARDO, A Gentleman, cousin to Laura. ARNESTO, Governor of Parma, father to Laura. FABIO, Frederick's servant. Ladies, Musicians, Attendants, Soldiers, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, PARMA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. âSCENE I. THE DUCAL PARK AND GARDENS. A Chorus of Musicians enter, followed by FLORA and the other ladies in morning dresses, and after them FLERIDA, Duchess of Parma, holding the hand of ARNESTO. During the song, all the characters slowly cross the stage, and at its termination go out. CHORUS OF MUSICIANS. Ah! my heart, in love's sweet season, Thou hast reason for thy pain, Reason for the gentle treason That has lured thee to love's chain; But of what availeth reason, Which for love itself is vain? FLORA sings. After all thy various trials, Doubtings, dangers, and denials, Rest at length, poor weary heart; Or if thou, for thy confusion, Must indulge some new illusion,â Hopeful dreamer that thou artâ Think not, with thy fond complaining, Thou canst cure thy bosom's paining, Change a bright eye's cold disdaining, Calm thy heart and cool thy brain; It were treason unto reason, If love came but in love's seasonâ CHORUS. Ah! but what availeth reason, Which for love itself is vain? Exeunt. Enter HENRY, FREDERICK, and FABIO, as if following the Musicians. FREDERICK. Since to me you have confided, How you hither came in secret To behold the fair Flerida, You may now enjoy that pleasure Thus concealed. HENRY. How much, my Frederick, Do I owe unto your friendship? FREDERICK. More I owe unto your favour, Since you give me the great honour Of your confidence. HENRY. Why, truly, To none else would I have done so. FREDERICK. Say no more upon the subject As this servant has no notion Who you are. FABIO, aside. Though I endeavour To find out who is this stranger, With more mysteries about him Than a rosary, and secrets Greater than a priest, I find it All in vain. FREDERICK. This park and garden, Do they please you? HENRY. I can only Say, that all the various fictions I have read for my amusement, To fill up a leisure moment, Ne'er could give me an idea Of a scene so fairâso beauteous As this real one before me. Groves like these ne'er blessed my vision, Though before my fancy trembled, Now the green woods of Diana, Now the golden bowers of Venus. FREDERICK. So o'erwhelmed is fair Flerida With a soft unceasing sadness, Which from Heaven she doubtless suffers For her infinite perfections, That we all with one another Strive with emulous endeavour To remove or dissipate it. 'Tis for this, my lord, that often, On these sunny, sweet May mornings, She doth seek this peaceful region, Where we make with songs and music Simple sylvan feasts to greet her. HENRY. 'Tis surprising, with her beauty, Youth, and wit, and rare endowments, That this gloomy feeling ever Should have gained such influence o'er her, And that she, by birth the duchess Of fair Parma, and whom Heaven Dower'd with noblest gifts and blessings, Was not shielded from the venom Of this arrow from the quiver Of unpitying time and fortune. Is it possible that no one Has yet found her cause of sorrow? FREDERICK. No one. FABIO. No one? How can you say so, When I know it? FREDERICK. You? FABIO. No less. FREDERICK. Speak! why dally? HENRY. What do you wait for? FABIO. Tell me, can you keep a secret? THE TWO. Oh! yes! yes! FABIO. Then, know her sorrow Springs from. ... FREDERICK. Pause not. HENRY. Tell it quickly. FABIO. Being in love with your humble servant, And (so much she dreads my scorn) That she dares not speak her passion. FREDERICK. Hence! you fool. HENRY. Begone! you madman. FABIO. Well, now hear; if 'tis not that,â 'Tis something else. The music is heard approaching. HENRY. Hark! now returning Comes the troop in this direction. FREDERICK. Leave me now, for I am anxious To rejoin them as they enter; Partly that it is my duty, Partly that my life will leave me If I lose the chance of seeing One I seek among these ladies. HENRY. I desire not to embarrass You the least; nay, rather going Hence, and quickly here returning, Speak to her myself; for I, Now that I have seen her beauty, Long to try her mental culture: By that stratagem we thought of Yester night, and which consists in My presenting my own letter, As my own sent secretary, I can speak to her, and thus Learn, since I have come to see her, If 'tis true, that fortune ever. Loveth to assist the bold. Exit. FREDERICK. In a notable dilemma Am I placed, for if I tell Who he is, I break the secret Which was trusted to my heart By the duke; and if I tell not, Then I violate the duty That I owe unto Flerida; I, who am her trusted servant, Vassal, kinsman, all combined: What am I to do? But whyâ Why deliberate about it? Duty is a claim preceding The confiding of a friend. But, ah me! if I deprive me Of the duke's regard, I lose All the hopes I formed, his palace Would become the safe asylum, The sure shelter of my love; When my Laura ...... Ah! why speak thus? Back, dear sound, into my bosom; Even to breathe her name aloud Makes me fear that I offend her. FABIO. Master, who may be this stranger, Who, disguised, arrives by night-time, And conceals himself by day? FREDERICK. He is a friend, to whom I'm under Some obligations. FABIO. Was he then Your valet once, you feel so grateful? But why should I speak about it? Be he who he may, he's welcome, Very welcome, for at least While he's here, we'll fare the better, Eat and drink more for some days; Bed and board then freely give him, For the trouble is repaid Amply by the pleasant bearing Of a lively guest at table. FREDERICK. They are coming. Fabio, silence! Enter FLERIDA and her attendants as before. FLORA sings. If without being worthy of her Thou dost dare to be the lover Of Antandra, young and fair, Suffer silently thine anguish, For the cause whereby you languish It were idle to declare; Blame the star, whose fatal warning Shone upon thy natal morning, Not the maiden's gentle scorning, Which her heart cannot restrain,â Call for aid upon thy reason, To protect thee from such treason. CHORUS. But of what availeth reason, Which for love itself is vain? FLERIDA. Whose words are these? FREDERICK. SeÃ±ora, they are mine. FLERIDA. I always note that in the songs they sing me, And which they tell me have by you been written, Your one unchanging plaint is ever love. FREDERICK. I am poor. FLERIDA. Of what importeth this to love? FREDERICK. To merit being loved, it much imports; And thus you see, that I do not complain Of feeling love's sweet bitter pain, SeÃ±ora, But that I do not merit being loved. FLERIDA. But canst thou, Frederick, love so base an object That can be influenced by thoughts of gain? FREDERICK. It were a crime to charge her innocent heart With such a thought. FLERIDA. Whom do you blame? FREDERICK. Myself! FLERIDA. And why? FREDERICK. Because I dare not speak of love, I do not say to her nor to her kindred, But even to her very menial slaves; Knowing the lover that has nought to give Has little chance of gaining what he asks. FLERIDA. A lover who doth own himself to be So helpless, can at least declare the name Of her he loves. It surely cannot shock The most extreme respect that he should speak it, Who doth pronounce himself so badly used. And so, good Frederickâloving but not meritingâ It doth appear most strange that no one yet Has learned the name of her you love so well. FREDERICK. So guarded in my silence is my love, That many times I have resolved, SeÃ±ora, Never to speakâlest in some thoughtless hour My secret might escape me with my words: So sacred is this hidden love I cherish, That even the very air on which I live, When it doth seek the prison of my breast, I question whence it comes. For I have grown Suspicious even of the breath of heaven, Lest it should learn, and bear to other ears The knowledge of my love, and my despair. FLERIDA. Enough, enough, for you are very secret, And very foolish in your secrecy; But how then comes it, thus addressing me, That you can speak with so much zeal and warmth About your love, forgetting who I am? FREDERICK. Who is to blame for this offence, SeÃ±ora? You deigned to ask and I have but replied. FLERIDA. You, for you answered more than I did ask. Arnesto! ARNESTO. Please your grace! FLERIDA. Be sure To forward unto Frederick. ... FREDERICK, aside. Ah! I die. FLERIDA. Two thousand ducats, as a gift from me, That with them he may gain o'er the servants Of his mistress; for I do not wish, That, presuming on his cowardice, He thus strangely should again address me, Trembling so to think of one away, And yet so daring in my very presence. FLORA, aside to Livia. How changeable and fickle is her sadness! LIVIA, to her. From one extreme she flies unto another. LAURA, aside. Alas! that I alone should know the cause Of all this sorrow that the world can pierce not! FREDERICK. A thousand times I humbly kiss the earth Whereon you tread, for there, believe me, lady, By the brief contact of your beauteous feet More flowers are born without the aid of time Than April bears with all its labouring hours. FABIO. I will not kiss the earth whereon you tread, Nor where you have trod, not I. I'm not so bold, For that no more is earth, 'tis changed to Heaven; It is enough for me to stoop and kiss The ground that you intend to tread upon. Which is the way, then? whither are you going? For I would wish to kiss the ground before you. Enter LISARDO. LISARDO. A gallant cavalier, my lady, Who doth claim a near alliance With the duke of Mantua, prayeth That your grace will grant him leave To present to you a letter. FLERIDA. Oh! how much the duke of Mantua Wearies me with his addresses! ARNESTO. Why, my lady, if on every Ground he is your proper suitor? FLERIDA. Then that reason is sufficient,â For I do not wish to wed. Say, he may approach, Lisardo. FREDERICK, aside. I shall not betray his secret, Soon to need him as a friend. Enter HENRY. HENRY. Dazzled, troubled, to thy feet I, SeÃ±ora, come:âa haven May they be for my misfortunes. Kneels. FLERIDA. From the earth arise. HENRY. The duke, My good lord, presents this letter Unto your grace's hands by me. Gives it. FLERIDA. How is his highness? HENRY. I would say Dead with love, if hope's elixir Kept him not alive. FLERIDA. Whilst I Read, remain not so. Reads to herself. HENRY, arising and aside. The pencil Lied, that strove to paint her beauty, Leaving many a charm unlimned. LISARDO, to Arnesto. At length, my lord, the powers I waited From my father have arrived. ARNESTO. I am glad they have come. FLORA, to Laura. How graceful Is this stranger's mien and bearing Who has brought the letter, Laura;â LAURA. I have not even looked at him. FLORA. I am not surprised, your cousin Being here, and you well knowing How devotedly he loves you; And that now your sire, Arnesto, Speaks with him about your marriage. It were like disdain or scorn If you could regard another. LAURA. Not to him, do I, believe me, Owe this thought or want of thought. FREDERICK, aside. While the duchess still is reading, Arnesto and Lisardo speaking, Love instruct me to be bold. And the letter? [Aside, to Laura. LAURA, aside. It is written. FREDERICK. Thanks! but how can I receive it? LAURA. Have you not a glove? FREDERICK. I have. LAURA. Then with it. ... FREDERICK. I understand you. ARNESTO, to Lisardo. All is very well. LISARDO. As ages Will my love compute the moments, Beauteous Laura, to my hope. FLERIDA. The duke informs me in this letter How you, being his near kinsman, It is needful, you, from Mantua Should absent yourself some days, Until he succeeds in making An arrangement or conclusion, Relative to some late trouble,â Duelâchallengeâsome dilemma Love it seems has placed you in. HENRY. True it is, my crime was love. FLERIDA. Protection, for his sake and yours, Here I offer you in Parma, So that you may now continue At my court from this day forth. I shall, presently, an answer Write unto the duke, and send it To his grace. HENRY. May heaven, SeÃ±ora, Through eternal happy ages Guard your life! and may we all, Mantua's noble vassals, merit To behold ourselves so happy As ere long ..... FLERIDA. No more: remember That it is my strict injunction, While you are my guest in Parma, That you speak not on this subject Until I may speak to thee. HENRY. You will see that I obey thee. FLERIDA. And that you, when you are writing To the duke how I amuse me, As no doubt you have instructions So to do, from time to timeâ All be seated, since the sun In thick, dusky clouds enveloped, Seems to peep with stealthy glances, Rather than to beam bright day;â Here, my ladies, take your places At this side: and you, Arnesto, Some quaint question now propose. The ladies sit down at one side of Flerida, and the gentlemen remain standing at the other. ARNESTO. Though my white hairs might excuse me From a share in this sweet pastime; Still, to gratify SeÃ±ora, Thee in aught, I put the questionâ âWhat is love's most bitter pain?â FLERIDA, to Henry. Sir, it is for you to answer. HENRY. I? FLERIDA. To thee, as guest and stranger, We precedence grant. HENRY. In this I obtain a double favour, And that I may forfeit not The advantages you give me, I proclaim the pain I suffer: That of loving where I'm scorned, Is the greatest pain of love. FLORA. I believe its greatest anguish Is the pang that rends my bosom, That of scorning without loving. LIVIA. 'Tis absence. LISARDO. Jealousy. FREDERICK. The feeling Of loving without hope or cure. FLERIDA. I think its greatest pain is loving In gloomy suffering and silence, Without the power of explanation. LAURA. And I, to love, and be beloved. FLERIDA. That's a somewhat novel reason: 'Twill be hard to prove, dear Laura, That to love and be beloved Is the greatest pain of loving. LAURA. I will prove it, notwithstanding. ARNESTO. Now let each one prove his meaning. HENRY. Since I made the first beginning, 'Tis for me to prove the anguish Of being hated where we love. FABIO, aside. Now we'll hear enough of nonsense. The more the wit, the more the folly. HENRY. Love is a planet, shining far With varying beam in heaven above, And so the greatest pain of love Is to love against one's star: He who doth yoke him to the car Of some proud beauty's scornful eyes, Which glance upon him to despise, Vainly by his star is warned. He who loves where he is scorned, Struggles with opposing skies. FLORA. He who lifts his heart above To some proud eye's scornful glowing, Has at least the bliss of showing That he suffers for his love, Which may yet her pity moveâ But that more unhappy one, Who feeleth scorn, yet loveth none, Suffers without any merit, Neither can her heart inherit Aught the other may have won. LISARDO. He who loves, and yet is hated, She who hates, but cannot love, Both a separate anguish prove, Which in time may be abated With the thought that they are fated By the will of heaven above. But the jealous pang we feel When we happen to discover From some dearer favoured lover, What his eyes cannot conceal, This nor soothing time can healâ Nor thought of heaven's impartial plan, Love is but the work of fate, Destiny controlleth hate, But jealousy is born of man! LIVIA. Many times the world has seen, When the torch of love expires, Jealousy relume its fires Brighter than they once had been, Love returns to glad the scene; Awakened by its glowing breath. But absence, which the wise man saith Is the grave of love, may strive, Vainly such a boon to giveâ Absence is love's quickest death, While jealousy doth make it live. FREDERICK. He who scorned still adores, She who worshipped still doth scornâ He whom jealousy's sharp thorn Woundeth with its poisoned sores; He who the absent maid deploresâ All live beneath hope's horoscope: Time may bring them some relief, But naught can cure the deadly grief Of him who loveth without hope. FLERIDA. He who without hope doth grieve, Can at least his state declare, And by telling his despair May some soothing calm receive; But he whose heart is doomed to heave In secret, shares a sadder lot, To the anguish of not feeling Hope, is added the concealing Even that he feels it not. LAURA. He who loves, and is beloved, Ever lives in hope and fear, From the midst of pleasure near Some fancied evil, far removed, Wounds him like a hidden spear; In his passion and his languor He feels at once the double pain Of him who loves, but meets disdain, And the proud disdainer's anger; As to jealousy, heaven knows, He feels its added pang as well; He cannot for a moment dwell From his loved mistress, but the throes Of absence in his bosom swell. 'Tis true, despair can find no scope Whereon its trophy to erect; But having nothing to expect, He cannot feel the joy of hope; If silence be a grief, 'tis his, He cannot speak his bosom's bliss; And thus he feels the pain of each Who wanteth hope, or wanteth speech. 'Twould seem, indeed, a man like this Is wholly out of misery's reach, So much doth love his bosom blessâ But, in the midst of all his joy, There comes the shadow of annoy, Lest fate, perchance, may make it less; And thus his breast contains each feeling That our several lips have stated, Of being loved, and being hatedâ Both of speaking and concealingâ Jealousy and absence mated. They all arise. FLERIDA. These are sophistries, my Laura, With which you have sought to show Merely wit, but which by reason Are entirely unsustained. LAURA. That is true: for it were sad, Love's supremest object being To be loved in turn ..... FLERIDA. Your gloveâ Laura drops her glove. Frederick raises it, and exchanges it for his own. FREDERICK. I shall raise it. ARNESTO. Stay, detain thee. LISARDO. I would hold it. FREDERICK. If I meant To detain it, or to hold it, I methinks could compass both; But as I do not intend it, There does not arise, Lisardo, Any cause for a dispute; And since reaching it more quickly Was not merit but good fortune, See, to Laura I return it. Presents the glove to Laura. Take it, lady, and I think That my quickness is rewarded More than amply, since I feel That I serve, and not offend thee. LISARDO. Frederick, you have most discreetly Drawn me from a grave position Of embarrassment. FLERIDA. To me You and he have both been wanting, For it is unheard-of boldness, In my presence, one should dare From the ground to raise the merest Trifle, the most casual trophy, Dropp'd by any lady here; And be grateful, that my anger Is not shown more strongly now, Than by speaking it:âO Heaven! [Aside. I to be the first of women Silence ever yet has killed! Exit with Livia and Flora. ARNESTO. Quite chagrined departs her highness, Though I cannot see the cause; Do not, Laura, for the present, Seek her quarter of the court, Rather let us seek our own one, Since, to meet the varying phases Of her changeful moods, I hold My apartments in it, being Governor of the state as well: I desire not you should serve her More than proud respect requires. LAURA. I in all things would obey thee;â Much Flerida's sudden anger [Aside. Doth betray: O love! I pray thee Make it not what I suspect! As they go out, the gentlemen are about following. Arnesto returns alone. ARNESTO. Cavaliers, pray whither wend ye? FREDERICK. We would go to wait on you. ARNESTO. No, you must not with me go; You, especially, my nephew, Must remain here. [Exit. LISARDO. I obey thee, To my sorrow I must own. HENRY, aside. I, with heartfelt joy, obey him, Since a human sunflower turning Towards my planet I am drawn; Frederick, I shall soon rejoin thee. Exit in the direction Flerida has gone. LISARDO. Till my vision loses, Laura, Thy resplendent beauty, I Cannot keep me from thy presenceâ Thou the loadstone of my heart. Exit. FREDERICK. Oh! how much I am delighted, That they've left me here alone, Since it gives me an occasion To peruse this letter now. FABIO. If I do not lose my reason After this, the cause must be That I have got none to part with. FREDERICK. What do you wonder at? FABIO. At what? At your coolness: since a letter, Which you must have got last evening, You have opened not till now. FREDERICK. Know you whence this letter cometh? FABIO. Be it whence it may; 'tis certain, Is it not? with seal unbroken You have kept it since last night? FREDERICK. 'Twas this moment I received it. FABIO. You will make me lose my senses; No one spoke to you since morn,â Doubtless, 'twas the wind that brought it. FREDERICK. Not the wind. It was the fire Which doth burn me and consume me. FABIO. How!âthe fire? FREDERICK. Yes. FABIO. Now I'm certain That 'tis true ..... FREDERICK. What? FABIO. You are mad, And, a phantom lover turning, Have created in your fancy Some hobgoblin lady fair, This is an allusion to Calderon's own play of La Dama Duende. Whom you mentally make love to!â Therefore, now I supplicate thee For a favour. FREDERICK. Say, what favour? FABIO. Since in your conception only Liveth this imagined lady, Without any soul or body But what you are pleased to give; Let, at least, her letters reach you Filled with loves and tendernesses; For it were a signal error, When you craved yourself this favour, To despise yourself, my lord. FREDERICK. Stand apart. FABIO. And does the letter Need it? FREDERICK. No: for I will own It is written all in cypher; Nevertheless, stand off. FABIO. A lackey, Even of Limbo, I must be, Neither pain nor glory tasting. FREDERICK, reading aside. âDear lord and master mine, The final torments of my soul commence, Since my free choice my father will incline, By cruel force and tyrant violence, Ordering a marriage of dislike and sorrow, Whose fatal contract must be signed to-morrow.â Aloud. Oh! unhappy me, how wretched! What a brief and fleeting tenure Hold I of this life! Till morning Have I but to live: you'll see me, Fabio, then ..... FABIO. What?â FREDERICK. Lying dead!â FABIO. You will wrong yourself, believe me, If you can at all excuse you; 'Tis a vulgar thing to die. FREDERICK. How avoid it? How avoid it? If this letter is the sentence Of my death? FABIO. By simply adding A short postscript to the letter Which you're holding in your hand. FREDERICK, aside. Scarcely living, scarcely breathing, I return to read what follows:â [Reads. âAnd thus, although with trembling and distrust, Lest any should our hapless love suspect, And so betray our secret, still I must To-night speak with thee; and for such effect, The garden-gate will not its aid refuse:â Sooner than lose thee, I my life must lose; Upon the faith of which, accept, I pray, This portrait, which with yours you may repay.â Aloud. Was there ever man so happy!â Fabio! Fabio! FABIO. What's the matter? You're not dying yet!â FREDERICK. I live. FABIO. Did I not good counsel give thee? There is nothing like one's loving One's own self. FREDERICK. With tranquil rapture, Full of gladness, proud and happy, Shall I speak, this tardy night-time, With the beauty that I worship. O thou sun! heaven's shining champion, Driving slow thy golden chariot Round in everlasting circles The unbounded azure fields, Shorten now thy daily labour, Knowing well how many longing Eyes thy dazzling light offends; And ye stars! love's beauteous planets, Rise with gentler influence over His usurped dominion, placing In its stead your bright republics Through the shining hosts of heaven; For the sun your laws hath broken, And your sacred rights betrayed. [Exit. FABIO. He's as mad as fifty madmen! But I wonder not at that, Mad although he be,âbut rather To behold myself as mad. So absurd as ..... Enter FLORA. FLORA. Fabio! FABIO. Lady, What are your commands? FLORA. That you Follow me this instant hence. FABIO. Let me know if 'tis a challenge, That I may together call Four or five of my friends to aid me. FLORA. Follow me. FABIO. And for what purpose Must I follow thee? Art thou That too liberal, loving lady, Giving all her jealousy Unto me, and I the lover Giving unto her in turn Not the fourth of a maravedi, That I must go following thee? FLORA. 'Tis her highness who desireth To speak with you; she is writing, And commanded you to come. FABIO. Has her highness sent you for me? Heavens! who knows but she has taken Courage now to own her love? Enter FLERIDA, with a letter. FLERIDA. Flora, have you called the servant? FLORA. Here, my lady, he doth stand. FLERIDA. Leave, and wait me near at hand. [Exit Flora. You remain and be observant. FABIO. Yes, my lady, I shall keep Heart and mind both open; say How I'll serve you: show the way, For I am willing and dog-cheap: So you've little need to go Round about the bush to persuade me. FLERIDA. Fabio, I desire you aid me In a matter I would know, Which my power requires in sooth As but due to my position; It is about a grave suspicion, Of which I wish to test the truth. FABIO. If I can tell I won't delay it, 'Tis done at once, as I shall show, Far more than you desire to know, I shall die with the wish to say it. FLERIDA. Take this chain. FABIO. Of course, 'twere rude Not to accept it; rude and cold, Since being yours, and made of gold, It must, indeed, be very good. Ask me: I'm mad to burst this dam Of silence, which my zeal reproves. FLERIDA. Who is the lady Frederick loves? FABIO. Unhappy babbler that I am! Since the Fates but one thing hide, SeÃ±ora, 'neath their silent mask,â It is the very thing you ask. FLERIDA. If you never leave his side, Can it be, that, as you say, You do know it not? (O woe!) FABIO. If he himself doth scarcely know, How am I to know it, pray? FLERIDA. It cannot be his bosom's pain Can so secret be. FABIO. If so, Tell it then, I wish to know, And I'll give you back your chain:â Because, SeÃ±ora, he doth keep His love a thing from all unknown,â He, to himself, doth laugh alone, He, to himself, alone doth weep; If he receives a letter, why, How it arriveth no one knows, Nor do we know to whom it goes, If he despatcheth a reply;â It was but to-day, that even I found out he wore love's fetterâ For when he perused a letter Which Barrabas must have given, Since none else approached the spot,â I, said he, expect to-night, By the glimmering stars' pale light, To meet a beauteous lady. FLERIDA. What! Do they meet to-night? FABIO. Unless Love, some wanton trick repeating, Interferes to prevent the meeting. FLERIDA. And can it be (O dire distress!) That the street or house of her He loves is quite unknown to thee? FABIO. I know this, that it must be In the palace. FLERIDA. Why? FABIO. I infer That from this; beyond the scope Of change he suffers, in a fire Unknown he burns, without desire Adores, and loveth without hope, And day beholds, and midnight sees Him filling a big book with letters; 'Tis in a palace, 'mong one's betters, Only occur such fooleries. FLERIDA. Now attend to what I say. It must be your special aim To find out for me the name Of this lady; from this day, Every act of his observing;â And when in his manner you Shall discover aught that's new, That you think may be deserving Of a hearing or relating, Come and tell me; full permission Shall I leave for your admission. FABIO. Then a gentleman in waiting Shall I be henceforth 'tis plain, Till the secret is found out. FLERIDA. And that you may have no doubt Whence will come your loss or gain, Know that both must spring from me. If my will you do not cross, Then the gain;âbut tenfold loss If to any one, what we Now have said, you dare betray. FABIO. Sly and silent I shall be, If the two at all agree. FLERIDA. Go with God! FABIO. And with him stay! Exit. FLERIDA. O fond and foolish thought be still! What tyrant empire is usurp'd by thee,â That thou dost come by force to take from me, Out of my hands, the reins of my own will?â But why distrust myself, and think so ill Of my own strength, and seem afraid to move? Now on myself, ye pitying powers above, On my sole self, my only hope must be; But if I must conceal my jealousy, Let me, at least, be silent of my love!â Shall they (while doubts my troubled rest destroying), Shall they to-night (while every hope is dying), Upon my fancied ignorance relying, Meet and rejoice, the flying hours enjoying? It must not be; this scene of amorous toying I neither could prevent, nor even reprove, If 'twere unknown; but when thus known 'twould prove Wrong to permit; take pity, heavens! on me, And if I must betray my jealousyâ Let me, at least, be silent of my love;â This letter, which I wrote, a double Duty must discharge, that by ..... But he comes: ah! vainly I Struggle to conceal my trouble. Enter FREDERICK with a writing-desk and portfolio. FREDERICK. These letters, please your highness, need Your royal signature. FLERIDA. Ah! meâ [Aside. Courage, strength, dexterity, Now my heart requires, indeed;â Frederick, leave the letters there, [Aloud. Which at leisure I desire To peruse; as I require Your service in a new affair, More important in my sight, Since it doth my peace import. FREDERICK. What is it? FLERIDA. That you a short Journey make for me to-night. FREDERICK. To-night? FLERIDA. To-night; and here I give The letter ..... FREDERICK, aside. Grief begins anew! FLERIDA. Which you will bring along with you. FREDERICK. You know, my lady, that I live Only solicitous to show My zeal to serve you; that my breast Throbs every hour to know how best To pay the duty that I owe;â When I assure you that to-day My health requires it, I believe That I the favour will receive Which now I ask, and that I may Obtain, SeÃ±ora, leave from thee To rest this evening, or permit ..... FLERIDA. No, no excuse can I admit;â So trifling will the absence be, You can be back by morning's light;â And think of this, that I confide Even my honour and my pride Into your faithful charge this night:â So no excuse:âthis letter take, And on the instant go away, Without postponement or delay; The affair is urgent, I shall make, Some time, a confidant of you; In person you shall bring it where The superscription shall declare,â Bring a reply, and so adieu! Exit. FREDERICK. This night, fair Laura said that she Would grant me leave to speak to her;â Has it not then through all its sphere One friendly star to shine for me? What shall I do? How keep sincere My love, nor do my duty wrong? Enter FABIO. FABIO. Is not the day extremely long? FREDERICK. It was the devil sent you here;â This very instant, (cruel pain!) I must depart; (what suffering!) Two saddled horses, Fabio, bring. FABIO. Has a letter come again By the fire or the breezes, pray? FREDERICK. One has come. FABIO. What needs it more Than to amend it as before, And be glad as Christmas-day;â Look at it again, indeed You will find it read much better. FREDERICK. Even the name upon the letter I have not the strength to read;â FABIO. Read it then, perchance it may Not be what you thought it meant. FREDERICK. I shall see to whom I'm sent; âTo the duke of Mantuaââ Now begins a new confusion: [Aside. Doubtless she the duke doth know, And in this way seeks to show Unto me, that my collusion, Hiding him within my dwelling,â Treason is, though not intended; 'Tis for this she is offended, This the reason of her telling That her pride did so demand it.â Oh! I step from brink to brink! FABIO. Does it mend? FREDERICK. The more I think, Less and less I understand it. FABIO. Is it in cipher? FREDERICK. What vexation! FABIO. Like that sent some time ago With figures? FREDERICK. Oh! I do not know. FABIO. Listen then to the narration: In Tremezen there lived a man That dealt in glass, who felt a flame For a fair and comely dame Of the place; in Tetuan Long had lived his greatest friend;â She her lover asked one day To write unto his friend, and pray That he would a monkey send. As lovers ever offer more Than even a mistress deigns to ask, So he went beyond his task, And ordered over three or four. She may have her choice, he said, When the number thus is rifer;â But the gawk adopting cipher, He of Tetuan thus read: âFriend, for one whom I revere And would please, I beg of thee To send to me immediately 3 or 4 good monkeys here.ââ Mistaking âOrâ for O:âthe affair Was hard enough to manage well,â But the glassman's rage to tell, When upon his brittle ware Soon (alas! not five or six) He, with frenzied eyes surveying, Saw three hundred monkeys playing Thrice three thousand monkey tricks!â If the ciphers cause your rigours, Free the meaning from these fetters, For one ape in Spanish letters Turns a hundred apes in figures. FREDERICK. Thus to thwart me! to encumber! Rob the hope that made me rich! FABIO. Is there not some means, by which You may send a lesser number? FREDERICK. Who in all the world was ever So confused? What shall I do? Enter HENRY. HENRY. What disturbs you? FREDERICK. Any clue Is, I see, a vain endeavour!â Hear the cause apart. They retire and converse together. FABIO. They go Out of hearing: how absurd, To doubt of me! I never heard Any guest who spoke so low. FREDERICK. What is best to do, I doubt. HENRY. Let us to your house repair; Here we cannot speak, and there That the letter may point out. If she knows my rank and name, Then my only course can be To avow myself: if she Still doth know not who I am, New expedients we shall try, Which may set all matters rightâ I shall write to her to-night, What you'll bring as my reply. FREDERICK. You say well: if I obtain, From what it says, or does not say, The happy privilege to stay This night in Parma, I shall gain For all my sore anxiety, For all my griefs and sorrows past, A compensating joy at last, And still preserve my loyalty;â For if the letter was for thee, It is no fault in me to do As I was toldâto give it you, No matter where the place might be. HENRY. When the letter we have read, We shall know her whole design. FABIO. Shall I get, O master mine, Horses ready, as you said? FREDERICK. Fabio, yes: because, though I Shall not go, it must appear That I did. FABIO. What joy is here! What means this? FREDERICK. Let love reply. FABIO. Now so glad? FREDERICK. Is joy admired As something strange? FABIO. Oh! no, for you Find the .... FREDERICK. What? FABIO. The cipher's clue, And all the apes are not required. Exeunt. SCENE II. âA ROOM IN THE PALACEâEVENING. Enter LAURA. LAURA. Oh! how tardy is the dying Of a day of hope! It seemeth As if night had all forgotten Its alternate realm to rule. Since so slowly fall its shadows,â Mournful birds descending lightly, Beating their nocturnal pinions, Spreading out their murky plumes;â Ah! my Frederick, if the moment Came that I would fly to see thee, Then with thee would all my troubles Be consoled and soothed to peace; And Flerida:âAh! my mistress, Why those efforts art thou making, By which thou thy scorn dissemblest, And false favour dost pretend?â I must pass to her apartment Ere the dusky gardens call me, As to some anticipated Pang of my afflicted fate,â By so doing, I shall compass Two advantages, preventing By the first her fear'd inquiries, By the last my longing sighs; Since so often occupation Speeds the leaden-footed moments, Making hours appear the shorter, Though no shorter be their flight. Enter FLERIDA. FLORA follows with lights. FLERIDA. Laura, cousin, does my friendship Merit at thy hands this absence? All this day I have not seen thee. LAURA. As a favour I esteem, That you deigned to miss me, lady; 'Twas a slight and casual illness Kept me from thy side so long: And though yet but convalescent, Ere retiring for the night-time, I would kiss your hand in going, And respectfully inquire How you feel yourself, SeÃ±ora. FLERIDA. I am sorry that your absence Was occasioned by your health, But am glad that you have hither Come to see me, even though late. Since, indeed, this night, dear Laura, I require your presence here,â So, take notice, you continue With me. LAURA. Think, reflect, SeÃ±ora. ... FLERIDA. Why reflect? When you a thousand Times have done the same through kindness, Do it to oblige me once,â For to thee alone, my cousin, Can I tell a certain secret. LAURA, aside. Was there ever such confusion? If I answer, I but raise Some suspicion, (Heaven assist me!) And if not, I lose. ... FLERIDA. What say you? LAURA. That I ever am thy faithful Servant. FLERIDA, to Flora. Leave us here alone:â [Exit Flora. Laura, give me your attention. I have ascertained, a lover (Scarcely can I tell it thee) Has but now received a letter From some lady, with a promise Him to meet to-night. LAURA, aside. O heavens! FLERIDA. And although I know the lover, I the lady do not know. LAURA, aside. But I do. FLERIDA. I must discover Who, from out these trellised windows That look down upon the terrace, Dares to outrage the decorum Of my never-broken laws. LAURA. You do very right, for truly 'Tis a most unheard-of daring. FLERIDA. 'Tis not fitting that in person I descend, nor were it right; And I thus, my lovely Laura, Trust to you; for you alone, You, of all the many persons Unto whom imagination Wandered in its searching flight, Have escaped the smallest shadow Of the most remote suspicion. LAURA. What are then your orders? FLERIDA. These: Once and many a time descending To the garden through the night, You become the watchful sentry Of my honour, reconnoitring Whom you meet within its bounds. Think not that my care arises Solely from decorum, Laura; No, I wish to know the lady Frederick lovesâ(with strange imprudence Has my tongue declared his name; But it matters little!)âcousin, This is what I charge you with. LAURA. Needlessly thou dost implore me, Since, attentive to thy pleasure, And obedient to thy will, Not alone, as thou commandest, Shall I pay a thousand visits To the garden,âno, till morn Shall it be my joy to stay there, Proud and happy thee to serve. Takes the light, as if going. FLERIDA. I entrust my peace, my honour, Unto thee, my friend and cousin; Thou hast ready wit and prudence, Laura mine, be these thy guideâ Go then, in the way thou wishest; I will only say my feelings Equal thine, and must be grateful. Exit. LAURA. God preserve me! Oh! how many Objects at one time present them To my mind; upon each other Crowd they so, and so depend, That when I would make an ending Of them all, I find I cannot Choose the foremost to begin. But why grieve thus? It is better To leave all this tangled net-work To the unravelling of time; And to gain on time the sooner, Silence is the best conductor, Till with Frederick I can speak; He must necessarily show me, By his voice or by his face, If he loves me or deceives me. She enters at one side and returns by the other. O thou fair and beauteous garden, Whose eternal green republic Is the chosen clime of April,â April only dwelling here, It the God that makes thy spring-time, It the King that rules thy year; She who oft came hither freely To thy fair and fertile bowers, To confide her love's sweet secrets, To thy flowers and to thy fountains, To thy fountains and thy flowers; Now comes hither, forced and bidden, Sleepless, anxious, full of fear, To discover who has hidden, With perfidious hand, the aspen Jealousy, within my breast. A noise within at the grate. In the street the signal's given; Full of terror, full of doubt Beats my heart: but for what reason? If, in all the world, no being Can more boldly danger dare, Since 'tis jealousy defends me ...... Who is there? Frederick appears at the grated window. FREDERICK. Oh! do not ask me, Beauteous Laura mine, unless You desire my sure enjoyment Should be changed to sad distrust; If not I, who could it be? LAURA. Do not wonder, do not murmur, That I did not recognise thee, Since, indeed, you are another Person from the one I thought. FREDERICK. In what manner? LAURA. In this manner:â Frederick, at this grate, the duchess Left me to find out the lady That to-night did here invite thee; From which clearly I infer That you have betrayed my favours. FREDERICK. May the listening Heaven, my Laura. ... Mine I said, do not reproach me, That when truths I came to utter, I thus falsely should begin;â May the angry heavens destroy me, May a bolt of forkÃ©d lightning Strike me dead, if from my breast Faintest accents ever issued, That my secret could profane! Why need more to undeceive you, Than that she confides in you?â And moreover, how, I pray thee, Could she tell thee watch for me, When she must suppose me absent On a journey, of whose nature I have not now time to tell? LAURA. Though so far you exculpate you, Now explain to me the cause Of the interest she taketh, Frederick, in thus detecting Who it is that favours you? FREDERICK. As to that, though I am doubtful, That the cause of these inquiries Springs from me and not herself, Were it not to give thee, Laura, Even a greater triumph still,â And to bring thy love in deeper Debt to mine, to speak my thought?â He who wins what's not resisted Scarcely can be said to win:â Do not baffle my complainings, Since they have a surer base In Lisardo, there exchanging Seeming ills for certain woes;â Say, ah Laura! must you wed him? LAURA. I wed not: it is misfortune Forms the wish, and not my heart. FREDERICK. One who loves can conquer all things. LAURA. That is true: 'tis also certain, One who loves, all danger fears. FREDERICK. Then why write to me that letter, Laura, where you fondly vowed, Ere you'll lose me, life shall leave thee;â That my portrait I should bring In return for thine you sent me? LAURA. There was not the inconvenience, Frederick, that has since arisen. FREDERICK. What a poor excuse you give me, For your sudden change! Ah! Laura, If your firm resolve is taken, Why waste time at such a moment? Why waste words in speaking to me?â See the portrait that you asked for Comes to be the only witness Of my jealousy:âbehold! In its setting, it appeareth Similar to that dear image That you sent me, when with joy Looked my happy fortune on me;â For it was my poor ambition, Since the jewel was not equal, That the case that hid it were:â Take it, and but this I ask thee, If another thou shouldst wed, Look not on it: though but painted, It will silently upbraid. LAURA. Frederick, I .... But hark! I hear Footsteps through the street approaching. FREDERICK. Ah! perhaps you then had told me Something would have given me joy, If you were not interrupted? LAURA. Thine I am, and thine for ever, Had I said, and now I say it. FREDERICK. Let him come, whoe'er is coming;â No, they turn another way. LAURA. Notwithstanding that, 'tis needful That I close the grating now. Frederick, let my word of parting Be a word of caution too: Jealous eyes are watching o'er us. FREDERICK. Need we more for our protection Than to watch them too? LAURA. And how? FREDERICK. I shall send to you a cipher In the morning, which will show, How before the court and duchess You can speak direct to me;â And without the least suspicion, In the presence of them all, Loudly speak, and loudly answer. LAURA. This will be, unless I err, What is called the spoken secret. FREDERICK. Use all caution in the reading Of the letter I shall bring. LAURA. I will do so. God defend thee! FREDERICK. Heaven protect thy precious life. LAURA. Love! what bitter pangs you cost me. FREDERICK. Laura! what to me you owe! Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âTHE PARK AND GARDENS. Enter FREDERICK and FABIO, in travelling dresses, and HENRY. Henry. Frederick, I cannot persuade me, That the letter of the duchess Had a more mysterious meaning Than what it appears to be; Namely, but a courteous answer To the one I lately brought:â And she merely sent you with it For the adventitious honour That the bearer might impart; Thinking doubtless it were proper, I, the duke's relation seeming, That her messenger should equal His in point of birth and rank. Do not fear that she suspecteth Who I am: and so the best Plan for you is, thus pretending That from Mantua you come With this letter, which I give you. She will never dream or doubt, Seeing here my hand and signet, But that there you must have been. FREDERICK. Though I recognise with clearness All these reasons, and your letter Leaves no doubt upon the subject That your person is unknown; Still the fact of her commanding My departure yester-evening, When a lady had appointed Secretly to speak with me; That same lady then declaring That her highness had discovered, How or when she could not tell me, All about that trysting-time,â When I feel her reputation Stands in peril every moment; All these thoughts must leave me, Henry, Some remaining grounds of grief. HENRY. 'Tis a subject that requireth Greater leisure: take the letter, Let us kill the first suspicion, And the second soon shall die, Almost of itself; the letter, Frederick, take, and so adieu. FREDERICK. Will you not approach the palace?â HENRY. Surely yes; if it in all things Is the country of my soul, It its very sphere and centre, Every instant that it liveth Out of it, it lives in pain. Exit. FABIO. Must a man of honour bear this? FREDERICK. What do you complain of, Fabio? FABIO. I complain, my lord, of naught; Merely ask a calculation Of the time I thee have served: If for every hour you gave me What you give me for a year, I declare to God, another Hour I would not wish to serve. FREDERICK. Why? FABIO. Because my luckless noddle Is turned topsy-turvy thinking, And there's not enough of money Up and down the world, to pay Any servant who must think of All the bedlam things you say. FREDERICK. How prove this? FABIO. Just in this way: Fabio! I am dying, Fabio; This is my last living day,â Hope and life shall die together; Shall I order then your hearse? I inquire, and you replying, AnswerâNo, I shall not die, For the night that is approaching Shall be glorious day to me:â I am very glad to hear it:â Fabio!âMaster! I must go On a journey, get two horses Ready-saddledâit is done:â Now I shall not go, but bring them,â Mount on one; I do: how far Have we gone? A league: then homeward, Turn about: and so we turn; Let us seek at once our dwelling; Mind you follow not my steps;â And a thousand contradictions, Little secrets without end, Which the devil could not fathom. For, in fine, I do not like Any master who thus deals in, Without being Pope or Pontiff, Cases rightly called âreserved.â FREDERICK. Silence; for her highness cometh. Mind, remember what I said; That by no means you discover How nor you nor I were absent Out of Parma all last night. FABIO. Oh! of course:ânow I am dying [Aside. To reveal it to Flerida, For three simple reasons: first, To regale my tongue a little; Secondly, for vengeance' sake; Thirdly, to oblige her highness. Exit. SCENE II. âANOTHER PART OF THE GARDENS. Enter FLERIDA and LAURA. FLERIDA. So, dear Laura, no one ventured Down to seek the peaceful region Of the garden? LAURA. Say, how oft Do you wish that I should tell thee? FLERIDA. This once only. LAURA. Then believe me, That within its beauteous limits I remained until the morn, Laughing at my strict obedience, Turned its laughter into tears,â Scattering pearls o'er all its roses, Still the garden no one sought: So that for your wild suspicions, Save myself, perhaps, SeÃ±ora, No one now can give thee grounds. FLERIDA. Yes they can, because 'twere easy, Laura ..... LAURA. What? FLERIDA. Even for that lady To discover Frederick's absence On a sudden call of duty, Which prevented her from going To the garden through the night; But at least this consolation I have gained, that I prevented Once, at least, their conversation, And the meeting they had hoped. LAURA. That is clear:âthou little dreamest [Aside. That thy foolish, jealous nature Has been like a magic girdle, Binding those thou wouldst divide. Enter FREDERICK and FABIO. FREDERICK. Let me kiss your hand, SeÃ±ora. FLERIDA. Why with such swift expedition Have you hastened homeward, Frederick? FREDERICK. The desire I had to serve thee Would not let me travel slower. FABIO. Yes, SeÃ±ora; and to Mantua As it's but a league ..... FREDERICK. What say you? FABIO. Oh! I meant to say a dozen. FLERIDA. Do you bring his grace's answer? FREDERICK. Could I hither come without it? FABIO, aside. Well, I never heard such lying Done with such a cool assurance. FREDERICK. This, SeÃ±ora, is the letter. [Presents it. FLERIDA, aside. Yes, 'tis his, my vengeance miss'd not. FABIO, aside to FREDERICK. Who wrote this? FREDERICK. The duke of Mantua. FABIO. Even me you would bamboozle? FLERIDA. How have you been yourself? FREDERICK. So happy, In the respectful love I bear thee, So rejoiced is my obedience To be ever in thy service, That I vow to thee, SeÃ±ora, Never night appear'd more pleasant. FABIO, aside. I believe so: though he striveth To dissemble thus, he cannot Quite succeed. LAURA, aside. The sly expression Of his face conveys two meanings. FLERIDA reads. âFor the honours and attentions Which your grace has paid to Henry, And to me, by your despatching Even your secretary hither, I, indeed, feel so indebted, That my soul becometh bankrupt, Knowing it is wholly powerless To repay, with aught sufficient, One or other obligation; More than this, when I bethink me How my soul is sweetly prisoned In a servitude .....â Resumes. No further:â This is of another matter;â I am pleased extremely, Frederick, At your diligent demeanour In this business. FREDERICK. And, SeÃ±ora, I am proud at so succeeding. FLERIDA. You are weary: rest a little:â After that, return: despatches Of importance wait my signing. FREDERICK. First permit me, ere I leave you, To present SeÃ±ora Laura With this letter in your presence, For as I would scarcely venture, Through respect, to address the lady, So 'twere wrong in me to give it At a time that might offend thee. Gives Laura a letter. FLERIDA. Whose is this? FREDERICK. Indeed, I know not. From the chambers of the duchess, Mother of the duke, a lady Came and gave it me; I fancy, Some old friend or near relation. FABIO, aside. Listening to these lies doth make me Dull and stupid as a donkey. LAURA. Yes, SeÃ±ora, the hand-writing Now I see is Madame Celia's. With your leave, I shall withdraw For a little while to read it,â 'Till I get beyond her eye-sight, [Aside. I shall move half dead with terror. FREDERICK, aside to LAURA. Read it quickly. LAURA, to him. I shall do so. [Exit. FLERIDA. Go with God. FREDERICK. For endless ages Live! and may the bright sun count them! Exit. FLERIDA. How contented, oh! how happy Do I feel that I prevented This love-meeting; for, though many Doubts remain behind, yet also Vigilance remains to teach me How to mar all future meetings. FABIO, aside. If the future prove like this one, You, for certain, have great reason To be proud of your manÅuvres. FLERIDA. Fabio! FABIO. Madam, I have waited To speak with you: 'till he left you I have linger'd here, pretending To be looking at these frescoes. FLERIDA. Tell me, if, upon the journey, He seemed grieved at his departure. FABIO. What departure? FLERIDA. Yester-evening's. FABIO. Do you then, my lady, fancy That he went from this last evening? FLERIDA. Why, of course, he must have done so, Otherwise how could he bring me, Not alone the duke's sealed answer, But his autographâhis letter, Every line his own hand-writing? FABIO. How, I know not:âwe departed, Went about a league's short distance, And came back again. FLERIDA. What say you? FABIO. Truth the clearest, most undoubted, Or there's none on earth; he left me At his rooms, with strict injunctions Not to budge an inch beyond them, When he went to meet his sweet-heart. FLERIDA. Oh! it cannot be: unsay it. FABIO. Then 'twas she who came to meet him. FLERIDA. Quick! and tell me what remaineth. FABIO. He came home at morning, giving Many joyful demonstrations Of a very kind reception. FLERIDA. Your audacious tongue is lying. FABIO. Lies are duels; two must make them. FLERIDA. Who then sent he with the letter? FABIO. No one. FLERIDA. How obtain the answer? FABIO. Why, what difficulty is there? Since a man who has a demon Ever bringing notes and billets, Can with equal ease compel him Fetch and carry longer letters;â Certainly some strange familiar He must have: this proposition Proves I do not lie. FLERIDA. However, Still I hold that you are lying. FABIO. No; I vow to God, my lady, This is true, and true as gospel, That he did not leave this city, But the whole night spent in speaking With his mistress. FLERIDA. Peace, and leave me. Laura cometh, I am anxious To find out, that I may free me From the doubts that round me thicken, What this letter is he brought her. FABIO, aside. Well, God help thee for a duchess, In the anxious search you're making To find out who is the lady Frederick woos; and he, by Heaven! Is so slow to understand her!â Ah! with me if she would act so, I would see it in a moment. Exit. Enter LAURA. LAURA, aside. Now that I have read the cipher, I return to see the duchess, That she may have no suspicion Of the cause of my retirement. FLERIDA. Laura, what has Celia written In her letter? LAURA. Oh! a thousand Silly, foolish things, SeÃ±ora. This is it, if you would read it:â I will give her the enclosure, [Aside. Which was placed there for deception, Having first removed the cipher. FLERIDA. Laura, no, I will not read it; All I wish is that you clearly Understand my cause of trouble. Yesterday, as I have told you, I discovered that a lady Had presumed to write to Frederick, And appoint an hour to meet him Late last night. LAURA. 'Tis so, SeÃ±ora. FLERIDA. First, my motive was this outrage On decorum: then a feeling, Partly curious, partly anxious, To find out this unknown lady, Made me order his departure, And your vigil in the garden. Hear now what a spy has told me, One whose place is ever near him, That last night (ah me! the torture!) Frederick went not forth from Parma, But remained the whole night speaking With his mistress in the garden. LAURA. Was there ever heard such boldness? Did he name the lady? FLERIDA. No. LAURA. Then, SeÃ±ora, do not trust him; For, supposing he deceived you With this counterfeited letter, To what end would he deceive me Also with the one he brought me? FLERIDA. Are you certain that this letter Is your cousin's? LAURA. I am certain. FLERIDA. Then he must some other person Have despatched for both the letters, Who has baffled my informant. LAURA. Yes, no doubt. FLERIDA. But still remaineth One more doubt. You spent the night-time In the garden, and no lady To the trellised grate descended; Thus 'tis certain, if the story Of this man be true, how Frederick Spent the whole night till the morning With his mistress, that she is not Any one within the palace. LAURA. Do not doubt it; it is easy To believe she's of the city. FLERIDA. Still I'll make a thousand efforts, Each surpassing each in daring, To find out who is this lady. LAURA. Why concern yourself, SeÃ±ora? FLERIDA. Ask not such a foolish question. Laura, since to thee confiding, Since confessing to thy bosom The affliction that I suffer,â What imports it, if he know not? For my pride is so excessiveâ So extreme my haughty natureâ That I cannot let him wound them, Even though he know them not. Exit. LAURA. 'Tis essential to apprise him Of these curious overwatchingsâ Of these jealous-eyed espials; But, ah me! the very reason That I give him to be cautious Will reveal to him the secret Of Flerida's jealous heart;â And it is no prudent action To inform the firmest lover That another loves him well; For the humblest heart is tainted So with vanity's sweet poison, That what once it thought a favour, Soon a thankless debt becomes:â Still it is of less importance, Than that he should know not (Heaven!) Of the spies that clog his footsteps, And the dangers that surround: To advise him, I am anxious Now to make a re-perusal Of the cipher that he gave me, Which I should remember well. She conceals the letter which she has been holding, and takes out another, which she reads. âWhen you ever wish, SeÃ±ora, By your voice of aught to warn me, You will make, at the beginning, With your handkerchief a sign, That I thus may be attentive;â Then upon whatever matter You would speak, the words that open Lines that pauses follow quickly, Will be meant for me alone, And the rest for those about us;â Then by joining in succession All these first words, one by one, I can know what you would tell me; And the same course you will follow When I make the sign in turn.â [Resumes. The plan is easy and ingenious; But a difficulty seemeth In effecting such a junction As will make the separate senses Clear to us, and to the others. Not to err, again I'll read it. Reads to herself. Enter LISARDO. LISARDO, aside. So absorb'd and so attentive, Laura looks upon a letter, That although, 'tis true, no feeling Of a vile suspicious kind, Based on jealousy, could make me Fail in that respect I owe her, Yet a foolish, curious longing Makes me wish to know the pith Of a letter so attractive. Would that I could read that paper From this spot, unseen by her! LAURA. Who is there? LISARDO. 'Tis I. LAURA, aside. O sorrow! LISARDO. Why this trouble? this confusion? ...... LAURA. Neither troubled nor confused ....... LISARDO. Why, that crumpled paper shows it, And your rising blush betrays. LAURA. Better read these indications, Crumpled letterârising bloomâ You will see they do not follow As the consequence of grief, But the plain effects of insult, Which you thus by your suspicious Want of confidence inflict; You a traitor! you a secret Spy upon my simplest act!â Guilt's best remedy is ever [Aside. Thus to thunder in complaint. LISARDO. Laura, I do not distrust thee, And that thou mayst know how strong, How confiding is the feeling That my heart preserves for thee, Fearing naught of what thou'rt hiding, I shall let my tongue demand What that paper is. LAURA. A paper Which in little floating fragments I shall give unto the air; For, to such a foolish questionâ Idle as the windâ'tis right That the wind should give the answer. Tears it. LISARDO. From the wind I shall regain it, Since you give it to the wind. LAURA. Never! though quite unimportant Your attempt to join them so; Still my reputation needeth That my anger should chastise All these base and vile suspicions Which you dare to show to me. LISARDO. But ..... LAURA. Behold! the wind has ta'en them: As my husband you are not, You have no right to presume thus. LISARDO. As thy cousin, and thy lover, Though, alas! not yet thy husband, I must reunite the fragments Of this serpent of evasion, That in every scattered letter Deadly venom still doth hold. LAURA. Do not so; for this, Lisardo, Which you call a bloody serpent, Is a snake beneath my feet. LISARDO. Though amid the flowers I perish, I will stoop and gather. LAURA. No. LISARDO. Let me, Laura, LAURA. Hold! Ungrateful. Enter at one side ARNESTO, and at the other FLERIDA: a little after, FREDERICK and FABIO. ARNESTO. What is all this noise, Lisardo? FLERIDA. Laura, what is all this outcry? LISARDO. It is nothing. LAURA. Nay, your highness, It is much: now, love, assist me! Aside. ARNESTO. Wilt thou speak thus? [To Lisardo. FLERIDA. Wilt thou quarrel? [To Laura. ARNESTO. With thy cousin? FLERIDA. Thy betrothed? ARNESTO. Say, Lisardo, what has happened? FLERIDA. Laura, what has passed between you? LISARDO. It is nothing that I know of. LAURA. It is much: you know, SeÃ±ora, That you left me here this instant Reading Madam Celia's letter. FLERIDA. Yes. LAURA. And being thus employed, I Was insulted by Lisardo, Who, with insolent presumption, Dared to treat me with suspicion: And, that you may know the reason, Kind SeÃ±ora, prithee listenâ Listen, also, thou my father, And the friends who have come with thee: For to me it is important All the world should know the secret That I carry in my bosom. Takes out her handkerchief. FREDERICK. Tell me what has happened, Fabio. FABIO. I don't know: [aside] since I am certain It is not about the matter That I mentioned to the duchess, It doth give me little trouble. FREDERICK. Since I see she gives the signal [Aside. Let me pay her strict attentionâ Joining the first words she utters. ARNESTO. Speak, my daughter. What delays you? FLERIDA. Laura, end your hesitation. LAURA. Fleridaâwhom kind Heaven above Hasâgiven alike both wit and beauty: Alreadyâis my humble duty Knownâto thee by years of love. FLERIDA. 'Tis true; but why this trembling tone? Why, now, remind me of it, pray? FREDERICK, aside. The first four words expressly say, âFlerida has already known.â LAURA. Thatâmy heart must this avow!â You did notâthink to hear this sighing Go fromâout my lips, relying Hereâon thy protection now. ARNESTO. Enough, enough, why shed a tear? The simplest word will do instead. FREDERICK, aside. Again the words have plainly said, âThat you did not go from here.â LAURA. And thatâfrom you should come this strife! You metâme here, Lisardo: Why Your ladyâthus insult? for I, DearâLove be praised! am not thy wife. LISARDO. It is yourself that wronged the near Affection that should bind us two. FLERIDA, to Laura. Do you proceed:âbe silent you. [To Lisardo. FREDERICK, aside. âAnd that you met your lady dear.â LAURA. For whichâunkind discourtesy, Herâheart must feel, who meant no wrong, Jealousyâundisguised and strong Is shownâthus openly by thee. LISARDO. The letter you perused alone, Did you not tear when I came near it? ARNESTO. Perfectly right she did to tear it. FREDERICK, aside. âFor which her jealousy is shown.â LAURA. Rememberâwhat my anger vows, ThatâI will die ere wed with thee: Youâmy father insist that he Name me notâhis affianced spouse. ARNESTO, to Lisardo. From the disgrace in which you have got, How will you free yourself? LISARDO. Heart-broken Am I. ARNESTO. Be silent. FREDERICK, aside. She has spoken, âRemember that you name me not.â LAURA. Becauseâwhat tyrant spouse were he, The manâeven now in courtship's hour, Who livesâ'neath jealousy's dark power? With theeâwhat would the after be? LISARDO. My error was my jealousy; Then, lovely Laura, pray forgive. ARNESTO, to Lisardo. The worst excuse that you could give. FREDERICK, aside. âFor the man who lives with thee.â LAURA. Isâthis poor apology Your greatestâgrief for being rude? Enemyâof all that's good, Meet meâhenceforth an enemy; To-nightâavoid my averted sight: Atâmorn, my usual smile thou'lt miss; The sameâdark cloud that shadows this Spotâon thy hopes shall ne'er grow bright. Exit. ARNESTO. The punishment that thou hast got You have deserved; I'm wroth with thee. Exit. FREDERICK, aside. âIs your greatest enemy:â Meet me to-night at the same spot.â. FLERIDA. It, Lisardo, ill became you Thus to treat fair Laura so; But as I the reason know, I must not too strictly blame you:â He would tear away the mask, [Aside. And is jealous for not seeing;â I, a more unhappy being, Jealous am, but dare not ask! [Exit. FABIO, aside. Well, thank God! I feel much bolder, Since Flerida left this spot, For my master now cannot Learn from her the news I told her. LISARDO. Heaven protect me! 'tis exceeding All I ever heard or knew! Frederick, let me know, if you Think, because I found her reading, And but asked to see the letter, That it could so much offend her? Vex her father too, and render Even Flerida little better? Say, if it is known to thee, What could cause the great excess Of her indignation? FREDERICK. Yes, For the cause is clear to me; Laura is with you offended For your want of confidence. LISARDO. Ah! my foolish want of sense! Ah! my hope, how soon thou'rt ended! Exit. FREDERICK, aside. Ah! how mine has taken flight! FABIO, aside. I have nothing now to dread. FREDERICK, aside. Let me join what she has said, If I can remember right; For which purpose I will seek, O my planet! to restrict your Influence; and by her picture, Think I hear her sweet lips speak. Takes out a portrait. Beauteous image, loved so well, What you said but now, repeat. FABIO, aside. Ah! a picture!âwell, 'tis sweet To have something new to tell. FREDERICK, aside. âFlerida has already known That you did not go from here, And that you met your lady dear, For which her jealousy is shown;â Remember that you name me not; Because the man who lives with thee Is your greatest enemy: Meet me to-night at the same spot.â To Fabio. By Heaven! thou traitor, most abhorred, 'Tis thou my secret that hast sold,â 'Tis thou, O villain, that hast told I did not go away! [Strikes him. FABIO. My lord, What sudden fit of anger now Has seized upon you, that you so Severely treat me? FREDERICK. Well I know The reason, traitor. FABIO. Then avow The reason of it first of all: Did you not enter here with me The best of friends? What testimony Could you meet with in this hall, Speaking to neither young or old?â Who maligned me? let me hear. FREDERICK. Villain, since I entered here, I found out that you have told How I did not go last night, And that I met my mistress too. FABIO. Heard it here, you say? FREDERICK. I do. FABIO. Think now, master ...... FREDERICK. By this light I'll chastise you, for your profit. FABIO. Tell me, which of the ladies said it? FREDERICK. Her you told may have the credit, For 'twas she who told me of it. FABIO. I told no one:âDeath is bliss [Aside. Compared to telling truth, I feel. FREDERICK. Well, by Heaven! beneath my steel You die this instant. [Draws his sword. Enter HENRY. HENRY. What means this? FREDERICK. It means that I a wretch would kill. FABIO. Ah! hold, SeÃ±or! HENRY. My friend, reflect; This is the palace, recollect. FREDERICK. Let me the villain's vile blood spill. HENRY to Fabio. Fly! FABIO. Like a deer before the chase, Since you so kindly ope the way; This happens almost every day:â Well! what a tattler is her grace! Aside, and exit. HENRY. Why do you seem so discomposed? What has affected your condition? FREDERICK. The perilous and strange position This villain's conduct hath imposed:â Flerida, Henry, has come by The knowledge that I did not go. HENRY. Who has informed her? FREDERICK. None did know Except this servant, you, and I. HENRY. Has she expressed it? FREDERICK. She? ah! no; If wroth, she is too wise to show it, And seems as if she did not know it. HENRY. Perhaps whoever told you so Invented it. FREDERICK. No, no, for she Is frightened for her own dear sake. HENRY. Perhaps there may be some mistake. FREDERICK. Alas! I know it cannot be. And so, I see no way, in sooth, To make amends for my transgression, Than to make a clear confession And avow the simple truth. HENRY. Although in that case I would prove The guiltier of the two, be sure To make thy mind again secure; I might such desperate means approve, If indeed it were the true And certain means to gain that end. FREDERICK. In such a trouble, say, my friend, What would you think the best to do? HENRY. I would be silent, till the affair Took clearer shape, and then act so:â For she knows, or does not know. If she know it, and her fair Discretion glides the matter over, Were it right in you to go, And what she wish'd not to know, By your own tongue thus discover?â If she know it not, 'twill be Doubly wrong to me and you, That what she from no one knew She should strangely learn from thee.â Were I thou, I would at first Flatter Fabio, as yet He may be faithful:âdo not let Revenge provoke him:âat the worst Give him not new grounds to go With complainings to her grace; Lest, perforce, in such a case She must speak and act. FREDERICK. Although Still I feel a strong objection, Differing as I said I do, I will be advised by you, Not to err through my election: Fabio at once I'll trace, I shall talk with fair Flerida, Till she speaks she ne'er shall read a Trace of guilt upon my face. [Exit. HENRY. I, the heir of his confusion, All the doubts he held, inherit, For, although his person leaves me, All his griefs remain behind:â I came here to see Flerida, Thinking then that my ambition (Woe is me!) could not aspire to Any greater good than this:â Now one day pursues another, And I, still disguised, continue At her court, in constant danger Of thus outraging her pride; Since there may be many persons Here who recognise my person, And I thus may make my secret Worship seem a fool's offence; Since, if firstly my intention Was to act a part, and follow Up the false with truer issues, Why delay to do so now? Enter FLERIDA. FLERIDA, aside. Once again, O tyrant passion! Once again, with blind attraction Wilt thou draw me ......? Hush! 'tis Henry. HENRY. Noblest lady, I impart To these listening flowers and fountains, Of which thou art the aurora, Love's complainings. FLERIDA. And for what? HENRY. For at seeing thee, SeÃ±ora, Beauteous goddess of this flower-worldâ Deity of this sweet place,â Killing like the sun with radiance, And with glances, like love's darts,â I exclaimed, To-day you need not Squander, Love, your ammunition: If one beam alone can conquer, If one dart can all suffice, Why, O tyrant Love, employ thus Such a host of darts and beams? FLERIDA. This discourse awakens, Henry, Two surprises, which are these: First, that you should so address me; Secondly, that I should hear. Leave my presence: if his highness Sent you to my court, it was Not that you should act the traitor Unto him as well as me. HENRY. Nor to him, nor you, SeÃ±ora, Do I think that I am one, Since it is the duke who feeleth Everything that I have said. FLERIDA. Marriages by means of proxy Oft the world has seen, I know, But a lover's wooing never. And though I the fact admit, That it was for him you flatter'd, Did I not expressly say, That you should his highness mention Only when I spoke of him? HENRY. Yes, SeÃ±ora, but I never Fancied the condition was, That if you were always silent, I for ever should not speak. FLERIDA. If I am to speak, then, Henry, Some time, let it be to-day, To declare to you how vainly Doth the duke attempt to cross Waves of fire with oars of feather, Or with wax wings seek the sun. Now, withdraw, before I answerâ Rather pride will speak for meâ With accumulated anger, Henry, to the duke and you. HENRY. I obey you, madam, fearing Greater punishment may come,â If the greatest is not leaving Loveliness like thine: 'tis death! Exit. FLERIDA. Deeply has this sudden boldness Given me food for thought: O love, Leave, oh! leave a little moment, My imagination free To examine ...... But who enters? Who has ventured here? Enter FABIO. FABIO. 'Tis I:â O most prating of princesses! I, whose heart is overflowed With the many-billowed load Of the weight that it oppresses, For my being such a prater; And, although 'tis rude in stating, Yet I must assert, in prating That your highness is a greater. FLERIDA. What would you tell by this? confess. FABIO. What did you tell by that? avow, In your late conversation? FLERIDA. Now I understand your meaning less. FABIO. Did it arise from your believing That what I told you would have rotted, If in your noddle you had got it An hour or so without revealing? FLERIDA. Who, was it then I told it to? FABIO. To no one if it was not he, Who, full of rage and cruelty, When you had just got out of view, Attack'd me in so fierce a way, That if he were not forced to pause, He would have killed me. FLERIDA. Why? FABIO. Because Your highness has too much to say. FLERIDA. But if I spoke not to him since, How can it be that he has got The news from me? FABIO. Why then, if not He learned it from the infernal prince,â Which is unpleasant; as I swell, I burst with news I fear to tell. FLERIDA. Say what it is. FABIO. I do not know. FLERIDA. Did he another letter get? FABIO. Oh! I know nothing. FLERIDA. Has he gone? FABIO. Oh! I know nothing. FLERIDA. Any one Been here to see him, whom he met In secret? FABIO. Still I nothing know. FLERIDA. Then I am forced to think that you Repent of what you vowed to doâ Lately to serve me; and thus show More zeal for Frederick's sake, by such Refusals, than for mine. FABIO. Not this The cause explains. FLERIDA. And what? FABIO. It is Because your highness talks too much. If he finds out this time, in glory Soon, by his hand, I rest. FLERIDA. As yet He has killed you not, and may forget. FABIO. 'Tis true: but hear a little story!â A gay gallant and sprightly dame Were once engaged in conversation; When, enjoying the occasion, An insect that I need not name Thus astutely thought and said: âNow as he can scarcely scratch, I methinks had best despatch A quiet meal, nor danger dread.â The gentleman, with great politeness, Bore it long: but then the gnawing Grew so fearful, that with drawing His right hand unseen, with lightness Attacked the enemy con amore, And with his fingers, ere in flight He could escape from out the fight, Bore him prisoner from that foray!â The lady, turning time enough To see her lover's fingers press'd Against each other, so compress'd As if they held a pinch of snuff, Asked him with a look serene, A serious air her mockery screening,â None being by to know her meaning,â âAnd did he die, that cavalier?â Quite unembarrass'dâself-possess'd, Holding his hand thusâhe replied, âNo, SeÃ±ora, he has not died, Though he is dreadfully hard press'd.â And so this matter, as I view it, Admits the same reply being made: 'Tis little matter not being dead, When I am just the next thing to it. And so I am afraid to say, What all this time I had been saying, But for your treacherous betraying; That, in his hands, I saw to-day A portrait, whence you may discover, If you can get a peep at it, The face and form and every bit Of her of whom he is the lover:â This and more would I endeavour, Lady mine, to tell thee here, But so much your tongue I fear, That expect not I will ever Tell thee this or aught I know: For when thinking of my master, Though my tongue runs fast, yet faster Well I know that yours can go. [Exit. FLERIDA. Ah! he then doth wear a portrait: Now my subtle wit and skill Find some proper mode for drawing Forth the secret from his breast; But with only this precaution That I shun a public place. Enter FREDERICK. FREDERICK, aside. After all, it is the safest Plan, the subject to avoid Until she doth speak about it:â Since you ordered me to come [Aloud. For that purpose, say, SeÃ±ora, Does your highness wish that I Lay before you the despatches? FLERIDA. Yes; but then the open garden Is not an appropriate place, More especially when sinkingâ Lo! in sapphire sets the sun; At his birth an amber cradle, At his death a golden tomb: Bear them to my presence-chamber, And before you enter there, Bear in mind that you this evening Many things for me must write;â If that lady doth expect you Whom so secretly you serve, You should send to her to tell her Not to wait for you to-night; For although the journey's shorter Than the one you lately made, Still the absence is more certain. FREDERICK, aside. What is this, O Heavens! I hear? Enter LAURA. LAURA, aside. Frederick and Flerida here! Since an opportune occasion She deprived me of, so I Shall of one deprive her also:â Has indeed your highness made [Aloud. Compact sweet with April weather, Giving to that beauteous time Lasting loveliness? FLERIDA. How so? LAURA. Since the live-long day you scarcely Leave this gladsome garden sweet,â Giving to the rose its purple, To the jessamine its snow. FLERIDA. Now at least I wish to leave it; Let us, Laura, go: do you Follow soon with the despatches; And whilst you retire for them, You upon the way may proffer The advice of which I spoke. FREDERICK. I, indeed, am not so favoured As your highness doth presume. Draws out his handkerchief. And this counsel that you give me, I, methinks, can send from this: For ...... LAURA, aside. I see he makes the signal, I must now observe his words. FREDERICK. My blissâhath almost wholly faded; My soulâis but the seat of pain; My lifeâis but death's dreary prelude, SeÃ±oraâsince love's cruel reign. LAURA, aside. âMy bliss, my soul, my life, SeÃ±ora,ââ These are the words that he has said. FREDERICK. Thisâtyrant Love usurps each feeling,â Cruelâthus to pierce my heart, Enemyâof all my dreamings, Of mineâhopes and all my joys. LAURA, aside. What he further says is plainlyâ âThis cruel enemy of mine.â FREDERICK. To-dayâthe anguish of my spirit Preventsâthe tranquil flow of thought, My speakingâis with fear embarrass'd With theeâlest I had failed in aught. LAURA, aside. âTo-day prevents my speaking with thee.â FREDERICK. Do notâblame me, do not leave me, To theâthought that thou'rt displeased; Gardenâthou wilt be my graveyard! Goânot, lady, angry forth. FLERIDA. Goodâsufficient. LAURA, aside. All he uttered Must I, if I can, repeat;â âMy bliss, my soul, my life, SeÃ±ora, This cruel enemy of mine To-day prevents my speaking with thee; Do not to the garden go.â FLERIDA. Laura, come with me, do thou [To Frederick. Follow also on the moment. FREDERICK, aside. Is there any love so wretched? FLERIDA, aside. Is there pain so unrequited? [Exit. LAURA, aside. Is there jealousy more open? [Exit. Enter FABIO. FABIO, aside. Is there any way of leaving Without meeting with my master?â Ah! no sooner said than done, There he standeth. FREDERICK. Fabio! FABIO, retiring. Beat me Not in cold blood now, I pray. FREDERICK. Why thus fly me?âWhat vexation! To dissemble with this knave. [Aside. FABIO. Why the reason is, I fear me, That the civil demon who Whispers now and then such stories In your ear, may now have said Something to my disadvantage, Just as true as was the last. FREDERICK. I have come to learn the real Truth about it, and I know You were faithful. FABIO. Ay, so faithful, That I would to God that some In Madrid were half as honest. FREDERICK. I will give thee a peace-offering,â A new dress. FABIO. A dress? FREDERICK. 'Tis so. FABIO. May your soul for this be covered In a cloak of scarlet hue, With fine pantaloons of crystal And a vest of ambergris, In the life that's everlasting. FREDERICK. But you must inform me this ...... FABIO. What? FREDERICK. And quickly, for I hasten With some papers to her grace ...... FABIO, aside. God now gift my tongue with cunning! FREDERICK. Has Flerida questioned you Aught about my love? FABIO. No surely:â But I have made up my mind, That you are the prince of dunces Not to understand her wish. FREDERICK. Said she something then about me? FABIO. Ay, enough. FREDERICK. Thou liest, knave: Wouldst thou make me think her beauty, Proud and gentle though it be,â Which might soar, even like the heron, To the Sovereign Sun itself,â Could descend with coward pinions At a lowly falcon's call? FABIO. Well, my lord, just make the trial For a day or two, pretend That you love her, and ...... FREDERICK. Supposing That there were the slightest ground For this false, malicious fancy You have formed; there's not a chink In my heart where it might enter:â Since, a love, if not more blestâ Far more equal than the other Holds entire possession there. FABIO. Then you never loved two women At one time? FREDERICK. No. FABIO. Then avow ...... FREDERICK. What? FABIO. That you were very lazy. FREDERICK. That is falsehood, and not love. FABIO. The more the merrier. FREDERICK. In two places How could one make love? FABIO. Why thus:â Near the town of Ratisbon Two conspicuous hamlets lay, One of them called AgerÃ©â The other called MacÃ¡randÃ³n; These two villages, one priest, An humble man of God, 'tis stated, Served, and therefore celebrated Mass in each on every feast: And so one day it came to pass, A native of MacÃ¡randÃ³n Who to AgerÃ© had gone, About the middle of the mass Heard the priest in solemn tone Say, as he the Preface read, âGratias agerÃ©,â The words of the Preface on which Calderon has founded this lively little story are as follow: âVere dignum et justum est, Ã¦quum et salutare, nos tibi semper et ubique gratias agere,â &amp;c. but said Nothing of MacÃ¡randÃ³n. Then to the priest, this worthy made His angry plaint without delay: âYou give but thanks for AgerÃ©, As if your tithes we had not paid!â When this sapient reason reached The noble Macarandonese, They stopp'd their hapless pastor's fees, Nor payed for what he prayed or preached. Seeing his dues had taken wing, He asked his sacristan the cause; He told him wherefore and because:â From that day forth when he would sing The Preface, he took care to intone, Not in a smother'd or a weak way, âTibi semper et ubique GratiasâMacÃ¡randÃ³n.â If from loveâthat god so blindâ Two parishes thou holdest, you Are bound to gratify the two;â And after a few days you'll find, If you do so, soon upon You and me will fall good things, When your lordship wisely sings FlerÃ­da et MacÃ¡randÃ³n. FREDERICK. Think you I have heard your folly? FABIO. If you listened, why not so? FREDERICK. No, my mind can only know Its own tale of melancholy. FABIO. Since you stick to AgerÃ© And reject MacÃ¡randÃ³n, Every hope I fear is gone That love his generous dues will pay. [Exeunt. SCENE III. âA ROOM IN THE PALACE OF THE DUCHESS:âEVENING. Enter FLERIDA and LAURA; LIVIA and FLORA attending with lights. FLERIDA. You can here set down the lights, And then leave me for a little; No society I want,â Even mine own I could dispense with. LIVIA to Flora. What strange sadness! FLORA to Livia. It is more Even than sadness, 'tis delirium. Livia and Flora go out. Laura is about following. FLERIDA. Laura, do not thou retire. LAURA. How, SeÃ±ora, can I serve thee? FLERIDA. By a little kindly act, Since alone your faithful friendship I can trust. LAURA. And your commands? FREDERICK. Are, when Frederick hither cometh, That you stay behind this door, And by every means that caution Can devise, prevent the chance Of a listener. LAURA. Be certain I shall fail not in due care, As you'll see; but has there happened Aught that's new? FLERIDA. I have resolved To find out by a manÅuvre, Who his mistress is. LAURA. Who is His mistress? FLERIDA. Yes. LAURA. I cannot fancy [Aside. In what manner:âoh! if I Can but make her tell the method, When he enters here, I can Secretly apprize him of it. FLERIDA. Hear, then, Laura ...... LAURA. Yes, I hear thee. FLERIDA. That I know, he carries hid ...... But he comes, and now I could not Tell without his hearing me; But I give thee leave to listen To the plan that I have formed:â Now conceal thee. LAURA. I will do so:â Giving little thanks, I own, [Aside. For the licence you have given; Even had you not permitted, I had taken leave to hear. Conceals herself. Enter FREDERICK with a portfolio and papers. FREDERICK. Here, SeÃ±ora, are the papers. FLERIDA. Leave them there, for I no longer Can permit that you should hold them; Or that you should act henceforward As my confidential agent. Faithless servantâbase betrayer Of my interest and honour. FREDERICK. Lady, how have I been wanting In my duty, as to merit For my long and faithful service, Such an infamous reproach? FLERIDA. Dost thou dare to ask me wherefore, Knowing that I have sufficient Evidence to prove thy guilt? FREDERICK. Let me know on what foundation Rests the notion of my guilt ...... LAURA, peeping. I am curious to discover How by such a charge, Flerida Means his lady's name to learn. FREDERICK. And I trust to exculpate me. FLERIDA. I will tell you; information Has been given me of collusion 'Twixt my greatest foe and you! FREDERICK. Ah; SeÃ±ora, if I harboured In my house the Duke of Mantua, It was but the night he sought me Here at Parma in disguise. FLERIDA, aside. How is this?âthe duke! All-seeing Heaven, that knows I only sported With a fond, fictitious anger, Now has sent a real cause! FREDERICK. He has lived within the palace Since your highness spoke unto him. FLERIDA. Was the duke the cavalier whom I admitted to my palace? FREDERICK. Yes, SeÃ±ora. FLERIDA, aside. Oh! how often Is a truth the child of falsehood! LAURA, at the door. Scared by terror after terror, Still I cannot see her meaning. FLERIDA. Why from me was this kept secret? FREDERICK. As the suitor of your highness, I believed that you would pardon What was but love's indiscretion, Not the dark crime of a traitor. FLERIDA. Now, I understand 'twas easy To present my letter to him. FREDERICK. Yes, SeÃ±ora; at the moment I was going on my journey He arrived: and I was able Without going out of Parma, Thus to execute my mission. FLERIDA. Well, allowing that to be so, Tell me, whence came Laura's letter? FREDERICK. Thatâthe duke himself brought with him. LAURA, at the door. He has answered most adroitly; But I yet cannot discover How she means to gain her object. FLERIDA. Do you think my information Endeth here? Produce the letters Which you have received this morning From his grace the Duke of Florence, On the subject of the ancient Claim he makes upon my kingdom. FREDERICK. Humbly I entreat your highness, That at least you will remember Who I am: if I have acted Wrong in giving my assistance To a lover who adores you, Do not think that I am guilty Of a crime, so much unworthy Of my stainless blood and honour. FLERIDA. He who finds one crime when starting, May find many on the journey. Give the letters I have asked for. FREDERICK. Letters! Take, oh! take, SeÃ±ora, All the papers that I carry. Take the keys of all the others In my house; and if in searching You can find the smallest cypher Of disloyalty or treason, Then my life shall be the forfeit. He draws out a handkerchief, a bunch of keys, and a small box, or miniature-case, which last he conceals. FLERIDA. What is that you seem so anxious To conceal? FREDERICK. A box. FLERIDA. Permit me To examine it. FREDERICK. I plainly [Aside. Now can understand her meaning.â As this box cannot, SeÃ±ora, Be the proof of any treason, I implore you to excuse me. LAURA, at the door. Gracious Heavens! it is my portrait. FLERIDA. I insist at once on knowing What this box contains. LAURA, aside. We're ruined! FREDERICK. 'Tis a portrait; and if only This you wish to know, SeÃ±ora, Now you know it. FLERIDA. Till I see it I will not believe: produce it. FREDERICK. If, Senoraâ LAURA. What a trial! FREDERICK. It were thisâ LAURA. What dreadful danger! FREDERICK. That did make meâ LAURA. How I tremble! FREDERICK. Traitor to your grace, LAURA. What terror! FREDERICK. Rightlyâ LAURA. Oh! what bitter anguish! FREDERICK. Would you call me. LAURA. Cruel torture! FREDERICK. But before Iâ LAURA. What confusion! FREDERICK. Would expose itâ LAURA. What misfortune! FREDERICK. I a thousand deaths would suffer! Laura slips from her hiding-place, snatches the portrait from his hands, changes it instantly for the portrait of Frederick, which she herself had, and gives the latter to Flerida. LAURA. Traitor! wilt thou now refuse it? FREDERICK. Laura, how is this? LAURA. 'Tis simply, That I heard your conversationâ Heard her grace demand to see it, And your ungallant refusal. Take it from my hands, SeÃ±ora. FLERIDA. Never in my whole existence Did you do me greater service. FREDERICK, aside. Doubtless, Laura takes this method Of proclaiming our affection. FLERIDA. Bring the candle hither, Laura.â Now at length I'll see this wonder [Aside. That awakes my jealous fears. FREDERICK. When she recognises Laura, What will be her wrath! [Aside. FLERIDA. Oh! heavens! What is this I see? LAURA, to Flerida. No questionâ 'Tis the gentleman's own likeness! FLERIDA. Why so anxious to conceal this? FREDERICK. Do you wonder, when it gives To my eyes the dearest object That the world contains? FLERIDA. Aye, true, Since you love it as yourself; Laura, what is this has happened? [Aside to Laura.] What can be its meaning, say? LAURA. How can I know aught about it More than you have seen? FLERIDA, aside. I can Scarce restrain my rising anger.â She gives the portrait to Laura and retires. Take it, for I must withdraw To avoid an open rupture. Give the picture back to this Self-adoring new Narcissusâ And say to him ......... but 'tis better To say naught:âMy heart is Etnaâ Serpents brood within my bosomâ Basilisks within my soul! [Exit. FREDERICK. Tell me, Laura, how it happens, That her grace, your portrait seeing, Does not seem to be offended, Nor with thee, nor yet with me? LAURA. See, I merely changed the pictures, Giving thine, and keeping mine! FREDERICK. Wit like thine could only draw us From a danger so extreme. LAURA. Yes, but then she still continues Apt and able as before. FREDERICK. Would that we were once in safety. LAURA. I, to-morrow shall advise What 'tis best we should decide on:â Take this picture, and adieu!â Gives him one of the portraits. FREDERICK. Of the two self-seeming portraits Which is this that now you give? LAURA. It is thine, lest she should ask it Back again. [Exit. FREDERICK. Thou'rt right; O Heavens! Never was there equal danger!â Who could e'er have thought ......? Enter FABIO, with two dresses on his arm. FABIO. My lord, Which of these two handsome dresses Am I to put on? FREDERICK. Thou wretch!â Base-born, vile, atrocious villain. FABIO. It is this that now I get?â FREDERICK. Yes, for through thy fault, I see me Almost lost without redress. FABIO. And I too without a dress. FREDERICK. Did you think then, that this portrait Was a lady's, and not mine? FABIO. No, my lord, for I was certain That you loved yourself right well. FREDERICK. As God lives! you die this moment 'Neath my hands! FABIO. O Lord! I'm off. FREDERICK, aside. But this rage is injudicious, Having just escaped so well: It is best not drive things farther:â Fabio! FABIO. Master!â FREDERICK. Come with me, And select what dress doth please you, Since I know that in this matter Thou art true, and not to blame. FABIO, aside. Such caprice was never equalled! Well, by Heaven, if I had any Sense to loseâI'd lose it now. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âFREDERICK'S CHAMBER. Enter FABIO. FABIO. He who found, perchance, the senses Of a miserable valet, Who has lost them for this reason, That his master's wits first went, (Proofâhow valuelessâhow worthless Were they to the natural owner,) Let him come and own the fact:â They will little serve the finder, And the loser may reward:â There is no one here to tell me, Howsoe'er I ask or question: But, the senses once departed, Are they ever found again?â If you have no great objection, Let us, Memory, some moments, You and I soliloquize:â Is there any news?âI know not:â What's the reason, at the time When I seem to stand securest In the favour of my lord, That, with sudden fury striking, He, two thousand blows should give me? Why, the reason isâhe's mad:â And when I more guilty far Fly his presence, with new dresses, And caresses loads me then? Memory, say, what means such conduct? Why, it means that he is drunk:â Two conclusive answers truly To the questions I have put; And a third I cannot wait for, For I see Don Henry comes, Speaking as they say, submissa Voce; and if they desire, Coming to this quiet chamber, To conceal themselves from me, I would wish to save them trouble And conceal myself from them, Partly that I wish to hear them, Partly that, if he at times So agreeable or angryâ Alternating with the wind; When the angry fit approaches, It is just as well to let it Pass away, or waste its fury On the wind from which it sprung. All is lost if I can find not Something quickly here, behind Or beneath which I can hide me: If this open buffet here Is not high enough to let me Underneathâthere is nothing else. Why delay? 'tis not so novel, Since it is not the first time That I have been buffeted. Conceals himself under the buffet. Enter FREDERICK and HENRY. HENRY. Why look round? FREDERICK. Lest some one hear us. HENRY. Do not fear, for all the servants Have gone out of the house. FABIO, aside. Not all: There is one of them remaining. FREDERICK. To this uttermost apartment, Not without a cause I bring thee, Where there is no other witness. FABIO, aside. True! a false one goes for naught. HENRY. Speak! FREDERICK. I first the door shall fasten! And, since now, your highness, we Are at last aloneâthe moment Has arrived to speak out clear:â FABIO, aside. Highness?âgood! HENRY. On what compulsion, For what reason, are you forced Thus to treat me? FREDERICK. There are two: Both of principal importance, One for me, and one for you. And yours is, that I have now (Well I know, that you will pardon Aught that seems in opposition To my friendship, and excuse What necessity imposes) To reveal, and to inform you That your rank and name are known To Flerida, and 'tis useless To affect a secret longer Which is known to all the world,â And mine is ...... HENRY. Before you tell it, Let me know what way Flerida Came my secret to find out. FREDERICK. This is what I cannot fathom, But I know she knows ...... FABIO, aside. Oh! hear him; What a pimp my master is! FREDERICK. For it was herself that told me! HENRY. Let us pass then to the reason Which is thine, for as to mine, I shall venture to continue My disguise until she speaks. FREDERICK. Then in what I have to tell thee, Pledge to me your princely word, Pledge me as thou art, that buried Thou wilt keep it in thy breast. HENRY. Yes, I do so; and I promise That what thou dost stamp in wax, I shall ever hold in marble. FREDERICK. Noble Henry de Gonzagaâ Mantua's proud, illustrious dukeâ You have been informed already I, a beauteous lady love. Well, this prodigy of natureâ Well, this magic gift of Heavenâ This most beautiful of wondersâ This amazement's sweetest causeâ Has to-day, o'er frights and terrors, The impossible effecting, Triumphed over fate itself, And from out the combat gathered Two immortal garlands blent Of her faith and my good fortune; And this letter, which a zephyr Doubtless gave into my hands, Since, in order to have reached them From her elevated heaven To my deep despair's abyssesâ As the warrant of my freedomâ It must have, descending, flown. But I badly so express it, Since it rather is the warrant Of my slavery: for it Doth contain the happy contract Which will make me live for ever An unchanging love's sure slave; Whose close-link'd and fastened fetters, Not the silent file of Time Will be able to dissever. It says then ...... But it will better Be its own clear exposition Of the truth with which she writes, And the faith with which I worship:â Reads. âMy master, my dear lord and love, Fortune doth declare against us Every moment more and more,â Let us intercept her footsteps:â Have then ready about midnight Two fleet horses near the portal Which looks out upon the bridge That divides the park and palace; I will come forth at your signal, And from jealousy escaping, Fly, if it can e'er be fled from:â So farewell,âand may God guard your Precious life a thousand years.â [Resumes. Thus she writes, and so I trust me, Mighty lord, to thy assistance, Since I know my zeal to serve thee May claim so much as a debt: If, to serve your love, in Parma You my humble aid accepted, And if I, to thee confiding, Ask thy service now in turn: It is clear that I recover All the former debt you owe me, And that I repay thee also All the debt that I incur:â Give me, then, my lord, some letters Unto Mantua; and here Use thy powerful intercession In defending me, until I this lady place in safety. HENRY. I so thankful am to Heaven, That it gives me an occasion To repay your friendly service With my services: that I Shall not only grant the favour That you ask, but shall be proud, Happy, and delighted also, To accompany you myself,â Until you have gained the frontier Of my territory, where You shall meet with every honour. FREDERICK. No, my lord, with your permission, I will go alone: much more Can you aid me here in Parma, If you will protect my fame:â Here a safeguard and defender, There your word will be enough. HENRY. I in all things will obey you. FREDERICK. Write the letters, while I go To the palace to dissemble, By my zeal and my attention, What I mean to do this night,â And to find that devil Fabio, Whom I have not seen all day. FABIO, aside. Then you haven't far to seek him. FREDERICK. Though he's not to know the cause, FABIO, aside. Oh! of course. FREDERICK. That he the horses May have ready, as I said. HENRY. You are right, and I remaining Shall endeavour to fulfil What my evil fate may order. FREDERICK. Here I shall return to seek you. HENRY. Writing, shall I wait thee here? FREDERICK. Love! assist me with thy favour. HENRY. Love! take pity on my grief. [Exeunt. FABIO, coming forth. He who listens, seldom heareth Any good, the adage says;â But a proverb sometimes lieth, As I've heard what's very good:â As from listening, I have gained Four important bits of knowledge. FirstâI know the stranger's name; Secondâthe exact condition Of my master's love at last;â Thirdâthe news that I am bursting Now to tell unto Flerida;â And the fourthâsome new reward. Exit. SCENE II. âA HALL IN THE PALACE OF THE DUCHESS. Enter LAURA and ARNESTO. ARNESTO. No, Lisardo's fault, dear Laura, Is not of so grave a kind, That he may no solace find, If he humbly speak his sorrow;â Faults that have the strong defence Of love, can give no very great offenceâ And so, I wish you speak to him more kindly, Since the long-expected dispensation Any hour may reach its destination. LAURA. I will obey thee blindly, Since it is better (O strong power of fate!) To do thy bidding than provoke thy hateâ And so, submissively I say, That I will take the state That is to me presented by my fateâ And bind myself to-day, To set all further doubts at rest, And wed the spouse that doth deserve me best. ARNESTO. I am pleased at thy obedience; Lisardo, you may enter:â Laura, stay. Enter LISARDO. LISARDO. SeÃ±ora, if I venture, It only is to offer my allegiance: And at thy feet my life to layâ The price of that sweet pardon that I pray. LAURA. Lisardo, this permission My father's liberal wish dispensed. To-day my acts are influenced Not by election, but submission, And so, you need not thank me for a handâ Another's hand, and given thee through command. LISARDO. It is enough to make my joy divine To know, SeÃ±ora, that I have thy hand; How or why I need not understand, If it is only mine; The happiest destiny is this That seeks not out, but finds the road to bliss: O slow and sluggish sun, Quicken thy course, or shorten thy career, And bring the happy moment near To which my swift hopes run. Enter FLERIDA. Arnesto! Laura! ARNESTO. To thy chamber speeding, Laura, my lady, was with us proceeding. FLERIDA. Lisardo, I congratulate you truly, That you are pardoned 'spite of Laura's shyness. LISARDO. Such favour makes my dying hope bud newly. ARNESTO. She acts as doth become my child. LAURA. Your highness, How do you find yourself in health to-day? FLERIDA. You know the grief that on my heart doth pray. LAURA. Some aid, some remedy you should procure. FLERIDA. Ah! what are vain attempts at healing, That but increase the anguish of my feeling; My sorrow being an ill that doth augment by cure. But that it never may be said, That solitude or pining struck me dead, Do you my friends invite, Unto a festival I shall prepare To-morrow, all the noble and the fair Of Parma:âthus I may bring forth to light [Aside. The murderous fair that kills this heart of mine. ARNESTO. Thine is my every wish. [Exit. LISARDO. My life is thine. [Exit. FLERIDA. Ah! Laura mine, how blest thou art To be the happy wife of one Who loves thee so. LAURA. Ah! yes indeed, I own The joy, the rapture of my heart, (If truth is to be said) That he who loves me is with me to wed. FLERIDA. Ah! more unhappy far Is she who, with the impossible at strife, Subdued, must yield her life! But no, my evil star Shall find my resolute will Enough to curb her baneful influence still. LAURA. That remedy can fail not in effect; But tell me of the mode to be pursued? FLERIDA. In such a dangerous ill as mine, I should The gentlest means select. LAURA. And what are they? FLERIDA. To own the hopes that thrill me. LAURA. Is that to conquer? FLERIDA. Yes. LAURA, aside. It is to kill me! FLERIDA. To yield to fate Is but to gain a subtler victory; But Laura, shall I be The first, who in the married state Wedded unequally? LAURA, aside. My death is near! FLERIDA. Frederick is a noble cavalier. LAURA. To that indeed you have my full consent. FLERIDA. Since we have touched upon this theme at all, Ah! Laura, let us now recall The singular event Of his portrait which your quickness won; What explanation have you? LAURA. I have none: Because, as I no interest then had In the affair, it vanished from my mind:â Jealousy doth drive me mad! [Aside. FLERIDA. What secret motive could there be behind His earnest wish to keep his picture hid? LAURA. I know not: but to give it as you did, Back to his hands, before the case I viewed MinutelyâI could scarcely so have doneâ If he had other reasons, doubtless one Was that it held his lady's too. FLERIDA. And so I must conclude. O jealous love! that every thought doth scare! LAURA. No doubt it was his lady's face was there. Enter FREDERICK and FABIO. FREDERICK. Must it take an hour to find you? FABIO. With that question I reply,â Since I have been looking after You, the livelong day till nowâ FREDERICK. Hush! the duchess!âbe in waitingâ I shall want you presently. FABIO. Yes: although I do not want you [Aside. Presently nor futurely. FREDERICK, aside. Trembling, fearful of her anger, Do I come before her. FABIO. Why? FREDERICK. Owing to a strange adventure. FABIO. Recollect the little story That I told you, and you'll see With what ease and expedition You will get through all you fear. FREDERICK. How? FABIO. By saying a thanksgiving For MacÃ¡randÃ³n in turn. LAURA, to Flerida. Pause ...... FLERIDA, to her. My pain I must acknowledge Now. LAURA, aside. And I to suffer mine. FLERIDA. Frederick! FREDERICK. Most illustrious lady. FLERIDA. How is it, that through the day You have not appeared, and only Seek the court when night comes on? FREDERICK. Because when I am near thee, lady, Whatever time or hour it be, A noontide glory shines from out thee, And the departing sun appears Endiademed with lovelier splendourâ Encircled with a rosier light;â Because whatever hour we see thee, It doth appear resplendent noon. FLERIDA. What flattering words! FREDERICK. These words, believe me, Are not mere flattery. FLERIDA. What are they? FABIO. Mere MacÃ¡randÃ³nas, lady. FLERIDA, aside to Laura. Do you not perceive, my Laura, That he clearly understands My inclination? LAURA. He does well. FREDERICK. Another good excuse remaineth, Which I can state. FLERIDA. And what is that? FREDERICK. As I judged you were offended With me, I deferred awhile Thus appearing in your presence. FLERIDA. I offended?âfor what cause? FREDERICK. It were foolish to recall it, If you do not recollect. FLERIDA. It is not that I do not know it. FREDERICK. Then how? FLERIDA. I do not wish to know. FREDERICK. By so much is my good fortune Greater, that you thus forget From the best of motivesâpityâ He, this virtue only knows, Who forgets the wrong he suffers. FLERIDA. I am doubtful what you mean. LAURA. If you grant me your permission, I, methinks, can make it plain. FLERIDA. Do so, and in such a manner, That he understand. LAURA. I shall. [Takes out her handkerchief. Iâthat any mind is generous, Amâconvinced of, when its owner, Dyingâhides the fatal anguish Of jealousyâdisdain and love. FREDERICK, aside, taking out his handkerchief. You haveâonly proved the major, Lauraâof your proposition, No groundsâfor the minor giving:â For itâfind some argument. LAURA. Yes, I will:âThat this were certain! [Aside. âThat I had no grounds for it.ââ Thenâif silence is true courage, [Aloud. I will come forthâproving all. FREDERICK. If you come forthâthus victorious I will meet youâwith the wreath. LAURA. This being granted, now I prove it Evenly by opposite: Since the querulous complainer Cannot be called generous: He who stifles his complainings In his breast, must then appear Generous by the very contrast. FREDERICK. Thineâmust be the laurel, Laura; I amâto lay it at thy feet. LAURA. Thineâis the praiseâ'twas thine ideaâ I will beâfound that praise to give.â âThine I am,â he said;âwhat rapture! Aside. FREDERICK, aside. âThine I will be,â she saidâwhat joy! FABIO, aside. 'Gad! I believe they're both Freemasons, And understand each other well. FLERIDA. Then it seems the whole conclusion I can draw from what you say Is, that he who hoards his feelings Is the liberal person. THE TWO. Yes. FLERIDA. Then supposing that I tell thee, Frederick, that I do not know What I know, and you know also, Do not fear to see me then; Come and see me at all moments, Being sure that there is naught That can waken my resentment Or resuscitate your fear. Half is said, and half is silentâ 'Tis sufficient;âLaura, come. [Exit. LAURA. Frederick! FREDERICK. Speak, divinest Laura! LAURA. What is said is said. [Exit. FREDERICK. 'Tis well: Fabio, tell me how it happens, When I thought to meet her frowns, Fair Flerida smiled upon me? FABIO. Think now what it is to find you Passionate and peevish, when I expected all good humour; 'Tis a case in point: but I Can an other reason offer. FREDERICK. Do so. FABIO. That MacÃ¡randÃ³na Of the sun and rosy light Which you told her of. FREDERICK. A truce Now to idle jests; get ready Horses for two persons, quick! FABIO. This appears to me but right:â Now that you have celebrated At MacÃ¡randÃ³n, to go And say mass at AgerÃ©. FREDERICK. Cease! and have the horses waiting Near the path:âFlerida, fairâ [Aside. May your haughty soul forgive meâ Noble lady, pardon, pray;â Since to this, a woman ever Is exposed, who doth avow Love for any man she knoweth Doth another lady love. [Exit. FABIO. To-day, that I have so much news, Must I be compelled to practise More than usual silence? no: For it were a cruel pity Thus to let a secret rot In the bosom, being therefore Of no use to man or beast. For a secret done in secret, As doth sing the CordovÃ¡n, Must have vent, and by confinement Smelleth bad and does no good; Therefore will I seek Flerida. But there is no need of that,â She returns:â Enter FLERIDA. FLERIDA, aside. Although I wholly Trust to Laura, I have left her That I may achieve the conquest Of this cruel love alone: But I see that Frederick is not Here. FABIO. And do you wish to know Why he is not here, SeÃ±ora? FLERIDA. Yes; why so? FABIO. Because he's gone. FLERIDA. Where? FABIO. To AgerÃ©, I fancy. FLERIDA. I don't understand you: FABIO. I Shall not speak MacÃ¡randÃ³na Clearly, if you give me naught. FLERIDA. I desire no information, Since this knowledge only serves But to make us feel more keenly. FABIO. How! not know it? say for what Have I been this blessed morning More than two good hours or three, Like a cat in ambush? FLERIDA. I Only say, that you must leave me. FABIO. Give me nothing: listen gratisâ Only hear. FLERIDA. I have no heed. FABIO. Well I will not burst, a Dios;â Some one I must seek, to whom I can say that my good master Means to give the slip to-night. [Going. FLERIDA. Stay! what's this you say? FABIO. 'Tis nothing; FLERIDA. Stay, and tell me what it means:â FABIO. I don't wish it. FLERIDA. See this diamond: Take and tell. FABIO. Well, why should we Be so very coy about it? If I am a valet, and You a woman, one is dying To be told, and one to tell: My master and his unknown lady Have agreed, to-night ...... FLERIDA. Oh! what? FABIO. To play the truant or the devil. FLERIDA. How? FABIO. By going; but of course Not on foot:âfor he has ordered That I have two horses ready Near the bridge from out the park. FLERIDA. At the bridge, you say? FABIO. The same. FLERIDA. This revives the old suspicion, That his mistress must be one Of my ladies; has he said so? FABIO. No, SeÃ±ora, but his guest, Who is duke of Mantuaâ Gives them shelter in his kingdom.â Glory be to God! I now Can repose from all my labours: Let who pleases now come hither, I have been before him here. [Exit. FLERIDA. Help me, Heaven! What's this I've heard? Who has seen a fate more cruel? Enter ARNESTO. ARNESTO. In thy name have I invited All the noble and the fair 'Mong our cavaliers and ladies For to-morrow. FLERIDA. It is well: And your are, yourself, Arnesto, Truly welcome, for I need All this night your faithful service. ARNESTO. I am ever at your feet; What do you command? FLERIDA. It seemeth Frederick is now involved In a very serious trouble. ARNESTO. And with whom? FLERIDA. I have not heard; Since my only information Is, that love has been the cause; And that the offended party Has to him a paper sent, Saying, that he would await him. Where I know not: you know well How I value him. ARNESTO. And also How he merits being so. FLERIDA. Should I show that I had knowledge Of the meeting, it would only Make the matter public. ARNESTO. Yes: What, then, do you order? FLERIDA. Simply, That you seek him, and without Saying that I sent you to him, Leave him not the whole night through; And when he is bent on going Forth, go forth along with him;â If his proud impatient spirit Should object, arrest him then, Taking with you for that purpose Force enough if there be need,â So that he, until the morning, Be kept safe the whole night through. ARNESTO. I shall go this very moment, And, SeÃ±ora, seek him out;â Not an instant shall I leave him. [Exit. FLERIDA. You shall learn to-day, ungrateful! What a wild extreme of daring Can a jealous woman reach. [Exit SCENE III. âFREDERICK'S CHAMBERâEVENING. Enter HENRY and FREDERICK: a servant places lights upon the table and retires. FREDERICK. Have you yet written? HENRY. Yes; these few Letters, I trust, will make you find A friendly welcomeâwarm and kind, Like that I have received from you: Just payment for a debt so just. FREDERICK. Thou art a sovereign prince, my lord, And firmly to thy royal word, My life, my honour, I entrust: Remain with God: while I prefer, Now that the night descends, to wait Her coming:âto anticipate Rather than, through delaying, err. HENRY. Well have you said; but will you not, At least, allow me for a while To attend you, if 'twere but a mile Or so, until you leave this spot? FREDERICK. Excuse me, if I cannot be So proudly companied: I swear My very shadow now I fear; And if I hide my love from thee, Believe the truth with which I say, I so respect the darling prize, That I would hide her from all eyes, Even mine own, this happy day. HENRY. You wish to go alone: confess. FREDERICK. 'Tis so: adieu. HENRY. Adieu, since I Vainly to change thy purpose, try. A knocking is heard at the door. FREDERICK. Do you not hear a knocking? HENRY. Yes. FREDERICK. Pray, who is there? ARNESTO, entering. 'Tis I. FREDERICK. No doubt, Some business drives you out so late? ARNESTO. Why, no; the distance was not great, And I but came to seek you out. FREDERICK, aside. To seek me?â(How I quake with fear.) My lord, I wait your lordship's will. ARNESTO. They told me that you came home ill, Depressed and low; and being near, I thought it would be most unkind If I unto my bed retired, Before I had, my lord, inquired How you your health this evening find. FREDERICK. May Heaven with all its choicest wealth Your lordship's friendly care reward! But I can tell you now, my lord, I never felt in stronger health: They spread a false report, in sooth, Who told you this. ARNESTO. I much rejoice To find that rumour's lying voice Is wholly unsustained by truth. But how did you contrive to spend The time ere I came in? FREDERICK. In chat, With Henry here, of this and that. ARNESTO. The conversation of a friend, Who is with wit and sense imbued, Who teaches with his voice and looks, Is worth a thousand printed books. FREDERICK. This solemn preface bodes no good. [Aside. HENRY, aside. For Frederick's sake, I much desire To stop the old man's long discourse; To leave them is the proper course: Will you allow me to retire? ARNESTO. Is it because I came you go? FREDERICK. Why, partly yes, and partly no. Yes, for I wished to go, I own, Before your steps did hither wendâ And no, for parting with my friend I do not leave him now alone. [Exit. ARNESTO. Adieu. FREDERICK. I beg you will declare Whate'er you're anxious to confide;â Why do you look on every side? ARNESTO. I'm only looking for a chair. For, being quite unused to walking, I feel fatigued and somewhat heated; I think we may as well be seated As standing, all the time we're talking. They sit down. FREDERICK, aside. Oh, heavens! was ever such assurance! To come at such an hour as this, When I was on the wings of bliss! His coolness is beyond endurance! ARNESTO. How do you make the night pass o'er? FREDERICK. I sometimes at the court attend; Whither I shall be proud to lend My arm, and see you to your door. ARNESTO. 'Tis rather early. FREDERICK, aside. Powers that rule! Must I then lose my life and love? ARNESTO. Do you play piquet? FREDERICK, aside. Heavens above! Was ever anything so cool? No, my good lord. [Aloud. ARNESTO. Being out of tune, Depressed, I left my home to-day, And feeling better, wish to stay, Nor care for going home so soon. FREDERICK. My lord, I feel disturbed, enraged, At being compelled to go: to-night I have, in truth, so much to write, That all my time shall be engaged. He wishes to rise, but Arnesto prevents him. ARNESTO. Let me assist you with your task: A good, fair, flowing hand I bring. FREDERICK. I could not think of such a thing! ARNESTO. Nay, 'tis a favour that I ask! FREDERICK. A very bad return 'twould be For your great kindness and attention: Besides, my lord, I have to mention One reason why I wished to see Your lordship home,âit is that one Of my best friends I'm bound to meet To-night, quite near your lordship's street. ARNESTO. I will attend youâlet's be gone. My power to serve you is not great, But what I can I'll do; I'll wait Outside the door till break of dawn; Or, trust me, Frederick, tell me, is it An assignation you have made? If so, come on; be not afraid That aught shall interrupt your visit. FREDERICK. My lord, your courage well I know, But I must go alone; adieu. He rises from his chair. ARNESTO. With you I go to-night where'er you go. FREDERICK. My lord, what thus compelleth thee? ARNESTO. To find the cause, perhaps 'twere best To ask the trouble of your breast. FREDERICK, aside. What shall I say? ah! woe is me!â No trouble doth my bosom hide. [Aloud. ARNESTO. What it concealethâwell I know:â And so from this thou shalt not go, Unless by me accompanied. FREDERICK, aside. Was e'er bewilderment more rare? ARNESTO. You seemed surprised. FREDERICK. I am, indeed. ARNESTO. Well, let us, Frederick, speak out fair: I know a person waits you now, By whom a message has been sent. FREDERICK, aside. Will cruel fortune ne'er relent? Can fate a sterner aspect show? ARNESTO. To my honour and my fame, Having heard of it, 'twas due To prevent this interview:â When you recollect my nameâ Governor of Parmaâyou Must, upon the moment, see That a certain duty claim My unspotted rank and fame: If I now could part from thee, I would wholly fail, I fear, In the motives that should move An appointed judge, and prove But a worthless cavalier: So, by Heaven! 'tis only due Unto both, for both agree, That you here remain with me, Or that I go hence with you:â Knowing now what 'tis you seekâ What you rashly would commit, Think you that I could permit? FREDERICK, aside. Ah! can words more plainly speak? My lord, your arguments must claim [Aloud. Great weight, no doubt, but do not chafe If I insist that still are safe Your spotless character and name; By me they cannot be made less. ARNESTO. How, if you act as you intend? FREDERICK. First, will you graciously extend Your kind indulgence to me? ARNESTO. Yes. FREDERICK. My birth, my blood, you recollect? ARNESTO. I know thy noble blood has run Pure as the light that leaves the sun. FREDERICK. Trusting to this, I now expect That you will cause the person, who Has written, as you understand, Also to offer me the hand. ARNESTO. That, Frederick, I shall gladly do, Nor from the friendly task desist, Until your hands together meet. FREDERICK. A thousand times I kiss your feet! ARNESTO. So tell me your antagonist, And I shall on the instant, fly ...... FREDERICK, aside. Ah! me, how vainly I believed My bliss was real! ARNESTO. To the aggrieved Expectant party waiting nigh. FREDERICK. And can it possibly be true, You know not yet the person? ARNESTO. No; That you have quarrelled I but know, And that your rival challenged you. FREDERICK. Know you no more than this? ARNESTO. No more. FREDERICK. Then I shall ...... ARNESTO. What? FREDERICK. No more inquire; Since to allow it to transpire Who my opponent is, before You learned it otherwise, would be To act unlike a cavalier; And so my duty is quite clear To keep the engagement without thee. ARNESTO. Think you, my honour knows not how Its duties also to fulfil? FREDERICK. Indeed, I know it well, but still Mine is more pressing: longer now Thus to absent myself, will lay My peace, my honour in the dust. ARNESTO. Well, notwithstanding all, I must Prevent this meeting. FREDERICK. How? ARNESTO. This way: Ho! there. Enter some Soldiers. SOLDIER. My lord? ARNESTO. These doors secure. I give them to thy charge this night: Yield yourself prisoner; nor fight [To Fred. Against your fate. FREDERICK, aside. Alas! how sure Have my misfortunes ever been!â With a less numerous guard, you may Be quite secure!âO Heavens! to-day Naught but dead hopes and joys are seen! ARNESTO. As matters are, I well may be Perfectly safe; but still would I Caution you not to attempt to fly, As death will be the penalty. [Exit with Soldiers; Frederick remains alone. FREDERICK. Ah! how little would appear The threatened vengeance of this man, If no other risk I ranâ If I had not more real fear:â For, O Heavens!âto force my way Out of this prison now, would prove A public scandal to my love;â But any longer here to stay Ignorant how have matters gone With Laura, even that pain exceeds;â I know a secret way that leads From this house to the neighbouring one. Laura, waitâwith panting breath, Love, thy longed-for presence gains, Though thy father threatens chainsâ Though Flerida threatens death! [Exit. SCENE IV. âTHE GARDEN NEAR THE BRIDGEâ NIGHT. LAURA. Oh! thou cold, fatal shadow of the night, The cradle and the sepulchre of light; If all the crimes of love, from age to age, Were written on thy dark and mourning page, Then would as many tales be read on high, As there are sapphire planets in the sky. There, too, perchance, my destiny is drawn, To fade and vanish in the coming dawn. There in thy shining annals may be read The fate of one like me, who thus doth tread Blindly the jealous shadows of despair. But thy impartial pages would declare The cause, and thus to every eye discover A tyrant father, and a hated lover; A jealous mistress too. But oh, dread fear! My love, my life, my lord, my Frederick dear, Why dost thou now delay? why make this wild unrest? Alas! how fear afflicts the expectant breast!â What can have happened to him? Ah! my woes, How soon a fatal reason you supposeâ That he has changed (O pitying Heavens above!) Because Flerida has declared her love:â Were it not better that you should suggest No fault like this could stain so pure a breastâ And that some accident must interfere To hold him back, and keep me waiting here?â But not with ease, the mind its fear resigns, To trust the good and doubt the evil signs:â How does it happen, let me ask, that joy Lives in our hearts less honoured than annoy? It cannot be, when anxious questions rise, That joy alone can answer love with lies; While grief's foreboding ever seemeth true, We know not why they do so, but they do. Enter FLERIDA, without perceiving Laura. FLERIDA. Fabio told me that his master Bade him in the park await him; Which doth clearly prove his mistress Dwelleth somewhere in the palace. Laura went to rest so early, That I had not time to order Her attendance in the garden; And as I could trust none other, I have been compelled to venture Here alone, for fear Arnesto May have failed in what I ordered. Ah! if I may trust the lustre, Shining through the trembling branches, From the azure planets yonder, I can recognise some person. Who is there? LAURA, aside. It is Flerida! Now my subtle wit assist me:â Tell me who is that that's waiting? [Aloud. For her highness has commanded I should learn who is the person That, protected by the darkness, In the precincts of her palace, Treats her with so much dishonour. FLERIDA. Laura, do not speak so loudly. LAURA. Who are you? FLERIDA. I am Flerida. LAURA. You, SeÃ±ora? how does't happen That at such an hour I see you? FLERIDA. Having all the day forgotten To request youâ LAURA, aside. How I tremble! FLERIDA. To come hither, I considered It were best to come myself here. LAURA. Oh! you wrong me, dear SeÃ±ora: Is it not enough to tell me Once the object of your wishes, Without giving me each moment Special orders for my guidance? Furthermore, I had this evening Other reasons for my coming. FLERIDA. What were these? LAURA. Beneath my window, Which upon the park doth open, I could hear the tramp of horses; And the novelty induced me To descend and search the garden. FLERIDA. What you tell me is in keeping With my private information; For your zeal I'm very grateful. Did you in the park discover Anything that seemed peculiar? LAURA. I saw nothing whatsoever Of the person that I looked for. But you can retire, SeÃ±ora, Now that I am here; believe me Nothing shall escape my searching. FLERIDA. Be it so, but you remain here. LAURA. Certainly. [Some one knocks. FLERIDA. What means this knocking? LAURA. Many times the wind deceives one. [Knocking repeated. FLERIDA. This is surely no deception: Open and reply. LAURA. SeÃ±ora? FLERIDA. Open; and to give you courage, I myself shall stand beside you. We shall learn who seeks admission, And the name of her he seeketh, If he should but chance to name her. LAURA. But my voice is too familiar. FLERIDA. You can slightly change your accentâ Come, I say. LAURA, aside. Oh! never, never, Was there such a cruel precept! How shall I support the double Part assigned me in this drama, When the night forbids my using Our ingenious secret cipher? FLERIDA. Why thus tremble? LAURA. Lest they know me When I speak. FLERIDA. What groundless terror! Come, I sayâ LAURA. Who's there? [Opens the window of the trellis. FREDERICK, within. FREDERICK. A wretched, Dying man, divinest Laura! LAURA. Did I not declare, SeÃ±ora, That I would be known the moment That I spokeâyou see't has happened At the first word that I uttered. FLERIDA. Yes, and that is little wonder; I too would have known you, Laura. LAURA. Cavalier, since you do know me, You do also know for certain That I'm not the wished-for lady, Whom your hopes are here expectingâ Go away, and thank your fortune That my much-offended honour Takes no deeper mode of vengeance Than to close the window on you. [Closes the window. FREDERICK. My life, my soul, my dearest Laura, My love, indeed, I am not guiltyâ My tardiness was forced upon meâ Listen, lady, though you kill me, Or I will myself destroy me! LAURA, to Flerida. Why do you compel my speaking? When just now I told youâ FLERIDA. Silence! LAURA. If my father, or Lisardo Could have known. FLERIDA. Speak not so loudly. LAURA, aside. Who e'er felt so strange a torture? FREDERICK. Hear me, though you kill me afterâ Once again, my beauteous Laura. [Flerida opens the window. FLERIDA. What then would you wish to tell me? FREDERICK. That Flerida's jealous anger Sent to me your sire, Arnesto, Who, by force of arms, detained me All the evening in my chamber, So that till this moment, dearest, I could not come here.âWhy linger? In the park our horses tarry. From the duke I carry letters, Which will gain us full protection In his royal court of Mantua. Come with meâwhat, though the morning Glimmers o'er the eastern mountainsâ Once with thee upon the journey, I shall fear no interruption. LAURA, aside. If a word he could have added, He would not have stopped! I perish! FLERIDA. Frederick, it is too near morning Now to think of going with you; It is better you should enter Once again your prison chamber, And, perhaps a kinder fortune May befriend us on to-morrow. FREDERICK. Thou, my life, my soul, for ever Shall I study to obey thee; But thou art not angry with me? FLERIDA. Not with thee, but with my planet! Now adieu! [Closes the grating. FREDERICK. Adieu! [Exit. FLERIDA. So, Laura ...... LAURA. Lady! FLERIDA. Tell me naught, For of nothing do I ask you:â Jealousy will strike me dead! [Aside. LAURA. But consider ...... FLERIDA. Lead the way; Here we can remain no longer. LAURA, aside. How I tremble at her vengeance! FLERIDA. I shall show the world, I am Who I am:ânow let us enter. LAURA, aside. Ah! unhappy:âsince to-day Every hope of mine hath perished! The garden-gate is opened, and ARNESTO, FABIO, and the guard enter. Day begins to dawn. FLERIDA. But who opes the garden-gate At this early hour of morning? LAURA. If the light, which yet doth tremble Doubtfully, doth not deceive, One among them is my father. FLERIDA. Yes, 'tis he; let us remain,â To find out with what intention Thus he comes so early. LAURA, aside. Heaven! Guard my life, my fame, my honour. [They retire. ARNESTO. Fabio, you have now to tell me With what purpose you were waiting With two horses in the park. FABIO. First your lordship will take notice That I never in my lifetime Ever did a thing on purposeâ Being a very different person From a man of purpose. ARNESTO. What Kept you waiting there, I ask you? FABIO. Why, as I would, some time longer, Sit at table with my master, I must do as he commands. ARNESTO. Say, with whom did Frederick quarrel Yesterday? FABIO. It must have been With his lady, since the period Of her meeting him is past. ARNESTO. I will make you tell me truly All you know. Do not imagine That you can escape me. FABIO. So Said a doctor once, when hunting, To a man who came to say, Look! Sir, there a hare is lying In its bed.âYour worship lend Me your arquebuse to shoot her, E'er she rises from her form:â In a loud voice thus he answer'd,â Have no fear that she will rise, Since she's lying in her bed, And the doctor called to see herâ Think you she will e'er get up? ARNESTO. Fabio, I am glad to find you In so light and gay a mood. FABIO. 'Tis my nature. ARNESTO, perceiving the Duchess. Ah! SeÃ±ora, Art thou here? FLERIDA. My griefs have drawn me To the garden: what is this? ARNESTO. Anxious to obey your orders, Frederick, I, this night confined, Since I could by no manÅuvre Keep him quietly at home. Having left him safely guarded In his house, without the danger Of his making his escape ...... FLERIDA. Ay! 'tis evident how strictly He was guarded. ARNESTO. I went seeking Through the park, to meet the man Who was waiting for his coming, And the only one I found, Was his servant, Fabio, standing With two horses; wishing then That the news of his confinement Would not be divulged by him, I desired to bring the fellow To my quarters, through this gate (Since a master-key I carry), And secure him there. FABIO. What crime Is it to be found, your worship, Holding horses? ARNESTO. What must I Do with him and with his servant? FLERIDA. You must here bring Frederick, Since my only motive was To prevent a great misfortune; And as I, or more, or less Know enough of its occasion, I can bear to see him now: And you may set free the servant. FABIO. I a thousand kisses tender To your feet. ARNESTO. I bring him here. [Exit, with guard. LAURA. Lady! what is thy intention? Oh! be kind to my good name!â FLERIDA. Let me, Laura ...... Enter HENRY. HENRY. If a stranger May presume to ask a boon Of your kind consideration,â Frederick's pardon let it be, And his freedom too. FLERIDA. 'Tis nothing That you ask me, since in all things He is free as thought could wish:â But, of this inform me, Henry, Have you had to-day a letter From the duke? HENRY. SeÃ±ora, no. FLERIDA. Then, I have. HENRY, aside. A strange invention! FLERIDA. And in it the duke has written, That your quarrel is arranged, And all difficulties settled;â So that you, to-morrow morning, May from Parma go, since naught Needs your longer stay in Parma. HENRY. Though, SeÃ±ora, from the duke, I, indeed, received no letter, I have had one from a friend, Which doth tell me, not too quickly To go hence, for still my dearest Hopes are all unrealized. FLERIDA. That is what your friend has written, This again is what I sayâ That you go to-morrow morning Forth from Parma; nothing needs Here your stay, and there you're needed. HENRY, aside. What a courteous style, O Heavens! Doth Flerida use in driving Me from all my hope and her! Enter LISARDO. LISARDO. Let me kiss your hand, O sovereign Goddess of this verdant sphere!â Let me kiss the hand of Laura, As the earnest of my joyâ Since the hoped-for dispensation, Which for ages hath my love Long awaited, in these letters Has arrived! FLERIDA, aside. Most opportunely Has it come ...... LAURA, aside. O final sorrow! FLERIDA. Since to-day I have ...... Enter ARNESTO and FREDERICK. ARNESTO. SeÃ±ora, Here is Frederick. FREDERICK. I wait Your commands, your highness. FLERIDA. Give Here a husband's hand to Laura, For I conquer now myself; And the world may know the reason. ARNESTO and LISARDO. What say you? FLERIDA. I am who I am. ARNESTO. But SeÃ±ora, thou forgettest That my honour thou dost wrong? LISARDO. Do you not reflect, SeÃ±ora, That you wrong my fondest love? FLERIDA. This, Lisardo, this, Arnesto, Both of them require. ARNESTO. And thisâ Did my honour need new reasonsâ Why I never could consentâ Were itself even o'er sufficient: Never shall the voice of rumour Dare to whisper, dare to utter, That for any secret reason Did my Laura, Frederick wed. FREDERICK. Be it public, be it secret, Have you aught against me? ARNESTO. No:â 'Tis enough that I dislike it. FREDERICK. It may be enough for grief, Not enough though to offend you:â You besides have made a promise Laura's hand to give me now. ARNESTO. I? FREDERICK. 'Tis true. FLERIDA. And when? FREDERICK. Last evening In my chamber, when you said, That you would induce the person Who had written unto me, And who then was waiting for me, To present me with her hand:â It was Laura that was waiting:â That for thee is quite enough. LISARDO. Yes, for him, but not for me!â For my life shall not be backward To defend its dearest rights. [Puts his hand to his sword. FLERIDA. How's this? FREDERICK. And mine too, to sustain them. ARNESTO. I am at thy side, Lisardo. HENRY, to Frederick. And I at thine. FLERIDA, aside. O bitter pain! But if love has learned to cause it, Honour be the remedy:â Ifâbecause it is my pleasureâ [Aloud. My command is not enough, Let it be enough to tell thee, That at Frederick's side doth stand The duke of Mantua. ARNESTO. Who, SeÃ±ora? HENRY. I, who serving fair Flerida, Was an inmate of his house:â I, who Frederick and Laura Thus am happy to defend. FLERIDA. And I also, that the world May behold my moderation, Even my passion doth exceed. ARNESTO. Since, Lisardo, duke and duchess Thus protect them, thus defend them, Nothing more my honour needeth,â I must favour them likewise. LISARDO. Though the loss to me is mighty, Equal is the consolation, That I see her heart's affections Ever were to Frederick given. HENRY to Flerida. And I, too, thus humbly kneeling At thy feet, implore thee, lady, To reward my love, my pains. FLERIDA. Take my hand: for I am anxious, Once, of who I was, forgetful, Now to think of who I am. LAURA. Heaven my dearest hope fulfilleth! FREDERICK. Now my bliss, completeth heaven! FABIO. Oh! how many times! how often Was I on the point of saying That the mistress of my master Was the lovely lady, Laura: But the Secret now is uttered Out in wordsâas is the title Of our play, whose faults to pardon Humbly at thy feet we pray. END OF THE SECRET IN WORDS.</field>
