      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDY OF PHILOTAS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Prince. To you most hopefull Prince, not as you are, But as you may be, doe I giue these lines: That when your iudgement shall arriue so farre, As t'ouer-looke th'intricate designes Of vncontented man: you may beholde With what encounters greatest fortunes close, What dangers, what attempts, what manifolde Incumbrances ambition vnergoes How hardly men digest felicitie; How to th'intemprate, to the prodigall, To wantonnesse, and vnto luxurie, Many things want, but to ambition all. And you shall finde the greatest enemie That man can haue, is his prosperitie. Here shall you see how men disguise their ends, And plant bad courses vnder plensing shewes, How well presumptions broken wayes defends, Which cleere-eyed Iudgement grauely doth disclose. Here shall you see how th'easie multitude Transported, take the partie of distresse; And onely out of passions doe conclude, Not out of iudgement; of mens practises; How pow'rs are thought to wrong, that wrongs debar, And Kings not held in danger, though they are. These ancient representments of times past Tell vs that men haue, doe, and alwayes runne The selfe same line of action, and doe cast Their course alike, and nothing can be done, Whilst they, their ends, and nature are the same: But will be wrought vpon the selfe same frame. This benefit, most noble prince, doth yeeld The sure records of Bookes, in which we finde The tenure of our State, how it was held By oll our Ancestors, and in what kinde We holde the same, and likewise how in the end This fraile possession of felicitie, Shall to our late posteritie descend By the same Patent of like destinie. In them we find that nothing can accrew To man, and his condition that is new. Which images here figured in this wise I leaue vnto your more mature suruay, Amongst the vowes that others sacrifice Vnto the hope of you, that you one day Will giue grace to this kinde of Harmonie. For know, great Prince, when you shall come to know How that it is the fairest Ornament. Of worthy times, to haue those which may shew The deedes of power, and liuely represent The actions of a glorious Gouernement. And is no lesser honor to a Crowne T'haue Writers then haue Actors of renowne. And though you haue a Swannet of your owne, Within the bankes of Douen meditates Sweet notes to you, and vnto your renowne The glory of his Musicke dedicates, And in a lofty tune is set to sound The deepe reports of sullen Tragedies: Yet may this last of me be likewise found Amongst the vowes that others sacrifice Vnto the hope of you, that you one day May grace this now neglected Harmonie, Which set vnto your glorious actions, may Record the same to all posteritie Though I the remnant of another time Am neuer like to see that happinesse, Yet for the zeale that I haue borne to rime And to the Muses, wish that good successe To others trauell, that in better place, And better comfort, they may be incheerd Who shall deserue, and who shall haue the grace To haue a Muse held worthy to be heard. And know, sweet Prince, when you shall come to know, That tis not in the pow'r of Kings to raise A spirit for Verse that is not borne thereto, Nor are they borne in euery Princes dayes: For late Eliza's raigne gaue birth to more Then all the Kings of England did before. And it may be, the Genius of that time Would leaue to her the glory in that kind, And that the vtmost powers of English Rime Should be within her peacefull raigne confin'd; For since that time our Songs could neuer thriue, But laine as if forlorne; though in the prime Of this new raising season, we did striue To bring the best we could vnto the time. And I although among the latter traine, And least of those that sung vnto this land, Haue borne my part, though in an humble straine, And pleasd the gentler that did vnderstand: And neuer had my harmelesse pen at all Distain'd with any loose immodestie, Nor euer noted to be toucht with gall, To aggrauate the worst mans infamie. But still haue done the fairest offices To vertue and the time, yet naugh preuailes, And all our labours are without successe, For either fauour or our vertue failes. And therefore since I haue out-liu'd the date Of former grace, acceptance and delight, I would my lines late-borne beyond the fate Of her spent line, had neuer come to light So had I not beene tax'd for wishing well, Nor now mistaken by the censuring Stage Nor, in my fame and reputation fell, Which I esteeme more then what all the age Or th'earth can giue. But yeeres hath done this wrong, To make me write too much, and liue too long. And yet I grieue for that vnfinisht frame, Which thou deare Muse didst vow to sacrifice, Vnto the bed of Peace, and in the same Designe our happinesse to memorize, Must, as it is, remaine, though as it is: It shall to after-times relate my zeale To Kings and vnto right, to quietnesse, And to the vnion of the Common-weale. But this may now seeme a superfluous vow, We haue this peace; and thou hast sung enow, And more then will be heard, and then as good As not to write, as not be vnderstood. Sam. Dan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ARGVMENT. Philotas the Sonne of Parmenio, was a man of Plutarch in the life of Alex. great estimation, among the Macedonians, and next vnto Alexander, held to be the most-valiant of the Greekes: patient of trauell, exceeding bountifull, and one that loued his men and friends better then any Noble-man of the Campe: but otherwise, noted of vaine-glory and prodigalitie, insomuch, as his father (hauing notice of his carriage) warned him to make himselfe lesse then he was, to auoide the enuie of the Campe, and the dislike of the King, who grew suspicious of him, in respect of the greatnesse of his father, and his owne popularitie, and by hauing intelligence of certaine vaunts of his, vsed to Antigona a faire Curtizan, borne in the City of Pidna; with whom being in loue, hee let fall many braue words and boasts of a Souldier, to aduance his owne actions and his fathers, terming Alexander at euery word, The yong man. Which speeches Antigona reuealing to a Companion of hers, were at length brought to Craterus, who with the woman, carried them to Alexander; whereby Philotas lay open Q. Curtius lib. 6. to all the aduantages that might worke his ouerthrow: and in the end, concealing a conspiracie (which was reuealed vnto him) intended against the Kng, was thereby suspected to haue beene a party in the plot: but brought before Alexander, he so defended himselfe, that hee obtained his pardon for that time, supped with the King that night, and yet the next day, notwithstanding, was arraigned for the same fact, which hee stoutly denying, was afteward put to torture, and then confest his treason. And indeede, Alexanders drawing a Pedegree from Heauen, with assuming the Persian magnificence, was the cause that withdrew many the hearts of the Nobilitie and people from him, and by the confession of Philotas was that, which gaue a purpose to him and his father to haue subuerted the King as soone as hee had established Asia, and freed them from other feares, which being by Ephestion and Craterus, two the most especiall Councellers of Alexander, grauely and prouidently discerned, was prosecuted in that manner as became their neerenesse and deerenesse with their Lord and Master, and fitting to the safety of the State, in the case of so great an Aspirer; who, no doubt, had he not beene preuented (howsoeuer popularly in the Army it might be otherwise deemed) hee had turned the course of gouernement vpon his father himselfe, or els by his imbroilements made it a monster of many heads, as it afterward proued vpon the death of Alexander. The Chorus consisting of three GrÃ¦cians (as of three estates of a Kingdome) and one Persian, representing the multitude and body of a People, who vulgarly (according to their affections, carried rather with compassion on Great-mens misfortunes, then with the consideration of the cause) frame their imaginations by that square, and censure what is done.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Actvs I. Philotas. Chalisthenes. Philotas reading his fathers Letter. Make thy selfe lesse Philotas then thou art. What meanes my father thus to write to me? Lesse then I am? In what? How can that be? Must I be then set vndernearh my hart? Shall I let goe the hold I haue of grace, Gain'd with so hard aduenture of my blood, And suffer others mount into my place, And from below, looke vp to where I stood? Shall I degrade th'opinion of my worth? By putting off imployment; as vndone In spirit or grace: whilst other men set forth To get that start of action I haue wonne? As if such men as I, had any place, To stay betwixt their ruine and their grace. Can any goe beyond me, but they will Goe ouer me, and trample on my state, And make their fortunes good vpon my ill, Whilst feare hath powre to wound me worse then hate? Chal. Philotas, you deceiue your selfe in this, Your father meanes not you should yeeld in place, But in your popular dependences: Your entertainements, gifts and publike grace, That doth in iealous Kings, distaste the Peeres, And makes you not the greater but in feares. Phi. Alas, what popular dependences Doe I retaine? Can I shake off the zeale Of such as doe out of their kindnesse Follow my fortunes in the Common-weale? Cha. Indeed Philotas therein you say true: They follow doe your fortunes, and not you. Phi. Yea, but I find their loue to me sincere. Cha. Euen such as to the Woolfe the Fox doth beare, That visits him but to partake his pray, And seeing his hopes deceiu'd, turnes to betray. Phi. I know they would, if I in danger stood, Runne vnto me with hazzard of their blood. Cha. Yes, like as men to burning houses run, Not to lend aide, but to be lookers on. Phi. But I with bountie and with gifts haue tide Their hearts so sure, I know they will not slide. Cha. Bountie and gifts lose more then they doe finde, Where many looke for good, few haue their minde; Each thinkes he merits more then that he hath; And so gifts laide for loue, doe catch men wrath. Phi. But many meerely out of loue attend. Cha. Yea, those that loue and haue no other end. Thinke you that men can loue you when they know You haue them not for friendship, but for show? And as you are ingag'd in your affaires, And haue your ends, thinke likewise they haue theirs. Phi. But I doe truly from my heart affect Vertue and worth where I doe find it set: Besides, my foes doe force me in effect To make my party of opinion great, And I must arme me thus against their scornes: Men must be shod that goe amongst the thornes. Cha. Ah, good Philotas, you your selfe beguile, Tis not the way to quench the fire with Oile: The meeke and humble Lambe with small adoo Suckes his owne damme, we see, and others too. In Courts men longest liue, and keepe their rankes, By taking iniuries, and giuing thankes. Phi. And is it so? Then neuer are these haires Like to attaine that sober hew of gray, I cannot plaster and disguise m'affaires In other colours then my heart doth lay. Nor can I patiently endure this fond And strange proceeding of authoritie, That hath ingrost vp all into their hand By idol-liuing feeble Maiestie, And impiously doe labour all they can To make the King forget he is a man, Whilst they diuide the spoyles, and pray for powre, And none at all respect the publike good: Those hands that guard and get vs what is our, The Solderie ingag'd to vent their blood, In worse case seeme then Pallas old-grow'n Moile Th'Athenians fostred at their publike cost, For these poore soules consum'd with tedious toile, Remaine neglected, hauing done their most, And nothing shall bring home of all these warres, But empty age, and bodies charg'd with scarres. Cha. Philotas, all this publike care, I feare, Is but some priuate touch of your dislike, Who seeing your owne designes not stand to square With your desires, no others courses like. The griefe you take things are not ordered well, Is, that you feele your selfe, I feare, not well; But when your fortunes shall stand parabell With those you enuie now, all will be well: For you Great-men, I see, are neuer more, Your end attain'd, the same you were before, You with a finger can point out the staines Of others errours now, and now condem The traine of state, whil'st your desire remaines Without. But once got in, you iumpe with them, And interleague yee with iniquitie, And with a like neglect doe temporize And onely serue your owne commoditie: Your fortune then viewes things with other eyes. For either greatnesse doth transforme the hart In t'other shapes of thoughts, or certainely This vulgar honestie doth dwell apart From pow'r, and is some priuate quality. Or rather those faire parts which we esteeme In such as you, are not the same they seeme: You double with your selues or els with vs. And therefore now, Philotas, euen as good T'imbrace the times, as swell and doe no good. Phi. Alas, Chalisthenes, you haue not laid True leuell to my nature, but are wide From what I am within: all you haue said Shall neuer make me of another side Then that I am, and I doe scorne to clime By shaking hands with this vnworthy time. Cha. The time, Philotas, then will breake thy necke. Phi. They dare not, friend, my father will keepe my necke, My seruice to the State hath causioned So surely for mine honor, as it shall Make good the place my deedes haue purchased, With danger, in the loue and hearts of all. Cha. Those seruices will serue as weights to charge And presse you vnto death, if your foot faile Neuer so little vnderneath your charge, And will be deem'd, done for your owne auaile. And who haue spirits to doe the greatest good, May doe most hurt, if they remaine not good. Phi. Tush, they cannot want my seruice in the State. Cha. These times want not men to supply the State. Phi. I feare not whilst Parmenios forces stand. Cha. Water farre off quenches not fire neere hand. You may be faire dispatcht, ere he can heare, Or if he heard, before he could be here. And therefore doe not build vpon such sand, It will deceiue your hopes when all is done, For though you were the Minion of the Land, If you breake out, be sure you are vndone. When running with the current of the State, Were you the weakest man of men aliue, And in Conuentions and in Counsell sate, And did but sleepe or nod, yet shall you thriue, These motiue spirits are neuer fit to rise, And tis a danger to be held so wise. Phi. What call you running with the State? Shall I Combine with those that doe abuse the State? Whose want of iudgement, wit and honesty, I am asham'd to see, and seeing hate. Cha. Tush, tush, my Lord, thinke not of what were fit: The world is gouern'd more by forme, then wit. He that will fret at Lords, and at the raine, Is but a foole, and grieues himselfe in vaine, Cannot you Great-men suffer others to Haue part in rule, but must haue all to do. Now good my Lord conforme you to the rest, Let not your wings be greater then your nest. Phi. solus. See how these vaine discoursiue Book-men talke, Out of those shadowes of their ayrie powers And doe not see how much they must defalke Of their accounts, to make them gree with ours. They little know to what necessities Our courses stand allied, or how we are Ingag'd in reputation otherwise, To be our selues in our particular. They thinke we can command our harts to lie Out of their place; and still they preach to vs Pack-bearing Patience, that base propertie, And silly gift of th'all enduring Asse. But let them talke their fill, it is but winde, I must sayle by the Compasse of my minde. Enters a Messenger. My Lord, the King call's for you, come my Lord away. Phi. Well, then I know ther's some new stratagem In hand, to be consulted on to day, That I am sent for, with such speede; to him, Whose youth and fortune cannot brooke delay. But her's a suter stands t'impeach my haste: I would I had gone vp the priuie way, Whereby we escape th'attending multitude, Though, I confesse, that in humanity Tis better to denie, then to delude. Enters Cebalinus. My Lord Philotas, I am come with newes Of great importance, that concernes vs all, And well hath my good fortune met with you, Who best can heare, and best discharge my care. Phi. Say what it is, and pray-thee friend be briefe. Ceb. The case requires your patience, good my Lord, And therefore I must craue your eare a while. Phi. I cannot now be long from Alezander. Ceb. Nor Alexander will be long with vs, Vnlesse you heare: and therefore know, the newes I bring, concernes his life; and this it is: There is one Dymnus here within the Campe, Whose low estate, and high affections, Seeme to haue thrust him int'outragious wayes. This man, affecting one Nichomachus, A youth, my brother, whom one day h'allures Int'a Temple, where being both alone, He breakes out in this sort: Nichomacus, Sweet louely youth; ah, should I not impart To thee the deepest secrets of my heart; My heart that hath no locke shut against thee, Would let it out sometimes vnwares of me; But as it issues from my faithfull loue, So close it vp in thine, and keepe it fast. Sweare to be secret, deare Nichomacus, Sweare by the sacred God-head of this place, To keepe my counsell, and I will reueale A matter of the greatest consequence That euer man imparted to his friend. Youth and desire drawne with a loue to knew, Swore to be secret, and to keepe it close. Then Dymnus tels him, That within three dayes There should b'effected a conspiracy On Alexanders person, by his meanes And diuers more of the Nobility, To free their labours, and redeeme them home. Which when Nichomacus my brother heard: Is this your tale? sayth he, O God forbid Mine oath should tie my tongue to keepe in this! This ougly sinne of treason, which to tell Mine oath compels me; faith against my faith Must not be kept. My falshood here is truth, And I must tell. Friend or friend not, I'l tell. Dymnus amaz'd, hearing beyond conceit The selfe-will'd youth vow to reueale their plot. Stands staring on him, drawing backe his breath, Or els his breath confounded with his thoughts Busied with death and horror, could not worke, Not hauing leasure now to thinke what was, But what would be, his feares were runne before, And at misfortune ere she came to him. At length yet, when his reason had reduc'd His flying thoughts backe to some certaine stand, Perceiuing yet some distance was betwixt Death and his feares, which gaue him time to worke, With his returning spirits he drew his sword, Puts it t'his owne then to my brothers throat, Then laies it downe, then wrings his hands, then kneeles, Then stedfast lookes, then takes him in his armes, Weeps on his necke, no word, but, O wilt thou? VVilt thou, be the destruction of vs all? And finding no relenting in the youth, His miseries grew furious, and againe He takes his sword, and sweares to sacrifice To silence and their cause, his dearest bloud. The boy amaz'd, seeing no other way, VVas faine to vow, and promise secrecy; And as if woon t'allow and take that part. Prayes him tell, who were his complices. Which, though perplext with griefe for what was done, Yet thinking now t'haue gain'd him to his side, Dymnus replies: No worse than Loceus, Demetrius of the priuy Chamber, and Nicanor, Amyntas, and Archelopis, Drocenus, Aphebetus, Leuculaus, Shall be th'associats of Nichomacus. This when my brother once had vnderstood, And after much adoe had got away, He comes and tells me all the whole discourse, Which here I haue related vnto you, And here will I attend t'auouch the same, Or bring my brother to confirme as much, Whom now I left behinde, lest the conspirators Seeing him here vnusing to this place, Suspecting t'b'appeach'd, might shift away. Phil. Well fellow, I haue heard thy strange report, And will finde time t'acquaint the King therewith. Scena Secvnda. Antigona , and Thais. VVhat can a free estate affoord me more Than my incaptiu'd fortune doth allow? Was I belou'd, inrich'd, and grac'd before? Am I not lou'd, inrich'd, and graced now? Tha. Yea, but before thou wert a Kings delight. Ant. I might be his, although he was not mine. Tha. His greatnes made thee greater in mens sight. Ant. More great perhaps without, but not within: My loue was then aboue me: I am now Aboue my loue. Darius then had thousands more: Philotas hath but me as I do know, Nor none els will he haue, and so he swore. Tha. Nay, then you may beleeue him, if he swore. Alas, poore soule, she neuer came to know Nor liberty, nor louers periuries. Ant. Stand I not better with a meaner loue, That is alone to me, than with these powres, Who out of all proportion must b'aboue And haue vs theirs, but they will not be ours. And Thais, although thou be a Grecian, And I a Persian, do not enuy me, That I embrace the onely gallant man Persia, or Greece, or all the world can see. Thou, who art entertein'd and grac'd by all The flowre of honour els, do not despise, That vnto me, poore captiue, should befall So great a grace in such a worthies eyes. Tha. Antigona, I enuy not thy loue, But thinke thee blest t'enioy him in that sort. But tell me truly, Didst thou euer proue Whether he lou'd in earnest or in sport? Ant. Thais, let m'a little glory in my grace, Out of the passion of the ioy I feele, And tell the a secret, but in any case, As y'are a woman, do not it reueale. One day, as I was sitting all alone, In comes Philotas from a victory All blood and dust, yet iolly hauing wonne The glory of the day most gallantly: And warm'd with honour of his good successe, Relates to me the dangers he was in: Whereat I wondring, blam'd his forwardnesse. Faith wench, sayes he, thus must we fight, toyle, win, To make that yong-man proud: thus is he borne Vpon the wings of our deserts; our blood Sets him aboue himselfe, and makes him scorne His owne, his country, and the authors of his good. My father was the first that out from Greece Shew'd him the way of Asia, set him on, And by his proiect rais'd the greatest peece Of this proud worke which now he treads vpon. Parmenio without Alexander much hath wrought, Without Parmenio, Alexander hath done nought. But let him vse his fortune whilst he may Times haue their change, we must not still be led. And sweet Antigona thou mayst one day Yet, blesse the houre t'haue knowne Philotas bed; Wherewith he sweetly kist me. And now deeme, If that so great, so wise, so rare a man Would, if he held me not in deare esteeme, Haue vttred this t'a captiue Persian. But Thais I may no longer stay, for feare My Lord returne, and find me not within, Whose eyes yet neuer saw me any where But in his chamber, where I should haue been, And therefore Thais farewell. Tha. Farewell Antigona. Now haue I that, which I desired long, Layd in my lap by this fond woman heere, And meanes t'auenge me of a secret wrong That doth concerne my reputation neere. This gallant man, whom this foole in this wife Vants to be hers, I must confesse t'haue lou'd, And vs'd all th'engins of these conquering eyes, Affections in his hie-built heart t'haue mou'd, Yet neuer could: for what my labour seekes I see is lost vpon vaine ignorance, Whil'st he that is the glory of the Greekes, Virtues vpholder, honours countenance, Out of this garnish of his worthy parts Is fall'n vpon this foolish Persian, To whom his secrets grauely he imparts, Which she as wisely keepe and gouerne can. Tis strange to see the humour of these men, These great aspiring spirits, that should bewise, We women shall know all: for now and then, Out of the humour of their iollities, The smoake of their ambition must haue vent, And out it comes what racks should not reueale: For this her humour hath so much of winde, That it will burst it selfe if too close pent; And none more fit than vs their wisdomes finde, Who will for loue or want of wit conceale. For being the nature of great spirits, to loue To be where they may be most eminent; And rating of themselues so farre aboue Vs in conceit, with whom they do frequent, Imagine how we wonder and esteeme All that they do or say; which makes them striue To make our admiration more extreme: Which they suppose they cannot, lesse they giue Notice of their extreme and highest thoughts: And then the opinion, that we loue them too, Begets a confidence of secrecy; Whereby what euer they intend to doo, We shall be sure to know it presently. But faith, I scorne that such a one as she, A silly wittied wench, should haue this grace To be preferr'd and honor'd before me, Hauing but only beauty, and a face. I that was euer courted by the great And gallant'st Peeres and Princes of the East, Whom Alexander in the greatest state The earth did euer see him, made his guest. There where this tongue obtained for her merit Eternity of Fame: there where these hands Did write in fire the glory of my spirit, And set a trophey that for euer stands. Thais action with the Grecian acts shall be Inregistred alike. Thais, she that fir'd The stateliest palace th'earth did euer see, Darius house that to the clouds aspir'd, She is put backe behinde Antigona. But soone Philotas shall his error see, Who thinkes that beauty best, mens passions fits, For that they vse our bodies, not our wits: And vnto Craterus will I presently, And him acquaint with all this whole discourse, Who, I am sure, will take it well of vs: For these great Minions, who with enuious eie Looke on each others greatnesse, will be glad, In such a case of this importancy, To haue th'aduantage that may here be had. CHORVS. VVe as the Chorus of the vulgar, stand Spectators heere to see these great men play Their parts both of obedience and command, And censure all they do, and all they say. For though we be esteem'd but ignorant, Yet are we capable of truth, and know Where they do well, and where their actions want The grace that makes them proue the best in show, And though we know not what they do within, Where they attire, their mysteries of State: Yet know we by th'euents, what plots haue beene, And how they all without do personate, We see who well a meauer part became, Faile in a greater and disgrace the same. We see some worthy of aduancement deem'd, Saue when they haue it: some againe haue got Good reputation, and beene well esteem'd In place of greatnesse, which before were not. We see affliction act a better scÅne Than prosperous fortune which hath marr'd it cleane. We see that all which we haue praisd in some, Haue only beene their fortune not desart: Some warre haue grac'd, whom peace doth ill become, And lustfull ease hath blemisht all their part. We see Philotas acts his goodnesse ill, And makes his passions to report of him Worse than he is: and we do feare he will Bring his free nature to b'intrapt by them. For sure there is some engin closely laid Against his grace and greatnesse with the King: And that vnlesse his humors proue more staid, We soone shall see his vtter ruining. And his affliction our compassion drawes, Which still lookes on mens fortunes, not the cause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actvs II. Scena I. Alexander, Ephestion, Craterus. Alexander. Ephestion, thou doest Alexander loue, Craterus, thou the King: yet both you meet In on selfe point of loyalty and loue, And both I find like carefull, like discreet, Therefore my faithfull'st Counsellers, to you I must a weighty accident impart, Which lies so heauy, as I tell you true I finde the burthen much t'oppresse my hart. Ingratitude and stubburne carriage, In one of whom my loue deseru'd respect, Is that which moues my passion into rage, And is a thing I ought not to neglect. You see how I Philotas raised haue Aboue his ranke, his Peeres, beyond his terme; You see the place, the offices I gaue, As th'earnest of my loue to binde his firme: But all, he deeming rather his desarts, Than the effects of my grace any way, Beginnes to play most peremtory parts, As fitter to controule than to obay. And I haue beene inform'd, he fosters too The faction of that home-bent cowardize, That would run backe from glory, and vndoo All the whole wonder of our enterprize; And one day to our selfe presumes to write, (Seeming our stile and title to abraid, Which th'oracles themselues held requisite, And which not I, but men on me haue laid) And sayd he pitied those who vnder him should liue, Who held himselfe the sonne of Iupiter. Alas good man, as though what breath could giue Could make mine owne thoughts other than they are! I that am Arbitrer betwixt my heart And their opinion, know how it stands within, And finde that my infirmities take part Of that same frailty other men liue in. And yet, what if I were dispos'd to winke At th'entertain'd opinion spred so farre, And rather was content the world should thinke Vs other than we are, that what we are. In doing which, I know I am not gone Beyond example, seeing that maiesty Needs all the props of admiration That may be got, to beare it vp on hie; And much more mine, which but eu'n now begun By miracles of fortune, and our worth, Needs all the complements to rest vpon That reu'rence and opinion can bring forth, Which this wise man conceiues not, and yet takes Vpon him to instruct vs what to do. But these are but the flourishes he makes Of greater malice he is bent vnto: For sure, me thinkes, I view within his face The map of change and innouation: I see his pride contented with no place, Vnlesse it be the throne I sit vpon. Ephest. Had I not heard this from your sacred tongue, Deare Souereigne, I would neuer haue beleeued Philotas folly would haue done that wrong To his owne worth and th'honours he receiued: And yet me thought, of late, his carriage In such exceeding pompe and gallantry, And such a world of followers, did presage That he affected popularity, Especially, since for his seruice done He was adiudg'd to haue the second place In honour with Antigonus: which wonne To some th'opinion to be high in grace; Then his last action, leading the right wing, And th'ouerthrow he gaue, might hap in large Th'opinion of himselfe, considering Th'especiall grace and honour of his charge, Whereby perhaps in rating his owne worth, His pride might vnder-value that great grace From whence it grew, and that which put him forth, And made his fortune suting to the place. But yet I thinke he is not so vnwise, Although his fortune, youth, and iollity Makes him thus mad, as he will enterprise Ought against course, his faith, and loyalty: And therefore, if your Grace did but withdraw Those beames of fauour, which do daze his wits, He would be soone reduc'd t'his ranke of aw, And know himselfe, and beare him as befits. Alex. Withdraw our grace, and how can that be done, Without some sulliuation to ensue! Can he be safe brought in, being so farre gone? I hold it not. Say Craterus, What thinke you? Cra. Souereigne, I know the man: I finde his spirit; And malice shall not make me (I protest) Speake other than I know his pride doth merit: And what I speake, is for your interest, Which long ere this I would haue vttered, But that I fear'd your Maiesty would take, That from some priuate grudge it rather bred, Than out of care, for your deare sisters sake; Or rather, that I sought to crosse your Grace, Or, to confine your fauour within bounds: And finding him to hold so high a place In that diuine conceit which ours confounds, I thought the safest way to let it rest, In hope, that time some passage open would, To let in those cleere lookes into that brest That doth but malice and confusion hold. And now I see you haue discern'd the man Whom (I protest) I hold most dangerous. And that you ought, with all the speede you can, Worke to represse a spirit so mutinous: For eu'n already he is swoll'n so hie, That his affections ouerflow the brim Of his owne pow'rs, not able to deny Passage vnto the thoughts that gouerne him: For but eu'n now I heard a strange report, Of speeches he should vse t'his Curtizan, Vanting what he had done, and in what sort He labour'd to aduance that proud yong man. (So terming of your sacred Maiesty) With other such extrauagant discourse, Whereof we shall attaine more certeinty (I doubt not) shortly, and discry his course. Meane while, about your person (I aduise) Your Grace should call a more sufficient guard, And on his actions set such wary eyes, As may thereof take speciall good regard; And note what persons chiefly he frequents, And who to him haue the most free accesse, How he bestowes his time, where he presents The large reuenue of his bounteousnesse. And for his wench that lies betwixt his armes, And knowes his heart, I will about with her, She shalbe wrought t'apply her vsuall charmes, And I will make her my discouerer. Alex. This counsell (Craterus) we do well allow, And giue thee many thankes for thy great care: But yet we must beare faire, lest he should know That we suspect what his affections are: For that you see he holds a side of pow'r, Which might perhaps call vp some mutiny. His father, old Parmenio, at this howre Rules MedeÃ¦ with no lesser pow'rs than I; Himselfe, you see, gallantly followed, Holds next to vs a speciall gouernment; CÃ¦nus, that with his sister married, Hath vnder him againe commandement; Amentas and Symanus, his deare friends, With both their honourable offices; And then the priuate traine that on them tends, With all particular dependences, Are motiues to aduise vs how to deale. Crat. Your Grace saies true, but yet these clouds of smoke Vanish before the sun of that respect Whereon mens long-inur'd affections looke With such a natiue zeale, and so affect, As that the vaine and shallow practises Of no such giddy traytour (if the thing Be tooke in time with due aduisednesse) Shall the least shew of any fearing bring. Alex. Well, then to thee (deare Craterus) I refer Th'especiall care of this great businesse. Scena Secvnda. Philotas, Ceballinus, Seruus. Ceballinus. My Lord, I here haue long attendance made, Expecting to be call'd t'auouch my newes. Phi. In troth (my friend) I haue not found the King At any leasure yet to heare the same. Ceb. No, not at leasure to preuent his death! And is the matter of no more import? I'l try another. Yet me thinkes such men As are the eyes and eares of Princes, should Not weigh so light such an intelligence. Ser. My Lord, the summe you willed me to giue The captaine that did visit you to day, To tell you plaine, your coffers yeeld it not. Phi. How if they yeeld it not? Haue I not then Apparell, plate, iewels? Why sell them, Plutarch in the life of Alexander. And go your way, dispatch, and giue it him. Philotas alone. Me thinkes I find the King much chang'd of late, And vnto me his graces not so great: Although they seeme in shew all of one rate, Yet by the touch, I find them counterfet: For when I speake, although I haue his eare, Yet do I see his mind is other where: And when he speakes to me, I see he striues To giue a colour vnto what is not: For he must think, that we, who states, whose liues Depend vpon his Grace, learne not by rote T'obserue his actions, and to know his trym. And though indeed Princes be manifold, Yet haue they still such eyes to wait on them, As are too piercing, that they can behold And penetrate the inwards of the heart, That no deuice can set so close a doore Betwixt their shew and thoughts, but that their art Of shadowing it, makes it appeare the more. But many, malicing my state of grace, I know no worke, with all the power they haue Vpon that easie nature, to displace My fortunes, and my actions to depraue. And though I know they seeke t'inclose him in, And faine would locke him vp and chamber him, Yet will I neuer stoppe, and seeke to win My way by them, that came not in by them; And scorne to stand on any other feet Than these of mine owne worth; and what my plaine And open actions cannot fairely get, Basenesse and smoothing them, shall neuer gaine. And yet, I know, my presence and accesse Cleeres all these mists which they haue rais'd before, Though, with my backe, straight turnes that happinesse, And they againe blow vp as much or more. Thus do we roule the stone of our owne toyle, And men suppose our hell, a heauen the while. Scena III. Craterus, Antigona. Craterus. Antigona, there is no remedy, You needs must iustifie the speech you held With Thais, who will your confrence verifie, And therefore now it can not be conceal'd. Ant. O, my good Lord, I pray you vrge me not: Thais only of a cunning enuious wit, Scorning a stranger should haue such a lot, Hath out of her inuention forged it. Crat. Why then, shall racks and tortures force thee show Both this and other matters which we know? Thinke therefore, if't were not a wiser part T'accept of rest, rewards, preferment, grace, And being perhaps, so beautious as thou art, Of faire election for a neerer place, To tell the truth, than to be obstinate, And fall with the misfortune of a man, Who, in his dangerous and concussed state, No good to thee but ruine render can. Resolue thee of this choice, and let me know Thy minde at full, at my returning backe. Ant. What shall I do, shall I betray my Loue, Or die disgrac'd? What, do I make a doubt! Betray my Loue! O heauenly pow'rs aboue Forbid that such a thought should issue out Of this confused brest: Nay rather first Let tortures, death and horror do their worst. But out alas, this inconsiderate tongue, Without my hearts consent and priuity, Hath done already this vnwilling wrong, And now it is no wisdome to deny. No wisdome to deny! Yes, yes, that tongue That thus hath beene the traytour to my heart, Shall either pow'rfully redeeme that wrong, Or neuer more shall words of breath impart. Yet, what can my deniall profit him, Whom they perhaps, whether I tell or not, Are purpos'd, vpon matters knowne to them, To ruinate on some discouered plot? Let them do what they will. Let not thy heart Seeme to be accessary in a thought, To giue the least aduantage of thy part, To haue a part of shame in what is wrought. O this were well, if that my dangers could Redeeme his perill, and his grace restore; For which, I vow, my life I render would, If this poore life could satisfie therefore. But tis not for thy honour to forsake Thy Loue for death, that lou'd thee in this sort. Alas, what notice will the world take Of such respects in women of my sort! This act may yet put on so faire a coate Vpon my foule profession, as it may Not blush t'appeare with those of cleanest note, And haue as hie a place with fame as they. What do I talke of fame? Do I not see This faction of my flesh, my feares, my youth Already entred; and haue bent at me, The ioyes of life, to batter downe my truth? O my subdued thoughts! what haue you done? To let in feare falshood to my heart. Whom though they haue surpriz'd, they haue not won; For still my loue shall hold the dearest part. Crat. Antigona, What, are you yet resolu'd? Ant. Resolu'd, my Lord, t'endure all misery? Crat. And so be sure you shall, if that b'your choice. Ant. What will you haue me do, my Lord, I am Content to say what you will haue me say. Crat. Then come, go with me to Alexander. CHORVS. How dost thou weare, and weary out thy dayes, Restlesse ambition neuer at an end! Whose trauels no Herculean pillar stayes, But still beyond thy rest thy labours tend, Aboue good fortune thou thy hopes dost raise, Still climing, and yet neuer canst ascend: For when thou hast attaind vnto the top Of thy desires, thou hast not yet got vp. That height of fortune either is controld By some more pow'rfull ouerlooking eye, (That doth the fulnesse of thy grace withhold) Or counter-checkt with some concurrency, That it doth cost farre more ado to hold The height attain'd, than was to get so hie, Where stand thou canst not, but with carefull toile. Nor loose thy hold without thy vtter spoile. There dost thou struggle with thine owne distrust, And others iealousies, their counterplot, Against some vnder-working pride, that must Supplanted be, or els thou standest not, There wrong is playd with wrong, and he that thrust Downe others, comes himselfe to haue that lot. The same concurssion doth afflict his brest That others shooke, oppression is opprest. That etheir happinesse dwells not so hie, Or els aboue, where to pride cannot rise: And that the highst of mans felicity, But in the region of affliction lies: And that we climbe but vp to misery. High fortunes are but high calamities. It is not in that Sphere, where peace doth moue; Rest dwell's below it, happinesse aboue. For in this height of fortune are imbred Those thundring fragors that affright the earth: From thence haue all distemp'ratures their head, That brings forth desolation, famine, dearth: There certaine order is disordered: And there it is confusion hath her birth. It is that height of fortune doth vndoo Both her owne quietnesse and others too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actvs Tertivs. Alexander, Metron, Ceballinus, Craterus, Perdiccas, Ephestion. Alexander. Come, Metron say, of whom hast thou receiued Th'intelligence of this conspiracy, Contriu'd against our person, as thou sayst, By Dymnus and some other of the Campe? Is't not some vaine report borne without cause, That enuy or imagination drawes From priuate ends, to breed a publike feare, T'amuze the world with things that neuer were? Met. Here, may it please your Highnesse is the man, One Ceballinus, that brought me the newes. Ceb. O, Alexander! I haue sau'd thy life; I am the man that haue reueal'd their plot. Alex. And how cam'st thou to be inform'd thereof? Ceb. By mine owne brother, one Nichomacus, Whom Dymnus, chiefe of the conspiratours, Acquainted with the whole of their intents. Alex. How long since is it, this was told to thee? Ceb. About some three dayes, my souereigne Lord. Alex. What, three dayes since! and hast thou so long kept The thing conceal'd from vs, being of that weight? Guard, Take and lay him presently in hold. Ceb. O, may it please your Grace, I did not keep The thing conceal'd one houre, but presently Ran to acquaint Philotas there withall, Supposing him a man, so neere in place, Would best respect a case that toucht so neere; And on him haue I waited these two dayes, Expecting t'haue beene brought vnto your Grace; And seeing him weigh it light, pretending that Your Graces leasure seru'd not fit to heare, I to the Master of your armoury Addrest my selfe forthwith, to Metron here Who, without making any more delay, Prest in vnto your Grace being in your bath, Locking me vp the while in th'armoury: And all what I could shew reuealed hath. Alex. If this be so then, fellow, I confesse, Thy loyall care of vs was more than theirs, Who had more reason theirs should haue bin more. Cause Dymnus to be presently brought forth. And call Philotas streight, who, now I see, Hath not deceiu'd me, in deceiuing me. Who would haue thought one, whom I held so neere, Would from my safety haue beene so farre off, When most it should and ought import his care, And wherein his allegeance might make proofe Of those effects my fauours had deseru'd. And ought t'haue claim'd more duty at his hands Than any of the rest? But thus w'are seru'd, When priuate grace out of proportion stands, And that we call vp men from of below, From th'element of baser property. And set them where they may behold and know The way of might, and worke of maiesty; VVhere see'ng those rayes, which being sent far off, Reflect a heate of wonder and respect, To faile neere hand, and not to shew that proofe, (The obiect only working that effect) Thinke (seeing themselues, though by our fauour, set VVithin the selfe same orbe of rule with vs) Their light would shine alone, if ours were set; And so presume t'obscure or shadow vs. But he shall know, although his neerenesse hath Not felt our heat, that we can burne him too; And grace that shines, can kindle vnto wrath; And Alexander and the King are two. But here they bring vs Dymnus, in whose face I see is guilt, despaire, horror, and death. Guar. Yea, death indeed, for ere he could b'attach'd He stabb'd himselfe so deadly to the heart, As tis impossible that he should liue. Alex. Say Dymnus, what haue I deserud of thee, That thou shouldst thinke worthier to be thy King, Philotas, than our selfe? hold, hold, he sinks; Guard keepe him vp, get him to answer vs. Guar. He hath spoke his last, h'wil neuer answer more. Alex. Sorry I am for that, for now hath death Shut vs cleane out from knowing him within, And lockt vp in his brest all the others hearts, But yet this deed argues the truth in grosse, Though we be barr'd it in particular. Philotas, are you come? Looke here, this man, This Ceballinus should haue suffred death, Could it but haue beene prou'd he had conceal'd Th'intended treason from vs these two dayes; Wherewith (he sayes) he streight acquainted thee. Thinke, the more neere thou art about our selfe, The greater is the shame of thine offence: And which had beene lesse foule in him than thee. Phil. Renowmed Prince, for that my heart is cleere, Amazement cannot ouer cast my face, And I must boldly with th'assured cheere Of my vnguilty conscience tell your Grace, That this offence (thus hapning) was not made By any the least thought of ill in me; And that the keeping of it vnbewrai'd, Was, that I held the rumour vaine to be, Considering some, who were accus'd, were knowne Your ancient and most loyall seruitours, And such, as rather would let out their owne Heart blood, I know, than once indanger yours. And for me then, vpon no certaine note, But on the brabble of two wanton youthes, T'haue tolde an idle tale, that would haue wrought In you distrust, and wrong to others truths, And to no end, but only to haue made My selfe a scorne, and odious vnto all. (For which I rather tooke the bait was layd, Than els for any treachery at all.) I must confesse, I thought the safest way To smoother it a while, to th'end I might, If such a thing could be, some proofes bewray, That might yeeld probability of right; Protesting that mine owne vnspotted thought A like beloefe of others truth did breed, Iudging no impious wretch could haue bin wrought T'imagine such a detestable deed. And therefore, O dread Souereigne, do not way Philotas faith by this his ouersight, But by his actions past, and only lay Error t'his charge, not malice nor despight. Alex. Well, loe, thou hast a fauourable Iudge, When, though thou hast nor pow'r to cleere thy blame, Yet hath he pow'r to pardon thee the same; Which take not as thy right, but as his grace, Since here the person alters not the case. And here, Philotas, I forgiue the offence, And to confirme the same, loe here's my hand. Phi. O sacred hand, the witnesse of my life! By thee I hold my fafety as secure As is my conscience free from treachery, Alex. Well, go t'your charge, and looke to our affaires, For we to morrow purpose to remoue. Exit. Alex. In troth I know not what to iudge herein, Me thinkes that man seemes surely cleere in this, How euer otherwise his hopes haue beene Transported by his vnaduisednesse: It cannot be, a guilty conscience should Put on so sure a brow; or els by art His lookes stand newtrall, seeming not to hold Respondency of int'rest with his heart. Sure, for my part, he hath dissolu'd the knot Of my suspition, with so cleere a hand, As that I thinke in this (what euer plot Of mischiefe it may be) he hath no hand. Crat. My Lord, the greater confidence he shewes, Who is suspected, should be fear'd the more: For danger from weake natures neuer growes; Who must disturbe the world, are built therefore. He more is to be fear'd, that nothing feares, And malice most effects, that least appeares. Presumption of mens pow'rs as well may breed Assurednesse, as innocency may; And mischiefe seldome but by trust doth speed. Who Kings betray, first their beleefe betray. I would your Grace had first conferr'd with vs, Since you would needs such clemency haue show'n, That we might yet haue aduis'd you thus, That he his danger neuer might haue know'n. In faults wherein an after-shame will liue, Tis better a conceale, than to forgiue: For who are brought vnto the blocke of death, Thinke rather on the perill they haue past, Than on the grace which hath preseru'd their breath; And more their suffrings than their mercy tast: He now to plot your danger still may liue, But you his guilt not alwayes to forgiue. Know, that a man so swoll'n with discontent, No grace can cure, nor pardon can restore; He knowes how those who once hath mercy spent, Can neuer hope to haue it any more. But say, that through remorse he calmer proue, Will great Parmenio so attended on With that braue army, fostred in his loue, Be thankfull for this grace you do his sonne? Some benefits are odious, so is this, Where men are still ashamed to confesse To haue so done, as to deserue to die; And euer do desire, that men should gesse They rather had receiu'd an iniury Than life; since life they know in such a case May be restor'd to all, but not to grace. Perd. And for my part, my liege, I hold this minde, That sure, he would not haue so much supprest The notice of a treason in that kinde, Vnlesse he were a party with the rest. Can it be thought that great Parmenios sonne, The generall commander of the horse, The minion of the campe, the only one Of secret counsell, and of free recourse, Should not in three dayes space haue found the King At leasure t'heare three words of that import; Whil'st he himselfe in idle lauishing Did thousands spend t'aduance his owne report? Crat. And if he gaue no credit to the youth, Why did he two dayes space delay him then? As if he had beleeu'd it for a truth, To hinder his addresse to other men. If he had held it but a vaine conceit, I pray why had he not dismist him streight? Men in their priuate dangers may be stout, But in th'occasions and the feares of Kings We ought not to be credulous, but doubt The intimation of the vainest things. Alex. Well, howsoeuer, we will yet this night Disport and banquet in vnusuall wise, That it may seeme, we weigh this practise light, How euer heauy, here, within it lies. Kings may not know distrust, and though they feare, They must not take acquaintance of their feare. Scena II. Antigona , Thais. Oy'are a secret counsell-keeper, Thais: In troth I little thought you such a one. Tha. And why, Antigona, what haue I done? Ant. You know ful-well, your conscience you bewraies. Tha. Alas good soule, would you haue me conceale That, which your selfe could not but needs reueale? Thinke you, another can be more to you, In what concernes them not, than you can be Whom it imports? Will others hold them true, When you proue false to your one secrecy? But yet this is no wonder: for we see Wiser than we do lay their heads to gage For riotous expences of their tongues, Although it be a property belongs Especially to vs, and euery age Can shew strange presidents what we haue been In cases of the greatest plots of men; And t'is the Scene on this worlds stage we play, Whose reuolution we with men conuert, And are to act our part as well as they, Though commonly the weakest, yet a-part. For this great motion of a State we see Doth turne on many wheeles, and some (thogh smal) Do yet the greater moue, who in degree Stirre those who likewise turne the great'st of all. For though we are not wise, we see the wise By vs are made, or make vs parties still In actions of the greatest qualities That they can manage, be they good or ill. Ant. I cannot tell: but you haue made me doo That which must euermore afflict my heart. And if this be my wofull part, t'vndoo My dearest Loue, would I had had no part, How haue I silly woman sifted been, Examin'd, trid, flatt'red, terrifi'd, By Craterus, the cunningest of men, That neuer left me till I had descri'd What euer of Philotas I had know'n! Tha. What, is that all? Perhaps I haue thereby Done the more good than thou canst apprehend. Ant. Such good I rather you should get than I, If that can be a good t'accuse my friend. Tha. Alas, thy accusation did but quote The margin of some text of greater note. Ant. But that is more then thou or I can tell. Tha. Yes, yes, Antigona, I know it well. For be thou sure, that alwayes those who seeke T'attacke the Lyon, so prouide, that still Their toyles be such, as that he shall not scape To turne his rage on those that wrought his ill Philotas neither was so strong nor hie, But malice ouerlookt him, and discride Where he lay weake, where was his vanity; And bui't her countermounts vpon that side, In such sort, as they would be sure to race His fortunes with the engins of disgrace. And now mayst thou, perhaps, come great hereby, And gracious with his greatest enemy: For such men thinke, they haue no full succes, Vnlesse they likewise gaine the mistresses Of those they master, and succeed the place And fortunes of their loues with equall grace. Ant. Loues! Out alas! Loue such a one as he, That seekes t'vndoo my Loue, and in him me? Tha. Tush, loue his fortunes, loue his state, his place, What euer greatnesse doth, it must haue grace. Ant. I weigh not greatnesse, I must please mine eye. Tha. Th'eye nothing fairer sees than dignity. Ant. But what is dignity without our loue? Tha. If we haue that, we cannot want our loue. Ant. Why, that giues but the out-side of delight: The day time ioy, what comfort hath the night? Tha. If pow'r procure not that, what can it do? Ant. I know not how that can b'attain'd vnto. Tha. Nor will I teach thee, if thou know'st it not: Tis vaine, I see, to learne an Asian wit. Exit. Ant. If this be that great wit, that learned skill, You Greeks professe, let me be foolish still, So I be faithfull. And now, being here alone, Let me record the heauy notes of mone. Scena III. Craterus, Ephestion, Clitus, &amp;c. Craterus. My Lords, you see the flexible conceit Of our indangered souereigne: and you know How much his perill, and Philotas pride, Imports the State and vs; and therefore now We either must oppose against deceit, Or be vndone: for now hath time discride An open passage to his farthest ends; From whence, if negligence now put vs backe, Returne we neuer can without our wracke. And, good my Lords, since you conceiue as much, And that we stand alike, make not me prosecute The cause alone, as if it did but touch Only my selfe; and that I did both breed And vrge these doubts out of a priuate griefe. Indeed, I know, I might with much more ease Sit still like others; and if dangers come, Might thinke to shift for one, as well as they: But yet the faith, the duty, and respect We owe both to our souereigne and the State, My Lords, I hold, requires another care. Eph. My Lord, assure you we will take a time To vrge a stricter count of Dymnus death. Crat. My Lords, I say, vnlesse this be the time, You will apply your physicke after death. You see the King inuited hath this night Philotas with the rest, and entertaines Him with as kinde an vsage (to our sight) As euer: and you see the cunning straines Of sweet insinuation, that are vs'd T'assuce the eare of grace with false reports: So that all this will come to be excus'd With one remoue; one action quite transports The Kings affections ouer to his hopes, And sets him so beyond the due regard Of his owne safety, as one enterprize, May serue their turne, and may vs all surprize. Clit. But now, since things thus of themselues breake out, We haue aduantage to preuent the worst, And eu'ry day will yeeld vs more, no doubt; For they are sau'd, that thus are warned first. Crat. So, my Lord Clitus, are they likewise warn'd T'accelerate their plot, being thus bewrai'd. Cli. But that they cannot now, it is too late: For treason taken ere the birth, doth come Abortiue, and her wombe is made her tombe. Crat. You do not know how farre it hath put forth The force of malice, nor how farre is spred Already the contagion of this ill. Clit. Why then there may some one be tortured Of those whom Ceballinus hath reueal'd, Whereby the rest may be discouered. Crat. That one must be Philotas, from whose head All this corruption flowes; take him, take all. Clit. Philotas is not nam'd, and therefore may Perhaps not be acquainted with this plot. Crat. That, his concealing of the plot bewraies: And if we do not cast to find him first, His wit (be sure) hath layd so good a ground, As he will be the last that will be found. Clit. But if he be not found, then is this case We do him more, by iniuring his grace. Crat. If that he be not found t'haue dealt in this, Yet this will force out some such thoughts of his, As will vndoo him: for you seldome see Such men arraign'd, that euer quitted be. Eph. Well, my Lord Craterus, we will moue his Grace (Though it be late) before he take his rest, That some course may be taken in this case: And God ordaine, it may be for the best. Exeunt. CHORVS. Se how these great men cloath their priuate hate In those faire colours of the publike good; And to effect their ends, pretend the State, As if the State by their affections stood: And arm'd with pow'r and Princes iealousies, Will put the least conceit of discontent Into the greatest ranke of treacheries, That no one action shall seeme innocent: Yea, valour, honour, bounty, shall be made As accessaries vnto ends vniust: And euen the seruice of the State must lade The needfull'st vndertakings with distrust. So that base vilenesse, idle luxury Seeme safer farre, than to do worthily. Suspition full of eyes, and full of eares, Doth thorow the tincture of her owne conceit See all things in the colours of her feares, And truth it selfe must looke like to deceit, That what way t'euer the suspected take, Still enuy will most cunningly forelay The ambush of their ruine, or will make Their humors of themselues to take that way. But this is still the fate of those that are By nature or their fortunes eminent, Who either carried in conceit too farre, Do worke their owne or others discontent, Or els are deemed fit to be supprest, Not for they are, but that they may be ill, Since States haue euer had far more vnrest By spirits of worth, then men of meaner skill; And find, that those do alwayes better proue, Wh'are equall to imployment, not aboue. For selfe-opinion would be seene more wise, Than present counsels, customes, orders, lawes: And to the end to haue them otherwise, The Common-wealth into combustion drawes, As if ordaind t'imbroile the world with wit, As well as grosnesse, to dishonour it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actvs IIII. Scena I. Attaras, Sostratus. Sostratus. Can there be such a sudden change in Court As you report? Is it to be beleeu'd, That great Philotas, whom we all beheld In grace last night, should be arraign'd to day? Att. It can be: and it is as I report: For states of grace are no sure holds in Court. Sost. But yet tis strange they should be ouerthrow'n Before their certeine forfeitures were know'n. Att. Tush, it was breeding long though suddenly This thunder-cracke comes but to breake out now. Sost. The time I waited, and I waited long, Vntill Philotas, with some other Lords, Depart the Presence, and as I conceiu'd, I neuer saw the King in better mood, Nor yet Philotas euer in more grace. Can such stormes grow, and yet no clouds appeare? Att. Yea, court stormes grow, when skies there seeme most cleare It was about the deepest of the night, The blackest houre of darknesse and of sleepe, When, with some other Lords, comes Craterus, Falles downe before the King, intreates, implores, Coniures his Grace, as euer he would looke To saue his person and the State from spoile, Now to preuent Philotas practises, Whom they had plainly found to be the man Had plotted the destruction of them all. The King would faine haue put them off to time And farther day, till better proofes were knowne: Which they perceiuing, prest him still the more, And reinforc'd his dangers and their owne; And neuer left him till they had obtain'd Commission t'apprehend Philotas streight. Now, to make feare looke with more hideous face, Or els, but to beget it out of forme, And carefull preparations of distrust, About the Palace men in armour watch, In armour men about the King attend, All passages and issues were forelayd With horse, t'interrupt what euer newes Should hence breake out into Parmenios campe. I, with three hundred men in armour charg'd, Had warrant to attach and to commit The person of Philotas presently: And comming to his lodging where he lay, Found him imburied in the soundest sleepe That euer man could be; where neither noyse Of clattering weapons, or our rushing in With rude and trampling rumour, could dissolue The heauy humours of that drowsie brow, Which held perhaps his sences now more fast, As loth to leaue, because it was the last. Sost. Attaras, what can treason sleepe so sound? Will that lowd hand of Horror that still beats Vpon the guilty conscience of distrust Permit it t'haue so resolute a rest? Att. I cannot tell: but thus we found him there, Nor could we (I assure you) waken him, Till thrice I call'd him by his name, and thrice Had shooke him hard; and then at length he wakes: And looking on me with a setled cheere, Deare friend Attaras, what's the newes? (sayd he) What vp so soone, to hasten the remoue, Or rais'd by some alarme or some distrust? I told him, that the King had some distrust, VVhy, what will Nabarzanes play (sayth he) The villaine with the King, as he hath done Already with his miserable Lord? I seeing he would not or did not vnderstand His owne distresse, told him the charge I had: Wherewith he rose, and rising vs'd these words; O Alexander! now I see my foes Haue got aboue thy goodnesse, and preuail'd Against my innocency and thy word. And as we then inchain'd and fettred him, Looking on that base furniture of shame, Poore body (sayd he) hath so many alarme Rais'd thee to blood and danger from thy rest, T'inuest thee with this armour now at last? Is this the seruice I am call'd to now? But we, that were not to attend his plaints, Couering his head with a disgracefull weed, Tooke and conuai'd him suddenly toward; From whence he shalbe instantly brought forth, Here to b'arraign'd before the King, who sits (According to the Macedonian vse) In cases capitall, himselfe as Iudge. Sost. Well, then I see, who are so high aboue, Are neere to lightning, that are neere to Ioue. Scena Secvnda. Alexander , with all his Councell, the dead body of Dymnus, the Reuealers of the conspiracy, Philotas. The hainous treason of some few had like T'haue rent me from you, worthy souldiers, But by the mercy of th'immortall Gods I liue, and ioy your sight, your reuerend sight, Which makes me more t'abhor those paricides, Not for mine owne respect, but for the wrong You had receiued, if their designe had stood, Since I desire but life to do you good. But how will you be mou'd, when you shall know Who were the men that did attempt this shame! When I shall show that which I grieue to show, And name such, as would God I could not name! But that the foulnesse of their practise now Blots out all memory of what they were: And though I would suppresse them, yet I know This shame of theirs will neuer but appeare. Parmenio is the man, a man (you see) Bound by so many merits both to me And to my father, and our ancient friend, A man of yeeres, experience, grauity, Whose wicked minister Philotas is, Who here Dimetrius, Luculaus, and This Dymnus, whose dead body heere you see, With others, hath suborn'd to slaughter me. And here comes Metron with Nichomacus, To whom this murdred wretch at first reueal'd The proiect of this whole conspiracy, T'auere as much as was disclos'd to him. Nichomacus, Looke heere, aduise thee well, What, dost thou know this man that here lies dead? Nic. My Souereigne Lord, I know him very well: It is one Dymnus, who did three dayes since Bewray to me a treason practised By him and others, to haue slaine your Grace. Alex. Where or by whom, or when did he report, This wicked act should be accomplished? Nic. He sayd, within three daies your Maiesty Should be within your chamber murdered By speciall men of the Nobility; Of whom he many nam'd, and they were these: Loceus, Demetrius, and Archelopis, Nicanor, and Amentas, Luculeus, Droceas, with AphebÃ¦tus, and himselfe. Mat. Thus much his brother Ceballinus did Reueale to me from out this youths report. Ceb. And so much, with the circumstance of all. Did I vnto Philotas intimate. Alex. Then, what hath been his mind, who did suppresse The information of so foule a traine, Your selues, my worthy souldiers, well may gesse, With Dymnus death declares not to be vaine. Poore Ceballinus not a moment stayes To redischarge himselfe of such a weight; Philotas carelesse, fearelesse, nothing weighes, Nor ought reueales. His silence shewes deceit, And tels he was content it should be done: Which, though he were no party, makes him one. For he that knew vpon what pow'r he stood, And saw his fathers greatnesse and his owne, Saw nothing in the way, which now withstood His vast desires, but only this my crowne, Which in respect that I am issulesse, He thinkes the rather casie to b'attain'd. But yet Philotas is deceiu'd in this, I haue who shall inherit all I gain'd. In you I haue both children, kindred, friends; You are the heires of all my purchases, And whil'st you liue I am nost issulesse. And that these are not shadowes of my feares, (For I feare nought but want of enemies) See what this intercepted letter beares, And how Parmenio doth his sonnes aduise. This shewes their ends. Hold, reade it Craterus. Crat. reads it. My sonnes, first haue a speciall care vnto your selues, Then vnto those which do depend on you: So shall you do what you intend to do. Alex. See but how close he writes, that if these lines Should come vnto his sonnes, as they are sent, They might incourage them in their designes; If enterpriz'd, might mocke the ignorant. But now you see what was the thing was meant, You see the fathers care, the sonnes intent. And what if he, as a conspirator, Was not by Dymnus nam'd among the rest? That shewes not his innocency, but his pow'r, Whom they account too great to be supprest, And rather will accuse themselues than him: For that whil'st he shall liue, there's hope for them. And how h'hath borne himselfe in priuate sort, I will not stand to vrge, it's too well knowne; Nor what hath beene his arrogant report, T'imbase my actions, and to brag his owne; Nor how he mockt my letter which I wrote: To shew him of the stile bestow'd on me, By th'Oracle of Ioue. These things I thought But weaknesses, and words of vanity, (Yet words that read the vlcers of his heart) Which I supprest, and neuer ceast to yeeld The chiefe rewards of worth, and still compart The best degrees and honors of the field, In hope to win his loue, yet now at length, There haue I danger where I lookt for strength, I would to God my blood had rather beene Powr'd out, the offring of an enemy, Than practiz'd to be shed by one of mine, That one of mine should haue this infamy. Haue I beene so reseru'd from feares, to fall There where I ought not to haue fear'd at all! Haue you so oft aduis'd me to regard The safety which you saw me running from, When with some hote pursute I pressed hard My foes abroad; to perish thus at home! But now, that safety only rests in you, Which you so oft haue wisht me looke vnto: And now vnto your bosomes must I flye, Without whose will I will not wish to liue: And with your wils I cannot, lesse I giue Due punishment vnto this treachery. Amin. Attaras, bring the hatefull prisoner forth, This traytor, which hath sought t'vndoo vs all, To giue vs vp to slaughter, and to make Our blood a scorne, here in this barbarous land, That none of vs should haue returned backe, Vnto our natiue country, to our wiues, Our aged parents, kindred, and our friends: To make the body of this glorious host A most deformed trunke without a head, Without the life or soule to guide the same, CÃ¦n. O thou base traytor, impious paricide, Who mak'st me loath the blood that matcht with thine; And if I might but haue my will, I vow, Thou should'st not die by other hand than mine. Alex. Fie, CÃ¦nus, what a barbarous course is this: He first must to his accusation plead, And haue his triall,formall to our lawes, And let him make the best of his bad cause. Philotas, here the Macedonians are, To iudge your fact, what language wilt thou vse? Phi. The Persian language, if it please your Grace: For that, beside the Macedonians, here Are many that will better vnderstand, If I shall vse the speech your grace hath vs'd; Which was, I hold, vnto no other end, But that the most men here might vnderstand. Alex. See how his natiue language he disdaines! But let him speake at large, as he desires; So long as you remember he doth hate, Besides the speech, our glory and the State. Exit. Phi, Blacke are the colours layd vpon the crime, Wherewith my faith stands charg'd, my worthy Lords, That as behind in fortune so in time, I come too late to cleere the same with words: My condemnation is gone out before My innocency and my iust defence, And takes vp all your hearts, and leaues no doore For mine excuse to haue an enterauce, That destitute of all compassion, now, Betwixt an vpright conscience of desart And an vniust disgrace, I know not how To satisfie the time, and mine owne heart. Authority lookes with so sterne an eye Vpon this wofull bar, and must haue still Such an aduantage ouer misery, As that it will make good all that it will. He who should onely iudge my cause, is gone; And why he would not stay, I do not see, Since when my cause were heard, his pow'r alone As well might then condemne as set me free. Nor can I by his absence now be clear'd, Whose presence hath condemn'd me thus vnheard. And though the grieuance of a prisoners toong May both superfluous and disgracefull seeme, Which doth not sue, but shewes the Iudge his wrong: Yet pardon me, I must not disesteeme My rightfull cause for being despis'd, nor must Forsake my selfe, though I am left of all. Feare cannot make my innocency vniust Vnto it selfe, to giue my truth the fall. And I had rather (seeing how my fortune drawes) My words should be deformed than my cause. I know that nothing is more delicate Than is the sense and feeling of a State: The clap, the bruit the feare but of a hurt In Kings behalfs, thrusts with that violence The subiects will, to prosecute report, As they condemne ere they discerne th'offence. Eph. Philotas, you deceiue your selfe in this, That thinke to win compassion and beliefe B'impugning iustice, and to make mengesse We do you wrong out of our heat of griefe; Or that our place or passion did lay more On your misfortune, then your owne desert; Or haue not well discern'd your fact before; Or would wihout due proofs your state subuert, These are the vsuall theames of traytors tongues, Who practise mischiefs, and complaine of wrongs, Your treasons are too manifestly knowne, To maske in other liuery then their owne. Crat. Thinke not, that we are set to charge you here With bare suspitions, but with open fact, And with a treason that appeares as cleare As is the sun, and know'n to be your act. Phi. What is this treason? who accuses me? Crat. The processe of the whole conspiracy. Phi. But where's the man that names me to be one? Crat. Here, this dead traytor shewes you to be one. Phi. How can he, dead, accuse me of the same, Whom, liuing, he nor did, nor yet could name? Crat. But we can other testimony show, From those who were your chiefest complices. Phi. I am not to b'adiudg'd in law, you know, By testimony, but by witnesses. Let them be here produc'd vnto my face, Non testimonÃ¿s sunt testibus. That can auouch m'a party in this case. My Lords, and fellow Souldiers, if of those Whom Dymnus nominated, any one Out of his tortures will a word disclose To shew I was a party, I haue done. Thinke not so great a number euer will Endure their torments, and themselues accuse. And leaue me out; since men in such a case, still Will rather slander others than excuse, Calamity malignant is, and he That suffers iustly for his guiltinesse, Eases his owne affliction but to see Others tormented in the same distresse. And yet I feare not whatsoeuer they By rackes and torturres can be forst to say. Had I beene one, would Dymnus haue conceal'd My name, being held to the principall? Would he not for his glory haue reueal'd The best to him, to whom he must tell all? Nay, if he falsly then had nam'd me one, To grace himselfe, must I of force be one? Alas, if Ceballinus had not come to me, And giuen me note of this conspiracy, I had not stood here now, but beene as free From question, as I am treachery: That is the only cloud that thundereth On my disgrace. Which had I deemed true, Or could but haue diuin'd of Dymnus death, Philotas had, my Lords, sat there with you. My fault was, to haue beene too credulous: Wherein I shew'd my weaknesse, I confesse. Crat. Philotas, what a Monarch, and confesse Your imperfections, and your weaknesse? Phi. O Craterus, do not insult vpon calamity, It is a barberous grosnesse, to lay on The weight of scorne, where heauy misery Too much already weighs mens fortunes downe: For if the cause be ill I vndergo, The law, and not reproch, must make it so. CÃ¦n. There's no reproch can euer be too much To lay on traytors, whose deserts are such. Phi. Men vse the most reproches, where they feare The cause will better proue than they desire. CÃ¦n. But sir, a traytors cause that is so cleare As this of yours, will neuer neede that feare. Phi. I am no traytor, but suspected one For not beleeuing a conspiracy: And meere suspect, by law, condemneth none; They are are approued facts for which men die. Crat. The law, in treasons, doth the will correct With like seuerenesse as it doth th'effect: Th'affection is the essence of th'offence; The execution only but the accidence; To haue but will'd it, is to haue done the same. Phi. I did not erre in will, but in beliefe: And if that be a traytor, then am I the chiefe. Crat. Yea, but your will made your beliefe consent To hide the practise till th'accomplishment Phi. Beliefe turnes not by motions of our will, And it was but the euent that made that ill. Some facts men may excuse, though not defend, Where will and fortune haue a diuers end. Th'example of my father made me feare To be too forward to relate things heard, Who writing to the King, wisht him forbeare The portion his Physitian had prepar'd: For that he heard Darius tempted had His faith, with many talents, to be vntrue: And yet his drugs in th'end not prouing bad, Did make my fathers care seeme more than due: For oft, by an vntimely diligence, A busie faith may giue a Prince offence. So that, what shall we do? If we reueale We are despis'd; suspected if conceale. And as for this, where euer now thou be, O Alexander, thou hast pardon'd me: Thou hast already giuen me thy hand, The earnest of thy reconciled heart; And therefore now O let thy goodnesse stand Vnto thy word, and be thou as thou wert. If thou beleeu'dst me, then I am absolu'd; If pardon'd me, my fetters are dissolu'd. What haue I els deseru'd since yester night; When at thy table I such grace did find, What hainous crime hath since beene brought to light, To wrong my faith, and to diuert thy mind? That from a restfull, quiet, most profound Sleeping, in my misfortunes made secure Both by thy hand and by a conscience sound, I must be wak't for giues, for robes impure; For all disgrace that on me wrath could lay, And see the worst of shame, ere I saw day, When I least thought that others cruelty Should haue wrought more than thine owne clemency? Crat. Philotas, whatsoeuer glosse you lay Vpon your rotten cause, it is in vaine; Your pride, your carriage, euer did bewray Your discontent, your malice, and disdaine: You cannot palliat michiefe, but it will Th'row all the fairest couerings of deceit Be alwayes seene. We know those streames of ill Flow'd from that head that fed them with conceit. You foster malecontents, you entertaine All humors, you all factions must embrace; You vaunt your owne exployts, and you disdaine The Kings proceedings, and his stile disgrace; You promise mountaines, and you draw men on With hopes of greater good than hath been seene; You bragg'd of late, that something would be done Whereby your Concubine should be a Queene. And now we see the thing that should be done; But, God be prais'd, we see you first vndone. Phi. Ah, do not make my nature if it had So pliable a sterne of disposition, To turne to euery kindnesse, to be bad, For doing good to men of all condition. Make not your charity to interpret all Is done for fauour, to be done for show, And that we, in our bounties prodigall, Vpon our ends, not on mens needs bestow. Let not my one dayes errour make you tell, That all my life-time I did neuer well; And that because this falles out to be ill, That what I did, did tend vnto this ill. It is vniust to ioyne t'a present fact More of time past, than it hath euer had Before to do withall, as if it lackt Sufficient matter els to make it bad. I do confesse indeed I wrote something Against this title of the sonne of Ioue, And that not of the King, but to the King I freely vs'd these words out of my loue: And thereby hath that dangerous liberty Of speaking truth, with trust on former grace, Betrai'd my meaning vnto enmity, And draw'n an argument of my disgrace: So that I see, though I speake what I ought, It was not in that manner as I ought. And God forbid, that euer souldiers words Should be made liable vnto misdeeds, When fainting in their march, tir'd in the fight, Sicke in their tent, stopping their wounds that bleeds. Or haue and iolly after conquest got, They shall out of their heate vse words vnkinde; Their deeds deserue, to haue them rather thought The passion of the season, than their minde: For souldiers ioy, or wrath, is measurelesse, Rapt with an instant motion: and we blame, We hate, we prayse, we pity in excesse, According as our present passions frame. Sometimes to passe the Ocean we would faine, Sometimes to other worlds, and sometimes slacke And idle, with our conquests, entertaine A sullen humor of returning backe: All which conceits one trumpets sound doth end, And each man running to his ranke, doth lose What in our tents dislikt vs, and we spend All that conceiued wrath vpon our foes. And words, if they proceede of leuity, Are to be scorn'd; of madnesse, pitied; If out of malice or of iniury, To be remiss'd or vnacknowledged: For of themselues, they vanish by disdaine, But if pursude, they will be thought not vaine. Crat. But words, according to the person way, If his designes are haynons, so are they: They are the tinder of sedition still, Where with you kindle fires inflame mens will. Phi. Craterus, you haue th'aduantage of the day, The law is yours, to say what you will say: And yet doth all your glosse but beare the sence Only of my misfortune, not offence. Had I pretended mischiefe to the King, Could not I haue effected it without Dymnus? Did not my free accesse bring Continuall meanes t'haue brought the same about? Was not I, since I heard the thing discride, Alone, and arm'd, in priuate with his Grace? What hindred me, that then I had not tride T'haue done that mischiefe, hauing time and place? Crat. Philotas, euen the Prouidence aboue, Protectresse of the sacred state of Kings, That neuer suffers treachery to haue Good counsell, neuer in this case but brings Confusion to the actors, did vndo Your hearts in what you went about to do. Phi. But yet despaire, we see, doth thrust men on, Se'ing no way els, t'vndo ere be vndon. Crat. That same despaire doth likewise let me fall In that amaze, they can do nought at all. Phi. Well, well, my Lords, my seruice hath made know'n The faith I owe my Souereigne, and the State, Philotas forwardnesse hath euer show'n Vnto all nations, at how high a rate I priz'd my King, and at how low my blood, To do him honour and my country good. Eph. We blame not what y'haue been, but what you are; We accuse not here your valour, but your fact, Not to haue beene a leader in the warre, But an ill subiect in a wicked act; Although we know, thrust rather with the loue Of your owne glory, than with duty lead, You haue done much; yet all your courses proue You tide still your atchieuements to the head Of your owne honour, when it hath beene meet You had them layd downe at your Souereignes feet. God giues to Kings the honour to command, To subiects all their glory to obay, Who ought in time of war as rampiers stand, In peace as th'ornaments of State aray. The King hath recompens'd your seruices With better loue than you shew thankfulnesse. By grace he made you greater than you were By nature he; you receiu'd that which he was not tide To giue to you: his gift was far more deere Than all you did, in making you imployd. But say your seruice hath deseru'd it all, This one offence hath made it odious all: And therefore here in vaine you vse that meane, To plead for life, which you haue cancell'd cleane. Phi. My Lord, you far mistake me, if you deeme I plead for life, that poore weake blast of breath, From which so I ran with light esteeme, And so well haue acquainted me with death: No, no, my Lords, it is not that I feare, It is mine honour that I seeke to cleare; And which, if my disgraced cause would let The language of my heart be vnderstood, Is all which I haue euer sought to get, And which, O leaue me now, and take my blood. Let not your enuy go beyond the bound Of what you seeke: my life stands in your way, That is your ayme, take it; and do not wound My reputation with that wrong, I pray. If I must needs be made the sacrifice Of enuy, and that no oblation will The wrath of Kings, but only blood, suffice, Yet let me haue some thing left that is not ill. Is there no way to get vnto our liues, But first to haue our honour ouerthrowne? Alas, though grace of Kings all greatnesse giues, It cannot giue vs vertue, that's our owne. Though all be theirs our hearts and hands can do, Yet that by which we do is only ours. The trophees that our blood erects vnto Their memory, to glorifie their pow'rs, Let them enioy: yet onely to haue done Worthy of grace, let not that be vndone; Let that high swelling riuer of their fame Leaue humble streames, that feed them yet their name. O my deare father, didst thou bring that spirit, Those hands of vallour, that so much haue done In this great worke of Asia, this to merit, By doing worthily, to be vndone? And hast thou made this purchase of thy sword, To get so great an Empire for thy Lord, And so disgrac'd a graue for thee and thine, T'extinguish by thy seruice all thy line? One of thy sonnes by being too valourous, But fiue dayes since, yet O well, lost his breath; Thy deare Nicanor th'halfe arch of thy house; And here now the other at the barre of death, Stands ouercharg'd with wrath in far worse case, And is to be confounded with disgrace; Thy selfe must giue th'acquitance of thy blood, For others debts, to whom thou hast done good: Which, if they would a little time afford, Death would haue taken it without a sword. Such the rewards of great imployments are, Hate killes in peace, whom Fortune spares in warre. And this is that high grace of Kings we seeke, Whose fauour and whose wrath consumes alike. Eph. Lo here the misery of Kings, whose cause How euer iust it be, how euer strong, Yet in respect they may, their greatnesse drawes The world to thinke they euer do the wrong. But this foule fact of yours, you stand vpon Philotas, shall, beside th'apparency Which all the world sees plaine, ere we haue done, By your owne mouth be made to satisfie The most stiffe partialist that will not see. Phi. My mouth will neuer proue so false (I trust) Vnto my heart, to shew it selfe vniust; And what I here do speake, I know, my Lords, I speake with mine owne mouth, but other where What may be sayd, I say, may be the words Not of my breath, but fame that oft doth erre, Let th'oracle of Ammon be inquir'd About this fact, who, if it shall be true, Will neuer suffer those who haue conspir'd Against Ioues sonne, t'escape without their due: But will reueale the truth: or if this shall Not seeme conuenient, why then lay on all The tortures that may force a tongue to tell The secret'st thought that could imagine ill. Bel. What need we send to know more than we know? That were to giue you time to acquant your friends With your estate, till some combustion grow Within the campe to hasten on your ends, And that the gold and all the treasury Committed to your fathers custody In Medea, now might arme his desp'rat troups To come vpon vs, and to cut our throats. What, shall we aske of Ioue, that which he hath Reueal'd already? But let's send to giue Thanks, that by him the King hath scap't the wrath Of thee, disloyall traytor, and doth liue. Guar. Let's teare the wretch in pieces, let vs rend With our owne hands the traytors paricide. Alex. Peace Belon, silence louing souldiers. You see, my Lords, out of your iudgements graue, That all excuses sickly colours haue, And he that hath thus false and faithlesse beene Must find out other gods and other men Whom to forsweare, and whom he may deceiue; No words of his can make vs more beleeue His impudence: and therefore, seeing tis late, We, till morning, do dismisse the Court.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actvs. V. Chorvs. GrÃ¦cian and Persian. Persian. VVell, then I see there is small difference Betwixt your state and ours, you ciuill Greeks, You great contriuers of free gouernments, Whose skill the world from out all countries seeks, Those whom you call your Kings, are but the same As are our Souereigne tyrants of the East; I see they only differ but in name, The effects they shew, agree, or neere at least. Your great men here, as our great Satrapaes, I see layd prostrate are with basest shame, Vpon the least suspect or iealousies Your Kings conceiue, or others enuies frame; Only herein they differ, That your Prince Proceeds by forme of law t'effect his end; Our Persian Monarch makes his frowne conuince The strongest truth: his sword the processe ends With present death, and makes no more ado: He neuer stands to giue a glosse vnto His violence, to make it to appeare In other hew than that it ought to beare, Wherein plaine dealing best his course commends: For more h'offends who by the law offends. What need hath Alexander so to striue By all these shewes of forme, to find this man Guilty of treason, when he doth contriue To haue him so adiudg'd? Do what he can, He must not be acquit, though he be cleere, Th'offender, not th'offence, is punisht heere. And what auailes the fore-condemn'd to speake? How euer strong his cause, his state is weake. GrÃ¦. Ah, but it satisfies the world, and we Thinke that well done which done by law we see. Per. And yet your law serues but your priuate ends, And to the compasse of your pow'r extends: But is it for the maiesty of Kings, To sit in iudgement thus themselues, with you? GrÃ¦. To do men iustice, is the thing that brings The greatest maiesty on earth to Kings. Per. That, by their subalternate ministers May be perform'd as well, and with more grace: For, to command it to be done, infers More glory, than to do. It doth imbase Th'opinion of a pow'r t'invulgar so That sacred presence, which should neuer go, Neuer be seene, but euen as gods, below, Like to our Persian King in glorious show; And who, as starres affixed to their spheare, May not descend to be from what they are. GrÃ¦. Where Kings are so like gods, there subiects are not men. Per. Your king begins this course, and what will you be then? GrÃ¦. Indeed since prosperous fortune gaue the raine To head strong pow'r and lust, I must confesse, We GrÃ¦cians haue lost deeply by our gaine, And this our greatnesse makes vs much the lesse: For by th'accession of these mighty States, Which Alexander wonderously hath got, He hath forgot himselfe and vs, and rates His state aboue mankind, and ours at nought. This hath thy pompe (O feeble Asia) wrought, Thy base adorings hath transform'd the King Into that shape of pride, as he is brought Out of his wits, out of acknowledging From whence the glory of his greatnesse springs, And that it was our swords that wrought these things, How well were we within the narrow bounds Of our sufficient yeelding Macedon, Before our Kings inlarg'd them with our wounds, And made these sallies of ambition! Before they came to giue the regall law To those free States which kept their crownes in aw! They by these large dominions are made more, But we be come far weaker than before. What get we now by winning, but wide minds And weary bodies, with th'expence of blood? What should ill do, since happy fortune findes But misery, and is not good though good? Action begets still action, and retaines Our hopes beyond our wishes, drawing on A neuer ending circle of orr paines, That makes vs not haue done, when we haue done. What can giue bounds to Alexanders ends, Who counts the world but small, that call's him great; And his desires beyond his pray distends, Like beasts, that murder more than they can eat? When shall we looke his trauels will be done, That tends beyond the Ocean and the Sunne? What discontentments will there still arise In such a Campe of Kings, to inter-shocke Each others greatnesse, and what mutinies Will put him from his comforts, and will mocke His hopes, and neuer suffer him to haue That which he hath of all which Fortune gaue? And from Philotas blood (O worthy man) Whose body now rent on the torture lies, Will flow that vaine of fresh conspiracies, As ouerflow him will, do what he can: For cruelty doth not imbetter men, But them more wary makes than they haue been. Per. Are not your great men free from tortures then, Must they be likewise rackt as other men? GrÃ¦. Treason offoords a priuiledge to none, Who like offends hath punishment all one. Snena II. Polidamas, Sostratus. Polidamas. Friend Sostratus, come, haue you euer know'n Such a distracted face of Court, as now; Such a distrustfull eye, as men are grow'n To feare themselues and all; and do not know Where is the side that shakes not; who lookes best In this foule day, th'oppressor or th'opprest? What posting, what dispatches, what aduice! What search, what running, what discoueries! What rumors, what suggestions, what deuice To cleere the King, please people, hold the wise, Retaine the rude, crush the suspected sort At vnawares, ere they discerne th'are hurt! So much the fall of such a weighty Peere Doth shake the State, and with him tumble downe All whom his beames of fauours did vpbeare, All who to rest vpon his base were knowne: And none, that did but touch vpon his loue, Are free from feare to perish with his loue. My self (whom all the world haue know'n t'imbrace Parmenio in th'intirenesse of my heart, And euer in all battels, euery chace Of danger, fought still next him on that part) Was seazed on this last night, late in my bed, And brought vnto the presence of the King, To pay (I thought) the tribute of my head: But O 'twas for a more abhorred thing! I must redeeme my danger with the blood Of this deare friend, this deare Parmenio's blood; His life must pay for mine, these hands must gore That worthy heart from whom they fought before. Sost. What, hath the King commanded such a deed, To make the hearts of all his subiects bleed? Must that old worthy man Parmenio die? Pol. O Sostratus, he hath his doome to die, And we must yeeld vnto necessity. For comming to the King, and there receiu'd With vnexpected grace, he thus began: Polidamas, we both haue beene deceiu'd, In holding friendship with that faithlesse man Parmenio, who, for all his glozing mine, Thou seest hath sought to cut my throat and thine; And thou must worke reuenge for thee and me: And therefore hast to Media speedily, Take these two letters here, the one from me Vnto my sure and trusty seruants there, The other signed with Philotas seale, As if the same t'his father written were: Carry them both, effect what I haue sayd, The one will giue th'accesse, the other ayd. I tooke the letters, vow'd t'effect the same: And here I go the instrument of shame. Sost. But will you charge your honor with this shame? Pol. I must, or be vndone, with all my name: For I haue left all th'adamantiue ties Of blood and nature, that can hold a heart Chain'd to the word, my brethren and allies, The hostages to caution for my part: And for their liues must I dishonour mine; Els should the King rather haue turn'd this sword Vpon my heart, than forst it impiously, (Hauing done all faire seruice to his Lord, Now to be imploy'd in this foule villany.) Thus must we do who are inthrall'd to Kings, Whether they will iust or vnlawfull things. But now Parmenio; O, me thinkes I see Thee walking in th'artificiall groue Of pleasant Susis, when I come to thee, And thou remembring all our ancient loue, Hastes to imbrace me, saying, O my friend, My deare Polidamas, welcome my friend, Well art thou come, that we may sit and chat Of all the old aduentures we haue run. Tis long Polidamas since we two met, How doth my souereigne Lord, how doth my son? When I vile wretch, whil'st m'answere he attends, With this hand giue the letter, this hand ends His speaking ioy, and stabb's him to the heart. And thus Parmenio thou rewarded art For all thy seruice: thou that didst agree For Alexander to kill Attalus, For Alexander I must now kill thee. Such are the iudgements of the heauenly pow'rs We others ruines worke, and others ours. Cho. P. Why this is right, now Alexander takes The course of pow'r; this is a Persian tricke. This is our way, here publike triall makes No doubtfull noise, but buries clamor quicke. GrÃ¦. Indeed now Persia hath no cause to rue, For you haue vs vndone, who vndid you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NVNCIVS. This worke is done, the sad Catastrophe Of this great act of blood is finisht now, Philotas ended hath the Tragedy. Cho. Now my good friend, I pray thee tell vs how. Nun. As willing to relate, as you to beare: A full-charg'd heart is glad to find an eare. The Councell being dismiss'd from hence, and gone, Still Craterus plies the King, still in his eare, Still whispering to him priuatly alone, Vrging (it seem'd) a quicke dispatch of feare: For they who speake but priuatly to Kings, Do seldome speake the best and fittest things. Some would haue had him forthwith ston'd to death, According to the Macedonian course, But yet that would not satisfie the breath Of busie rumour, but would argue force: There must be some confessions made within. That must abroad more satisfaction win, Craterus, with CÃ¦nus, and Ephestion, Do mainly vrge to haue him tortured; Whereto the King consents, and thereupon They three are sent to see't accomplished. Racks, irons, fires, the grisely torturers And hideously prepar'd before his face. Philotas all vnmou'd, vnchang'd appeares, As if he would deaths ougliest brow out-face, And scorn'd the worst of force, and askt them, Why Then stai'd to torture the Kings enemy? Cho. That part was acted well, God grant we heare No worse a Scene than this, and all goes cleare: So should worth act, and they who dare to fight Against corrupted times, should die vpright; Such hearts Kings may dissolue, but not defeat. A great man where he falles he should lie great, Whose ruine, like the sacred carcases Of scattred Temples which still reuerent lie, And the religious honour them no lesse Than if they stood with all their gallantry. But on with thy report. Nun. Straight were hot irons appli'd to sere his flesh, Then wresting racks his comly body straine. Then iron whips, and then the racke afresh, Then fire againe, and then the whips againe; Which he endures with so resolu'd a looke, As if his mind were of another side Than of his body and his sense forsooke The part of nature, to be wholy tide To honour, that he would not once consent So much as with a sigh t'his punishment. Cho. Yet doth he like himselfe, yet all is well, This argument no tyrant can refell; This plea of resolution winnes his cause More right than all, more admiration drawes: For we loue nothing more, than to renowne Men stoutly miserable, highly downe. Nun. But now? Cho. We feare that But. O, if he ought descend, Leaue here, and let the Tragedy here end. Let not the least act now of his, at last, Marre all his act of life and glory past. Nun. I must tell all, and therefore gine me leaue. Swoll'n with raw tumors, vlcered with the ierks Of iron whips, that flesh from bone had raz'd, And no part free from wounds, it erks His soule to see the house so foule defast, Wherein his life had dwelt so long time cleane, And therefore craues he, they would now dismisse His grieuous tortures, and he would begin To open all wherein h'had done amisse. Streight were his tortures ceast: and after they Had let him to recouer sense, he sayd, Now Craterus, Say what you will haue me say: Wherewith, as if deluded or delaid, Craterus in wrath calles presently againe To haue the tortures to be reapplied. When, whatsoeuer secret of his heart Which had beene fore-conceiu'd but in a thought, What friend soeuer had but tooke his part In common loue h'accus'd; and so forgot Himselfe, that now he was more forward to Confesse, that they to vrge him thereunto, Whether afflictions had his spirits vndone, Or seeing, to hide or vtter, all was one; Both wayes lay death: and therefore he would vie Now to be sure to say enough to die, And then began his fortunes to deplore, Humbly be sought them whom he scorn'd before; That Alexander (where he stood, behind A Trauers, out of sight) was heard to speake: I neuer thought, a man that had a mind T'attempt so much, had had, a heart so weake! There he confest, that one Hegelochus, When first the King proclaim'd himselfe Ioues sonne, In cens'd his fathers heart against him thus, By telling him, That now we were vndone, If we endur'd, that he, which did disdaine To haue beene Philips sonne, should liue and raigne. He that aboue the state of man will straine His stile, and will not be that which we are, Not only vs contemnes, but doth disdaine The gods themselues, with whom he would compare. We haue lost Alexander, lost (said he) The King, and fall'n on pride and vanity; And we haue made a god of our owne blood, That glorifies himselfe, neglects our good. Intolerable is this impious deed To gods, whom he would match, to men he would exceed. Thus hauing ouer night Hegelochus, Discours'd, my father sends next day For me to heare the same: and there to vs All he had sayd to him he made him resay, Supposing, out of wine, the night before, He might but idly raue. When he againe, Far more inrag'd, in heat and passion more, Vrg'd vs to cleere the State of such a staine, Coniur'd vs to redeeme the Common-weale, And do like men, or els as men conceale. Parmenio thought, whil'st yet Darius stood, This course was out of season, and thereby Th'extinguishing of Alexanders blood Would not profit vs, but th'others pow'rs Might make all th'Orient and all Asia ours, That course we lik't, to that our counsell stands, Thereto we tide our oaths and gaue our hands. And as for this, he said, for Dymnus plot, Though he were cleere, yet now he cleer'd him not. And yet the force of racks at last could do So much with him, as he confest that too, And sayd, that fearing Bactra would detaine The King too long, he hast'ned on his ends, Lest that his father, Lord of such a traine And such a wealth, on whom the whole depends, Should, being aged, by his death preuent These his designes, and frustrate his intent. Cho. O would we had not heard his latter iarre: This all his former straines of worth doth marre. Before this last his spirits commends, But now he is vnpitied of his friends. Nun. Then was Demetrius likewise brought in place, And put to torture, who denies the deed. Philotas he auerres it to his face. Demetrius still denies. Then he espide A youth, one Calin, that was standing by, Calin, sayd he how long wilt thou abide Demetrius vainly to auouch a lie? The youth, that neuer had beene nam'd before In all his tortures gaue them cause to gesse Philotas car'd not now to vtter more Than had beene priuy to his practises. And seeing they had as much as they desir'd, They with Demetrius ston'd him vnto death And all whom Dymnus nam'd to haue conspir'd, With grieuous tortures now must lose their breath: And all that were alli'd which could not flie, Are in the hands of iustice now to die. Cho. What, must the punishment arriue beyond Th'offence! not with th'offender make an end! Nun. They all must die who may be fear'd in time To be the heires vnto their kindreds crime. All other punishments end with our breath, But treason is pursu'd beyond our death. Cho. The wrath of Kings doth seldome measure keepe, Seeking to cure bad parts they lance too deepe. When punishment like lightning should appeare To few mens hurt, but vnto all mens feare, Great elephants and lions murder least, Th'ignoble beast is the most cruell beast. But all is well, if by the mighty fall Of this great man, the King be safely freed: But if this Hydra of ambition shall Haue other heads to spring vp in his steed, Then hath he made but way for them to rise, Who will assault him with fresh treacheries. The which may teach vs to obserue this straine, To admire high hill's, but liue within the plaine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Apology. The wrong application, and misconceiuing of this Tragedy of Philotas, vrges me worthy Readers, to answere for mine innocency, both in the choice of the subiect, and the motiues that long since induced me to write it, which were first the delight I tooke in the History it selfe as it lay, and then the aptnesse, I saw it had to fall easily into act, without interlacing other inuention, then it properly yeelded in the owne circumstances, we were sufficient for the worke, and a lawfull representing of a Tragedy. Besides aboue eight yeares since, meeting with my deare friend D. Lateware, (whose memory I reuerence) in his Lords Chamber, and mine, I told him the purpose I had for Philotas, who sayd that himselfe had written the same argument, and caused it to be presented in St. Iohns Colledge in Oxford, where as I after heard, it was worthily and with great applause performed. And though, I sayd, he had therein preuented me, yet I would not desist, whensoeuer my Fortunes would giue me peace, to try what I could doe in the same subiect, where vnto both hee, and who were present, incouraged me as to an example worthy of note. And liuing in the Country, about foure yeares since, and neere halfe a yeare before the late Tragedy of ours, (whereunto this is now most ignorantly resembled) vnfortunately fell out heere in England, I began the same, and wrote three Acts thereof, as many to whom I then shewed it can witnesse, purposing to haue had it presented in Bath by certaine Gentlemens sonnes, as a priuate recreation for the Christmas, before the Shrouetide of that vnhappy disorder. But by reason of some occasion then falling out, and being called vpon by my Printer for a new impression of my workes, with some additions to the ciuill Warres, I intermitted this other subiect. Which now lying by mee, and driuen by necessity to make vse of my pen, and the Stage to bee the mouth of my lines, which before were neuer heared to speake but in silence, I thought the representing so true a History, in the ancient forme of a Tragedy, could not but haue had an vnreproueable passage with the time, and the better sort of men, seeing with what idle fictions, and grosse follies, the Stage at this day abused mens recreations. And withall taking a subiect that lay (as I thought, so farre from the time, and so remote a stranger from the climate of our present courses, I could not imagine that Enuy or ignorance could possibly haue made it, to take any particular acquaintance with vs, but as it hath a generall alliance to the frailty of greatnesse, and the vsuall workings of ambition, the perpetuall subiects of bookes and Tragedies. And for Philotas, it is plaine, that his fathers greatnesse opened first the way to Alexanders suspition and the enuy of the Nobility, and then his owne vanting with dispising the new title conferred by the Oracle of Ammon. Vpon the King, begat and notion of his dislike of the State; and indeede Alexanders drawing a pedegree from Heauen, with assuming the Persian magnificence, was the cause that withdrew many, the hearts of the Nobility and people from him; and by Philotas owne confession, was that which gaue a purpose to him and his father to haue subuerted the King, when he had established Asia, and freed them from other feares. And this concealing of the treason reuealed vnto him, howsoeuer he excused it, shewed how much his heart was alienated from his allegiancy. Which being by Ephestion, and Craterus, two the most graue and worthy Councellors of Alexander prouidently discerned, was prosecuted in that manner, as became their neerenesse, and deerenesse with their Lord and Maister, and fitting the safety of the State, in the case of so great an aspirer: Who, had he not beene preuented (howsoeuer popularly in the Army it might be otherwise deemed) he had no doubt turned the course of the gouernment vpon his father or himselfe, or else imbroyling it, made it monstrous body with many heads, as it afterwards proued vpon the death of Alexander. For though the affection of the multitude (whom he did mignion) and who, as I sayd, lookes still vpon mens fortunes not the cause, discerned not his ends, nor peraduenture himselfe, that knew not how large they might be, nor how much his heart would hold, nor of what capacity would be his ambition, if occasion were offered: Yet some more cleere-sighted, as if raysed by a diuine prouidence to put off that State, till the full period of dissolution, (which after followed was come) saw well, to how hie a staine he had set his hopes by his affected carriage. And Craterus, who so wisely pursued this businesse is deemed to haue beene one of the most honest men that euer followed Alexander in all his actions, and one that was true vnto him euen after his death. And for any resemblance, that thorough the ignorance of the History may be applied to the late Earle of Essex. It can hold in no proportion but only in his weaknesses, which I would wish all that loue his memory not to reuiue. And for mine owne parts hauing beene perticularly beholding to his bounty, I would to God his errors and disobedience to his Souereigne, might by so deepe buried vnderneath the earth, and in so low a tombe from his other parts, that hee might neuer be remembred among the examples of disloyalty in this Kingdome, or paraleld with Forreine Conspirators.
