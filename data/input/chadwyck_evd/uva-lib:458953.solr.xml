      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus Scæna Prima. Enter Mountferrat. Mount. Dares she despise me thus? me that with spoile And hazardous exploits, full sixteene yeeres Have led (as hand-maides) Fortune, Victory Whom the Maltezi call my servitors? Tempests I have subdude, and fought 'em calme, Out-lightened lightning in my Chilvalry; Rid (tame as patience) billowes that kick'd heaven, Whistl'd enraged Boreas till his gusts Were growne so gentle, that he seem'd to sigh, Because he could not show the ayr my keele, And yet I cannot conquer her bright eyes, Which though they blaze both comfort, and invite Neither by force, nor fraud passe through her eare (Whose guard is onely blushing Innocence) To take the least possession of her heart, Did I attempt her with a thred-bare name-unnapt with meritorious actions, She might with colour dis-allow my suit: But by the honour of this Christian crosse (In blood of Infidels so often dyde) Which mine own soul and sword hath fixed here And neither favour, nor births priviledge Oriana shall confesse, although she be Valettas Sister our Grand-Master, here The wages of scorn'd Love is banefull hate, Enter Rocca. And if I rule not her, i'le rule her fate. Rocca, my trusty Servant, welcome. Rocca. Sir, I wish my newes deserv'd it: haplesse I That being lov'd, and trusted, faile to bring The loving answer that you doe expect. Mount. Why speak'st thou from me: thy pleas'd eyes send forth Beames brighter then the star that ushers day, Thy smiles, restore sick expectation. Roc. I bring you Sir, her smiles, not mine. Mount. Her smiles? Why they are presents for Kings eldest Sonnes, Great Solyman that wearies his hot eyes, But to peruse his deck'd Ceraglio, When from the number of his Concubines He chooseth one for that night, in his pride Of them, wives, wealth, is not so rich as I In this one smile, from Oriana sent. Roc. Sir, fare ye well. Mount. Oh Rocca! thou art wise, And would'st not have the torrent of my joy Ruin me headlong; aptly thou conceiv'st If one reviving smile can raise me thus, What trances will the sweet words which thou bring'st Cast me into? I felt (my dearest friend, No more my Servant) when I employ'd thee That knew'st to look, and speak as Lovers should, And carry faithfully thy Masters sighes, That it must worke some heat in her cold heart, And all my labours now come fraughted home With ten fold prize. Roc. Will you yet heare me? Mount. Yes, But take heed (gentle Rocca,) that thou do'st Tenderly by degrees assault mine eares With her consent, now to embrace my love, For thou well know'st I have been so plundg'd, so torne With her resolv'd reject, and neglect: That to report her soft acceptance now, Will stupifie sence in me, if not kill: Why shew'st thou this distemper? Roc. Draw your sword, And when I with my breath have blasted you, Kill me with it: I bring you smiles of pitty, not affection: For such she sent. Mount. Oh! can she pitty me? Of all the pathes lead to a womans love, Pittie's the streightest. Roc. Waken Sir, and know That her contempt (if you can name it so) Continues still: she bids you throw your Pearle Into strong streames, and hope to turn them so, Ere her to foule dishonour; write your plaints In rocks of Corall grow'n above the Sea, Them hope to soften to compassion, Or change their modest blush to love-sick pale, Ere worke her to your impious requests; All your loose thoughts she chides you home againe, But with such calme behaviour, and milde lookes, She gentlier denies then others grant, For just as others love, so doth she hate: She sayes, that by your order you are bound From marrying ever, and much marvels then You would thus violate her and your own faith, That being the virgin you should now protect, Hitherto she professes she has conceal'd Your lustfull Batteries, but the next she vowes, (In open Hall, before the honour'd crosse And her great brother) she will quite disclose Calling for justice, to your utter shame. Mount. Hence find the Blackamore that waits upon her, Bring her unto me, she doth love me yet, And I must her now, at least seeme to do: Cupid, thy brands that glow thus in my veines, I will with blood extinguish-ar't not gone? Shall my desires, like beggars, waite at dore Whil'st any others revell in her breast? Sweat on my spirits: know thou trickt up toy, My love's a violent flood, where thou art falne, Enter Astorius and Castriot. Playing with which tide thou'dst bin gently toss'd, But crossing it, thou art o're whelm'd, and lost. Cast. Mounsieur, good day. Ast. Good morrow valiant Knight, What, are you for this great solemnity This morne intended? Mount. What solemnity? Ast. The investing of the Martiall Spaniard, Peter Gomera, with our Christian Badge. Cast. And young Miranda, the Italian, Both which with wondrous prowesse, and great luck Have dar'd and done for Malta, such high feats, That not one Fort in it, but rings their names As loud as any mans. Mount. As any mans? Why, we have fought for Malta. Ast. Yes Mountferrat. No bold Knight ever past you: but we weare The dignity of Christians on our breasts, And have a long time triumph'd for our conquests; These conquer'd a long time, not triumph'd yet; Mount. Astorius, you are a most indulgent Knight, Detracting from your selfe, to adde to others, You know this title is the period To all our labours, the extremity Of that tall pyramid, where honour hangs, Which we with sweat and agony have reach'd, And should not then so easily impart So bright a wreath to every cheap desert. Cast. How is this French man chang'd Astorius? Some sullen discontent possesses him, That makes him envy, what he heretofore Did most ingenuously but emulate. Mount. Oh furious denre, how like a whirle-wind Thou hurriest me beyond mine honours point? Out of my heart, base lust, or heart, I vow Those flames that heat thee thus, I'le burne thee in. Ast. Do ye observe him? Mount. What newes of the Dane, That valiant Captain Norandine? Cast. He fights still, In view oth' Town; he playes the devill with 'em, And they the Turkes with him. Mount. They'r well met then, twere sin to sever'em. Pish—woman.—Memorie— Would one of ye would leave me: Ast. Six fresh Gallies I in St. Angelo from the promontory This morne discride, making a Girdle for him, But our great Master doth intend reliefe This present meeting: will you walke along? Mount. Hunch—I have read Ladyes enjoy'd, have by The gulphes of worthiest men, buried their names, Their former valour, bountie, beauty, vertue, And sent'em stinking to untimely graves. I that cannot enjoy, by her disdaine, Am like to prove as wretched; woman then Checking or granting, is the grave of men. Ast. He's saying of his Prayers sure. Cast. Will you goe Sir? Mount. I cry you mercy: I am so transported (Your pardon, noble Brothers) with a busines That doth concerne all Malta, that I am (Anon you'll heare't) almost blind, and deafe. Lust neither sees nor heares ought but it selfe: But I will follow instantly: your crosse. Ast. Not mine. Cast. Nor mine: 'tis yours. Ast., Cast. Good morrow brother. Exeunt. Mount. White innocent signe, that do'st abhorre to dwell So neer the dim thoughts of this troubled breast, And grace these gracelesse projects of my heart. Enter Zanthia alias Abdella. with 2 Letters. Yet I must weare thee to protect my crimes, If not for conscience, for hypocrisie, Some Churchmen so wear Cassoks: Oh my Zan. My Pearle, that scornes a staine! I much repent All my neglects: Let me Ixion like, Embrace my black cloud, since my Iuno is So wrathfull, and averse; thou art more soft And full of dalliance then the fairest flesh, And farre more loving. Zan. I, you say so now, But like a property, when I have serv'd Your turnes, You'll, cast me off, or hang me up For a signe, somewhere. Mount. May my life then forsake me Of my expected blisse, be cast to hell. Zan. My tongue Sir, cannot lispe to meet you so, Nor my black Cheeke put on a feigned blush, To make me seeme more modest then I am. This ground-worke, will not beare adulterate red, Nor artificiall white, to cozen love. These dark locks, are not purchas'd, nor these teeth, For every night, they are my bed-fellows; No bath, no blanching water, smoothing oyles, Doth mend me up; and yet Mountferrat, know, I am as full of pleasure in the touch As ere a white fac'd puppet of 'em all, Juicy, and firme; unfledge 'em of their tyres, Their wyres, their partlets, pins, and perriwigs, And they appeare like bald cootes, in the nest; I can as blithly work in my loves bed, And deck thy faire neck, with these Jetty chains, Sing thee asleep, being wearied, and refresh'd, With the same organ, steale sleep off againe. Mount. Oh my black swan, silkner then Signets plush, Sweeter then is the sweet of Pomander, Breath'd like curl'd Zephyrus, cooling Lymon-trees, Straight as young pines, or Cedars in the grove, Quickly discend lovers best Canopie, Still night, for Zanthia doth enamour me Beyond all continuance; perpetrate (deere wench) What thou hast promis'd, and I vow by heaven Malta, I'le leave in it, my honours here, And in some other Country (Zanthia) make My wife, and my best fortune. Zan. From this hope, Here is an answer to that Letter, which I lately shew'd you sent from Tripoly, By the great Basha, which importunes her Love unto him, and treachery to the Island, Which will she undertake, by Mahomet The Turke there vowes, on his blest Alcharon, Marriage unto her: this the Master knowes, But is resolv'd of her integrity (As well he may) sweet Lady yet for love, For love of thee Mountferrat, (Oh! what Chaines Of deity, or duty can hold love?) I have this answer fram'd, so like her hand As if it had bin moulded of: returning The Bashas Letter safe into her pocket; What you will do with it, your self best knowes, Farwell, keep my true heart, keep true your vowes. Exit Zan. Mount. Till I be dust, my Zanthia; be confirmd. Sparrowes, and Doves, sit coupling twixt thy Lips, It is not love, but strong Libidinous will That triumphs o're me, and to satiat that, What difference twixt this Moore, and her faire Dame? Night makes their hews alike, their use is so, Whose hand so subtile, he can colours name, If he do winck, and touch 'em: lust being blind, Never in women did distinction find. Exit. Scœna Secunda. Enter two Gentlewomen. 1. But yfaith dost thou think my Lady was never in love? 2. I rather think she was ever in love: in perfect charity. 1. I meane, with all the world. 2. A most christian answer I promise you: but I meane in Love with a man. 2. With a man? what els? wouldst have her in love with a beast? 1. Yon are somewhat quick: but if she were, it were no President; did, you never read of Europa the fair, that leapt A bull, that lept the Sea, that swoom to land, and then leapt her? 2. Oh heavens, a bull? 1. Yes, a white bull. 2. Lord, how could she sit him? where did she hold? 1. Why, by the horn: since which time, no woman (almost) is Contented, till she have a horne of her own, to hold by. 2. Thou art very knavish. 1. And thou very foolish: but sirah, why dost not thou marry? 1. As how? Oriana ready above 2. As thus, there is no Wife, if she be good, and true, will honour; and obey, but must reflect the true countenance of her husband upon him; if he looke sad upon her, shee must not looke merrily upon him: if he looke merrily, shee must not sorrowfully, else she is a false glasse, and fit for nothing but breaking; his anger must be her discontent; his pleasure, her delight: if he weep, she must cry: if he laugh, she must show her teeth; if hee bee sick, shee must not bee in health; if hee eate Cawdles, she must eate pottage, shee must have no proper passion of her owne; and is not this a tyrany? 1. Yes, yfaith, Marriage may well be called a yoak; Wives then are but like superficiall lines in Geometry, that have no proper motion of their own, but as their bodies their husbands move; yet I know some Wives, that are never freely merry, nor truly pleased, but when they are farthest of their husbands. 2. That's because the Moon governes 'em which hath most light and shines brightest, the more remote it is from the Sun; and contrary is more sullen, dim, and showes least splendor, when it is neerest. 1. But if I were to marry I would marry a faire effeminate foole. 2. Why? 1. Because I would lead the blind whether I list. 2. And I the wisest man I could get for money, because I had rather follow the cleer-sighted: blesse me from a husband That sales by his Wives compasse? 1. Why? 2. Why, tis ten to one but she breaks his head in her youth, and when she is old shee'l never leave till she has broke his back too— But what scurvy Knight have you here in Malta, &amp;c. Zan. Hist, wenches: my Lady cals, she's entring The Tarrasse, to see the show. 1. Oh black pudding. 2. My little labour in vaine. 1. But what scurvy Knights have we here in Malta, that when they are dubd take their oath of allegeance to live poore, and chastly ever after? 2. 'Faith many Knights in other Nations (I have heard) are as poore as ours: marry where one of 'em has taken the Oath of chastity, we want a new Columbm to find out. Exeunt. Scœna Tertia. Enter (above) Oriana, Zanchia, two Gentlewomen, (beneath) Valetta, Mountferrat, Astorius, Castorot, Gomera, Miranda, Attendants of Knights, &amp;c. Mount. Are you there Lady? Ori. Thou art a naughty man, Heaven mend thee. Ual. Our great meeting princely brothers, Ye holy souldiers of the Christian Crosse, Is to relieve our Captaine Norandine, Now fighting for Valetta, with the Turke, A vallant Gentleman, a noble Dane As ere the Country bred, endangerd now By fresh supply of head-bound Infidels. Much means, much blood this warlike Dane hath spent To advance our flag, above their horned moones, And oft hath brought in profitable conquest: We must not see him perish in our view: How far off fight they? Mir. Sir, within a League. Ual. 'Tis well: our next occasion of conventing Are these too gentlemen, standing in your sight. (Ye noble props of Malta) royally Descended are they both, valiant as war, Miranda, and Gomera, full ten years They have serv'd this Island, perfected exploits Matchles, and infinite, they are honest, wise, Not empty of one ornament of man: Most eminent agents were they in that slaughter That great marvelous slaughter of the Turks, Before St. Elme, where five and twenty thousand Fell, for five thousand of our Christians: These ripe considerations moving us (Having had your allowance on their worthies) Here we would call 'em to our Brotherhood; If any therefore can their manners tax, Their faith, their chastity, any part of life, Let 'em speak now. Ast. None do's. All. None can, great Master. Val. The dignity then dignifie, by them Is their reward: tender Miranda first (Because he is to succour Norandine) Our sacred Robe of Knight-hood, our white Crosse, The holy cognizance of him we serve, The sword, the spurrs. Mir. Grave, and most honord Master, With humble duty, and my soules best thanks To you, and all this famous Conventicle, Let me, with modesty refuse acceptance Of this high order: I (alas) am yet Unworthy, and uncapable of such honour, That merit, which with favour you enlarge Is far, far short, of this propos'd reward. Who take upon him such a charge as this, Must come with pure thoughts, and a gatherd minde That time, nor all occasions ever may After disperse, or staine; did this title here Of Knighthood, aske no other ornaments Then other countries glittring show, poor pride, A gingling spur, a feather, a white hand, A frizled hayre, powder'd, perfumes, and lust, Drinking sweet wines, surfeits, and ignorance, Rashly, and easily should I venture on't, But this requires an other kind of man. Mount. A staid, and mature judgement; speake on sir. Mir. May it please you then to allow me some small time To rectifie my selfe, for that high seate, Or give my reasons to the contrary. Ith meane space, to dismisse me to the aid Of Norandine: my Ships ride in the bay Ready to disembogue, tackel'd, and mand Even to my wishes. Mount. His request Is faire, and honest. Val. At your pleasure go. Mir. I humbly take my leave of all: of you My noble friend Mountferrat; gratious Mistris, Oh that auspitious smile doth arme your souldier, Who fights for those eyes, and this sacred Crosse, Can neither meete sad accident, nor losse. Exit Ori. The mighty Master of that Livory, Conduct thee safely to these eyes againe. Mount. Blowes the wind that way? Val. Equally belov'd, Equally meriting, Gomera, you Without excuse receive that dignity: Which our provinciall chapter hath decreed you. Gom. Great Master of Jerusalems Hospitall, From whence to Rhodes this blest Fraternity Was driven, but now among the Maltois stands, Long may it flourish, whilest Gomera serves it, But dares not enter farther. All. This is strange. Ual. What do ye object? Gom. Nothing against it, but my self (faire Knights) I may not wear this Roabe. Val. Expresse your reasons; Doth any hid sin goare your conscience? Ast. Are you unsteadfast in Religion? Cast. Or do ye intend to forsake Malta now, And visit your own Country, fruitfull Spaine. Gom. Never good sir. Ual. Then explicate your thoughts. Gom. This then: I should be perjurd to receive it, Once in Malita, your next City here, When I was younger, read I the decrees Touching this point, being ambitious then To approach it once, none but a Gentleman Can be admitted. Ual. Thats no obstacle In you. Gom. I should be sorry, that were it No married man. Mount. You never felt that yoake. Gom. None, that hath bin contracted. Cast. Were you ever? Gom. Nor married, nor contracted, none that ever Hath vowd his love to any woman kinde, Or findes that secret fire within his thoughts: Here I am cast, this Article my heart Objects against the title of my fame, I am in love; laugh not: though time hath set Some wrinkles in this face, and these curld locks Will shortly die into an other hew, Yet, yet I am in love: (yfaith you smile) What age, what sex, or what profession Divine, or humane, from the man that cries For armes in the high way, to him that sings At the high Altar, and doth sacrifice, Can truly say he knowes not what is Love? Ual. Tis honestly profest; with whom Gomera? Name the Lady, that with all advantage We may advance your suit. Gom. But will you sir? Ual. Now by our holy rock were it our sister: Spaniard, I hold thee worthy, freely name her. Gom. Be master of your word: it is she sir, The matchlesse Oriana. Ual. Come down Lady, You have made her blush, let her consent, I wil Make good my oath. Mount. Is't so? stay: I do love So tenderly Gomera, your bright flame, As not to suffer your perdition. Gom. What meanes Mountferrat? Mount. This whole auberge hath En. Guard (A Guard upon this Lady) wonder not, 'Tane publique notice of the Bassaes love Of Tripoli unto her, and consented Shee should returne this answer, as he writ For her conversion, and betraying Malta, She should advise him betray Tripoli, And turning Christian, he should marry her. All. All this was so. Mount. How weakly do's this court then Send Vessels forth to Sea, to guard the Land Taking such speciall care to save one Bark, Or strive to adde fam'd men unto our cloak, When they lurke in our bosomes would subvert This State, and us, presuming on their blood, And partiall indulgence to their sex? Ual. Who can this be? Mount. Your Sister, great Ualetta, Which thus I prove: demand the Bassa's Letter. Ori. Tis here, nor from this pocket hath bin mov'd Nor answerd, nor perus'd by— Mount. Do not swear Cast not away your faire soule, to your treason Adde not foule perjury: is this your hand? Ori. Tis very like it. Mount. May it please the Master, Confer these Letters, and then read her Answer, Which I have intercepted; pardon me Reverend Ualetta, that am made the meanes To punish this most beauteous Treachery, Even in your Sister, since in it I save Malta from ruin: I am bolder in't, Because it is so palpable, and withall Know our great Master to this Country firme. As was the Roman Marcus, who spar'd not As deere a sister in the publique cause. Ual. I am amazd; attend me. Reades the Letter. Let you forces by the next even be ready, my brother feasts, then; put in at St. Michaels, the ascent at that Port is easiest; the Keyes of the Castle, you shall receive at my hands: that possest, you are Lord of Malta, and may soone destroy all by fire, then which I am better, till I embrace you, Farewell, Your VVife, Oriana. From this time let me never read againe. Gent. w. Tis certaine her hand. Ual. This Letter too So close kept by her self, could not be answered To every period thus, but by her selfe. Ori. Sir, heare me. Ual. Peace, thou faire sweet banke of flowers, Under whose beauty Scorpions lie, and kill; VVert thou a kin to me, in some new name Deerer then sister, mother, or all blood, I would not hear thee speak: beare her to prison, So grosse is this, it needs no formall course, Prepare thy selfe, to morrow thou shalt die. Ori. I die a martyr then, and a poor maid, Almost yfaith as inocent as borne, Thou knowst thou art wicked, Frenchman, heaven forgive thee. Ex. All. This scene is strangly turnd. Ual. Yet can nature be So dead in me? I would my charge were off, Mountferrat should perceive my sister had A brother would not live to see her dye Unfought for; since the statutes of our state Allow (in case of accusations) A Champion to defend a Ladies truth. Peter Gomera, thou hast lost thy wife, Death pleads a precontract. Gom. I have lost my Tongue, My sence, my heart, and every faculty: Mountferrat, go not up: with reverence To our great master, and this consistory (I have considered it, it cannot be) Thou art a villaine, and a forger, A blood-sucker of innocence, an hypocrite, A most unworthy wearer of our Crosse; To make which good take (if thou darst) that gage, And armd at all points like a Gentleman Meet me to morrow morning, where the master, And this fraternity shall designe, where I VVill cram this slander back into thy throat, And with my swords point thrust it to thy heart, The very nest where lust and slander breedes. Pardon my passion: I will teare those spurrs Off from thy heels, and stik'em in thy front As a mark'd villain. Mount. This I lookd not for: Ten times more villany, I return my gage, And crave the Law of Armes. Gom. Tis that I crave. All. It cannot be denide. Gom. Do not I know VVith thousand gifts, and importunacies Thou often hast sollicited this Lady (Contrary to thy oath of chastity) VVho nere disclosing this thy hot reignd lust, Yet tender to prevent a publique scandall, That Christendom might justly have impos'd Upon this holy institution. Thou now hast drawn this practise 'gainst her life To quit her charity. Mount. Spaniard, thou liest. Ast. No more Gomera, thou art granted combat, And you Mountferrat must prepare against To morrow morning in the vally here Adjoyning to St. Georges Port: a Lady In case of life 'gainst whom one witnesse comes May have her champion. Ual. And who hath most right Florish Exit VVith, or against our sister, speed in fight. Enter Rocca. Mount. Rocca, the first news of Miranda service Let me have notice of. Roc. You shall: The Moore VVaytes you without. Mount. Admit her, ha, ha, ha. Oh, how my fancies run at tilt! Gomera Loves Oriana; she, as I should ghesse, Affects Miranda; these are two deer friends, As firme, and full of fire, as steele and flint. To make 'em so now, one against the other: En. Zanthia Stay, let me like it better, Zanthia; First tell me this, did Don Gomera use To give his visits to your Mistris? Zan. Yes, and Miranda too: but severally. Mount. VVhich did she most apply to? Zan. Faith to neither: Yet infinitely I have heard her praise 'em both, And in that manner, that were both one man I thinke she was in love with't. Mount. Zanthia; Another Letter you must frame for me Instantly, in your Ladies Character, To such a purpose as I'le tell thee strait, Go in, and stay me: go my Tinder-box, Crosse lines i'le crosse; so, so: my after-game I must play better: woman, I will spread My vengeance over Malta, for thy sake: Spaniard, Italian, like my steele and stone, I'le knock you thus together, were ye out To light my dark deeds, whilst I seeme precise, And winck to save the sparcles from mine eyes. Exeunt</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Scæna Prima. A Sea fight within, alarum. Enter Norandine, Miranda, and Souldiers and Gentlemen. Mir. How is it Sir? Nor. Pray set me down; I coole, And my wounds smart. Mir. I hope yet Though there be many, ther's none dangerous. Nor. I know not, nor I care not much, I got 'em Like a too forward foole; but I hope the Surgeons Will take an order I shall not leave 'em so I make the rogues more work then all the Island, And yet they give me the hardest words for my money. Mir. I am glad ye are so sprightly: ye fought bravely Go call the Surgeons Souldiers: wondrous nobly Upon my life, I have not seen such valour, Maintained so long, and to so large a ruin, The oddes so strong against ye. Nor. I thank ye, And thank ye for your help, your timely succour. By th'mas, it came ith' nick sir, and well handled; Stoutly, and strongly handled: we had duckt else, My Turke had Turk'd me else: but he has wel paid for't. Why what a Signe for an Almanack h'as made me? Enter Astorius. Ast. I am glad to finde ye here sir, of necessity I must have come aboard else; and brave Captain We all joy much in your faire victory, And all the Island speaks your valour nobly. Have ye brought the Turke in that ye took? Mir. He rides there. Nor. If he were out again, the devill should bring him. H'as truely circumcis'd me. Ast. I have a businesse Which much concernes ye, presently concernes ye; But not this place nor people: pray ye draw off sir, For tis of that weight to ye. Mir. Ile wait on ye, I must crave leave a while: my care dwels with ye, And I must wait my selfe. Nor. Your servant sir. Mir. Believe I shall, and what my love can minister; Keep your stout heart still. Nor. That's my best Physitian. Mir. And I shall keepe your fame faire. Exit. Nor. Ye are too Noble. A brave young fellow, of a matchlesse spirit; He brought me off like thunder, charg'd, and boorded, As if he had been shot to save mine honour: And when my fainting men tyr'd with their labour, And lacke of blood gave to the Turke assurance The day was his; when I was cut in shreds thus, And not a corn of Powder left to blesse us, Then flew his Sword in, then his Cannon roard, And let flie blood and death in storms amongst em. Then might I heare their sleepy Prophet howl'd too, And all their silver Crescents then I saw Like falling Meteors spent, and set for ever Under the Crosse of Malta; death so wanton I never lookt upon, so full of revell. Enter Surgeon. I will not be drest yet: Me thought that fellow Was fit for no conversation, nor no Christian That had not halfe his brains knockt out, no Souldier. Oh valiant young man, how I love thy vertue. 1 Soul. Pray ye sir be drest, alasse ye bleed apace yet. Nor. Tis but the sweat of honour (alas) thou milksop, Thou man of March-paine, canst thou feare to see A few light hurts, that blush they are no bigger, A few small scratches? get ye a Cawdle sirha, Your finger akes: and let the old wives watch thee: Bring in the booty, and the prisoners; By Heaven Ile see 'em, and dispose 'em first, Before I have a drop of blood wipt from me; goe. Exeunt Souldiers. Surg. You'l faint sir. Nor. No, ye lie sir, like an Asse, sir; I have no such pigs hurt in my belly. Sur. By my life Captaine These hurts are not to be jested with. Nor. If thou hadst 'em: They are my companions foole, my family; I cannot eate nor sleepe without their company. Dost take me for St Davy, that fell dead With seeing of his nose bleed? Enter Souldiers with booty. Sur. Here they come sir: But would you would be drest. Nor. Pox: dresse thy selfe first, Thou faintst a great deale faster; what's all this? 1 Sould. The money and the merchandize ye took sir. Nor. A goodly purchase: Is it for this we venture Our liberties and lives? what can all this doe? Get me some dozen surfeits, some seven fresh whores, And twenty pot-alleys and to: and then I am vertuous. Lay the Knights part by, and that to pay the Souldier: This is mine own, I think I have deserv'd it: Come, now looke to me, and grope me like a chambermaid, Ile neither start, nor speake; what's that i'th trusse there? 2 Soul. Tis cloth of Tissew sir, and this is Scarlet. Nor. I shall looke redder shortly then, I feare me, And as a Captaine ought, a great deale prowder. Can ye cure me of that crack, Surgeon? Sur. Yes, when your Suit's at pawn, sir. Nor. There's for your playster. A very learned Surgeon: what's in that pack there? 1 Soul. Tis English Cloth. Nor. That's a good weare indeed, Both strong, and rich: but it has a vertue A twang of the own Country, that spoiles all: A man shall nere be sober in't: Where are the Gentlemen That ventur'd with me, both their lives and fortunes? Come forward my faire spirits; Norandine Forgets his worth, when he forgets your valours. You have lost an eye, I saw ye face all hazards: You have one left yet, to choose your Mistris. You have your leg broke with a shot; yet sitting, I saw you make the place good with your Pike still. And your hand's gone; a good heart wants no instruments; Share that amongst ye: there's an eye, an arme, And that wil beare you up, when your legs cannot. Oh where's the honest Saylor? that poore fellow, Indeed that bold brave fellow, that with his Musket Taught them new waies how to put their caps off; That stood the fire of all the fight, twice blowne, And twice I gave him drownd: welcome ashore knave; Give me thy hand, if they be not both lost: faith thou art welcome, My tough knave welcom: thou wilt not shrink ith' washing. Hold, there's a piece of Scarlet, get thee hansome. And this to buy thee Buttons. Sayl. Thank ye Captaine, Command my life at all houres. Nor. Thou durst give it. You have deserv'd too. 3 Soul. We have seen the fight sir. Nor. Yes: coyld up in a Cable, like salt Eeles; Or buried low ith' ballasse: do you call that fighting? Where be your wounds? your knocks? your want of limbs rogues? Art not thou he that ask'd the Master-gunner Where thou mightst lie safest? and he strait answered, Put thy head in that hole new bor'd with a Cannon, For twas a hundred to one, another shot would not hit there: Your wages you shall have, but for rewards Take your owne waies: and get ye to the Tavernes; There, when ye are hot with Wine 'mongst your admirers, Take Ships, and Towns, and Castles at your pleasures, And make the great Turk shake at your valours. Bring in the prisoners now my brave Musulmans, Enter Prisoners, and Luscinda. You that are Lords oth' Sea, and scorn us Christians, Which of your mangy lives is worth this hurt here? Away to prison with 'em, see 'em safe; You shall finde we have Gallies too, and slaves too. 1 Soul. What shall be done with this woman sir? Nor. Pox take her, Twas she that set me on to fight with these rogues, That Ring worme rot it: what can you doe now With all your paintings, and your pouncings Lady, To restore my blood again? you, and your Cupid That have made a Carbinado of me; plague take ye, Ye are too deep ye rogue, this is thy worke woman, Thou lousie woman; 'death, you go too deep still. The seeing of your simpring sweetnesse:—ye Filly, Ye Tit, ye Tomboy, what can one nights gingling Or two, or ten, sweet heart, and oh, my deare chicken, Scratching my head, or fumbling with my fore-mast, Doe me good now? ye have powder'd me for one yeere, I am in sowce I thank ye; thanke your beauty, Your most sweet beauty: pox upon those goggles. We cannot fight like honest men, for honour, And quietly kill one another as we ought, But in steps one of you; the devils holinesse And you must have a daunce: away with her, She stinks to me now. 1 Soul. Shall I have her Captaine? 2 Soul. Or I? 3 Soul. Ile marry her. 4 Soul. Good Captaine, I. 3 Soul. And make her a good Christian; lay hands on her; I know she's mine. 2 Soul. Ile give my full share for her: have ye no manners To thrust the woman so? Nor. Share her among ye; And may she give ye as many hurts as I have, And twice as many aches. Lusc. Noble Captaine, Be pleas'd to free me from these Souldiers wildnesse, Till I but speake two words. Nor. Now for your maidenhead, You have your booke, proceed. Lusc. Victorious sir, Tis seldome seen in men so valiant, Minds so devoyd of vertue: he that can conquer, Should ever know how to preserve his conquest, Tis but a base theft else. Valour's a vertue, Crown of mens actions here; yours as you make it. And can you put so rough a foyle as violence, As wronging of weake woman to your triumph? Nor. Let her alone. Lusc. I have lost my husband, sir; You feel not that: him that I love; you care not: When fortune fals on you thus, you may grieve too; My liberty, I kneele not for; mine honour, (if ever vertuous honour toucht your heart yet) Make deere, and precious, sir: you had a mother. Nor. The rougy thing speaks finely, neat: who took ye? For he must be your guard. Lusc. I wish no better, A Noble Gentleman, and Nobly us'd me, They cal'd his name Miranda. Nor. You are his then: Ye have light upon a young man worth your service, I free ye from all the rest: and from all violence; He that doth offer't, by my head he hangs for't: Go see her safe kept, till the Noble Gentleman Be ready to dispose her: thank your tongue, You have a good one, and preserve it good still: Souldiers, come wait on me, Ile see ye paid all. Exeunt. Scena secunda. Enter Miranda and Astorius. Ast. I knew ye lov'd her, vertuously ye lov'd her, Which made me make that hast: I knew ye priz'd her As all fair minds do goodnesse. Mir. Good Astorius, I must confesse I do much honour her, And worthily I hope still. Ast. Tis no doubt sir, For on my life she is much wrong'd. Mir. Very likely: And I as much tormented I was absent. Ast. You need not feare, Peter Gomera's Noble, Of a tryd faith and valour. Mir. This I know too: But whilst I was not there, and whilst she suffer'd; Whilst vertue suffer'd, friend, oh how it loads me! Whilst innocence and sweetnesse sunke together, How cold it sits here? if my arme had fought her, My truth, though naked, stood against all treasons, My Sword here grasped, love on the edge, and honour, And but a signall from her eye to seale it, If then she had been lost; I brag too late, And too much I decline the Noble Peter. Yet some poor service I would do her sweetnesse, Alas she needs it, my Astorius, The gentle Lady needs it. Ast. Noble spirit. Mir. And what I can: prethee bear with this weaknes. Often I do not use these womens weapons But where true pitty is. I am much troubled, And something have to do, I cannot forme yet. Ast. Ile take my leave, sir, I shall but disturb ye. Mir. And please you for a while: and pray to fortune To smile upon this Lady. Ast. All my help sir. Exit. Mir. Gomera's old and stiffe: and he may lose her, The winter of his yeeres and wounds upon him: And yet he has done bravely hithero; Mountferrats fury, in his heat of summer, The whistling of his Sword like angry stormes, Renting up life by th'roots, I have seen him scale As if a Falcon had run up a traine, Clashing his warlike pynions, his steel'd curasse, And at his pitch in mew the Town below him. I must do something. Enter Collonna. Col. Noble sir, for Heaven sake Take pity of a poore afflicted Christian Redeem'd from one affliction to another. Mir. Boldly you aske that, we are bound to give it. From what affliction sir? Col. From cold, and hunger: From nakednesse, and stripes. Mir. A prisoner? Col. A slave, sir, in the Turkish prize, new taken; That in the heat of fight, when your brave hand Brought the Dane succour, got my yrons off, And put my selfe to mercy of the Ocean. Mer. And swom to Land? Col. I did sir, Heaven was gracious; But now a stranger, and my wants upon me, Though willingly I would preserve this life sir, With honesty and truth; I am not look'd on; The hand of pity, that should give for Heaven sake, And charitable hearts are grown so cold, sir, Never remembring what their fortunes may be. Mir. Thou sayst too true: of what profession art thou? Col. I have been better traind; and can serve truly, Where trust is laid upon me. Mir. A hansome fellow; Hast thou ere bore Armes? Col. I have trod full many a march, sir, And some hurts have to shew: before me too, sir. Mir. Pity this thing should starve, or forced for want Come to a worse end. I know not what thou mayst be. But if thou thinkst it fit to be a servant, Ile be a Master, and a good one to thee, If ye deserve, sir. Col. Else I aske no favour. Mir. Then sir, to try your trust, because I like you, Go to the Dane, of him receive a woman, A Turkish prisoner; for me receive her, I heare she is my prize: looke fairly to her, For I would have her know, though now my prisoner, The Christians need no Schoolmasters for honour. Take this to buy thee clothes: this Ring, to help thee Into the fellowship of my house: ye are a stranger, And my servants will not know ye else; there keep her, And with all modesty preserve your service. Col. A foule example finde me else: Heaven thank ye. Of Captaine Norandine? Mir. The same. Col. Tis done sir: And may Heavens goodnesse ever dwell about ye. Mir. Wait there till I come home. Col. I shall not faile, sir. Exeunt. Scena tertia. Enter Mountferrat with a Letter, and Abdella. Abd. Tis strange it should be so, that your high mettle should check thus poorly: dully; most un-manly. Mount. Let me alone. Abd. Thus leadenly? Mont. —take ye. Abd. At every childish feare? at every shadow? Are you Mountferrat, that have done such deeds? Wrought through such bloody fields, men shake to speak of? Can ye go back? is there a safety left yet But fore-right? is not ruine round about ye? Have ye not stil these armes, that Sword, that heart whol? Is't not a man ye fight with, and an old man, A man halfe kil'd already? Am not I here As lovely in my blacke to entertaine thee, As high, and full of heat, to meet thy pleasures? Mount. I wil be alone. Abd. Ye shall: farewell sir; And doe it bravely, never think of conscience: There is none to a man resolved be happy. Exit. Enter Miranda. Mount. No, most unhappy wretch, as thou hast made me More devil then thy selfe, I am. Mir. Alone, And troubled too, I take it: how he starts? All is not hansome in thy heart Mountferrat. God speed ye sir, I have been seeking of ye: They say you are to fight to day. Mount. What then? Mir. Nay nothing but good fortune to your Sword, sir. Ye have a cause requires it, the Islands safety, The orders, and your honours. Mount. And do you make a question I wil not fight it Nobly? Mir. Ye dare sight, Ye have, and with as great a confidence as justice, I have seen ye strike as home, and hit as deadly. Mount. Why are these questions then? Mir. Ile tell ye quickly. Ye have a Lady in your cause, a faire one, A gentler never trod on ground, a Nobler. Mount. Do ye come on so fast? I have it for ye. Mir. The Sunne nere saw a sweeter. Mount. These I grant ye: Nor dare I against beauty heave my hand up, It were unmanly, sir; too much unmanly: But when these excellencies turn to ruine, To ruine of themselves, and those protect 'em; When vertue's lost lust, and dishonour enter'd, Losse of our selves, and souls basely projected— Mir. Do you think tis so? Mount. Too sure. Mir. And can it be? Can it be thought Mountferrat, so much sweetnes, So great a magazine of all things precious, A mind so heavenly made, prethee observe me.— Mount. I thought so to: now by my holy Order, He that had told me, (till experience found it Too bold a proof) this Lady had been vitious— I weare no dull Sword sir, nor hate I vertue, Mir. Against her brother? to the man has bred her? Her blood and honour? Mount. Where ambitious lust Desires to be above the rule prescribed her, Takes hold, and wins, poore chastity, cold duty, Like fashions old forgot, she flings behind her, And puts on blood and mischiefe, death, and ruine, To raise her new built hopes, new faith to fasten her: Ma' foy, she is as foule, as heaven is beauteous. Mir. Thou liest; thou liest Mountferrat: thou liest basely. Stare not, nor swell not with thy pride: thou liest; And this shall make it good. Mount. Out with your heat first, Ye shall be fought withall. Mir. By—that Lady, The vertue of that woman, were all the good deeds Of all thy families bound in one fagot, From Adam to this houre, but with one sparkle Would fire that wispe, and turn it to light ashes. Mount. Oh pitifull young man, stroke blind with beauty! Shot with a womans smile: poore, poore Miranda; Thou hopeful young man once; but now thou lost man: Thou naked man of all that we call Noble, How art thou cozend? didst thou know what I do, And how far thy deare honour (mark me foole) Which like a father I have kept from blasting, Thy tender honour is abus'd: but fight first, And then, too late, thou shalt know all. Mir. Thou liest, stil. Mount. Stay, now Ile shew thee all, and then Ile kil thee. I love thee so deere, time shall not disgrace thee. Read that. Mir. It is her hand: it is most certaine; Good Angels keep me: that I should be her agent To betray Malta, and bring her to the Basha, That on my tender love lay all her project! Eyes, never see again, melt out for sorrow, Did the divell do this? Mount. No, but his Dam did it, The vertuous Lady that you love so deerly; Come, wil ye fight again? Mir. No, prethee kill me: For Heaven sake, and for goodnesse sake dispatch me, For the disgrace sake that I gave thee, kill me. Mount. Why, are ye guilty? Mir. I have liv'd Mountferrat, To see dishonour swallow up all vertue, And now would dye: by heavens eternall brightnesse, I am as cleere as Innocence. Mount. I knew it, And therefore kept this Letter from all knowledge, And this sword from anger, ye had died else. And yet I lye, and basely lye. Mir. O vertue! Unspotted vertue, whether art thou vanish'd? What hast thou left to abuse our fraileties In shape of goodnesse? Mount. Come, take courage, man, I have forgiven, and forgot your rashnesse, And hold you faire as light in all your actions, And by my troth I griev'd your love; take comfort, There be more women. Mir. And more mischiefe in 'em. Mount. The justice I shall doe, to right these villaines Shall make ye man againe: i'le strike it sure Sir. Come, looke up bravely: put this puling passion Out of your minde; one knock for thee Miranda, And for the Boy, the grave Gomera gave thee, When she accepted thee her Champion; And in thy absence, like a valiant Gentleman, I yet remember it: he is too young, Too Boyish, and to tender, to adventure: I'le give him one sound rap for that: I love thee, Thou art a brave young sparke. Mir. Boy did he call me? Gomera call me Boy? Mount. It pleas'd his gravity, To think so of ye then: they that doe service, And honest service, such as thou, and I doe, Are either knaves, or Boyes. Mir. Boy, by Gomera? How look'd he when he said it? for Gomera Was ever wont to be a vertuous Gentleman, Humane, and sweet. Mount. Yes, when he will, he can be; But let it goe, I would not breed dissention; 'Tis an unfriendly office, and had it been To any of a higher straine then you Sir, The well known, well approved, and lov'd Miranda, I had not thought on't: 'twas happly, his haste too, And zeale to her. Mir. A Traytor and a Boy too? Shame take me if I suffer't: puff: farewell love. Mount. Ye know my businesse, I must leave ye Sir, My houre grows on a pace. Mir. I must not leave you I dare not, nor I will not, till your goodnesse Have granted me one curtesie: ye say ye love me? Mount. I doe, and deerely: ask, and let that curtesie Nothing concerne mine honour, Mir. You must doe it. Or you will never see me more: Mount. What is it? It shall be great that puts ye of; pray speake it. Mir. Pray let me fight to day: good, deere Mountferrat, Let me, and bold Gomera— Mount. Fie Miranda, Doe ye weigh my worth so little? Mir. On my knees, As ever thou had'st true touch of a sorrow Thy friend conceiv'd, as ever honour lov'd thee. Mount. Shall I turne recreant now? Mir. 'Tis not thy cause, Thou hast no reputation wounded in't, Thines but a generall zeale: 'death: I am tainted, The deerest twyn to life, my credit's murder'd, Baffell'd, and boy'd, Mount. I am glad ye have swallow'd it, I must confesse I pitty ye; and 'tis a justice, A great one too, you should revenge these injuries: I know it, and I know ye fit and bold to doe it, And man, as much as man may: but Miranda, Why doe ye kneel? Mir. By—I'le grow to the ground here, And with my sword digge up my grave, and fall in't Unlesse thou grant me: deere Mountferrat, friend, Is any thing in my power, to my life, Sir? The honour shall be yours. Mount. I love ye deerely, Yet so much I should tender. Mir. I'le preserve all: By—I will: or all the sinne fall with me, Pray let me. Mount. Ye have won: i'le once be coward To pleasure you. Mir. I kisse your hands, and thanke ye. Mount. Be tender of my credit, and fight bravely. Mir. Blow not the sire that flames. Mount. I'le send mine Armor, My man shall presently attend ye with it, For you must arme immediately, the houre cals, I know 'twill sit ye right; be sure, and secret, And last be fortunate; farewell: ye are fitted: I am glad the load's off me. Mir. My best Mountferrat. Exeunt. Scæna quarta. Enter Norandine, and Doctor. Nor. Doctor, I will see the Combat, that's the truth on't If I had never a Legge, I would crawle to see it. Doct. You are most unfit, if I might councell ye, Your wounds so many, and the ayre— Nor. The Halter; The ayres as good an ayre, as fine an ayre; Would'st thou have me live in an oven? Doct. Beside the noyse, Sir: Which to a tender body. Nor. That's it, Doctor, My body must be cur'd withall: if you'll heale me quickly, Boyle a Drum-head in my broth: I never prosper, With knuckles o' veale, and birds in sorrell sops, Cawdles, and Cullysses; they wash me away Like a horse had eaten grains: if thou wilt cure me A pickled herring, and a pottle of Sack, Doctor, And halfe a dozen trumpets. Doct. Ye are a strange Gentleman, Nor. As ere thou knew'st: wilt thou give me an other glister That I may sit cleanly there, like a french Lady, When she goes to a Mask at Court? where's thy hoboy? Doct. I am glad ye are growne so merry. Enter Astor: &amp; Castr. Nor. Welcome Gentlemen. Ast. We come to see you sir; and glad we are To see you thus, thus forward to your health, sir. Nor. I thank my Doctor here. Doct. Nay, thanke your selfe sir, For by my troth, I know not how he's cur'd, He nev'r observes any of our prescriptions. Nor. Give me my money again then, good sweet Doctor, Wilt thou have twenty shillings a day for vexing me. Doct. That shall not serve ye sir; Drums a far off, Nor. Then forty shall sir, A low March. And that will make ye speake well: harke the Drums. Cast. They begin to beat to th'field: O noble Dane, Never was such a stake, I hope of innocence Plaid for in Malta and in blood before. Ast. It makes us hang our heads all. Nor. A bold villaine: If there be treason in it: accuse poore Ladies? And yet they may do mischief to: i'le be with ye: If she be innocent, I shall finde it quickly, And something then i'le say. Ast. Come, leane on us, sir, Nor. I thank ye Gentlemen: and domine Doctor, Pray bring a little sneezing powder in your Pocket, For feare I sound when I see blood. Doct. You are pleasant. Exeunt. Scæna quinta. Enter two Marshalls. 1. Are the Combatants come in? The Scaffold set out and the staires. 2. Yes. 1. Make the field cleere there. 2. That's done too. 1. Then to the prisoner: the grand Master's coming, Let's see that all be ready there. 2. Too ready. How ceremonious our very ends are? Alas, sweet Lady, If she be innocent, Florish. No doubt but justice will direct her Champion Enter Valetta: Norandine Astor. Castriot: &amp;c. Away: I heare 'em come: 1. Pray heaven she prosper. Val. Give Captain Norandine a chaire. Nor. I thank your Lordship. Val. Sit sir, and take your ease: your hurts require it. You come to see a womans cause descrided: That's all the knowledge now, or name I have for her: They say a false, a base, and treacherous woman, And partly prov'd too. Nor. Pitty it should be so: And if your Lordship durst aske my opinion, Sure, I should answer no: so much I honour her: And answer't with my life too: But Gomera Is a brave Gentleman; the other valiant, And if he be not good, doggs gnaw his flesh off, And one above 'em both will finde the truth out. He never failes, sir, Val. That's the hope rests with me. Nor. How nature, and his honour struggle in him! A sweet, cleere, noble Gentleman. Within, make roome there. Guard. Make roome there. Enter Oriana; Ladies, Executioner, Abdel; la: &amp; Guard. Val. Go up: and what you have to say, say there, Ori. Thus I ascend: neerer I hope to heaven, Nor do I fear to tread this dark black Mansion: The Image of my grave each foot we move, Goes to it still: each houre we leave behinde us, Knols sadly toward it: My noble Brother, For yet nine innocence dares cals ye so, And you the friends to vertue, that come hither, The Chorus to this Tragick Scæne behold me, Behold me with your justice, not with pitty, (My cause was ne're so poore to aske compassion,) Behold me in this spotlesse white I weare, The Embleme of my life, of all my actions, So ye shall finde my story, though I perish: Behold me in my Sex, I am no Souldier, Tender, and full of fears our blushing Sex is, Unhardned with relentlesse thoughts; unhatcht With blood, and bloody practise: alas we tremble; But when an angry dreame afflicts our fancies, Dye with a tale well told: had I been practis'd, And known the way of mischiefe, travell'd in it, And given my blood, and honour up to reach it, Forgot religion, and the line I sprung on, Oh heaven, I had been fit then for thy justice, And then in black as dark as hell, I had howl'd here. Last, in your own opinions weigh mine innocence; Amongst ye I was planted from an Infant (would then if heaven had so been pleas'd, I had perish'd) Grew up, and goodly, ready to bear fruit, The honourable fruit of marriage: And am I blasted in my bud with treason? Boldly, and basely of my faire name ravish'd, And hither brought to finde my rest in ruine? But he that knowes all he that rights all wrongs, And in his time restores, knows me: I have spoken. Val. If ye be innocent, heaven will protect ye, And so I leave ye to his Sword strikes for ye, Farewell. Ori. O that went deepe: farewell deere brother, And howsoe'r my cause goes, see my body (upon my knees I ask it) buried chastely; For yet, by holy truth, it never trespass'd. Ast. Iustice sit on your cause; &amp; heaven fight for ye. Nor. Two of ye Gentlemen, doe me but the honour To lead me to her: good my Lord, your leave too: Val. You have it sir. Nor. Give me your faire hands fearelesse, As white as this I see your Innocence, As spotlesse, and as pure: be not afraid Lady, You are but here brought to your nobler fortune, To adde unto your life immortall story: Vertue, through hardest things arrives at happinesse, Shame follow that blunt sword that looses you: And he that strikes against you: I shall study A curse or two for him: once more your faire hands, I never brought ill luck yet; be fearelesse happy. Ori. I thank ye, noble Captain. Nor. So I leave ye. Val. Call in the Knights severally. Enter severally Gomera, and Miranda. Ori. But two words to my Champion, And then to heaven and him, I give my cause up: Ual. Speake quickly: and speake short. Ori. I have not much sir. Noble Gomera, from your own free vertue, You have undertaken here a poore Maids honour, And with the hazard of your life: and happily You may suspect the cause, though in your true worth You will not shew it, therefore take this testimony (And as I hope for happinesse, a true one) And may it steel your heart, and edge your good sword, Ye fight for her as spotlesse of these mischiefes, As heaven is of our sinnes, or truth of errors, And so defie that treacherous man, and prosper. Nor. Blessing o'thy heart Lady. Val. Give the signall to 'em. Low Alarmes. Nor. 'Tis bravely fought Gomera; follow that blow, Well strooke againe boy: looke upon the Lady, And gather spirit: brave againe: lye close. Lye close I say: he fights aloft, and strongly: Close for thy life: a—o' that fell buffet: Retire, and gather breath: ye have day enough knights; Looke lovely on him Lady: to't againe now, Stand, stand Gomera, stand: one blow for all now. Gather thy strength together; God blesse the woman: Why, wher's thy noble heart? heaven blesse the Lady. All. Oh, Oh! Ual. She is gone, she is gone: Nor. Now strike it. Hold; hold: he yeelds: hold thy brave sword, he's conquer'd: He's thine Gomera, now be joyfull Lady: What could this theefe have done, had his cause beene equall? He made my heart strings tremble. Ual. Off with his Cask there; And Executioner, take you his head next. Abdel. Oh cursed fortune! Gom. Stay, I beseech ye sir, and this one honour Grant me, I have deserv'd it, that this villaine May live one day, to envy at my justice, That he may pine, and dye before the sword fall. Viewing the glory, I have wone her goodnesse. Ual. He shall, and you the harvest of your valour Shall reape brave sir, abundantly. Gom. I have saved her. Preserv'd her spotlesse worth from black destruction, Her white name to eternity delivered, Her youth, and sweetnesse, from a timelesse ruin. Now Lord Valetta, if this bloody labour May but deserve her favour. Mir. Stay and heare me first. Val. Of with his Cask, this is Miranda's voice. Nor. 'Tis he indeed, or else mine eyes abuse me, What makes he here thus? Ori. The young Miranda? Is he mine enemy too? Mir. None has deserv'd her If worth must carry it, and service seeke her, But he that saved her honour. Gom. That's I Miranda. Mir. No, no, that's I Gomera, be not so forward, In bargaine for my love, ye cannot cozen me. Gom. I fought it. Mir. And I gave it: which is nobler? Why every Gentleman would have done as much As you did: fought it: that's a poore desert, sir, They are bound to that; but then to make that fight sure, To doe as I did, take all danger from it Suffer that coldnesse, that must call me now Into disgrace for ever, into pitty. Gom. I undertook first, to preserve from hazzard. Mir. And I made sure no hazzard should come neere hir. Gom. 'Twas I defide Mountferrat. Mir. 'Twas I wrought him, You had had a darke day else; twas I defide His conscience first, 'twas I that shook him there, Which is the brave defiance. Gom. My life and honour At stake I lay'd, Mir. My care; and truth lay by it Least that stake might be lost: I have deserv'd her, And none but I; the Lady might have perish'd, Had Fell Mountferrat strooke it, from whose malice With cunning, and bold confidence I catch'd it, And 'twas high time, and such a service Lady For you, and for your innocence, for who knows not The all devouring sword of fierce Mountferrat? I shew'd ye what I could doe, had I beene spightfull Or Master but of halfe the poyson he beares, (Hell take his heart for't) and beshrow these hands Maddam, With all my heart, I wish a mischiefe on 'em, They made ye once looke sad: such another fright I would not put ye in, to owne the Island, Yet pardon me, 'twas but to shew a Souldier, Which, when I had done, I ended your poore coward. Val. Let some looke out, for the base Knight Mountferrat. Ab. I hope he's far enough if his man be trusty: This was a strange misfortune; I must not know it. Val. That most debosh'd knight: come down sweet sister. My spotlesse Sister; now, pray thanke these Gentlemen, They have deserv'd both truly, nobly of ye. Both excellently deerely, both all the honour All the respect and favour. Ori. Both shall have it; And as my life, their memories i'le nourish. Val. Ye are both true Knights, and both most worthy Lovers, Here stands a Lady ripen'd with your service, Yong, faire, and (now I dare say) truly honourable: 'Tis my will she shall marry: marry now, And one of you (she cannot take more nobly) your deserts Begot this will, and bred it; both her beauty Cannot enjoy: dare ye marke me your umpier? Gom., Mir. With all our Soules. Val. He must not then be angry That looses her. Gom. O that were Sir, unworthy, Mir. A little sorrow he may finde. Val. 'Tis manly. Gomera, you are a brave accomplish'd Gentleman A braver no where lives then is Miranda, In the white way of vertue, and true valour. Ye have been a pilgrime long: yet no man farther Has trod those thorny steps then young Miranda, You are gentle: he is gentlenesse it selfe: Experience Cals you her brother; 'tis his hopefull heire. Nor. The young man now, and 't be thy will. Val. Your hand sir; You undertooke first: nobly undertook, This Ladies cause: you made it good, and fought it You must be serv'd first: take her, and enjoy her, I give her to you: kisse her; are you pleas'd now? Gom. My joy's so much I cannot speake. Val. Nay, fairest sir; You must not be displeased: you breake your promise. Mir. I never griev'd at good, nor dare I now sir, Though something seeme strange to me. Ual. I have provided A better match for you: more full of beauty, I'le wed ye to our Order: there's a Mistresse, Whose beauty ne're decayes: time stands below her: Whose honour Ermin-like, can never suffer, Spot, or black soyle; whose eternall issue Fame brings up at her breasts, and leaves 'em saintied. Her you shall marry. Mir. I must humbly thanke ye. Ual. Saint Thomas Fort, a charge of no small valew I give ye too, in present, to keepe waking Your noble spirits; and to breed ye pious, Ile send ye a probation Roabe; weare that Till ye shall please to be our brother: how now? Ast. Mountferrat's fled sir. Enter Actorius. Val. Let him goe a while Till we have done these rites, and seen these coupled: His mischiefe now lyes open: come all friends now. And so let's march to th'Temple, sound those Instruments, That were the signall to a day of blood; Evill beginning houres may end in good. Florish. Nor. Come, we'll have wenches man, and all brave things. —Let her goe: we'll want no Mistresses, Good swords, and good strong Armours. Mir. Those are best Captain. Nor. And fight 'till Queenes be in love with us, and run after us. Ile see ye at the Fort within these two dayes, And let's be merry prethee. Mir. By that time I shall. Nor. Why that's well said: I like a good heart truly. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Scæna prima. Enter Norandine, and Servant, Corporall and Souldiers above. Ser. The daye's not yet broak Sir. Nor. 'Tis the cooler riding, I must goe see Miranda: bring my horse Round to the South Port: i'le out here at the beach And meet ye at the end oth' Sycamores, 'Tis a sweet walke, and if the wind be stirring Serves like a fan to coole. Corporall and Watch above singing. Ser. Which walke? Nor. Why that sir, Where the fine City dames meet to make matches. Ser. I know it. Nor. Speed ye then: what mirth is this? The watches are not yet discharged, I take it: These are brave carelesse Rogues; i'le hear the Song out And then i'le fit ye for't, merry Companions: Here's notable order, now for a trick to tame ye— Owgh, owgh. 1. Wat. Hark, hark, what's that below us? who goes there? Nor. Owgh, owgh, owgh. 2. W. 'Tis a Beare broke loose: pray call the Corporall. 1 W. The Dutchmans huge fat sow. 2. I see her now, and five fine piggs. Nor. Owgh, owgh. Corp. Now, what's the matter? 1 W. Here's the great fat Sow, Corporall. The Dutch-mans Sow, and all the Piggs, brave fat piggs, You have been wishing long she would breake loose. Nor. Owgh, owgh. Cor. 'Tis she indeed, there's a white pigg now sucking, Looke, looke, doe you see it sirs. 1 Wat. Yes, very well sir. Cor. A notable fat whorson; come two of ye. Goe downe with me, we'll have a tickling breakfast. 2 W. Let's eat 'em at the Crosse. Cor. There's the best liquor. Nor. I'le liquor some of ye, ye lazy rogues, Your mindes are of nothing but eating and swilling: What a sweet beast they have made of me? a Sow? Hogge upon hogge? I heare 'em come. Enter Cor. below and watch. Cor. Go softly, and fall upon 'em finely, nimbly. 1 W. Blesse me. Cor. Why, what's the matter? 1 W. Oh the devill! The devill, as high as a Steeple. 2 W. There he goes Corporall, His feet are cloven too. Cor. Stand, stand I say: death' how I shake? Where be your Muskets? 1 W. There's no good of them: Where be our Prayers, man? 2 W. Lord, how he stalks: speak to him Corporall. Cor. Why, what a devill art thou. Nor. Owgh owgh. Cor. A dumb devill. The worst devill that could come, a dumb devil, Give me a Musket; he gathers into me, I'th name of—speak what art thou?—speake devill, Or Ile put a plumb in your belly. Nor. Owgh, owgh, owgh. Corp. Fie, fie, in what a sweat I am! Lord blesse me, My Muskets gone too, I am not able to stirre it. Nor. Who goes there? stand speake. Corp. Sure I am inchaunted. Yet here's my harbert still: nay, who goes there sir, What have I lost my selfe? what are ye? Nor. The Guard. Corp. Why what are we then: he's not half so long now. Nor he has no taile at all, I shake still damnably. Nor. The word. Corp. 'Have mercy on me, what word do's he meane, Prethee devill if thou be'st the devill, Doe not make an Asse of me; for I remember yet As well as I am here, I am the Corporall, Ile lay my life on't devill. Nor. Thou art damn'd: Corp. That's all one: but am not I the Corporall? I would give a thousand pound to be resolv'd now, Had not I Souldiers here? Nor. No, not a man, Thou art debosh'd, and cozen'd. Corp. That may be, It may be I am drunk; Lord, where have I been? Is not this my Halbert in my hand? Nor. No, 'tis a May-pole. Cor. Why then I know not who I am, nor what, Nor whence I come. Nor. Ye are an arrand rascall; You Corporall of a watch. Cor. 'Tis the Dane's voyce: you are no devill then. Nor. No, nor no Sow, sir. Cor. Of that I am right glad sir, I was ne're so frighted in my life, as I am a Souldier. Nor. Tall watchmen, A guard for a Goose, you sing away your Centuries. A carefull company: let me out oth' port here, I was a little merry with your worships: And keepe your guards strong, though the devill walk. Hold, there's to bring ye into your wits againe. Goe off no more to hunt Piggs: such another trick And you will hunt the gallowes. Cor. Pray Sir pardon us: And let the devill come next, i'le make him stand Or make him stinck. Nor. Doe doe your duty truly. Come let me out, and come away: no more rage. Ext. Scæna secunda. Enter Abdella with a Letter, and Rocca. Ab. Write thus to me? he hath fearfully, and basely Betray'd his own cause; yet to free himselfe He now ascribes the fault to me. Roc. I know not. What he hath done: but what he now desires, His Letters have inform'd you. Ab. Yes, he is Too well acquainted with the power he holds, Over my mad affections: I want time To write: but pray you tell him, if I were No better steeld in my strong resolutions Then he hath shown himselfe in his; or thought There was a hell hereafter, or a Heaven, But in enjoying him, I should stick here, And move no further: bid him yet take comfort; For something I will doe, the devill would quake at, But Ile unty this nuptiall knot of love, And make way for his wishes: in the mean time Let him lie close, for he is strictly sought for, And practise to love her, that for his ends Scornes feare and danger. Enter Oriana, and Velleda. Roc. All this I will tell him. Exit Rocca. Abd. Do so: farewell. My Lady, with my fellow, So earnest in discourse! what ere it be Ile second it. Vel. He is such a Noble husband, In every circumstance, so truely loving, That I might say, and without flattery, Maddam The Sun sees not a Lady but your selfe That can deserve him. Abd. Of all men I say That dare (for tis a desperate adventure) Weare on their free necks the sweet yoak of woman, (For they that do repine, are no true husbands) Give me a Souldier. Ori. Why, are they more loving Then other men? Abd. And love too with more judgement; For, but observe, your Courtier is more curious To set himselfe forth richly then his Lady; His baths, perfumes, nay paintings too, more costly Then his frugality wil allow to her, His clothes as chargeable; and grant him but A thing without a beard, and he may passe At all times for a woman, and with some Have better welcome: Now, your man of Lands For the most part is carefull to manure them, But leaves his Lady fallow; your great Merchant Breakes oftner for the debt he ows his wife, Then with his creditos; and that's the reason She looks elsewhere for payment: Now your Souldier— Vel. I mary, do him right. Abd. First, who has one, Has a perpetuall guard upon her honour; For while he weares a Sword, slander her selfe Dares not barke at it: next, she sits at home, Like a great Queen, and sends him forth to fetch in Her Tribute from all parts; which being brought home, He layes it at her feet, and seeks no further For his reward, then what she may give freely, And with delight too, from her own Exchequer Which he finds ever open. Ori. Be more modest. Abd. Why, we may speak of that we are glad to taste of, Among our selves I mean. Ori. Thou talkst of nothing. Abd. Of nothing Madam? You have found it something; Or with the raising up this pretty mount here, My Lord hath dealt with spirits. Enter Gomera. Ori. Two long houres absent? Gom. Thy pardon, Sweet: I have been looking on The prize that was brought in by the brave Dane, The valiant Norandine, and have brought something, That may be thou wilt like of; but one kisse, And then possesse my purchase: there's a piece Of cloth of Tissew, this of purple Velvet, And as they sweare of the right Tyrian dye, Which others here but weakly counterfeit: If they are worth thy use, weare them; if not, Bestow them on thy women. Abd. Here's the husband. Gom. While there is any trading on the Sea Thou shalt want nothing; tis a Souldiers glory, How ever he neglect himselfe, to keep His Mistris in full lustre. Ori. You exceed sir. Gom. Yet there was one part of the prize dispos'd of Before I came, which I grieve that I miss'd of, Being almost assured, it would have been A welcome present. Ori. Pray you say, what was it? Gom. A Turkish Captive of incomparable beauty, And without question, in her Countrey Noble; Which as companion to thy faithfull Moore, I would have given thee for thy slave. Ori. But was she Of such an exquisite forme? Gom. Most equisite. Ori. And well descended? Gom. So the habit promis'd, In which she was taken. Ori. Of what yeeres? Gom. Tis said A Virgin of fourteen. Ori. I pity her, And wish she were mine, that I might have the means T'entertain her gently. Gom. She's now Miranda's, And as I have heard, made it her suit to be so. Ori. Miranda's? then her fate deserves not pity, But envy rather. Gom. Envy Oriana? Ori. Yes, and their envy that live free. Gom. How's this? Ori. Why, she is faln into the hands of one, So full of that, which in men we stile goodnes, That in her being his slave, she is happier far Then if she were confirm'd the Sultans Mistris. Gom. Miranda is indeed a Gentleman Of faire desert, and better hopes, but yet He hath his equals. Ori. Where? I would go far, As I am now, though much unfit for travailes, But to see one that without injury Might be put in the scale, or paralleld, In any thing that's Noble, with Miranda; His knowledge in all services of war, And ready courage, to put into act That knowing judgement, as you are a Souldier You best may speak of. Nor can you deliver, Nor I heare with delight, a better subject. And heaven did well, in such a lovely feature To place so chaste a mind; for he is of So sweet a carriage, such a winning nature, And such a bold, yet well dispos'd behaviour; And to all these, h'as such a charming tongue, That if he would serve under Loves fresh colours, What monumentall Trophies might he raise, Of his free conquests, made in Ladies favours? Gom. Yet you didst resist him, when he was An earnest suitor to you. Ori. Yes I did; And if I were again sought to, I should; But must ascribe it rather to the fate That did appoint me yours, then any power Which I can call mine own. Gom. Ev'n so? Abd. Thanks fortune, The plot I had to raise in him, doubts of her, Thou hast effected. Ori. I could tell you too, What cause I have to love him, with what reason. In thankfulnesse, he may expect from me, All due observance; but I passe that, as A benefit, for which in my behalfe You are his debtor. Abd. I perceive it takes, By his chang'd lookes. Ori. He is not in the City? Is he my Lord? Gom. Who Lady? Ori. Why Miranda, Having you here, can there be any else Worth my enquiry? Gom. This is somewhat more. Then love to vertue, Ori: Faith when he comes hither (as sometimes, without question you shall meet him) Invite him home. Gom. To what end? Ori. To dine with us, Or sup. Gom. And then to take a hard bed with you: Mean you not so? Ori. If you could win him to it, 'Twould be the better; for his entertainment, Leave that to me, he shall finde Noble usage, And from me a free welcome. Gom. Have you never Heard of a Roman Lady (Oriana) Remembred as a president for Matrons, (Chaste ones, I pray you understand) whose husband Tax'd for his sowre breath by his Enemy, Condemn'd his wife, for not acquainting him With his infirmity? Ori. Tis a common one; Her answer was, having kis'd none but him, She thought it was a generall disease All men were subject to; but what infer you From that my Lord? Gom. Why, that this vertuous Lady Had all her thoughts so fix'd upon her Lord, That she could finde no spare time to sing praises Of any other; nor would she imploy Her husband (though perhaps in debt to yeeres As far as I am) for an instrument To bring home younger men that might delight her With their discourse, or— Ori. What my Lord? Gom. Their persons, Or if I should speak plainer— Ori. No it needs not, You have said enough to make my innocence know It is suspected. Gom. You betray your selfe To more then a suspition; could you else To me that live in nothing but love to you Make such a grosse discovery, that your lust Had sold that heart I thought mine, to Miranda? Or rise to such a height in impudence, As to presume to worke my yeelding weaknesse To play for your bad ends, to my disgrace The Wittall, or the Pander? Ori. Doe not study To print more wounds, (for that were tyranny) Upon a heart that is pierced through already. Gom. Thy heart? thou hast pierc'd through mine honor false one, The honour of my house, foole that I was, To give it up to the deceiving trust Of wicked woman: for thy sake, vild creature, For all I have done well in, in my life, I have dig'd a grave, all buried in a wife; For thee I have defi'd my constant Mistris, That never fail'd her servant, glorious war; For thee, refus'd the fellowship of an Order Which Princes through all dangers have been proud To fetch as far as from Jerusalem: And am I thus rewarded? Vel. By all goodnesse, You wrong my Lady, and deserve her not, When you are at your best: repent your rashnesse, Twil show well in you. Abd. Do, and aske her pardon. Ori. No, I have liv'd too long, to have my faith (My tri'd faith) call'd in question, and by him That should know true affection is too tender To suffer an unkind touch, without ruine; Study ingratitude, all, from my example; For to be thankfull now, is to be false. But be it so, let me die, I see you wish it; Yet dead for truth, and pities sake, report What weapon you made choice of, when you kild me. Vel. She faints. Abd. What have ye done? Ori. My last breath cannot Be better spent, then to say I forgive you; Nor is my death untimely, since with me I take along, what might have been hereafter In scorn delivered for the doubtfull issue Of a suspected mother. Val. Oh, she's gone. Abd. For ever gone. Are you a man? Gom. I grow here. Abd. Open her mouth, and powre this Cordiall in it; If any spark of life be unquench'd in her, This will recover her. Vel. Tis all in vain, She's stiffe already: live I, and she dead? Gom. How like a murtherer I stand? look up, And heare me curse my selfe, or but behold The vengance I wilt take for't Oriana, And then in peace forsake me: Jealousie, Thou loathsome vomit of the fiends below, What desperate hunger made me to receive thee Into my heart, and soule? I let thee forth, And so in death finde ease; and do's my fault then Deserve no greater punishment? no, Ile live To keep thee for a fury to torment me, And make me know what hell is on the earth: All joyes and hopes forsake me; all mens malice, And all the plagues they can inflict, I wish it Fall thick upon me: Let my teares be laught at, And may my enemies smile to heare me groane; And dead, may I be pitied of none. Exeunt. Scena tertia. Enter Collonna and Lucinda. Luc. Pray you sir why was the Ordnance of the Fort Discharg'd so sodainly? Col. Twas the Governours pleasure, In honour of the Dane, a custome us'd, To speake a Souldiers welcome. Luc. Tis a fit one: But is my Master here too? Col. Three daies since. Luc. Might I demand without offence, so much, Is't pride in him (however now a slave) That I am not admitted to his presence? Col. His curtesie to you, and to mankind May easily resolve you, he is free From that poore vice which onely empty men Esteem a vertue. Luc. What's the reason then, As you imagine, sir? Col. Why I will tell you; You are a woman of a tempting beauty, And he, however vertuous, as a man Subject to humane frailties; and how far They may prevaile upon him, should he see you, He is not ignorant: and therefore chooses, With care t'avoyd the cause that may produce Some strange effect, which wil not well keep ranck With the rare temperance, which is admired In his life hitherto. Luc. This much increases My strong desire to see him. Col. It should rather Teach you to thank the Prophet that you worship, That you are such a mans, who though he may Do any thing which youth and heat of blood Invites him to, yet dares not give way to them: Your entertainment's Noble, and not like Your present fortune; and if all those teares Which made grief lovely in you, in the relation Of the sad story, that forc'd me to weep too, Your husbands hard fate were not counterfeit; You should rejoyce that you have means to pay A chast life to his memory, and bring to him Those sweets, which while he liv'd he could not taste of: But if you wantonly bestow them on Another man, you offer violence To him, though dead; and his griev'd spirit will suffer For your immodest loosnesse. Luc. Why, I hope sir, My willingnesse to looke on him, to whom I owe my life and service, is no proofe Of any unchast purpose. Col. So I wish too, And in the confidence it is not, Lady, I dare the better tell you he will see you This night, in which by him I am commanded, To bring you to his chamber; to what end I easily should guesse, were I Miranda; And therefore, though I can yeild liitle reason, (But in a generall love to womens goodnesse) Why I should be so tender of your honour, I willingly would bestow some counsaile of you, And would you follow it? Luc. Let me first heare it, And then I can resolve you. Col. My advice then Is, that you would not, (as most Ladies use When they prepare themselves for such encounters) Study to adde, by artificiall dressings To native excellence; yours (without help) But seen as it is now, would make a Hermit Leave his deaths head, &amp; change his after hopes Of endlesse comforts for a few short minutes Of present pleasures; to prevent which, Lady, Practice to take away from your perfections, And to preserve your chastity unstain'd, The most deform'd shape that you can put on, To cloud your bodies faire gifts, or your minds, (It being laboured to so chaste an end) Will prove the fairest ornament. Luc. To take from The workmanship of Heaven, is an offence As great, as to endeavour to adde to it; Of which Ile not be guilty: Chastity That lodges in deformity, appeares rather A mulct impos'd by nature, then a blessing; And tis commendable onely when it conquers, Though nere so oft assaulted, in resistance: For me, Ile therefore so dispose my selfe, That if I hold out, it shall be with honour; Or if I yeeld, Miranda shall finde something To make him love his victory. Exit. Col. With what cunning This woman argues for her own damnation? Nor should I hold it for a miracle, Since they are all born Sophisters, to maintaine That lust is lawfull, and the end and use Of their creation: would I never had Hop'd better of her; or could not believe, Though seen the ruine, I must ever grieve. Exit. Scæna Quarta. Enter Miranda, Norandine, Servants with lights. Mir. Ile see you in your chamber. A Table out, two stools. Nor. Pray ye no farther: It is a ceremony I expect not, I am no stranger here, I know my lodging, And have slept soundly there, when the Turks Cannon Playd thick upon't: O 'twas Royall Musicke, And to procure a sound sleep for a Souldier, Worth forty of your Fiddles. As you love me Presse it no further. Mir. You will overcome. Waite on him carefully. Nor. I have tooke since supper A rouse or two too much, and by— It warms my blood. Mir. You'l sleep the better for't. Nor. —on't, I should, had but I a kind wench To pull my Boot-hose off, and warm my night-cap, There's no charme like it: I love old Adams way; Give me a diligent Eve, to wait towards bed-time, Hang up your smooth chin page: and now I think on't, Where is your Turkish prisoner? Mir. In the Castle, But yet I never saw her. Nor. Fie upon you: See her for shame; or, hark ye, if you would Performe the friends part to me, the friends part, It being a fashion of the last edition, Far from panderisme, now send her to me; You look strange on't, no entertainments perfect Without it on my word; no livery like it; Ile tell her, he lookes for it as duly As for his see; there's no suit got without it, Gold is an asse to't. Mir. Go to bed, to bed. Nor. Well, if she come, I doubt not to convert her, If not, the sin lie on your head. Good night Exit Nor. and Servants. Enter Colonna and Lucinda. Col. There you shall finde him Lady: you know what I have said, And if you please you may make use. Luc. No doubt sir. Col. From hence I shall heare all. Mir. Come hither young one. Beshrew my heart, a handsome wench: come neerer, A very handsome one: doe not you grieve, Sweet, You are a prisoner? Luc. The losse of liberty No doubt sir, is a heavy and sharpe burden To them that feele it truly: But your servant, Your humble handmayd, never felt that rigor, Thanks to that Noble wil: no want, no hunger, (Companions still to slaves) no violence, Nor any unbeseeming act, we start at, Have I yet met with, all content and goodnesse, Civility, and sweetnesse of behaviour Dwell round about me; therefore, worthy Master, I cannot say I grieve my liberty. Mir. Do not you fancie me too cold a Souldier, Too obstinate an enemy to youth, That had so faire a Jewell in my Cabinet, And in so long a time, would nere look on it? Col. What can she say now? Luc. Sure I desir'd to see ye, And with a longing wish. Col. There's all her vertue. Luc. Pursu'd that full desire to give ye thanks sir, The onely Sacrifice I have left, and service For all the vertuous care you have kept me safe with. Col. She holds well yet. Mir. The pretty foole, speaks finely: Come sit down here. Luc. O sir, tis most unseemly. Mir. Ile have it so: sit close; now tell me truly, Did you ere love yet? Luc. My yeeres will answer that sir. Mir. And did you then love truly? Luc. So I thought sir. Mir. Can ye love me so? Col. Now! Luc. With all my duty; I were unworthy of those favours else, You daily showre upon me. Mir. What thinkst thou of me? Luc. I think ye are a truely worthy Gentleman, A pattern, and a pride to the age ye live in, Sweet as the commendations all men give ye. Mir. A pretty flattering rogue; dare ye kisse that sweet man Ye speak so sweetly of? Come. Col. Farewell vertue. Mir. What hast thou goe between thy lips? kisse once more. Sure thou hast a spell there. Luc. More then ere I knew sir. Col. All hopes goe now. Mir. I must tell you a thing in your eare, and you must heare me, And heare me willingly, and grant me so too, Twill not be worth my asking else. Luc. It must be A very hard thing sir, and from my power, I shall deny your goodnesse. Mir. Tis a good wench; I must lie with ye Lady. Luc. Tis something strange: For yet in all my life I knew no bedfellow. Mir. You will quickly finde that knowledge. Luc. To what end ur? Mir. Art thou so innocent, thou canst not guesse at it? Did thy dreams never direct thee? Luc. 'Faith none yet sir. Mir. Ile tell thee then: I would meet thy youth and pleasure; Give thee my youth for that, by Heaven she fires me, And teach thy faire white armes, like wanton Ives, A thousand new embraces, Luc. Is that all sir? And say I should try, may not we lie quietly? Upon my conscience I could. Mir. That's as we make it. Luc. Grant that, that likes ye best, what would ye doe then? Mir. What would I do? certainly, I am no baby, Nor brought up for a Nun; hark in thine eare. Luc. Fie, fie, sir. Mir. I wold get a brave boy on thee, A warlike boy. Luc. Sure we shall get ill Christians. Mir. We'l mend 'em in the breeding then. Luc. Sweet Master. Col. Never beliefe in woman come neere me more. Luc. My best and noblest sir, if a poor Virgin, (For yet by—I am so) should chance so far (Seeing your excellence, and able sweetnesse) To forget her selfe, and slip into your bosome, Or to your bed, out of a doting on ye, Take it the best way; have you that cruell heart, That murdring mind too? Mir. Yes by my troth (Sweet) have I, To lie with her. Luc. And do you think it wel done? Mir. That's as she'l think when tis done; come to bed wench, For thou art so pretty, and so witty a companion, We must not part to night. Luc. Faith let me go sir, And think better on't. Mir. Yfaith thou shalt not; I warrant thee Ile think on't. Luc. I have heard 'em say here, You are a mayd too. Mir. I am sure I am, wench, If that will please thee. Luc. I have seen a wonder, And would you lose that for a little wantonnesse, (Consider my sweet Master, like a man, now,) For a few honied kisses, sleight embraces, That glory of your youth, that crown of sweetnesse? Can ye deliver that unvalued treasure? Would ye forsake, to seeke your own dishonour, What gone, no age recovers, nor repentance? To a poore stranger? Col. Hold there again, thou art perfect. Luc. I know you do but try me. Mir. And I know Ile try you a great deale further: prethee to bed; I love thee, and so well: come kisse me once more; Is a maidenhead ill bestow'd o' me? Luc. What's this sir? Mir. Why, tis the badge (my Sweet) of that holy Order I shortly must receive, the Crosse of Malta. Luc. What vertue has it? Mir. All that we call vertuous. Luc. Who gave it first? Mir. He that gave all, to save us. Luc. Why then tis holy too? Mir. True sign of holinesse, The badge of all his Souldiers that professe him. Luc. The badge of all his souldiers that professe him, Can save in dangers? Mir. Yes. Luc. In troubles comfort? Mir. You say true, sweet. Luc. In sicknesse, restore health? Mir. All this it can do. Luc. Preserve from evils, that afflict our frailties. Mir. I hope she will be Christian: all these truly. Luc. Why are you sick then, sick to death wity lust? In danger to be lost? no holy thought, In all that heart, nothing but wandring frailties Wild as the wind, and blind as death or ignorance, Inhabit there. Mir. Forgive me heaven, she sayes true. Luc. Dare ye professe that badg, prophan that goodnes? Col. Thou hast redeemd thy self again, most rarely. Luc. That holines and truth ye make me wonder at? Blast all the bounty heaven gives, that remembrance. Col. O excellent woman. Luc. Fling it from ye quickly, If ye be thus resolu'd; I see a vertue Appear in't like a sword, both edges flaming That wil consum ye, and your thoughts, to ashes, Let them professe it that are pure, and noble, Gentle, and just of thought, that build the crosse, Not those that break it, by—if ye touch me, Even in the act, ile make that crosse, and curse ye. Mir. You shall not (fair) I did dissemble with ye, And but to try your faith, I fashioned all this: Yet something you provoakt me: this fair crosse, By me (if he but please to help, first gave it) Shall ne'r be worne upon a heart corrupted; Go to your rest, my modest, honest servant, My fair, and vertuous maid, and sleep secure there, For when you suffer, I forget this signe here. Col. A man of men too: O most perfect Gentleman! Luc. All sweet rest to your sir; I am halfe a Christian, The other half, I'le pray for, then for you, sir; Mir. This is the fowlest play i'le shew, good night, sweet. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quartus Scæna Prima. Enter Mountferrat, and Rocca. Mount. The Sun's not set yet? Roc. No Sir. Mount. Would it were, Never to rise againe to light the world. And yet, to what vaine purpose do I wish it, Since though I were inviron'd with thick mists, Black as Cymerian darknesse, or my crimes, There is that here, upon which, as an anvile Ten thousand hammers strike, and every spark They force from it, to me's an other Sun To light me to my shame? Roc. Take hope, and comfort. Mount. They are aides indeed, but yet as far from me, As I from being innocent: this cave fashioned By provident nature, in this solid Rock To be a den for beasts, alone, receives me, And having prov'd an enemy to mankinde, All humane helpes forsak me. Roc. I'le ne'r leave you, And wish you would call back that noble courage That old invincible fortitude of yours That us'd to shrink at nothing. Mount. Then it did not. But 'twas when I was honest; then in the height Of all my hapinesse, of all my glories, Of all delights, that made life pretious to me, I durst die Rocca; death it self then to me Was nothing terrible, because I knew, The fame of a good Knight would ever live Fresh on my memory; but since I fell From my integrity, and dismis'd those guards, Those strong assurances of innocence, That constancy fled from me, and what's worse, Now I am loathsome to my self; and life A burthen to me, rackd with sad remembrance Of what I have done, and my present horrors Unsufferable come, torturd with despair That I shall ne'r find mercy; hell about me, Behind me, and before me, yet I dare not Still fearing worse, put off my wretched being. Enter Abdella Roc. To see this would deterre a doubtfull man From mischeivous intents, much more the practise Of what is wicked: here's the Moore, look up sir, Some ease may come from her. Mount. New trouble rather, And I expect it. Abd. Who is this? Mountferrat? Rise up for shame, and like a river dride up With a long drought, from me, your bounteous Sea Receive those tides of comfort, that flow to you; If ever I lookt lovely, if desert Could ever challenge welcom; if revenge, And unexpected wreak, were ever pleasing Or could endear the giver of such blessings, All these I come adorn'd with, and as due Make challenge of those so long wishd embraces Which you (unkind) have hitherto denyde me. Mount. Why, what have you done for me? Abd. Made Gomera As truly miserable, as you thought him happy, Could you wish more? Mount. As if his sicknesse could Recover me; the injuries I received Were Orianas. Abd. She has paid deer for them, She's dead. Mount. How? Abd. Dead: my hate could reach no further: Taking advantage of her in a swoon, Under pretence to give a Cordiall to her I poysond her: what stupid dulnesse is this? What you should entertain with sacrifice, Can you receive so coldly? Mount. Bloody deeds Are gratefull offrings, pleasing to the devill, And thou, in thy black shape, and blacker actions Being hels perfect character, art delighted To do what I though infinitly wicked, Tremble to hear: thou hast in this tane from me All meanes to make amends with penitence, To her wrongd vertues, and dispoild me of The poor remainder of that hope was left me, For all I have already, or must suffer. Abd. I did it for the best. Mount. For thy worst ends, And be assurd but that, I think to kill thee Would but prevent, what thy despair must force thee To do unto thy self, and so to adde to Thy most assur'd damnation, thou wert dead now, But get thee from my sight: and if lust of me Did ever fire thee (love, I cannot call it) Leap down from those steep Rocks, or take advantage Of the next Tree, to hang thy self, and then I may laugh at it. Abd. In the mean time I must be bold, to do so much for you, ha, ha. Mount, Why grinst thou, devill? Abd. That 'tis in my power, To punish thy ingratitude; I made triall But how you stood affected, and since I know I am us'd only for a property, I can, and will revenge it to the full. For, understand, in thy contempt of me Those hopes of Oriana, which I could Have changd to certainties, are lost for ever. Mount. Why, lives she? Abd. Yes, but never to Mountferrat, Although it is in me, with as much ease To give her freely up to thy possession, As to remove this rush, which yet despaire of, For by my much wrongd love, flattery, nor threats, Teares, prayers, nor vowes, shall ever win me to it: So with my curse, I leave thee. Mount. Prethee stay, Thou knowst I doat on thee, and yet thou art So peevish, and perverse, so apt to take Triffles unkindly from me. Abd. To perswade me To break my neck, to hang, then damn my self, With you are trifles. Mount. 'Twas my melancholy That made me speak I know not what: forgive, I will redem my fault. Roc. Believe him Lady. Mount. A thousand times I will demand thy pardon, And keep the reckoning on thy lips, with kisses. Abd. Ther's something els, that would prevaile more with me. Mount. Thou shalt have all thy wishes do but blesse me With meanes to satisfie my madde desires For once in Oriana, and for ever I am thine, only thine my best Abdella. Abd. Were I assur'd of this, and that you would Having enjoyd her. Mount. Any thing: make choice of Thine own conditions. Abd. Swear then, that performed. (To free me from all doubts and fears hereafter) To give me leave to kill her. Mount. That our safety Must of necessity urge us to. Abd. Then know It was not poyson, but a sleeping potion Which she received, yet of sufficient strength So to bind up her sences, that no signe Of life appeard in her, and thus thought dead In her best habit, as the custome is You know in Malta, with all ceremonies She's buried in her families monument, In the Temple of St. Iohn; i'le bring you thither, Thus, as you are disguisd; some six howers hence The potion will leave working. Roc. Let us haste then. Discover Tombe Mount. Be my good angel, guid me. Abd. But remember You keep your Oath. Mount. As I desire to prosper In what I undertak. Abd. I ask no more. Exeunt. Scæna Secunda. Enter Miranda, Norandine, and Collonna. Col. Here sir, I have got the Key, I borrowd it Of him that keeps the Church, the door is open. Mir. Look to the horses then, and please the fellow. After a few devotions, i'le retire. Be not far off, there may be some use of ye, Give me the light: come friend, a few good prayers Were not bestowd in vaine now, even from you sir. Men that are bred in blood, have no way left 'em, No bath, no purge, no time to weare it out Or wash it off, but penitence, and prayer: I am to take the order, and my youth Loaden I must confesse with many follies, Circled and bound about with sins as many As in the house of memory live figures. My heart i'le open now, my faults confesse, And rise a new man, heaven I hope, to a new life. Nor. I have no great devotion, at this instant, But for a prayer or two, I will not out sir, Hold up your finger, when you have praid enough. Mir. Go you to that end. Nor. I shall ne'r pray alone sure, I have bin so us'd to answer the Clerk: would I had a cushion, for I shall ne'r make a good Hermit, and kneel till my knees are horn, these stones are plaguy hard where shal I begin now? for if I do not observe a method, I shall be out presently. Ori. Oh, oh. Nor. Whats that sir? did ye heare? Mir. Ha; to your prayers. Nor. 'Twas here abouts, t'has put me clean awry now, I shall ne'r get in again, ha, by Land, And water, all children, and all women, I there it was I left. Ori. Oh, oh. Nor. Never tell me sir, Here's something got amongst us. Mir. I heard a groane: A dismall one,— Ori. Oh, Oh. Nor. Here, tis here sir, 'tis here sir; A devill in the wall. Mir. Tis some illusion To fright us from devotion— Ori. Oh, oh. Nor. Why tis here, The spirit of a huntesman choakd with butter, Her's a new tomb, new trickments too. Mir. For certaine, This has not bin three dayes here. Nor. And a Tablet With rimes upon't. Mir. I prethee read 'em Norandine. Nor. An Epi—and Epi—taff. I think 'tis, I 'tis taff, an Epitaff. Upon the most excell, excell—lent—and. Mir. Thou canst not read. Nor. I have spoild mine eyes with gunpowder, Mir. An Epitaph upon the most vertuous, and excellent Lady The honor of Chastity, Oriana. Nor. The grand masters sister: how a devil came she here? When slipt she out oth' way, the stone's but half upon her. Mir. Tis is a sodain chang: certain the mischiefe Mountferrat offerd to her broak her heart-strings. Nor. Would he were here, I would be the clerk my self, And by this little light, I would bury him alive here, Her's no lamenting now. Ori. Oh, oh. Nor. There tis. Mir. Sure from the monument, the very stone groanes for her. Oh, deer Lady: blessing of women, vertue of thy sex; How art thou set for ever, how stolne from us. Babling, and prating now converse with women. Nor. Sir it rises, it looks up. She rises up. Mir. Heaven blesse us. Nor. It is in womans cloathes, it rises higher. Mir. It looks about, and wonders, sure she lives sir. Tis she, tis Oriana, tis that Lady. Nor. Shall I go to her? Ori. Where am I! Mir. Stand still. Ori. What place is this? Nor. She is as live as I am. Ori. What smell of earth, and rotten bones, what dark place. Lord, whether am I carried? Nor. How she stares, And sets her eyes upon him. Mir. How is't deer Lady? Do you know me, how she shakes? Ori. You are a man. Mir. A man that honours you. Ori. A cruell man, Ye are all cruell: are you in your grave too? For ther's no trusting cruell man, above ground. Nor. Byr' Lady, that goes hard. Mir. To do your service And to restore ye to the joyes you were in. Ori. I was in joyes indeed, and hope— Mir. She sincks againe Again she is gon; she is gon: gon as a shadow, She sinks for ever, friend. Nor. She is cold now, She is certainly departed, I must cry too. Mir. The blessed angels guide thee: put the stone too, Beauty thou art gon to dust, goodnesse to ashes. Nor. Pray take it well: we must all have our houres sir. Mir. I, thus we are; and all our painted glory, A buble that a boy blowes in toth' ayre, And there it breaks. Nor. I am glad ye sav'd her honour yet. Mir. Would I had sav'd her life now too: oh heaven For such a blessing, such a timely blessing O friend, what deer content 'twould be, what story To keep my name from wormes? Oria. Oh, oh. Nor. She lives again, 'Twas but a trance. Mir. Pray ye call my man in presently Help with the stone first, oh she stirs againe. Oh call my man away. Nor. I fly, I fly sir. Mir. Upon my knees O heaven, O heaven I thank thee. The living heat steales into every member; En. Colonn. &amp; Norand. Come help the Coffin out, softly, and sodainly VVhere is the Clerk? Col. Drunk above, he is sure sir. Mir. Sirah, you must be secret. Col. As your soule sir. Mir. Softly good friend, take her into your armes. Nor. Put in the crust againe. Mir. And bring her out there when I am a horseback My man, and I will tenderly conduct her Unto the Fort; stay you, and watch what issue, And what inquirie's for the body. Nor. Well sir. Mir. And when ye have done, come back to me. Nor. I will. Mir. Softly, oh softly. Nor. She growes warmer still sir. Col. What shall I do with' Key? Mir. Thou canst not stir now, Leave it ith' door: go get the horses ready. Exeunt Roc. The door's already open, the Key in it. En. Rocca Mountferrat Abdella. With a dark lanthorn. Mount. What were those past by? Roc. Some scout of Souldiers, I think. Mount. It may be well so, for I saw their horses, They saw not us I hope. Abd. No, no, we were close, Beside they were far off. Mount. What time of night is't? Abd. Much about twelve I think. Roc. Let me go in first For by the leaving open of the door here There may be some body in the Church: give me the Lanthorne. Abd. You'l love me now I hope. Mount. Make that good to me Your promise is engaged for. Abd. Why she is there Ready prepar'd, and much about this time Life will look up again. Roc. Come in all's sure, Not a foot stirring, nor a tongue. Mount. Heaven blesse me, I never enter'd with such unholy thoughts This place before. Abd. Ye are a fearfull foole, If men have appetites allow'd 'em, And warm desires, are there not ends too for 'em? Mount. Whether shall we carry her? Roc. Why, to the bark sir, I have provided one already waites us The wind stands wondrous fair too for our passage. Abd. And there, when ye' have enjoyd her, for ye have that liberty Let me alone to send her to feed fishes, I'le no more sighes for her. Mount. Where is the monument? Thou art sure she will awake about this time? Abd. Most sure, If she be not knockt oth' head: give me the Lanthorn, Here 'tis, how is this, the stone off? Roc. I, and nothing Within the monument, that's worse, no body I am sure of that, nor signe of any here, But an empty Coffin. Mount. No Lady. Roc. No, nor Lord sir, This Pye has bin cut up before. Abd. Either the Devill Must doe these tricks— Mount. Or thou, damn'd one, worse; Thou black swoln pitchie cloud, of all my afflictions: Thou night hag, gotten when the bright Moone sufferd Thou hell it self confin'd in flesh: what trick now? Tell me, and tell me quickly what thy mischief Has done with her, and to what end, and whether Thou hast remov'd her body, or by this holy place This sword shall cut thee into thousand peeces A thousand thousand, strow thee ore the Temple A sacrifice to thy black sire, the Devill. Rod. Tell him, you see he's angry. Abd. Let him burst, Neither his sword, not anger do I shake at, Nor will yeild to feed his poor suspicions, His idle jealouzies, and madde dogs heares One thought against my self: ye have done a brave deed A manly, and a valiant peece of Service When ye have kill'd me; reckon't amongst your Battels: I am sorry ye are so poore, so weake a gentleman Able to stand no fortune: I dispose of her? My mischiefe make her away? a likely project, I must play booty against my selfe, if any thing crosse ye I am the devill, and the devils heire, All plagues, all mischiefes. Mount. Will ye leave and doe yet? Ab. I have done too much, Far, far too much for such a thanklesse fellow, If I be devill, you created me, I never knew those arts, nor bloody practises (—o' your cunning heart, that mine of mischiefe) Before your flatteries won 'em into me, Here did I leave her, leave her with that certainty About this houre to wake again. Mount. Where is she? This is the last demand. Ab. Did I now know it, And were I sure, this were my latest minute I would not tell thee: strike, and then i'le curse thee: Rocca. I see a light, stand close, and leave your angers. We all miscarry else. Enter Gomera, Page with Torch. Ab. I am now carelesse, Mount. Peace, prethee peace, sweet, peace, all friends, Ab. Stand close then. Gom. Waite there Boy, with the light, till I call to thee, In darknesse was my soule and sences clouded When my faire Jewell fell, the night of jealousie, In all her blacknesse drawn about my judgement: No light was let into me: to distinguish Betwixt my suddain anger and her honour, A blinde sad Pilgrimage shall be my pennance, No comfort of the day will I looke up at: Far darker then my jealous Ignorance Each place of my aboad shall be my: prayers No ceremonious lights shall set off more; Bright Armes, and all that carry lustre, life, Society, and sollace, I forsake ye. And were it not once more to see her beauties (For in her bed of death, she must be sweet still,) And on her cold sad lips seal my repentance; Thou child of heaven, faire light I could not misse thee. Mount. I know the tongue, would I were out againe I have done him too much wrong to looke upon him. Ab. There is no shifting now, boldnesse, and confidence Must carry it now away: he is but one neither, Naked as you are, of a strength far under Mount. But he has a cause above me, Ab. That's as you handle it. Roc. Peace: he may goe againe, and never see us. Gom. I feele I weepe apace, but where's the flood, The torrent of my teares, to drown my fault in, I would I could now like a loaden cloud Begotten in the moyst south, drop to nothing Give me the Torch, Boy. Roc. Now he must discover us. Ab. He has already, never hide your head Be bold, and brave, if we must dye together. Gom: Who's there? what friend to sorrow? The Tombe wide open The Stone off too? the body gone, by— Looke to the doore Boy: keep it fast, who are ye? What sacrilegious villaines? false Mountferrat, The wolfe to honour, h'as thy hellish hunger, Brought thee to tear the body out oth' tomb too? Has thy foule mind so far wrought on thee? ha, Are you there too? nay, then I spie a villany I never dream't of yet, thou sinfull usher Bred from that rottennesse, thou bawd to mischiefe, Doe you blush through all your blacknesse? will not that hide it? Ab. I cannot speake. Gom. You are well met, with your dam, sir, Art thou a Knight? did ever on that sword, The Christian cause sit nobly? could that hand fight, Guided by fame, and fortune? that heart inflame thee, With vertuous fires of valour, to fall off, Fall off so suddainly, and with such foulenesse, As the false Angels did, from all their glory? Thou art no Knight, honour thou never heard'st of, Nor brave desires could ever build in that breast, Treason, and tainted thoughts, are all the Gods Thou worship'st, all the strength thou hadst: and fortune; Thou didst things out of feare, and false heart, villaine Out of close traps and treacheries, they have rais'd thee. Mount. Thou rav'st old man. Gom. Before thou get'st off from me, Had'st thou the glory of thy first fights on thee Which thou hast basely lost, thy noblest fortunes, And in their greatest lustres, I would make thee Before we part, confesse, nay, kneele, and doe it, Nay, crying kneele, coldly for mercy, crying: Thou art the recreant'st Rogue, time ever nourish'd, Thou art a dogge, I will make thee sweare, a dog stav'd, A mangy Cur-dogge; doe you creep behind the Altar? Looke how it sweats, to shelter such a rascall; First, with thy venemous tooth infect her chaste life, And then not dare to doe; next, rob her rest, Steale her dead body out oth' grave. Mount. I have not. Gom. Prethee come out, this is no place to quarrell in, Valiant Mountferrat come, Mount. I will not stir. Gom. Thou hast thy sword about thee, That good sword, that never fail'd thee: prethee come, We'l have but five stroakes for it, on, on Boy, Here's one would faine be acquainted with thee, Would wondrous fain cleave that Calves-head of yours sir, Come, prethee let's dispatch, the Moone shines finely: Prethee be kill'd by me, thou wilt be hang'd else, But it may be, thou long'st to be hang'd. Roc. Out with him, Sir, You shall have my sword too: when he's dispatch'd once We have the world before us. Gom. Wilt thou walke fellow, I never knew a Rogue, hang arse-ward so, And such a desperate knave too. Ab. Pray goe with him, Something I'le promise too, Mount. You would be kill'd then? No remedy; I see, Gom. If thou dar'st doe it? Mount. Yes, now I dare; lead out, i'le follow presently Vnder the Mount i'le meet ye. Gom. Goe before me, Ile have ye in a string too. Mount. As I am a Gentleman, And by this holy place, I will not faile thee, Feare not, thou shalt be kill'd, take my word for it I will not faile. Gom. If thou seap'st thou hast Cats luck, The Mount? Mount. The same: make haste, I am there before else. Gom. Goe get ye home; now if he scape I am Cowar'd. Mount. Well, now I am resolv'd, and he shall finde it. Exeunt. Scæna Tertia. Enter Miranda, Lucinda, Collonna. Mir. How is it with the Lady? Luc. Sir, as well As it can be with one, who feeling knowes now What is the curse the divine justice lay'd On the first sinfull woman. Mir. Is she in travell? Luc. Yes sir; and yet the troubles of her mind Afflict her more, then what her body suffers, For in the extremity of her paine, she cries out, Why am I here? Where is my Lord Gomera, Then sometimes names Miranda, and then sighes, As if to speake, what questionlesse she loves well, If heard, might doe her injury. Col. Heavens sweet mercy Looke gently on her, Mir. Prethee tell her, my Prayers Are present with her, and good wench provide That she want nothing: what's thy name? Luc. Lucinda. Mir. Lucinda? there's a prosperous omen in it, Be a Lucina to her, and bring word That she is safe delivered of her burthen, And thy rewards thy liberty: come Collonna, We will goe see how th'Engineer has mounted The Canon the great Master sent, be carefull. To view the workes, and learn the discipline That is us'd here: I am to leave the world And for your service, which I have found faithfull. The charge that's mine, if I have any power Hereafter may concerne you. Col. I still finde A noble Master in you, Mir. 'Tis but justice, Thou do'st deserve it in thy care, and duty. Exeunt. Scæna quarta. Enter Gomera, Mountferrat, Rocca, Abdella, with a Pistoll. Gom. Here's even ground, i'le stir no foot beyond it, Before I have thy head. Mount. Draw Rocca. Gom. Coward, Hath inward guilt, rob'd thee as well of courage As honesty? that without oddes thou dar'st not Answer a single Enemy? Mount. All advantage That I can take, expect. Roc. We know you are valiant, Nor doe we purpose to make further triall Of what you can doe now: but to dispatch you. Mount. And therefore fight, and pray together. Gom. Villaines, Whose basenesse, all disgracefull words made one, Cannot expresse; so strong is the good cause That seconds me, that you shall feele, with horrour To your proud hopes, what strength is in that arme, Though old, that holds a sword made sharp by justice. Ab. You come then here, to prate? fight. Mount. Helpe Rocca, now, Or I am lost for ever; how comes this? Are villany, and weaknesse twynes? Roc. I am gone too. Gom. You shall not scape me, wretches, Ab. I must doe it, All will goe wrong else. shoots him Gom. Treacherous bloody woman, What hast thou done? Ab. Done a poor womans part, And in an instant, what these men so long Stood fooling for. Mount. This aide was unexpected, I kisse thee for't, Roc. His right armes onely shot, And that compell'd him to forsake his sword, He's else unwounded. Mount. Cut his throat. Ab. Forbeare. Yet doe not hope 'tis with intent to save thee. But that thou maist live to thy farther torment To see who triumphes over thee: come Mountferrat, Here joyne thy foot to mine, and let our hearts Meet with our hands, the contract that is made And cemented with blood, as this of ours is, Is a more holy sanction, and much surer, Then all the superstitious ceremonies Enter Norandine. You Christians use. Roc. Who's this? Mount. Betray'd againe? Nor. By the report it made, and by the wind The Pistoll was discharged here. Gom. Norandine, As ever thou lov'st valour, or wear'st Armes To punish basenesse, shew it. Nor. O the devill, Gomera wounded, and my Brache black beauty An actor in it? Ab. If thou strik'st, i'le shoot thee. Nor. How? fright me with your Pot-gun? what art thou? Good heaven, the Rogue, the traytor rogue Mountferrat To swinge the neast of you, is a sport unlook'd for, Hels—consume you. Mount. As thou art a man; I am wounded, give me time to answer thee. Go. Durst thou urge this? this hand can hold a sword yet. Nor. Well done: to see this villaine, makes my hurts Bleed fresh againe, but had I not a bone whole, In such a cause I should doe thus, thus Rascals. Enter Corporall and watch. Cor. Disarme them, and shoot any that resists. Gom. Hold Corporall; I am Gomera, Nor. 'Tis well yet, that once in an age you can Remember what you watch for: I had thought You had again been making out your parties For sucking piggs. 'Tis well: Nor. As you will answer The contrary with your lives, see these forth coming. Cor. That we shall doe. Nor. You bleed a pace: good Souldiers Goe helpe him to a Surgeon, Roc. Dare the worst, And suffer like your selfe. Ab. From me learne courage. Nor. Now for Miranda, this newes will be to him As welcome, as 'tis unexpected: Corporall, There's something for thy care to night: my horse there. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quintus. Scæna prima. Enter Oriana, and Lucinda. Ori. How do's my Boy? Luc. Oh, wondrous lusty, Madam, A little Knight already: you shall live To see him tosse a Turke. Ori. Gentle Lucinda, Much must I thank thee for thy care, and service. And may I grow but strong to see Ualetta, Enter Miranda, Norandine, Collonna. My husband, and my brother, thou shalt finde I will not barely thank thee. Mir. Looke Captaine, we must ride away this morning The Auberge sits to day, and the great Master Writes plainly, I must or deliver in (The yeere expir'd) my probation weed; Or take the Cloake: you likewise Norandine For your full service, and your last assistance In false Mountferrats apprehension Are here commanded to associate me; my twin in this high honour. Nor. Ile none on't: doe they think to bind me to live chaste, sober, and temperately, all dayes of my life? they may as soone tye an Englishman to live so: I shall be a sweet Dane, a sweet Captaine, goe up and downe drinking small beere, and swearing 'odds neagues; no Ile live a Squire at Armes still, and doe thou so too; and thou beest wise: I have found the mystery now, why the Gentlemen weare but three barres of the crosse, and the knights the whole one. Mir. Why Captaine? Nor. Mary sir, to put us in remembrance, we are but three quarters cross'd in our licence, and pleasures: but the poore Knights cross'd altogether; the brothers at Armes, may yet meet with their Sisters at Armes, now and then, in brotherly love; but the poore Knights cannot get a Lady for love, nor money: 'tis not so in other Countries I wis, pray haste you, for i'le along, and see what will come on't. Exit. Mir. Collonna, provide strait, all necessaries For this remove, the Lytter for the Lady, And let Lucinda beare her company, You shall attend on me. Coll. With all my duties Exit. Mir. How fare you, gracious Mistresse? Ori. O Miranda. You pleas'd to honour me with that faire title When I was free, and could dispose my selfe; But now, no smile, no word, no looke, no touch Can I impart to any, but as theft From my Gomera; and who dares accept, Is an usurper. Mir. Leave us; I have touch'd thee, (Thou fairer vertue, then thou'rt beautifull) Hold but this test, so rich an ore was never Altar ready, Tapers &amp; booke. Try'd by the hand of man, on the vast earth: Sit brightest Oriana, is it sinne Still to professe I love you, still to vow I shall doe ever? heaven my witnesse be, 'Tis not your eye, your cheeke, your tongue, no part That superficially doth snare young men, Which has caught me; read over in your thoughts The story that this man hath made of you, And thinke upon his merit. Ori. Onely thought Can comprehend it. Mir. And can you be so Cruell, thankelesse, to destroy his youth That sav'd your honour, gave your double life? Your own, and your faire Infants? that when fortune (The blind foe to all beauty, that is good,) Bandied you from one hazard to another, Was even heavens Messenger, by providence Call'd to the Temple, to receive you there, Into these Armes, to give ease to your throwes, As if't had thunder'd; take thy due Miranda, For she was thine; Gomera's jealousie Strooke death unto thy heart; to him be dead, And live to me, that gave thee second life: Let me but now enjoy thee: Oh regard The torturing fires of my affections. Ori. Oh master them, Miranda, as I mine; Who follows his desires, such tyrants serves As will oppresse him, insupportably. My flames, Miranda, rise as high as thine, For I did love thee 'fore my marriage, Yet would I now consent, or could I think Thou wert in earnest, (which by all the soules That have (for chastity) been sanctified I cannot) in a moment I doe know Thou'ldst call faire temperance up to rule thy blood, Thy eye was ever chaste, thy countenance too honest, And all thy woings was like maidens talk; Who yeeldeth unto pleasures, and to lust Is a poore captive, that in Golden Fetters (And pretious (as he thinkes) but holding gyves) Frets out his life. Mir. Find such another woman, And take her for his labour, any man: Ori. I was not worthy of thee, at my best, Heaven knew I was not, I had had thee else; Much lesse now gentle sir; Mirandas deeds Have been as white, as Orianas fame, From the beginning, to this point of time, And shall we now begin to staine both thus? Think on the legend which we two shall breed Continuing as we are, for chastest dames And boldest Souldiers to peruse and read, I and read thorough, free from any act To cause the modest cast the booke away, And the most honour'd Captaine fold it up. Mir; Fairest; let goe my hand: my pulse beats thick, And my mov'd blood rides high in every vaine, Lord of thy selfe now, Souldier, and ever: I would not for Aleppo, this fraile Bark, This barke of flesh, no better steeres-man had Then has Mountferrat's: may you kisse me, Lady? Ori. No; though't be no essentiall injury, It is a circumstance due to my Lord, To none else: and my deerest friend, if hands Playing together, kindle heate in you, What may the game at lips provoke unto? Mir. Oh what a tongue is here? whil'st she doth teach My heart to hate my fond unlawfull love, She talkes me more in love, with love to her, My fires she quencheth with her arguments, But as she breathes 'em, they blow fresher fires. Sit further: now my flame cooles; husband, wife, There is some holy mystery in those names That sure the unmarried cannot understand. Ori. Now thou art strait, and do'st enamour me, So far beyhnd a carnall earthly love; My very soule doats on thee, and my spirits Doe embrace thine, my minde doth thy mind kisse, And in this pure conjunction we enjoy A heavenlyer pleasure then if bodies met: This, this is perfect love, the other short, Yet languishing fruition, every Swaine And sweating Groome may clasp, but our's refinde Two in ten ages cannot reach unto; Nor is our spirituall love, a barren joy, For mark what blessed issue we'll beget, Deerer then children to posterity, A great example to mens continence, And womens chastity, that is a childe More faire, and comfortable, then any heire. Mir. If all wives were but such, lust would not finde One corner to inhabit, sinne would be So strange, remission superfluous: But one petition, I have done. Ori. What (Sweet?) Mir. To call me Lord, if the hard hand of death seize on Gomera first. Ori. Oh, much too worthy; How much you undervalue your own price, To give your unbought selfe, for a poore woman, That has been once sold, us'd, and lost her show? I am a garment worne, a vessel crack'd, A zoane untide, a Lilly trod upon, A fragrant flowre cropt by anothers hand, My colour sullyde, and my odour chang'd, If when I was new blossom'd, I did feare My selfe unworthy of Mirandas spring: Thus over-blown, and seeded, I am rather Fit to adorn his Chimney, then his bed. Mir. Rise miracle: save Malta, with thy vertue, If words could make me proud, how has she spoke, Yet I will try her to the very block: Hard-hearted, and uncivill Oriana, Ingratefull payer of my industries, That with a soft painted hypocrisie Cozen'st, and geer'st my perturbation, Expect a witty, and a fell revenge: My comfort is, all men will thinke thee false, Beside thy husband having been thus long Enter Nor. Collonna &amp; Lucinda with a Childe. (on this occasion) in my Fort, and power. Ile heare no more words: Captaine, let's away With all care see to her: and you Lucinda Attend her diligently: she is a wonder. Nor. Have you found she was well delivered: What, had she a good Mid-wife, is all well? Mir. You are merry Norandine. Luc. Why weepe you, Lady? Ori. Take the poor Babe along. Col. Madam 'tis here. Ori. Dissembling death, why didst thou let me live To see this change, my greatest cause to grieve? Exeunt. Scæna secunda. Enter Astorius, Castriot, Valetta, Gomera, Synnet: Knights, 2 Bishops, Mountferrat, guarded by Corporall and Souldiers, Abdella, a Gentleman with a cloake, sword, and Spurres: Gomara. Val. A tender husband hast thou shew'd thy selfe My deerest brother, and thy memory After my life, in brazen Characters, Shall monumentally be register'd To ages consequent, till times running hand, Beats back the world to undistinguish'd Chaos, And on the top of that thy name shall stand Fresh, and without decay. Gom. Oh honour'd sir! If hope of this, or any blisse to come Could lift my load of griefe off from my soule, Or expiate the trespasse 'gainst my wife, That in one houres suspition I begat, I might be won to be a man againe, And fare like other husbands, sleepe and eate, Laugh, and forget my pleasing penitence; But till old nature can make such a wife Againe, I vow ne're to resume the order And habits, that to men are necessary, All breath i'le spend in sighes, all sound in groanes, And know no company but my wasting moans. Ast. This will be wilfull murder on your self, Nor like a Christian doe you beare the chance Which th'inscrutable will of heaven admits. Gom. What would you have my weaknesse doe, that Suffer'd it selfe thus to be practis'd on, By a damn'd hell-hound, and his agent dam, The impious mid-wife to obortive birthes, And cruell instrument to his decrees? By forgery they first assail'd her life, Heaven playing with us yet, in that, he wrought My deerest friend, the servant to her vertue To combat me, against his Mistresse truth. That yet effectlesse, this enchanting witch, Bred banefull jealousie against my Lady, My most immaculate Lady, which seiz'd on her Almost to death: Oh yet! not yet content, She in my hand put (to restore her life As I imagin'd) what did execute Their devillish malice, farther, great with childe, Was this poore innocent, that too was lost, They doubled death upon her, not staying there, They have done violence unto her Tomb, Not granting rest unto her in the grave: I wish Miranda had injoy'd my prize; For sure I'm punish'd for usurping her, Oh what a Tyger is resisted Lust? How it doth forrage all? Mount. Part of this tale I grant you true; but 'twas not poyson given her. Ab. I would it had, we had been farre enough, If we had been so wise, and had not now Stood curtsing for your mercies here. Mount. Beside, What is become oth' body? we know not. Val. Peace impudents, And deere Gomera practise patience As I my self must, by some meanes at last We shall dissolve this riddle. Gom. Wherefore comes This villaine in the festivall array, As if he triumph'd for his treacherie? Cast. That is by our appointment: give us leave, You shall know why a non. Enter Miranda, Norandine, Collona. Val. One of the Esguard. Esg. The Gentlemen are come, Val. Truyce then a while With our sad thoughts; what are you both resolv'd? Nor. Not I my Lord: your downe right Captain still Ile live, and serve you, not that altogether I want compunction of conscience, I have enough to save me, and that's all, Bar me from drink, and drabs, ev'n hang me too, You must ev'n make your Captaines capons first, I have too much flesh for this spirituall Knighthood, And therefore do desire forbearance, sir, Till I am older, or more mortifide, I am too sound yet. Ual. What say you Miranda? Mir. With all pure zeale to Heaven, duty to you, I come to undergo it. Ual. Proceed toth' ceremony. Gom. Before you match with this bright honor'd title, Admir'd Miranda, pardon what in thought I ever did transgresse against your vertue, And may you find more joy with your new bride Then poor Gomera ere in joyd with his. But 'twas mine own crime, and I suffer for't: Long wear your dignity, and worthily, Whilst I obscurely in some corner vanish, Mir. Have stronger thoughts, and better, first I crave According to the order of the Court I may dispose my captives, and the fort, That with a clean and purified heart The fittiler I may endue my roabe. All. Tis granted. Enter Oriana vaild, Ladies, Lucinda, child. Mir. Bring the captives. To your charge And staid tuition my most noble friend; I then commend this Lady; start not off A fairer, and a chaster never liv'd; By her own choyce you are her Guardian, For telling her I was to leave my fort, And to abandon quite all worldly cares. Her own request was, to Gomeras hands She might be given in custody, for sh'ad heard He was a Gentleman wise, and temperate, Full of humanity to womenkind, And cause he had bin married knew the better How to entrat a Lady. Val. What Country woman is she? Mir. Borne a Greek. Val. Gomera, 'twill be barbarous to deny A Lady, that unto your refuge flyes, And seekes to shrowd her under vertues wing. Gom. Excuse me noble sir; oh think me not So dull a devill, to forget the losse Of such a matchlesse wife as I posses'd, And ever to endure the sight of woman: Were she the abstract of her sex for forme, The only warehouse of perfection, Where there no Rose, nor Lilly but her Cheek, No Musick but her tongue; vertue but hers; She must not rest near me, my vow is graven, Here in my heart, irrevocably breath'd And when I break it, Ast. This is rudenesse Spaniard, Unseasonably you play the Timonist, Put on a disposition is not yours, Which neither fits you, nor becomes you. Gom. Sir. Cast. We cannot force you but we would perswade. Gom. Beseech you Sir, no more I am resolv'd To forsake Malta, tread a Pilgrimage To faire Jerusalem, for my Ladies soule, And will not be diverted. Mir. You must beare This Child along 'we then. Gom. VVhat Child? All. How's this? Mir. Nay then Gomera, thou art injurious, This child is thine, and this rejected Lady Thou hast as often known, as thine own wife, And this I'le make good on thee, with my sword. Gom. Thou durst as well blaspheme: if such a scandall (I crave the rights due to a Gentleman) Women unvaile. Ori. Will you refuse me yet? Gom. My wife! Ual. My sister! Gom. Some body, thank Heaven I cannot speak. All. All praise be ever given: Mount. This saves our lives, yet would she had bin dead; The very sight of her afflicts me more Then fear of punishment, or my disgrace. Ual. How came you to the Temple? Mir. Sir, to do My poor devotions, and to offer thanks For scaping a temptation ne'r perform'd VVith this faire virgin. I restore a wife Earth cannot paralell: and busie nature If thou wilt still make women, but remember To work 'em by this sampler; take heed sir, Henceforth you never doubt sir. Gom. VVhen I do Death take me sodainly. Mir. To encrease your happinesse To your best wife, take this addition. Gom. Alack, my poor knave. Ual. The confession The Moor made 't seemes was truth. Nor. Mary was it sir; the only truth that ever issud out of hell, which her black jawes resemble; a plague o' your bacon-face, you must be giving drinks with a vengance; ah thou branded bitch: do 'ye stare, gogles, I hope to make winter bootes o' thy hide yet, she feares not damning: hell fire cannot parch her blacker then she is: do 'ye grin, chimney sweeper. Ori. VVhat is't Mranda? Mir. That you would please Lucinda might attend you. Col. That suit sir, I consent not to. Luc. My husband? My deerest Angelo? Nor. More liggam bobs; is not this the fellow that swom Like a duck to th'shoare in our sea-service? Col. The very same, do not you know me now sir, My name is Angelo, though Colonna vaild it, Your Countryman, and kinsman born in Florence, VVho from the neighbour Island here of Goza VVhas captive lead, in that unfortunate day VVhen the Turk bore with him three thousand soules; Since in Constantinople have I liv'd VVhere I beheld this Turkish Damosell first. A tedious suitor was I for her love, And pittying such a beauteous case should hide A soule prophan'd with infidelity, I labourd her conversion with my love, And doubly won her; to faire faith her soule She first betroth'd, and then her faith to me, But fearfull there to consummate this contract VVe fled, and in that flight were tane againe By those same Gallies, fore Valletta fought. Since in your service I attended her, VVhere, what I saw, and heard, hath joy'd me more Then all my past afflictions greiv'd before. Ual. Wonders crown wonders: take thy wife Miranda. Be henceforth called our Malta's better angell, And thou her evill Mountferrat. Nor. Wee'l call him Cacodemon, with his block gib there, his Succuba, his devils seed, his spawn of Phlegeton, that o' my conscience was bred o' the spume of Cocitus; do ye snarle you black jill? she looks lie the Picture of America. Val. Why stay we now. Mir. This last petition to the Court, I may bequeath the keeping of my Fort To this my kinsman, toward the maintenance Of him, and his faire vertuous wife; discreet, Loyall, and valiant I dare give him you. Val. You must not ask in vaine, sir. Col. My best thanks To you my noble Cozen, and my service To the whole Court; may I deserve this bounty. Ual. Proceed to th'ceremony, one of our Esguard Degrade Mountferrat first Mount. I will not sue For mercy, 'twere in vaine; fortune thy worst. Musick An altar discovered, with Tapers, and a book on it. The two Bishops stand on each side of it Mountferrat as the Song is singing ascends up the altar. See see, the staine of honor, vertues foe, Of Virgins fair fames, the foule overthrow, That broken hath his oath of chastity Dishonor'd much this holy dignity, Off with his Roab, expell him forth this place, Whilst we rejoyce, and sing at his disgrace. Val. Since by thy actions thou hast made thy self Unworthy of that worthy signe thou wear'st, And of our sacred order, into which For former vertues, we receiv'd thee first, According to our Statutes, Ordinances, For praise unto the good, a terror to The bad, and an example to all men; We here deprive thee of our habit, and Declare thee unworthy our society, From which we do expell thee, as a rotten Corrupted, and contagious member. Esq. Using th'authority th'Superiour Hath given unto me, I unty this knot, And take from thee the pleasing yoak of heaven: We take from off thy breast this holy crosse, Which thou hast made thy burthen, not thy prop; Thy spurs we spoile thee off, eleaving thy heeles Bare of thy honour, that have kick'd against Our orders precepts: next we reave thy sword, And give thee armelesse to thy enemies, For being foe to goodnesse, and to God, Last, 'bout thy stiff neck, we this halter hang, And leave thee to the mercy of the Court. Val. Invest Miranda. Song. Faire child of vertue, honors bloome That here with burning zeale dost come With joy to ask the white crosse cloak, And yeild unto this pleasing yoake That being yong, vowes chastity, And choosest wilfull poverty; As this flame mounts, so mount thy zeale, thy glory Rise past the Stars, and fix in Heaven thy story. 1. Bish. What crave you gentle sir? Mir. Humble admittance To be a brother of the holy Hospitall Of great Jerusalem. 2. Bish. Breath out your vow. Mir. To heaven and all the bench of Saints above Whose succour I implore t'enhable me, I vow henceforth a chaste life, not to enjoy Any thing proper to my self; obedience To my superiours, whom Religion, And Heaven shall give me: ever to defend The vertuous fame of Ladies, and to oppugne Even unto death the Christian enemy, This do I vow to accomplish. Esq. Who can tell, H'as he made other vow, or promis'd marriage To any one, or is in servitude? All. He's free from all these. 1. Bish. Put on his spurs, and girt him with the sword, The scourge of infidels, and tipes of speed. Buildst thy faith on this Mir. On him that di'd On such a sacred figure, for our sins. 2. Bish. Here, then we fix it on thy left side, for Thy encrease of faith, Christian defence, and service To th'poor, and thus near to thy heart we plant it That thou maist love it even with all thy heart, With thy right hand protect, preserve it whole, For if thou fighting 'gainst heavens enemies Shall fly away, abandoning the crosse The Ensigne of thy holy Generall, With shame thou justly shalt be rob'd of it Chas'd from our company, and cut away As an infectious putrified limb. Mir. I aske no favour. 1 Bish. Then receive the yoak Of him that makes it sweet, and light, in which Thy soule find her eternall rest. Val. Most welcome. All. Welcome, our noble brother. Val. Break up the Court; Mountferrat, though your deeds Conspiring 'gainst the lives of innocents Hath forfeited your own, we will not slaine Our white Crosse with your blood: your doom is then To marry this coagent of your mischiefes Which done, we banish you the continent, If either, after three dayes here be found The hand of Law, layes hold upon your lives. Nor. Away French stallion, now you have a Barbary mare of your own, go leap her, and engender young devillings. Ual. VVe will find something, noble Norandine To quit your merit: so to civill feasts, According to our customes; and all pray The dew of grace, blesse our new Knight to day. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
