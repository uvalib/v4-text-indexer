      <field name="fulltext">? Ãstuat ingens Imo in cordo pudor, mixtoque insania luctu, Et furiis agitatus amor, &amp; conscia virtus. Virg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable JOHN Lord GOWER, Baron of Stittenham.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE Written by a FRIEND. SPOKEN BY Mr. RYAN. When breathing statues mould'ring waste away, And Tombs, unfaithful to their trust, decay; The Muse recalls the suffering Good to fame, Or wakes the prosp'rous villain into shame: To the stern tyrant gives fictitious pow'r, To reign the restless monarch of an hour. Obedient to her call, this night appears Great Herod, rising from a length of years: A name enlarg'd with titles not his own, Servile to mount, and savage on the throne: Whose bold ambition trembling Jewry view'd, In blood of half her royal race imbru'd. But now reviving in the British scene, He looks majestic with a milder mien: His features soften'd with the deep distress Of love, made greatly wretched by excess! From lust of pow'r to jealous fury tost, We shew the tyrant in the lover lost. If no compassion, when his crimes are weigh'd, To his ill-fated fondness must be paid; Yet see, ye Fair! and see with pitying eyes The bright afflicted Mariamne rise. No fancy'd tale! our op'ning scenes disclose Historic truth, and swell with real woes. Awful in virtuous grief the Queen appears, And strong the eloquence of royal tears. Then, let her fate your kind attention raise, Whose perfect charms were but her second praise: Beauty and Virtue your protection claim, Give tears to Beauty, and to Virtue fame.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. PHERORAS, NARBAL, SOHEMUS. Pheroras. The Morning in her richest purple rob'd, Smiles with auspicious lustre on the day, Which brings my royal brother back from Rhodes; Confirm'd in empire by the general voice Of CÃ¦sar and the senate. Narb. This blest day In latest annals shall distinguish'd shine, Sacred to majesty, and dear to love: The same which saw the royal lovers march In nuptial pomp, revolving now restores Herod to Mariamne and his crown. Soh. Fortune at length to merit grows a friend; Or fate ordain'd the happiest stars to shed Their influence on his birth; or sure since Rome, With civil discord rent, so oft hath chang'd Her own great lords, as bleeding conquest rais'd Or sunk the doubtful balance, we had shar'd The same vicissitudes of restless pow'r. Narb. Herod avow'd the dear respect he bore To Anthony, and drop'd a generous tear To grace his ruins. Pher. Yes, and CÃ¦sar sat Pensive and silent; in his anxious breast Perhaps revolving that of all his train, Who proudly wanton in his mounted rays, Gay flutt'ring insects of a summer-noon, How few wou'd bear the wintry storms of fate! At length he smiling rose, receiv'd the crown From Herod's hand, and plac'd it on his brow, Crying, Shine there! for CÃ¦sar cannot find A worthier head to wear thee. Soh. From the grace Of such a victor to receive a crown, With such peculiar attributes of fame, Confers more glory than a chronicle Of scepter'd ancestors. Pher. Narbal, your care Will see due honours to the day discharg'd. Let the shrill trumpet's cheerful note injoin A general feast, and joy with loud acclaim Through all the streets of Solyma resound. Let steams of grateful incense cloud the sky, Till the rich fragrance reach the utmost bounds Of Herod's empire: let each smiling brow Wear peaceful olive, whilst the virgin-choirs Warbling his praise, his paths with flow'rs perfume, Who guards JudÃ¦a with the shield of Rome. [Exit Nar. SCENE II. PHERORAS, SOHEMUS. Sohemus. My Lord, the province you've assign'd agrees With Narbal's talents; none is better form'd To gild the pageant of a gawdy day: He's nobly born, and popularly vain; Rare tinsel-stuff t'adorn a room of state! But in the council, where the publick careâ Pher. In that high sphere you, Sohemus, alone Must ever shine; and may your wisdom raise Your master's fortune, to divide the globe With this new CÃ¦sar; and no longer sway A short precarious sceptre, which must shake With each tempestuous gust that blows from Rome. Soh. With blushes I must hear you call me, wise, When one impassion'd woman can destroy My surest plans, and with a sigh blow down The firmest fabrick of deliberate thought. Heav'ns! that a King consummate for a throne, So wise in council, and so great in arms; Shou'd after nine long years, remain a slave Because his wife is fair! What art thou, Beauty, Whose charm makes sense and valour grow as tame, As a blind turtle? Pher. Is thy wisdom proof Against the blandishments of warm desire? It ill defends thee from Arsinoe's charms: The sullen sweetness of a down-cast eye, A feign'd unkindness, or a just reproach, Breath'd in a sigh, and soften'd with a tear, Wou'd make thy rigid marble melt, like snow On the warm bosom of the youthful spring. Soh. In thoughtless youth, gay nature gives the rein To Love, and bids him urge the full career: But Herod should restrain his head-strong course, Now reason is mature. Pher. He never can; For Mariamne with superior charms Triumphs o'er reason; in her look she bears A paradise of ever-blooming sweets: Fair as the first idea beauty prints On the young lover's soul: a winning grace Guides every gesture, and obsequious Love Attends on all her steps; for, majesty Streams from her eye to each beholder's heart, And checks the transport which her charms inspire: Who wou'd not live her slave!âNor is her mind Form'd with inferior elegance!âBy her, So absolute in every grace, we guess What essence angels have. Soh. Who can admire The brightest angel when his hand unsheaths The vengeful sword, or with dire pestilence Unpeoples nations? If Death sits inthron'd In the soft dimple of a damask cheek, He thence can aim his silent dart as sure, As from the wrinkle of a tyrant's frown; And that's our case! Yet with a lover's eye You view the gay malignance, that will blast Both you and all your friends. Pher. We sure may praise The snake that glitters in her summer pride, And yet beware the sting. Soh. But low in dust Crush the crown'd basilisk, or else she kills Whate'er her eye commands.âYou need, my lord, No clearer light than this, by which to read The purpose of my soul. Pher. Tho' 'tis obscure, It strikes like lightning that with fear confounds The pale night-wanderer, whilst it shews the path. You, Sohemus, have cause to think the Queen Charges the taking of her uncle's head To your advice; and gladly wou'd attone Her kindred blood with yours: revenge still glow, Though hid in treacherous embers, and you'll feel The dire effect, whene'er occasion breathes A gale to waken and foment the flame. But I, unpractis'd in th'intrigues of courts And disciplin'd in camps, will not supply Increase of fuel to these home-bred jars: I hope the King will see them soon supprest; Or care succeeding care will ever tread The circle of his crown. Soh. If to persue The safest measures to secure his throne, Shall irritate the Queen to make me fall A victim to her rage, the conscious pride Of having acted what the King ordain'd, Enter a Messenger with a Letter to Pheroras. Will yet support me. 'Tis not worth my care, Whether the trembling hand of age must shake From the frail glass my last remaining sand; Or fortune break the phial, ere the sum Of half my life is told. Pher. 'Tis from the King: A most unpleasing message for the Queen. Soh. May I, my lord, partake? Pher. The infant Prince Must live an hostage of the league at Rome: CÃ¦sar hath sent a minister of trust, With guards to wait him. This perhaps the King Hath kept conceal'd, that his return might calm Th'afflicted Queen, and soften the surprize. Soh. Names he, my lord, the General to whose care The Prince must be consign'd? Pher. Rome cou'd not chuse For that high charge a nobler delegate, Than my Flaminius; for, a bolder hand Ne'er flew her conquering eagles at their prey. We in the Parthian wars together learn'd The rudiments of arms; the summer sun Hath seen our marches measur'd by his own: In battle so intrepid, that he shew'd An appetite of danger; oft I've heard The weary veterans resting on their spears, Swear by the gods and majesty of Rome, They blush'd with indignation, to behold The garland of the war, by partial fate Transferr'd from theirs, to grace a stripling's browâ But I with Narbal will prevail, t'impart This most ungrateful order to the Queen. [Exit Pher. SCENE III. Salome enters to Sohemus. Salome. I hope, my lord, young Hazeroth's affront Will not pass unresented. Soh. I've dispatch'd A message to the King: th'account I gave, Imported nothing but severest truth; Yet wittiest malice scarce cou'd feign a roll Of keener calumnies. Sal. He mention'd me! Soh. Traduc'd you basely, by th'opprobrious name Of IdumÃ¦an spinster, in degree The third descendant of an heathen slave, Who kept Apollo's temple. Sal. The King's veins Hold the same blood, whatever is the source; And if the wretch survives that vile reproach, The King's a slave indeed. What was your crime? Soh. He said by my sole counsels were destroy'd, All of the royal AsmonÃ¦an race, Whom justice made the victims of the state: Whose injur'd discontented ghosts too long Had cry'd, revenge! but should not cry in vain: Then half unsheath'd his sabre. Sal. That vain boy Believes his near relation to the Queen, Exempts his haughty youth from all restraint. He's Mariamne's echo, and repeats But half her menaces. Soh. What time more fit To put her threats in act, than when the King Flies with redoubled ardor to her arms? Passion improves with absence, and his heart So soft, and passive to the pow'r of love, Will then be vacant only to his Queen. Fortune of late a glorious scene disclos'd, But soon snatch'd back the visionary joy! The blissful hour is pastâCurst, doubly curst Be this boy-emperor, who tamely spar'd The warmest friend that Anthony could boast. Had Herod perish'd by his vengeful sword, I soon had sent (for so he left in charge) His Queen, the worship'd idol of his soul, T'attend him to the shades.âClouds of despair Now terminate our view! Sal. Can you discern No glimmering hope? Though dim, the distant ray May serve to steer our course. Soh. The King will send His son for hostage to reside in Rome. Sal. Were triple thunder vollied at the Queen, It cou'd not rend her bleeding bosom more Than such a message. Soh. At this little spark, Discord may light her ever-burning torch: Th' imperious Queen perhaps will edge her tongue, With keen resentments for her ruin'd race: For 'tis th' infirmity of noblest minds, When ruffled with an unexpected woe, To speak what settled prudence wou'd conceal: As the vex'd ocean working in a storm, Oft brings to light the wrecks which long lay calm, In the dark bosom of the secret deep. From such reproach, his promis'd joy may change To coldness and distrust, perhaps to hate; And their high souls that now, like friendly stars, Mingling their beams in mutual ardor shine, In fiercest opposition then will thwart Each others influence, and divide the court: Then, Mischief, to thy work!â Sal. In me you'll find A sure assistant: Shall Pheroras join? Soh. I'd fly him at the quarry, but I fear He'd check if other game shou'd cross the flight: He scorns dissimulation, nor perceives That nature never meant simplicity A grace to charm in courts: he serves the crown With such a blind disinterested zeal, He's even proud t' obey. Sal. Let him enjoy His cold-complexion'd principles, and fall A traitor to himself. Soh. O Princess, born To bless the world with a long progeny Of future heroes, and renew the strain Of valour, which the softness of your sex Unspirited at first! so great a soul Deserves, and sure is destin'd to a throne! But hark! Sal. The Queen's approaching; she repairs To sacrifice. Soh. 'Tis best we both retire. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. MARIAMNE, ARSINOE. Mariamne. The Princess and her friend were unprepar'd To pay the decencies the day requires: The most unpractis'd in the courtier's art, And they who hate us most, might sure vouchsafe A smooth unmeaning compliment at least. But night-born treason is too tender ey'd, To bear the blaze of dazzling majesty, And seeks the guilty shade. Ar. They're both depriv'd Of your propitious smile; so dire a loss Wou'd cloud the most serene. Mar. That sullen gloom Proceeds not from a conscience of their crimes, Which sues by penitence for royal grace; But argues high contempt: their brows display A banner of defiance, and avow Their trait'rous combination: but I'll quell The tow'ring crest of their presumptuous hate, Or perish in th' attempt. Henceforth forbear All commerce with the Princess, and her train For fear th' infection of example taint Your sound allegiance. Ar. If a single thought Were tinctur'd with disloyalty, this hand Shou'd pierce my heart to drive the rebel out. Your strict command with pleasure I obey; For at the sight of SalomÃ©, my breast Shivers with chilling horror, and revolves The destiny which a ChaldÃ¦an seer Of late foretold: The pious sage had pass'd Full sixty winters in a private cell; His locks were silver'd o'er with reverend white; And on his cheeks appear'd the pale effect Of studious abstinence: His custom was In his small hermitage t' outwatch the moon, To marshal in his schemes the host of heav'n; And from their ruling influence at the birth, Form'd his predictions. As the Princess pass'd, I ask'd him if his foresight cou'd discern The colour of her fate: he answer'd, black! 'Tis black checquer'd with blood! deep in her breast I see the dagger doom'd by heav'ns decree To cut her half-spun thread. Mar. What pow'rful cause Urg'd you to hear a vain diviner tell His waking dreams? Perhaps you went to know What happy star presided o'er the love, Which Sohemus I hear address'd to you: If so, I'll be your oracle; forbear T' enquire the doubtful omens of the sky, And fix your faith on this unerring truth: If your ill-judging choice mis-lead your heart, To meet his passion with an equal flame; Henceforth for ever banish'd from my sight, In exile you shall end an odious life; Attended only in that friendless state By black remorse, which step by step pursues Th' ingrateful and the false. Ar. I long have felt Th' afflicting hand of heav'n, without the guilt Of murmur or complaint; but to be thought False and ingrateful, is too much to bear. Chase that suspicion from your royal mind; Nor cast my blameless innocence a prey To those, who envy your distinguish'd grace, With which I've long been honour'd. Mar. To receive Private addresses from my deadliest foe, A wretch, whose dark infernal arts have wrought The ruin of my race, but ill repays My condescending favour, which vouchsaf'd To lose the stile of subject and of Queen, In friendship's softer name. Ar. While thus I kneel, Imploring heav'n t' attest my spotless faith, May I be fix'd a dreadful monument Of perjur'd guilt, if e'er my bosom gave Reception to his suit! Were he possess'd Of all the sun surveys, and form'd to please With every grace that captivates the soul; And your command concurrent with his love, Shou'd urge me to comply; that hard command, And that alone, I dare to disobey.â No, my dear Roman! nothing can deface Thy image from thy virgin-widow's breast; Th' inviolable band of strong desire Shall ever join our souls! Mar. Dismiss your fears, And let them with my vanish'd doubt expire: But, whence this transport of reviving woe? Recite the series of your fate at large. Ar. When Anthony and CÃ¦sar found the globe Too narrow, to suffice the boundless views Of two such mighty spirits, my virgin-vow Was plighted to a brave Patrician youth, The friend of CÃ¦sar: Anthony proscrib'd The chiefs who sided with his potent foe; And foremost in the tablet my lov'd lord Was doom'd to slaughter: whilst with nuptial joy His palace rung, crowded with friends who came T' attend the bride's arrival, through the gates A troop of cut-throats rushing in, surpriz'd And dragg'd him to his fate!â Mar. In that distress What cou'd you do, and whither did you fly? Ar. At Alexandria then the fatal cause Of Anthony engag'd my father's sword; Thither I fled, and was receiv'd with grace To Cleopatra's train: with her I came To Palestine, where the detested sight Of Anthony so rack'd me, and reviv'd The sad remembrance of my murther'd lord, I begg'd to be dismiss'd. You then receiv'd The fugitive, whom fortune's rage hath made Wretched indeed, but hath not pow'r to make False or ingrateful. Mar. Poor Arsinoe! My favours shall deface the memory Of past afflictions: on a soul secure In native innocence, or grief or joy Shou'd make no deeper prints than air retains; Where fleet alike the vulture and the dove, And leave no trace. Blind fortune that bestows The perishable toys of wealth and pow'r, At random oft resumes them, pleas'd to make An hurricane of life: but the firm mind Safe on exalted virtue reigns sedate, Superior to the giddy whirls of fate. [Exeunt. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. NARBAL, FLAMINIUS. Narbal. The Queen will see you, Sir; a just regard To CÃ¦sar's friendship is so sacred here, That though on this high jubilee the court Suspends all state-affairs, the Queen vouchsafes T' admit your message to her royal ear. Fla. Th' ambassadors of Rome never demand Admission more than once; your King defers His entry 'till the Queen shall execute What CÃ¦sar's will requires. Nar. That cause alone Wou'd urge our prompt compliance; for the King Makes Love th' impatient register of time: In his account each moment seems an age, That keeps him from his Mariamne's arms; Who well deserves such passion. Fla. Distant fame Hath pictur'd all her graces on my mind: Perhaps you've heard of Dellius. Nar. What! the friend Of Anthony? Fla. His qualities disgrace The name of friend; but in his softer hours He lik'd him for his elegance of taste In luxury and love. I heard him tell, How once when Anthony in amorous pomp, With Cleopatra sail'd along the Nile, To grieve the proud Egyptian, he produc'd A miniature of Mariamne's face. Nar. And what said Anthony? Fla. With vast surprize He view'd each lineament, but yet forbore To praise or blame it, which he knew the Queen Wou'd soon interpret love; but softly sigh'd, And slipt it in his bosom. Strait her cheeks Glow'd with an angry blush, which faded soon, And left them lilly-pale: breathless and faint She then reclin'd her head, and from his breast Snatch'd what she fear'd might lie too near his heart. With amorous reluctance whilst he strove To gain the ravish'd prize, she let it fall (More by design than chance) into the Nile: He springing up to catch it, half o'er-set The gilded barge; and with a sterner brow, And haughtier tone, than e'er she knew before, He cry'd, your river is too well repaid, For all the wealth you ow'd.â [A Messenger enters to Narbal. Mess. Pheroras, Sir, Desires to see the Roman General. Nar. Sir, I'll conduct you. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Enter Sohemus and the High-Priest. Sohemus. But the human mind, When 'tis divorc'd from matter, cannot pierce The distant cloud of dark futurity. You sleep not sound, my lord! Old age depress'd With melancholly damps, oft dwindles down To second infancy, and then renews Its cradle-dreams; which superstitious fear Makes sacred with the venerable names Of vision, or of prophecy; devis'd To cheat the vulgar, and too oft employ'd To cover disaffection to the state. H. Pr. I have, my lord, no craving appetites To glut with gain or titles; I've attain'd The highest name my order can receive. I bear no symptoms of a feav'rish soul, Which turbulent with guilt, aspires t' embroil The state with trait'rous fiction: You may think, I who commend my self, have brib'd a fool To be my herald; yet, a modest man, T' oppose the darts of calumny, may wear His innocence in sight; a safer shield Than adamant or gold. Soh. Your innocence! Did you not talk of omens, which forbode Th' impending wrath of heav'n, to blast the day Which re-instates our monarch on his throne? H. Pr. I did, my lord, and will affirm I sawâ Laugh when you've heard me out. Soh. Well, pray proceed! H. Pr. I walk'd this morning in my palmy grove, Where oft to contemplation I devote My earliest hours: the sun new-rising cheer'd The face of nature with a purple smile; My spirits ran as brisk careers of life, As ever in the careless prime of youth: When issuing sudden from the bowry shade, A beauteous form appear'd, and gliding slow, Approach'd me with a soft dejected air; Then cry'd, I liv'd the brother of your Queen; And gave a piteous groan! Soh. Aristobulus? H. Pr. The same, I knew him well. Soh. Ha!âwhat?âwhat more?â Why, he was drown'd, you knowâCou'd I prevent What heav'n fore-doom'd? My good lord, did he say That I was accessary? Why to me This message from the unapparent shades? SpeakâspeakâI'll hear it. H. Pr. In his hand he wav'd An airy streamer, like a sable shrowd, And thus went on: If dire designs prevail, Before yond' east displays another dawn, My sister must exchange her robes of state For such a weed as this; by wicked arts Betray'd, and in the summer of her days Cut off by bloody hands! with her will end The glories of our AsmonÃ¦an line! Tell what I say to Sohemus alone; Bid him desist. Soh. I!âwhat?â H. Pr. He said no more, But vanish'd from my view. Soh. 'Tis best, my lord, To let such shadows fleet neglected by: They argue perturbation in the brain, Caus'd by black humours; a few hours will prove That mimic fancy mock'd your dazzl'd sight, With images of air. H. Pr. Whate'er they prove, I feel my bosom lighter. [Exit H. Pr. Soh. Thou hast laid A gauling weight on mine! SCENE III. Salome enters to Sohemus. Salome. How now, my Lord! What means this pale confusion in your face! What makes your hair stand bristling, and your eyes With gloomy horror glare! Soh. We cheat the world With florid outside 'till we meet surprize; Then conscience, working inward like a mole, Crumbles the surface, and reveals the dirt From which our actions spring. Sal. My lord, recall Your wandering reason. Soh. 'Tis in vain to boast That reason o'er the passions holds the rein, When quite unman'd with such a taleâ Sal. What tale? I met th' High Priest, hath he unfolded ought That strikes with this amazement? Soh. He reports A message from the visionary shade Of young AristobÃºlus; him! who claim'd By lineal right the crown which Herod wears: To disembroil the title, whilst he bath'd I plung'd him 'till the stifling element Had quench'd the lamp of life, and charg'd the crime On faultless destiny!âWhat makes you smile? Sal. To see a dotard's fiction, or his dream, A legend, such as nurseries amuse A froward child with, have as strong effect As plain authentic truth! I've heard you prove By clearest reason, that when death resolves To its first principles the human frame; That subtile vapour then, the boasted soul, Mingles with common air. Soh. 'Tis not the faith Of such fantastick forms that quells me thus; Sudden remorse for murther'd innocence Wither'd my resolution. Sal. But revenge Reviving warmth and spirit will infuse, And make the drooping branches flourish fair, Renew'd in second spring. Here Sameas comes, Whom art and nature exquisitely form For glorious mischief; him we must secure. SCENE IV. SALOME, SOHEMUS, SAMEAS. Salome. Sameas, I'm pleas'd your merits are preferr'd To bear the royal cup; Pheroras long Pleaded in vain for Mariamne's grace. Sam. If to her grace I ow'd this vital air, I'd choak my self with generous disdain, Rather than breathe it: from Pheroras' suit I date my fortunes, and to him devote Life, conscience, honour. Soh. Gratitude is rare! Most, after favours are conferr'd, profess Deep sense of obligation; but when prov'd In points of nicest moment, have recourse To conscience, honour, and such trivial phrase, T' excuse defect of duty to their friend: But such a pure, resign'd, implicit zeal, Excites my wonder, and transcends my praise. Sam. Pheroras said, my lord, he'd recommend To you my poor affairs. Soh. Doubt not my care; Read here thy lot. [Pulls out his Tablets. Sam. Make Sameas chamberlainâ How can I e'er discharge so vast a debt Of gratitude! Soh. How! Should affairs require Thy hand, it wou'd not shrink to cut a throat? Sam. I've such a strong antipathy to blood I ne'er could sacrifice: but my revenge Works a more secret, and a safer way. No poisonous herbs, which various climes produce, No venom of the mine, nor reptile 'scapes My curious observation: I extract Their several essences, and know their pow'rs, And times of operation. Soh. To what use!â Had I a dog to be dispatch'dâ Sam. My art Delights in nobler quarry. Soh. Is it stanch? Sam. Point out the game, my lord, you'll find I dare Do more, than most dare think. Soh. Then swearâ Sal. Defer T' impart your orders 'till the King's arriv'd; And meet before the banquet. Sam. What your will Enjoins, my duty binds me to perform. Soh. Proud Queen! the last decisive hour draws on, Destin'd to crown our hope, and end our care: Aided by this brave friend, whose soul is steel'd With dauntless resolution, though the ghosts Of all her race rise grinning from the tomb, And in their cause auxiliar furies join; Intrepid we'll persue our bold career; Pitch the sure toils, and rouze the fated deer. [Exeunt. SCENE V. MARIAMNE, NARBAL, ARSINOE. Mariamne. His offspring mortgag'd to redeem his crown!â The wild Arabians who delight in blood, Who live promiscuous, and without restraint Of laws or manners propagate their kind, With yerning passion yet preserve their young: Nature on their unpolish'd marble prints Much tenderer sentiments, than some can boast Who call them barbarous. Nar. In the sons of Kings. The country claims a right; and to preserve The quiet, and the glory of your realm, The King complies with CÃ¦sar, and will send The dearest pledge to firm his royal faith. Mar. Hard fate of greatness, if it thus excludes A mother's interest in the babe she bore! Kings to their country owe their dearest care In council or in arms; let that suffice: The choicest blessings of indulgent heav'n, Their children, are reserv'd a private right, To soften and support their publick toils. But, send the Prince to Rome! which still ferments With fierce intestine factions, ever known To sheath, but not to lay the sword aside: I cannot bear it!âNow, the ball of pow'r, Which hath been bandy'd long from side to side, Is grasp'd by CÃ¦sar: soon, superior force May wrest it from his hand: who'll then adhere To CÃ¦sar's cause? Will Herod?âHe, be sure, Wou'd plan new measures to preserve the crown: And his desertion, doubtless, wou'd provoke CÃ¦sar to punish in extreme revenge, Th' offending father in the guiltless son. Nar. The blood of Julius is aton'd; and Rome, Like a tir'd lioness which long has stood The hunter's spear, lies quiet in her den To heal her wounds: CÃ¦sar himself aspires, With all his conquests, only to be styl'd His country's father; and the senate bears The same pacific temper.âBut, suppose Another Brutus rouze another war, And Tyber shine again with civil arms: Though Herod then should draw the sword, and turn The point on CÃ¦sar; yet, the sacred laws Of empires, wou'd preserve the Prince's life Inviolably safe. Mar. But, were revenge Employ'd (as sure it wou'd) t' expound those laws; Then, what bold casuist would appear, t' oppose The sense of CÃ¦sar's legions? Wrong and right In this bad age are measur'd by success: The blackest crime from Fortune's golden light Receives a beauteous gloss.âBut, grant him safe, As in the circle of his mother's arms: Rome may pervert his infant age to kneel Before her idol-shrines, and from our law Apostatize to worship fabled gods: And though I hold his life and safety dear, Far dearer than my own, I'd see him cast Amidst her amphitheatre a prey; Mangled, and quiv'ring in the famish'd jaws Of savages, much rather than behold His body at her heathen altars bow'd, In impious adoration. Nar. Leave th' event To heav'n's high care! The King must be obey'd. If you contest the terms, to which his crown And honour stand engag'd, the vain attempt Might only serve to lessen that excess Of dear affection, which he bears you now. Then Sohemus, our prime state-engineer, Might see his arts succeed beyond his hope, T' atchieve your fall, and make this beauteous pile A heap of mighty ruin! Mar. Cou'd you feel The strong emotions of a mother's woe, When ravish'd from her lov'd-one, who hath liv'd Most in her sight, and ever in her soul: Not all the wounds which Fortune is impow'r'd T' inflict, nor instant death, wou'd move your mind Amid his dangers to regard your own. Ev'n life, that dear ennobling gift of heav'n, Which in the order of creation, ranks The palest glow-worm's animated ray, Above the brightest star, with me will lose Its boasted value when I lose my child. With him I truly liv'd; his presence crown'd The day with pleasure, and the night with peace. Then, breath consum'd in sighs will not deserve The name of life! These roofs shall only sound With mournful accents, sad as murm'ring winds, Which through the clefts of ruin'd cloisters roar. Such musick best will please the mother's ear, If in a distant land, her tender son Must weep the rigor of a foreign lord, With no kind friend to pity or revenge The wrongs he there sustains! Nar. I'll wait the Prince, To guard his helpless age, and share his fate: And for a pledge of constant faith, receive (Though much unequal, yet of dearest price To him who gives it!) for a pledge receive Those precious legacies which that bright saint, My dying wife bequeath'd me!âIf the Prince Shall feel th' effects of violence or fraud; If e'er I cease with duteous care to shield From guilt his manners, from reproach his fame; Or fail to banish from his pensive breast Each anxious thought, and cherish gentle joys; Slay both my sons! Mar. Then go, Arsinoe, go,â Hither conduct the Prince. [Ar. Exit. SCENE VI. MARIAMNE, NARBAL. Mariamne. Oh happiness! Thou gawdy bubble, which deludes the grasp, Whene'er we strive to keep thee most secure. Have I been fond of Fortune's faithless smile, Cruel, disdainful, to deserve this doom? Did e'er I suffer pride to bar my ear Against the widow's cry? Did e'er I view The weeping orphan's anguish, and with-hold The hand of liberal Mercy from their woes? Or did I with uncharitable scorn Ever upbraid the childless womb; or wish The wrathful blast of heav'n t' attaint the fruit Of my most deadly foe?âWhence then to me This undeserv'd distress? Why must I bear So deep a wound in such a tender part? More wretched than the meanest of my sex, Who call me Queen! they lose the cares of life, Amid the blessings of a dear increase; A bliss deny'd to me! Nar. When foreign foes Are quell'd by CÃ¦sar, and the provinces Avow their homage to the laws of Rome, And with consummate peace his arms are crown'd; The Prince will be restor'd; and in exchange Some of our noblest youth will be receiv'd For hostages of friendship. Mar. That exchange Will come too late to bless my longing eyes: They'll first be clos'd in death! a thousand ills Rise in black views to my divining soul! [Arsinoe enters with the Prince. And must I lose thee?âOh!âthou sweetest pledge Of heaven's indulgence to a mother's pray'r! Must the sole comfort of my cares become The cause of endless grief? alas! no more Must I with tender transport clasp thee thus! No more must these desiring eyes be fix'd In silent joy, with gazing on thy charms!â Arsinoe, oh! support meâI've a son To think on only, and to pay a tear For every wounding thought! O Narbalânow Obey the King, by whom the dearer names Of husband, and of father are forgot! Obey the King! let the rude hand of pow'r Tear from my breast the blossom of my joysâ Yet, let me bless himâAll thy wants of me May pitying Angels with their aid supply! Waft all thy pray'rs to heav'n! which heav'n approve, And crown with blessings of eternal love! [Exeunt. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. FLAMINIUS, NARBAL. Flaminius. Unhappy Queen! 'till now I never griev'd T' obey my emperor. Nar. A while she stood Transform'd by grief to marble, and appear'd Her own pale monument; but when she breath'd The secret anguish of her wounded soul; So moving were the plaints! they wou'd have sooth'd The stooping falcon to suspend his flight, And spare his morning prey: thus nature soon Exhausted, spiritless, had need of art To respite, or asswage her troubled thoughts: Then her physicians with the opiate charm Of gentle sleep, her fainting senses bound, And hush'd the warring passions into peace. Fla. Give me, ye gods, the harmony of war, The trumpet's clangor, and the clash of arms; That consort animates the glowing breast To rush on death; but when our ear is pierc'd With the sad notes which mournful beauty yields; Our manhood melts in sympathizing tears. Nar. Heav'ns! Is it just that Mariamne's fate Claims the sad tribute of a tender tear? She! she! whose gentle goodness strives to chase Afflictions from mankind. I've seen her weep, When the fierce hounds have bay'd the panting stag, 'Till the big drops roll'd from his pleading eyes; And none dar'd let the fatal javelin fly, Before she left the field.

Gods!â'tis not possible!âthey've only form'd Those beauties in the same celestial moldâ Exact similitude of shape and air! Nar. What may this mean, Flaminius? Ar. Do I wake? Or does deluding fancy lead me still In new fantastick labyrinths of bliss?â Fla. The face, and harmony of voice the same! Nar. You're lost in admiration and surprize: Reveal the cause. Fla. Oh, Sir,âI once was blest With such a lovely object of my flame! Beauty and goodness in her heav'nly form Held equal empire; Oh!â Nar. What cruel fate Sever'd your hearts, so tender and so true, That still the wound bleeds fresh? Fla. The violence Of civil discord snatch'd her from my arms: But the last pang of death alone hath pow'r To tear the beauteous image from my breast! She liv'd the grace of Cleopatra's court, And shar'd her fall!âAs her high merits claim'd My earliest love, to her I'll pay my last: My passion for the sex expir'd, and lies In dear Hortensia's tomb!

In this high mantling tide of grief and rage, Sure when the King arrives, her cold disdain Will damp the glowing ardor of his soul. Soh. Fear not a calm! The cloud will now collect More vapours still, to give a nobler burst, And make her ruin sure. When vulgar minds Despond, they drop beneath the stroke of fate, With no more tumult than autumnal leaves Forsake the sapless bough: But majesty With noise, and pompous horror rushes down As if the violence of nature tore A planet from its orb. SCENE IV. [To them Pheroras enters.] Pheroras. The pomp of Kings At their triumphal entries, moving slow To warlike symphonies, and clashing arms; When from the field, with bloody laurels crown'd, They come victorious, gives a mingled joy: For Pity, when the Captive train appears, Oft with a silent pensive gloom obscures The lustre of the triumph. But no cloud. Saddens this festival: From the white tow'r I heard with rapture how the loyal tribes, In mighty confluence hail'd the King's return; So long! so loud! that floating on the sound, The bird of heaviest wing with ease had soar'd, Beyond the tow'ring eagle's utmost flight, Up-born by gales of joy. [Flourish. Soh. My lord, the King!â SCENE V. [Herod passeth over the stage with attendants, &amp;c. they all kneel.] Pheroras. O King for ever live! the dear defence, And grace of Palestine. Sal. May this blest day Tincture with happiness, and bright renown, All your succeeding years! Soh. And sure there's none, To whom this day can give sincerer joy, Than to your faithful Sohemus; who kneels To give this seal of delegated power Back to your royal hand. Her. Let all who sigh In gloomy dungeons prest with gauling chains, Shake off their bondage; and conspire to tune The wholesome breath of heav'n to songs of praise. Tell them they owe their freedom to the Queen: Her temper is compassionate and kind, As guardian angels are: but I! constrain'd By the sad exigence of state, have torn Our tender off-spring from her fond embrace; And heap'd afflictions on the brightest head, That ever wore a crown! Pher. But your approach Will sooth her grief, and soften the surprize. Her. I! I! am the sole cause of all her grief: Ambition rushing forward, hath disturb'd My sweetest fountain of domestick bliss! It promis'd scepters, but hath fill'd my grasp With gilded thorns! wanting my Queen, the court Appears as lonesome as the dreary waste, Where pestilence and famine hand in hand Have lately reign'd: but Mariamne's smiles Diffusive of their good, around her cast On all the shining circle beams of joy; When from the wars she welcom'd my return, With tears of tender transport in her eyes. Such oft our meetings were; but, dismal change! The fair offended seems to shun me now: How shall I calm the tempest of her Soul! [Exeunt. SCENE VI. The Scene opening discovers Mariamne asleep, and Arsinoe attending; Herod enters, and goes to the Queen; then comes with Arsinoe to the fore part of the Stage. Herod. I kiss'd her softly, and she gave a sigh! Tears make her cheek feel like a damask rose, Wet with cold ev'ning dew. Ars. Sleep ill performs His gentle office when constrain'd by Art: Her sudden starts, and broken murmurs shew The discomposure of unpleasing dreams. Her. Musick shall wake her: That hath pow'r to charm Pale sickness, and avert the stings of pain: But ever on the mind the sure effects Are most conspicuous, where the varied notes Can raise or quel our passions, and becalm In sweet oblivion the too wakeful sense Of grief or love; and print a dimpled smile On the green bloodless cheek of dumb Despair. Such pow'rful strains bid Harmony resound: Such as good spirits are suppos'd to sing O'er saints, while death dissolves the union-band, And frees them from the fretful dream of life. [Ex. Ar. Here will I watch the day-break of her eyes; O! may they dart warm rays of cordial love, And wake to peace and joy! [Soft musick is heard behind the Scenes: Arsinoe returns to Herod, who stands looking on Mariamne: after the Musick is ceas'd she begins to speak.] Mar. Good Angels guard me!â Murther attaints not meâ Her. Ah, gentle soul!â Mar. The man of blood is justly doom'd to bleed, I ne'er shed anyâWhen I was a child I kill'd a linnet, but indeed I wept; Heav'n visits not for that.âO! 'tis my lord!â He's poison'd! dead! dead!âand each manly grace Cover'd with purple spotsâ Her. These frightful dreams With their fantastick imag'ry amaze The mind, as much as the most hideous form Of real horror. Ars. Sir, she wakes. Mar. The King! Her. My dearest Queen!âThe fairest and the best That ever bore the name! Mar. I'm chang'd of late, Alas! much chang'dâ Her. No, thou art still the same; The same bright shrine where virtue dwells, to charm Those who contemn her most. Mar. Cou'd I have charm'd Ambition from your breast, I had not mourn'd The dearest object of maternal love, Torn from this bleeding heart; where he possess'd So large a space, that fortune is too poor With all her vast variety of joys, To fill the gloomy void!âMy life is spun At least this day too long, which shews you chang'd, And from a loving lord grown most unkind! Her. Unkind!âYour fancy cannot form a wish, But I shou'd crown it; and reproach my heart, For having not prevented your request. Was ever soul so sensible of love, As mine hath been for you? and who but you Cou'd e'er deserve such love? I never err'd, Witness ye Heavens! and with your thunder rend This heart if e'er it err'd! if e'er I stain'd The purity of passion, or in thought Wander'd from Mariamne. Mar. In your breast I cou'd have spar'd your son a little space; But sure you lov'd him not! Her. What! am I form'd Like monumental marbles, and receive The name of father from the sculptor's art, And features of the rock? Am I so dead To the sweet cares that fathers ought to feel?â An old man's rapture when he first beholds A new-born heir, when years of fruitless hope Have led him childless to the verge of life; Cannot surpass those dear paternal joys, Which my fond bosom from my son receiv'd. Mar. Yet you resign'd him for a prey to Rome, With less reluctance!â Her. CÃ¦sar would allow Of no alternate to preserve our crown. Suppliant I long intreated him, to name What other test of sacred faith he pleas'd; But frowning with a victor's haughty air, He pointed to a picture on the wall; Whose silent eloquence too plainly spoke His fix'd resolve against the suit I urg'd. Mar. What Picture? Her. Perseus led in chains through Rome: Where the sad fate of Macedon appear'd Prophetic of our own, shou'd we like her Boast a false vigor, and provoke the rage Of Rome, unequal to sustain her arms. There fancy figur'd to my mournful eyes, The wealth of Palestine in chargers pil'd: Our shields and spears on moving trophies hung, Ingloriously revers'd: and then succeed Nobles, and matrons, with a virgin train, In long procession through th'unpitying crowd: But oh! what stings of grief and horror pierc'd My agonizing heart, when there I view'd A royal capive, far transcending all In matchless beauty, and majestic woe, Her form resembling thine! On her a throng Of gay Patricians fix'd their wond'ring eyes, Enamour'd; and with rival passion strove, Who first shou'd prostrate to his brutal joys Her unpolluted charms. Thy future doom Thus pictur'd to my view, so wrap'd my soul In clouds of deep despair, I strait comply'd To give the filial pledge. Mar. Just heav'n, exact With strict account, from CÃ¦sar's rigid heart A pang, for every pang that tortures mine! May public discord and domestic jars Make his short reign a stormy winter's day! And may his children with dishonest shame Redden his hoary cheek; and wound his soul With keener anguish than their mother bore Amid her fiercest throws! Her. Leave him t'enjoy The destiny alloted, and restrain Your passionate complaints, which but foment A grief much greater than the cause requires. Mar. Your strange insensibility foments My wonder more: what grief's more rational, Or what can equal mine, whose darling hope Is ravish'd in the tender dawn of life By savages? A miscreant haughty race! Who with hereditary hate persue The name of monarch; and from us dissent In manners, habit, speech, religion, laws. There my poor infant, like a beauteous flow'r Transplanted to a cold unfriendly soil, Must droop neglected! What protecting hand Will there with tender delicacy guard His op'ning bloom? Ah, none!âHe there must live A friendless exile; he! whose menial train Nobles were proud to grace, and all conspir'd To make his hours in downy circles dance, And sooth his soul to joy, must now indureâ Alas! what not indure?â Her. The Roman name Is far renown'd for all the softer arts Which polish life, and with ennobling grace Illustrate virtue. Wou'd you but attend, The voice of reason dictates to our choice, The deed which strong necessity constrains. What court but that of Rome cou'd form his mind By surest maxims, e're he mounts the throne, To guide the reins of empire?âThus of old, Philip from his dejected realm was sent, A tender hostage to the Theban state: Where founding his high virtue on the plan Of great Epaminondas, he reveng'd The wrongs of Macedon; and soon reduc'd More than a hundred potentates. Mar. The deeds Of my heroick ancestors might fire My son, t'ascend the laurel'd heights of fame, Without a Roman guide. If he persues With equal steps the glorious paths they trod; Like them he'll awe the nations round, and reign Honour'd in peace, and terrible in war. Were he of growth in radiant steel to lead The files of war, against his country's foe; No soft emasculating tear shou'd stain The lustre of his arms: I'd gird the sword On the young warrior's thigh, and send him forth, Resolv'd to conquer in so just a cause, Or dauntless in her dear defence to fall. Her. Why then regret you with this rage of grief, The happier triumphs of auspicious peace Which he bestows? For none but he had pow'r T'avert the furies of invasive war: For that sole pledge, JudÃ¦a smiles to see Soft quiet spreading wide her turtle-wings O'er all her bounds; and him we both must own The guardian of our crown. Mar. The crown is bought Far, far too dear, with such a precious bribe! Preserv'd by mean submission to the frown Of alien states, what's he who wears it more Than a vain idol of imperial pow'r, Which moves subservient to the master-hand, No freedom left to will? Had CÃ¦sar urg'd This haughty mandate, when the realm obey'd The founders of my AsmonÃ¦an race; They wou'd have plum'd his eagles on the field! Her. I neither envy, nor defame the dead; Peace to their honour'd shades! Nor shou'd you praise. Their actions, only in reproach to mine; That's too severe.âWhen they the sceptre sway'd, Rome had not stretch'd the terror of her arms, From far Euphrates and the conquer'd east, To Lusitania and th'Atlantic main. If they reign'd now, their prudence wou'd inspire The same pacific counsels I pursue; Since her vast pow'r makes all resistance vain: Vain as the fury which a wintry storm Dischargeth on the sea, whose waves enjoy Th'impetuous ruin of the rushing clouds, And swell with prouder state.âAlas! thy breast Still heaves with sighs! Forbear!âMy heart repays Each tear with drops of blood!âProvoke not heav'n, By violating with superfluous grief, The brightest image of it self imprest On thy resembling graces. Mar. Though my tears Equal'd the dew-drops of the weeping morn, My fate requires them all!âHis infant charms Sweetly supply'd your absence, and beguil'd My widow'd hours, whene'er the voice of war Call'd you to distant camps!â Her. If ev'ry star Contain'd a golden world, and bounteous heav'n Wou'd make me lord of all, I'd not forsake My Mariamne, to receive the boon. My absence never shall afflict thee more. The blaze of glory whose deluding light Mis-led me from thy arms, shall now be lost In love's superior flame: Pheroras, train'd In Roman camps, and perfected in arms, Shall have the conduct of our future wars. And now, thou dearest treasure of my soul! Prepare with every smiling grace t'adorn The festival; and let victorious joy Chase every black idea from thy mind: For ever banish from thy gentle breast All cares, except the pleasing cares of love! Be this the prelude of eternal peace, And mutual passion with our years increase! [Exeunt. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. SOHEMUS, SALOME. Sohemus. Restrain this flood of unavailing tears! For if they flow for pity or remorse, They flow in vain. In distant ages past Pity dy'd young; of grief, they say, to see An eagle wreak his malice on a wren. If she were yet on earth, where cou'd she find A nobler palace than a brother's breast? But there you found her not; the more's the shame! Since pity's fled to heav'n, we'll send remorse To howl in hell; it has no business here!â But if these tears flow from the nobler source Of indignation, and the generous shame Of injur'd merit; if they relish strong The bitterness of soul from which they stream; O, let increasing fury swell the tide, Ev'n whilst we put in act our great revenge! So weeps the storm, while the devouring waves Close o'er the wrecks it made. Sal. Had I not seen His cheek discolour'd, when his passion foam'd; And heard him thunder threats of instant death To me, and all whose generous spirits scorn To bear th' oppression of his haughty Queen; I never had believ'd my self so lost To his affection. Soh. Lost! he lov'd you not; Ambition is the mistress of his soul; The Queen herself holds but the second place: To please that mistress, he condemn'd to die All the wife's kindred; now, to please the wife, His own must bleed: greatness hath made him deaf To nature's voice, ev'n while she pleads for you. Sal. The wretch who in an earthquake sees the ground Heave like a swelling wave, before it gapes To sink him to the centre, stands as safe, As I so near the tyrant! Soh. In his court, On these sad terms at best you but enjoy A prison of state. When rival princes laid Their sceptres at your feet, the Queen prevail'd To have each honourable suit refus'd. Sal. Revenge no more shall grovel in the dark, But fan with dragon-wings the face of day; Oppose her course who can! It is resolv'dâ Soh. Once Mariamne was the destin'd prey; But since her charms enthrall the King as fast, As in the freshness of her bridal love, They both shall die. Sal. Yes, both; and all their friends At once descending crowd the gates of night: For self-defence will sanctify the deed: And fame, th'officious herald of success, Will blazon our renown; and though we fail, 'Tis great to dare. Soh. When those proud cedars fall, Their spreading ruin will destroy the shrubs Which flourish in their shade.âAnd lo, the man! Whom fate selects t' atchieve her high decree. SCENE II. [To them Sameas enters.] Salome. This diamond, Sameas, but prepares the way For future favours. [Gives him a Jewel. Sam. Your auspicious smiles, Madam, o'er-pay my service. Soh. Sameas wait A while in my apartment, and I come T' instruct you further to deserve her grace. [Exit Sam. SCENE III. Salome. The diamond which I gave him is the Queen's; Arsinoe lent it, for the jeweller To model one for me. Soh. It sure will prove Of dearest value now: I was amaz'd To see you give an earnest of such price, To one whose genuine malice renders vice Its own reward, and kills for killing sake. Sal. The wretch is avaritious; we must feed That appetite of wealth, which urg'd him first To trade in death. Soh. How urg'd? Sal. Along the shore He walk'd one ev'ning, when the clamorous rage Of tempests wreck'd a ship: the crew were sunk, The master only reach'd the neighb'ring strand, Born by a floating fragment; but so weak With combating the storm, his tongue had lost The faculty of speech, and yet for aid He faintly wav'd his hand, on which he wore A fatal jewel. Sameas quickly charm'd Both by its size and lustre, with a look Of pity, stoop'd to take him by the hand; Then cut the finger off to gain the ring, And plung'd him back to perish in the waves; Crying, go dive for more.âI've heard him boast Of this adventure. Soh. He's a very fiend! If we succeed, he shall not live an hour, In mercy to our selves: his poisoning art In time wou'd taint the vital breath of spring; And spread contagion with each spicy gale.â [A Messenger enters. Mess. Lord Hazeroth releas'd, demands to see Your lordship.â [Exit. Soh. Me? Sal. Receive him; I retire. [Exit Sal. SCENE IV. HAZEROTH, SOHEMUS. Hazeroth. The King, I thank his grace! vouchsafes me leave To breath a freer air, than what was judg'd Fit for my constitution; though the terms Of freedom are severe. Soh. What terms, my lord? Haz. To sue for reconcilement, and receive In sacred friendship that injurious hand, Which coop'd me, like a starling in a cage: You know the man! Soh. My lord, the man you mean Bears such devotion to your high descent; That 'tis the favourite passion of his soul, To live your humblest servantâ Haz. And his tongue Distills court-honey, while his heart o'er-flows With quintessence of gall! Soh. That character, My lord, with great submission I disown: You hear the dictates of an honest heart, That's warm in all your interests. Haz. You confin'd My person, like a felon's to promote My interest! statesmen have peculiar arts! They're so mysterious, few can apprehend The favours they confer! Soh. The crime deserv'd Severer penance than the King enjoin'd. Haz. I thank your majesty! Soh. I then, my lord, Bore th' express image of the sov'reign pow'r; And that's allow'd to dignify the coin, However mean the metal. Me you brav'd, With most unseemly licence; but th' affront Wounded the King: and his prerogative Reveng'd itself, not me. Haz. Whene'er the spleen And pride of Tools in office are chastis'd; The King's affronted!âis the general cry, From those who lord it in the Sanhedrim, To him who drives the camels! Soh. When, my lord, Your shining merits meet their just reward; Distinguish'd with some honourable post, As soon they must; you'll own my doctrine sound. Nothing but duty to preserve the crown In its full lustre, 'till the King return'd, Cou'd urge me to exert an act of pow'r On you, my lord, whose qualities adorn Your royal lineage: but, the noblest fruits Have too much tartness, 'till the mellowing year Digests their eager juices. Haz. Youth is apt T' incur such indiscretions, as the King Forgave in me, and you, my lord, forget: Our friendship here begins. Soh. May death alone Dissolve the honour'd tie! [Ex. Haz.] O flattery! How soon thy smooth insinuating oil Supples the toughest fool! [Exit Soh. SCENE V. MARIAMNE, ARSINOE. Mariamne. With less regret I can support your absence, since my son Will find so kind a guardian, to discharge The dear engagements that a mother owes: We differ but in name. Ar. The prince shall be The tender object of my hourly care: Happy! that fate reserves it in my pow'r, T' express the sense my grateful heart retains Of royal favour. Mar. Nature form'd our sex For soft endearing offices: she starts, When pity is depos'd, and cruel pride Usurps the vacant throne. Alas! you see How deep the darts of fortune wound the great, Though clad in golden armour. Were you sway'd By favours in reversion, which allure Ev'n vulgar souls to succour the distress'd; Int'rest wou'd tell you, that your darling son May want a friend; and then, my tender plant In the full verdure of his royal growth, May recompense your kind protecting care, And shield him from a storm.âIs the time fix'd For your departure? Ar. Sohemus intends T' obtain the royal mandate, to delay My journey with my lord: then all my joys, Like the false colours of the show'ry bow, Will fade in tears! Mar. The politician's art Must so revenge his disappointed love? His spider-constitution wou'd dissolve In its own venom, if he shou'd forbear To spin it off in crafty dark intrigues; Pernicious to my peace, and those I love. Before the banquet, you shall quit the court; Then let Flaminius vindicate his claim. And by this prompt compliance with your lord, Form all your future conduct; and affect The pow'r to please, and not to give him pain: For wedded love is founded on esteem, Which the fair merits of the mind engage: For those are charms that never can decay; But time, which gives new whiteness to the swan, Improves their lustre. Ar. None of humane race Wou'd live more happy, cou'd we but transcribe The bright example of a royal pair: If my Flaminius ever wou'd reward My constant ardor, with an equal flame; Engag'd by such endearing decencies, As make the lamp of love in Herod's breast To burn so bright, and never to consume. Mar. Beware of flatt'ry! 'tis a flow'ry weed, Which oft offends the very idol-vice, Whose shrine it would perfume. Ar. But rigid truth Turns praise to incense, which the nicest sense Of virtue may receive.âIn your soft chains Your captive lord is led from joy to joy: Days, months, and years, in circling raptures rowl, And each advancing hour outshines the past. None, none but he can such a treasure boast, Rich in perfections, able to suffice His avarice of love! Mar. When hearts are join'd In virtuous union, love's impartial beams Gild the low cottage of the faithful swain With equal warmth, as when he darts his fires On canopies of state. Ar. The danger's fled, And now I may disclose a stronger proof Of Herod's passion, than the long records Of love contain. Mar. What proof?âa dangerous proof, Conceal'd from me! Ar. When CÃ¦sar's mounted beams Prevail'd o'er Anthony's inferior star; He thought the victor, in severe revenge, Would take both life and crown: his life and crown Were toys beneath his care; but oh! what pangs He felt, reflecting that your death alone Cou'd save your beauties to himself entire! How vast a passion his, who could not bear A rival in the grave! Mar. How! Did the king To the red hand of slaughter doom the breast Of once-lov'd Mariamne?âGave command This breast shou'd bleed, where never dwelt a thought Disloyal or unkind!âHad other lips Breath'd forth this fatal truth, it would appear The dictate of inventive spleen, disclos'd To violate my peace: But you're sincere; And knowing that, I know my self undone! Ar. O, that I had been born like nature's mutes, That swim the silent deep!âBelieve me false; Or else, with me, believe the King's decree A test of wondrous love, and dear esteem! Mar. Love, and esteem!â Ar. Alas! rekindling rage Glows on your cheek, and sparkles in your eyes:â Think me perfidious, or distrust the pow'r, And evidence of ev'ry faithful sense; Rather than doubt your self the worship'd shrine Of his fond soul, and treasure of his joys. Mar. To dissipate my doubt, recite the whole, Without evasions. Ar. When he went to Rhodes, He thus to Sohemus his charge address'd. If I to CÃ¦sar's rage a victim fall, Let not my beauteous Queen survive, to grace The victor's triumphs, or to crown his love: Let me lie envy'd in the grave, possess'd Of Mariamne there! a happier doom, Than 'tis to live the world's imperial lord Without my Queen, or rival'd in my love. Mar. Whene'er did cruelty assume a look So smooth and fair before?âTo summon death, And arm the Terror with a dart of love, Against his Queen! his wife! whose ardent vows, Incessant pray'r, and sacrifice, implor'd Th'unutterable name, to make his head White as the flow'ring almond, with increase Of prosp'rous days; that ages yet unborn Might bow before his throne, and bless his pow'r; When I lie unlamented and forgot, A little heap of dust: and this return!â A sad return indeed! Ar. Call it despair, And fear of losing what his soul adores. Our deeds receive their colour from the will; His tongue was cruel, but his heart was kind; And rigor was, at worst, the sullen child Of grief, and bore a fix'd, but melting eye: Or if a crime, the crime of boundless love. Mar. Good heav'n! that base perfidious creature, man!â With what dissembled agonies of grief He cried, farewel! and fainted in my arms; I credulously fond thought all sincere! Ar. His grief was undissembled; but your charms Have wrought his love to rage. Mar. If this poor stock Of artless beauty hath such fatal pow'r, When you, Arsinoe, have a daughter born, Beg all deformities of shape and face, T'insure her quiet from that monster, man! Who quitting reason, a celestial claim, To the sweet harmony of souls prefers A little white and red, the airy food Of bestial appetite: and for a cheek, Whose transient beauties hardly will outwear The wardrobe of a flow'râ [A Messenger enters. Mess. The king and court Intreat your majesty wou'd come, to grace The banquet. Mar. No! I'm indispos'dâ[Exit Mess.] Now fly, Arsinoe, fly the meditated snare, Which Sohemus will spread: and may your love In the warm smile of fortune flourish fair, Fruitful of virtuous joys: but if the Pow'r Blast with malignant frowns the blooming sweets, Absolve your destiny of partial rage: Think on the wife, the mother, and the queen, Whose heart her hostile troops have long besieg'd: Think with kind pity on the countless store Of Mariamne's woes, and weep no more. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Enter Salome alone. Salome. I thought my heart was arm'd with adamant Against remorse, but nature fools me now; A faint cold shiv'ring seizeth every limb. SCENE VII. Enter Sohemus. Salome. My lord! O breathe some cordial to revive My sick'ning expectation. Soh. To defeat Our purpose, fortune with malicious joy Fav'ring the Queen, hath snatch'd her from the stroke Of lifted thunder; but the bolt is hurl'd, And on her head the ruin shall rebound. Her stern refusal to partake the feast, In foul suspicion will confirm the King; Absolve us, and to her transfer the crime: With hope attend th'event. [Exit. Soh. SCENE VIII. Salome. alone. On this great hour Shine all ye planets, whose malignant rays, Blast the fair prosp'rous growth of regal pow'r! Hark!âDeath's in action; from the banquet sounds The musick of his triumphs, groans and cries. SCENE IX. [To her Pheroras enters.] Pheroras. Give me, good heav'n! to feed on wholesom herbs In camps, and drink the pure untainted spring; Since death in ambush lies in sparkling cups, And courtly viands! Sal. Why, my lord, so pale? What strange disorder ends the festival? Pher. Sameas, the wretch whom I prefer'd to court, Design'd to poison all. Sal. Avert it, heav'ns! I hope he fail'd. Pher. His felon-cheek ne'er chang'd It's colour, when he brought th'impoison'd bowl, With garlands crown'd, and gave it to the King: Who with the fondness of a lover cry'd, He'd not indulge his taste, because the Queen Refus'd t'adorn the circle, so resign'd To Hazeroth the pledge of royal grace. Sudden his lips grew livid, and discharg'd A purple foam, his labouring bosom swell'd; His eye-balls like malignant meteors glar'd, Unmov'd and gastly: as the venom spread, Frightful convulsions writh'd his tortur'd limbs; Then mad with anguish, rushing to the floor He groan'd his soul away. Sal. All scap'd but he? Phe. Had not the villain over-drug'd the wine, We all had perish'd. SCENE X. Herod enters on one side of the Stage, and Sohemus on the other. Herod, to Sohemus. Will the Queen obey Our order, and attend us? Soh. Sir, she comes With much reluctance. [Mariamne enters. Her. to Mar. Did the banquet want Variety, or elegance of art, T'engage you to partake? If all our court Had been alike abstemious, Death had miss'd A rich repast! Mar. Death!âI can bear the sound: Ill fate is grown familiar to my ear! Her. There let it meet your eye. [She goes to the door which he points to. O'er the black crime How white a veil of innocence she throws! Soh. Her eyes glance indignation, now she finds Th' invenom'd dart hath err'd. Mar. Poor Hazeroth! Thy freedom costs thee dear! Her. You have been just, In punishing the traytor's insolence; Whom in excess of clemency I spar'd, Because ally'd to you. Mar. Murther'd by me!â So let the tiger sheath his savage fangs, And for the mangled fawn implead the roe!â To build my frame the forming pow'r infus'd Too mild a spirit, in too soft a mold, For such barbarian deeds.âWho wears the sword That flesh'd in slaughter, levell'd to the dust The royal stem, whence that poor scion sprung? [Pointing toward Haz. Who doom'd to death the hoary majesty Of good Hyrcanus? Whose insatiate rage Murther'd my royal father, and his son? Bid fame to late posterity report That Mariamne did it:âShe destroy'd Her grandsire, father, uncle, brother, all Her AsmonÃ¦an race; and then constrain'd Herod to wear the crown!â Her. So grac'd, to fall A nobler victim to her vast revenge! Mar. Call your brib'd witnesses; they're useful paint To varnish acts of arbitrary rage. Her. Why comes not Sameas? [Exit. Soh. Oh! how blest am I, If heav'n preserves that angel-form the seat Of innocence and truth: but much I fear Too plain conviction; for thy dream reveal'd This meditated crime: I heard thee cry, The King is poison'd.âBut attend the proof. SCENE XI. Sohemus enters with Sameas. Sohemus, to Sameas. The diamond will confirm your evidence. [Aside. Her. Sameas beware, and tremble to transgress The bounds of truth: if one assertion fail Of utmost evidence against the Queen; Thou for a single fiction shalt descend Quick to the heart of hell. Who gave the drugs That poison'd Hazeroth? Sam. Arsinoe said She brought them from the Queen; and much extoll'd Their pow'rful virtue to revive the flames Of dying love. Mar. Heav'n guard my innocence! Her. Haste! call Arsinoe.â Soh. Sir, she fled the court In great disorder. Her. How! Soh. The Roman camp Protects her guilt. Her. A potion to revive The flames of love! Did e'er my passion need The wicked pow'r of art to make it glow? [To Mar. O'er-whelm'd with blank confusion!â Mar. Must a dream, The transient image of a troubled thought, Join'd with that villain's frontless perjury, Be clear consummate proof, t' affirm a fact Wou'd make fiends start, and stand in wild amaze Abstracted from their hate! Can he produce A promise of rewards, or present bribe To fortify this proof? Sam. Arsinoe gave This precious token of your future grace. [Shews a jewel Her. Know you this diamond, sorceress! Mar. 'Tis the same You gave me on your birth-day. Her. To be made The lure of deathâO foul! Mar. Arsinoe's false; Send, intercept her flight: let her confront His evidence; and if they both conspire T' attaint my innocenceâ Her. My guards!âsecure [To the Captain of the guard. That wicked woman with a double guardâ Seize her, I say!â Mar. Friend, tremble not t' obey His orders, thou'rt a soldier.âBut, my lord!â Think not these tears, the frailty of my sex, Argue a sense of guilt, or servile hope Of moving pity, to retard my doom: I weep not for my self; nor wish to ward The blow, whene'er misguided justice strikes: But if I e'er was treasur'd in your heart; For sure you lov'd me onceâ Her. And lov'd too well! May all who hate me love as much as I, And then be thus requited! Mar. When I'm dead, O, let the stream of dear affection flow, Redoubled on my son! to him transfer The share I've lost.âAnd never may the wrong His mother bears, obstruct the sweet returns Of filial duty, and paternal love! But may my memory his soul inspire To scorn inglorious life, when honour calls Greatly to act, or suffer in her cause: And think the debt which death is sure to claim, A tribute due to virtue, and to fame.

The balm of sleep Can ne'er refresh these eyes, 'till the pale hand Of death shall draw their curtains, and exclude The busy buzzing swarm of stinging thoughts. My bed, the scene of all my blissful hours, Of all my tender, chaste, endearing joys, Which now have wing'd their everlasting flight, Is grown the den of horror and despair. O Mariamne!âWith my setting sun, Ill fortune now projects a deeper shade: I wish I were as I had never been; Number'd among the dead! Phe.

H. Pr. O, that, my royal lord, that which will spread O'er Palestine the blackest veil of woe, That ever nation wore! Forgive my zeal, Which breaks through courtly forms, to execute The heav'nly office which my order claims. Peace is my province; and I prostrate beg By all your publick and domestic joys! By the dear offspring of your royal bed! By all that merits your regard, release Your injur'd Queen! Her. Have you not heard her crime?

[Exeunt Her. and Pher. H. Pr. Now with speedy flight, Descend celestial ministers of peace! Who kindle virtuous ardors, and preside O'er nuptial vows: aid with auspicious zeal, The firm reunion of these royal hearts: And never never from your charge remove, 'Till death's commission'd to divide their love. [Exit. SCENE III. Enter Sohemus and Salome. Sohemus. Thus far with fate to friend, and greatly fir'd With bright ambition, we've pursu'd the path To glory; and with swift and easy steps, Approach the summit of imperial pow'r. Sal. But shou'd the King's enfeebled soul relent, And pardon Mariamne? Soh. She'll disdain To re-ascend the throne, or owe her life To low submission: for the stubborn sense Of genuine virtue in a royal mind, Ne'er softens with affliction; but becomes The more obdurate, when it once hath griev'd; As metals after melting harder grow. SCENE IV. [To them Sameas enters.] Salome. Sameas, thou best of friends! thy wish'd approach By instinct I perceiv'd; thy influence spreads Like rich perfumes; which, tho' invisible, Refresh the sense. Sam. Madam, I hop'd my art Had well deserv'd a jewel of your own, T' engage my service: 'twas too politic To feign a favour but to serve your cause, When the nice article of proof came on. Sal. Contemn that worthless pebble; we're intent On far more glorious views: whole provinces Shall recompence thy love. Sam. Rather consult Our common safety; life is all I crave. Sal. What may'st thou mean? Sam. Th' High Priest hath won the King To see the Queen to-night. Soh. Impossible! Sam. But now I met him speeding cross the court; Round him a rabble of her menial slaves Ran big with joy. Soh. Confound his holy craft!â Fortune at once rowls back the bounteous flow Of hope, and leaves us gasping on the shore!â [Salome whispers Sohemus. I'll do it. Sam. What, my lord?âWhat must we do?â Soh. Why, suffer greatly, since we cannot act! Thy part remains to persevere, tho' racks Strain every sinew smaller than the threads Which form a spider's web.âNe'er hope nor grace; 'Tis vain! Sam. I'll risque th' event, and goâ [Sohemus stabs him. Soh. To hell! To hell! poor timorous wretch, and tell the devilâ [In the struggle Sameas wrests the dagger out of Sohemus's hand; and in falling backward he strikes it into Salome's bosom, and dies. Soh. Princess ador'd and lov'd! Oh!âspeak! Sal. Death! death!â Save me, O Sohemus, from that black troop Of grizly shapes, which in fantastic dance Frisk round, and call me hence.âO, kind in vain!â A fiery whirlwind bears me from thy arms To seas of boiling sulphur; the blue waves Receive me to their bosom.âDown! deep, deep! [She dies. SCENE V. Enter Herod and Pheroras, with attendants. Herod. What hideous sound of shrieks and dying groans Echo'd from hence, as if by violence A soul had left her mansion unprepar'd. Phe. Horrors! our sister dead! Soh. That villain came [Pointing to Sameas's body. In all the gestures of extreme despair; Crying she brib'd him to accuse the Queen: And having heard Arsinoe wou'd return To null his evidence, rage and remorse Urg'd him to plunge the dagger in her breast, And then he pierc'd himself. Her. O SalomÃ©! The jarring elements which compos'd thy frame, Made thee aspiring, turbulent, and bold: In others woe was thy supreme delight; And most against my Queen thy malice aim'd Her venom'd shafts: but now thy guilty blood Will quench the flames, which thy infernal torch Spread o'er the harvest of my nuptial joys. Soh. How blind, alas! to fate is the dim eye Of dull mortality! Her. O Sohemus! A thrilling horror freezeth every vein, While I review the precipice of fate, Where late I stood perplex'd: but one step more Had plung'd me in th' abyss of endless woe, A most consummate wretch!âBut here she comes, [Mariamne enters in a mourning habit. Welcome as night with sweet refreshing shade, And balmy dews, to the faint traveller; Who journies o'er a waste of burning sands, With painful steps and slow.âRemove the dead; She hath no vengeful appetite to glut, With such sad spectacles. [All go out except Herod. SCENE VI. HEROD, MARIAMNE. Herod. Approach, my Queen! Thou dearest miracle of nature's hand, Adorn'd with all perfections! Mar. Dare you trust Your murd'ress near you? Her. Thy soft innocence Was form'd to kill with darts of keen desire; I beg those pleasing wounds: approach, my fair! Heav'ns! at the sight of that celestial face, Each savage passion from the soul retires; As wolves forsake the fold, when first the sun Flames o'er the eastern hills. Oh! thus, thus, thus, I'll clasp thee ever to my heaving breast: Thus on thy lips in glowing rapture seal, A firm eternal union of our soulsâ Mar. In vain!âThey who dissolv'd the first, have pow'r To cancel this. Her. Dismiss that groundless fear: Sameas and SalomÃ© are now no more; They've punish'd their own guilt, and the last breath Of faction spoke thy virtue greatly wrong'd. Mar. But the same judge survives, whose credulous ear Drank all that perjur'd malice cou'd infuse. You, who condemn'd me for the blackest crime, On evidence too counterfeit and light To cheat an idiot's eye, betray'd a will Dispos'd to credit ev'ry feign'd report; Whene'er malignant passion shall provoke Other artificers of fraud, t' assault My life or honour. Her. That unkind reproach Wou'd change to soft compassion, had you felt The stings of sorrow which transfix'd my soul, When first you were accus'd: I wou'd not bear Such agonies again, for all the crowns Which e'er ambition sigh'd for. Mar. To your self You owe whate'er you suffer'd; and your pain Was but the fancied torture of a dream: But wounds of honour bleed for ever new; Their anguish is sincere! My fame must bear The blast of censure, and the letter'd spleen Of future story. Her. No! thy fame will shine More bright, emerging from this short eclipse: The marks of envy give distinguish'd grace To virtue; as indented scars adorn The soldier's breast. Mar. I wish my innocence Wanted that mark of honour, which the tongue Of malice will miscall the brand of guilt. Her. The whitest ermin on her skin may bear An accidental spot; yet none accuse Her native purity, but call the stain The crime of fortune. To the doubtful world, My edict soon will vindicate thy fame: Lodge that, and all thy cares, within my breast; Where every gesture, word, and look inspire The spirit of purest love! Mar. For which I wear This livery of deathâIt suits the day Which gave me to your arms. Her. But now, disrob'd Of those sad weeds, and every gloomy thought, Smile like an angel breaking from a cloud. While peace, and joy, and ever-young desire Attend thee to my bed, each wedded pair Shall make our bliss the measure of their vows! Mar. Your bed!âthe tiger shall as soon perswade The hunted deer to harbour in his den.â Her. Damp not my glowing passion with a thought Of separation! Did our dates extend To the same length the giant-race enjoy'd, When nature yet was young, I then shou'd dread The sad idea of our last divorce; Tho' sure that many smiling centuries Wou'd rowl 'twixt death and us!âO! did thy love But equal mine, we'd each in other live So join'd, that when fate strikes we both might fall! I'd not survive thy doom. Mar. Nor can I yours!â Her. The words are what I wish, but ill explain'd By that stern look and haughty voice. Mar. Enquire Of that domestic oracle your heart: If that resolves not the mysterious sense, Ask Sohemus.â Her. Confusion! Mar. Do you start? With sudden rays of dawning truth amaz'd! As fiends wou'd be, shou'd the meridian sun Blaze on their black abodes. Her. Can neither words, Nor actions ought avail, but must disdain Repay my generous passion? Is thy rage Grown so implacable, no tender proofs Are prevalent t' assuage it? Mar. 'Twas a proof Of tender love, to doom me to the sword By such an order, as barbarian hate Wou'd only dictate in the rage of war! And with that engin of clandestine death To arm the malice of my foe profest!â On Sohemus you safely might rely, To send me soon to mingle with your dust. Her. O villain! perjur'd villain! to betray That charge on which depended all my peace! On which his life depended!âNothing less Than the damn'd witchcraft of thy wicked charms, Cou'd tempt him to the very cave of Death, To wanton with his darts!âTear him ye fiends!â To that false cheek dissembling nature gave The blush of virtue, for a veil to lust: He breath'd that fatal secret to thy ear In amorous murmurs, when the slave was grown Frantic with ecstasyâ Mar. My fame defies Th' envenom'd breath of slander; all my hours Have kept severest virtue for their guard. But I presage, offended heav'n prepares To punish that excess of virgin-love; By which betray'd, I gave my nuptial vow, Against the solemn sanction of our law: And to an alien's care transferr'd the charge Of pure religion; who, to flatter Rome, Neglects her altars, and her faith profanes. Her. Guards!âTake her hence! [Guards enter. No foolish fond remorse Shall now delay my vengeance!â [The Guards lead off Mariamne. Love farewel!â Rather than doat on her polluted charms, My sword shall rip the passion from my heart. Adultery!âYe violated heav'ns! Dart the red light'ning wing'd with tenfold rage, To blast th' adulteress! Why did ye forbear To rivet closer with hot thunder-bolts, The serpents twisted in the folds of lust!â SCENE VII. [Pheroras enters.] Herod. Pheroras, Oh!âTen thousand rebels arm, Grief, horror, shame, distraction!âthey besiege The poor soul, wav'ring in the fort of life, And wishing to surrender! Thy kind sword Might end this insurrection: dar'st thou strike? [Points to his breast. Pher. Heav'n shield from violence that sacred breast! Fear, guilt, despair, and moon-struck phrensy rush On voluntary death: the wise and brave, When the fierce storms of fortune round 'em roar, Combat the billows with redoubled force: Then, if they perish ere the port is gain'd, They sink with decent pride; and from the deep Honour retrieves them, bright as rising stars. Call reason to your aid, and with your friends Divide your care: doubt not but Sohemusâ Her. Thou nam'st the very scorpion which hath stung The centre of my heart. Pher. Then make his blood Balm for the wound. Her. The wound admits no cure! Nor reason, nor the healing hand of Time Can bring relief: But heav'n inspire my heart, Before it breaks, with new-devis'd revenge, Equal to that perfidious villain's crime!â Were his approaches frequent to the Queen, When I was absent? Pher. No; he ever stood The distant object of her hate. Her. With ease They might elude your eye; but SalomÃ©, And Sameas sure were conscious of their crimes; For which he murther'd both; and she prepar'd The poisonous bowl for me. But from that slave, Tortures shall wring the truth I dread to know. Secure him for the rack: and let the Queen Drink the same fatal draught she drug'd for me; Instant, with her own deathful art destroy Th'artificer of death!âO Mariamne!â Why would'st thou wrong my honour, and my love, And urge this direful doom? [Exit Pheroras. SCENE VIII. [Flaminius enters to Herod.] Herod. My Roman friend! Your unexpected visit finds my court In wild disorder. Flam. Sir, the Queen's desire To see the Prince, occasion'd my return At this uncourtly hour. Her. Few hours have pass'd, Since you beheld me in triumphal state: Now, like a meteor from a summer sky, Ingloriously I'm fall'n! Flam. Banish despair, And all her gloomy train: doubt not but fate In her large volume still for you reserves A page, as full of glory as the past. Her. Glory, Flaminius!âWill an empty name, A shining bubble, which the vulgar breath Of thoughtless crowds can swell for whom they please; E'er recompense the loss I must sustain? My Queen! my wife! the jewel of my soul! Flam. Mercy's the brightest ornament of pow'r; And now most needful to preserve your peace. Her. Justice must be my mercy: She must dye!â She must!â Flam. But, Sir, 'tis safer much to sheath The sword of justice, since the destin'd blow Will chiefly wound your self. Without your Queen, Your palace, though with gay retinue throng'd, Will seem a savage desart. You must view The mother blooming in your beauteous child, Nor feel a father's joy! Each object here, Will rouze the sad remembrance of the bliss You once possess'd with her! How will you wish For that sweet converse, when the smiling hours Danc'd to the musick of her heav'nly voice, And the short years were lost in dear delight! But when her charms are silent, dismal change! Slow sullen time on raven-wings will fly Heavy and black! around you then you'll see Your son, your nobles, and domesticks chang'd: For each, as their peculiar grief shall urge, With pensive silence will upbraid the loss Of mother, Queen, or friend. But what's the loss Of mother, Queen, or friend, compar'd to yours? A wife! the best, the loveliest of her sex. And late the best-belov'd! in the full pride Of summer beauty, like a poisonous weed Torn from the earth, and by her husband's hand Unkindly cast to wither in the grave! Her. My fate wou'd force from Rigor's flinty eye Ev'n tears of blood! [He weeps. Fla. O Sir! reflect, if thus The bare recital wounds your fancy now, A yet more dreadful pain may pierce your heart! Love may once more revive, vain hopeless love! When the dear object of your longing soul Lies mould'ring in the dust. If so, the wretch Who buried in a trance returns to life, And walks distracted o'er the ratling bones Of his dead fathers, in the dreary vault Less horror feels, than sad remorse will raise Within your breast! Her. O Mariamne lost! To love for ever lost! to love and me!â I've liv'd Love's slave too long; but Jealousy, That yellow fiend! hath dip'd the torch in gall, And now 'twill light no more!â Fla. If the Queen's false, My Wife hath been officious to her crimes, And shares in the pollution: let her plea Be heard; and if she fails in her defence, I'll slay her at your feet. [Flaminius goes out, and returns immediately with Arsinoe. SCENE IX. Herod to Arsinoe. As heav'nly peace May sooth your anguish, when the fluttering soul Prepares to wing her last eternal flight; Assist my quiet, and resolve my doubts! Was Sohemus admitted to the Queen, Whilst I was gone to Rhodes? Ar. Never, my Lord! Her. Never? Ar. His name's offensive to her ear: And for his person! no antipathy In nature can be stronger. Her. So I thought; But such fictitious arts too oft conceal Criminal correspondence: they might write! And doubtless did. Ar. That commerce cou'd not 'scape My notice, who by constant duty bound, Waited so near the Queen. Her. What if she saw? Her interest then, and now her fear prevails To seal the lips of truth. Fla. Sir, not the frown Of majesty, nor brandish'd thunder awes A Roman spirit, (such I hope she bears) To make it start from the plain tracks of truth, And deviate into falsehood. Her. Can the Queen Pierce to the close recesses of the soul? Are thoughts there visible, like children's toys Kept in a chrystal case? Does she retain DÃ¦mons, to sit secure from mortal sight, In Princes cabinets to learn the summ Of secret counsels? Told they this decree; If CÃ¦sar, to revenge the sacred faith I held with Anthony, shou'd to the sword Sentence my head, that her's shou'd likewise fall; Lest the proud successor who seiz'd my throne, Shou'd triumph in my bed?âNo! That resolve A carnal fiend imparted; and she paid His service with her honour!â Ar. Royal Sir! Her honour is unblemish'd; all the blame Transfer to my officious zeal: I told That fatal secret. Her. How!âDid Sohemus Impart that most important charge to you? Ar. To me his vows of love were then address'd; Which when disdain'd, with more persuasive force To recommend his passion, he reveal'd The dreadful mandate left in trust; and swore That if you perish'd by the sword of Rome My love alone was ransom for the life Of my dear Royal mistress. Her. Fly! O fly! Swift as a cherub to preserve his charge Reverse the doom of death. [Exit Ar. SCENE X. [To them Pheroras enters.] Herod to Pheroras. Is Sohemus Secur'd for torture? Phe. Sir, he took th' alarm, And fled for safety to the royal tow'r: The portal forc'd, the soldiers found him fall'n On his self-slaught'ring sword, stretcht on the ground Welt'ring in blood; he speechless there expir'd. Her. Too far confiding in that traytor's skill In arts of rule, he so misus'd my pow'r, That distant story may record my reign From year to year, by many a cruel deed; As the wild progress of a storm is trac'd By marks of desolation. SCENE the Last. [Mariamne enters supported by the High-Priest and Narbal; Arsinoe follows with the young Prince.] Herod. Heav'ns avert The bodings of my soul! I fear the Queenâ H. Pr. Oh Sir!â Her. Hah! say'st thou?â H. Pr. A few moments more Will rank her with the dead! Ar. E'er I arriv'd The deadly draught was giv'n, which soon will end The sense of all her woes. Her. And all my joys!â O call, call our physicians! now let art Exert her saving pow'r, or ever prove The minister of death!â Mar. The venom's spread Too far for art! Her. O! wish to live, and heav'n Will crown thy wish with life: heav'n will be just To that bright innocence, which I have wrong'd! Wrong'd with excess of love to fury wrought!â O wretch, wretch, wretch!â Mar. Death's welcome, now I hear My innocence avow'd. Her. I! I! whose life Was bound with thine, by striving to secure Thy beauties all my own, have kill'd the dove I fondly grasp'd too close!âO see! she's pale: Take, take, ye pow'rs! my life to lengthen hers: Chain me, ye furies! to your burning wheel! Whip me ten thousand years with scorpions there, To save her life!â Mar. I pity and forgive Your violence of passion, which hath wrought The ruin of us both! Her. I ill deserve Thy pardon or thy pityâYet vouchsafe, Thou fairest pattern of transcendent goodness! Vouchsafe thy wretched lord a last embrace; Whose soul is ready wing'd to wait on thine: Oh!âbless the dying penitent with peace, The moments which remain!â Mar. Good heav'n insure [They embrace. Eternal peace to both! Her. Thou shalt not dye!â Thou art too young, too faultless, and too fair, To fall a prey to death!â Mar. The thick'ning shades O'er-spread my swimming eyesâWhere is my child? Bring him, poor babe! to take a parting kiss!â Farewel!âI'm now at peace!â [She dies. H. Pr. In that soft sigh The gentle spirit soar'd! Ar. Oh! dead, dead, dead!â Her. Then, Death! strike on; [He faints. Fate, thou hast done thy worst!â Phe. My royal brother! Oh!â Nar. My gracious lord!â H. Pr. Good heav'n! restore to wretched Palestine Her sole support, and grace! Her. What minister [Raising himself. Of this dark realm art thou?âIf 'tis thy post To guide the dead through this disastrous gloom; Lead to that mournful mansion, where the ghosts Of those abide, whom fatal beauty sent Untimely to the shades!âSee! see! she soars!â How bright a track she leaves along the sky; And looks with pity down!âOh see! she rests On the soft fleece of yonder purple cloud, Where angels fan her with their golden plumes: Stay, Mariamne, stay!â [He sinks into their arms. Phe. O! from his face The blush of life retires. Nar. His bosom heaves With strong convulsive throws! Fla. Raise him, my lords. Her. Alas! forbear; ye but prolong the pains Of lab'ring nature; let me sink to peace! And may Oblivion cast her sable veil O'er my sad story, and conceal the crimes Of majesty mis-led! My urn, alas! Can hope for no compassion: when the doom Of my dear, lovely, virtuous Queen is told; The tears will freeze on Pity's gentle cheek, And not bedew my ashes!âTo your care [To Fla. Receive this royal orphan, and implore CÃ¦sar's protection to preserve his crown. And when mature in manhood, he receives A consort to his throne, may every grace And every virtue join, to make her styl'd The Mariamne of th' admiring age! May sweet compliance, honour, dear esteem, And mutual faith cement their mutual joys! But ever may he shun too fond excess! That soft seducing impotence of mind, By which subdu'd, his wretched father fell! Led by imperious Love a tortur'd slave, To the sad refuge of an early grave! [He dies. The End of the Fifth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE: SPOKEN BY Mrs. SEYMOUR. The Poet, in a whim extremely new, Coupl'd me with a strange enamour'd Jew; So violently fond! the loss of life Was far less dreadful than to leave his wife: Monster of love! he whisper'd in my ear, I doat so much . . . I pr'ythee die, my dear! Ladies, if such demands are made on beauty, Defend us all from matrimonial duty! One may support a living husband's folly; But, let him feed the worms alone, for Mollyâ And yet 'tis vain to reason, or to rail, The tempter man was destin'd to prevail: To hear him flatter, sigh, implore, protest, A . . . je ne sÃ§ai quoi! . . . will flutter in the breast. But o'er intrigues whatever planet reigns, And fires to Bedlam-rage a lover's brains; One honey-moon's sufficient to restore 'em From wild impertinence, to cool decorum. By this plain model had the play been wrought, My Hebrew spark had acted as he ought; With a keen appetite enjoy'd the feast, And decently suffic'd, withdrawn to rest: But, glutton-like, to grudge the world his Leaving, Was wond'rous unpolite, to my conceiving! Homer, who human nature nicely knew, (Ye Critics, I read Greek . . . as well as you.) In colours of a softer kind display'd The husband civil, to the wife who stray'd. Though Helen had elop'd, her gentle lord Renew'd her forfeit claim to bed and board: For which dear foible of the fair forgiv'n, The Gods vouchsaf'd to send him Quick to heav'n: And in no Spartan novel can I find, The good man griev'd to leave his spouse behind. In such gay lights when wedded life is shown, What couple wou'd not wish the case their own? But, Gallants, if you Herod's rule approve, To give no quarter in the lists of love; If jealous rage, or fond fantastic dreams, Exalt your passion to such dire extremes: Let each bright Mariamne chuse her man, Then, kill us all . . . with kindness, if ye can.
