      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Court yard of a palace belonging to Manlius, in the suburbs of Rome. Steps leading to his apartments. Attilia, Licinius from the steps. Lictors and People. Lic. My fair Attilia! Heavens! I little thought To find the daughter of our Regulus Amidst the lictors and Plebeian throngs. Att. I wait the Consul's coming: I would teach him At least to blush: 'tis now no time, Licinius, For timorous forms: five tedious years my father Has groan'd in Africa a wretched captive: None seek to obtain his freedom; I alone In Rome lament, and dwell upon his sufferings. If I were silent, who would plead his cause? Lic. Ah! speak not thus unjustly. Where is he Who does not sigh for his return, and think All Afric, if subdued, were little gain'd Should such a citizen be lost to Rome? I speak not thus from partial ties to thee: He is thy father, whom my soul adores: Beneath his sight I learn'd the use of arms, And all the Roman virtue that I boast He first inspir'd. Att. And yet, alas! I see notâ Lic. What could I singly do? 'Twas not the wish Of blind ambition urg'd me to procure The power of Tribune: no, by this I hop'd To give my purpose weight: I now shall call The general people in the Tribune's nameâ Att. Reserve a measure, bold as this, to apply When all has else been tried: let us not wake Dissension 'twixt the people and the senate: Thou know'st too well the jealousy in each Of sovereign power, by each in turn abus'd: What one demands, the other still denies. A milder way remains. I know this instant From Carthage an ambassador to Rome Is here expected. In Bellona's temple The Fathers are assembled to receive him; And there the Consul may for Regulus Propose the ransom. Lic. Manlius? O! remember He ever has oppos'd thy father's counsels From earliest years: to trust in him were vain. Manlius his rival? Att. Manlius is a Roman, Nor will pursue his private enmity With power that station gives him. Let me speak To Manlius first and hear him. Lic. Choose at least Some other place to address him: let not Manlius Find thee thus mingled with the vulgar herd. Att. Yes, I would have him see me thus, and feel A conscious shame, thus in the public hearing His audience give, and make me his reply. Lic. He comes. Att. Depart, Licinius. Lic. O! Attilia, Not one kind look? Att. Remember, O! Licinius, I am a daughter, not a lover now. Lic. A daughter thou, indulge the care A father's state requires; But ah! forget not quite, my fair, What faithful love inspires. Let no offence thy virtue take; Attilia may forgive Her thoughts of him, who for her sake Alone can wish to live. [Exit. SCENE II. Enter Manlius from his apartment. Att. One moment, Manlius, stay and hear me speak. Man. Is this a place, Attilia, suits with thee? Att. It suited not when I could boast a father Unconquer'd and in freedom: now, alas! It suits too well the daughter of a slave. Man. And wherefore com'st thou? Att. Wherefore am I come? Ah! say how long, to every nation's wonder, To Rome's disgrace, has Regulus to languish In ignominious bonds? Swift pass the days, The years are heap'd on years, and none remember He lives in servitude. What crime of his Her merited from Romans to incur Such base forgetfulness? Perhaps the love With which he priz'd his country's good before His children and himself? His great, his just, His uncorrupted heart? Perhaps, in rank, Of high estate, his noble poverty? And is there one who breathes this common air Can Regulus forget? What part of Rome Speaks not of him? The public ways? Through these He pass'd in triumph once. The forum? There He gave us wholesome laws. The walls where now The senate meet? His counsels there full oft Have plann'd the public safety. Enter now The temples, Manlius; mount the capitol; And say who deck'd them with such foreign trophies; Sicilian, Punic, Tarentinian spoils. These very lictors, that precede thee now, That consul's purple robe, these, these were once Beheld with RegulusâAnd now he's left To die in bonds, and nothing more remains To speak his virtues but Attilia's tears Here shed, and shed in vain.âAlas! my father, Ungrateful citizens! ungrateful Rome! Man. Just is thy grief, Attilia, but unjust Thy accusation; since with us the fate Of Regulus excites indeed compassion: We know what impious treatment he receives From cruel Carthageâ Att. 'Tis not Carthage merits The name of cruel: Carthage but oppresses An ancient enemy, while Rome forgets A faithful citizen. The first remembers Her injuries from him, the last has cancell'd His labours for her sake: the one revenges In him her shame, the other persecutes The man who twin'd the laurel round her brows. Then which of these is cruel, Rome or Carthage? Man. What can we then to avail him? Att. Let the Senate Now proffer to the ambassador from Afric For him exchange or ransom. Man. As a daughter Thou speak'st, Attilia; but with me it fits To act as Consul. We must first debate If such proposal glorious be to Rome. He who has long inur'd his hands to chainsâ Att. Whence hast thou, Manlius, learn'd these rigid maxims? Man. From great examples ever present to me. Att. Say rather, Manlius, thou hast to my father Been ever opposite. Man. Am I to blame If he submitted to a sham'd defeat; If he remain'd a prisoner midst the foes? Att. Ere his defeat he gave full many a proofâ Man. The Senate now, Attilia, are assembled, I can no longer stay. Inspire the rest With maxims less severe: thy voice perhaps May soften them and make my rigour vain: Manlius is consul, not a king in Rome. By thee my heart is cruel deem'd, And sway'd by savage laws; But grief is not a judge esteem'd Impartial in her cause. I know a daughter's anxious love; Yet no reproach to me, If what so many may approve, Is grief alone to thee? [Exit. SCENE III. Attilia alone. Then nothing more remains for me to hope From either Consul: one is absent hence, And one a foe. Then let us call in aid The suffrage of the peopleâHapless father! On what uncertain turns must now depend Thy liberty and life? SCENE IV. Enter Barce hastily. Bar. My dear Attilia! Attilia. Att. Why this haste? Bar. The ambassador. From Afric is arriv'd. Att. Such transport sure These tidings merit not. Bar. Others I bring Of far more weight. Att. Speak, Barce, what are those? Bar. With him is Regulus. Att. My father! Bar. He: Thy father. Att. Barce, O! thou art deceiv'd, Or thou deceiv'st Attilia. Bar. I myself Beheld him notâbut every oneâ Att. My Publius! [looking out sees her brother. SCENE V. Enter Publius. Pub. I'm wild with transport! Regulus, my sister, Is now in Rome. Att. O! Gods, what joyful sound! Conduct me to himâwhere, where is he, Publius? O! let us haste. Pub. It is not yet the time: He, with the ambassador from Carthage, waits Admittance from the Senate. Att. Where, my brother, Where didst thou see him? Pub. Well thou know'st, as QuÃ¦stor, My office is to welcome every envoy From foreign states. I heard the ambassador Of Carthage was arriv'd, and towards the gate Advanc'd to meet him: when I thought to view A face unknown from Afric, I beheld, With rapture I beheld, my lord, my father. Att. What said he, and to him what said my Publius? Pub. Ere my arrival had he gain'd the shore; And silent on the Capitol, that part In prospect rose, he thoughtful fix'd his eyes. I saw, I knew him, cried, âMy dearest father!â And swiftly ran to kiss his honour'd hand. He heard, he turn'd, then backward drew his step, And with that look of awful majesty, With which he once made conquer'd Afric tremble, âIn Romeâ he said, âno captive is a father.â I would have answer'd, but abrupt he ask'd If yet the Senate met, and where their meeting, This heard, he to the temple bent his pace,â Nor further spoke. I flew to tell the Consul, Where shall I find him? I behold not here The attending Lictors. Bar. To Bellona's temple He went but now. Att. Is Regulus return'd To us a captive? Pub. Yes, but well I know He brings the terms of peace, and that on him Depends his destiny. Att. Who knows from Rome If these will find acceptance? Pub. Had'st thou seen How Rome receiv'd him, never would thy breast Have harbour'd doubts like these.âAll, all, Attilia, Are wild with joy: too narrow were the ways To admit the swarming throngs; each points to him With eager gaze: by what endearing titles I heard him nam'd! and O! what numbers view'd him, With eyes that moisten'd shone with tender tears! What sight, Attilia, for a son like me. Att. Where, where is now Licinius? Seek him, Publius, Not shar'd with him, imperfect is my joy. If I rejoice, let him rejoice, The dearest object of my choice: As when, alas! I woes sustain, His bosom shares with mine the pain. For ever happy may he prove The ties that bind his soul to love: Enough till now his faithful mind Has felt the pangs that lovers find. [Exit. SCENE VI. Publius, Barce. Pub. Farewell, my lovely Barce. Bar. Hear me yet; And know'st thou not the name of him, who comes Ambassador from Carthage? Pub. Yes; he's call'd Amilcar. Bar. Is he Hanno's son? Pub. The same. Bar. [aside.] It is, it is my love, Pub. Thy colour changesâ What can this mean? Perhaps from him proceeds Thy coldness shewn to Publius. Bar. Sir, from you And from Attilia, have I prov'd such goodness, As never yet to feel a captive's chains: And O! 'twere most ungrateful to deceive you. Permit me to disclose my inmost heart: Know thenâ Pub. Be silent: I too well foresee Thy candour will be fatal: 'midst the draught Of this day's joy, ah! mix not deadly poison. If thou art vow'd another's; let me still Remain at least uncertain of my fate. If now some happier object dwell In Barce's gentle mind, Let not thy lips, my fair-one, tell The truth I dread to find. Though dire suspicion, rankling still, Can damp the purest joy, Yet certainty of greater ill Must every hope destroy. [Exit. SCENE VII. Barce alone. Is it then true that I so soon shall see The man I love? The first, the only object For which I knew affection?âO! my heart! How wilt thou feel before Amilcar's presence, When now thou tremblest but to hear his name? She only knows, who long has mourn'd, When truly to rejoice; Who sees again from far return'd The object of her choice. From flowing tears and heaving sighs, That hours of grief employ, Remembrance then the thought supplies That turns to present joy. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Inside of the temple of Bellona, seats for the Roman Senators and for the Ambassadors of foreign States. Lictors guarding the several entrances to the temple; a view of the Capitol and the Tiber. Manlius, Publius, Senators. Man. Let Regulus appear and with him bring The ambassador from Afric:âDo the foes Then ask for peace? [to Publius. Pub. At least they ask to make Exchange of prisoners; and to Regulus Have given in charge to obtain it from the Senate. If nothing he obtain, his faith is plighted For his return to Carthage, with his blood To answer Rome's refusal. This he swore, And, ere he parted, saw the preparation (A dreadful object!) for his threatened death. Ah! let it ne'er be said that to endure Such punishment, a citizen like thisâ Man. No moreâhe comes, [the Consul, Publius and all the Senators take their places: a place remains vacant next the Consul, formerly occupied by Regulus. Regulus and Amilcar pass between the Lictors, who open their ranks to receive them, and close again after they are passed. Regulus on entering the Temple, stops for a short time in a thoughtful attitude. SCENE IX. Manlius, Publius, Senators, Regulus, Amilcar. Amil. [aside to Reg.] Why, Regulus, this pause? Say, is this place to thee so new an object? Reg. [to Amil.] I think what hence I went, and what return. Amil. [addressing the Consul.] The Senators of Carthage, who desire To sheathe the slaughtering sword have sent by me Their greeting to the Senators of Rome: If Rome desire a peace, they send it now. Man. Sit then and speak their purpose. [Amil. sits. [to Reg.] Regulus, Approach, and re-assume thine ancient seat. Reg. First tell me, who are these? Man. The conscript Fathers. Reg. And who art thou? Man. Dost thou so little know The Consul Manlius? Reg. Tell me: with the Consul And reverend Fathers shall a slave have place? Man. No! but for thee the rigour of her laws Rome now forgets; for thee, to whom she owes Such numerous triumphs. Reg. But if Rome forget, I bear them here engrav'd. Man. [aside.] Whoe'er beheld Such rigid virtue? Pub. Nor can Publius now Be seated longer here. [rises. Reg. What dost thou, Publius? Pub. I but fulfill my duty: if the father Refuse a seat, it fits the son to rise. Reg. Are then the manners now so chang'd in Rome? Before I sail'd for Afric, 'twas a crime, In public cares, to think of private duties. Pub. But yetâ Reg. Sit, Publius, sit, and learn henceforth To fill thy place more nobly. Pub. Such respect Sure nature justly claims before a father. Reg. When he was vanquish'd, then thy father died. Man. Now let Amilcar speak. [Publius sits. Amil. To Regulus Has Carthage given in trust to make to Rome Her wishes known: what he shall speak, is spoken By me and Carthage. Man. Regulus then speak. Amil. [aside to Reg.] Remember now if nothing thou obtain Thou then hast swornâ Reg. [to him.] What Regulus has sworn He shall fulfill. Man. [aside.] His life is now at stake. What words will he employ? Pub. [aside.] Ye Gods of Rome! Do you inspire his lips with eloquence. Reg. The Carthaginian foe, on this condition, That all he holds be now confirm'd his own, Of you, O! conscript Fathers, asks a peace, If peace be will'd not, he at least demands A full exchange, on either side, to end The mournful exile of your mutual captives: My counsel is on theseâreject them both, Amil. [aside.] What do I hear? Pub. [aside.] Alas! Man. [aside.] I'm mute with wonder. Reg. I shall not labour here to explain the evils Attendant upon peace: but if the foe So much desire to treat, it argues fear. Man. But then th' exchange? Reg. Th' exchange conceals designs To you more dangerousâ Amil. [aside to Reg.] Regulus, remember. Reg. [to him.] What Regulus has sworn he shall fulfill. Pub. [aside.] O! Heavens! my father's lost. Reg. Th' exchange propos'd Includes a thousand mischiefs; but th' example Is more pernicious. Farewell, Fathers, then To Rome's high honours, valour, constancy, And military virtue, if the coward May hope to escape with liberty and life. What profits Rome that HE to Rome returns Who bears upon his back the marks of shame, The servile scourge? Who living left his arms Unstain'd with hostile blood, and basely chose, Through fear of death, to meet the victor's scorn? O! shame, eternal shame! Man. Whate'er th' exchange May prove, the good of Regulus alone Compensates every evil. Reg. Manlius, no: Thou art deceiv'd, for Regulus is mortal. I feel already the decays of age, And little now can I avail to Rome: But much those vigorous youths, for me exchang'd, Will strengthen Carthage: be not then so blinded Against yourselves. I to my country gave My best of days, and to the foe I give The useless remnant: let him poorly triumph To see an old man die; but let him see His triumph vain, when here in every part, A Regulus shall rise to bleed for Rome. Man. [aside.] Unheard-of fortitude! Pub. [aside.] O! fatal courage! Amil. [aside.] What sentiments, till now to me unknown! Man. We must not merely weigh what serves the state, But weigh, with service done, the Roman honour; And surely Rome can ne'er with honour prove Ungrateful to a citizen like thee. Reg. Would Rome be grateful to me, Regulus Shall point the way to shew her gratitude. These rude barbarians, Fathers, dar'd to think My soul so base, that abject fear of death Might send me here with purpose to betray you. This thought alone exceeds the sharpest pangs That tyrants can inflictâRevenge me, Fathersâ I was a Roman onceâArm, arm with speed, And from their temples snatch the imprison'd eagles, Nor sheathe your weapons, till this rival power Be crush'd for ever! Let me, when return'd, Even in the face of my tormentors read The dread of your resentment: gladly then I perish; in my latest hour, to see How Afric trembles at the Roman name. Amil. [aside.] My indignation now is lost in wonder. Pub. [aside.] None answer, O! ye Powers! Man. So great a question Demands maturest counsel. We must give Some time to recollect our thoughts, oppress'd With just astonishment. Thou soon, Amilcar, Shalt know the Senate's will: but first the Fathers Will to the temples go, with pious vows To invoke the Gods. [he rises, and all rise at the same time. Reg. And is there yet a doubt? Man. Yes, Regulus, I see not if the peril Be greater to neglect such weighty counsel; Or greater peril, in pursuing that, To lose the man from whom such counsel came. Thou great despiser of thy death, Canst for thy country yield thy breath; Thy country, doom'd such death to see, Must mourn her noblest son in thee. Thou calmly seek'st for her to die, And serve her at a price too high; Since rarely Heaven on man below Will virtue great as thine bestow. [Exit, followed by the Senators and Lictors. SCENE X. Regulus, Publius, Amilcar. Amil. Does Regulus thus keep his plighted faith? Reg. My word was plighted to return to Carthage; My word shall be fulfill'd. Amil. But yetâ SCENE XI. Enter Attilia and Licinius. Att. My father! Lic. My lord! Att., Lic. On this most honour'd hand. [attempting to kiss his hand. Reg. Away. The Gods be prais'd I have not yet my freedom. Att. Is then the exchange refus'd? Reg. Conduct us, Publius, To that abode, prescrib'd by Roman laws For me and for Amilcar. Pub. Wilt thou not Revisit now thy own paternal Lares, Thine ancient seat? Reg. No hostile messenger Must enter Rome. Lic. This too severe decree Is not for Regulus. Reg. But such decree, If not for all, were partial tyranny. Att. At least permit, where'er thou goest, my father, Permit me to attend thee. Reg. No, Attilia, The present time demands far other thoughts Than those a daughter and a father feel. Att. Why art thou chang'd from what I knew my father? Reg. My fate is chang'd, but Regulus the same. With laurel wreath'd, or bound in chains, I bear a soul resign'd: The thraldom that my limbs restrains, In freedom leaves my mind. In various forms my virtue still, Through every change of state, Can combat, with unshaken will, The rigorous turns of fate. [Exit, followed by Publius, Licinius and people. SCENE XII. Attilia in suspense, Amilcar going, Barce entering. Bar. Amilcar. Amil. Ah! my Barce. [returning.] Thou again? Thou art lost to me, since Regulus dissuades The Senate from th' exchange. Bar., Att. O! Heavenly Powers! Amil. Farewell, my love, I must attend on Publius. O! I have much to tell thee. Bar. Yet thou'rt silent. Amil. If still thou lov'st, thy lover's mind Thou canst not vainly seek; Thou in these eyes the thoughts wilt find My tongue denies to speak: Since I, who caught from thee the fires That in my bosom glow, Can from a sigh thy lip respires, A thousand secrets know. [Exit. SCENE XIII. Attilia, Barce. Att. Ah! who would thus have fear'd? My father, Barce, Conspires against himself. Bar. But should the Senate As yet determine not; for thee, Attilia, There much remains to hope. Go hence, employ Each power of speech, before the Fathers meet To new debate. 'Tis now the time to adopt Whatever art or eloquence can do; The love of his associates, and the faith Of bosom friends; Go:âevery where implore The suffrage of the Romans to thy aid, Att. All shall be tried, but little is my hope. But late I seem'd in port to lie, With waters smooth and cloudless sky; When fiercely now the tempest sweeps And bears me helpless to the deeps. To tremble now can scarce be shame: I merit pity more than blame, If midst a storm so cruel tost, In black despair my hopes are lost. [Exit. SCENE XIV. Barce alone. Alas! what hapless destiny is mine, If once again, without me, should Amilcar Return to Carthage!âat the thought alone I feel myselfâno, rather let me hopeâ The unhappy ever find a time to mourn: From folly, not from wisdom, mortals seek With cruel art to look for future woes. The ideas fram'd of distant ill Which timorous fancy drew, We find, by sage experience, still More painful than the true. Who rashly figures in his mind Some mischief to deplore, Is certain then a pang to find That doubtful was before. [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Apartments within view of Rome, in a palace of the suburbs appointed for the residence of the Carthaginian ambassadors. Regulus, Publius. Reg. How! Publius here? The glory now of Rome, Thy father's honour and the public peace Are in debate; then say, what means my son Thou art not in the senate? Pub. Pardon, sir, As yet they're not assembled. Reg. Goâdelay not; Support my counsel firmly with the Fathers, And prove thyself deserving of thy race. Pub. How! would you have me then employ the means To bring destruction on you? Reg. That to me Is not destruction which can serve my country. Pub. O! yet, my lord, have pity on yourself. Reg. And think'st thou, Publius, that my mind is now By frenzy urg'd? Believ'st thou I alone, Of all mankind, am hateful to myself? O! noâthou art deceiv'd: like each that lives, I would secure the good and shun the evil. But know the last I only find in guilt, The first in virtue. Guilt it were to gain My freedom with the sufferings of my country; Hence life and freedom are to me an evil. 'Tis virtue with our blood to serve our country; Hence servitude and death to me are good. Pub. Our country stillâ Reg. Our country is a whole Of which we form the part. 'Tis criminal In one that bears the name of citizen, To weigh his private weal distinct from hers. By him is nothing to be wish'd or shunn'd But what may harm or benefit that country, To which he owes his all. Whene'er he toils, Or sheds his blood to serve her, from himself He nothing gives, but only renders back What he from her receiv'd. She gave him birth And nourishment: she rear'd his infant years To ripen'd manhood; with her laws protects From home-bred spoilers; with her arms defends From foreign insults: she on him bestows Name, rank and honours: she rewards his merits, And vindicates his wrongs: a tender mother, She labours to procure him all the happiness Which earth can yield. But blessings such as these 'Tis true must have their claims, and who rejects them Must give up every title to the advantage Of law and social compact: let him seek The inhospitable woods, there feed contented On scanty acorns in some sordid stye, And at his will enjoy a life of freedom. Pub. Your words, with reverence heard, convince my reason, But cannot touch my heart; and nature shrinks To do your bidding. I am still a son, And never can forget it. Reg. Weak excuse For one a Roman born. There have been fathersâ Virginius, Manlius, Brutusâ Pub. O! 'tis trueâ But fortitude like theirs has found example In fathers only: Rome has never yet Produc'd a son to sacrifice his parent. Reg. Then, Publius, thou aspire to stand the first And glorious pattern to succeeding sons. âAway. Pub. Yet hearâ Reg. No more. I wait from thee The tidings of my fate. Pub. You ask too much From me, O! sir, too much. Reg. Say, would'st thou have me A stranger or a father? If a stranger, Neglect not then the good of Rome for mine; And if a father, Publius, then respect My will and leave me. Pub. Could a father see Th' emotions of my heart he then might claim Less rigid duties. Reg. From thy heart he claims The proofs of constancy and not of love. Pub. Ah! would'st thou prove me, father, say What proof shall I bestow? Before thy feet my life I lay, For thee my blood shall flow. But that a son should now appear A parent's life to seek; Forgive me, mighty sire, if here I find my virtue weak. [Exit. SCENE II. Regulus alone. The important hour is nigh, and much I fear The fathers yet may pauseâO! hear me now, Ye guardian Gods of Rome! Inspire their souls With nobler thoughts. SCENE III. Enter Manlius. Man. [speaks as entering.] The lictors may remain To guard the entrance, and let none presume To come thus far. Reg. [aside, seeing Man.] Manlius! what means he here? Man. Ah! let me press thee to my eager bosom, Exalted hero! Reg. Think what thou would'st do; A consul sureâ Man. I am not, Regulus, A consul now: I here am only one That venerates thy fortitude and virtue, And burns with emulation; owns himself By thee subdued, and here confessing all His ancient enmity to thee unjust, Now sues to knit with thine his hand in friendship. Reg. Such is the wonted strain of noble minds. The stormy wind upon the prostrate tree Or blows no more, or lifts it from the ground. 'Tis to my happy slavery I owe A friend so gain'd in thee. Man. 'Tis true, thy fortune Has shewn me what thou art; and ne'er these eyes Beheld thee so majestic as in chains. Oft have I seen thee from the foes of Rome Return a victor: now thou art return'd A greater victor o'er thyself and Fortune. Thy laurels rais'd my envy, but thy chains Excite respect. I own that Regulus Then seem'd a hero, now he seems a God. Reg. Enough, enough, O! Manlius, praise bestow'd By such a lip might shake the firmest virtue: Believe me grateful then, that Manlius deigns To honour with his love my last of days. Man. Thy last of days! I mean to save thee still Long, long to bless thy country; and have labour'd For thee my utmost, that th' exchange propos'd May meet the general suffrage. Reg. [disturbed.] Is it thus That Manlius has begun to prove his friendship? What could'st thou more had still thy hate pursued me? O! thou wilt rob me thus of all the fruit I hop'd from shame. I am not here in Rome To shew my chains and to excite her pity: I come to save her from a fatal risk; The risk of listening to insidious terms. If thou canst give no other pledge of love, Return again to hate me. Man. But th' exchange Rejected seals thy death. Reg. Is then the name Of death so dreadful in the ears of Manlius? I need not now be told that I am mortal: The foe can only take from Regulus What nature soon will claim; and that which now Would be a willing gift must then become A certain tribute: let me teach the world That Regulus has liv'd but for his country; And when his life has reach'd its fated close, At least can make his death of use to Rome. Man. O glorious sentiments! O! happy soil Producing such a son! Ah! who could e'er With-hold from thee his love? Reg. If thou will love me, Then love me as a Roman: these alone Our terms of friendship: let us offer each To Rome his ready victim; I my life, And thou thy friend; since 'tis but just thy virtue Should make some offering to thy country's good. Go thenâbut promise to support my counsel Amidst the Senate. On this sole condition I here accept the friendship Manlius gives. Say thenâ Man. [after a pause.] It shall be soâI plight my faith. Reg. In Manlius for my friend I here embrace A gift from favouring Heaven. Man. Why am not I Thus honour'd with the weight of chains like thine? Reg. Let us not lose the time. The conscript Fathers Perhaps are met. Remember, to thy truth I trust my country's fame, my peace and honour. Man. Farewell, our Tiber's glory! Reg. Friend, farewell. [they embrace. Man. What flame of glory now I feel While thus thy voice with virtuous zeal The patriot's godlike name maintains! The wretch, howe'er debas'd with fear, Inspir'd anew such words to hear, Would give a kingdom for thy chains. [Exit. SCENE IV. Enter Licinius. Reg. [to himself.] I now begin to breathe; propitious Heaven Sure seconds my designs. Lic. [to Reg.] At length I come To address thee once again with better omens. Reg. And whence thy joy, Licinius? Lic. In my heart The happiest hopes revive. For thee till now I've every means essay'd. Reg. For me, Licinius? Lic. For thee; and dost thou, at a time like this, Believe thy goodness lost to my remembrance? O! noâ'tis ever present: thou to me Wert patron, general, father. First by thee My feet were guided through the paths of honour; Thou gav'st me, sirâ Reg. [impatiently.] But say, in my behalf What hast thou done? Lic. Thy life and liberty I have defended. Reg. [disturbed.] Say'st thou? Lic. At the entrance I waited near the temple, where the Senate Are now assembled. Singly, as they pass'd, I urg'd the Fathers, and inspir'd in each The wish to serve thee. Reg. [aside.] Gods! what do I hear? [to Lic.] And hast thou thenâ Lic. Not I alone have labour'd; Let me not take the praise another claims: 'Tis true I've pleaded for theeâbut Attilia Has far out-gone Licinius. Reg. Who? Lic. Attilia. In Rome no daughter better loves a father. O! how she spoke; what eloquence display'd To wake the tenderest feelings! How she blended Her grief with modesty! and how employ'd, In every form, reproaches, prayers and praise! Reg. What said the Fathers? Lic. When Attilia sued, Who could resist?âBehold, she comes: observe What kindling joy in every feature smiles. SCENE V. Enter Attilia. Att. At length, my dearest fatherâ Reg. [severely.] Hast thou dar'd Again to see me? Ah! I little thought, Till now, to find thee leagu'd amongst my foes. Att. Who I thy foe, my father! Reg. Are not they My foes who rashly shall oppose my counsels? Att. Alas! is then my pious wish to save thee A proof of enmity? Reg. And know'st thou then What saves me, or destroys? Who call'd on thee To take a share in business of the state? Who made thee guardian of my destiny? And whenceâ Lic. O! sir, too farâ Reg. And speaks Licinius? His silence best would plead in his defence, As that might seem repentanceâMighty Gods! A daughter, and a Roman!â Att. As a daughter I deem'd, my lordâ Lic. And as a Roman, I Believ'd that thus to avert thy cruel fateâ Reg. Be silentâI no Roman deem The dastard advocate for shame; Be silent: mine I ne'er esteem A child who stains the Roman name. 'Tis now from you alone I find An anxious thought in galling chains; 'Tis now by you alone my mind, Amidst my freedom lost, complains. [Exit. SCENE VI. Attilia, Licinius. Att. Tell me, Licinius, dost thou think a maid Was ever born more wretched than Attilia? To love like me a father; to pursue All means to save him; for his sake to feel A heart transfix'd with anguish: these were virtue In others, but in me are deem'd a crime. Lic. Take comfort, my Attilia, nor repent Thy pious work. One duty calls on us, On Regulus another: if to him Contempt of life is glory, 'twould in us Be impious not to save him: thou shalt see He will be grateful: let not then his anger Distress thy gentle soul. The sick man oft The sage physician blames, and cruel calls The friendly hand that ministers his cure. Att. His keen reproaches pierce me to the heart; My courage shrinks before them. Lic. Tell me then Would you, for these, consent to lose a father? Att. O! no, still let him chide, but let him live. Lic. Believe me, he shall liveâAh! cease to weep, And be those lovely eyes again serene: To see thee mourn dissolves my firmest temper. On you, ye gentle stars of love, Depends a lover's fate: Too well your ruling power I prove; At will you every passion move, And every change create. When you with pleasure kindle bright My kindling spirits rise; But when a cloud obscures your light, With you my courage dies. [Exit. SCENE VII. Attilia alone. Alas! 'tis all too true: no bounds are set To Fortune's frowns or smiles: with lavish hand Her gifts she scatters; and she heaps affliction Beyond a mortal's sufferance. I, alas! Am now the hapless object of her anger. I see the skies around me veil'd in clouds, And who can tell what tempests they conceal? If other bolts you now prepare, Ye adverse powers, my breast I bare; On me your judgment I invoke, But save my father from the stroke. Respect, in that unshaken mind, An image of your heavenly kind; And leave to us a pattern here Of one who knows not guilt or fear. [Exit. SCENE VIII. A gallery in the same palace. Regulus alone. Why dost thou throb, my heart, and whence th' emotions Till now to thee unknown? Thou hast defied The rage of seas, the dangers of the field, With all the monsters bred on Afric's soil; And now thou tremblest in the bare expectance Of what thy fate determines. Thou indeed Hast cause for fear: till now was ne'er thy glory Expos'd to peril thus. Yet say, ye Powers, What is this glory? But a tyrant-passion, Which, like each rebel passion of the soul, Our reason must subdue? O! noâsuch language Befits the dastard: he in vain was born Who lives but for himself: 'tis glory teaches To hold another's good beyond our own. Whate'er on earth is priz'd to this we owe: This lifts our nature from the servile state Where men would rust without the sense of honour: This blunts the sting of pain; from danger takes The sense of fear; strips death of every terror; Enlarges kingdoms; gives to cities safety; Can savage customs change to gentle manners, And teach mankind to imitate the Gods. By thisâHa! Publius comesâhe seems to tread With timid stepsâWhat bring'st thou? Has the senate As yet decided? What is now my fate? SCENE IX. Enter Publius. Pub. O! sirâwhat tidings for a son to utter! [aside. Reg. Why art thou silent? Pub. Would to Heaven my tongue Were dumb for ever! Reg. Tell meâ Pub. Every offer The Senate have rejected. Reg. Then at length The happy Roman genius has prevail'd, Thanks to the Gods! I have not liv'd in vain. Goâseek Amilcar: nothing more is wanting; The work is now complete. We must depart. Pub. Unhappy father! Reg. Call'st thou him unhappy, Who at his latest hour can serve his country? Pub. I love my country: I lament thy bondage. Reg. Each has his bonds, since life is servitude; He that laments, let him lament the fate Of every one that's born, not, Publius, mine. Pub. The rage of these barbarians, O! my father, Will sacrifice thy life. Reg. And end my slavery. Farewellâbut let me now depart alone. Pub. And can you then refuse from me, my father, The last sad offices of filial love? Reg. For thee I've other duties. Whilst I hasten For my departure, thou remain to keep Disconsolate Attilia from my sight. Her grief would damp my triumph: ever duteous To me has been her love: should now her sorrows Exceed the bounds, bear, Publius, with her weakness, We must not from her nature hope to find A manly fortitude: do thou advise her: Let thy example teach her that submission The great occasion claims: direct, console her: Fulfil to her the office of a father. To thee I trust a daughter, and to thee I trust thyself, my Publius! Let me hopeâ But O! I see that nature struggles in theeâ I deem'd thy soul more constantâHave my thoughts Been then deceiv'd?âNo, Publius, thou art still The son of Regulus, the son of Rome. Be ne'er those pleasing hopes deceiv'd, Which from thy early years I drew: The deeds by patriot souls achiev'd With emulation now pursue. O! let me leave in thee an heir That well his father's love may claim; Nor ever give this cheek to wear, (Remembering thee) the blush of shame. [Exit. SCENE X. Publius alone. Take courage, Publius. Though thy task be dreadful Thou must subdue thyself: thy blood demands it; The blood of Regulus: his great example Before thy eyes now loudly calls upon thee. Thy heart, that yielded first to nature's impulse, Must act more firmly: imitate a father, And make amends for all thy former weakness. SCENE XI. Enter Attilia and Barce. Att. Is it then true, my brotherâ Bar. Publius, speak. Pub. It is most true: the Senate have decided, And Regulus departs. Att. O Heaven! Bar. What say'st thou? Att. Have all alike betray'd me? Bar. Is there thenâ Pub. Now nought avails. Bar. Have pityâO! Amilcar! [sees Amil. SCENE XII. Enter Amilcar and Licinius. Amil. [to Bar.] There is no longer hope. Lic. [to Att.] All, all is lost! Att. Where, where is Regulus? With him at least Attilia will depart. Pub. Forbear: this grief Will but offend thy father. Att. Hope not, Publius, To keep me longer here. Pub. I hope, Attilia, At length will yield to reason, and remember To her 'tis not permittedâ Att. I remember This, this aloneâAttilia is a daughterâ âLeave me. Pub. I must not leave thee. Att. But my father Meantime departs. Pub. Fear not he will depart While here Amilcar stays. Att. Alas! who now Will give me aid or counsel? Speak, Amilcar. Amil. Between contending passions I am lost. Att. What says Licinius? Lic. From the sudden stroke I scarce can breathe. Att. O! Publius. Pub. O! my sister, Exert thy firmer constancy. Our father Should teach us how to suffer adverse fortune: Those only merit to be call'd his children Who emulate his virtues. Att. Speak'st thou thus? Thou, that with mine should'st blend a brother's sorrows; Thou that should'st mix thy sighs and tears with mine. What means my Publius? Amil. Well I know the meaning. His love is fix'd on Barce; she departs If Regulus remain: behold the cause That gives this boasted fortitude to Publius. Pub. [aside.] Ye Gods! shall Publius hear and hear unmov'd That tongue's calumnious falsehood? Amil. Every power Of art and speech he doubtless has employ'd To make the Senate spurn th' exchange propos'd. Pub. A thought like this, Amilcar, well befits A barbarous son of Carthage. Amil. Yetâ Pub. No moreâ Now hear me speak: thou know'st the fate of Barce Is in my hands. Amil. I know it. As a gift Thy mother had obtain'd her from the Senate: She dying since, the maid beheld in thee Her future lord. Pub. Now mark how Publius uses The power that fortune gives him. More than life I love the charming Barce; but I love My honour more. I know with souls like thine Has virtue rarely credit: let me then In sordid minds expunge the least pretence For such suspicions. Barce, thou art free, Go with Amilcar, and return to Carthage. Bar. Ye Powers! can this be true? Amil. Such wondrous virtueâ Pub. Learn hence, Amilcar, how a Roman loves. [Exit. SCENE XIII. Licinius, Attilia, Barce, Amilcar. Att. [to Lic.] Behold the inhuman, how he leaves Attilia. [he not hearing her. Bar. [to Amil.] Heard'st thou not Publius? [he not hearing her. Att. [to Lic.] Yet thou answerest not? Bar. [to Amil.] Dost thou not hear, my love? Amil. Barce, farewell. [firmly. Await for my return. [going. Lic. Farewell, Attilia. [going. Att., Bar. Ah! whither, whither goest thou? Lic. [to Att.] To preserve For thee a father. Amil. [to Bar.] Regulus to save. Att. [to Lic.] Alas! what can'st thou do? Bar. [to Amil.] What means Amilcar? Lic. [to Att.] A desperate evil claims a desperate cure. Amil. [to Bar.] The Roman pride may rivals find in virtue. Att. [to Lic.] Ah! take me too. Bar. [to Amil.] Let me attend on thee. Lic. [to Att.] O! noâI then should tremble for thy safety. Amil. [to Bar.] No! thou must here remain. Bar. [to Amil.] And wilt thou not Reveal thy purpose? Att. [to Lic.] Wilt thou not at least Give me to knowâ Lic. [to Att.] Ere long thou shalt know all. Amil. [to Bar.] Confide in me. Lic. In Rome shall Regulus Be still detain'd or see Licinius perish. [Exit. Amil. Yes, Africa, like Rome, shall boast her heroes. [going he returns. If less our pride, not less our mind Can virtue breed; nor less we find By us is known the path to fame. Though from the capitol afar, Our worthies may with Rome's compare; And Gods extend their guardian care, To those who boast no Roman name. [Exit. SCENE XIV. Attilia, Barce. Att. O! Barce! Bar. O! Attilia! Att. Speak, my Barce. Bar. What can we hope? Att. Alas! I know not what. Doubtless Licinius, with the people means To raise a tumult: this may fatal prove To him and to his country, yet supply No aid to save my father. Bar. Struck with wonder At Publius' generous act, but deeply stung With his reproach, Amilcar goes to prove His soul as noble. What may he attempt, And to what dangers may he stand expos'd! Att. O! mighty Gods! assist my dear Licinius! Bar. And O! ye Powers, preserve my plighted spouse. Att. I shake with terror. Bar. Let us not, Attilia, Be abject in our fears: the heavens now shew A brighter aspect, and a ray of hope Gleams o'er the prospect. Att. True my dearest Barce, And yet I cannot raise my drooping heart. My hope is not the gentle beam Diffus'd from skies serene, But 'tis a short and languid gleam From troubled meteors seen. A gleam, we see by fits appear, That shines but to distress, That shews, alas! the danger near, But never makes it less. [Exit. SCENE XV. Barce alone. I seek to calm distress'd Attilia's bosom, Would heal her fears and tremble with my own. My heart was firmer when my hopes were less: Uncertain fear then only made me suffer For future ills; but now, alas! I dread To lose a bliss, I deem'd securely mine. Whoe'er his dangerous path pursues Through stormy seas, must risk to lose His life on faithless billows tost. But luckless he, who scapes in vain The dangers of the distant main, To find a shipwreck near the coast. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A hall with a prospect of the gardens. Regulus, African Guards. Reg. Why this delay? And knows not yet Amilcar The Senate's purpose? Whither is he gone? He must be found. Time warns us to depart. Since nothing more remains for him to hope Or me to wish, our longer tarriance here Is criminal in bothâAh! come, my friend, Come to my breast. [seeing Manlius. SCENE II. Enter Manlius. [Reg.] Without thy aid, my fame Had been in danger: 'tis by thee I still Preserve my chains: thou hast secur'd the fruit Of all my servitude. Man. 'Tis true, but yet Thou wilt depart: 'tis true, but we must lose thee. Reg. You lose me, Manlius, if I still remain. Man. Ah! why did I begin so late to love thee? Yet, Regulus, thou now receiv'st from Manlius Too fatal proofs of friendship. Reg. Greater proofs I ne'er could hope from him, whose heart sincere Names me his friend; but if the noble Manlius Would give me others, I shall task his friendship. Man. O! name them. Reg. Every duty thus fulfill'd The citizen demands; at length, remembrance Tells me I am a father. Well thou know'st I leave behind two children here in Rome: These, Publius and Attilia, next my country Are the dear objects of my heart's affection. By nature virtuous both, but both appear Two plants yet immature , that still require The cultor's watchful care. To effect this work Has Heaven to me denied. Take, Manlius, then The pious charge: do thou with usury Supply my loss, and to thy noble heart And prudent counsels let the father owe His glory, and the children every aid That youth derives from more experienc'd age. Man. I pledge my truth: with jealous care I'll guard, Thy dear remains; and both shall find in me If not as noble, yet as kind a father. I'll point them out the paths of Roman virtue, Nor arduous this will prove: suffice for souls By nature warm'd with every generous passion To hear the story of paternal deeds. Reg. Then there's no more to wish. SCENE III. Enter Publius in haste. Pub. Manlius! my father! Reg. What has befallen? Pub. All Rome is now in tumult; The people rave, and with a general voice Forbid you to depart. [to Reg. Reg. And can it be That Rome will e'er consent to such exchange, Injurious to her fame? Pub. No!âRome rejects Th' exchange and peace; but wills you to remain. Reg. Who? I remain? and where is then my promise? My solemn faith? Pub. Each one declares no faith Is due to those, who ne'er by faith were bound. Reg. Shall then one crime suffice to veil another? And who will e'er be guilty, if example Exculpates an offender? Pub. Now the assembly Of Augurs meet: the important question there Will be decided. Reg. Think not I have need Of oracles like these. Suffice for me My word is plightedâI shall hence depart. Rome may debate on peace, or on th' exchange; It rests with me to judge of my return; The first concerns the public weal, the last Respects myself alone: I am not now The thing I was at Rome; and none can claim A right to those who wear another's chains. Pub. At least hear what our Augurs may decree. Reg. No, Publius, if I wait for their decision I give my sanction to it. Guards lead on, [to the guards. Conduct me to the portâmy friend, farewell. [to Man. going. Man. No, Regulus, forbear. Should'st thou encounter The furious populace, by open force Thou may'st be here detain'd, and make, thyself, All Rome thus guilty of a breach of faith. Reg. Shall I then fail? Man. O! noâthou shalt depart. But let me first go hence to appease this tumult. The Consular authority shall check Such ill tim'd rashness. Reg. Manlius, on thy faith, I shall remainâbut ifâ Man. I understand thee: Enough; thy glory now is all my own, And well I know thy heartâon mine rely. On me rely, remember still I boast by birth a Roman name; Like thee, within my breast I feel The kindled warmth of glory's flame. 'Tis true that fate to me denies, Like thee such honour'd chains to bear; But though in vain such chains I prize, At least I merit such to wear, [Exit. SCENE IV. Regulus, Publius. Reg. And is it then so hard a task in Rome, Such labour to preserve our faith unshaken? Is thenâAh! Publius, still thou linger'st here, So little mov'd? And leav'st a friend alone To reap the fame of joining toils with mine? Go hence with him, make my departure sure: Fain would I stand indebted to a son For what secures my glory. Pub. Dearest father, I shall obey; but yetâ Reg. Why sighs my son? That sigh bespeaks a mind oppress'd with anguish Pub. Yes, I must own my suffering heart The cruel conflict scarce survives: But greater surely my desert To act, though griev'd, the Roman part, While duty with affection strives. What sacrifice had I to to make? What praises, father, claim from you, If passions, nature must awake, Which now I quell for glory's sake, Were not so painful to subdue? [Exit. SCENE V. Enter Amilcar. Amil. Then, Regulus, at lengthâ Reg. Without thy speaking I understand, Amilcar, thy reproaches. Heed not this tumult: Regulus alive Will not remain in Rome. Amil. I know not yet What tumult thou wouldst mean. I am not here On thee to vent reproaches: I am come For thy support. Think not on Tiber's banks Are heroes only born; since we no less Can boast, amongst us, souls to cope with theirs. Reg. It may be so: but 'tis not now a time For vain contention. Summon all thy train And see that each be ready to depart. Amil. First hear and answer me. Reg. [aside.] I'll tim'd delay. Amil. Is gratitude our glory? Reg. Gratitude Is sure a duty: but this duty now So little meets regard, that to fulfill it May well be titled glory. Amil. What if danger Attend the grateful? Reg. It may then be call'd A god-like virtue Amil. Then from me thou canst not With-hold this virtue: hear me now. Thy son, Touch'd for himself with sense of jealous honour, Resigns to me my Barce; yet his soul Adores the lovely maid: from him I caught The generous flame, and now am come to save For him a father, and expose myself To all the rage of Carthage. Reg. Wouldst thou save me? Amil. I would. Reg. And how? Amil. By leaving thee the means To escape at will. With art I shall remove These guards to distance. Cautious thou conceal Thyself in Rome, till, with dissembled anger, As if compell'd without thee to depart, I loose my anchors from the port. Reg. [aside.] Barbarian. Amil. What sayst thou? Speak. Art thou not struck with wonder At such proposal? Reg. Doubtless. Amil. Couldst thou e'er Have hop'd from me this offer? Reg. No, Amilcar. Amil. And yet my fate is not to be a Roman. Reg. Full well indeed I see it. Amil. [to the guards.] Leave us, guards. Reg. [to them.] Not one depart. Amil. And wherefore? Reg. Think me grateful For all thy kindness; but with thee I mean Again to visit Carthage. Amil. Dost thou then Despise my mercy? Reg. No: I pity thee, Thou know'st not what is virtue: thou hast now, With specious shew of zeal and seeming mercy, Degraded me, thy country and thyself. Amil. I, Regulus? Reg. Yes, thou:âwhat right is thine To give me liberty? Am I a slave To thee, or slave to Carthage? Amil. 'Tis not sure For thee to weigh if benefits receiv'dâ Reg. Great is indeed the benefit! to make me A criminal, a fugitive, a wretch Alien from truthâ Amil. Thy preservation now, Thy life's at stake. Thou knowst, at thy return What torments Carthage has for thee prepar'd. Thou know'st that there thou wilt to all be made A dread example. Reg. Dost thou know, Amilcar, What Romans are? And dost thou know they live, They breathe for honour. This the constant spur Of every deed, its object and its end? With looks unchang'd we here are taught to die, And every suffering scorn that gives us glory, While only base dishonour causes fear. Amil. High sounding words and flattering to the sense! With me they little weigh: I know that life Is dear to all, that thou thyselfâ Reg. Too much Thou dost abuse my patience. Let thy ships Approach the shore: collect thy scatter'd train, Complete thy task, barbarian, and be silent. Amil. Thy looks may thus intrepid show, Thy tongue insult a noble foe, And every foul reproach bestow Amilcar to defy. On Tiber's banks thy words severe Unanswer'd pass Amilcar's ear, But soon, rash man, expect to hear In Afric his reply. [Exit. SCENE VI. Enter Attilia. Reg. [to himself.] Publius not yet return'd? And Manlius too? [to Att.] Attilia! ha! what brings thee hither thus With hasty step, and looks of seeming joy? Att. Our fate, my father, now depends on thee. Observant of thy counsels, Rome rejects Th' exchange or peace; but thou may'st here remain. Reg. Yes, with the shameâ Att. O! no: on this the Senate Pronounce their sentence thus: it rests with thee To stay or to depart. âThine oath was pledg'd âWhen thou were captive, and a captive's oath âCan never bind himself.â Reg. Who fears not death Is always free, and he who shall, to excuse His actions, plead constraint, will but confess His own degenerate baseness. Regulus Swore what he will'd to swear, and having sworn, Will now depart. SCENE VII. Enter Publius. Pub. You hope it, sir, in vain. Reg. And what shall stay me then? Pub. The united people. My father, nothing longer can restrain them; All fly impatient to the port to oppose Your passage to the ships: the streets of Rome In other parts are all deserted now. Reg. And where is Manlius? Pub. He alone has dar'd To stem the general torrent; but in vain He prayers and threats employs; none hear his voice, And none obey. The people's headstrong fury Increases every moment. Pale with fear The lictors scarcely in their hands sustain The trembling fasces; and, in such distraction, Not one attends the consular command. Reg. Farewell, AttiliaâPublius, follow me. [going. Att. Ah! whither would you go? Reg. To assist my friend; To wipe away from Rome her foul disgrace; To keep for me the honour of my chains, And hence depart, or on these shores expire. [going. Att. Ah! no, my father, should you leave me thusâ [weeping. Reg. Attilia, to a daughter's tender name, Much to thy sex and years I have till now Indulgent givenâEnoughâno more of sorrowâ Let not thy woman's tears conspire with Rome To rob thy father of his promis'd triumph. Att. Alas! for me such anguishâ [weeping. Reg. Well I know Thy anguish is to lose me; but remember, Such trials wives and daughters oft must feel Who boast the honour of a Roman name. Att. All other proofs with joyâ Reg. What proofs, Attilia? Say, would'st thou go to meet the conscript Fathers Amidst the assembled senate, with thy counsels To regulate the destiny of Rome? Or rather with the helmet o'er thy brows, Would'st thou, in fighting to subdue the foe, Endure the toil of arms? If thou'rt unfit To meet misfortune for thy country's sake Without such abject weakness, tell me, daughter, What wilt thou do to serve her? Att. O! 'tis true. But yet such constancyâ Reg. It is indeed A virtue hard to practice: but, Attilia, Thou art my daughter and thou wilt attain it. [going. Att. Yes, all I can I'll imitate my father, Your great exampleâbut, O Heaven! you leave me, And leave me in displeasure!âI have lost Your wonted love. Reg. O! no, I love thee still: Believe me not displeas'd; and as a token, Take this embraceâyet let not this embrace Melt thee to softness, but inspire thy mind With fortitude and honour. Att. Ah! my father, You leave me thus, and leave without a sigh. Reg. I bear for thee a father's love, But little should a father prove, If leaving thee, I left behind Th' example of an abject mind. My breast, like every mortal, bears A heart that feels a mortal's cares; But passions in my heart obey, And rule in thine with tyrant sway. [Exit with Pub. SCENE VIII. Attilia alone. Be firm, my heart! And O! be banish'd far All weak affections; from their sources dry These woman's tears: enough of useless sorrow: Enough of cruel doubts. My native virtue Must kindle with a father's just reproof. Let not Attilia be the only branch Unworthy of the stock from which she springs. SCENE IX. Enter Barce. Bar. Is it then true, Attilia? In despite Of Rome's united people, of the Senate, The Augurs and his friends; of all the world; Will Regulus depart? Att. [firmly.] 'Tis all most true. Bar. But whence proceeds such unexampled frenzy? Att. With more respect let Barce speak of heroes. Bar. How! does Attilia then indeed approve Her father's blind perverseness? Att. I adore The unshaken virtue of a father's heart. Bar. A virtue that delivers him to chains, To hostile fury, and a shameful death. Att. Be silent. Know, those chains, that hostile fury, That shameful death, [she relapses into tenderness] will prove my father's triumph. Bar. Dost thou exult at this? Att. O Heaven! [aside, weeps. Bar. For me I never can conceiveâ Att. No: those who drew Their breath, ill-fated, in a barbarous clime, Conceive not how a daughter's mind enjoys A father's deathless name. Bar. And yet you weep? Att. Again may peace relieve the breast, When grief, that late each thought oppress'd, Is spent in kindly tears: As shines the sun serenely bright, Whene'er the cloud that veil'd his light In showers dissolv'd appears. [Exit. SCENE X. Barce alone. What strange ideas does the love of praise Excite in Rome?âWith envy Manlius views His rival's chains; while Regulus abhors The public pity that would save his life. The daughter glories in her father's sufferings; And Publius, (this surpasses all belief) Publius, my beauty's slave, for honour's sake. Resigns the mistress whom his soul adores. The heart that thus can love's desire Without a sigh resign, May shew a virtue I admire, But never wish it mine. In Rome a fond pursuit of fame May every thought control; But, thanks to Heaven, no Roman dame, I boast no Roman soul. [Exit. SCENE XI. Magnificent porticoes on the banks of the Tiber; ships ready for the embarkation of Regulus. A plank laid to the nearest ship. A numerous crowd of people that block up the passage to the ships. The Africans are seen on board. Lictors attending on the Consul. Manlius, Licinius. Lic. Rome never will consent that Regulus Should quit the port. Man. The Senate and myself; Are we no part of Rome? Lic. The united people Are far the greater part. Man. But not the noblest. Lic. At least more generous and humane. Inspir'd With love and gratitude, we seek to save The life of Regulus. Man. And weâhis honour. Lic. His honourâ Man. 'Tis enoughâI come not here To hold debate with theeâWhat ho! let each Leave free the passage. [to the people. Lic. Noâlet none remove. Man. 'Tis I command obedience. Lic. I forbid it. Man. Dar'st thou, Licinius, thus oppose the Consul? Lic. And dar'st thou, Manlius, thus oppose the Tribune? Man. Soon shall we seeâNow, lictors, clear the pass. [the Lictors raise their fasces and advance. Lic. Defend it, Romans. [the people prepare to oppose them. Man. O ye Gods! with arms Is thus my power resisted? Is it thus The majestyâ Lic. The majesty of Rome Dwells in the people: this thou hast insulted By such contention. People. Regulus shall stay. Man. [to the people.] Permit me but to shew what now misleads Your better judgment. People. Regulus shall still Remain. Man. Yet hear meâ People. Regulus shall stay. SCENE LAST. Enter Regulus, and with him Attilia, Amilcar, Publius and Barce. Reg. [entering.] Ha! Regulus shall stay! and is my sense Deceiv'd, or may I credit what I hear? Is perfidy requir'd? Requir'd in Rome? From me requir'd? What people has this land, This wretched land produc'd? What lips avow A wish so infamous? What heart conceives it? Where, where are now the noble race of Brutus, Fabritius and Camillus? Glorious names! Shall Regulus then stay? For what offence Have I deserv'd to merit thus your hatred? Lic. O sir! our love would break your cruel chains. Reg. And what were Regulus without his chains? 'Tis these will hand me down to latest times A great example; to my foes a shame; And to my country, honour: but of these Deprive me, what must Regulus be nam'd? A perjur'd slave, a worthless fugitive. Lic. Your word was plighted to a faithless people, And plighted when in bonds: the Augurs sayâ Reg. No more. O! let us leave to savage nations, The untutor'd Arab, and the cruel Moor, Such shameful pleas to sanction breach of faith. Be Rome to all the world a pattern still Of uncorrupted honour. Lic. What may Rome Not fear to lose, in losing thee, her father? Reg. Let Rome reflect that father is but mortal; That now he stoops beneath the weight of years; That life creeps languid thro' his shrivell'd veins; That he no longer now can shed his blood, Or toil for her; that nought for him remains But, as a Roman ought, to meet his end. Heaven opens to me now a splendid path; I now can close my latter days with glory: It cannot beâI know, I know too well The hearts of Romans. Every one whose birth Gave him with me to breathe one common air That fans the Capitol, from Regulus Will not in thought dissent. I know that each Applauds me in his heart with generous envy; That midst th' emotions, by a tender feeling Unwarily betray'd, he breathes to Heaven His ardent vows for fortitude like mine. No more of weakness then, but cast to earth Those ill-tim'd weapons. O! delay no longer The triumph I have sought. My friends, my children, My fellow-citizens! I, as a friend, Entreat of each; as citizen exhort you, And as a father let me now command. Att. [aside.] O Heaven! already each obeys his mandate. Pub. O! mighty Powers! see every hand disarm'd. Lic. Behold the pass is clear'd. Reg. Accept my thanks, Propitious Gods! the path is free. Amilcar, Ascend thy ship, I follow where thou lead'st. Amil. [aside.] I now begin to envy what I hear. [ascends his ship. Reg. Romans, farewell! and let our parting now Be worthy of us. Thanks to Heaven! I leave you, And leave you Romans. Ah! preserve unsullied That mighty name, and be the arbiters Of human kind, till all the world become, By your example, Romans. Guardian Gods! That watch this happy land; protecting Powers Of great Ãneas' offspring! I intrust To you this race of heroes. Still defend This soil, these dwellings, these paternal walls. O! grant that valour, glory, constancy, Justice and truth may ever here reside; And should some evil star, with adverse beams E'er threat the Capitol, see, mighty Gods! See Regulusâlet Regulus alone Be made your victim, and the wrath of Heaven Be all consum'd on my devoted head: Let Rome unhurtâbut why those tearsâ âFarewell! Chorus. O! thou, the glory of our clime, Father of Rome, farewell! By thee our triumphs snatch'd from time What future tongues shall tell? But dearly must the glory cost To Rome that loses thee: An age again shall scarcely boast A Regulus to see. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
