      <field name="fulltext">THE ROYAL SLAVE. A Tragi-Comedy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGVE TO THE KING AND QVEENE. The first Appearance a Temple of the Sun. One of the Persian Magi discover'd in a Temple worshipping the Sunne, at the sight of a new Majesty leaves the Altar, and addresseth himselfe to the Throne. From my Devotions yonder am I come, Drawne by a neerer and more glorious Sun. Hayle Ã´ ye sacred Lights; who doe inspire More than yond holy and eternall Fire. A forreine Court lands here upon your Shore, By shewing its owne worth to shew yours more: Set here as Saphires are by your Queen's veines, Not to boast Colour, but confesse their staynes. No matter now for Art, you make all fit; Your Presence being still beyond all wit. Whiles by such Majesty our Scene is drest, You come both th'Entertainer and the Guest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGVE TO THE VNIVERSITY. A Priest discover'd as before. After our Rites done to the King, we doe Thinke some Devotions to be paid to you. But I could wish some Question hung up there, That we by Genuine sounds might take your eare. Or that our Scene in Bodley's Building lay, And th'Metaphysickes were cast into a Play. To please your Palates I could wish there were A new Professour, Poet of the Chayre. But as where th'Earth cannot ascend, we know The Sun comes downe and cheeres her here below: So we (the Stage being ayr'd now, and the Court Not smelt) hope you'le descend unto our sport; And thinke it no great trespasse, if we doe Sinne o're our Trifle once againe to you. 'Tis not the same as then, that glorious Prease Did passe both for the matter, and the dresse. For where such Majesty was seene, we may Say, the Spectators only made the Play. Expect no new thing yet; 'tis without doubt The former Face, only the Eyes put out. But you adde new ones to it, being sent As for our grace, so for our supplement. We hope here's none inspir'd from late damn'd bookes, Will sowre it into Tragedy with their lookes; The little Ruffe, or Carelesse, without feare May this securely see, securely heare. There's no man shot at here, no Person's hit, All being as free from danger, as from wit. And such should still the first adventures be Of him, who's but a Spy in Poetrie. No Envy then or Faction feare we, where All like your selves is innocent and cleare. The Stage being private then, as none must sit, And, like a Trap, lay wayte for sixpence wit; So none must cry up Booty, or cry downe; Such Mercenary Guise fits not the Gowne. No Traffique then: Applause, or Hisse elsewhere May passe as ware, 'tis only Iudgement here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue to their Majesties at Hampton-Court. Most mighty King, and Most gratious Queene. The rites and Worship are both old, but you Have pleas'd to make both Priest and People new. The same Sun in yon Temple doth appeare; But they'are your Rayes, which give him lustre here. That Fire hath watch'd e're since; but it hath been Onely Your gentler breath that kept it in. Things of this nature scarce survive that night That gives them Birth; they perish in the sight; Cast by so far from after-life, that there Is scarce ought can be said, but that they were. Some influence yet may crosse this fate; what You Please to awaken must still come forth new. And though the untouch'd Virgin Flow'r doth bring The true and native Dowrys of the Spring; Yet some desires there are perhaps, which doe Affect that Flower chaf'd and sully'd too: For in some bosomes stucke, it comes from thence Double-perfum'd, and deeper strikes the Sense. And we are bid plead this; fore-seeing how That which was fresh ere-while may languish now. Things twice seene loose; but when a King or Queene Commands a second sight, they're then first seene.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Habits Persian. The Scene Sardis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. Sce. 1. 2d Apperance, a City in the front, and a Prison on the side. Philotas, Stratocles, Leocrates, Archippus singing in the Prison, Molops harkning without. Mol. These wicked Ephesian Captives, are most everlasting Tipplers; I charm'd my fleas with'em last night, and left them too I'm sure well to live, and yet they're at it againe this morning. Slaves within. Hem! hem! hem! A pox on our Gaolor. &amp;c. Mol. So! now they're tuning their Pipes. O the Religion of these Greekes! they sing and drinke downe the Sunne, and then they sing and drinke him up againe. Some drunken Hymne I warrant you towards now, in the prayse of their great huge, rowling, Tunbellyed god Bacchus as they call him. Let's hearken a little. The Slaves song within. âA pox on our Gaolor, and on his fat Jowle Mol. That's that's I. âTher's liberty lyes in the bottome o'th' Bowle. âA figge for what ever the Raskall can doe, I againe: good good, âOur Dungeon is deepe, but our Cup's so too. âThen drinke we a round in despight of our Foes, âAnd make our hard Irons cry clinke in the Close. Mol. Wondrous good I faith! These fetter'd Swannes chant it most melodiously before their deathes. Sure there is a great deale of pleasure in being hang'd; for I have observ'd it e're since I was a little one, that they alwayes sing before they goe to't. But here's that will spoyle your voyces my Friends. Phil. Who's there? Mol. Your friend at a dead lift; your Landlord Molops. Phil. Now grand Commissioner of fate; what wouldst thou have Heyre apparent to Pluto? He opens the dore, and the Slaves enter. Mol. Come forth; and if you can endure to read, shews 'em a halter. her's a Persian line in my hand will instruct you. Stra. Guardian of Ragges and Vermin, Protect our of halfe-breeches and no shirts, what's thy Raskalship's pleasure? Mol. Good words Sir, good words: I am your Destiny, do you not see your Thread of Life here? Leoc. Yes, yes, 'tis of thy wives one twisting, good Molops, I know the Promotion of your Family: she came from the Web-errantry of highway-Inkle, to the domestique turning and winding of home bred Hempe, and thence gets a three-halfe penny Legacy at the departure of every wrong'd Sinner. Archip. And as for thy selfe, had not that weighty bulke of thine crack'd so many Gibbets, that the King began to feare his Forrests, thou had'st never been preserv'd to whiffle plagues as thou usher'st us to the Barre, and take away the Judges stomackes as often as they come to eate upon Life and Death, and celebrate the Funerals of distressed Gentlemen. Mol. You dying men may be impudent by your places, but I'd wish you to compose your countenances and your manners both, for the King is comming to visit you. Phil. What mak'st thou here then? though I easily beleeve thou hast an ambition to be seene in good company, yet prethee be gon, and don't discredit us. The King loves no Garbidge-tubbes. Mol. The King shall be inform'd of the fowle words you give his Officers. Stra. Why what can he doe? he won't let us goe and conquer us againe, will he? Leoc. But good honest Landlord, what's the Kings intent to honour us with his Royall visit? Archip. To assigne us perhaps some three or foure hundred stripes a day a peece, to take downe my Landlord's body, and make him in case to suffer what he hath beene long adjudg'd to. Mol. No, Saucines, 'tis to make one of you King. Arch. Then, Saucines, know your Masters. Mol. Be not mistaken: 'tis not any way to honour you, but to make himselfe sport. For you must know, that tis the custome of the Persian Kings after a Conquest, to take one of the Captives, and adorne him with all the Robes of Majesty, giving him all Priviledges for three full dayes, that hee may doe what hee will, and then be certainly led to death. Phil. Will he allow so long? I'd give my life at any time for one dayes Royalty; 'tis space enough to new mould a Kingdome. His Majesty useth us wondrous reasonably; I'd as liffe deale with him as any man I know. But who's to have our cloaths, Sirrah, when we have done? Mol. 'Tis a small fee that the State hath entayl'd upon my Place an't please you. Phil. By my troth I guess'd so: I was wondring how their Courtiers could goe so brave with so little meanes. Stra. Well, what must be, must be. I was affraid I should have dy'd a silly foolish old Animal, call'd Virgin. But now, have at one of the Ladyes e're I goe: I have a strong desire to leave some Posterity behind me. I would not have the house of the Stratocles decay for want of Issue. Leoc. If I have the fortune of't, I'le Revell it all night; Kings they say, ought not to sleep for the good of the people. Arch. Sirrah Gaolor, see you send Mistris Turne-key your wife to take us up whores enough: and be sure she let none of the young Students of the Law fore-stall the Market. Mol. Peace, the King approaches: stand in your rankes orderly, and shew your breeding; and be sure you blow nothing on the Lords. Sce. 2. To them Arsamnes, Praxaspes, Hydarnes, Masistes, Orontes, Priests; after a while Cratander. Arsam. Are these the fairest, and the handsomest 'mong all the Captives? Mol. There is one more which I set apart; a good personable fellow, but he's wondrous heavy and bookish, and therefore I thought him unfit for any honour. Arsam. Goe call him forth; there's none of all these has A Forehead for a Crowne; their blood runnes thicke, As if 'twould blot a sword. [Enter Mol. with Cratander. See, there comes one Arm'd with a serious and Majestique looke, As if hee'd read Philosophy to a King: We've conquer'd something now. What readst thou there? Mol. I beleeve hee's conning a Hymne against the good Time. Crat. 'Tis a discourse o'th' Nature of the Soule; That shewes the vitious Slaves, but the well inclin'd Free, and their owne though conquer'd. Arsam. Thou dost speake As if thou wert victorious, not Arsamnes. Crat. I not deny your Conquest, for you may Have vertues to entitle't yours; but otherwise, If one of strange and ill contriv'd desires, One of a narrow or intemperate minde Prove Master of the field, I cannot say That he hath conquer'd, but that he hath had A good hand of it; he hath got the day, But not subdued the men: Victory being Not fortunes gift, but the deservings Purchase. Arsam. Whom dost thou call deserving? Crat. Him, who dares Dy next his heart in cold blood; him, who fights Not out of thirst, or the unbridled lust Of a flesh'd sword, but out of Conscience To kill the Enemy, not the man. Who when The Lawrell's planted on his brow, ev'n then Under that safe-protecting Wreath, will not Contemne the Thunderer, but will Acknowledge all his strength deriv'd, and in A pious way of gratitude returne Some of the spoyle to Heav'n in Sacrifice; As Tenants doe the first fruits of their Trees, In an acknowledgment that the rest is due. Arsam. True, Tell me, wert thou then to pay thy vowes, What wouldst thou sacrifice? the best, or worst? Crat. The best, unto the Best. If I had destin'd An Oxe unto the Altar, he should be Faire, and well fed; for th'Deity doth not love The maymed, or mishapen, 'cause it is A thing so different from himselfe, deformity Being one of Natures trespasses: he should Be crown'd then, and conducted solemnly, That my Religion might be specious, 'Twere stealth else, not Devotion. Arsam. Bravely sayd. But (t's pitty) thou hast reasoned all this while Against thy selfe, for our Religion doth Require the Immolation of one Captive; And thou hast prov'd that he is best bestow'd That best deserveth to be spar'd. Crat. I could Tell you, the Gods have neither appetite Nor entralls; that they doe not hunger after Your Cookery of sacrifice, and that A graine of Incense, or a peece of Gumme, If offer'd with Devotion, may redeeme A destin'd Hecatombe. But this would be To deprecate my fate; which by your Sun, Your Sun that doth require me, I expect With the same minde, as I would doe my Nuptialls. Arsam. And so't shall come, thy shape and vertues doe Enrich and furnish thee for Heav'n. I would Or thou hadst fled, or I not conquered. Adorne him with Robes. But thou must sweare First to be faithfull to the State. Crat. I sweare. [He kisseth the Scepter. The Priest's song whiles he puts on the Robes. âCome from the Dungeon to the Throne âTo be a King, and streight be none. âReigne then a while, that thou mayst be âFitter to fall by Majesty.

Cho: âSo Beasts: &amp;c. Arsam. Now then, Cratander, I doe here indulge thee All the Prerogatives of Majesty For three full dayes; which being expir'd, that then Thou may'st fall honourably, I intend To strike the blow my selfe. [Ex. Arsam. Crat. I neither take New courage from the Power, nor suffer new Feares from the Death that waytes it: both are things That have two eares, by which they may be taken; So that they are indifferent in themselves; And only good or bad as they are order'd. Off with their shakells Sirrah: you my Lordes Take order they be quickly well attir'd, That they may come to Court, and doe us service. 'Tis next of all our Royall pleasure, that Battle be re-inforc'd by the next Sun, To make our Conquest perfect: all's not safe Till the Snake leave to threaten with his tayle. Our Reigne is short, and businesse much, be speedy. Our Counsels and our deeds must have one birth. [Ex. Crat. Mol. If you'l make use of any Ornaments, I've a couple of Jack-chaynes at your service. Come Gentlemen, please you to follow, I'le give you ease of your Irons suddenly. Phil. Sirrah be quicke, that my foot may be at liberty to kicke thee. [Ex. Mol. and Slaves. Prax. Whether tends the minde of this ambitious wretch? H'hath thoughts so hasty, and so large, as if Hee'd over-runne the whole world in a breath. Hyd. I like the courage of the man: methinkes H'hath given a tast, how worthy he is of A longer Kingdome. Masist. You'l obey him then? Hyd. I don't obey Him, but the King; as they that pay their vowes Unto the Deity, shrowded in the Image. Masist. True, 'tis the King's will he should be obey'd But hee's a Slave; the man lookes personable, And fit for Action, but he is a Slave. He may be noble, vertuous, generous, all, But he is still a Slave. Oron. As if the sullying Must turne all purer mettle into drosse; Or that a Jewell might not sometimes be In the possession of a private man. Mas. What? you too for the rising Sun my Lord Though't be but a Meteor cast from the true one? If that the conquer'd Hart must lead the Lyon, I'le teach my wishes to runne thwart unto That large successe you looke for. Prax. Be my feares No Omen to the Kingdome, Ã´ yee Gods, But I suspect, this Comicke folly will Sport our free Monarchy into a Nation Of cheated Slaves. But peace; the Queene. Oron. We two Will goe, and see his carriage. Prax. Doe my Lords; And cause you wish his State so well, pray see The Slaves provided of their cloathes. [Ex. Oron. Hyd. Sce. 3. To them Atossa, Mandane, Ariene. Atos. Y'have seene This Three-dayes King my Lords? I cannot sport At th'Miseries of men: methinkes I feele A touch of pity, as often as I view him. How doe you thinke hee'le beare his State? Mas. As Schoole-boyes In time of Misrule, looke big awhile, and then Returne dejected to the Rod. Mand. I wonder No woman's chosen Queene for company. These Male wits are but grosse and sluggish; fayth You'd see a delicate Comedy, if that A she wit might but Impe his Reigne. Prax. O Madam! Your Sexe is too imperious to Rule; You are too busy, and too stirring, to Be put in Action; your Curiosity Would doe as much harme in a Kingdome, as A Monkey in a Glasse-shop; move and remove, Till you had broken all. Arie. Thinges then it seemes Are very brittle, that you dare not trust us. Prax. Your Closet and your Senate would be one; You'd Gossip at the Councell-table, where The grand contrivance of some finer Posset Would be a State affaire. Mand. I never knew But this one difference yet 'twixt us and you: Your follies are more serious, your vanities Stronger, and thicker woven; and your Councels About the razing of a Fort or City, Contriv'd as ours about a messe of spoon-meat; So that you laugh, and are laugh'd at againe. Atos. I hope you doe but exercise, your wits Are not at sharpes? Mand. Wee'le venture how he will, Foyles, or bare poynts we care not. Atos. Cease the strife. How's this Cratander qualify'd, my Lords? What vertues has he? Mas. No great store of vertues; Hee's a tough fellow, one that seemes to stand Much on a resolute carelesnesse, and hath A spice of that unnecessary thing Which the mysterious call Philosophy. Here comes a couple can informe you better: They have observ'd the thing. Sce. 4. To them Hydarnes, Orontes. Atos. My Lords, what thinke you Of this new King? what doth he do? what is he? Hyd. Hee's one that knowes, and dares preserve his own Honour, and others too; a man as free From wronging any, as himselfe; he beares A Kingdome in his looke; a kingdome that Consists of Beauty, seasoned with Discretion. His Graces are virile, and comely too: Grave, and severe delights so tempering The softnesse of his other pleasures, that A settled full content doth thence arise, And wholly take up the beholders thoughts. Arie. Why then hee'le turne the Scene; we did expect Something that would have saved us the labour Of reading Play-bookes, and Love-stories. Oron. See, How you're mistaken Madam: he doth carry All things with such a State, and yet so free From an insulting Pride, that you'd conceive Judgement and power put into the Scales, And neither overpoysing, whiles he shewes Rather that he can rule, then that he will. Mas. Th'afflicted ne're want prayses. O how false Doth th'Eye of pity feel the only way To make the Foule seeme gratious, is to be Within the ken of death; he that e're while Would have beene thought a Monster, being now Condemn'd to die, is thought an Hero. Mand. Truly, I thinke you have not yet beene neare your death. Mas. I've beene but seldome with your Ladyship. Atos. Away, let's goe and view againe: he promiseth Something that is not sport: If he doe well, And keepe his vertues up untill his fall, I'le pay a good wish to him as hee's going, And a faire mention of him when he's gone. [Ex. Atos. Mand. Arie. Sce. 5. To them Arsamnes. Arsam. How doth our new King beare his Royalty? Prax. If he goe stil on thus, his three daies folly Will fill your Annalls. Mas. He is growne the talke And sight of all the Court: h'hath eyes chayn'd to him, And some say hearts; nor are they meane ones, such As he may steale without being miss'd, but those The theft of whom turnes sacriledge. Arsam. I hope Atossa is not in the Rowle; he dares not Be favour'd by my Queene. Hyd. Her pure Affections Are sacred as her Person, and her thoughts Soaring above the reach of common Eyes, Are like those better Spirits, that have nothing Of Earth admixt, but yet looke downe upon Those number of Inhabitants, and where They see a worthy minde oppress'd, vouchsafe At least to helpe with pitty. Arsam. Doth she then Seeme to compassionate his fortune? we Must watch his Actions narrowly. Prax. He may Grow insolent else past remedy: but yet Your Majesty hath a preventing eye. He may, when that his Channel's full, discharge His streames on all that's round him, rushing forth With a strong headlong Torrent, as mischeevous As uncontroulable, th'ungratefull waters Choaking ev'n that which gave 'm life; but yet You can kill evils by first seeing them. Oron. All this hath taken up but one Eare only; The other, and the softer is reserv'd. Religion, and your word (which, equally As that, is binding) are both past for three dayes: To cut him off before, were to abridge Your Triumph, and Devotion. Arsam. He must live And Reigne his time prescrib'd; but he must not Performe the Actions he intends. Let then All the delights and pleasures, that a Slave Admires in Kings be offer'd. Though an hundred Still watchfull eyes beset his head, yet there Is one way left; Musicke may subtly creepe And rocke his senses so, that all may sleepe. [Exeunt. Finis Act. 1.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. Sce. 1. 3d Appearance a stately Palace. Cratander. Cra. Perish their Tables, and themselves: a Throne May stand without those tumults of delights, That wayte on big and pompous Luxury. I'le crosse their expectation, and quite banish All that their weaker mindes do thinke delight. Kings pleasures are more subtle, then to be Seen by the vulgar; they are Men, but such As ne're had any dregges, or if they had, Drop'd 'em as they were drawing up from out The groveling Prease of Mortalls. To offend Beyond the reach of Law without controule, Is not the Nature, but the vice of Pow'r; And he is only great, that dares be good. Sce. 2. To him Praxaspes, Masistes. Prax. He weares a serious looke still; we may hope As soon to calme a Tempest with a song, As soften him. Mas. Beasts and hard Rockes have both Been mov'd, and by his Country-man. Let's try. That we may some way, Sir, expresse our service Unto you, with intent you may not feele Bare honour only without the delights, We have provided you a taste, of our Best Persian Musicke. Crat. That's an innocent pleasure; Sphears make it, and Gods heare it. Prax. Boy come in. Sce. 3. To them Two women and a boy, as he is preparing to sing, Atossa, Mandane, and Ariene appeare above. Prax. Your last new song, that which I gave you Sirrah. Atos. See yonder where he sits; let's stand and see How hee'le behave himselfe; the Lords have vow'd To try him to the utmost. Mand. I begin To feare that he is mortall. Prax. Come begin Boy singes. I Come my sweet, whiles every strayne Calls our Soules into the Eare; Where they greedy listning fayne Would turne into the sound they heare; Lest in desire To fill the Quire Themselves they tye To Harmony, Let's kisse and call them backe againe. 2 Now let's orderly conveigh Our Soules into each other's Brest, Where interchanged let them stay Slumbring in a melting rest. Then with new fire Let them retire, And still present Sweet fresh content Youthfull as the early day. 3 Then let us a Tumult make, Shuffling so our soules, that we Carelesse who did give or take, May not know in whom they be. Then let each smother And stifle the other, Till we expire In gentle fire Scorning the forgetfull Lake. Crat. I did expect some solemne Hymne of the Great world's beginning, or some brave Captaines Deserving deeds extoll'd in lofty numbers. These softer subjects grate our eares: But what Are these my Lords? shee Minstrells? Mas. Consequences, Which we out of that duty which we owe you Thought a fit present, that you might not want Any delight that Persia yeelds. Crat. I have No humane thought about me now, forbeare. Prax. You are no Statue Sir? or if you were, These yet methinkes might melt you. Crat. If you will Needes put your selves to th'trouble of Procurers, Bring me a Kingdome in one face, or shew me A People in one body; then you might Happily worke on mine Affections. There I durst powre my selfe into Embracements, Loosing my selfe in a Labyrinth of joy. As 'tis you only make me colder, by Surrounding me with these your hostile flames. Mas. I hope you doe conceive it our Affection, And duty to your Scepter. Crat. Let me aske you. Was't not enough you try'd me with those baytes Of wines, and meates, cull'd from the spoyle of Nature, But you must bring vice in another fashion? Prax. Will you then let your dayes passe sluggishly, And reape no pleasure from your Pow'r? Crat. 'Tis one To punish such offenders as your selves, That will abase your honour to so vile And abject an imployment. If you offer The like againe, you shall perceive, that Kings, How short so e're their Reignes be, have long hands. This Act, what e're you stile it, is flat Treason. Our Honour is abus'd in't. O the foreheads Prax. and Mas. steale out, and leave the two women with him. Of women once growne impudent! that these Can stand so long, and heare their infamy Debated quietly, expecting when They shall be call'd to their reproach! what fled? And left the Prey behind to tempt me? Ho! Who waytes without? Conveigh these wicked creatures Unto the Gaolor Molops: give him charge To use them as he would doe Enemies. My Country would twice suffer, should I yeeld Unto their vices too. But Greece is not Only preserv'd in me: had they perhaps Carry'd these Creatures to the wilder knot, Headlong Archippus, or bold Stratocles, Easie Leocrates, or prone Philotas, Their Present might have hit. But hearke, they come: I'le step aside, and watch their actions. Exit. Atos. What doe you thinke Mandane? is he mortall? Sce. 4. Philotas, Stratocles, Leocrates, Archippus, in rich Persian Habits. Str. How far do we out-shine the Persian Court? See what good cloaths can do. I thinke there are not Foure properer Gentlemen walke the streets. Phil. The Ladyes certainly must love us now. Leoc. But are you sure they'le passe this way? Arch. Yes, yes. Let's to our stations, and be ready to Accost 'm at the first approach. Atos. Mandane, Doe you and Ariene step downe to em, And try their Courtship. Mand. All I thinke be safe. Arie. Cratander is hard by; ne're fear; let's down. They descend Str. I wonder none passe by yet: sure theyl'e send Tickets unto us, to invite us to Their Lodgings the back-way. Arch. Ne're doubt it Man, They'le come themselves; for proofe behold. [Ent. Mand. Arie. Leocr. Halfe booty; Equall division Gentlemen. Phil., Str., Arch. Agreed, agreed. Phil. Nay, start not Ladyes, we are men. Arie. 'Tis well You tell us so before hand, we might else Thinke you disguised Satyres, come on purpose To put the Nymphes to flight. Leoc. We are not hairy; We have no Tayles, I'm sure. Arie. Truly if Satyres And you were in one Market-towne, I thinke You might see one another for nothing. Str. Doe you Take us for Monsters then? Mand. Pray heav'n we don't Discover 'em in your Manners. Arch. We are come Not to disturbe, but heighten your delights. Mand. Can you shew any trickes then? Arch. Love-trickes Lady. Arie. Can you run through a Hoope? or fetch up mony With your eye-lids backward? Mand. Can you peirce your Tongue, Or cut your Throat, and yet live after it? Str. Do y'thinke us Tumblers then, or Jugglers? Mand. Both; And truly these would please us farre above Your Love-trickes. Leoc. Shall I draw some Ribbon then Out of my Throat? Shall I cast a Lock upon Your pretty cheekes, or seale your lovely lippes Up? Arie. What will content you when you have done? Leoc. A kisse. Mand. We doe not use to grant such favours gratis. Leoc. What will you take to give one then? Mand. A Muffler. Phil. I perceive you are well skill'd In the whole course of Love, you but keepe off To make delights more sweet. Arie. You would doe well To doe so too. Phil. Why Madam? doe not feare me: I snore not in my sleepe; this Nose of mine Will not proclaime. Mand. 'Tis something Trumpet-like; I would not trust my selfe with such an Instrument. Methinkes 'tis somewhat guilty. Phil. How I love This pretty, pettish, froward, wanton anger? Give me a Pleasure that I struggle for. That Favour's genuinely sweet, that's wrested. Str. Feare him not Madam; I'le be your defence; My soule is link'd and chayn'd unto your Tongue. Arie. You speake in a fit dialect; you rellish O'th' Language of the place whence you came lately. But to be serious now awhile, pray speake, What doe you see in us fit for desire? You cannot love us possibly. Str. By this kisse. Arie. Stand off. Arch. And this. Mand. Your Oath's not good in Law. Tell us, what wrong hath either of us done you, That you should seeke thus to revenge your selves? Phil. You are too scornefull, we too easie; come Let's hurry 'em to some place of secrecie, Where all their scoffing shan't prevaile: you two Quickly seize her. Arie., Mand. Helpe, helpe. Sce. 5. As they carry out the Ladyes, Cratander meets them. Crat. Yee Villaines hold. What is the matter? why this violence? Leoc. A little Love-sport only; we were arguing Pro, and Con out of Plato, and are now Going to practise his Philosophy. Arie. What they stile Love-sport only, and misname An arguing out of Plato, would have prov'd A true and downe-right Rape, if that your presence Had not become our Rescue. Crat. Wicked Villaines, That in your miseries can't forget your vices, Acting those crimes to day, which e're the Sun Thrice set, will elsewhere be your Torture. Cannot The chayne and hunger kill those seedes of evill, But even in the midst of your misfortunes, Your sports must be the robbing of faire honour. And Rapes your Recreations? which, an't please The Gods, you call Philosophy. Leave the place; Infection's busie where you breath; the next Attempt installs you in the Dungeon. [Ex. 4. Slaves. Mand. Most worthy Sir, your Noblenesse hath showne A minde beyond your fortune: though it be not Reall as we could wish it, yet beleeve it You hold a perfect Royalty in the hearts Of those, whose honours you have now preserv'd. Crat. I owe this duty to your vertues Madam. [Ex. Mand. Arie. These Slaves must be repress'd; the giddy People Are ready to transpose all crimes upon Him that should moderate them; so perhaps Their faults might be accounted mine. Besides Snares are laid close in every path for me; And if a King but stumble, 'tis a Precipice: When all eyes see't, a blemish is a Monster. Pure vertue then, and thou faire honour, give me Leave to c?template on your Beauties; let As he is musing, Atos. from above throwes him a gold chayne. The strength of my Imagination dwell Upon the sight of your Divinities. What? more temptations yet? ha? whence? from whom? The heav'ns I hope don't drop downe follies too: No arme out of the cloudes! a chayne? why this Is but an Exprobration of my late Distressed fortune. 'Tis rich yet, and Royall; I 'cann't be the wealth of any, but the Throne. Fall out what will, I'le weare it, 'till I know From whence it came; and if it prove a Mettle That some foule drossy minde could not endure Should longer dwell with it. I then will cast it With as much scorne and anger from my shoulders, As now I doe receive't with admiration. Sce. 6. To him Hippias, Phocion. Hip. Looke, there he walkes alone considering; Let's to him while we may; good day Cratander. Crat. Good Hippias, Phocion! you are welcome; how Dare you trust your selves in an Enemies Court? Pho. We passe disguis'd to see what will become Of our Affayres; and being the future state Of Ephesus depends on you, are come Only to give you notice of it, for We doe presume you're not to be intreated To doe us good. Crat. Alas! I am not, after The period of three dayes; this makes the time Which even now I thought an age, seeme short And too contract for my desires. Pho. When you Should raise your Country struggling in the dust, The time is short, and too contract; 'tis long Enough to lead an Army out against it, To crush those Reliques of an halfe-life, that Her doubtfull body faintly breaths; you may With that right hand spin three dayes to the space Of many Olympiads. Crat. What is your meaning? Pho. Have we endur'd the hate, and felt the fury Of violent Arsamnes so long? have we Suffer'd his sword untill it did grow blunt, And rather broke, then wounded? have you try'd The weight and strictnesse of the Persian chayne So long, and aske us now, what is your meaning? Come, come Cratander, I could chide you, but That I beleeve you only hide the good That you intend your Country, that it may not Be disappointed; you may safely tell us You will betray the Persians into our hands, That we may gather forces, and prepare Against their comming. Crat. Oh! is this your Errant? Here, take your chayne againe, it cannot binde. Hip. How e're don't exprobrate our Poverty, Though all our wealth hath been the Persians spoyle. Crat. Why you threw't in before you, to make way Unto your Suit. Hip. Is it not lawfull to Salute the Persian Mock-King, thinke y', unlesse We bring a Guift? I'd thought the name of Ephesus. Had priviledg'd our accesse. Thinke on the honours, The long continuing honours, that you shall Receive at home; thinke on those numerous teares That you shall wipe away from flowing Eyes, At the first sight of Liberty. Pho. Your approach Will entice Cities out of Houses; th'aged, And the young too; the Matron, and the Virgin, All mingled in a blest confusion, Will in a solemne full Procession come, And with that great Religion bring you in, As if their Captive Gods were brought them backe. Come then a King home, that went'st out a Slave. Crat. I am so still; no sooner did I come Within the Persian Walles, but I was theirs. And since, good Hippias, this pow'r hath only Added one linke more to the Chayne. I am Become Arsamnes Instrument: I've sworne Faith to his Scepter and himselfe, and must Aske his leave, e're I doe betray his Country. Hip. You're free enough against us. O the justice Of an unnaturall Sonne! yet aske your selfe; Ought that be ratify'd that's done by force? Crat. As if the valiant could be forc'd by any. Pho. You shall not change your fortune, you shall only Passe to another Empire; and for that Right may be violated. Crat. Empires are Desir'd for glory; be all wickednesse then Farre absent, for in that there can be none. Pho. You are resolv'd to reason your selfe then Into a measur'd unthankefulnesse? what can Hinder this good t'your Country, but your selfe? Fear'st thou the Thunder, and the Gods? the anger O'th' Grecian Pow'rs will be upon thee, if Thou not restor'st them to their seats. On then, Thou undertak'st their cause, thou fight'st their warre. Crat. I cannot tell what powers you pretend; Tell me of Justice and Fidelity, These are the Grecian Gods. Pho. Be then thy name Blasted to all Posterity, and let Our wretched Nephewes, when their Soules shall labour Under the Persian Yoake, curse thee, and say, This slavery we owe unto Cratander. Crat. Pray stay, I will goe with you, and consider, How am I streightned! Life is short unto me: And th'good man's End ought still to be a businesse. We must dy doing something, least perhaps We loose our Deaths; we must not yet doe ill That we misplace not Action: If I strike On this hand, I'm a Parricide; if on that, The same brand waytes me too: how doe I tremble, Like to the doubtfull Needle 'twixt two Loadstones, At once inclining unto both, and neither! Here Piety calls me, there my Justice stops me. It is resolv'd; Faith shall consist with both; And aged Fame after my Death shall tell, Betwixt two sinnes, Cratander did do well.

Set a watch at the doore, to keepe out sleepe; He's mortall that offers to betray so much weaknes As to winke. Here Archippus. Arch. May not a man winke without mortality, When he lets it goe downe? Here Stratocles. Phil. I doe state winking in that case divine: Str. Come thou uneven lumpe, thou heape of sinnes in proofe; we will liquor thy Keyes, open thy Cages, and give thy meager Tenants a Play day, Raskall. Bring the Jarres nearer. As I hope for fortune, I thinke my soule will passe into a frogge. Now for a hundred Throats; to thee Molops. Mol. You Grecians I thinke have sponges in your mawes; 'tis but setting your hands to your sides, and squeezing your selves and presently you drinke as much as before. Leoc. Off with thy Cup Landlord, and talke not; wee learn'd it from the Teat, soole. Mol. Have at thee, Archippus. Arch. I doe not like these healths at randome; let's have a sober methodicall order for a while. Phil. What? shall we drinke by dice then, and let fortune name the heyre to the Cup? Str. Or shall we drinke our Mistresses names, and soake it Alphabetically? Leoc. If we drinke names, let not the Letters passe for single ones, but as they would in number: I doe pronounce Alpha no letter till it begin to multiply. Mol. I never thought Drinking such a Mystery before; a blockhead can't be drunke, I see. Phil. Right; shallow braines can ne're attaine to't; that makes your fooles, and your old governing Philosophers continue so sober still. The veget Artist, and the vigorous PoÃ«t, whose braines are full and forging still, will streight get a pleasant madnesse from that that will but warme those colder Rheumaticke Sages, whose noses alwayes drop like Still-snoutes. Str. The noblest drinking methinkes is the Postures. Arch. Let's have'em Phil. Bring the Pots in play. But where's the wenches, and the Musicke you promis'd us, good Molops. Mol. For wenches, the Towne will not yeeld any at this time; and I durst not venture my single wife amongst you all. For Fidlers, I have provided them, they stand ready without. Leoc. Call'em in sweet Molops. Strat. Well, what shall those Raskalls play, whiles we drinke the Postures? Phil. The Battle by all meanes. Ent. Mus. Str. Strike up the Battle then. Thinke your selves all in service now, and doe as I doe. Take your Bowes Gent: and make a stand. They take their pots in their left hands. They take their cups in their right hands, &amp; fill. They blow off the froth. Right! draw your shafts now, &amp; nock 'em. Very good! now smooth your feathers. Well done! Present, and take ayme. Here's to thee Leocrates. Leoc. Have towards thee Philotas. Phil. To thee Archippus. Arch. Here Molops. Mol. Have at you Fidlers. Str. Now draw your Bowes and let loose all. They drinke all together. Mol. The other charge, good fellow Souldiers. Phil. Let's have a Song betweene, and then have at you. Leoc. Fidlers, employ your Throats and sing awhile; you shall drinke with 'em after. Str. Sing that which I made in the Prison; 'tis seasonable enough. Song. 1. Now, now, the Sunne is fled Downe into Tethys bed, Ceasing his solemne course awhile. 2. What then? 'Tis not to sleepe, but be Merry all night, as we; Gods can be mad sometimes, as well as men. Cho: Then laugh we, and quaffe we, untill our rich noses Grow red, and contest with our Chaplets of Roses. 1. If he be fled, whence may We have a second day, That shall not set till we command? 2. Here see A Day that does arise Like his, but with more eyes, And warmes us with a better fire, than hee. Cho: Then laugh we, &amp;c. 1., 2. Thus then we chase the night With these true floods of light, This Lesbian wine, which with it's sparkling streams, Darting diviner Graces, Cast's Glories round our Faces, And dulls the Tapers with Majestique Beames. Cho: Then laugh we, &amp;c. Str. Well said! now the other charge to the honour of Cratander. Phil. I feele a rumbling in my head, as if the Cyclops were forging Thunder in my Braines: But no matter, give it me: our ancient Orpheus sayes it, Perpetuall drunkennesse is the reward of Vertue. Sce. 2. To them Cratander. Crat. Which the most vitious have: must I still meet Some thing must greeve me more than your misfortunes? The Chayne and Fetter were your Innocence. Phil. We don't fire Temples Sir: we kill no Father Nor Mother, 'tis not Incest to be merry. Crat. But to be drunke is all. Doe but consider, (If that at least you can) how Greece it selfe. Now suffers in you; thus, say they, the Grecians Do spend their Nights: Your vices are esteem'd The Rites and Customes of your Country, whiles The beastly Revelling of a Slave or two, Is made the Nations Infamy. Your wreathes Blush at your Ignominy: what prayse is't When't shall be said, Philotas stood up still After the hundreth Flagon; when 'tis knowne He did not so in warre? you're now just fit To teach the Spartan boyes sobriety; Are all good Principles wash'd out? how e're Be without vices, if not vertuous. That I should have authority to command Vices but not forbid 'em! I would put you Once more into his charge, but that you would Make even the Dungeon yet more infamous. Mol. Gentlemen heare me; Cratander [Ex. Crat. Speakes well, and like a good Common-wealth's man. Arch. Out you dissembling Raskall; are you of Cratander's faction. Mol. Good Gentlemen don't kicke me: I shall leave all my drinke behind me, if you doe. [Ex. Mol. Phil. Must we still thus be check'd? we live not under A King, but a Pedagogue: hee's insufferable Leoc. Troth hee's so proud now he must be kill'd to make a supper for the immortall Canniballs, that there's no Ho with him. Arch. I never thought he would have beene either so womanish, as to have been chast himselfe, or so uncivill as to keepe us so: but hee talkes of lying with surpriz'd Cities, and committing Fornication with Victory, and making Mars Pimpe for him. Str. These are the fruits of Learning; we suffer all this meerely because he hath a little familiarity with the Devill in Philosophy, and can conjure with a few Notions out of Socrates. Arch. In good troth I take it very scurvily at his hands. that he will not let me deserve hanging. I'd thought to have done all the villanies in the world, and left a name behinde me: but hee's severe forsooth, and cryes out Vertue, Mistris Vertue. Phil. Diseases take her; I ne're knew any good she did in Common-wealth yet. I wonder how he dares be so impudent, as to be good in a strange place. Did not you marke his Rhetorique cast at me? I was the Butt he shot at.âWhat prayse is't, When't shall be said Philotas stood up still After the hundreth Flagon, when 'tis knowne He did not so in warre?âmeere, meere upbrayding: And shall Philotas this? this from Cratander? Sce. 3. To them Praxaspes, Masistes. Prax. Whence this deepe silence? are you sacrificing To your dumbe Gods of Greece? where are your Cuppes? Your Loves, your Madnesse? Leoc. Do not Ravish me; I will cry out a Rape, if that you come Within twelve foot of me; we must be modest, Modest an't please the Gods. Mas. Fy! fy! We look'd, you should Have left at least a dozen of great bellies A peece behinde you upon every Tribe. Where are your Spirits? had I been in your case, Nature e're this had been inverted. But You thinke on your last end, as if the world Were to expire with you. Str. O! we must walke Discreetly, looke as carefully to our steps, As if we were to dance on ropes, with Egges Under our feet: we have left off shackles, To be worse fetterd. Prax. Can a brest of large And ample thoughts tamely endure the ring? And be led quietly by th'Patient Nose, When Licence is Religion? One whose dull And sluggish temper is call'd wisdome, one Whose indiscretion kill'd with some formality, As Quicksilver with fasting spittle, doth passe For a grave governing Garbe. This heavy lumpe Dulls all your active fire. Mas. You understand not: For to what end is Liberty indulg'd? To be oppress'd by a severer Rule? One newly taken from among your selves, To make your state worse by his Tyranny? But you shew what you can endure. Phil. By Heav'n We doe enslave our selves; We can b'as free As is Cratander, though not so malitious. Mas. You are as things of nought with him; for tell me; When call'd he Stratocles to Councell? when Ask'd he Leocrates his advice? Philotas, Archippus, names excluded from his thoughts, But when he meanes to shew that he hath anger. Phil. What Star wert thou borne under Stratocles? Str. That which all Governours of Market-townes are, Some lazy Planet, I beleeve. Phil. Thou 'wert wont To exercise upon a throat or two, To keepe thy hand in ure; now shew thy selfe Let's slit this graver weazen. Prax. Now I see You have some man about you, now your blouds Run as they should doe, high and full; you slept Meerely till now. If that Cratander should Quit scores with Nature e're his time be out, The King must chuse againe; the dead you know Ne're goes for Sacrifice. Leoc. Must one of us Peece up his Reigne then? Prax. There's no other way; The Gods themselves require't. Leoc. My Hanches quake, As if that Molops were to season them, And put 'em streight in paste for the great Gods Phil. Who e're Succeeds him, shall allow the rest what e're Nature or Art can yeeld. Nothing shall be Unlawfull, but to sleepe and mumble Prayers. Arch., Strat., Leoc. Agreed, agreed. Cratander is discover'd over-hearing them. Phil. Then fill me out an Oath. All I presume will binde themselves with this Good common looser of all cares, but what Do tend to Liberty to doe the like. Str. The motion's worthy; crowne the Goblet then. Phil. Would 'twere his bloud. By Truth her self th'Ofspring And childe of Wine, Cratander dyes e're halfe The glasse of his short Tyranny run out. This th? to the infernall Gods. [powrs some on the ground] &amp; this [he drinkes. To our just angers, Gods as great as they. Good Omen! so! the thickned streames run black; 'Twas bloud methought I dranke: 'twere Lazynes To say, he shall be dead; hee's dead already. Drinke and prepare for Pleasures. [They all drinke. Omnes. Liberty. [Exeunt. Sce. 4. Cratander, Atossa. Crat. He must be more than Man that gaynes it backe Without my will. Atos. Your Justice must restore it. Will your severer Majesty triumph, With soft spoyles of a Lady's Cabinet? Crat. As I would not feigne Favour, and be-ly A Jewell or a Twist, to gaine the name Of Creature, or of Servant unto any; So by your Beauty, (for if Persians may Sweare by their Sun, I well may sweare by that) Where honour is transmitted in a true Mysterious Gage of an Immaculate minde, I will defend it as some sacred Relique, Or some more secret pledge, drop'd downe from Heav'n, To guard me from the dangers of the Earth. Atos. But in that You make it common, you bereave it of All that you call Divinity. Crat. He that vaunts Of a received Favour, ought to be Punish'd as Sacrilegious Persons are, 'Cause he doth violate that sacred thing, Pure, spotlesse Honour. But it may be seene, And yet not prostitute. I would not smother My Joyes, and make my happinesse a stealth. Atos. How your thoughts flatter your deceived Fancy Into a State, that when you leave to thinke, Dyes, as your thoughts that kept it up! what is't That you call joy and happinesse? Crat. I must Confesse, I have no Merits, whose just heat May extract ought from you, call'd Love: yet when I doe consider, that Affection Cannot looke vertuously on any thing That is resplendent, but a subtle image Purely reflecting thence, must needs arise, And pay that Looke againe; I doe take leave To say, the carefull Deities provide, That Love shall ne're be so unhappy, as To want his Brother. Atos. Why? I never spent A sigh for you; you never had a kisse, Nor the reversion of one yet. Crat. Such Love Is but Love's Idoll; and these soft ones, that Confine it to a kisse, or an embrace, Doe, as the superstitious did of old, Contract the Godhead into a Bull, or Goat, Or some such lustfull Creature. Be it far, Be't far from me to thinke, where e're I see Cleare streames of Beauty, that I may presume To trouble them with quenching of my thirst. Where a full splendor, where a bright effusion Of immateriall Beames doe meet to Make up one Body of perfection; I should account my selfe injurious Unto that Deity, which hath let downe Himselfe into those Rayes, if that I should Draw nigh without an awfull Adoration. Which my Religion payes to you: but being You like not the Devotion, be content To slight the Sacrifice, but spare the Altar. Atos. I am so farre from ruining that Breast In which there lives a sparke of chaster honour, That I would hazzard this so priz'd a trifle, Which men call Life, that I might live there still; And prove that Love is but an Engine of The carefull Pow'rs, invented for the safety And preservation of afflicted goodnesse. Conceive not hence a passion burning toward you; For she that speakes like woman, is a Queene. Crat. I can distinguish betwixt Love, and Love, 'Tweene Flames and good Intents, nay between Flames And Flames themselves: the grosser now fly up, And now fall downe againe, still cov'ting new Matter for food; consuming, and consum'd. But the pure clearer Flames, that shoot up alwayes In one continued Pyramid of lustre, Know no commerce with Earth, but unmixt still, And still aspiring upwards, (if that may Be call'd aspiring, which is Nature) have This property of Immortality Still to suffice themselves, neither devouring, And yet devour'd; and such I knowledge yours. On which I looke as on refin'd Ideas, That know no mixture or corruption, Being one eternall simplenesse; that these Should from the Circle of their chaster Glories Dart out a beame on me, is farre beyond All humane merit; and I may conclude, They've only their owne Nature for a cause, And that they're good, they are diffusive too. Atos. Your tongue hath spoke your thoughts so nobly that I beare a pity to your vertues, which E're night shed Poppy twice o're th'weary'd world, Must only be in these two Registers; Annalls, and Memory. Could you but contrive, How you might live without an injury Unto Religion, you should have this glory, To have a Queene your Instrument. Crat. There's nothing Can wooe my heart unto a thought of life, But that your presence will be wanting to me, When I'm shut up in silence: yet I have A strong Ambition in me to maintaine An equall faith 'twixt Greece and Persia: That like a river running 'twixt two fields, I may give growth and verdure unto both. Praxaspes, and Masistes, potent Lords, Are both 'gainst my designes; so that I shall not Obtaine an Army, for they thinke I have That vile minde in me to betray this kingdome. To which I've sworne fidelity; when by Your selfe, by all thats good, my 'intent is only To perfect great Arsamnes Conquest, and In that be beneficiall to my Country. In which if that your Majesty will descend To act a part, after the Scene is shut, I'le downe t'Elysium, with a joyfull minde, And teach our Grecian PoÃ«ts your blest name And vertues, for an everlasting Song. Atos. Were it against my selfe, I'de not deny it. Walke in, I'le follow you. In great designes. [Ex. Crat. Valour helps much, but vertuous Love doth more. Sce. 5. To her Arsamnes. Arsam. Was't not enough that you perus'd his Actions, And surfetted your Eyes upon his follies, Seeing, and seene againe, but you must cast him A Chayne, an Emblematicke Chayne? Atos. 'Tis not The veyle that hinders the quicke busie Eye From reading o're the Face, but Modesty. He hath a weake defence, that doth entrust The preservation of a chaster Love Unto a silken Cloud. Arsam. I stand not much Upon the commerce of your Eyes, but 'tis Your Chayne.âYour Favourâthatâ.Do'y'thinke 'tis fit A Queene should send one linke unto a Slave? Atos. Doth not the Sun (the Sun, which yet you worship) Send beames to others than your selfe? yet those Which dwell on you loose neither light, nor heat, Comming not thence lesse vigorous, or lesse chast. Would you seale up a Fountaine? or confine The Ayre unto your walke? would you enjoyne The Flow'r to cast no smell, but as you passe? Love is as free as Fountaine, Aire, or Flower. For't stands not in a poynt; 'tis large, and may, Like streams, give verdure to this Plant, that Tree, Nay that whole field of Flow'rs, and yet still runne In a most faithfull course toward the bosome Of the lov'd Ocean. Arsam. But when you divert And breake the Streame into small Rivulets, You make it runne more weake, then when it kept United in one Channell. Atos. If it branch Into a smaller twining here, and there, The water is not lost, nor doth it quit The former Name; this is not to destroy, But to enlarge the streame: did it dry up, And leave the Fountaine destitute, indeed You'd reason to be angry. Arsam. But what should make you Present him with a guift? you might have smother'd A good opinion of him in your Breast, (As some digressing streames flow under ground) And so have rested; but you shew it now, And make the world partaker. Atos. Who would stifle An honest Fire? that flame's to be suspected That hides it selfe. When that a man of valour Graceth his Country with a good attempt, You give a Sword, an Horse, a Mannoure, nay Sometimes a whole Province for reward. We have A sense of Vertue too, as well as you: And shall we be deny'd the Liberty To shew we have that sense? A Favour is The Almes of Love; I doe not passe away My heart in Charity. Vertuous Cratander Shewes forth so full a Transcript of your life, In all but his misfortunes, that methinkes You may admire your selfe in him, as in Your shade. But yet let chast Atossa rather Not be at all, than not be wholly yours. Arsam. Thou art still vertuous my Atossa, still Transparent as thy Crystall, but more spotlesse. Fooles that we are, to thinke the Eye of Love Must alwayes looke on us. The Vine that climbes By conjugall Embracements 'bout the Elme, May with a ring or two perhaps encircle Some neighbouring bough, and yet this twining prove. Not the Offence, but Charity of Love.

That we have naturally a desire To preserve Honour is a Principle Not questionable, but by those that would Corrupt, and rob us of it: that you prize Your Chastity more than wealth, and thinke your Cabinets Cheape and unworthy, if compar'd t'your mindes, I'm so assur'd, that I need only tell you The danger, not intreat you to avoyd it. The Slaves next night intend a Rape upon Your Honour, and your Wealth; to tell your Husbands Were to procure a slaughter on both sides. If we avert the ryot, and become Our owne defence, the Honour, as the Action, Will be entirely ours: which may be done Only by flying to Arsamnes Castle. A thing so easy, that 'twill only be To take the Ayre for fame: and when we doe Returne, our Husbands shall strew prayses in Our wayes, which we will tread on, and contemne. Omnes. Let's fly, let's fly, let's fly. Atos. How I doe love These worthy, noble thoughts! the Action Will make our Tombes not need an Epitaph, When we shall live still fresh in History. The sacred Gods of Marriage will present Themselves unto you night by night for this, And personally thanke you in your Dreames, For thus preserving their Rites undefil'd. But time is short, I must away, to make Provision for our flight. If any doe Desire a further satisfaction In this our grand designe, we leave our Ladyes Mandane here, and Ariene, who Can give a full relation of our businesse. Omn. Away, away, to the Castle, to the Castle. [Exeunt. Sce. 2. Cratander, Hippias, Phocion. Crat. Vrge me no more, I am sure my Countrey Requires not Perjury. Pho. Ought any word Be kept with Enemies? no path is foule That leades to liberty. Crat. O Phocion! Such men as you have made our Grecian faith Become a Proverbe t'expresse Treachery. An Oath's the same in Persia, and in Greece: And bindes alike in either. Hip. But consider Wee're thrall'd and yoak'd; the hard gaines of our sweat Must be sent in to serve their Luxury. Tribute, and taxe, and payment, will still keepe us As in a siege: to take the Aire perhaps Will be a charge unto us. Pho. Nor is't Ephesus That only dreades this slavery; Claros too, And Colophon, nay Magnesia, and others That joyn'd i'th' warre do feare a share i'th' Tyranny. Crat. Your forces are so weakned, that you cannot Regaine a perfect Liberty: your Friends Begin to fall off too: all that you can Expect now, is to settle these your evills, And live protected as a weakned friend Under the Persian shelter: still preserving Your Lawes and Liberties inviolate. A thing perhaps yet rather to be wish'd for, Then compass'd. Hip. Yet methinkes you might procure it, Having such command. Crat. What may be done in so Short space, shall all be to your good: goe then And deale discreetly with the Army: tell them The tempest that is falling on their head, Unlesse the Persian shield them. When you have Perswaded them to this, conduct your Forces Towards Arsamnes Castle, where the Queene, And Ladyes now expect me. But be sure You come not within sight of Sardis. Pho. Why? Shall we not march beyond the Fronteirs then? Crat. By no meanes, for you'le cut off all retreat. Now, when you see the numerous Persian come, You may securely fly without the losse Of any; this will quell the future rising Of those, whose frowardnesse is not content Either with th'Calme or Tempest of Affaires. We must comply with Fortune, now wee're conquer'd. Permit the rest unto the Gods and me. Pho., Hip. Successe attend it. [Ex. Hip. Pho. Crat. So; my next care now Must be t'avoide those Slaves, who, I o'reheard, Have a designe upon my life. But let Even the plotting Destinies contrive, And be themselves of Councell, all their malice Shall only shew an idle fruitlesse Hate, Whiles Wisedome takes the upper hand of Fate. [Exit Cratander. Sce. 3. 4t h Appearance, a Wood. Leocrates, Archippus, after a while Philotas, and Stratocles, all foure disguis'd in beggars habits; one having a leg, another an arme ty'd up: all some counterfeiting trick of such maunding people. Leocrates and Archippus peepe out of the woods side at severall places. Leoc. Holla! Arch. Holla! Leoc. Archippus? Arch. Leocrates? Ne're be afraid man, 'tis I, the very same. Leoc. Fore Mercury I did not know thee: thy comming forth out of the wood with that raw arme, and those totter'd cloaths, makes thee shew like Action, newly reviv'd after his worrying. Arch. Where's Stratocles, and Philotas? Leoc. They're looking Bur-leaves perhaps for Excoriation; or else, obbing some Gibbet to accommodate themselves with decent weeds. Phil. Holla! Stra. Holla! Arch. Hearke: I heare 'em; they are hard by; let's answer 'em. Holla! Stra. O are you there? Leoc. Save thee Brother Stratocles: Joy to thee Valiant Philotas; I commend you that you keepe your wordes: I'm glad we are so punctuall. Stra. D'ye thinke we have no Religion in us? 'tis a most corrupt time, when such as we cannot keepe touch, and be faithfull one to another. Leoc. But are you sure Cratander will passe by this way? Arch. My Lord Praxaspes sayes he loves this walke. Str. But wee've done ill to leave our weapons yonder. Leoc. Pish! he won't passe by this houre, hee's busie yet: Wee'le fetch 'em as soone as wee can agree who shall doe the deed. Phil. Who shall doe the deed sayst thou? why thou, or he, or he, or I. Leoc. Do thou then if thou hast a minde to't. Phil. No faith, thou shalt have the whole honour of it to thy selfe; I will not rob thee of an inch of it: I am not envious, Leocrates, not envious. Leoc. Well; the next Passenger is to decide it then; hee that shall be judg'd the fittest to make a Persian Priest, must do the deed. Str. What else? dost thou thinke we will be so base, as not to stand to Covenants? Phil. You have all made your selves very unfit to bee Preists methinkes. Str. Why so Philotas? do you not see woodden legs, and Crutches, wry Neckes, and lame Armes, maym'd limbes; and blind sides? Phil. Good faith, we may be all taken for an Hospitall broke loose. Arch. And we have wood enough among us toâ Cratan. is discover'd walking toward them. As I hope for Mercy Cratander.âby the ball of Fortune here hee comes: Soule of my life what shall we doe? Str. Not a sword, not a knife among us! all left behind us in the wood! that we should be all manicled now, out of a most unluckly Policy! We shall never have him alone againe: make toward him and be hang'd, that hee may resolve the Question howe're. Sce. 4. To them Cratander. Leoc. Blesse thy senses and thy limbes, faire Master: doe a courtesie to a company of poore distressed Persians; 'tis not mony we aske, nor cloaths; only thy Judgement, thy Judgement, man of Understanding. Crat. What's your request? Leoc. That out of thy great Wisdome, soule of Learning, Thou'd'st be pleas'd to tell us freely, which of us foure is fittest to make a Persian Priest. Crat. I am not well skill'd in your Persian Rites, As Cra. views th? narrowly, they fall to their Postures. I know not what Man, or how qualify'd Your Temple may admit of, but I have Two or three Servants within call here, they Shall umpire this your variance. Ho! Sisarmes, Ho! Artobazes, draw nigh quickly; seize [Ent. Servants. These foure pernitious Raskalls: did you thinke You could ly hid? 'tis not your leg good Stratocles, Nor your close arme Leocrates, that can Disguise you from mine eye. I can tell you Who dranke my death, who were your grand Abettors, In this designe. You now would know who's fittest To make a Persian Priest: Malitious fooles, Is it not all one as to aske me, who Is fitt'st to Sacrifice me? But you see I live, and will doe, to your Punishment. Goe, away with 'em; take them as they are. Let 'em not alter either Cloaths, or Posture, But lead 'em through the City thus to Molops; And give him charge to keepe 'em so, untill He heare our farther Pleasure. [Ex. Crat. Serv. Come along, Gentlemen, wee'le try your stumps, How many miles a day you can halt. Str.

There's not a woman left man; all are vanish'd. And fled upon the sudden. Hyd. What? I hope They have not chang'd their Sexe all in a minute? They are not leap'd into rough chinnes, and Tulipants? Hyd. There's scarce a face without a beard appeares. Mas. A signe there are few Eunuches in the Palace. Hyd. My Lords, This is not to discover what's become of 'em. They've taken weapons with 'em too they say. Prax. They have no Sacrifice to performe, that I Can tell of, neither if they had, would they Take armes, that were t'invade the Deity. The Sword's no Instrument of their Devotion. To them a Messenger. Mess. My Lords, you must make haste with all your force: To th'Queene and Ladyes in Arsamnes Castle: They now are likely all to be surpriz'd, By the remainder of the Greekes. Prax.

Atos. Where Goodness is to suffer, I would willingly Become the Sacrifice my selfe to free it. Crat. Had great Arsamnes beene in danger, had Your whole Line beene in jeopardy of ruine, You could have done no more; Your pity hath Thrust you into Heroick Actions, farre Beyond the eager Valour of try'd Captaines; Which I can never worthily admire, When I consider your reward will only Be, to be rank'd in story with a Slave. Atos. I do't not to the Man, but to the Vertue. The deed's reward enough unto it selfe. Crat. 'Twould be a peece of exemplary Ingratitude, To bring you into any danger hence: You're safe as in your Court; your Subjects shall not Run any doubtfull hazard, in the Chance Of an uncertaine Battle: their first step Shall be Victorious: and when your Eloquence, Guarded with Beauty, shall procure the freedome Of our Enthralled City, the Ephesians Shall know a Goddesse greater than their owne, And you depose our magnify'd Diana; Having Shrines in every Breast out-shining hers.

Can you containe Sir? looke how proudly hee Sits in the midst, hemm'd in on every side With Beauties, which his wheeling eye runs o're All in a Minute. Mas. Here's a delicacy That ne're was practis'd by a Captive yet, Nor heard of since the Custome first began, That Conquer'd Slaves should personate their King. Arsam. The Luxury and Ryot of arm'd Love! O that mine eyes could dart forth peircing Lightning! That I could shoot some quicke invisible Plague Into his boyling marrow. Hee is seated So, that a Dart or Arrow cannot reach him, Without the danger of a Persian breast, Worth all his Nation. But why name I worth, Where I see so much Infamy? O Atossa! Is this your amity to Vertue? this The Pity that you lend afflicted goodnesse? There's worke enough now for my sword, although The Enemy approach not. Credulous woman, Descend, Arsamnes calls thee; if he be A Name regarded when Cratander's by. Atos. Most vertuous Sir, you may expect perhaps Atossa's breast growne strange, and wrested from Her wonted faith; but witnesse O thou Sun, Whom with a pious eye I now behold, That I have neither try'd t'unty, or loosen That sacred knot: but what I've condescended To ayde thus farre, is only a faire likenesse Of something that I love in you.

Alas! you know not what you aske, the Gods Permit not that he live; he falls to them. Crat. You must not heare her, Sir, against the Gods, Who now expect their solemne Feast and Banquet. Atos.

Arsam. I may not Afflict him with a Court'sie; it can't be A Guift, that he must be compell'd to take. Crat. 'Tis the best time to fall, when there are most Requests made for our preservation. Though, great Atossa, I could wish that your Blest Pray'rs were spent in gaining a good peace For hopefull Ephesus. The Gods that doe Require my ruine, would accept their safety. Arsam. He durst not be so bold, unlesse h'were Innocent. Atos. Will you be so ungratefull then, Cratander, As after all to cast away your selfe? Forbid him good Arsamnes, by these Teares I aske you:âbut I am too womanish. Oron. Your Majestie is not Rock: you had a Nurse That was no Tyger; looke but up upon her. Hyd.

And yee the Soules Of my deceased Country-men, who fell In the last Battle, if there yet be sense In the forgetfull Urne, know that it was No stratagem of mine to be detayn'd Thus long from your Society. Now to you, Arsamnes: Good Kings equall those in Lawes Whom they have overcome in war; and to The Valiant, that chiefe part of good, to which We all are borne, sweet Liberty, is pleasing Ev'n in the Enemy. Your Queene, and others Her Ladyes here, with the most beautifull Part of your Royall Court, are in my pow'r. But farre be't from me t'injure but the meanest: Only one life I'm so much Master of, (Since you have put it in my Pow'r) that I Must give it backe againe, if it must be Beyond the Ephesian safety: the Altar comes More welcome than the Throne, if this shall bring Freedome to me, and Slav'ry to my City. Atos. Here I must dwell, Arsamnes, ty'd by great And solemne Vowes, (our Gods do now require it) Till you shall grant that the Ephesians may Still freely use their antient Customes, changing Neither their Rites nor Lawes, yet still reserving This honest Pow'r unto your Royall selfe, To command only what the free are wont To undergoe with gladnesse. I presume You scorne to have them subject as your owne, And vile as strangers, Tyrants conquer thus. Arsam. It is a time of Mercy; you have only Call'd forth those Favours which were freely comming. These generous thoughts have added to our Conquest. It is no Victory, that's got upon The sluggish, and the abject. Descend then; And when wee've joyn'd our hands, as Pledges of Our hearts combining so, let us returne To th'Celebration of an equall Triumph, In an united marriage of our joyes. Crat. There I confesse a Conquest, where I finde He that subdu'd my body, gaines my minde. [Ex. Arsam. and Lords, as to the Ladyes. Sce. 4. Molops, Philotas, Stratocles, Leocrates, Archippus. Mol. Nay, remember you kick'd me Gentlemen. Arch. Faith Landlord Molops, I'd have sworne thou hadst beene of a better Nature, than to remember Pot-quarrels. By my troth I should have kick'd my Father in that humour. Mol. Well you collogue now: say I should present you to Arsamnes and Cratander, what would you doe? Leoc. Only welcome their returne with a Dance, that so we might friske into Liberty. Mol. Yes, and kicke me againe. Str. Dost thou thinke we are Rogues and Villaines? Mol. Well, with all my heart, but upon this Condition. that you unty neither Leg, nor Arme; you know Cratanders charge. Phil. Dost thou thinke wee'd bring thee into any danger? We have study'd the Figure, and the Measure already. Mol. You must let the two old women dance with you. Phil. Who, the two whores that Cratander committed? Mol. The very same. They are wondrous sutable now: for you must know, that when such slippery Eeles doe come under my fingers, the first thing that I doe, is to strip 'em and to put 'em into other cases. You'le make a most perfect Gobline's Masque among you. Str. Why? they will fall in peeces, If they stirre but any thing violently. Mol. No matter for falling in peeces; I'le pawne my word to you, they shall not sweat. Leoc. Any thing, good honest Molops, we are content. Mol. You, within there, Polecats; do y'heare? I have procur'd so much of the Gentlemen, hold your breaths be sure, and remember you doe not drowne the Musicke with your Coughing. [Exeunt. Sce. 5. 6t h Appearance, the Court againe. Arsamnes, Cratander, Atossa, Lords and Ladyes as Victorious; to them after a while Molops. Ars. Whiles thus we're joyn'd we are too hard for fortune, Scarce Heav'n it selfe can hurt us, for it will not. There's no care now remaining, but t'invent New pleasures. Let the houres wheele swiftly away In sports and Dances. Then we pay the Gods Best thankes, when we doe shew most sense of joy. To them Molops. Mol. I have an humble suit to your Majesty in the behalfe of some distressed people. Arsam. Let's heare't: what is't? Mol. There are halfe a dozen of sinners at the doore, foure of them are the Captives which your Majesty refus'd: two of 'em are of another Sexe, but would willingly joyne with 'em, and present you with a Dance, in congratulation of your happinesse. Arsam. Goe, bring 'em in, let Prisons this day know The joyes of Palaces. We will receive [Ex. Mol. All the delights the world can yeeld us. Hearke. The foure Slaves as they were sent to Prison, and the two whores are presented by Molops. They dance in their Cripple Postures. Atos. I hope your Majesty will not deny To grace a Company of younger Ladyes, With the like favourable eye. Arsam. They doe Honour our joyes in condescending to Be Actors in their Celebration. The Ladyes in a solemne march, present themselves all in war-like habits, and dance: the whole Dance expressing these verses of Claudian. Insonuit cum verbete signa magister, Mutatosque edunt pariter tunc pectora motus, In latus allisis clypeis, aut rursus in altum Vibratis, grave parma sonat mucronis acutum Murmur, &amp; umbonum pulsu modulante resultans Ferreus alterno concentus plauditur ictu. Arsam. I see that Sardis hath it's Amazons: An Army of these would subdue the world. Sce. 6. To them 1. Priest. 1. Priest. The fire is fully kindled, and the people All in their festivall attire; there wants Only the Sacrifice, and your selfe to kill it. Arsam. The voyce of Ravens in the dead of night Conveighs not harsher notes into mine eares. I've pardon'd him. 1. Priest. You cannot, unlesse you Will be more impious in preserving him, Than you were valorous in conquering. Arsam. Will not the Gods receive an Hecatombe Of Oxen in exchange? may we not finde The Destiny's in Beasts entralls? we will choake The fire with weighty lumps of richer gummes, And send perfum'd clouds up into their seates In one continued thankefulnesse, if that They'le spare this humane Sacrifice. 1. Priest. To promise The fairest Captive, and redeeme him with A Beast, or Teare of some relenting Tree, Is not to worship, but delude. Arsam. Cratander, The Gods recall my courtesy; I stand Doubly ingag'd, to Heav'n, and to thee; But thou canst easier pardon; for I know Thy Vertue's such, that thou hadst rather suffer Thy selfe, than Heav'n should be violated. Being then this sword must cut thy pretious thread, If Statues may preserve thee, and thou thinkst it A life to florish in faire memory, I'le people all my Kingdome with thy Images, To which they shall pay vowes, as to those Gods Who now require thy company. Atos. Yee Powers, Why are you growne thus cruell unto Vertue? 'T will be a wish hereafter to be foule. I cannot see him die, and live my selfe. Pray you defer his death a while, don't post him Away; perhaps the Gods may spare him yet. Crat. I know that divers mindes are here contain'd Under one silence, all expecting how I'le beare this sudden accident. T'accuse Or Gods, or Men's, the part of him that would Live longer. If I looke on the desires Of some here, whensoever I shall fall, I shall be thought t'have liv'd too little: if On the Actions I have done, I've liv'd enough: If on the injuries of Fortune, too much: If on mine honour, and my fame, I shall Live still; he gaines by death that doth die prays'd. Others have longer kept an Empire, but None better left it. To speake more, were but A sluggard's Policy, to defer his suffrings. On to the Altar. Arsam. Art thou willing too? Curs'd be my Victory! and thou my Sword Be never henceforth happy, if there be Another Sacrifice to fall like this. Witnesse yee Gods, how I unwilling pay My vowes in kinde. Most vertuous Cratander, (Worthy of Heav'n, but yet to tarry longer, And make Earth happy by thy presence,) looke; These teares I pay thee as a sad farewell. I feele the blow my selfe that I must give thee. Crat. These teares doe neither befit you to pay, Nor me to take; be then Arsamnes, on. Arsam. I feele a numnesse seize me; I am stone; I shall not lift mine arme against thee. Sure The Gods desire it not. [Exeunt. Sce. 7. 7t h Appearance, the Temple again discover'd an Altar, and one busie placing fire thereon. Enter Molops bearing the Sagar, then the 4 Slaves, 2 by 2; next the 4 Lords, then 4 Priests; after them Cratander alone, then the King and Queene, next Mandane and Ariene, last the Masquers: they all solemnely goe round the Stage, and having placed themselves, Cratander standing by the Altar, a Priest singes the first song. 1. Priest. Thou Ã´ bright Sun who seest all, Looke downe upon our Captives fall. Never was purer Sacrifice: 'Tis not a Man, but Vertue dyes. Cho. While thus we pay our thankes, propitious be; And grant us either Peace or Victory. After the Song, Molops delivers the Sagar to Arsamnes, and Cratander kneeles downe at the Altar; then another Priest sings the second Song. 2. Priest. But thou Ã´ Sun mayst set, and then In brightnesse rise next morne agen. He, when he shall once leave this light, Will make and have eternall night. Cho. Good deedes may passe for Sacrifice, Ã´ than Accept the Vertues, and give backe the Man. 8t h Appearance, the Sun eclipsed, and a showre of raine dashing out the fire. Whiles the last Chorus is singing, the Sunne appeares eclipsed, &amp;c. After the Song Arsamnes prepares to give the stroke, but is interrupted by the Priest. 2. Priest. Hold, hold Arsamnes; Heav'n is not pleased with your Sacrifice. The glorious Sun hath veyl'd his face in clouds Not willing to behold it, and the skyes Have shed such numerous teares, as have put out The fire though fully kindled. Atos. Thou hast now, The voyce and visage of the Gods, good Priest. The Heav'ns were never more serene. The Gods Have justify'd my care, Cratander. Arsam. Happy newes, Death sends thee backe unto us; this comes not From any humane pow'r; 'tis not my hand That spares thee, blest Cratander, 'tis some God, Some God reserves thee unto greater workes For us, and for thy Country. Crat. Being then You so interpret it, I'le thus divide That life they lend me, one halfe shall be yours, The other Ephesus's, that mine Actions Wearing both Gratitude and Piety, Like to some well wrought Picture, may at once Behold both you, and that. 'T shall ne're be said, The Gods reserv'd Cratander to a crime, To make him fall more foule. Arsam. Thy faith hath beene So firme and try'd, thy moderation So stayd, that in a just reward I must My selfe conduct thee into Greece, and there Continue thee a King; that what was meant For sport and mirth, may prove a serious honour; And thy Three Dayes passe o're into a long And happy government; to be rul'd by thee Will be as freedome to them; 'twill not be Accounted slavery to admit a Prince Chosen from out themselves: thy Vertues there May shine, as in their proper Spheare. Let others When they make warre, have this ignoble end To gaine 'em Slaves, Arsamnes gaines a Friend. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGVE TO THE KING &amp; QUEENE. Crat. Those glorious Triumphs of the Persian Court Are honour'd much in being made your sport. The Slave though freed by th'King, and his Priest too, Thinkes not his Pardon good, till seal'd by you: And hopes, although his faults have many beene, To finde here too the Favour of a Queene. For 'tis our forward duty that hath showne These loyall faults in honour to your Throne. Great joy doth bring some madnesse with it still; We challenge that as title to doe ill. Can you expect then perfect motion, where 'Tis the Digression only of our Spheare Which wheeles in this new course, t'expresse the sense Of your approach, it's best Intelligence? O were you still fix'd to it! your resort, Makes us desire an everlasting Court. And though wee've read you o're so long, that we Begin to know each line of Majesty, We thinke you snatch'd too soone, and grieve, as they Who for an halfe yeare's night, part with their day. And shall, till your returne, though you appeare In favours still, thinke darkenesse in our Spheare. Your sight will be preserv'd yet, though you rise: When e're you goe, Great Sir, hearts will have eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGVE TO THE UNIVERSITY. Arsam. Thus cited to a second night, wee've here Ventur'd our Errours to your weighing Eare. Wee'd thought they'd have beene dead, as soone as borne; For Dreames doe seldome live untill the morne. There's difference 'twixt a Colledge and a Court; The one expecteth Science, th'other sport. Parts should be Dialogues there, but Poynts to you: They looke for pleasing, you for sound, and true. We feare then we have injur'd those, whose Age Doth make the Schooles the measure of the Stage: And justly thence for want of Logicke darts, May dread those sturdy Yeomen of the Arts. We are not trayn'd yet to the Trade, none's fit To fine for Poet, or for Player yet. We hope you'le like it then, although rough fil'd; As the Nurse loves the lisping of the child. The Slave (then truly Royall, if you shall By your smiles too redeeme him from his fall) Hopes you'le dismisse him so, that he may sweare, One Court being gone, he found another here. Though rays'd from Slave to King, he vowes he will Resume his former Bonds, and be yours still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue to their Majesties at Hampton-Court. The unfil'd Author, though he be assur'd, That a bad Poet is a thing secur'd, Feare's yet he may miscarry, for some doe Having just nothing, loose that nothing too. His comfort's yet, that though the Incense fly Foule and unwelcome, and so scatter'd die, Neither the blot nor sinne can on him stand, Being the Censer's in another hand. For though the Peece be now mark'd his, and knowne, Yet the Repeaters make that Peece their owne. Being then a new Reciter some way is Another Author, we are thus made his. Wee therefore hope nothing, shall here be seene To make the Slave appeale from King or Queene: From your selves here, t'your selves at Oxford; grace And favour altring with the time and Place, So that some thence may deeme it happy fell There only, where you meant to take all well. 'Tis then your Countenance that is the price Must redeeme this, and free the Captive twice. He feares ill fate the lesse, in that if you Now kill him, you kill your owne favour too. How e're he will not 'gainst injustice cry; For you who made him live, may make him dy. FINIS.</field>
