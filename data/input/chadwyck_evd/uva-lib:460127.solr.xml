      <field name="fulltext">THE SIEGE of SINOPE. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by the Rev. Mr. COLLIER, And spoken by Mr. HENDERSON. In vain would satire, with misguided rage, Defame the manners of a polish'd age; As if, attach'd to dissipation's wheel, Our hearts had lost both power and wish to feel: When passion's shafts with intermingled flight, From pleasing pain produce severe delight; When sorrow weeps, with present woes opprest, Or joy for terrors past rears high its crest, Nature triumphant will uphold her sway, And all submissive her command obey. Thus, on perfection's height we gaze intent, But who shall dare to climb the steep ascent? When hope so frequent mourns its own disgrace, And checks our ardor in th' adventurous race? With doubting step, and agitated mien, Our bard advances on the stormy scene; Rejects the succour of pretended art, And builds no flattering hope, but on the heart. Nor will I longer spread the thin disguise, A woman here the plaintive tale supplies; On virtue's base she rears the female throne, Calls forth your feelings, as she paints her own: Whate'er in wedded love the breast can warm, Or give to filial bonds their highest charm; Whate'er emotions through the bosom dart, For pangs which keenest pierce a parent's heart; Here shall her feeble hand attempt to raise. Give us your tears, we ask no truer praise. What though the gentler sex of late have shown At least a right to share the poet's crown, Still has imperious man assum'd the claim Round merit's brow to bind the wreath of fame; Assert yourselves, ye fair! this chosen night, And prove your powers to judge as well as write: Thus man, with pride reluctant, shall confess, Each Muse may justly wear a woman's dress: To your indulgence shall his rigour bend, Nor dare to censure what your tears commend.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE. The City of Sinope, and the Camp of Athridates under its Walls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Outside of the Tent of Athridates; the Walls of Sinope in view on the Left; at a Distance, on the Right, the Camp, and a distant View of the Euxine Sea. ARTABANES and ARTAXIAS. ARTABANES. Blest be the favouring gods! may whitest omens Still mark the chosen day which saw me come From yon proud walls, th' ambassador of peace, To royal Athridates' warlike camp! ARTAXIAS. The hostile monarchs, wearied with contention, Now sheathe the slaughtering sword. Great Athridates Yields to the voice of nature, nor rejects A daughter's suit. ARTABANES. The royal Thamyris, Our beauteous queen, whose all-transcendent charms, With Hymen's torch enkindled that of discord, (The fatal cause of enmity) becomes The happy pledge of peace. No more the peasant Sees the swift blaze devour the season's hope; Again he breaks the soil: yon ravag'd fields, Late drench'd in blood, red with destructive slaughter, Again receive, well-pleas'd, the golden grain, And promise future years of smiling plenty. ARTAXIAS. Fell discord is no more: our conquering army, Which pour'd the tide of victory along, And like a torrent overflowed your plains, Now ebbs, retiring, at our monarch's voice, Who, when his vows with those of brave Pharnaces, Before the awful shrine of righteous Themis Are interchang'd, his martial thunder points At other foes, and gives to Pontus peace. ARTABANES. For ever sheath'd be the remorseless sword! True happiness is of domestic growth, It blossoms in the shade.âThe meanest hind, Who in the flowery lap of calm content Rests from his healthful toil, and meets at eve The faithful partner of his homely dwelling, Is happier than the laurel'd conqueror, Deaf to his people's welfare, who rejects The sacred gifts of peace. ARTAXIAS. Those sacred gifts No longer are withholden: raging Mars, With cypress wreath'd, and garments dropping blood, Unwilling quits the field. ARTABANES. A subject born, Respect should seal my lips; yet sure, Artaxias, Too long our land has felt your monarch's rage; Seven rolling years have seen unhappy Pontus A prey to savage war. ARTAXIAS. Great was the crime His fury thus pursu'd: bright Thamyris, His last remaining hope, his kingdom's heir, Forc'd from his palace at the midnight hour, When, all-secure, beneath the olive's shade His eyes were seal'd in sleep. Nor could he deem His sceptred guest, a lawless ravisher. ARTABANES. The crime of tenderness a parent's breast, To kind impressions apt, may surely pardon; Young, loving, and belov'd, Pharnaces came, A king, a blooming conqueror, to your court; The regal diadem adorn'd his brow, Twin'd with the verdant laurel.âThamyris Had long been promis'd to his ardent vowsâ By Athridates promis'd; and her heart, Pleas'd with a father's sanction, own'd its lord; Yet then, even at that moment, when Pharnaces, His heart high-beating with a bridegroom's transport, Approach'd the flaming altar, Athridates, Seduc'd by Rome, and dazzled by her friendship, Broke the strong fetters of long-plighted faith, And tore her from his wishes:âstung to madness, And too regardless of a father's right, Impell'd by love, he bore the princess thence, And plac'd her, half-reluctant, on his throne. ARTAXIAS. No more, my friend; behold the king approaches. SCENE II. ATHRIDATES, ARTABANES, ARTAXIAS, ORCHANES, and Guards. ATHRIDATES. Ambassador of Pontus, 'tis the hour Prefix'd for thy return:âsay to thy queen, A father's love has melted into air A monarch's just resentments.âI forgive, And as my child will meet her. Her offences, Since now repentant, from my memory fade, Like the light cloud before the summer-breeze, ARTABANES. Auspicious sounds! From this distinguish'd Ã¦ra Pontus' and Cappadocia's warlike sons, A band of brothers, bury all distinction. ATHRIDATES. The lassitude of age, and toils of war, Demand a short repose; the coming night I give to rest; but with the rising dawn, In Themis' temple, I embrace a daughter, Once dearer than the blood which warms my heart, And sign a lasting league with brave Pharnaces. ARTABANES. May Jove and righteous Themis bless your union! ATHRIDATES. Thanks, generous chief; this further to thy queen: The dear domestic bliss, so long suspended, Of mild paternal love, awhile indulg'd Beneath your monarch's hospitable roof, And Athridates leads his warriors back, To guard their native walls and houshold gods. ARTABANES. This hour, the fairest in the rolls of time, Wipes from the trembling matron's eye the tear, And spreads unnumber'd blessings thro' the land. ATHRIDATES. The stealing step of evening warns thee hence: See to the west the radiant god of day, On rapid wing, drives fast his fiery coursers! Ere he ascend the azure vault of heaven Expect me in Sinope.âThou, Orchanes, Safe to the eastern gate with speed conduct The valiant Artabanes.âChief farewel! SCENE III. ATHRIDATES, ARTAXIAS. ARTAXIAS. Behold yon liquid plain!âIts smooth expanse Late vex'd with blackening storms, like a clear mirror Reflects the setting sun, whose quivering beams Play on the glassy surface! Happy emblem Of this propitious day! ATHRIDATES. Calm is the sea, The winds are hush'd, and every wave at peace; 'Tis in my bosom the big tempest rages. ARTAXIAS. My lord!â ATHRIDATES. Artaxias, to thy faithful breast Thy master trusts his every care. The hour Dear to my soul, and fondly sought, approaches. ARTAXIAS. To-morrow's dawn shall see your vows exchang'd With Pontus' warlike monarch; shall behold Your blended incense rise, in curling volumes, A grateful offering to the powers divine. ATHRIDATES. Bellona, guardian goddess of my realm, In fair Comana's lofty walls ador'd, First claims my grateful vow. She nerv'd my arm; And o'er the land, by fell dismay attended, March'd by my side, array'd in all her terrors, And shook her brandish'd spear: She gave me conquest, The glorious meed of heroes. ARTAXIAS. The fierce hour Of raging indignation is elaps'd, Is past for ever. ATHRIDATES. Yes, 'tis pastâfor ever: The fruitful olive now o'ertops the laurel. Yet busy memory will not be restrain'd; She will recall those times of wild contention, When, driv'n by Mithridates from my throne, With unrelenting, savage, fury driven!â Yon vast expanse of waves, this globe of earth, No longer found for thy insulted lord A kind asylum from the victor's rage.â Canst thou forget my son, in youth's first prime, A beauteous branch, torn from the parent stem, And falling, in gay vernal bloom, to earth? Canst thou forget the sorrows which for him Have harrow'd up this bosom? ARTAXIAS. By the chance Of furious war he fell, with glory fell, And stain'd his youthful sword with hostile blood. ATHRIDATES. I saw him fall; still rest the traces here: I live,âand yet his spirit unappeas'd Upbraids my lingering vengeance. ARTAXIAS. Why pursue On Pontus' guiltless king a father's crimes? ATHRIDATES. Tho' years on years have roll'd, still, at the name Of Mithridates, keen resentment points The sleeping thunder; the stern furies rise With ten-fold serpents crown'd. ARTAXIAS. Be all your wrongs, My royal lord, forgot!â ATHRIDATES. Yet more, Pharnaces, This friend, this new ally, did he not bear, At dead of night, from these defenceless arms, My child, my Thamyris; the only hope Of my declining years; the only hope His father's sword had left me? ARTAXIAS. On his throne She more than shares his power, respected, lov'dâ The idol of his soul! ATHRIDATES. She was my pride, My joy, my age's comfort, fair as nature Fresh from the forming hands of mighty Jove: Nor was her mind less perfect, fram'd, at once, To give the hour of private life its grace, Or share the toils of empire.âBut no more!â Let me not thus, with retrospective eye, Recall the fatal past. ARTAXIAS. O Athridates! Great Lord of nations, learn, at last, to vanquish Thy own unconquer'd heart. ATHRIDATES. What wou'd thy zeal!â Have I not pledg'd my faith? ARTAXIAS. The faith of kings Should be irrevocable as the mandate From Jove's imperial throne. 'Tis not an hour Since to th' ambassador, in yonder tent, Your royal hand was given in pledge of peace. SCENE IV. ATHRIDATES, ARTAXIAS, a MESSENGER. MESSENGER. Mighty king! A moment since, the centinels descry'd A warlike train, from yonder hills descending, Who this way bend their march;âthe tow'ring eagles Declare them Roman. ATHRIDATES. Brave Domitius comes: To treaties faithful, leads his dauntless warriors, From Tyber's banks to join my conquering arms. ARTAXIAS. He comes to share the bounty of the gods; Fair concord's heart-felt joys. ATHRIDATES. He comes to share The joys of Athridates. Mark me well: When in the east the ruddy streaks of light First gild the gay horizon, let the troops, Arrang'd, in burnish'd arms, attend my will. SCENE V. ATHRIDATES. Yes, the grey dawn shall see me in Sinope; Shall see my incense rise, but not to Themis. Safe, (as they deem) depending on my faith, Sinope's thoughtless warriors share the feast, Begin the choral song, the graceful dance, And drain the sprightly bowl. Still, blind to fate, Let them enjoy the mirthful hour, and twine The festal rose round their devoted brows, Nor spy the adder lurking mid'st the leaves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. An open Place in the City of Sinope, before the Portico of the Temple of Themis. ARTABANES, TIGRANES. TIGRANES. Hail to my friend, by whose successful cares, The peace of Pontus on the firm foundation Of royal faith is fix'd, for ages fix'd. From the tall citadel's commanding summit, Advancing swiftly to the Eastern gate, I saw the Cappadocian troops approach In shining arms.âTheir nearest files, ere this, By Athridates led, have gain'd the city. ARTABANES. No longer hostile, to the passing winds His people's father, brave Pharnaces, gives His past resentment, and prepares to meet With every public, every martial honour, Due to a monarch, hero, father, friend, The royal Athridates. TIGRANES. At the altar Their sacred faith exchang'd, all-beauteous concord Prepares a fairer wreathe than that of conquest, To bind their peaceful brows. ARTABANES. Belov'd of Heav'n, The gentle power descends, with placid mien, To bless with milder joys our monarch's reign. TIGRANES. With public happiness, for him, the gods Propitious have entwin'd the heart-felt bliss Which waits the soft affections. From this hour (No longer by conflicting duties torn) The queen to heaven prefers her ardent vows; Vows which a husband and a father share. ARTABANES. Even at this moment, when the imperfect dawn Just tinges with a faint and trembling lustre The gilded turrets of yon holy fane, She seeks the righteous power. The names belov'd Of Athridates and Pharnaces rise In rapturous gratulations, at the shrine Of tutelary Themis. As she pass'd, I mark'd the triumph which with heighten'd grace Adorn'd her lovely form: she seem'd to scorn The earth she trod on, and entranc'd with joy To press with lighter step the balmy air. TIGRANES. Her mind, unruffled with the threatening storm, Which hung so late o'er these devoted walls, Resumes its wonted greatness. ARTABANES. All the strength Of manly wisdom, mix'd with woman's sweetness, In her fair soul in bright assemblage meet; Soft as the doves in Cytherea's car, Yet lofty as th' imperial eagle's flight. But 'tis the hour, when, by the king's command, I join th' approaching train. Meanwhile 'tis thine Around these lofty walls with care to range Thy chosen files, and guard the sacred portal. SCENE II. Tigranes speaks as the Scene changes. The temple gates unfold, and, see! the queen, Bright as Aurora, rising in the east! What mingled graces! Thus the Cyprian goddess, Drest by the smiling loves, and festive hours, On blue Olympus' starry height appears. Scene draws to solemn Music, and discovers the Inside of the Templeâthe Pillars adorned with festoons of flowersâan Altar burning, crowned with Wreaths of OliveâOrontes, Priests, and Virgins in white, ranged on each sideâThamyris standing by the Altar. THAMYRIS. All righteous Themis! to thy name we pour The song of gratitude! By thee sweet peace Spreads her soft wings around us; fast beside Thy sacred altar the fair wanderer rests: Yet not her choicest gifts, not Pontus sav'd, Would fill my vows, if, by the goddess led, Great Athridates came not. Once again My filial arms shall press a much lov'd father; Again his child, his Thamyris, shall see The smile paternal on his aged cheek, And hear his voice in blessings. Ye, my virgins, Bring the fresh flow'rets of the lovely spring, To strew his honour'd path. ORONTES. The monarchs come: Ere this they have embrac'd, and bend their steps To this propitious shrine.âYe holy train, Prepare the rites, prepare the sacred cup, A pure libation to th' attesting gods, The pledge of future concord. Raise the strain To awful Themis, arbitress of kings. [As Orontes approaches the altar, and the orchestra begin the accompanyment, loud thunder is heard on the leftâthe temple shakesâthe flames on the altar are suddenly extinguished, and the whole scene darkened.] Avert these omens, heaven! THAMYRIS. Immortal powers! If with pure heart, and will to heaven resign'd, I sought this holy fane, protect and pardon Your trembling votary. Speak your awful purpose. SCENE III. THAMYRIS, ARTABANES, ORONTES, Priests and Virgins. ARTABANES. Break off, break off, your inauspicious rites! With heav'n the impious Athridates wars: The Romans, foes profest of human kind, Abet his perfidy. The king awhile Retards his progress, but I fear in vain: Sinope streams with blood. With festive songs, Unarm'd, and crown'd with wreaths of peaceful olive, Our unsuspecting warriors met his steps, And rush'd on death: nor helpless infancy, Nor trembling age escapes: on to the palace, The murderer hews his way. THAMYRIS. Ha! to the palace! Is my child safe! quick, answerâspare, oh spare A parent's anguish. ARTABANES. By the king's command, The valiant Gordias, with a chosen band, Protects his innocence. ORONTES. Illustrious mourner! Leave to the gods thy righteous cause; their power Can strike the faulchion from th' uplifted arm, And wither every nerve. THAMYRIS. O! didst thou know A mother's fearsâher agonizing terrors, E'en when no danger threats! Alarm'd she hears The rushing whirlwind in the zephyr's breath, If absent from her offspring; let me fly And clasp him to my bosom; there alone My fears will think him safe. SCENE IV. ORONTES, TIGRANES, and Priests. TIGRANES. Rever'd Orontes, I sought the queen; from yonder scene of horror I flew to guard her steps. ORONTES. Brave Artabanes Conducts her to the palace.âBut our monarch! Pharnaces! Does he live? TIGRANES. With matchless valor He stems the tide of battle; but too soon Th' unequal conflict ends! Surpriz'd, betray'd, A prey to basest perfidy, he falls; And Rome and Athridates rule in Pontus. Farewel: this sword may yet assist my prince. ORONTES. Say to the king, the gods are friends to truth: Let him remember, keen Adversity Is Virtue's healthful school: to-morrow's dawn May see this tyrant, whose perfidious bosom, With impious daring, mocks the sacred vow, Prostrate on earth, confess the gods are just. Retire, whilst here the ministers of heaven, Submissive, deprecate the wrath divine. [Scene closes. SCENE V. An Apartment in the Palace. PHARNACES, THAMYRIS, meeting. THAMYRIS. My lord! my life! do I again behold thee? At sight of thee, my terrors all are vanish'd, Like darkness at the morning's orient beam. PHARNACES. Clear rose that orient beam, to set in blood! And is it thus we meet? O Thamyris! Thy impious father! But I would not grieve thee. THAMYRIS. Canst thou forgive me!âCruel Athridates! Why art thou leagued with Rome, whose fell ambition Spurns Nature's laws, and points the father's sword E'en at his children's bosoms? PHARNACES. Though defeated, I am not conquer'd; still the mighty spirit Of Mithridates animates this bosom. One hope remains: beneath Sinope's walls, My choicest troops, encamp'd, expect with ardour Their monarch's presence, as the happy signal Of conquest and revenge. The gods may give me To tear the laurel from the faithless brows Of Rome and Cappadocia, and to strike The vengeful faulchion to the tyrant's heart. THAMYRIS. For me what hope remains? a husband, father, Arm'd to destroy each other. My lov'd lord! By the fond passion which unites our souls, Let me adjure thee, by the rolling years Of faith unspotted, go not to the field. PHARNACES. Soul of my life, forbear! the present moment Is all the fates allow; I must not hear thee. Is this a time for softness, when Revenge Presents her flaming sword, with blood distain'd, And summons me away! the minutes call: E'en while I speak, my guiltless people perish: Terror and death round Athridates stalk; If soften'd by thy tears my purpose slackens, 'Tis past, and Pontus falls. THAMYRIS. Inhuman, go; Haste to the warring camp, and leave me here, The savage conqueror's prey; leave thy Eumenes, Thy helpless son, with me to drag a chain, To grace the victor's car, and soothe the pride Of impious Rome. PHARNACES. Thy words have rous'd a serpent. But heaven inspires! Yes! I will save you both. THAMYRIS. Then thou wilt stay, and guard with pious care The palace of thy fathersâguard thy son! Thy wife! thy people! who with ardent eyes Look up to thee for safety. PHARNACES. On this sword, Stain'd with the blood of perfidy and fraudâ THAMYRIS. Why dost thou tremble! say what dreadful purpose. PHARNACES. My queen! my best belov'dâto awful Themis, Protectress of the injur'd, on this sword Swear to obey whate'er commands the gods By me impose. THAMYRIS. I swear, by awful Themis, Protectress of the injur'd! PHARNACES. Heaven may give me To conquer in a cause which every god Must sure approve: but if the haughty eagles Here bend their fatal flight: if heaven decrees The subject-world must weep in chains, to glut Rome's merciless ambition: if Pharnaces From yonder field, where hope expands her wing, Returns a breathless corse; or, vanquish'd, leaves thee A helpless captive in the victor's powerâ How shall I speak the rest? See'st thou this dagger? A husband's last, best gift. THAMYRIS. Thou hast divin'd My soul's unshaken purpose. Thamyris Will die a queen, and free. PHARNACES. Yet there is more. Now steel thy soul, for I shall wound it deep! Eumenes! THAMYRIS. My child?âThou canst not meanâ PHARNACES. Shall he, the royal heir of mighty kingsâ A line of heroesâat the conqueror's wheels Drag a vile chain, a spectacle of scorn Through Rome's insulting streets? Could'st thou, expiring, Leave him in Roman bonds? THAMYRIS. The dreadful image Chills every source of life. PHARNACES. If Rome prevails, Deep in his infant bosom plunge that steel, And save him from dishonour! [Thamyris faints. Ha! she dies! The blood forsakes her cheek! What have I done? Too far I urg'd her heart. THAMYRIS. [Recovering.] Where is Eumenes! I thoughtâbut 'twas a dream! Ah! noâthat daggerâ The dire remembrance flashes on my soul; Pharnaces, could thy hand?âAlas, he knows not A mother's tenderness. PHARNACES. Like thee a parent, I love my child, e'en with a mother's fondness; Yet to preserve him from ignoble bondsâ But I will trust thy virtue: to thy care I leave my all, my son, my kingdom's hope. If heaven directs the battle, we shall meet, Victorious meet; if not, that mind august Will speak the rest; 'tis thine to set him free. THAMYRIS. And canst thou leave me thus! perhaps for ever! O! I have much to sayâthese starting tearsâ PHARNACES. My soul's best treasure! see'st thou not the pangs Which rend my tortur'd heart? the mighty voice Of public duty calls me. Does the storm On us alone descend? At this dread moment How many weeping matrons mourn their lords! How many agonizing mothers curse, In bitterness of soul, thy father's sword! Wilt thou conspire against me! Pitying gods! O save me from her sorrows! I must leave thee; Leave thee midst foes; but 'tis to save from bondage This bleeding land. THAMYRIS. Where has my spirit slept? Where is that spark of heaven-descended virtue Which gives the diadem its brightest lustre, And fires the monarch's bosom? Go, Pharnaces, Thy duty calls; I yield thee to thy people: Forgive me; go, thy country's best defender; And may the gods protect thee! PHARNACES. To my child Bear this embrace, and sayâbut whilst I linger, The work of fate goes on. Thou wilt rememberâ The faithless Romans comeâthat steel!âEumenes!â The last of Mithridates' conquering raceâ The blood of heroes fills his infant veinsâ If he is doom'd a slaveâ THAMYRIS. No more, no more: Tho' horror shakes my frame, yet go secure!â Trust to my faith;âne'er shall the conquering race Of Mithridates blush in chains. PHARNACES. Farewell! SCENE VI. THAMYRIS. What has my rashness sworn! All-righteous Themis! O spare a mother's crime!âLet my lov'd lord Return with conquest crown'd!âPreserve the hero, Who combats for his country!âIn the field Be present with him;ânerve his patriot arm! Give the lov'd monarch to his people's wishes, And show mankind the great reward of virtue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Street. ATHRIDATES, ARTAXIAS. ATHRIDATES. Revenge at length is mine: on yonder towers The Cappadocian banners proudly wave And wanton in the gale. The fierce Pharnaces, A lion in the toils, within his palace Hides his dishonour'd head. ARTAXIAS. Ill-fated prince! ATHRIDATES. Dost thou lament him? By th' unburied dead Sent by my conquering sword this day to seek The gloomy borders of stern Pluto's reign, Another word like that, and to the shades Thy trembling ghost shall follow. ARTAXIAS. When I view The dreadful carnage of this day of blood; See this fair city, which the dawn beheld The pride of Asia, humbled in the dust; Her slaughter'd citizens; her blazing domes; Her infants, clinging round their dying mothers; Forgive me, sir; if, loyal as I am, I drop the tear humane. ATHRIDATES. Reserve thy tears; If for my foes they fall, those tears are treason. ARTAXIAS. My sword, my arm, my life, O king! are yours; The feelings of my heart, the sacred drops Of generous pity, heaven alone controuls. ATHRIDATES. Keep them for heaven, nor damp thy master's triumph With inauspicious sorrows. ARTAXIAS. Spare at least A child in Thamyris. ATHRIDATES. Thou plead'st in vain: No, heaven be witness, I will ne'er withdraw The fiends of carnage, 'till the sierce Pharnaces, His queen (no more my daughter), and their son, The bond of their detested union, glut The ravening vulture's hunger. Let her perish:â She dies,âthis swordâor rather let her live; Live to drink up the bitter cup of shame; To swell the triumph of victorious Rome; In chains, to follow the proud car of CÃ¦sar, And learn to scorn a father. ARTAXIAS. Can your heart, To pity dead, forget her infant charms, Her springing dawn of beauty? ATHRIDATES. Speak not of her: Speak of revenge: of slaughter, horrors,âdeath; Her disobedience draws the righteous sword, And I am but the delegate of heaven, To strike the destin'd blow. SCENE II. ATHRIDATES, ARTAXIAS, ORCHANES. ORCHANES. From brave Domitiusâ ATHRIDATES. Has he too conquer'd? my impatient spirit Prevents the step of time. ORCHANES. Great Athridates, Be all thy days like this! Thy foes give way On every side: Domitius has attack'd Yon hostile camp; unequal to the conflict, Their vanquish'd siles retire. ATHRIDATES. For this shall bleed The snowy herd on dread Bellona's altar, In grateful sacrifice. ORCHANES. The rest, my voice Unwillingly relatesâ ATHRIDATES. Ha! say'st thouâspeak!â ORCHANES. This moment, from the ramparts, I beheld Pharnaces pass the gate, which, near his palace, Leads to the royal tent. ATHRIDATES. Escap'd!âconfusion!â ORCHANES. He but escap'd to make his fall more fatal, More glorious your revenge. Domitius' troops, With closing ranks, almost surround his camp, Nor can his presence save his faithful bands From Rome's all-conquering legions. ATHRIDATES. Yet one way My power can reach his heart,âhis queen,âhis sonâ Haste, force the palace gates; secure them both; My eager fury will not brook delay. SCENE III. The Palace. THAMYRIS, XIPHARES. THAMYRIS. By sorrow led, unknowing where I wander, Through each apartment of this once-lov'd palace I trace my chearless way. Pale fear and terror, The sad attendants on a state like mine, Have from this heart, oppress'd with keenest anguish, Chac'd every lucid ray of expectation. XIPHARES. Great God of battles! If dearer far to heaven than hecatombs A monarch's virtues, justice, mercy, truth, Firm faith unspotted, valor still chastis'd By mild compassion, grace Pharnaces' reign, Auspicious hear! and aid the prince who draws Constrain'd th' unwilling sword! the prince who wars Not to destroy, but save! SCENE IV. THAMYRIS, ARTABANES, XIPHARES. ARTABANES. My gracious queen! With hasty step, advancing to the palace, This way the Cappadocian troops advance, Led by their haughty lord: a glittering grove Of hostile spears play in the quivering sun-beams, And emulate the day. This regal dome Affords a poor precarious hour of safety. THAMYRIS. Xiphares, haste: Do thou conduct my child. If he is safe, my soul unmov'd can meet The wildest rage of fateâawayâaway, Thou know'st the winding path,âthe dark abode, Where sleep th' illustrious heroes of his race. Even Athridates, cruel as he is, Will fear to violate the awful tomb. [Clashing of swords. This instant fly, the murderous band approach. SCENE V. THAMYRIS. ARTABANES. THAMYRIS. Throw wide the gates; resistance now is vain: The raging storm in thunder breaks above us,â But I will meet it.â SCENE VI. THAMYRIS, ATHRIDATES, ARTABANES. ARTABANES. Ha! my father here! My trembling heart recoils.â ATHRIDATES. Imperious woman! Hast thou forgot me? THAMYRIS. Wou'd I could forget This day of matchless horrors! ATHRIDATES. Her stern eyes Disdainful fix'd on earth, she meets with scorn The father she abandon'd. Say, obdurate, Ere on thy head the vengeful steel descends, Where hast thou hid my victim? the remains Of Mithridates' race? the impious pledge Of thy unhallow'd nuptials? THAMYRIS. 'Midst yon heaps, Yon slaughter'd heaps, where age and infancy Promiscuous swell the dreadful carnage, seek His unprotected innocence. But where, Inhuman? tell me,âwhere is my Pharnaces? Where are my murder'd people!âkingdom!âthrone! All, all, my unsuspecting, woman's, heart, Betray'd to Athridates.âMy fond wish To hail once more the tender name of father, To kiss that hand rever'd, and sue for pardon; My weak, mistaken, filial piety, Have pierc'd with tenfold wounds this bleeding land, And wing'd the arrow to my husband's heart. ATHRIDATES. 'Tis well, this arrogance becomes a daughter. THAMYRIS. Becomes a queen: thy cruelty has raz'd Each tender name from nature's beauteous volume, And clos'd the fond account. No more a daughter Implores a father's smile; but majesty, Offended, wounded, injur'd, majesty, Meets its oppressor. Powerful as thou art, Lord of my fate, I rise superior to thee For thou hast broke thy faith. ATHRIDATES. Why waste I words? The king, the conqueror, demands his captive: Produce thy son, or instant death, embitter'd By keenest tortures, waits thee. THAMYRIS. Vain these threats; A mother's bosom, trembling for her child, One fear alone can know. ATHRIDATES. Thou fear'st for him!â He lives then!âbut 'tis wellâbe still that fear Thy curse, 'till vengeance comes! Thou canst not long Conceal him from my search:âA father's justice Shall reach that heart relentless, and inflict Pangs I could almost pity.âIn that hour, That trying hour, to meet with heart unmov'd The sword of Rome, and brave a father's vengeance, What god omnipotent shall give thee courage? THAMYRIS. The god within the soul,âdespair,âmyself. ATHRIDATES. Soon shalt thou meet the trial: summon all Thy boasted fortitude.âThe hour approaches. SCENE VII. THAMYRIS, ATHRIDATES, ARTABANES, ARTAXIAS, ORCHANES. ORCHANES. Great Athridates o'er the lonely palace, In vain, at thy command, we sought the prince: In some unknown retreat, from every eye The queen conceals her son. THAMYRIS. Beyond thy power He lives, protected by th' immortal gods. Yes, thy allies, from Tyber's faithless banks, Shall want the noblest trophy of the war; My child shall mock their fury. SCENE VIII. ATHRIDATES, ARTAXIAS, ORCHANES. ATHRIDATES. Woman's rage, Though fierce, is harmless as the missive dart From childhood's feeble arm. Do thou, Orchanes, At distance wait the queen; observe her steps, But leave them free. SCENE IX. ATHRIDATES, ARTAXIAS. Sincere and undisguis'd As fond, believing, smiling infancy, Suspicion dwells not with her; yet her spirit To fear superior rises. Fraudful guile, Not force, must gain my purpose. To the snare Maternal love will guide her. Led by terror, And anxious to elude my threaten'd vengeance, When unrestrain'd, her busy thought will weave Th' insidious web, in which herself, intangled, Will meet more sure destruction. ARTAXIAS. Gracious king! See me implore you for a once-lov'd daughter, Now fall'n from power, the captive of your arms, Whose weakness pleads for mercy. ATHRIDATES. Power of Vengeance! To thee my vows are paid! The great resolve, The hardy deed are thine! Let my brave troops [To Artaxias. Find from their arduous toils a short repose: That done, again they draw the glittering steel, And join yon camp. The word be Victory. SCENE X. The Garden of the Palace; the Scene terminated by a dark Grove, leading to the Tomb of Mithridates, a Part of which appears at a Distance through the Trees. ARTABANES, TIGRANES. ARTABANES. A dreadful interval of solemn silence Succeeds the tumult of the raging battle, And through Sinope reigns. O'er all the city No sound is heard, except a falling murmur, Which, less and less, expires upon the ear, Like the soft trembling of the settled deep, After the storm subsides. TIGRANES. A calm like this Precedes the baleful tempest. Still in arms The troops of Athridates silent wait Their cruel master's will. ARTABANES. The moments teem Eventful, and the coming hour decides Whether the trembling sons of Pontus bow Beneath the yoke of foreign tyranny, Or, crown'd with conquest, on their native lord Delighted gaze, and raise the song to heaven. TIGRANES. If yet Pharnaces lives, ye gods protect him! Protect this gracious image of yourselves, Who, midst the horrors of relentless war, Has made a nation blest. ARTABANES. When fierce invasion Roll'd like a torrent o'er th' affrighted land, Have we not seen him, terrible in fight, As Mars resistless, point the glittering spear, As war were his delight? yet to his people Gentle as Maia's son, as Themis just, Benignant as the god who strikes the lyre, And leads, serene, the radiant pomp of day. TIGRANES. Behold the queen! Along the verdant grove, Which from the noontide fervor shades the palace, And, winding, leads to Mithridates' tomb, Her footsteps haste: with wild enquiring glance Her piercing eye pervades th' umbrageous gloom: She stops, she listens, like the trembling hind, Which from the hunters rage conceals her young, And pants, alarm'd, whene'er the rustling leaf By Zephyr's breath is fann'd. ARTABANES. The gates unfold: Xiphares meets her step. Respect her sorrows; At distance let us wait, to guard her back With duteous care in safety to the palace. SCENE XI. The Place of Sepulchre of the Kings of Pontus; several magnificent Tombs; in the Middle of the Stage that of Mithridates. (A faint Light just makes the Tombs visible.) THAMYRIS, leading EUMENES; XIPHARES attending. THAMYRIS. 'Tis past! I heard distinct the fatal knell; The conquering shout from Rome's embattled legions. Pharnaces falls!âthe husband, father, king; The idol of his people, the last hope Of wretched Pontus.âO, too greatly daring! In vain I wept, I kneel'd. Thou dearest object Of a fond mother's love, her fears, her sorrows! The fatal hour is come, and we must die. Thy father's spirit calls. Immortal Powers! Who pour'd into my bosom woman's softness, If you decree this trembling hand must shed The blood of innocence, O steel my soul, And mould my heart to all my father's fierceness. XIPHARES. O shade rever'd of mighty Mithridates! Ye sacred manes of a line of heroes! Protect your royal offspring! THAMYRIS. Ever faithful To Mithridates' house, to thee I trust My soul's last hope; perhaps thy infant king. Within this awful mansion of the dead Awhile conceal his helpless innocence. Sole hope of my sad heart, why bend on me Those tender beams, which harrow up my soul! Why dost thou tremble? Why retire thy steps? The good Xiphares will attend thee still. XIPHARES. Whate'er your purpose, royal Thamyris, Each moment now is precious. THAMYRIS. My belov'd! Yield to thy fate: receive this kiss, and live; For me, this awful pile, the sad asylum Of all my soul holds dear, shall soon receive me. If death alone can save me from the Romans, My unembody'd spirit still shall hover Where'er the gods conduct thee. Go, my child! I cannot say, farewell! [Xiphares leads Eumenes to the Tomb; they enter, and the Doors close. Thamyris looks after them. SCENE XII. THAMYRIS, ATHRIDATES, ARTAXIAS, ORCHANES. ATHRIDATES. [To Artax.] Urge me no more. See, from a father's mercy She flies to this vile tomb, where rest the ashes Of him my soul detested! What dire purpose Could from thy palace lead thy erring steps To this abhorr'd abode? Whom seek'st thou here? THAMYRIS. The king of terrorsâDeathâ ATHRIDATES. Soon shalt thou find him. He comes with rapid pace. Approach, my warriors. SCENE XIII. THAMYRIS, ATHRIDATES, ARTAXIAS, ORCHANES. Soldiers, with Torches and Axes. This haughty mausoleum of a race To Athridates fatal, shall no longer Insult yon azure sky. My swift revenge Shall level these proud walls, and to the winds Disperse the ashes of a hostile line. THAMYRIS. Thou wilt not sure, with war's impurpled horrors, Prophane this peaceful tomb of Pontus' kings! From the cold grave what can a conqueror fear? O spare this hallow'd dust! ATHRIDATES. And can the queen Of great Pharnaces weep? that haughty spirit Descend to melt in tears? THAMYRIS. True, these fond tears, These unavailing drops, disgrace the daughter, The wife, of mighty kings: relentless fury Would best become my wrongs. Yet hear me, sire! Revere the gods, and spare th' illustrious dead. ATHRIDATES. Advance, and from its deep foundation raze This tomb, which mocks my vengeance. [The Soldiers advance. Thamyris snatches a Sword, and stands before the Tomb. THAMYRIS. Hence, ye slaves! He dies who dares approach. The timid dove Will brave the vulture, to defend her young. ATHRIDATES. Instant obey me, or your lives shall answer. [The Soldiers force open the Tomb, and Eumenes appears, Xiphares (his sword drawn) holding him by the hand. Military Trophies. A Lamp burning within the Tomb. Propitious powers! at length I hold my victim. [Thamyris drops the Sword, and falls at the feet of Athridates. THAMYRIS. King! father! Athridates! by the blood From thee deriv'd, which fills these circling veins, With pity hear me! from thy threaten'd vengeance, From death, dishonor, and the chains of Rome, Within this horrid tomb's relentless walls A mother's love conceal'd him. ATHRIDATES. Rise, fond woman. THAMYRIS. Thou wilt not shed his blood? ATHRIDATES. HenceâTrust a father, In whom a latent spark of struggling nature Yet pleads for him, for thee. [Thamyris rises, goes to the Tomb, and leads Eumenes to Athridates. THAMYRIS. I will believe thee. Come from this dark abode, thou wretched heir Of an unhappy mother! See, O, king! This terror of the Romans! the remains Of an unhappy race by thee pursued. What canst thou fear from him? Go, my Eumenes; Embrace those knees; and print obsequious kisses On that respected hand. My soul's soft darling! Why dost thou gaze upon me? 'tis not base; A mother's terrors, and remorseless fate, Command thy prompt obedience. Kneel, my child. ATHRIDATES. Orchanes, to the palace wait the queen: Her son remains with me. THAMYRIS. Thou wilt not part us? Give, give, one moment to my breaking heart. Come to my bosom, child of many sorrows! They shall not tear thee from me. ATHRIDATES. Ha! take heed, Nor let thy fond impatience lanch the bolt Which stops, suspended o'er him. THAMYRIS. From my hand Receive him, Athridates. If thy fury Attempt his infant life, may every God Pour on thy head devotedâGracious heaven! What means my rage? I cannot curse a father. ATHRIDATES. Artaxias, guard secure Pharnaces' son: Conduct him to the citadel: thy life (Observe me well) shall answer for the trust. THAMYRIS. Wilt thou not spare him! O, for him, for him! ATHRIDATES. Thy agitated soul demands repose. And my compassion grants it. To the palace Turn from this scene of horrors. Soon I'll see thee And fix thy fate with his. THAMYRIS. If yet one ray Of soft paternal tenderness remains! With pity hear me! hear the mighty voice Of awful nature! change thy stern decree, From wild despair save this distracted bosom, And give Eumenes to a mother's tears! SCENE XIV. ATHRIDATES. Behold his mein, where mixt with infant sweetness, Dwells the commanding majesty of kings! There might be danger. Such a radiant dawn Portends a mid-day sun of dazzling lustre. But all is well. Now tremble, proud Pharnaces. The fates enclose them round; my soul exults, And, raptur'd, hails the hour of great revenge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Palace. THAMYRIS, ARTABANES, meeting. THAMYRIS. Saw'st thou Artaxias? does compassion touch My father's soften'd bosom? ARTABANES. Such compassion Feels the fell Tiger for his panting prey. THAMYRIS. What mean thy words? I tremble; a cold dew Hangs on my frame, and chills my vital powers. Does my Eumenes live? If thou hast pity, O, tell me whilst I yet have life to hear thee. ARTABANES. I saw him smile, unconscious of his fate; But soon in Roman chains, with you, deliver'd To stern Domitius' powerâ THAMYRIS. First shall this daggerâ I was prepar'd for death, but not for shame. Let the devouring faulchion drink our blood, Let tortures agonize, let flames consume, Let death approach in all his terrors drest, And I will meet his presence unappall'd; Will give my child, my soul's far dearest part, Without a groan to his abhorr'd embrace; But save us, heaven, from the vile chains of Rome! ARTABANES. To bondage, to the car of haughty CÃ¦sar, To shame, to death, your cruel father dooms The daughter once belov'd, the infant heir Of mighty Mithridates: yon proud Roman (Unless the gods assist our monarch's sword, And drive these fell invaders from our walls) This night receives, and sends you to the Senates. THAMYRIS. My lord! my lov'd Pharnaces! I have indeed betray'd thee; broke those vows, Which, dreadful as they were, my lips pronounc'd Before th' attesting gods.âA moment's pauseâ Fond hope will yet intrude: it cannot be: He will not give a daughter once belov'd, To glut the pride of Rome. Where hast thou heard This tale of horror? ARTABANES. From the good Artaxias, Whose tears with mine were mingled as he spoke, I learnt his cruel purpose. THAMYRIS. Lead me to him,â To Athridates, Cappadocia's tyrant, This scepter'd murderer, this crown'd assassin, This scourge of trembling infancy, thisâfather. ARTABANES. My queen! my royal mistress!â THAMYRIS. Forgive, ye awful powers, who know my wrongs, These ravings of a soul to madness urg'd. Noânot to save my child, did I behold The fatal steel aim'd at his infant bosom, Should parricide pollute these guiltless hands. Great nature's voice arrests my dagger's point; Spite of his crimes, he is my father still. ARTABANES. Let me adjure you, by the sacred life Of your Pharnaces; by your helpless child, The beauteous pledge of your ill-fated loves; Yourself; your faithful people; to restrain These wild, impetuous sallies of your soul, Nor draw destruction on yourself, on all. THAMYRIS. I will command the feelings of my heart; Will meet him with the uncomplaining eye, The silent tear of suffering resignation. ARTABANES. My gracious queen! fierce Athridates comes. THAMYRIS. Retire, and leave us free. SCENE II. THAMYRIS. I wou'd be calm, Would soothe to peace this whirlwind of the passions, And wear dissimulation's treacherous smile; But my full soul, to holy truth inur'd, Disdains the base disguise. SCENE III. THAMYRIS, ATHRIDATES, a Soldier. ATHRIDATES. Bear these dispatches to the Roman camp: (to the Soldier. This night we join their bands. I sought thee, Thamyris. [Exit Soldier. THAMYRIS. Com'st thou to mock my sorrows! to enjoy A mother's agonies? Yes, plunge thy sword In the meek breast of smiling innocence; The deed will crown the horrors of this day. ATHRIDATES. My word is past: Domitius claims his captives: Thou and thy son are doom'd to grace the car, And swell the triumph, of all-conquering CÃ¦sar. THAMYRIS. 'Tis well, 'tis well.âGreat Athridates' daughter, Her son, the last of his imperial race, In chains shall follow CÃ¦sar: not o'er Pontus, O'er Cappadocia shall the Romans triumph. ATHRIDATES. Too deep already has my bosom felt The pang that thought awakens: touch'd with pity I came to save thee (but thy headlong passion Has blasted my fond purpose); to restore This darling of thy soul, thy lov'd Eumenes, To give him life and empire. THAMYRIS. Wilt thou save him? Thus low I bend before th' immortal gods, To beg a blessing on thee. ATHRIDATES. O'er the king The father has prevail'd; I bring thee peace; Again the diadem shall bind thy brow, And thy Eumenes reign. THAMYRIS. Transporting sounds! I have again a father: canst thou pardon The wildness of my rage? 'Twas fear alone; My terrors for Eumenes. Let me kiss That sacred hand, and with my tears atone For every past offence. ATHRIDATES. I pardon thee, And take thee to my heart. I must remember Those hours when, dearer than the light of heaven, Thou wert my soul's best comfort. THAMYRIS. 'Tis too much, This sudden torrent of impetuous transportâ My lord!âmy king!âmy father! ATHRIDATES. Still my daughter, All-powerful nature pleads thy causeâone struggle, One sacrifice, and all is well.âPharnaces! THAMYRIS. He too shall thank thee for a child preserv'd, For peace, recover'd empire. In the fane Of holy Themis, heaven shall join your hands, And Thamyris be blest beyond the state Of frail mortality. ATHRIDATES. Attentive hear.â This is the crisis of thy fate; the moment Which to thy hand a double sceptre gives, Or sinks thee to a slave. THAMYRIS. What means my father? ATHRIDATES. Thus far I have prevail'd; consent to break The impious ties which bind thee to Pharnaces, To give him up to my revenge, and Pontus To-morrow yielded to thy guardian care, Shall own Eumenes' sway; and when the gods Shall call me to themselves, the fruitful fields Of Cappadocia shall behold thee seated On Athridates' throne. THAMYRIS. 'Tis pastâfarewell.â ATHRIDATES. Return, and hear me; or this pointed steel Shall leave thee childless. THAMYRIS. My fond heart had hop'd,â But our unhappy sex is born to suffer. ATHRIDATES. My mercy scorn'd? On thy devoted head The massy ruin falls. THAMYRIS. Is this thy mercy? Thy boasted tenederness? Connubial Juno! In whose bright fane my nuptial vows were seal'd, Hear, and record! If e'er my faithless heart, To honour lost, break with unhallow'd lightness The sacred ties by all mankind rever'd, The holy bonds of Hymen, may I perish Unpitied, unreveng'd, the scorn of all Whose bosoms burn with virtue's glorious flame! ATHRIDATES. Thy son shall die. THAMYRIS. Then we will die together. ATHRIDATES. For the fond idol of thy woman's heart Who reign'd this morn o'er Pontus, thy Pharnaces, Expect no aid from him; the Roman eagle Expands his wing, and hovers dreadful o'er him, Resistless to descend. TEAMYRIS. The righteous powers, Who love the just, will guard him. SCENE IV. THAMYRIS, ATHRIDATES, ARTABANES, ORCHANES. ORCHANES. Royal Sir, A Roman tribune, by Domitius sent, Demands your private ear. ATHRIDATES. Now hear, and tremble! That tribune is thy fate; the hour is past; The hour my weakness gave. Hence, dove-like pity! Let vengeance steel my soul!âYet once againâ [GoingâReturns. Fond woman, hear a father; once again The voice of nature pleads. Thy darling sonâ The flaming altar is already drest, And thirsts to drink his blood. Thy guards withdrawn, I leave thee free: till night's pale queen ascends With trembling ray, yon mountain's lofty summit, My pity gives thee: when, by fierce Bellona, Comana's guardian goddess, here I swear, As thou decid'st, he dies, or reigns in Pontus. SCENE V. THAMYRIS, ARTABANES. THAMYRIS. Ye powers of heaven! where sleeps your aweful thunder? My child is doom'd! ARTABANES. Be patient, gracious princess. THAMYRIS. Am I not patient? Patient as the victim That pants beneath the knife of sacrifice? Have they not, unresisted, torn him from me, From a fond mother's arms?âHark! Heard'st thou not That sound confus'd!âNo,â'Twas th' ideal voice Of pensive fancy, sick with anxious care. ARTABANES. The sound was real: from the king's apartment, Some one approachesâIs it possible? O extacy! beyond the soaring reach Of bright-ey'd hope, or fancy's fond creation! Behold! our monarch comesâ THAMYRIS. It is Pharnaces! And sorrow from this heart is chac'd for ever. SCENE VI. THAMYRIS, PHARNACES, ARTABANES. PHARNACES. And dost thou live? THAMYRIS. And art thou here to ask? What god has led thee safe? PHARNACES. The god who rules The battle's rage, has sav'd and sent me to thee. THAMYRIS. Forgive my woman's terrors; hast thou conquer'd? Where are thy troops? Should cruel Athridates!â Alas! my lord! in this defenceless palace, The palace of thy fathers, he commands; Though now withdrawn, his guards may soon return: Here safety dwells not. PHARNACES. The degenerate sons Of Rome avoid the fight. I found my troops. By numbers aw'd, retiring: at my sight, As with new souls inform'd, they rush'd to battle, Like the big torrent bursting every mound. The legions stop'd; Domitius led them back, Inglorious: in the field my faithful warriors, All high of soul, and eager to engage, Now wait my wish'd return. THAMYRIS. How didst thou pass Sinope's gates? PHARNACES. Along the verdant grove Of great Apollo, by a path unknown, Sacred to mighty Mithridates' race, Which to the palace leads, I came secure, To save thee from thyself. THAMYRIS. Great god of day! For this, before thy consecrated shrine, Shall my full heart pour forth the grateful vow. PHARNACES. Anxious for thee, and trembling for thy fate, I flew to abrogate the dreadful oath My fears this morn impos'd, to bid thee live, And trust in heaven. A gleam of smiling hope Breaks through the cloud of black adversity, As the fair orient ray dispels the shades Of sable night. My brother of the war, Cyaxares, Armenia's youthful monarch, Weary of Roman tyranny, advances, To aid my cause; and when the setting sun Dips his last beams in ocean, joins my arms. THAMYRIS. Then heaven is just!âThe powers celestial aid thee! PHARNACES. Fir'd by returning hope, my hardy veterans, With fair Armenia's yet unconquer'd sons, Will storm the Roman camp; thou, Artabanes, Prepare my faithful people for the hour Of conquest and revenge: let part in arms, Ere midnight o'er the world her mantle throws, By valiant Gordias led, expect my coming. The queen with me departs: Eumenes too, Whilst fair occasion smiles: conduct him hither: He too must leave SinopeâHa! in tears?â Hast thou too well obey'd me! Has thy dagger!â My fatal gift!â THAMYRIS. He lives. PHARNACES. He lives!âno more! Daughter of Athridates! O beware! Wake not the sleeping adder in my bosom! Dear as I love thee, should thy woman's fearsâ THAMYRIS. What means thy fury? PHARNACES. Say;âwhere is Eumenes? Perhaps in yonder campâdost thou inherit A father's baseness? has thy coward-heart To Rome resign'd him? Giv'n him up to bondage? To breathe a few short hours this ambient air, The fetter'd child of shame? THAMYRIS. Unkind and cruel! The iron hand of tyrant power has torn him From these defenceless arms, like me a captive, He looks to heaven, and to his father's sword, For life and freedom. PHARNACES. My prophetic fears! A captive! wherefore did my fondness trust Thy woman's heart? The hero's glow of soul, The generous thought, firm virtue's stubborn purpose, Thy feeble bosom feels not. THAMYRIS. Learn to know This heart, which beats as proudly as thy own, At honour's god-like voice. Thou bad'st me hope; Should that fond hope forsake me, should'st thou Which every god avert! This heart resolv'd, This faithful steel, a mother's ardent love, Fearless as thine, shall pierce the tyrant's guards, And free Eumenes. PHARNACES. I have wrong'd thee much, Soul of my life! have wrong'd thy faith, thy virtue. Canst thou forgive my rage? A parent's pangs, The pangs of bleeding honour, rend my heart, And fire my brain to madness.âBut no moreâ To yonder warring field, a nation's safety, The voice of glory, calls me. [Going. THAMYRIS. Yet, Pharnaces, Yet one request. If, in the battle's fury, Thou meet'st my father, turn thy sword aside, And seek another victim. PHARNACES. Stop those tears, Which, like the dew-drops on the lily's bell, Weigh down thy drooping beauties. Does the tyrant Deserve this waste of goodness? ARTABANES. Haste, my lord! Stern Athridates comes!âa moment more And Pontus falls. THAMYRIS. O save thyself, Pharnaces! Haste to the camp, and leave us to the gods. PHARNACES. I go: but, in a few revolving hours, Expect me here, to save, or perish with you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. On the left Hand, the Camp of Pharnaces in Prospect at the Entrance of a Grove; the Time near Midnight; the Moon risen; the Tents with Lights dispers'd amongst the Trees, the Royal Tent in the Front of the others: on the right Hand a Road over a Mountain, from whence Pharnaces descends with his Army.âGrand March. PHARNACES, TIGRANES, and Soldiers. TIGRANES. My gracious lord, may every hour, like this, Bear conquest on its wing! o'er yonder hills The Romans fly;âthose tyrants of mankind, Whose rage destructive lights the flaming brand, And scatters terror thro' the mild abodes, Where concord wont to dwell. PHARNACES. My gallant friend, Armenia's monarch, brave Cyaxares, Pursues the drooping eagles. Yet, Tigranes, 'Till fair Sinope's walls receive their lord; 'Till, free once more, amid their flowery vales My subjects sheathe the sword, and taste the meed Of well-fought fields in the soft arms of peace, 'Till my lov'd queen, my son, in my embrace, Forget the danger past, I have not conquer'd: My toils are but begunâstern Athridates E'en in my palace reigns. TIGRANES. Shall the fell tyrant, Who mocks the plighted vow, still brave unheeded The thunder of the gods?âWhat dire offence Shall draw the vengeful bolt, if deeds like his Insult th' immortal powers? PHARNACES. The gods, Tigranes, Assist the brave; their power omnipotent Is present with usâwhen they gracious give A heart resolv'd to dare, an arm to strike. TIGRANES (looking out). Behold, my lord, along the sacred grove A light resplendent as the noon-tide ray Shoots like a meteor to the western gate! And now dissolves in air. PHARNACES. I hail the omen, And feel, confess'd, the energy divine: The gods themselves conduct me, nerve my arm, Inspire my purpose, point my destin'd way, And in my bosom fan the flame of hope. Begin the march, and filing near the grove Approach Sinope. Beauteous queen of night! Chaste goddess of the groves! let thy fair beam My path irradiate, and direct my steps, 'Till to their native walls, I lead triumphant My faithful warriors,âlet inspiring sounds The soldier's bosom chear,âlead on, Tigranes. [A grand march. SCENE II. An Apartment in the Palace. ATHRIDATES, ORCHANES. ATHRIDATES. Are my commands obey'd? ORCHANES. My royal lord! The reinforce ment to Domitius sent Has reach'd his camp. Within the citadel, Beneath Artaxias' care, I plac'd the queen; The guards are doubled. ATHRIDATES. Her imperious spirit Perhaps resisted! ORCHANES. When I led my files To her apartment, with a haughty air, She wav'd her hand, to warn them from her presence; But when I told her by your dread command They came, obedient, to conduct her thence; She paus'd a momentâthen majestic rose And cry'd, âObey your king.â ATHRIDATES. Say, didst thou mark The meeting with her son? ORCHANES. The tender scene Unmann'd my soldier's heart; she spoke not, wept not; A deadly pale o'erspread her fading cheek; Her panting bosom heav'd; beat quick, and short: She snatch'd him to her breast, gaz'd wildly on him, Breath'd a convulsive sigh, then, void of sense, Sunk motionless to earth. ATHRIDATES. Behold Artaxias! SCENE III. ATHRIDATES, ARTAXIAS, ORCHANES. ATHRIDATES. What means?âSay wherefore? ARTAXIAS. Royal Athridates! Blame not your faithful servant; but the queenâ ATHRIDATES. What of the queen? Why hast thou left!âbeware, Thy life shall answerâ ARTAXIAS. By an armed band Forc'd from the citadelâ ATHRIDATES. Thou hast not sure, Confederate with herâ ARTAXIAS. In your royal daughter Our warriors saw their princess, and rever'd The blood of Cappadocia's honor'd kings. With all th' impassion'd eloquence of nature, The strong emotion of a mother's love, She spoke her griefs; they heard with mute attention, And stood like statues, whilst with sudden step She gain'd the portal; her maternal hand Her infant son conducted. Teramenes, The leader of her guards, by you entrusted, Gain'd by her tears, and faithless to his charge, The massy gates unbarr'd. The moment seizing, With force to ours superior, Artabanes, Who waited near, rush'd in, and bore them off Towards Themis' temple. ATHRIDATES. Let us swift pursue. Orchanes, thou art faithful; by each God Potent in war I swear, their blood shall flow On fierce Bellona's altar, till the manes Of my lov'd son shall cease to call for vengeance. A chosen band attend me to the temple. SCENE IV. The Portico of the Temple of Themis, the Gates open; at a little distance within, an Altar; Thamyris and Eumenes kneeling before it, with Branches of Olive in their Hands. THAMYRIS, EUMENES, ORONTES, two other Priests attending. Orontes comes down the Stage. What daughter of affliction, at this hour Of solemn midnight, with dejected mien, With suppliant wreaths, and hands to heav'n uprais'd, Seeks the protection of all-righteous Themis? THAMYRIS. Thy queen. ORONTES. Immortal powers! Do I behold My sovereign here, a suppliant in the fane, Her piety to heaven first taught to rise! And seeking that protection, which so late Among the sceptred rulers of the earth 'Twas hers to grant! THAMYRIS. O, by this holy fane, This altar, where my soul submissive bends, And by the sacred majesty of heaven, I here adjure thee, from the savage grasp Of merciless oppression save my child! ORONTES. Thy virtues to the gods have made thee dear; Speak thy request, and find a full compliance. THAMYRIS. Blame not these tears, they flow not for myself; I have a nearer care, which rends my soul, And gives distress its poignancy; O save This helpless, uncomplaining innocence From ills he knows not! ORONTES. Thou illustrious mourner! Chace every anxious fear, and with thy son Safe at the altar rest. THAMYRIS. Thou wilt forgive A trembling mother's weakness!ânot, Orontes, Not that my doubting heartâI know not what My woman's fears would sayâBut wilt thou lead him? Wilt thou within the temple's last recess Hide him from treason? murder? Athridates? ORONTES. Injurious to the gracious gods, O queen, Thy causeless terrors rise; from this retreat, These hallow'd walls, oppression, aw'd, recoils, Nor dares prophane th' asylum of the wretched. Yet heav'n allows thy prayer; the faults which spring From nature's fond excess, the powers divine With mild indulgence view. Thyself conduct, And place him by the goddess' awful statue. Arsames, wait the queen. THAMYRIS. Thus let me thank thee; A few short moments must decide our fate: My lord, if spar'd by the wild rage of war, Approaches swift to save. If he is fallen, This child is Pontus' last remaining hope: O! guard the precious pledge! my life is nothing. ORONTES. What hasty steps! (advances to the front of the portico) The hostile bands draw near: Fierce Athridates comes. Retire, O queen! With calm submission wait the will divine. THAMYRIS. May pitying heaven to this devoted breast Direct his erring sword, and save Eumenes! SCENE V. ATHRIDATES, ORONTES, ORCHANES. ATHRIDATES. Thou blind to fate, who, fearless of my wrath, Hast dar'd protect my victims! hence, nor brave An injur'd monarch's fury; this right arm, Unless thou giv'st them instant to my sword, (Unaw'd by superstition's gloomy terrors) Shall seize, and drag them to the death which waits them. ORONTES. Stop, Athridates, nor with impious step Prophane this holy place.âI know thy rights, The reverence due to thrones; nor thou forget The power which plac'd the sceptre in thy hand, And can resume the gift. Unaided, weak, No conquering bands protect us; but the gods War on our side; th' imperial Lord of Heaven Is our support, this temple our defence; And if thy rage with lawless force invades This sacred fane, the blest abode of peace, 'Tis o'er my bleeding corse thou must approach The violated altars. ATHRIDATES. Dost thou think With shadowy fears to shake a soul resolv'd? Can thy enervate arm, thy feeble altars, Save from their fate the captives of my sword? Retire, nor bar my way, or see, involv'd In rising flames, and trembling to its base, Thy boasted temple fall. ORONTES. Away, blasphemer!â But heaven, indignant, wills thee to compleat The sum of thy offences. With compassion, Elate I see thee, vain of transient power Nor once revolving the uncertain state Of wretched man, by flattering hope betray'd. This hour is thine, the next is hid in clouds. ATHRIDATES. This hour shall then revenge me; swift advance, And aid your master's justice. SCENE VI. ATHRIDATES, ARTAXIAS, ORONTES. ARTAXIAS. Royal sir, Lose not a momentâon a slender thread Your very being hangs. The troops of Pontus (Pharnaces at their head) are in the city: I saw them from the citadel descending, And flew to save your sacred life. ATHRIDATES. Confusion! By heaven 'tis falseâthe phantom of thy fear! ARTAXIAS. Believe your faithful servant. Artabanes Conducts the king this way; o'er all the city Tumultuous shouts of transport rend the air; The maddening people arm; and even your troops, The Cappadocians, murmur, and arraign Your purpos'd vengeance. ATHRIDATES. Summon to our aid The Roman veterans. ARTAXIAS. From th' exulting victors This more I learn'dâthe Roman legions, vanquish'd, Already pass the mountains. ATHRIDATES. Curses blast them! Wither their coward nerves, and give them up To galling chains; a prey ev'n to Pharnaces! [Clashing of swordsâA shout.] ARTAXIAS. He comes; and now too lateâ PHARNACES (behind). Away, Tigranes, First stop the foaming torrent in its course. Where is this tyrant who defies the Gods? This monarch, fam'd for violated vows? This father, thirsting for his children's blood? SCENE VII. ATHRIDATES, ARTAXIAS, PHARNACES, ARTABANES, TIGRANES, and Soldiers. ATHRIDATES. Behold him here, and tremble at his vengeance! PHARNACES. The righteous gods have given him to my sword. Die, monster, die! and let thy thirst of blood In thy own blood be sated. SCENE VIII. THAMYRIS, PHARNACES, ATHRIDATES, ARTABANES, TIGRANES, ORCHANES, and Soldiers. THAMYRIS. (Rushing from the Temple, and catching Athridates in her arms.) Stop, inhuman! Or through this bosomâ ATHRIDATES. Hence; thy woman's weakness Blasts my unsullied fame. PHARNACES. Would'st thou defend him?â This tyrant!â THAMYRIS. Is my fatherâ PHARNACES. He seeks thy lifeâ THAMYRIS. He gave it.âIf thy wrongs Demand a victim, strikeâstrike here, Pharnaces; But spare his sacred lifeâ PHARNACES. Thou hast prevaild: Thy virtue has disarm'd, and giv'n me back To honour's better purpose. To the brave A conquer'd foe is sacred. Athridates, Receive thy life, thy kingdom. ATHRIDATES. I disdain A life thy gift; my firm unconquer'd soul Rejects thy offer'd mercy. Athridates Will, still a monarch, join his ancestors: This blow, and all is well. (Stabs himself.) THAMYRIS. O fatal rashness!â PHARNACES. Why, Athridates, hast thou robb'd my heart Of that best joy, the transport of forgiving? ATHRIDATES. Too far, Pharnaces, has my rage pursuedâ Too deep has vengeance drain'd the cup of deathâ Come near, my daughter: take my last embrace. Canst thou forgive thy wrongs? The mist of passion Fades from my dying eyes, and sets thy goodness, Thy filial piety, in dread arrayâ Ye Cappadocian warriors, see your queen! Thy arm, Artaxiasâinstant lead me henceâ I would not with my last expiring groans Prophane this holy temple. THAMYRIS. Powers of mercy! Yet spare his days! ATHRIDATES. And dost thou weep for me? Whose unrelenting handâmy breath grows shortâ I can no moreâI faintâa sudden darknessâ I dieâmy childâfarewellâfarewell for ever! (Falls into the arms of Orchanes and Artaxias.) THAMYRIS. My breaking heartâa moment moreâmy father! He diesâ'tis past!â (Artaxias and Orchanes bear off the body of Athridates.) SCENE IX. THAMYRIS, PHARNACES. PHARNACES. There fled th' indignant spirit: A sad example of the ills which flow From fell revenge, and fury unrestrain'd. Turn from that sight of woe, and let thy heart [to Thamyris] With other feelings, with a mother's transport Expand, and glow with gratitude to heaven For thy Eumenes' life. Whilst Pharnaces is speaking, Orontes leads Eumenes down the stage, and presents him to Pharnaces and Thamyris. SCENE X. THAMYRIS, PHARNACES, EUMENES, ORONTES. THAMYRIS. My child!âmy child! PHARNACES. My boy!âmy kingdom's hope!âDo I once more, With all a parent's heartfelt tenderness, A parent's joy, behold thee? To the power Whose hand has sav'd us, let the victim bleed, The pure libation flow, the fragrant incense In spiry clouds ascend! THAMYRIS. Alas, my lord! E'en 'midst the soft delight that fills my soul For thine, and my Eumenes' dangers past, My father's fate rends my divided heart, Checks the fond rapture, prompts the plaintive sigh, And calls, unbid, the tender filial tear. ORONTES. That tear, O queen! is graceful: but remember Thy son, thy husband, subjects, bid thee chace These unavailing sorrows; and, with heart Resign'd and humble, bow to awful heaven For safety, life, and empire. PHARNACES. Power Supreme! Great universal Lord! from this fair hour Let Cappadocia's sons, with Pontus' join'd, Beneath a milder sway forget their toils! Though long divided by the arts of Rome, Whose wild ambition sets the world in arms, The kindred nations in each other's blood Their frantic swords imbrued. Do thou inspire The gentler purpose! And, amid the joys Of sacred peace, a firm, united band, Be it their glory to obey the laws Fram'd for the general good; and ours to find The wreathe of conquest in our people's love. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Written by a FRIEND, And spoken by Mrs. YATES. In all this bustle, rage, and tragic roar, Which some wits here politely call a bore, Have I not wept, and rav'd, and tore my hair, Till some I forc'd to weep, and some to stare? Yet now I must, by custom, to divert you, Tell what I think of this heroic virtue. Mirth has increas'd, when tragedies are finish'd, Increases still, and must not be diminish'd. Alive your passion tho' our play may keep, Behind the curtain you must have a peep. Tho' bright the tragic character appear, Our private foibles you delight to hear. In life's great drama the same rule we find: When on that stage the patron of mankind Performs his partâthe public virtues strike, But 'tis the secret anecdote we like. If there a Patriot rave with furious might, And love his countryâout of downright spite; It passes for a copy of his face; Has he not been to Court to beg a Place? When some bright Orator his country's cause Sustains, and talks of Liberty and Laws, Hear, hear, all cry; in attitude he stands, Sprawling his feet, and stretching forth his hands; âIn this petition, Sirâthe nation begs; âAnd, Mr. Speakerâwhile I'm upon my legs; âAnd, Sirâour ancestorsâand whig and tory; âAnd, Sirâthe laws;âand, SirâGreat Britain's glory!â All gaze; all wonder; such amazing powers! But how does he employ his private hours? The nation sav'd, he hurries, in a trice, To shake the box, and be undone at dice. Some Politicians figure in debate, Then sleepâto shew the quiet of the State. Your Hollanders, when treachery is ripe, Break every treaty, and thenâsmoke their pipe. If by remonstrances you try to mend them, Mynheer smokes onââ'tis all ad referendum.â We storm upon the stage th' impassion'd breast, Then come, and turn all sympathy to jest. And yet, shall flippant mirth, and giddy joy, The best impressions of the heart destroy? 'Tis yours, ye fair, to quell our Author's fear; A Female Poet draws the tender tear. True to her sex, she copies from the life The Mother, Daughter, and the faithful Wife. Let her this night your kind protection gain, The Critic then will parody in vain. And let fair Virtue, ere she quit the age, Here pause awhileâand linger on the stage.</field>
