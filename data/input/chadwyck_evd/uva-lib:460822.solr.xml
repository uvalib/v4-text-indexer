      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Creon. HÃ¦mon. Antigone. Argia. Guards. Soldiers of HÃ¦mon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe Palace in Thebes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Argia. Ar. Argia, thou art now at last in Thebes ... After the rapid journey I need rest ... Oh how, as if by flight, I came from Argos! Faithful MenÃ¦tes, thou, infirm with age, Couldst scarce keep pace with me. But yet I am In Thebes. The shades of night a friendly aid Lent to my enterprise; unseen I entered. This is the horrible palace of my spouse, Too well beloved, this is the tomb and cradle. Oh, Polinices! ... thy insidious brother Here, in thy blood, his thirst for vengeance sated. Thy squalid shade, yet unavenged, still strays Around these walls, and spurns sepulchral rites In impious Thebes, so near thy cruel brother. It seems thou beckonest me to Argos still ... To thee a sure asylum Argos was; Ah, hadst thou never moved thy feet from thence! I come, I come, for thy most sacred dust. Antigone alone, that faithful sister, By thee so justly and so much beloved, With pious hands can aid me to regain it. Oh, how I love her! oh, what soothing thoughts Will give a transient softness to my grief, In seeing, knowing, and embracing her! Yes, here, with her, upon that gelid urn, Which should belong to me, I come to weep: And shall belong: a sister to a wife Cannot refuse it. Ah! our only child, Behold the gift I bring thee back to Argos; Thy sole inheritance; thy father's urn! But where does my incautious sorrow lead me? Shall I, an Argive, be in Thebes, and not Remember where I am? I wait the hour In which Antigone may venture forth. How shall I know her? ... And should I be seen? ... Oh, heavens! 'tis now that I begin to tremble; ... Alone in Thebes ... oh! ... heard I not a step? Alas! what can I say? ... By what contrivance? ... I will conceal myself. SCENE THE SECOND. Antigone. Ant. This is the palace: The night is dark: quick; let me hence depart ... What? do I hesitate? and do my feet Stagger beneath my weight? Why tremble thus? Whence all this apprehension? Do I plan Aught that is criminal? Do I fear death? I fear alone not to atchieve my task. Oh, Polinices! oh, beloved brother! Oh, wept till now in vain! ... The time is past For tears alone ... now is the time for action. I feel myself superior to my sex: Yes, on this day, in spite of cruel Creon, Thou shalt from me receive funereal honours: Yes, thou shalt now receive a sister's life, Or from her hands the last sad obsequies. Oh Night, who on this spot, of light unworthy, Shouldst reign eternally, oh pall thyself In thy most dense, impenetrable glooms, To second thus my lofty purposes. Conceal me from the vigilant espial Of royal satellites: I hope in thee. Ye gods, if ye have not expressly sworn, That, in this Thebes, no pious ceremony Shall e'er be consummated, I but ask So much of life as may ensure performance To this one act of sisterly affection. Let me press forward: holy is the office: A holy impulse urges me to action, A lofty impulse of fraternal love ... But who pursues me? Ah! I am betrayed ... A female comes to me? Who art thou? speak ... SCENE THE THIRD. Argia, Antigone. Ar. I am a child of woe. Ant. What seekest thou Within these thresholds at so late an hour? Ar. I ... seek ... Antigone ... Ant. But who art thou? Know'st thou Antigone? To her art known? What wantest thou with her? 'Twixt her and thee What common interest? Ar. That of grief and pity ... Ant. Pity? Darest thou pronounce that word in Thebes? Know'st not that Creon reigns in Thebes? Perchance He is a stranger to thee? Ar. A few hours I've been in Thebes. Ant. And darest thou, in this palace, By stealth, a stranger, introduce thyself? Ar. If in this palace I a stranger am, It is the fault of Thebes: here I should not Hear myself so accosted. Ant. What say'st thou? Where wert thou born? Ar. In Argos. Ant. Fatal name! With horror it inspires me! Had it been Always unknown to me, I had not lived In everlasting tears. Ar. If such distress Argos in thee excites, Thebes causes me Perpetual regret. Ant. There is a tone That moves me in thy accents. I would sooth Thy griefs by sympathy, if any griefs Except my own could move me. I should be As much disposed to listen to thy tale, As thou couldst be to tell it; but, alas! Time now to me is wanting, who lament A much-loved brother. Ar. Ah! it must be she: Antigone thou art ... Ant. ... But ... thou ... Ar. 'Tis she. I am Argia; the unhappy widow Of thy loved brother. Ant. What is it I hear? Ar. My only hope, my only consolation, Beloved sister, I at last embrace thee. Scarce hadst thou spoken, ere thy tones recalled The voice of Polinices: 'twas a sound Inspiring boldness in my trembling heart, And drew me from my hiding place to meet thee. How blest am I! ... I find thee ... Suffer me, Ah, do thou grant, that, 'mid embraces kind, To my long-pent-up tears, upon thy bosom I may, at last, give unrestrain'd indulgence. Ant. Ah, how I tremble! Daughter of Adrastes, Art thou in Thebes? within these guilty thresholds? In Creon's power! Ah, unexpected sight! Sight not less dear than painful! Ar. In this palace, In which thou hoped'st to enjoy my presence, And where I hoped for thine, is this thy welcome? Ant. Dear art thou to me, more than a sister dear ... Ah, Polinices knew how much I loved thee; To me, thy countenance alone was strange; Thy manners, disposition, and thy heart, Thy mighty love for him, I knew it all. E'en as he loved I love thee: but I wish'd not, Nor wish I now, to see thee in this palace ... A thousand fatal perils here surround thee. Ar. Canst thou suppose me capable of fear, Now my loved Polinices is no more? What is there left to lose, what to desire? Let me once fold thee to my breast and die. Ant. Here thou may'st have a death unworthy of thee. Ar. Die howsoe'er I may, if that I die Upon the tomb of my beloved husband, That death will be most worthy, and most welcome. Ant. What is it that thou say'st? ... alas! ... his tomb! To him, who is thy husband and my brother, A little dust to cover his dead body In Thebes, within his very palace gates, Is interdicted. Ar. But the unburied corse? Ant. Lies on the plain, exposed to beasts of prey. Ar. To the plain I fly. Ant. Ah, check thy eagerness! Creon, the barbarous Creon, swoln with pride, From the possession of the usurped throne, Braves fearlessly the laws, the ties of nature, And, more than these, the gods; not satisfied With interdicting from the sons of Argos All sepulture, a barbarous death awaits Those, who, in secret, give to them a tomb. Ar. My spouse a prey to wild beasts on the plain! And through that very plain e'en now I passed. And did I leave thee there? ... Now the sixth day Dawns since he fell transfix'd by his fierce brother; And uninterr'd, and naked there he lies! His bones there âwelter to the parching winds,â From his paternal palace thus by force Excluded? and a mother suffers it? Ant. Beloved Argia, thou dost not yet know The extent of our unparallel'd misfortunes. No sooner had Jocasta seen accomplish'd The horrid fratricide, (ah, wretched queen!) She shed no tears, nor made the air resound With loud laments: unutterable grief All speech, all natural emotion, palsied; Her stony eye-balls, motionless and dry, Upon the ground she fix'd: from Erebus, The shades of murder'd Laius, of her sons, Stabb'd interchangeably each by the other, With a tremendous vehemence she summon'd. They rose before her eyes; for a long time, Upon the spectral visions it had raised, Her madden'd phantasy did strangely feed With passionate eagerness: she struggled long, And mid reiterated throes of anguish, At last regain'd her reason: by her side She saw her matrons, and her desolate daughter. She was resolved to die, but spake it not; And thus she feigned, the better to delude us ... Incautious as I was, I was deluded. I ought not to have left her. She made shew Of wishing to give nature the repose It so much wanted; I indulged her wish, And from her side departed: she had snatched The sword, from his yet palpitating side, Of Polinices; with more promptitude, Than I can tell it thee, in her own breast Plunged it, and fell, and breathed her latest sigh ... And I, why do I live? ... the impure remnant Of such an impure race, I also ought To plunge the same sword in my lonely heart: But pity seized me for my sightless father, My wretched father, neither dead nor living. For him have I endured the abhorred light; And for his tremulous age preserve myself. Ar. For Ådipus? ... On him should rather fall, On him alone, the horror of his crimes. Does he then live, and Polinices die? Ant. Ah, wretched Ådipus, hadst thou but seen him? He of our Polinices is the sire, And pangs e'en greater than his fault endures. Laden with sorrow, indigent, and blind, A banished man, a wanderer, he goes From Thebes. The tyrant dared to drive him thence. Ah, wretched Ådipus! to tell his name He will not venture: on our hated heads, On Creon, Thebes, and even on the Gods, Blasphemous imprecations he will heap. I had decreed myself to be the prop Of his blind, vacillating feebleness; But I was torn from him by force, and here Constrain'd to tarry: thus the Gods might will; For scarcely had my father left the city, Ere Creon, the unheard-of prohibition Touching the sepulture of Argives slain Promulgated; and who, except myself, In Thebes, had ventured to defy its penance? Ar. Who, if not I, should share with thee the toil? Here Heaven impell'd me wisely. To obtain Of thee the honour'd relics I came hither: Beyond my hope, I here arrive in time To see again, and to my bosom clasp That form adored; to wash with my warm tears That execrable wound; to pacify, With rites funereal, the unquiet shade ... Why do we longer tarry? Sister, come ... Ant. Yes, to this holy office let us go; But go, like victims, to appointed death; I ought to do it, and I wish to die: I have nothing in the world except my father, And he is torn from me; death I expect, And death I wish for. Leave me to construct itâ Thou, who shouldst life still prizeâthat funeral pile, Which will unite me with my much-loved brother. E'en while he lived his soul and mine were one: Ah, may one flame consume our forms, and leave One undistinguishable heap of dust. Ar. And ought not I to die? What dost thou say? Dost thou thus wish to conquer me in grief? Equals we were in love; do I say equals? No, mine was most profound. Ah, deeper far Is a wife's love than sisters can conceive! Ant. Argia, I will not dispute with thee About our love: thy death I will oppose. Thou art a widow: what a husband thou Hast lost I know: but thou, like me, of incest Art not the fruit: thou hast a mother still: Like mine, thy father is not blind, or outcast; Norâworse than all of theseâa father guilty. The more propitious gods to thee have given No brothers, who have emulously bathed Each in the other's blood their murderous swords. The literal translation of the passage in the original, isâ âAh, be not then offended, if I wish To die alone!â I hope, that, in this instance, I may be excused from obeying an impulse, which almost involuntarily led me to amplify the passage.Think it not hard, then, if I, so far severed From thee by woes unparallel'd in life, As one that's incommunicably stricken, Covet self-sacrifice unshared by any. Ere I was born my life was forfeited. Return to Argos ... Hast thou not forgotten? Thou still hast there a living pledge of love; There, in thy child, thou hast the living image Of Polinices: ah! return to Argos; Rejoice the heart of thy despairing father, Who knows not where thou art; go, I conjure thee: No eye hath seen thee on these thresholds yet; Yet thou hast time. Leave me alone to brave The fatal prohibition. Ar. Ah, my son? I love him; yes, I love thee: but wouldst thou That I should fly, if death is here decreed For Polinices? Thou misjudgest me. Adrastes will protect my little one, To him will be a father. I, alas! Should bring him up in tears; while he should be To courage and to vengeance disciplined. There is no threat, no terror, that can scare me From the beholding his beloved corse. My Polinices, shall another yield thee The last commemorative obsequies? Ant. Wilt yield thy neck to the Theban battle-axe? Ar. It is the penalty that's infamous, And not the punishment. The infamy Will fall on Creon should we be condemn'd. All will feel horror when they hear his name; Pity when they hear ours ... Ant. And wilt thou take From me such glory? Ar. I will see my husband, And die upon his bosom. Tell me, sister, What right hast thou my right to controvert? Thou who didst see him die, and livest yet ... Ant. Now I believe thee equal to myself. At first, I felt myself, against my will, Constrained to ascertain what female fears Might in thy bosom lurk: I doubted not The depth of thy affection, but thy courage. Ar. Who is not made courageous by despair? But, if I merited thy brother's love, Could I in thought, or action, be ignoble? Ant. Pardon me, sister: truly do I love thee; I tremble; and thy destiny alarms me. But thou'rt determined? Let us then depart. With the devoted race of Ådipus, May Heaven confound thee not! The night appears More black than usual: certainly the gods For us have darken'd it. Take special care, Sister, to check thy tears; more than aught else They would betray us. The fierce satellites Of Creon rigorously guard the plain: To them may nought betray us, till the flames Consuming the inanimate body, blaze. Ar. I will not weep; ... but thou; ... wilt thou not weep? Ant. We will weep silently. Ar. Art thou informed On what part of the plain his body lies? Ant. Let us depart: I know where it was thrown By Creon's impious mercenaries. Come. Lugubrious torches I will take with me: Some sparks with which to light them, we will there From flint elicit. Hence, without delay! Silently bold accompany my steps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Creon, HÃ¦mon. Cre. But what? Thou only in my joy, oh son, Takest no part? Thy father thou beholdest Upon the throne of Thebes; he has secured The sceptre as thy firm inheritance. Whence then these lamentations? Dost thou grieve For Ådipus, or his devoted race? HÃ¦m. Does my compassion, then, for Ådipus, And his descendants, seem to thee a crime? Oh father, from the throne there issued not, On the dire day on which thou didst ascend it, Such an auspicious and absorbing radiance, At least to my dimm'd eyes, as to dispel The boding images that flitted round it. Thou, perhaps, one day may'st bitterly repent The acquisition of the Theban sceptre. Cre. I rather should repent, if need there were Of penitence, that, for so long a time, I had submissive been to guilty nephews, Flagitious children of incestuous parents. But if they have, for their atrocious birth, By a still more atrocious death atoned, Let everlasting silence be their doom. Scarce is their destiny fulfill'd, when, lo! O'er Thebes the day-star more benignly rises, The air is more serene, the gods themselves Regard us more propitiously: ah, yes, I feel exulting hope of better days. HÃ¦m. All expectation, but of wretchedness, Is baffled by th'event, amid the ruin And death of those, to whom, by ties of blood, We are most closely join'd. A king of Thebes, (For King of Thebes he still must be accounted) Ådipus, exiled, blind, and fugitive, To universal and astonished Greece, Presents a spectacle ne'er seen before: Two brothers, murderers of each other; brothers Of their own sire; sons of incestuous mother, Sister to thee, and by her own hands slain: Thou seest a horrid mixture of all names; A horrid chaos of distress and slaughter. Behold the auspices, behold the track, By which thou hast ascended to the throne. Ah, father! canst thou possibly be joyful? Cre. Ådipus, only, with his longer tarriance On this contaminated spot, had given A signal to the vengeance of the gods; It was our duty to get rid of him. But thou hast not, without omission, stated All our afflictions. Impious Ådipus! What hast thou not cost me? I also shed Tears for a son beloved; thy elder brother, MenÃ¦ceus, he, in whom the foolish frauds, The lying, and pernicious prophecies, Of a Tiresias, credence did obtain: MenÃ¦ceus, to self-sacrifice devoted, To save his country; by self-murder slain; While Ådipus yet lives? Perpetual exile Is a light vengeance for his many crimes. But let him bear with him to other shores, That which will follow him where'er he goes, The malediction of the angry gods. Our tears will not undo what has been done; 'Tis now our duty to forget the past, And to grasp fortune, while we may, by force. HÃ¦m. Unstable goddess, to secure her smiles I'll not compel my heart! Oh, father, fear, For there is cause, the anger of the gods! Thy cruel prohibition, that prevents The haughty and unburied shades of Greece From passing Acheron, will wake their vengeance. What art thou doing? With prosperity, And with a throne, elated, know'st thou not That Polinices boasts a royal birth, Sprung from a mother who to thee was sister? And shall he lie dishonour'd on the plain? At least permit, that the unburied corse Of him, who is thy nephew, may be burnt. Ah, to the sad Antigone, who sees Of all her family the timeless end, The body yield of her beloved brother. Cre. As were her impious brothers, is not she Of Ådipus the offspring? HÃ¦m. As 'twas theirs, The throne of Thebes by inheritance is hers. Thou surely wouldst not scruple for a kingdom, To barter a dead body? Cre. She is my foe ... HÃ¦m. Believe it not. Cre. Loves she not Polinices? Her father too? Creon she then abhors. HÃ¦m. Wouldst thou, oh heavens! that she should not feel, Or for her father, or her brothers, pity? Perhaps, if she were inhuman, she might gain A more distinguished place in thy esteem. Cre. No; not esteem her more, but hate her less. A monarch should forestall another's hate, And deem each man a foe that he's offended. I have from fierce Antigone removed Every pretext, in banishing her father. Had they together both in exile gone, They might have found, as wanderers, a king, Who, under the affected veil of pity, Conceal'd a wish his empire to augment; And who, in their defence, might come to Thebes As did Adrastes, arm'd. I hear thee blame My prohibition, son, to which by motives Deep, yet unfit for thy partaking in them, I was impell'd. They will be known to thee; And thou wilt see, that, though it may appear A cruel law, 'tis indispensable. HÃ¦m. The cause unknown to me! dost thou say so? I fear that thou art ignorant of the effects. Yes, for her exiled father, for her throne Usurp'd unjustly, for th'unburied corse Of Polinices, without seeking it, Antigone in Thebes may find revenge. The people, by thy prohibition stung, Murmur, and rail at it without disguise; They long for its evasion; and, at length, Will openly infringe it. Cre. Be it so. It is my wish; that I may have the life Of him who first may venture to infringe it. HÃ¦m. Ah! what fierce enemy can counsel thee Thus to contribute to thy own destruction? Cre. My love for thee is my sole counsellor: Of what thou blamest thou shalt reap the fruit. Long have the citizens in Thebes been wont To witness crimes of darker hue than these; What can they now intend, but to submit And to be silent? HÃ¦m. Oft beneath such silence Vengeance lies couch'd ... Cre. The silence of the few; But in the silence of an entire people Lie hidden fear, and abject servitude. Ah cease, oh son, to oppose thy father's views! No object of solicitude have I More dear, or more important, than thyself: Thou only now remain'st to me; alone Shall reap the fruits of my anxieties. Perhaps thou intendest, ere his days are spent, To prove thyself ungrateful to thy father! But whence this clank of fetters and of arms? HÃ¦m. Ah, who advances? ... In hard fetters bound Two ladies dragg'd along? ... Antigone! ... Cre. Th'incautious virgin in my snares hath fallen; And ill can she escape. SCENE THE SECOND. Guards, with Torches. Antigone, Argia, Creon, HÃ¦mon. Cre. What is the crime these virgins have committed? Ant. I will declare it. Cre. Let them be conducted A little further. Ant. In thy sight behold me Mine own accuser. I have defied thy laws: On the funereal pyre I have burn'd my brother. Cre. And thou shalt have the threaten'd recompense; From me, without delay, thou shalt receive it.â But thou, whose face I do not recognise, Thou, whose attire bespeaks thee here a stranger, Who art thou? Speak ... Ar. The rival of her virtue. HÃ¦m. Ah, father, calm thy anger! female boldness Deserves not the resentment of a king. Cre. Resentment? What sayst thou, misdeeming youth! An unperturbed judge I listen to them: Death is already theirs: let this strange lady First tell her name, and then they both shall have The challenged retribution. Ant. I alone Will have that retribution. On the plain I found this lady; it was I that shewed To her my brother's corse; by Heaven conducted, Thy satellites' unwary vigilance I baffled; and invited her to aid me In such a holy office: she complied: And with her hand gave me a little help. I know not who she is; in Thebes ne'er saw her; Perchance she is from Argos, and intended T'embrace, but not to burn, some of her friends, Who in the battle fell ... Ar. Now, now, indeed, Should I be guilty, and should well deserve The direst punishment, if, urged by fear, I dared to disavow a deed so sacred. Flagitious king! learn then my name; exult, And triumph, when thou hear'st it ... Ant. Ah! be silent ... Ar. Adrastes' daughter; Polinices' spouse; I am Argia. HÃ¦m. What is it I hear? Cre. Oh, worthy pair! ye are by Heaven delivered Into my hands: of its just punishment The heavens have chosen me the minister. But, gentle lady, hast thou not brought with thee The tender pledge of thy too transient love? For thou art mother of a little heir Of Thebes; where is he? he can also boast The blood of Ådipus: Thebes longs to see him. HÃ¦m. Oh! I am horror-stricken ... to hear thee, shudder ... Thou, who hast lost a son, dar'st thou with jeers To exacerbate a wretched mother's woe? One mourns a husband; one a brother mourns; And thou canst mock them? 'tis too horrible! ... Ant. Oh thou too worthy son for such a father! Do not degrade us with thy intercession: Where Creon reigns to be adjudged to death, Is a sure proof of lofty innocence. Cre. Pour out, pour out, thy impotent upbraidings; For they offend not me: thou art most welcome, So as thou hast it, to make light of death. Ar. On me turn all thy rage; on me alone! Hither I came alone, unknown to all, By stealth; an entrance in these thresholds gain'd By night, on purpose to defy thy laws. The bosom of Antigone, 'tis true, Swell'd with suppress'd resentment; she revolved A thousand schemes; but silently she bore The horrid prohibition; and had never, Had I not hither come, incurr'd its penance. He is the criminal that plans the crime: On the contriver falls the penalty. Ant. Ah, trust her not: inopportune compassion, Vain generosity, her words inspire. That she, by stealth, these thresholds past is true, But then she knew not thy despotic law: She sought me here; trembling and apprehensive; And, at my hand, required the fatal urn Of her beloved lord. Hence, 'tis apparent The fame of thy inhuman prohibition Had not reach'd Argos. I do not pretend That she did hate thee not as well as me, (Who does not hate thee?) but she feared thee more; She hoped to be invisible to thee, (Too credulous, alas!) and fly from hence With the possession of the sacred ashes, To bear them back to Argos, and enshrine them There in a consecrated monument. Not these my hopes, who, from the first conception Of this design, aspired to be thy victim, And to be summon'd thus to brave thy presence: To be there I exult; and to thee swear, That much as she, nay more than she, I hate thee; That I, the unextinguishable flame Of hatred and revenge, with which I burn, Into her breast transfused: mine is the pride, Mine is the hardihood, and all the rage With which she now invests herself, is mine. Cre. Perfidious pair! in vain each strives to prove Herself proficient most in infamy. I shall soon shew to you, betwixt you two, Which is the vilest. Death, most infamous, Such as is fitting, waits you both; ah! then Another rivalship of tears, and prayers, Of groans, will ye exhibit. HÃ¦m. Oh, my father! To death most infamous? That cannot be: Thou wilt not do it, no; to mitigate Thy bitter vengeance, if compassion may not, Reflection may constrain thee. Of Adrastes, A potent king, Argia is the daughter; Thou hast had proof Adrastes knows the way To Thebes, and he may visit us once more. Cre. Then, ere Adrastes visit us once more, Argia shall be immolated. What? Dost think by fear to make me pity feel? Ar. Adrastes cannot now return to Thebes; The heavens, the time, to him are unpropitious; His troops, his treasures, and his arms, exhausted, He cannot now avenge me. Fear not, Creon! Slay me, ah, slay me, and it will not be That now Adrastes can chastise thee for it. Yes, be Argia slain; since to her murderer No consequence of evil can ensue; But spare, ah, spare Antigone; for her, And in her cause, by thousands and by thousands, Desperate avengers will arise in Thebes. Ant. Ah cease, oh sister! do not thus misjudge The tyrant thou accostest: he is cruel: But not by chance, or to no purpose, cruel. I now have hopes for thee; I see already That I suffice for him, and I exult. He wills to have the throne, thou hast it not: But, by a misadventurous right, that throne, Which he desires, which he usurps, is mine. Ambition points me out, and me alone, To be his victim. Cre. Thine, sayst thou, this throne? Infamous progeny of incest, death, And not a kingdom, is your heritage. Did not thy impious brothers prove this truth, The murderers of each other? Ant. Impious thou, Impious and vile! who to the deed of death Didst goad them on by fraudulent contrivance. If 'twas our crime to be our brother's children, It was our punishment to be thy nephews. Thou wast the author of the guilty war; Thou the fomenter of fraternal hate; Thou artfully didst fan the angry flame; One thou didst instigate, the other flatter, And both thou didst betray. And by such arts Thou clear'dst the way to infamy and the throne. HÃ¦m. Art thou determined on thine own destruction? Ant. I am determined, that, for once at least, The tyrant shall hear truth. Do I see one Around him that dare speak it to him? Oh! If thou the agonies of thy remorse, As thou the tongues of all mankind couldst silence, How perfect then, oh Creon, were thy joy! But even more so than thou art to others, To thyself hateful, in thy restless eye, Thy restless and thy circumspective eye, Both crime and punishment are legible. Cre. There was no need of fraudulent contrivance To goad to death the abominable brothers Of their own father: all the angry gods Were emulous t'accelerate that death. Ant. Why dost thou name the gods? What god hast thou Except the expedient for thyself alone? To this omnivorous deity, thy friends, Thy son, thy fame itself, if these thou hadst, Thou holdst thyself in readiness to immolate. Cre. Hast thou aught else to say to me? Thou know'st That different offsprings different gods appease. Thou art a victim to the infernal destined, The last, and worthy of thy impious race, Thou shalt be offered as a fierce atonement. HÃ¦m. Father, suspend a little the fulfilment Of the dread sentence. I first ask of thee A transient audience, to communicate To thee some matters of the last importance. Cre. Some unmolested hours they yet may pass Of the unfinished night. I have determined, Within myself, the moment of her doom. Soon as the sun arises I will hear thee. Ar. Alas! thou speakest only of my sister? Now, indeed, I do tremble. Wilt thou not Condemn me with Antigone to death? Cre. No more delay: let them be both confined Within the horrors of the darkest dungeon. Ar. Together we shall go. Ant. Ah, sister, yes. Cre. They shall be separated. I myself Will be the keeper of Antigone. Let us depart. Guards, to another dungeon Consign Argia. HÃ¦m. Oh, 'tis too horrible! Ant. Ah, come ... Ar. Sister, farewell. HÃ¦m. I will, at least, Pursue their steps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Creon, HÃ¦mon. Cre. I am prepared to give thee audience. Thou saidst, oh son, that I from thee should hear Matters of import high: at the same time Thou may'st, perchance, from my lips hear the same. HÃ¦m. A suppliant I approach thee: to confront The first and fierce emotions of thy rage I deem'd unwise: now that it somewhat yields To reason's influence, I come, though alone, The organ of the Theban multitude, Thee, to conjure, oh father, to use pity. Wilt thou refuse me this indulgence, father? Two pious ladies have infringed thy law; But who would not have broken such an edict? Cre. Who, but thyself, would dare to intercede For those who have defied it? HÃ¦m. Nor dost thou Deem in thy heart their sacred enterprise Worthy of death; ah no! I think thee not, Nor art thou, so unnatural and unjust. Cre. Thebes and my son may call me at their will Cruel, I am contented to be just. T'obey all laws, whate'er those laws may be, All are alike required. To Heaven alone Are kings accountable for what they do: And there is neither age, nor rank, nor sex, That palliates th'audacious turpitude Of incomplete obedience. To permit A few delinquents to remain unpunished Gives license to the many. HÃ¦m. Didst thou deem, When thou didst frame thy law, that two such ladies Should be the first its penance to defy? A wife, a sister, emulously both Rising above their sex? ... Cre. Hear me, oh son; From thee I ought not any thing to hide. Or thou know'st not, or thou will'st not to know, Or thou pretendest not to fathom them; I therefore wish to explain my schemes to thee. I thought, I hoped, ... what do I say? ... by force I would constrain Antigone alone To be the first in Thebes to break my law; At last I have obtain'd my heart's desire; Antigone has fallen in the snare; The useless law may now be abrogated ... HÃ¦m. Oh earth! oh heavens! and do I call thee father? Cre. Ungrateful son; ... or dull of apprehension, For such my love would fain account thee yet: I am thy father: if thou hold me guilty, I am so for thy sake. HÃ¦m. I clearly see The execrable means by which thou hopest My fortunes to advance. Disastrous throne! Thou never shalt be mine, if, by such means, Thou art to be obtain'd. Cre. I fill that throne, That throne is mine which thou rejectest thus. If to a father, as becomes a son, Thou canst not speak, speak to him as thy king. HÃ¦m. Unhappy son! ... my father; ... pardon; ... hear; ... Thou wilt not reap the fruit of such a scheme, And wilt degrade thy name. Absolute power, E'en in the king most absolute, avails not To drown the cry of universal nature. All feel compassion for the pious virgin: Thy scheme will be discover'd by the Thebans; Discover'd and abhorr'd, perhaps not suffer'd. Cre. And darest thou welcome first the impious doubt, The doubt by all men hitherto unspoken, Whether or not my will should be obeyed? Save from my will, my arbitrary power Disdains to hear of limit or controul. Thou hast not taught me how to wield the sceptre. I soon shall make in every Theban heart All passions dumb, except the one of fear. HÃ¦m. My intercessions, then, are unavailing? My fond reliance that thou wouldst relent? Cre. Utterly vain. HÃ¦m. The progeny of kings, Two ladies, then, to opprobrious death are doom'd, Since, at their hands, due rites of sepulture A brother, and a husband, has received? Cre. One is thus doom'd.âLittle the other's fate Imports; as yet I know it not. HÃ¦m. Me then, Me then with her shalt thou consign to death. Hear, father, hear; I love Antigone; Long have I loved her; loved her more than life: And ere thou tear'st Antigone from me, Thou wilt be forced to take away my life. Cre. Ungrateful son! Thus dost thou love thy father? HÃ¦m. I swear I love thee, e'en as I love her. Cre. Vexatious hindrance! In thy father's heart Thou hast infix'd an unexpected wound, A mortal wound. Fatal will be thy love To my repose, to thine, and to the fame And glory of us both! The world holds not Aught precious in my sight compared to thee ... Too much I love thee, herein lies my crime ... Is this thy recompense for such affection? Thou lovest her, entreatest for her safety, Who mocks my power, who holds me in contempt, And dares to tell me so; and in her breast Conceals ambitious wishes for the throne? This throne, the source of my solicitude, Because thou may'st one day inherit it. HÃ¦m. Thou art mistaken: in her pious breast, I swear, there lives not one ambitious thought: No other thoughts are rooted in thy nature. Hence thou know'st not, nor canst thou ever know, The mighty power of love, before whose throne All projects of advancement prostrate fall. Thou didst not always deem Antigone Thy enemy, yet have I always loved her: To change, with change of circumstance, my love, Was more than human nature could perform. I could be silent, and I held my peace. Nor, hadst thou not constrain'd me, should I now, Oh father, have reveal'd my secret fondness. Oh, heavens! must she her virgin neck lay down To the impious axe? ... and must I suffer it? Must I behold it? Couldst thou contemplate With a less haughty and less clouded eye, Her noble heart, her elevated thoughts, Her qualities, as rare as they are sublime, Thou, even as thy son, yea, more than he, At once wouldst reverence and admire her virtues. Who dared, beneath the cruel government Of fierce Eteocles, appear the friend Of Polinices? She alone dared do it. In whom, except in her, did her blind father, By all deserted, find a pitying friend? Lastly, Jocasta, then held dear by thee, By birth thy sister, to her grief immense, Afflicted mother, say, what other source Of comfort had she left? In all her tears What solace, what companion, did she find? What daughter had she but Antigone? Thou say'st she is the child of Ådipus; But for a crime, in which she bore no part, Her virtues make a plenary atonement. Again I say, the throne is not her object: Never, oh never, hope to see me happy At her expense: gods, were she so at mine! I would not only give the throne of Thebes, But that of all the world to make her so. Cre. Does she return thy love with equal love? HÃ¦m. There is no love that can compare with mine. She loves me not; nor can she ever love me: If she detest me not, it is enough To satisfy my heart; I hope no more: T'expect more from her heart, who ought to hate me, Would be unreasonable. Cre. But tell me further, Would she consent to give to thee her hand? HÃ¦m. A royal virgin, from whom has been torn, And torn by impious violence, her brothers, Her mother, and her father, shall she give Her hand in marriage? give it too to me, Sprung from a blood that's fatal to her race? Could I be so presumptuous? Creon's son, Could I dare offer her my hand? ... Cre. Thou may'st, That hand at once restores her life and throne. HÃ¦m. Too well I know her, and too much I love her: Foster'd in weeping, more than ever now She spends her life in tears. Perhaps hereafter She may see days less tragical than these, And may be less averse to listen to me; Thou mayest then ... Cre. Thou vainly dost expect That I should put our destiny in wardship To time, and its precarious events.â Guards, quickly be Antigone brought forth Into my presence.âShe deserves to die; I may, with justice, sentence her to death; And, perhaps, 'twould be in me a proof of wisdom, With summary rigour, to inflict that sentence. But yet, my son, thou art so dear to me, That, for thy sake alone, I will consent To grant her life, to accept her as my daughter, If she consent to yield to thee her hand. And can she hesitate to make a choice Betwixt a scaffold and a monarch's son? HÃ¦m. Hesitate? no! She will chuse instant death. Cre. She hates thee then. HÃ¦m. She loves the dead too well. Cre. I understand thee. Thou desirest, son, That I should life preserve in her, who would, If she had power, take life from me and mine. Canst thou presume to expect, or ask, so much Of a fond father who so much loves thee? SCENE THE SECOND. Antigone, Creon, HÃ¦mon, Guards. Cre. Approach: thou findest me, Antigone, Much more disposed to indulgence than before. Not that I deem thy enterprise less guilty, Or the annexed infliction less thy due. Paternal love, more than the love of justice, Hath wrought this change. My son, most fervently, Hath asked for thee my pardon, and obtain'd it, Provided that thou pledge thyself ... Ant. To what? Cre. To give him, in my sight, without delay, A recompense he well deserves ... thy hand. HÃ¦m. Pardon, Antigone, I never asked So great a blessing: he would give thee to me: I wish alone to rescue thee from death. Cre. On this condition thou obtain'st my pardon. Ant. Does Creon offer kindness? Ah! to me What kindness can he shew so great as death? Death can alone eternally remove me From thy detested sight: thou makest happy Those whom thou thus dost banish from thy presence. HÃ¦mon, obtain my death; 'twill be a pledge, The only one I can accept, of love. Ah! recollect, oh HÃ¦mon, that it is The richest gift a tyrant can bestow; Which often he denies to those whose hearts Possess a real, ardent wish for it. Cre. Wilt thou not alter thy deportment towards me? Thou art always proud, always implacable, Whether thou art condemned, or art absolved. Ant. Change my deportment? ... 'twere more possible For thee to change thy heart. HÃ¦m. This is my father: If thou, Antigone, wilt thus address him, Thou piercest my sad heart. Ant. He is thy father; Hence all the worth he has; nor do I find Any defect, oh HÃ¦mon, in thy nature, But that thou art his son. Cre. Peace;âClemency In me was transient as the lightning's flash; Already thou art superfluously guilty; Nor is it now, or needful, or expedient, The guilt of thy vituperative tongue. Ant. The throne, incontrovertibly my right, Which thou usurpest, makes me too, too guilty. That throne I do not ask of thee, nor life. The day on which thou took'st my father from me I should have asked of thee the gift of death, Or, with my own hands, on myself bestow'd it, But there remain'd a duty to perform, To give due sepulture to my dead brother. Now that I have that holy task accomplished, Nothing remains for me to do in Thebes: If thou dost wish my life, restore my father. Cre. I offer thee the throne; and, with that throne, A spouse thou hatest not; who loves thee more, Antigone, than thou abhorrest me; Who loves thee more, far more, than his own father. Ant. HÃ¦mon, and he alone, if not more dear, Perchance might make my life more bearable. But what a life 'twould be? a life dragg'd on Where thou wert present? while I still must hear, Hear from Avernus, th'unavenged shades Of my dead brothers, whom thou didst betray, And goad to murder, cry to me for vengeance? Can I, a wife, hear this, and tranquilly Repose in the embraces of the son Of the destroyer of my family? Cre. I comprehend thy meaning. The alliance Would doubtless be too chaste: if there had been Another son of Ådipus, 'twere he Thou wouldst deem worthy thy illustrious hand. Ant. Daughter of Ådipus, ah, horrid name! Daughter of Creon only still more horrid! HÃ¦m. My hope, I see, is too presumptuous! Blood can alone appease your bitter hate: Chuse then my blood: spill mine. Antigone, Thy stern refusal does become thee well: Father, in thee, anger is also just: I love you both, both equally I love; Myself alone I hate. Wouldst thou, oh Creon, sentence her to death, Permit that she deserve it at thy hands, By murdering thy son. Antigone, Thou wishest on my sire to wreak thy vengeance? Strike; in this breast thou wilt obtain it fully: In me, his only, his beloved son, Thou takest from him: childless thou wilt make him, Than Ådipus more wretched. Why delay? Strike; by insulting thus my father, thou Dost much more wound than if thou stabb'd my breast. Cre. Do not yet utterly despair; her words Bespeak less grief than anger. Lady, yield To reason: in thy hands alone is placed Thy destiny; on thee alone depends Argia, whom thou lov'st so much, for whom, Far more than for thyself, thou art afflicted: Of HÃ¦mon, whom thou dost not hate, thou art The arbitress; ... of me thou also art; Whom, if thou dost abhor beyond all duty, No less thou oughtest to confess, that I, Beyond all duty, am to thee indulgent. This day, that now is ushering in its light, I yield to thee for thy mature reflection: At sun-set, death or HÃ¦mon thou must chuse. SCENE THE THIRD. Antigone, HÃ¦mon, Guards. Ant. Ah! why wert thou the son of Creon born? Or why, at least, didst not resemble him? HÃ¦m. Ah, hear me.âOn this instant, which I feel To be the last of real life to me, I fain would speak to thee my inmost thoughts. Erewhile this confidence was interdicted By the importunate aspect of my father. Then know, for my excuse, that I'm the first To praise, and to appreciate, and admire, Thy stern refusal, and thy sterner anger. Rather than dare to offer it to thee, By a slow fire I would consume this hand; This hand, which seems to me unworthy of thee, More than it seems to thee. Thou knowest well That I do love thee; and thou shalt know well That I esteem thee. But meanwhile, (ah, state Of anguish inexpressible!) my life Suffices not to place thy life in safety! ... Oh, that, at least, an inopprobrious death I could obtain for thee! ... Ant. A death in Thebes, Far more opprobrious than mine can be, Fell to my mother's and my brothers' lot. The axe to me seems almost like a triumph. HÃ¦m. What dost thou speak of? ... ah, atrocious sight! I will not see it: will not live to see it. But hear me, oh Antigone! Perhaps yet The king might be deluded ... I speak not, Thou wouldst not suffer me, nor would I do it, To recommend aught of thy fame unworthy. Ant. I brave, but I delude not, e'en a tyrant: And this thou knowest, HÃ¦mon. Piety, Fraternal piety, to artifice Alone could urge me. Shall I now deceive To save my life? rather would I deceive To accelerate my death. HÃ¦m. At least awhile, Awhile suspend it, though it be so fixed, Thy lofty and inexorable will. I ask for nothing that's of thee unworthy: But yet, if thou canst, only by delay Give comfort to another; if thou canst Live without infamy, why shouldst thou be So cruel to thyself, to me so cruel? Ant. HÃ¦mon, I cannot do it ... To myself I am not cruel: Of Ådipus I'm daughter. I grieve for thee; but yet ... HÃ¦m. I know it well: Motive to thee of life I ne'er can be; Yet thy companion certainly in death. But yet beyond the dreary waves of Styx All the dear objects of thy lofty heart Are not translated yet, Antigone: In a sad life, yet nevertheless in life, Ådipus and Argia still remain, And her poor little one, who now grows up The living image of thy Polinices; For whom, perchance, thou wouldst one day desire The passage to this throne, useless to thee, To be preserved. Ah! yield a little while. Thou ought'st to feign thou listenest to my prayers, And that thou wilt be mine, in case that Creon Allow an interval for time to lay On thy most reasonable and lingering grief, His slowly-working, yet emollient hand. I too will feign to be appeased with this; And will, at all events, obtain consent For some delay of Creon. We may hope, Meanwhile, for much, from the effects of time: I never can believe the Argive monarch Will, to the thrall of ignominious fetters, Abandon his own daughter. Oftentimes, Whence least he is looked for, the defender springs. Ah live; once more I do asseverate That for myself I ask it not: ah live! ... I am resolved to follow thee; and yet I feel no pity for my own allotment, Nor shouldst thou feel it for me: for thy blind And wandering father, for Argia, here An exile, I bespeak, conjure, thy pity. Thou may'st from chains release her, to behold Once more her father, and rejoice his heart. Ah! be constrain'd, what for thyself thou feel'st not, To feel for them, compassion! At thy feet Prostrate, and overwhelm'd with bitter tears, HÃ¦mon invokes thy pity ... he conjures it! Ant. And I conjure thee, now that I have need, More than I ever had, of constancy, Do not, in soft tears of effeminate love, Do not dissolve my heart ... if potent thus O'er my fond breast thou be'est, (and that thou art These rending conflicts but too well convince me;) ... Help me to save my fame; help me to die; If thou, in verity, dost love Antigone. HÃ¦m. ... Alas! ... yet I have not deluded thee ... 'Tis possible ... all that I've pictured to thee. Ant. I never can be thine; why should I live? Oh, Heaven! that I at least had never known The real cause of my despairing grief. And if I should, as spouse, unite myself To thee but in appearance, what would Greece, In hearing of it, say? My wretched father, He who alone for my protracted life Would be a worthy cause, if ever he Of such an union heard! ... In case that grief, Torment, and shame, have not destroy'd him yet, To his paternal heart the horrid news Would be a mortal stab. Ah, wretched father! I know too well I ne'er shall see thee more; No, never more; ... but lonely, and the last Of all thy children, I will die unspotted. HÃ¦m. My heart thou rendest; ... yet I feel constrain'd Such a resolve to venerate: for I, E'en I, to virtue am not quite a stranger ... But shall I let thee perish? ... Deign to hear, If thou detest me not, my latest prayer: At thy side will I plant myself; the blow, The mortal blow, my bosom shall transfix, Before it reaches thine: on cruel Creon, Thou, thus, in part at least, may'st be avenged. Ant. Live, HÃ¦mon, I command thee ... Love in us Is such a crime, that I, by death, atone for't; Do thou by life. HÃ¦m. One, one more, last attempt. Inhuman father! sanguinary king, Thou of a frantic and despairing son Shalt be constrain'd to hear the latest accents. Ant. Alas! what is it that thou now contrivest? A rebel to thy father? ... Ah, avoid So horrible a stain, or do not hope That I can love thee. HÃ¦m. From thy fierce resolve Can nothing make thee swerve? Ant. Nothing; if thou Canst not. HÃ¦m. Thou, then, preparest thyself? ... Ant. Ah, never, ... Never to see thee more. HÃ¦m. In a short time Thou shalt, I swear, again behold my face. Ant. Ah stop. Alas! ... dost thou not hear me, HÃ¦mon? What wouldst thou do? HÃ¦m. Spite of thyself, preserve thee. Ant. Stop ... SCENE THE FOURTH. Antigone, Guards. Ant. Heavens! he hears me not.âNow quickly, guards, Again conduct me into Creon's presence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Creon, Antigone, Guards. Cre. Hast chosen? Ant. I have chosen. Cre. HÃ¦mon? Ant. Death. Cre. Death thou shalt have.âBut take especial heed, That when the axe is lifted o'er thy head Thou dost not flinch: the time for penitence Will then be past. Ill, perhaps, thou wilt sustain The aspect fierce of death when it approaches; Ill, if thou love her, perhaps, thou wilt sustain Argia's tears; she, by thy side, is doomed To breathe her last; and thou art cause alone Of her untimely end. Ah! think of it; Thou still hast time ... I yet exhort thee to it. Now, what is thy reply? ... Thou speakest not? Intrepidly and steadily thou lookest? ... Yes, haughty virgin, thou shalt have from me That which thy contumelious silence asks. I now regret that I allow'd thee choice Betwixt my own dishonour and thy death. Ant. Why dost thou now delay? Act and be silent. Cre. Make a parade of courage at thy will: We soon shall see how far that courage goes. Although the appointed moment of thy death Be not arrived, to gratify thy wish It shall be hastened. Go, Eurymedon; Quickly conduct her to the ready scaffold. SCENE THE SECOND. HÃ¦mon, Antigone, Creon, Guards. HÃ¦m. Stop ... To the scaffold? ... Ant. Now, now, guards, make haste ... Oh, misadventurous sight! drag me to death. Leave me, oh HÃ¦mon, leave me! ... now, farewell. HÃ¦m. Dare none of you to drag her one step farther! Cre. Rash youth! Dost menace in thy father's presence? HÃ¦m. Thus dost thou love me, father? Thus cut short The day thou granted'st to her? Cre. 'Tis her will Thus to precipitate her destiny; Can I refuse compliance? HÃ¦m. Hear, oh hear; Dost thou not know then? Thou art menaced now With other and most unexpected troubles. It is reported that the King of Athens, Theseus, that valiant hero, comes to Thebes With armed multitudes. O'erwhelmed in tears, And claiming reparation at his hands, To him the desolate Argive widows went. The king attended to their just complaints, And pledged himself to gain for them the urns Of their dead husbands; and thou knowest well That Theseus is no empty promiser. Propitiate his retributory wrath, And our disgrace prevent. I ask thee not Basely to quail at contumelious menace, But that thou shouldst feel pity for thy Thebes; Scarce do the glad notes of returning peace Freshen the morning gales; though, for thy sake, In an unrighteous cause I took up arms; What men of prowess now remain in Thebes? There lie the valiant in the battailous field, Valiant no more; there, on th'ensanguined bed, Pale and exanimate ... Cre. To abject fear Dost deem it possible for me to yield? Say, to what purpose, then, dost thou thus dwell On distant, dubious, perhaps unfounded, dangers? Theseus, that valiant hero, at my hands Has not demanded yet the Argive urns; Nor have I yet refused them to his threats: Perhaps ere he seeks to treat with me for Argos, I may anticipate his mediation. Art thou contented? Thebes is yet secure; I have no wish for war. At last permit That to her destiny this virgin go. HÃ¦m. Wilt thou then thus for ever lose thy son? ... In vain thou hopest that a single day I should survive her. Perhaps to lose thy son Is but a trifle; but by this one deed Thou rushest on a thousand various perils. Antigone is now absolved; thyself Absolved'st her when thou didst abrogate Thy unjust law. All now are well aware That thou contrived'st for her sake alone The abominable snare. Shall Thebes behold The honour'd daughter of her kings expire Upon an infamous and bloody scaffold? Ah, flatter not thyself that thou dost reign O'er subjects so degraded. Loud laments, Desperate menaces, and clank of arms, Are heard already; even now they doubt ... Cre. Enough; enough. Since thou dost will it not, Thebes shall not see upon a bloody scaffold The honour'd daughter of their kings expire. Soldiers, soon as the shades of night descend Ye shall conduct her to the plain, where lie Th'unburied heroes. 'Tis no longer lawful To refuse sepulture to any one: The heroic Theseus prohibits this: Let her then have it on the field of battle; The interment which on others she bestow'd: Yes, there alive be buried! ... HÃ¦m. What do I hear? Dost thou dare thus defy both gods and men? Ere thou canst put thy threat in execution, Thou from the veins of thy indignant son Must drain each drop of blood. Buried alive? Ah impious! ... sooner on this very spot Shall I be slain; reduced to dust and ashes ... Ant. Ah, HÃ¦mon, wilt thou make thyself unworthy Of my affection? Whatsoe'er he be He is thy father. Even from my birth My fate has doomed me to a violent death. If it be so, what signifies the place, The time, the manner of my death? Cre. In vain Thou wouldst oppose; thou canst not rescue her; Nor benefit thyself ... A wretched father Thou wilt make me; nought else canst thou perform. HÃ¦m. To make thee wretched gratifies my soul; Thou dost deserve it; and thou wilt be so. The impious throne allures thee to defy All the most sacred duties of a king, Of father, and of man: but the more firm Thou deem'st that throne, the more it shakes beneath Thy sacrilegious and usurping weight. ... The Thebans 'twixt the father and the son Clearly distinguish ... and there lives, I warn thee, Who, with a nod, could snatch from thee at once Thy throne so fraudulently gotten: reign: I will not give the signal; but, if harm Befall this virgin, tremble ... Ant. I beseech thee, Creon, ah quickly, execute thy sentence! Oh fatal power of adverse destiny! To my so many unexampled woes, And to my guilty birth, there wanted nought But that I should be 'twixt a son and father The instigator of atrocious rage. HÃ¦m. Listen to me, to me alone, oh Creon: Since swords of Athens, and its valiant king, The prayers of females, or the loud lament Of frantic multitudes, appal thee not; Now on thy hard heart may the cry descend, The terrible cry, of a despairing son; From whom thou hast by mad ambition torn All power of self-controul; to whom, alas! It had been better hadst thou ne'er given life; And who, on this tremendous day, may make thee Repent of such a gift. Cre. No human cry Suffices to impose a law on Creon. HÃ¦m. There is a human sword that may suffice To snap those laws at once. Cre. And 'tis? ... HÃ¦m. My sword. Cre. Perfidious traitor! Plot thy father's death; Cut short my days at once! ah, dare to do it! ... Seize on the kingdom; trouble its repose; Thy father still I am, though thou forget, And almost seem to scorn, to be my son. I know not how, nor can I, punish thee: I have no power, except to love thee still, And thy degenerate spirit to lament. Say what of difficult do I atchieve That is not for thy 'vantage? but ingrate, And deaf, alas! too much so, thou dost dare Prefer a love both indiscreet and foolish, A love not well received, to lofty thoughts Of policy, to sacred rights of blood. HÃ¦m. Say, of what rights of blood darest thou to speak? Thou art throughout a king: thou canst not love Thy son: thou only seekest a support To tyranny. Should I, who sprung from thee, Feel reverentially for ties of blood? Thou art my law, my sole preceptor thou, In cruelty; I follow thee: the goal Which thou hast shewn to me I first will reach; I swear I will. What lofty policy, I pray thee, prompts the open turpitude Which thou designest? Take thou heed, lest I Should, in like manner, as thou provest it, Return thy love ... That love engenders crimes; From it a thousand trespasses result, Augmenting gloriously; and this thou knowest. Ant. E'en now I hate thee, if thou dost proceed. Thou wert the son of Creon long before Thou wert my lover; strong, infrangible, Of all ties holiest, is the tie of son. Think, HÃ¦mon, ah, I do conjure thee, think, That to this very tie I fall a victim ... That I do love thee, Heaven itself bears witness: Yet I refuse thy hand not to offend The shades, yet unappeased, of the departed. Death I prefer, a shameful death I chuse, That tidings insupportable to him, Of me, my wretched father may not hear. Then be not thou refractory; but live The obsequious son of a flagitious father. Cre. His fury irritates my bosom less Than thy compassion. Take her from my sight. Go, go ... ah, wert thou once but fairly gone! Thy presence from the path of rectitude Alone seduces HÃ¦mon. At the hour, Which I already have assign'd to thee, Eurymedon, conduct her to the plain; And there, at once, give her both death and burial. SCENE THE THIRD. Creon, HÃ¦mon, Guards. HÃ¦m. Before the hour assign'd, thou from the camp Tidings shalt hear of me. Cre. Or ere that time HÃ¦mon will see his error, and repent it. I might anticipate and thus defeat Thy idle menaces: but I will give thee A more convincing proof of my affection, By trusting to thy elevated heart, Thy early virtues, which I fain would think Are in thee, but suspended, not destroy'd. HÃ¦m. Yes; I protest that what I shall perform Shall not disgrace the virtues of my youth. SCENE THE FOURTH. Creon, Guards. Cre. I know his temper well: his sense of honour, More than aught else, can curb its vehemence: My seeming confidence will much enthral The workings of his rage ... yet perhaps to-day, Intoxicated as he is with love, He may resort to force? ... But 'twill be easy For me to watch, deceive, defeat, his steps: When once Antigone has fallen my victim, All will be easy ... Theseus to appease ... To impose obedience on the multitude ... Regain my son; all this will be as nothing. But of Argia how shall I dispose? Guards, bring Argia instantly before me. Her death no longer can promote my schemes; And 'tis my interest now to pacify, While yet I may, the anger of Adrastes: I have too many enemies already. I will restore her to her sire in Argos: This restoration, as 'tis unexpected, Will yield him more delight; and thus the stain Of cruelty, imputed to my nature, Will not be inconsiderably lessened. SCENE THE FIFTH. Creon, Argia, Guards. Cre. Argia, listen to me. Grief sincere, Love of thy husband, and fond piety, Conducted thee to Thebes, where thou alone Hadst never dared to brave my prohibition. Ar. Thou art mistaken; I alone ... Cre. Well ... well ... Thou hadst defied it then, impell'd by pity; Not from contempt, and as in proud defiance Of my authority; not to excite Clamorous disturbances: I can discern Pity and love from factious disobedience, Cloaking its close designs with better motives. I am not cruel as thou mayest account me; And, as a proof of this, accept thy freedom. The shades of night protected thy approach; When the sun sets the shades of night once more Shall reconduct thee to thy sire in Argos. Ar. Eternal farewell I have bidden to Argos: The last remains of murdered Polinices Are laid in Thebes; in Thebes, or dead or living, I therefore will remain. Cre. Dost thou not wish To see once more thy child, thy sire, thy country? Ar. I never can desert the sacred ashes Of my beloved spouse. Cre. In this, thy wish I likewise will indulge: thou cam'st by stealth His ashes to obtain; openly keep them, And bear the precious burthen back to Argos. Depart; and there erect, among thy kindred, A tomb expressive of thy deep regret, To thy beloved spouse. Ar. And is it true? Whence can such clemency arise? And how Canst thou so differ from thy former self, And be sincere? Cre. Erewhile inflamed with rage Thou sawest me; but rage in me is transient; Reason and time abate it. Ar. May kind Heaven Grant thee a reign both long and prosperous! Thou then art won to clemency? What joy Thy people and thy son will thence derive! Thou hast at last felt pity for our fate; Thou also ceasest, with the name of guilt, To stigmatise compassion in ourselves; And the offence to which thou forced'st us Thou pardonest in us ... Cre. I pardon thee. Ar. Is not Antigone then safe? Cre. I do not Confound thy fault with her's. Ar. What do I hear? She groans in fetters yet? ... Cre. Question no farther ... Prepare for thy departure. Ar. Shall I go, And leave in peril my beloved sister? Vainly thou hopest it. Thy pardon pleased me Because I thought she bore in it a part; But she is fetter'd yet? Fierce punishments Perhaps yet await her? I will then be fetter'd; And I will suffer punishments more fierce ... Cre. In Thebes, I will; not others; to that will Of mine all yield. Thou hast infringed my law; And yet I pardon thee: thou wouldst construct Thy husband's funeral pile; this thou hast done: Bear back his ashes to thy native Argos; I yield those ashes to thee. What more wouldst thou? What more darest thou to ask? Dost thou expect That I should be accountable to thee? ... Ar. At least permit me to obtain the favour Of seeing her once more. Cre. Thou would'st, perchance, Gain from her intercourse a hardihood Which, in thyself, thou feel'st not? When light thickens I shall expect thee to depart from Thebes: If thou wilt not go of thine own accord, By force thou goest hence. Ar. Than any death Thy pardon is more cruel: death, which to all Thou givest, why to me alone deny it? 'Tis not that thou art withheld by any fear Of spilling blood. I am less innocent Than is Antigone, why should not I Incur an equal portion of thy fury? ... Cre. Deem it or clemency or punishment Thy going hence; it gives me little pain; Provided that clear quittance is obtained.â Guards, to your keeping I entrust her person: At night-fall to the OmolÃ¦an gate Descend, and bear her to the Argive boundaries: If she refuse to go, drag her by force. In the meantime replace her in the prison. Ar. Hear me ... have pity ... Cre. Hence: depart. SCENE THE SIXTH. Creon. Cre. Must I To my commands, whether they're kind or cruel, Find all rebellious?âAll at last shall yield.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Antigone, among Guards. Ant. Let us make better speed; so slow a step Ill becomes her, who has, at length, just reach'd The goal so long desired ... Perhaps ye, oh guards, May feel compassion for my fate? ... Proceed. Oh terrible death, I look thee in the face, And yet I tremble not. Not for myself, But for Argia, am I troubled thus: Guards! is her fate to any of you known? Speak, if ye aught can tell? ye all are silent? Argia! for thy sake alone I weep ... SCENE THE SECOND. Antigone, Argia, among Guards. Ar. I am then driven from Thebes? ... 'Tis true, I bear, Beginning and the end of all my hopes, This urn with me; ... but not one last farewell To my beloved companion! ... Ant. Ah! what voice, What sobbing voice is that I hear? Ar. Oh heavens! Who do I see? Ant. Argia? Ar. Dearest sister ... How fortunate this meeting! But, alas! Thy hands with chains are laden? ... Ant. Tell me quickly! ... Where art thou thus by force compelled to go? Ar. To Argos, to my sire. Ant. I breathe again! Ar. Creon esteems me of so little worth, That he repeals my sentence: but, alas! ... Ant. Guards, if ye ever knew a shade of pity, To our last interview do not refuse A few brief moments. Come to me, my sister; Why cannot I to this sad bosom clasp thee? But bound with impious and galling chains I have no power ... yet clasp me to thy bosom. But what do I behold? What precious burthen Dost thou, with such a fond anxiety, Fold to thy breast? An urn? It is ... oh heaven! The ashes of my brother, fatal pledge, Fatal, and yet inestimably dear; ... Ah, press this sacred relic to my lips. And is it granted to me, ere I die, With my warm tears to bathe thee? ... oh, my brother, 'Tis more than e'er I hoped; ... these tears, the last That I shall ever shed, are well bestow'd. This, oh Argia, is a precious gift: Creon, in granting this, was most indulgent: Thou should'st be satisfied. Return to Argos; Quickly return: to thy despairing father Carry this urn ... Live; for thy son's sake, live; And o'er this urn to weep; and ... mid ... thy ... tears Remember still Antigone ... Ar. My heart Thou rendest ... scarcely can I speak from weeping: But shall I live while thou art doom'd to death? Ant. Yes; to a death most horrible I go. The plain, on which we piously perform'd Last night our sacred rites, is destined now To be my place of burial; Creon wills That, on that plain, I should be buried living. Ar. Oh impious! Ant. Because he fears the people, He has deferr'd till night to execute Th'atrocious sentence. Ah, restrain thy tears: Leave me; depart; thus will, at last, in me The race of Ådipus be quite extinguish'd. This I regret not; may my lingering death Suffice to expiate the dreadful crimes, So oft repeated, of my family. Ar. Ah! I will share with thee thy punishment; Thy courage strengthens mine; thy pangs, in part, May perhaps be thus diminished. Ant. What sayest thou? Rather will they be thus a thousand times More exquisite! Ar. Together, if we die, We may, at least, invoke the sacred name Of Polinices; may exhort each other, Lastly we may shed tears ... Ant. Be silent thou ... Do not, I pray thee, make me weep again ... To the last test my constancy is brought. My tears I cannot check unless thou'rt silent ... Ar. Alas! then cannot I, or rescue thee, Or die with thee? Ant. Rather resolve to live. Thou'rt not the child of Ådipus; thy heart Is not like mine, with guilty love consumed; Of the betrayer, and the murderer, Of all thy race, thou lovest not the son. Here is my crime; I ought alone t'atone for it. HÃ¦mon, ah still my heart, in all its force, The passion feels which thou hast planted there, Feels all the grief to which I leave thee victim. But let me to my doom. Sister, farewell! SCENE THE THIRD. Creon, Antigone, Argia, Guards. Cre. Why do ye thus delay? Has she not yet Reach'd the appointed place of punishment? What do I see? Argia? And with her? ... Who could unite them? Which of you betray'd me? Ant. Thy satellites, less harden'd than thyself, To me have granted a few transient moments. By chance we met each other: to my death I go without delay; ah, be appeased! Thou hast perform'd a just and pious deed In granting thus Argia's safe return. Ar. Creon, unite my destiny to hers ... Ant. Ah fly, ah fly; lest he should cease to pity. Cre. First to her destination drag Argia ... Ar. Ah cruel! will ye tear me thus by force? Ant. Give me the last embrace. Cre. Tear them by force; Tear them asunder; wrest them from each other: Quickly obey, it is my will. Ar. Oh heavens! I ne'er shall see thee more! Ant. Farewell ... for ever! SCENE THE FOURTH. Creon, Antigone, Guards. Cre. By the other gate conduct her to the plain ... But noâAgain immure her in the place From whence she came. Whispers in his ear.Ipseus, listen to me. SCENE THE FIFTH. Creon. Cre. Thus from the malcontents I have removed All cause of murmuring. I have well reflected: Nor should have changed my purpose but for this ... By this means all will be conciliated. The guilty factions of the people rise From an innate impatience of restraint; Yet oft they cloak themselves in feigned compassion, And evermore with danger is it fraught, The people's pity, whether true or feign'd; And now, so much the more, as now my son, By heading them, adds to their hardihood. 'Tis too, too true, that he who fills the throne Vainly believes, or rather feigns belief, To cheat his natural imbecility, That he can change, or modify at will, Human propensities, or that a king Gains with his crown a superhuman power. That power resides but in the subjects' will; He trembles at it, who makes others tremble. But an expert hand, and a subtle head, Suffer not others to forestall their schemes: One stroke lays low the idol of the people, Lays low their hope, their courage, and their strength, Not irresistible, because unknown.â But, ah! what noise is this I hear around me? What brandishing of swords do I behold? What do I see? With arm'd confederates HÃ¦mon encircled? ... and towards me advancing? Let him advance ... The moment is well chosen. SCENE THE SIXTH. Creon, HÃ¦mon, the Followers of HÃ¦mon. Cre. Son, what is thy intent? HÃ¦m. Call me not son! I have no father. Of a tyrant king I come to abrogate the impious laws: But for thyself thou hast no cause for fear; I do not come the avenger of thy crimes: That to the gods belongs: to rescue Thebes From the detested sight of further crimes My right-hand brandishes the naked sword. Cre. Against thy father, and against thy king, Thou, thou in arms? The people to seduce To civil tumult and rebellious discord, This, surely, is an unexampled means Of sparing further crimes ... ungrateful son, Blind and ungrateful son ... yet, in despite Of thy transgressions, to thy father dear! What dost thou seek? a sceptre premature? HÃ¦m. Reign and prolong thy days; nothing of thine Do I desire: but I demand, and challenge, And with these valiant followers, with this arm I shall know how to gain by force my own. Argia and Antigone I seek To rescue from thy hands ... Cre. What dost thou say? Oh, foolish and presumptuous hardihood! Dar'st thou to brandish thy perfidious sword, Against thy father brandish it, to unloose The chains of those whose chains are loosed already? Argia, from imprisonment released, Is, at this moment, journeying towards Argos; I send her as a present to her father: To this, thou seest, the terror of thy sword Did not erewhile compel me. HÃ¦m. But, ah say, What are the fortunes of Antigone? Cre. She from the horrors of her squalid prison Is also freed. HÃ¦m. Where is she? I would see her. Cre. Is this alone thy wish? HÃ¦m. On me alone That now depends: why should I now indeed Demand her at thy hands? I can, and will, (Although it is not mine) for a brief while, Give in this palace law. Brave warriors, Let us depart; from impious power set free A royal virgin, to whom aught is due In this her Thebes, rather than punishment. Cre. Thy warriors are useless; thou alone May'st for this task suffice: and who will dare Thy footsteps to oppose? Ah, enter there, Take with thee whom thou wilt: I humbly here, Among thy champions, thy despised father, Remain, till thou, her valiant avenger, Return and triumph. HÃ¦m. Thou in jest, perchance, Dost speak; I speak in earnest. Creon, see, See, if my deeds do not make good my words. Cre. Go. The scene opens, and discovers the dead body of Antigone. Thou sufficest not to humble Creon. HÃ¦m. What do I see? ... oh heavens! ... Antigone ... Infamous tyrant ... dost thou smite me thus? Cre. 'Tis thus I humble pride: thus to my laws Enforce obedience; thus reform my son. HÃ¦m. Reform me? Ah, I am too much thy son! Ah, were I not so! in thy bosom He springs towards his father with his drawn sword, but on a sudden stops, and, turning it, plunges it into his own bosom. thus.â I die ... I die ... Cre. My son, what hast thou done? HÃ¦m. Dost thou inopportunely pity me? ... Carry elsewhere thy pity ... come not near me ... Do not exasperate my dying pangs ... Thus do I yield to thee the blood, 'twere better Thou ne'er had'st given to me. Cre. Son, rash son! ... I call the gods to witness, I ne'er thought That an ungovernable passion thus Would arm thee 'gainst thyself ... HÃ¦m. Fly; ... quit my sight. And force me not, with my last gasp, to curse thee With horrid imprecations of despair. I was ... to thee a son ... Thou never wert, Never ... to me ... a father. Cre. Oh, my son! HÃ¦m. I leave thee to remorse and bitter anguish. My friends, my friends, as a last act of kindness, Drag my expiring body to the spot Where lies Antigone. It is my wish That thence my struggling spirit take from earth Its latest flight ... Cre. Oh son ... too well beloved! And must I yield thee thus? for ever thus Remain a childless wretch? ... HÃ¦m. Creon, once more, Or in my bosom plunge the fatal weapon ... Or let me to the side of her ... I love ... Be dragg'd ... and ... there ... expire. He is slowly supported by his friends towards the body of Antigone. Cre. Oh son! ... oh blow, Fatal and unexpected. He covers his face, and remains immoveable, until HÃ¦mon is almost out of the sight of the spectators. SCENE THE SEVENTH. Creon. Cre. Thus, thou first Tremendous retribution of the skies, For blood unjustly spill'd, art thou accomplish'd! ... I see thee arm'd with terrors: ... and I tremble.</field>
