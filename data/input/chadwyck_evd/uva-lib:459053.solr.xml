      <field name="fulltext">The ScÃ¦ne Savoy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 1. ScÃ¦na 1. A Retreate being sounded as from far, Enter Vasco, Altesto, Frivolo. Vasco. Heark boyes? they sound us a retreat? this skirmish (sirs) Was no rare pastime to continue at; 'Tis saffer wrastling in a bed; give me Hence-forth your white fac'd foe, a plumpe faire enemie That weares her head peece lac'd; I'm for a cambrick helmet, I. Altesto. And yet these mighty men of Millain got But little by the sport; some of them shall Vouchsafe to weare a single arme heareafter, Two wodden leggs too, and limpe their dayes out In an Hospitall. Frivolo. How? an Hospitall? Vasco. A rode, a rode; your highway sir is now Your onely walke of state for your maim'd soldier. Your Hospitalls and pensions are reserv'd For your maim'd Mercer, decay'd sonnes o'th shop, That have been often crackd not in their crownes Like us, but in their credit sir. Frivolo. And placket squires, that have bin long diseas'd In their Lords service; a score of duckets Shall bribe them into place, where they may sleep, And eate, and pray too, but with breath so much Vnholsome, th'ayre can hardly purify't And make it fit to reach neare heaven! Altesto. Well, the surprize o'th cittadell, wherein The Duke had plac'd his daughter, with the Ladies Of her traine, and treasure too, was a service Of most rare work. Vasco. Just when they sally'd out To cut our Rere in peeces, then steale in By Ambush wisely layd, and make them all Our prize, was miracle. Frivolo. They say his daughter scap'd, and fled, with her As her best guard, one they call Leonell Enter Tristan. Whom our Count Prospero pursu'd. Vas. Tristan? Welcome; is all our pillage waggond Shall it to night see Turin? Tristan. Alls safe my lusty leader, our horse too Have sounded a retreat, and the foe sneake He walkes with's hands in's pockets like a skipper In a frost. Vas. Well, let me reckon my estate; First a widdow prisoner. Altesto. Mine's a maide prisoner, Young my Uasco, she's yet in her first blush And I've dispatch'd her unto Turin too My Mothers house, thy prisoner in her company, They are acquainted. Uasco. You have the luck; these bald chinnes are as familiar With their good starrs, as with spur-rowells, Play with them, and turn 'em which way they please; I fought as well as he; and yet (forsooth) His prisoner must be faire, and young, &amp; mine So old she might have given Hercules suck, Now she sucks too, for she hath no teeth left, In one moneth she'l cost me as much in cawdles And sweet candy, as her ransome comes too. Fri. But you have other pillage Captaine. Vas. Let me see, 3 Barbarie horses with rich Caparisons, 2 Chests o'th Generalls cloths. Alt. And I 2 chests o'th Generalls plate. Friv. In those I share Altesto. Uasco. How? plate? shall we incounter our sowc'd fish And broyld Pullen in silver service rogues? Like furr'd Magnificoes? Frivolo. We shall Captaine, but you may dip your morsell in good china earth. Altest. All your plate Uasco, is the silver handle Of your old prisoners franne. Enter Prospero (wounded) and Evandra (her armes in a scarfe Piniond.) Trist. Here comes Prospero the valiant Count. Uas. And with him the brave prize. Pros. Evandra do not mourne, I that have made You captive thus with hazard of my youth And blood, shall think you now as worthy of My care, as of my volour in the fight; Can I esteeme you lesse by being mine? Evand. What have I done (unknown unto my heart) That I should tempt your valour to so great A sin as my captivity? or are my crimes Observ'd more than my prayers, that heaven shall leave Me to be come the scorne of victorie? Pros. It is the sad preheminence of your Exemplar birth and beauty, to conferr. Honour on him that is your conqueror. Evan. Honour? is that the word that hath so long Betrayd the Emulous world, and scold the noblest race Of men, into a vex'd, and angry death? If 'twere a vertue 'twould not strive t'inthrall, And thus distresse the innocent. Pros. I am the warrs disciple, and since first I had the growth to weare a sword, I nere Was taught how to subdue by reason but By strength. Altesto? Altesto. My Lord. Pros. Take here this Lady to your charge, conduct Her unto Turin, and there guard her in My house till my approach. Altesto. I shall my Lord. Pros. Let her be safe Altesto in thy care On forfeiture of life, she is my prisoner And th'noblest in the field, the beautious Heire of Millaine; had not my niggard stars Intended me but halfe a courtesie, The Duke her Father had lamented now Under the same fate. Vasco. I could wish your Lordship would beleeve me A fitter man, to take charge of the Lady. Pros. VVhy Captaine? Vas. You could not commit her to an Eunuch VVith more safety; if the great Turke knew me (Honest Achmet) he would trust me in's Seraglio (By this hand) without defalking one graine beneath the waste. Pros. Successe hath made you wanton Cap. Uas. Besides (my Lord) I have tane an old Abesse Prisoner, o such a Governesse for a Young maid, sheel read to her such homilies, And teach her such receipts out of the Fathers, How to cure the toothach, preserve plumms, And boyle Amber possits, will make her sir In three dayes a very St. Pros. VVell you shall take my bounty too, close by The valley that doth joyne to th'neighbour grove Lyes conquerd by my sword a Millain knight, His wounds medcin'd, &amp; stopt by the best art I had, but by much losse of blood unable yet To move, him, and his ransome I bestow on you, Uas. I thank your Lordship Pros. But use him nobly Uasco, for he hath A courage that well merited his cause, And fought with eager and with skillfull, strength To free that lady from my bonds, but the glad day was mine. Vas. He shall be kindly us'd, Only your sweet lordship must give me leave When he pay's his ransom to weigh his gold, Were he my father sir, he must indure The tryall of my scales; follow Tristan. Pros. Make haste; see him well waggond, and provide A surgeon to attend his cure. Ex. Vas. Trist. Evan. Sir, can you find no pitty yet within Your breast? you have already shewn enough Of your sterne fathers spirit, is there not In all your heart so much of softnes as Declares you had a mother too, must I Be led a captive, and in a cruell land Lament your victorie? Pros. Altesto, beare her from my sight? make haste? I am not safe, when I converse with teares. Exeunt Altesto, Evandra. I would ambition were not brave in war? Or that the rage of Princes had not made It lawfull to subdue whom they dislike, Or 'twere ignoble to inflict a miserie, As to indur't our selves; Frivolo, where Didst thou leave the prince? Friv. In pursuit of the Duke, who since we heare Recoverd Millaine, which caus'd him sound us. (Drum march afar off. A retreat,âheark sir, his march leades hither; It is his way to Turin. Enter Calladine. The prince, the prince; my Lord Prospero You have been sought for, the valiant prince For this day's action hath advanc'd you to The publique eare, and we your friends rejoyc'd. Pros. I did but as his bold example gave Me fire; I saw him conquer, kill, and leade In fetters sad faces, which I nere saw Before, and I beleev'd 'twas good; I wish That heaven may thinke so too; I doe not converse VVith bookes; but I have heard our enemies (Although they wrong'd not me) must be so us'd. Enter Alvaro, Soldiers stripping off his Corslet. Vnbuckle Calladine, the day is hott, And our great businesse cooles like to their heares, That fled to humbled Millaine, &amp; have left Their fainting honour hovering over our crests, Leade on my horse in triumph; I will march On foot, he hath perform'd his worke, as he Had equall'd me in sence of what he did. Cal. Sir, Prospero the Count, whom your kind feares (Pros. kneeles kisses his hand So heartily inquir'd for i'th retreat Alva. Rise noble youth, and let me hold thee neere My heart, joyne thy stout brest to mine that we May grow a while together in our love, Yet when divided, be the same in thought And acts this day thou hast begot an historie, And given our Savoy Chronicles a theame To teach them boast, and be beleev'd. Pros. Alvaro? my dread Prince, why should you lose Your prayse on me, that did but imitate The faintest of your vigour, and your skill? You bred mee from my childhood to doe things That they call glorious, though (dull and much unlearnd) I cannot reach the cause of what I doe, More than your example, and command. Alva. Since thou gett'st strength to weare a sword, thou hast Been mine, and t'hath been drawn to execute My will, and though (I know not why) thou wast Averse to arts, and written labours of The wise, yet discipline of warre thou lov'dst And bring thee to a fiery steed, him thou VVouldst sit, and mannage with such gentle rule That our Idolatrous Philosophers Beleev'd thou hadst created, whom thou I taught'st. Pros. Your love will breed me envy sir; something I've done (since you are pleas'd to vallew so My weaker toyles) which may perhaps deserve Your fathers thanks, and yours, and's yet unknown Vnto you both, Evandra, heir of Millaine, I have fought for, tane prisoner, and sent To Turin, a reward for our just war. Alva. Hah! the faire Evandra made prisoner? And Prospero by thee? Pros. Why should you thinke him whom you prais'd So much, unfit for such a victorie. Alva. Now all the blessings of my faithfull love Are lost; she whom I doated on with my Most chast, and early apetite, is sent In bonds, t'apease my cruell fathers wrath. Call. My Lord, he lov'd her much though temp'rately Conceald from gen'rall knowledge, and his friends. Pros. Then mount my courser Frivolo, and try If by the happy quicknesse of his speed, Thou canst recover her returne, and use Her with such faire respective homage as May expiate my violent surprize. Ex. Friv. Alva. Fly, fly; I would thy nimble motion could Oretake the arrow from th'Assyrian bow, Or swifter lightning whom our fight pursues And is to slow to reach. Pros. What have I done, that I should thus mistake An act of valiant glorie, for a deed That argues an austere Ignoble rage? Alv. Faire Evandra, the pide of Italy, In whom the Graces met to rectifie Themselves, that had not cause enough to blush Vnlesse for pitty they were not so good As she; think now the Easterne spices sweet, And that the blossoms of the spring perfume The morning ayre; necessity must rule Beliefe, lets strew our Altars with them now, Since she's imprisond, stifled, and chok'd up Like weeping Roses in a still, whose Inarticulate breath Heaven through a purer sacrifice than all our orizons. Pros. Is she not fitter then For Turin, than for Millaine sir? I saw You take prisoners, and in my fury had Discretion to atchieve the best. Alva. O thou hast lost my heart; hence doth proceed This recreant act, that to thy savage courage I could never joyne the temperature Of sweet Philosophy; hadst thou been learnd, And read the noble deeds of gentle knights, Reason had check'd thy rage, thy vallor would Have been more pittifull than to have lead A virgin into harsh captivity. Pros. I thought I had done well. Alv. How! well? draw back that falshood in thy breath Agen, or I will pierce thy heart, that thou Mayst dye Impenitent. Drawes his sword, Call. stayes him. Vnhand me Callandine, I've already met My better thoughts; why should I waste my wrath On such a forester? wild as the woods, Where he should graze with the brute heard, who though they want Discoursive soule, are lesse inhumane farre than he. Pros. She was the daughter of our greatest enemie, And so I us'd her sir. Alva. A cholerick Beare, or hungry Panther would Have us'd her with more soft remorce; had I Incounterd her in the mad heate of chace, In all the fury of the fight, I would Have taught my angry steed the easie and The peacefull motion of a lambe, She should have set his back, soft as the ayre, And in her girdle bridle him, more curb'd Than in his foaming bitt, whilst I her slave, Walk'd by, marking what hasty flowers sprung up, Invited by her eye-beames from their cold rootes; And this would each true soldier do, that had Refin'd his courage with the sober checks Of sweet Philosophy. Pros. Would you had taught me some Philosophy Before I learn'd to fight. Enter Frivolo. All hope is past; she was convey'd in one Of your swift chariots sir, which it doth seem Altesto did unhappily oretake, And she's ere this within our Turin walls. Pros. Such language and such newes better become The fatall birds of night, so Ravens croke When they fly ore the mansions of the sick And bode their deaths. Alv. Prospero, see me no more, Th'art a disease unto my injurd fight: Flye to some lustfull coast, where none but Goates And Satyrs live, where the name of virgin is As strange as this thy cruelty, there thou Mayst hope to wander not contemn'd, should I Behold thy face agen, and let thee live, My patience would become my vildest guilt. Cal. See, sir, he weepes; can you indure him mourne And languish thus, whom heeretofore you did Embrace in the chiefe ranck of love, not mov'd (Sir) with his teares? Alv. No more han to behold The pudled channell overflow, he saw Her weepe, and could indur't; the drops fell downe Me thinks, as when the pitteous Pelican Wounds her remorsefull breast. Pros. Sir, have I in one hasty moment, so Farre merited my ruine that no meanes Is left to winne me to your former grace. Alv. Never, unlesse thou couldst restore Evandras liberty, she is ere this Within my fathers reach, whose nature is Severe, and mortall to her fathers blood, An ancient vow he tooke, will make her destine So sad, I feare to thinke on it, poore Evandra. Pros. I sent her in good conduct to my house, VVhere is a cave, so art fully conceld Within my gardens verge, that not the sunnes Most prying beames, nor humane search Can ere discover it, Ile hide her there, Till time and apt convenience can dispose Her unto Millaine. Alva. Fly then, loose not the sick hope with slow Pursuit, fate keepe her from my father. Pros. Ile strive to groane away my breath, and die. Exit Pros. Cornet flourishes farr off. Frivo. Heark sir, the Duke your father sure Doth ride in triumph through the towne, to meete And celebrate your victorie. Alva. Give order that our troops march, march slowly on; Our Drums should now in sable cases beate Our collours foulded, and our Muskets be Reverst, whilst our dejected pikes we traile, But that I feare, t'would breed inquirie in My father of a cause, he must not know, O Callendine? Evandra is in bonds. Exit. Enter Vasco, Tristan, Leonell wounded and led. Vasco. Prepare the waggon Tristan, spread a matt in't, And (dost here) bid my Ancient teare of's collors For a coverlet, tis thine sir, all our Asist? Trist. All's ready sir, ith bottom of the hill, He shall be us'd like a Queen when shee lyes in. Uas. Softly Tristan, he moves as weakely as His sinnewes were of spinners threads, so cutt And carv'd; he hath made your skin sir, only Fit to be worne in summer; this Prospero Is a Turke when's whinyards drawne, and shines in's eyes. Leonell. He us'd me nobly sir, when I had bled My selfe past strength to conquer him, wee could I hope to finde such mercy in an Enemie Lesse I had fallen beneath the force of your Alvaro, Prince of Piemont. Vas. I there's a man; tis true, Lord Prospero vallant, I thinke he dares meet the devill in Duell, And give him two flashs of lightning odds, but He wants that they call learning sir, Prince Alvaro; Is (as they say) a philosopey man: He talkes of Rabins, and strange Hebrew roots; Things we dull Souldiers hither learn then mention. Trist. He can tell you sir how many showers fell Since Noahs flood. Vas. I, and how many cloakes those showers have wett. Leonell. Have you no knowledge of the Lady sir That was surpriz'd from my protection by young Prospero? Vas. Good; was ever creature of heavens making So libidinous as paltry man? now Has he a mind to the Lady? she sir, Is safe in Turin, whither strait we mean To lead you too. Leon. Some comfort yet; it is decreed I must Indure my bondage I where she suffers her's; Poore Evandra; was fate so niggardly She could allow no more protection for Thy beauty than my single fortitude? Trist. Come move on sir, it will be late ere we Shall reach the towne. Leon. What other fortune had the battaile? Vas. We swadled your Duke home he and the rest Of your bruis'd countymen have woundrous need Of capons greafe. Leon. Strange giddinesse of warre; some men must groane To further others mirth, what furie rules Ore humane sence, that we should struggle to Destroy in wounds, and rage, our life, that heaven Decreed so short: It is a mysterie Too sad to be remembred by the wise, That halfe mankind consume their noble blood, In causes not belov'd, or understood. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. ScÃ¦ne 1. Enter Vasco, Frivolo, Tristan. Fri. You have heard the proclaim'd law Vasco. Vas. I would there were no law, or that no man Were learn'd enough to read em, or that we had Courage enough not to obey them Trist. Frivolo, what law is this? Friv. It is proclaim'd all female prisoners After a yeare should have free libertie To returne to Millaine, and ransomlesse, Only a yeare is given to us the conquerors, That those we took of birth, and dowry may (If we can wooe them to consent) marry us, But wee have no power to use constraint, nor to Inforce a maidenhead, on paine of death. Vas. My beldam hath tane order with her maidenhead Ten yeares ere I was borne. Friv. I'th meane time Tristan, As a requitall for our hopes, we must Maintaine them at our own charge? Trist. Must not the men wee tooke pay ransome? Vas. Yes, yes, they pay: I have a Knight given me By young Count Prospero shall sell his spurrs Ere he scape free, I will pawne him till he Be worne toth' title of a Squire. Frivo. Thou art as cruell as a Constable That's wak'd with a quarrell out of his first sleepe. Vas. Hang him bold Cataian, hee indites finely; And will live as well by sending short Epistles Or by th'sad whisper at your gamsters elbow When the great by is drawne, as any bashfull Gallant of em all. Trist. But whats the cause our Duke is so severe Unto the heire of Millain (whom 'tis said Shall suffer instant death) yet is thus kind To others of her sex. Frivo. She dies to satisfie A vow hee made in's youth, when those of Millain Took his brother prisoner, and would not be Appeaz'd without the forfeiture of's head. Trist. I am not yet instructed Frivolo, VVhy should not then the rest we took dy too? Frivo. Evandra is a sacrifice for all; His other mercy takes from th'crueltie He showes on her. Enter Altesto Vas. From whence Altesto comes your loftinesse? Altest. Why, from the Duke; I had laid me For breakfast a fine comfortable ginne. Vas. VVhat was't, a wench? Altest. A rack Vasco, a rack; A certaine Instrument that will extend, and draw Our sinnews into treble strings, and stretch Our great shinne bones, till they become slender As knitting needles, or a Spiders leggs. Vas. Didst thou commit Treason? 'tis well thou hast A braine for any thing, the age requires Parts, we cannot eat else; but quick, the cause. Altest. 'Twas to discover where I left Evandra, VVhom Prospero deliver'd to my charge; I answer'd a full truth, that I restor'd Her to his hands, at his returne to's house, And this (as fortune would vouchsafe) the Duke Beleev'd without applying (Gentlemen) The recreation of the rack. Fri. But she is not yet found. Altest. No, and the Duke beleeves her still i'th Town. Therefore a guard is plac'd at all the gates to hinder her escape. Vasco. I do not like This cutting off young wenches heads; 'tis thought They cannot kisse hansomely without them. Trist. But how does Prospero excuse her flight? Altest. He saies she's stoln away, but shews no manner how; And th'angry Duke, though he be precious in His love, threatens him much. Vas. Some Angell stole her from him, and Gentlemen If I have any skill in Magick you Shall see her three daies hence pirking in a Cloud, Southward of yonder Star; look up, just there; With her Ivory Lute hanging at her back, And working me a scarfe of sky-colour'd Sattin. Altest. A halter (Vasco) to save the poore State The charge of a penny, thou'lt have need on't. Vas. What's become of Melora, your faire prisoner? You heare the Proclamation. Altest. Yes, and am well pleas'd, I meane to wooe, and marry her, she hath Twelve thousand crowns by good intelligence. Vas. If she consent; but I am of the faith, Such Suckets are but seldome swallow'd by Us wealthy Aldermen o'th Campe; a joynture Is the word Altesto, and then you'l shew her A young back with a Sword hanging over't, Worse than a handsaw. Altest. Just now I left her at my mothers house; And sirra Vasco, she looks, oh rogue, rogue A Flanders peake i'th middle of her brow, Which straight I spy, and shake, and melt, then speak Fine language to her, and am dutious with My Bonnet at her Instep thus.â Vas. Th'ast sound the way. Altest. Then Vasco she moves back, discovering but The very verge of both her picked toes, But in white Shoes, and then I'm taken that I stand like one of the Turkes chidden mutes, A girle in a Bongrace thus high may ravish me. Fri. Alas poore Gentleman! Altest. But Vasco, her fingers, by this good day, I think they are smaller than thy point tags, And she behaves them on the Virginals So prettily, I'd wish no more of heaven, Than once to hear her play Fortune my Foe: Or John come kisse me now. Vas. Those are tunes my old widdow prisoner sings With more division than a water work When the maine pipe is halfe stopt. Fri. You have a yeare allow'd to wooe her Vasco. Trist. She's rich, I knew her husband, he thriv'd much. By a monopoly he had of dead womens hair, All Millaine talk'd of it; she kept another shop Under St Maudlins wall, and quilted ushers Calves. Vas. Well Gentlemen, let's waste no time, I'le to My Barbers straight, purge, shave, and wash, for know If cleanenesse and good looks will do't Ile teach Her Grandameship to mump, and marry too, Or my arts faile; Frivolo, you and Tristan Follow me, I shall employ you both. Altest. I am for Prospero, he sent to speak with me. Exeunt. Enter Alvaro, Prospero (with a Key, and Lights.) Pros. Sir, you have made me know my cruelty, 'Twas such uncomely valour, that I blush To name't, and trust me, could I sink low as The Center whilest I kneel, stil would I thus Implore your pardon, and your love. Kneels Alva. Arise, I have a memory so apt T'advance my pitty 'bove my anger when It mentions thee, that Ile forget the cause That made thy guilt, and me to mourne; but O, This dismal place brings it again to thought, This lookes methinks like to the dark And hidden dwelling of the winds, as yet Unknown to men, where storms ingender, and The whirling blasts that trouble Nature till She tremble at their force, and ruine all The sumptuous piles of Art. Pros. Necessity hath caus'd this choice, till the Severe inquiry of your Father be Appeas'd, and we can shape her a disguise fit to Convey her from the Towne. Alva. VVith soft and gentle summons call, that she May clime unto the top, and verge o'th cave. Pros. Evandra, speak, ascend to us; I am Your penitentiall Enemy, that come To weep away my trespasse at your feet. Alva. Evandra, rise, break from this thick And silent darknesse, like the eldest light. The Stage opens, Prospero lifts Evand. up. Evan. Ha! my Lord the Prince? Alva. O noble mind, what expiation can Make fit this young and cruell Souldier for Society of men, that hath defin'd The Genius of triumphant glorious war VVith such a rape upon thy liberty? Or what lesse hard than marble of The Parian Rock, canst thou beleeve my heart, That nurc'd and bred him my Disciple in The Campe, and yet could teach his valour no More tendernesse than injur'd Scythians use VVhen they are vex'd to a revenge? but he Hath mourn'd for it, and sure Evandra thou Are strangely pittifull, that dost so long Conceale an anger that would kill us both. Evand. Sir, I am nobly recompenc'd, in that You will vouchsafe me worthy of your grief, And though I dye forgotten here (a poore And luckless maid) lost like a blossome which Th'injurious wind buries in dust, yet so Much courtesie deserves to be remembred even in heaven. Alva. Was this a subject fit to beare the pride And insolent calamity of war? As well had it become in the worlds youth The Giant Race, to hunt with mighty speare And iron shield, the soft and tender Ermine; Evandra, I have lov'd thee much, and long. Why dost thou start, as if some jealous thought Did whisper that my love devis'd this snare To keep thee here within my power and reach? Evand. I cannot think you are so cruell to Your self, t'afflict the thing that you esteem. Alva. No beautious maid, had I beheld thy flight In our sterne exercise of wrath, I would Have made the bloudy field a garden fit I' adorne the shews of a triumphant peace; And ev'ry soldier like a reaper cloth'd, Fitter to use his sickle than his sword. Still thou recoyl'st like the chaste Indian plant, That shrinks and curles his bashfull leaves, at the Approach of man. Evan. I've lost my reason, and I want the courage To entertaine you kindnesse as I ought. Alva. Is it because my yeares a little have Oregrowne my youth, or that the enmity Our Fathers interchange begetts in thee A factious hate, till't make thy duty sinne? But tis not possible thou canst create A thought will merit such a name. Evan. The gentle businesse sir of love is fit For howers more calme, and blest than those A captive can injoy. Alva. These are not words To quiet me in sleepe, &amp; peacefull thoughts. Pros. Nor shall I evermore rellish delights And triumphs of the court, or haughty joyes Of warre and victorie. Alva. Evandra live, be yet some happinesse Vnto thy selfe, and with the patience that Becomes a maids divinitie, relieve Thy heart with easie hope of libertie, Inforcing a content within this darke And solitarie cave, till I have power With apt disguise to further thy escape, Which shall be hastned with my ablest skill. Beleeve me good Evandra, the honour of My birth and soule shall warrant it. Evan. You are a Prince renound, and precious for Your faith, and courtesie. Alva. Thinke not Ile use advantage, or constraint Vpon thy love, a virgins heart (I know) Is sooner strok'd than check'd into a kind Surrender of her breast. Evan. Sir, all the bounties that the heavens provide For truth and clemency, fall on your still. Alva. If thou suspect'st I've not enough of cold And holy temper to resist the flames Of appetite, command that I shall see Thee here no more, &amp; my obedience straite Shall be restraind within a sacred vow, For I would have thy thoughts (Evandra) safe As thy beauties are. Evan. It were a crime Greater (I hope) than I shall ere commit To doubt such princely goodnesse can pervert it selfe. Alva. Then I shall cherish oportunities To hasten my returne. Evan. Not Angells sure when they converse, can meet VVith lesse intent of sinne, and more of joy? Alva. VVell, I must see thee oft, thy wondrous eyes Have softned all my spirits to a calme And easie temper for thy sway, that I Could change my corslet, and my iron vests Of rugged war, to move in gentle pace, Vnto the tunefull whispers of thy Lute, Still cloth'd in tender garments of thy work, And for a plumed Helmet weare chapletts Of flowers, in a mysterious order rank'd By thy white virgin hand, then like thy neat Ore 'busie maid, bind up thy looser philetting And pleate in curles thy soft dishevelld haire. Ile make my frequent visits here till thou Confesse how much I am subdu'd. Evand. I am opprest with feare, the watchfull Duke Your father should observe, unto this sad Vnusuall place, your stolne approach, &amp; then My sorrowes would be doubled in your danger. Alva. Danger? how noble lovers smile at such A thought? 'tis love that onely fortifies And gives us mighty vigor to attempt On others force, and suffer more than we Inflict; would all the souldiers that I leade In active war, were lovers too, though leane, Feebled, &amp; weakned with their ladys frowns; How when their valours stirrd, would they march strong, Through hideous gulphs, through numerous herds Of angry Lyons, and consuming fire? Knock within. Evan. What doubtfull noyse is that? Alva. 'Tis Calladine, I did appoint him here. Stay Prospero, let him not enter yet; O envious chance, must we depart so scone? They put Evandra downe in the cave. Descend like the bright officer of day, Whilst darkned we thy beauteous absence mourne, And every flower doth weepe till thy returne? Opens the doore, lets in Calladine. Pros. His looks declare there's hazard, and some haste. Alv. What wouldest thou? speake. Cal. The Duke your father (sir) is much perplext; He calls for Prospero, and it is feard, Will torture him to find Evandra's flight. Alva. He shall not yet appeare; I will indure His angers edge with venture of my selfe. Stay till I send. Exit. Cal. My Lord, I grieve to see your sorrowes beare So great a weight, as makes you groane unto Your selfe; this silence, and fixation of Your eyes, untill unchanged objects cause Them ake, is much unlike your wonted mind; Suspect not but the Prince will qualifie His Father to a peace, and a more just Interpretation of your worth. Pros. Know Calladine, 'tis not Evandras bonds, Nor all the torments that th'incensed Duke From cruelty or art can minister, Have power to freeze, and fire me like a statue thus; I have another cause that swels my heart, Till't grow too spacious for my breast. Cal. 'Las sir! your favours have oblig'd me so That I must share your griefe, and 'twould perhaps Afford some remedy to share the cause. Pro. I know not Calladine in the vast world One I more love, or would so boldly trust; But thou wilt think me mad. Cal. My Lord, Ile forget then my manners, and My reason too. Pro. Come, thou shalt know, I loveâ How wilt thou smile to see m'ambitious eyes Looke higher than the Eagle, when he soares To elevate his sight? I loveâ Cal. Who is't you love? Pro. Evandra; now mixe pitty in thy scorn. Cal. 'Tis sad the Prince and you should meet with so Much violence in the same choice. Pro. At first, i'th rage of fight, I gaz'd on her, With halfe discernings of her forme, a mire Of fury hung between us then, but since That I have viewd her beauty with some care, And seen how sweetly she demeanes her in Calamity, I have orethrown my heart With liking her too much. Cal. It will require great wisdome to perswade In this, the cause is dangerous. Pro. Would I had nere been born, then I had miss'd The sight and memory of her, and my Fond errors should have been as much unknown As m' uncreated selfe. Enter Altesto. Alt. My Lord, your servant gave me entrance with Command that I should speake with you. Pro. 'Tis true; Altesto y'have a maiden prisoner, Call'd Melora; 'tis my request that you Conduct her hither in disguise; though law Newly proclaimd, allow no ransome for her, You shall be paid your own demand. Altest. Ile obey your Lordship, she shall attend You straight, what use can he imploy her to? Prosp. Come Calladine, ease me with thy counsell. Exeunt. Enter Vasco, Tristan, Frivolo, Lelia. Vas. Is Lelia your own prisoner Tristan? Trist. The powerful purchase of my sword. Vas. What is she heire to? a brasse thimble, and A skeane of brown thread? she'l not yeeld thee in Algiers above a ducket being strip'd; And for her clothes they'r fitter for a papermill Than a Pallace. Fri. Let her serve your captive widdow. Vas. Why Tristan, that's a yeares wages for you; 'Tis well thought on; will you serve Lelia? Lel. I hope sir I shall be fit to serve. Vas. Yes, serve for an Hospitall, when the sins Of the Campe are retir'd into your bones; She's vilely out of Linnen. Trist. How can I help't? Vas. Let her make love to a Sexton, and steale shrowds. Fri. Trust my knowledge Vasco, she's for thy turne, Present her to thy widdow, she may wooe In thy behalf, toste plum cakes for her Muskadine, And brush her velvet hood on holy-dayes. Vas. Tristan convey her to her as my gift; But Lelia you must speake notable words Of me, first what a goodly man I am; That I get Matrons at a hundred and ten VVith double Twins, and how in time of warre I fill up the muster with mine own Issue. Lel. Marry sir, heaven forbid. Vas. D'you heare? this wench has been villanously Ill bred; and Ile lay my life She sings at her work too the holy caroll O'th Ladies daughter converted in Paris; She was of Paris properly, &amp;c. Trist. Fie Lelia, you must now take care, you are Not now i'th Campe, but in a civill Common wealth. Lel. I shall endeavour sir to learne. Vas. Nor must you perswade you Mistris rise Too early to her beads, she may catch cold, Having already a pestilent cough, And so will dye before I marry her. Lel. I hope I shall not be so mischievous. Vas. VVell Gentlemen, the fruitfull houre is now Drawn neere that gives successe, this morning must Expose me to great charge. Fri. Thou dost not meane To court her at her window with rare musick? Vas. No, she's very deafe, so that cost is sav'd. Fri. What other charge? she hath no teeth fit for A dry banquet, and dancing she is past, Unlesse with crutches in an Antimasque. Vas. I must provide her Culleises, and Broths That may stir metall in her, in this case She is, know my good friends, I find Her no more fit for the businesse of encrease, Than I am to be a Nunne. Trist. Thou wilt take care to trim thy person. Vas. I came just now from consultation with My Barber, who provides me a large maine, A lock for the left side, so rarely hung With Ribbanding of sundry colours sir, Thou'lt take it for the Rainebow newly crisp'd And trim'd, Bucephalus nere wore the like. Fri. VVhen you have reach'd Sir Leonels Ransome, And the rich widdows wealth, we are forgot, Like creatures of Japan, things hardly to Be search'd for in the Map. Trist. In one short month I shall not know his name. Vas. 'Tis then because thou canst not read, for thou Shalt find it fairely carv'd on each new Church And Hospitall, I meane to build apace, And have my blew boyes March through the streets Two and two, provided for in guilded Primmers, And their chops of mutton; go haste to the widdows, Present your Damsel, Ile be with you straight; My captive Knight would speak with me. Exeunt. Manet Vas. Enter Leonell. Leon. I am bold sir to make free use of your Most spacious roomes for benefit of aire. Vas. Sir you are welcome, 'tis a liberty That I expect, and I joy much your wounds So prosper in their cure. Leon. You shew your inclination kind and noble: But is there of Evandra yet no newes? You promis'd to enquire whether her flight Be true, or to what place she made escape. Vas. No certaintie is known, but all the Court Troubled with doubts, shortly you will heare more. Leo. If you could bring me sir to Prospero, Or to the Prince, on some affaires that may Perhaps advantage them, and my own good, You shall oblige me much to serve you in My better state of fortunes Vas. I will endavor't, and as you find Me ready to assist all your requests, I hope sir, youle see cause to pay your ransome With what haste you can, for I would faine be able To doe good deeds, &amp; we have many poore I'th towne that want their charitie, who have A will as ready as their wealth. Leon. Beleeve me you expresse a soule that hath Been bred, and exercis'd in holy thoughts. Vas. Faith sir not much, only you know a man Would joy to doe some good whilst he's alive, For after death our gifts I ever thought Rather proceeded from a devout necessity, Than any free desire. Leon. Tis wisely urg'd. Vas. It hath been a maxime I have held long. Leo. And it becomes you still; my ransome shall Be suddenly prepard. Vas. I thanke you sir; follow, &amp; Ile procure You an addresse toth' prince or Prospero. Exit. Leon. If she were fled, her person is of so Esteem'd, and eminent a rate, that straight Her instant residence must needs be known. There is much art in these affaires; how will She looke on me, that in so great a cause Could strike, or yeeld to angry fate? I will Indure her scornes, as a deserv'd reward, Nor should a lovers hopes grow cold because The Influence that last did governe him, Was sick, and cold, that destiny is gone, The firmament containes more starres than one. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. ScÃ¦na 1. Enter Leonell and Prospero, (with a light and a key.) Pros. It glads me to behold your strength so well Restor'd, and sir, I wish the fortune of My sword, had met another cause, &amp; enemie; Your ransome I have paid, and so much prize Evandra's happinesse, that since you make't Appeare your company will render her Some quietnes, and joy, in this her sad And solitarie state, you shall both see, and stay with her. Leon. From my first infancy I tooke my speech And breeding in her fathers court, and by My neereness to her, both in deeds and place I'th day of fight, you may beleeve I am Of qualitie enough to be esteemd and wellcom'd in her miserie. Pros. Your valour then did speake you more than all The praise your modestie can urge, Leon. My Lord, it is your gentlenesse to have A courteous faith, but I am bold to think My fight will comfort her so much that she Will pay you thanks for giving so free trust Vnto my confidence. Pros. My kindnes to you I shall reserve Till happier howers, this sir, is for her sake, That she may have the benefit of your Approach, retire a while within, that key When I am gone, will open you a doore, That leades unto a cave.â Exit Leonell. Melora? where art thou? this way, the light Conducts thee; thou art safe. Enter Melora. Mel. How darke, &amp; like the dusty hollownes Of tombes where death inhabits, this appeares? Pros. Now you shall know the cause why I have bought Your liberty, Evandra, daughter to Your Millain duke, lyes here imprisond by The chance of battaile, and thus hidden, and Reserv'd, till we can free her by disguise. Melor. O sad discoverie of a sorrow worse Than I indure, I hop'd she had escap'd. Pros. I heard that thou wert taken in her traine, But when the storyes of thy beauty and Thy vertues reach'd mine eare, I did beleeve Thou hadst familiar knowledge of her face And thoughts. Mel. I know too much of her, to think that Heaven Could thus permit her languish in a Cave. Pro. None can resist their destinie; but good Melora comfort her, and prethee for Kind pitty when your conversation shall Beget some pleasant houre, mention my care, And then my love; for know, she hath so wrought Upon my heart, that trust me I shall melt Like Tapers overcharg'd with flame, and die; Wilt thou implore in my behalfe? Melo. Your bounties have oblig'd me to performe My best, else I were cruell sir. Pro. Feare no surprize, you are secure, for twice To day, my house by sterne Authority Was search'd, but vainly they suspect, and strive To find this hidden dwelling, that no art Can imitate for secresie and depth. Mel. will you be gone? Pros. I'm sent for to the Pallace where I'm told I shall endure for this concealement more Than natures strength can beare, but I've a soule Dares welcome it with scorne. Ent. Evand. Mel. Lend me the light; look, there's Evandra sir. Pro. It is, remember me, that I may live. Exit. Mel. This mingled passion of strange griefe and joy, I can no longer quietly containe; Hail the most beautious virtue of the world. Evand. Lov'd Melora, what dismall chance, more than My sorrow can digest, hath brought thee here? Mel. Why am I thought on, or enquir'd for as A creature that deserves a life, whilst you Remaine within the house and armes of death? Evan. I feare thou art a captive too. Mel. Or else the tyranny of war had been Too much unjust, wer't fit you languish thus, And I like to a wanton bird should play And wing the aire at liberty? and yet My ransome's freely paid. Evan. Then thou art now no prisoner? Mel. A prisoner to you, or else my heart Were dull, and rudely mannerd to permit Evandra suffer here alone; this war Hath quickly nurc'd strange Ridles too of love. Evan. Thou dost complaine with cause, 'tis in the Prince. Mel. Another of your Enemies; too much Of leasure I shall have t'acquaint you with The accident that brought me to your sight. Enter Leonell. Evan. Melora, who is that? Mel. Blesse me how miracles increase to fright Astonishment! sure there is Magick in This place; Madam, my Brother Leonel. Leon. Ha Melora? art thou here too? such mysteries In change so soon ariv'd I have not read. Evan. But what unheard of star directed thee To see, and taste our miserable state? Leon. Ere I begin the little history Of the short time that thus hath varied us, Low as the earth I fall to make you pittifull. Kneeles. Forgive the crime of destiny, not me, That left me feeble as an Aguish girle With the faint losse of bloud, when I had tooke Upon my youth &amp; strength, the noblest cause That ere imployd the anger of a man, Your liberty; but Levetites, and Doves Are valianter than I, for else what make You in captivity? Evan. Beleeve me sir, your passion is so great I understand it not; pray rise, I know You fought with all the forward will and might That humane rage could shew, but the success Of valour they above dispose, that are More wise and stronger than our selves. Leon. Sure I could weep, but that my eyes Have not enough of funerall dew to melt Away; sister, pray pardon my neglect, You'l find I am not courteous to my self. Melora. The time compells distracted thoughts in all. Evan. There is a banke within, though cold and bare, Where never flower (in a dispaire of sunne) Durst fix his root, there we will fit, talke and Compare our miseries; then sing like Philomel. That wisely knowes the darknesse only fit For mourning and complaint; leade there the light. Exeunt. Enter Duke (with letters) Alvaro, Prospero, Calladine, attendants. Duk. Evade me not with such fond circumstance, Fit only to perswade the easinesse Of vntaught babes; have I not here receiv'd Her fathers letters, that petition her Release? why should he sooth me thus with low Demeanour in his phrase, if she were free? Or if not in the towne inclos'd and hid, Where would she sooner fly than to his armes? Alva. Sir, give my duty boldnes to beleeve If she were here &amp; some good man (that now Conceales her in his pittious feare) shall to Asswage your wrath deliver her, you would Not marke her out for death? Duk. No sir, how cheape then, and how fraile will you Suppose my vowes? what need we trick, And dresse our Altars with such reverend care Lets rather straight pervert their use, grease them VVith gluttony, and feasts, defile and wash Them with the riot of excessefull wine; Is perjurie the least of guilt you can Perswade me to commit? Alva. I wish you would allow m' obedience leave To utter truth; the vow you made was rash, And not confirmd with oath, or church solemnitie. Pros. And I am taught the cruelties, or the Revenge we threaten, heaven is pleas'd when they Are never acted but forgot. Duke. Her sterne, and deafned father, when we sought And woo'd his mercy with humility, More than dejected Hermites on their knees Render to Saints, us'd not my brother with Remorse, but snatch'd him from the world in all His pride of youth, his wise, and ripened thoughts, When he was fit to rule a nations fate, And exercise mankind in what was bold, And good, then shall I not revenge the best Of all my blood, whilst I have here the chiefe of his. Alva. Alas, this act sir, was not hirs, nor in The justice of our reason is it possible By derivation or descent to share a guilt. Pros. Would I had lost the benefit of strength When I surprizd her, to become the instrument And pleasure of your rage. Duke. How Count? so bold? heare me thou saucy child And minion of the war, whom fortune, not Successe from vertue sprung, hath lifted to A pride more dangerous than traytors thoughts, Though I have search'd thy house, &amp; am defeated by Some charme of my discoverie, I still Beleeve thou know'st her residence, &amp; bring Her to my fight, ere yet the Sun decline, or thou shalt die. Alva. I must not live to see it then, nor can My businesse here on earth, intice me to One minutes stay in my mortality, When I behold your goodnesse so decaid. Duke. Alvaro was that said like one that knowes His duty to a Father, and a Prince? Alv. I would be heir unto your vertue sir, As well as to your bloud. Duke. Have I outliv'd my courage, office, and My reason too, tamely to suffer this? I know thy false ambitious cunning well, Thou fain wouldst vexe my weary soule away That thou mightst raigne, and triumph ore my tombe; But heare, and tremble at my vow. Cal. Sir, for regard of heaven repent what you Would speak, ere utter'd it become too great A sin for mercy to excuse. Duke. No more fond Calladine, I am resolv'd, Since thou art covetous to own his guilt, He shall be safe, and thou endure his punishment; Bring me Evandra here ere yet the day Conceale his light, or the next darkness shall Eternally be thine. Alv. If on my knees I can perswade you to An easier doome, thus I endeavour it. Pros. I beg not to entreat your rigor lesse, But as 'twas first design'd you would convert It all on me. Alva. That kindness was ill manner'd Prospero; Dost think thou art more worthy of the cause When 'tis to be Evandra's Sacrifice? Duke. Nere strive, thou shalt have sufferance enough, And gloriously alone; hence from my sight Thou birth ill gotten, and my marriage stain. Alva. Ile keep my duty still, though not your love. Ex. Alva. &amp; Pro. Cal. Dread sir, call back your vow, and then the Prince, Yet comfort him; what will the world esteeme Of such an act as time nere paraleld, And no Posterity be so unkind as to believe? Du. Thou maist as well perswade th'assembled winds From all their violence at Sea; lend me Thine eareâdo this, but Calladine take heed Thy prosecutions are not faint; I have A younger son in Sicilly, renown'd And deare to Fame, him I will strive to plant I'th peoples hearts; as thou are Loyal follow me. Exeunt. Enter Altesto, Frivolo, Vasco, (fantastically accouterd.) Vas. Just in the posture as you see me Gentlemen, Not a baire lesse i'th Lock; and I beleev'd The heart of woman was not able to Resist such amorous formes. Altest. But she would none? Vas. Name her the pleasures of the marriage bed, She cries she is more taken with the grave, 'Cause there we are not wak'd with cough not aches. Altest. Why sure she knows, for she looks as she had Been long buried. Vas. And then I us'd fine phrases, And talk'd (what call you it?) of Hymens Tapers, Which she interprets sir, according to Some modern Doctresse of her Sect, Hel fire, A warmth (you know) we Souldiers do abhor. Fri. 'Tis base to need it after death; we have Been hardly bred, and can endure the cold. Enter Widow, and Lelia. Vas. She comes, this is her breathing roome, use your Endeavours Gentlemen; tell her, her frowns Already have so wrought, that my life now Will nere be fit to come into a Lease. Wid. Lelia a Chaire, I cannot last; 'tis more Than 58 yeares since I had hams to trudge. Vas. I am your Guardian that come to visit you. Wid. What need it sir? I practice no escape I cannot flye. Vas. No? were the window open You would behave your selfe as nimbly on Your wings as any witch in Europe. Wid. What saies he Lelia, a witch? Lel. He saies we must one day all flye upward, Heaven is the place we wish for. Wid. 'Tis well said sir, for thither we must go, Both old and young, no remedy. Vas. As soone as you please if you'l but marry me. Wid. Does he talk of marriage? Lel. He sayes, if you please forsooth. Wi. Alas my vow of widowhood is not yet Expir'd; if he comes some ten yeares henceâ Altest. About that time she'l make a good wife For an Antiquary to get Records on. Fri. Although her skin be Parchment, 'tis not large Enough to write her Annals in, sh'ath liv'd so long already. Uas. How did you like the culleise widow that I sent you last? Wid. Why sir? It went down. Uas. Though the Sea were turn'd to plumbroth, t'would all down; I have measur'd her throat, 'tis wider (gent) And deeper than a well; alas the Duke Considers not my charge, i'd rather boord Too Young Giants, and allow each of them A wolfe in stead of a dog t'eat) their fragments. Alt. Thou shouldst get her mouth search'd, I'le lay my life Sh'ath new furnish'd her gummes with artificiall teeth, She could not grinde so else. Friv. Though you must feede her at your owne cost, the proclamation Beleeve me allowes none but naturall teeth. Uas. When she is once i'th fit of swallowing, If a capon float in her broth, why she Considers it no more than a small bee, or a May fly. Lelia. You should beare up, you are too backward sir. Uas. Sayst thou so wench; widow prepare your selfe, For I must marry you to night, or else You fast to morrow; if the Duke will not Afford us fasting dayes, I shall make bold To borrow 'em o'th Kalender; this night; No longer time to delay a good deed. Wid. Vh, uh, uh. Altest. This cough (Vasco) is of some great antiquity. How wilt thou sleep by her? Frivo. A little Opium after supper, and let her cough like a Cannon from a sort, I'le free thee from waking. Vas. Come, come, provide, trimme up your hood widow. And ayre your petty coates i'th sunnes, it is A case of conscience Gent. we must All marry, and live chast. Wid. Why sir, if we must needs. Altest. I thought she would consent good heart; it is As towardly an old thing. Deare Vasco, Provide us musick, wee'l dance her to death: Thou shalt be her husband ere night, and her Executor before morning. Vas. Sooth Gent. that's all I desire, Any thing, that is reason contents me. Friv. Go, kisse her, by this hand a Brownist is More amorous; a notch'd prentice a very Aretine in comparison of thee. Vasco kisses her. Vas. By your leave widow. Wid. Much good may't do you sir; these comforts come But seldome after fourescore; the world (indeed) Is grown so wicked that we never thinke Of comforting one another. Lel. I told you she would soften sir; alas, A little raw, and modest at the first. Altest. A very green pippin of the last yeares growth. Vas. You shall finde me a kind of sparrow widow, A barly corne does as much as a potatoe. Wid. Blessing on your heart sir, we should doe good Freely (as they say) without egging on. Uas. Rise, and stir your feet, 'tis healthfull for you. They lift her up. Thereâsoftly,âsoâ Altest. If one of the haires of my eyebrow lye But in her way, she's gone, and falls like an Elephant, whose leggs are cut with a chaine shot. Friv. Her Os Sacrum needs a little Prop. Vas. Why Gentlemen, ther's nere a wench in Italy Moves farther in a day, provide her litter But easie, and her two mules well fed. Courage widow; how is it now? Wid. A certaine stitch sir in my side, but t'will away in time. Uas. I you are young enough, But given too much to hoyring, and to barly breake, Then dance naked till you take cold; good faith You must looke too't Lelia, take heed you aire Her wedding smock. Altest. Let it be made of Catts skin furre: Frivo. Or a watch mans rugge gowne, but that her skin Will weare it out too soone. Vas. Frivolo, yo' are too lowde. Frivo. I warrant thee I have measured her eares, She heares in distance but an inch length. Uas. You'l in, and set the house in order widow? I'le fetch a priest. Wid. Truly sir, I'ld faine aske my friends advice, One that hath seen but little of the world Would be glad you know of counsell. Vas. No counsell widdow, nay, if you want metall Let them call't rashnesse, our youth will excuse all. Wid. VVell Sir, you know where marriages are made, 'Tis not my fault; Lelia, provide a broome And sweepe away the rhume neere the green Couch; And (d'you heare) look for one my cheek teeth That dropt under the wanscore bed. Lel. And shall I stop't forsooth with salt? Wid. I, and fling't 'ith fire; you are weary sir? Uas. No quite so lusty (widow) as your selfe, But shall keepe pace the journey being so short. Enter Altesto. Alt. Quick, in with her Uasco, whilst the fit holds. Exeunt Widow, Uas. Lel. With cable and thong he drew her along, so heavily to the Priest, And vow'd to undoo her, ere he did wooe her, make her up after who list. Frivo. Ah Rogue, thou art a very Larke in the morning. Altest. And what at night Frivolo? Friv. A very owle. Altest. Thou art a coxcombe, beyond all redemption Of wit, lesse thou straight resolve to marry Lelia; Thy friends will think the match so fit, none shall Forbid the banes; I knew her mother too: She's wondrous rich in pewter, small wine caske, And spits. Friv. Yes, I have heard o'th wealthy Dowager, She kept a thatch'd Nunnery in my quarter. Enter Tristan. Trist. Wher's Uasca Gentlemen? I am in haste. Altest. Why then for more dispatch answer you selfe. Trist. The Duke hath sent for him, by Calladines: Who told me 'twas for busines of import; The Court is all disturb'd, but for what use He is design'd, I cannot learne; where is he? Altest. Follow, wee'l convey thee to him; strange luck; Sir Leonells ransome, this widowes wealth, And now imployd at Court? Uasco th'art a gon man, Vsury, furrd gownes, long dinners, and short sleepes, Thou art condemnd to without help; or hope. Exeunt. Enter Evandra, Melora Leonell, (at one dore) at the other Prospero, (muffled and hid) A Table and lights set out, Evandra sets to reade. Leo. Sister a where is your tendernesse? shall I Be ever lost through your defect of will And courage to present me to her eare In winning characters? tell her how long VVith fervencie I have pursued my love. Melo. Vnhappy Leonell, why dost thou tempt Me with impossible desires how oft Have I sollicited thy sure with a Repulse? and she hath charm'd me by a vow Never to mention't more, till her release. Pros. False Leonell, did I for this assist Thee to injoy her lov'd societie, That thou shouldst rivall me, and have more fit Convenience for thy wishes than me self? Melora is his sister too, what strange New chances have these later howers produc'd? I have no Advocate, nor am I bold Enough to be mine owne. Leon. I see you love me not; And since I am a trouble to your sight, Ere long thou shalt behold my face no more. Pro. Thou art a Prophet to thy self, and I Thy Priest to cut thee out in Sacrifice, Although unworthy of Evandras deity. Leon. Melora, can you shew no kind remorse? Mel. Alas, you do mistake my power and will; Think on some other beauty, for the world Hath many that may make you fortunate. Leon. None but Evandra governs in my breast. Pro. Her thou shalt nere enjoy; lend me thine eareâ (Leads him aside. Leon. Ha! Prospero? Pro. False Knight; was this the cause That made thee beg conceal'd admittance here To practice love where I had planted mine? Leon. My Lord I understood not of your love. Pro. If thou art bold, and since thy vanquishment Darst tempt a second hazard of my sword, Go waite me on the garden mount, there I Will order, though my heart is doubtfull to Enjoy Evandras love, thine never shall. Leon. I will expect thee there, and fiercely long To ravish from thy crest the honour that I lent thee in our former fight. Exit. Enter Alvaro. Alva. Evandra, reach me thy faire hand that I Seale on it my last farewell. Evand. Ha, whither do you go? Alva. Where shadows vanish when the worlds eye wincks, Behind a cloud, and they are seene no more; The place of absence where we meet (by all The guesse of learned thought) we know not whom, Only a prompt delight we have in faith Gives us the easie comfort of a hope, That our necessitie must rather praise than feare as false. Evan. O horrid mystery! my tender senses are amaz'd, I faine Would learne what it is dangerous to know. Mel. Why do the stars neglect us thus? why should VVe lose the noblest and the best of men? Pro. Me thinks my spirits climbe and lift me to A valiant envy of his sufferings. Alva. That thou mayest live here safe till Prospero Restore thee unto liberty and light, I must to darknesse go, hover in clouds, Or in remote untroubled aire, silent As thoughts, or what is uncreated yet: Or I must rest in some cold shade where is No flowry spring, nor everlasting growth, To ravish us with sent, and shew, as our Philosophy hath dreamt, and rather seems To wish than understand. Evan. All this for me; you shall not dye; why will You lay so cheape a value on your selfe, To think the world should lose you for my sake, Alas, a needlesse triviall Virgin that Can never shew in hopefull promise halfe That excellence which you reveale in art. Alv. It is decreed; Evandra thou mayst live T'encrease the small example we have left Of vertue, which hath made thy breast her throne; Time hath begun to weare away my youth, And all the good I can performe is to Preserve the future hope of it in thee. Evan. Melora, help, sorrow hath fild my heart With such a heavinesse, that I must sink Beneath its weightâhere let me lye, and mourne, And chide that haughty destiny that thinks Us so unworthy of their care. Mel. My Lord the Prince, Is it no lesse than death Of her, or you, can ease your Fathers wrath? Alv. The doome is past, and the sad houre will want No wings to hasten its approach; come hither Prospero. Pro. It must not be; though I want phrase to shew My nature smooth, it shall appeare in deeds. Alv. I charge thee by our love, by all my care That bred thee from thy childhood to a sense Of honour, and the worthiest feates of war, Thou keep Evandra safe till happier daies Conspire to give her liberty, use her With such respective holinesse as thou Wouldst do the reliques of a Saint inshrind, And teach thy rougher manners tendernesse Enough to merit her society. Pro. What need this conjuration sir? I meane To dye for her, that I may save your life; A brave design, disswade me not, though I Faile oft in choice of fitting enterprise, I know this is becoming sir, and good. Alva. Thou dye for her? alas poore Prospero That will not satisfie, the shaft aimes here, Or if it wou'd, I do not like thou shouldst Thus presse into a cause that I reserve To dignifie my selfe; urge it no more. Pros. VVhat am I fit for then, if not to die. Eva. How am I worthy of this noble strife? Alva. Evandra rise, that I may see some hope And comfort in thy strength, before I take My everlasting leave. Evan. You have the voyce of death already sir. Mel. Dismall it sounds, like the last groane which men In torture breath out with their soule. Alva. I could have wish'd I might enjoy thee and Be mortall still, mix in a love that should Produce such noble vertues as would soone Entice the Ange's to live here, yet not B'our conversation grow impair'd; but these Are wishes made too high, and late to thrive. For evermore farewell.â Evan. O sir, where wil you leave me then? Alva. How pittie moystens me? there in the Cave. Evan. It is the mansion Sir of death, something Horrid as midnight thoughts can forme so frights Me still, I tremble when I enter it. Alva. Ha! what that is but humane dares disturbe thy quietnesse? Pro. Sir let me see, it dies if it be vulnerable. Alva. Still you usurpe my Businesse Prosperoâ Bide there, I will go down my selfe. Evan. Sir, 'twill not presently appeare. Alva. I will attend its saucy leasure then. (descends the Cave. Evan. Lock safe the doore Melora with this Key. Pro. VVhat's your designe? meane you t'imprison him? Evan. Discover (Prospero) the inside of Thy breast; dost thou affect the Prince? Pro. Next to the absent blessings that our faith Perswades us to, eternity of joyes. Evan. VVhy then wilt thou permit that he should taste A long forgetfulnesse in a darke grave? Let us invent some way to ease him of This penance undeserv'd, and suffer it our selves. Mel. O glorious maid! this goodnesse will confer A dignity for ever on our Sexe. Pro. I'm strangely taken with this virgins thoughts, Let me embrace your hand upon my kneeâ I thank you much, you have some mercy on My dull unknowing youth, and can believe Me fit for noble enterprize, though he Unkindly did deny my sute: Ile to The Duke and tempt his fury till he cause My death, perhaps when his revenge hath quench'd Her thirst with my warm bloud, it may grow cold, And kindly temperd to you both, And then I've fully satisfied the crime Of your captivity, and his free sufferance. Mel. This Souldier hath a great and daring heart. Pro. But how shall I enjoy her then? I scarce Can understand the happinesse it beares: Tis odd ambition this, but yet 'tis brave, Ile do't: besides, though I'm not learn'd to know VVith certainty, yet I have hope I shall Be sensible of all her visits to My tombe, and ev'ry flower she strewes will there Take growth as on my garden banks, whilst I (Delighted spirit) walke and hover 'bout Their leaves, comparing still their sent with hers; O twill be wondrons brave! Lady, dispatch, That I may goe, and die. Evan. Since you expresse your will, so kinde, and violent, That small provision there allotted to Sustaine my life, reach up, and straight convay Into the cave, that he may finde it out, And not exchange the paine his father would Inflict, for famishment. Pros. takes from behind the Arras a bottle and bag, they open the Cave. Pros. I had almost forgot false Leonell, He waits me on the mount, I will be with Him straight, and end his hopes by a long sleepe Ere I begin mine owne. (Descends the Cave. Evan. Once more Melora lock the doore; now they Are both secure, tis thou and I that must Take solemne leave, and never meete in this Our beauty, colour, or our warmth agen. Melo. I am astonish'd at her excellence, And scarce have humble grace enough to keepe Ambitious envy from my thoughts. Evan. VVhy should these mighty spirits lay so vast An obligation on our sex, and leave Eternall blushes on our soules, 'cause we In acts of kinder pitty, and remorse (The vertues sure, wherein we most excell) Durst not adventure like to them? Melo. The Prince deserves a liberall choice of lives To ransome his; would mine would satisfie. Evan. How Melora? I cannot thinke thou dost So faintly love my happinesse, and my Renowne, to wish to hinder me of both. Melo. Alas, th'example is so good, I faine would follow it. Evan. But there is reason that I suffer first. I have a mourning weed within which thou Shalt dresse, and teach me weare, then so Apparelled like my cause, I'le walke to'th Duke. Melo. O leave me not behind, let me accompany Your mourning too, perhaps my death may be Accepted best, and you bee thought more fit to live. Evan. Thy inclinations have a noble sence, Thou shalt along; go, call thy brother in, And call aloud, this hollownesse is such He will not heare thee else. Mel. Hoa, Leonell? my brother Leonell. Enter Leonell Leo. Tis strange, this Prospero appeares not yet, Sure he is faint, and's aguish courage comes To him by fitts; what is your will? Evan. If thou dost love me Leonell (as thou Hast sworn, and with assertions most devout) I know there is no strict command I can Present, but thy obedience will performe. Leo. Bring me to triall straight, if I prove weake Or false, I am unworthy to appeare In the suns light, or evermore enjoy The better influence of your eyes. Evan. Give me confirm'd assurance on your knee That you will execute with reall faith, And punctuall circumstance, what I injone. Leo. Let me salute your hand, I breath on it my vow. Evan. Now Ile informe thee Leonell; the Prince And Prospero are both within the cave. Shut and inclos'd by us, where hourely thou Through a small slender wicket shall't convay Such food, as a disguised servant of The house (who heretofore provided our Reliefe) shal helpe thee to, take here this key And not permit their passage forth, till I Am gone t'ordaine by death their liberty Secure, which I will suffer to appease the angry Duke. Leon. Furies and Fiends cease on my sences straight; What have I promis'd in the rashnes of My dull and inconsiderate love? Evan. If thou dost break thy vow the curses of The Saints, and mine (which dying will not least Afflict thy perjury) fall on thy heart. Mel. Never be call'd my brother, nor assume. The honour of my valiant Fathers name. Evan. Melora come, we are too slow in such An act as will outlive all history. Ex. Evan. and Mel. Leon. O what a dull inhumane Lover am I grown! that simply by a forward and Unskilfull duty can consent the Queene And Lady of my life should be a Sacrifice To hinder others deaths? this sure is such A great example of a female fortitude As must undo all men, and blushing make Us steale from our unjust advancement ore The world; teare off our sawcy beards before The scatt'ring winds that give us the preheminence Of Sexe; when this is known let women sway. Counsels, and war, whilst feeble men obey. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. ScÃ¦na 1. Enter Calladine (in a night Gowne,) and a Servant. Cal. A Lady sayst thou in a mourning Vest? What should this earely visit meane, ere yet By full appearance of the Sun we can Distinguish day from night? Ser. Sir, she importunes much to speak with you, Saies her affaire asks secrecy and haste. Cal. Retire a while without, and set her in. Exit Ser. Enter Melora (in mourning) she unvailes, Since first my eyes had judgement to discerne A meane from excellence, they nere beheld A beauty so ore-coming and exact; What are the lov'd commands you'ld lay on me? I not remember that I ever saw A face I would more willingly obey, If it were civill too I'ld aske your name. Mel. Beleeve me gentle Sir when that is known You'l think me too unfortunate to live; I am call'd Evandra. Cal. Ha! the Princesse? wisely did Prospero Preserve thee from my sight, thy beauty is Too great and dangerous for youth to know. And be secure; though I nere saw her till This blessed houre, yet Fame assisted me T'imagine an Idea like her selfe; But why have you forsaken your conceal'd Aboad, and thus adventure into th'view Of men? I feare it is not safe. Mel. 'Tis to employ your vertue sir; I know You love the Prince, though not with so devout A heart as mine; for that I may restore Him unto liberty, and's Fathers love, I here present my selfe to cruell death. Cal. This is a valiant piety, a gratitude That shews her mind more noble than her shape; She is not known unto the Duke more than. By guessing Characters tane from report; She must not dye; though lately his commands Have singled my allegiance out, it is Religious sure to faile in this. Mel. Sir, expectation of the ills we must Endure do more perplex us than the paine It selfe. I crave you'ld not protract my sufferance. Cal. My thoughts have fashiond it unto my wish; Is there not a captive call'd Melora, (Most beautifull and young) that hath of late Familiar been to your society? Mel. I feare he hath discoverd me; D'you know the Lady sir? Cal. Only by Prospero's report, and I In charity desire her person safe; Your death alone will satisfie the Duke. Mel. My prayers have much endeavor'd that it may; And Sir t'assist your kind humanity Receive this key, 'twill give you entrance where She now remaines a prisoner by my art; It is a narrow Closset that ore-looks The Orchard grove; you know the house 'tis Prospero's. Cal. I am familiar there with all the vaults, And hidden passages. Mel. Sir, for regard of honour suffer not Her freedome from that place, till I am dead, For she's so much delighted with this cause, That with unwilling falshood I was faine To take advantage of her orizons, And whilst she kneeling lengthned her discourse With heaven, steale on this funerall habit, and In haste close up the dore to hinder her Pursute, where now she stays lamenting her Inforc'd secure estate, and envying of This danger which I chearefully embrace. Cal. My life shall warrant hers, be pleas'd to enter there, And stay till I informe the Duke of your appearance and approach. Melo. Most willingly; but still sir I implore your mercy would Secure that Lady, and the Prince, how ere The angry starrs provide for me. Cal. It is no lesse unkind t'importune than To doubt my care; there Lady, through that dooreâ Expect my sad returne will be too soone. Melo. Forgive me best Evandra, that I thus Assume thy name, and have beguil'd thee of So brave a death, the motive that perswades me to't Did not become thy knowledge nor my tongue. Exit Cal. This Princesse hath a soule I could adore Whilst it remaines eclips'd on earth, nor shall It yet reach heaven; both being utterly Vnknowne, will make the plot with easy help Succeed. Melora straight I will present T'appease the fury of the Duke, and then This Lady and the Prince are free; through blood Is the best issue of our hopes; if fate Ordaine it thus, I shall prove fortunate. Enter Frivolo, Tristan, Musitians, and Boy. Altesto. Come boy, lift up your voyce to yon bay window, Sing the Song I gave you last night, and firke Your fidles bravely too, beare up the burthen. Boy. No morning red, and blushing faire, be through your glass, or curtaines spyd, But cloudy gray, as the short hayre, of your old everlasting Bride. Chor. So old, so wondrous old, i'th nonage of Time, Ere Adam wore beard, she was in her Prime. Boy. Whose swarthy, dry'd westphalia hipps, are shrunk to mummie in her skin, Whose gummes are empty, and her lipps, like eyelids hairy and as thin. Chor. So old, so wondrous old, &amp;c. Boy. For Am'rous sighs which virgins use, she coughs aloud from lungs decayd, And with her palsey cannot chuse but shake, like th'trembling of a maid. Chor. So old, so wondrous old, &amp;c. Boy. And when her nightly labour swells, to vast extent, her pregnant wombe, Midwives believe, that it foretells, a hopefull Timpany to come. Chor. So old, so wondrous old, &amp;c. Boy.

Good morrow to the right worshipfull leader Captaine Vasco, And to's his right reverend Bride. Now gentlemen scrapers you may be gone. Ex. Musick. Enter Vasco (dressing himselfe.) Vas. My good friends, a certaine salt shower should have Season'd your feathers, had not my luck bin To marrie with one that consumes all her moysture In rhume, a meere Egyptian cloud for drowth. Altest. But why so soone abroad? Vasco are these A Bridegroomes howres? thou art as early up As creditors i'th Terme. Fri. Or Sergeants when The needy gallant meanes to steale a journey. Trist. And they prevent it by arresting his innocent horse. Vas. Businesse at Court; but Gentlemen this is A resurrection to me, beleev't I'm risen from the dead, from bones more dusty Than theirs that did begin their sleep beneath A marble Coverlet some thousand yeares ago. Enter Widow, and Lelia. Altest. 'Las poore Vasco! widdows can strangely mortifie. Wid. Put Dates and Amber in the Gruell Lelia, And let it boyle long. Lel. And shal I make the Poultice straight, and send Your other hood forsooth to be new lin'd? Wid. First stay till you have ript my velvet muffe, Ile have that lining serve. Vas. She's risen too; pure soule, Devotion and Aches keep her still waking. Wid. How do you Sir? we must comfort one another. Vas. There is need of't, no Marriner ere had A worse night in a storme. Altest. This usage Vasco wil hardly mollifie Her Iron chest, and make her bags open. Vas. Nay, I've tane order for her wealth if she Would be so courteous now to dy. Altest. Beleeve me, you'l find her very obstinate Touching that point; 'tis true, a woman that Had the least dramme of kindnesse or of reason Would for her husbands benefit depart This transitory at a minutes warning, Make a low courtsie, take her leave and dy, (She listens. With lesse noise than flies forsake us in a frost. Vas. I you speake of kind reasonable women, Alas she's of another mould; she'ld think't A strange request if I should urge it to her, Though it be evidently for my good. Fri. What is't for her to dye once? alas, She knows well she hath eight lives more to come. Altest. Frivolo saies right. I think Captaine 'twere fit You make a motion to her; see how 'twill worke. Vas. Never Gentlemen; if her own good nature Will not perswade her to't, let her e'ne live Till she be thought so much a Ghost, that the state Command her take a house in a Churchyard, And never walke but at midnight. Wid. What do they say Lelia? Lel. Forsooth devising for your worships good. Wid. Kind heart! me thinks you are not merry Sir. Vas. Who, I? as joviall as a condemn'd man I. Wid. Will you sit down and eat a little broth? Vas. I shall be cawdled like a Haberdashers wife That lies inn of her first child; but methinks Upon a stricter view you look not well, Your bloud absents it selfe, are you not faint? Altest. I, and her eyes shrinke, and retire into Their melancholly cells; your breath smells somewhat Of earth too, but 'tis nor much. Fri. By'r lady but take heed, my Grandam thus Was taken spinning at her wheele, and dy'd So quickly (as they say) as one would wish. Trist. I've seene a Coarse look better in a shrowd. If you have any businesse now with heaven 'Twere fit your prayers were short, for I much feare You'l not have breath enough to utter it. Wid. 'Tis more than I feele; look I so ill Lelia? Lel. As you were wont forsooth, most strange and uggly. Wid. Come, leade me in: pray husband do not grieve, Tis but a fit that ever takes me once In fifty yeares: but weepe not, 'twill away. Vos. Every teare shall be as big as a turnip When I weepe; the good pox comfort you, Wench Follow the game close, still breath death to her. Lel. Warrant you sir, I cannot do a better Deed than put her in mind still of her end. Exit Widow and Lelia. Vas. Marry a widow, and be coffind up VVith clouts and a skelliton? by this day, I lay last night lock'd in surgeons box; Compard unto her bed, a Pothecaries bing Is a Venetian cowch, and Canopie. Alte. Those that seek gold, must dig for it in mines. Vas. VVell my camp companions, what thinke you now O'th court? I'am sent for thither to take charge Of what is yet the moitie of a miracle. But you are all content to thrive, to jet And strut like lustfull Turkeys with your plumes spread. Altest. 'Tis not amisse; my good Lord Frivilo, I kisse your soft hands; noble sir keepe on Your Cordovan, I sweare your glove is a Preferment, 'bove the merit of my lips. Fri. You cherish my ambition sirâsignieur Tristan? your profess'd slave: I pray keepe on Your way, I'ld rather, build another wall Than to dishonor you by taking this. Trist. Beleeve it sir, both hands must be cut off Ere I mistake to place you neere the left. Vas. This practise will do well, follow apace, I must with speed to Caladine. Exeunt. Enter Evandra, Caladine. Evan. 'Tis strange, it seemes he knowes me not, and that The falsly, kind Melora weares my name He speakes as if her life he tendred more Than mine, 't is a mistake I faine would cherish Cal. I did not thinke the stock of nature could, In this her colder age, be rich enough To store the world with two such beauties that Together take their growth, and flourishing, And this unto my instant judgement seemes (If such amazeing formes admit of difference) The more exact, but that the blood &amp; stile Of Princess makes the other claime our reverence As well as love, and for Alvaro's sake, I wish I could procure that she might live. Evan. I have consider'd what you told me sir, And though the Princesse through a fond excesse Of love, would hasten a calamity That all the world must grieve and wonder at, Yet I could give her reason an excuse, For I my selfe to ease her sufferance Could willingly indure the fame. Cal. It ripens more, and swifter than my hopes Designe; you reach at an ambition Lady, So great and good, my wonder interrupts My language still, I cannot prais't enough. Can such a vertuous courage dwell in your sex? Evan. If you uprightly love her and the Prince, (Whose care she is) straight leade me to the Duke, And try how reall my professions are. Cal. Forgive the office you invite me to, Which by the hopes of my religion could My life excuse, I should esteem't too cheape An offering; this, Lady, is the fatall wayâ Evan. Melora, now my fortune is above Thy art, and I shall equall thee in love. Exeunt. Enter Duke (with Letters) Vasco, Altesto, Frivolo, Tristan, Attendants. Duke. Againe in low petitionarie stile He beggs me by these letters to release His daughter, and doth proffer summes so vaste To ransome her, as would orecome the covetous: But I have sent him such deniall, with Disdaine, as must distract and breake his heart. Vasco. yo've heard how ill I am obeyd By these perfum'd smooth traitors of the Court, And I have chosen you to show a duty Fitting the stricter discipline of warre, To actuate all my wil with instant diligence. Uas. You must injoyne me sir commands that are Most horrid, and unnaturall, when I Prove slow, or faint to execute. Duke. If these your officers and friends become Disloyall to your will, you may provide The rack and tortures to inforce em too't. Va. If their own appetites wil not perswade. There is small hope from punishment. Marke sir, that whey-fac'd fellow in the red, The Rack is his delight, and gives him as Much ease, as when he's stretch'd with lazinesse And a coole mornings sleepe. Duke. Is't possible! Vas. I've seene him suffer the Strapado thrice, Hang in this politique posture in the ayre, As he were studying to circumvent nature, And no sooner downe but calls for a wench. Duk. I know you have the skill to govern them. Be sure that Prospero's house be diggd untill The pinacles and the foundations meet. Vnlesse they deale by sorcery and charmes, I'le finde these buried lovers out, and my False sonne the Prince, that covets darkenes more Than blessed light, or my respect. Vas. I doe not like this businesse should concerne The Prince; although the rack be somewhat out Of season with my old bones, for his sake Enter Melora and Servant. I shall become a parcell traytor too. Mel. I feard that Caladine delaying his Returne so long, might frustrate all my glory; And how Evandra's skill might worke with him Was dangerous. I doe not see her here. Ser. Pray heaven my Master do not check my forwardness T'obey your will; he meant you should keepe home. Melo. My presence here will make his benefit; I told thee so before; trust my excuse in thy behalfe. Duk. What Ladye's that? Melo. One that to pleasure you with a revenge, Present my selfe to execution, with As liberall ioy, as to the marriage priest. And when I name my selfe Evandra, you Will know enough to satisfie your wrath. Duke. Is the belov'd Bird flown from the darke cage? Their magick was not strong enough to hinder destinie, And you will find small am'rous pitty in My frozen age. My guard ceaze on her straight. Enter a Guard, and bind her. Altest. Vasco, this is Melora my prisoner? Vas. Peace Devill, peace, thou wilt destroy brave mysteries. A noble girle; I conceive all; now would My gratious widow be burnt to char-coale Ere she had braine, or nature for a plot Like this; I could eat her, and her cloathes too, By this hand, her very shooes were a rare messe. Melo. Yf you expect to find me here a lowly sutor, Tis but to hasten sir your glad content With a dispatch upon my life, and that The Prince may be aton'd unto your love. Duke. Her spirit seemes to stir my manhood more Than it astonisheth my sence. I am Resolv'd to farther your desires (brave dame) With all the helpe of cruelty and haste. Enter Caladine and Evandra. Cal. Death slave, what make you here? the Princesse too? Why did you give her liberty? Serv. She told me sir, it was with your consent. Cal. She hath ore 'reach'd my skill, I am undone. Duke. Stay Caladine, another prize? come back And render me that Ladies name. Evan. He knows it not; my name's Evandra sir. Mel. I feare I am depriv'd of my intent. Duke. We must to Delphos sure t'untie these doubts And wonders with an Oracle. Evan. Do not beleeve that Lady sir, she hath Beguil'd me of my name, and is so sick And fond with an improper love, she would Betray her self unto a paine; she knows Not how to merit nor endure like me. Mel. O Sir, I find her language is most apt And powerfull to perswade, but let your faith Consider my affections too. Evan. Why dost thou let thy kindnesse wrong we thus, Undoing thy Religion with thy love? Mel. 'Tis you confer the Injury, that will Not suffer me to dye in peace. Vas. Rare wenches both; all this is for the Prince. Duke. Though small inquiry would discover soone Who justifies the truth, yet I will end The difference so as shall afford you equall joy, And not endanger a mistake in me; Convey them to the Fort, they shall both die. (The Guard laies hold on them. Vas. Hath this Duke buried all his goodnesse in's Reverge? sure he is libd, he hath certainely No masculine businesse about him. Duke. Lead them away. Cal. Ile follow too, and mourne the obsequy Ere ceremonious death make it compleat. Mel. Forgive this emulation (Madam) you Shall know a cause that will invite you to't. Evand. Poor Melora! I pitty not my self but thee (Exeunt Cal. Evand. Mel. and Guard. Duke. Now let my Son, and's Minion Prospero (Rebellious as himself) resign to th'Fiends Their dark and hidden tenements again, Come forth free and secure, for since they valued death As a delight they shall not suffer it; Go straite proclame their next appearance safe, For it wil pleasure me they should stand by To see, and not be able to resist, the justice of revenge. Vas. Sure revenge is a strange kind of Lechery; How it hath alterd him! Duke. Vasco, now the inchanted house may stand; But be you here to morrow with some strength To guard their execution from impediments Of rage, or pitty; they shall suffer early. Exit. Vas. I thank your grace for any employment. Altesto, art thou a rogue? Altest. A little (Sir) infected with your company. Vas. Art thou so very a rogue, if I command. Thee from the Duke, to cut off these Ladies heads, Thou'lt whet the Axe thy self, and do't with the Dexterity of a Flemming? Altest. I will see thy head in a leatherne case first, Kickt in a footbal match from gole to gole. Vas. Why I thank thee; what say you Frivolo, Wenches and Surgeons have cost you deare, Have you remorse enough to do't? Fri. I've a mind rather to rebell, break shops Open, and make choice of my silks, without Taking notice (sir) of the Mercers book. Trist. Such wholsome businesse would more take me too Than cutting off poore Ladies heads, unless Your faire widow (Vasco) come in my reach, I could behead her for her left eare-ring, Though it be but an Agat set in Copper. Vas. Come let's to bed; the Sun to morrow will Rise black, or I shall think him a dull insensible Planet and deserves no more adoration than a farthing candle. Exeunt. Enter Leonell, Alvaro, Prospero. Leon. Sir, you have heard how she betraid me to A Vow, and with what cruell menacings My Sister and her self petitiond heaven T'assist their curses in a punishment Upon my after-life, if I were perjur'd by A breach of what my promise did assure. Alva. It was a vow no lesse unkind than rare, T'imprison us that had no cause nor will To do a noble stranger injury; But I have learnt a tame Philosophy, Perswades me to forgive all but my selfe. Pro. How comes the date of your strict vow expir'd, And that you now afford us liberty? Which if my memory be just, you said She did enjoyne you should not be, ere she Was gone to suffer death. Leon. Sir, she is gone, my Sister too; one that Attends by your command these hidden walks In breathlesse haste just now distill'd the poisonous news Through my sick eare. Alva. Gone? and to dye? adorn'd (Me thinks) like to an ancient sacrifice With flowers, which are not sure the issue of The spring, but of her beauty, and her breath. Pro. Would I had patience to endure calamities Like this! but I'm forbid by my galld heart; Why did you keep us limited and lockt I'th Cave when we had power to hinder her Departure, and her death? 'twas a bold crime. Leon. Sir, I have hope I gaind your pardon when I mention'd the misfortune of my vow. Pro. I understand not such injurious vows: Thou lov'dst her Leonel, and through the pride Of envy couldst not yeeld, since thy own hopes Grew faint, that mine should ere be prosperous; Therefore with cunning willingnesse endur'd Her desp'rate sally to the Duke. Leon. That I did love her sir is a most true And fitting glory to proclame; but that I'm guilty of so base a slander as Your rashness hath devis'd provokes me to A rage that may prove dangerous: reclame Your thoughts, and teach them more civility. Pro. The Prince grows solemne with his griefe, lest we Disturbe him let's retire aside, and Ile Whisper such reasons to thee as shall want No courage to be truths, though they inflame. (They walke aside. Alva. Fountaines that ever weep have in their teares Some benefit, they coole the parched earth, And cherish a perpetuall growth; the sad Arabian tree that still in Baulmy drops Dissolves her life, doth yield for others help A medicine in those teares: but triviall man Though he hath sence to mourne, may weep and melt His injur'd eyes to viewlesse aire, yet all Th'expence affords is vainely to discerne His mourning gives his sorrows life, and length, But not the guiltlesse cause a remedy. (lies down. Leon. My Lord, I stayd upon the garden Mount, And in the heate of my impatience was So kind, much to lament your tardinesse; But now I must have leave to think one that Delights to heape up wrongs, hath fury more To dare than do. Pro. Were this a Temple, and the Prince Imploy'd i'th rev'rend businesse of a Priest, I could not suffer such a boast from one That I have us'd with so much clemency In fightâdefend thy life, or it is mine. (They draw and fight) Leon. Are you so masterlyâagainâI find No lightning in your eyes, nor in your sword. Pros. You have the skill, but I'le distemper itâ Alva. Hold, hold, eager and silly ministers Of wrath, is this a time to bleed, when ere The morning sun uncloud his pensive face, There will bee streames of blood let out enough To make him drinke till he be sick with sacrifice? Give me thy sword. How Prospero? are my Commands grown wearisome and coldâ Pros. There sirâI'm still rebuk'd like to a boy. Alva. How long shall I direct thy temper to A gentle and a soft demeane ere thou Grow wise, and milde Enough to governe it? Let me intreat you sir, to sheath your weapon too. Leo. Sir, you are worthy to command; and know I weare it for my guard, not insolence. Pros. I am appointed all my actions still, As my stupiditie made me not fit To know, but suffer injuries. Alva. Why dost thou frowne? the sullen wrinckles on A lyons brow carry a grace, 'cause they Become a beast, but he that can discerne The nobleness of valor should be smooth As Virgins in their bridall ornaments. Pros. Sir, I am taught; how ere my sences are Not so mistaken and so weake, but that They know him false; he lov'd Evandra. Alva. Is that a crime? thou told'st me in the cave Thou lov'dst her too. Pros. I nere durst tell you so, Till you discern'd my passions, and inforc'd A true discoverie of their hidden cause. Alva. But I esteem'd it for a vertue knowne, And it indeerd thee more to my respect. Pray tell me sir, did you love Evandra? And with a heart sincere as she deserv'd? Leon. Sir, the confession may be honour, but No shame I did, and with a fervencie Vpright as my Religion could produce. Alva. O what a prompt and warme delight I feele When others reason are inclin'd unto My choyce? 'tis strange the sencelesse world should so Mistake the privilege of love, the best Of objects! heaven affects plurallitie Of worshipers, t'adore and serve, whilst we In that chiefe hope are glad of Rivalship; And why should Ladies then that imitate The upper beauty most to mortall view, Be barr'd a numerous adresse? or we Envie each others lawfull, though ambitious aime? Come, joyne your hands, and seale a friendship here, Good as inviolate, lasting as truth. Leo. You give my wishes sir, a full content. Pros. I want the skill to promise sir, but Ile Performe all your desires with noble faith. Alva. And now let me imbrace you both, for we Are lovers all, though when the morne must rise To see and blush at th'actions of the world, Like sad distressed Turtles we shall want Our mate, then we may sit and mourne beneath The willow that ore'shaddowes every brook, There weepe, till we are vanisht quite in teares T'increase the streame, whose senceless murmurings Will be excus'd hereafter in our cause. Pros. O that my heart would be the officer Of death unto it selfe, and breake without My irreligious helpe; my life is tir'd. Leo. And I have thoughts so wild, so much unsafe, They would be sinne in utterance, as in act. Alva. Give me your hands; with a slow fun'rall pace Weel move, to see this dismall Tragedie. Let's beare it bravely, like such lovers as Have reason can perswade their courage to Attempt things bold and fit; whil'st there was hope, We cherish'd it with proffer of our lives, But now the strength of Armies cannot free Her from my fathers wrath; nay, hand in handâ To shew this truth in loves Philosophy, That as one object equally allures Th'ambition of our hope, so we not interchange Malignant thoughts; but sev'rall lovers, like Strange Rivers that to the same Ocean trace, Do when their torrents meet, curle and embrace. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. ScÃ¦na. 1. Enten 2 Embassadours with letters, Caladine, Vasco, Altesto, Frivolo. Cal. Your Letters merit to have power on my Respect and diligence; I shall afford You both; but when I bring you to the Duke 'Tis to be fear'd you'l find the privilege Of all my favor there is lost. 1 Emb. Accesse and audience Sir is all our hopes Presume to get, the times befriend us not. 2 Emb. We had swift notice of these Ladies danger; And Sir, how ere it prove, your wishes must Oblige us to a lasting gratitude. Altest. What are these strangers Vasco, that envy Our sleep, and wake us before day? Vas. Embassadors from Millaine, whose hopes want Some cordiall water, for they'r very sick. Cal. Vasco, it is the Dukes command that you Assemble straight some strength from the cast Regiments To guard the Pallace yard. Vas. What need it Sir? to my knowledge the two Ladies have no Other weapons than Bodkins, and their nailes Closse par'd; besides, a thread of Eglantine, Or a small woodbine stalke, will fetter them As fast as Cables of a Galley-grosse. Cal. I but deliver what I had in charge. My Lords Embassadors this is your way. 1 Emb. These preparations are severe; I doubt His mind will not be easily reclaim'd. 2 Emb. You see the gen'rous people like it not. Exeunt. Emb. and Cal. Vas. Altesto, go and muster up from all The Lanes and Alleys in the Town a troop Of fine fleet rogues, such as will turne their backs To a bullet and outrun it, yet love Commotion too, I would have such Altesto, Fri. Let me furnish you; hell shall not yeeld a Regiment Of Fiends that will be more invisible At the approach of Justice or Religion. Altest. O for a tiny short truss'd Baker that I knew; A Carman too, that dy'd some three Months since with eating meazled porke; they would Have march'd to such a war with cowlestaffe and Batoone like Hercules. Enter Tristan (leading the Widow) and Lelia. Vas. How now? whither move you so fast, like a Fleet snaile over a cabidge leaf, so early too? She sleeps lesse than carriers, traytors, or Madmen. Tri. She requests me to be the staffe of her age. Vas. But whither I pray? Wid. Why sir, to see the shew. Vas. The shew! the motion of Queene Guinivers death Acted by puppets would please you as well; The Jade too is as full of remorse as A Beare that wants his supper. Wid. I would have a safe place, where I may stand And weep without having my handkerchiefe Stolne away. Lel. It is of pure Cambrick forsooth, And made of her Grandmothers wedding Apron. Wid. Yes truly, and wrought when I was a maid. Altest. That's an antiquity beyond all record. Vas. Sirra Tristan, be you sure you avoid No throng; a croud well shuffled, and close pack'd, May do now a speciall courtesie; Let her be squeez'd, for she's as rotten as A hollow tree that stands without a root. Trist. My shoulder shall help too at a dead lift. Fri. A Scaffold that were weakly built would serve. Wid. VVe must make haste; farewell Lambe. Exeunt. Trist. Wid. Lel. Vas. Lambe, which my own translation renders calfe. Altest. 'Twill be long ere thou grow up to a bull: For few will venter to help thee to hornes. Vas. VVell Gentlemen pitty my case, I have Endur'd another night would tire a Perdu, More than a wet furrow and a great frost. Fri. VVill she not dye? Vas. I have perswaded her, but still in vaine; And all the help the Laws afford us poore Mistaken men, that marry gold instead Of flesh, is a divorse, it must be thought On suddenly; Altesto, haste to your charge. Altest. Good morrow Cavaliers. Vas. 'Twill be an houre yet before that greeting Be in season; pray heaven Tristan remember the crowd. Exeunt. Enter Alvaro, Prospero, Leonel, and Boy (to sing.) Alva. This glorious hazzard in thy sister (Leonel) Doth equally perplex my sufferance With what the faire Evandra must endure. Leo. You now have heard the chearefull Art she us'd To be the first that should confirme her love With prostitution of her virgin life. Alva. But why for me? how poore they make me now, That have betray'd me to a debt the wealth Of Saints (that are in kindnesse ever rich) Is not of able value to discharge; I love them both with equall flame, and I Distinguish neithers beauty when compar'd; 'Tis vertue and remorce give Ladies eminence In the severe discretion of my heart. Pro. I want the wisdome how to love; but I Am sure I find I love, and 'tis too much. Alva. Come sing; would musick had the power to give A life, as it hath had to move things dead. Song. O draw your Curtaines and appeare, Ere long, like sparkes that upward flie, We can but vainly say you were, So soon you'l vanish from the eye. And in what Star we both shall find (For sure you can't divided be) Is not to Lovers Art assign'd, 'Twill puzzle wise Astrology. Enter Evandra, and Melora, above. Evan. Who is it that assumes the office of The dying Swan? all Musick now (me thinks) Is obsequy, and he that sings should sing his death. Mel. The gentle and most valiant Prince, bold Prospero. Evan. And there behold the faithfull Leonell. Leon. O pardon me that I have kept my vow. Evan. Brave youth! I prize thy truth great as thy love; We now are mark'd here, and inclos'd for death, So you have all a blessed liberty. Alva. A liberty? we are more bound than slaves unto Th'unwieldy oare; like harness'd cattell in A Teeme, we draw a load of sorrow after us That tires our strength. Evan. There was no way but this To keep you still among the living, who Before endeavour'd nobly to procure Our freedome with your deaths; do not repine At destiny, all remedy is past. Alva. A fatall truth; for we but now dejected on our knees Did wooe my Fathers mercy, and in vaine. Mel. Then strive not by untimely rage to help And further our impossible release With certaine hazzard of your selves; our last Sute is, we may begin our willing death As quietly as undisturbed sleep. Evan. The silly crime of envy which unlearn'd And haughty Lovers use, I shall prevent; You'l want the object now, that makes you interchange The vext remembrance of each others claime. Alva. Were you to live we could not share that guilt; Though number make us three, wise love hath given Us all one peacefull heart. Evan. O Melora! were it but timely now To wish continuance of mortality, Like them, we should not differ though the same One virtue were our mutuall hope and choice; But you should chide her sir, for she hath lov'd Your happinesse too much, vainely to lose Her life when mine would satisfie. Alva. Why Melora didst thou undo my soule VVith so strange courtesie? but why did you Evandra? stay, o stay, leave us not yet. Evan. The Guard are entred here, and now the last And shortest of our houres is come; farewell Brave Prince; brave Leonell farewell; farewell brave Prospero. Mel. The gentle valiant Prince Farewell; and valiant Leonell farewell; Farewell the hardy Prospero. Ex. from above. Leon. and Pro. draw their swords. Alva. Nay, stir not Gentlemen, it is in vaine, They are beyond all humane help; would you Scale heaven, and coole the sawcy Sun with your Fraile breath when he doth scorch you with his beames? For such is now the enterprise that strives To rescue them from this high Fort. Leon. Would I were in a Cannon charg'd, then straight Shot out to batter it, and be no more. Pro. Would all the stones might be ordain'd my food Till I could eat their passage out. Alva. These angry exaltations shew but poore. Pro. Sir, whither shall we go? Alva. To see them dye; but not like vaine and colerick boyes, to shew A fury that can hazzard none but our Disdained swords; yet still my worthy friends There is an undertaking left, and such As valiant lovers may performe; why should The base and durty Guard be honour'd with Our opposition or our bloud? have we Not griefe enough to dye without their help? Let us with fix'd and watry eyes behold These Ladies suffer, but with silence still, Calmely like pinion'd doves, and when we see The fatall stroak is given, swell up our sad And injur'd hearts untill they break. Leon. I do not find my self unapt for this. Pro. My breast containes an angry lump that is Too stubborne for a quiet bravery; He that shall strike Evandras life shall feele Me till he sink low as the hollownesse where Devills dwell. Alva. This way; let us avoid the gazing multitude. Exeunt. Enter Duke, Caladine, Vasco, 2 Embassadors, and Attendants. Du. Have you unto your Officers given charge To guard the passage from the Fort unto The Pallace yard with bold well-govern'd men? Vas. All is directed Sir as you command; But for their government, if it be to be had In prisons, galleys, or stews, you may Trust them with a mutiny. Cal. His resolution's fi'xd, and there remaines No comfortable signe to flatter hope. Du. My Lords Embassadors sit down; and though You now behold a Prince that rather loves To be thought cruell than to break his vow, Do not beleeve to be severely just Is tyranny; you shall have faire admittance, Yet your request unkindly ought to be Deny'd; and though your Master (when the chance Of war rendred my brother in his power) Stole in the dark his noble life, and durst Not give the wrathfull act a gen'rall view; I'm not asham'd to publish my revenge, It shall be openly perform'd, to shew I not suspect mens censure or dislike. 1 Emb. Sir, he that ministers revenge may hurt And damage others, but can bring no good Or reall profit to himselfe. 2 Emb. And with your Highnesse leave, we think it were More wise to mulct our Masters treasure, which Shall be exhausted freely to your own Proportion and content, so you will take His Daughter and her lov'd companion from The danger of this day. Enter Evandra, Melora, Guard, at one doore: Alvaro, Prospero, Leonell, at the other. Du. I will not sell my brothers bloud; The prisoners approach; make roome; ere long They shall enjoy the liberty of soules; Vasco, lend me thine eare. (whispers. Alva. How beautifull is sorrow when it dwells Within these Ladies eyes? so comely, that it makes Felicity in others seeme deform'd. I wish my patience may be strong enough. Leon. I now begin to doubt I am not fit To see their hazard and indur't. Pro. Nor I; my loyalty already's stird Beyond the temp'rate suff'rance of a man. Du. Thou seest the Prince weares tremble in his locks; Though any opposition he can make Be but impertinent and weak, yet charge Thy Officers, if he endeavor to Disturbe my will, imprison him i'th Fort. Vas. I shall observe him Sir; I do not like This employment; the Prince will find no Enemies in all my tribe. Du. If you have any words from Millaine that Imports their knowledge, ere they dye, be briefe My Lords Embassadors; I give you leave To whisper your affaire, or if you please, To make it publique to the world. 1 Emb. Your cruell resolutions sir, have so Confin'd our liberality, that all We shall deliver to Evandra now Is but her Fathers and her Countries teares, And those we can by deputation pay To the indang'ring of our eyes. 2 Emb. And to Melora, that in kindnesse thus Hath shar'd her destiny, we do confer The worlds eternall wonder and applause. Evan. It will deprive me of some joy in death, to think My Father needs must suffer by a vaine Unprofitable griefe, and 'tis the last Request I make, that he would wisely now Forget my obsequies and name. Mel. And my desires make sure, that those who shall Hereafter write the businesse of this day May not beleeve I suffer for the hope Of glorious Fame, but for a secret in my hidden love. 1 Emb. Question your justice Sir, must they both dye? Du. Both; and I think my payment is but short, When I consider well the measure of My brothers worth, with their unvalu'd Sex, And wish some man that boasts your masters bloud Were fingly here to undergoe their fate, It would more pleasure my revenge, but since There is no hope in that desire, away, lead them to death. Leon. Stay Sir, reprieve them but one minutes space Untill you heare a stranger speake. Alva. What meanes this noble youth? Du. Be sudden in thy speech, for my revenge brooks no delay. Leon. If I produce a man ally'd unto this Family you so abhor, Great as your selfe in title and descent, Will you with solemne vow confirme their liberty, And take his life to satisfie your wrath? Du. By th'honour of a Princes faith I wil; And such a miracle would ravish me. Leon. I dare beleeve your vow, you were so just Though cruell in your last, and know my joyes Must take the privilege to boast you now Have lost the power to make them dye. Duk. It shall be wonderfull if that prove true. Leo. I am not Leonell the Millaine Knight, But Leonell the Duke of Parmas Son, Heire to his fortune and his fame. Evan. O Melora! thy brother will reveale Himselfe and quite undoe our glorious strife. Leo. By this you find I am to Millaine neer Ally'd; but more to tempt your fury on My life, know 'twas my valiant Father took Your brother prisoner, and presented him Where he receiv'd his death; my Father that So oft hath humbled you in war, and made His victories triumph almost upon The ruines of your State. Alva. So young, and fill'd with thoughts so excellent, That they surprise my wonder more than love! Well mayest thou worship, Prospero, but darst not envy him. Pro. B'ing your Disciple Sir, I'm better taught; but 'tis no crime to wish Fortune had made me Heire of Parma and Not him, then I had dy'd for them. Vas. This is some comfort yet; I'm for the Ladies. Cal. But 'thath not given our sorrows a full cure. Du. Sir you are boldest with your selfe; but you Shall see I need no provocation to Observe my vow; unbind the Ladies there, And beare him straight to death. 1 Emb. Stay Sir, he must not dye. Du. How? age and griefe makes thee a foole, and mad. 1 Em. He must not Sir, if your revenge be wise, And fix your anger where 'tis most deserv'd; (Takes off a false beard. Behold Millaine himselfe your Enemy; Live princely youth, and let my yeares (which time Would soone determine) be the ransome of My chiefest bloud; Evandra do not weep. Evan. O Sir, there was lesse use of me; why would You with this danger on your selfe destroy That noble fame I vertuously pursu'd? Mel. Our hope of endlesse glory now is lost. Alva. Sure heaven intends more blessings to this day. Du. I have atchiev'd my wishes in full height; This was a justice sir, more than I could Expect from my own Stars; free Leonell And let him suffer the prepared stroake. 2 Emb. First heare me speak, and sir how ever you'l Interpret the discretion of my words I am resolv'd he shall not dye, nor none Of these, though all in your command and power. Vas. Say'st thou so old Shaver? make but that good, The maids of Savoy shall everlastingly Pay thee tribute in dainty gloves and Nose-gays To stick in thy girdle. Du. This were a mystery would please indeed. 2 Emb. Look on me well: I am your brother Sir; (Pulls off a false beard.) And though ten yeares I have been hidden from Your sight, this noble Duke hath us'd me so, I cannot call it banishment, but the Retir'd and quiet happinesse of life. Alva. How wisely have the heavens contriv'd this joy! 1 Emb. And though his fortune in the war, which made Your Armies ever flourish with successe, Taught me prevent my Countries ruine by Detaining him from your employment there, Yet he enjoy'd all the delights that solitude Affords: and when he chose his happinesse In Books and deep Discourses of the learn'd, I search'd the most remote and knowing world For men to furnish his desires. 2 Emb. It is acknowledg'd sir, and with a bounteous thanks. Duk. How welcome are these miracles? let me Embrace thee as the greatest joy that since My birth I have receiv'd. O my lov'd brother, Thou see'st though absent I've been faithfull to Thy vertues, and thy memorie. 2. Emb. But sir, too strict a master of your vow; Yet tis a fault my gratitude should more Admire with thankfulnesse, than chide. Duk. This happy day deserves a place supreme And eminent i'th Kallander. 2. Emb. First I will give into your courteous armes The Duke of Millaine sir, good &amp; renoun'd; And now the bold and princely Leonell, Then Alvaro my honourd nephew that Deserves the best of humane praise and love.

He shall bee cherish'd and his faults forgiven. Pros. I shall deserve it sir in future deeds Of honour, and of loyall faith; how I Am rap'd to see those wonders strangely thrive? Vas. What thinke you of the starrs now Caladine? Doe these small twinkling Gentlewomen Looke to their business well? have they a care of us? Cal. It is beyond our merit or our hope. Vas. Ile buy me an optick, study Astrologie, And visit e'm ev'ry faire night ore my house leds. Duk. The chiefest happiness of virtue is Th'increase, which to procure, with Hymens help Wee'l knit, and intermingle lovers hearts. Come my Alvaro, Ile bestow thee straight. Melo. A little patience sir, and heare me speake Before you give what lawfully is mine. Duk. Indeed thou dost deserve him by thy love. Mel. In love Evandras interest justly Doth equall mine, but I appeale unto His vow, which sure her goodnesse will assist. Alva. And my religion shall perswade me keepe; But where (Melora) was it made? Melo. Within my fathers court, when five yeares since (Disguis'd you stole to see a triumph there) You promis'd if our houses enmity VVere ever reconcil'd, the church should joyne our hands. Leon. Sir, VVhat my sister speakes I'm witnesse to, And hope this day shall end our parents strife In a kinde peace. Duk. VVhich thus I doe confirme; Take him Melora, with him all the joyes Thy virtues or our prayers can procure. Alva. Didst thou for this with kind Evandra strive VVho should encounter danger first? although Thy beauty's chang'd, it is not lost; I now Remember thee, and my vowes prophecie. Embrace. 1. Emb. Now my best Evandra give me thy hand; And heare receive it valiant Leonell; That I may ratifie the faith I gave, If ere this war expir'd she should be thine. Duke. Then hee may challenge present interest, For we may meet to heare voyces and lutes, But never more the angry Drum. Evan. Alvaro's virtues sir, and yours, have both An equall claim; persons I nere admir'd So much to make a difference in my choyce; Therefore my fathers promise, and my love Have made me yours. Leon. I am orecharg'd with my felicitie. Alv. To Evandra, gladness be stil renew'd, VVho since I see so worthily bestow'd, My love is quieted in everlasting rest. Evan.

(Vasco takes Millaine aside. Vas. I'm bold to crave acquaintance with your grace, And to begin it with a sute. 1 Emb. It shall be granted Sir. Vas. I have married your Graces Country-woman, And was a little (sir) mistaken in her age, Would you'ld procure us a divorce. 1 Emb. If you can make't appeare she is too old. Vas. She writes a hundred and ten (Sir) next grasse. 1 Emb. 'Tis a faire age; well Sir, you shal have a divorce, And what the profits of her dowry would Have been, I will my selfe bestow on you. Vas. Such another good day makes us all mad. Du.

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE But that the Tyran custome bears such sway, We would present no Prologue to our Play, Since we have learn'd in Prologues all the scope It with weak words to strengthen weaker hope, When with sad solemn phrase we court each eare Not to observe, but pardon what you heare: Or if there were but one so strangely wise Whose judgement strives to please, and trust his eyes, Him at an easie charge we could provoke To a kind doome with this grave long old cloak. Now for the over-subtle few, who raise Themselves a triviall fame by a dispraise, Our bold opinion is, they may descry Some easie wit, but much more cruelty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Troth Gentlemen you must vouchsafe a while T'excuse my mirth, I cannot chuse but smile, And 'tis to think, how like a subtle spy Our Poet waits below to heare his destiny; Just in the Entry as you passe, the place Where first you mention your dislike or grace: Pray whisper softly that he may not heare, Or else such words as shall not blast his eare.</field>
