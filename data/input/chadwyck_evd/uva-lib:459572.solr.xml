      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue entreth. Agathon he whose counsail wise, to princes wele ext?ded: by good aduice vnto a Prince iij. things he hath c?mended First, is that he hath gouernment and ruleth ouer men: Secondly, to rule with lawes, eke Iustice (saith he) then. Thirdly, that he must wel conceiue, he may not alwaies reign: Lo, thus the rule vnto a Prince, Agathon squared plaine. Tully the wise whose sapience, in volumes great dooth tel: Who in wisdome, in that time did many men excel. A Prince (saith he) is of him self, a plain and speaking law: The law, a Schoole maister deuine, this by his rule I draw. The sage and witty Seneca, his woords therto did frame: The honest exercise of Kings, men wil insue the same. But contrary wise if that a King, abuse his kingly seat: His ignomy and bitter shame, in fine shalbe more great. In Percia there reignd a king, who Cirus hight by name: Who did deserue as I doo read, the lasting blast of Fame. But he, when sisters three had wrought, to shere his vitall thred: As heire due to take the crown, Cambices did proceed. He in his youth was trained vp, by trace of vertues lore: Yet (beeing king) did clene forget, his perfect race before. Then cleuing more vnto his wil such vice did immitate: As one of Icarus his kinde, forwarning then did hate. Thinking that none could him dismay, ne none his fact? could see Yet at the last a fall he took, like Icarus to bee. Els as the fish which oft had take, the pleasant bait from hook: In safe did spring &amp; pearce the stremes wh? fisher fast did looke. To hoist vp from the watry waues, vnto the dryed land: Then scaept, at last by suttle baight, come to the fishers hand. Eu? so this king Cambices heer, when he had wrought his wil: Taking delight the Innocent, his giltlesse blood to spil. Then mightie Ioue would not permit, to procecute offence: But what measure ye king did meat, ye same did Ioue c?mence. To bring to end wt shame his race, two yeeres he did not reign: His crueltie we wil dilate, and make the matter plain. Crauing that this may suffise now, your patience to win: I take my way, beholde I see, the players comming in. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First enter Cambises the King, Knight and Councellor. Cambises. My Counsaile graue &amp; sapient with lords of legal train: Attentiue eares towards bend &amp; mark what shalbe sain. So you likewise my vali?t knight whose m?ly acts doth fly By brute of fame ye sounding trump dooth perse ye azure sky. My sapient woords I say perpend and so your skil delate: You knowe that Mors vanquished hath Cirus that king of state And I by due inheritance possesse that Princely crown: Ruling by swoord of mightie force in place of great renown. You knowe and often haue heard tel my fathers worthy facts: A manly Marsis hart he bare appeering by his acts. And what? shall I to ground let fall my fathers golden praise? No, no, I meane for to attempt, this fame more large to raise, In that that I his sonne succeed his kingly seat as due: Extend your councel vnto me in that I aske of you. I am the king of Persia, a large and fertil soil: The Egiptians against vs repugne, as verlets slaue and vile. Therfore I meane wt Marsis hart, with warres th? to frequent Them to subdue as captiues mine this is my harts intent. So shall I win honors delight, and praise of me shall go: My Councel speak, and Lordings eke, is it not best doo so? Councel. Oh pusant king, your blisful woord?, deserues abundant praise That you in this doo go about, your fathers fame to raise. Oh blisful day that king so yung, such profit should conceiue: His fathers praise &amp; his to win, from those that would deceiue. Sure my true and souerain king, I fall before you prest: Answere to giue as duty mine, in that your grace request. If that your hart adicted be, the Egiptians to conuince: Through Marsis aid the c?quest wun, then deed of happy prince Shall pearce the skyes vnto the throne of the supernall seat: And merit there a iust rewarde, of Iupiter the great. But then your grace must not turn back, from this pretenced wil For to proceed in vertuous life, imploy indeuour stil. Extinguish vice, and in that cup, to drink haue no delight. To martiall feats and kingly sporte, fix all your whole delight. King. My Councel graue a thousand thanks, with hart I doo you render That you my case so prosperouse, intierly doo tender. I wil not swarue fr? those your steps, wherto you wold me tra?: But now my Lord &amp; vali?t knight, wt woord? giue answer plain Are you content with me to go, the Marsis games to try? Lord, Yea peerlesse Prince to aid your grace, my self wil liue and dye. Knight. And I for my habilitie, for feare wil not turn back: But as the ship against the rocks, sustain and bide the wrack. King. Oh willing harts, a thousand thanks I render vnto you: Strik vp your drummes wt courage great, we wil march foorth euen now. Councel. Permit (O king) few woords to heer, my duty serues no lesse: Therfore giue leaue to councel thine, his minde for to expresse. King. Speake on my Councel what it be, you shall haue fauour mine Councel. Then wil I speake vnto your grace, as duty dooth me binde. Your grace dooth meane for to attempt of war the manly art: Your grace therin may hap receiue with others for your parte, The dent of death in those affaires, all persons are alike: The hart couragious often times, his detryment dooth seek. Its best therfore for to permit, a Ruler of your land: To sit and iudge with equitie, when things of right are scand. King. My grace dooth yeeld to this your talk, tobe thus now it shall: My Knight therfore prepare your self, Sisamnes for to call. A Iudge he is of prudent skil, euen he shall beare the sway: In absence mine, when from the land I doo departe my way. knight. Your Knight befor your grace eu? heer, him self hath redy prest: With willing hart for to fulfil as your grace made request. Exit. Councel. Pleaseth your grace I iudge of him to be a man right fit: For he is learned in the Law hauing the gift of wit. In your graces presinct, I doo not view for it a meeter man: His learning is of good effect. bring proof therof I can. I doo not knowe what is his life, his conscience hid from me: I dout not but the feare of God, before his eyes to be. Lord. Reporte declares, he is a man that to himself is nye: One that fauoureth much the world, and to much sets therby. But this I say of certaintie, if he your grace succeed: In your absence but for a while, he wil be warnd indeed: No iniustice for to frequent, no partiall Iudge to prooue: But rule all things with equitie, to win your graces looue. King. Of that he shall a warning haue, my heasts for to obay: Great punishment for his offence against him wil I lay. Councel. Beholde I see him now agresse and enter into place: Sisamnes. Oh puisant Prince &amp; mightie king, ye gods preserue your grace. Your graces message came to me, your wil purporting foorth: With grateful minde I it receiued, according to mine othe. Erecting then my self with speed, before your graces eyes: The tenor of your Princely wil, from you for to agnise. King. Sisamnes, this the whole effect, the which for you I sent: Our minde it is to eleuate, you to great preferment My grace and gratious co?cel eke hath chose you for this cause: In iudgment you doo office beare, which haue the skil in lawes, We think that you accordingly, by Iustice rule wil deale: that for offence none shall haue cause (of wr?g) you to appeale. Sisamnes. Abundant thanks vnto your grace for this benignitie: To you his councel in like case, with Lords of clemency. What so your grace to me permits, if I therin offend: Such execution then commence, and vse it to this end. That all other (by that my deed) example so may take: To admonish them to flee the same, by fear it may them make. King. Then according to your woords, if you therin offend: I assure you euen from my brest, correction shall extend. From Persia I meane to go into the Egipt land: Them to conuince by force of armes, and win the vpper hand. While I therfore absent shalbe, I doo you ful permit: As gouernour in this my right, in that estate to sit. For to detect and eke correct, those that abuse my grace: This is the totall of my wil, giue answere in this case. Sisamnes. Unworthy much (O prince) am I, and for this gift vnfit: But sith that it hath pleasd your grace, that I in it must sit. I doo auouch vnto my death, according to my skil: With equitie for to obserue, your graces minde and wil. And nought from it to swarue indeed, but sincerely to stay: Els let me taste the penaltie, as I before did say. King, Wel then of this authoritie, I giue you you ful possession: Sisamnes. And I wil it fulfil also, as I haue made profession. King My councel, then let vs departe, a finall stay to make: To Egit land now foorth with speed, my voiage I wil take. Strike vp your dr?mes vs to reioyce, to hear the warlike sound Stay you heer Sisamnes Iudge, and looke wel to your bound. Exeunt King, Lord and Councel. Sisamnes. Euen now the King hath me extolde, and set me vp aloft. Now may I were the brodered garde and lye in down bed soft. Now may I purchase house and land, and haue all at my wil: Now may I build a princely place, my minde for to fulfil. Now may I abrogate the Law, as I shall think it good: If any one me now offend, I may demaund his blood, According to the Prouerb olde, my mouth I wil vp make: Now it dooth lye all in my hand, to leaue or els to take. To deale with Iustice to my bound, and so to liue in hope: But oft? times the birds be gone, while one for nest dooth grope. Doo wel or il, I dare auouch, some euil on me wil speake: No truely yet I doo not meane, the kings precepte to breake. To place I meane for to return my duty to fulfil. Exit. Enter the Vice with an olde Capcase on his hed, an olde pail about his hips for harnes, a Sc?mer &amp; a potlid by his side &amp; a rake on his shhulder. Ambidexter. Stand away, stand away for the passion of God, Harnessed I am prepared to the feeld: I would haue been content at home to haue bod, But I am sent foorth with my speare and sheeld. I am appointed to fight against a Snail, And Wilkin Wren the ancient shall beare: I dout not but against him to preuail, To be a man my deeds shall declare. If I ouercome him, then a Butter flye takes his parte, His weapon must be a blew speckled Hen: But you shall see me ouer throwe him with a fart, So without conquest he shall go home again.

He hath shed so much blood that his wil be shed: If it come so to passe in faith then he is sped. Enter the king vvithout a gown, a swoord thrust vp into his side bleeding. King. Out alas what shall I doo? my life is finished. Wounded I am by sudain chaunce, my blood is minished. Gogs hart what meanes might I make, my life to preserue? Is there nought to be my help? nor is their nought to serue? Out vpon the Court, and Lords that there remain: To help my greef in this my case, wil none of them take pain? Who but I in such a wise his deaths wound could haue got? As I on horse back vp did leape, my swoord from scabard shot. And ran me thus into the side, as you right wel may see: A meruels chaunce vnfortunate, that in this wise should bee. I feele my self a dying now, of life bereft am I: And death hath caught me with his dart, for want of blood I spy. Thus gasping heer on ground I lye, for nothing I doo care: A iust rewad for my misdeeds, thy death dooth plain declare. Heer let him quake and stir, Ambidexter. How now noble King? pluck vp your hart: What wil you dye, and from vs departe? Speake to me, and you be aliue: He cannot speake, but beholde how with death he dooth striue. Alas good King, alas he is gone, The Deuil take me, if for him I make any mone. I did prognosticate of his end by the Masse: Like as I did say so is it come to passe. I wil be gone, if I should be found heer: That I should kil him it would appeer. For feare with his death they doo me charge: Farewel my maisters I wil go take barge. I meane to be packing now is the tide: Farewel my maisters I wil no longer abide. Exit Ambidexter. Enter three Lords first Lord.
