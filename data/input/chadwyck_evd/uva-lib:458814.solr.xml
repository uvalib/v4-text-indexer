      <field name="fulltext">THE VISION OF DELIGHT PRESENTED AT COVRT IN CHRISTMAS, 1617.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scene. A Street in perspective of faire building discovered. Delight Is seene to come as afarre off, accompanied with Grace, Love, Harmonie, Revell, Sport, Laughter. Wonder following. Delight spake in song (stylo recitativo.) Let us play, and dance, and sing, let us now turne every sort; O'the pleasures of the Spring, to the graces of a Court. From ayre, from cloud, from dreams, from toyes, to sounds, to sence, to love to joyes; Let your shewes be new, as strange, let them oft and sweetly varie; Let them haste so to their change, as the Seers may not tarrie; Too long t'expect the pleasing't sight doth take away from the delight. Here the first Anti-maske enter'd. A she Monster delivered of sixe Burratines, that dance with sixe Pantalones, which done Delight , spoke againe. Yet heare what your delight doth pray all sowre and sullen looks away, that are the servants of the day, Our sports are of the humorous night, Who feeds the stars that give her light, and useth (then her wont) more bright, to help the vision of Delight. Here the Night rises, and tooke her Chariot be spangled with starres. Delight , proceeds. See, see her Scepter, and her Crowne are all of flame, and from her gowne a traine of light comes waving down. This night in dew she will not steepe The braine, nor locke the sence in sleepe; but all awake, with Phantomes keepe, and those to make Delight more deep. By this time the Night, and Moone being both risen; Night hovering over the place, Sung Breake Phant'sie from thy cave of cloud, and spread thy purple wings; Now all thy figures are allow'd, and various shapes of things; Create of ayrie formes, a streame; it must have bloud, and naught of fleame, And though it be a waking dreame; The Quire Yet let it like an odour rise to all the Sences here, And fall like sleep upon their eies, or musick in their eare. The Scene here changed to Cloud, and Phant'sie breaking forth, spake. Bright Night, I obey thee, and am come at thy call But it is no one dreame that can please these all; Wherefore I would know what Dreames would delight 'em; For never was Phant'sie more loth to affright'em. And Phant'sie I tell you has dreams that have wings, And dreams that have honey, and dreams that have stings; Dreames of the maker, and Dreames of the teller, Dreames of the kitchin, and Dreames of the Cellar: Some that are tall, and some that are Dwarffes, Some that were halter'd, and some that weare scarffes; Some that are proper, and signifie o'thing, And some another, and some that are nothing: For say the French Verdingale, and the French hood Were here to dispute; must it be understood A feather, for a wispe were a fit moderator? Your Ostritch beleeve it's no faithfull translator Of perfect Utopian; And then it were an od-piece To see the conclusion peepe forth at a cod-piece. The politique pudding hath still his two ends, Tho the bellows, and the bag-pipe were nev'r so good friends: And who can report what offence it would be For the Squirrell to see a Dog clime a tree? If a Dreame should come in now to make you afeard, With a Windmill'on his head, and bells at his beard; Would you streight weare your spectacles, here, at your toes, And your boots o' your browes, and your spurs o' your nose? Your Whale he will swallow, a hogs-head for a pill; But the maker o' the mouse-trap, is he that hath skill. And the nature of the Onion, is to draw teares, As well as the Mustard; peace, pitchers have eares, And Shitlecocks wings, these things doe not mind'em, If the Bell have any sides, the clapper will find'em: There's twice so much musicke in beating the tabor, As i'the Stock-fish, and somewhat lesse labour. Yet all this while, no proportion is boasted T'wixt an egge, and an Oxe, though both have been rosted, For grant the most Barbers can play o'the Citterne, Is it requisite a Lawyer should plead to a Ghitterne? You will say now, the Morris-bells were but bribes To make the heele forget that ev'r it had kibes; I say let the wine make nev'r so good jelly, The conscience o'the bottle, is much i'the belly: For why? doe but take common Councell i'your way, And tell me who'le then set a bottle of hay Before the old Usurer, and to his horse A slice of salt-butter, perverting the course Of civill societie? open that gap, And out skip your fleas, foure and twenty at a clap, With a chaine and a trundle-bed following at th'heeles, And will they not cry then, the world runs a wheeles: As for example, a belly, and no face, With the bill of a Shoveler, may here come in place; The haunches of a Drum, with the feet of a pot, And the tayle of a Kentishman to it; why not? Yet would I take the stars to be cruell, If the Crab, and the Ropemaker ever fight duell, On any dependance, be it right, be it wrong, But mum; a thread may be drawne out too long. Here the second Anti-masque of Phantos'mes came forth, which danced. Phant'sie proceeded. Why? this you will say was phantasticall now, As the Cocke, and the Bull, the Whale, and the Cow; But vanish away, I have change to present you, And such as I hope will more truly content you: Behold the gold-haird Houre descending here, That keepes the gate of Heaven, and turnes the yeare, Alreadie with her sight, how she doth cheare, And makes another face of things appeare. Here one of the Houres descending, the whole Scene changed to the Bower of Zephytus, whilst, Peace sung, as followeth Why looke you so, and all turne dumbe! to see the opener of the New-yeare come? My presence rather should invite, and ayd, and urge, and call to your delight, The many pleasures that I bring are all of youth, of heate, of life, and spring, And were prepard to warme your blood, not fixe it thus as if your Statutes stood. The Quire we see, we heare, we feele, we taste, we smell the change in every flowre, we onely wish that all could last, and be as new still as the houre. The Song ended. Wonder spake. Wondrr must speake, or breake; what is this? growes The wealth of Nature here, or Art? it showes As if Favonius, father of the Spring, Who, in the verdant Meads doth reigne sole king, Had rowsd him here, and shooke his feathers, wet With purple swelling Nectar? and had let The sweet and fruitfull dew fall on the ground To force out all the flowers that might be found? Or a Minerva with her needle had Th'enamourd earth with all her riches clad, And made the downie Zephire as he flew Still to be followd with the Springs best hue? The gaudie Peacocke boasts not in his traine, So many lights and shadowes, nor the raine- Resolving Iris, when the Sun doth court ber, Nor purple Phesant while his Aunt doth sporther To heare him crow; and with a pearched pride Wave his dis-coloured necke, and purple side? I have not seene the place could more surprize, It looks (me thinkes) like one of natures eyes, Or her whole bodie set in art? behold! How the Blew-binde weed doth it selfe infold With Honey-suckle, and both these intwine Themselves with Bryonie, and Jessamine, To cast a kinde and odoriferous shade? Phant'sie. How better then they are, are all things made By Wonder? But a while refresh thine eye, Ile put thee to thy oftner, what, and why? Here (to a loud musicke) the Bower opens, and the Maskers discovered, as the glories of the Spring. Wonder againe spake. Thou wilt indeed; what better change appeares? Whence is it that the ayre so sudden cleares, And all things in a moment turne so milde, Whose breath or beams, have got proud earth with child, Of all the treasure that great Natur's worth, And makes her every minute to bring forth? How comes it Winter is so quite forc't hence, And lockt up under ground? that every sence Hath severall objects? Trees have got their heads, The fields their coats? that now the shining Meads Doe boast the Paunce, the Lillie, and the Rose; And every flower doth laugh as Zephire blowes? That Seas are now more even then the Land? The Rivers runne as smoothed by his hand; Onely their heads are crisped by his stroake: How plaies the Yearoling with his brow scarce broke Now in the open Grasse? and frisking Lambs Make wanton Salts about their drie-suckt Dams; Who to repaire their bags doe rob the fields? How is't each bough a severall musicke yeilds? The lusty Throstle, early Nightingale Accord in tune, though varie in their tale? The chirping Swallow cald forth by the Sun, And crested Larke doth his division run? The yellow Bees, the ayre with murmure fill? The Finches caroll, and the Turtles bill? Whose power is this? what God? Phant'sie Behold a King Whose presence maketh this perpetuall Spring, The glories of which Spring grow in that Bower, And are the marks and beauties of his power. To which Quire answered. Tis he, tis he, and no power els That makes all this what Phant'sie tels; The founts, the flowers, the birds, the Bees, The heards, the flocks, the grasse, the trees, Do all confesse him; but most These Who call him lord of the foure Seas, King of the lesse and greater Iles, And all those happy when he smiles. Advance, his favour calls you to advance, And do your (this nights) homage in a'dance. Here they danced their entry, after which they sung againe. [Quire.] Againe, againe; you cannot be Of such a true delight too free, Which who once saw would ever see; And if they could the object prize, Would while it lasts not thinke to rise, But wish their bodies all were eyes. They Danc'd their maine Dance, after which they sung. [Quire.] In curious knots and mazes so The Spring at first was taught to go; And Zephire, when he came to wooe His Flora, had their motions too, And thence did Venus learne to lead Th'Idalian Braules, and so tread As if the wind, not she did walke; Nor prest a flower, nor bow'd a stalke. They Danc'd with Ladies, and the whole Revells followed; after which Aurora appeared (the Night and Moone) descended, and this Epilogue followed. I was not wearier where I lay By frozen Tythons side to night; Then I am willing now to stay, And be a part of your delight. But I am urged by the Day, Against my will to bid you come away. The Quire. They yeild to Time, and so must all. As Night to sport, Day doth to action call, Which they the rather doe obey, Because the Morne, with Roses strew's the way. Here they Danc'd their going off, and Ended.</field>
