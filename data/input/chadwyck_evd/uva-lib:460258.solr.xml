      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Ladies and Gentlemen! âYou are here invited, Not to be entertain'd, I fearâbut frighted. How shall our delicate lads, and tender lasses, Who scream and trembleâif a mouse but passesâ Withstand the mighty terrors of this night? Gigantic, hideous formsâphrewâdreadful sight! Besides, you know, it is not in our nature, To like your folksâso very much aboveâourselves in stature. I told our author thisâI was not for itâhe, Forsooth, must have it soâand quotes authority. Homer, you'll see, he says, in Pope's translation, Gives you, of Giants, a whole hulking nationâ Damn'd strapping dogs, with mouths to ears expanded; And, though all single-eyed, yet double-handed! Ovid, in treating of old times, can tell us, This earth once teem'd with such tall thwacking fellows, Who scaled the skies, on Ossa Pelion rear'd, And the blest gods in their bright mansions scared. 'Tis true, they fail'dâand thence, fourteen to seven, Giants have dropt all hopeâof scaling Heaven. Ah! what good times we live in?âYet, I hate Our world should growâso littleâall of late. You can't conceive what trouble and vexation We have had, to pick Three Giants from a nationâ No monsters, neitherâjust enough to shew Some scenes, that pastâa thousand years ago! Wellâcould we find it without his explainingâ This man, altho' a poet, has some meaning. Suppose nowâay!âNo, noâI cannot say For certainâfaith, e'en find it as ye may! Yet, to avow One Truth, I shall not fearâ He means All Honourâto All Persons, here!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, SPOKEN AT THE SECOND REPRESENTATION. From a Free Stage commanded to retreat, Shun'd by the Cautious, silenced by the Great, Our author opens all his heart to view, And wishes to be tried, by Heaven, and you. In all he labour'd, and in all he taught, If e'er his works inspired one impious thought; If e'er disloyalty has stained his pen, Or faction pois'nous to the peace of men; If yet one verse from malice learn'd to flow, Or made, of worthy men, a single foe; If reputation by one stroke has bled; If e'er he tinged one modest cheek with red; If even, when Vice stood hateful to his sight, He pointed where one partial shaft should lightâ He then will be the foremost to declare His sufferings merited, their censure fair. He, by no party duped, no faction sway'd Claims the high road where Truth and Nature lead: Takes, with fair Liberty, his tour abroad; And walks, unwarp'd by pique, by Power unaw'd. Should Slander tempt, should Injury provoke, He deviates not, nor aims one sidelong stroke: But where Guilt stands, or thrusts upon his way, Let it reformâor feel him as it may! What antique whim, what out of fashion'd taste, Tempts modern meetings to a moral feast? No clamorous drum is here, no wanton dance, Nor songs from Italy, nor cooks from France: Your table is with mental dishes spread, And cates on which immortal souls are fed; That give the newborn sentiment to grow, Its thought to widen, and its worth to glow; That touch the heart, and humanize the mind, And pour in all that's feeling, good, and kind; Yet bid heroic ardours stand confest, And nerve the stubborn Patriot in the breast. Such is the feast that's relish'd by the few; The Food of Angels!â [To the Ladies. And of men, like you!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Country Village. John Good met by several Peasants, running from different parts. 1st Peas. Run, run, runâ 2d Peas. We're all undone! 3d Peas. Run, run! Jack. What, are you mad?âThe devil's in the people! 1st Peas. A Giant, sir, a Giant, like a steeple! 2d Peas. His eyes two beacons are, three miles asunder. 3d Peas. His mouth a furnace, and his voice a thunder. 1st Peas. On Lammas last, the ugly dog, confound him, He ravished all our maids, nine miles around him. 2d Peas. The greedy gut, last fair, as I'm a sinner, Eat up both men and market, at a dinner. 3d Peas. A goodly farm I had, with kine to stock it; House, farm, and all, he whips me in his pocket. All in a chafe, I runs me to the Corum, And ript the bundle of my griefs, before 'em: Alack, my masters, 'twas a musty arrant; The Corum heardâbut hold ye thereâno warrant! What should I do, at such a woeful crisis? I tuck'd my duds, and trudg'd to our assizes; When, lo sir, as I stood, my wrongs disclosing, One Judge sat wisely deaf, and 'tother dozing. Jack. My friends, your State Physicians, thro' all nations, Prescribe the Poor their standing doseâof Patience. The Weak must bend, or break; the Wise be pliant; Nor vainly look for Justice on a Giant. AIR I. Tune. âAt the Tree I shall suffer with pleasure.â I. The Laws they were made for the Little, The Laws they were made for the Little: In the hands of the Strong, All the ties, that belong To Justice and Honour, are brittle. CHORUS. In the hands of the Strong, &amp;c. II. The Laws they were made for the Little, The Laws they were made for the Little: Though Churchmen may preach, And Philosophers teach, The Great will not list to a tittle. CHORUS Though Churchmen, &amp;c. III. The laws they were made for the Little, The Laws they were made for the Little: It is not by Right, But by Wrong-doing Might, That Giants still scape a Committal. CHORUS. It is not by right. &amp;c. Jack. Yet fear not, honest neighbours! come, there may, A future deed, to mark some future day, When I shall meet this Giant of the land, In single opposition, hand to hand: Thereafter, 'twill be easy to divine, Whose hand shall prove the stronger, his or mine. 1st Peas. May Heaven's high help, our little Hero bless! 2d Peas. We wish your Honour, mighty good success. [Exit Jack. 3d Peas. Soft ye, my neighbours!âwhat is this I see? You spoke but of one Giantâhere are three! 1st Peas. Then look ye, friends, there's little more to say, The hindmost let them catchâ All. Away, away! [Exeunt running. SCENE II. Rumbo and Blunderbore. Rumb. 'Sfish! what have we got here? Blund. Do you want to know, You hulking slobber-chops? Rumb. Boâo, o, o! Blund. Hey day, do you think to fright us? blood and thunder! Rumb. O sir! pray sir!âyou see, sir, I knock underâ Good sir, may I crave your name? Blund. 'Tis Blunderbore! Rumb. 'Tis Blunderbuss, you mean, you thumping son of a whore. Blund. My blood and breath! Rumb. Don't bite its pretty thumbsâ I'll send to buy a bib, and sugar plumbs. AIR II. Tune. âA Country Lad I am.â Blund. Odso, I do begin, To think the rascal's bamming! Rumb. Keep ill words within, And wisely save a slamming. Blund. Why, my Bully Bluff, Do you think I fear you, With your cock and huff! Rumb. Friend, if I was near you!â Blund. Caution guides the Wise, In the midst of Joking. Rumb. Think what Wrath may rise, If you grow provoking! Blund. Your bones I'd mill and fry, In your greasy marrow! Rumb. You lieâ Blund. You lieâ Rumb. You lieâ Blund. Sirrah! Rumb. Sirrah! Blund. Sirrah! Rumb. Nay, then I send all gentleness a jogging. Have at your loggerhead!â Blund. Have at your noggin!â SCENE III. As they engage, enter Galigantus. Galig. Hold for your lives!âwho stirs upon the spot, By all my brother gods, he goes to pot? Rumb. Hey, boys!âwho taught our neighbour's calf to bellow? Friend Blunder, do you know this huffing fellow? Blund. Not I upon my conscienceâI renounce him! Rumb. A wordâsuppose we both should joinâ Blund. And trounce him! Rumb. A match! Galig. Come on, you jack-a-dandy elves; And learn to know your master, and yourselves! SCENE IV. Thunder and Lightning. Plutus ascends, a golden rod in his hand, and his robe spangled with gems and medals. Plut. Lo! from my secret mansion, in the deep, Where treasures in their causes sleep; Of riches the omnific lord, On earth, above all power that is in Heaven, adoredâ I rise, my children's wrath to charm, With counsel to assuage, with music to disarm. AIR III. Soft Music. Plut. I. This scepter'd hand all nations own; All religions hold divineâ I, the king of every throne; I, the god of every shrine! II. Gold is every woman's lust! Gold is every man's desire! Gold the covert patriot's gust!â Kneel my sons, and own your sire! [Giants kneel. Galig. Father! your sacred influence I own, And nature feels, that I am your's alone; But, for this precious pair, my booby brothers, I would, good sir, I wouldâthey were another's. Plut. Thee, Galigantus, in life's golden tide, I got upon thy mother, Prideâ Son of my strength, in an auspicious hour; And call'd thee, Power. To thee succeeded, ere 'twas long, These thy two brothers, Violence and Wrong: If of their kin thou thinkest shame, Employ their Natures, but suppress their Name. Nor thou, my eldest born, their fellowship disown; But let them share thy grace, and they'll support thy throne. Galig. Father! thy Word is sageâbe this embrace, Our bond of brotherhood, our bond of peace! [Giants embrace. Plut. Heir of my might, to thee I give this wand, To spread thy power, and grace thy hand; Bright emblem of thy race, proud ensign of command! Galig. First, humbly on my knee I bend, To learn its use, and know its end. Plut. When o'er the heads of Senates, Courts, and Kings, Thine arm doth wave This golden wand, from whence all influence springsâ Who curtsies, is avow'd thy slave: Who bendeth not, if such a wight there be, Thy deadliest foe is he! Whatever ancient story tells Of incantations, charms, or spells, This rod containsâa sage and learned wand; And is the mightier Merlin, of the land! Beyond the sun's meridian beam, Its touch unthreads the human frameâ No Virtue may abide the proved essay; And every worth exhales, like morning mists, away. Wouldst thou embroil the world in Fight? Set up this Ensign to their sightâ Around the nations shall engage, And madding Discord shout, and boundless Havock rage! Then bid Contention ceaseâ Down with this kindling rod, and all again is peace. Wonder-working Gold has done, All the feats beneath the sun; Gold was the talisman of every Magus, And Circe's Witchful Cup was taken from the Tagus. AIR IV. Tune. âMoll Roe.â I. Plut. Would you silence a Patriot-committee, Touch their lips with this Magical Wand; Through country, and senate, and city, 'Tis the lock and the key of the land. CHORUS. Through country and senate, &amp;c. II. Take a piece of this same from your coffer, Display to the Voter your pelf; And the wretch having nothing to offer, Will frugally sell you Himself. CHORUS. And the wretch having nothing to, &amp;c. III. 'Tis a shot for the fowl of all feather, A bait for the gust of all fish; To this every gudgeon will gather, And plump, ready drest, in your dish. CHORUS. To this every gudgeon, &amp;c. IV. If the booby, your Pupil, so dull is, He scarce can remember his name; Yet his mouth it shall open like Tully's, When fed with a Spoon of this same. CHORUS. Yet his mouth it shall open, &amp;c. V. Though a rascal, a bear, and a blockhead, Unconscious of mood or of tense, This plastic receipt in your pocket, Gives grace, figure, virtue, and sense. CHORUS. This plastic receipt in your, &amp;c. VI. 'Tis Gold that all women bewitches; Though wrinkled, and thinner than lawn, If you get but the pence in your breeches, You'll want neither beauty nor brawn. CHORUS. If you get but the pence in, &amp;c. VII. In courts should your cause be disjointed, Let not that sink your spirits one peg; With the Oil of this Nostrum anoint it, 'Twill make it as right as my leg. CHORUS. With the Oil of this Nostrum anoint it, &amp;c. VIII. Old Saints will, for this, sell their manuels; O'er this, at your sovereign nod, Old Judges will skip like young spaniels; And Cardinals kiss you this rod. CHORUS. Old judges will skip, &amp;c. IX. To study aught else, is but nonsense; From hence all Philosophy springsâ 'Tis the Crown, Beauty, Cause, and Good Conscience, Of priests, ladies, lawyers, and kings. CHORUS.

Somewhere, I ween, in Britain's ancient ground, A maid, call'd Jillian Justice, may be foundâ A princess fair, born of a race divine; A race, as wide as pole and pole from thine! Her seek, secure; and when a captive led, By force or flattery win to share thy bed. Seize her fell sword, the Magic Sword of Law, Which but one arm, the arm of Truth can draw. By night, alone, unheard, and unespied, Deep under ground that hostile weapon hideâ For, woe the day! when all thy glory's sped, Thine eye shall see it brandish'd o'er thy head. Enough is said, enough is done!â The blessings of thy Sire still wait on thee, my son! [Thunder and lightningâPlutus descends. Galig. Come, my brothers, hand in hand, Let's rule the court, and roam the land; Or if, in prudence, we should seem to part, Keep frequent in my eye, and always in my heart! [Exeunt.

Jacky, Jacky, these are fine romancesâ That little noddle is so full of fancies! Unfeather'd rambler, whither would'st thou roam, And straggle, like a callow wren, from home? A callow wrenâno, Jacky!âif thou'lt part, Thou'lt be a hawk, to tear thy mother's heart. Jack. Good mammy, peace!âno more your son importune; In-sooth, I must abroad to seek my fortune: For once a witch foretold, as witches can, That Little Jack was madeâfor a great man. Dor. My Jacky, all ambition is a snare, Twisted by danger, shame, and care! Nor let false hopes thy childish fancy cheat; Content is happy!âGood is Great! AIR VI. Tune. âIf all the Fair Maids.â [I.] Ambition, like Jack-o-the-Lanthorn bewitches; Ambition, like Jack-o-the-Lanthorn bewitches; And leads you, benighted, through dirt and through ditches. Dol, dol, &amp;c. II. Your griping for gold, a beggarly itch is; Your griping for gold, a beggarly itch is; And Virtue, tho' humble, looks down upon riches. Dol dol, &amp;c. III. Your great men, and state men, the higher their pitch is, Your great men, and state men, the higher their pitch is; By climbing, the broader they shew us their breeches. Dol, dol, &amp;c. Jack. Dear mammy, cease all further qualms and queries; This frolick was not bred of my vagaries: Then, since it must be told you, hear a wonderâ 'Tis Heaven, that tears thy child and thee asunder. The three last nights as to my bed I hied me, Methought, an ancient madam stood beside me; Her kerchief with her eyes and nose was slubber'd, Her gown was tatter'd, and her cheeks were blubber'd: âJacky,â she criedâand sure she was no otherâ âI am, my child, thy true and loving mother! âMy farm that was so fenced, is run to ravage! âMy bleating flocks devour'd by Giants savage. âUp, Jacky, up, have at the raggamuffins! âFor thee I've chosen, to give these blades their buffings.â Dor. Alack, one of these lubbards would not think ill, To lay your tiny rougeship in a wrinkle. Jack. Fear them not, mammy: bulk gives place to art, And strength and cunning to a valiant heart. And better you have taught than school or college, That âsimple goodness is the shrewdest knowledge.â AIR VII. Tune. âThere was three valiant Welshmen.â Thro' all the world, your Davids still have pull'd Goliahs down; And little were your mighty men, your men of great renown. Though tiney be your lap-dog, he'll chase a lusty flock; And Giants to your Jacky, are but ganders to a cock. Dor. Well, Jacky, well, I must not say thee nay: When thy dear country bids, away, away!â I will but stop, since things are past redressing, To bring my child his cake, and give a mother's blessing. [Exit. Jack. Bless me, the girl has plenty of salt water!â Why does my Gracey whimper? Grace. 'Tis no matterâ Jack. My sweeting sister, take this kiss; and take The prizes that I won at our last wakeâ These letter'd garters, ribband, rose, and thimble, With all the cash I have, one silver nimble! And soon I'll bring a baby-house, and dollies; A husband too, with other pretty follies. Grace. I care not for your trumpery; for they Have nought for me, who take their love away. Go to your folk of falsehood and formality, Your masque of stately mummers, court, and quality! But soon, mayhap, you'll wish, my little mister, You'd staid and play'd hot-cockles with your sister. AIR VIII. Tune. âDole and woe fa'our Cat.â I. For often my mammy has told, And sure she is wondrous wise, In cities that all you behold, Is a fair, but a faithless disguise. II. That the modes of a court education, Are train-pits and traitors to youth; And the only fine language in fashion, A tongue that is foreign to Truth. III. Where Honour is barely an oath, Where knaves are with noblemen class'd; Where Nature's a stranger to both, And Love an old tale of times past. IV. Where laughter no pleasure dispenses, Where smiles are the envoys of art; Where joy lightly swims on the senses, But never can enter the heart. V. Where hopes and kind hugs are trepanners, Where Virtue's divorced from Success; Where cringing goes current for manners, And worth is no deeper than dress. VI. Where Favour creeps lamely on crutches, Where Friendship is nothing but face; And the title of duke, or of duchess, Is all that entitles to Grace. Jack. Sister, with thee I could for ever liveâ I go not to gain happiness, but give! AIR IX. Tune. âLochaber.â Jack. [I.] Farewell to my Gracey, my Gracey so sweet! Though parting be painful, how pleasing to meet! Thy Jacky will languish and look for the day, That shall kiss the dear tears of his sister away. Though honour in groves of tall laurel should grow, And fortune in tides should eternally flow; Nor honour, nor fortune, shall Jacky detain, But he'll come to his sister, his Gracey again. II. Again at our door, in the morning of spring, To see the sun rise, and hear goldfinches sing; To rouse our companions and queens of the May In copses to gambol, in meadows to play At questions and forfeits, all ranged on the grass; To gather fresh chaplets, each lad for his lass; To whoop-and-to-hide, and play tag on the plain, Thy Jack shall return to his Gracey again. III. Or alone in his Gracey's sweet company blest, To feed the young Robins that chirp on the nest; To help at her medicines and herbs for the poor, And welcome the stranger that sits at the door; At night o'er our fire, and cup of clear ale, To hear the town news and the traveller's tale; To smile away life till our heads they grow hoar, And part from my sheep and my Gracey no more SCENE II. Enter Dorothy Good. Dor. This little loaf, with my large blessing, take. Jack. Your blessing is yet sweeter than your cake! Dor. This too receiveâwithin this narrow chest, Lies the best wealth that ever man possest; By your own ancestors the prize was won, And handed down, improved, from sire to son. It is, my child, a strange and precious storeâ The more imparted 'twill increase the more; A store, my son, which thousands will admire, Yet none will envy, and but few desire. Jack. Thanks, thanks!âThe rising tear begins to flow; My heart grows heavy, and my steps move slow! My mother dearâmy sister fairâto you Farewell at onceâAdieu! Dor. Adieu! Grace. Adieu! [Exit Jack. AIR X. Tune. âOroo Dremendoo.â Grace. I. O now, with my Jacky, my own sweet boy, Farewell to the tasteless appearance of joy! To a heart so o'erladen, all sorrows are meet, Misfortunes are welcome, and mourning is sweet. II. Away ye companions of daily delight, And pastimes that gently could steal on the night; Away ye fond sports of the wake and the fair; Your pleasures are vanishedâno Jacky is there! III. Of the ball, and the hurling, the dance, and the race, His skill was the victor, his person the grace; The maids they would kiss from his head to his knee, And wish they had all been his sisters like me. IV. In the streams and the woodlands, the green and the glade, Where we frisk'd with our kids, with our lambkins we play'd, Say your Jacky was here, and your Jacky was thereâ But where is my Jacky nowâtell me, O where? V. Thus ev'ry dear scene of my former delight, To my mind still recalls himâbut not to my sight: The trees they all droop, and the meadows look lone; For whily, lilee, lilee looâmy Jacky is gone!â Dor. Come, Gracey, comeâpluck up a little courage; Grief never boil'd a simple mess of porridge. Let's to our task, my girl, our wheels within; There weep thy bellyfulâbut weep and spin! AIR XI. Tune. âGrania Mucil.â Dor. I. Though passions contend, and afflictions storm, And shake the frail state of our human form; If Virtue the base of our pile sustain, Affliction shall rage and assault in vain. II. The path for the steps of all mortals made, Is simply to follow where Truth shall lead; Nor thou from its rectitude turn aside: The rest, let hereafter and Heaven provide. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Lawn. Jillian Justice, seated as Queen of May, and crowned with flowers; her Nurse attending with her balance and sword; Shepherd and Shepherdesses alternately ranged on either hand, the lower Shepherds and Shepherdesses advance strewing flowers. 1st Shep. Prepareâand, where our Queen shall tread, All nature's flowery carpet spread! 2d Shep. Pansy, and Rose, and Asphodel, Daughters of every dale and dell. 3d Shep. Not the forced growth of garden plots, Of reeking beds, and artful knotsâ 4th Shep. But such as willing sweetness yield, Flowers of the spontaneous field! 1st Shep. Jillian, fairest Queen, advance! Lead the happy hours in dance. 2d Shep. In your scales our seasons weigh, And make our every month a May! Jillian advances, while a Shepherd and Shepherdess sing alternately on either hand. AIR XII. Tune. âI have sixpence under my thumb.â I. How sweet the melodious birds that sing! How sweet the treasure the zephyrs bring, Light wafted from each odoriferous wing, That winnows the breast of flowery spring! CHORUS. How sweet, &amp;c. II. How sweet the showers with balm replete! The fawns that frolick, and lambs that bleat! But O, above all, though all should meet, Our Jilly, our Queen of sweets, is sweet! CHORUS. How sweet the showers, &amp;c. Jill. Thanks, gentle friends!âenjoy your happy state, Below the envy of the Small, above the griefs that rack the Great. For what's the pomp of courts, but irksome din? Without, all glitter; but all gloom, withinâ Their broadest pride, but folly more display'd; Their state but guilt, on care-press'd purple laid! 'Tis here that Nature to true bliss invites, And sweetens toil beyond all town delights. In every rural stream pure pleasure flows, Buds in the trees, and in the blossom glows; Thrills every sense; and more than sense refined, Enters in peace, and sinks upon the mind. AIR XIII. Tune. âTo you fair Ladies on the Land.â I. Jill. The world, a faithless ocean! tost By passion's stormy wind, Is spread with spoils of thousands lost, The wreck of humankind; Where all the freight their vessels bear, Is but a wilful weight of care!â With a fal, tal, &amp;c. CHORUS. Where all the freight, &amp;c. II. For what can Reason's feeble hand, Before the helm perform, Where he can spy nor port, nor land, To scape from stress or stormâ Where Hope, amid the raging main, His anchor castsâbut casts in vain?â With a fal, tal, &amp;c. CHORUS. Where hope, &amp;c. III. O turn, misguided wight, return, To us who smile on shore; To us, who yet your errors mourn, Your safety who implore! Your forfeit peace with us renew, Who shed no tearsâexcept for you!â With a fal, tal, &amp;c. CHORUS. Your forfeit peace, &amp;c. Jill. The bustling world a deal of wisdom vaunts; Yet few their wishes know, and none their wants: And lest those wants or wishes should abate, Invention labours hard new wants and wishes to create. AIR XIV. Tune. âTwang dillo dee.â I. Jill. But we to Nature who adhere, nor further bliss require; To lop the root of all our care, we lop our vain desire. Twang dillo dee. CHORUS. To lop the root, &amp;c. II. We ask no cynic law, nor saw, nor scrolls of bearded men; For Nature's the most learned book, that Innocence can ken. Twang dillo dee. CHORUS. For Nature's the, &amp;c. III. To baffle want, and sweeten toil, from debt and danger free, We learn instruction from the ant, and the industrious bee. Twang dillo dee. CHORUS. We learn, &amp;c. IV. From dogs we learn unfailing faith, affection from the dove; And from the hen that guards her chick, a parent's circling love. Tang dillo dee. CHORUS. And from the hen, &amp;c. V. And last, we to All bounteous Heaven our daily tribute yield, Taught by the fragrant incense breathed from every grateful field. Twang dillo dee. CHORUS. Taught by the fragrant, &amp;c. Jill. Now every maid to every lover dear, And every lover kind and true, draw near! Give me the beam that shall their fates decide, And poize in equal scale the future groom and bride. [Jillian takes the Scales. Your favours! comeâ [And weighs the Favours. Here Will and Nan, you see, In gifts and graces to a hair agree. Hodge here is old, but wise; and Nell, his bride, Young, fair, and vain, and greatly wants a guide: The beam, observe, hangs fair!â Did fortune weigh, Hob's favours would prevail; But Doll, by nature rich, makes light her lover's scale: Her choice is free!â Moll is cross-shaped, and Tom a comely youth; But Moll is beautified by love and truth: Thomas discern, and well respect your bride; The beam, observe, turns wholly to her side!â Happy couples, hand in hand, Bind the soft, the sacred band! Long and silken be the thread, The fates shall spin the hour you wed! Be the flame as chaste as bright, That shall your nuptial taper light; And may each sun's returning ray, Awake you to a joyful day! AIR XV. Tune. âYou Commons and Peers.â Jill. I. The time to beguile, Now listen a while, And I'll shew you an excellent plot; How husband and wife, Through the crosses of life, May be held by the true lover's knot. II. As mortals are frail, Let indulgence prevail, And all mutual infirmities blot; Let the husband atone His wife's faults by his own, And I'll vouch for the true lover's knot. III. My Dolly so bright, Should your Hob, over night, Be surprised by his pipe or his pot; Let him sleep his dose out, Nor by scolding and pout, Strive to loosen the true lover's knot. IV. When your wives they grow grey, And their graces decay, Of all mortal beauty the lot; Remember their youth, And, by friendship and truth, Make eternal the true lover's knot! SCENE III. A Shepherd enters in haste. Shep. Fly, princess, fly! âThe Giants come!ââis all the cry. They spare nor sex, nor age; Fire, sword, and lust, throughout the country rage. Jill. Give me my swordâ Fear not, my friends; but straight release That dreadful weapon from its case! [Shep. attempt to draw it. Alas! your trembling hands declare your fright. To draw that blade, With terror and with truth inlaid, Demands a steady arm, an heart upright. Shep. âThey come, they come!ââis all the cry. Fly, fly!â [They throw down the sword, and all run out except Jillian and Nurse. SCENE IV. The Three Giants enter, attended by Grandees. Gal. Our prize is here!âshe's found, she's found! Bow down, my brothers, to the groundâ To Justice fair, with me your homage pay, And worship, though you can't obey. [They all kneel. Jill. Arise, my lordâ Your captive scorns this servile shew. Throughout eternity, we know Each other for a foe. [Giants rise. Gal. Ha!âthere, I ween, our second prize, The subject of our Father's terror, lies! Uncase that blade, my brother Wrong; For though thine intellect be weak, thine arm, I know, is strong! Blund. It will not yieldâin vain I try. Gal. Let Violence his force apply. Rum. Nor I.â Gal. Give me the swordâto Power, I knew, The mighty task alone was due! Rum. Nor you!â Gal. Pshaâ'tis a paltry wooden toy, Glewed to the sheath to grace some boy! Such baubles can't our courage awe; For what this arm has fail'd to force, no arm on earth can draw! [Throws away the swordâNurse takes it up. Gal. My brothers, bear the captive of my power, With all respect, to our enchanted tower; And let such due attendance on her wait, As best becomes our honour, and her state. [Exeunt Rum. Blund. Jill. and Nurse. Thus far success our conquering arms has crown'd, And our bold brows with fragrant laurels bound! Like gods we've past o'er ev'ry stop and stay, That Law could raise, or peevish Patriots lay; O'erturn'd their moralizing mounds by might, And proved, to Power, that every road is right. AIR XVI. Tune. âDainty Davy.â Gal. Howe'er dry hypocrites may aim, To dash with blame, And brand with shame, Our deeds of fame; They act the same, Though on a slyer plan, sir, But you, and you, and he, and he, Must all agree, That, when you see A chap like me, Bold, frank, and free, You've found your honest man, sir.â END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A Wood. Beggars advance. 1st Beg. Bold Robin Hood, In the green wood stoodâhye derry derry down, Under the green wood tree: Tidings there came to him with speed, Tidings of certainty, hye down, hye derry derry down. 2d Beg. Pray you, this Robin Hood of whom you sing, Was he, mayhap, a beggar, or a king? 1st Beg. Both, both; for, like a gallant prince, my brothers, He lived but by the toil and spoil of others: And from the king most Christian, to the Turk, All men are beggars, markâwho will not work. AIR XVII. Tune. âA begging we will go.â However some in coaches, on barrows some may beg, 'Tis Want that makes the Mendicant, and not the wooden leg. CHORUS. When a begging they do go, &amp;c. 'Tis thus by greater poverty, our nobles grow renown'd; For where we want a penny, State-Beggars want a pound. CHORUS. And a begging they will go, &amp;c. Your Courtier begs for Honour, and that's a want indeed; As many should for Honesty, but will not own their need. CHORUS. When a begging they should go, &amp;c. Your Vizier begs for Subsidies, your Partymen for Place; Your Churchman for a Benefice, butânot a man for Grace, CHORUS. When a begging they do go, &amp;c. Then all, from Rome to London, are of the begging train; But we who beg for Charityâmust look to beg in vain. CHORUS. When a begging we do go, &amp;c. SCENE II. Enter Jack. Jack. Be merry, friends!âWhat forest is this same? Ch. Beg. Your honour's charityâ 2d Beg. Poorâ 3d Beg. Blindâ 4th Beg. And lame! Jack. For eyes and limbs, they are not mine to give; But cash and cake are yoursâhere, eat and live! Pray what may your dependance be, my brothers? Ch. Beg. The grace, and the abundance, sir, of others. Jack. How small the income of your great estate! The grace is little, the abundance great. AIR XVIII. Tune. âFye, let us awa to the Wedding.â Jack. When the heir has attain'd the wish'd hour, Of laying his dad in the ground, And sees the seal'd bags in his power, Old hoardings of pound on pound; What poor do you think in waiting, All gaping to seize his store?â A train of his own creating, His pleasures had starv'd before! My friends, how facetiously droll is Your suit to our ladies fair? Alas, from their own poor follies, How think you that they can spare? Against such intruders, on hinges Still turns the forbidding door; For Vanity eats up the Indies, And hungers and thirsts for more. Yet many, when beggars are pressing, Of bounty are nothing lothâ The Bishop will give you his Blessing, The Officer give you his Oath; Of his promise to be a free donor, The Courtier is little nice; And Great-ones will give you their Honourâ For these are of little price! SCENE III. Enter Shepherds and Shepherdesses in a Train. They all kneel to Jack. 1st Shep. O champion great, As ever compass'd wondrous feat! Hero of every wake and fair, Of many a mighty ancestor the mighty heir!â Upon the prowess of thine arm we call; And at thine honour'd feet fall low, thine humble suppliants all. Chor. Upon the prowess, &amp;c. Jack. Alas, my friends, what ill hath chanced?âreply! And quick as lightning, or as thought, to your redress I fly. Shep. The Giants!âO the Giants Three, Have seized, secured, and born away Our Lady Justice, queen of men and May! Chor. Have seized, &amp;c. Jack. Trust me, if found she be, Above or under ground, she's free!â [Shepherds rise. AIR XIX. Tune. âMy heart is awa with the Highland Laddie.â 1st Shep. O knight of knightly errants prime, To dread atchievements bold and ready; No knight of ancient time or clime, E'er fought or fell for such a Lady! No Knight, &amp;c. She's fair and soft as new drop'd lambs, More sweet than garlands on a May-day; And gifts as free as milk from dams, Flow from the goodness of our Lady. And gifts, &amp;c. Jack. Enough, enough!âbreak not your champion's heart, Lest his arm fail to act a soldier's part. Ch. Beg. Mean you to fight all three? Jack. Yes, hand to hand, And chase their very shadows from the land. 1st Shep. Then blest once more beneath our Lady's eye We might in pleasure live, and learn in peace to die. Ch. Beg. It would, indeed, be curious then to view A turn in thingsâso very strange and new! CHORUS. A turn in thingsâso very strange and new! AIR XX. Tune. âA Cobler there was.â Ch. Beg. How curious to mark the surprize of the town, To see Truth elated, Dishonour pull'd down! Jack. All tricks low and little despised by the Great, And Honesty fix'd for a Maxim of State!â Derry down, &amp;c. CHORUS. All tricks, &amp;c. Ch. Beg. To see Worth and Talents to Office preferr'd, The Virtuous rewarded, the Vicious deterr'd; Jack. And the Streams of Pollution, where people resort, New fed from the clarified springs of our Court! Derry down, &amp;c. CHORUS. And the streams, &amp;c. Ch. Beg. To see our laced Lordlings deserving of Trust, Our Clergymen pious, our Justices just; Jack.

Derry down, &amp;c. CHORUS. Pure Nature exalted, &amp;c. Jack. To see Mirth with Innocence walking the land, And Probity taking Free Trade by the hand. Ch. Beg. And the Courts of our Law from Iniquity clearâ O Jack, what a rare revolution were here! Derry down, &amp;c. CHORUS. And the Courts, &amp;c. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Enchanted Tower. Enter Jillian and Nurse. Nurse. Alack, my love, all earthly joys are fleeting!â Don't vex and fret that pretty heart, my sweeting. Jill. Fret me, no frettings, nurseâI vow and swear it, No saint, so tempting, and so young, could bear it, To be thus used!â Nurse. Take patience to you, madamâ Jill. Shut up from every son of Father Adam! AIR XXI. Tune. âHosier's Ghost. Jill. Where are now your Knights so laden, With applause from young and old, For relief of tender Maiden, From the gripe of Giants bold? I, a flower, fair, fresh, and blooming, In a lonely vale must lie, All my virgin sweets consuming, Far from every senseâO fye!â REPEAT. I, a flower, &amp;c. Nurse. A well a-day!âin true and honest speaking, It is, as one may say, a piteous taking! AIR XXII. Tune. âChevy Chace.â Jill. But since by mortals 'tis confest, The shafts of fate must fall; I'll take firm patience to my breast, And smile secure from all. Nurse. Why, that's well saidâwere Solomon distrest, He could of markets bad but make the best. AIR XXIII. Tune. âMy Miny thought lang.â Jill. My spirit revivesâmy heart it does say, It is not so bad as my fears would betray; And fortune may yet, on some frolicksome day, Send a pretty young lad to take me away. And fortune may yet, &amp;c. Nurse. Hush, hark my lambâno more of your sweet hummingâ Methinks I hear the ugly Giants coming! [They run inâJill. looks out at a Gallery SCENE IV. Enter Jack. AIR XXIV. Tune. âOur Polly is a sad slut.â Jack. For like to Jacky, young and small, You could not find another; They loved him still, in hopes he'd prove A man before his mother. For like to Jacky, &amp;c. Ha! do I travel then on fairy ground?â [Sees Jill. By what enchantment are my footsteps bound? What magic's this, that, with resistless art, Through ev'ry sense arrests my yielding heart? AIR XXV. Tune. âDeliaâby Arne.â Jack. O form'd of harmony and light, Too bright for sense to bear! Art thou, to feeling, as to sight, Essential as thou art fair?â If some illusion from the skies, In pity yet delay; Nor melt, sweet object, from my eyes, In fleeting notes away! Jill. Fair youth, by you I'd have it understood, That I am form'd of kindly flesh and blood. But sayâfor joy and wonder strikes me dumbâ Who, whence, and how, and wherefore art thou come? Speak! art thou of a blessed mother bornâ Or, as I fear, some infant of the morn? Ah me! thou tread'st upon a fearful ground! Five dreadful Dragons guard this pile aroundâ Fraud, Favour, Office, Interest, and Law, Lords of the passâand keep the world in awe. Me, Jillian Justice, here their powers confine, A princess born, and of a race divine! A maid, immured from ev'ry mother's son; In spight of Heaven, and her own will, a nun! Jack. And art thou, then, that Goddess of the land, Whose absence many weep, whose presence all demand? Jill. Even sheâ Who from her native seat by Giants torn, Too late her country and her kindred mourn. Jack. Thee have I sought through many a weary way, Through many a darksome night and toilsome day; To find, to free, to lift thy state on highâ Thou my sworn Lady, thy sworn champion I! And now 'tis given at length to face thy foe, And lay the pride of tall oppression low. Jill. Say then, for I am lost 'twixt joy and fearâ Who, and by what new wonder art thou here? Jack. A Briton humbly born, unknown to fame, To camps, or courts; and Johnny Good my name. Jill. Joy then to Jillianâfor we are near in blood: Our Grandsire was the same, the First that ere was Good! To charm the Dragons, say, who taught the art? Jack. A Guiltless Conscience, and a Valiant Heart. Jill. Ah!â Jack. What alarms my Jilly? Jill. Look you there!â The Gi!âthe Giants, Jacky!âO beware! Jack. Psha! let them comeâ Jill. Fly, fly, or I will hate youâ Fly my dear Jackâindeed, indeed, they'll eat you! Jack. Fear not; but mark what little men can do, Whose powers and prowess are inspired by you! Jill. Rash boy, awayâon that allegiance, go, Which all Knights-Errant to their Ladies owe! Fly, I command, on my imperial willâ And in my Jacky's safety, save his Jill! AIR XXVI. Tune. âFor Willy is the Lad the Lad for me.â Jack. Though painful 'tis to partâand O, how sweet to stayâ And something here would tell me, I cannot live away. My Princess yet commands me, and who shall say her nay? The Lady of my life, to death I will obey; For Jilly is the Queen of maids and May! Jill. O haste my Knight, my darling Jack away! Jack. For Jilly is the Queen of maids and May! Jill. O haste my Knight, my darling Jack away! [Exeunt. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Three Giants enter. Rumb. Be sure, my honour'd lord, tho' now you stand The first in power, and overlook the landâ Envy forecasts your fall in many a breast; And some still dare to be your foes profest. Galig. It matters notâlet Impotence repine; Mine is a claim beyond the royal line. By their own appetites the croud I sway, And where Vice rules, Corruption must obey. All wrath and turbulence will quickly cease, And each man bear his proper load in peace. AIR XXVII. Tune. âSwaggering roaring Willy.â I. To mortals so sweet was power, That bone of all worldly strife! Like husband and wife, each hour, They snarl'd and tugg'd thro' life: But now, from Wales to Wapping, As settled by one and all, Like coblers each stands a strapping, Yet rules within his stall. II. Your Commons are kick'd by your Giant, Your Colonel he kicks his Corps; Your Patron he kicks his Client, Your Soldier he kicks his Whore. The Whore again kicks her Cully; Court Waiters are kick'd at call; And all will be kick'd yet bully, While Interest kicks the Ball. Galig. Saw you the princess Justice, as I bid? [To Blund. Blund. My honour'd brother and true lord, I did: But such a sudden fit possest her Grace, I scarce durst look her Highness in the face. She at your message turn'd all fiery red, And hurl'd your princely present at my head. Galig. That truely savour'd something of unkind: She has, 'tis like, some lover in the wind, Some favour'd knight who waits within her call, Haply to plot her freedom, and our fall. Watch thou at hand; and if it shall appear, [To Blund. That such a foe hath found strange entrance here; Give him this Writ, that, by supreme command, Requires he instantly abjure the land. Blund. Now, and for ever, to my best, I shall perform your high behest. [Exit Blund. Galig. To-day I shall apply my utmost skill, To bend this haughty Princess to my will.

I live the slave of your request; Your will is done, when once exprest. Galig. Mean while assume thy province straight, And gather in the taxes of the state. It is a Voluntary List, you seeâ [Gives a paper. Expectants all, and what they grant is free. Take thou their offerings with becoming grace, And give to each, in lieuâthe promise of a place. Hope is the food on which Expectants live; 'Tis also allâwe ever mean to give. [Rumb. bows, and exit. AIR XXVIII. Tune. âTipteleru.â I. If men would but remark it, Through every scene display'd; The world is one great market, Its institutes all a trade. II. And in this social chaffer, Each man, as in duty bound, Still labours to be the laugher, And jockey his neighbours round. III. With joy the Jobber will own he Has nicked you in the price, Like Lawyers who, for good money, Give nothing but bad advice. IV. The Miller he bites the Tiller, For Millers out-bite belief; The Thief again bites the Miller, The Devil he bites the Thief. V. Yet Satan, who is no drivel, Confesses, upon the whole, Your Miser can bite the Devil, And sell him a worthless soul. VI. Young Appetite bids for Pleasure, Old Appetite bids for Youth; Grey Avarice bids for Treasure, Grey Satan he bids for Truth. VII. But Soul, Truth, Treasure, and Pleasure, The Devil, or what may fall, To Giants prescribe no measure; I bid at one and all. Gall. Jillian, bright goddess! from thy sphere [Knocking at the Tower. Behold who waits, thine humble suppliant here. Jill. For what would my imperial master sue? With Justice what has Ill-got Power to do? Gall. Reformed, to Justice fair I bowâ No more your sov'reign, but your subject now. Come, taste the blessings that await The empire of the Great.â Jill. There is a state I wish to gainâ Gall. O speak it, and at once obtain! Jill. Procure the Virtues for my train. Gall. No such stern monitors we own, Foes to the pleasures of a Throne! Far other friends our thoughts employ, Sons and daughters all of joy, Where laughter, young frolick, and pastime invite, To swim down the stream of redundant delight. AIR XXIX. Tune. âTwo Gossips they luckily met.â I. The Indies thy toilet shall grace; For thee, shall earth, ocean, and air, From the gin, and the net, and the chace, Each costly collation prepare. II. All seasons their sweets shall dispense, And a round of long happiness roll; And bliss, through the gates of each sense, Shall enter and mix with thy soul. III. Each day that the Graces shall bring, With new wreaths of delight shall be crown'd; And enjoyment the changes shall ring, Of life's merry circuit around. IV. Fair PhÃ¦be shall light up her horn, To watch the repose of thy charms; And each blushing and rapturous morn, Shall find thee dissolv'd in my arms. Jill. Hence, wretch!ânor dare to violate mine ear, With what 'twere worse than hell to feel, and almost death to hear. Gall. Proud maid! in vain my suit thou wouldst decline; In spight of Heaven and earth thou art mine. Elapsed is thine indulgent hour; And since thou wilt not share my grace, be taught to dread my power! Jill. Away! I fear not any wrongs from youâ The wrongs I fear, are those I fear to do. Gall. Beware when next we meet!âAdieu. [Exit Gall. SCENE CONTINUES. Jillian opens the door. RECITATIVE. Jill. The coast is clear, No Giants near!â Go, love! and whisper in my Johnny's ear, The coast is clear. AIR XXX. Tune. âBy the side of a murmuring stream.â Return thou loved cause of my pain, And the cares of thy Jilly dispel; To thee let her blushes explain, What her tongue cannot venture to tell. Ah! why has not Heav'n, since allied To all hearts that are loving and true, Some thread of fond sympathy tied, That might on occasion pull-to? SCENE II. Enter Jack. They embrace. Jill. My Jack! Jack. My Jilly! Jill. Am I then so blest?â Jack. Do I then clasp my charmer to my breast? Jill. What means that sudden pale on that sweet faceâ Thy trembling motion, and thy changing grace?â What is the matter? Jack. Sooth, I cannot tellâ 'Tis witchcraft, sure! Jill. I fear you are not well. Jack. A malady of sighsâa swimming kind Of pleasant sense, yet sickness of the mind! Jill. Best call a doctor! Jack. O!âI'd first endure A thousand deaths!âI could not bear a cureâ Jill. But now suppose you were indeed half deadâ Which Heaven forbid!âand wounded on your bed; What doctor would you send for? Jack. Ah! I feel, Your breath could balm, your hand alone could healâ And this puts to my mind a strong suggestion, That you're yourself the naughty witch in question. AIR XXXI. Tune. âOld Through the Wood Laddie.â Of an ailment so killingly sweet, I could die; For your sight it so charms me, Chills, changes, and warms me, That I wish, and I wishânor know wherefore, nor why; And my soul I could waft it away in a sigh. When absent, nor rest nor refreshment I find; Though alone you can cheer me, I tremble when near me, My senses grow all as bewitch'd as my mind, And my eyes on your eyes they could look themselves blind. Jill. Ah, Jacky! 'twill be foundâI fear it willâ That you are full as great a witch as Jill; And all the little skill I have to smatter, Informs me this is loveâ Jack. Is that the matter? That I do love, I do discern most clearly, My mother, sister, and good neighbours, dearlyâ But this is quite another thing! Jill. I know itâ For thus your Jilly sings, as said the poet. AIR XXXII. Tune. âNancy's to the Green Wood gone.â Of all the maladies that cleave To man, if that you moan, sir, Which no physician can relieve, Save only one alone, sirâ All sages in this case assure, The doctor is the datum; In love, the cause alone can cureâ A recipe probatum! Jack. Ah, Jilly, never was a truer sonnet! As sure as I am here, you've hit upon it. And yet who would have thought a thing so grievous, That one so sweet should be so much mischievous. Jill. Ah, Jacky! but that you're a simple guesser, You might have seen you were the first aggressor. And here I give you warning in this way, That I will study all the hurt I may. Jack. Nay, I do find the same intention too; And have as much revenge at heart, as you. Jill. Then let us to each other, maid and man, Do all the loving mischief that we can. Jack. A match!âO Jilly! while your hand I'm feeling, I tread the air, and dance along the ceiling. SCENE III. Blunderbore enters. Blund. Ay! Maid of May!âare these your tricks in June? Methinks we've watch'd your waters to some tune. You, whom we deem'd of mighty men the scorner, Can dally with your lambkin in a corner! A doughty Wight, I trow, to come a courtingâ I fear me, spark, that we shall spoil your sporting. This Trincum hereâ [Shews the writ. Jack. What would the muttering loon? Can't the great booby speak, without a spoon? Blund. Fair words would best become you in foul weather; You'll find your gallantry is pluck'd a feather. [Gives the Writ. Jack. O Jilly! here's a clap of cruel thunderâ It strikes at more than life, it rends the heart of love asunder. Blund. Come, master mine, no prate before you budge! The word is, âBag and baggage!ââTrudge, friend, trudge. Jack. Sirrah, no more, as you would scape chastising; I know my business without your advising. And but that Law and Magistracy's aiding, I'd dash your numskull from its brainless lading. Out of my sight.â Blund. The devil's in the elf. Egad, I believe he'd eat me!âSense takes care of self. [Exit Blund. Jill. Ah, Jacky, my sweet Jacky! must we part?â Woe fall the day, and woe befalls my heart! Jack. Comfort, my Love! it helps not to repineâ Theirs is one stroke; the next may soon be mine. Could I but catch these rascals from the court, I would not fail to show the country sport. Jill. Rather all wrongs ride on, all justice linger, Than risk my little Hero's little finger! Jack. Tut, were that devilish Wand of theirs once gone, I'd box 'em round, one down, t'other come on! But that, hereafterâfor the time will bear But one heart-breaking sigh, and one short parting tear! AIR XXXIII. Tune. âDremendoo.â DUET. I. Jack. For power and the laws they command me awayâ Their will I regret, but their word I obey. To the world's worst infliction no anguish I owe, But to part from my Jilly!â Jill. Thy Jilly will go To banishment with her love. Jack. O no, no, no! II. For danger, by day, must attend by my side; And darkness, by night, be my consort and guide. Jill. In danger and darkness, in weal and in woe, Still I will go with my loveâ Jack. O no, no, no! Jill. Yes, I will go with my loveâ Jack. O no, no, no! III. For honour forbids me, wherever I steer, To take from my country a treasure so dear. My life, and my death, to that country I owe; And death is in partingâyet Jacky must go! A thousand farewells in oneâ Both. Oh! oh! oh! oh!â As Jack is going on the opposite side, Jill recalls him. Jill. Jacky, my life! I had forgot to tellâ Who knows but all, mayhap, may yet be well. [Nurse enters. Nurse, bring the swordâquick, fly!â Ah, Jack! my terrors have again prevail'dâ For what canst thou perform, where all have fail'd? Couldst thou, O couldst thou, but this weapon free, All the world's Giants were but dwarfs to thee! [Nurse gives the sword. Jack. When cradled in my infant swathe I lay, Such feats as these I did esteem as play. [Draws the Sword. Jill. 'Tis out, 'tis outâthe world is all our own! Goodness and Justice, now, shall reign alone. Fy!âseize the miscreants at their boards or beds; And, in three chargers, bring me their three heads. Jack. Let not my Jilly be untimely warm, Nor seek to punish where she may reform. Sleep thou in peace, until the last extreme; Nor strive to ruin, till we can't redeem. Jill. Jacky, thy nobler precepts own I mustâ Though Justice is not always kind, yet Goodness still is just!

Like husband and wife, each hour, They snarl'd and tugg'd thro' life: But now, from Wales to Wapping, As settled by one and all, Like coblers each stands a strapping, Yet rules within his stall. II. Your Commons are kick'd by your Giant, Your Colonel he kicks his Corps; Your Patron he kicks his Client, Your Soldier he kicks his Whore.

With joy the Jobber will own he Has nicked you in the price, Like Lawyers who, for good money, Give nothing but bad advice. IV. The Miller he bites the Tiller, For Millers out-bite belief; The Thief again bites the Miller, The Devil he bites the Thief. V. Yet Satan, who is no drivel, Confesses, upon the whole, Your Miser can bite the Devil, And sell him a worthless soul. VI. Young Appetite bids for Pleasure, Old Appetite bids for Youth; Grey Avarice bids for Treasure, Grey Satan he bids for Truth. VII. But Soul, Truth, Treasure, and Pleasure, The Devil, or what may fall, To Giants prescribe no measure; I bid at one and all.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Galigantus seated at a table, several Grandees and Ladies attending on either hand. He waves his Wand, and all bow and curtesy to the ground. 1st Gran. My noble lordâif I may be so boldâ Gal. No hurry, friend! good places can keep cold. Clerk enters, with bundles of parchments. Clerk. May Heaven preserve your Greatness from the vapours! For here are such petitions, scrolls, and papers, To look them o'er no mortal eye is ableâ Gal. Then there's the moreââto lie upon the table.â SCENE II. Jack enters, and salutes the Company, the Chief Beggars behind him, with two Boxes. Galigantus waves his Wand; and starts from the Table, on perceiving that Jack does not move. Gal. Ha! friends! what sneaking rascal's this?âAdzooks! Who let him in?âI do not like his looks. Jack. Health and fair hopes to allâand little danger Of grace, I trust, and welcome to a stranger! Galig. What is thy name? Jack. John Good. Galig. Say'st thou, John Good? A family unheard of since the flood! What is thy trade? Jack. So please you, as trades go, The exhibition of a raree-show. Galig. A courtly occupation! Pray, let's hear. AIR XXXIV. Tune. âWho'll see my Gallantee Show?â Jack. I. I first present you a Prime Minister, Free from thought or action sinister; Public-Good his square and measure, Himself his country's trust, and treasure! Who'll shew me such a show? II. Here's Humility in high station; Dignity strip'd of Ostentation; Friendship here out-goes profession; Here is Power without Oppression. O the finest show! III. Who'll see Honesty in a Miser? Fops from France return the wiser? Wealthy Poets, and poor Receivers? Lawyers in future rewards believers? O the curious show! IV. Here's Dependence without Servility; Peers to Virtue who owe Nobility; This you scarce will credit till you see, Next, where Piety weds with Prelacy! Such a wondrous show! V. Courtly dames with Chastity laden; Widows in will, each soul a maiden; Nuns secluded from all temptation; Friars, and yet no fornication! A pound to see the show! Galig. Sure, of all lying rascals, thou'rt the chief! The least of these out-brazens all belief. What has your fellow got in yonder chest? Jack. Prime merchandize, the newest and the best! Galig. Produceâ AIR XXXV. Tune. âMeat for your Master.â Jack. I. To supply the defects of my country so dear, Has been the great bent of my labours. I have Glasses for those (tho' mayhap they're not here) Who are blind to the faults of their neighbours! II. Here are Cloaks for the covering of personal crimes, With charms of due magic enchanted; Pomatum and Wash for the scurf of the times, They were never so thoroughly wanted. III. Here are Crutches for those who in virtue are lame, And Stilts for support of high station; Sophistical Varnish to gloss a foul scheme, And patches for spots in the nation. IV. Here are Politic Scissars to slit a debate, And of parties to cut the best tether; And needles to stitch up the flaws of a state, And to sew rotten friendships together. Galig. A wondrous scheduleâor a wondrous lye! Whoe'er is conscious of his faults, may buy. All. Not I, not I. Galig. What's in thy casket? Jack. All exotic wareâ Curiosities for courtiers, rich and rare! Galig. Lets see thy trumpery? Jack. 'Tis cheap, to chatterâ You'll find the purchase no such easy matter. AIR XXXVI. Tune. âBonny Shoemaker.â I. Who will buy, who will buy, Who will purchase, without money; Gems of price, Neat and nice, Jewels bright and jewels bonny? II. Here they areâeach gem a star! Above the wealth the world can musterâ In the night, Affording light, Beyond the sun's meridian lustre! Jack. My lord, observe this casqueâhow free from stain! How pure, tho' homely; and how neat, tho' plain! How wonderfully decent! Galig. What a pox! Why, I see nothing, but a pedling box! Jack. This is called Modestyâa simple case!â Its wealth is in its Bosom, not its Face. AIR XXXVII. Tune. âPudreen Mare.â Come all ye gay gallants, for pleasure who proul; Come all ye young racers, who strain for the goal; Come all ye stout wrestlers, who strive on the plain; Come all ye fond merchants, who trade on the main! Come all, who expend your short candle, in quest Of phantoms, still followed, and still unpossessed! In vain you search, wander, strain, struggle, and steerâ The Prize you all wrestled and run for, lay here! Jack. Now all, whose eyes are proof to living fireâ Behold, remark, examine, and admire! [Opens the Box. Galig. What, do you bam us, rogue? Beware your bones!â The devil a thing I see but pebble stonesâ What say you, sir? Gent. Your lordship grows facetious: Though I'm no chap, I own the stones are precious. Jack. Your bats and buzzards only see by night; But want of eyes is not the want of light. Observe, that these Two Gems are from aboveâ These two eternal brilliants, Truth and Love! From whose bright chips and polish, were compiled These living sparks, and thence the Virtues styled; Once joined and visible on Aaron's breastâ Now rarely seen, and partially possest! AIR XXXVIII. Tune. âSuba roo roo.â Who will buy, who will buy? Observe, and you'll own, sir, In each radiant stone, sir, Is pictured the virtue, And grace they refer to. Will you buy, sir! Jack takes a Gem from his Casket. AIR XXXIX. Tune. âBohil-beg-buee.â Here probity stands confest, His truth on his visage exprest; For his face is of kin to the beauty within, That keeps festival still in his breast. Miser. What's your demand for this? Jack. Your cent. per cent. Which Heaven to man as to a factor lent; Not to be idly piled, but freely used; Not to be cramped and buried, but diffused. When I would part the miser and his store, I ask him not to give, but to restore. AIR XL. Tune. âMy Minny thought lang.â For see, with how blithsome and courteous a grace, Your friend Hospitality shows you his face! His heart is as open and kind, as his inn; And holds the same cheer and free welcome within. His heart, &amp;c. Jack. Who offers now? Lady. Pray, let me seeâ What do you call this jewel? Jack. Charity! A gem of curious powers, that can excite From anguish transport, and from tears delight. AIR XLI. Tune. âMy Father and Mother sent me far.â For to her wealth all spent on want, Where Charity's reclined, The moving tale of wretchedness, Still rolling in her mindâ Her sighs and tears are still a fund Of bounty in distress; And she delights to share the woe, She can no more redress. Lady. Thanks for your whining comment, and your text! But keep your pleasant tears for who comes next. Bully. The name, and price, of this? Jack. It is a stone All Bullies want, yet would be thought to own; 'Tis Courage, sir!âto gain it, you must part A conscience that runs trembling to your heart; That shuns the light, that supplicates the shade, Yet starts amid the gloom itself has made. AIR XLII. Tune. âBallin a Mony oroo.â On what a firm rock here does Fortitude fix! Around him, in war, all the elements mix. The hurricane rages, the tempest it boils; Loud thunders are launch'd at his head, and he smiles. Lady. My little gentleman, so pert and queer, What must I give you for this trifle here? Jack. Your insolence of riches, that mislead Your steps from real wealth, and make you poor indeed. AIR XLIII. Tune. âÃneas wandering Prince of Troy.â Humility, her crown aside, Here stoops to wash the feet of Pride: Averse to all the world calls great, She fain would fall and sink from state; Yet sink, or fall, howe'er she will, She finds the world beneath her still. Lady. Your pleasure for this gem so bright and strange? I barter all my fortune, in exchange. Jack. Demand some other timeâyou offer wellâ The price, in public, I'm right loth to tell. AIR XLIV. Tune. âPast one o'Clock.â How mild, in this ruby, pale Chastity flushes, And tinctures with crimson her form of light! Unconscious of guilt at her beauty she blushes, And wraps each proportion and charm from sight. All hush'd as rock'd infants, all sweet as the folding rose, Her lips with reluctance the balm of her breath disclose: Her eyes look abashed at their brightness; yet still she shows Brighter, by veiling whate'er is bright. Lady. What may you call this pearl? Jack. 'Tis Reputationâ Of price immense, to ladies in your station! Lady. What's the demand? AIR XLV. Tune. âThe bonny Christ Church Bells.â Jack. Would you wear This Pearl so rare, Then, Fair one, list to meâ First, learn the skill, Your tongue to still, And leave the name And honest fame Of others free. Your tittle tattle, Prate and prattle, Rake and rattle, all Due victims to this pearl must fall; Your joys For toys, Of folly, fops, and noise, That noon and night the toyshop of your heart employs; The sidelong glance, And kindling dance, Minc'd mein and conscious eye; With foibles, which, you know, In shame I spare to showâ [Lady turns off. A price, I see, too high! With foibles, &amp;c. Galig. I oft have heard of Virtue and her store; But never saw the frippery before. Yet there is one, that seems not much amiss; It bears some show of worthâwhat call you this? Jack. Honour, my lord; a secondary stone! It waits on Honestyâtake both, or none. Galig. Speak out your full demand. AIR XLVI. Tune. âBumpers Squire Jones.â Jack. I. Since, sir, you require Me, with freedom, to tell you the price I desireâ If duely obey'd, I must claim all your shifts, Mean resources, sly drifts, And whole system of trade; Each method of weaving Court nets for enslaving, Your chaffer for conscience, by barter and lure, State quacks, and state nurses, Your purging of purses, And skinning of wounds which you wish not to cure. II. Each subtle essay Of spreading corruption, in order for sway; All projects for rule, By the bait and the bribe, And political tribe Of trick, traffic, and tool; Your court broom that gathers Moats, chaff, straw, and feathers, And sweeps up all trash from the surface of life; With your largess of graces, Posts, pensions, and places, Where talents and office are ever at strife. III. With these I must claim, Your entry of red coated gentry, who dream That heroes are made, and enabled to kill, By the courage and skill Of a dreadful cockadeâ A race, who are prouder To spend their sweet powder At balls, than on bullets; a terrible train Of crimp petit maitres, Nice seamsters and plaiters, Beaud out for the dance of a dainty campaign! Galig. Impudent elf!âAs I hope for salvation, The rascal would unofficer the nation; Rout our assemblies; and our senates chouse Of the best busts, and statues, in the house. Sirrah, your specious offers, are a scurvy Attempt to turn the country topsy turvy! But should this chanceâwho, think you, such an ass is, As e'er to build on your new fangled basis? We'll none of your sham treasury! AIR XLVII. Tune. âYe Fairy Elves that be.â Galig. I. Come follow, follow me, Ye jolly boys all, who be Divested of constraint From mortified saw or saint; To pleasure, and prank, and pastime free, Come follow, follow, follow me! To prank, and pleasure, and pastime free, Come follow, follow, follow me! II. Let lean-ey'd Honesty bear His merited weight of care, And phlegm and conscience dwell In cynical tub or cell; But all ye lovers of game, and glee, And feast, and frolick, come follow me! To pleasure, and prank, and pastime free, Come follow, follow, follow me! III. The pedanted priest, who fain Would ride, but wants a rein; To moral us into controul, Would sour the jovial soulâ The priest is cunning, and so are we; Then priest, and people, come follow me! From scruple, and qualm, and conscience, free, Come follow, follow, follow me! [They all follow him round the Stage. SCENE II. Jillian Justice forcibly brought in by Rumbo and Blunderbore. Jill. Help, countrymen!âyour timely aid I prayâ Or Justice is undone, forever and a-day! Jack. The cry of Justice!âthen 'tis time to draw The mighty sword of Gideon and the Law. [Draws. Galigantus drops his Wand, and his Brothers quit Jillian, and stand amazed. Galig. A sudden gripe arrests my heartâ A chillness runs through all my veins, and freezes every part! Jack. Here, seize these caitiffs!âbind them, without favour, To strange societyâa good behaviour! [Giants seized. Jill. To Goodness, Justice ever knew The Rod of Power alone was due! [She takes up the Golden Wand and delivers it to Jack. Nurse, give me up those implements intrusted, To have all wrongs redress'd, all rights adjusted! Here, take them, Jackyâlet them be applied, As Kindness to your Country shall decide! Gives him a pair of gilt gloves, fastened together by a chain; a pair of gilt spurs, fastened in like manner; and a gorgeous collar, with a rope at the end of it. Jack. First, with these manacles, in this good hour, We bind the struggling hand of Ill-Used Power. Here, fix them on.â [Chief Beggar takes the Gloves, fits them on, and sings. AIR XLVIII. Tune. âTip ta leraâ Ch. Beg. These gauntlets we understand, From annals time out of mind, Have given due weight to each hand Of the bruisers of mankind. Still apt to his occupation, Whom no restriction awes; Whose courage would cuff a nation, And quell both land and laws. Still apt, &amp;c. Jack. As Violence is rash, and swift in speed, Let these restraining fetters be his meed! On with them, firm. AIR XLIX. Tune. âYe Commons and Peers.â Ch. Beg. I. Behold, from old times, Through all customs and climes, A prize to Ambition allied! 'Tis a gift, my good sirs, For him, who wants Spurs On the Back of his Country to ride. Toll de rol, &amp;c. II. No vaulter from France, With parade and with prance, With the curvets of him can compare, Thus accoutred in sight Of the mob, who has right To a dance on the stately Dun Mareâ Dol de rol, &amp;c. CHORUS. To a dance on the stately, &amp;c. Jack. Last, o'er his brothers, to the public eye, Let All-defrauding Wrong be raised on high! Here is the patent for his exaltationâ Ambition could not wish a higher station. Ch. Beg. Your marrow-bonesâcome down, sir; [To Blund. That we may reach to quip you for renown, sir. AIR L. Tune. âOld Roger.â Ch. Beg. shews the Collar, while he sings the first verse; and, during the second, the other Beggar sits it on. Ch. Beg. I. Sir, here is the zoneâ Dil diddle dum, &amp;c. By whose virtues alone, Dol, &amp;c. Deservers are known, Dol. &amp;c. To look down on a throne. Dol, &amp;c. II. Within the fair round, Dol diddle dum, &amp;c. Such magic is found, Dol, &amp;c. You bid, with one bound, Dol, &amp;c. Adieu to the ground! Dol, &amp;c. Ch. Beg. Up friend, along!â Blund. I would it were to dinnerâ Mercy, sweet people, on a grievous sinner! 1st Shep. Bless us from such an end of honest labours! Who would have thought they look'd so little, neighbours? Jill. IÃ² triumphÃ¨! Glory and renown To Jacky, who has pull'd the Giants down! Give all your caps and voices to his dayâ May Goodness still be great! All. Huzza, huzza, huzza!â Ch. Beg. Look, look, my friends, in Jacky's faithful hand, Already this is quite another wandâ The rod with which great Moses cleft the sea, And with his people passed from Bonds away! A Twig, e'er Adam list'ned to his wife, Pluck'd from the tree of Paradise and Life! AIR LI. Tune. âYe Fairy Elves that be.â I. Jack. Arise, arise, arise, Each shape, and sort, and size, Of Honesty, where ye lie Unheeded on dank or dry; From cottages, sheds, and steds, to Court, My Brothers of Worth and Want resort! Arise to labour, arise to play, For Virtue dawns a new-born day! CHORUS. Arise to labour, &amp;c. II. To Court, to Court, repair, Tho' destitute poor and bare; And yet unskill'd in aught That Euclid or Machiavel taughtâ By naked Probity you acquire A garb, beyond the silk of Tyre; And every talent, and every art, Is furnish'd in an Upright Heart! CHORUS. And every talent, &amp;c. III. Let Jollity e'en devour His interval of an hour; Yet pity his transient roar, For listâand he laughs no more! The purest pleasures that Guilt can bring, Is like the tickling of a stingâ The tickling leaves no sweet behind; The sting remains, and stabs the mind! CHORUS. The tickling leaves, &amp;c. IV. But Virtue, in the breast, Composes her Halcyon nest, And sooths and smooths each storm That would the fair seat deform; Herself most frolick, and sweetly free, To cordial jollity cordial glee, The fountain of all that's blest and bright, Of orient pleasure, of orient light! CHORUS. The fountain, &amp;c. V. And from this Mental Dawn, O'er village, and lake, and lawn, New Radiance shall expand, To lighten a dusky land; And Truth, from this Approving Stage, Shall beam through every act and age! CHORUS.

Tune. âÃneas wandering Prince of Troy.â Humility, her crown aside, Here stoops to wash the feet of Pride: Averse to all the world calls great, She fain would fall and sink from state; Yet sink, or fall, howe'er she will, She finds the world beneath her still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AIR XLIV. Tune. âPast one o'Clock.â How mild, in this ruby, pale Chastity flushes, And tinctures with crimson her form of light! Unconscious of guilt at her beauty she blushes, And wraps each proportion and charm from sight. All hush'd as rock'd infants, all sweet as the folding rose, Her lips with reluctance the balm of her breath disclose: Her eyes look abashed at their brightness; yet still she shows Brighter, by veiling whate'er is bright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AIR XLV. Tune. âThe bonny Christ Church Bells.â Jack. Would you wear This Pearl so rare, Then, Fair one, list to meâ First, learn the skill, Your tongue to still, And leave the name And honest fame Of others free. Your tittle tattle, Prate and prattle, Rake and rattle, all Due victims to this pearl must fall; Your joys For toys, Of folly, fops, and noise, That noon and night the toyshop of your heart employs; The sidelong glance, And kindling dance, Minc'd mein and conscious eye; With foibles, which, you know, In shame I spare to showâ [Lady turns off. A price, I see, too high! With foibles, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AIR XLVI. Tune. âBumpers Squire Jones.â Jack. I. Since, sir, you require Me, with freedom, to tell you the price I desireâ If duely obey'd, I must claim all your shifts, Mean resources, sly drifts, And whole system of trade; Each method of weaving Court nets for enslaving, Your chaffer for conscience, by barter and lure, State quacks, and state nurses, Your purging of purses, And skinning of wounds which you wish not to cure. II. Each subtle essay Of spreading corruption, in order for sway; All projects for rule, By the bait and the bribe, And political tribe Of trick, traffic, and tool; Your court broom that gathers Moats, chaff, straw, and feathers, And sweeps up all trash from the surface of life; With your largess of graces, Posts, pensions, and places, Where talents and office are ever at strife. III. With these I must claim, Your entry of red coated gentry, who dream That heroes are made, and enabled to kill, By the courage and skill Of a dreadful cockadeâ A race, who are prouder To spend their sweet powder At balls, than on bullets; a terrible train Of crimp petit maitres, Nice seamsters and plaiters, Beaud out for the dance of a dainty campaign!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AIR XLVII. Tune. âYe Fairy Elves that be.â Galig. I. Come follow, follow me, Ye jolly boys all, who be Divested of constraint From mortified saw or saint; To pleasure, and prank, and pastime free, Come follow, follow, follow me! To prank, and pleasure, and pastime free, Come follow, follow, follow me! II. Let lean-ey'd Honesty bear His merited weight of care, And phlegm and conscience dwell In cynical tub or cell; But all ye lovers of game, and glee, And feast, and frolick, come follow me! To pleasure, and prank, and pastime free, Come follow, follow, follow me! III. The pedanted priest, who fain Would ride, but wants a rein; To moral us into controul, Would sour the jovial soulâ The priest is cunning, and so are we; Then priest, and people, come follow me! From scruple, and qualm, and conscience, free, Come follow, follow, follow me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AIR XLVIII. Tune. âTip ta leraâ Ch. Beg. These gauntlets we understand, From annals time out of mind, Have given due weight to each hand Of the bruisers of mankind. Still apt to his occupation, Whom no restriction awes; Whose courage would cuff a nation, And quell both land and laws. Still apt, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AIR XLIX. Tune. âYe Commons and Peers.â Ch. Beg. I. Behold, from old times, Through all customs and climes, A prize to Ambition allied! 'Tis a gift, my good sirs, For him, who wants Spurs On the Back of his Country to ride. Toll de rol, &amp;c. II. No vaulter from France, With parade and with prance, With the curvets of him can compare, Thus accoutred in sight Of the mob, who has right To a dance on the stately Dun Mareâ Dol de rol, &amp;c. CHORUS. To a dance on the stately, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AIR L. Tune. âOld Roger.â Ch. Beg. shews the Collar, while he sings the first verse; and, during the second, the other Beggar sits it on. Ch. Beg. I. Sir, here is the zoneâ Dil diddle dum, &amp;c. By whose virtues alone, Dol, &amp;c. Deservers are known, Dol. &amp;c. To look down on a throne. Dol, &amp;c. II. Within the fair round, Dol diddle dum, &amp;c. Such magic is found, Dol, &amp;c. You bid, with one bound, Dol, &amp;c. Adieu to the ground! Dol, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AIR LI. Tune. âYe Fairy Elves that be.â I. Jack. Arise, arise, arise, Each shape, and sort, and size, Of Honesty, where ye lie Unheeded on dank or dry; From cottages, sheds, and steds, to Court, My Brothers of Worth and Want resort! Arise to labour, arise to play, For Virtue dawns a new-born day! CHORUS. Arise to labour, &amp;c. II. To Court, to Court, repair, Tho' destitute poor and bare; And yet unskill'd in aught That Euclid or Machiavel taughtâ By naked Probity you acquire A garb, beyond the silk of Tyre; And every talent, and every art, Is furnish'd in an Upright Heart! CHORUS. And every talent, &amp;c. III. Let Jollity e'en devour His interval of an hour; Yet pity his transient roar, For listâand he laughs no more! The purest pleasures that Guilt can bring, Is like the tickling of a stingâ The tickling leaves no sweet behind; The sting remains, and stabs the mind! CHORUS. The tickling leaves, &amp;c. IV. But Virtue, in the breast, Composes her Halcyon nest, And sooths and smooths each storm That would the fair seat deform; Herself most frolick, and sweetly free, To cordial jollity cordial glee, The fountain of all that's blest and bright, Of orient pleasure, of orient light! CHORUS. The fountain, &amp;c. V. And from this Mental Dawn, O'er village, and lake, and lawn, New Radiance shall expand, To lighten a dusky land; And Truth, from this Approving Stage, Shall beam through every act and age! CHORUS. And Truth, from this Approving Stage, Shall beam through every act and age!</field>
