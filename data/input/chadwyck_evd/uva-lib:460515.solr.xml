      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene.âA Terrace in the Garden of the Mansion of Don John de Padilla, in the neighbourhood of Toledo, overlooking the Cityâin an Alcove, on one side, a Table with covers set for four personsâbeyond the City a range of Mountains, through a gorge of which the Tagus flowsâapproaching Sunset. As the curtain rises, Lopez, the old Servant, and Florio, a Page, are discovered arranging the Table in the Alcove; they come forward. FLORIO. Can this be all? Is this the feast to grace The birthday of our master's only sonâ And such a son? This simple fare prepared Only for four? Well! in my rustic home A birthday, even my own, though I am youngest Of many peasant children, fill'd our valley With mirth till nightfall. I believed the love Which doats on young Alphonso would find scope In such majestic feasting as would win Toledo's wonder, and set loose with joy The hearts of all our household. LOPEZ. Thoughtless child! And yet I should not blame your careless age, That cannot guess the weight of such regard As fathers like our master bear their sons, Least noted when most prideful; but no lack Of feasting will be ours; though, thus apart, The parents and their son, without a guest Except our lady's brother, who partook The first great venture through the western seas, And since has lived as restless as the waves With which he held long fellowship, will share This frugal banquet;âwe, in the hall, festoon'd With myrtles and full orange boughs, shall drain Cups without stint of generous wine, and keep The dance alive till midnight. FLORIO. Shall all dance? LOPEZ. Unless you choose to play the looker-on; Even Iâlaugh, if you willâbut there are seasons When all who truly tasted youth resume it, And this is one of mine. FLORIO. May a young servant Ask, without blame, if always, on this day, Our gracious master, who so often holds High festival with liberal pomp, contracts His wonted state? LOPEZ. He has kept this birthday thus, Since a fair girlâhalf of his household's youthâ Was taken hence. I have heard her parents tell How she drew after her such earnest thoughts As in this season, which renews their spring-time, Make them almost partakers of the home Where she awaits them. Lovely child! she bore A regal but unhappy name, derived From glorious Isabella's mournful heiress, And wasted from the world as that great lady Shrunk into solitude. FLORIO. The Queen Joanna; She who they say is lunatic? LOPEZ. Beware! Let not your master hear you drop a word Which may touch lightly on that sacred grief, Unless you'd rouse a hurricane of wrath Past all you guess of anger. FLORIO. How of wrathâ Our master seems most gentle? LOPEZ. So he is, And most of all indulgent in respects That touch himself;âplay truant when he needs A page's tending most, neglect to bring His horse when he is bent on speed, forget Half of some urgent message,âif he chide you, It will be in a tone so mild, with look So like a father's smiling on the excess Of a son's heedless mirth, that you shall wait, When he has ceased, as wondering the rebuke Is past, and almost wishing it prolong'd; But let a word or smile betray the lack Of duteous reverence for the things he deems Holy in earth or heaven, and you shall stand Shivering before him with lock'd hands, nor dare To fly, to kneel, or to withdraw your eyes From his, or shape a wish but that the earth Would open and enfold you. Run and help To wreath the hall for dancing;âwhy you stand Aghast, as if in doubt what dancing means: What ails you? FLORIO. Nothing but the fear you raise Of such an anger. LOPEZ. Then be light of heart; Only continue guileless and obedient As I believe you are, and you will live here In toils as light, and gallant sports as free, As you were born thrice noble. Trip away. [Exit Florio. The sun declines; what can detain my master? Enter the Marquis de Mondeiar. MONDEIAR. What! Vegetating still with ruddy cheek As twenty summers sinceâlike yonder dial O'er-grown by the huge sycamore, that, touch'd No longer by the sunbeam, shows no trace Of coursing time? My sister comes; go in, And bid the house be merry. LOPEZ. Peace be with you. [Exit Lopez. MONDEIAR. I will not say Amen to prayers for peaceâ Let all break now! Enter Donna Maria de Pachecho. MONDEIAR. The blessings of the day Surround you, sister! But I look in vain For its young hero and his sire; 'tis graceless To own impatience in a time so happy, But eager thoughts forestall the approaching night, Which must not veil us without one hour spent With those I soon may part from. MARIA. Eager thoughtsâ A threat of parting!âAre you tamed at last, Subdued to beg from some fair conqueror One little evening hour for older loves? So speeds a new-born tyranny! Dear brother, Whose absolute beauty rules your time? MONDEIAR. Forbear! There is a sterner and a nobler mistress Than one of mortal loveliness that rules My anxious moments now: but what impedes Padilla and Alphonso? I must quaff One ancient round of healths, or my next year Will roll unbless'd. MARIA (pointing). Do you discern a thread Of white against the sky, that glistens touch'd By the last sunbeams, while the shelving crags, That open to disclose it, lie in shade? Our boy, who knows it as the loftiest peak Our region boasts, won from his father promise That, on this birthday, he should make the trial To reach its summit; before dawn they started, And have not yet return'd; the way is longâ Across the cityâ MONDEIAR. True; across the cityâ They may have been detain'dâacross the city? MARIA. What then? There's not a heart within its walls, From that which is most quick with generous promptings, To vilest outcast's that retains one pulse Of good not wholly numb'd, that would not break To serve Padilla; noâI cannot fear Aught in Toledo. MONDEIAR. I spoke not of danger. Hark! Is there not a rushâa shoutâa murmur? MARIA. What is it that you fear? MONDEIAR. Fear? Lest the crowds That throng the streets, with too impatient love, May stay his passage, and before the time Speak their desire. You smile, as if your heart, Your high and towering heart, foreknew and hail'd My news unspoken. 'Neath yon glistening roofs Huge thoughts and towering passions wait the hour When they shall rend and scatter to the winds The feeble bonds that curb them. Blistering shame For nation, mighty as Castile, transferr'd By a slight youth to alien rule, and scorn Of his ignoble instruments, have wing'd A people's strong conviction, which a day, An hour, may see triumphant. Hark! There's life In yonder streets. MARIA. Go onâthere is no soundâ Speak on. MONDEIAR. No sound? It may be so, for silence In its depth speaks; of late the healthy breath Of daily life has stopp'd; the workman casts His tools in restless languor down, and joins Some cluster'd troop of idlers in the sun, Who seek no pastime, but seem met to gaze With wonder on each other; each surveys The face of each, as if he read strange thoughts, And yet they only speak of common things, And that in hurried whispers; children stand Perplex'd amid their toys: while mothers cleave, With arms grown rigid, to their husbands' breasts And eyes upturn'd, as if they strove for words To ask the meaning of the nameless fear That creeps along their heartstrings; but that silence Shall break; one war-cry from a leader's lips Will change it into thunder; but, alas! The people want a leader. MARIA. You shall lead them. MONDEIAR. Not I, Maria; I can strike and bleed, But own no power of sympathy which moulds The passions of a mighty nation roused For noblest issues. 'Tis not grace to wear A life as lightly as a festal plume For fortune's breeze to trifle with, and turn A panic-stricken legion by exploit Of desperate valour, that endows a chief For strife like ours: no; he who would direct A people in its rising, must be calm As death is, yet respond to every pulse Of passion'd millions,âas yon slender moon That scarce commends the modest light it sheds Through sunset's glory to the gazer's sense, In all its changes, in eclipse, in storm, Enthroned in azure, or enriching clouds That, in their wildest hurry, catch its softness, Will sway the impulsive ocean, he must rule By strength allied to weakness, yet supreme, Man's heaving soul, and bid it ebb and flow In sorrow, passion, glory, as he mourns, Struggles, or triumphs. MARIA. You intend my husband? MONDEIAR. Yes. Will you urge him to his glorious work? Let me unfold our cause. MARIA. Your cause! I seek No knowledge of your cause, a thing of words; It is the Man whose nature God arrays In semblance of His greatness that inflames And stamps the cause. Padilla was not born That an adoring household should surmise The might his goodness veils; let him command, Conquer, and govern, and the cause of earth And heaven shall triumph in his reign. MONDEIAR. It shall! I hear his footstep; we must break all gently If we would see him leader. MARIA. I shall see him; The hour is come: lie still my bounding heart; The hour is come. [Enter Padilla and Alphonso, followed by Florio. Padilla unbuckles his sword-belt, and gives his sword to Florio, who goes out with it. PADILLA. Accuse us not as loiterers; We made our horses fly, till this gay horseman, Who loves them, I believe, almost as well As he loves us, cried shame upon our speed: Yet sunset chides us. MONDEIAR. Was your way delay'd By concourse in Toledo? PADILLA. No; its streets Were strangely void, as if its men had fled From portents of a hurricane; the fault Lay in my judgment that too lightly scann'd The distance of the pinnacle we sought And found entrench'd amidst the hills it crowns By rock-cleft gorges; yet 'twas full reward For painful struggles through the granite wilds To watch my brave companion, as with step Airy and true, he scaled the pillar'd top With head erect, while crumbling fragments broke To dust beneath each footstep, till he trod The glassy summit, never touch'd till then Save by the bolt that splinter'd it, serene As if a wing, too fine for mortal sight, Upbore him, while slant sunbeams graced his brow With diadem of light. MONDEIAR. So may he stand Irradiate, when the crown of old Castile Shall wreathe that brow! PADILLA. The crown of old Castile!â The glorious realm of which he is the childâ The realm for which, although no oath has yet Laid weight upon his boyhood, all his veins Would proudly pour their blood! Forbid such thought Wing'd by the demon of a dream should break Through his light slumber! What is it distracts you? MARIA. 'Twas but a harmless birthday wish, which love Shaped in delighted sportiveness, and love Alone has listen'd to. PADILLA. A harmless wish! And this from you, Maria! Were he born To tread the lowliest course of peasant life It were a false affection to desire His fever'd struggle and his loftier fortune, Instead of calm endeavour to adorn The rank assign'd him by his God, with grace That brave obedience nurtures; but for himâ Born a Castilian nobleman in faith Unvex'd by doubt, to duties which are bright With glorious requisitions and rewards, What can be wish'd, but that he live and die Worthy his lot, not raised in hope above Nor sunk in deed beneath it? Yet you wish For such a youth a crown he cannot wear But by the base success of treason! Brother, Rather than this fair nurseling of Castile Should grasp her crown, I'd see him bend his head In meek submission to her sword upraised To slay him falsely doom'd. Great Heaven! he's pale: A blackness trembles on his faceâ'tis goneâ What ails you, my Alphonso? Did my words Sicken your heart with images of death? Think them most idle. ALPHONSO. No; I felt not sickness; Strange were it, if one school'd as I have been, Should quail at thoughts of death, and stranger still When you awake them. PADILLA. Pale again! some grief Is struggling through the veil that wraps our Present, In portentsâHeaven avert it from the brow Of youth, to strike the elder! But this birth-night Was meant for joy; whate'er the future bears, Let gratitude fill this. [They turn to the Alcove, and begin to take their places at the table. Enter Lopez. LOPEZ. A royal officer, Who gives his name Gonsalvo, craves a word With you alone. PADILLA. Gonsalvoâcan it be The same with whom I shared a page's schooling When the great Marquis of Cadiz allow'd us His household's discipline? Another time Right gladly had I welcomed himâbut nowâ Comes he alone? LOPEZ. A band of soldiers, rude Of speech, attend him; they have piled their swords And helmets in the court, as if they thought To sojourn with us. PADILLA. Give them food and wine, And lead Gonsalvo hither. [Exit Lopez. If he stands As I have heard, high in the Regent's favour, He is too prosperous to waste time on me, And soon will leave us to piece out the joy Of this chance-ravell'd hour. MONDEIAR. Meanwhile I'll find Due welcome for your martial guests. [Aside to Maria. Thank Heaven Toledo's ready for them. [Aloud. Sister, come, We shall find work within. PADILLA. You'll find the feast Spread for our household in the hall; be sure The soldiers are made welcome. [Exeunt Mondeiar, Maria, and Alphonso. PADILLA (alone). Here's their officerâ How alter'd from the bright and wayward boy With whom I often wrestled, sometimes fought, And, though not earnest in affection, liked The better for our conflicts. Shall I seem As changed to him? Enter Gonsalvo. PADILLA. Old playmate, you are welcome; You come upon the birthday of my son, Who on this day attains the happy age At which we parted. You must drain one goblet Before you say that anything more urgent Than memory of old times has brought you to us. GONSALVO. No feastingâI am come on sterner business; I bear commission to unveil and crush Foul treasons in your city. PADILLA. In Toledo? Be jocund, then; you'll find no painful duties; There are not truer spirits in Castile Than glow within yon walls. GONSALVO. You think them loyal! I must admire your unsuspecting goodness Rather than praise your wisdom. Is your ear So charm'd, that not a murmur from the craftsmen Has startled it? Nay, is your sainted sleep So curtain'd by oblivion, that no echo Has wafted through its labyrinth of dreams A whisper of sedition? PADILLA. Not a breath From a disloyal fantasy has stirr'd Life's placid air around us. GONSALVO. Strange as true. But, if you can,âsuppose the crowd you praise As loyal in Toledo, should presume To mutter low complaints that Charles bestows His presence on a foreign court, or doubt His right to choose the Regent of his realms Save from Castilian blood,âwhat would you tell them? PADILLA. Bid them resume the duties God has laid On tranquil lowliness, and leave to Him By whom kings reign the power to judge of kings Who at His bar shall answer. GONSALVO. Bravely said. But, further; what if they should heave with thoughts That, born in rugged commonwealths of old, Have started from the sceptred sleep of years To shake our monarchies? Should dream of power To raise a bar in every peasant's soul At which the rulers of the earth shall stand Arraign'd; nay, chafing at the sacred curb Of priestly guidance, claim to choose a creed And fashion faith at pleasure? Do you live While Luther's words, with lightning flash, assail The majesties of Rome, and hear no clang Of intellect's rebellion, ghastlier far Than that of armies? PADILLA. I have heard reports Of heresies, but never wasted time To question them; my days are short enough By light of cloudless faith to do the work Which simple duty points; I ask no space For my soul's venture but the path that lies Direct 'twixt me and Heaven; enough for me To soar from earth along that narrow track Which angel-gleamings border: to my God Devotionâto my King obedienceâthese Are simple words that breathe of mighty things Sufficient to endow for life and death A Christian soldier's being. GONSALVO. It were well Your friends could hear you talk thus. PADILLA. Talk! what mean you? You urge me to this service of the tongue And then you scoff at what my nature loathes As much as you despise it! Why are you here To show me for a braggard of the faith Which every noble of Castile enshrines In heart as true as mine? You smileâgreat Heaven! Is my truth doubted? Are you sent to call My life a lie? Speak not, but take it! GONSALVO. No; The Regent, in his clemency, forbears To claim your life, although your vaunted friends, Ripe in Toledo for revolt, avow Full confidence that brave Padilla's name Will varnish their rebellion. Adrian seeks No more of treason's idol than your cession Prisoner to me; and, for the present, doom'd To no worse dungeon than this fair domain, Where you may breathe your loyalty in prayers For us, whose falchions shall destroy the webs Of treachery you perceive not. PADILLA. Who has wrought this? Where lurks the caitiff who has forged the lie That, by the being of a moment, taints My fame for ever? I have done no wrong With consciousness to mortalâlet me know His name, Gonsalvo! I will work no harm On the poor slave, but look into his eyes And bid him gaze on mine, as now I stand Confronting you: ha! I perceive your flesh Where the soul's palsy creeps in every line That trembles with its separate cowardice Confessing that the falsehood you unfold Is your own fabric,âfor some paltry gaud, An office, or a title, or a smile, You have spread your poisons on an honest life Whose youth your boyhood mated;âcome! be bold! Avow it! Speak! I wear no sword to guard The bosom you have rack'dâI cannot stab The slander at your heartstrings! GONSALVO. You remind me That 'tis my duty to demand your sword, In token that you hold yourself a prisoner At the Imperial order. PADILLA. At the Emperor's? Has Charles's warrant authorised this shame? GONSALVO (showing a parchment). You know his hand? PADILLA (glancing at it and giving it back). 'Tis trueâbreak heartâend allâ Within there! [Calling. Enter Alphonso. PADILLA. Noânot youâbid Lopez comeâ And bring my sword. ALPHONSO. To-night, sir? PADILLA. Yesâat onceâ Why do you gaze upon me? Go, my boy. [Exit Alphonso. GONSALVO. A gallant youth; is he your son? PADILLA. Bear with me; I am stricken in a moment, and should learn Acquaintance with the griefs debasement spreads On all around it; and my son must share them; But I am not arm'd, as yet, to bid him look On the enforced surrender of that sword Which I have hoped that he would bear undimm'd Beside my bier, and after use it nobly For Charles, who now by you demands it; soonâ Full soonâmy boy must feel the home he honors, A shameful prison. GONSALVO. No; a brighter lot Shall wait him than to pace a captive's halls: He shall depart with me. PADILLA. With you? GONSALVO. With meâ A priceless hostage for his father's faith, Train'd in the camp by martial discipline To loyalty as firm as yours will show for While he is with me. PADILLA. In the camp? Your camp? My childâwhose opening spirit scarce retains A stain upon the purity it drew From heaven, when chrysome at the fontâwhence dust Of earth's pollutions, by the faintest breath Of love's rebuke unsettled, flit in air, And leave it all the angel? Must he learn The lessons of your guard-room? Never! Take His innocent life, and with it the two lives That are sustain'd by hisâor, if that grace Exceed your mission, find some loathsome cellâ A narrow cellâthere are but three of usâ Where we may waste together;âspeak, and bless me! GONSALVO. The youth shall go with me. PADILLA. Wake not the spirit Your warrant crush'd, to frenzy. You and I, Who meet thus strangely on life's downward verge, With hair just whitening, parted in the prime Of boyhoodâjoyous, yet not graced as that You would make wretchedâand though anxious years Have since revolved, the memories of our pastimes Have broken on me through their mistsâdo you Forget them utterly?âor sterner hours When I have borne the meed your frolics drew Without a murmur? By those old records Of sweet and sad companionshipâspare this, And take all else! GONSALVO. Show me a course as sure To keep the loyalty you vaunt unbroken! 'Twas well imaginedâbid your son prepareâ The light is waning. PADILLA (pacing the stage in great agitation). Heaven in grace look down! I cannot answer himâthe air is heavyâ The ponderous storm-clouds fall and hem me in With canopy of brassâbreakâbreak above meâ And let me breathe again! They partâGod's sky In deepest azure opens to my soul, And bids it thus defy thee! GONSALVO. Traitor! Enter Maria, Mondeiar, and Alphonso, followed by Lopez with Padilla's sword. Padilla sinks on a bench at the back of the scene, and covers his face with his hands. MARIA (to Gonsalvo). What is this? What sad news have you brought us? PADILLA. You are come To hear this minion of the Regent charge Your husband with seditionâask his swordâ And, for the hostage of his tainted honour, Demand his precious child. MARIA. You do not grant them? Speak, speak! You will not yield! PADILLA. Never our darling; All else the Emperor shall command. GONSALVO. A force Sufficient to compel you to obey My great commission waits; if you withhold The hostage, I shall call my ready soldiers, Who will enforce your duty. MONDEIAR. Call themâcall them! They'll scarcely answer you: surprised, they strive To burst the mansion's gates, which, while they feasted, My friends, who guess'd a shameful purpose, barr'd. PADILLA. My Sovereign's troops imprison'd in my hallsâ O lie too soon made true! [To Gonsalvo. Withdraw in timeâ I'll bid your soldiers follow. MONDEIAR. Let them go; They can work little harm without the weapons I've taken charge of. PADILLA. Give them back. MARIA. Arm soldiers To rend our darling from us? ALPHONSO (kneeling to Padilla, who remains seated). Let me die Rather than rive your loyal nature thus, But not in life be parted from you. PADILLA (placing his hands on Alphonso's head, and bending over it). Never;â The tyrant shall not dash away the bloom That innocence spreads here; nor fill these eyes With bitter tears; nor bid them glare with fire That desperate pleasure lights; nor teach these lips To utter thoughts unholy. [Rising and addressing Gonsalvo. Villain, leave us, Before the passion climbing in my soul Endow these hands with fury to avenge The home your presence violates! GONSALVO. Farewellâ Your loyalty's right well assuredâto-morrow Expect me with a band, too strong for rifling, To vindicate your king. [Exit Gonsalvo. MARIA. You ask'd your swordâ 'Tis here; you'll find its use. [Padilla takes the sword from Lopez, who goes out. PADILLA. I welcome thee! And thus unsheath thee in the just defence Of this dear household. MONDEIAR. And shall feebler households Want its protection? PADILLA. They are not profaned By wrongs like ours. MONDEIAR. With insults great as this Castile's poor homes are visited; the iron Delay'd till now acquaintance with your soul: But it has enter'd thousands of brave natures E'er it pierced yours. PADILLA. Do multitudes endure Beneath the Regent's sway such wrongs as this? Am I by some foul dream beset, or roused From deep oblivion of my country's griefs To meet them naked? Agonies and shames, That crouch'd beneath mild semblances of law, Start up, and chide me for the fond belief I have cherish'd too supinely while I dream'd That I perform'd man's duty. A new world Of strange oppressions startles me, as shapes Of dim humanity, that clustering hung Along the dusky ridges of the West, Struck Spain's great Admiral with awe of natures From Time's beginning passion'd with desires He had no line to fathom. [Shouts and tumult without. Enter Tendilla, Ovando, Gomez, and others. TENDILLA. Mondeiar, we wait you; The people are in arms; a swift report Of outrage to their noblest townsman wing'd Their discontents with rage that would not brook An hour's restraint: they come; they shout his name. [Nearer shouts, in which the name of Padilla is mingled. PADILLA. Roused, said you, by my wrongs, while I stand thus Unheeding theirs? [Shouts still nearer. MARIA (to Padilla). You hear that call? PADILLA. I hear, And fly to answer itâfor home! For justice! [Padilla rushes out, followed by Tendilla, Ovando, and others. MONDEIAR (following them). We triumph, sister! Let your prayers ascend For blessings on our cause! MARIA. On him! on him! [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. One night is supposed to elapse between the First and Second Acts. Scene I. âAn eminence near the great Gate of Toledo, overlooking the city and the valley of the Tagus. Mondeiar discovered pacing the ground impatiently. MONDEIAR. No voice! no step! This spot Padilla named When to each chief he gave his midnight charge For daybreak meeting; and the jagged urn Of dawn, which yon divided peaks embrace, Is full of saffron, which bespeaks the sun Just raised on level ocean; yet the air Is silent, and Toledo lies entranced As weary of brave sports. I know we triumph, Though my dull office lay without the walls, For the long shouts of joy that pierced the skies Were mingled with no discords. The low hills Have caught the sunbeams; still I gaze alone. Since those age-freighted hours in which I shared Columbus' watch upon the dismal sea, While the low murmurs of despair were hush'd To dull submission by the solemn light Of the great Captain's eye, as from the helm It beam'd composure, till the world we sought Dawn'd in its flushes ere the headland broke The gloom to common vision,âI have felt No vacant time so heavy as these moments Which should be throng'd with actions. Enter Tendilla. TENDILLA. Am I right? Is this our place of gathering? MONDEIAR. Rightâyour newsâ Why does the glorious madness of the night Lie hush'd in this deep silence? TENDILLA. Freedom pants Amazed at victory. My duty lay Sometimes beside our chief, whose sabre's flash Along the streets gave signal to men's souls Ready to leap from serfdom; every house Started from darkness into festal lights As touch'd by magic finger; bells rang forth In sudden peals; and three triumphant words, PadillaâLibertyâCastileâo'er all The glorious clamours floated. MONDEIAR. The Alcazar? TENDILLA. Giron, who comes, will tell us; 'twas his charge To summon it on one side, while Padilla Assail'd it on the other. Enter Don Pedro de Giron. MONDEIAR. Welcome! Tell us How sped your enterprise. GIRON. 'Twas none; my boast Is that I bore the rabble's breath and live. The throng I should have led, swept me enthrall'd In rude embrace; till, struggling to their front, I stood before the drawbridge, which upraised Left the trench yawning;âthen my rabble paused, While soldiers, roused from slumber, mann'd the walls And with join'd sabres, fashioning sheets of steel, Defied my dusky forest waving grim With axe and bludgeon; as I gave the word For action, from within the fortress rose A frantic yell of triumph, which proclaim'd Our work achieved; the soldiers dropp'd their swords, And stretch'd their arms impatient to embrace Their rugged foes: the drawbridge fell; the craftsmen In headlong rapture swept across to join Padilla's band; while from the central tower The long-furl'd banner of Castile flew out Among the stars; one voice exclaim'd, âThank God!â And at the words, the motley hosts kneel'd down Like docile children at their mother's call, And cross'd their arms in silence. But here comes The idol who enchants them, heralded Even to our meeting by their clamours. [Shouts. Enter Padilla. PADILLA. Welcome! Beneath the unclouded dome of heaven give thanks For last night's stainless conquest; if my sword Had not chastised a stripling who mistook The time for one of license, 'twere undimm'd By drop of crimson. Who should now complete Our roll of leaders? GIRON. I have friends to name, Guzman, Villenaâ PADILLA. Villena! must we own That reckless gamester? GIRON. If his personal life Is chequer'd with light follies, 'tis derived From fountains ancient and august as fill Castilian veins. PADILLA. So bears a shame more flagrant Than his whose frailties, urged by needs, defile A lowlier spring of being. In Castile, The glory that ancestral ages wreathe Around a noble's brow is less his own Than portion of the lustre that arrays His country; and the baseness that obscures it Combines foul treason to the sacred dead With robbery of the living. GIRON. Dare you charge My friend with baseness! PADILLA. Yes; what meaner vice Crawls there than that which no affections urge, And no delights refine; which from the soul Steals mounting impulses which might inspire Its noblest ventures, for the arid quest Of wealth 'mid ruin; changes enterprise To squalid greediness, makes heaven-born hope A shivering fever, and, in vile collapse, Leaves the exhausted heart without one fibre Impell'd by generous passion? And your friend, Weary of cards and dice, would make our wrongs The counters of his game! We'll none of him! MONDEIAR. Brother, be wise; in such a state as ours, We must not judge thus nicelyâGiron's friend Must find allowance. PADILLA. Is it so? Alas! Who else? TENDILLA. I name OvandoâGomezâ PADILLA. Brawlers, who without touch of true regard For men of bitter needs, inflame their thoughts By falsehood; and, for succour, give them hate, The soul's worst poison. GIRON. So I think of them; But we must work with various instruments, Or perish. PADILLA. O great Heaven! I thought our cause Strong in its justice. MONDEIAR. So it is, my brother; And while a nation's passion sweeps its depths May bear these surface eddies; as the sheet Of yon broad river, by light breezes touch'd, Breaks into devious ripples as of streams Slanting for various destinies, yet keeps Its single courseâso while a cause like ours, Moved by a people's righteous fury, pours Right onward, these obliquities are lost In the great current, if we let them skim it, Nor break its force to check them. Villena comes; Pray welcome him. Enter the Marquis de Villena. VILLENA (offering his hand to Padilla). Let me embrace our chief. PADILLA (shudders, but gives his hand). Your hand. Who follows next? GIRON. My nephew seeks Service and honour with us. Enter Carillo with his arm bandaged. PADILLA. Ha! he has won A scratch already; would it were achieved In honour! Do I see the officer Who felt my sword last night? CARILLO. You see him bow Repentant to your censure. PADILLA. Your offence In council must be judged; till that is past, Resign your sword and hold yourself a prisoner. GIRON. My kinsman welcomed thus! PADILLA. If he had sprung From the noblest blood of earth, he should be judged And sentenced as the meanest. He has stain'd A righteous enterprise which, else, had worn No spot. Amid the tumult of the night One cry of agony alone was heard, And 'twas a woman's, who, from rude embrace, Shriek'd for protection; happily I was near, Or the most holy outcry of the earth Had been unanswer'd. CARILLO. Let me hear my sentence At once, from one whose words by justice shaped Bow me with shame. PADILLA. Serve in the ranks six months. GIRON (to Carillo). Do not endure it. CARILLO. Uncle, let me serve, And by my prompt obedience win again The rank I had forgotten. [To Padilla. Sir, assign me A common soldier's trust. PADILLA. Relieve the guard At yonder city gate. [Exit Carillo. PADILLA (to Giron). You think me stern, But you will one day thank me. GIRON. I shall thank you In fitting season. MONDEIAR (interposing). Part we now to meet An hour hence at the council-house, and shape Our onward course. GIRON. Agreed. [Exeunt all but Padilla and Mondeiar. MONDEIAR. You have made a foe Potent and deadly. PADILLA. I am glad to know it; His friendship had been worse than deadlyâshameful. MONDEIAR. I thought you were more constant in your temperâ You are chafed now. PADILLA. I will subdue this fault By gazing for a moment on the home, Whence the sweet breath of old familiar joys Henceforth will rarely soothe me. MONDEIAR. 'Twill unnerve you For our stern duties. PADILLA. No; 'twill nurture in me That mighty sense of wrong which only grows From lovely things insulted. Pray you say That I am coming. [Exit Mondeiar. PADILLA (alone). I must gather strength To quell these swellings of indignant nature Among those mighty images which make A desperate venture calm. Loveliest of vales, Spread now before my gaze in childhood's light, Speak to me with the echoes which your rocks Have treasured from vow'd striplings' martial steps, While they bade frank adieu to sports and hopes And meditated forms which death would wear In our great Christian strife, as thoughts of lovers Dally with shapes of joy! Castilian banners, That flutter'd in my life's remotest dawn, And made my childish fancy leap to valour, Wave with such solemn grandeur as shall sweep All meaner angers to augment one rage August against the alien rule which blasts The land you glorify! Let all delights Of home, which sense of loyal faith made sweeter, Lend their selectest symbols to oppose The power which bids them wither at its grasp, Or sparing makes them slavish,âand invest My soul as with a breastplate! I am arm'd. [Exit Padilla. Scene II. âThe Terrace in Padilla's garden, as in 1st Act.âShouts heard at intervals, growing nearer. Enter Donna Maria. MARIA. Shout on! Roar on! My spirit drinks the crash Of furious discords blent in one great hope, As I have listen'd to the mighty cataract, From which the sounds of jagged channels join In one majestic thunder that descends With the same single music on the ear As at the river's conquest o'er its rocks When first it made its passage. Roar, and speak The strong outbursting of a nation's soul At its true master's call! Is none awake In whom the lonely rapture of my night May find an echo? I will call my sonâ Alphonso! Can he sleep? Enter Lopez. MARIA. Where's your young master? LOPEZ. Alas! I know not; as, last night, with me He paced our loftiest crags, a wilder cry Than any which our earnest ears had caught, Rose from the city;âwhen, without a word, He sprang from the sharp margin of the rock Like bird in air; scarce touch'd the points that aid The painful climber; swam the stream which gave A gurgle's notice of his buoyant course; Leap'd to the meadow; waved his plume and flew Into the darkness. MARIA. Bravely done; his place Is at his father's side. The shouts draw nearer; Can you not catch one name above them all? Enter Alphonso. MARIA. Where have you left Padilla? ALPHONSO. Left him! mother, I have sought him through the night, and cried in vain To crowds that circled him to give me way, Though I was near him often; now they rush, Led by the noblest in Toledo, hither, And, as I think, to crown him. MARIA. Heaven assuage The transports of my soul, that I may meet This fortune as befits his wife! I'll sit And study to be marble. [Sits. Enter Don Velasco, Prefect of Toledo, with Soldiers and Citizens. VELASCO. Noble lady, We seek Padilla. MARIA. Here! Then danger's past, Else ye would not expect him in a home Which only knows its thunders. VELASCO. It is past; Toledo's free; and her delighted citizens Would hail you as a queen. MARIA. Me! Do not waste A moment of this time in wreathing honors For a frail woman, who has only grace As she adores the mighty. My sole claim Is, that I have loved Padilla from his bloom Of glorious youth, not as a love-sick maid Entranced to watch the shadow of a curl On man's bright forehead, in the swimming depths Of hazel eyes with fondness downward bent Reads her own charms reflected; 'twas his soul, His kingly nature, that I honor'd then And worship now; if ye shall crown Padilla, Ye will do wisely. But my brother comesâ And, after him, my husband. Enter Mondeiarâafter him Padilla. MARIA. My dear lord, You have return'd in happiest time to give Your gracious answer to Toledo's prayers, Which claim you for a sovereign, whom Castile Will soon confirm her own. PADILLA. Me? VELASCO. Our shouts sent up From our full hearts shall answer. He whose name, As by enchantment, shook our fetters from us, Alone shall rule us. PADILLA. Do you speak the wish Of all the citizens? VELASCO. Allâsave some base ones Who seek their own advancement. PADILLA. Is it so? Is what I welcomed as a noble voice, Sent from a people's spirit to its King's To wake his justice, treason? Do I stand here A chief of rebels? No, my countrymen, Your error's but a moment's extasy, Which Heaven will pardon. MONDEIAR. But will Charles forgive? Does loyalty deceive you with the hope That he whose nature when it verged on manhood Was old in craftiest policy's success Will pardon this revoltâstart notâsuch name Our acts must carryâor forgive the love With which the people urge you to protect Yourself with them? PADILLA. It may be true, I am blasted; It may be, that in rising to redress Great wrongs, we have snapp'd the holy bond of subjects; But I will bear all shames before the spoil Of such disaster sink with meaner guilt The rebel to the robber. MARIA. Husband! lord! Before you fling the proffer'd sceptre from you Think of the strifes its sway alone can charm, The blessings which its touch would waken! PADILLA. Noâ The course of right is single. Such a flaw As is created by a chief, whose place Or circumstance leads men to fix their thoughts Upon him with affection, when he swerves From duty, works more mischief to earth's faith Than the victorious recreant can atone By years of wisest policy. MONDEIAR. Then perishâ He who has burst a nation's chains, must be Its master or its victim. PADILLA. I am doom'd then; My choice is made. MARIA. If not for theseâor meâ You think in this great moment, look on him, Sole offspring of our love whom earth retains! Plead for yourself, Alphonso! VELASCO. Noble youth, Plead for us all! PADILLA. Speak your desire, my son, As freely as to God. ALPHONSO. Mother, forgive me; My heart is in my father's, and his words Should have been mine if I had power to shape them. PADILLA. You hear himâthrough the unsullied lips of youth Heaven's answer breathes. Well said, my noble son! Look up, Maria! [Donna Maria places her hands on Padilla's shoulders, and looks intently on his face. MARIA. I can read the future, Writ in the furrows of this steadfast face; The desperate struggleâthe ungrateful herdâ Sharp death and mangled story. Think again! PADILLA. I have thought all my life for such an hourâ I must act now. Assure me that your courage Will quell this anguish. MARIA. I shall conquer it. PADILLA. And smile? MARIA. Yes; if you will it you shall find A smile on this poor face, till death shall fix Its last in wax. PADILLA. That's brave! The Council waitsâ Thither, my countrymen, I bear this life For you, which had been worthless if enwreath'd With treason's circlet; Mondeiar, come with me. [To Maria. Bid me farewell. MARIA. Farewell. PADILLA. Alphonso, wait Upon your mother; she will be prouder of you Than when she clasp'd you first. [Exeunt Padilla and Mondeiar. MARIA. My friends, for all The mighty good you proffer'd, take my thanks: Forgive me; I am faint. [Velasco offers to support her; she takes her son's arm. MARIA. Alphonso's arm Is strong enough to prop me; Heaven preserve you! [Exeunt severally. Scene III. âThe Council-house of Toledo. Giron, Villena, Tendilla, Gomez, Ovando, and others discovered. GIRON. Whom wait we for? Our duty cries dispatch. GOMEZ. Padilla will be here anon. GIRON. Padilla! At such a moment, must we idly sit Till he has surfeited with speech the rabble That doat upon his footsteps? Messengers Attend to tell the people's triumphs won In kindred cities. VILLENA. Let the first in rank Preside. TENDILLA. The first in rank! Wellâfor to-dayâ [Aside to Ovando. Giron that seat is yours. GIRON (having taken the central seat). Though slight desert Has raised me to this station, I can grace it With news most happy;ânews which proves the flame That triumphs in our city, no chance blaze Like that which an old earth-torch waves from cleft Of an extinct volcano, but the sign Of one huge fire that glows within Castile, And has already burst its shallow rind In Zamora and Burgos. With your leave, I'll ask the tidings of the Messengers Who thence wait on us. Enter two Messengers. GIRON. Who depute you to us? MESSENGER. The townsmen who command in both our citiesâ Which have one tale for each. Our Deputy, Returning home from Cortez with the shame Of voting for the Emperor's donative, Without an effort to obtain redress For outrages we suffer from the Regent, Offer'd with words to cozen us; but hands Of sturdy citizens prevented speech, Drew the poor sophist to the gate, and left him Free to the elements; meanwhile, his house Was levell'd, and his costly goods were piled In glittering heaps, from which the poorest shrink As things accursed. The rest is in suspense And waits your counsel. TENDILLA. As the people won This freedom, I advise the people mould it. I move, that, in Toledo, every parish Choose by the votes of all a councillor To rule the city, till our just demands Be satisfied; and that we urge this course On other cities. VILLENA (to Giron). Do you hear this, Giron? Is it for this the noblest blood in Spain Is perill'd? GIRON. Be content; Tendilla speaks The spirit of the hour, and I approve The scheme he offers. I would only add, As the time presses, that, in every parish, The first in station take the votes, and name The councillor elected. If you all Agree, all rise. [All riseâShouts without. GIRON. 'Tis well. What means that shout? Padilla comesâtoo late. Enter Padilla and Mondeiar. GIRON. Sit, noble friends. PADILLA. Your pardonâan unwelcome crowd too long Detain'd us. Do you meditate a scheme Of government for present need? GIRON. 'Tis settledâ A council chosen by free votes of all; One for each parish. PADILLA. All? Reflect againâ Has not a course of ages which begins Beyond the Saracen, matured a power Incorporate in Toledo to preside In exigence like this? From age to age Renew'd from busy life, yet graced with honour By old heroic story, which imparts To citizens beset with care a sense Of true communion with the glorious Past And hopeful Future,âone of those old guilds That through the cities of Castile have nurtured Freedom in shapes of loyalty, that stand Like living pillars round the throne to guard it, And look remonstrance on it. OVANDO. Tyrannies, Servile in infancy, in dotage cruel, Hollow in all. We'll sweep them to the Past, With which they boast alliance. PADILLA. Slave! OVANDO. Dost dare Denounce me as a slave? PADILLA. The worst of slavesâ The bondsman of the moment, scarcely free To talk of yesterday. MONDEIAR (to Padilla). Pray you, be calm. PADILLA. Calm!âwhile the whirlpool of the hour engulphs The growth of centuries! Pause ere ye rive, With strength of fever, things embedded long In social being; you'll uproot no form With which the thoughts and habits of weak mortals Have long been twined, without the bleeding rent Of thousand ties which to the common heart Of nature link it; wrench'd, perchance you'll mock A clumsy relic of forgotten days, While you have scatter'd in the dust unseen A thousand living crystals. GIRON. We have voted. PADILLA. Voted! Will no one join me to implore Another thought? At least, dispatch, at once, Fit mission to our King, whence he may learn That we seek only hearing for such prayers As royal hearts should answer. VILLENA. To the King? Must all end thus? OVANDO. To the Kingâthe recreant? PADILLA. This in my presenceâ [Padilla lays his hand on his sword, and advances towards Ovando, but is stayed by Mondeiar. Am I sunk so low That I must hear this treason, and not strike The speaker dead? GIRON. Ovando, do not raise Contention here: Padilla counsels wisely; If Charles reject our prayersâ PADILLA. He'll not reject them: Mine only be the peril; let me seek him, And if I bring not home his seal'd assent To all we justly claim, I'll bring this life To pay the forfeit. GIRON. No,âwe cannot spare you. Let's number our demands; first, that the King Dismiss the Regent, and resume his rule In person over us. PADILLA. 'Tis just; he'll grant it. TENDILLA. Next, that he fill all offices of state With true Castilians; that the Cortez meet Once in three years; that every city send Three to compose it, one the Clergy's choice, One from the Nobles, from the Commons one. GIRON. The Commons!âwell!âso be our prayer. VILLENA. The Commons! GIRON. Be ruled, Villena; 'tis best so; what else? OVANDO. That the King's choice in marriage shall await The sanction of the Cortez. PADILLA. I will perishâ Ere I consent to ask my king to yield His equal part in the divinest joy Our sins have left us, to the chance caprice Of heartless policyâto become a slave In that respect which masters, who are men, Leave their slaves free to choose in. Do ye mean this? GIRON. We'll speak of that hereafter; here's more news. Enter Messenger from Segovia. MESSENGER. Segovia craves your help, invested closely By Adrian's troops, under his judge Ronquillo. GIRON. The war begun? Has then Segovia risen? MESSENGER. Have ye not heard how Tordesillas died On his return from Cortez? Scorning threats That thickly murmur'd as he pass'd, he turn'd In the church porch to speak, and waved his hand With noble motion to enforce the silence His stately presence claim'd; but e'er a word Escaped his lips, a hundred massive hands Were spread to grasp him, and his form was lost Amidst the infuriate crowds who bore him thence Shrieking for mercy with a voice that sank From sharpest cry of anguish to faint moan Of wearied infancy; and though the Priests, Robed in procession met them, and upraised The Host to win a moment's time for prayer, Swept with him to the gibbet's foot, nor ceased Their madden'd roar, till lifting him to swing From the detested beam, they found the work Of death completed, and with sudden awe Gazed on their rescued victim. PADILLA. Merciful Heaven! Is this the people's justice? GIRON. It is past. Say on. MESSENGER. Ronquillo came, by Adrian sent To punish, not the reckless crowd alone But all Segovians; he proclaim'd us outlaws, And now invests our walls; while Fonseca, Flush'd with Medina's ravage, where he burn'd The labours of a thousand looms, leads veterans To join Ronquillo. If you grant no aid, Segovia's doom is seal'd, and shameful death Awaits the noblest of our citizens Who would have died to stay the rabble's vengeance. PADILLA. There's work for me more fit than war of words. Let me depart your soldier, with no troops Save such as, on the instant, choose to join My standard, whether disciplined in arms Or fresh from workman's labour. GIRON. Nobly urged. VILLENA. Will you thus arm him to achieve the crown The rabble fain would give him? MONDEIAR. O base fear! This day, when urged by thousands to accept it, He spurn'd it with a singleness of nature Beyond your reach of guessing. PADILLA. Brother, peaceâ Disdain to answer him; my heart's too fullâ Castilians! If ye think that in this mould Along one fibre creeps a wish so vile As this poor gamester in his squalid fancy Deems possible, explore it with your swords; Here on my knee, with naked breast, I claim Your quittance or your steel. [Kneels. GIRON. Rise, noble soldier; I'll answer for your truth with life, and all Will wager for it their's as freely. The other Councillors, rising. All. PADILLA. Another hour shall see my march began; Let me but crave one boon; the Queen Joanna, Amidst the conflicts of the time, may lack Observanceâ OVANDO. Have we leisure to attend The humours of distraction? PADILLA. Leisure? Yours? Your lifetime, if it would outlast the world, Were nobly barter'd for an hour employ'd In chasing from the mirror of that soul One film that dims it. I would pray the council Leave that my wife may tend her, and my son Serve her with page's duty. GIRON. Deem this order'd As you desire. PADILLA. Attend one parting prayerâ May strength continue to our cause, to claim Bravely our just demands, and, those achieved, May grace be with it nobly to dissolve In old obedience! As you keep this hope God prosper you! Farewell. GIRON. Farewell, great soldier. [Exit Padilla. At noon we'll meet again; till then farewell. [Exeunt all but Giron and Villena. Villena, you must leave our game to me; I comprehend and hate Padilla, you Simply detest him. You would play with men As with your dice and counters, which may stand For vulgar natures, but afford no mark By which a noble constancy of soul May bear its estimate; and as a child, Moving an unknown power, confounds the wisest, So, while you weave your schemes with common chances, Greatness perplexes all. VILLENA. If he should come Victorious home? GIRON. He will return victorious, But with scarce half the troops he carries hence, And more than half of them rude clowns who leave Their trades, in sudden passion to be school'd By discipline they guess not, and to smart With wounds, which the train'd soldier having learn'd In youth to image with his future, bears As ills familiar, but to craftsman's sense Will seem strange sorrows. Then, be sure, that Charles Will scorn the missives of revolted subjects, And our proud chief, who fancies that he arms At once for king and rabble, disabused, Will stand aghast, with nature rent in twain And fall to ruin; meanwhile he and all Who worship him, have left the state to us. VILLENA. Say rather to a council rabble-chosen. GIRON. Tut! you as dimly read the common mind As the heroic spirit. Trust me, Marquis, The lower that the soil lies, and the wider The surface it presents, the kindlier strikes The germ of new dominion there; the rankness Of elements that moulder round its stem Shall shed imperial purple through its flower When it shall flaunt in sunshine. [Shouts without. VILLENA. Those shouts hail Padilla's band departing. GIRON. Well! We talk More safely thus protected by their clamour, While they exhaust the passion which inspires it. Believe me, comrade, when the incense floats Most thickly round the idol's shrine, its fire Begins to smoulder. Let us divide the stakes Fairly for once: the glory of the day Padilla justly wins; its spoils be ours! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. A Month is supposed to elapse between the Second and Third Acts. The Scene throughout the Third Act lies in Avila. Scene I. âA Street in Avila. VILLENA. You say our fortune ripens; where is its show Of fruit or blossom to repay our sojourn In this dull Avila? GIRON. Have not all cities Which tower throughout Castile embraced our cause, And hither sent their delegates to form The Holy Junta, who this day assemble? And though Padilla's fame to Mondeiar gave Toledo's voice, do I not sit for Burgos? VILLENA. And what is won for me but manners curb'd By stricter supervision? GIRON. So you think This state will last! 'Twill break in thousand fragments; Then he who leads the troops will rule Castile. VILLENA. Such luck will be the General's who returns This hour with fresh-won glories. GIRON. And this hour The messengers dispatch'd to Charles will meet us And, as I prophesied, without redress. The Junta, who propose to sway men's hearts By solemn plainness, in the open square Sit to claim oaths of fealty to their power, Without regard of Charles, unless he grant Petitions which, I know, he scorn'd to hear. Padilla will refuse to take that oath, And the alternative is exile. Guess Who then will lead the army. [Trumpets without. Hark! those sounds Proclaim the Junta sitting. I am late. [Exeunt. Scene II. âThe great Square before the Cathedral of Avila.âThe Delegates of the Holy Junta discovered in white robes, seated on stone benches ranged in semi-circle; Mondeiar, as Delegate of Toledo, presiding. MONDEIAR. 'Tis time we should receive the Ambassadors Whom we dispatch'd to Charles, and who attend us. Enter Giron. MONDEIAR. The Delegate of Burgosâhave you sworn? GIRON. At dawn beside the altar. MONDEIAR. Take your place. [Giron sits. Enter Messengers. MESSENGER. The General craves admission! MONDEIAR. Will you give Padilla or the Ambassadors first audience? GIRON. If I may read your wish, we vote Padilla. [All bow. MONDEIAR. Tell the commander we desire his presence. [Exit Messenger. He'll pay our courtesy. Enter Padilla. MONDEIAR. Sit, noble brother. [Padilla sits. Segovia's Delegate prays leave to tell Your prowess at his city. DELEGATE OF SEGOVIA. While 'twas circled, And, by Ronquillo, destined for the sword, Padilla, by one mighty onset, dash'd His living wall of soldiers into knots Of wondering cravens, and dispell'd the siege, Before Segovia own'd a throb of hope, Or rose from her despair to breathe a wish For blessings on his arms. PADILLA. Small praise be mine. Ronquillo, sent to punish, not subdue, Thought only to meet citizens made feeble By conscious guilt of blood; and from the bands That follow'd me, stout hearted though untrain'd, Fled staggering with amazement at the might Plain honesty confers. Tell your Segovians, I wish, instead of stifling me with thanks, They had made their gibbets blacken with the leaders Of those who stain'd the rising of Castile With Tordesillas' murder; but alas! With base impunity of crime, revolt Confounds all qualities! MONDEIAR. This is not a time For such a question: we are met to weigh Your claims to honour, and the best remainsâ Proud Fonseca's defeat. PADILLA. Account it littleâ A rushâa charge or twoâand hot pursuit Of panic-stricken soldiers, whom to hunt For sword or capture, was as base an office As to chastise a slave. MONDEIAR. Valladolidâ PADILLA. Open'd its gates without a blowâor blows Swift conquest made forgotten. Thence I bore The jewels, sceptres, crowns and regal robes Of both the kingdoms, which the' astonish'd Regent Yielded, without a word, and scarcely met My glance, while I commanded him to creep Away unharm'd, and lead a shameful life In the city he had scourged. GIRON. Most bravely done. One form alone remains before we render For all our solemn thanksâthat you accept The oath of fealty. PADILLA. Oathâfor what? to whom? MONDEIAR. An oath of fealty to the Holy Junta And ancient customs of Castile. PADILLA. Small need, Methinks, for such an oath from one who serves With arms, not counsels. Does the oath you claim Consist with oaths already sworn to Charles? MONDEIAR. Yes; we allow of duty to the king, Provided he concede the just demands We laid before him. PADILLA. O make no reservesâ The great soul trusts! Think how you trusted first, And at whose biddingâhis, who from a cell, Savagely framed for cruel penance, stepp'd To the majestic use of courtly arts, Which luxury makes facile, while he wore The purple o'er the sackcloth that inflamed His flesh to torture, with a grace as free As when it floats o'er worshipp'd womanhood Or princely youth; his who had learn'd in vigils Of lonely night, such wisdom for command Of the world's issues, as if spirits breathed The long experiences of wisest statesmen Into a single breast; who from a soul, Which men imagined withering like his frame In painful age, pour'd, as from living urn, Exhaustless courage into soldier's hearts And made them heroes. What a power burst forth From the wan Cardinal's expanding frame, While, with the fluttering voice, that grew as clear As note of clarion, he invoked Castile To swear allegiance to her stripling prince, In faith that he, whom Heaven ordains to rule Will have Heaven's aid to govern! You replied, As, through XimÃ¨nes, Isabella spake, And pray'd you, while her daughter's soul should lie In cloud, to own her grandson. MONDEIAR. Noble trustâ Foul recompense. PADILLA. Judge not by common rules The opening passage of a mighty life! Think you the youth of him who e'er he reach'd The age a spendthrift stripling sighs for, won The crown of empire in the game of earth, Should be esteem'd like youth which princes lavish In wayward follies, and the servile herd Excuse with fondness, which expands to worship When, tired of vapid luxuries, it subsides Into the decent pomp that stiffly leads A passionless procession? No; the nature On bitter nutriment of wisdom fed In its bright spring-time, starts not from the root A graceful sapling, but, with gnarled rind, Spreads to unlovely compass, till its boughs Shade earth and tower in air. Let us be patient Till greatness immature grow ripe, to trace In the stern progress of one regal soul The infancy of ages. We are arm'd To teach that royal spirit to be just, And I'll await the issue. GIRON. You must choose At once, like us, between the oath and exile. PADILLA. Exileâfor me? MONDEIAR. Such is, indeed, the choice Proposed to all. Great Heaven! you will not leave us For such poor scruple? PADILLA. Exileâthat is to leave My country, in her need, to men who count Her dangers as their chances of high fortune! GIRON. You gaze on meâwho mean you? PADILLA. Who? Your soul, Shivering from thin expanse, which guilty hope Lent its poor compass, knowsâand knowing quails for! MONDEIAR. No more of this; the embassy attends us. PADILLA (aside). The men return'd from Charles! Why faints my heart? They may determine all. Enter Tendilla and other Ambassadors. MONDEIAR. Tendilla, welcome; What is the Emperor's answer? TENDILLA. Noneâsave threats Which, borne by Flemish emissaries, stay'd us Before we reach'd his presence. PADILLA. Did you fly And leave our prayers unutter'd? What made death So terrible? TENDILLA. It was not death appall'd usâ But shames too vile for a Castilian tongue To utter; for which Flemish arms were strung And Flemish eyes were greedy. PADILLA. Lost! Undone! MONDEIAR (aside to Padilla). Now, will you hesitate? GIRON. Our oath must now Proscribe the Emperor. [Padilla, who has been sitting at the extremity of the circle, rises in great agitation, and is about to speak, when a Messenger enters. MESSENGER. My lords, a youth, Who styles himself the general's son, craves audience. MONDEIAR (to Padilla). Will you confer with him apart? PADILLA. Not Iâ His mission's not for me; although these eyes Have not embraced him since I went to battle, I know he would not seek me in this hour Of solemn duty. MESSENGER. No; he prays the Junta To hear his tidings. MONDEIAR (to the Junta). Are you pleased to hear them? [All bow. Bid him approach. [Exit Messenger. I'll answer for his bearing. Enter Alphonso. PADILLA (aside). He does not rush into my arms; that's rightâ He does not glance this way; well done. ALPHONSO. My Lords, The service you permitted me to pay The Queen Joanna makes me bold to bring News of a change which, for three days, has fill'd Her household with amazement. The dull sorrow That weigh'd her silken lashes down has fled, And eyes, which rarely caught the sunbeam, spread With wild intelligence. Her ashy lips Long seal'd in sullen silence, or unclosed Only to murmur indistinct despair, Part flush'd with crimson; and, in rapid change, The broken music of her queenly life Breathes and commands her childhood's scenes to live In brightness that appals us, yet, to her, Seen through the parted foldings of the mists That have o'erwhelm'd her spirit, they appear As starting from a depth of years she thinks Have pass'd upon her lonely state. My mother, Who day and night keeps watch beside her couch, Believes her soul is kindling. PADILLA (starting up). It shall kindle! Heaven does not mock us! When we swore to serve Joanna's son, we saved the mother's right If sense should visit her; and now it dawns In happiest season. MONDEIAR. 'Tis most true, our oath Bore such exception. PADILLA. Else we had been traitors, Not only to the stricken princess living, But to the dead, whom each Castilian holds Sacred above all living womanhood;â Her from whose veins Joanna's life was drawn: Who, o'er the rage of battles and the toils Of empire, bent an aspect more imbued With serious beauty earth partakes with heaven, Than cloister nurtured in the loveliest saint It shrined from human cares. Her daughter wakes, As from the sleep of death, to claim her throne, And ye sit mute, and do not bend a knee To bless your God! GIRON. Must we disturb the course Of our momentous duties to enquire How madness glares or flickers? E'er ye deem this More than the gossip of a weary chamber, Think in what sad abasement of disease Joanna's spirit liesâhow all regards Of parents, kindred, country, rank, were lost In childish adoration of the form A wreckless husband wore; for whose slight image Cold, tempests, dangers, injuries and scorns Were pass'd unheeded, till her spirit, stung By jealous fury, dock'd 'mid laughter's rage, The locks that in their golden meshes held Her truant lord; how, tranced in grief, she bore A child unconscious, while her thoughts were fix'd On her far distant scorner: how, when dead, She cherish'd him as living, till from dreams Of frightful rapture startled, to a tomb Beneath Granada's walls by night she bore him, And cursed the torches when the tempest blew Their flames athwart death's panoply! And this lady Ye seek to rule these kingdoms! PADILLA. Shallow scorner! There's not a deed you cast on her as shame That does not prove her noble. If, on ship-board, The pictured likeness of her plighted lord Then unbeheld, grew precious as it charm'd Her perilous bridal voyage, till she embraced The living idol who in grace outshone The vision of the desolate sea, and thus The mein so sigh'd for, so assured, became, In spite of wrongs and scorn, an image set So deeply in affection, that no guilt Could ruffle it, no falsehood dim, nor death Touch with decay,âI tell your lordly wisdom, There is more royalty in such a love Supremely seated in a woman's heart Than in the power of monarchs. God alone Knows what she bore in that self-tyranny Which to the sweet rebellion of a tear Denied its license; but through all she made Of grief a lonely throne; whence she shall rise In majesty relumined! GIRON. 'Tis delusion,â It may be falsehood. PADILLA. LordsâI will not smite himâ Hear me! I wager all I have and am On this great issue. See! I draw my sword, And swear allegiance to Castilian laws And to my rightful Queen, Joanna! [Draws. GIRON. Treason! PADILLA. So be it answer'd if I fail to show The Queen restored to govern. Give me, Lords, A dayâan hourâto wake the royal pulse That lives in her great nature; if I fail, I will confess this charge of treason just, And crave a traitor's sentence. MONDEIAR (to Padilla). Be not rash. PADILLA. I follow Heaven that points; at this hour's close Attend Joanna's palace; let the scaffold Meanwhile be furnish'd for me; and if, then, Ye do not own her queen, let me ascend it. GIRON. Grant his mad prayer. MONDEIAR. Dear brother, pauseâyour foe Echoes your wish. PADILLA. The voice of the Eternal, That breathes through organs which seem framed to mock it, Speaks now in Giron's. [To the Junta. If you accept my life In pledge, stand up. [All rise. I shall not ask a moment Beyond the hour, to hail the Queen or die. MONDEIAR. Adjourn the sitting. Brother, I will seek you At Queen Joanna's palace. God uphold you! PADILLA. He willâHe does. [Exeunt all but Padilla and Alphonso. PADILLA (embracing Alphonso). Alphonso, you have brought Tidings more glad than on the thirsty ear Of dying hope have pour'd since fortune's game Had empire for a prize. My nature, shiver'd To fragments from its centre, closes whole As flawless crystal. I will circle in The powers of new-born freedom with a band Firmly expanding as they grow within it, Beneath a diadem whence steadfast rays Shall, through the fiercest struggles of the realm, Shed reconciling calm. ALPHONSO. But if this hope Should fail? PADILLA. My work in this world will be done, And I shall pass absolved; but do not dream it; Let not such fear impede your bounding feet Which should be wing'd with joy! Among the spoils Brought from Valladolid, you'll find the crowns, Sceptres, and robes, and jewels of Castile And Aragon; see them, at once, disposed Around the inner chamber of the Queen That's curtain'd from her sightâsend me a Captain Fit to direct my soldiersâthen expect me To wait your royal mistress. Fly! [Exit Alphonso. PADILLA (alone). My soul Quivers with triumph; yes; the woman's shatter'd But the Queen lives! The infant through whose dreams Attendant homage shed obsequious hues Which made them purple, and who, waking, saw The brow that wore the fairest crown of earth Bent with a mother's earnest love, received A sense of royalty which touch'd will wake Midst the mind's ruin. Though in deep abyss Perturb'd the fountain of its reason heaves, If I can bid the shows of queenly power Nod o'er its waters, they will spread serene To give the steady reflex to the day From majesty's still mirror. Enter a Captain. CAPTAIN. I attend you At your son's bidding. PADILLA. Right; you know the palace Where the Queen rests in Avila? CAPTAIN. The Queen?â She who is sunk in madness? PADILLA. She who, this day Restored, shall bless Castile. Draw up your soldiers, So that they line her courtyard; keep them voiceless, Till you behold aloft a banner waveâ Then raise the shouts of triumph; bid each man Fling up his helm, and cry, âLong live the Queen!â And rush with all your officers to throng Her chamber, that she may assume her state Girt with Castilian heroes. CAPTAIN. May your hopes Prove true! PADILLA. They shall prove true; make hasteâaway! [Exit Captain. PADILLA (alone). My lifeâmy honour's lifeâmy country's life Hang on this hour. Spirit of Isabella, Whom the strong peril of thy loved Castile Constrains to listen, shine into the soul Of thy distracted daughter with such look As after my first skirmish, 'neath the towers Of old Grenada, thou didst lavish on me A stripling, gash'd and fluster'd to thy tent Conducted to receive more charming praise Than manhood ever wins; when golden locks Stray'd from the heroic forehead into films Of sunlight, and a slender, jewell'd hand That lightly fell upon my bending head Shot ecstasy through all my frame! I see That aspect beam; I feel that touch; I come! [Exit Padilla. Scene III. âAn Antechamber in the Palace of the Queen Joanna.âLadies waiting. Enter Maria. MARIA. Is the Queen sleeping still? LADY. Yes; but she smiled Just now in sleep, and murmur'd out your name. MARIA. My name? She has not known me through the weeks I have attended her. LADY. I am sure she named you; And yet she stirr'd not while your son disposed Sceptres, robes, crowns, and gems beyond the curtains That fall around her. Enter Padilla. MARIA (running to Padilla). My dear husbandâ PADILLA. Holdâ I dare not clasp you to my heart till Heaven Assure our triumph. MARIA. How? PADILLA (to the attendant Ladies). Please you to watch The Queen's awaking. When she stirs, let music, A lute touch'd softly to some old dull tune She may have heard in Flanders, meet her ear. [Exeunt Ladies. PADILLA. Maria, on this hour depends the fate Not of our household only, but Castile, Which lives or withers as Joanna's heart Shall glow or fail. Be near her when she wakes; Strive to dispel ignoble memories from her, While I abide your summons. [Exit Maria. Soft music within. PADILLA (alone). Hark the music Bespeaks her waking; now be with us Heaven! [Exit Padilla. Scene IV. âThe Chamber of the Queen Joanna.âA royal Chamber, divided by curtains which fall in a crescent round a couch on which the Queen Joanna is reclining. At the head of the couch is placed a Chair of State, beside which Donna Maria and Alphonso are standingâat its foot an Attendant Lady is sitting on a low stool with a lute, on which she is playing.âShe ceases to play as the scene opens. JOANNA (waking). Whence is that air? I think I heard it play'd Long since; was it by you? LADY. No, madam, never; 'Tis of my country, Flanders. JOANNA. Flanders? Trueâ I now remember, yearsâlong yearsâago In your gay land I heard it. I was a bride then, And the most glorious face that Nature shaped In ecstacy, look'd down with love on mine; You well may wonderâ'tis a tale so oldâ To see me living still. MARIA. Your Highness' age Leaves years of life to come. JOANNA. Ay years, years, yearsâ For I am doom'd, to wear a wondrous life, Far off, it dawn'd in lustre; then 'twas pall'd In blackness streak'd with horrors; now it bursts From sleep by fits, when long past things flash out In shapes that crowd the chambers of my brain To agony that spends its force in throbbing; And then I sleep againâlong dreamless sleepsâ Which must endure for years; so Time sweeps by And leaves me a dull monument to keep His saddest records; none would own me now For Isabella's daughter. MARIA. All who knew Her image living, trace it in your Highness. JOANNA. No; I alone of those that breathe have known her; And I can tell you things no living eye But mine beheld. When the world's mighty strife 'Twixt Moor and Christian, in which radiant saints Vouchsafed to mingle with our hosts, was crown'd By cession, in earth's breathless silence, made Of tamed Grenada, by my mother's side I sat, and saw the enormous towers unscathed As still defying siege, beneath the range Of ice-clad mountains, which with peaks of fire Look'd pinnacled for angels' feet. Our veterans Stood like mail'd statues, till the giant cross Of virgin silver, which my father raised Before him in his battles, shone erect Against heaven's azure, on the Alhambra's top, Flinging its sacred shadow on the dome Which sullenly heaved under it; then all Fell on their knees, and down scar-furrow'd cheeks Large tears roll'd slowly, as the hymn of praise Floated on air; but none advanced a step Toward the surrender'd gates, till thence appear'd Hundreds of Christian captives freed from depths Of Moorish dungeons, shrinking in strange sunlight, Who totter'd to my mother's feet to bless Her face, like those, they said, which beam'd in sleep That follow'd torture. Then, what shouts arose! What endless torrent of plumed troops swept by us, With cataract roar! It rushes on my brainâ It racks meâlay me down. [Maria assists Joanna to lie down and adjusts the pillows. JOANNA. Your touch is gentleâ What are you call'd? MARIA. Maria de Pacheco; I've watch'd a month beside your Highness. JOANNA. Ha! I think I heardâit must be long agoâ You call'd an infant by my slighted name; Does she live still? MARIA (bursting into tears). In heaven. JOANNA. Fie! do not weep, You see I do not weep who outlive all; I have not shed a tear since that long night Which I endured beside Medina's postern, When, while the snow weigh'd down the fluttering robe That clad me, I defied the minion lords Who strove to win me back to the sad couch I left to make my lonely way to him Whose soul was pledged to mine; they tore me thence; But I escaped their feeble bonds again, And traversed land and sea to findâto findâ A Flemish wanton snaring Philip's soul With golden tresses. See! She kneels and prays With baby prettiness and honied words For pardonânever! Doff those glistening locks And stand, unshaded by a curl, the gaze Of her you have stabb'd! I am a Princess still And will have justice! What if Philip frown? I like him best when frowningâ Do I wander? I am far sunk in years, and age has licence To babble of old times. MARIA. All women shared The wrongs you bore from Philip. JOANNA. Shared? what mean you? When did I crave a partner for my grief, Or talk of wrongs? I was too wan for Philipâ The beautiful! He gazes on me nowâ Smileâsmileâso for eternity! MARIA. In death Be all his frailties shrouded! JOANNA. Death! You are fair, Yet, from your lips, the dismal echo breathes Of the world's lie. This cold and barren earth And the dull roof of clouds that clip it round, Leaden and low, to shroud it from God's azure, Ring with that falsehood; he was sick and lay In trance, and all who envied me conspired To call it death, and laid him in a graveâ But thence I pluck'd himâpaleâbut not more pale Than I have seen him when I watch'd his couch After long revels, whence he woke to know me, And sometimes thank me. This poor heart still beats, And, by its beating, I'm assur'd he lives. MARIA. Since you so fervently desire his life I'll wish him living; but yourself entomb'd him In marble at Grenada. JOANNA. Soâyou have heard That rare device; how, through each day encamp'd, I curtain'd him, and bore him on by night, Loathing all roofs, that I might laugh at those Who watch'd his waking. 'Tis a dismal journeyâ The torches flicker through its mistsâthe sleet Descends to quench themâI'll not track it onâ Tell me how fares the world, what path your husband Treads of its dusty ways? MARIA. He is one whose name Your Highness may have heardâJohn de Padillaâ Whose youth won glory in the Moorish war, And whose life now awaits your Highness' service. JOANNA. I knew a boy so named, whose dawning valour My parents cherish'd when they lived in camp At Medun; can he live still? MARIA. He attends Your gracious bidding. JOANNA. Let him come this instant; I little dream'd a nobleman who knew me In my bright childhood lives. MARIA (to Alphonso). Inform Padilla The Queen commands his presence. [Exit Alphonso. JOANNA. Queen! I'll take My state to welcome him; set me my chair, I'll fill it like a throne, and shame my mockers. [Maria places the Chair of State in front, and assists Joanna to take it. Enter Padilla, followed by Alphonso. PADILLA (kneeling before Joanna). I pray your Majesty to look with grace On your distracted subjects. JOANNA. Mine? You mock me; I am only sovereign of these rooms,âthese ladies My few poor subjects. Let me look upon you; 'Tis said you are the glorious youth who won Two crescent standards 'neath Grenada's walls With marvellous prowess; rise; it cannot beâ Those battles have been hush'd an age, and you Are in your prime still; yet you are like the boy My mother loved to praise. PADILLA. I am the same Whom that rich guerdon bless'd. Let me assure My own the happy brow on which it lighted By one most sacred memory which none other Of my degree can cherish. When the sovereigns, After Grenada's capture, held their court In radiant Seville, I once shared the feast Of their small household, and when sunset closed The pastimes gracious Royalty had plann'd For festal youth, and I was shrinking homeward Full of delight, I saw the Queen with smile That lent authority's augustest presence The charm of angel, beckon me to wait Upon her steps;âI follow'd to the shrine At which, with her, the royal children kneel'd In vesper adoration. Softest light Shed by one silver lamp reveal'd the walls Of alabaster, storied with the deeds Of saints and martyrs, carved in white as stainless As the fantastic wonders nature shapes In Alpine caverns. By your side was John, Your rosy brother; opposite to him Your sister Isabella bent a head So stately and so sad, as if she felt Chill shadow of her destiny to wear The crown of Portugal with speedy change For cypress and for amaranth. With arm Tightening about her neck, and eye upturn'd, Stood Kate the youngest. JOANNA. I behold them allâ I see you kneeling with us; and a strain Wafted from childhood murmurs through my heart And makes it lighter. I think I must have dream'd Strange, heavy dreams;âfor it seems yesterday When we were ranged beneath my mother's eye Obedient children; Kate scarce totter'd thenâ She may live still; oh tell me, is there one To call me sister? PADILLA. Katherine is queen in England. JOANNA. England? I was in England onceâthree months Feasted at Windsor, by a monarch styled The Seventh Henry. Oh that I had perish'd Before I touch'd its shore! PADILLA. I pray you, wherefore? JOANNA. Because death then had clasp'd me in an hour Of Philip's love. For weeks we had been toss'd Upon the wintry seas, from Flanders bound For Spain, with no companions but our sailors, Rough, weather-beaten men, with grizzly locks And tawny limbs, whose kindness raised my wonder, For never from my women's tenderest care Felt I such true observance as wild ocean Had taught her mates; and Philip's heart was soften'd By dear remorse that made me bless the storms That waken'd it, till lightning struck our mast In the black valley of two mountain seas, Lit into hungry crimson by strange fire That revell'd in the dripping cordage; changed The sails to sheets of tatter'd flame, and show'd Gaunt visages of brave men whom the fate That yawn'd and glared around us struck to shapes Immovable with horror; in that instant By flash of a huge splinter, as it fell, I saw my husband's face bent down on mine With such remorseful beauty as o'erpaid My years of weary sorrow. How I cursed The dismal beach of Weymouth, where I woke From happy trance to find myself in life! PADILLA. Lady, you then were on your way to Spain To solemnise your heirship of the crown Which now is yours. Oh let it from your brow Shine on Castile! JOANNA. My brow?âyou cannot mean itâ My crown?âhow mine? Where is my brother John? Is he not heir of all? PADILLA. From noblest hopes A nation ever cherish'd in its prince, Ere his first year of bridal joy had flown, God call'd him, and the youth unmurmuring left Earth's fairest lot; and, in his tomb, a babe, The blighted fruit of happy love, awaits A two-fold waking. JOANNA. Now I see it all; My crown is wrested from me by a father, And he is mighty. PADILLA. Ferdinand is dead. JOANNA. Dead? When he died, did no one urge my right? You said my sister Isabella diedâ Where was my sonâon whom I have not gazed Since his stern beauty fill'd my wasted arms? It rises on me now with face that frown'd In answer to the smiles my poor heart lavish'd, To smite it! Charles usurps his mother's throneâ Tell me no more; let me lie down again, And dream away my days. PADILLA. He held the crown For you, till mercy should dispel the clouds Which now are melting in the gracious sunlight Shed on your spirit. We had honour'd still His glorious youth, but that he left Castile To foreign minions; against these we rose; And from their grasp we have redeem'd the crown For you, our sovereign lady, whom we pray To wear it. JOANNA (starting from the chair). Won for me? [At a sign from Padilla, Alphonso draws aside the curtains which had divided the chamber, disclosing a magnificent saloon furnished with large mirrorsâterminating in a balcony, beyond which the towers of the Cathedral are seenâthe sceptres, crown, and regalia of Castile and Aragon disposed around the saloon. PADILLA. Beholdâ The ancient symbols of the regal power Rescued for you! JOANNA. Can this be real? [Alphonso presents the Crown of Castile kneeling to Joanna, who takes it in her hand; her fingers play hurriedly over the jewels. 'Tis real; This is the crown which great Ximenes placed Upon my forehead in Toledo's square, When I was hail'd as heiress of these realms; How the vast pomp expands before my soul, Which swells to compass it! And this is mine! My own! Brave soldier, place it on my head! PADILLA (placing the Crown on Joanna's head). Forgive me; my hands tremble with delight; Permit my wife to fix that robe. [To Alphonso] The signal! [Alphonso waves a banner from the balcony; Maria arrays Joanna in one of the royal robes; as she does so Joanna catches a view of herself in a mirror and stands gazing with delight. Shouts arise without and cries of âLong live the Queen!â JOANNA. Is that my formâthe form I thought decay'd And shrunk in age? What shouts are those? PADILLA. The voice Of your enraptured people. [Shouts continueâmartial musicâPadilla's Captain rushes in with the Banner of Castile and waves it over the QueenâThe room becomes full of Officers and Soldiers. PADILLA. See the flag Of your Castile! JOANNA. I bless it. Let the gates Be thrown wide open; let my subjects throng My palace, and approve me while I swear To reign for them. [In a pause of the shouts the distant music of the Cathedral organ is heard. JOANNA. Pray you one momentâhushâ Those sounds refresh my thirsty soulâforgive meâ Thank God I weep again! [Members of the Holy Junta enter and kneel to the QueenâShouts renewed. PADILLA. The Holy Junta Who have preserved your kingdoms, claim your blessing. JOANNA. They have it; I must ask their wisdom's aid To teach me how to rule. [Alphonso bears to Joanna the Sceptre of Aragon. PADILLA. The holy sceptre Of Aragon. JOANNA (taking it). Yes; this at Saragossa I swore to wield in mercy, when I deem'd it A gorgeous plaything. I will keep that oath. [Mondeiar brings forward the Banner of Toledo; and is about to lay it at Joanna's feet. PADILLA. The Delegate from your own Toledo lays Its banner at your feet. JOANNA. No; let it float On the proud airâthe banner of my birthplace, That I may hail its star of gold that flash'd Upon me in my infancy with hope Of grandeur now fulfill'd. [Mondeiar waves the Banner of Toledo. Beloved Toledoâ Your Queen shall fill you with her state!âfor there I'll fix my Court. Meanwhile behold my general [To Padilla. To whom I trust my armies; my chief lady [To Maria. Who shall direct my household. [Padilla and Maria kneel on each side of the Queen, and kiss her handsâSoldiers and Citizens pour inâthe organ swells into triumphant musicâbanners are waved in different parts of the Saloon. JOANNA stands in the front with her hands clasped and exclaims Mother, bend From your eternal seat to reign with me! [The drop-scene falls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. A Month is supposed to elapse between the Third and Fourth Acts. The Scenes of the Fourth Act lie throughout in Toledo. Scene I. âAn Antechamber in the Alcazar of Toledo, now the Palace of the Queen Joanna; in the middle of the backscene folding doors guarded by Sentinels. Enter Donna Mariaâshe attempts to pass. MARIA. Give me free passage to the Queen. SENTINEL. My orders Preclude all passage. MARIA. Orders! who dares give them? Who has empower'd you to deny to me, Wife of the Queen's Commander, while he sweeps Her foes before him, leave to pay her service? SENTINEL. Don Giron has directed that none pass, Save those who bear a summons to the council The Queen this hour will hold. MARIA. The Queen hold council! Do'st mean that Giron represents the Queen Fit to embody royal will in acts? I must pass to her. SENTINEL. Giron comes; if he Accord you access, I shall gladly yield it. Enter Giron. MARIA. You are well met, Don Giron, to assure me If, by your order, I am denied free way To attend my royal mistress? GIRON. Yes.âWhen trifles Of womanly observance claim your aid You shall have leave to render it; this hour The state requires the Queen's unruffled wisdom; And I must pray you to defer attendance Till graver duties be fulfill'd. MARIA. O mockery Of council! Well you know her mournful spirit, Expanded for awhile by generous warmth, Has closed in foldings that admit no access To knowledge of state matters; and you seize The moment when the afflicted sense has shrunk Most deeply into gloom, and when the chief Whose accents might recal it, is detain'd By duty from her court, to practise on her Some most ignoble treachery. GIRON. I respect Your privilege to rail; but weightier cares Oblige me to entreat you wait my leisure For apt reply. Enter Soldier. SOLDIER. The general just arrived Desires to see Don Giron. MARIA. My dear husband? GIRON. Tell him his lady waits, and though I wish A speedy conference with him on state matters, I will not mar their meeting. [Exit Soldier. Farewell, lady, Soon you will know me better. MARIA. Know thee betterâ No, Giron; I may see thy giant webs Immesh our fortunes in their threads, or crush'd To atoms by an honest hand's chance grasp, But for the soul that weaves them, no event Can show it clearer. Enter Padilla. MARIA (embracing him). What delight to clasp you After four weary weeks of absence, cheer'd Only by such dim knowledge of your triumphs As rumour bore! PADILLA. Have you received no letters? Oh wicked craft!âBut tell me of your charge, In which I live or dieâhow fares the Queen? MARIA. Alas! there lies our grief. The courtly grace With which she bless'd your banners when we parted Shone through that evening's festival and charm'd Her wondering guests; and during the five days She after spent in Avila, her carriage Remain'd most noble; though sometimes she sat Abstracted, as if truant fancies play'd With distant things as present, if a word Reminded her of regal state, her soul Collected in a moment all its strength And started into majesty. She seem'd Rapt in delicious musing through the journey Thence to this city of her youth, and vow'd, Before she sought repose to pay her thanks In that august Cathedral where the Church Embraced her soul in Baptism. As she kneel'd Before the venerable font, her face Shone with soft ecstasy, which so possess'd Her frame in its composure, that men gazed In awe, as if a bodiless spirit shed Celestial thoughts among them. When we reach'd This palace of her infancy, wild change Came over her; she bounded with delight Like that of a young peasant girl return'd Home from first service and array'd as queen Of village feast; now she some relic kiss'd Of baby times: now burst out into sobs Mingled with laughter; last in vivid speech Told of august Columbus and the birds Of dazzling colours that he brought from realms Far westward, till her fancy seem'd to ache With its own splendour, and, worn out, she slept The gentle sleep of childhood; whence, alas! She woke still more estranged. PADILLA. Did she not sit Queen of the tournament our city held In honour of her coming? MARIA. As an image Shaped by the sculptor in unconscious semblance Of majesty; her soul but once awoke From heaviest dreaming;âwhen the conqueror kneel'd Before her for his crown, a smile as faint As sparkle that the moon's young crescent casts On stedfast water circled on her face In flickering sweetness. Never has she sat In council till this hour, when Giron dares Usurp her name for summons. PADILLA. So dissolves The snow-wreath which I thought a sacred band To gird our cause! Giron has stamp'd her seal On orders which have drawn away my soldiers, Troop after troop, till I was left as bare As a thick grove in winter, sadly deck'd By some few desperate friends that like dank leaves, Which, in their fluttering yellow, cleave through rain And frost to moss-clad boughs, would not forsake me; But I would stand alone against the world If my Queen's soul were clear. Enter Soldier. SOLDIER. My Lord, the troops The Regent has combined, in mighty force, Advance upon Toledo. PADILLA. Who commands them? SOLDIER. 'Tis said the Count de Haro. PADILLA. A great captainâ How many soldiers have we near Toledo? SOLDIER. The Junta's troopsâ PADILLA. The Junta'sâsay the Queen's. SOLDIER. I rather should say Giron's, for his friends Command each band, and all obey his orders; They number scarce six thousand. PADILLA. Tell Don Giron That I await him here. SOLDIER. My lordâ PADILLA. Obey me, Or my own sword shall teach you duty; surely I am your general still. SOLDIER. My lord, he comes. PADILLA. Leave us; and you, my love, withdraw awhile; I must unmask the traitor. MARIA. Smite him down With one proud look of goodness. [Exit Maria. Enter Giron. GIRON. Welcome home! PADILLA. Before I take your greeting, answer me; Why, while our enemies remain unquell'd, Were all my veteran soldiers order'd hither And officer'd afresh? Why was I left To learn, on chanced return, what dim report Had scarce suggested, that an army raised To sweep the Queen's battalions from Castile Bursts on Toledo? GIRON. I shall make reply To no one save the Queen, from whom I hold Supreme commission to command the troops And curb the citizens,âand with it hold The right to counsel you to seek the shelter Your neighbouring mansion offers. PADILLA. Am I awake? Commission from the Queen? Supreme commission? The power to bid me shrivel into sloth While the war thunders? No; some desperate fraud Gives semblance of authority to wrong That passes fancy. GIRON (showing a scroll). There is my commission; Gaze on it; you will find it bears true impress. PADILLA. The same that drew my soldiers from my camp To wait your orders, but 'twas not impress'd By the Queen's will; I'll learn this very instant, From her own lips, if her most noble nature Sanction this deed. GIRON. She is reposing now; You cannot see her. PADILLA. This atrocious scroll Bears date this day; if she could do this act She can avow it. Sentinels, make wayâ He bleeds who stops me. [Padilla rushes past the Sentinels through the folding doors. GIRON (alone). Goâyou will find her lips Quivering with Giron's name if I have train'd Her feeble sense aright; else they'll be dumb. Enter a Captain of Giron's guard. CAPTAIN. My lord, the Regent's army like a flood Pours down the black declivities that front The northern gate; your soldiers stand in arms, Impatient for their leader. GIRON. He is readyâ My armour! (Calling.) [Giron's Squire enters with his armour, and arms him while he speaks. Do my captains hold the posts I order'd? CAPTAIN. All is as you wish. GIRON (speaking in great excitement). How light This armour sits! Methinks the blood that springs From Spain's remotest heroes never rush'd Through any of my glorious ancestors With such triumphant prophesy as now It swells in mine. My horseâmy noblest horseâ Is he attired for war? CAPTAIN. At the Alcazar gate In conscious pomp he waits you. GIRON. Glorious steed! I have reserved thy mettle for this conflict, Which shall avenge us both on restless hours When, in the gentleness of arrowy speed, I have felt thy hidden valour under me, And known thee panting for a leader's form Thou shalt soon carryâfor thy master comes No slight lieutenant, but a chief to win An empire in thy saddle. Enter Padilla with the scroll. GIRON. May I take My Queen's commission? PADILLA (giving the scroll). Take it; by what spell, What wicked blandishment, you snared her sense I know not; but her lips, when I implored That she would name her general, murmur'dâGiron; Take itâmy life goes with it. GIRON. Seek your homeâ I will protect it. PADILLA. You? GIRON. YesâIâ Before this night shall fall, your slow-won glories Shall pale before the triumphs that await Castile's first son in arms. I feel them crown me! [Exit Giron followed by the Captain. PADILLA. Yet stay!âI would have pray'd to serve beneath you! May God protect the brave men you command From swift destruction! Enter Maria. MARIA. What has Giron dared? PADILLA. His daring is made legitimate; he holds The Queen's commission superseding mine, And has gone forth to lead our mortal conflict Against the Regent. MARIA. You'll not suffer itâ Joanna means it not. PADILLA. Alas! I sought her And in such tremulous accents as my ear, Attent with agony could catch, she gave The monstrous parchment sanction. MARIA. Trample on it! Proclaim it filch'd by most unrighteous practice From a distracted mind which God absolves From reason's duty! PADILLA. Never; I staked allâ My life, my honour, my dear country's peace, On the Queen's waken'd spirit; with her title Graced the wild tumults of the crowd, and made Rebellion consecrate: and while a thread Of consciousness within her soul can shape A mandate, I will honour it as law Announced by voice of angel. MARIA. Is it so? You were not made for times like these. PADILLA. Not made For any time Maria, but for life Of which this is the threshold whence the gates Of the eternal open. Hark! the streets [Loud tumult without. Are throng'd with battle. Enter Mondeiar. PADILLA. Brother, you see how wildly Change courses over us in this slight world, For, in a little fragment of an hour, You find me stripp'd of station, trust, command, By arts of Giron. MONDEIAR. This same hour has brought Deep retribution. Giron, drunk with joy Of base success, impell'd the unsteady soldiers Whom he had parcell'd out to silken captains, Blindly against the Regent's troops, who, wing'd With impulse from the mountain, broke their lines At the first charge; they fled, and left our gates Free to the victors, who are rushing through them To threaten the Alcazar. Hark! They come! PADILLA. The spoilers in Toledo! sword, come forth; I ask no warrant now to draw thee! [Draws. (To Maria.) Dearest, Attend the Queen; keep from her ear the crime And anguish of this hour. Ancestral city, I will deliver thee or die! [Padilla rushes out, followed by Mondeiarâtumult continues. MARIA (alone). In arms! Heaven only grant that he remain in arms, Sustain this righteous impulse of his valour, And let what men call Fortune hurl its blows Madly against us. Enter Sentinel. SENTINEL. Lady, we are betray'd; While at the Northern Gate the battle raged, A band of soldiers through the Alcazar's portal That opens on the Tagus, left unbarr'd By treachery as I think, with furtive steps, Found entrance to the chamber where the treasures Of regal state lie heap'd, and thence approach The person of the Queen; I have no force To meet themâpray you fly. MARIA. âFly,â saidst thou, craven? My place is with my Queen. SENTINEL. Oh that our captains Had mettle such as yours! MARIA. No speechâcome with me. [Exeunt. Scene II. âThe great Square before the Cathedral of Toledo; Citizens flying up the steps of the Cathedral followed by Soldiers in confusion. Enter Padilla, with sword drawn. PADILLA. Turn, recreants, or my sword shall make you know The coward's peril worst. Do my eyes dazzle, Or is there a plumed officer who shares This shameful flight? [Seizes Villena in the crowd. I'll give thee judgment hereâ Die! VILLENA. Have mercy, brave Padilla! PADILLA. Faugh! Villenaâ Thou art not worthy such a death, and thus I fling thee back again to reptile beingâ Live, craven gamester! [Flings Villena from him. I will waste no breath On soldiers train'd in armsâlet them fly on And cowering wait with yonder palsied wretch The conqueror's lash. Craftsmen of brave Toledo, Through whose stout hearts these glory-cinctured towers Have shed the mighty thoughts of ages, guard them With your rude weapons! Do not seek for swords; And if you have no axe or bludgeon, use The naked energy of arms grown strong From weakness they have circled, to defend Your wives and sisters stricken dumb with fear Of woes they dare not shape,âand strike with me! [Padilla rushes out, followed by the People. Scene III. âThe Antechamber of the Alcazar, as before. Enter Maria. MARIA (alone). Snatch'd from us in a moment, with her reason Darken'd for this life! Melancholy Queen, Why wert thou startled from thy world of dreams To emptier mockeries. Enter Mondeiar. MONDEIAR. Is the Queen safe? MARIA. Gone,â And all the regal gauds. MONDEIAR. Sad chance! Padilla, Turning the tide of battle through the streets, Caught an uncertain rumour from the crowd Of danger menacing the Queen, and sent me Hither to shield her. MARIA. Giron's treacherous art Has miss'd its aim, but in its failure, given Our royal lady to the conqueror's grasp, Which will consign her to a living tomb Whence never voice shall issue. Enter Soldier. SOLDIER. Our city's saved; Its streets are freed from spoilers, and its gates Secured and sentinell'd; beyond all's lost. Don Giron, when surrounded, madly spurr'd His fiery courser up the rocky steeps Which boldest climbers shun; and though his horse Leap'd with heroic rage from crag to crag, Striking strange fire that flash'd beneath his hoofs Like lightning, near the topmost ridge the steed, Trampling on slender ledge that shiver'd, fell; And the infuriate general of an hour Lies crush'd beneath him. [Exit Soldier. MARIA. Then my husband stands Supreme, alone, and from the cloud of treachery The hero shall emerge! Enter Tendilla and Captains. TENDILLA. Is Padilla yet Return'd from victory? MARIA. Not yet; he stops not While any toils of nobleness remain To count those done. TENDILLA. We'll heap new honours on him; Giron is dead; our foes command the heights A furlong from our gates, and our sole hope Is his consent to lead us. MARIA. He shall give it. Will all the troops acknowledge him as leader, Sole and supreme? TENDILLA. All who from martial virtue Require the sense of honour, will be proud Frankly to lay aside all claims for duty To him in whose clear sovereignty of soul They place implicit trust; but there are veterans With sinews firm and courage nicely temper'd By discipline and use, who want the touch Of valour's generous impulse; these complain Of long arrears of pay, and will not serve Without some present largess. MARIA. I have jewels. Take and divide them. Could I coin my life-blood, How gladly would I pour it forth to win Padilla means of glory! TENDILLA. Noble lady, If the imparadised spirits of our saints Now read the generous promptings of your soul, How must they wish the treasures of their shrines Devoted to sustain them! MARIA. Trueâthe shrinesâ I'll make it piety to borrow thence Aid for this mighty need. Padilla comesâ No word to him, if you would have him yours, Of the base hirelings' claims, or of the treasures Which, well I know, he would not touch in thought To win earth's throne; for he holds endless ruin Lies in such sacrilege. Enter Padilla. PADILLA. Has danger reach'd The person of the Queen? MARIA. She is borne hence By soldiers who, it seems, found noiseless entrance Through treachery of her guards. PADILLA. Did she endure The outrage tamely? Did no flashing rage Confound the traitors? MARIA. No; I flung my arms Around her, and conjured the men who throng'd Her chamber to retire, and saw them falter A moment in their purpose. Then her eyes, Which had been glazed in vacant dulness, swam In sad affection for me; but they caught The blaze of jewels in the sceptre raised Before her couch, and flicker'd into joy Weak as the pleasure which a toy awakes In a sick infant. So she pass'd away Smiling and silent, with the glittering symbols Of majesty around her, which the robbers Obsequious bore. Alas! her reason's sunk Into a slumber which will break no more Till seraph harps disperse it. PADILLA (flinging down his sword). Thereâlie thereâ My sword has lost its sovereign; it has won Toledo's freedom from this night's foul ravage, And shall be drawn no more. MARIA. It shall be drawn To save Castile; you have no rival left; Giron is dead. PADILLA. Deadârivalâhow these sounds Expound each other! Rivalry with us Was but a race for death, which Giron wins A little foremost. TENDILLA. All the Captains, moved By one strong impulse, in our utmost need, Pray you to lead the troops. PADILLA. Against my king? No refuge leftâno thin disguiseâto veil The front of treason? MONDEIAR. You already wear Its ban; for Charles himself pronounces all Who join'd this quarrel traitors, and his Regent Who in the councils of the camp presides, By this day's proclamation, offers pardon, Treasure, and honour, and release of captives, To any who shall bring you to atone Treason with instant death. PADILLA. I have long felt My course would have this issue, and long musings Have braced me to endure it; I am ready; My work on earth is done. MARIA. Think upon us! MONDEIAR. Think of the sacred things these walls enfold, Huge relics of Art's infancy that speak The great Castilian soul before the Saracen Struggling from dense barbaric gloom to make Valour and beauty deathless; tombs that breathe Of deeds unchronicled, and marbles worn By kneeling saints, in which our fathers traced Old martyrdoms and crowns! Before you drop The sword that rescued these from this day's rapine Guess the triumphant insults of to-morrow! TENDILLA. Feel for the citizens of your famed birthplace And peasants born in neighbouring fields now shelter'd Beneath its towers, who drink their native air With prouder joy because your childhood breathed it; Men who so prized your fame that when you gave Adhesion to our enterprise, embraced it, Asking no reason for the strife which one So loved thought righteousâwho, if now forsaken By him they trusted, must endure the doom The Regent threatens. PADILLA. What? TENDILLA. His order runs That one of every ten who took arms with you, Chosen by lot, shall on the gibbet die; While public scourging, dealt by soldiers' arms Brand the more cursed survivorsâfor the crime Of thinking you their father! PADILLA. Have I done this? O passion wing'd to pierce a state's repose How little, at the moment, seems the touch That breaks the placid water, and how vast The eddies that sweep round it! I cannot leave Those who so trusted me, but will win peace For them, or perish with them. I accept The post you offer; let me have an hour For household cares, and I will order all things For one great sally. TENDILLA. I shall cheer the hearts Of thousands with this news. (Aside to Maria.) Lady, the rest We trust to you. MARIA. Fear not. [Exit Tendilla and Captain. My noble husband, Let me embrace you with a heart more proud Than yet has leap'd to yours. You stand apart In your own majesty, a tower of refuge Which beams from Heaven illumine. PADILLA. Say I stand Upon the arid sands a desolate mark For the next lightning; look I as of yore? Lives in my voice one old familiar tone? I am all rebel now. MARIA. No, true; most true To your own greatness and your country's need. Alphonso seeks us; do not cloud his spirit With your unjust misgivings. PADILLA. You are right; I will not mar the precious gift of youth To know disaster only when it strikes, Not when it threatens. Enter Alphonso. PADILLA. My dear son, we left Your birthday feast untasted; we'll renew it; We four are join'd again, and we'll ensure One hour of home-fraught comfort. From the ramparts, Where I will have our evening banquet spread, We shall behold the flowering shrubs that droop'd Over our household feasts. That sunset time In which our old domestic joys were shatter'd When foulest outrage summon'd me to arm, Returns with heavenly lustre that bespeaks Its golden peace. Mondeiar, inform the captains Soon after sunset, I will ask their aid To fix the morning's battle; then come to us. [Exit Mondeiar. Each pathway of our garden lives before me, In such distinct reality, that sense Like that of touch embraces it, and sunbeams That burst triumphant through yon watery clouds Will pierce the woods that shade it, till we seem To wander through the glades, and feel the arm About the waist, and head in sport reclined Upon the shoulder; come we must not lose A moment of this hour; its glory deepens! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. A Night is supposed to elapse between the Fourth and Fifth Acts. The Scenes of this Act lie in the city and neighbourhood of Toledo. Scene I. âThe Battlements of the Alcazar of Toledo.âStormy Sunrise. Enter Padilla, followed by Florio. PADILLA. Not here! Maria stole away at dawn, And I have search'd for her in vain to win One word of comfort e'er I go to battle; Boy, have you seen your mistress? [Seeing Florio. FLORIO. She went forth, And, as I heard, met other noble ladies Bent on some pious care. PADILLA. Heaven bless her in it! How happy am I that, 'midst fortune's storms, My little household, morticed in the rock That shall outlast the visible world, uplifts A pinnacle that, on its slender summit, Reflects unrisen dawn! Yet I'd not miss Maria's valiant smile. Run with best speed, And pray her join me on this height made dear By last night's feast. [Exit Florio. Those ponderous clouds that drew An awful splendour from last evening's sun Spread now a black pavilion, where the storm Waits to make noon-tide terrible. Enter Alphonso. PADILLA. My son, I must inquire at last, are you prepared For orphan'd ruin, which this battle lost Must bring on your young head? You look serene As if on some heroic pastime bent, Contemplating its prize. ALPHONSO. Such a desire Throbs in my eager heart, and hopeful waits My father's sanction. PADILLA. What have I to grant Except my prayers? ALPHONSO. The noblest of all boons, Your leave to fight beside you. PADILLA. And so risk The only treasure of a doom'd man's widow! ALPHONSO. Oh do not speak so sadly! How the tales Which you made bright with shapes of boyish valour, While at your knee I stood, reproach me now! Can I forget how children of the house Of the great Marquis of Cadiz achieved Scars from the infidel, e'er thirteen summers Flush'd in their cheeks? How King Alphonso's heir At tenderer age, with eager heart, exchanged The rare felicities of princely youth For arid battle, and, expiring, strove To trace in bloody dust consoling words Whence might be sent assurance to his home That he died happy? These, and dearer tales, Which veterans oft with swimming eyes have told me, Of your own deeds before you reached my age, Proclaim me laggard. PADILLA. If with cheerful heart I went to this day's battle, you should share it; But this will be my last. ALPHONSO. And should it be, Let me not miss the last occasion left me; How shall I ever mix in glorious war Without one living lesson from my father? PADILLA. Are you prepared to die? ALPHONSO. I think I amâ Perhaps more fit than if my age were riper. PADILLA. Have your desire; go to the priest who offers Prayers for us in the chapel; make confession As for your dying hourâit will not need To hold him long; then hither bring the sword I gave to you for sport, and I will gird it, And we will go together. ALPHONSO. Thank you, father; I'll prove no hindrance. [Exit Alphonso. PADILLA. He has chosen bravely, And has a right to choose, for on his life Lies nothing that should make death fearful. [Shouts from the city. Shoutsâ Hollow and wrecklessâ In their pause I hear A deep, low ponderous sound,âthe very sound Of the cathedral's funeral bell when heard On yonder mountains through the evening air In far-off years. [Shouts renewed. Those clamours surely rise From some unhallow'd revel:âdreadful pleasure At such a crisis! Enter Florio. PADILLA. Whence are those wild shouts? What means that funeral knell? FLORIO. I heard no knell; The shouts rise from the veteran bands who share Among them heaps of gold and gems dispersed From the cathedral's chapels. PADILLA. From the shrines? The treasures dedicate to Heaven profaned To pay my soldiers! Who has pull'd this curse On my last struggle! Tell me, that my sword May deal swift justice on the guilty! Speak! I see you know the robbersâdo not shiverâ But speak, if you would live. FLORIO. A train of ladies Attired in shroud-like vestments, moving slow With spectral pageantry and saddest music Besought the saints to pity and forgive A deed compell'd by such sad urgency As will assure its pardon. PADILLA (grasping his sword). Urgency! How durst youâ FLORIO (kneeling). Spare meâI have meant no ill. PADILLA. No ill!âStand upâYou meant no illâalas! So soon corrupted by the sophist world To use its basest words! You think those treasures Which fatal sacrilege has rifled, shows For idle gazersânay perhaps have learn'd To hold the honor'd dead who heap'd them fools Thus to bestow their wealth beyond return Of mortal use. Oh child! They are the offerings Which prodigality of boundless love And grateful adoration, wanting words For utterance, sought amidst the precious things Earth holds, to speak in beauty to the future; And on each gift a radiant angel waits To guard devotion's symbol! I must fight, By these abandon'd!âyou beheld the spoilersâ Who led them? Answerâor my sword shall search That quivering heartâspeak!âI implore you, speak! Sayâit was notâOh mercy! [Shouts renewed. Enter Maria. PADILLA. Can it be? You have no portion in this impious daring?â Say so and bless me! MARIA. I have acted boldly In firm belief that pardon will attend A deed which brings the treasures of the saints To aid a cause which, living, they had died for. PADILLA. So! I am alone; there is a gulf divides usâ All lost! MARIA. How lost? PADILLA. For this world; but that's little; I thought till now, however lapsed in duty To my anointed sovereign, I maintain'd My fealty to Heaven's eternal Law And Him who sits beyond it;âthat is goneâ And death's no refuge. MARIA (kneeling). Kill me here, and live Assoil'd from guilt my desperate love brings on thee! Do not transfix me with those eyes of stone, But slay me! PADILLA. Slay! who spoke that dreadful word? Slay! you should live for ages to implore The saints for pardon! Slay! That word means death; And, in that death, which I esteem'd a haven Of golden rest, the shadow of this hour Will follow with its vengeance. MARIA. Then divorce me; Sever your lot from mine; if I have sinn'd Beyond forgiveness, cast me off, and keep Your right to blessing,âso you let me kiss Your hand once more, and hear one gentle word Before we part for ever. PADILLA. No, Maria, I will not separate my lot from your's, Here or hereafter. Rise, and look with love Upon your blasted husband. MARIA. Blasted! Spurn me. PADILLA (raising and embracing Maria). No; thus, once more, I join my soul with yours For ever. I remember when we stood Before the Priest to consecrate the state In which the holiest ecstasy of earth Enriches the immortal, and exchanged The common vow of constancy âtill death Should part us,â which gay brides and bridegrooms take And keep without reproach till parting comes According to the word, and then forget Their loss in other contracts which they seal With the same brief formality, and pass In decent round of duty, till the grave Sets the survivor free to wed again, As if the marriage of pure hearts had bonds For mortal life alone; I felt your hand, Which had been tremulous in mine, grow firm And your eye flash'd a question on my soul Which from that soul I answer'd,âwith disdain Of the poor limitation of a span For such great bargain, and a pledge that ours Was for both worlds. I own that bond and pray That I may share your doom. MARIA. I cannot weep, For my heart's iron. PADILLA. Do you not hear a knell As from a distant church? MARIA. Noâany sound Were better than the silence. PADILLA. A funeral knell; Yet softer than before you came: its portent Seems fraught with solemn mercy. [Enter Alphonso gaily, with a helmet on, and sword in his hand. ALPHONSO. I am ready; The troops wait in the Square. PADILLA (to Maria). He goes with me. MARIA. Oh not to-day!â PADILLA. Hold!ânot a word to him. MARIA. Oh not to-day; all things in earth and sky Are charged with terror; see the river's mists Rise like huge shrouds to veil your battle-field And the air's fill'd with storm. PADILLA. We must abide it; My army will to-morrow be dissolved Unless to-day it conquers. [Girding the sword on Alphonso. Let me arm you; The sword fits well; embrace your mother. [Alphonso kisses Maria, who stands abstracted. ALPHONSO. Cold As marble! Do not fear for me; I go To win my knighthood. MARIA. GoâI dare not bless you. PADILLA (embracing Maria). Farewell, my dear one; let me see you smile; That's well; be hopeful. Now, young soldier, tread With lightest foot, for there's no freer heart In all the thousands that share this day's peril Than that you carry. [Exeunt Padilla and Alphonso.âTrumpets below sound a salute. MARIA (alone). Goneâthose trumpets greet themâ Time rushes to its cataract. [Looking over the battlements on thick mists rising from the Tagus. Part, clouds, And let me see the squadrons of our foes To mate these phantoms of despair! [Lightning. That flash Came at my call to show in jagged fire The plumes down-pouring from the mountain brow And streaming swords. [Lightning. Another flashâthey are goneâ Already in the narrow vale where Death Is busy, while the tempest veils his work. Oh for a moment's glance of yonder conflict The mists conceal, or for one battle sound Above the thunder! [Storm rages nearer. Enter Lopez. LOPEZ. Madam, will you seek The chapel where the Friar with ceaseless prayer Implores the Saints to aid us. MARIA. Saints! I am barr'd From intercession of the martyr'd dead And from all sacred roofs; but here, in right Of my remorse and wretchedness, I cry To the bare Heaven for succour! LOPEZ. Yet descendâ The winds impel a deluge which will sweep In a few moments hither. MARIA. Let it come, And wrap me in its fury. LOPEZ. As my master pass'd He pray'd me, as if life hung on the word, To urge you to take shelter; and my hand Prest as in final parting. [Weeps. MARIA. Good old servantâ You weep; I thank you; for your tears dissolve The iron at my heart, and bid it yield Obedience to its lord. Lead where you please. [Exeunt Maria and Lopez. Storm continues. Scene II. âThe Tent of the Regent Adrian pitched on the eminence of the first Scene of the Second Act.âStorm raging. The Regent and Gonsalvo. ADRIAN. The elements fight for us, but is it certain That they will conquer? If the battle hangs In doubt, I'll not be absent from the field, But brave the tempest. GONSALVO. Be assured, Lord Cardinal, Of such a victory as shall quench for ever The smouldering embers of revolt: the veterans, Struck by the loss of the distracted Queen, Whose presence gilded treason, deem the storm, That dash'd against them at their onset, wing'd By Heaven to scourge rebellion, and forsake The accursed banners to accept the pardon Your mercy offers; while Toledo's craftsmen, Though stout of heart, unused to war, will falter, Confused by double terrors. ADRIAN. Yet I'll go forthâ The storm subsides. GONSALVO. Here's one whose news may solve All doubts. Enter Soldier. GONSALVO. How stands the battle? SOLDIER. 'Tis a flightâ When the storm burst in fury from the heights And our ranks swept down with it, panic seized Padilla's choicest soldiers, and they fled Or cried for quarter, while the heroic craftsmen Struggling with desperate valour at his call To flank us towards the mountain, in the marsh That stretches eastward at the Tagus side, Sinking knee-deep, were captured, or endured Our swords unflinching. ADRIAN. Do you bring me news Of the arch-rebel, in whose death alone This treason will expire? SOLDIER. Noâbut the offer Of pardon his betrayer may assure For many traitors, with great largess, scatter'd By spies among the quailing troops, must bring Padilla to your judgment. ADRIAN. Judgment is pass'dâ That he, and chiefs who fought with him, shall die Within an hour of capture. Let the block Be planted on the loftiest rock that stands Direct before Toledo, that their deaths May freeze the hearts they snared. [Trumpets without. Those sounds proclaim Our victory complete; their blood shall seal it. [Exeunt. Scene III. âA Hall in the Alcazar of Toledo.âPadilla enters hastily, throws his helmet on a table, and sits beside it. PADILLA. All lost except these walls, which scarce will hold For time to breathe and die! But where's my sonâ He was unharm'd beside me at the gate When I protected the last gallant craftsmen That sought its shelter;âis he left without? Or here before me? Grant me strength to askâ Within there! Enter Florio. PADILLA. Is he here? FLORIO. Who? PADILLA. Who! my boyâ I mean Alphonso. FLORIO. I have not beheld him, But at the gate, a wounded soldier prays That you would hear his tidings, which, I think, Are of your son. PADILLA. Let him be tended hither: Now God grant courage! [Carillo is brought in, wearing the uniform of a common soldier, supported. You have tidings for me; You are hurtâyou are sinkingâwhat a wretch am I To torture you with question! Yet I implore you Utter one wordâwhat know you of my son? CARILLO. I am most happy that I caught these wounds In warding from his brow the swords that flash'd Around it, and so saved him. PADILLA. Then he lives? CARILLO. Lives, but borne captive. PADILLA. To the camp of Adrian! Worse fate! yet let me not be thankless to thee! I saw thee stem the flying crowd with valour Which, shared by chieftains' hearts, had changed the fortune Of this last combat; what's thy name? CARILLO. 'Tis mangled. PADILLA. I know thee now; thou art the youth Carillo Who bore my censure; well hast thou redeem'd Thy honor; oh that thou mayst live! Help! Help! CARILLO. I die contended with thy praise; may Heaven Preserve and bless thee! [He is borne out. PADILLA. Be thy frailties pardon'd! My child in Adrian's power! Most cruel duty That chains me to my station when my life, With its last desperate energy, might serve To win his freedom! Yet I must not leave The dreadful post I fill, whatever agonies Burn midst my heartstrings. I must suffer in it Till death release me. Enter Ovando, hastily. OVANDO. Do you hear the cry That rends the city? PADILLA. No; what cry? OVANDO. For you; The crowd, in terror's frenzy, call for him Who led them forth to slaughter; they will see you. PADILLA. Howâwhat said you? OVANDO. That the infuriate people Demand your presence. PADILLA. I obey their call: Forgive me; I was for a moment lost; My son isâyonder. OVANDO. Captive? PADILLA. So. OVANDO. I am heartstruck; I was too rude. PADILLA. Not so; I have no right To muse on private grief. Enter Tendilla. TENDILLA. Forgive my errand; It shames me. PADILLA. Pray speak on. TENDILLA. The Council, met In desperate haste, have voted that you stand Twixt them and mercy, and require your name To act of resignation of your power As general of the army. [Tendilla produces a parchment while Padilla eagerly speaks. PADILLA. Will they take All office from me? Strip me of my rank? Cancel the bond of duty with command? Dismiss me to the common herd of men Naked and lonely? TENDILLA. It is even so. PADILLA. Give me the scroll. [He eagerly signs and returns the scroll. There! you have done your work Briefly and well. TENDILLA. My office was a sad one; Forgive it. PADILLA. Forgive! I thank you; leave me to myself, But take my blessing with you. [Exeunt Tendilla and Ovando. I am freeâ I shall not die in vain. The Regent's offer Of pardons at the will of him who gives Padilla to the axe, shall be embraced This hour; the holy father, who prays for us Within, shall bless my mission and array me In reverend semblance, which will give free passage To Adrian's camp, to strike a noble bargain And to fulfil it gladly. Enter Florio. FLORIO. Will you see My lady for a moment? PADILLA. No; not now; Tell her I am busyâbut quite calmâand soonâ Yes; very soon, shall meet her. [Exit Florio. It is hard To leave her unembraced, yet on a moment Hangs the last issue. Heaven vouchsafe my son Life till I reach him, and I'll cast aside This robe of frail mortality, with joy More eager than, when flush'd in summer's noon With martial sports, I threw my vestments off To cleave the lucid Tagus. Youth's sweet spring Throbs in my veins as then; I trample air. [Exit Padilla. The Last Scene. âThe Tent of the Regent.âThe Storm dispersing.âAdrian discovered with Officers of his staff. ADRIAN. Bring forth the noblest prisoners; they shall first Atone their treason. [Mondeiar brought in guarded. Who is this? MONDEIAR. My name Is Mondeiar. ADRIAN. Do I, in you, behold the brother Of the arch-rebel's wife? MONDEIAR. You see the brother Of an heroic lady who exults In the affection of the noblest soldier Castile has nurtured,âwho, if his loyal heart Had not refused to listen to our prayers, Would have, ere this, been rebel to such end That you had pray'd him, on your knees, to take From you the anointing oil. I wait my doom. ADRIAN. You see it; yonder hillock bounds the course Of your life's journey. [Alphonso is brought in guarded. Who is thisâa stripling? Set him before me. You are very young To choose revolt; it may be older traitors Constrain'd you; if it was so, and you answer My questions frankly, I may show you grace. Who took you into battle? ALPHONSO. My free heart, Following a glorious father. Enter Soldier. SOLDIER. My lord, a priest Who says that, if you grant his terms, he'll give Padilla to your justice, craves admission. ADRIAN. Admit him instantly. ALPHONSO. A priest so vile! ADRIAN (to Alphonso). Your speech is bold, but your faint heart belies it; You tremble and grow pale; 'tis well; there's hope Your stubbornness may yield. Enter Padilla in the disguise of a Friar. ADRIAN. Are you the priest Who can betray Padilla? PADILLA. I will place him Within your grasp, if you accept my terms. ADRIAN. Name them. PADILLA. First, pardon for these prisoners. ADRIAN. These? Why care for them? PADILLA. No matter; 'tis my will. ALPHONSO (recognising Padilla's voice). That voice! Do not believe this Friar's rash promise; Send him away, and let your sentence fall At once upon my life. PADILLA. Peaceâlest I curse you. ADRIAN. Be silent, boy. PADILLA. He'll not offend again. ADRIAN. I pledge my word for their release; what else? PADILLA. Your promise that Toledo shall be free From spoil and insult, and her sons from vengeance. ADRIAN. If you consign Padilla to the axe, The great example shall not be obscured By meaner acts of punishment. PADILLA. Enough. Thus I resign him to you. [Padilla throws off the Friar's dress. ADRIAN. 'Tis himselfâ My knees sink under me as if constrain'd To bend before him. PADILLA. You will keep your word? ADRIAN. In all things. PADILLA. Let me clasp my son and die. [Alphonso rushes into Padilla's arms. ALPHONSO. Why did you rescue me? PADILLA. To live for Spain. ADRIAN. Your son! If you would speak apart, you may. PADILLA. I thank you; I can teach him nothing more: He has seen his father's life; he'll see his death; He'll learn no other lesson. Let me gaze One moment on my glorious birth-place, clad In solemn beauty by the storm that yields Her towers to fill my vision's grasp. Toledo, The crown of Spain; fortress of Christian faith, That from the ages of the mighty Goths, Hath kept thy liberties unblemish'd, take Fond benediction of thy dying son, John de Padilla,âwho in death enjoys The sense that his last hour has served thee well, And, with the strength of life's last rally, prays Duration for thy grandeurs while the rocks On which thou sitt'st in queenly state shall last, And glory for thy children while Castile Shall tower among the nations! MARIA (without). I am his wifeâ Padilla's wifeâmake way. PADILLA. 'Tis my wife's voice; Pray let her pass; she will less trouble you Hereafter if she see me. ADRIAN. Let her pass; She must not hold you long. PADILLA. Fear not; she'll speed me. Enter Maria, who embraces Padilla. PADILLA. Forgive me that I stole away to save Our son; he is pardon'd. MARIA. At what cost? Your life! PADILLA. He would have laid down his young life to add An hour to mine, which I have nobly used, Not worth the purchase of a day, to save him To you for many years. MARIA. Ay; many years. PADILLA. They will appear like moments when we meet Beyond those sunbreaks. MARIA. Then you think me pardon'd? PADILLA. As certainly, Maria, as I stand Enfolding you, and presently shall die; In the serenity that fills my soul I recognise assurance for us both Of full remission. ADRIAN (to his Officers). Why was such a heart A traitor's? MONDEIAR. Do you dare to call him traitor? PADILLA. Forbear, my brother; when in arms, 'twas meet To hurl such imputation back, but now Meek resignation to the will of Him Who calls me to His bar, alone should rule The parting throbs of life. I would not tax The Regent's patience further; so, at once, Farewell. Rejoice to think that e'er yon cloud, That waits upon the sun, shall drink its light Our own Joanna's little face will shine Direct upon her father's. (To Adrian.) You'll give passage For these to their old home? MARIA. Not there!âthe joys Our dear abode has nurtured, crush'd on earth, Will have no portion in etherial realms Where we shall meet; and I must henceforth breathe To dream of the Eternal. PADILLA. Think not, dearest, Our old delights will fail us; noâI feel Upon this giddy margin of two worlds, That there is nothing beautiful in this The passion'd soul has clasp'd, but shall partake Its everlasting essence; not a scent Of rain-drench'd flower, nor fleece of evening cloud Which blended with a thought that rose to Heaven Shall ever die; but link'd with joy that drew Colour and shape from this fair world, shall shed Familiar sweetness through the glorious frame After a thousand ages. MONDEIAR. Will you speak Nothing of public import;âof your course? PADILLA. Nothingâmy course is of the pastâafar Already I survey it, as I stand Assoil'd from mortal strife, in hope to win Eternal peace. So take at once farewell. MARIA. Let me go with you to the end. PADILLA. No farther; The way I see is short. Farewell for this world. [Exit Padilla, guarded. [Donna Maria remains standing in the centre of the scene, gazing after Padilla and supporting Alphonso. ADRIAN. Lead her away; thence she will see him die. MARIA. Lead me away! Think you I fear the block, The headsman, and the axe? NoâI behold A sainted hero turn those ghastly shapes To images of triumph; while it lasts These eyes shall drink his mortal greatness in; Kneel down, my son, and gaze with me; you'll see Nothing so beautiful on this side heaven. [Alphonso falls on his knees before Maria, but covers his face with his hands; she stands erect fixedly gazing in the same direction. ALPHONSO. Forgive me; 'tis not possible. MARIA. He treads Lightly as on the evening when I changed Love's vow for his; he lays his robe aside With airiest grace; he turns his headâthank God I caught that look and know it met my ownâ He kneels before me; while the sun sheds forth A slanting glory through the lurid clouds That falls upon him as a visible track From earth to heaven; and now the headsman wields His feeble axe in air. ALPHONSO. It falls? It falls? MARIA. Noâit has caught the sunbeamâand revolves Above him like a crown of glory sent To wreathe his head. He spreads his hands; his soul Breathes prayer through parted lips that keep the hue They wore in freshest youth. ALPHONSO. And now? MARIA. With God. THE END.</field>
