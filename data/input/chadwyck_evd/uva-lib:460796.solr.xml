      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene First. —Cottage and Garden of the Good Woman in the Wood. Enter Finfin, followed by Myrtis. Myr. Dear brother Finfin, prithee don't give way so, You'll cry your eyes out if you weep all day so; Why for the loss of a poor starling fret? Fin. 'Twas given to me by my dear Lirette, And she will think I held her present light. Myr. How was it that you didn't hold it tight? Fin. It was so tame—you know as well as I, To hop the twig I never thought 'twould try; Came when 'twas called, did as 'twas bid, and would Have shut the door behind it, if it could. Myr. Well, never mind—be comforted, dear brother, I'll see if I can't catch for you another. Fin. It won't be that she gave me. I could never Love it so much, or think it half so clever. A flock of starlings can't my peace restore, For dear Lirette will never love me more! Enter Lirette. Lir. That's quite true, brother—for I don't know how Lirette could love you more than she does now. Fin. What, though I've lost the bird you gave me? Lir. Pshaw! Spite of the proverb, I declare I saw Two in the bush just now, well worth the one You had in hand—and sure as any gun I'll catch them for you. Myr. So I offered too, But nothing I could say to him would do. Fin. I own it. Myrtis might have talked for years; One smile from you has dried up all my tears. Why should that be?—both sisters and both kind, Yet only dear Lirette I seem to mind. Air—Finfin—“Phillis is my only joy.” Lirette is my only joy! Her I never vex nor teaze. If I lose my game or toy She alone can soothe or please. If in the blues I mope and muse, Lirette, smiling and beguiling, Makes me happier than before! Myrtis is to me as kind, But her kindness cheer me won't! If she likes me—I don't mind; She may lump me—if she don't! Why this should be I can't well see, One still slighting, While delighting In the other more and more! Lirette is my only joy, &amp;c. Myr. The fact is, we don't want another starling, We want another brother—a nice darling, That would love me, and make of me a pet, Exactly as you do of dear Lirette. Fin., Lir. That's it! we do! Fin. Let's all run, and ask mother To find us, instantly, another brother. Lir. Yes! yes! I'm sure she will, she is so good; She found us three, you know, here in the wood, When we were little tiny babies—why, To find a fourth should she not now go try? Myr. Aye! but I shouldn't care for one so small, I want a brother who is quite as tall At least as Finfin, who can walk and chat. Fin. Ah! I don't think they're found as big as that. Lir. You must have patience, Myrtis, till he grows up, And bring him, just as I have brought this rose up. (as she is about to gather a rose from the tree, she pricks her finger with a thorn) Oh! Fin., Myr. What's the matter? Fin. Oh! a nasty thorn Has pierced her precious little finger! torn The skin, and drawn the blood! Quick, let me bind it. Dame is heard singing outside. Lir. It is not much! here's mother! never mind it! Enter Dame. Dame. What do I see? One of my pets in pain? (runs to Lirette) Let mother kiss and make it well again. (kissing her) Fin. Will kissing cure it? Oh, my stars, how prime! Won't I remember that another time. Lir. Dear mother, why do flowers so sweet and gay Have horrid thorns to prick one's finger, pray? Dame. To warn you, when at pleasure you would snatch, Beneath it lurking you may find “Old Scratch!” Fin. It only shews me that, to fear a stranger, He who would gain the prize must scorn the danger. Dame. Finfin! I will not have you be so bold! Lir. Nay, dearest mother, don't poor Finfin scold. Dame. I will! I must! he really has such notions, He fills my heart with all sorts of emotions. Lir. So he does mine; but then they're all so charming. Dame. Lirette! (aside) Good gracious! This grows more alarming! (aloud) You must not be so fond of one another. Fin. Not fond of Lirette? Lir. I! not love my brother? Dame. Love him? yes, surely, as a sister may. Lir. Law! can I love him any other way? Dame. (aside) “Oh! les enfans terrible!” I protest I scarcely know what course will be the best. Of all the questions that e'er posed a nation, None puzzle one so much as education. How far to stock young people's heads with knowledge is A stumbling block amongst the heads of colleges. And a poor dame like me must needs be beaten, With what would bother e'en a dame at Eton! Air—Dame—“We gather shells.” While some believe youth good for naught, Unless they're crammed with every lore; And others think they should be taught Perhaps to spell—but little more; There are who say, “He does as well, “Whose brains no schooling e'er beguiled; “My father never learned to spell, “Yet left a fortune to his child.” There's now a college in the Strand, Where learning's ladder climb you may— And ragged schools on every hand, Where what you learn is hard to say. For education naught we grudge! Still out one shells—for wisdom wild! And soon for “Wise as any judge,” You'll say “As learned as a child.” To trust them with the truth I've qualms about it, Yet fear to trust them longer much without it. They must not rest under a false impression Now they've arrived at years of in-discretion. (aloud) Children, I've got a story to relate. All Three. A story! O, delightful! (coming forward) Fin. Do just wait Till I have put this chair for you—we'll sit Around and hear it, mother, every bit. (places chair for Dame in the centre of the stage—she sits) Lir. (seating herself at her feet) Finfin, sit next to me. Fin. Yes, that I will! Dame. Indeed you won't! sit there, sir, and sit still, If it be possible, or you shall go Into the corner and not hear it. All Three. Oh! Dame. Well, then, be quiet. Lir. We'll be mute as mice. Fin. Now, mother, do begin! Oh, ain't it nice. Dame. Once on a time there lived a king and queen, Who were the happiest couple ever seen. Blessed with two charming babes they loved so dearly, They smothered them with kisses very nearly. Fin. Isn't it capital? Lir. Now, Finfin, don't. Dame. Perhaps, as Lirette asks you, sir, you won't. This good king had a brother very cruel, Who one day put some poison in his gruel. And soon as ever the poor king was dead, He clapped the crown on his own wicked head. Lir. Oh, what a naughty man! Fin. The vile old thief! Myr. And the poor queen? Dame. She died, alas, of grief. Lir. And the two little darlings, whom their mother And father used with kisses so to smother? Dame. The tyrant had no taste for such sweet habits, He smothered them with onions, just like rabbits. Fin. And ate 'em like an ogre? Dame. He knows best What he did with them after they were dressed. I only know that dished by royal warrant, The infant heirs were no more heirs apparent. And their bad uncle to their realms so fair, Succeeded as King Bruin, called “the Bear.” (rises) Lir. Oh! you don't mean to say the story is o'er? Dame. No, I come now to what concerns you more. The wicked king having thus gained his ends, Snugly about him quartered all his friends, His foes he quartered also, I confess, But hanged them first, which made them like it less. At least, so thought the widow of a knight, Who for the good king fallen had in fight. So moved her quarters to a forest deep, And strove to keep herself by keeping sheep. One morn, when looking for a lamb astray, She came where 'neath a lime tree sleeping lay Three little children. Lir. Little children? Myr. Three? Fin. Just as you found Myrtis, Lirette, and me? Dame. Exactly; for it is of you I speak. Fin. And it was you who went the lamb to seek? Why, then the brave knight was my father! Dame. No! Nor am I, dears, your mother. All Three. Don't say so. Fin. You must—you shall be! Lir. We will have no other. We're old enough to choose now—arn't we, brother? Fin. If we belonged another mother to, Why did not she find us instead of you? Dame. Because, poor soul, it was her fate to lose you. But here's a point that may still more confuse you. You may not all, perhaps, the children be Of the same mother. Fin. Not Lirette and me? Dame. How can I tell? Three helpless pickaninies, Wrapped in three mantles, worth three hundred guineas, With golden chains and lockets round your necks. (Each as I found it still the wearer decks.) A name, as I suppose, on each was set In jewels, “Finfin,” “Myrtis,” and “Lirette.” I brought you home, and up as mine. Lir. And so We are, and will be. I should like to know What more we want. I'm sure, if I could gain, By rubbing this small locket on my chain, Whate'er I wished, as that young Arab scamp, Aladdin, could, by rubbing his old lamp, I should be puzzled what request to make, Unless I wished just for mere wishing's sake, As I'm so fond of them—A House of Roses! Music—The cottage changes to a pavilion formed entirely of roses. Fin. And there it is, right slap before our noses. Dame. Ne'er till to day was such a house “on view!’ The furniture is all of roses too. Of damask roses all the curtains fair— Of China roses all the crockery ware. With carpets of moss roses 'neath one's feet, And rooms that are in every sense “en suite.” Myr. What if my locket had such virtue in it. Fin. Wish something—anything to try—this minute. Myr. I wish this poor little potato patch Was a fine garden, our new house to match. Music—The scene changes accordingly—In lieu of the small garden and wood, magnificent pleasure grounds extend as far as the eye can reach, with statuettes, fountains, terraces, &amp;c., &amp;c. Dame. Of some illusion we are sure the sport. I'm in a maze, as though at Hampton Court! Cremorne and Rosherville combined are there. Paterre ne'er painted such a fine parterre. With parks and grounds to walk, or hunt, or fish in, Who can deny we had good grounds for wishing! Lir. Now, Finfin, try your locket. Fin. Well, then. Here! I wish some prince would come to hunt the deer In that fine park by which our garden girt is, And fall head over ears in love with Myrtis. Myr. Law! Fall in love with me? Lir. Head over ears? Wouldn't it hurt him? Dame. Very much, my dears. (to Finfin) What of such follies, pray, sir, should you know? Fin. I've heard you talk of princes doing so In fairy tales, and so I wished— (hunting horns in the distance) Dame. Why, hark! Somebody is a hunting in the park. Myr. And here's a young man coming up this path. Dame. One of you quickly wish he was at Bath. Myr. I couldn't; I've not got the heart to do it; He is so handsome! Dame. There! I felt! I knew it! (hunting horns nearer) Enter Prince Sylvan. Prince. Madam, I beg you twenty thousand pardons; But I presume you own this house and gardens. Dame. I own I occupy them, sir, at present. Prince. An occupation, I presume, most pleasant. Your daughter, I presume, (looking at Myrtis) the rose most blooming Of all the bower. Dame. Sir, you are too presuming. Prince. Forgive me, 'tis a habit on me grown, Since I've been heir presumptive to the throne. Dame. A Prince! Prince. Prince Sylvan, step-son to King Bruin. Fin. What, the bad King? Dame. Boy, this will be our ruin. Fin. I'll wish him gone directly— Dame. 'Tis in vain. He struck poor Myrtis—she struck him again. Lir. Dear mother, when? Dame. This moment—at first sight! Fin. Well, if he struck her first, she served him right. Lir. And look where yonder, underneath the trees, He begs her to forgive him—on his knees. Dame. (seeing Prince Sylvan, who has followed Myrtis up the stage, kneeling to her) Myrtis! Prince Sylvan! What are you about? Prince. About to marry. Dame. What! my leave without? Prince. I'm told you are so good—you'll not say no; To get the licence and the ring I go. Dame. Rash Prince! you will not act so madly! Prince. Won't I! (Exit Prince) Dame. Myrtis, you don't mean that you love him? Myr. Don't I! Dame. I'm a dead woman! He'll bring Bruin here! And Bruin soon will bring me to my bier! Fin. But if we wish him not, why then he can't. Dame. Well, there's some little hope in that, I grant. And on that little I must needs rely, Since Fate has put her finger in the pie. But if you love me, and would 'scape perdition, Wish nothing more without my full permission. Quartette—Dame, Lirette, Finfin, and Myrtis—“Carry me back to Old Virginny.” Dame. If little folks had all their wishes What folly they'd oft betray. Fin. I have but one, and oh! to get it— Dame. Ah! don't you wish you may? Lir. No, let's wait till time's propitious. Myr. Or till we need help more. All Three. And then we'll wish whate'er you wish us. Dame. And wish no wish before. I then may wish you'll further wish us Than e'er we were before. (Exeunt into cottage) Scene Second. —Room in Palace of King Bruin. March and flourish—Enter King, Queen, Prince, Court, and Guards. King. Though yet of our late brother, who has been So long defunct, the memory's so green, That we have subjects who dare still look blue When that grave subject is alluded to, This is to give you all a gentle hint, Not to presume at acts of ours to squint Through spectacles of any hue but those Made by our order of “Couleur de Rose;” And sold to suit all ages and conditions, By “Wink and Company,” the Court opticians. “Verbum sat sapietiam”—you're aware 'Tis not for nothing we are called “The Bear.” Queen. That's the bare fact! King. Madam, I think you spoke! I trust you didn't mean that for a joke? Queen. Joke! I know better what becomes your wife; I never was more serious in my life. King. Humph! That may be; but yet no proof it brings. Some people's jokes are very serious things. But now, our cousin Sylvan, and step-son— Prince. (aside) A little more than cozened! I am done Unutterably brown, if all be true, I've heard since my return— King. One word with you; Since we have pitched on you to carry down The steps of time our sceptre and our crown, We've taken the first step, and deigned to make Choice of a wife for you. Prince. I'd rather take That step myself— King. It isn't what you'd rather— You'll take no step but what suits your step-father; And I repeat, I've chosen for you, so You'll choose our choice whether you choose or no. Prince. And that choice is?— King. The Princess Uglymug, The only daughter of the great Rumjug, Emperor of Japan. Prince. Oh, Day and Martin! Japan! Why she's as black as jet for certain. King. Black! What put such a notion in your head? To call her black proves you not deeply read. The Japanese have rich complexions, ninny! Their sovereign is as yellow as a guinea; His daughter's cheeks are of the same bright hue. Her hair and eyes are black— Queen. And her teeth too. King. Madam! you'll keep your tongue within your own, Or you shall hold your jaw without the bone! To argue were our dignity beneath; (to Prince) You'll marry her in spite, sir, of her teeth. Prince. Marry a yellow wife! An ugly— King. Stuff! Her father comes down handsome—that's enough. She brings so much cash with her, I shall hold Yours is the guilt if mine is not the gold. Prince. What, I'm to have the wife and you the money? King. Of course— Prince. Such course is too coarse to be funny! Let me be guilty sooner than be base— Not all Japan can varnish such a case. King. How! you object? Prince. In toto, sir—in limine! King. Thunder and lightning! Queen. (aside) Here's a storm! Oh, criminy! Prince. I've pledged my hand already. King. Pledged! You can't— You haven't got an uncle or an aunt. They're both as dead as herrings, and without My leave, 'tis treason anything to spout. Prince. I've popped, sir, to a maid I met of late. King. I'll make the poppet eat the duplicate. Where hangs she out? Speak, sir—or fly and bring her, That I may hang the belle before you ring her. Prince. Nay, then you shall hang me before I tell. King. Ha! something like a rat we think we smell. You have been hunting, sir, to-day, we hear, And found, perhaps, where someone's lodg'd a deer; What is this story they have told the Queen, About some cabin? Prince. “Uncle Tom's” you mean. King. Uncle Tom Noddy's! I don't mean a novel, But a most novel cottage, hut, or novel Built all of roses. Prince. (aside) I've been too loquacious. King. Speak, madam, you, as he is contumacious! Queen. Sir, of the story I know nothing more— 'Tis a one-storied house, with a ground floor. King. Don't think to floor me, madam, by this game. Who is the landlady, and what's her name? Queen. She has no name, sir—as I understood, They call her “The Good Woman in the Wood.” King. What! a good woman with a head on—pshaw! A sight on earth nobody ever saw. I don't believe it, but the truth I'll test, I've no doubt bad enough she'll prove at best. And if I find she's been this boy's enthraller, I'll make her look much more like what they call her. Trio“Firefly”. King. Right about, I'm without Any doubt, Where about We shall rout Your rara avis out! Young or old, Shall her bold Head be rolled Off her should- -Ers if sold We are this lout about. Queen and Prince. As I feared what he has heard, He's as savage as a bear about; Pop, oh Fate, ere 'tis too late, A muzzle on his snout. King. Right about, &amp;c. (Exeunt) Scene Third. —Interior of the House of Roses. Enter Finfin. Fin. “You may not all one mother's children be”— So mother said this morning to us three; And in my ears the words for ever jingle, And make the very tips of them to tingle. Oh! if I only at the truth could get, Which sister is not mine— (a Starling which has flown in answers “Lirette,” “Lirette,”) Fin. Lirette! who spoke? what voice was that I heard? (turns and sees Starling) My stars! my starling! oh, my truant bird! If that be true—and you've returned to aid me, It is the best return you could have made me! Lirette, you positively then assert, is Not my sister. It is— Star. “Myrtis! Myrtis!” Fin. O joy! from whence such tidings could you bring? What's here—a note tucked underneath your wing? (taking and opening it) Words set to music! Lucky for the setters I learned my notes as early as my letters! But sure the lines which are to music set, Are from the crowquill of— Star. “Lirette!” “Lirette!” Air-Finfin-“Prima Donna Waltz.” “If it be really true (reading from paper) You love me as I love you, Never was seen The knife so keen Can cut such a love in two! So I'll be yours if you'll be mine, And send by flying post a line, To say I've no objection—objection, To be for life your Valentine. If by return you don't decline Returning my affection!— For oh! If it be really true, &amp;c.” Fin. O, soothing syrup to my aching breast, Thus folded to my heart be ever pressed! Enter Dame. Dame. What is the paper you are so hot-pressing? Foolscap, I fear—a much too fit head dressing For such a silly boy! So—mighty fine, Upon my word! Why, it's a Valentine! And in Lirette's hand-writing—this ensues From teaching her to mind her P's and Q's! Duo—Dame and Finfin—“Mother, he's going away.” Dame. What is it you're doing, you bad boy? I really must send you to school; With grief I perceive, like a mad boy, In love you'll be playing the fool! Here's Myrtis, too, spinning a yarn, I In vain would its folly display— I suppose you all think you can carney Me over with kisses and blarney? Fin. But, mother— Dame. Oh, bother! Fin. But, mother, of youth it's the way. And under the rose—as we are, I suppose— Dear mother, you did so one day. Dame. If I did so, I now know much better. Lirette I'm astonished at quite! How dare she go write you a letter, Which you know, sir, to read wasn't right. 'Twas only last week she protested, When I asked her her pen to essay, That to write was a thing she detested, That her hand on a pen never rested. Fin. But, mother— Dame. Oh, bother! Fin. But, mother, it's Valentine's Day! And betwixt—at the most— You and me, and the post! You've sent one yourself, I daresay! Dame. St. Valentine I'll have no more discourse on. (flourish) Talking of Valentine—why here comes Orson, I do believe— King. (outside) Halt! Dame. To his growl I'd swear. It is the old original Black Bear! Flourish—Enter King, attended. King. Are you the woman of the house? Dame. I am. King. The Good Woman? Dame. They say so. King. That's a flam. Dame. A flam! At least, sir, 'tis not of my telling. King. Is that your only title to this dwelling? Have you no deeds to shew? Dame. 'Twould boasting be To speak of my deeds—they must speak for me. King. Woman! I ask have you a lease? Dame. Great sir, I am a forty shilling freeholder. King. I will bet forty shillings that's a fib. This house of yours is, I suspect, a crib. What have the Woods and Forests been about To let our Crown lands thus for nothing out? Who was the architect? Dame. A perfect stranger. It was run up like magic. King. There's the danger. This way the houses they run up in town, The next fine day to come with a run down. Yet, notwithstanding rents in every wall, The rent's the only thing that doesn't fall! And was it, pray, out of our royal woods You picked your sticks? Who gave you all your goods? This furniture so florid in design— The Exhibition furnished naught so fine? Dame. The same good friend. King. Name him. Dame. I ne'er heard mention Of names. It was a delicate attention To a poor widow and her orphan chicks, Left, without fixtures in an awful fix. King. Oh! you have chickens, have you?—very good. And, pray, is this young cock one of your brood? Fin. I am, old bear. King. Old bear! Dame. That's not polite. Fin. I don't care! Does he think this cock won't fight? King. Here's a game chicken we in time must check! Seize him, and wring the strutting bantam's neck. Dame. Oh, mighty monarch! Hear me for him plead! The child's a perfect innocent. King. Indeed! You have some more young innocents, no doubt? Dame. Two daughters, sire—so young they're not yet out. King. Not out! 'Tis false, and your confusion shews it. They are out and their cunning mother knows it. Have they not been to the Crown Prince presented? Dame. An accident that could not be prevented. 'Twas he, alas, who came to court—not they. King. To court a lass no doubt you mean to say. Go, drag before us this fine brace of minxes! We'll find the riddle out though 'twere the sphinx's. (music—Guards exeunt, and return with Lirette and Myrtis) Now! which is the young witch which witched our son so? Lir. Oh! as if either of us could have done so! King. Talk'st thou to me of “if's”—my wig and gaiters! Here's a preparatory school for traitors. Upon this plot of ground there's too much reason To think these groundlings have been plotting treason; On which ground we shall shortly find a spot Where by our order rubbish may be shot. Fin. But— King. But me no buts! Dame. It is useless suing! The time is past to talk of buts to Bruin! Quintette—Dame, Finfin, Lirette, Myrtis, and King—“Lucia di Lammermoor.” Dame. This the cruelest of blows is! Smash must go the House of Roses; He'll dispose of all its posies, As of so much bankrupt stock. Lir. Murder may be meditating, We've no chance but emigrating! Fin. By our timbers amputating, We alone can cut the block! Myr. On our lockets calculating, We may yet his fury mock! King. Up the traitors lock, While I here take stock! (Exeunt Dame, Finfin, Lirette, and Myrtis, guarded) King. To let, and with immediate occupation, In a most eligible situation, A villa residence—within a mile Of town—and furnished in the newest style! I couldn't fancy a more pleasant seat, When from the toils of state I would retreat; 'Tis very rarely that a king reposes, As here I may do on a bed of roses. (music—seats himself on the bed—the roses change to thorns) Oh! Oh! that wicked widow! Plague upon her! Is this the way to stuff a seat—of honour! Where is the bell? I'll for the beldame ring! (music) And— (the bell rope changes to one of nettles) Ugh! confound it! nettles! How they sting! A pretty hand I've made on't with these swell ropes, I'll hang the bell hanger in his own bell ropes! (sinks in arm-chair—it changes to one of thistles) Thistles! and (it breaks and he falls on the floor) down! (rising and coming forward) Will any body dare To call that to my face an easy chair! Star. Ha! ha! ha! ha! King. Laughed at! where is that grinner? He shall grin through a halter before dinner! Star. Ha! ha! ha! ha! a good joke! a good joke! King. It's that audacious bird! It laughed and spoke! As plain as Yorick's did! Ah, now I see! The widow is a witch, and this must be What is called her familiar—I should say Her too familiar—laughing in this way At my expense! For such familiarity I'll put a stop, my friend, to your hilarity. Here's what shall teach you to be less a talker, I'll soon walk into you, young fellow! (draws pistol) Star. Walker! King fires—The Starling flies away unhurt, but a quantity of branches and brambles fall from the roof of the cottage and enclose the King in a cage. King. Missed him, by Jupiter! Holloa! Od rot it, I've brought down everything, and never shot it! Music—Four Imps, armed with long thorns, appear, and poke at him through the branches, from which he in vain endeavours to extricate himself. Oh! you young imps! how dare you poke your fun At me! Help! Murder! Treason! Don't—adone! Imps disappear as the Guards enter hastily, followed by Dame, Finfin, Lirette, and Myrtis—Guards release the King. Dame. What is the matter, mighty ursus major? King. Oh, you vile sorceress! I'll bet a wager These are your tricks! but you shall play no more of 'em! A stake and faggots, rascals! seize all four of 'em! The witch shall burn alive—with all her brats! Dame. We're lost, though we'd as many lives as cats! Fin. Mayn't we wish now? Dame. There cannot be a doubt of it. In such a scrape— Fin. I wish, then, we were out of it! Music—Clouds envelope the King and his Attendants, who disappear amidst them. Lir. We are! we are! Our foes are out of sight. Myr. Have they retreated—or we taken flight? Dame. We're rising, I declare, o'er wood and hill! Our prospects, though, are rather cloudy still. Fin. What joy to find we're all alive and hearty. Myr. I wish Prince Sylvan though was of the party. Prince Sylvan appears through clouds. Prince. Sweet Myrtis! Myr. Oh! he heard me through the cloud. Dame. Young ladies shouldn't wish so very loud. Lir. Where are we going? Fin. I can't understand. Lir. I wish it were into some fairy-land, Where we might find protection. Dame. I should stare Just now to find protection anywhere. Change of music—Clouds disperse and discover Scene Fourth. —Basaltic Terminus on the borders of Lake Lucid. The Fairy Fragrant enters in a car drawn by Elves with garlands of roses, and accompanied by Fairies. Fairy. (to Lirette) You wished, fair maid, in Fairy-land to be, You have your wish—a fairy-land you see. Lir. I can't imagine a more fairy scene. Fairy. 'Tis called the Land of Bloom. I am its queen, Protectress of the Flowers—and likewise Ruler of all the tribes of butterflies. (to Dame) You're the Good Woman I so much have heard of. Dame. A fairy queen I mustn't doubt the word of. Fairy. Of these young people I know all the history. Dame. Indeed! Oh, then you can clear up the mystery. Fairy. I can and will—in confidence to you. Meanwhile, to prove that what I say is true, Know 'twas I placed the three babes in the wood, To two of whom as godmother I stood, And gave them those three lockets—worthless here— Where we have all we wish for—naught to fear. (taking the lockets from them) Fin. Have all we wish for! Oh, then—joy divine— Lirette will be my wife. Prince. (with Myrtis) And Myrtis mine! Fairy. 'Twas settled by your parents long ago, And I my promise gave it should be so. Therefore, strike hands, and choose your partners all, Flare up and join the Union Fairy Ball. (music) BALLET.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene First. —The Boundary of Bloom Land—(In the centre of the stage the magic oak). Enter Fairy Fragrant and Train, with Finfin, Myrtis, Lirette and Sylvan. (Music—The Fairies trip round the line of demarcation, beating the oak with their wands as they pass and exeunt) Fairy. Thus once in ev'ry year we go the rounds, And of our fairy parish beat the bounds. Behold this ancient oak, my youthful friends, It is the spot where my dominion ends. Within the circle we have traced to-day Nothing can come to injure or dismay; But step beyond it half a blade of grass, And I won't tell you what mayn't come to pass. So, for your own sakes, recollect my order, Let no temptation lure you o'er the border. Air—Fairy—“Pour Bertha”—Prophète. Let me advise, “Be merry and wise,” Of pleasure be prudence the warder; “Merry and wise,” remember, implies You mustn't go over the border! Clearly it the truth expresses, Danger waits on all excesses; Lightly you may leap the bourne, But once past there's no return. No, no, no, no. Seen from within this line appears A fragile wreath of roses— But a return from wild careers, An iron chain opposes! Out beyond that tree who launches, Treason finds in all its branches. Would you taste of joy divine, E'er in pleasure keep the line! Prince. We will in all our best obey you, madam. Fairy. I can expect no more from sons of Adam. (Exit Fairy) Lir. I'm sure we are in all our best to do so. At least, I never was so dressed, were you so? (to Myrtis) Myr. I never felt so happy, which is better. Fin. Lirette! I never answered your sweet letter. Lir. Well! now by word of mouth you can reply. Fin. I can; so take it from my lips. (kissing her) Lir. Oh, fie! Do you call that, sir, keeping within bounds? Fin. To speak my rapture words were empty sounds. Prince. (to Myrtis) Permit my lips so to express my passion? Myr. With all my heart—I'll not be out of fashion. Fin. Our promised brides, in this sweet vale of flowers, Grant us your leaves to build our nuptial bowers. Lir. First let the banns be published, sir, amid them; There's no one in this parish to forbid them. Myr. No; even mother now says we may marry. Prince. Then why postpone so sweet a partie quarèe? Come, name the day, on your fond swains take pity. Fin. To Sylvan I say ditto, in a ditty. Air—Finfin—“Com é bello.” In this land of bloom and beauty, All to bless your fond lover is courting, Flowers that hint their gentle duty, Brilliant beings around us sporting. Butterflies in bridal splendour, Here their snow-white wings display; Blue bells ring a fairy peal so tender— Haste, then, dearest—name the day! Blush not, dearest. The roses jealous, May not be perhaps so zealous. But the orange showers her blossom To crown thy brow and deck thy bosom. In the myrtles ringdoves cooing, Sweet Epithalamiums play; All to Hymen's altar wooing, Haste, then, dearest—name the day! (Exeunt Finfin and Lirette, Myrtis and Sylvan) (Music—the magic oak opens on the side beyond the boundary, and Abaddun appears). Abad. Come, here's a little job for me at last, I have been idle for a long time past. Mortals each other with such hate pursue, They leave an evil genius naught to do; Malice and envy have so darkly dyed 'em. The devil himself looks almost white beside 'em, Out of this oak had I not something carved, Like other geniuses I might have starved; But here is innocence to court temptation, And guilt to drive to deeper desperation. (stamping) Arise! King Bruin rises on a couch asleep. Awake! King. I've slept till all is blue. Holloa! where am I? (sees Abaddun) Who the deuce are you? Abad. Abaddun! King. You look like it—ev'ry view in. And what may be your business? Abad. Mischief, Bruin! King. That I can credit, too—but just allow Bruin to ask for whom you're brewing now? Abad. For you. King. For me! “For” means “against,” I fear. Abad. No! I'm your friend—a genius! King. O dear! A friend in need, then, you will prove, if any, For I ne'er knew a genius worth a penny. Abad. The Fairy Queen of Bloom Land is my foe, As she is yours. King. Mine! Is she really, though? Abad. Behold those youthful swains and shepherdesses, Paying to one another their addresses. King. My step-son, Sylvan! who went off sky-larking! And that vile trio— Abad. Know you who they are, King? Two of them are the children of your brother. King. What! those I gave Catspaw, the cook, to smother? Abad. The same. The third is Sylvan's sister, carried Off by this Fairy, that she might be married To your right royal nephew yonder! King. Living! Warning to quit, then, me they'll soon be giving! Curse on that cook—he's put me in a stew— Is there no hole that you can pull me through? Abad. Perhaps! What will you give? King. Name your own fee. Abad. (grasping his hand) Done! it's a bargain! King. (shuddering) Am I sold, or he? No matter what—I feel my eyes grow heavy. (sinks on couch) Abad. Finish your nap—I will attend your levée. The couch descends again with Bruin—Music—Abaddun takes from the hollow of the oak tree a toy, in the shape of a duck, superbly gilt and painted, with jewelled eyes and crest. Now, by my art, to make this wooden toy chuck— Carved out of magic oak—a fine decoy duck. Music—Places Duck on the stage—It becomes animated, and walks about quacking. Air—Abaddun—“Com' é gentil” (with duck obligato accompaniment). “Com' é gentil!” To hear thy bill—Quack, quack! Thus at my will—Quack, quack! That charming sound produce;—Quack, quack! Our fav'rite spell!—Quack, quack! For who so well—Quack, quack! As we can tell Of quacks the use? Of mischief what a dearth if sent a packing Were ev'ry thing on earth that takes to quacking! The grave physician—Quack, quack! The academician—Quack, quack! The politician who turns his coat each day—Quack, quack! In each condition—Quack, quack! Such imposition—Quack, quack! The poor magician Quacks less than they! Both high and low we hear the sound of quacking— The Budget mustn't sneer at “Turner's blacking!” In education—Quack, quack! In representation—Quack, quack! In emigration it goes a wondrous way—Quack, quack! In ev'ry station—Quack, quack! Through all the nation—Quack, quack! My conjuration Find favour may, By quacking half the town is money making— From “Life assuring” down to “Undertaking!” Quack, &amp;c. Abad. (to Duck) You know your duty—so to words a truce Go like a duck, and don't act like a goose. (Duck flies off) Now, my proud Fairy, I may spoil your match, And turn your shepherd's glee into a catch! Aye, see! the hunt is up—the sport's begun— Well waddled, duck—I'll back you ten to one. Lirette is first—a lady takes the lead, Dux femina facti, I may say indeed. (retires) Lirette enters, pursuing the Duck, which disappears amongst some bushes. Lir. I've lost it; but I can't be far behind it! Finfin ran t'other way, so he won't find it. Oh! if to catch it I should have the luck— I never in my life saw such a duck. It looks all gold and jewels in the sun, A “Duck of Diamonds,” if there e'er was one; And not a wild duck either—seemed quite tame, But timid, and, I thought, a little lame. I've heard of lame ducks, but I question whether When really lame, if they're in such fine feather. Where has it got to? underneath this shrub? Poor thing—perhaps it's gone to get its grub. And for its capture that's another reason, To feed on grubs 'gainst butterflies is treason! And if the Fairies knew it, they'd be huff'd, And have the pretty creature killed and stuffed With sage and onion—horrible surmise, The very name brings tears into my eyes. Air—Lirette—“Zauberflote.” My darling duck! the very thought of stuffing Bird so divine, would almost break my heart! Moses and Nicoll, spite of all their puffing, 'Twixt them can't shew a pair of ducks so smart! Yet, if the Fays found reason, To truss thee up for treason, The word most sage in season, Lost would be on grounds like these— Decide between the lady and the larder. Live, duck! or, if you disregard her, Die and repose in peas. The Duck re-appears. There! there it is again. Now do stand still. You darling duck! Here dilly, dilly, dill! That naughty Finfin frightened it so much, it Won't let me come quite near enough to touch it. But I will catch it—if I hunt all day, Go for it any lengths, or any way. Yes! such a dainty duck a prize to make, I'd take a voyage round the world—like Drake. (hunts the Duck, who runs under the oak) Nay, mine you must and shall be—willy, nilly! Here dilly, dilly, dilly, dilly, dilly! (follows the Duck round the oak, across the border, and pounces on it) Ah! now you're caught. Abad. (aside) And so are you. (a branch of the tree catches hold of Lirette) Lir. Ah, me! Enter Finfin. Fin. Lirette, Lirette! She's past the fairy tree. Return! Lir. I can't! I'm held as tight as wax. Fin. Oh, if I knew but where to find an axe. (an axe appears in the air Lir. There's one for axing—close enough to touch thee. Fin. The handle towards my hand—come, let me clutch thee. (the axe eludes his grasp) I have thee not! and yet I see thee still. Handle thy blade at any risk I will, My love to rescue from that hateful bough. (pursues the axe across the border, and is caught by another branch) Abad. (aside) Ah! my fine blade, 'tis you are handled now Fin. My eye my other senses was the fool of— A magic tool I have been made the tool of! Lir. Oh, most false axe! to cut ere you could catch it. Some fiend who lies like truth has thrown the hatchet. Enter Prince Sylvan and Myrtis. Myr. Oh, Sylvan! see, Lirette and my poor brother, Dangling beside, not after, one another! Prince. Haste we to rescue them— Lir. Take care! take care! Of one false step across that line beware. Fin. Take warning by the rash step we have taken, Nor by a rasher think to save our bacon. Prince. Fly for the Fairy, she may bring them aid! Myr. What! when her orders they have disobeyed! No, never will I shew so white a feather; For good or ill let us all hang together. (music—She crosses the border, followed by Prince— they are both seized by branches in the same way— Abaddun advances) Enter Dame, followed by Fairy Fragrant. Abad. Victory! (stage grows dark—Thunder and lightning—clouds envelope Abaddun with the four Prisoners, who gradually disappear in them) Dame. Help! Stop thief! Fairy. Stern fate forbids! Dame. What! when they've kidnapped all my precious kids? Fairy. They are beyond my power to recover; The fairy landmark they have jumped right over. Their future fate, I fear, will be a sad 'un, For they are in the power of Abaddun. Dame. Then after him to go I am a good 'un! Fairy. Stir not a step. (touching her) Dame. (immovable) Sure both my legs are wooden! O cruel godmother, who stood to two of 'em, Must I stand too—as if I nothing knew of 'em? Is this your promise?—this your gracious boon? Are you the sponsor—and make me the spoon? Fairy. Hush, my good woman; keep your temper, pray; It is too good to lose in this weak way. For disobedience they are punished sadly, But what I can do for them I'll do gladly. Dame. And what may that be? Fairy. Can't tell till I look, By spirit lamp light, in my magic book. Dame. Oh, must I stop to pore o'er musty books, When my poor lambs are hung on tenter hooks? Fairy. Come to my cabinet, this state affair To settle with the Queen in council there. Music—The clouds disperse and discover Scene Second. —The Cabinet des Fées. On the shelves of a richly-ornamented book-case are seen volumes with titles in transparency, “The Golden Branch,” “King of the Peacocks,” “Island of Jewels,” &amp;c.—On a desk in centre of stage is a volume, closed, without a title. Fairy. Behold the famous “Cabinet des Fées” And “Fairy Library,” which, I dare say, You've often heard of. Round you on the shelves, All richly spell-bound by my fairy elves, The volumes stand whose magic-woven pages Have charmed the children of all times and ages. Dame. Some I perceive whose titles I know well. I've told them often, and I've found them tell. Fairy. Those are the stage editions—done for certain; Those yet to do are kept behind the curtain. This book contains the story of yourself. (pointing to the one on the desk) Dame. I see, then, I'm not yet upon the shelf. Fairy. To read it I began not long ago, How it will end are you resolved to know? Dame. Of my own fate I would not read a line, But that of others is bound up with mine; And therefore humbly hope that it will suit your Book, to say what is “looming in the future!” Fairy. Sit then, whilst I find out how the adapter Has worked the story up in the last chapter. (opens book on desk) Dame. (aside) Thus, at a boarding school, the eager maid Through the three-volumed novel cannot wade, Till she has peeped to see if Lady Anne Does marry after all “that charming man!” Fairy. What do I see! what words my pain could paint; If I were not a fairy I should faint! Dame. What do you see? Speak! Don't suppose I'm nervous. Has fate resolved to pickle or preserve us? Fairy. Alas! I haven't got the heart to tell you; Were you a giantess the blow would fell you! Dame. I'm short in stature—that I don't deny, But put my monkey up, I'm six feet high! Whate'er my lot, let fortune smile or frown, I am a lot not easily knocked down! Malice may wound or boobyism bore me, But it must be a precious thump to floor me. Fairy. Well, then, prepare for woe. Dame. I am prepared! Fairy. The page is blank on which so long I've stared. Dame. Blank! Why then, wherefore so blank should you look, If we are neither booked nor brought to book? Fairy. Because, although imperfect just the last at, There is a sentence which I stood aghast at. Dame. 'Gainst me let any sentence be recorded. What fate to my poor wards has Fate awarded? Fairy. They're in the paws of the usurping Bear. Dame. And no brave friend to cry “paws off” is there! Fairy. He will cry “heads off” certainly for two. They can be only saved by me, or you. Dame. Then we're all right, and Bruin's beaten hollow! Fairy. I beg to say that don't exactly follow. The stars have made a fearful stipulation; One of us two must take their situation— And perish in their place. Dame. Which shall it be? Decide yourself—it's all the same to me. Fairy. Well, I confess I can't go quite that pace. There's a slight difficulty in my case: If I would perish for them—which I wouldn't— I am a fairy, and, of course, I couldn't. Dame. Then why distress yourself to that amount? Fairy. It is entirely on your account. Dame. Oh, my account I'll in a moment settle: Fate rings out an appeal to my belle metal— And I will answer as becomes a woman. Who can say more—is none! Fairy. It seems inhuman To let you go to certain execution. Dame. I go to execute my resolution. Fairy. They're not your children. Dame. That weighs not a pin. One touch of nature makes the whole world kin— Of these poor orphans I'm the sole asylum; And if my life subscription in can tile 'em, I'll pay it down with pleasure, and will dare For those dear lambs to go the entire—Bear; Fairy. You are as brave as you are good—receive This sprig of thyme, 'twill bring you a reprieve At the last moment, if you should repent. Dame. Pray keep your thyme—it were but time misspent— Fairy. Reject it not! unguarded by this spell The tyrant would but take your head as well. This leaves him not the liberty to choose, They cannot fall—if you stand in their shoes. Dame. Ah! that's two other shoes—so if I may I'll “take your thyme, Miss Lucy,” as they say, But I suspect there's no more time to spare. Fairy. Time flies, you know, that thyme will take you there. (Exit Fairy) Air—Dame—“Nelly Bly.” As I fly through the sky, With my new brougham along, I'll sweep the cobwebs, like that dear Old woman in the song. Those who would my darlings snub Shall better manners learn; I'll teach the Bear a dance so rare, 'Twill give their luck a turn. Heigh over! fly over Fairy-land and sea; To pass my thyme I'll sing a rhyme To nigger melody. Long as I have a voice, Ev'ry fear above, I'll vote for those I value, And I'll stick to those I love. With them I hand and heart Am as sure to be As yonder ball at “One” to fall By electricity. At Charing Cross. The first constructed. Heigh over! fly over Fairy-land and sea; To pass my thyme I'll sing a prime New nigger melody. Scene Third. —The Palace of King Bruin. (Same as Scene Second, Act I.) Enter King hastily, meeting Ratsbane. King. Ratsbane! Rats. Your Majesty disordered seems! King. Oh, Ratsbane, I have had such horrid dreams! Rats. Shadows, my liege, the brain's gallanty show. King. Shadows, I fear, that coming troubles throw. I have supped full of horrors all the night— Dreamed of the devil, and waked in a fright. Rats. The supper full of horrors, I suppose, Was that you took before you went to doze. King. I saw the two brats Catspaw had to smother! Rats. You'd two Welch rabbits following one another. King. That's true. Od'rabbit 'em! my heart's at ease— Good Ratsbane! I forgot the toasted cheese! This settles of such brain-sick stuff the question,— Fools call it conscience—wise men indigestion. But still with Catspaw I a word would speak— Rats. With Catspaw, sire—you had him hanged last week. King. I had forgot that too! Rats. Such trifling things May easily escape the minds of kings. King. What did I hang him for? Rats. Nobody knew. Perhaps because you'd nothing else to do. King. I don't remember—but it's no great matter, As he is hanged of course he cannot chatter. And oh, my Ratsbane! if those babes are living! Rats. Why should you think so? King. I've a strange misgiving. The Queen, too, had a daughter—Sylvan's sister. One morning, just about that time, we missed her. Rats. 'Twas rumoured she was stolen by a fairy. King. Have you heard anything to the contrary? Rats. Never. King. No more have I—but rather deem I saw her last night in that same bad dream! If so—Oh, Ratsbane! there's more fish to fry Than is dreamed of in your philos— Rats. O fie! To King so great can infants cause alarms! Particularly when they're not in arms? Duo—King and Ratsbane—“Giles Scroggins.” Rats. Consider, first—you've got the crown— King. Right! Tol de riddle, lol de ray! Rats. That you are up—and they are down— King. Right again! Tol de rol, de ray! Rats. Two Kings of Brentford!—one had squealed; But with no Richmond in the field, It cannot be your Kew to yield! King. Very right! Tol de riddle, lol de ray! Rats. Possession's nine points of the law— King. Right! Tol de riddle, lol de ray! Rats. 'Twas in a dream those brats you saw— King. Right (perhaps?) Tol de rol, de ray! Rats. But say they live, and should shew fight— Upon your side have you not might? And, having that, pray, what is right? King. Right? All—Tol de riddle, lol de ray King. My bosom's comforter! Enter Eavesdrop. What news with thee? Eaves. Prince Sylvan— King. Ah! Eaves. Returned— King. Alone? Eaves. With three Young strangers in exceedingly strange dresses! King. (aside) Ratsbane! Prince Almond and the two Princesses. Rats. So much the better—they are in your power! King. Arrest and send them all to the Black Tower! Rats. Prince Sylvan? King. He and all—shop the whole lot of them! The sons of guns—I'll very soon be shot of them! Away! (Exit Ratsbane) Eaves. My liege! without there is a bevy Of lords in waiting to attend your levee. King. Admit them! (Exit Eavesdrop) We are primed to meet the worst! Abaddun rises. Abad. I have the entrée and crave audience first. King. (aside) There couldn't be a worse, I must admit! (aloud) Where did you come from? Abad. Pray don't mention it. King. What did you come for? Abad. For my fee—I claim it, For service done—you promised I should name it. King. Well! name it. Abad. Just accept that little bill. (handing him a slip of paper) King. To oblige you, most certainly I will. (puts it in his pocket) Abad. No joking! I've your royal word—stand by it. All four are in your power. King. I don't deny it. Abad. “Name your own fee,” you said. I have and want it. King. Name it!—that's true. I never said I'd grant it. Abad. A quibble! Bruin, give the devil his due! King. No, no. The devil take me if I do! Abad. Done by a clod of clay! I feel quite dizzy. King. If you've no more to say, I'm very busy. Abad. Accept that bill. I ask you once again. King. Thou troublest me—I am not in the vein! Abad. Enough. Next time 'twill be my turn to sell! King. Till then we bid you heartily farewell. (Abaddun sinks) Having done him, I have no more to do! (music) Enter Courtiers, &amp;c. My lords and gentlemen— Enter Dame. A lady, too! Dame. Prepare thy brow to frown! Know'st thou me yet? King. By all our stars! the mother of the set Of traitors we have just now sent to quod! Dame. 'Tis even so; though you may think it odd, I come, with my own head their heads to ransom. King. Well, I must say that is uncommon handsome! Dame. My head to flatter, if 'tis your intent, I grieve I can't return the compliment. I come to bully Bruin—not to praise him! To bait the bear— King. As yet you you but amaze him! Dame. I've that to say will more your bear pole puzzle, Despite the rage which loads it to the muzzle! King. (representing a movement) Let her alone—she shall have rope enough! Such fustian cannot ruffle me. Dame. That's stuff! Your conscience pricks you, spite of all your scorns; It isn't the first time you've sat on thorns! King. Ha! Dare you own you set your royal guest on— Dame. A seat 'twould not become me here to jest on. But there are sharper points behind to weather; I now come to unseat you altogether! King. How! Dame. Aye, usurper, to that end I came! Prince Almond rightful King I here proclaim! Heir of the poisoned Philbert— King. Seize and smother The witch! Enter Queen hastily. Queen. My liege! King. The Queen? Dame. Aye, there's another Poor victim! Madam, you had once a daughter. Queen. Oh, yes! and I've just heard she's doomed to slaughter. Good woman, can you tell me of her whereabouts? Dame. She's now in the Black Tower, ma'am, or thereabouts. King. Villains, will no one stop that woman's mag? (aside) She's letting every cat out of the bag. (Guards advance, but are repulsed by Dame, who points the sprig of thyme towards them) Dame. No one can stop my mag unless I choose! I came to stand in your poor captives' shoes. King. Stand in their shoes! No, you shall fall to boot. Queen. This is past bearing. Bruin, you're a brute! King. Look to the Queen! (an Officer advances) Queen. I'm going with my daughter. (faints in the arms of Officer) King. She faints. Go! (aside to Officer) Pop her in a butt of water, And keep her under till you're sure it's over. (they bear out Queen) When she is gone Bruin may live in clover. (aloud) As to that vixen, with her arms akimbo, To the Black Tower with her—there, in limbo, To wait, with the whole crew of rosicrucians, The most excruciating executions. (music) (Exit, attended—Dame waves the sprig of thyme, which drives off the Guards) Dame. Now, Fairy Thyme, prove, without any humming, You're the good time that's been so long a coming. Air—Dame—“The Last Polka.” Fairy Thyme! in the Black Tower! Magical sprig Prove that you twig. Fairy Thyme! now is the hour— The right time of day, my flower! Bolt and bar useless are, Out of the black hole here I could soon bolt the moon, If not on parole here. Fairy Thyme, &amp;c. Hobbs, the Yankee, without humming, In less time can't pick a lock; To my friends this good Thyme coming, Will shew I know what's o'clock! Fairy Thyme, &amp;c. (Exit) Scene Fourth. —Prison Court of the Black Tower—Finfin, Lirette, Myrtis, and Prince Sylvan in chains, and fastened by other chains to rings in the wall. Quarlette—Lirette, Finfin, Myrtis, and Prince—“Olga Waltz.” All. Why did misfortune sell me, Upon my wedding day? Fin. Now chained to a wall, Lir. In sorrow we squall Myr. This burden which all Prince. The little boys bawl. A nigger song to this tune, beginning “Why did my master sell me, Upon my wedding day,” Was extremely popular at that date. Fin. And though rather more tall Than those very boys small, We are forced to sing smaller than they. All. Why did misfortune sell me, &amp;c. Lir. Eventful day! Thy happy dawn augments My sorrow at this sad chain of events. Myr. Is this the way I hoped to change my state, Or these the bonds in which I'd speculate? Prince. Sad bonds! bad change! which, like some base stock jobbery, Belie the proverb of “Exchange no robbery!” Fin. How close the parallel 'twixt our careers, And that of bubble companies appears. A cunning juggler is the scheme's projector, And a lame duck the principal director. Lured on by quacking till there comes a call On some few holders to pay up for all, You find beyond the mark you've blindly toddled, The “plant” has caught you, and the duck has waddled. In smoke dissolves the fairy-like prospectus, Friends can all blame, but deuce a one protect us. Pockets cleaned out, and body popped in prison, How many a fool in our fate looks on his'n. Music—Enter Dame through wall. Dame. Lucky for you that you have one friend still To your poor backs, with both the power and will. Prince. The dear good woman! Myr. Come with us to fall? Fin. In the same boat! Lir. Bound to the same black wall! Dame. No, I'm not bound, except by obligation, Your white bait brought me to this Blackwall Station; I'd a free passage hither, and, no doubt, Most easily could work my passage out. Fin. Our wonder with our hope your words increase. Lir. The tyrant has not battered at your peace? Dame. I come to snatch you from his fatal hug, And break about his ears his black stone jug. Fear not for me—I'm armed to bear and brave all, My own extinguisher! but yet your save-all! Fin. Your own extinguisher! Opaque remark! Put out yourself, and leave us in the dark! Dame. No, in a blaze of triumph you will rise! But lo! here Bruin comes—now ope your eyes, And shut your mouths, and see how I will laugh To scorn the bear and all his ragged staff. Enter King Bruin and Guards. King. Locks, bolts, and bars, who's making here so free? Dame. Don't agitate yourself—it's only me. King. Ho! Ratsbane! Eavesdrop! Hangdogs! what the deuce! Here's Mrs. Thingumbob, out on the loose! (Ratsbane and Eavesdrop enter hurriedly) Plotting, no doubt, a general jail delivery. Rats. Sire, we've just made the wonderful diskivery; In the strong room with fetters I confined her, But stone won't stop—nor iron help to bind her. Through granite walls she walks her chalks with ease, As if the blocks were but of chalk or cheese. Eaves. By watch and turnkey neither sound nor step heard. King. (to Dame) Zounds! are you Jack-a-Lanthorn, or Jack Shephard? Dame. You have said all along I was a witch; Are you astonished I behave as sich? King. We'll try you for one in a brace of shakes. That flagstone covers a pit full of snakes. As it mayn't easy be to hang or burn you, Into that vault 'tis our intent to turn you, And leave it to the vipers and the vermin The question of your witchcraft to determine. Dame. I'm ready 'gainst your serpents to be pitted, But first I'll see you for your crimes committed By the just judgment of the rightful King— Prince Almond! King. Up, slaves, with that flag, and fling The traitress in! Dame. Your flag she'll first haul down. To the true sovereign yield your stolen crown! (as she points the sprig of thyme to Finfin the chains fall from him and the others, and King appears in chains himself) (to Nobles and Guards) Upon your marrow-bones, you rebels, all, And hail King Almond loud as you can bawl! (they shout) (to Finfin and the others) Live for each other—now I die for you. Fin. Never say die—you never used to do! Dame. You are restored, the Fates my prayers have heard, And a good woman never breaks her word Were I to waver 'twould unchain the bear— All would be “as you was” and “as you were.” 'Tis true I'm not your mammy nor your pappy; But what's the odds so long as you are happy. Fin. Odds that against the world I'd sooner take, Than you should lay your life down for my sake. Lir. Yes! rather let us all the vault, vault in. Dame. I must go in alone—for you to win! So hence I cast the thyme that's been my stay; In such a cause, 'tis not time thrown away! (flings the sprig from her, and is about to jump into the vault, when Abaddun rises from it, and the Fairy Fragrant enters and stops her) Fairy. Hold you! (to Abaddun, who seizes King) And you hold him, and hold him fast! King. The devil! Abad. He will have his due at last. I keep my promise better far than you: I said I'd find a hole to pull you through! And here it is. (drags him into vault) When to its mouth I've got 'em, My friends must through; for it has got no bottom! (sinks with King in his grasp) Fairy. (to Dame) 'Twas but to try your heart. As true as bold! In nature, as in name, 'tis sterling gold! Go on and prosper—as all persons should Who act like the Good Woman in the Wood! (waves her wand—The scene changes to a magnificent testimonial, presented by the whole Fairy Company to the Good Woman in the Wood) Finale—“Last Polka.” Fin. Fairy time comes but once a year! Welcome it here! Greet with a cheer The friend who beside us so bravely has stood— The Good Woman in the Wood! Dame. Once again, We would fain Fairy laurels gather, You alone, to house or throne, Can make our title “good.” All. Fairy time comes but once a year, &amp;c. Tableau. CURTAIN.</field>
