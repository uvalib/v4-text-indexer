      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. A Messenger delivers a Letter, as from the Actors to the Prolocutor. After a short Perusal, she tears it with Resentment, and begins: I won't speak this Prologue:—Go tell 'em so; If they no Wit, I can some Manners shew. I put on Airs, and huff the Audience! Tell 'em 'tis rude; and argues Want of Sense.— No, Ladies, I'll an humbler Method take, And will presume no Prologue here to speak: You thought I would,—but People may mistake. Were you to wreck the fruitfullest Invention, You can't imagine what is my Intention: But, not to be too tedious, I'll explain The mighty Project of my teeming Brain. 'Tis this,—With all due Reverence and Submission, To sum up all our Wants in a Petition. Were you to know how great is our Distress, What Pains we take at Times like these for Dress, We couldn't ask your Aid without Success. No Country Heiress, that to Town resorted, Full of herself, and longing to be courted, E'er took that Care to drive the City thro', And ransack every Shop for something gay and new. First then, we move you, Gentlemen and Beaus, To furnish us with all your finest Cloaths: Fring'd Gloves, Tye-Wigs, Edg'd Hats, with smart Cockades, And Morning Gowns made all of rich Brocades: Embroider'd Coats and Waistcoats, if you'll spare them. We ask no Breeches—'ten't our Place to wear 'em. Now to you, Ladies, humbly we apply For a Fresh Grant of all your Finery: Your Brilliants, Lockets, Watches, Tweezer-Cases, Flow'rs for our Heads, and Patches for our Faces: Hoops, Fringes, Store of Pins and Bodkins, Beside a Thousand other little odd Things Too tedious here in Order to express, And not so proper for a Short Address. We're All ambitious of appearing fine, And fain would with uncommon Lustre shine. Then send these Trinkets in without Delay, And your Petitioners shall ever pray.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. Enter Manlius and Clodio. Manlius. Come hither, Clodio, thou must leave thy Play, And be my little Mercury To-day. Thou hast a pretty, forward, winning Face, And may'st in time deserve a better Place. Can'st thou cajole and flatter? Can'st thou tell A Lover's Story to a Lady well. If so;—Go to Eudosia's Chamber—On her wait, And entertain her with thy harmless Chat. Thou'lt gain an easy Audience from the Fair; Thy prattling Nonsense she'll with Pleasure hear: Perhaps regard, my Boy, what thou shalt say, Tho' when I speak, she turns with Scorn away. In thy Discourse let drop thy Master's Name, And whisper now and then his ardent Flame. Perhaps thy Tongue may prove a Cupid's Dart, And melt with his soft Fires her frozen Heart. Clod. Great Sir, I'll do the very best I can, And wish (to serve you more) I was a Man; But as I am, I can run to and fro, And drop a careless Letter as I go; Can, while my Lady dresses, sing a Song, (Which she'll suspect not, as I am so young) Wherein your Love shall bear the greatest Part, And that Way steal a Passage to her Heart. Manl. There's my good Boy, thou understand'st me well; And may'st thou with Success my Passion tell. If not,—a thousand Ways I'll still contrive; New Plots I'll form to make my Hopes revive: In various Shapes I will pursue my Love, Shapes more than Proteus knew, or the dread Thund'rer Jove. But ere I go, exert thy little Art, And let me hear how thou wilt act thy Part. Practise thy Song before me, let me see How thy soft Sounds will with my Love agree. Clod. With Pleasure I obey.—But, my good Lord, If I succeed, I hope you'll keep your Word. [Clodio sings. The SONG. I. 'Tis agonizing Pain to love, Where we can meet with no Return; To find the Fair as Marble cold, While in tormenting Fires we burn. II. O do not then, Celestial Maid, To the Great Manlius cruel prove! The coyest Nymph that e'er was known, With Joy resign'd her Charms to Jove. Manl. O! may thy little Arts propitious prove, And melt the beauteous Virgin down to Love! If thou but prosper'st, thou shalt be supply'd With all New Play-Things, and a Horse beside. SCENE II. Scene draws, and discovers Eudosia sitting at a Table, with a Book in her Hand, and Lucia attending by her. She reads part of a Poem against Sensual Pleasures. Mistaken Man! Is this the fansy'd all, The tinsell'd Nothing, that we Pleasure call? Oh shameful Barbarism! No Figure can excuse The vile Absurdity, the gross Abuse. Pleasure is only proper to the Soul, That can our misled Faculties controul. Ah! Could we but with searching Knowledge come Into some quiet Soul's Withdrawing-Room! Content, hem'd round with Joys, we there might find: Content, the celebrated Sabbath of the Mind. [Eudosia shuts the Book, and rises. With what a Lustre must that Virgin shine, The Objects of whose Thoughts are all divine! Whose free-born Soul does like the Eagle rise, And whilst on Earth converses with the Skies. Luc. Madam, to Heav'n I own Devotion's due; But no cold Vestal ever liv'd like you. In Contemplation your whole Time is spent: The Bow, methinks, should sometimes be unbent. Some little Pleasures the kind Gods approve, And Heav'n's great Queen obeys the Calls of Love. Venus would court Adonis to her Arms, And the chast Moon confess Endymion's Charms. Why then should you such licens'd Joys despise, And look on Manlius with such scornful Eyes? Eud. Lucia, thy ill-tim'd Arguments forbear; Thou know'st his Name's ungrateful to my Ear. Sure thou'rt instructed, hast receiv'd a Fee, To prove an Advocate for him with me. But all in vain; for I shall ever prove Cold as a Statue to his ardent Love, Luc. Pardon me, Madam, I'd no other View In the Proposal, but my Zeal for you. His Wealth and Grandeur would melt me, I own: I couldn't scorn a Lover with a Crown. Eud. Scepters and Crowns, 'tis true, are dazzling Things! But anxious Cares attend the best of Kings. Soft, easy Quiet sits not on a Throne; Nor can a Monarch call one Day his own. In my Opinion, happier is the Swain, That daily labours on the verdant Plain, Where Nature's Landscapes only charm his Sight. With all her unexpensive, green Delight. As for my Part, tho' Fate has rais'd me high, In pleasing Solitude I'll live and die: To Heav'n alone devote my future Days; And sing, whilst I have Life, Diana's Praise. [Eudosia sits down to her Book again. Clodio knocks at the outward Door. Eud. Lucia, step down, and see who knocks below. [Lucia goes out. And returns again. Luc. 'Tis Clodio, Madam, come to wait on you. Eud. Well, let him up. (Lucia goes out.) What would the Prattler have? The Play-Things which I promis'd him, I gave. SCENE III. Lucia introduces Clodio to Eudosia. Eud. So, Sir, and what's your weighty Errand pray? Clod. To sing you the New Song I learn'd to-day. Corelli set it, and the Air is fine, So are the Words; for you must know they're mine. Eud. Thy Infant-Poetry no doubt must charm; Must needs be innocent and void of Harm. Well then begin, thy little Skill exert, And I'll reward thee to thy just Desert. Clodio sings. Tis agonizing Pain to love, Where we can meet with no Return, &amp;c. Eud. Fie, Clodio, fie, why wouldst thou tell me Lies? Thy Fancy never could such Thoughts devise. You shou'd be whipt, young Man, for Songs like these. Clod. What should I sing then? for I fain would please. Eud. Psalms, Clodio, Psalms, and sometimes Hymns divine. Their Air's melodious, and Composure fine. Clod. Psalms, Madam!—School-Boys only sing Psalm-Tunes: We Pages, better taught, sing Court-Lampoons. Eud. Go, get you gone, you idle Prattler, go; I'll never love you more for talking so. [Frowns. Clod. I beg your Pardon, Madam, on my Knees: What I have said I'm sorry should displease. Oh! send me not without a Smile away: Be Friends again, or I shall cry all Day. Weeps. Eud. Well, well, I am: This Fault I shall forget! But have a Care how you the next commit. Clodio bows and goes out. How soon corrupted is a tender Mind! How soon are Youth to vicious Thoughts inclin'd! Too few, alas, the Paths of Virtue tread, Who're nobly born, or in a Palace bred. [As Eudosia is going out, she meets Manlius, and turns back in Disorder. SCENE IV. Enter Manlius to Eudosia. Manlius. Why dost thou thus, fair Maid, thy Lover shun? Why veil those Eyes by which he is undone? Thou should'st have hid their killing Fires before, Or mingled kind Compassion with their Pow'r. Eud. Why will you thus in vain disturb my Rest? How often have I begg'd you to desist? So many Times I have your Suit deny'd, Methinks, my Lord, you might be satisfy'd, Manl. Think of the wondrous Patience of my Love! Let my unwearied Zeal thy Pity move! Think of the Pains your cold Rebukes create! Think how a Prince lies prostrate at your Feet! Oh! cease to wound me with your angry Eyes; For my fond Passion, tho' supprest, will rise. As the weak Reed, when the cold North Wind blows, Yields to the boist'rous Blasts, and lowly bows: Yet still the Storm insults it but in vain, By slow Degrees it swells, and mounts again. Eud. Why will you still your luckless Passion move, And follow One that is averse to Love? Manl. Because my Peace of Mind is that Way flown, And I must find her out, or be undone. Eud. Oh! think not, Sir, I e'er shall ease your Pain: Virtue's impregnable; your Siege is vain. Manl. Sure some ill Planet rul'd when I was born, That I should thus become a Woman's Scorn! Aside. You think with Pride my Pow'r you may withstand, Because I sue for what I might command. [To her. O Madam! think a little, with what Ease I, as a Monarch, might the Blessing seize! But Force dissolves the Pleasures we propose, And more the Tyrant, than the Lover shows, O do not then my long'd-for Joys deny! Name your own Terms, and Manlius will comply. Eud. Could you then sully your unspotted Fame, And quit your Honour for a lovesick Flame? Could you the Censures of the World despise, For such a Conquest, such a trifling Prize? Manl. A Trifle!—No,—To Heav'n thou art ally'd; Art Nature's Master-Piece, her greatest Pride: Thy Form, when finish'd, she with Pleasure view'd, Excell'd herself, and own'd the Work was good. Eud. Oh! that those Charms had perish'd in the Bud! Manl. O direful Imprecation!— Eud. —Not too great, When those soft Charms my Ruin would create. Cease, cease your Suit; for Virtue can't comply: Or do a Deed of Mercy,—let me die. Manl. Inexorable Fair, why shouldst thou prove So bold a Rebel to the Cause of Love? Eud. Consider, Sir, when Vice and Virtue meet, They must run counter, can't incorporate. Manl. Must we then part forever?— Eud. —Ever part. My Resolution's fix'd.— Manl. —You'll break my Heart. Eud. To chaste Diana I'll for Refuge fly, Will live a Virgin, and a Virgin die. [she goes out. Manlius alone. She's gone,—with fierce Resentment in her Eyes: Yet still, if possible, I'll win the Prize. What Wiles, what Stratagems can do I'll try, And if all fail, to sweet Revenge I'll fly. My Love repuls'd with double Fury burns, And by her Scorn enrag'd to Madness turns. So when a Fire a Field of Corn does seize, If the Wind's hush, it burns by slow Degrees: But if a furious Tempest chance to rise, At once the Flame does the whole Field surprize, And mounts with Fury to the distant Skies. The End of the First ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. Scene I. Enter Manlius and Clodio. Clodio. Let not your Brows, my Lord, such Wrinkles wear! Your Clodio cannot your Displeasure bear. All I could do, to urge your Suit, I did; I sung the little amorous Song you made, And every Thing, I thought would please, I said; Yet still she frown'd:—Go, thou'rt a naughty Boy; Thou shouldn't thus, said she, thy Thoughts employ. If thou'rt disposed to sing, sing Hymns divine: Church-Musick, Clodio, is exceeding fine. Who could have thought that one so wondrous fair, Could be so superstitious, so austere? Manl. Well, well, I am not angry, my dear Boy; I shall at last the frozen Fair enjoy. Tho' some small Clouds at present intervene, The Sky ere long will be again serene. Tho' all thy Art could no Impression make, The Scheme I now have form'd must surely take. Granius, my Boy, shall on Eudosia wait, And lay these blazing Jewels at her Feet. [Shews a Bracelet. A Gift so costly must successful prove, Must make her Virtue nod, and yield to Love: So the coy Danaë was charm'd by Jove. [Manlius goes out, Clodio follows him. SCENE II. Enter Eudosia and Granius: Lucia attending at a Distance. Eud. Talk not to me, officious Slave, of Love: All thy Persuasions will successless prove. Go, tell thy Master, I his Flame despise Tho' Manlius sues, Eudosia still denies. Gran. Oh, fair Eudosia, if my Master's Charms Cannot attract you to his longing Arms, Think on his Wealth; let that your Fancy raise: See, with what Lustre all these Jewels blaze! Here wanton Cupid plays with subtle Art, And every glittering Gem appears a Dart. [Offers her the Bracelet. Eud. Granius, be gone, and back thy Presents bear; Tell Manlius I his Bracelet scorn to wear; Tell him his Passion does ungrateful prove, And my Disdain is equal to his Love. Come, virtuous Lucia, now the Hour's at Hand, When we before Diana's Shrine should stand, Should at her Altars our Devotion pay, And beg the usual Blessings of the Day. Still art thou there?— [Looks earnestly on Granius. My flutt'ring Heart with high Resentment beats; For Virtue suffers when with Shame she treats. Ye Powers divine, who guard a Virgin's Fame, Let no licentious Wish my Breast enflame. [She goes on: Lucia following, Granius calls her back. SCENE III. Gran. Lucia! Lucia. What News, my Granius! What Success?—Declare. Gran. Great Manlius loves, yet loving must despair: Eudosia proves as scornful as she's fair. No Vestal Virgin e'er was half so cold; Pray'rs can't prevail, nor yet Almighty Gold. Behold, the glorious Present she withstood! Shews the Bracelet. Sure she was never made of Flesh and Blood! 'Tisn't a Virtue, Lucia, but a Vice, To be so very coy! so very nice. Lucia, Must Women then, because they've beauteous Eyes, Resign at once, be made an easy Prize? No Granius, No:— Our Sex a Lover's Onsets should withstand, And ne'er surrender, but with Sword in Hand. Gran. And could my Lucia then so cruel prove, With real Pleasure torment her Love? To smile at all his anxious Cares and Pain, And not compassionate her dying Swain? Luc. Granius, thou know'st how much thy Form I prize; How much I doat upon those killing Eyes: How freely I could fly into thy Arms, And yield with Joy to thee my youthful Charms: Yet still, I own my Vanity, 'tis great To see a Lover prostrate at one's Feet: See him all drown'd in Tears before one lie, Languish and pine, and seem at least to die. Gran. Hark! Manlius comes:—My Lucia, pray retire; Thou must not now be seen:—He's all on fire:— His Eye-Balls start:—He rages with Despair;— Yet loves, and is resolv'd t'obtain the Fair. [Lucia goes out. Granius retires to the farther Part of the Stage. SCENE IV. Enter Manlius, Clodio, and other Attendants. Manl. Oh! God of Love, thou anxious, pleasing Guest, How are thy Votaries pain'd, and yet how blest! Now like a Ship in thy vast Ocean tost, Now seem in Port, yet in a Moment lost! Now restless Fears like tumbling Surges roll, Now rising Hopes revive their drooping Soul! [Sees Granius. Granius, What News from the fair Maid I love? Will she be kind, or does sh'obdurate prove? Gran. 'Tis hard, Great Sir, a Woman's Thoughts to read, From any Words that from her Tongue proceed. Manl. Hold me not in Suspence!—Oh, ease my Pain! And say, dear Granius, say what Hopes remain. Am I to live; or am I to despair? Speak boldly, and my Fate at once declare. Gran. Then Sir, to mitigate your raging Pain, Take This:—This fully will your Fate explain. [Returns the Bracelet. Manl. Does then the cruel Fair still scorn my Love? Will no Persuasions the cold Virgin move? Is she so very coy, so wondrous nice, To slight a Present of so great a Price?— Granius, This Treatment I can never bear.— Eudosia's Fetters I'll no longer wear.— It is resolv'd,—The beauteous Maid shall bleed,— And Vengeance shall my injur'd Love succeed. —Yet hold,—Methinks she hovers round my Heart.— My Blood runs cold.—'Twill fatal prove to part.— O! Granius, some new Stratagem contrive, To make my dying Hopes once more revive. Upon thy Art, thy Friendship I rely: For if Eudosia's lost, I surely die. Gran. Vengeance, my Lord, will ne'er your Love appease; Like Oil, 'twill make the Flame more fiercely blaze. Some other Way your Granius will devise To gain a Conquest o'er Eudosia's Eyes.— [Pauses. —I have it;—you shall wed her in Disguise. Your scornful Fair's a superstitious Maid, And thro' her Zeal with Ease may be betray'd. Manl. Go on:—There's mystic Musick in thy Tongue: Thy Words are sweeter than the Syren's Song. Gran. Oft' she with Lucia to the Temple goes, And at Diana's Altar pays her Vows. There you shall come, and stand before her Eyes, In all the Pomp Religion can devise: Like Great Apotlo come, and in his Name Make known with sure Success thy ardent Flame. With Gifts profuse suborn the Priestly Train; They'll join, and bless the pious Fraud for Gain. Manl. Kind Statesman, I thy Politicks approve: Take this,—as earnest of my future Love. [Gives him a Diamond Ring. Still serve my Flame, and you shall never want Any Reward, that Manlius can grant. I'll summon all the Priests, thy Scheme disclose, And bribe them high as wisely you propose. Granius this Signet to Octavia bear. Take Gold untold:—No Pains, no Cost I'll spare, To melt into my Arms this Frozen Fair. Granius goes out. Manlius alone. O beauteous Goddess! O bright Queen of Love, Look down, and to my Wish propitious prove. Oh! let her Heart once feel thy pleasing Fire, And breathe into her Soul some soft Desire; He goes out. SCENE V. Enter Granius, Lucia following him. Luc. Granius! Gran. My dearest Love, I must not, dare not stay; But to the Temple I must haste away: Yet 'ere I go, receive this little Store, [Gives her a Purse of Gold. And if thy Granius prospers, think of more.— My rising Genius now is busy grown, And Fortue seems resolv'd my Worth to crown. My Breast now glows with Thoughts of sudden State, And Jove declares that Granius shall be great. Luc. Let such vain Transports, Granius, stand confin'd, And to thy meaner Fortunes suit thy Mind. These Extasies would far more welcome be, Rightly employ'd on tender Love and me. Gran. For that we will some other Time allow; Business of great Importance calls me now. Thy Interest in great Manlius Suit I crave: Prove but successful, and I'll be thy Slave. Luc. A Bribe more precious Lucia ne'er can have. [They go out severally. SCENE VI. The Temple of Diana. Four Priests come forward, and bow to the Altar, several other Priests attending. 1st Priest. To thee we bow, Great Sister of the Sun. 2d Priest. Accept our Homage, and look kindly down. 3d Priest. Accept our Incense, and incline thine Ear, 4th Priest. And be propitious to our fervent Pray'r. While the Priests are performing their respective Ceremonies, the Musick plays after a solemn Manner. SCENE VII. Enter Eudosia, Lucia, and other Atendants. The Priests turn from the Altar, and address themselves to Eudosia. 1st Priest. Hail! sweet Eudosia, happiest of thy Race! Brightest of Forms! Thou Nature's Master-Peice. 2d Priest. Sure framing thee Heaven took unusual Care, By its own Beauties he designed thee Fair, And form'd thee by the best lov'd Angel there. 3d Priest. Thy Coldness to Great Manlius can't be blam'd; Thy Mortal Beauties have a God inflam'd. 4th Priest. Our bright Apollo has beheld thy Eyes, And now from Heav'n, to wait on thee, he flies. Eud. This wondrous Honour is too great to bear; My Heart it fill'd with a Religious Fear. 1st Priest. Your Fears, tho' pious, yet all groundess prove, Since 'tis your bounded Duty now to love. 2d Priest. O! don't presume to thwart Heav'n's great Design, But with Submission to the God resign. 3d Priest. So shall a Train of Joys possess thy Soul, And heavenly Transports all thy Powers controul. 4th Priest, But if profanely you reject his Love, Withstand his Offer, and disdainful prove, Soon will that Bloom of Beauty fade away, And Sickness make thy youthful Charms decay. Eud. Yet still I doubt:—Some further Proof declare, That you from Heav'n this wondrous Message bear. 1st Priest. Last Night as in the Temple late we pray'd, Apollo call'd: We strait the Call obey'd, And listen'd with Surprise to what he said. 3d Priest. Arise, said he, and to Eudosia go: What Honours I've design'd her let her know. 3d Priest. Strait to the Temple let the Maid repair; Soon her Apollo will with Pomp appear. 4th Priest. Before her Eyes will Great Apollo stand, And from Herself her Beauteous Self demand. Eud. I yield, I yield; new Transports fire my Breast, Seraphic Joys too great to be exprest: Uncommon Pleasures glide thro all my Veins, And amply recompence my former Pains. 1st Priest. Look up, bright Maid, Apollo does appear. 2d Priest. I see him sailing in the ambient Air. 3d Priest. Let all your Instruments of Musick sound, And solemn Measures beat the hallow'd Ground. 4th Priest. Honours like these uncommon Joys demand. Behold!—The Great Apollo is at hand! A Curious Machine is seen in the Air, descending slowly: During which Movement Eudosia stands fixt with Admiration, and the Priests sing a short Hymn to Apollo. SCENE VIII. Manlius alights from the Machine, disguis'd like Apollo; with Mercury, and several other Celestial Attendants. Manl. Oh! fair Eudosia, than the Stars more bright! The Graces gaze upon thee with Delight: Not Venus self has half such conquering Charms, And Cupid revels in thy snowy Arms. Fir'd by thy Eyes, I've left my Realms above, And seek (like Jove) my Bliss in Mortal Love. Eud. Without Dispute I to thy Will resign, And, as in Duty bound, my Soul is thine. Manl. Now then, in Honour of Eudosia's Name, Our solemn Nuptials let the Priests proclaim: And let the joyful Trumpets Sound declare, Eudosia is as Loving as she's Fair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Altho' our Scenes in Antient Rome were laid, In Fact 'twas Egypt where this Farce was play'd, But that's a Bagatelle; the Moral's all, By which we must expect to stand or fall. Hence then we learn the fatal Pow'r of Gold, And how Self-Interest rul'd the Priests of Old: How in Times past Religion was a Trade, And Idol-Worship but a Masquerade: How by such Arts the Virtuous were misled, And by a too implicit Faith betray'd. None here, we hope, will censure this Contrivance; Our Modern Gownsmen scorn such Vile Connivance. Our Ladies too have now-a-days more Wit, Than, like our Fair Eudosia, to be bit: Know how more artfully to play their Game, And make their Priest secure, not hurt their Fame.</field>
