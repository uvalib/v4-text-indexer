      <field name="fulltext">TO THE WORTHILY Honoured, Henry Osborne Esquire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus. I. ScÃ¦na I. Enter Sebestiano and Antonio. Seb. The noble curtesies I have received At Lisbone worthy friend, so much engage me That I must dye endebted to your worth, Vnlesse you mean to accept what I've studied. Although but partly to discharge the summe Due to your honour'd love. Ant. How now Sebastiano will you forfeit The name of friend, then I did hope our love Had outgrowne complement. Seb. I speake my thoughts, My tongue and heart are relatives, I thinke I have deserved no base opinion from you; I wish not onely to perpetuate Our friendship, but to exchange that common name Of friend, for Ant. What? take heede, do not prophane; Wouldst thou be more then friend? it is a name, Vertue can onely answer to, couldst thou Vnite into one, all goodnesse whatsoe're Mortality can boast of, thou shalt finde, The circle narrow bounded to containe This swelling treasure; every good admits Degrees, but this being so good it cannot: For he's no friend is not superlative. Indulgent parents, brethren, kindred, tied By the naturall flow of blood; alliances, And what you can imagine, is to light, To weigh with name of friend: they execute At best, but what a nature prompts e'm to, Are often lesse then friends, when they remaine Our kinsmen still, but friend is never lost. Seb. Nay then Antonio you mistake, I meane not To leave of friend, which with another title Would not be lost, come then Ile tell you Sir, I would be friend and brother, thus our friendship Shall like a diamond set in gold not loose His sparkling, but shew fairer; I have a paire Of sisters, which I would commend, but that I might seeme partiall, their birth and fortunes Deserving noble love; if thou beest free From other faire ingagement, I would be proud To speake them worthy, come shalt go and see them: I would not beg them sutors, fame hath spred Through Portugall their persons, and drawne to Avero Many affectionate gallants. Ant. Catalina and Berinthia. Seb. The same. Ant. Report speakes loud their beauties, and no lesse Vertue in either, well, I see you strive To leave no merrit where you meane to honour, I cannot otherwise escape the censure Of one ingratefull, but by waiting on you Home to Avero Seb. You shall honour me, And glad my noble Father, to whom you are No stranger, your owne worth before, hath beene Sufficient preparation. Ant. Ha? I have not so much choise Sebastiano, But if one Sister of Antonios, May have a commendation to your thoughts, I will not spend much Art in praysing her, Her vertue speake it selfe, I shall be happy, And be confirmd your brother, though I misse Acceptance at Avero. Seb. Still you out doe me, I could never wish My service better plac'd, at opertunity Ile visit you at Eluas, i'th meane time Lets hast to Avero, where with you Ile bring My double welcome, and not faile to second Any designe. Ant. You shall teach me a lesson Against we meete at Eluas Castle sir. Exeunt. Enter Gaspar de Uilarezo, and a Servant. Uil. What gallants sirra are they newly entred? Ser. Count de Monte Nigro my Lord, and Don Valasco, Vil. Give your observance then, I know their businesse; Catalina and Berinthia are the starrs Direct them hither, Gaspars house shall give Respect to all, but they are two such Iewels, I must dispose maturely, I should else Returne ingratitude upon the heavens For leaving me such pledges, nor am I, Like other fathers carried with the streame Of love toth youngest, as they were in birth They had my tendernesse, Catalina then Is eldest in my care, Berinthia Her childs part too, both faire and vertuous; But daughters are held losses to a family, Sonnes onely to maintaine honour and stemme Alive in their posterity, and I now thinke on't, My sonne Sebastiano hath beene slow In his returne from Lisbone, oh that boy Renewes my age with hope, and hath returnd My care in education, weight for weight With noble quality, well belov'd byth best Oth Dons in Spaine and Portugall, whose loves Do often stretch his absence to such length As this hath beene. Enter Count de monte Nigro, and Catalina. But heres my eldest daughter With her amorous Count, Ile not be seene, Exit. Cata. You have beene absent long my noble Count, Beshrew me but I dreamt on you last night. Count. Ha ha, did you so, I tickle her in her sleep I perceive; Sweete Lady I did but like the valiant beast, Give a little ground, to returne with a greater Force of love, now by my fathers sword And gauntlet thart a pretious peece of vertue, But prethee what didst dreame of me last night? Cata. Nay twas an idle dreame, not worth the repitition. Count. Thou dreamst I warrant thee, that I was fighting For thee up to the knees in blood, why I dare doo't, Such dreames are common with Count de monte Nigro, my sleepes are nothing else but rehearsals of Battels, and wounds, and ambuscadoes, Donzell Delphebo Was a Mountebanke of vallour, Rosiobeere a puffe; My dreames deserve to be ith Chronicles. Cata. Why, now my dreame is out. Count. What? Cata. I dreamt that you were fighting. Count. So. Cata. And that in single combate, for my sake You slew a giant, and you no sooner had Rescued my honour, but there crept a pigmee Out of the earth, and kild you. Count. Very likely, the valliantst man must dye. Cata. What by a pigmee? Count. I, thats another giant, I remember Hercules Had a conflict with'em, oh my Dona Catalina I well would I were so happy once to Maintaine some honourable duell for thy sake, I shall Nere be well, till I have kild some body; fight, tis true I have never yet flesht my selfe in blood no body Would quarell with me, but I finde my spirit prompt If occasion would but winke at me, why not? wherefore has Nature given me these brawny armes, this manly bulke, And these Collossian supporters nothing but to sling The sledge, or pitch the bare, and play with Axletrees; if thou lovest me, do but command me Some worthy service; pox a dangers I weigh 'em no More than fleabitings, would some body did hate that Face, now I wish it with all my heart. Cata. Would you have any body hate me? Count. Yes, Ide hate 'em, Ide but thrust my hand into their Mouth downe to the bottome of their bellies, plucke Out their lungs and shake their insides outward. Enter Berinthia and Valasco. Ber. Noble Sir, you neede not heape more protestations, I do beleeve you love me. Val. Doe you beleeve I love, and not accept it? Ber. Yes I accept it too, but apprehend me As men doe guifts, whose acceptation does not Binde to performe what every giver craves; Without a staine to virgin modesty I can accept your love, but pardon me, It is beyond my power to grant your suite. Val. Oh you too much subject a naturall guift, And make your selfe beholding for your owne: The Sunne hath not more right to his owne beames, With which he gildes the day, nor the Sea lord Of his owne waves. Ber. Alasse, what ist to owne a passion Without power to direct it, for I move, Not by a motion I can call my owne, But by a higher rapture, in obedience To a father, and I have yet no freedome To place affection, so you but endeere me Without a merit. Cata. Heres my sister. Cou. And Don Valasco, how now, are thy arrowes feathred Val. Well enough for roving. Count. Roving I thought so. Val. But I hope faire. Count. Shoote home then; Valasco I have Presented my mistris with a paper of verses, see she Is reading of 'em. Val. Didst make 'em thy selfe. Cou. My money did, what an idle question is that? as tho we That are great men, are not furnished with stipendary Muses, I am sure for my owne part I can buy 'em Cheaper than I can make 'em a great deale, would You have learning have no reward, she laughs At 'em, I am glad of that. Ber. They savour of a true Poeticke fury. Count. Do you smell nothing, something hath some savour. Cata. But this liue my thinks hath more feete than the rest. Cou. It shold run the better for that Lady, I did it a purpose. Cata. But heres another lame. Count. That was my conceit, my owne invention, lame Halting verses, theres the greatest Art, besides I Thereby give you to understand, that I am valiant, Dare cut of legs and armes at all times and make 'em Goe halting home that are my enemies, I am An Iambographier, now it is out. Cata. For honours sake what's that? Count. One of the sourest versifiers that ever crept out of Pernassus when I set on't, I can make any body hang himselfe With pure Iambicks, I can fetch blood with Ascelpiads Sting, with Phalonciums whip, with Saphicks Bastinado, with hexameter and pentameter, and Yet I have a trimeter left for thee my Dona Catalina. Ber. Conclude a peace sir with your passion, I am sory love hath beene unkind to you, To point at me, who, till she first have knit The sacred knot of marriage am forbid To thinke of love. Val. But I cannot desist, I am in love with every thing you say, This your deniall as it comes from you Bids me still love you, pardon faire Berinthia, Valasco hath not power to rule himselfe; Be you lesse faire, or vertuous, perhaps I may abate my service. Enter Vilarezo, Sebestiano, and Antonio. Vila. Old Gaspars house is honourd by such guests, Now by the tombe of my progenitors, I envied, that your fame should visit me So oft without your person, Sebestiano Hath beene long happy in your noble friendship, And cannot but improve himselfe in vertues, That lives so neere your love. Cata. Don Antonio de Riviero. Seb. The same. Cata. With whose noble worth You oft have fill'd discourse, thought your selfe happy In his choyce friendship; if his body cary So many graces, it is heaven within, Where his soule is. Vila. Sebastiano, thou hast largely recompenc'd Thy tedious absence, you shall dishonour me, Vnlesse you thinke your selfe as welcome here, As at your Eluas Castle, Uilarezo Was once as you are sprightly, and though I say it Maintaind my fathers reputation, And honour of our house with actions Worthy our name and family, but now, Time hath let fall cold snow upon my haires, Ploughed on my browes the furrowes of his anger, Disfurnishd me of active blood, and wrapt me Halfe in my seare cloth, yet I have minde That bids me honour vertue, where I see it Bud forth and spring so hopefully. Anto. You speake all noblenesse, and encourage me To spend the greenenesse of my rising yeares So to thadvantage, that at last I may Be old like you. Uila. Daughters speake his welcome, Catalina. Cata. Sir you are most welcome. Count. Howes that? she sayes he is most welcome, he were Not best love her, she never made me such a reverence For all the kisses I have bestowed upon her since I first opened my affection, I do not like this Fellow, I must be faine to use doctor Sharkins cunning. Ual. It were not truely noble to affront him; My blood boyles in me, it shall coole againe, The place is venerable by her presence, And I may be deceiv'd, Ualasco then Keepe distance with thy feares. Anto. How now Antonio, where hast thou lost thy selfe? Strucke dead with Ladies eyes? I could star-gaze For ever thus, oh pardon love, gainst whom I often have prophan'd, and mockd thy fires, Thy flames now punish me, let me collect: They are both excellent creatures, there is A Majestie in Catalinaes eye, and every part carries ambition Of Queene upon it, yet Berinthia Hath something more than all this praise, though she Command the world, this hath more power ore me; Here I have lost my freedome, not the Queene Of love could thus have wounded poore Antonio: Ile speake to her; Lady I'm an Novice, yet in love. Ber. It may be so. Anto. She jests at me, yet I should be proud to be Your servant. Ber. I entertaine no servants that are proud. Val. Divine Berinthia! Anto. She checks my rudenesse that so openly I seeme to court her and in presence too Of some that have engaged themselves perhaps To her already. Uila. Come let us in, my house spreads to receive you, Which you may call your owne, Ile leade the way. Cata. Please you walke Sir. Ant. It will become me thus to waite on you. Exeunt. manet Count and Valasco. Count. Does not the foole ride us both? Ual. What foole? both, whom? Count. That foole, both us, we are but horses and may Walke one another for ought I see before the doore, when he Is alight and entred. I do not relish that same Novice, he were not best gull me; harke you Don Valasco, what shals doe? Val. Doe, why? Count. This Antonio is a sutor to one of 'em. Ual. I feare him not. Coun. I do not feare him neither, I dare fight with him, and He were ten Antonios, but the Ladies Don, the Ladies. Ual. Berinthia, to whom I pay my love devotions, in my eare Seemd not to welcome him, your Lady did. Coant. I but for all that he had most mind to your mistris, And I do not see but if he pursue it, There is a possibility to scale the fort, Ladies Mindes may alter, by your favour, I have lesse Cause to feare o'th two; if ht love not Catalina My game is free, and I may have a course in Her Parke the more easily. Val. Tis true, he preferred service to Berinthia, And what is she then to resist the vowes Antonio if he love, dare heape upon her? He's gracious with her father, and a friend Deere as his bosome to Sebastiano, And may be is directed by that brother To aime at her, or if he make free choyce, Berinthias beauty will draw up his soule. Count. And yet now I thinke on't, he was very sawcy With my love to support her arme, which she Accepted too familiarly, and she should But love him, it were as bad for me, for tho he care Not for her, I am sure she will never abide me after it, By this hilts I must kill him, theres no remedy, I cannot helpe it. Ual. Ile know my destiny. Count. And I my fate but here he comes. Enter Antonio. Ant. The strangest resolution of a father I ever heard, I was covetous To acquaint him with my wishes, praid his leave I might be servant to Berinthia, But thus he briefly answered, untill His eldest daughter were dispos'd in marriage His youngest must not love, and therefore wisht me, Vnlesse I could place Catalina here, Leave off soliciting, yet I was welcome, But fed on nothing but Berinthia, From whose faire eyes love threw a thousand flames Into Antonios heart, her cheeks bewraying As many amorous blushings, which brake out Like a forc'd lightning from a troubled cloud, Discovering a restraint, as if within She were at conflict, which her colour onely Tooke liberty to speake, but soone fell backe, And as it were checkt by silence. Cou. Ile stay no longer, sir a word with you, are you desperat? Ant. Desperate, why sir? Count. I aske and you be desperate, are you weary of your Life, and you be, say but the word; some body can tell How to dispatch you without a physitian, at a minuits warning. Anto. You are the noble Count de monte Nigro. Count. I care not a Spanish fig what you count me, I must Call you to account sir; in briefe the Lady Dona Catalina is my mistris, I do not meane to be baffled While this toole has any steele in't, and I have some Mettall in my selfe too.

Count. I can endure no more, Diablo, he is mortally in love With Catalina. Uala. Tis so, he's tane with Catalinaes beautie. Count. Sir I am a servant of that Lady, therefore eate up Your words, or you shall be sensible that I am Count De monte Nigro, and she's no dish for Don Antonio. Ant. Sir I will do you right. Count. Or I will right my selfe. Cata. He did direct those prayses unto me This doth confirme it. Ber. He cannot so soone alter, I shall discover a passion through my eye. Count. Thou shewest thy selfe a noble Gentleman, the Count is now thy friend. Ant. Does it become me sir, to prosecute Where such a noble Count is interessed, Vpon my soule I wish the Lady yours, Here my suite fals, with tender of my service; Would you were married, nay in bed together My honourable Count. Cata. Your face is cloudy sir, as you suspected Your presence were not welcome; had you naught But title of a brothers friendship, it were Enough to oblige us to you, but your worth In Catalinaes eies, bids me proclaime you A double acceptation. Ant. Oh you are bounteous Ladie. Count. Sirâ Ant. Doe not feare me, I am not worthie your opinion, It shall be happinesse for me to kisse This Ivory hand. Count. The whilst I kisse her lip and be immotall. Seb. Antonio my father is a rocke, In that he first resolved, and I account it part of my Owne unhappinesse, I hope you hold me not suspected. Ant. I were unworthy such a friend, his care Becomes him nobly; has not younder Count Some hope of Catalina. Seb. My father thinkes that sister worthy of More than a bare Nobility. Ant. Ile backe to Eluas noble sir, This entertainement is so much above Antonios merit, if I leave you not I shall be out of hope toâ Vila. Nay then you mocke me sir, you must not leave me Without discourtesie so soone, we triflle time, This night you are my guest, my honored Count, My Don Valasco. Count. Yes my Lord, wee'le follow. Ant. Ha I am resolv'd, like Barge-men when they row. Ile looke another way then that I goe. Exeunt.</field>

Exit. Enter Catalina and Ualasco. Cat. Sir, you love my sister. Val. With an obedient heart. Cat. Where do you think Don Antonio hath made choice To place his love? Ual. There where I wish it may grow older in desire, And be crown'd with fruitfull happinesse. Cat. Hath your affection had no deeper roote, That tis rent up already, J had thought It would have stood a Winter, but J see A Summer storme hath kil'd it, fare you well sir. Ual. How's this, a Summers storme! Lady by the honour of your birth, Put off these cloudes, you maze me, take off The wonder you have put upon Valasco, And solve these riddles. Cat. You love Berinthia. Ual. With a devoted heart, else may I die Contempt of all mankinde, not my owne soule Is deerer to me. Cat. And yet you wish Antonio may be crown'd With happinesse in his love, he loves Birinthia. Val. How? Cat. Beyond expression, to see how a good nature Free from dishonour in it selfe, is backward To thinke another guilty, suffers it selfe Be poisoned with opinion, did your eyes Emptie their beames so much in admiration Of your Berinthias beauty, you left none To observe your owne abuses. Uala. Doth not Antonio dedicate his thoughts To your acceptance, 'tis impossible, I heard him praise you to the heavens, above 'em; Made himselfe hoarse but to repeate your vertues As he had beene in extasie; love Birinthia? Hell is not blacker than his soule, if he Love any goodnesse but your selfe. Cat. That lesson he with impudence hath reade To my owne eares, but shall I tell you sir? We are both made but properties to raise Him to his partiall ends, flattery is The stalkeing horse of pollicy, saw you not, How many flames he shot into her eyes When they were parting, for which she pay'd backe Her subtill teares, he wrung her by the hand, Seem'd with the greatnesse of his passion To have beene o're borne, Oh cunning treachery! Worthy our justice, true he commended me; But could you see the Fountaine that sent forth So many cozening streames, you would say Sty: Were Christall to it, and wast not to the Count, Whom he suppos'd was in pursuite of me; Nay, whom he knew did love me, that he might Fire him the more to consummate my marriage That I disposed he might have of accesse To his belov'd Berinthia, the end Of his desires I can confirme it, he praid To be so happy with my fathers leave To be her amorous servant, which he nobly Denied, partly expressing your engagements; If you have least suspition of this truth: But dee' thinke she love you? Val. I cannot challenge her, but she has let fall Something to make me hope, how thinke you shee's Affected to Antonio? Cat. May be Luke warme as yet, but soone as as shees caught, Inevitably his, without prevention. For my owne part I hate him in whom lives A will to wrong a Gentleman, for hee was Acquainted with your love, 'twas my respect To tender so your injury, I could not Be silent in it, what you meane to doe I leave to your owne thoughts. Ual. Oh stay sweete Lady, leave me not to struggle Alone with this universall affliction; You speake even now Berinthia would be his Without prevention, oh that Antidote, That Balsome to my wound. Cat. Alas I pitty you, and the more, because I see your troubles so amaze your judgement, Ile tell you my opinion sir oth' sudden; For him, he is not worth Valasco's anger; Onely thus, you shall discover to my Father, She promis'd you her love, be confident To say you did exchange faith to her; this alone May chance assure her, and if not I hav't: Steale her away, your love I see is honourable, So much I suffer when desert is wounded, You shall have my assistance, you apprehend me. Val. I am devoted yours, command me ever. Cat. Keepe smooth your face, and still maintaine your worship With Berinthia, things must be manag'd And strucke in the maturity, noble sir; J wish You onely fortunate in Berinthias love. Val. Words are too poore to thanke you, I looke on you As my safe guiding starre. Exit. Cat. But I shall prove a wandering starre, I have A course which I must finish for my selfe. Glide on thou subtill mover, thou hast brought This instrument already for thy aymes, Sister, Ile breake a Serpents egge betimes, And teare Antonio from thy very bosome; Love is above all law of nature, blood, Not what men call, but what that bides is good. Exit. Enter Castabella and Villandras. Uil. Be not so carefull Cooze, your brothers well. Be confident if he were otherwise You should have notice, whom hath he to share Fortunes without you? all his ills are made Lesse by your bearing part, his good is doubled By your communichaing. Cast. By this reason All is not well, in that my ignorance What fate hath hapned, barres me off the portion Belongs to me sister, but my care Is so much greater, in that Diego whom J charg'd to put on wings, if all were well, Is dull in his returne. Enter Antonio and Diego. Uil. His Master happily hath commanded him To attend him homewards, this is recompenc'd Already, looke they are come; Y'are welcome sir. Ant. Oh sister, ere you let fall words of welcome, Let me unlade a treasure in your eare Able to weigh downe man. Cast. What treasure brother, you amaze me. Ant. Never was man so blest, As heavens had studied to enrich me here, So am I fortunate. Vil. You make me covetous. Ant. I have a friend. Uil. You have a thousand sir, is this your treasure? Ant. But I have one more worth then millions, And he doth onely keepe alive that name Of friendship in his breast, pardon Villandros, Tis not to straine your love, whom I have tried, My worthiest cozen. Cast. But where is this same friend, why came he not To Eluas with you, sure he cannot be Deare to you Brother, to whom I am not indebted At least for you. Die. I have many deare friends too, my Taylor is one To whom I am indebted Ant. His Commission Stretch'd not so farre, a Fathers tie was on him, But I have his noble promise, er't be long, We shall enjoy him. Cast. Brother I hope You know how willingly I can entertaine Your blisse, and make it mine, pray speake the man To whom we owe so much. Ant. Twere not charity to starve you thus with shaddowes, Take him, and with him in thy bosome locke The Mirrour of fidelity, Don Sebastiano. Cast. I oft have heard you name him full of worth, And upon that relation have laid up, One deare to my remembrance. Ant. But he must be dearer Castabella, harke you sister, I have beene bold upon thy vertue, to Invite him to you, if your heart be free. Let it be empty ever, if he doe not Fill it with noblest love, to make relation, What zeale he gave of a worthy nature, At our last parting (when betwixt a sonne, And friend he so divided his affections And out did both) you would admire him: were I able I would build a temple where We tooke our leave, The ground it selfe was hallowed So much with his owne piety, Diego saw it. Die. Yes sir, I saw, and heard, and wondred. Ant. Come I will tell you all, to your chamber sister, Diego our plot must on, all time is lost Vntill we try the mooving. Die. If the plot please you sir, let me alone to play my part I warrant you. Ant. Come Castabella, and prepare to heare A story not of length but worthy your eare. Exeunt Enter Vilarezo, Valasco, and Catalina. Vil. You have not dealt so honourably sir, As did become you, to proceede so farre Without my knowledge, give me leave to tell you You are not welcome. Ual. My Lord I am sorry, If I have any way trangrest, I was not Respectlesse of your honour, nor my fame, Ualasco shall be unhappy, if by him You shall derive a staine, my actions faire, I have done nothing with Berinthia, To merit such a language, twas not ripe, For me to interrupt the father, when I knew not What grace I hold with her. Uil, Hell on her grace, is this her duty? ha, I can forget my nature if she dare Make so soone forfeit of her piety; Oh where is that same awfull dread of Parent, Should live in children; tis her ambition To out runne her sister, but Ile curbe her impudence, Cata. Retire your selfe, this passion must have way, This workes as I would have it, feare nothing sir, Obscure. Exit Ual. Vil. Ile cloyster her, and starve this spirit Makes her deceive my trust; Catalina Vpon thy duty I command thee, take Her custody on thee, keepe her from the eye Of all that come to Averro, let her discourse With pictures on the wall, I feare she hath Forgot to say her prayers, is she growne sensuall? Cata. But my Lord. Uil. Oh keepe thy accents for a better cause, She hath contemd us both, thou canst not see What blemish she derives unto our name. Yet these are sparkes, he hath a fire within, Will turne all into flames, wheres Ualasco? Cata. Good sir, a much afflicted worthy Gentleman, At your displeasure. Vil. Thou art too full of pitty, nay th'art cruell To thy owne fame, he must not have accesse To prosecute, it was my doting sinne, Of too much confidence in Berinthia, Gave her such libertie, on my blessing punish it, Twill be a vertuous act, the snow I thought Was not more innocent, more cold, more chaste, Why my command bound her in ribs of ice, But shees dissolv'd, to thee Ile leave her now, Be the maintainer of thy Fathers vow. Exit Val. Why I am undone now. Cata. Nothing lesse, this conflict Prepares your peace, I am her guardian, Love smiles upon you, I am not inconstant, Having more power to assist you, but away, We must not be discri'd, expect ere long To heere what you desire. Ual. My blisse I remember. Exit Cata. Berinthia, y'are my prisoner, at my leisure Ile studdy on your fate, I cannot be Friend to my selfe, when I am kind to thee. Exit</field>

Well I will try, I am resolv'd; stay, here hee is Pedro, you are acquainted with him, breake the ice, he is alone. 2. Blesse you Mr. Doctor; sir presuming on your Art, here is a fellow of mine, indeede the Butler, for want of a better; has lost a dozen of Dyaper spoones, and halfe a dozen of silver Napkins yesterday, they were seene by all three of us in the morning betweene sixe and seven set up, and what spirit of the Buttery hath stollen 'em before eight, is invisible to our understanding. 3 He hath delivered you the case right, I beseech you sir doe what you can for a servant, that is like to be in a lamentable case else, heres a gratuity. 1. Now we shall see what the devill can do, hey, heres one of his spirits I thinke. Sh.

Sh. Mercury is above the Moone man. 3. Alas sir tis a great way thither. 1. Did not I tell you you would be gull'd. Sh. Well y'are a servant, Ile doe something for you; What will you say, if I shew you the man that stole your Spoones and Napkins presently, will that satisfie you. 3 Ile desire no more, oh good Mr. Doctor. 1 If he does that, ile beleve he has cunning. Sh. Goe to, heares a glasse. 2 Loe you there now. Sh. Stand your backes North, and stirre not till I bid you; What see you there? 3 Heres nothing. Sh. Looke agen, and marke, stand yet more North. 3 Now I see somebody. 1 And I. The Count comes from behind the Hangings and muffled in a cloake steales of the Stage. Sh. Marke this fellow muffled in the cloake, he hath stolne your spoones and Napkins, does he not skulke. 1 Foote tis strange, he lookes like a theefe, this Doctor J see is cunning. 3. Oh rogue how shall's come by him, oh for an Officer, Sh. Yet stirre not, 3. Oh hees gone, where is he? Sh. Be not too rash, my Art tells me there is danger in't, you must be blinfold all, if you observe me not, all is to no purpose, you must not see till you be forth a doores, shut your eyes, and leade one another, when you are abroad open them, and you shall see agen. 3.

My maidenhead sir, you can tell by my water. Sh. Dost not thou know? Ma. Oh I doe somewhat doubt my selfe, for this morning when I rose, I found a paire of breeches on my bed, and I have had a great suspition ever since, it is an evill signe they say, and one does not know what may be in those breeches sometimes; sweete Mr. Doctor, am I a maid still or no, I would be sorry to loose my maidenhead ere I were aware, I feare I shall never be honest after it. Sh. Let me see Vrina meretrix; the colour is a strumpet, but the contents deceive not, your maidenhead is gone. Ma. And is there no hope to finde it againe? Sh. You are not every body, by my Art, as in other things that have beene stolne, he that hath stolne your maidenhead shall bring it againe. Ma.

Doctor, I am out of breath, where be these wormes crept, I was never so abused since I was swadled: harke you; those 3. Rogues that were here even now, began to lay hold of me, and told me I must give them their Spoones and Napkins; they made a theefe of mee, but I thinke I have made their flesh jelly with kickes and bastinadoes; oh I have no mercy when I set on't, I have made e'm all poore Iohns, impudent varlets; talke to me of Spoones and Napkins. Sh. Alas one of them was mad, and brought to me to cure him. Count. Nay they were all mad, but I thinke I have madded e'm; I feare J have kickt two or three out of their lives; alas poore wretches I am sorry for it now, but J have such an humor of beating &amp; kicking when my footes in once: harke you Doctor, is it not within the compasse of your physicke to take downe a mans courage a thought lower; the truth is, I am apt of my selfe to quarrell upon the least affront ith' world, J cannot be kept in, chaines will not hold me: totherday for a lesse matter than this, I kickt halfe a dozen of high Germans, from one end of the streete to the other, for but offering to shrinke betweene mee and the wall; not aday goes o're my head but I hurt some body mortally; poxe a these rogues, I am sorry at my heart I have hurt e'm so, but I cannot forbeare. Sh. This is strange. Count. How? I can scarce forbeare striking you now, for saying it is strange; you would not thinke it: oh the wounds J have given for a very looke; well harke you, if it be not too late, I would be taken downe, but I feare tis impossible, and then every one goes in danger of his life by me. Sh. Take downe your spirit, looke you, dee see this inch and a halfe, how tall a man doe you thinke he was? He was twelve cubits high, and three yards compasse at the waste when I tooke him in hand first, ile draw him through a ring ere I have done with him: I keepe him now to breake my poysons, to eate Spiders and Toades, which is the onely dish his heart wishes for; a Capon destroyes him, and the very sight of beefe or mutton makes him sicke; looke, you shall see him eate his supper, come on your wayes, what say you to this Spider? looke how he leapes. Sca. Oh dainty. Sh. Here, saw you that? how many legges now for the hanch of a Toade. Sca. Twenty, and thanke you sir, oh sweete Toade, oh admirable Toade. Count. This is very strange, I nere saw the like. I never keew Spiders and Toades were such good meates before; will he not burst now? Sh. It shall nere swell him, by to morrow hee shall be an inch abated, and I can with an other experiment plumpe him and highten him at my pleasure; ile warrant ile take you downe my Lord. Count. Nay but dee here, doe I looke like a Spider-catcher, or Toade-earer. Sh. Farre be it from Sharkino, I have gentle pellets for your Lordship, shall melt in your mouth, and take of your valour insensibly; Lozenges that shall comfort your stomacke, and but at a weeke restraine your fury two or three thoughts; does your honour thinke I would forget my selfe, I shew you by this Rat what I can doe by Art: your Lordship shall have an easie composition, no hurt ith' world in't; here take but halfe a dozen of these going to bed, e're morning; it shall worke gently, and in the vertue appeare every day afterward. Count. But if I find my selfe breaking out into fury, I may take e'm often; heres for your pellets of Lozenges, what rare physicke is this? Ile put it in practise presently, farewell Doctor. Exit. Sh. Happinesse wait on your egregious Lordship, my physicke Shall make your body soluble, but for working on your spirit, beleeve it when you finde it; with any lies we must set forth our simples and compositions to utter them: so this is a good dayes worke; leane chaps lay up, and because you have perform'd hamsomly, there is some silver for you, lay up my properties: Tis night already, thus we knaves will thrive, when honest plainnesse know not how to live.

Ant. Promise me the hearing, And shat have any satisfaction, Becomes my fame. Mount. So, so, he will submit himselfe, it will be our honor. Ant. Wert in your power, would you not account it A pretious victory, in your sisters cause, To dye your sword with any blood of him, Sav'd both her life and honour? Seb. I were ungratefull. Ant.

Valasco was the man, appointed by That goodly sister to steale Berinthia, And Lord himselfe of this possession, Just at that time; but heare and tremble at it, Shee by a cunning poyson should have breath'd Her soule into his armes, within two houres, And so Valasco should have borne the shame Of theft and murther; how doe you like this sir. Seb. You amaze me sir. Ant. Tis true by honours selfe, heare it confirm'd, And when you will, I am ready. Vil. Pitty such valour should be imployd, Vpon no better cause, they will enforme him. Mount. Harke you sir, dee thinke this is true? Vil. I dare maintaine it. Mount. Thats another matter, why then the case is Altered, what should we doe fighting, and lose Our lives to no purpose. Sf.

And my names Sforza sir, you were not best to come here to brave us, unlesse you have more legges and armes at home, I have a saza shall picke holes in your doublet, and firke your shankes, my gallimaufry. Seb. I cannot but beleeve it, oh Berinthia, I am wounded ere I fight. Ant. Holds your resolve yet constant? if you have Better opinion of your sword, then truth, I am bound to answer, but I would I had Such an advantage gainst another man, As the justice of my cause, all vallour fights But with a sayle against it. Vil. Take a time to informe your father sir, my noble Cozen is to be found here constant. Seb. But will you backe with me then? Ber. Excuse me brother, I shall fall too soone Vpon my sisters malice, whose foule guilt Will make me expect more certaine ruine. Ant. Now Sebastiano Puts on his judgement, and assumes his noblenesse, Whilst he loves equity. Seb. And shall I carry shame To Villarezoes house, neglect of father, Whose precepts bindes me to returne with her, Or leave my life at Eluas, I must on, I have heard you to no purpose, shall Berinthia Backe to Avero. Ant. Sir she must not yet, tis dangerous. Seb. Choose thee a second then, this Count and I Meane to leave honor here. Uill. Honour me sir. Ant. Tis done, Sebastiano shall report Antonio just and noble, Sforza sweare Vpon my Sword, oh doe not hinder me If victory crowne Sebastianoes arme. I charge thee by thy honesty restore This Lady to him, on whose lip I seale My unstain'd faith. Mount. Vmh, tis a rare physitian, my spirit is abated. Cast. Brother. Ber. Brother. Seb. And wilt thou be dishonourd? Ber. Oh doe not wrong the Gentleman, beleeve it Dishonour nere dwelt here, and he hath made A most religious vow, not in a thought To staine my innocence, he does not force me Remember, what a noble friend, you make A most just enemy, he sav'd my life, Be not a murtherer, take yet a time, Runne not your selfe in danger for a cause Carries so little justice. Mount. Faith sir, if you please take a time to thinke on't, a month or two or three, they shall not say but wee are honorable. Cast. You gave him to my heart a Gentleman, Seb. whisp. Compleate with goodnesse, will you rob the world And me at once, alas I love him. Ant. Never man fought with a lesser heart, the conquest Will be but many deathes, he is her brother, My friend, this poore girles joy. Mount. With all my heart, Ile post to Avero presently. Seb. Let it be so Antonio. Cast. Alas pore Castabella, what a conflict Feest thou within thee, their fight woundeth thee, And I must die, who ere hath victory. Ant. Then friend againe, and as Sebastiano, I bid him welcome, and who loves Antonio Must speake that language. Sfor. Enough, not a Masty upon the Castle walls But shall barke too, I congratulate thee, if thou Beelest friend to the Castle of Eluas, and still my name Is Sforza. Ant. Well said my brave Adelautado, come Sebastiano, And my Birinthia by to morrow we shall know The truth of our felicity. Exeunt. Enter Vilarezo. Uil. What are the Nobles more than common men When all their honour cannot free them from Shame and abuse; as greatnesse were a marke Stucke by them but to give direction For men to shoote indignities upon them? Are we call'd Lords of riches we possesse, And can defend them from the ravishing hand Of strangers, when our children are not safe From theeves and robbers, none of us can challenge Such right to wealth and fortunes of the world, Being things without us; but our children are Essentiall to us, and participate Of what we are: part of our very nature, Our selves but cast into a younger mold, And can we promise, but so weake assurance Of so neere treasures. O Uillarezo shall Thy age be trampled on, no, it shall not, I will be knowne a father, Portugall Shall not report this infamy unreveng'd, It will be a barre in Uilarezoes armes Past all posterity; Enter Catalina. Come Catalina, thou wilt stay with me, Prepare to welcome home Sebastiano, Whom I expect with honour, and that baggage Ambitious girle Berinthia. Cat. Alas sir; censure not her too soone, Till she appeare guilty. Uil. Heres thy vertue still, To excuse her Catalina, no beleeve it, Shes naught, past hope, I have an eye can see Into her very heart, thou art too innocent. Enter Ualasco. Ualasco welcome too, Berinthia Is not come home yet, but we shall see her Brought backe with shame; and ist not justice, ha? What can be shame enough? Val. Your daughter sir? Uil. My daughter? doe not call her so, she has not True blood of Vilarezo in her veines; She makes her selfe a bastard, and deserves To be cut off like a disordered branch, Disgracing the faire tree she springeth from. Val. Lay not so great a burthen on Berinthia, Her nature knowes not to degenerate; Vpon my life she was not yeelding, to The injurious action; if Antonio Have plaied the theefe, let your revenge fall there, Which were I trusted with, although I doubt not Sebastianoes fury, he should feele it More heavy than his Castle, what can be Too just for such a sinne? Vil. Right, right Ualasco, I doe love thee fort, Tis so, and thou shalt see I have a fence Worthy my birth and person. Val. 'Twill become you, but I marvell we heare nothing Of their successe at Eluas, by this time I would have sent Antonio to warme His fathers ashes, doe you not thinke sir? Sebastiano will not be remisse, A gentle nature is abus'd with tales, Which they know how to colour; heres the Count. Enter Monte nigro sweating. Cat. How, the Count? I sent him thither to be rid on him; The foole has better fortune than I wisht him, But now I shall heare that, which will more comfort me, My sisters death most certainely. Mont. My Lord, I have rid hard, read there, your sonne And daughter is well. Cat. Ha, well? Mount. Madam. Cat. How does my sister? Mount, In good health, she has commendations to you In that letter. Val. And is Antonio living? Mount. Yes, and remembers his service to you, Val. Has he then yeelded up Berinthia? Mou. He will yeeld up his ghost first, I know not we were Going to flesh baste one another, I am sure but the Matter of fellony hangs still, who will cut it downe; I know not, Madam theres notable matter against you. Cat. Me? Mount. Vpon my honor there is, be not angry with me, No lesse than theft and murder, that letter is charg'd Withall, but you'le cleare all I make no question, they Talke of poysoning. Cat. Am I betray'd? Mount. Well, I smell, I smell. Cat. What do you smell? Mount. It was but a tricke of theirs to save their lives, For we were bent to kill all that came against us. Uil. Catalina reade here, Ualasco, both of you, And let me reade your faces, ha? they wonder. Val. Howes this, I steale Berinthia? Cat. I poyson my sister. Val. This doth amaze me. Cat. Father, this letter sayes I would have poysoned my poore sister, innocence defend me. Vil. It will, it shall, come J acquit you both, They must not thus foole me. Moun. Madam I thought as much, my minde gave me, it Was a lye, yes, you looke like a poysoner, as much As I looke like a Hobby-horse. Cat. Was ever honest love so abused, have I So poore reward for my affection. Uil. It shall be so. Ual. Madam I know not how the poyson came in, but I Feare some have betraied our plot. Cat. And how came you off my noble Count. Mount. As you see without any wounds, but much against My will I was but one, Sebastiano, that was the Principall, tooke a demurre upon their allegation: It seemes, and so the matter is rak'd up in the Embers. Ual. To make a greater fire, were you so cold To credit his excuse, Antonio, I should not have beene so frozen, As you love honor and revenge, give me Some interest now, and if I doe not Shew my selfe faithfull, let Valasco have No name within your memory, let me begge, To be your Proxie sir, pitty such blood, As yours should be ignobly cast away; Maddam speake for me. Cat. No, J had rather lose this foole. Mont. And you can get their consents. Cat. You cannot sir in honour now goe backe. J shall not thinke you love me, if my father Point you such noble service to refuse it. Mount. You heare what she sayes. Uil. Count Monte nigro. Ual. I am all fire with rage. Vil. Ualasco, you may accompany the Count, There may be imployment of your valour too; Tell me at your returne, whether my sonne May prove a souldier, heres new warrant for Antonioes death, if there be coldnesse urge it, Tis my desire, ile study a better service. Val. I shall. Vil. Away then both, no complement, I wish you either Had a Pegasus, be happy, my old bloud boyles, this Must my peace secure, such sores as these must Have a desperate cure. Exeunt. Enter Sebast. Castab. Anton. Berinthia. Seb. This honor Madam of your selfe and brother, Make me unhappy, when I remember, what I came for, not to feast thus but to fight. Cast.
