      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. An Inn at Seville. Enter Don Ramirez and Hostess. HOSTESS. This way an't please your honour. You are welcome To Seville, sir. Would'st please to take refreshment? RAMIREZ. All in good time. I would repose a little. HOSTESS. No doubt your honour must be much fatigued. Shall I prepare a posset for your honour, Something that's warm and comfortable? RAMIREZ. Pshaw! Diego! HOSTESS. Whom dost your honour please to want? RAMIREZ. My rascal whom I left in charge o'th' baggage— HOSTESS. Diego! Signor Diego! Enter Diego, with a Cloakbag, &amp;c. RAMIREZ. So, you're come. DIEGO. Aye, I am come, and all the things are safe— But I was forc'd to have my eyes about me. There were some sparks there standing in the yard, That look'd as if their fingers itch'd to have 'em. HOSTESS. What's that you say, signor?—I'd have you know None but the best of quality come here. DIEGO. They may be quality for ought I know; But they look'd plaguily like pickpockets. HOSTESS. Like pickpockets indeed! A pretty story! I, who have liv'd here fifteen years, and more, And held my head up with the best in Seville, Thus to be taunted. DIEGO. Nay, I taunt you not— But if I ever saw a pickpocket— RAMIREZ. Have done. HOSTESS. Nay let him, an he will, go on. I'll bring him up. DIEGO. You'll be brought down yourself. HOSTESS. I be brought down!—By whom, I pray? by you?— I tell thee, saucy knave— RAMIREZ. Ne'er heed him, madam, He is untaught.—But I would be alone. HOSTESS. Your worship speaks like a good gentleman. What would your honour please to have for dinner? There's butcher's meat of all sorts, fish and poultry; Shall I conduct your worship to the larder? RAMIREZ. I'd rather be excus'd: let him go with you. DIEGO. Aye, let me see what store you have on board. Come, dame, I'll follow you:—nay, do not pout, Shew me good fare, and we'll be friends anon. [Exeunt Diego and landlady. RAMIREZ. So! here am I at length arriv'd in Seville, Where, thanks to my kind kinsman, Don Alonzo, I am invited to receive the hand Of the fair Laura, only child and heir Of rich Don Guzman. Let me see—in lands, Of solid rents, some threescore thousand crowns; In ready cash, pistoles some fourscore thousand. Why this, so far as money goes, is well. And yet, I know not—I've but half a heart To undertake this business.—Clara! Clara! Thou hast a claim upon me, which my heart, And honour too, convince me can't be cancell'd. My evil star was surely in ascendance, When, in the moment of a peevish quarrel, Brought on by mine own petulance, I open'd That letter from Alonzo. Riches, honours, Flash'd in my view, and with a magnet's force Seduc'd me hither. Enter Diego. DIEGO. I have got a trifle To stay my stomach—'Tis a noble larder! I've order'd you a delicate young capon, Some nice red trouts, a pretty leg of lamb, An omelette, with a vermicelli soup, A partridge and some other little kickshaws— RAMIREZ. 'Slife, do you mean to feed an army, sirrah? DIEGO. I always like to do the thing genteely, (Aside) —And 'specially when I am not to pay for't. RAMIREZ. Hark you me, sir! Let's have no more of this. Enquire the way to Don Alonzo's house; Tell him I'm here, impatient to embrace him. And hasten to the tailor, whom he order'd To make for me a suit, in the same fashion As those now worn by noblemen at court. Then find where lives Don Guzman de Pacheco; Make my respectful compliments to him And his fair daughter— DIEGO. She you come to wed? RAMIREZ. Ay, sir, the same; my golden fleece, such as Jason ne'er saw, my East and Western Indies— My argosie, freighted with gold and jewels— DIEGO. Heav'n help me, I shall ne'er remember half— Let's see—to compliment your honour's tailor— To tell the rich young lady you're impatient T'embrace her— RAMIREZ. Silence, sir, no jesting now— See you perform my orders punctually. DIEGO. Then you're resolv'd to marry this same lady? RAMIREZ. Else wherefore came I from Toledo hither? DIEGO. An I might do it without risk, I'd ask Your honour one plain question. RAMIREZ. Ask it freely. DIEGO. There's something tempting, I must own, i' th' thought Of gaining at a hit a vast estate, With no incumbrance on it but a wife, And she too, as 'tis said, handsome and young— I must confess 'tis tempting. RAMIREZ. Well, wise sir, Say on. DIEGO. I'm coming to the point—Now, mark me. There is a certain lady lives at Elvas— One Donna Clara—do you know her, sir? RAMIREZ. Aye, marry, sir—better than she knows me. DIEGO. That may well be; for, as I think, you chose, Without a godfather, to call yourself Don Juan Velasco, you may now conceive That you, as Don Ramirez, are not bound To stand to what Don Juan strictly promis'd. RAMIREZ. Perhaps I may not. DIEGO. Nay, sir, as you please, I'm not your confessor; yet, if I err not, There was a time, and that not long ago, When you profess'd yourself her humble servant, Seem'd never happy but when you was with her, And, if I don't mistake, your marriage day Was fix'd; when, on a sudden, why or wherefore I know not, you decamp'd. RAMIREZ. Have you ought else? DIEGO. Nay, that's enough. RAMIREZ. Then thus I answer you. When I declar'd my love to Donna Clara, I was sincere, heav'n knows my heart, I was!— But wherefore do I talk of this to you? I thought I had a cause—but what of that? 'Tis past—I would forget it if I could. DIEGO. And so poor Donna Clara's left to sigh. RAMIREZ. Name her no more! DIEGO. I wo'n't— I'll hold my tongue, and set my teeth in motion. Enter Hostess. HOSTESS. An't please your honour, dinner is serv'd up. RAMIREZ. I'll wait upon you madam. [Exit Hostess. Hark, Diego, Do what I order'd you. Make no mistakes. [Exit. DIEGO. Plague on this state of servitude, I say! I've appetites and feelings like my master; Can be fatigued too after a hot journey, And can enjoy the luxury of dinner, With a cool glass of sparkling Malvoisie, To lead me gently on to my siesta. But I'm forsooth his lackey, a poor drudge, Hungry and tir'd to run upon his errands, While he indulges in his easy chair, And takes his pleasure. Fortune! thou'rt a jade To leave me thus, when, had it been thy will, I could have made so fine a gentleman. [Exit. SCENE II. The Garden of Donna Clara's House. Enter Donna Clara and Beatrice. BEATRICE. Well, after all, ma'am, were I fit to advise you, I'd counsel you to give up this Ramirez, And vex and plague yourself no more about him. To palm himself upon you for Don Juan, To sigh and swear eternal constancy, 'Till he had drawn you to consent to marriage, And then, beshrew him for't, to run away, Forsooth, to marry one, who, I'll be sworn, No more deserves to be compar'd to you— CLARA. Could I take counsel only of my judgment, I certainly should follow your advice: But, ah! my Beatrice, I confess with shame This truant has an interest in my heart— BEATRICE. What, madam, after all his perjuries, After the letter, which, when he was flown, I chanc'd to meet with from one Don Alonzo, Another rakehell like himself I warrant, Stiling him Don Ramirez, and announcing That all was ready for his instant marriage With rich Don Guzman's daughter of this town— CLARA. Had it not been for that my heart had burst; But now my pride is listed in the cause, And every passion, which can urge a woman To vindicate her love, her fame, impels me To break the trammels which have drawn him hither, And bring the traitor back to his allegiance. BEATRICE. Since things are so, I have no more to say. But surely 'tis a singular disguise You mean t'adopt—To quit your rank and station, And to propose yourself as the duenna Of this Don Guzman's daughter— Enter Bertran. CLARA. Welcome, good Bertran! Well, what have you done? BERTRAN. Let me put off this pedagogue's disguise, And then I'll answer you. (Takes off his hat, wig, and cloak.) Now I can speak. Whether 'tis zeal, or merely heat o'th'weather That warms me so, I know not. CLARA. Prithee tell me, Have you succeeded? BERTRAN. If it be success, To strip you for a season of your rank, And veil your peerless beauties in a cloud, I have succeeded fully. You are now I'th' highway to preferment. CLARA. Thanks, good Bertran! Ten thousand thanks! BERTRAN. Nay, it is something, look you, To rise at once to be the only daughter Of Sancho Perez, schoolmaster at Olmez, (That's I, I pray you mark) who've lately lost Your husband, Vincent Nunez, a rich farmer— BEATRICE. Have you assign'd no part to me? BERTRAN. Oh, yes! You are my wife—my second wife observe you,— Who, for some family reasons, not inclining To keep a widow'd step-daughter at home, Have counsell'd me to seek for her some station, Where she may be protected from the arts Of wicked men. CLARA. And this account pass'd current? BERTRAN. Like a new ducat. You have nought to do, But prank you in your grave habiliments, And hasten with me to Don Guzman's house, Who waits with more impatience to receive you, Than sun-burnt fallows do a summer show'r. CLARA. Come, girl, let's lose no time: I'm all impatience To enter on my functions. Do you think You can discharge your part? BEATRICE. Never fear me, I've not been chambermaid so long for nothing. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A public Place in Seville. Enter Don Carlos. CARLOS. Would I could learn if the report be true That Laura's hand is promis'd to another!— Who's this Ramirez?—What are his pretensions? Can her affection then be fix'd on him? If so, I'll shew myself deserving of her, And sacrifice to her my fondest wishes. Enter Pedrillo. PEDRILLO. I'm glad I've found you—there's such news abroad— I've brought you such intelligence. He's come— CARLOS. Who?— PEDRILLO. Don Ramirez. CARLOS. What already? PEDRILLO. Aye— Within this hour he landed from his mule At the Green Dragon, where he now is hous'd. Birlady! he's a sightly cavalier, A young, well-timber'd blade, to all appearance Not overstock'd with diffidence, and likely To make advances in a lady's favour. CARLOS. What can be done, Pedrillo? PEDRILLO. Truly, matters Do look a little crooked. Yet, I know not— I have some hopes.—As yet, I've form'd no plan; But, if I can depend upon my skill In physiognomy, a certain Diego, Who waits on Don Ramirez as his lackey, Is made of clay, which my fine wits may mould Into a shape subservient to our purpose. I watch'd him closely even now i'th' inn yard, As he stood centry o'er his master's cloak-bag, And took full measure of him.—As I live, He comes this way.—Now judge of him yourself. Enter Diego. DIEGO. I know not how it is—but there is something In a strange place that makes one lose one's way. The people at the inn appear'd to give me A plain direction—but I cannot find it. If I could see some civil gentleman, Of whom I could enquire the road—Odso! There's two together, decent looking persons— Pray, gentlemen, may I make bold to ask— PEDRILLO (turning to him). You may.—Who are you?—What d'ye want with me? DIEGO. I would enquire—But hold!—Aye, you are he— PEDRILLO. Am he!—Am who? DIEGO. Why one of those same quality, Who look'd so sharply at my master's cloak bag, As if you long'd to be familiar with it. I know you well enough. PEDRILLO. Why, friend, you're mad. I'm an apothecary. DIEGO. That's a good one! PEDRILLO. Who keep a shop in St. Jago Street; Where, if you want galenicals or drugs, Cupping, blood-letting, or tooth-drawing, sir, I shall be honor'd by your worship's favors. DIEGO. And so you're an apothecary? PEDRILLO. Yes— And what of that?— DIEGO. Mayhap then you've a brother, Or it may be a cousin who is like you. PEDRILLO. I have no brother—nor no cousin either, Nor uncle, aunt, nor sister, father or mother. DIEGO. That's strange! PEDRILLO. Not strange at all. It is a way That we have in our family. DIEGO. Well, sir, Since it is so, I would make free to ask Where I may find Don Guzman de Pacheco? PEDRILLO. What is't you want with him? DIEGO. Faith, I want nought; But I've a little message to deliver. PEDRILLO. Then, friend, you'll lose your labour. DIEGO. Eh?—Why so?— PEDRILLO. Hast thou not heard he is about to marry His daughter to a brave young gentleman, One Don Ramirez? DIEGO. I have heard it said. PEDRILLO. Then know, his time and thoughts are so engag'd, He will hear nought but what relates to him. DIEGO. Then he'll hear me, for I am charg'd to bear That Don Ramirez' compliments. PEDRILLO. Oh, ho!— You are his valet then?—(Bowing)—I humbly pray You'll recommend me to his honor's custom. My name is Pedro Lobo. DIEGO. Pedro Lobo?— PEDRILLO. Aye, Pedro Lobo. You shall find me, sir, Most thankful—I will shave you, sir, for nothing. DIEGO. That's kind—I'll do't— PEDRILLO. Well, I am glad we've met. I like your looks—you seem a pleasant fellow— DIEGO. Oh! yes—I'm very pleasant.—I like you too. PEDRILLO. That's well—And so you're going to Don Guzman's? Have you no other message? DIEGO. Yes, I've one. Only to say my master will wait on him, As soon as his new suit comes home. PEDRILLO. His suit? Who is his tailor? DIEGO. Gil Baptista. PEDRILLO. Oh! I know him—lives not far from Puerta Nova. DIEGO. The same. I'll thank you, sir, if you'll direct me To him and to Don Guzman's. PEDRILLO. Look you, friend, I'll put you in the way. Don Guzman's house And Gil Baptista's are not far apart.— And does your master mean to go alone To pay his visit at Don Guzman's? DIEGO. No— One Don Alonzo, who made up the marriage, Has settled to go with him. PEDRILLO (aside). That's unlucky.— Who is your master's banker here in Seville? DIEGO. Faith, I know not.—But prythee, civil sir, Be pleas'd to point me out the way to go. PEDRILLO. Well, honest friend, you must go down yon street— Not quite to the bottom, but, at the third turning, Go to the right— DIEGO. The right? PEDRILLO. Aye, to the right. Then take the second turning to the left, And you will find yourself in the great square. Then cross it, and you'll see two streets before you— DIEGO. But which am I to take? PEDRILLO. That to the right. Then turn to the left hand, which will bring you close To Gil Baptista's. DIEGO. 'Tis a plaguy distance, And somewhat difficult I fear to find. PEDRILLO. Not in the least.—You'll come and see me, won't you? We'll drink a glass together— DIEGO. That I will. PEDRILLO. And recommend me to your master's custom? DIEGO. Basta!—'tis done. Good day to you, kind sir. A mighty civil worthy gentleman! [Exit. PEDRILLO. I'll keep my word!—I'll follow you up close, And shave you close too ere I've done with you. CARLOS. And so, sir, you are an apothecary. PEDRILLO. I'm any thing your service may require. CARLOS. What is your project now? PEDRILLO. I've sent that novice A wild-goose chace, which, I'll engage for't, will Employ him for some time: meanwhile, my lord, Go home and write a letter to your love. My bus'ness leads me to this young spark's tailor. He's an old friend of mine, who will perhaps Indulge me with the loan of this same habit Made for his introduction. If I get it, Trust to my skill for keeping him at home. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Don Ramirez's Apartment at the Inn. Enter Hostess and Don Alonzo. HOSTESS. An't please you, this is Don Ramirez's chamber. I pray your honour, take a chair; his worship, Heav'n bless him! is enjoying his siesta. ALONZO. Tell him, I pray you, ma'am, that Don Alonzo Is here to wait on him. HOSTESS. Well, I'll be sworn You're two as pretty gentlemen to look on— ALONZO. Will you be pleas'd to let him know I'm here? HOSTESS. I will your honour—well, it does one good To look upon you both! [Exit. ALONZO. Make haste, I pray. I long to know what has detain'd him thus, When I had taken pains to make this match So plainly advantageous. There is danger In trifling, when a woman is concern'd. Enter Ramirez. RAMIREZ. Alonzo, this is kind indeed! Most welcome! ALONZO. Welcome, my dear Ramirez! I have waited With more impatience to receive you, than You shew'd in coming. What! A bridegroom you! When beauty, youth and fortune, challeng'd you, To linger thus! RAMIREZ. Why truly I'm to blame— And yet I know not—Prithee ask no questions— I'm here you see. ALONZO. Why, you are grown mysterious. Is this the ardour which becomes a lover, Invited, as it were, t'accept the hand Of Seville's paragon, whose op'ning charms Might thaw a hermit's frozen heart to love, Whose rank is equal to your own, whose wealth Will reinstate the fortunes of your house? RAMIREZ. Why as you say—'tis true—I own it all— ALONZO. Whence all this myst'ry then, this icy coldness? RAMIREZ. Cold?—No, not I—I made what haste I could! But I was absent when your letter came, And so it was delay'd—And so you thought me Cold and mysterious! (laughs)—A good joke that, When a fine girl's in question! Faith, Alonzo, 'Twas really kind of you to think of me. I warrant me that most men would have wish'd To keep so rich a treasure to themselves. But you—In truth you acted handsomely ALONZO. For me, you know, I'm clearly out o'th'question: My faith's already plighted to another. She's neither quite so fair, nor quite so rich, As she whose hand awaits you; but, you know When once a man has gain'd a woman's heart, And giv'n his word to marry her, common honour Requires him to fulfil it. RAMIREZ. Certainly— ALONZO. For, were he to draw back from his engagement, No gentleman would speak to him. RAMIREZ. Umph!—No— ALONZO. He would be scouted from society, As one who'd neither faith nor honour in him. Don't you think so? RAMIREZ. Oh, certainly! ALONZO. A fellow, Who's capable of that, would pick one's pocket. Would not he, think you? RAMIREZ. Umph!—Undoubtedly— ALONZO. But an't you anxious to behold your Laura? Trust me she's worth your knowing. RAMIREZ. I'm on fire To see her— Enter Pedrillo, with a Bundle. PEDRILLO. Gentlemen, your humble servant!—(bowing.) ALONZO. What is't you want, sir? PEDRILLO. With your honour's favour, I am commission'd, sir, to Don Ramirez. RAMIREZ. I'm he. PEDRILLO (bowing). I am your honour's most obsequious, Most humble— RAMIREZ. When you've done, sir, with these cringes, Perhaps you'll speak your purpose. PEDRILLO. I've the honour To be the representative of Gil Baptista, Who, at cuff, cape, skirt, sleeve, or pocket, reigns Without a rival here in Seville. RAMIREZ. So— You are a tailor's journeyman? PEDRILLO. I am, sir. RAMIREZ. Hast brought my suit? PEDRILLO. I have it in this fardel. (Opens his bundle). There! I'll ne'er cut an inch of satin more, Or with my goose smooth down a button-hole, If there's in Seville so complete a suit. Wilt please your honour just to try it on? RAMIREZ. Aye, come, let's see your workmanship—Odso! You set unhandily about it, friend. PEDRILLO. Now, if your honour pleases, try it on. If it should fit you, why—(aside)—my pains are lost. RAMIREZ. Gently—Why, what's the matter with this sleeve? I cannot get my arm through! PEDRILLO (aside). If you can, I've thrown away my trouble.—(To Ramirez)—Push away, sir! You'll get it through at last—The saints defend me, If you ha'n't pulled away the sleeve! RAMIREZ. The deuce! What can we do? PEDRILLO. 'Tis of no consequence; I'll take it home again, an't please your honour, And stitch it in a trice—'Tis a mere trifle. ALONZO. But we are losing time, sir— PEDRILLO (aside). That's exactly What I propose you should do— ALONZO. We're expected This moment at Don Guzman's— PEDRILLO. I'll be back Within this half hour—I'm your worship's servant— (Going.) Enter Diego. Your worship may be sure—Zooks! he arrived! DIEGO. What Pedro Lobo?—What has brought thee here? PEDRILLO. I'm in a monstrous hurry—pray don't stop me— I have been paying my respects— DIEGO. That's right. Has't ask'd for's custom? Has he promis'd thee? PEDRILLO. He has—Good afternoon— DIEGO. Stay—stay a minute. I'll say a word or two to clinch the matter. PEDRILLO. Not now— RAMIREZ. Remember expedition, sir. PEDRILLO. Your honour may be sure of it directly.—(Going). DIEGO. Nay—you shall stay and take a glass with me. Here—waiter!— PEDRILLO. No—not now.—I must begone!— [Exeunt Pedrillo and Diego, squabbling. RAMIREZ. What a provoking circumstance! ALONZO. Ne'er mind— We shall be time enough, so pray be patient— RAMIREZ. Were you but interested, sir, as I am, You'd hardly thank a friend for preaching patience. But come—while he's repairing my new suit, Go with me to my chamber. I must give A few last tasteful touches to my hair, To make myself quite irresistible. Nay, you may laugh—but 'tis a serious matter— The first impression, sir, is ev'ry thing. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. An Apartment at Don Guzman's. Enter Don Guzman. GUZMAN. Fie on the tediousness of all these knaves! We shall have Don Ramirez here, before They've made half preparation. Gaspar! Gomez! Where are ye all? Enter Balthazar and other Servants. BALTHAZAR. An't please your lordship's honour, Here is one Sancho Perez at the gate, Who bad me tell your lordship he has brought His daughter, widow of one Vincent Nunez, To wait upon your lordship. GUZMAN. Shew them up. [Exit Balthazar. Hark you, take care, and mind that all is ready. We must do honour to our son-in-law. We'll shew him something, when he comes to Seville. [Exeunt Servants. Enter Donna Clara as a Duenna, Bertran and Beatrice, as her Father and Mother. GUZMAN. Welcome, my honest friend. Whom have we here? BERTRAN. By your permission, good my lord, I come With my old dame here— BEATRICE. Aye, my lord, we're come To wait on your good lordship.—We're poor people, Though not so poor but we can keep our station— Though to be sure, we cannot be expected To entertain a troop— BERTRAN. Will you give o'er? Come forward, daughter. GUZMAN. Od's my life! her looks Would give her credit for a better station, Than that she sues for. BEATRICE. There my lord's the point— Says I to Sancho, she's too young and handsome, The world's a wicked world, the men are naught, Our house will be no better than a fair, With all their comings in and goings out— Says I, a nunn'ry is the fittest place! But, would your lordship think it? At the word, My madam flounc'd and frump'd, and plainly told us She'd look for a condition. GUZMAN. She said well. (To Clara) So, you'd be a duenna?—Eh! is't so? CLARA. If you, my lord, should not object to try me, I'll strive by zeal and diligence to merit Your lordship's favour. GUZMAN. And, egad! you'll have it. You know the duties of your place, I warrant? CLARA. I would not my professions should outrun My future service; but, unless the voice Of common fame hath magnified her virtues, Your daughter wants but little of my aid. GUZMAN. She's a good girl in truth: you'll find her so, And so will Don Ramirez.—Now for terms. What is't you ask? CLARA. I have some little means, Which place me 'bove dependence. To be honour'd By your approval and my lady's favour Will more than pay my feeble services. I pray you, good my lord, speak not of terms. GUZMAN. Well, well, I won't. I'll take good care of you. Come, you shall see my daughter. Who is't waits? Enter Balthazar. Tell Donna Laura I would see her here. [Exit Balthazar. We're in a monstrous bustle just at present, For Don Ramirez is expected hourly, The writings all are drawn, and the espousals Will instantly take place.—Well, Master Sancho, I am obliged to you. You may command me. If there be any thing which you require, Make free with me. BERTRAN. I thank your noble lordship. I want for nothing—a good glass of sherris Sometimes to glad my heart— BEATRICE. For shame, what mean you? Are these your manners, in his lordship's presence To talk of filthy sherris? GUZMAN. Nay, good dame,— (to Beatrice.) A glass of sherris does no harm. Enter Donna Laura. My Laura! Come, dear!—You know we wanted a duenna, T'attend you when you're married. Here she is. LAURA. This a duenna, sir? GUZMAN. Aye, girl—why not? LAURA. She's so unlike old Catherina, sir, Who look'd so cross, and us'd to plague me so— CLARA. I hope I shall not plague you. LAURA. No, I think not— You smile, and look as if you were good humour'd; You're young too—and I'm sure you're very handsome. Dear! I should like such a duenna vastly. GUZMAN. Should you?—Then you shall have her if you please. There, talk the matter over—get acquainted. We've so much bus'ness now—Some other time, When we've more leisure, pray ye call again— BERTRAN. Good morrow to your lordship—Come, good dame. [Exeunt Beatrice and Bertran. GUZMAN. So, so—you've got acquainted—You seem merry. LAURA. Dear father! how I am oblig'd to you! I like her vastly. Pray, ma'am, what's your name? CLARA. My name is Nunez, madam. LAURA. Nunez? Nunez? Well, Nunez, let us have no ceremony, But call me Laura, and I'll call you Nunez. GUZMAN. That's right—But get along—we shan't be ready For Don Ramirez. LAURA. Lord papa! I wish You'd not insist upon my marrying him. I dare say he's some cross, ill-looking creature— I cannot bear the thoughts of him— GUZMAN. Why not? Go! you're a simpleton.—Heyday! What's here? (Clara veils herself. Enter Pedrillo and Balthazar. PEDRILLO. I beg, good sir, you'd take no further trouble: I can announce myself.—Is that your master? BALTHAZAR. Aye—and what then? PEDRILLO. Then, sir, I'm your obedient. I beg, my lord, to pay my humble duty To your good lordship— GUZMAN. What's your name? Who are you? PEDRILLO. My name is Lazarillo, good my lord; And as to who I am, I am the valet Of a Toledan signor—Don Ramirez. GUZMAN. Of Don Ramirez?—You are very welcome. Well—what of Don Ramirez? PEDRILLO (to Balthazar). You perceive I can announce myself. You may retire. [Exit Balthazar. Please you, my lord, I'm charg'd by Don Ramirez To present compliments, and to deliver Into you lordship's hands a letter from him. GUZMAN. Where is it? Let me see it!—Stay awhile— (Puts on his spectacles. (Reads) —Aye, aye—“To the most excellent Don Guzman.” Now let me see what Don Ramirez says. PEDRILLO. I crave your lordship's pardon—here's another— GUZMAN. From Don Ramirez too? PEDRILLO. Aye, my good lord. GUZMAN. Wasn't one big enough to hold his meaning? PEDRILLO. Your lordship misconceives me. This is one, In which my master ventures to present His homage to the lovely Donna Laura. (Offers it to Laura. GUZMAN. Hey?—Let me look at it— PEDRILLO (holding it). You see, my lord, The superscription is, for Donna Laura. (Offers it to her. GUZMAN. I wish to see a little what he says. (Snatches it from him. PEDRILLO (aside). 'Sdeath, if he open it our game is up!— An't please your lordship, I forgot to mention, My master charg'd me to deliver it Into the lady's hands. “Look you,” said he, “Acquaint Don Guzman, that I have presum'd “To pave the way for my admission to her, “By a few lines of merely compliments, “Which may just serve to break the ice between us.”— GUZMAN. Did Don Ramirez say so? PEDRILLO. Yes, my lord— “Perhaps,” said he, “you may persuade my lord “To give it her himself; it will look better,” Said he, “and seem much more respectful tow'rds him, “Were you to pray him to deliver it: “He'll not,” said he, “suspect that I should send “What is improper for his daughter's view— “I know my duty better than that comes to,” Said he— GUZMAN. Enough!—Well, Laura—here's a letter, Comes from your lover, child—open it—read— Let's hear what he can say. LAURA. Indeed I shan't. GUZMAN. Nay, don't be foolish—read it—I should like To know if your young fellows now adays Make love as we were us'd to do. PEDRILLO. The lady Seems bashful. If you were, my lord, to read Your own, she might take courage. GUZMAN. Like enough— Do as you please, my dearest. (He reads his letter. PEDRILLO (aside to Laura). Read it, madam— 'Tis from Don Carlos—I'm his valet— GUZMAN (Taking off his spectacles). So!— A very modest and well written letter. Enter Diego, opposed by Balthazar. BALTHAZAR. Not quite so fast. DIEGO. I tell you I must see him— I'm Don Ramirez' lackey— PEDRILLO (aside). He again! One of us must decamp—so brass assist me. (To Diego) —What's that you say, sir?—Don Ramirez' lackey? DIEGO. Aye, Don Ramirez—Heyday! Pedro Lobo! What brings you here? PEDRILLO. Lobo? What is't you mean? I'm Don Ramirez' valet. DIEGO. Heav'n defend me! You're an apothecary— GUZMAN. What's all this? PEDRILLO. My lord, I know not—Here is a rude fellow, Who calls himself lackey of Don Ramirez. I know him not. DIEGO. 'Tis false!—He knows me well. PEDRILLO. Do I?—Let's look at you.—Oh! now I know him— My lord, he is the greatest rogue in Seville— (To Diego) —Ay, I remember you; when we arrived, I saw you in the court yard of the inn, With a companion, peeping at our cloakbag. I notic'd you. The people told me then What pretty characters you bore, and bad me Look well to the baggage. DIEGO. You're a lying knave, And I'll come round you— GUZMAN (to Pedrillo). You remember him? PEDRILLO. He's not so easily forgot—An't please you, Ask him, my lord, if he has brought a letter. You'll have him there— GUZMAN. I will.—(To Diego.)—Have you a letter? DIEGO. A letter, hey?—From whom?—Not I, indeed. PEDRILLO. I told you so. Pray question him, my lord, Who is his master's banker here in Seville? GUZMAN (to Diego). Dost hear? DIEGO. His banker? Faith I never heard. PEDRILLO. There, there my lord; you see he's ignorant. GUZMAN. You give a bad account, sir, of yourself. I have a mind to lay you by the heels. DIEGO. Why, what the deuce—send me to jail! PEDRILLO. Aye, sirrah! And treat you with a cat-o'-nine-tails, varlet! I'll firk and ferret you!—I'll teach you how To play your rogue's tricks here— DIEGO. Odso! keep off— Why what's the matter with you, Pedro Lobo? PEDRILLO. I'll Pedro Lobo you! Let me come at him!— DIEGO. I tell you I'm Diego— GUZMAN. Here! Balthazar! PEDRILLO. Leave him to me!—(Catches Diego by the throat). DIEGO. W—w—what d'ye mean to throttle me?— Why, Pedro Lobo— PEDRILLO. Out! you scurvy knave! [Exit Diego. I've done his business for him. GUZMAN. Is he gone? I would have giv'n him to an Alguazil, And made him an example! Paltry knave! To palm himself.—I'll have the rogue brought back. PEDRILLO. I'll find him out—I'll take good care of him— GUZMAN. There'll be an end of justice if he 'scape. An impudent impostor! (Walks about.) CLARA (to Pedrillo). Hark! a word— In some half hour be sure you come again— Ask for the widow Nunez— PEDRILLO. Hush, enough— GUZMAN. Be sure you overtake him— PEDRILLO. Has your lordship No further orders for your humble servant? GUZMAN. None, but my best respects, and earnest hope We shall soon see your master Don Ramirez. PEDRILLO. Your lordship may be certain of his coming. I pay my humble duty to your lordship. (As if going.) GUZMAN (to Laura and Clara). A clever fellow that! Come, follow me. [Exit with Laura, Clara following. PEDRILLO (to Clara). Hist! CLARA (returning). Don't detain me, pray— PEDRILLO. When I come back, You'll have a little billet—a small word Of comfort for a poor despairing lover— CLARA. I'll do my best to serve you—there—begone— I'm ruin'd if I stay— PEDRILLO. Good luck go with you! You're a kind hearted creature— CLARA. You're a rogue!— [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. Don Ramirez's Apartment. Don Ramirez and Don Alonzo discovered seated. ALONZO. Come, one glass more to the fair Laura's health. RAMIREZ. A bumper to her fourscore thousand crowns! There's magic in the sound!—But where's Diego? Just at this moment, when my fancy teems With images so blissful, thus to linger! ALONZO. Why how can his delay affect you thus? RAMIREZ (rising). How, sir?—My all depends on his return. I sent him to Don Guzman's to announce My arrival here in Seville. 'Till he come, I cannot venture to present myself. ALONZO. Nay, nay, be patient—he's perhaps return'd. I'll step and ask. [Exit. RAMIREZ. That is indeed most kind. Delay is ruin to a heart like mine, Which bitter recollection still must wound. Oh! Clara! Clara! still thine image haunts me, And damps the ardour which should fill my soul. Enter Alonzo. ALONZO. 'Tis as I thought—Diego is return'd, But in a strange condition. I ne'er saw A fellow so bewilder'd. I attempted In vain to learn what had betided him, For, 'stead of making me reply, he stood Gaping and staring on me.—Here he is. Enter Diego. RAMIREZ. Well, sir—what bring you? DIEGO. I have brought myself— Though that's a lie—for, what with fright and running, I'm sure I've melted half myself away. Catch me at that old fellow's house again, And give me what he promis'd me, a whipping RAMIREZ. What means the fool? DIEGO. The fool shew'd good discretion; For, when they threaten'd him with jail and whipping, He shew'd them a good pair of heels. RAMIREZ. Who threaten'd? DIEGO. Why, the old Don himself, and Pedro Lobo. RAMIREZ. Who's he?— DIEGO. You knew him well enough e'en now— Th'apothecary, whom you chose to call A tailor. RAMIREZ. What had he to do? DIEGO. I know not: But they both fac'd me down he was your valet. RAMIREZ. Don Guzman fac'd you down, sir? DIEGO. Aye, Don Guzman— A queer old blade—and as for Pedro Lobo— RAMIREZ. Pshaw! Nonsense! This is one of your old pranks. Hark you me, sir—I'm going to Don Guzman's: Do you repair to th'post office, and ask For any letters which may come for me, And bring them to Don Guzman's instantly. DIEGO. If Pedro Lobo should be there? RAMIREZ. Again? Let's hear no more of this. Begone! I say. Come, friend Alonzo!—Now let us set forward. [Exit with Alonzo. DIEGO. Begone!—'Fore gad I know not where to go. At ev'ry turn I pounce on Pedro Lobo. Go where I will, still Pedro Lobo's there; In house, in street, in church or in exchange, He haunts me like a sprite! I do believe My sins are doom'd to visit me in Seville, And Pedro Lobo is the devil himself, Who brings the catalogue to drive me mad! [Exit. SCENE III. An Apartment in Don Guzman's House. Enter Donna Laura and Donna Clara. LAURA. How kind you are to pity my distress! I'm very thankful to you. If you knew How much my Carlos merits my affection, You would not wonder at my loving him. CLARA. There's nothing wonderful, that a young heart Like your's should yield itself to first impressions. LAURA. You've known then what it is to love? CLARA. I have: And known what 'twas to meet an ill return. Ah my young lady! love's a fearful thing! LAURA. Dear Nunez, how you frighten me—Sure love Is not so dreadful as you represent him. To me he seems all gentleness and pleasure; So kind his aspect, so benign his look, The heart that can resist his first approaches, Must be a harder one than mine. CLARA. Oh Laura! I thought so once,—but—we have said enough— May your lov'd Carlos never give you cause To change your sentiments!— LAURA. He never can. Oh Nunez! could you see him, hear him speak, You'd own he well deserv'd my constancy. CLARA. You are resolv'd then not to wed Ramirez? LAURA. Most positively. After all, you know, My father can but scold and threaten me; And though sometimes he's whimsical enough, I know the way to manage him. Besides, I'll lay my life upon it, this Ramirez Is some ill-favour'd, awkward, proud hidalgo, With store of gold, who lives in an old castle, Moated all round, hung with torn tap'stry work'd With scripture histories, and trimm'd with velvet That once was crimson—faugh! I'm sick to think on't. CLARA. You give a good description of your lover, But 'tis not a correct one. Don Ramirez Is not what you describe him. LAURA. Have you seen him?— CLARA. Yes—I have seen him— LAURA. Have you?—Is he handsome? CLARA. He's so esteemed. LAURA. As handsome as Don Carlos? CLARA. Whether you'll think him so I cannot tell. LAURA. Is he genteel and noble in his manners? Does he dress well?—For instance—like Don Carlos? CLARA. He's thought the most accomplish'd man in Spain. LAURA. Dear! I should like to see him. You have rais'd My curiosity— CLARA (aside). Ha!—Is it so? I may have gone too far.—(To Laura) Should you, my dear? That's strange, when, as you just now said, Don Carlos Engrosses your affection. LAURA. So he does; And yet, if Don Ramirez be so handsome, And so accomplish'd, where's the harm of wishing Just to look at him?— CLARA. There's no harm, my dear, But there may be some danger. LAURA. How? CLARA. I mean In trusting to appearances. I've heard— Can you keep secrets? LAURA. Oh yes! You may trust me. What is't?— CLARA. My father's house is near Toledo: We often went there, so we knew what pass'd. Now it was known there was a certain lady, By name Lucretia, daughter of a notary, With whom this Don Ramirez was suspected— LAURA. How? CLARA. He was always going to and fro; Though he was forced to be upon his guard, For then my lord, his father, was alive. At length, the old man died: when, all at once, Out came the secret. LAURA. What was it, good Nunez? CLARA. Would you believe it? This Lucretia swore That this same Don Ramirez had seduc'd her Under a promise of espousing her. The notary, poor man! call'd on Ramirez To execute his promise, but in vain; For, when he found the matter was grown serious, He thought it prudent to decamp. LAURA. And what Became of poor Lucretia? CLARA. There she stays, Almost heart broken. Ere I came away, 'Twas rumour'd Don Ramirez was engag'd To marrry a young lady here in Seville. Her name I heard not; but I find 'tis you. LAURA. I marry him! You surely cannot think it— A reprobate like him!—I'd sooner turn A nun at once.—Do, Nunez, stand my friend— I'm sure you're too good-natur'd to refuse me. CLARA. I know not what to say—I would do much T'assist you.—Yes—I think you're right, my dear— LAURA. I knew you'd say so.—What! a man like that! CLARA. A libertine! One too betroth'd already! 'Tis wonderful he can have the assurance To look you in the face.—But never mind— Don't let him guess that you have learnt his secret, But treat him, when he's introduc'd to you, With due civility.—Come, cheer up, ma'am— We'll prove a match for him, I warrant you. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. An Apartment in Don Guzman's House. Enter Don Guzman. GUZMAN. This wedding is a glorious circumstance. I feel that it revives me like a cordial, And makes me think of old times.—Od's my life! Old as I am, methinks I'm young enough To be a principal in these affairs— Enter Balthazar. BALTHAZAR. The gentlemen are come. I saw 'em stop At the great gate. GUZMAN. Go, go, get you away; See you conduct them in with proper state. [Exit Balthazar. Aye, aye, I hear 'em. If report speak true, My future son-in-law's a sightly fellow. I knew his grandfather.—Odso, they're coming— Now for them— Enter Don Ramirez and Don Alonzo, conducted by Servants. Don Alonzo, my good friend! You are most welcome. Is that gentleman— ALONZO. This, my good lord, is Don Ramirez— GUZMAN (to Ramirez). Sir, I'm honour'd by your presence; I rejoice To see you here on this occasion. RAMIREZ. My lord, I'm yours.—(Looking round)—A very noble house! GUZMAN. What did you say? I'm somewhat thick of hearing. ALONZO. My cousin spoke, my lord, about the honour Your lordship does him. GUZMAN. Sir, the honour's mine. (To Ramirez) I was acquainted with your grandfather— He was a worthy gentleman, who kept An excellent good table, and was noted For a receipt he had for stewing carp. Pray have you got a copy of it? RAMIREZ. Sir! GUZMAN. They were most excellent. He often ask'd me To dine with him; but we could never get him To tell us how he dress'd 'em.—Worthy man! He lov'd good eating—but he's gone! he's gone! (Stands musing. RAMIREZ (to Alonzo). Is this the house he has agreed to give us? ALONZO. The same. GUZMAN (musing). He's gone! he lov'd a haunch of ven'son With currant jelly sauce—but he is gone!— (Still musing. RAMIREZ (to Alonzo). Do'st see those hangings? I will have 'em chang'd; They're out of fashion'd things— ALONZO. Hush! he'll o'erhear you. GUZMAN (to Ramirez). I'll warrant me, that you young fellows now Think yourselves far superior to us old ones. Confess now— RAMIREZ. Why, my lord— GUZMAN. Nay, never mind— There's no harm in't— RAMIREZ. As far as taste, my lord— There we perhaps—when things are out of fashion— GUZMAN. Of fashion!—Pray then what may you like better? RAMIREZ. What do I like? A partridge brown, my lord, sprinkled with silver— 'Tis now the only taste. GUZMAN. That must be curious. Is't stew'd or roasted? RAMIREZ. Sir!—(to Alonzo)—What is't he means GUZMAN. Well—give me the receipt—we'll have it tried— It shall be serv'd up at your wedding dinner. Odso! you have not seen my daughter yet— You must be all impatience.—Who waits there? Enter Balthazar. Go and acquaint my daughter, Don Ramirez Is just arrived, and beg her to come here. [Exit Balthazar. (To Ramirez) Give me your hand, signor, I'm glad to see you: You put me so in mind of your grandfather! He was just such another as yourself, Only, he limp'd a little in his gait, And squinted with one eye.—You're vastly like him. RAMIREZ. My lord, I thank you for your compliment. (To Alonzo) A dev'lish queer old fellow this! GUZMAN (to Alonzo). What says he? ALONZO. He says your lordship flatters him. GUZMAN. Not I— The family resemblance is amazing. Here comes my girl. Now tell me what you think. Enter Donna Laura with Donna Clara veiled. Laura, my love!—Here's Don Ramirez, child, Who comes to see you. RAMIREZ (kneeling). Suffer me to pay My homage, madam, where 'tis justly due. Thus let me kneel, and on your hand impress A symbol of the vassalage I owe you. LAURA. I pray you rise, signor.—(To Clara)—He's well enough! CLARA (to Laura). I told you his appearance was engaging. But mum! GUZMAN. Well, signor, how do you like her, hey? RAMIREZ. She is a constellation of perfections! GUZMAN (to Laura). Well—what dost think of him?—Why dost not answer? CLARA. Your lordship flurries her—she's inexperienc'd, And not accustom'd to these introductions. GUZMAN. Poor dear, I know she's bashful. RAMIREZ. Pray, my lord, Who is that other lady, who, like night, Shrouds her perfections in a sable veil? GUZMAN. Good—very good!—You'd have the moon shine, would you? Faith! she's worth looking at!—Come, Mrs. Nunez, Throw off that wrapper.— CLARA. Pardon me, my lord— I know my station, and must wear it thus. GUZMAN. She is my girl's duenna, gentlemen, But devilish handsome, I can promise you. (To Ramirez) —You'd be surpriz'd were you to see her face. (To Clara) —If you won't take it off, just open it, And let us have a peep—there's no harm in't. CLARA. Excuse me, pray; I know my duty better. GUZMAN. There is the lawyer in another room, Putting the last hand to the settlements. We'll go and read them over, if you please. Signor Ramirez! take my daughter's hand. [Exeunt. Manet Clara. CLARA. With what confirm'd assurance he bears up! Alas! Ramirez! is it come to this? Are all the protestations, vows and oaths Of endless truth you utter'd, gone for ever? Is Clara's image blotted from your soul, And all her tenderness, her confidence, Her faith, too rashly plighted, thus forgotten? Enter Diego. DIEGO. So far all's well—I'm terribly alarm'd, And quake from head to foot—I'd give ten ducats I were safe back again.—Where'er I turn, It seems to me I'm meeting Pedro Lobo— Who's that?—Oh! nobody but an old woman. CLARA. What can he want? DIEGO. I've met with no one yet, But Pedro Lobo's ghost, that haunts me still With jails and whipping-posts. Would I could learn Whether he's here—Perhaps th' old woman knows.— Hark you, old lady! CLARA. Do you call me, sir? DIEGO. I wish you'd tell me, if one Pedro Lobo Be here or not? CLARA. One Pedro Lobo, sir? DIEGO. Aye, Pedro Lobo:—He's a royst'ring blade— CLARA (aside). I'll feign to know him—it may drive him hence. Oh, yes, I know him—he comes often here. DIEGO. The deuce he does! CLARA. He may be here just now. There is no answ'ring for him. DIEGO. You don't say so! Pray tell me, is my master, Don Ramirez, Here in your house? CLARA. He is—what want you with him? DIEGO. I've been to th' post office, and—here they are— Have brought him sundry letters from Toledo. I pray thee tell me where he may be found, That I may go ere Pedro Lobo come. CLARA. He's closetted at present with my lord: But if you'll trust 'em to my charge, good friend, I'll carefully deliver 'em. DIEGO. That's kind— You will be certain now to let him have 'em? CLARA. You may depend on me. You'd better go— I'm sure I hear him—Pedro Lobo's coming— DIEGO. Oh lord! oh lord! I'm off!—Good bye, old dame— [Exit. CLARA. These letters from Toledo—Let me think— Cannot I make some use of them?—I have it!— Now Don Ramirez, I'll be even with you: You shall have letters more than you expect. [Sits down and writes. “Your perfidy”—Ay, that's no bad beginning— Hum—“your ingratitude—your plighted faith”— Hum;—“Brother—vengeance—husband”—that's enough— Now to conclude—“your injured wife, Lucretia.”— (Folds up the letter. Where have I put my seal—a bleeding heart? Oh! here it is—(Seals it.)—So,—go there with the rest. (Mixes it with the others. Enter Pedrillo. PEDRILLO. Is the coast clear? CLARA. Aye, you may venture in. PEDRILLO. I come, good madam, as you order'd me, To know your pleasure— CLARA. Signor Lazarillo, You're punctual to your assignation, sir. PEDRILLO. I'm always punctual in a lady's service. (Aside) —My assignation—'tis a phrase of meaning. Have you, good madam, thought of any project T'assist our cause?—'Tis desperate without you— CLARA. I have—my lady has prepar'd a letter For your good master.—Tarry here awhile, I'll fetch it for you, good kind Lazarillo! [Exit. PEDRILLO. Ho!—good—kind—punctual to your assignation! Why how if this duenna be attracted By my good parts—'Twould not be so surprizing— 'Tis not the first time I've done execution— Re-enter Clara. CLARA. Well, Lazarillo—here's an answer for you. I hope you've form'd a good opinion of me. PEDRILLO. You are the queen and empress of duennas! CLARA. Be quiet—hush!—Whom have we here?—Oh! friends— Enter Beatrice and Bertran. Come hither—We have got a new associate. He'll tell you his own story at more leisure. Now we are friends, and part'ners in one cause, I'll use disguise no longer—You shall see me.— (Unveils. PEDRILLO. Oh! my dear madam!—(Aside)—Gad! if I had guess'd The shell held such a kernel— CLARA. Hark ye, Beatrice— Have you prepar'd all things as I directed? BEATRICE. All's ready—not a tittle is forgotten. CLARA. Have you dispatch'd the note to Don Ramirez? BERTRAN. 'Tis lying ready for him at his lodging. CLARA (to Pedrillo). Now, sir, if you're as well dispos'd to break This match as I am— PEDRILLO. Try me—what's your plan? CLARA. I've one now ripe for execution, In which, so please you, you may bear a part. PEDRILLO. If I don't top it, figo on my talents! Trust me for putting tricks on travellers! [Exeunt severally. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. An Apartment in Don Guzman's House. Don Guzman, Don Ramirez, Don Alonzo, Cuchillo, and Donna Laura, discovered at a Table with Writings, &amp;c. GUZMAN. I hope you find it right? RAMIREZ. Quite right, my lord.— Master Cuchillo! pray, good sir, go on. CUCHILLO (reading). “Item, the said Don Guzman doth engage “On the said day of marriage to pay down “To the said Don Ramirez”— RAMIREZ. Gently now— A little slower if you please. CUCHILLO. Ahem!— “The sum of fourscore thousand—hem—pistoles”— RAMIREZ. Aye, fourscore thousand. GUZMAN. That is right, you know. Such was our bargain. RAMIREZ. Fourscore thousand pistoles— Go on, sir. CUCHILLO. “Item, the said Don Ramirez “Doth for himself, his heirs, and his assigns, “Promise and covenant, and by these presents “Doth bind himself, his heirs and his assigns, “That he the said”— Enter Clara. CLARA. I ask your lordship's pardon— GUZMAN. Well, Mrs. Nunez— CLARA. Here are certain letters Addressed to Don Ramirez— RAMIREZ. Burn the letters! Put 'em down there—I'm not at leisure now To look at 'em.—(To Cuchillo) Where did you leave off, sir? CLARA (to Laura). There's one of them, I'm sure, is from a woman. If it should be from poor Lucretia, madam! RAMIREZ (to Clara). Why can't you put 'em down? (To Cuchillo) Pray, sir, go on. LAURA (to Clara). How I should like to know what it contains! CLARA (to Laura). Pretend you're jealous, madam. RAMIREZ (to Cuchillo). Go on, sir. CUCHILLO. They interrupt me so, I've lost my place. RAMIREZ (to Clara). Will you be pleas'd to put those letters down? CLARA. There, sir, they are— (throws them before Laura). LAURA (taking up one). Hey day! What letter's this? This is a woman's hand. RAMIREZ. A woman's hand? LAURA. Aye, sir, and for a seal a bleeding heart. I'm sure it is a woman's. GUZMAN. Let me see— It is a woman's hand beyond dispute— A kind of scrawling up and down.—So, sir! You've female secret correspondents then?— RAMIREZ. Not I, my lord. GUZMAN. I'll lay a hundred ducats It is a woman's hand. There's no mistaking. CUCHILLO. Oh! it's a woman's hand, a very woman's. LAURA (to Clara). Look, Nunez— CLARA. Why—the hand is like a woman's. There is, perhaps, no harm in't, after all. Young gentlemen may be a little wild, And there are women too, fond of intrigue; But I would not infer that this is one. GUZMAN. Egad! there's something though in what you say. ALONZO. You'd better open it, my friend, at once. You can have no objection. RAMIREZ. Not the slightest— You are at liberty to open it; Or, if you please, my lord, you've my free leave To read it here to all this good assembly. GUZMAN. Aye, give it me— (puts on his spectacles and reads) “My dear, though false Ramirez— RAMIREZ. What's that? GUZMAN. Nay, silence.—“Though your perfidy, “Your base ingratitude, and cruel breach “Of your oft' plighted faith”—Heyday! the lady Begins her letter well— RAMIREZ. My lord, I beg— GUZMAN. Nay, sir, we'll give it a fair hearing—stay— Oh aye!—“your plighted faith might warrant me “To let my brother's vengeance take its course, “Yet since you are my husband”—Fire and fury! What is't you mean, sir?—Give me leave to tell you— RAMIREZ. My lord, I'm overwhelm'd with consternation— LAURA. No wonder. You! a married man, to think Of treating me in this outrageous manner! ALONZO. Ramirez! I've a right to know the truth. RAMIREZ. By heav'n! I know no more of it than you. ALONZO. What is her name? RAMIREZ. I know not. GUZMAN. Then I'll tell you— (Puts on his spectacles again.) Here 'tis in black and white, sign'd at full length— (Reads) “Your injur'd wife, Lucretia de Monsalvo!” The evidence is full. CUCHILLO. Aye, luce clarius! RAMIREZ. My lord, I must and will have this explain'd. GUZMAN. It wants no explanation—(to Laura)—Come, my love, Let's leave the gentleman to his reflections. (To Ramirez) I wish you, sir, good day. [Exeunt Guzman and Laura. RAMIREZ. One word, Alonzo! ALONZO. Aye two, sir!—You shall hear from me anon. [Exit. RAMIREZ. Was ever man so us'd!—Master Cuchillo! CUCHILLO. The clearest nonsuit that I ever saw! [Exit. RAMIREZ. Distraction, fire, and fury! I could bite My fingers off for madness! No one hear me! (He sees Clara). Oh! Mrs. Nunez! you're a worthy woman; You've had experience in the world— CLARA. Good lack! I have indeed. RAMIREZ. I knew it, Mrs. Nunez— Now, Mrs. Nunez, if you'll stand my friend, And try to set this matter right— CLARA. Who! I? What is't you think of me, signor, to fancy That I should interfere in such a business, When you've a wife already? RAMIREZ. Heav'n and earth! I tell you I have none. CLARA. Well, that is strange! No previous contract? RAMIREZ. No. CLARA. No promise neither— No plighted vows, no maiden left to weep Your falsehood and inconstancy? RAMIREZ. On mine honour, I know not this Lucretia de Monsalvo. You'll be my friend now? CLARA. Prove yourself deserving, And you'll find me your friend.—Look at me, signor! Lay your right hand upon your heart, and say If that accord with your assurances. If but a spark of honour harbour there, 'Twill beat responsive to your touch, and gift you With pow'r at once to satisfy my doubts. RAMIREZ (confusedly). Why, certainly your observation's just— A man of honour—When you know me better, You'll find how falsely I have been accus'd. CLARA. Well, sir, I willingly would take your word. Dare you appear once more before my lady, And in her presence ratify your truth? RAMIREZ. Madam, you'll find me ready—I would clear My character at once. I'll follow you. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Another Apartment in Don Guzman's House. Enter Don Guzman, Don Alonzo, Cuchillo, and Donna Laura. ALONZO. My lord, there's no one has more cause than I To take offence at Don Ramirez' conduct: And yet I own it puzzles me to guess, Why, were he thus engag'd, he should have press'd me To introduce him as your daughter's suitor. GUZMAN. 'Tis beyond all belief. ALONZO. I almost think There must be some mistake. GUZMAN. Why, as you say, There may be a mistake. ALONZO. And yet that letter— GUZMAN. Aye, there's no getting over that. ALONZO. I know not— His character has always been esteem'd Most excellent. GUZMAN. That's strongly in his favour. ALONZO. Right, my good lord, it is the only test, By which a doubtful matter can be tried. CUCHILLO. You'll give me leave to say, sir, character Can never weigh against plain evidence. GUZMAN. That's true—no more it can. Enter Ramirez and Clara. What! here again? RAMIREZ. I have no reason to avoid you. GUZMAN. No? RAMIREZ. No. I've already said, and say again, I know not that Lucretia de Monsalvo. GUZMAN. How comes her letter then directed to you? RAMIREZ. I know no more than you—or Mrs. Nunez. CLARA. Nay, then, you know but little. RAMIREZ. On mine honour!— CLARA. You still persist in your denial, sir? RAMIREZ. I do, most resolutely. CLARA. Who knows then, If this same letter may not, after all, Prove a mere forgery? GUZMAN. What's that you say? CLARA. There is no doubting Don Ramirez' honour; And he, you hear, denies it. RAMIREZ. Certainly. CLARA. As for the letter, any one might write it, Either to gratify some private pique, Or else from love of mischief, or, what's worse, From a desire to interrupt his nuptials. RAMIREZ. Nothing more likely.—Nay—I pray you hear. Go on, good Mrs. Nunez. CLARA. I've known people, Who took delight in these malicious jokes. This may be some of their performances. RAMIREZ. It's ten to one. CLARA. Now, if you weigh the matter, You have in one scale this disputed letter, In th' other, Don Ramirez' solemn word. ALONZO. In truth, my lord, there's much in what she says. I am afraid we've acted hastily. GUZMAN. D'ye think so?—Nay—it may be so indeed. (To Ramirez) —If we have been mistaken, Don Ramirez! I know not what apology to make. Come, Laura, tell me, are you satisfied? LAURA. I'm only much surpriz'd that Mrs. Nunez— CLARA. Let me but say a word in private, madam— [They talk apart. ALONZO. Ramirez, there's my hand—I ask your pardon, For doubting your good faith. GUZMAN. And here is mine. But you must own the circumstance was strong. CUCHILLO. I've known a man hang'd before now on weaker. RAMIREZ. My lord, and you my worthy friend, and you Master Cuchillo, give me all your hands; I heartily forgive you. On my soul There's something so absurd in the whole story, So monstrously ridiculous—ha! ha! I can't help laughing— GUZMAN. And you look'd so queer, And fum'd and fretted—when I think of it, I can't help laughing too—Eh! Don Alonzo? Master Cuchillo?—'Twas a pleasant joke.— (All laugh.) Enter Balthazar. BALTHAZAR. My lord, there are some persons at the gate, Who ask to see your lordship. GUZMAN (still laughing). Who are they? BALTHAZAR. One calls herself Lucretia de Monsalvo— GUZMAN. The deuce she does! LAURA. Now, what d'ye think, my lord? GUZMAN. I know not what to think—(to Balthazar)—Bid her come up. [Exit Balthazar. Why, Don Ramirez, what's the matter with you? You stand aghast. RAMIREZ. I'm so amazed, my lord— GUZMAN. I do not doubt it in the least.—Odslife! Here they all come—Now we shall find it out. Enter Beatrice as Lucretia, and Bertran as a Notary. Well, madam, what are your commands with us? BEATRICE. I come for justice against Don Ramirez, Who here is come a suitor to your daughter, While all the time he is my wedded husband. RAMIREZ. My lord, this grows a very serious matter. 'Tis a conspiracy to blast my fame. BERTRAN. You'd best not say so—We are honest people, Well look'd on in Toledo, and, 'till you Seduc'd my girl, consorting with the best. Will you pretend to say you know me not, Miguel Monsalvo?—Who have here the bond You gave her, promising to marry her Under the penalty of— GUZMAN. Pray let me see it. Master Cuchillo, look at it. CUCHILLO. Hum! ha! The bond's a good and most sufficient bond. BEATRICE (to Ramirez). Turn, turn those stern forbidding eyes upon me! Let me again embrace you! RAMIREZ. 'Sdeath! keep off! My lord—Alonzo—I appeal to you— ALONZO. Make no appeal to me, sir, I renounce Your friendship! Never speak to me again! RAMIREZ. Are you all mad? My lord, you shall repent this, (To Alonzo) And so shall you, sir!—You are all combin'd With these impostors; but I will have justice— Keep off, thou crocodile!—Away—away— By heav'n! I'll make examples of you all! [Exit. ALONZO. My lord, I'm petrified. I hope your lordship Will not conceive I knew ought of the matter— GUZMAN. Sir, I acquit you fully. But your friend— ALONZO. He is no more a friend of mine, my lord. GUZMAN. To treat my daughter thus!—(To Laura.)—Come, my poor love, (To Alonzo) And you, good sir—and you, Master Cuchillo, Let's talk the matter over.—Mrs. Nunez! Let these poor people here have hearty welcome. I'll speak to them again before they go. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. A Garden. On one Side an Arbour, on the other a Summer-house. Enter Pedrillo, and a female Servant. PEDRILLO. Now, Flora! place yourself behind yon clump. Be ready when I call.—Mind what I told you. [Exit Flora. Well, I'm a lucky dog!—I cannot chuse But laugh at my success—(puts a purse in his pocket) There—lie thou there— Thou'lt soon have a twin-brother, if Don Carlos— Ha!—Who comes here? Enter Ramirez. Oh! sir—I'm glad you're come. If it may please your honour to retire Into yon summer house, the lady Laura Will join you speedily. RAMIREZ. Thanks, my good fellow— I will reward thee amply. PEDRILLO. This way, sir. (They go into the summer-house. Enter Don Carlos. CARLOS. The gate left open, as it were t'invite My free access! I'll in—What! no one here?— Surely no accident has interven'd To keep my Laura. Since I grew a lover, I am become a child; my froward humour Tinges each trifle with misfortune's hue, And makes me start at shadows. I'm asham'd Of mine own weakness. Surely I have proofs Of Laura's love; then why should I despond? Enter Pedrillo. PEDRILLO. You're come in time. CARLOS. Is Donna Laura here? 'Tis past the hour, I think. PEDRILLO. I would exhort Your lordship to be patient; but I know A lover's calculation far outruns The tardy foot of time. CARLOS. To one like me, On whom a dawn of hope begins to break, Each moment seems an hour.—But hark!—Who comes? Perhaps 'tis she—Is it? It is my Laura! Enter Clara richly dressed and veiled—Laura and her maid. LAURA. Yes, I believe so—But I am so frighten'd, I hardly know if I'm myself or not. CARLOS. To what propitious pow'r am I oblig'd For this unlook'd for happiness? LAURA. To none, But this mad-headed, friendly, dear duenna, Who chaparon'd me here to visit you.— But I've a thousand things to say to you— CLARA. You'd better say them then in yonder arbour, For here you'll chance to meet with interruptions. LAURA. Why, you strange creature, would you shut me up In private with a cavalier like him? PEDRILLO. Why make objection, when there's no occasion? Your maid here, Margaretta, will be with you. LAURA. What would Don Guzman say? CLARA. A pretty question! You'd best go home again, my tim'rous dear, And ask his leave. LAURA. You'll make me hate you, Nunez! CARLOS. Let her persuade you—you may safely trust me. CLARA. You hear him.—Well, unless you soon decide, You'll lose your opportunity—D'ye hear? GUZMAN (without). Let my attendants wait! LAURA. Who's that? CLARA. I'll open The gate, and ascertain— LAURA. Oh no!—Stay, stay— Well, if I must, I must—'tis all your doing. (Don Carlos, Laura and Maid go into the arbour. CLARA. So far we've made advance. Hark ye, Pedrillo! Who's at the gate? PEDRILLO. I guess it is Don Guzman. CLARA. Then we've no business here— (Goes into the summer house. PEDRILLO. Here Flora! hasten— Enter Clara's Maid. Follow your lady into the summer house. (Puts her in. My wise Don Guzman! You're before your time— I must get rid of you at all events, And keep you off 'till the young folks are tack'd. (Retires. Don Guzman (without). GUZMAN. Oons! the gate fast? That's not what I expected— Oh ho! 'tis open.—(Enters)—What can all this mean? A billet doux, fixing an assignation With one who signs herself Incognita! I've not of late been us'd to such appointments— Pedrillo advances. PEDRILLO. Oh, my good lord! It's lucky I have found you! GUZMAN. You're Don Ramirez' valet, are you not? PEDRILLO. I was, my lord—but I have turn'd him off. GUZMAN. How's that?—You turn'd him off?—What is't you mean? PEDRILLO. Aye, my good lord. I bore him while I could, But he became too bad for me at last; For I'm an honest lad, my lord, I have A character to keep— GUZMAN. I'll take care of you. I like your looks, you seem an honest fellow— PEDRILLO. You'll find I am so. Stay not here, my lord— The wolf is ready to bear off your lamb. I know it all.—My lord, that Mrs. Nunez— You know she took his part before your lordship. GUZMAN. Well, what of her? PEDRILLO. She has contriv'd it so, That Donna Laura has agreed to marry— GUZMAN. Whom? PEDRILLO. Don Ramirez. GUZMAN. 'Sdeath! it cannot be. PEDRILLO. He told me all the plot of it himself. This very evening, she and Mrs. Nunez Are to steal out, and meet Ramirez here. This is a very noted place. GUZMAN. I'll steal 'em! I'll teach 'em how to carry on their plots! Ho!—Gasper! Gomez!—Thank you, honest friend— Do you stay here to watch—I'll hasten home, And catch 'em ere they're ready. [Exit. PEDRILLO. He's dispos'd of! Beatrice!— [Enter Beatrice and Bertran. BEATRICE. I'm here—Where is Ramirez plac'd? PEDRILLO. He's in yon summer-house. Where is Diego? BEATRICE. He's safe enough. The cook has him in charge. He's hard at work with a cold pigeon pye. PEDRILLO. Now have we got the whole covey in our net, Except the old cock bird— [DON GUZMAN (without)—This way, scoundrels!] And, as I live, He comes—He seems in a most pelting passion. Now, girl, bear up—the storm is at it's height. Enter Don Guzman, Don Alonzo, Cuchillo and Servants, with torches. GUZMAN. Don't talk to me of being calm and cool! I tell you she is gone!—my girl is flown— She's ruin'd—lost!—My family's dishonour'd!— If I can meet the villain who seduc'd her— ALONZO. My lord, I'll follow him through all the world, But he shall give you satisfaction. GUZMAN. Sir, He shall. This old arm can do something yet. (Seeing Pedrillo) —Oh, Lazarillo! What you said is true. PEDRILLO. I knew it was. She must be somewhere here. CUCHILLO. Had we not better search for the young lady? GUZMAN. We had—But where?—(To Beatrice)—Pray who are you, good dame? BEATRICE. Pray who am I, indeed!—Pray who are you? What's here to do?—D'ye know I'm mistress here? GUZMAN. Oh ho! you know it all then, I suppose. BEATRICE. Know what? GUZMAN. My daughter— BEATRICE. I! I scorn your words! I know your daughter! GUZMAN. Yes, you cockatrice! Tell me directly where she is? BEATRICE. Not I! PEDRILLO. That summer—house perhaps— GUZMAN. Here it goes, faith! Now we shall see. (He kicks open the door of the summer-house.) Oh! have I caught you, madam! (He pulls out Clara veiled.) I'll teach you how to run away again! A pretty comrade you've selected too. Come, sir, or I'll compel you to appear. Enter Don Ramirez. RAMIREZ. My lord, I'm ready here to justify What I have done. GUZMAN. I doubt not your assurance. But, sir— RAMIREZ. From you, my lord, I can bear much: But know, my lord, this lady has seen through Your flimsy artifice; she does me justice: She has chosen me, my lord, as her protector; Her faith is plighted to me, mine to her. GUZMAN. She plight her faith to such a one as thou! RAMIREZ. Things more improbable ere now have happen'd. But, let her answer for herself. Speak, madam— Is it not true that we have interchang'd Our mutual faith? CLARA. It is most true indeed! GUZMAN. Why, you young reprobate— RAMIREZ. Obdurate still! (To Clara) Let not his anger daunt you, madam.—Come, Unite with me to move his flinty heart. Cast off that envious veil—break forth at once With all your dazzling charms. CLARA. Thus I obey!— (Unveils.) RAMIREZ. Confusion! Clara! CLARA. Yes, 'tis I, your Clara, To whom your vows of constancy were pledg'd, Who, when her unsuspecting heart confess'd You its sole lord, was cruelly abandon'd, And left to mourn her fond credulity. Nay, turn not thus away—look on me, sir— RAMIREZ. I pray you spare me—I cannot look on you: Your eyes, like basilisks, would pierce my brain, And drive me to distraction!—Think no more Of a lost wretch like me—Let me go hence, And hide myself for ever from your presence! GUZMAN. So, so—here's a discovery! Don Ramirez Contracted to my daughter's poor duenna! Pray, Mrs. Nunez, do explain a little. CLARA. My lord, 'tis time that all disguise should end. Grant me your pardon for a stratagem, Devis'd at once to vindicate myself, And save you and your daughter. GUZMAN. And pray, madam, What is your real character? CLARA. My lord, My family is not unknown to you. You've heard of Don Henriquez de Mendoza? GUZMAN. I knew him well—my brother officer, In the same regiment— CLARA. He was my father. GUZMAN. Your father?—I remember to have heard He had a daughter, and her name was Clara. CLARA. I'm she. GUZMAN. Nay, then you are deserving of him. Eh?—What is your opinion, Don Alonzo? Master Cuchillo, what say you to it? ALONZO. This is a most surprising turn indeed. CUCHILLO. I never knew a clearer alibi! But where is Donna Laura all this time? GUZMAN. Odso! that's true.—(To Beatrice) Where is my daughter, beldam? BEATRICE. You may come out, ma'am—Here she is, my lord. Enter Donna Laura followed by Don Carlos. GUZMAN. Oh, you young baggage!—Hey!—Whom have we here? What right have you, sir!—Who the deuce are you? CARLOS. My lord, your pardon, if I have presum'd To aim at such perfection— GUZMAN. What's your name? CARLOS. Carlos, my lord; the eldest son of him Who bears Medina's dukedom. GUZMAN. I'm your lordship's Most humble servant! but I wish to know How you became acquainted with my daughter. CARLOS. I saw her in the public walk, my lord, And the first glance of her bewitching eye, Made me her willing slave. I trac'd her home, Wrote her fond letters, often pass'd the night Beneath her windows; 'till, at length, my vows Made an impression on her yielding heart. GUZMAN. My lord, no one can disapprove of you. I'm flatter'd by your preference. (To Laura) Well, child, What say you to his lordship? LAURA. Dear papa— To ask that question when you found us here! GUZMAN. Ah! toad!—I understand you. (To Carlos) Well, my lord, She's your's. CARLOS (kneeling to Laura). Thus let me sanction that blest word. GUZMAN. So—bless you both!—How fares it, Don Ramirez? Come, cheer up, man! You've made a small mistake, But you have better luck than you deserve. RAMIREZ. My lord, I own that I've deserv'd but little. I'm overwhelm'd with shame, and know not how To look that much wrong'd lady in the face. If she can pardon me— CLARA. I've given a proof I'm not inexorable—But for pardon, I fear that I must ask for your forgiveness. I've ta'en some freedoms with you, which perhaps You may not readily excuse. RAMIREZ. With me? Whate'er they are, I have deserv'd them all. CLARA. Call my first witness, Mrs. Nunez, here! Won't she appear?—Why then I'll answer for her. “Now, Mrs. Nunez, if you'll stand my friend, “And try—” RAMIREZ. So, so; you then was the duenna? BEATRICE. And, sir, you may remember one Lucretia. I give you back your promise, sir; your children Won't tax you heavily for their support. BERTRAN. When all are at confession, give me leave To lay aside my double character Of schoolmaster, and not'ry of Toledo. PEDRILLO. I've yet a longer catalogue of sins. (To Guzman) —I was your lordship's trusty Lazarillo— (To Ramirez) —Your tailor, sir—and if your man Diego— Enter Diego. DIEGO. What! Pedro Lobo again! PEDRILLO. Aye, Pedro Lobo! DIEGO. I pray you make me room—I cannot stay. PEDRILLO. You need not be alarm'd—we're good friends now. You promis'd me to call and drink a glass. I am not Pedro Lobo now. DIEGO. Art sure on't? GUZMAN. I see you've been too cunning for us all. But that is past. You all shall home with me. 'Twill serve us as a merry jest.—(To Carlos)—My lord, Take your bride's hand.—(To Clara)—For you, my pretty plotter, If you'll give your's to that repentant sinner— RAMIREZ. I hardly dare to sue for't— CLARA. Thus I give it. But, should you feel inclin'd again to stray, I mayn't so easily forgive you. RAMIREZ. No! I am too conscious of my past offences, Ever to hazard your displeasure more. Each moment of my future life shall prove How true I am to Clara, and to love!</field>
