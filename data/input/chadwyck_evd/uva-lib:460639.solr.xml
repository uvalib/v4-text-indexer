      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âThe Garden of the Count de Dorioâiron gates, C. F.âan alcove, L. U. E.âtable and forms, C. Music.âGroups of Peasantry, in holiday attire, discovered decorating the alcove with a device in flowers, bearing the name of âGeorginaââOld Jeromo, with his wand of office, giving orders.âThe decorations being completed, the opening music ceases, and the Peasantry retire to the table to carouse. CONVIVIAL CHORUS. Simple is the purple berry, When upon the stem it grows; Yet its juice doth make men merry, When it in the goblet flows. Then to joy let's tune the lay, This is Bacchus' holiday. Huzza! huzza! huzza! huzza! This is Bacchus' holiday! Jer. Ay, marry is it Bacchus' holiday; And all the Loves and Cupids are invited To grace our entertainment with their presence. The fair Georgina, Count de Dorio's daughter, This night will be espoused, and general joy Take the command of every honest heart. Enter Babbla, C. F. Bab. And yet, though General Joy may take command Of every honest heart, I greatly fear Our joy will not be general after all. Jer. And, pr'ythee, wherefore not, Miss Prateapace? Bab. For this plain reason, sir: because Georgina, My honoured mistress, is compelled to wed Against her inclination. I would give The world, were I but for one single hour Placed in her situation. Jer. Would you really? And, were you so, pray how would you proceed? Bab. I would assert each woman's honest right To choose a husband for herself; and fight, If urged by fate to such extremity, Aye, like a lion for my privilege! Jer. Upon my word, indeed! Bab. Father, I'd say, You have a right to claim obedience In all things else; but where my happiness For life's at stake, I cannotâwill not yield Myself a sacrifice. Jer. No more of this; such silly prate Becomes thee not, thou forward, saucy minx! An' thou repeat thy slander in my presence, I'llâ Bab. [Daring him.] Well, old Graybeard, pray what would you do? Not much, I'm sure. Jer. [Hesitating.] I'dâwish youâbetter manners. [Aside.] I would not marry her, an' I were young, Not for a kingly crown. Talk of a comet, An inundation, fire, or a plague,â What are they? Nothingâto a woman's tongue! [To the Peasantry. Come, neighbours; 'tis our noble lord's command, That you regale yourselves without reserve. So follow me into the servants' hall, Where I've prepared for you a goodly banquet. Come, come! [The Chorus is repeated.âExit Jeromo at the gates, C. F., followed by the Peasantry dancing. Bab. Provoking!âStill no news from Genoa, Whither my lady sent a messenger To learn some tidings of the Count Fernando, The youth of her affections. Sancho, too, His valetâmy intended,ânot one letter Have I received from him for twelve long months. The base, perfidious monster! were he hereâ Enter Sancho at the garden gates, C. F., listening. For causing me, his mistress, such alarms, I'd fall into a most tremendous passion, Andâ San. [Coming forward.] The next moment, fall into his arms! [Embraces her. Bab. What, Sancho! is it you? San. It is, indeed. But don't begin to scold! Bab. Not for the world! Oh! I'm so glad to see you once again! How have you been since last we met?âQuite well? [Speaking rapidly. You've not been wounded in the wars, I hope? [Turning him round and round. What dangers have you 'scaped? what wonders seen? Where have you travelled?âHave you made your fortune? Now for the news! But, first, where is your master? San. If your bewitching tongue should run much faster, Our swiftest Barbary horse would ne'er o'ertake it. In the first place, my master will be here Anon; but as for me, I grieve to say, Miss-fortune, like a trollop, follows me Where'er I go;âand, though I'd gladly wed, And make Dame Fortune of her, she refuses To smile upon me. Still both safe and sound I now return; except, indeed, the wound Those lovely eyes inflicted on this heart, When last we met, and only met to part. Bab. 'Tis well your master's come; but one day later Had cost him his fair mistress; and I doubt If even now he be arrived in time; For long ere this the marriage deed is signed. San. This news will drive my honoured master mad. Who, then, is to espouse the fair Georgina? Bab. The brave and gallant Marquis Sapparino. San. The greatest coward in all Italy! Bab. Be cautious what you say! San. Marry, for what? If such a poltroon dare to step between My master and his love, we'll make him scamper! Bab. No violence, or you'll offend Count Dorio, My lady's father. So, come in with me, And let us plot together in the cause Of darling little Cupid. San. So we will. Bab. Come, Sancho; you and I will do our best. They merit hate, who lovers never pitied; And when a woman sets her wits to workâ San. The devil himself is sure to be outwitted. [Exeunt, R. Enter Count Fernando at the gates, C. F. Fer. Hail! dear, beloved spot! the blissful scene Of all my youthful joys! In yonder bower, How often have I sat with dear Georgina, Reading her lovely eyes, and listening To the love warblings of the nightingale! Alas! that such sweet music should be marred By the harsh clang of rude, discordant war! And yet 'twas for Georgina, lovely maid! I sought at honour's call the field of strife. A bold invader trampled on the rights Of my dear country, and each gallant youth Marched forth to punish his temerity. RECITATIVO and ARIA.âCount Fernando. RECITATIVO. Hail, sacred Freedom! 'tis alone to thee I tune the lay. Oh! thou inspire me; Whether it be beneath the torrid sun, Where the poor negro's toil is never done; Or in the gorgeous palace of the great, Where titled despots sit in guilty state: From his proud throne I'd see each tyrant hurl'd, And give thee, godlike Freedom, to the world! ARIA. If, in his gigantic race, The sun requir'd a resting place, He would choose, and love the best, The spot that is by Freedom bless'd. Into an inglorious grave Sink the low-born, coward slave, Who can cringe and bend the knee, Yet fears to strike for Liberty! And, though tyrants may deride, Still it is my greatest pride To have fought and bled for thee, Heaven-born, godlike Liberty! Aye, for thee, sweet Liberty! Heaven-born, godlike Liberty! Now, then, to seek the idol of my soul, My dear, adored Georgina! [Going.] Re-enter Babbla and Sancho at the gates, C. F. Bab. [Stopping the Count.] Not so fast! Fer. Ah, Babbla! where's thy mistress? Bab. At her toilette. Fer. I recollect: this is her natal day. San. And more than that, signorâ Fer. [Alarmed.] More!âExplain. Bab. That's quickly done. If lovers stay away A twelvemonth from their mistresses, nor send E'en one poor letter to apologise For their long absence, it were no great wonder If woman's patience should be quite worn out. Fer. I could not write, being a prisoner. But, speakâwhat is the drift of this discourse? San. In brief, my lord, 'tis neither more nor less Than this. The fair Georgina, thinking you No longer living, and having no desire To die an ancient virgin, hath resolved To wed that brave and most magnanimous hero, The Marquis Sapparino. Fer. [Impatiently.] 'Sdeath! no more Of this foul slander of Georgina's truth! It cannot be! Bab. It is most true, my lord: Georgina weds, yet not with her consent. Fer. Then will I rescue her, assert my claim, And boldly, in the face of heaven and earth, Chastise the empty-headed fool, who dared To step between my lady's love and me! Sancho! San. My lord. Fer. Get ready my Toledo. San. [Drawing a sword.] 'Tis ready, good my lord: your trusty blade Is bright as woman's eyeâsharp as her tongue, When she maintains wrong's right and right is wrong; And hard as is her heart, when some poor swain, Low at her feet, implores for love in vain. Fer. [Taking the sword.] Silence thy idle prate, and follow me! San. I fly, my lord! Bab. [Impeding them.] Not from this spot one inch. Duels, indeed! Not force, but stratagem Can here avail; therefore be ruled by me. Fer. What! and resign my claim to dear Georgina? Never! San. [To Babbla.] Be ruled by you, and tamely yield To petticoat dominion? Never! never! Bab. [Going.] Then help yourselves the best you can. Adieu! San. Nay, be not angry; 'twas but a jest, love;â Return, and we'll submit, [Aside.] since we can't help it. Bab. Poor creatures! what pretty sorry figures You would cut, left to your own resources! But since you're penitent, rely on me; I will assist you. [Festive music heard without.] Hark! hark! the nuptial Pageant comes.âRetire!âIn yonder alcove You may unobserved mark all that passes. [Exeunt Fernando, Sancho, and Babbla, hastily, into the alcove, L. U. E. Music.âEnter Female Peasants, dancing and strewing flowersâGeorgina, in a canopy borne by Peasants, followed by Count de Dorio, Jeromo, and Domestics, at the gates, C. F. GRAND CHORUS. Tune the layâtune the lay To the fair Georgina's praise; For to us her natal day Is the happiest of days. Ever blithe and ever gay Be Georgina's natal day! Happy day! happy day! Happy, happy, happy day! [Georgina descends from the canopy, and comes forward, C. Geo. [To the Peasantry.] My friends, for your kind love, accept my thanks. The pleasure now that sparkles in your eyes Beguiles me of my grief, and makes me smile, Though I have cause for sorrow. [Exeunt Peasants, C. F. Count. Heaven forbid That sadness should, on this auspicious morn, Obscure the sunshine of thy joy, my child! Geo. Nor shall it, dearest father; for I know You will retract your promise, nor compel me To wed the odious Marquis Sapparino. Count. Not wed the marquis!âWherefore not, Georgina? Geo. Because I cannot love him: the painted coxcomb Ne'er was formed to make a woman happy;â A wanton butterfly, who, in Love's garden, Woos every flower, yet constant proves to none. Count. My word, fair maid, is pledged; the contract signed, And every preparation duly made To celebrate your nuptials with the marquis. Geo. I've often heard you say, you loved my mother, And as a jewel prized her for her truth: I would but imitate her bright example, And still prove faithful to my dear Fernando. Count. A gallant youth, who perished on the field, Fighting his country's battles. Come, my child, Since grief is unavailing, banish sorrow, And let thy lovely smiles again break forth. Geo. [Aside.] Fernando! shall I never see thee more? [Fernando looks out impatiently, and is about to rush from the alcove, but is prevented by Babbla and Sancho. Jer. [Coming from the gates, C. F.] My lord, the noble Marquis Sapparino Now leaves his carriage. Count. Fly, and bid him welcome! Enter the Marquis Sapparino at the gates, C. F. Mar. Bon jour, most worthy count!âGeorgina, too! My lovely bride, I must apologise For this delay; a fatal accident Having detained me long against my will. Count. An accident! Mar. You're often heard, no doubt, of Massaroni, The brigand of the mountains. Geo. I am told He is a generous rover; one who takes, Sans ceremonie, all the gold he can From those who have too much, that he may help With fortune's favours those who have too little. He's said, besides, to be a handsome fellow. Mar. Of that I cannot speak;âhe and his band Were masked when they attacked me. On a sudden, Just at the entrance of the mountain pass, âHalt!â cried the brigand chief: âyour purse, my lord; Surrender, or you die!â But, nothing daunted, I, like a hero, from my carriage sprang, And fought so bravely, that, in twenty minutes, As many robbers on the earth lay stretched Beneath my feetâsome dead, and others dying. Geo. Miraculous, indeed! Of course, my lord, Your courage saved your purse? Mar. No, by no means: I left it in the hands of Massaroni, That the poor devils might employ a surgeon To heal the wounds my valour had inflicted. Geo. When you are dead, his holiness the Pope Will doubtless canonize you, noble sir, For your unbounded generosity. Mar. If I am generous and valiant, Are not the smiles of beauty my reward? With such a bride as my adored Georgina, The paragon of beauty and perfectionâ Geo. No flattery, my lord, I beg of you: It is the current coin 'twixt knaves and fools;â And as, I trust, we do not class with either, Let us in our commerce use no other Than the pure, sterling ore of honesty. Mar. Nought would I do to give offence to thee, Beloved of my soul! [To the Count.] I hope, my lord, All preparations have been duly made To celebrate our nuptials on the morrow. Count. All that a fond and doting father's heart Could dictate, hath been done; nor care nor cost Been spared to grace the joyous festival. Jer. Aye, marry; and all under my directions. The illuminated garden will outshine The lamps above;âthere's fountains spouting wine, And such a dainty store of provender, As never banquet yet was served withal. In brief, my preparations are so ripe, That no delay could make them more mature; And if it please your noble excellencies, The wedding may this night be celebrated. Re-enter Babbla from the alcove, L. U. E. Bab. Not quite so fast, Jeromo, if you please! Count. How now! what means this interruption, girl? Bab. I crave your lordship's pardon. Was not My honoured lady long since contracted To Count Fernando? Geo. [Eagerly.] What of him?âOh, speak! Count. Most truly was she. Mar. But he is no more. Bab. Are you quite sure of that? Mar. Aye, positive; I'll give you proof incontrovertible. Bab. [Apart to Georgina.] Be comforted, my lady: Count Fernando Is just returned, and will be here anon. Geo. Oh, happy tidings! [She becomes cheerful. Mar. [Calling off, L.] What, ho! Ladroni! Enter Ladroni, L. Lad. I am here, my lord. Mar. Behold my valetâhonest, brave Ladroni; A fellow whose veracity is such, That he would rather die by lingering tortures, Than tell a wilful falsehood. Speak, Ladroni: What know you of the gallant Count Fernando? Is he not dead? Lad. [Taking out his handkerchief, and affecting great sorrow.] Dead!âNe'er shall I forget The fatal day, when, in the field of battle, He nobly breathed his last, pierced through and through With fifty wounds, all mortal! Oh, 'twas shocking! Count. Alas, poor youth! Mar. What were his dying words? Lad. With his last breath he cried, âTell dear Georgina 'Tis my request that she do wed the brave, The gallant, noble Marquis Sapparino.â Mar. What more could you require? Lad. Nay, that's not all. The Count Fernando's servant, honest Sancho, My bosom friend, was in the self-same battle Slain by his master's side; and, ere he died, He took my hand, and said, âMy dear Ladroni, You know my mistress Babbla: 'tis my wish That you supply my place, and marry her.â Count Fernando and Sancho suddenly rush from the alcove, L. U. E.âSancho knocks down Ladroni, and Fernando crosses to Georgina. Geo. My dear Fernando! Fer. [Embracing her.] My adored Georgina! San. [To Ladroni.] Not a bad blow, methinks, for a dead man! That's the reward of your veracity, Honest Ladroni! Lad. [Apart to the Marquis.] See what I've got by lying for my master! Count. [To the Marquis.] Sir, this is most disgraceful. Pray explain. Geo. I will explain, dear father. [Pointedly.] When the soul Is void of honour, no means are then too base To gain a wished-for endânot e'en a lie! But since my dear Fernando is returned, No power on earth shall separate us more; For, in the face of heaven and of man, I'll keep the vows that bind me to my love! Count. Impossible! The marriage contract now Is signed and sealedâ Mar. And safe within my power. Fer. [To the Marquis.] Thou paltry, sneaking coward! Let the sword Decide between us; for no forms of law, By fraud obtained, shall shield thee from my arm. Draw, and defend thyself! [The Marquis retreats. San. [To Ladroni, imitating his master.] Ay, draw, thou slave! [Ladroni retreats behind Sapparino. Count. [Interposing.] Put up your swords instantly! I command you! Mar. Ladroni, come; attend me at my toilette. [To Fernando.] Adieu, my fiery lover!âYou're too late. Ha! ha! ha! ha!âI have the contract here! Ladroni, follow me. Adieu! adieu! [Exeunt Sapparino, Ladroni, and Jeromo, at the gates, C. F. Count. Exceedingly do I regret, Fernando, That you arrived not sooner. Geo. My dear father! And can no means be possibly devised To break this hated contract? Count. None, my child. My honour's pledged; besides, the penalty Is heavy if I fail in its fulfilment. Geo. Honour binds only with the honourable: The marquis is a coxcomb and a coward. Count. Give me but proof of that, and I, without Delay, will break the marriage contract. Fer. Did he not even now refuse to fight? Count. I'll have no duelling, which, in my eyes, At best is only honourable murder. I ask some other proof. Suppose, for instance, Our villa were this night to be attacked By Massaroni and his band of brigands,â And such events we know are very common,â Should then the marquis prove himself a coward, And young Fernando here make stout resistance In our defence, that would decide the point; And he, and none but he, should wed my daughter, E'en though the penalty were all my fortune. [Exit, L. Geo. Enough, dear father! [Calling.] Babbla! Bab. [Running forward.] Yes, my lady; Geo. [After whispering to her.] What think you of my plan? Bab. [Clapping her hands.] 'Tis excellent! Geo. And will you join me in it? Bab. Aye, my lady, With heart and hand. Oh! I'm so delighted! Fer. [To Georgina.] What plan is this? San. [To Babbla.] Aye, tell me all about it. Geo. [To Fernando.] Pray have a little patience! So, it seems, Men are as fond of secrets as the women. See, Babbla, with what eagerness they stand On the tiptoe of curiosity! [To Fernando, playfully. You'd like to hear my plan, nowâwouldn't you? Fer. Most certainly, my love. San. And so should I. Geo. [Mysteriously.] Come hither, then, and listen with attention; But, hush! for if you breathe one single syllable Of what I now impartâ Fer. Not for the world! Geo. Then you must know, thatâupon second thoughts, I'd wish you both toâhaveâa little patience! Fer. Provoking! San. How tormenting! Geo. &amp; Bab. [Laughing.] Ha! ha! ha! Geo. [Sarcastically.] You gentlemen are not at all inclined To fish for secretsâoh! not for the world! 'Tis women only who are curious! Now, Babbla, fly, and execute my orders! Bab. I will, my lady, with the speed of lightning. San. [Apart to Babbla.] Come, you'll tell me the secretâwon't you, Babbla? Bab. Oh, certainly; butâhave a little patience! [Exeunt Babbla and Sancho at the gates, C. F. Geo. Fernando, be not angry. Fer. With Georgina? How were that possible? And yet this secretâ Geo. Must still remain one, till it is betrayed By tell-tale Time, who blabs out everything. Yet trust me, love, whate'er I've planned, my object Is to promote our mutual happiness. Fer. [Kneeling.] That dear assurance blunts the eager spur Of curiosity, and teaches patience During your sov'reign pleasure. Geo. [Archly.] How submissive! That's as it should be! Men ne'er look so silly As when they would be wise; affecting power, Calling themselves the Lords of the Creation, And boasting of their high prerogatives! [Winningly giving him her hand. Forgive me, dear Fernando!âWhen my tongue Doth wanton most, my heart is most sincere. Fer. To teaze and banter is Love's greatest pleasure. Geo. And gives rare sport; that is, in modest measure. I little thought this morning, when bright PhÅbus Gave me a glowing kiss, and chid me sluggard, That his departing rays, when in the west He gently sinks into his golden slumbers, Would leave me happy as the nightingales That carol him to rest! Yet, Heaven be praised! The magic power of loveâthy love, Fernando, Hath caused rich joy to banquet in my heart. [Hanging affectionately on his shoulder. Full well I knew, if heaven contained thee not, Thou wouldst again return to thy Georgina, And be her heaven below! [They embrace.] Thus, reunited, For all my griefs I richly am requited! DUET.âGeorgina and Count Fernando. Geo. Love is the magnet of the soul, Which, wheresoe'er we roam, Fails not the passions to control, And draw the wand'rer home. Fer. Love guides the tender turtle dove O'er ocean, hill, and plain; Swift as the lightning from above, To seek his mate again. Geo. Loveâlove alone gave Nature birth; Love blooms in ev'ry flower; Love smiles in sunshine on the earth, And weeps in ev'ry shower. Both. For love's the magnet of the soul, Which, wheresoe'er we roam, Fails not the passions to control, And draw the wand'rer home. [Exeunt, C. F. SCENE II. âA Landscape. Enter Rosa, with a basket on her arm, L. Rosa. How fortunate!âCount Dorio's fÃªte to-day Proved a good market for us flower-girls. My basket's empty, and my purse is full. How my poor mother will rejoice to hear Of my success!âAnd now that I have money, I'll buy a flask of wine to comfort her; For poverty is grievous in old age. There is to be a masquerade to-night; So I'll run home, and get a fresh supply [Going, R. Of flowers for the motley company. And while I sell them, I shall see the sports, Uniting business with recreation. Now, then, away to my dear, happy home! Enter Ladroni, hastily, with a letter, R., meeting her. Lad. A word with you, my pretty little Flora. Rosa. You are mistaken, sir; my name's not Flora. Lad. It matters not, my love. Say, are not you The pretty maid, who at Count Dorio's villa Sold flowers to the guests? Rosa. One of the maids I am; but whether pretty, sir, or not, Becomes not me to say. Lad. What modesty! I swear to thee by my veracity, Thou art by far the fairest specimen Of rustic beauty, Nature ever formed. Pr'ythee, sweet sylvan nymph, what is thy name? SONG.âRosa. Air, âHow sweet are the flowers,â &amp;c., from Tekeli. They call me young Rosa, the queen of the village, And many a lover and sweetheart have I 'Mongst the lads, who forget the hard labour of tillage, If Rosa but gives them a smile for their sigh. Then to market I speed, where the gentlemen gaze, And, with a kind smile, chuck me under the chin; While nodding and winking, my flowers they praise, And cry, âHere's my lodging, sweet Rosaâwalk in!â But I answer No; and when all my flowers Are sold, I then bid the fine gentry adieu; And hie to my cottage, where, happy, my hours I pass with content, though our comforts are few. To father, and mother, and brother, I then Relate my adventures, and give all my gains; No queen half so happy, if Rosa again But meets in their smiles the reward of her pains. Lad. Since Rosa is thy name, most charming rosebud, Peruse this letter from my noble master, The Marquis Sapparino. Rosa. [Taking the letter.] What! the bridegroom Of the Count Dorio's daughter, fair Georgina? Lad. The very same. Rosa. [Opening the letter.] What can he want with me? [Reading.] âSweet violet, blooming in obscurityââ A singular beginning for a letter! [Reads. âThe nosegay which I bought of thee this morning Contained some beauteous flowers, but none so sweet As thy dear self. I therefore long to wear thee, Most charming of all rosebuds, in my bosom. Come to the masquerade this evening, Where we may have a tender interview, Unknown and unobserved. My valet waits Thy verbal answerâmerely yes or no. If yes, the gods might wish my bliss to share; If no, my doom is madness and despair! âMarquis Sapperino.â A most delightful letter, I declare! Lad. What is your answer, pretty Rosa? Rosa. Yes! Lad. Enough; and as an earnest of his bliss, My master ordered me to bring a kiss From thy dear lips, or pluck a blooming rose From off those lovely cheeks. [Offers to kiss her. Rosa. [Boxing his ear.] Then take it, coxcomb! Lad. Oh, Jupiter! my cheek is all on fire! Rosa. It is the rose your master ordered you To bring him. [Laughing.] Ha! ha! ha! Lad. [Aside.] The little vixen! [Aloud.] But you'll be sure to come? Rosa. I answer, yes. Lad. [Aside, rubbing his cheek.] To give a man of my veracity Such striking proofs of her impertinence, Is horrible! But I will have revenge! [Exit, L. Rosa. A pretty fellow, truly, is this marquis! Just on the eve of marriage, too, to think Of laying snares for a poor flower-girl, Whose only fortune is her honesty! But I'll expose the villain, when he dreams Himself the most secure! This assignation I'll punctually keep. A pretty rosebud He calls me, and would wear me in his bosom! The knave! but he shall rue his treachery: As true as I a rustic maid was born, I'll make him feel the rosebud hath its thorn! [Exit, R. SCENE III. âAn elegant Chamber in the Villa of Count Dorioâdoors R. and L. Enter Count Fernando, R. Fer. [Calling.] What ho! where art thou, Sancho?! Enter Sancho, L. San. Here, my lord. Fer. The brigand Massaroni hath been seen Watching the guests now flocking to the villa, To share Count Dorio's hospitality. 'Tis not unlikely but the lawless bandit May venture an attack, in hopes of plunder. San. We'll give him, if he dare, a warm reception! Fer. See that Count Dorio's vassals be assembled, And well instructed in the use of arms. San. I shall obey, my lord. Fer. What would I give To see the brigands, like a mountain torrent, Rush down upon the villa! It would then Be seen who is a coward, and who is not. San. If it so please your lordship, speak the word, And I will fly like lightning to the mountains, And, in your name, give Signor Massaroni An invitation to the masquerade. Fer. Peace, blockhead! If he came by accident, It would rejoice me; but if at my bidding, Were I not an accomplice in his crimes? San. Most truly. I forgot that circumstance. Fer. See that thou punctually obey my orders. Fate! give me but an opportunity Of wielding this good sword for dear Georgina, And we are friends! Come, Sancho, follow me! [Exit, L. San. I come, my lord. And all I ask the gods Is but a chance to show how I would fight, In field or battery, by day or night, On foot, on back of charger, mule, or poney, For my dear Babbla, 'gainst this Massaroni! [Exit, L. Enter Georgina and Babbla, R. Geo. Have my commands been punctually obeyed? Bab. Even, my lady, to the very letter. Geo. What think you of my project, Babbla? say. Bab. That it's well worthy of a woman's head, But whether woman's heart hath resolution To execute it, really I've my doubts. Geo. Then banish them, and let bold certainty Inspire thee with confidence. Why, girl, Reflect: it is for sacred Love we fight, And that dear name puts coward fear to flight. Say, where are the fair candidates for fame? Bab. They wait without. Geo. Admit them instantly. Enter several young Ladies, the friends and companions of Georgina. Companions of my youth, accept my thanks For your prompt acquiescence in a plan Inspired by love; and, although fraught with peril, Still nothing to the noble resolution That flashes from your eyes. Where danger threatens, The brave fail not to reap a glorious harvest. Say, are you willing then to follow me, And boldly to the world your courage prove In the defence of persecuted love? Ladies. We are resolved! Geo. Thanksâthanks, my gallant friends! FINALE.âSolo and Grand Chorus. Air, âAll the blue bonnets are over the border.â SOLO.âGeorgina. March! march! 'tis at young Cupid's call; Glory to her who her life for him loses! March! march! pretty maids one and all; No gallant youth will love her who refuses. Then, without fear, let us on to the battle-field, There, amidst danger, to prove our affection; Neverâno, never, not even in death, to yield, For valour it is that crowns love with perfection. GRAND CHORUS. [-Ladies] March! march! 'tis at young Cupid's call; Glory to her who her life for him loses! March! march! pretty maids one and all; No gallant youth will love her who refuses.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âThe Ruins of an old Abbey, by Moonlight, R. U. E.âa gate and windows, through which a light is seenâa guitar hanging near the ruins. Enter Rosa, with a basket of flowers, L. Rosa. My basket is replenish'd with choice flowers, So I'll away to see the masquerade. [As she is crossing to R., females are heard laughing loudly in the ruins. Bless me! what sounds of revelry were those In yonder abbey? Ha! I see a light! The nunnery has not been inhabited For many years. [Laughing repeated.] Goodness! what can this mean? [She looks through the keyhole of the door. Oh, Gemini! what mischief's now afloat? Ha! Georgina and her young companions Dressing themselves a such a strange attire, ThatâBut I'll hide, for here the lady comes. [She conceals herself behind the ruins, R. U. E. Enter Georgina from the ruins, R., in the costume of the brigand Massaroni. Geo. [Drawing a pistol, as if stopping a traveller.] âStand and deliver, traveller, or you die! What! you've no money? Swear it by the saints! Poor fellow! take this purse; for Massaroni Robs but those who rob their fellow-creatures; Glutting themselves upon the widow's substance, The orphan's birthright. Such it is his glory To fleece, as they fleece others. Now, farewell; And if the privileged robbers of this world Should ask thee where the brigand Massaroni Can be found, reply, that in the mountains He dwells with honour and humanity! [Aside.] Come, that, I think, is not so much amiss! Rosa. [Aside, peeping from the ruins.] No, for a miss, it certainly is not! Geo. There's something quite inspiring in this dress; I feel myself courageous as a lion! SONG.âGeorgina. A soldier's life, as I've been told, Is one that's full of glee; To dress so smart, and look so bold, Is just the thing for me. Then to the drum and fife so shrill, March, march away I will; Yes! to the drum and fife so shrill, March, march away I will! To fight against the tyrant foe In Freedom's sacred cause, Is just the very way, I know, To gain my friends' applause. Then to the drum and fife so shrill, March, march away I will; Yes; to the drum and fife so shrill, March, march away I will! Rosa. [Coming forward, mimicking Georgina.] âMarch, march away, I won't!â Geo. [Aside.] Here comes a country girl, the pretty Rosa. I'll frighten her, and then make love to her. [Aloud, in a gruff voice. How dare you, girl, at this untimely hour, Cross Massaroni's path? Rosa. Because I know He is too generous to harm a poor And unoffending little flower girl. Geo. Be not too sure of that. But tell me, damsel, Didst ever see the brigand Massaroni? Rosa. Never; but I have often heard of him. Geo. [In a menacing attitude.] He stands before thee now! Rosa. [Coolly.] You don't say so? Geo. [Aside.] The saucy minx! she surely cannot know me? [Aloud.] Thou dost not tremble, then. Rosa. Tremble!âOh, no! I don't know why I should, I'm sure. Geo. Thou'rt right, Fair maid! I love the gentle sex. Rosa. [Aside.] No doubt: self-love's the first of nature's laws! Geo. Tell me, what think you of Massaroni? Rosa. [Roguishly regarding Georgina.] Oh, he's well enough, if he had a beard. Geo. Psha! simpleton!âHe is as yet quite young. Rosa. I see he is;âso young, that were he dressed In petticoats, he'd look just like myself. Geo. [Aside.] What a sharp eye the little vixen has! [Aloud.] No matter how he looks; he is resolved To have a kiss of you, at all events. Rosa. With all my heart, miss; twenty, if you please. Geo. Miss!âThou saucy little rogue! what mean ye? Rosa. I crave your pardon, Signor Massaroni; But having two such pretty pouting lips, A face so smooth, so sweet, so languishing, I took you for a gentle love-lorn lady. Geo. Thou art mistaken, silly girl! 'Tis I,â I who make the proudest princes tremble! Massaroni is in war a lion, Dealing destruction on his enemies; In peace a lamb, courting the gentle arts Of poetry and music. [Fetching the guitar.] Come, listen. SONG.âGeorgina. Air, âLove's Ritornella.â From The Brigand, by J. R. PlanchÃ©, No. 170, Cumberland's British Theatre. Gentle Rosabella, whither away? Love's ritornella list while I play. Know thou hast linger'd too long on the road; Night is advancingâthe brigand's abroad. Pretty Rosabella, whither away? Love's ritornella list while I play! Charming Rosabella, pray do not fear; Night is not darker than thy raven hair; And those starry eyes, which the brigand doth see, Makes him a captiveâa robber of thee! Gentle Rosabella, whither away? Love's ritornella list while I play! Simple Rosabella, bewareâoh! beware! List ye no ditty, grant ye no prayer: To thy light footsteps let terror add wings; 'Tis Massaroni himself who now sings. [Rosa shakes her head. Gentle Rosabella, pray do not fear; Love's ritornella tarry and hear! Rosa. Delightful, I declare! Really, signor, Methinks that singing better far becomes You than blustering and fighting. Geo. [Angrily.] Beware Of Massaroni's frown; for, with the speed Of lightning, whene'er he gives the signal, His daring band of brigands all rush forth, Ready to execute their chief's command. [Whistling. Behold, and tremble! Enter Babbla and Female Brigands from the ruins. Bab. [To Georgina.] Captain, your pleasure? Rosa. [Laughing.] Captain!âHa! ha! ha! Geo.

In passing yonder ruins, a glimmering Light I saw; a merry peal of laughter Struck mine ear; and, peeping slyly through That crazy lock, I foundâhey presto! found The key to all your hidden mysteries!

To take an evening promenade, my lord, Attended by her maid and fair companions. Count. The time's ill chosen; for should the brigand, Massaroni, and his band surprize them, They'll prove so rich a booty, the treasures Of a dukedom would not pay the ransom. Mar. [Coming forward.] Spake you of Massaroni, noble sir? If he dare make prisoner of Georgina, I'll give him such a ransom with my sword, As very soon shall make him cry âpecavi!â Therefore no compromise, my lord, I pray, Or you'll offend my valour. Count. I rejoice To find my future son-in-law so brave; For I detest a coward in my soul. Come, Jeromo; my honoured guests e'en now Assemble in the banquet hall, to share The sports. [To Sapparino.] We shall expect you there. [Exeunt Count Dorio and Jeromo, R. Mar. Anon, my most noble father-in-law! [Calling off, R. S. E.] What ho! Ladroni! Enter Ladroni, R. S. E. Lad. I am here, my lord. Mar. Didst overtake the little flower-girl, The charming Rosa? Lad. After a hard chase, I did, my lord. Mar. What said she to my letter? Enter Rosa, L. S. E., listening. Lad. Kissed it a thousand times, and then cried, âYes!â Mar. [Delighted.] Dear, lovely girl!âThen she is sure to come? Lad. As sure as fate. Mar. Such charms! such modesty! Lad. Don't be certain of that, my lord. Mar. Why, knave? Dost dare assert that Rosa is not honest? Lad. The saints forbid! I only asked a kissâ Mar. Which she most properly refused. Lad. I pray you, Regard me well, my lordâthis graceful mein; Then ask yourself, if it were possible For any woman to refuse a kiss To one so handsome as your serving man? Mar. Thou'rt a conceited coxcomb! Lad. As I said, I asked a kiss; andâwould you credit it? She gave me twenty; called me her love, and Swore that I wasâ Rosa. [Suddenly stepping between them.] A scurvy, lying knave! Mar. Ah! charming Rosa! Rosa. I insist, my lord, That you compel yon varlet to retract His foul aspersions on my reputation. Mar. [Drawing his sword.] He shall do so, or I will run him through! [Ladroni falls on his knees. Rosa. My lord, I will myself dictate the terms Of the vile slanderer's recantation. Mar. [Pointing his sword at Ladroni.] Thou knave! repeat fair Rosa's words, or die! Rosa. [Dictating to Ladroni, who repeats each line after her.] I, Miguel Ladroni, do declare, That what I have said against the fair fame Of Rosa Coralli, the flower-girl, Was but a tissue of the foulest slander, And base, unfounded lies!âAnd this I swear Is true, as I am a boasting liar! Rosa. Enough! I'm satisfied. Lad. [Aside, rising.] That's more than I am! Mar. [To Ladroni.] Go, sirrah, and prepare my domino, Then await my coming. Lad. [Going.] I obey, my lord. [Aside, pointing to Rosa. Though I'm a liar, I'll for once speak true: When next I shrive, I'll not confess to you. [Exit, R. Mar. Most charming Rosa! fairest of all flowers! Rosa. Fairer than your beautiful Georgina? Mar. We will not mention her just now, my dear; But talk a little of our love intrigue. Rosa. Fie! my lord. I must go sell my flowers. Mar. I'll buy them, and with them thy sweet self. [Giving her a purse.] Will this suffice? Rosa. For what, most noble sir? Mar. To buy thy flowers. Rosa. Aye, a hundred times. Mar. But to buy you? Rosa. Not all that you possess! [Throwing the purse at him indignantly. Take back your purse! The price of innocence Is nothing less than honourable wedlock! Mar. [Aside, pocketting the purse.] A little preacher, this, in petticoats! [Aloud.] Be not angry, Rosa;âsell thy flowers, And meet me at the masquerade.âAdieu! [Exit, C. D. F. Rosa. Yes, I will go; and it shall be my task, Before them all a villain to unmask! [Exit, R. SCENE III. âThe Banquet Hallâfolding-doors, C. F. Jeromo and Domestics discovered making preparations for the masquerade. Jer. Come, bustle, bustle, idle knaves! our guests Will speedily arrive. The wine and fruits Place on this table, and the flower vases On yon buffet; but with all due regard To taste and symmetry. There, that will do! [Festive music heard without. Now fly! begone! open the folding-doors! For, hark! the motley company draws near. [Exeunt Servants, running, L., followed by Jeromo. Music.âEnter the Count de Dorio, in his own dress, introducing Masquerade Characters; amongst them the Marquis Sapparino, Ladroni, Count Fernando, Sancho, Rosa, &amp;c. Count. Welcome, my honoured guests!âLet mirth and joy Tune every heart to sweetest harmony. [Aside.] Like many a priest, I find it easier far To preach than practice: my joy is marred By my daughter's absence. Fer. Where's Georgina, The banquet's pride and brightest ornament? Count. She went to take an evening promenade Into the orange grove that skirts the villa, And hath not yet returned. Fer. Imprudent girl! By nightâunguardedâand at the time When Massaroni, by most sure report, Is lurking near the spot! Fare you well, Most noble signors and signoras all! I'll watch the footsteps of the lovely maid, And safely guide her to her father's arms, Or perish for her sake! Sancho, to horse! [Exit, C. D. F. San. I come, my lord. [To Jeromo.] But where's my dear Babbla? Jer. Go to, thou shallow pate!âWhere should she be, But with her mistress? San. And ere this, mayhap, In Massaroni's power. That thought is madness! Fernando. [Without.] Sancho! to horse, I say! San. I come, my lord! And now, brim full of rage, I'll mount my poney, And take revenge on this vile Massaroni! [Exit, C. D. F. Mar. [Coming forward with Rosa.] E'en let my silly rival, Count Fernando, Go fight with Massaroni: I've a magnet To me far more attractive. Charming Rosa! Now's the time for our little tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte. Rosa. Such liberties would ill become a guest So humble as myself, without permission Of the most noble master of the villa. [Calling loudly. Count Dorio, and his worthy company, A word with you, I crave. [Courtsies. Mar. [Aside.] Confound the jilt! Lad. [Apart to the Marquis.] What think you of her now, my lord?âWhat charms! How innocent! [The Count and guests come forward. Count. [To Rosa.] What wouldst thou, pretty maid? Rosa. Tell me, noble sir: is not yon marquis Betrothed to your fair daughter? Count. Truly is he. Rosa. Then, my good lord, that you may know the man Who is to be your future son-in-law, Peruse that letter. [Handing it.] On the eve of marriage, He could not better occupy his time Than in attempts to ruin a poor girl, Whose only fortune is her innocence! Count. [To the Marquis, after reading the letter.] âWhat means this villany? Mar. [Coolly.] 'Tis gallantry! In this refined and fashionable age, Such little love intrigues are all the rage. Count. My daughter's hand, my lord, shall ne'er be yours. Mar. Perhaps not. Her fortune I am sure of: Look ye, here is the marriage contract! Count. [Aside.] Fool that I was to act so thoughtlessly! [To the guests.] I do entreat of you, my honoured guests, Let not this mar your present harmony. Minstrels, strike up, and drown a father's cares! Music.âA CHARACTERISTIC BALLET. [The ballet is interrupted by the report of fire-arms, and the screams of females without. Re-enter Jeromo, hastily, C. D. F. Jer. Suspend your festive mirth, and save yourselves! Flyâfly! 'tis the brigand Massaroni! [Music.âGeneral consternationâthe company scamper offâthe Marquis Sapparino creeps under the table. Enter Georgina, C. D. F., as the Brigand Chief, followed by Babbla, as her principal Officer, and the rest of the Fair Brigands, firing off their pistols.âLadroni is about to escapeâGeorgina seizes him by the collar, drags him back, and he falls on his knees. Geo. [In a gruff voice.] Who art thou, fellow? Lad. A poor honest servant. Geo. Who is thy lord? Lad. The Marquis Sapparino. Geo. The coward knave of whom I come in search! Where is he? [Presenting a pistol.] Speak! or I'll make thee tremble! Lad. [Loudly.] Not for the world would I betray my master! [In a whiper.] Look under yonder table! Geo. [Going to the table.] Come forth, thou Recreant coward!âAnswer for thy crimes To Massaroni, and beg for mercy! [She pulls him from under the table by the ear. Mar. [On his knees.] Oh! mercyâmercy! good Signor Brigand! Geo. Most truly, now, thou art a valiant knight! Is this the gallant Marquis Sapparino? The desperate swordsman, who, in twenty minutes, Can slay as many brigands? I have heard Of your vain boasting, sir; and now demand That you make good your words. [Producing a brace of pistols.] Come, take your choice, And fight me on the spot, or own yourself A coward! [Pointing to Ladroni.] Yonder base knave, your valet, May be your second. Lad. No; with your good leave, I'll not be second in this desp'rate strife, But firstâto run and save my precious life! [Exit, C. D. F. Geo. [To Sapparino.] No matter; you can fight without a second. Mar. I have no wish to murder any man, Far less a gentleman so much respected As Signor Massaroni. Here's my purse, Well lined with gold, if that will satisfy you; But I entreat you, use no violence, And, above all, do not derange my person. Geo. Thou painted butterfly! put up thy purse; For Massaroni scorns to rob a wretch So poor, so utterly contemptible as thou! Mar. Ah! how generous! [Footsteps heard without. Bab. [Looking off.] Dispatch him, captain; The villa is alarmed. Geo. [Cocking her pistol.] Then he must die! Mar. [Trembling.] And will you take no ransom? Geo. None!âPrepare! Yet stay!âOn one condition thou may'st live. Mar. Name it; I will consent to all you ask. Geo. Know, then, that Massaroni is the friend Of persecuted lovers. I have heard, With indignation just, that you aspire To wed the daughter of Count Dorio, Although her heart you know can ne'er be yours. Your claim indeed is lawful, for you hold The contract in your hand; but I, who set Laws at defiance, do demand of you Immediate surrender of the deed. Mar. [Aside.] What a ferocious tiger! [To Georgina.] I do obey. Signor, here is the marriage contract. Geo. [Taking the deed.] 'Tis well; yet even this is not enough. Luckily, I see on yonder table Pens, ink, and paper ready. [Giving them to him.]âCome, write, Most noble lord, write what I shall dictate. Mar. [Aside, kneeling, and taking the pen.] Shall I? Geo. No hesitation, or you die! [Dictating.] I, Guido Sapparino, do for ever Renounce all claim to Georgina's hand; And do confess myself a poltroon and A coward! Mar. [Throwing down the pen.] No, no, signor; that's too bad! Geo. [Threatening.] Not worse than being shot!âWrite, sir, or die! Mar. [After writing.] 'Tis done, most generous Signor Massaroni! Geo. Ha! 'tis well! I came not here to plunder: I am satisfied. Now will I retire. Mar. [Aside, going.] And so will I! Geo. [Pulling him back.] And is it thus, my lord, You'd leave the company of a gentleman, Sans ceremony? Mar. [Bowing reluctantly.] Sir, I crave your pardon! Adieu, most noble Signorâ[Aside.] A'Diable! Geo. [Imitating him.] Adieu, most noble marquis! a revoir! Mar. [Aside.] Not for ten thousand crowns! Now, then, my legs, Be true as gold, and swift as lightning! [Exit, running, R. Omnes. [Laughing.] Ha! ha! ha! Geo. [In her natural voice.] Well, ladies, I must say you've done your duty Most admirably. All goes bravely on; And never was a desperate enterprise Crowned with success more brilliant! Voices. [Without.] On! on! Count Fernando. [Without.] Come, follow me into the banquet-hall! Bab. [Pointing off, R.] Behold! the Count Fernando comes this way. Geo. Then, Babbla, we must instantly retreat. Now, comrades, to the right about faceâmarch! [Music.âGeorgina and the rest retreat in good order, L. SCENE IV. âA Landscape. Enter Georgina, Babbla, and the rest of the Fair Brigands, hastily, R. S. E. Geo. Halt, comrades!âNow to cover our retreat. Make readyâpresentâfire! [They fire off, L. Bab. Plenty of smoke, my lady, but no danger; Since our pistols are but charged with powder. Voices. [Without.] Follow! follow! Geo. They come!âNow to the abbey ruinsâmarch! [Exeunt, L. S. E. Enter Count Fernando, Count Dorio, Sancho, Jeromo, and Vassals, hastily, in pursuit, R. S. E. Fer. This way, my friends. [To Count Dorio.] You say my dear Georgina Hath not returned? Count. Alas! I grieve to say, We've heard no tidings of her, and I fear, Lest Massaroni should have crossed her path. San. And my dear Babbla, too? Jer. No doubt of it. Babbla is as true to her fair mistressâ San. As I to my good master. Fer. Cease prating; And follow to the rescue of my love! [Exit, L. S. E. San. To the world's end! [Flourishing his sword.]âNow, then, for love and glory! [Exeunt, L. S. E. Enter Rosa, R., followed by Ladroni, with his head bound up. Rosa. I hope your wound, poor fellow, is not mortal! Lad. Alas! I feel it is. Rosa. How did it happen? Lad. In fighting beside my honoured, noble master, That rascal Massaroni fired his pistol Point blank into my face; right through my head The bullet flew! Enter the Marquis Sapparino, R. S. E., unseen by Rosa and Ladroni. Rosa. What a calamity! Let me examine if the wound be serious. Lad. 'Tis useless, pretty Rosa; mortal aid Can now avail me nothing, for by this Time to-morrow, I shall be meat for worms! Rosa. The saints forbid! Come, I will be your doctor. Lad. 'Tis of no use! Rosa. Yes, but I say I will! [She unties the handkerchief, Ladroni endeavours to prevent her. Oh, what a dreadful wound!âWhy, as I live, I cannot even see the slightest scratch! Mar. [Stepping between them.] Why, thou poltroon! didst thou not run away? Lad. Yes, I ran to fetchâmore ammunition. [Exit, L. Mar. The miserable coward!âI alone Bore the whole brunt of the tremendous conflict! Rosa. Aye, on your knees; for you must know, my lord, That I peeped through the key-hole all the time. Mar. You did! [Aside.] The little vixen! [Aloud.] Hush, dear Rosa! Speak not a word of what you saw, I pray! Besides, I'm engaged just now.âAdieu! [Exit, hastily, L. Rosa. [Calling after him.] Stay, stay!âWhere is your marriage contract? The paper that the brigand made you sign? [Laughing.] Ha! ha! ha! [Exit, R. SCENE V. âThe Abbey Ruins, as before. Enter Count Fernando, Sancho, Count Dorio, Jeromo, Rosa, Vassals, Peasants, and Attendants, L. San. [To Fernando.] This way, my lord; the brigands have retreated To yon abbey ruins. Fer. Surround the pile, And we will quickly force them to surrender! [He advances fiercely to the ruins, R. U. E. Yield thee, thou daring outlaw, Massaroni! Or die a rebel and a traitor! [The abbey gate opens. Enter Georgina and the Female Brigands, in long cloaks and brigand hatsâthey sally forth, presenting their pistols. Geo. Never Will Massaroni yield while life remains! Fer. Then take thy just reward! [To the Vassals.]âWhat ho! make ready! Present!â Geo. Tut! tut!âThink not to frighten me: For know, that Georgina and her companions Are still within my power. Fire on us, Their death is certain! Count. [To Fernando.] Forbear! for mercy's Sake, forbear! [To Georgina.] Name but the ransom, brigand,â Take all my goldâtake all I have on earth, But give me back my child! Geo. I ask no ransom: Give your fair daughter to Count Fernando, And the bold mountain brigand is content. Fer. Now, by my sword, thou art a gen'rous foe! Count. Gladly would I comply with thy demand, But that my daughter is by contract bound To the coward Marquis Sapparino. Geo. To wring that contract from a villain's grasp I made th' attack this night upon your villa. [Holding up the deed.] See, my lord, 'tis here! Take it, Fernando! [Gives him the contract. Accept it from the hand of Massaroni! Fer. Would that all honest men were but as brave As the bold brigand chief! Geo. No compliments. [Giving a paper to Count Dorio. Here is, besides, another document, In which your brave intended son-in-law, The marquis, doth confess himself a coward. Count. [After perusing the paper.] 'Tis even so!âNow, generous brigand, Where is my child, the lovely Georgina? [Georgina and her companions throw off their disguise. Geo. Here, noble sireâthe Female Massaroni! [Count Dorio presents Georgina to Fernando, and Babbla rushes into the arms of Sancho, amidst the shouts and huzzas of the Peasantry and Attendants. GRAND CHORUS.âFINALE. Happy pair! happy pair! Hymen take you to his care; And the sunshine of your joy May no troubles e'er annoy! Happy pair! happy pair! Hymen take you to his care! DISPOSITION OF THE CHARACTERS AT THE FALL OF THE CURTAIN. Vassals. Attendants. Vassals. Jer. Rosa. Count D. Georgina. Fernando. Bab. San. Ladies. Ladies. THE END.</field>
