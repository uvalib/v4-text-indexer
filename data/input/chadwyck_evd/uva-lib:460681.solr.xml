      <field name="fulltext">SYLLA: A TRAGEDY, IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Cornelius Sylla, Dictator. Faustus Sylla, his Son. Claudius, Friend of Faustus. Roscius, Celebrated Actor. Catiline, Senator. Metellus, Consul. Aufidius, LÃ¦nas, Senator. Balbus, Ofella, Senator. Valeria, Wife of Claudius.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SceneâRome. Four first Acts, Palace of the Dictator. Fifth Act, the Forum.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Stage is faintly lit by an Antique Lamp, which burns in the Palace. ROSCIUS, METELLUS. ROSCIUS. An unexpected summons, which I dare Not understand, bids me to-night appear Within the palace; there is no excuse; And an unconquerable fear enthrals me:â At such an hourâat such a place too. METELLUS. Fear Need not be thought of, Roscius, by the man Whom Sylla favours and protects; for you The stern Dictator softens down his pride, Termed by th'audacious vulgar, Cruelty: Admitted to his counsels, he allows Your words to charm his soul; he hears, believes youâ You boast alone that happy privilege, To bid his wrath relent; and I have seen That proud and gloomy spirit more than once Bend to thy voice and yield it to thy prayer: Sylla beholds in you the living painter Of the noble actions of our ancestors. ROSCIUS. Yes, Sylla shews a perfect worshipper Of our old Romans; he allows their praise To be resounded in the theatre; He honours ScÃ¦vola, admires too Brutus, Yet he proscribes their virtues in their children. METELLUS. Henceforward tyranny's our safeguard;âRome Accepts the yoke of this all-powerful genius; Without him all had perished; no restraintâ No rights, availed us aught; force had usurped The laws' high majesty; the senate, forum, Alike within the city, as without it, All, all in civil discord wide blazed forth, What time rash Marius, leading on a mob Glutted with executions, shared with them The remnants of the state;âall was restored By Sylla:âFortune from the Melas' banks Leads back the conqueror of Orchomenes: He fights, o'ercomes, attains the highest honour, While Marius and his party whelmed in gore, Expire, and Peace again revives in Rome: A mortal's arm achieved what the Gods could not. ROSCIUS. Oh! could but Nature spare our noble Romans Those lofty, superhuman, dangerous spirits! Too much of grief, too many ills attest The track of those bright stars, sons of the tempest. Yet I admire that man, Metellus, whom An unknown merit to all eyes marks out; His genius is to me as the hot furnace Whence Etna pours forth her devouring flame, Without a sound that to th'affrighted world May tell the hidden fury that torments it. To the supreme ascendant we alike All yield us, which thus to itself chains down The people and the senate; and our eyes Measure with awe the pinnacle's proud height Where the dictator hero seats himself: But when we probe the cause that sways our feelings, The admiration that we have for Sylla Leaves in our breasts regrets, alas! how bitter! The arbiter of Rome hath given her chains; Fair Freedom is no more, sons of Cornelia! Or only slumbers in the tomb with you. METELLUS. And who regrets it, since it only proved A name, 'neath which the factious hid their treasons? When an unbridled people, blind with rage, Betrayed their country at a tribune's mandate, O'erturned the altars, broke the law's strong yoke, And dared to weigh the rights of the patricians? Then let us bless that tutelary arm, O Roscius, which can to the people's rage Oppose a barrier: Sylla checks the ills That spring from discord, and his happiness Rewards his noble deeds. ROSCIUS. The happiness Of Sylla!âI can better read that soul His violence racks, his course of life enflames: This hot, intrepid, and audacious mortal, This Ajax, fearless of the blaze of Heaven, While in that Heaven the day-star reigns supreme, Would brave the ruin of a crashing world, And view with unpaled cheek th'immense destruction. But when 'tis night, he starts e'en at the sound Of his own footsteps, and amid her shades His fearful soul but slumbers painfully, So gloomy are his dreamsâhe, even he, Who during day governs whole destinies, Consults at dead of night dark auspices, Fearful of solitude, of shade, of silence: Such is the happy Sylla! METELLUS. Hist! they come. SCENE II. ROSCIUS, METELLUS, CATILINE, BALBUS, CATULUS, OFELLA. METELLUS. Methinks you're late, Ofella, Catulus: And your delay might have kept Sylla waiting. OFELLA. The lictor here, that brought the message, can Bear witness of our haste. CATILINE. And Catiline Does of the zeal of Balbus. SCENE III. ROSCIUS, METELLUS, CATILINE, BALBUS, OFELLA, CATULUS, SYLLA, Chief of the Lictors. SYLLA, (speaking to ROSCIUS, who is retiring). Draw nearer, senators;âstay, Roscius, You seem embarrassed; whence is this constraint, And wherefore?âBanish in my presence fear: Lavish of hatred t'wards mine enemies, There's no one showers more favours on his friends; 'Tis none of you my present aspect threatens; Then fearless hear me, and let each be seated. [The Lictors seat themselves in order at a marble table, upon which the Chief of the Lictors, on a given signal from SYLLA, places a roll of parchment. You know at what price I've acquired a power Of which the duty was imposed on me By an expiring state; what matters it, That Sylla, glorying in his feats of war, Had carried to the earth's extremest bounds The Roman name; that by me Mithridates Had been compell'd to fly; and to my car In triumph yoked Jugurtha; that for me Fortune, with miracles so vastly pregnant, Had given you glory, and the world repose; If Marius, reaping of my daring deeds The fruit, had dictated to the senate laws; And, bursting of a frantic mob the bonds, Given the republic up to its blind fury? Rome then, triumphant tho' abroad, at home A slave, would have expired beneath the blows Of her own children;âfrom so sad a fate Whose arm was it that snatched her?âit was Sylla's;â Sylla propitious shews before PrÃ¦neste; All flee or fall; all yield to my first efforts, And Marius' son attends his father's shade. With me, abjuring counsels of false mercy, Terror and vengeance enter into Rome; The safety of the state demands proscriptions, And waves of blood must quench each raging faction. Behold me master of the people, and Alike the senate: the one learns to fear, The other learns to know me: while my power Hated so much, stands as the last support Of that same freedom I oppress to-day. Far, far from Rome the God of battle roars, And in your walls breathes mild the calm of peace; Yet, yet you murmur, and some voices e'en Give vent to rebel plainings, and the shade From Arpinum aloft uprears its head, And from the bosom of the tomb invokes The tempest; guilty whispers heard around Announce dark plots;âbut they must be prevented. The safety of the state in justice asks A rigorous duty, one last sacrifice: Look at the names inscribed upon that listâ They are the proscripts that Rome yet demands, 'Tis the last red flash of a healthful storm;â Then give we to the public peace this pledge; Yet I would know before you sign it, if There's any Roman we can safely spare: Look;âbut remember well the case is such, That each must answer for the friend so spared. [Giving the list to METELLUS. METELLUS. In Cimber's favour I dare raise my voice; Living retired, and to thy laws submissive, Weighed down, protected by his load of years, He had hoped, Sylla,â CATILINE. Did he dare to hope? We know, tho' exiled, he augments his griefs, Pours forth loud lamentations to his sons, And treasures up the statues too of Marius. SYLLA. Age has well nigh consumed his waning fires: Metellus shields himâ'tis enoughâhe lives. OFELLA. Dare I of Sylla in my turn demand What secret power, what guardian shade, can thus From Cesar ward off dilatory justice? SYLLA. Like you I've weighed his vices and his virtues, And I see more in Cesar than a Marius: I know what hopes his young pride bacchanal: But Pompey lives, and even so must Cesar. 'Mid all the Romans to my power submissive, I have no rivals: I have need of foes; Foes generous, tho' proud, whose presence serves But to attest my genius as my might. History will then my name associate With that of Marius; Cesar will have lived To do me justice. CATILINE. Of obscure criminals The which thy mercy spares, I speak not; but Excess of zeal tends to increase my prudence: I see not Claudius' name upon the list; Of all thy foes he's the most dangerous. SYLLA. I ask not whether thine emboldened hatred Pursues in Claudius fair Valeria's husband; Or whether this advice of Catiline, So fatal, tends to serve my cause, or thwart A rival. CATILINE. Son of that detested tribune, Who sold thy goods, proscribed thy wife, Sulpicius; 'Tis he that threatens, it is he conspires, Already hath his fury sworn revenge To his paternal manes. METELLUS. While he boasts The friendship of thy son, Sylla will surely List to his pleading voiceâ'tis Catiline Accuses, Faustus that defends him. CATILINE. I Accuse his hatred, his designsâI know Metellus, and my inexperience owns Him wise in aught but this, but who to-day Can say that Catiline's so much to blame? For what does Claudius, but conspire 'gainst Sylla? My feelings and my duty bid me speak; A plot exists, and Claudius is its leader. [SYLLA, (writing down the name of CLAUDIUS). His ancestry's his crime, and 'tis Sulpicius That feels my vengeance, tho' 'tis Claudius dies. [Rising up. What matters after all one man's existence? I see nought, have seen nought, but Rome's fair safety; No private interest now excites my rigour, 'Tis to avenge the laws that I'm dictatorâ Rome will yet one day learn from me with what Contempt I treat her highest power. Ho! lictors, Be sure this law outstrips the sun. [Gives the list to the Chief of the Lictors. To the Senators. And you, Give me your answer when I rise to-morrow. [He bows to them, and beckons ROSCIUS to remain. SCENE IV. ROSCIUS, SYLLA. SYLLA. Now, Roscius, speak with freedom. ROSCIUS. Rather bid me The more keep silenceâit hath made you mark How deep a grief this moment fills my breast. And why?âfor ever tears, for ever bloodshed! Unceasing sorrows and eternal fears! Thou, formed by Heaven to conquer heroes, thou Who'st signalized thy name by godlike labours, Whose genius all-submissive earth attests;â Oh! while thou reignest as her lord and master Within the bosom of thy country, while All, all thy sovereign orders prompt obey, For what crimes, Sylla, dost oppress the Romans? SYLLA. Their crimes?âthat they accept the chains I give them, Yet dare to hope for Sylla's pardon;âRoscius, Thou know'st me not, I see it, and my soul Is still to thee a mysteryâLiberty Was e'er the darling idol of my vows, Though victim of my power;âI've fought for her, Ay, in the Senate, in the Forum, in The fields of Cheroneus, on the sands Of Arpinum; it was for all I sought her. But on the Tiber's banks none save myself Saw I that courted libertyâthe tribunes Shewed rivals of the consuls, and intrigue Upreared her fasces at the price of gold;â Nought could I find but venal dignities, Insolent slaves, long saturnalia, Unpunished crimes, degenerate hearts, that with Impunity their own sole interests watched;â Too proud of his own baseness, a stern soldier 'Neath the plebeian yoke drove the patricians. From that time did I promise me to make The tribune Marius some not distant day Account for all his haughty scorn;âhis name For more than one proud victory was vaunted, And yet by nobler deeds I paled his gloryâ More, I've beheld that hateful rival forced (And in the capitol) to thank the Gods for't. My hope was to preserve the State, and ruin And exile was my recompense.âI veiled My head, t'avoid the lictor's fasces; quitted, Proscribed my country;âI return dictator. In times like these I deem it little worth To tell the blood from which I'm sprung, or shew The scorn I bear mankind;âthe Romans have No claim upon me, save 'tis as their foe. Unbiassed I have judged them, without hate As without pity.âI have broke your fetters Spite of yourselves, I cried;âWhat, citizens, And will you still be slaves? poor cowards!âNo,â I deem you worthy of a nobler fate. You ask for chainsâbehold, I give you death! And as you die thank me for this last favour, That to the Gods you yield your souls still free-born. ROSCIUS. Oh! Sylla, soften down your proud disdain; There are, there are souls still how truly Roman. SYLLA. I know it:âCesar, glorious in his valour, And high exalted by illustrious birthâ Pompey the hope of Rome, and the young Catoâ Noble Metellus, and the eloquent Ciceroâ By challenging the world's regards, have rather O'ercome mine anger than aroused my hatred. ROSCIUS. If such is Sylla, if his angry soul Would give us freedom but by blood, oh! let Him then be satisfiedâshe lives in tears; By her youths' parting breath her flames are fanned, And she will one day triumph past your wishes! Remark the generous crowds that fill the theatre, When I in antique toga to the Romans Identify myself with those great men, The honour of the State, proud sons of Mars, The noble pillars of our laws in battle, Warriors, yet true-born citizens:âThere's Curtius That sought an unknown glory,âCincinnatus Rolling his victor chariot,âstern Camillus That weighed his sword against the gold of Rome, And saved her,âDecius, crowning his exploits By death,âand Brutus, he who played the fool But to mature th'idea of hardiest daring,â Lucretia plunging in her breast the dagger, And arming freedom to expel the Tarquins,â Triumphant, though in bondage, Regulus, And thy sire, Scipio, who so well avenged him, E'en at the gates of Carthage:âRoused by these Recitals of their valour, they're transported To those same days of glory, and their breasts Glow with the fires of renovated life, And rise renascent for their country's safety. SYLLA. On these young Romans, then, go try thy power; I'll nor deceive thy wishes nor their hopes. ROSCIUS. Son of Cornelius! call to mind that deed, That generous deed, thy glory's opening dawn, When, erst upon proud Nola's ramparts saved, Her citizens for Sylla's brow enwove The civic wreath.âOh! pardon Claudius! SYLLA. I hear, admire thee, Roscius, and I know Thine empire o'er my heart; 'tis with regret That I withdraw me, but it is my duty, And I must list to things of deeper interest. ROSCIUS. He's thy son's friend. SYLLA. His sentence is decreed. ROSCIUS. But thou know'st not the man that prompted it! SYLLA. I may p'rhaps change my purpose; my decrees Are fixed as those of fateâthey never change. Yet Claudius may be absent when arrives The order which regret... ROSCIUS. Sylla, I trust I understand your meaning. [Rushes out in haste. SCENE V. SYLLA, âAlone. Go, run! thy haste can scarce be urged too much,â Else Catiline more zealous will prevent thee. I know the agents of my dark commands: See here my minions! Balbus, Catiline! These cruel slaves, hired to fulfil mine anger, Degenerate Romans, were right worthy of you. I wished for power but to restore the laws; I have found servitude, and not obedience, And all my useless efforts have at length Convinced me I'm mistaken in the age That I have lived in.âThis supreme ascendant, This destiny so singular, whose power Thus hurries me along, who shall explain it? Born for voluptuous pleasures, I allow My duty to enchain me. Liberty Is what I seek, and I find power. I check My inclinations; fiery, yet sincere And full of pity, I instruct myself How to deceive mankind, and I become Blood-stained. I abhor Marius, and the ills He has committed, and I imitate His crimes in seeking to repair them; fortune Absolves me from them. I must go: the night Around the palace spreads a lighter curtain: Yet I invoke but waking whilst I seek Repose; for Nature at the hour of slumber Avenges all her quarrels.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. FAUSTUS, METELLUS. FAUSTUS. What say'st thou? Claudius on the fatal list! METELLUS. Calm the despair that darkens o'er thy soul, And think the author of it isâthy father; That I obtained for thee the horrid secret... FAUSTUS. But while we thus delay, perchance he dies! METELLUS. Roscius has been beforehand with the morn; He's with him, that I know. FAUSTUS. It is for me To guard his life, to die with him if needful; And I haste thither. METELLUS. See, into what dangers Thy friendship hurries him; thy presence there Will render his destruction but more certain. FAUSTUS. You stop me.âWell then, I go, fly to Syllaâ He will behold my sorrowsâyes, my father Will surely hear me. Claudius, fear no longer The blow that threats thee: at thy feet I'll die, Or I'll obtain thy pardon. METELLUS. The dictator Sleeps in th'interior of the palace, and Forbids all access, even to his son. FAUSTUS. Thy jealous fury, traitor Catiline, Doth promise thee the hoped-for sacrifice Of fair Valeria's husband. Cursed author Of crimes most horrible, my poniard's steel Shall pierce thy heart a hundredfold: that heart Drunken with blood, whose homicidal fury Startled the Romans with the first foul parricide. Miserable minion of a power I hate, Thy death shall expiate thy crimes! METELLUS. Oh! Faustus, In Heaven's name let the hope of innocence Govern th'imprudence of thy fiery feelings. FAUSTUS. Oh! take then pity on my present trouble, And give sweet counsel to my sorrows. METELLUS. I Consent to't.âPromise in thy father's palace To wait my brief return; I bear to Claudius The consular fasces; 'neath a lictor's robe Avoiding scrutiny of eyes; or ere An hour, he flies these luckless walls. FAUSTUS. What hopes You give me! Oh! how infinite the favour!â I stay, Metellus; fly and save my life. SCENE II. FAUSTUS, âAlone. Ye Gods, who rule all human destiniesâ Have ye, and past recall, condemned the Romans? And if 'tis fitting that they feel your anger, Ought ye at least to arm 'gainst them a hand So dear to me? Oh! can I not defend Claudius, hate Catiline, nor cease meantime In my respect tow'rds Sylla? But the day Begins to dawnâoh! light of death! Just Heaven! What, Claudius! Wherefore com'st thou here? SCENE III. CLAUDIUS, FAUSTUS. CLAUDIUS. âTo guard thee. FAUSTUS. Whom? me! CLAUDIUS. Thy danger follows close on mine. I have kept watch to-night around the palace; There's not a Roman whose magnanimous heart Is not deep pledged on oath to punish him Who weighs us down; I know the plots that threat His lifeâincessantly he guards against them, But they revive as often: Sylla must Succumb him to the public hate, and well I know what duty binds thee to his fortunes. Tormented with a secret dark foreboding, I stood beneath an obscure portico, And saw men enter walking slow and whispering; I know not what designs, what hopes conduct them. If it were...oh! methinks I seem to see A band of sworn conspirators thus veiling Their desperate purpose, and upon the death Of the dictator founding their revenge, In aid of liberty, the laws, and Rome. 'Tis thine to shield him with a filial arm: I trembled for thee, therefore came I here. FAUSTUS. Oh! generous friend, what feeling thus for mine Bars thine own safety? In this very palace Know'st thou the fate prepared for thee? unknown Thine own, thou thinkest only of my danger: To save my life thou com'st where thine is proscript. The hideous Catiline, with fiendish fury, Has had thy name placed on the fatal list; E'en now he bends his footsteps to thy house, And death waits thy return. CLAUDIUS. I hasten thither. Long since, ashamed of their false clemency, I did upbraid the Gods that they'd forgot me, When Sylla, less in pity than contempt, Refused t'admit me 'mongst the numbered proscripts. [Holding him back. FAUSTUS. Well, go then, Claudius: throw away thy life, But let the infamy attach itself To me, of having been the cause of it. I too know how t'escape the last of evils, But if you die, Valeria too must perish! CLAUDIUS. Valeria! at that name my courage fails me: Such loveâsuch virtues!â FAUSTUS. Oh! then live for her sake. CLAUDIUS. Live! my dear Faustus!âwhat a wish thou formest! Where must I fly? The world belongs to Sylla. In life I feared him, and in death I brave: To hate and yet obey's the lot of slaves. Oh! I should bless it, this expected fate, Were life's warm current but poured out for Rome! Oh! had I lived but in those times when Carthage Rolled ravage even to the capitol; Or when in insolence fierce Hannibal Bade his proud standards float upon our ramparts. On the plain of CannÃ¦, or the Trebia's banks, Claudius had then died whilst he served his country:â But thus to fall unhonour'd! 'mid the clash Of swords too! FAUSTUS. Well, then, guard this life so dear to us: Unpitying Fortune weighs me to the ground, And leaves but to thy friend this last, last hope. CLAUDIUS. And if I should consent to save my life, Where must I fly, where hide me? FAUSTUS. Here, within My palace; on a day so rife with sadness 'Twere best 'gainst those that follow thee t'oppose Th'inviolate asylum of these walls: Then let them snatch thee from the hearth of Faustus! CLAUDIUS. I might expose youâ FAUSTUS. Ah! let that no more Have weight with thee, lest in the presence of Valeria I accuse thee of betraying Friendship, love, country. CLAUDIUS. To my latest breath It is to them, the umpires of my fate, I would devote my life, my death. FAUSTUS. Then let us Haste to avoid this importuning crowd That comes, adoring the Dictator's fortune, Towards the palace gates t'await his waking. CLAUDIUS. Can he, the author of so many evils, Know what it is to slumber? [They enter the house of Faustus. SCENE IV. CATULUS, OFELLA, BALBUS. Archelaus, Ambassador of Mithridates. Gordius, Ariobarzanes, Kings of Cappadocia. Ambassadors of the Parthians. Consuls. Senators. Courtiers. The Gates are thrown open, and Metellus addressing Balbus, leaves the Palace. METELLUS. The palace gates are open, the Dictator Himself approaches; be it thine t'announce His presence to his clients. [Balbus, advancing towards the background, and addressing the crowd of Clients. BALBUS. Kings, warriors, citizens, proconsuls, senators; You first, ambassadors of untamed Parthia, Here in this hallowed circle, brilliant with His own fair statues, Sylla deigns t'accept Your wishes and your homage. SCENE V. The same Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Sylla, after surveying the Assembly, and addressing himself to Gordius. What has brought thee again before me, Gordius? Know then that Cappadocia is free, And thou no more her sovereign. [To Ariobarzanes. The crown Of an ally deemed faithless by the senate, Is, noble Ariobarzanes, thine: Rome who protects, will punish too her kings. Hence to thy country and enforce our laws: My friendship lifts thee to the highest rank Of princes.âAs a Roman citizen Go rule the provinces; ours thy support As ours thy will. Beneath the shield of power Found liberty. [To the Ambassadors of Parthia. The valour of a nation Bold as the Parthians are and brave, I honour: And I accept their friendship. [Faustus Sylla enters, and, with evidently disturbed feelings, proceeds to place himself near his father. To Archelaus.] As for you, The agent and support of Mithridates, Return thee to thy master, Archelaus; With a barbaric king I treat no more. Go tell him that; and say, the blood he's shed Hath placed, for ever placed a barrier 'twixt us. The hundred thousand Romans he has murder'd Shall, while he lives, sleep unrevengedâno longer. [A Noise is heard from behind; an emotion of terror agitates the Assembly. But whence arise these fears? OFELLA. Loud cries are heard;â SYLLA. Be calm: for why should they create surprise? 'Tis but the execution of my orders, And none need fear, methinks: unless perchance Some proscript yet remain t'await his sentence. OFELLA. A crowd, it seems, advancing t'wards the palace, Wait the Dictator's presence. SYLLA. Well, what want they? OFELLA. LÃ¦nas, who heads them, in their name demands Admission. SYLLA. LÃ¦nas!âHe is charged withal With a but dangerous message;âwhat has he To hope for?âLictors, open him a passage. SCENE VI. The same, and LÃ¦nas. [He addresses Sylla. LÃNAS. Deputed by the Roman people, I Here in thy presence do make bold to ask Some questions. SYLLA. Ask some questions! what, of me! Thy boldness, LÃ¦nas, hath, in truth, surprised me. Yet speak,âI do consent to hear thee. LÃNAS. Sylla, Uncertainty is worse than death; then tell, Tell us what fate awaits us; cannot yet So many funerals satisfy thee? wouldst thou O'erthrow our very city in our blood? Oh! shall each day be witness of fresh horrors? And wilt thou set no limits to thy fury? SYLLA. You see I know, too, to command my feelings; It is perhaps sufficient that I give Thee audience. LÃNAS. When I came within these walls, Not for a moment did I cherish hopes That I should ever have the power to leave them. SYLLA. I hear thee, LÃ¦nas. LÃNAS. What dost thou ordain? To what decision art thou come?âspeak out! Let one day see unrolled the deathful list: Tell us the fate of all thou hast condemn'd. Sylla, how many are proscribed? SYLLA. I know notâ With thee I share the doubt on which thou build'st Thy confidence. LÃNAS. Well, but announce the names Of those decreed to live. SYLLA. LÃ¦nas, return; And by returning shew to those that sent thee That I know e'en to spare mine enemies. LÃNAS. I know my fate; that order tells me it, And to the Roman people it shall be Mine answer. SYLLA. Hence, I say then, lest my rage Should punish, and with justice, in thy person, The legate of the proscripts. [Addressing Metellus, after the exit of LÃ¦nas. Asia, consul, Murena holds, and 'gainst Sertorius I have bid Pompey march; 'tis time, methinks, To punish that ambitious traitor, one Alike deserter of our laws, our Gods. And Marius too, a thousand times more false, Who raised 'gainst Rome his parricidal hand, And sullying his last rays of life with treason, Implores the succour of a foreign sword. CATULUS. But he with Mithridates is in league. [To Metellus. SYLLA. I fear not in the least their base alliance: A traitor sure can suffer the example Himself has set.âPerpenna holds his camp Hard by SertoriusâCesar has asked Gaul; And far from Italy his steps are turned, He marches in Bithynia. Nicomedes Demands no frail support, and it is fit That Cesar make the best use of his valour. But I go soon to join th'assembled senate; I will there hear you, for 'tis best we there Should treat of matters of such high importance. [Upon a motion of the hand from Sylla, the whole Assembly depart. The Kings and the Ambassadors withdraw, having first prostrated themselves before Sylla. Two Lictors march before Ariobarzanes and the Ambassadors of the Parthians, towards whom the Dictator is particularly gracious. SCENE VII. SYLLA, FAUSTUS. FAUSTUS. Sylla, you turn your eyes from me; you fear My criesâOh! fly not from me, deign to hear me. Thy son alone, of all the Romans who Submissive own thy power, feels he's no cause To blush for having ever disobeyed thee. Nature and love impose an equal law, And are these sacred duties to thee nothing? No more of Rome, my country, do I speakâ 'Tis for my friend, 'tis for myself I plead, And at thy feet a pardon ask for Claudius. SYLLA. My son, thou knewest not the dread Sulpicius: But shouldst thou still be ignorant, how he That vile impostor, most inexorable Of all our persecutors, even o'er Thy mother spread the tainture of his crimes! How forced he her scarce living from this palace; Raised high the fiery brand: and to complete The outrage, of the godlike Scipios broke The statues! In these days so full of horrors, Base flatterer of the people, Marius' agent, Surpasses e'en his fury. Such was Sulpicius, such would Claudius be; And yet, unfaithful to the blood that gave Him birth, my rank, my glory, tender friendship, For him alone, for Claudius, does my son Reserve his pious pity. FAUSTUS. Catiline Has on these points deceived you. Yet thou know'st The monster that accuses him; thou know'st The lustful loves that fire his soul:âit is A favour'd lover whom th'assassin strikes at. Despair has doubtless lour'd o'er Claudius' brow To have beheld fair freedom ravished thus From his sad country; memory too of things His soul so cherished serves to make the pupil Of Caius bear thy chains with deep regret: Yet does his generous heart, all wed to Rome, Old worshipper of sacred Liberty, Cursing th'ancestral arm by which she fell, Marius condemn, ay, even more than Sylla. Be not insensate to the voice that pleads Pardon for Claudius: there's yet time to save him. You answer not, and yet you see my grief! Oh! in the name of Heaven, my father, ask, Ask but thine heart. SYLLA. Faustus, the law has said it. And if my duty bids me put that law In force, my private wishes bar delay. But still, despite its rigour, these dark words Shall veil my clemency; and if, far from These walls removed, Claudius by flight attain To baffle his pursuers, to the spot Where as an exile Fortune leads his steps, My wrath no more pursues him:â'tis sufficient. FAUSTUS. Oh! how that hope relieves my weighed down soul! And bids me only think on thine own dangers;â Thy power, thy courage lift thee 'bove the horrors That strike my eyes and press upon my soul. I see each day, pregnant with fearful omens, Roll darker clouds to swell the storm of fate; And that same Liberty, Rome's best-loved idol, Turn 'gainst thyself the very arms thou gav'st her. SYLLA. Beneath the fate predestinate to fall Upon our heads, calmly I march amidst A thousand tempests. Had it been but ours T'have lived, O Faustus! in those times when Heaven Beheld the Romans virtuous, free, and proud Of poverty by glory's ray ennobled, Fight boldly for their country, die and conquer; They should, my son, have seen me, Decius' rival, Surpass the valour of Rome's bravest sons. Those days are far, far gone; the laws no more Have power as wont: while ancient Liberty Beneath Licentiousness expires, and Rome, The despot of the world, is now become But one vast prize open to adverse factions. Forced to renounce the virtues that adorn'd That by-gone age, I bow myself to Fortune; For it was she that formed me, it was she That raised me thus to greatness, in despite Of my own wishes; I received the gift, But with it not her law. I have o'erturned The state but to rebuild it; I was born, I feel it, to upraise or to destroy: And I fulfil my destiny. I lead T'wards Liberty a powerful people, though 'Tis by enslaving them I do it. FAUSTUS. Oh! Ye Gods, how sad a triumph crowns the conquest! Old Scipio sought a far, far other glory; He taught the world to pay respect to Rome, But 'twas for Carthage he reserved his chains. It was the fearful policy made use of By a proud, haughty senate that again Brought back to the republic all these evils; Thou know'st how, when old Marius' thirst of power Armed the despair of an unhappy people, The proscript of Minterna challenged him, Whetting his poniard at the hands of vengeance. Thou com'st, dost combat;âin submission all Bow to thy powerâyet canst thou not, oh! pardon The boldness of a son, when at thy feet Thou see'st discord trampled down for ever, Punish, as thou'st o'ercome, her like a hero? All to thy yoke submit, why stain it then With blood? ought he that conquer'd Marius To follow his example? SYLLA. Never yet Was't mine to follow his blind fury; Noâ The blood I've shed was for my country shed, And soon perchance the Romans and thyself Will at my hands demand e'en that I've spared. SCENE VIII. FAUSTUS, SYLLA, ROSCIUS. SYLLA, to ROSCIUS who enters. Well, and what say they? they exclaim no doubt Against my tyranny, are angry, perhaps? ROSCIUS. The terror of thy name congeals their souls, But they fear death already less than scorn; The people hearing of thy threats, at daybreak In mournful silence took their usual station, Moved to and fro tumultuously, and with An eager eye turned t'wards the palace, sought To read thy next stern order;â'mong the names Inscribed upon the bloody list, is one Second to none in yon vast crowd's affections. The name of Claudius, youthful hero, flies From mouth to mouth, 'mid countless groans; they vaunt His valour, talents, youth, and those high virtues His proud ancestral birthright; it doth seem As if all hearts, pierced through by woe, had lost In him those hopes of fortune they had cherished. Nor was it long before they stood around The house of Claudius, moved with pity for The fate of him they mournedâtheir voice that now Strikes on the air as they call out for Sylla, Maddens in anger too 'gainst Catiline. Thither I hasten'd, and endeavoured, though In vain, to calm the terrors of Valeria, Who, all in tears and ignorant of the fate Of one so dear, esteem'd his absence death. Loud cries are heard, and as the mob approach, Valeria rushing to the door, with hair Dishevell'd, on the threshold kneeling, cries, âIn Heaven's name, Romans, give me back my husband!â Hurried along by these heart-rending words, They place her on a brazen pedestal, And upon that tribunal, as she speaks, All eyes are turned, all hearts alike are fixed. Oh! could I, Sylla, but display the wonders Of her bold eloquence, nor wound thine ear! But the respectâ SYLLA. Proceedâshe did her duty. I've told thee, Roscius, I would know the whole. ROSCIUS. âNo longer, citizens,â she cried, (and as She spoke, the animation that her words Threw o'er her, render'd her more beautiful,) âHas Sylla punishments the which ye know not;â T'await his fury here again behold us. And think'st thou, Rome, that he will spare the blood That yet remains unspilt? I tell thee, Noâ PrÃ¦nestes' destiny will soon be thine. What weigh thy hopes against his wishes? Force Is our sole right, to die our only duty. Our fears are banished by excess of terror, Voiceless the heart, and tearless is the eye; Despair itself no longer sways our feelings, And the tomb shuts in silence on the dead. O'er her lost son the marble mother stands, Yet Sylla, tearless, tranquil views the picture, And counts, with unpaled cheek, the wretched victims His homicidal nod has chilled in death; Our past foretels our future destiny;â Come, let us count how many dead have pass'd The Colline gateâthere in the sacred porch Where Vesta's altars burn, let's haste and see Another ScÃ¦vola expire;âah! Romans, 'Tis for yourselves my voice implores you; Sylla, Reeling in blood, would wish to shed yet more. By woes united, as alike by danger, Who would remain a stranger to my wrongs? Who is there 'mongst you, in this day of shame And misery, but trembles for a son's, Or weeps a father's fate? Already have Two women changed their country's destiny, And sheathed the dagger in their breasts to do it. Oh! would ye at an equal sacrifice Give me but hope, my blood like theirs should dye The steel of Freedom;ââwith these words she rushes On self-destruction...they disarm her hand... Instant the people swear, with deaf'ning shouts, To save the proscripts...add to which the Gauls With terror in their rear are just in sight, Their wild bands headed too by Catiline. Far from the threat'ning storm the people fly, And their late noisy waves subside in silence! SYLLA. Such is their boldness, Roscius, mark it well, When a few Gauls can freeze their boasted courage! FAUSTUS. Yet surely the despair of Caius' sister Must not be deem'd as idleâshould the mob Who love her e'en as they lament her husband... SYLLA. Unheedful of the ills he ne'er may know, 'Tis time for them to fear, when he's in danger. For ever ready to oppose the law Of the Dictator, as for ever ready T'obey the lictor's nod. FAUSTUS. The Romans have Avenged Virginia's and Lucretia's cause. SYLLA. Where are these Romans? FAUSTUS. Heavens! it is Valeria!â SCENE IX. FAUSTUS, SYLLA, VALERIA. Valeria, surrounded by Lictors, with dishevelled hair, and beating her bosom. VALERIA. Give way!âwho is there that shall bear me hence?â I wish to see the tyrant... SYLLA, (coldly.) She can approach. VALERIA. Glut, cruel as thou art, thy hateful soul: Gaze on me! I'm indeed unfortunate. SYLLA. Lictors, withdrawâand you too, Roscius, leave us. VALERIA. I know thee too well, Sylla, too well love My Claudius, to seek for mercy at The hands of that inexorable judge, Whose stern decree this 'cursed day perfects. Thy clemency can easily content me, Tell me my hapless fate, 'tis all I wish: I ask not our offence; to thee alike Courage, shame, speech, e'en silence is a crime. I come not here to frame a poor excuse, Or to disarm thy hand, and save my husband. I share, or rather in his breast excite The generous hatred and deep horror which My husband feels at thy long tyranny. Together we implored our country's Gods, And far from thee in dark obscurity Our prayers were all for Liberty and Rome. In woes alike united as in hopes, Why in thy day of vengeance wouldst thou part us? Yes, Claudius is a hostage for thee, Sylla, And tremble if thou giv'st me cause to fear For other than myself. SYLLA. I do not dread Thy vengeful fury, I have ever spared The weakness of thy sexâthy husband 'tis Conspires against me, and while as Dictator I exercise the rigour of the law Upon her enemies, more merciful As Sylla, I grant pardon to Valeria. VALERIA. I fear thy pardon far more than thine anger; And of the ills thy cruelty has shed Upon us, I most dread thy clemency. Oh! spare at least this horrid punishment, And grant that I may perish near my husband: And be the death whate'er it may, you'll be Less ready to ordain, than we to suffer. And thou too, Faustus, dost thou too keep silence? And turn away thine eyes from me? dost fear My presence would to-day reclaim the rights Of friendship, and accuse thy heart with want Of pity? but take courageâwell I know Thine every meaning, all I may expect From him, the son of Sylla. FAUSTUS. Situate As thou art now, Valeria, thou should'st curb The rage of thy despair, nor more accuse me. VALERIA. What, when my husband's perished!â FAUSTUS. He perchance Yet lives... VALERIA. Where is he then? Oh! speak. FAUSTUS. I know not. VALERIA. Thou know'st not! noâthe paleness that o'erspreads Thy conscious brow reveals the horrid secret. I know thy meaning, and abjure a hope So faint;âoh! there were times when either Marius Knew what it was to lean to clemency: Sylla, the dreadful Sylla, never pardons. Well, in thy palace here, come, slay his widow, For if I pass its threshold, my mad grief Flies but to arm the people's vengeance 'gainst thee. I'll not invoke the feeble aid of those That quick disperse them at thy lictors' presence; If Rome no longer can boast sons to rise And burst a despot's chains and punish him, She yet has daughters that shall dare to do it; Mothers, whose sons thy rage has sacrificed; The widows, wives, and sisters of the proscripts, Await my coming, and though Heaven still spares, Our arms shall rid the world of, Rome's destroyer. FAUSTUS. Oh! Heavens! where dost thou run to? VALERIA. Death, or vengeance! FAUSTUS. Guards! keep her back... SYLLA. Let her depart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. CATILINE, ROSCIUS. CATILINE. The populace are all commotion;âyes, A female rebel calls them openly On to sedition; not a man is found Her griefs have failed to move, her cries t'inflame. None fear t'afford a shelter to the proscripts, And Claudius, by a traitor warned of danger, E'en now by flight insults his master's orders. ROSCIUS. What matters it he's cleared the walls of Rome? Whether on barren rocks, in dreary caves, Hate still pursues him; evil destiny His only crime, and wheresoe'er he flies The dogs of vengeance follow up their victim. CATILINE. Roscius is apt to feign unreal sorrows. ROSCIUS. Thou know'st, far better than I do, to ope The source of griefâI but paint tyranny To make it odiousâas alike ambition To shew its folly; and that vice, the more Puff'd up by hateful triumph, till arrives That hour, though late, with Heaven's full vengeance charged, That hideous one of calumny. CATILINE. And so 'Tis thus that Roscius shews his profound wisdom; Conscious suspicion ne'er can fall on him; The senate, the Dictator too condemning, Declares himself to-day the friend of faction, And comes, relying on the people's favour, Yea, rather adoration, to display The virtues of the stage here in the forum. ROSCIUS. The scornful words just utter'd, and which ne'er Before have stigmatized my name, are met By Sylla's favour and by Cato's friendship. In vain would Catiline pretend he knows not The sentiments he here has heard me broach. Plots I detest, and whosoe'er they be, The authors of themâbut I fear alike The contrary, and hate informers; with Disdain I see those hireling flatterers, Consular slaves, deck'd out in faded purple, Destroyers of their own all-hallowed altars, In turn to Marius and to Sylla cringe, Pursue a guiltless rival to his fate, And force him to become a base accomplice. CATILINE. I would not know what mean thy words, but leave Thy useless declamation its free course. Ready in all things to obey the nod Of Sylla whom I serve, I waste no time In scrutinizing what I should oppose; His interests alone I deem my right, Nor stop to weigh it in the scales of justice. What the Dictator wills is always just, Claudius is proscript, Claudius must be guilty. Thou wert thyself discovered in his house, Ere break of day, planning his secret flight, And hast, concealing his retreat, become Th'accomplice of his treason: but, mark well, It is my voice expounds the senate's fiatâ Answerâwhere is it Claudius bends his steps? ROSCIUS. Knew I but where myself, thou shouldst not know; And thy perplexing doubts have well repaid The injury thou hast done meâGo, denounce My silence to the senateâI consent to't. Tell them that Roscius, though the lictor's rod Hangs o'er him, still is ready to repeat Disgrace await th'informer! SCENE II. CATILINE, âAlone. Roscius, affect a haughty virtue; triumph In all thy scenic insolenceâfor not E'en Sylla's favour shall avail t'avert Thy footsteps from the snare thy friends have set. Or to thy gardens at Hersilia, At Arpinum, or Alba, hies the traitor Claudius, to seek for refuge;âbut in vain He flies my piercing ken; there's yet where I With greater certainty await my rival. The faithful servant of a hallowed temple, The framer of a plot, whose purchased zeal Is at my bidding, offers to my foe A refuge in that sacred spot; and if He is but seen there once, he dies. His crime Is proved against him, and the law, whose power The senate wields by the Dictator's arm, At distance opens an abyss, and I'll Compel him to the leap. SCENE III. CATILINE, FAUSTUS. FAUSTUS. Oh! Heavens! what, Catiline!... CATILINE. Must I believe That in this place, where now we've met, my presence Is painful to the eyes of Faustus; that His enmity in anger would repulse The friend, the guardian, pupil of his father? Faithful to aid his power, zealous to serve him, Rome learns from me th'example of obedience. I should be sorry to suppose my zeal, So faithful to his cause, should but receive As its reward the hatred of his son. FAUSTUS. Ah! if unceasing toils, exploits unheard of Can give the right to serve one's country, if In the excess of glory, Freedom dies, Then that sad victory is surely Sylla's: But thou, the shame of Rome, what claim hast thou That joined not in the fight, to rank thyself Amid this band of heroes? In what camp Were spent thy days of boyhood? answer me: Whose blood imbued thy sword? At peace with Greece, At peace with Germany, with Parthia too, Thy rage, but free from danger, slew the Romans. Struck by thy parricidal poniard fell The youthful Lepidus, and noble Marcus; Sure a most courteous murder:âPerished thus Beneath the blows of a young monster's arm, Our present glory, and our future hope. Nor could thy furious rage desist e'en there: Thy household altar own'd thy brother's death; In vain Night spread her curtain o'er thy crime, For Catiline himself confess'd the murder. Twice sacrilegious, in the fane of Vesta A brother's blood has dull'd the lustral wave. Such are thy claims to share a hero's honours, Such are the hideous labours of a senator, And such is Catiline.... CATILINE. Thy faithful memory Will doubtless call to mind, that at all seasons And in all places, what you term a crime Was done for Sylla, and avowed by him; And that, while Faustus so severely turns 'Gainst me his accusations, he but breathes Curses upon his father. Even now He bids the senate disannul a law On which depends the safety of the state. I go, the echo of his sovereign voice; And should it ere be deem'd by Faustus cruel, Or branded with my name, the only boon I ask, is, to enforce, myself in person, The law of the Dictator. SCENE IV. FAUSTUS, TEUCER a Mute. FAUSTUS. I know this law of blood and sacrilege, The privilege of which thou goest to seek... Then, ere it reach the ear of Claudius Let's realize the hope his heart has formed. He waits to see Valeria, and he here Can see her free from danger. (To the Mute.) Teucer, watch With care the precincts of the palace; and The moment Sylla leaves the senate, let A trusty messenger apprize me of it. SCENE V. FAUSTUS, VALERIA. VALERIA. Oh! Faustus, is it life or death awaits me? And Claudius?... FAUSTUS. He yet lives;âI know the place Of his retreat... VALERIA. Finish... FAUSTUS. Friendship has then Received thy husband 'neath her guardian roof. VALERIA. And I've accused thee 'mid my weight of sorrow!... I cannot doubt but that that friend's thyself. FAUSTUS. To whom else should he have recourse than me? What other dies disgraced if he survive not? VALERIA. Thy friendship does yet more, since it has bid Us meet againâI fear no more for him: Together we shall perishâTremblingly I count the precious moments.âOh! permit Me but to see him. FAUSTUS. He is in thy presence. SCENE VI. FAUSTUS, VALERIA, CLAUDIUS. Valeria, running up to Claudius, who appears under the Peristyle. VALERIA. O my dear Claudius! CLAUDIUS. Is it thou, Valeria?â All my past life's misfortunes are repaid By this one momentâit has all fulfill'd My bosom's fondest wishes. [To Faustus. To thy friendship Am I for all indebted. FAUSTUS. In it see The omen of a happier future; let Love, courage, and fidelity to-day Unite, and triumph o'er the frowns of fortune. But I, less favour'd far than you, must strive, Painful as is the task, to reconcile, Though my rebellious heart may murmur at it, The vows of friendship and the voice of nature. Proscripts and citizens! of all the evils 'Neath which you groan, the unjust author is, I own it, the Dictator; but the while I wish you to escape his cruel law, I should remember too he is my father, And that there is indeed a sacred duty Which bids my reverence for him oppose Itself to your despairâ'Tis not for me To reprimand his violence, but leave An open path which now my presence checks. VALERIA. How can we e'er repay thy benefits, My noble friend? FAUSTUS. Grant but a pardon to The author of thine ills. [Exit. SCENE VII. CLAUDIUS, VALERIA. CLAUDIUS. I then again behold thee, dear Valeria! But to what place has hostile fortune led thee? 'Tis the Dictator's palace! VALERIA. And what then? I see thee, and am sure of dying with thee. CLAUDIUS. Bring not that fearful image to afflict me. VALERIA. It should sustain, should animate thy courage. Oh! if the Gods have fixed thy term of life, Tell me where 'tis on earth I must seek succour? Of which of thy fell murderers must I ask With suppliant voice thy blood-stain'd corse; and in Despair, my tears disgracing, sad implore The honours of a solitary pyre? CLAUDIUS. Ah! can I, without shudd'ring, think that Hymen Has with his silken bonds imposed on thee A proscript's destiny: thou, whom thy name, Thy virtues, ancestryâhad called to such Exalted greatness, were we now, as once, In our bright days of glory! VALERIA. 'Tis my wish, Tiberius' sister, and Cornelia's daughter, T'adore my country in my spouse. And Claudius, When Rome loud clanks the chains of slavery, Seems in my eyes, though proscript, greater far Than Sylla, lord of the whole universe. Nothing remains to wish for; I have found In thee the ardour that hath roused, the hate That hath inflamed me. Let us cease all vain Debates 'bout life and death; has fate but left This one last day? then by a term so short, Bounding our hopes, let's strive e'en yet to find In it the hour of vengeance. CLAUDIUS. I've revolved Within my breast the noble thought: and oh! Were I but free a day, success were certain. VALERIA. Nor are we without friends, who, like ourselves, In the same cause devote their lives: Aufidius And LÃ¦nas follow in my footsteps; dress'd As slaves they wait the moment...But I see them. SCENE VIII. The same,âand Aufidius and LÃ¦nas, habited as Slaves. CLAUDIUS. Ye Gods! AUFIDIUS. Claudius yet lives... CLAUDIUS. Though favouring Heaven Grants me to see you in this fatal palace, Yet are our moments number'd, nor is't fit That they be lost to us; yes, brave Aufidius, And LÃ¦nas, most implacable of foes, You see what evils press upon our country. Already the republic breathes its last, And faded is its glory; Rome herself, The widow of her people, sorrowing sees E'en now the bloody laurel stain her coffin. The Arab wanders o'er his burning sands, The wild beasts of the forest have their caves, While, Romans, you, by a strange destiny The world you rule refuses you a tomb! One man alone, amid a universe Of slaves, is free. LÃNAS. No, my dear Claudius, There breathes e'en yet upon the Tiber's banks One virtuous mortal far more free than Sylla. VALERIA. The man who knows to die. LÃNAS. The man who dares To strike the tyrant. CLAUDIUS. If my friends but aid My courage in th'attemptâbehold him here! You are aware of my design; to-morrow, As is the custom, the Dictator offers A sacrifice to the Godsâon those new altars He bore away, the spoils of ravished Greece, He goes t'invoke the favour of the Goddess, To aid the evil destiny of Rome. To that same temple, soon as night comes on, I bend my steps: the pontiff's self in secret Will introduce meâIn the deep recess Of that all-hallowed sanctuary, I'll wait The coming of the tyrantâto his words Of blood I will myself reply, and in The presence of the Oracle itself, And him, its instrument of fate, rush forth, And, aided by the cry of Liberty, Pierce his heart's inmost core. AUFIDIUS. In this so bold A project never shall my zeal be wanting. VALERIA. And I will bring with me a faithful people. AUFIDIUS. Roused by the name of Marius, be it mine To arm the hands of our plebeian friends. VALERIA. We have a party, too, 'mong the patricians: And the young Cesar, if I'm not deceived, Will hold for us one half the troops of Pompey. CLAUDIUS. That is our every hope...but LÃ¦nas speaks not; Approves he not of a so noble project? LÃNAS. And 'tis in such a spot you frame your plans; Dispose of time when scarce an hour's your own; How great a mystery must needs enshroud them! What obstacles give way before we strike! While yet far off you seek the hope of vengeance, Beneath your eyes the victim waits the blow: Why then, 'mid dangers which may yet be thwarted, Risk a success which you are sure is certain? Your country asks a victim at your hands, And fate gives you the power to offer it. This palace, thanks to Faustus, to your steps Is ever openâIt is here at night Veiled 'neath her shades, alone, the tyrant comes (Save the dark train of fear and sad remorse) To meditate upon the crimes of Rome. 'Tis here, beneath your arm, he ought to perishâ Here expiate his guilt, here fall. CLAUDIUS. No, never! Who, I? Shall I abuse a privilege Most sacred! sullying with blood the roof That gives me its protection! Sylla, whilst Within th'inclosure of these walls, holds pledged My honour for his safety; and whilst here, His life, though hateful, still for me is sacred. How would fair friendship's virtues be repaid! âAccepted the son's gifts but to destroy The parent! LÃNAS. To dethrone a tyrantâto Avenge thy country... CLAUDIUS. At the very hearth At which his son's received me? VALERIA. To thy words My heart gives back an echo; yes, let's save Our country, but oh! not by perfidy. Let Sylla at the temple meet his death, And that in open day too. CLAUDIUS. The high priest To-morrow will admit me there. LÃNAS. To-morrow! Will that be soon enough? thou know'st the law, The infamous Licinian law! the senate E'en now proclaim it; death, immediate death Awaits whoever may retard its course By sheltering a proscript. Friendship's roof Is trampled in the dust: nor one alone, But all partake alike the common ruin. CLAUDIUS. Is it so, LÃ¦nas? I must then away! Let's part; I go. VALERIA. Oh Heavens! what, at this hour! Would you perfect then a design so sad! You perish if you quit us. CLAUDIUS. Faustus dies If I remain. LÃNAS. The law of the Dictator Will not include his son. CLAUDIUS. His son himself Was number'd 'mong the proscripts; let's begone. VALERIA. O Faustus, Faustus, I invoke thy presence! SCENE IX. CLAUDIUS, VALERIA, FAUSTUS. FAUSTUS. I come. VALERIA. He would begone. FAUSTUS. Oh! Heavens, what madness! Where wouldst thou go, unfortunate? Thou know'st What fate awaits thee; leave these walls and death That moment meets theeâtarry here awhile As thou hast promised. CLAUDIUS. I abjure my promise: It will expose thy life. FAUSTUS. Who told thee that?... CLAUDIUS. All, I know all. FAUSTUS, (withholding him.) Thou shalt not go. CLAUDIUS. I oughtâ I wish it. FAUSTUS. Go, then, I attend thy steps. Thou tell'st me of the lawâI will accept Its justiceâcome, denounce my crime, betray Me thine accomplice. CLAUDIUS. Cruel friend, that word Enchains me to the spot. VALERIA. To-night, the templeâ FAUSTUS. Sylla returns... CLAUDIUS. Farewell. [To Valeria.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. CATILINE, BALBUS. CATILINE. 'Tis you; well, and what says the high-priest, Balbus? Has Claudius yet dared to approach the temple? BALBUS. The high-priest sides with us, the net is spread; Yet still the proscript hides him from thy vengeance, Vainly expected at the temple's porch. CATILINE. Run to his freed-man, Sergius; seize his person, Apply the torture, till th'extorted secret Reveals th'asylum that conceals his master: Yet fear I lest his courage brave the torture. I know he is ambitious; offer him The QuÃ¦storship. Keep an eye too on Roscius, Mark well his every step; and seek meanwhile Again to trace out LÃ¦nas, while I here Await the coming of Valeria. SCENE II. CATILINE, âAlone. And so it is to me that the Dictator Entrusts to-day the office and the power Of seeing that the law is executed: And I will use that power, ay, e'en beyond His orders. It is she! SCENE III. CATILINE, VALERIA led along by a Lictor. VALERIA. Dragged hither by thine order, what new crime Have I committed, that I see myself Condemned to undergo thy presence, and To suffer the affront I deem one look Of thine imprints upon my forehead? CATILINE. Do me More justice, and control thy hatred. Claudius Has been found guilty, and his death is certain: E'en now I see him in his dark retreat, The framer, leader of an odious treason. VALERIA. Think'st thou to throw me off my guard by such Bye-ways as these? my secret is mine own. CATILINE. Stay, hear me yet, and thou shalt know ere long, If rightly I'm informed. Shall I point out The very temple where thy Claudius goes, To offer up his sacrifices at The shrine of Fortune? shall I point out all His hopes, his vows, and his accomplices? And if there's need of witnesses, will't not Suffice to call on Roscius, or to question LÃ¦nas? VALERIA. LÃ¦nas!... CATILINE. Come, calm thy flurried soul: I know all, can do all...Hear me, Valeriaâ I have my rival's life within my grasp; The lictors, all-prepared, await my signal. I cannot but remember that Valeria, Scorning my passion, is become the wife Of low-born Claudius; and that she has thus Blasted the hope of an illustrious house: And that when I remove a husband so Unworthy of her, I do but avenge Sylla and Rome, thy glory, and myself. But at thy word too I can also banish Far from my breast the cruel memory Of that which fed my fury; I can yet O'er Claudius, whom long punishment awaits, Extend henceforward a protecting arm: And soon, perchance, surpassing all his hopes, Call him to honours, raise him up to power. VALERIA. What price sets Catiline upon his mercy? CATILINE. You must, abjuring Claudius and your marriage... VALERIA. Hold there, unhappy man! who'll e'er believe it? Thou, who dost reckon by thy crimes thy daysâ Thou, the assassin of thy brotherâthou, Foe to thy country's Gods, detested framer Of all our miseries,âis it thou, whose madness, Twin-brother to thy fury, comes t'unveil The horror of some new-coined crime! But know That I hold Claudius dearer far than life, And dearer yet my country; and that far From e'er consenting to another marriage, Fertile in every horror, to preserve Our two poor lives, they should be sacrificed; If it were only that my gratitude To thy crime-'stablished power owed their deliverance: If but my thoughts, perforce betraying me, Must e'er renounce their right of open hatred. I know alone th'inviolable spot That offers a retreat to Claudius; And I alone am guilty. Whether he Conceives a project to the which my heart Will lend its every aid, or whether in His powerless rage does Catiline denounce To the Dictator plots himself has framed, Matters not now: Claudius has nought yet form'd Save vows, but I am able to perfect His noble plans. Thus, Catiline, thou seest Thy fatal cunning ne'er can 'vail to shake The fix'd soul of Valeria. [She goes out. CATILINE. Go, enjoy The sweets of thy proud triumph,âthou hast come To set the last seal to thy husband's fate. SCENE IV. CATILINE, SYLLA, FAUSTUS, CATULUS, BALBUS. BALBUS. It is too true; his sacrilegious hand Has framed perfidious in the sacred temple A parricidal plot. The priest himself Has been before you, and his eager zeal Answers for his fidelity. CATILINE. Claudius Is proscript, and ere long will expiate The crime his impious fury has inflamed. But of a greater crime do I accuse The Roman who conceals from punishment An infamous assassinâbut I know him... SYLLA. Curse on the traitor who would shield a parricideâ Would shelter Claudius. But, speak, Catiline; What Roman is it that has given to-day Support to that conspirator? CATILINE. I name, Though with regret yet with assurance, one, One too thy noble confidence has honour'd; 'Tis Roscius.â FAUSTUS. Heavens! what say'st thou? SYLLA. Roscius!... CATILINE. I have seen Claudius in the gardens of Hersilia, and Valeria too was with him. 'Twas by surprise I took them, and he feign'd Denial of his perfidy;âbut vainly... FAUSTUS. One single word be mine to justify him; But 'tis to none but Sylla I would trust The weighty secret: he alone should know it. SYLLA. Leave us, senators. [They go out. SCENE V. SYLLA, FAUSTUS. SYLLA. What is the traitor's name? Oh! fix the doubts that agitate my mind. When I must punish, 'tis sufficient there Exists cause of suspicionâand the bolt, Hurled forth unaimed, might strike more heads than one. With whom has Claudius dared to brave my law? Name himâI'd know who has received him. FAUSTUS. I. SYLLA. What hear I? Faustus, thou betray thy father! FAUSTUS. I neither wish to calm, nor brave thine anger: Yet only hear me with some little pity. Thy heart so proud, so noble, has known friendship, And 'tis that generous feeling that now binds me To Claudius; the decree of the Dictator, In making his life forfeit, does but aid The fiendish projects of a cruel foe. Unconscious of the danger friendship wept, Claudius came hither ere the dawn of day; He trembles for my life, and friendship strives To drag him from the horrible abyss He has plunged into; he returns no more To dry the tear that dims Valeria's eye: Alarm sits brooding o'er his household hearth; Stern Catiline pursues, and lost is hope. Friendship commanded me to save his life, And I have done my duty; yet not less I to thy sovereign order bow me downâ Go, seize on Claudius. SYLLA. Where? FAUSTUS. In thine own palace. SYLLA. Unhappy man! FAUSTUS. Traitor to friendship, I Indeed am so! The law which punishes, Will see me justified; can I complain Of its severity, when the same blow Must fall on both alike? SYLLA. And are, then, these The noble, generous designs of Faustus? He fears lest Sylla should escape th'assassins, E'en whilst the steel is bared to pierce his bosom. FAUSTUS. No, thou dost not believe it; the suspicion Of such a crime as that can never rest Upon a heart like mine. My father knows And judges too well of me to demand That I should justify myself before him. I see with grief the ills my country suffers; Son of the favour'd Sylla, the world's ruler, 'Tis I that bear the whole weight of our chains. But still if Liberty, by thee opprest, Bids my soul feel a generous regret, She weakens not a yet more sacred dutyâ A sweeter feeling, by Heaven's self inspired. 'Twixt Rome and Sylla, Nature lights my path; My oath to Rome is due, my life to Sylla. SYLLA. Yet is a proscript armed against my life, And Faustus, my son Faustus 'tis, protects him! Know'st thou what punishment awaits thy boldness? Know'st thou the law falls also on thy head, And asks, inflexible, thy life as forfeit? That the decree is fixed and I've pronounced it? FAUSTUS. I shall know how to bear it; and 'tis fit (To justify thy words) that I should feel Its extreme rigour. SYLLA. I but see in thee The hateful 'complice of a false assassinâ Of an audacious traitor. FAUSTUS. Catiline Asserts, and Sylla must perforce believe, it. Glory, I know, is loved too well by Claudius; And if he does hate the Dictator, still Bound to me by the favours I have granted, I to that hatred have opposed the rights Of friendship: urged on all sides by despair, His soul had else conceived some mighty project. Thy power is hateful to the Romans, Sylla: Yes, it excites all hearts, and arms all hands. But yet if e'er should beam the day of vengeance, It shall still see me fighting by thy side; Hear then the vows a son has made, and pity.... SYLLA. Hence, and bid Claudius come before me. [Faustus exit. SCENE VI. SYLLA, âAlone. 'Mid the confusion of the hurried feelings That swallow up my soul, I dare not ask Myself the question, what desires inflame me? Lavish of blood in sacrificing Faustus, Owe I to Rome th'example of a Brutus? What say I?âit was Rome, it was his country That asked the god-like sacrifice of Brutus; And that decree himself adjudged, though cruel, Based on their blood-stained tomb the fane of Freedom: Faustus would march to death as its defender!... Oh! how can such a sacrifice aid me? What equal benefit expect I from it? The Romans are unworthy of my blood. Vile slaves!âsuppose then, from the haughty height Where Rome now sees me, I should fill the world With mute astonishment, by an example Yet nobler; and, spite of mine anger, force Posterity to breathe upon my name An immortality!âI'll think of it.... SCENE VII. SYLLA, CLAUDIUS, FAUSTUS. Sylla makes a signal to Faustus to withdraw, who, with much inquietude, retires to a distance, after having embraced his friend. FAUSTUS, (to CLAUDIUS.) It is in you that I confide. CLAUDIUS. You know me.... SYLLA. Approach;âadmitted to my presence, vainly Thou seek'st to hide the trouble of thy soul. CLAUDIUS. Sylla, thou dost mistake me: my sole trouble Arises but from horror. SYLLA. What can cause it, Unless that infamous hope which a false virtue Engenders in thy mind. Am I not Sylla? And art thou not still Claudius, grandson of That same Sulpicius, coward tribune, who, The leader of a frantic populace, Stained the Republic with so many crimes?... And yet you live. Whether in pride, or pity T'wards you, I threw aside my just resentment, And with due reverence to the ties of youth, Allowed my son to shield from me thy folly; And lastly, when I heard that my base foes Had found, in Claudius found, a willing 'complice, And ought to have repented my excess Of mercy, I restrained my vengeance And only sought thy banishmentâI offer'd Protection to thy flight, and e'en the law, Deaf to all else, was soften'd down for thee.â But Claudius' soul, methinks, disdains a favour That binds him to the donorâyes, a heart Like thine obeys no lord but its own hatred. False to a friendship which unites its lot With thine, thou dost conspire to take the lifeâ Of whom?âof him the father of thy friend. Had thy presuming boldness dared, indeed, In open day, amid th'assembled crowd To have fulfilled thy threat, it had methinks Smacked somewhat of the heroâbut to stain, And with my blood, the roof that gave thee shelter, To which, with culpable imprudence, Friendship Had led theeâto associate my son In thy dark scheme of parricide; and, that The blow might be more sure as more unmanly, Glide like a vile assassin through my palace! Thy crime's all worthy of thy hateful race. Well, why delay'st thou? the time serves thy purposeâ Strike, I'm alone; fulfil thee thy designâ But may be Faustus has disarmed thy hand: Here, take this dagger. [Offering one. CLAUDIUS. I admire thy courage: But, Sylla, if I do not wish to take Advantage of the momentâif I grant A sad delay to what I wishâ'tis not, 'Tis not, you see, because a weapon's wanting. [Shewing a dagger under his robe. Thy son, who knows me well, here by my side All tranquil, was himself the very cause Thy death was thus deferr'd, by offering me This place as an asylum. SYLLA. So then, Claudius, Thou dost not deign to offer a defence Touching this foolish plot.... CLAUDIUS. I've wished thy death; Ay, and I wish it yet. SYLLA. 'Tis well: but if My clemency should lean to less severe And more indulgent counsel, and should spare Thy life!... CLAUDIUS. Thou wouldst but render me an ingrate. I should remain still faithful to my hatred, Still faithful to the state. How will it aid thee This tardy kindness? twice five hundred arms Are raised to strike thy heartâand Rome, though captive, Will let thee live no longer free and fearless; Noânot while life beats in another's pulse And bids thine likewise throb.âBethink thee of PrÃ¦neste: how, too, at thy dread command A nation fell, e'en as it were one mortal! Thy horrible proscriptions, writ in blood, Have stampt thy name to immortality. Obey thy summonsâmurderer of my country! Nor by preserving me betray thy glory! SYLLA. Thou bidd'st me be again myself, again Indulge my fury; fear me, coward Romans, Fear if I live, and tremble if I die! And hero, thou who burn'st with insolence To meet thy fit reward, thou shalt indeed Be satisfied. CLAUDIUS. Thou hast fulfill'd my wishes; Thy death or mine is all that I would ask. [Sylla calls outâthe Lictors enter. SYLLA. Lictors! watch well each point, keep fast the gates, And let the cohorts of my guard be doubled. Let none to-night depart from forth the palaceâ Not Faustus 'self, unless 'tis by my order, And follow close upon the heels of Claudius. [To Claudius. Go, tell th'accomplice in thy guilt, thyself Hast pointed out thine hour of punishment. Claudius, (returning into the interior of the Palace.) Sylla, adieu! I go...look well around thee! E'en though I march to death, I leave thee far Th'unhappier of the two. SCENE VIII. SYLLA, âAlone. Unhappy, said he! 'Tis true....I am so...and is this to live, To undergo these torments of my greatness? To punish, to shed blood, to stifle treasons... No sleep by night, and no repose by day!â My mind, for ever led away by sad Forebodings, like a timid infant, fears The shades of night!...I'll rest me 'neath this porch;â More calm methinks I'll here await, till morn Beams in the eastern sky...Oh! could I sleep!â Yet whence this weakness? For my son I tremble. Vain fears, away!âmy tenderness shall ne'er Disarm th'unyielding courage of my soul. I am a father, say'st thou? NoâI am Dictator; and for what! to march for ever From crime to crimeâAh! I indeed am tired Of living on the edge of such a precipice! I wishâbut they will kill me.âWhat, all mighty, All glorious as I am, what of the Gods Henceforward can I ask?âthat peace of death To which I sometimes look, that boundary of My ills, that end of this long, long delirium. To die, perchance to sleep!âwhat are to me Days whose whole course is one empoison'd tÃ¦dium? But I perceive my soul, at length less heavy, Allows my thoughts to wander unrestrained. [He lies down. O unknown blessing! both alike sink down, O'ercome by gentle sleep, my eyesâmy spirits. [He falls asleep, and whilst dreaming, cries out. What see I? and what power, in these dark chambers Reanimates the shades of those my proscripts? Spirits of the tomb! what would ye have with me? Is it to me your grizzly band holds forth The torches of the tomb? Your crimes I've punish'd, Th'associates of your crimes! and tremble yet Lest I conduct you to fresh punishments!â I see you allâyour arms raised o'er my couchâ Th'uplifted poniard brandished o'er my breast, As if prepared to strikeâOh! Heavens! here, lictors! [He rises up in his sleep. HereâI've proscribed their heads.âDo I again Behold them? Chase them hence, these perverse phantoms! With blood-stained whips hence drive them back to Pluto! 'Tis Sylla willsâcommands itâquick, obey! [He falls down again on the couch. SCENE IX. SYLLA, FAUSTUS, Guards. FAUSTUS. [Running up to him. My father! SYLLA. Who's that? what would'st thou? who is he so rash As to disturb my slumbers? FAUSTUS. Cries not far.... SYLLA. I called not...but where am I? is it thou! Hast dared without my orders to come hither! You wake me, FaustusâI resume my power; Resume the wonted empire o'er my heart: Come then, let's finish what I have resolved, For I can live no longer in this sad Uncertaintyâthere but remains one effort That can avail to tame the haughty foes Which this day brings before meâthen let's see Which can the most prevail, Sylla, or they. Be ready, guards;âOfella, bid the people, Army, and senate, here alike assemble; And, since they wish to learn their destinies, Await my sovereign orders in the Forum.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Stage represents the Forum, on one side of which are placed the Rostra and Tribunal to speak from. Groups of the Populace line the back part of the Stage, and Soldiers occupy the openings. CATILINE, BALBUS, on the front of the Stage. CATILINE. We triumph, Balbus; the approaching dawn Will see me freed from a detested rival; The constancy of Fortune's e'en surpass'd My wishes. Sylla has done more than I Had hoped forâhe gives up to us his son: Nay more, avenges on him too the laws The highest majesty of which he's outraged. The palace opens at the prÃ¦tor's orders; I would direct his steps; if Claudius there Be found, his friend by his sole presence stands Accused, and both must meet the law alike. Claudius and Faustus both must seek the Forum, And Sylla's voice will there pronounce their doom. BALBUS. Think'st thou his pride, e'en to his love of power, Will ever sacrifice a life so cherished? And that the blood of Claudius be allowed To swell the life-stream of a son, pour'd out Before a father's eyes? CATILINE. 'Twill e'en be so: Trust me his punishment is near; the axe Hangs o'er his head, accomplice of a proscript; And this vast preparation, which himself Ordain'd, sufficiently denotes the stern Decree that Sylla is about to issue: But see, the people from all sides advance! BALBUS. And feel'st thou nought of fear from their deep silence? Let us avoid the first burst of their fury; LÃ¦nas is with themâ [Retires to the back part of the Stage. We'll rejoin our troops. SCENE II. AUFIDIUS, LÃNAS, VALERIA, People. AUFIDIUS. What mean these preparations? are they made To give us warning that affrighted Rome Reels on the verge of ruin? Pompey's troops Surround the Forum, and the people run T'interrogate the oracle of Antiumâ VALERIA. What fear ye, Romans? is there yet a plague Our country has not known from Sylla's fury? Beat but your hearts in unison with mine, This day would see the last of Sylla's crimes. Say, are ye weary of your chains? ashamed Of thus degrading Rome's fair majesty, To meet at last but an ignoble death? Behold, I offer you my arm to punish The tyrant. When my country dies, 'tis fit I should no longer live; but yet, O grant That my last breath revive the flowers of Freedom! Here, in this very palace where I 'wait My husband, my two brothers died for you; Envying their fate I feel I owe my country What of the generous blood may yet remain That ran all-taintless through Cornelia's veins: Would ye but second me, to-day, e'en here Should it be shed in sacrificing Sylla. AUFIDIUS (aside to VALERIA). How would so bold a measure aught avail thee? How could'st thou open for thyself a passage? Amid such hosts of warriors, victor slaves, Such bands of lictors, crowds of courtiers, Nought but the bolt of Heaven can surely strike him. Then let us wait awhile, and curb our anger: Let's hate, but hate in silence. VALERIA. From the left What crowd moves onwards hither? it is he!â It is my husband.âHeaven, accept my thanks! We are again united. SCENE III. The same,âFAUSTUS, CLAUDIUS. Faustus and Claudius advance, surrounded by Lictors, who compel LÃ¦nas to remove to a distance from Claudius, whom, it would seem, he wishes to approach. CLAUDIUS to VALERIA. Oh! cruel Fortune! all that I hold dear Enchains itself to my sad destiny. VALERIA. Whence comes it that my presence thus afflicts My husband, when his gives me most delight? FAUSTUS to CLAUDIUS. Look on that crowd, my friend, 'tis us they gaze on; They wait from us a memorable example;â We shall know how to give it. CLAUDIUS. Faustus! what Must thou too share my fate? FAUSTUS. Have I done less To merit death than thou? victim, like thee, Of a tyrannic law, for the Republic We both shall perish; sure that both alike Will share thy fate, I bless it. Thou had'st raised Thine arm to strikeâit checks the blow, and thus Saves me the horror in my latest hour Of hating thee, the murderer of my father. Nature already had accused my heart Of partial friendship; but we die together, The crime is expiate. CLAUDIUS. Faustus, you can live To aid your country yet. FAUSTUS. I cannot save her, But she shall have my life. CLAUDIUS. Oh! pardon me That one remembrance still must mix its griefs, And dim the glorious sun of my last moments. [To Valeria. O thou, the sovereign mistress of my fate! Valeria, love! VALERIA. Valeria's soul is Roman:â More, she's the wife of Claudius, nor unworthy Of her high ancestry; she, who with cheek Unpaled, has listen'd to thy last farewell, Knows, like thyselfâwell knows, with brow unchang'd T'await th'inevitable shaft of death. CLAUDIUS. What shouts are those? SCENE IV. The same,âSylla, Metellus, Roscius, train of Soldiers, Lictors, Priests, and People. People. There see him! see him! health to the Dictator! The godlike Sylla! [Sylla slowly advances into the middle of the crowd. VALERIA, (aside.) Oh! most perfect baseness, Oh! horrid sacrilege! [She rushes forward and endeavours to strike Sylla; Roscius prevents her. Die, tyrant! CLAUDIUS. Strike! FAUSTUS. [Making a movement as if to fly to the assistance of his Father. Hold there! SYLLA, (coolly to his followers.) Remove that womanâI come here T'avenge the laws, the Romans, and the state: She would have frighten'd many from pursuing The course I've taken.âThe worst of criminals Challenge my justiceâone of them is Claudius, The other is my son; they have betrayed The laws, and from this moment are become Alike in crime and punishment united. I make no use of my high power against them, The people shall themselves pronounce their fate. BALBUS, (aside, to CATILINE.) Do'st hear? CATILINE. Fear nothing, 'tis a specious pretext; The people ne'er have yet preserved their guardians. SYLLA. [Mounting the tribunal and seating himself, whilst the Lictors and Soldiers surround it. Romans, this glorious day will shew the world Whether the office of Dictator's been Conferr'd on one not all unworthy of it; And whether such a train of ills, which he To-day prepares to crown, have render'd you Worthy of him alike too. ROSCIUS, (aside.) Gracious Heaven! What means the promise of this lofty language! CATILINE, (aside to BALBUS.) Thou seest how dark a horror clouds his features;â Darting its stern decree around in silence, His eye has marked, has chosen out its victim. METELLUS. Sylla, at thy command th'assembled tribes Have taken each their seat around the Forum. SYLLA, (standing up on the Rostrum.) Knights, citizens, pontiffs, and senators, And you, illustrious guardians of your country, Hear me!âI owe it to myself, to you To render an account how I have used My high authority; and to lay open To your astonished view, how difficult, How vast the labours I have undertaken. The Pontus, Bosphorus, Epirus, bow Beneath our yokeâthe streams of Phalaris Canal our empireâto our laws submiss Is found the whole of Greece; and Lybia's kings Have fled before my power.âThe fall of Carthage Had shaken Rome to her foundationsâI Repair'd the evils an illustrious warrior Had brought upon herâvanquished was Jugurtha, O'erthrown was MithridatesâDestiny Exceeded Fortune's fairest, brightest promise. The laurel-wreath of war I deemed too trifling, I sought a rarer and a dearer glory: Rome had become to party rage a prey, Prostrate beneath the blows of her own children; She call'd my genius and my arm to aid herâ I rose Dictatorâand I saved my country; Restored the Senate to its ancient rights, And a rebellious people to their duty. Slave of the vulgar, you have ne'er beheld me Court and betray their favour; the sole aim Of all the toils of MariusâI've but little Flatter'd the people, yet I've cured their ills: My rigorous measures were legitimate, And all my victims to preserve the state. What I have done for Liberty and Rome May be termed violence, nay cruelty: But such a base reproach should not confound me. I stand prepared to answer for the blood That I have spiltâyes, if I e'er have stifled The voice of nature, of humanity, 'Twas but t'enforce obedience to the laws. With what sur-name posterity will brand me In History, I know notâshe will judge What Rome examines.âI come here to break A yoke which galls us bothâI feel the weight Of my proud greatness, far more than ye feel it. I've conquer'd, reign'd,âbut yet I still would live! I hurl away th'intoxicating cup Of power. According to my sovereign will I've swayed the world, and of mine enemies Silence is all I ask; in vain their hatred Would strive to reach my memory; I've placed Betwixt myself and them a wide abyssâ That of my glory.âThe Dictator is No moreâI give my power up to the Senate; Theirs are the reins of empire. Yet, yet hear me! Let my voice fill th'assembly;âwithout fear I've govern'd, without fear I abdicate. People. Oh! lofty courage! superhuman greatness! SYLLA. I give you back your consuls; choose them, Romans, [Metellus goes out. My safeguard is, they say, that I'm Dictator; WellâI e'en now abjure it here before you, [He lays aside his purple cloak, and throws away the golden palm, the symbol of the Dictatorship. And cast aside the purpleâlictors, hence! [They lay down their symbols of office, and intermix with the populace. See me unarm'd! I offer you my life. To plots, to poniards, I oppose my genius, A Brutus' virtue, and a Scipio's soul; Add Cheroneus, Orchomenes, and The terror of my name; my fortune, glory, Are now become the senate's: but let Sylla Be ever present to their memory! The conqueror of Marius, I've surpass'd him, And have acquired the rank in which I'm placed. Romans, I break the bonds of your obedience, But I would still claim your remembrances; Though the Dictatorship may be another's, Stripp'd of my power, I still am always Sylla. [He descends from the tribunal. ROSCIUS. Rome hitherto but own'd him as her master; The world to-day proclaims him as the first Of mortals. FAUSTUS. Oh! my father, at thy kneesâ SYLLA. I have no power. BALBUS, to CATILINE. Where will be now our safety? CLAUDIUS. I've still one hope; he's pointed out the path And I may one day profit by the lesson Of such a master. SYLLA. It is fit we end This bloody struggle; you are tired of fearing, And I of punishing: a citizen, One of yourselves, beneath the common law, Sternly have I laid down my pride of fortune; And each may now henceforward, free from fear, [To Valeria, approaching her. Approach, complain, and be revenged upon me. VALERIA. Of crimes, of virtues, O appalling union! My hatred's conquer'd, and my courage broken; Ashamed of favours but too dearly purchased When the oblivion of thy crimes 's the price, I fear, and I admire thee! CLAUDIUS, to SYLLA. Not till now Has thy magnanimous soul o'er us acquired A lawful power. METELLUS, entering. Of the assembled people The different tribes have for their consuls named Faustus and Claudius. SYLLA. Behold, I now Perfect a glorious work, a glorious destiny; I've marked my passage through th'astonished world; And, Romans, when posterity receives My name, oh! never let me be reproached For having giv'n you back your liberty! THE END.</field>
