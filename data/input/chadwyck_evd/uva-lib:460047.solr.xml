      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The Importunity of some Friends, whom I could by no means disobey, has drawn from me the Publication of this Piece at a Disadvantage. They profess an Inclination to read sedately what, they are so kind to say, pleas'd them two Years ago in the Representation. But such was its Fate then, that, appearing at a Season when the Weather was warm, and the Town in a political Ferment, it was prais'd and forsaken; and I had this choice Comfort left me, of hearing every body wonder that it was not supportea. Since that Time, the Actors, who perform'd in it, have divided themselves, so it could not be reviv'd: Whether any Theatre may think it worth that Trouble hereafter, I will not take upon me to determine. Tho' I call'd it The Fatal Secret, I had no Intentions of disguising from the Publick, that, (as my Friend has confess'd for me in the Prologue) John Webster had preceded me, above a hundred Years ago, in the same Story. I have retain'd the Names of the Characters in his Dutchess of Malfy, adopted as much of his Tale as I conceiv'd for my Purpose, and as much of his Writing as I could turn to Account without giving into too obsolete a Diction. If I have borrow'd his Matter freely, I have taken it up on fair and open Credit; and, hope, I have repaid the Principal with Interest. I have no where spared my self, out of Indolence; but have often engrafted his Thoughts and Language, because I was conscious I could not so well supply them from my own Fund. When I first read his Scenes, I found something singularly engaging in the Passions, a mixture of the Masculine, and the Tender, which induced me to think of modernizing them: Another Motive was, that the Distress of the Tale is not fictitious, but founded on authentick Record. And, besides the Historians of Naples, Goulart has given this Story a place in his Histoires Admirables de notre Temps; the Italian, Bandello, has work'd it up into one of his Novels; and Lopez de Vega brought it upon the Spanish Stage, under the Title of El Mayordomo de la Duquesa de Amalfi. I was in hopes to have glean'd something noble, and sprightly, from the Spanish Poet; but, to my Mortification, was heavily disappointed. There was but a single Thought, if I remember, that I could wish to have transplanted from his whole Play. Antonio standing confus'd to find himself alone with the Dutchess in her Bedchamber, and she enquiring into the Reason of his Disorder, he replies: Si corriendo una cortina Un Angel se descubriesse, No era justo que temiesse Ver su figura divina? But besides that I could not employ it, as I have conducted the Story, Mr. Dryden seems in a manner to have translated the Thought in the Spanish Fryar. When we behold an Angel, not to fear, Is to be impudent. Another great Discouragement, why I could make no use of the Spaniard, was, that he is so absurd in his Scenary, and Incidents. To give but one Instance; he closes with a Piece of Cookery, as extraordinary as it is shocking. Antonio and his Infants are decoy'd into the Hands of the Duke of Calabria, by a Wile; the Dutchess is likewise betray'd home, under the Colour of being reconcil'd to her cruel Brothers, and an Expectation of seeing her Husband: when the Scene draws and discovers a Table spread and cover'd with three Dishes, the Head of Antonio lying in the middle one, and the Heads of the Children in the two Side-Dishes. Quodcunque ostendis mihisic, incredulus odi. As to our Countryman Webster, tho' I am to confess Obligations to him, I am not oblig'd to be blind to all his Faults. He is not without his Incidents of Horror, almost as extravagant as those of the Spaniard. He had a strong and impetuous Genius, but withal a most wild, and indigested one: He sometimes conceived nobly, but did not always express with Clearness; and if he now and then soars handsomly, he as often rises into the Region of Bombast: his Conceptions were so eccentric, that we are not to wonder why we cannot ever trace him. As for Rules, he either knew them not, or thought them too servile a Restraint. Hence it is, that he skips over Years and Kingdoms with an equal Liberty. (It must be confess'd, the Unities were very sparingly observ'd at the Time in which he wrote; however, when any Poet travels so fast, that the Imagination of his Spectators cannot keep pace with him, Probability is put quite out of Breath.) Nor has he been less licentious in another Respect: He makes mention of Galilæo and Tasso, neither of whom were born till near half a Century after the Dutchess of Malfy was murther'd. Having been so free in characterizing the Old Bard, I may reasonably expect an Inquisition into my own Performance: But I am willing to be beforehand with Censurers, and allow all the Faults they shall think fit to impute to it. What I have done is submitted to Examination, and I'll spare my self the Odium of marking it out. If the Piece has any Praise, it is, in my Opinion, that it had Power to draw Tears from fair Eyes. The Poet, who writes for the Stage, should principally aim at pleasing his female Judges: for the best Proof, whether he can draw a Distress, is, how far their Nature and Virtues are touch'd with his Portrait.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, Written by Philip Frowde, Esq; An ancient Bard, a Century ago, Chose out this Tale of soft, pathetick, Woe. Then, as they say, Beaus could Attention keep; And injur'd Virtue force the Fair to weep. He, who could stir the Passions, knew no Fears; Sincere Applause still crown'd him in their Tears. To-Night's Advent'rer the same Pow'rs would shew, And tries his Strength in Webster's nervous Bow. Why should he then despair, since this his Aim? Nature should be in every Age the same. But now 'twere Just our Author's Debt to state To his old Friend;—then, leave him to his Fate. A waste, uncultivated, Soil he found O'er-run with Weeds; yet in the fertile Ground Some Flowers, almost impervious to the View, Fragrant and Fair, irregularly grew. These was the Modern's Labour to display In comely Order, open'd to the Day: With decent Grace arrang'd before your Eyes, He bids them in their genuine Lustre rise. The rude, old Bard, if Critick Laws he knew, From a too warm Imagination drew; And scorning, Rule should his free Soul confine, Nor Time, nor Place, observ'd in his Design. This Wild Luxuriance our Chaste Muse restrains, Binds him indeed, but 'tis with friendly Chains; Such as the prudent Parent, soft and mild, Tho' griev'd, yet forc'd, puts on a Frantick Child. If yet some Taste for Tragedy remains, To you, ye Fair, are meant the coming Scenes. Should your full Eyes in soft Compassion flow, Your Breasts with gen'rous Indignation glow, The Fair Example shall instruct the Age, And banish Farce, and Folly, from the Stage.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE, An Antechamber. The Marquiss of Pescara, and Delio meeting. Delio. My noble Lord, I joy to find that Age, Whose cumbrous Injuries fall thick on Some, And bow them down to Earth, seems to withhold His heavy Hand, as sparing of your Virtues; And presses only with a friendly Weight. Pesc. Travel, I fear, young Man, has taught you Flatt'ry; That common hacknied Art of seeming civil, And being insincere: if so, forego it; And welcome back to Malfy, worthy Delio. You have been long in France, and you return A very formal Frenchman in your Habit. How relish you that Court? Del. So well, that I Could gladly waste the Remnant of a Life there. Pesc. Report, that's seldom kind to Princes' Names, Speaks loud in Praises of that Monarch's Wisdom. Del. Nor is she partial in that Praise, my Lord. In seeking to reduce both State and People To a fixt Order, this judicious King Begins at home; quits first his Royal Palace Of flatt'ring Sycophants; of such, whose Morals, Corrupt and loose, might hurt the sounder Minds: Consid'ring duely, that a Prince's Court Is like a common Fountain, whence should flow Pure silver Streams diffusive: but if, haply, Some curst Example poison near the Head, The foul Contagion spreads throughout the Land. Pesc. You are a faithful Herald of his Virtues; And your good Mistress will be pleas'd to hear You dare be just to Worth, where e'er 'tis seated. Del. Her beauteous Excellence is still unmarried? Pesc. I hope so, Delio. Del. Why, my honour'd Lord? Pesc. Because I'd wish her still your Royal Mistress. And so her State of Power is circumstanc'd By her late Consort's Will, that know, young Man, Her Rule determines with her Widowhood: And should she take another Lord, the Pope May seize into Protection of the Church The Dukedom, which she holds as Dowager, And Guardian to her Son. Del. Then must those Beauties, Which might inrich the worthiest Monarch's Bed, Like consecrated Treasures, lye inshrin'd; Be lost to Use, and only wonder'd at! Pesc. 'Tis true, and Pity 'tis; But she, fair Saint, Bears the Restriction with a Mien so chearful, So wean'd from young Desires, as if her Charms Were lent to be like monumental Lamps, Burn inward, and adorn her Husband's Grave. Del. I hope, my Friend and Partner of my Studies Lives in her Smiles, and holds the wonted Grace. Pesc. The good Antonio?—You must call him now Great Master of her Household. Our wise Dutchess Both knows and cherishes his Worth at full: Who pays her Favours back with ample Service. For still an honest Statesman to a Prince Is like a Cedar planted by a Spring; The Spring bathes the Tree's Root; the grateful Tree Rewards it with his Shadow.—His Advancement May well be styl'd her Glory; while we joy, That some Preferment in the World can yet Arise from Merit. Del. You speak Musick to me; So dear I love the Man, and prize his Fame. The Presence fills:—and, or my Eyes are false, Or Bosola amidst th'obsequious Train Shot glancing by. Pesc. —You know him then, it seems? Del. Full well; our Fellow-student at Bologna. Of an aspiring Spirit; but one that wears His Disposition cloak'd with Gloom and Thought; Blunt and morose in Language; brave, but cruel; There is a savage Mixture in his Nature, An unreclaim'd, and most irregular Fierceness That Virtue scarce can temper to her Laws. Pesc. I have observ'd him such: His Tongue sheds Wormwood; The Gall o'th'Court.—Yet, as I guess, his Railing Is not from simple Love of Piety; He seems to rail at Things, which most he wants: And would be wanton, covetous, or proud, As any Man, had he the Means to be so. I like him not. Del. What Motive brings him hither? Pesc. That wants expounding yet. He comes a Creature Of Ferdinand, the great Calabrian Duke; Or to the Cardinal of Arragon, Our Dutchess' Brothers, who are now her Guests. But see, your worthy Friend.— Enter Antonio, attended with Suitors. Ant. My Lord Pescara, Let me commend these Suitors to your Virtue. We're grown old Debtors; and 'tis time we now Consult our Mistress' Honour, and their Wants, In clearing these Demands. I pray, dispatch 'em. The Prince, who boasts full Coffers, yet withholds His Subjects Dues, at best is half a Tyrant. Pesc. My Lord, I have a grateful Present for you. [Presenting Delio. Ant. Delio! Del. Your Slave. Pesc. Heav'n's Goodness crown your Friendship! Follow me, Sirs. [Exit Marq. of Pescara, and Suitors. Ant. My ever-valued Friend! Welcome! O welcome to my Arms and Heart! I wanted one, in whose lov'd Breast to pour My Comforts and my Cares; and Fate has sent thee, When most I wish'd the Blessing. Del. Doubly yours, In Duty and in Love.—My Joy is eager To gratulate your new Encrease of Honours. Ant. My Royal Mistress is a Heav'n of Goodness; And makes the Dictates of her gen'rous Heart The Measure of her Servants' seeming Merits. O Delio, I'm indebted to her Bounties, Beyond what thou canst think, or I can utter. Del. You've now a splendid Court; her princely Brothers, It seems, are resident at Malfy with you; I've known them formerly.—The Cardinal, 'Tis said abroad, is rather brave than holy; Will play his thousand Crowns at Tennis, dance, Courts Ladies, and has fought his single Combats. Ant. Such Flashes of exteriour Gallantry May hang on him for Form; but, note him inward, And he's the sowr and melancholy Churchman. Where once he's jealous, he will lay worse Plots, Than Juno's Hate devis'd for Hercules, To sink the Man his Foe; strew in his Way Intelligencers, Flatt'rers, prating Atheists, And the whole Brood of sly, political Monsters, To snare his Life away. He had been Pope, But, 'stead of climbing to the sacred Chair By Steps of plain and primitive Decency, He did bestow Bribes with so large a Hand, And that so open, as he meant to carry The Dignity away 'gainst Heav'n's Consent. Del. I have enough of him: But what's his Brother? Ant. The Duke? (they're Twins in Quality of Soul,) Of so perverse and turbulent a Nature, Those Elements seem at War, of which he's fashion'd. What appears in him Mirth, is meer Outside; He speaks with others Tongues, and hear Men's Suits As oft with others Ears; will doom to Death By Information, and rewards on Hear-say. Del. Why, what a Pair is this, to make the World Asham'd of Royalty!—But, for their Sister,— Ant. Ay, Delio, there's the Stamp of Heav'n's Vicegerent. You never fix'd your Eye on three fair Medals Cast in one Mould, so diff'rent of Expressure. For her Discourse, 'tis so like Harmony, You only will begin then to be sorry, When she doth end her Speech: And while she talks, She throws a Look of so much Sweetness round, As makes Beholders doat upon her Beauties With Wonder and Delight: Yet in that Look There breaks forth so divine a Continence, As cuts off ev'ry vain and wanton Hope. Her Days are practis'd in such noble Virtues, That, sure, her Nights, nay more, her very Slumbers Are more in Heav'n than Vestals rapt in Vision. Del. Your honest Praise is breath'd with such a Warmth, As speaks it from the Heart. Ant. Indeed, it grows there. My Admiration, join'd to grateful Duty, Makes my Tongue wanton in the rapturous Theme, And bears me to Excess.—But oh, my Delio, I have a Secret for thy trusty Ear, That, once disclos'd, must seal thy Lips for ever. Del. Make me the Partner of your inmost Counsels, And I'll conceal your Secret from the World, As warily as they, who trade in Poison, Keep Poison from their Children. Ant. —Kind, as faithful! You shall partake it: But we're interrupted: Come, let me lead you to the Dutchess' Presence, And she shall seal your Welcome. [Exeunt. Enter Cardinal, follow'd by Bosola. Card. You haunt me, Sir. Bos. 'Cause I my self am haunted, If Poverty's a Fiend; who in her Train Brings watchful Cares, bold Importunity, Neglect of Friends, and general Contempt. I've done you better Service, and you've own'd it, Than to be slighted thus.—Degen'rate Age, Where only the Reward of doing well Lies in the doing! Card. Sir, you do inforce Your own Deserts too much. Learn Modesty; And study to be honest. Bos. 'Would your Grace With all the Light of your Divinity Could point me out the Path. I've heard, that many Have travell'd far in Quest, and yet return'd As arrant Knaves as they at first set forth, Because they bore themselves along i'th'Journey. Card. Now you grow insolent. Bos. If to speak Truth In plain and unset Phrase, and, after, dare To back it with my Sword, be Insolence; E'er since I could write Man, 'tis what I've practis'd. Card. So ev'ry Ruffian says.— Enter Duke Ferdinand. Brother, your Ear. Be sure, you entertain this Bosola For our Intelligence: I'd not be seen in't: And therefore often have I seem'd to slight him, When he did court our Furth'rance in his Service. Ferd. Why were not the Great Master of her Houshold Fitter to watch her? Card. No, that Thought deceives you. His Nature is too honest for such Business: And would betray our Trust in pure dull Virtue. This Fellow's to be bought, and courts Employment. I'll leave him to you; use the instant Means Of Tryal, and retain him to our Purpose. [Exit Card. Bos. He's gone:—Ingratitude is, sure, grown shame-faced! Some Men, as Zealots fancy, are possess'd; But yon great Fellow might possess the Devil, And make him more a Fiend.— Ferd. You seem disturb'd: The Cardinal my Brother, as I guess, Scarce likes you well. Bos. —Ne'er since he was my Debtor. Ferd. Perhaps, some oblique Character in your Face Makes him suspect you. Bos. Does he study Faces, Against the Faith o'th'Proverb, to be couzen'd? He doth suspect me wrongfully. Ferd. That granted, You must give Great Men leave to take their Times. Distrust secures us best from being deceiv'd; As oft the Shaking of the lofty Cedar Fastens it more at Root. Bos. The Maxim's frail. For to suspect a Friend unworthily, Instructs him the next Way to suspect you; Thence prompts him to deceive you. Ferd. Come, forget it: I mean you Honours. Bos. There are many Roads, All publick too, conduct to seeming Honours; But most are dirty ones. Ferd. This Purse in Earnest. [Gives him Gold. Bos. What follows? Never rain'd such Show'rs as these, But Thunderbolts succeeded. What Atchievement Must buy this golden Bribe? Whose Throat be cut? Ferd. Your Inclination to shed Blood rides Post, Ere my Occasions ask. I give you that, To live i'th'Court here; to observe the Dutchess; To note all the Particulars of her Haviour; What Suitors do sollicit her for Marriage, And whom she best affects. She's a young Widow I would not have to marry. Bos. No, Sir; why? Ferd. Do not you ask the Reason: Be content, I say, I would not. Bos. So this tempting Bait Must turn me to a subtle quaint Familiar. Ferd. What's that? Bos. A sort of Witch's Spirit, for Mischief: That cherish'd Tool of Courts, call'd an Informer; Whose Thriving hangs on his ingenious Care To find out Accusations, or invent 'em. I would be taught th'Extent of my Commission, And your Expectance. Ferd. If your Necessities Permit you to be moral, more than wise, My Largess was misplaced. Bos. Is it so strange, I would not let my Virtue down the Wind Without a Qualm at Parting? The Reflection Puzzles my Reason, why a Great Man's Bounty, That makes him truely Noble, or should do so, Must make the Man, on whom 'tis plac'd, a Villain. But there is Rhet'rick in this yellow Pleader, To reconcile the widest Paradox; And chain Conviction to Absurdity. I am your Creature.— Ferd. Bend my Pow'r and Int'rest To your wish'd Purposes, and sway 'em freely. Know us your Friend: You must be fix'd in Malfy: Our Sister Dutchess shall at our Request Admit you of her Train.—If you will hold Your Eyes and Ears on strict and faithful Duty, To mark her Conduct and report your Notice, Count thence your Fortunes built.—Attend us to her. [Exeunt Duke Ferdinand and Bosola. SCENE opens to the Presence-Chamber. Dutchess of Malfy in a Chair of State, Antonio, Delio, Cariola, Ladies and Attendants. Dutch. And the French Courtiers wear their Hats, you say, Before the King? Del. I've seen it often, Madam. Dutch. What, in the Presence? Del. Yes, so please your Highness. Dutch. Why should not we bring up that Fashion here? 'Tis gorgeous Ceremony, more than Duty, Our Subjects shew us in a Head uncover'd. Be you th'Example to the rest o'th'Court, [To Anton. Put on your Hat first. Ant. 'Pray, your gracious Pardon. I've seen, in colder Countries than in France, Nobles stand bare to th'Prince: And the Distinction, Methought, shew'd rev'rently. Dutch. 'Twas, sure, a Debt Flatt'ry first paid, and Vanity was fond of. Now, to my Thought, that stubborn Dignity, Which, like th'unwieldy Elephant, ne'er knows To bend the Joint, or scorns to condescend, Is Grandeur ill-disguis'd in Pride.—Antonio, You have a Right to stand exempt from Forms. Ant. What said your Grace?—Heav'ns! how I shake all o'er, And dread her fond Imprudence! Dutch. That good Man, Who takes our Cares upon him, should be deem'd Rather a Friend than Servant: And in Friendship, Where Parity's implied, all nice Distinctions Of superficial Form debase its Title. Ant. Ambition, Madam, is a Great Man's Madness; Who is not kept in Chains, and close-pent Rooms, But in fair lightsom Lodgings; and is girt With the wild Noise of prat'ling Visitants; Which makes him lunatick beyond all Cure. Let me not grow bewilder'd with your Favours: The utmost I can do, is humble Duty Imperfectly fulfill'd.—Your princely Brothers.— Enter Cardinal, Duke Ferdinand, and Bosola. Ferd. Most luckily encounter'd, good Antonio; The Florentine, Castruchio, Sir, has brought us Some Sets of Horses manag'd to the War, In which I gladly would require your Judgment. Ant. Your Grace commands my little Skill. Ferd. We must not Permit you to disparage your good Knowledge.— They're now on the Parade, drawn out for View: Delio, we much entreat you to assist Your Friend's Opinion. Del. At your Grace's Pleasure. [Exe. Ant. and Del. Ferd. Daniel de Bosola—where are you, Sir? Bos. Here, good my Lord. Ferd. Sister, this Gentleman, A worthy Fellow, and of Trust approv'd, Makes court to serve you. Let him be remember'd, And listed of your Train. Dutch. Your Knowledge of him Commends him, and prefers him.—Sir, we'll study The Means to graft you ours. Bos. My Thanks and Duty. Ferd. You're planted, Sir; and it behoves, You think, What Hand hath giv'n you Growth. Bos. I shall remember. Ferd. It will import you much.—One Caution more; Wear your old Garb of Sow'rness and Reserve; So 'twill be thought you envy those above you, Yet reach not at 'em. This will gain Access; And keep your Speculations unobserv'd. [Ex. Bos. bowing. Dutch. Why does your Eminence now move this Subject? Card. We are to leave you, and your own Discretion Must now be your Director. You're a Widow; You've had your Taste of Marriage once; and therefore Let not Youth, gallant Bearing, Eloquence, Nor any thing without th'Addition Honour, Sway your high Blood.—We deem them most luxurious, Will marry twice. Ferd. O!—well remember'd; Sister, You live in a rank Pasture here i'th'Court, Where is a kind of Honey-dew that's deadly To poison Fame. Look to't, and be not cunning: Hypocrisy is wov'n of fine small Threads, Subtler than Vulcan's Net: But yet, believe it, Your darkest Actions, your most private Thoughts, Will come to light. Card. Nay, you may flatter your self, And take your own Choice; privately be married Beneath Night's Cover;—but observe withal, Such Wedding bears a foul Name: And its Joys, Its wanton Pleasures, are like heavy Sleeps, The Harbingers of Death. Dutch. Sirs, have you more? I think, this Speech betwixt you Both was studied. It came so roundly off. Ferd. Deem it not slight The Honours of Castile and Arragon Run in your Veins: A Stream that must run pure. And not be sullied by a common Current. Be warn'd in Time: Remember, you were once The Consort of a King, till France had Power To chase him from his Throne; and should you wed Beneath that Rank, (so much I am the Spaniard,) It were such Treason 'gainst our State of Honour, As Love could never salve, nor Pity pardon. Dutch. What shall I say to still this Tempest? More I'll never marry. Card. So most Widows say; But commonly that Motion lasts no longer Than till the Hour-glass turns: The Fun'ral Sermon And Vow of Continence end both together. Ferd. Swear by our Father's Soul, you will not marry; That, if you do, in justice to our House, He may sollicit Heav'n for righteous Vengeance. Dutch. Why must I swear? [Weeping. Ferd. Ha! Is it then too late? Those guilty Tears proclaim, that your hot Blood, And curst licentious Youth have stoop'd to Frailty. Dutch. Your Violence and Suspicions doubly wrong me. By Virtue, and my Father's Soul, I swear, I ne'er will marry more, till you command And give me to a Husband. Ferd. Hold to that, And be my worthy Sister.—I repent me To've giv'n you cause of Tears; but tis a Dew, May save a Show'r of Blood. Come, noble Brother; Th'Imperial Letters call for our Dispatch. Sister, your Vow is grav'n upon my Heart. [Exeunt Cardinal, and Duke Ferdinand. Dutch. I'm sick o'th'sudden; would it were to Death! For something here presages to my Soul, My better Days are done.—Thy Hand, Cariola: Support thy Mistress: and let some one bid The Master of our Household strait attend us. The Master!—There my throbbing Heart beats thick, And my distemper'd Thoughts recoil with Dread. What Tumult plays the Tyrant here within! The Conflict is too strong; it bears me down. My Bosom's one rough Sea, where varying Passions Shift, as the Clouds their momentary Form: Now Hope with Gleams of Sun-shine gilds the Storm: The gladning Rays a-while the Gloom dispell, And the shrunk Billows seem t'abate their Swell: But soon the Sky grows blacker than before; Comfort withdraws; again the Surges roar; And mount, and dash me on the rocky Shore. [Exe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. SCENE, The Antechamber in the Palace. Enter Bosola. I'm here in double Trust; yet, to be faithful, Must one way break my Faith; and leave the Path Of simple Virtue, which was never made To seem the Thing it is not.—The hot Duke Bribes me with Gold to be his Spy o'th'Time; And I, to earn that Bribe, Cameleon-like, Must suck in Air, the Breath of Calumny: A pestilent Vapour Princes Palaces Are seldom purg'd of.—Then, the beauteous Dutchess, Unknowing on what Grounds I'm planted here, Gives me in Hope an Office to betray her. And why this Task impos'd, but 'cause, forsooth, She must not marry.—So th'ambitious Brothers, For Reasons to themselves, have set it down. Am I a Thing of Vice? Or is it Int'rest, That sly seducing Fiend, is tamp'ring here To push fair Nature from her honest Byass? The Duke approaches:—I must wear the Garb Of seeming Mystery; and cloath my Forehead With the grave Shews of speculative Wisdom: 'Twill stamp Opinion of a Brain employ'd On Themes of serious Moment. Enter Duke Ferdinand. Ferd. —Now, my Friend, What, in your Contemplations? You are studying The Art to grow at once a great wise Fellow. Bos. Th'Opinion, Sir, of Wisdom in ourselves, Like a foul Tetter, not restrain'd in Time, Spreads o'er the Mass, and taints throughout with Folly. I count it better to be simply honest, Than over-subtly wise. Ferd. 'Tis fairly spoken; And gives us large Assurance of your Trust. You will observe our Sister? Bos. This Reminding Comes o'the latest: Sir, e'er since I've been A Guest in Malfy's Court, I have observ'd her. Ferd. What think you of her? Bos. That she is a Woman. Ferd. A Woman! how? Bos. That she is Flesh and Blood: And not the Figure cut in Alabaster, Kneels at her Husband's Tomb. Ferd. —There's something more Couch'd in this dark Reserve, than yet is utter'd. I'll found him to the Bottom.—Tho' our Sister Is in her May of Youth, and her bright Eyes Fling Darts pointed as Sun-beams, yet her Name Fills Italy with the Praises of her Virtue. So cold to Love, so temp'rate of Desires, That she hath sworn to take no second Lord, Till I bestow her Hand. Bos. Why then these Triumphs? These Night-Assemblies, and expensive Revels? A Vizor and a Mask are whisp'ring Rooms That ne'er were built for Goodness; sly Retreats, In which the Devil of Incontinence Still plays at Hoodman-blind, and seems a Saint. There, in disguis'd Variety of Courtship, What cannot a neat Knave with a smooth Tale Make a young Dame believe? Ferd. 'Tis true, her Wisdom Should guard against such Fears, to stifle Censure, But what particular Court-Scandal reigns? What say those Spirits, whose Eyes out-see the Lynx, And whose fork'd Tongues out-hiss the Serpent's Envy? Bos. Marry, they say, the once fantastick Scholar, The grave Antonio, who was wont to study How many Knots made rough th'Herculean Club; And knew what Colour Hector's Beard was of; Is now become the spruce fantastick Courtier: Is read in Modes and Fashions, and takes out Fresh Lectures from the School of modern Fopp'ry. Ferd. I have observ'd the Splendour of his Garb. But to what Cause is this gay Change assign'd? Bos. For that, they say, he audits his Accounts I'th'royal Closet, where more Time is spent Than plain Arithmetick, 'tis thought, requires. Ferd. What say'st thou, Fellow? Bos. Sir. Ferd. What ranc'rous Boldness Dares breath such Thought? Bos. That Poison was too rank. [Aside. You bad me, Sir, report what Censurers said; If it displeases, thank your own Enquiries. Ferd. The lewdest Sland'rer, that e'er broach'd Abuse, Came short of this.—'Tis Blasphemy to Greatness.— And yet Antonio late was made a Lord, And Master of her Houshold.—Hear me, Sir, On your Allegiance hear.—Devise some Means, And instant, that with prosp'rous Secrecy, May give Admittance to our Sister's Chamber. I will not hear Denial. Bos. May I ask, How you intend t'employ it? Ferd. Can you guess? Bos. I'm doubtful in that Question. Ferd. Do not ask then. He, that can compass me, and know my Drifts, Must boast an Angel's Gift, of reading Thoughts By Intuition.—Why that scornful Smile? Bos. I do not think so. Ferd. What then do you think? Bos. You're your own Chronicle too much, and grossly Flatter your self. Ferd. Give me thy Hand.—I thank thee. I ne'er gave Pension but to Flatterers, Till I knew thee.—The Marquiss of Pescara— I have to talk with him. Be not thou seen: Anon I'd use thy Ear. [Exit Bosola. Enter Marquiss of Pescara. Pesc. Health to your Grace. Ferd. My good Lord Marquiss. Pesc. I am sent to greet you From my good Mistress, Sir, your virtuous Sister. Ferd. You preface well: So dear I prize her Honour, It warms me at the Heart to hear it mention'd; And should she lose it, I am confident, Though I lay gasping in a burning Fever, The bare Report would strike me thro' with Cold Piercing as Alpine Snows. Pesc. My Lord,— Ferd. —Your Pardon. This Warmth, howe'er mis-tim'd, may find Excuse In a kind Brother's Zeal.—What says our Sister? Pesc. I have it in Command t'acquaint your Grace, Such dear Regard she pays your late Request, That she appoints Daniel de Bosola The Master of her Horse. Ferd. Such swift Compliance, T'oblige me in the Man I wish'd preferr'd, Gives Warrant of her Love: And it shall live Fixt in my Mem'ry.—But, if I mistake not, This Post of Honour is one fav'rite Plume Pluck'd from Antonio's Crest: And Statesmen seldom At their own Cost can brook another's Rise. Pesc. I dare to vouch, so well I know the Man, Antonio will not harbour a Displeasure At what her Highness wills. Ferd. Is he so good? Pesc. Ambition is in him a Passion only Express'd in Duty; and his utmost Avarice, In ev'ry Office, is to make the Gains Subservient to his Royal Mistress' Honour. He is a Man, were there nor Heav'n, nor Hell, That would be honest; and serve Virtue, tho' He took no Wages of her. Ferd. You bespeak him A Patriot, whom few Courts can match in Praise. The Jewels, that give such Lustre to a Crown, Should still be worn in Sight. Pesc. Our wise good Dutchess Lays herself out in Bounty on his Worth: And thinks, she cannot show'r Rewards so fast As he deserves them. Ferd. Yet I would not have her So prodigal, and wanton of her Grace, As to incur a wild invidious Censure. Pesc. My Lord,— Ferd. I do not speak, Sir, in Distrust, But as I wish. That Prince, who pays with Wisdom, Best serves his Servant. But you've heard, I guess, Our Brother Cardinal is to drop the Robe, And take the Coat of Mail. The Emp'ror's Wars Demand his Service; and our Martial Pope Resigns him to the Field. Pesc. His Eminence Was once, 'tis said, a great and happy Soldier. Ferd. He's of a daring Spirit, &amp; Fortune woes The Heroe's Sword. If your fair Leisure serve, We'll spend some Conf'rence on the bustling Times, And scan this new-sprung War. Pesc. —I wait your Highness. [Exeunt. SCENE changes to the Dutchess's Apartment. Enter Dutchess and Cariola. Dutch. My Bosom's much disturb'd.—Cariola, To thy known Secrecy I've giv'n in Trust More than my Life, my Fame. Heav'ns, your sweet Aid! For I am stray'd into a Wilderness; Where I shall find no Path, no friendly Clew, To be my Guide. Cari. The Heav'ns with watchful Care Shall show'r Protection on your wond'rous Goodness. You've done an Act, for which the zealous Pray'rs Of many a worthy and unbenefic'd Scholar Shall bless your Name. The Virgins of your Land, That have no Dowries, shall hope, your Example Will raise 'em to rich Lords. Th'uncherish'd Poets Shall hence derive a Theme of fresh Renown, To thank you for't in Death; and make your Grave More rev'rend far than all the Council-Chambers Of living Princes. Dutch. Cease these lavish Raptures: For my pang'd Heart looks back on what I've done With Doubt and Dread. As Soldiers oft in Battles, By apprehending Dangers, have atchiev'd Actions almost impossible to Reason; So I thro' Frights and Threatnings have assay'd A dang'rous Venture. Cari. What have you to fear, But that your haughty Brothers may receive The Tidings with a short, but vain Displeasure? Dutch.. Alas! That Term's too mild to speak their Passions. The Cardinal is sullen, stern, resentful, Pensive in Wrath, and bears a stubborn Malice: That, like a ling'ring Poison, lies conceal'd, And kills at slow and unsuspected Distance. But the hot Duke, hasty and rash as Fire, Ponders not on Revenge; but fierce, impetuous, Kindles at once, and lays all waste before him. What have I not to fear, so rounded in? Cari. Your Lord approaches: I may well be spared, Better employ'd to guard against Surprize. [Exit Cari. Enter Antonio. Ant. In Tears, my Princess? Heav'n avert the Omen! Did the blest Sun shine with so bright a Ray This Happy Morn, when you resign'd your Hand, And made me Lord of all this Mine of Treasure; To see his Ev'ning Beams thus stain'd with Clouds, And bursting Show'rs of inauspicious Sorrow? Dutch. I've Cause of Grief. Ant. Am I not then to fear, That, like a rash and heedless Prodigal, You've giv'n a Jewel of unvalued Price With lavish Haste, and now repent your Bounty? Dutch. I do, indeed, repent what I have done. Ant. Fate, thou hast done thy worst, to make me wretched At this unguarded Hour; when my fond Soul Was rapt with Comfort, and imagin'd Transports. Let the fierce Cardinal and Calabrian Duke Now plunge their Ponyards here, and wreak their Vengeance! Since I've offended you, 'tis fit I fall The Victim to their Wrath, their just Resentment. Dutch. Alas, forgive me, good my Lord; 'tis I That have offended; done you heinous Wrong, And scarce can hope your Pardon. Ant. Wrong to me, That am your abject Slave? That had no Worth, But what your Goodness stamps; which now has rais'd me To boast the Title of your wedded Husband? Dutch. My wedded Husband—There my Fears renew; Trust it not to the Air in lowest Whisper, Lest Heav'n should hear, and be provok'd to punish: For I have sworn to my impetuous Brothers, That I no more would wed. Ant. When did you swear So rash an Oath? Dutch. Scarce have the Sands of Time Yet chang'd the Hour, the guilty fatal Hour, Which must record my Vow. Ant. All yet is well. You then were married: and, while I survive, You cannot wed again. Dutch. But my Heart trembles, To think, when this dread Secret shall be known, What stern Reproaches I shall bear from them: How virtuous Souls will start to hear it mention'd, That, conscious of a mean dissembling Vow, I basely dar'd prevaricate with Heav'n. Ant. Let not too nice a Fear thus rudely torture Your tender Breast. Heav'n shall absolve the Vow, These tyrant Brothers had no Right t'extort: And good Men call the Force a virtuous Fraud, Which Policy made just, t'avert the Storm Of their ungovern'd Spleen. Dutch. I'd fain believe; But fear, you are a Confessor too partial: Hiding my Trespass, like that bad Physician Who sooths his Patient, when the Case is mortal, And says, the Danger's past. Ant. Esteem me rather That good Physician, who is learn'd in Art To cure the Qualms of sickly Apprehension, Which your mistaking Weakness thinks Disease. Resume your Mirth, and greet th'approaching Time: See, friendly Ev'ning has shut in the Day, And Hymen lights up ev'ry gladsom Torch To guide me to my Joys. Dutch. Forbear that Thought; Till these tempestuous Guests have left us free To safe Delights. Ant. Not for the Wealth of India Would I forego the Bridegroom's glorious Right. Let me in this presume to disobey you, And claim my lawful Pow'r.—Your Ladies wait you; Be gay, and hoodwink sly Suspicion's Eye. When all is quiet, and the Court at Rest, With faithful kind Cariola for my Guide, Beneath Night's Covert, like a happy Miser Indulg'd in private Wealth, untrac'd and secret I'll steal to visit the rich darling Store, Which ne'er must see the Day. Till then, this Kiss; And I bequeath you to the Guard of Angels. [Leads the Dutchess to one Door, and then goes off at the opposite Side. SCENE Changes to the Antechamber. Enter D. Ferdinand, and Cardinal. Card. This sudden and intemp'rate Rage of yours Will be too soon observ'd. Ferd. I have this Night Convers'd with Horrors, and am growing mad. Card. I think no less. Beware your old Distemper, And qualify this Fury. Ferd. —Shall our Blood, The Royal Blood of Arragon and Castile, Be foully tainted?—O we foolish Men, To trust our Honours in so frail a Bark As Woman is; so slight, and all-unable To stem the calmest Weather! Card. Be more plain: What is this Prodigy? Speak lower. Ferd. Lower? Why, 'tis not whisper'd now, but nois'd, and publish'd, As Servants do the Bounty of their Lords, Aloud, and with a covetous searching Eye, To mark who note them.—O, what Med'cine is there, Can purge this Choler? Here Disgrace is writ, To prompt my Memory; and here't shall stick, Till, in her bleeding Heart, Revenge finds Means To wipe it out. Card. Why do you make your self So wild a Tempest? Ferd. Would I could be one; That I might toss her Palace 'bout her Ears; Root up her goodly Forests; blast her Meads; And lay her gen'ral Territory as waste, As she hath done her Honours. Card. Where's the Proof? Suspicion, that too oft outflies the Mark, Once found to err, gives up its credulous Truster To common Laughter. Ferd. Must we then be last To scent her Infamy? And wait the Test, The dull Parade of fulsom Demonstration, Till Boys, more sensible, and less reserv'd, Catch up, and spread the horrid Tale of Shame, And hoot at our Dishonour? Card. Still I say, Where are the Proofs? Ferd. —Pregnant as vernal Buds, And spreading to the Sun. Intelligence Hath caught her in the Wind; and prating Lacquies Make her Incontinence their Theme of Mirth. Good, honest Bosola, that is asham'd To own, he knows the Rumour of her Lewdness, Wraps it in Doubt; speaks sparing, and at distance; As loth to wound our kindred Ears with Guilt Too gross and palpable. Card. Your Doubts then rise, From Bosola's doubting to proclaim her guilty? Ferd. You would not have him tell me to my Face, She is a Strumpet?—Swift Confusion seize her! The Wounds of Fame will not be heal'd by Balsam, But desperate Physick; Corrosives, and Fire, To search 'em to the quick: for that's the Mean To purge infected Blood, such Blood as hers; And make us sound, and wholsom in her Cure. Card. How idly shews this Rage, which carries you, As Men convey'd by Witches thro' the Air, On violent Whirlwinds. Such intemp'rate Noise Fitly resembles deaf Men's shrill Discourse; Who talk aloud, thinking all other Men To have their Imperfection. Ferd. O,—your Pardon:— You have not then my Palsie? I have known, When Imputation of a Stain like this, And on a Ground less tender, would have seiz'd Your Constitution with the fev'rish Fit, And shook your Passions. Card. Yes, I can be angry, As Reason bids me; but there's not in Nature A Thing, that makes Man so deform'd, so mean, As doth intemp'rate Anger. School your self: And suffer Judgment to direct Resentment. If that inordinate and wanton Conduct Calls down a Censure, the offended Church Shall ask a strict Account. Ferd. So I must study A patient Discipline of Heart, to seem The Thing I am not; and sit down content, And think the Injuries of Honour salv'd With sanctimonious Penance, forc'd Contrition, And Chastisements of Form; while she survives, Glowing with Infamy, to laugh at Pardon So slightly purchas'd, and renew Damnation. Card. You reach me not. The holy Rods once brandish'd, The secular Pow'r succeeds; and we, as Brothers, With gen'ral Warranty shall stand impow'r'd To purge our House of Scandal. Ferd. —There's some Comfort: A Cordial Med'cine from a Brother's Hand, To save me from the slow and lingring Poison. But, oh! if she be foul, (as, sure, she is;) Pour yet a kinder Balm into my Wound; And say, a Brother's Arm may strike the Blow Of Vengeance for the Church, and for our selves. —'Tis working here.—Retire; and with thy Counsel Assist to methodize the noble Scheme. You, as Heav'n's Friend, this Province shall assume, To dictate, and denounce the righteous Doom: While I, his wrathful Minister, will stand, Prepar'd to deal the Thunders, you command. [Exe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. SCENE, an Antechamber. Enter Antonio, and Cariola. Cari. Two Hours, and more, her Highness has retir'd, And is undrest. Ant. The Presence empties slowly. Cari. These Gallants teach our sober Court ill Hours, Who are not wont to trespass thus on Night. Ant. They trespass on the Night, but more on me; Who, but for these their Revels, had ere this, Been clasp'd in an Embrace, that Kings might envy. When all is quiet, I shall use thy Aid To guide me to my Bliss. The Duke approaches:— Be watchful, dearest Maid, to hear my Signal: For I must give it with a tim'rous Hand. Cari. Doubt not my Care. Ant. We must not now be seen. Commend me to my Love; and say, how ill The lingring Time sorts with my fierce Impatience. [Exeunt severally. Enter D. Ferdinand, and Bosola. Ferd. No more;—If she be fall'n, nor Youth, nor Beauty Can palliate the Offence. The fairest Form, Tainted with Guilt, shews like a Leprosie The fouler for its Whiteness. Bos. —What if she, As it has happ'd to others, should have had Some Sorc'ry practis'd? Ferd. Sorc'ry! to what Purpose? Bos. To make her doat on some desertless Fellow, She shames t'acknowledge. Ferd. Can your Faith give way To think there's Pow'r in Potions, or in Charms, To make us love whether we will, or no? Such Notions are meer Gulleries of Art, Devis'd by cheating Mountebanks t'abuse us. D'ye think, that Herbs, or Charms, can force the Will? Some Trials have been made in this fond Practice; But the Ingredients still were lenitive Poisons, Prepared, and temper'd just to such a Force, To make the Patients mad; and strait the Witch Swears by Equivocation, they're in Love. The Witchcraft, Bosola, lies in her Blood; And I this Night will force Confession from her. Bos. You shew such Fervour, and intemp'rate Heat, I almost do repent me to have furnish'd The Means for your Admission to her Chamber. Ferd. Fear not my Conduct; nor affect to grow Too scrupulously wise:—Where is that Plan, The Frenchman drew, for fortifying Naples? Go, fetch it strait; and see us in our Chamber. [Exit Bosola Enter Cardinal, and Marquiss of Pescara. Not yet in Bed, Lord Cardinal? I begin To feel Sleep weigh upon me. Hear you, Brother; Ere Morning grows much older, I've strong hopes To find some Doubts resolv'd.—Good Rest t'ye Both. Pesc. Lights for the Duke. [Going Ferd. One thing I had forgot. I would not wish yon Bosola yet to know Our Sister's kind Intentions, good Lord Marquess. Some Souls as ill can bear too swift Preferment, As others can Misfortune.—Once again, Good Night. [Exit D. Ferdinand Pesc. I shall observe your Grace's Pleasure. The Duke is of a hot and fiery Spirit. Card. Heav'n grant, what you and others construe Spirit. Have not a latent Fever to its Cause. I doubt it much: and, to confess the Truth, His Grace at times is strangely visited. I would not for a Million, he should now Suffer Relapse. Pesc. Pray, what is his Disease? Card. A Frenzy, Sir, most pestilent of kind; With which when he's possess'd, there doth o'erflow Such melancholy Humour, he imagines Himself to be transform'd into a Wolf: Shuns all Resort of Men; howls fearfully; And if not watch'd, would steal at deep of Night To lone Church-yards, and dig dead Bodies up. Pesc. Most dreadful Malady!—Poor Prince! Card. And then, Sir, All his Determinations and Attempts Center in Blood. I fear, I fear, Lord Marquiss; For Tempers so precipitate, and rash, Are dang'rous to Great Men.—'Tis fit, in time His Servants keep strict Watch.—My Lord Pescara, I trespass on your Age: Night calls upon us. Pesc. I'll wait upon your Grace. Card. —I trouble you. Pesc. My Duty's paid with Pleasure. Card. —Good old Man! [Exeunt: The Cardinal laying his Hand on the Marquiss of Pescara's Shoulder. SCENE changes to the Dutchess's Bed-Chamber; a Bed seen, and a Table with Tapers. The Dutchess sitting undrest. Dutch. How painful seems this Interval! One Hour Moves slow and heavy as a Winter's Night, Where Nights are longest.—I have strove in vain By Reading to beguile the lazy Moments; But my unsteady Eye, and roving Mind, Like two impatient sullen Travellers, Tho' bent the same way, get the Start by turns, And will not keep each other Company. I know not what I read.—What hideous Noise? Sure, 'twas the melancholy Guest of Darkness, The Night-bird scream'd: Or was it Fancy's Coinage? When once the Soul's disturb'd, each little thing Starts and alarms.—The Court's not yet at Rest, Or he would come.—My Breast is like a House With many Servants throng'd, unruly all, And all employ'd on Tasks of different Natures. Doubts, Perturbations, Thoughts of Self-Conviction, Uncertain Wishes, and unquiet Longings, Debate the Strife within.—I've heard it said, Love mixt with Fear is sweetest: I'm, perhaps, Too much a Coward, and that spoils the Relish. Enter D. Ferdinand behind, with a Dagger, who first looks into the Bed, and then comes forward. Ferd. My Snares are spread too soon; and the sly Bird Is not yet pitch'd. Dutch. Sure, 'tis his well-known Voice. Ferd. That Start proclaims, I'm not the Guest expected. Dutch. Indeed, your Visit, stol'n at this late Hour, Gives me Surprize. Ferd. This was my Father's Ponyard: [Throws the Dagger on the Table. And I am loth it should be stain'd with Rust, 'Cause it was his.—I'll give it you. Dutch. 'Tis welcome: For whether I am doom'd to live, or die, I can in both be princely. Ferd. Die then quickly:— Virtue, where art thou hid? Or is it true, Thou'rt but a Name, and no essential Being? O most imperfect Light of human Reason, That mak'st us so unhappy to foresee What we can least prevent! Pursue thy Wishes, And glory in 'em: There's in Shame no Comfort, But to be past all Bounds, and Sense of Shame. Dutch. I pray, Sir, hear me speak. Ferd. What hideous thing Is it, that doth eclipse thee? Thou wert bright, And virtuous, to my Thought, as the cold Moon; But thou hast stoop'd to lend some curst Endymion Thy secret Midnight-kiss, and Shame has blotted Thy Orb of Brightness out.—Thou art undone; Disgrace is grown familiar with thy Fame, And Rumour, who takes Pains to spread the Tale, Tells it with Mock'ry. Dutch. You're in this too strict, And were you not my princely Brother, Sir, I'd say, too wilful.—For my Reputation, 'Tis safe; and laughs at sland'rous Calumny. Ferd. Ha! Dost thou know what Reputation is, That lives not in our selves, but others Breaths? Hear me, mistaken Woman.—On a time, 'Tis said, that Reputation, Love, and Death Would travel o'er the World; and 'twas propos'd, That they should part, and take three sev'ral Ways. Death told 'em, they should find him in great Battles, Or Cities scourg'd with Plagues: Love gives 'em Counsel T'enquire for him 'mongst unambitious Shepherds, Where Dowries were not talk'd of; and sometimes, 'Mongst quiet Kindred, that had nothing left By their dead Parents: Stay, quoth Reputation; Do not forsake me; for it is my Nature, If once I part from any Man I meet, I'm never found again.—And so for you, Something is done, (would I could lose the Thought! By which you have shook Hands with Reputation, And banish'd him for ever. Dutch. Yet, Sir, hear me: 'Tis my Discomfort much, that I am fall'n Beneath your Frown; but pains me to the Heart, That what I have to plead in my Defence, Must sink me deeper still in your Displeasure. Ferd. Take heed how you do wound our Ears, I warn you, With bold Confession of committed Guilt; Lest Honour, justly rows'd at the Disgrace, Drive Patience out, and push my Rage to somewhat I may repent too late. Dutch. Alas! I'm married: That is th'Extent and Sum of my Offence. Ferd. Married!—When? how? to whom? thou perjur'd Creature. Dutch. Add not that Aggravation to my Trespass, I am not perjur'd; but was then a Wife, When I did vow that I no more would marry. Ferd. Shameless, equivocating, vile Dissembler! Dutch. I knew, 'twould move you: and because I fear'd The Match might haply not be to your Liking, I practis'd for your Ease: and therefore labour'd To've had the Secret slept: but you've found Means To pluck it from me.—Will you see my Husband? Ferd. Yes, could I with the Basilisk change Eyes, And blast him with a Glance. Dutch. Sure, you came hither By his Confed'racy? Ferd. Do not make me mad. The Howling of the Wolf, the Screech-owl's Yell Is Musick to thy Discords.—Pr'ythee, peace; While yet I've Reason left.—And thou rash Thing, Whate'er thou art, that hast enjoy'd my Sister, (For, I am sure, thou hear'st me;) for thine own sake Let me not know thee. Dutch. Would I were dead! Ferd. It is a Brother's Wish, So you had dy'd before. Mark me, wild Woman; If thou do wish thy Minion may grow old In thy Embracements, I would have thee build Such a Room for him, as our Anchorites To holier Use inhabit: Let not the Sun Shine on him, 'till he's dead; let Dogs and Monkies Only converse with him; and such dumb Things, Whom Nature lends no Voice to sound his Name. Nay, if thou love him, cut out thine own Tongue Lest it betray him.—Fare you well at once: I'll never see you more. Dutch. Oh, do not say so. Ferd. One Word, and I have done. If that your Husband Propose this Night to taste of your Embrace, Let him take heed his Pillow be not stuff'd With Quills of Porcupines.— [As D. Ferdinand is going out, Antonio enters the Chamber, and meets him. Ha! Death and Furies! What sawcy Slave, at this unhallow'd Hour, Dares with licentious Steps press to your Chamber? [Draws his Sword. Dutch. Alas! What means my Brother? Ferd. Ask thy Fame, Thy prostituted Fame, and my wrong'd Love: Ask him, who comes to violate thy Honour, Or soil his own, as Pander to thy Riots. Hold off, and give me way. Dutch. No, first on me Wreak your wild Fury; plunge into my Breast Your thirsty Sword, if that will quench Resentment; Dash me to Earth, and o'er my mangled Limbs Pave out your horrid way to more fell Mischiefs. Ant. Injurious Lord! In what have I deserv'd Such Slander from your Lips? Dutch. O, Peace, Antonio; Throw not fresh Fewel on a raging Flame, That blazes big with Ruin.—Do not struggle; For while I've Life, I'll hang upon your Arm, And stop your horrid Bent. Ant. If I've offended, Proclaim my Crime, and call me to the Question. Is this a place for Broils? A Lady's Chamber Should be as sacred as the Shrines of Saints, No Outrage would prophane. Ferd. —Hear you?—The Slave, Bold in your ill-tim'd Fears, presumes to parley; To bandy Words; and shackle my just Wrath With cold Restraints, and limitary Cautions; Urging the idle Sanctity of Place, Always the Plea of tame undaring Cowards. Ant. Can I bear this? [Laying his Hand on his Sword. Dutch. For Heav'n's sweet Love, forbear. [She quits Duke Ferdinand, and lays hold of Antonio. Restrain this Frenzy. Is Antonio too Combin'd against my Peace?—Think, 'tis my Brother; And in that Thought o'erlook th'intemp'rate Insult. Unless you're Both resolv'd thro' me to stamp Your murth'ring Wounds in this unnatural Strife; For meet you shall not, but in my Destruction. Ant. Forgive my Rashness, all Resentment's charm'd; And he shall kill me, ere I'll wake your Fears So rudely to resist.—Ungen'rous Prince! Wrong not your Mem'ry so, to think I dare not Encounter the worst Danger of your Fury. Remember Naples lost, that fatal Field, And the fierce Gallick King, when you lay vanquish'd, Prostrate, and cow'ring from his brandish'd Sword; Who then but I—this tame, undaring Coward,— Flew thro' the Press, confronted his wak'd Wrath, And (tho' I blush, that I must boast the Service;) Redeem'd you from the swift impending Stroke? You had not else surviv'd to brave me thus. Ferd. Curse on thy Tongue, for stirring that Remembrance! Had I no other Cause of Rage, but this, It is enough, and I could kill thee for't; Did not some busy stubborn Fiend within, Honour, or foolish Pride, drag back my Arm; And chain Resentment down.—Spight of my Spleen, It must prevail.—I ow'd thee then a Life; And, in Return, am pleas'd to spare thine now. That Debt is paid.—I dare not trust my Spirit To farther Talk.—Farewell; when next We meet, A Coward's Infamy pursue my Name, If Vengeance let thee scape! [Exit Duke Ferdinand. Dutch. Heav'ns, how I tremble! Methinks, I stand as if beneath my Feet A Mine were blowing up. Ant. Repress these Fears. How has this Tempest shook thy tender Frame, Oppress'd thy Sweets, and bow'd thee like a Flow'r O'ercharg'd with Dews!—Too sure, we are betray'd; How came he hither? Dutch. That Gallery gave him Entrance, Which still is strictly lock'd, and his Admission Must be by Treach'ry. Ant. Ha! What means this Dagger? Dutch. He left this with me. Ant. And, perhaps, did wish you To use it on your self. Dutch. Indeed, his Action Seem'd to intend so much. Ant. This hath a Handle, As well as Point. Turn back its murth'ring Edge, And purge him of that rank o'erflowing Gall, Which poisons thus his Blood. What frantick Motive Could prompt his savage Heart to wish, such Horror Should reach your sacred Person? Dutch. That I'm married, Is all the Source, the Spring of his Resentment. Ant. Why would you trust him with that fatal Secret? Dutch. To wipe away Reproach, redeem my Honour, (Which, like the Ermin, cannot brook a Stain;) And save me from a Strumpet's Infamy; With which his barb'rous Tongue spar'd not to brand me. Ant. Heav'n punish on his Soul th'injurious Slander! I would, this terrible Thing would come again, That, standing on my Guard, I might relate, And justify my warrantable Love. Dutch. 'Tis vain to hope, that Reason can prevail, Where Madness is the Judge. Trust to no Pleas; For tyrannous Malice will o'erthrow Defence. We must provide for Safety, ere these Tygers Put forth their Claws, and pluck us down to Ruine. I know their savage Souls.— Ant. Yield not to Fears, Too tenderly conceiv'd.—The Princes Both Will smooth their Brow of Hate. Dutch. Like to calm Weather Which ushers in a Storm, false Hearts speak fair To those they mean most Mischief. Ant. Trust my Care: To morrow we will ward against these Dangers, To Night's our own. O let not fierce Disquiet Prophane the Transports of this sacred Night! That is our Bridal Bed; where Hymen waits To bless the yet unfinish'd Rites of Joy. There let me clasp thee to my longing Bosom, And sooth the Tumults of thy Breast to Peace. Dutch. It cannot be: Peace dwells not in that Couch: While rude Suspicion, like the Tyrant's Sword, Hangs trembling on a Thread too weak to hold it. Enter Cariola, hastily. Alas! Cariola, whence that ghastly Look? Horror has fill'd thy Eye, and pale Affright Sits on thy Cheek, and triumphs o'er its Freshness. Cari. Full well these outward Symptoms of Affright Express the Terrors of my lab'ring Soul. I heard Prince Ferdinand, loud as the Sea When Tempests drive it on our rocky Shore, Call to his Servants; bid 'em raise his Brother; Double his Guards; says, Treason is on Foot; Rav'd, with imperious Tone, my Lord, on you; Then cry'd, my Royal Mistress was undone, And must no longer rule the State of Malfy. Dutch. What say you now? This is no distant Thunder; The Storm comes on, and gathers round our Heads. Oh, if you would not see me dye before you, Fly, ere this Tempest break. Ant. What means my Love? You would not wish me, like a feeble Coward, Fly, and leave you expos'd to all their Fury? Dutch. Harbour no Fears for me: I shall be here Safe in my Power, and in my People's Love, 'Gainst aught their Malice dares.—Fly to Ancona; Hire for us there a House; I'll soon send after My Treasure and my Jewels: Faithful Delio Make of our Council: He shall bring you Word How things are carried here, till I can follow. Best of my Life, away.— Ant. I cannot stir. Are these a Bridegroom's Joys? I feel it better To stay and dye, than brook this Separation. Dutch. Come, we must part.—This was our Seal of Love; Be it the lasting Pledge!—Your Kiss is colder Than that an Anchorite, meditating Death, Gives to a senseless Skull. Ant. Wonder not, Sweet: Sorrow has sent each Spark of vital Warmth To fortify my Heart: where the rich Flame Burns on Love's Altar. Dutch. We must make Dispatch. Hold, take this Ring; which, when deliver'd back, (As, use the speediest Means;) let its Return Assure me of thy Safety.—Now, adieu! Ant. I'm e'en like one, that in a Winter's Night Takes a long Slumber o'er a dying Fire, As loth to part from't; yet parts thence as cold, As when he first sat down. My best Cariola! With tend'rest Service chear thy mourning Mistress. Adieu!—O spare these Agonies of Fondness! If we do meet again, we'll meet in Comfort; If not, I've this one Joy of dying Yours. [Ex. Anton. Dutch. Farewell!—And oh, too much I fear, for ever! But yet I find my Heart now more at ease. Fate, do thy dreadful Pleasure!—Come, Cariola, Lead to my Closet; there I will be found; And stand the Shock of these Barbarian Brothers: Pleas'd with my Ruine, so my virtuous Care Redeem Antonio from their murth'rous Frenzy. Like some indulgent Mother, when she spies A sudden Fire around her Dome arise, And rushes thro' the Flood, intent to save A darling Infant from the flaming Wave: Tho' from her Fondness she her Fate derives, She dyes with Joy, to think the Babe survives. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. SCENE, An Apartment in the Palace. Enter Antonio, and Delio, as Pilgrims. Del. Stript of her Dukedom! Ant. Yes; you see what Pow'r Lightens in Great Men's Breath. Del. But by what Justice? Ant. Question not that: The Justice of a Tyrant Lies in his Will. Del. That Doctrine should instruct you Not to trust Chance too deeply with your Safety. What Mercy could you hope from these stern Brothers, Were you discover'd, when their savage Hearts Can treat a Sister with such unmatch'd Rigour? Ant. Shall she be subject to their hated Fury, Subject for me? And shall I start at Danger, To save a lingring Life, of no Account, No Price, but as employ'd to succour her? Del. For that dear Cause be careful of your Safety. Think not, I counsel out of private Fear; For I will second you in all Events: And howsoe'er you mean to square your Fortunes, My Life keeps Rank with yours. Ant. My valued Friend! The credited Report that I am fled, Blunts all Suspicion: And the Croud of Pilgrims, That throng to visit now those hallow'd Relicks Said to rest here, will help to make us pass Safe, and unmark'd, beneath this holy Habit. Del. The haughty Cardinal.—See, he lifts the Nostril, Like a foul Porc'pise snuffing up a Storm! Ant. And screws his Face into an envious Smile, Boding Destruction; like a deadly Cannon, That lightens ere it smoaks! Let's shun his Walk.— What safe Conveyance, Fortune, wilt thou lend To guide this Ring to our griev'd Dutchess' Hand? Could I but see Cariola, I were happy! [Exeunt. Enter Cardinal, follow'd by Marquiss of Pescara. Card. Why this importunate Complaint to me? If these Proceedings wear the Face of Hardship, Blame her dead Husband's Will; her own rash Conduct; That push'd her on to known and wilful Ruine: And let not us stand charg'd with the Effects Of Indiscretion she was warn'd t'avoid. Pesc. That she by Marriage forfeits all Pretence To Rule in Malfy, is, we know, prescrib'd: But to be made a Pris'ner in her Palace, Barr'd from Access, restrain'd like a Delinquent, Are Terms no dying Husband could propose; No Law could warrant. Card. Ha! take Heed, old Man, How you provoke affronted Pow'r too far. Pesc. Your gracious Pardon.—I've been long her Servant: Let that excuse me. Were she not your Sister, Yet she's a Princess. Card. —That's her Crime: She else, At pleasure, might have link'd her to a Beggar; And coupled with him in a common Field, Beneath the Hawthorn Hedge.—Ho! Bosola, there.— Enter Bosola. My Brother tells me, you're become more pliant, And can obey Command.—What of Antonio? Bos. Nothing; but, right to th'Fashion of the World, Slaves, that in's late Prosperity of Fortune, But to have waited on him, would have stoop'd Their servile Necks to lift him to his Saddle, And follow'd at his Heels like the ring'd Bear, Now rail with Freedom; and attack those Virtues, They, nor their Predecessors, ne'er had Share in. Card. Spare these bold Comments, Sir.—These to the Duke, To his own Hand committed with Dispatch. [Ex. Bos. My Lord Pescara, 'tis to be presum'd You've Treasure of our Sister's in your Keeping: We are content you hold it, till requir'd, In our young Nephew's Right, who heirs her Dukedom. [Exit Cardinal. Pesc. And may he heir her Virtues!—Art thou gone? Proud scarlet Tyrant! Would thy Years, young Duke, Were more; that with a Spirit, ripe to the Cause, Thou might'st avenge thee of these bold Usurpers. I know, he's sent for: Posts are wing'd to Naples, To press his Coming: And I'll speed Dispatches To Flavio, the good Tutor of his Youth, That he may come, possess'd with Heart of Love To heal a Mother's Griefs. Heav'n deal her Comforts! [Exit Marquiss of Pescara. SCENE changes to a private Apartment in the Palace. A Couch, with a Lamp burning. The Dutchess, sitting; Cariola, waiting by her. Cari. Depriv'd of Rule,—your houshold Train dismiss'd,— Your Palace made your Prison,—quite shut out From ev'ry Ray of Light, but that of one Poor winking Lamp, whose languid Flame supplies Both Day and Night;—and serv'd by surly Grooms, That tend your Brothers Eyes;—'tis Tyranny, That never, sure, was practis'd to this Hour On one of your Condition!—Why thus mute? Grief and Resentment still are eas'd by Words. Dutch. I am not mad yet, to my Cause of Sorrow Tho', to my Sense, the cov'ring Heav'ns seem made Of molten Brass; and Earth's broad Surface glows With flaming Sulphur; yet I am not mad. Necessity, Cariola, teaches Patience: And, like the Gally-Slave chain'd to the Oar, Sowr Misery and I shall grow acquainted. To suffer constantly is much in Art, And Custom makes it easy. Come, sit thee down; Talk o'er some Tragedy of dismal Woe: Of Lovers crost by Fate, and cruel Kindred, That dy'd, ere they could meet. Cari. Such Tales recounted Would much encrease your Grief. Dutch. Thou art deceiv'd; To hear of greater Griefs, would lessen mine: I can sound all the Depths of stern Affliction; This is a Prison.— Cari. 'Tis indeed, at present: But Heav'n e're long, I trust, shall lend you Aid To shake this Durance off. Dutch. Thou art a Fool; The Nightingale, once cag'd, seldom returns To warble to the Wood. Cari. Pray, dry your Eyes; And hope the best. Dutch. What do I look like now? Cari. Like to that beauteous Mock'ry of your self, Your waxen Image in the Gallery; A deal of Life in Shew, but none in Practice. Or, rather, like some rev'rend Monument, Whose Ruins strike with Pity. Dutch. Very proper:— Antonio knows not yet what Fortune visits His Mistress and his Wife; nor, if he did, Could he redress it: and my Son's so young, (Tho' they should suffer him to take the Dukedom,) He'll have no Feeling of his Mother's Wrongs. The Doors unlocks:—Well, Friend, what would my Keepers? Enter Urbino. Urb. All Comfort to your Grace!— Dutch. I will have none. Pr'ythee, why do'st thou wrap thy poison'd Pills In golden Language thus? Urb. Your Brother, Madam, Prince Ferdinand, in pity of your Sorrows, Is come to visit you; and sends you word, 'Cause once he rashly made a solem Vow Never to see you more, he comes i'th'Night; And prays you gently, neither Torch, nor Taper, Shine in your Chamber: He expects, you give him A private Audience: He will kiss your Hand And reconcile himself; but for his Vow He dares not see you. Dutch. Say, he is obey'd: When will his Highness come? Urb. O'th'instant Moment. Dutch. Take hence the Light, and leave me to my self. [The Lamp is remov'd, and the Stage darken'd; Cariola and Urbino go out. Enter Duke Ferdinand. I think, I hear his Tread. Ferd. Where are you? Dutch. Here, Sir. Ferd. This Darkness suits, and pictures out your Fortune. From what a Blaze of Glory, where you sate Inshrin'd a Wonder, has your hapless Conduct Sunk you in Shade! It fares with erring Greatness, As with that Vapour call'd a shooting Star; Which, bright in Passage, yet, once fall'n, becomes Unlustrous as the Earth with which it mixes. Dutch. Alas! I feel my Fault, and find this Gloom, Like to the sudden Darkness of a Storm, Shew me my Danger.—But, my gracious Brother, Make not my wilful Trespass your Discomfort: But let th'Affliction, as the Punishment, Fall singly on my self. Ferd. —It cannot be: You were the Sun, the Splendour of our House, And I, that like the foolish Indian, gaz'd Almost with Adoration of your Brightness, Am chill'd, and darken'd, by your fading Ray. My Lustre is impair'd; my Titles sullied; And the rude Finger of Contempt shall mark me As Brother to the wanton, widow'd Malfy, Who married with her Groom. Dutch. Sure, that Reproach Is of the bitt'rest. Ferd. Come, no more of this. I meant to seal my Peace: Approach yet nearer: Where is your Hand? Dutch. Here, Sir; but let me kneel, And print a Kiss on yours of true Affection. Ferd. Hold, you're too lib'ral in these Acts of Fondness. Know, that your Son this Night arrives from Naples; And, with the Morrow's Dawn, I'm for Calabria. Here, wear this Ring; and keep it as the Warrant, To judge how Time, and your repentant Sorrows May help to work our farther Reconcilement. Dutch. Now, Blessings on your Heart! Ferd. Lights for the Dutchess— [Duke Ferdinand flings away; and enter Urbino and Servants with Lights. Dutch. Dear Pledge of Peace! More welcome to me far Than Pardon to a Wretch condemn'd:—Start, Eyes! Leap from thy Seat at once, unsettling Sense; And instant Frenzy take up all my Brain! What horrid Magick's bound in this dread Circle, To shake me thus with Fears?—It is the Ring I gave Antonio, when he parted from me. Urb. It is; and he returns it, firm to Promise. 'Tis the last Legacy his falt'ring Tongue Bequeath'd you at his Death. Dutch. Distraction! Horror! Thy Words are keen as Daggers to my Heart; His Death!—O dear Antonio, art thou dead? Has all my pious Care then been in vain, To snatch thee from these fell Barbarians' Fury? There is not betwixt Heav'n and Earth one Wish I stay for now.—Say, wilt thou seek these Tygers, And in a Sister's Name implore one Grant, Which I'll account as Mercy? Urb. What's your Boon? Dutch. That they would bind me to his lifeless Trunk, Till I'm a Corse, like him.— Urb. Leave this vain Sorrow: Things, being at the Worst, still mend; the Bee, That shoots his Sting into your Hand, may then Play with your Eye-lid. Dutch. Good, comfortable Fellow, Perswade a Wretch, that's broke upon the Wheel, To listen to a Cure. Urb. Come, you must live. Dutch. That's the worst Torture Souls, sure, feel in Hell, In Hell, that they must live, and cannot dye. Portia, thou Roman Matron, once renown'd, Infuse me with thy Spirit; teach me to kindle Thy virtuous Coals again; and, swall'wing Fire, Revive thy rare, and almost dead Example Of pure Connubial Faith.—What must I do? What boots it to complain? Or, what to rage? To curse those Stars, that govern human Fates, And lent their Influence to promote such Horrors? Urb. Your Brothers may forgive, and yet grow kind. Dutch. When Fiends relent, and study to grow pious. Ye purple Plagues, whose Wings are charg'd with Bane Potent to scatter mighty Desolation, Swift as the Lightning's Flames, seize and consume them! Let them, like Tyrants, never be remember'd But for the Ills they've done! Let all good Men Forget 'em in their Pray'rs! And Heav'n awhile Cease crowning Martyrs, and give scope to Vengeance! Go, howl 'em this.—More Tort'rers yet to plague me? Enter Bosola, an Officer, and several disguis'd. Bos. You've learnt at full the Tenour of your Orders, And know this Signet. See, your strick Obedience Answer the Limits of the great Command. I stand accountant for your Charge and Safeties. [Exit Bosola. Dutch. 'Twas Bosola;—my newest-favour'd Servants Shrink from the Winter of my waining Fortunes, And bask 'em in the Sun of Pow'r. [Officer gives a Signal, and the disguised Persons go off. What art thou? That look'st so like the Demon of Despair, And with the Wafture of thy Hand can'st chase These petty Fiends? Offic. I'm come to make thy Tomb. Dutch. Thy Office were most welcome, could I find Nature give way to Grief.—But how my Tomb? Thou speak'st, as if I lay upon my Death-bed Gasping for Breath:—Dost thou perceive me sick? Offic. Yes, and most dangerously; since thy Sickness Appears not to thy self. Dutch. Know'st thou me, Friend? Offic. I do; for one, to whom obsequious Crowds Have bow'd at Distance, and rever'd thy Grandeur. That makes thy Sleeps so broken: for know, that Glory, Like Glow-worms seeming Fires, far off shines bright, But, closer view'd, has neither Heat nor Lustre. Dutch. Thou'rt very plain. Offic. My Bus'ness is to flatter The Dead, not Living. Dutch. And thou say'st, thou'rt come To make my Tomb? Methinks, I could be merry On this glad Theme.—I pr'ythee, speak thy Office: Tell me at full to what Effect may lead This solemn Preparation; this Discourse Fit for a Charnel-house. Offic. Let those inform thee. [Pointing to the Side of the Scene. There is a Present from your princely Brothers: And may't arrive most welcome, for it brings Last Benefit, last Sorrow. Dutch. Ha! A Coffin? And o'er it a rude Cord? But 'tis most welcome: What Princess, pain'd like me, should not be glad Of such a peaceful Chamber to repose in? What is my Death? And who are to dispatch me? Offic. Those Men are practis'd in the Trade of Death: Ev'n as the Brothers of the Ottoman Throne, Whose Lives are dreaded, you must dye by Strangling. Dutch. They act but by Command, and I forgive'em. The Apoplexy, or the moist Catarrh, Might do as much as they. Offic. Doth not Death fright you? Dutch. Why should I be afraid to meet a Guest, Whose Presence I so long for? Offic. —Yet, methinks, The Manner of your Death should much affect you. This Cord should terrify you. Dutch. Not i'th'least. For Heav'n sake, any way, so once 'twere done. When is the Hour appointed? Offic. Now: No Respite. Dutch. 'Tis well:—A Sigh, sigh, or two, sent up with Hope, Must seal my Peace. I have no Will to make: Too many a hungry Guest has fed upon me, And left me little to bestow. My Women Must be content to share a poor Reversion. Now, when you please.— Offic. You must remove from hence: And expiate there your Crime, where 'twas committed. Your Bed-chamber is nam'd your Place of Doom. Dutch. Must it then have that Show of specious Justice? O dear Antonio, let thy hov'ring Spirit Wait to receive me! Come, thou violent Death, Serve for Mandragora to make me sleep, For I am much o'erwatch'd.—When I am dead, My vengeful Brothers then may sleep in Quiet. Lead to my Bridal-room:—Heav'ns guard my Son! I come, Antonio! The relenting Tyrants, That parted us awhile, kind in their Rage Prepare to join us in eternal Wedlock. I'm thine for ever now.— [Exit Dutchess; Officer following. Enter Duke Ferdinand. Ferd. O sacred Innocence, that sweetly sleeps On Turtles' Feathers; whilst a guilty Conscience Makes all our Slumbers worse than fev'rish Dreams, When only monstrous Forms disturb the Brain. 'Tis a black Register, wherein are writ All our good Deeds and bad: A Perspective, That shews us Hell more horrid than Divines, Or Poets, know to paint it.—Hark! what Noise? The Screams of Women, ever and anon, Ring thro' my Ears; shrill as the Cries they send, When the stern Murth'rer takes 'em unprepar'd.— A thousand fancied Horrors shake my Soul, E'er since I dictated this Deed of Slaughter. There is no written Evidence to proclaim My Order; and must coward Apprehension Give it a Tongue?—The Element of Water Drops from the Clouds, and sinks into the Earth; But Blood flies upward, and bedews the Heav'ns.— The Wolf shall find her Grave, and scrape it up, Not to devour the Corse, but to discover The horrid Murther.—Shall I let her live? What says Revenge to that? Or what says Nature? Resentment whispers Treason still to Virtue; And, to repent us of a blameful Purpose, Is manly pious Sorrow.—She shall live. [As the Duke is going out, enter Bosola. Where is my Sister? Bos. She's what you would have her. Ferd. I say, where is she? I would see my Sister. Bos. Set wide those folding Doors.—There fix your Eye. The SCENE draws, and discovers the Dutchess in her Coffin. The Cord lying upon it. Ferd. Ha! Thou too fatally obedient Traytor! Is she then dead? Is Mercy sprung too late? Cover her Face; my Eyes begin to dazzle. Bos. What, do you weep? Does Constancy now shrink? Where were these Show'rs of penitent Remorse, While she was living? Ferd. She and I were Twins: And dear Affection, from our earliest Years, Grew, as we ripen'd.—Wherefore did'st not thou Show Pity? What an excellent honest Man Might'st thou have been, if thou had'st spar'd her Youth? If thou had'st borne her to some Sanctuary? Or, bold in a good Cause, oppos'd thy self With thy advanced Sword above thy Head, Between her Innocence, and my Revenge? I bad thee, when I was not sound of Wits, Go kill my dearest Friend; and thou hast done't: And now (as we observe in Tragedies, That a good Actor many times is curs'd For playing a Villain's part;) I hate thee for't.— Bos. I prophesied as much; and did expect you To fall into Ingratitude:—but first I challenge the Reward due to my Service. Ferd. I'll tell thee what I'll give thee. Bos. Do. Ferd. —I'll give thee A Pardon for this Murther:— Bos. —Ha! A Pardon? Ferd. And 'tis the largest Bounty I can shew thee. By what Authority did'st thou execute This bloody Service? Bos. Was it not by yours? Ferd. By mine? What Pow'r had I? Was I her Judge? Did any Ceremonial Form of Law Doom, or deliver her Conviction up? Where shalt thou find this Judgment registred, Unless in Hell?—See, thou rash Thing of Blood, Thou'st forfeited thy Life, and thou shalt die for't. Bos. When I resolv'd t'obey your savage Orders, I held Death at Defiance:—I can die: But first reward my Service. Ferd. —You're a Villain. Bos. When your Ingratitude is Judge, I am so. Ferd. See me no more:—Avaunt! Bos. Why, fare thee well. Your Brother and your self are worthy Men. You have a Pair of Hearts, are hollow Graves, Rotten, and rotting others; and your Vengeance Flies, like chain'd Bullets, link'd in Execution. You're two, whom Sympathy of Soul proclaims Brothers in Cruelty.—Fool that I was! I serv'd your Tyranny, and rather strove To satisfy your Will, than all the World. And tho' I loath'd the Evil, yet I lov'd You that did counsel it.—I'm fairly quitted. Who taints his Honesty t'oblige a Prince, Deserves such Payment. Fare you well for ever. [Going. Ferd. Stay, Bosola, come back.—Forgive my Rashness: The Tempest of my Grief whirl'd me so high, My Sight grew giddy, and had lost thy Friendship. I now recover; and perceive at large The Dearness of thy Love thro' this strong Trial. When I am wayward, think, my Disposition Is out of Tune—We must employ you farther. Bos. What Sacrifice is next? Ferd. You do mistake The Tenor of our Will. This slaughter'd Body Must privately be lodg'd i'th'royal Vault, Where Malfy's Princes sleep in long Succession. My Brother and my self will have it bruited, She dy'd of some Infection which inforc'd Such swift Interment: That will stop all Question. See it perform'd with Secrecy and Speed. Bos. Doubt not my Care: I am embarqu'd so far, That to be secret now imports my Safety. This Penitence comes too sudden, yet to trust it. [Aside. [Exit Bosola. Ferd. That Storm is quieted: but how to hush The Tempest beating here, what Art can teach me? What was the Meanness of her Match to me, Or how my Honour hurt by't? Foolish Pride! What would I give, could I recall this Hour? I would not change my former Peace of Conscience For all the World's best Treasures.—Broods of Vipers Are gnawing round my Heart—They'll tear a Passage, And shew that Bed of Filth, first gave 'em Birth.— Lend me thy Mask, Hypocrisie, to cover The Horrors of Offence beneath the Visage Of pious, Semblance; that when, unawares, A Sigh breaks forth, or gushing Tears are spilt, The World may read my Sorrow, not my Guilt. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. SCENE, Antechamber in the Palace. Enter Marquiss of Pescara and Flavio. Pesc. Thus come you, Flavio, to a mourning State, Opprest with Woe, and unexpected Ruin. Flav. Dead, and no previous Symptoms of Decay! No Warning, to proclaim the Shock of Nature! In the full Strength and Vigour of her Youth! The Secret of her Marriage just disclos'd; And she, on Colours and Pretence of State, Made Pris'ner at her cruel Brothers' Instance! These Circumstances join'd awake Suspicions, That fright my lab'ring Thoughts. Pesc. Indeed, good Flavio, 'Tis strange; and Things are carried all in Clouds: None daring to enquire, or sift Events. The Women of her Chamber stand confin'd On Dreams, and Shadows of affected Doubts Rais'd up by Bosola, the Master-Engine, And Agent in these foul complotted Mischiefs. Heav'n shield their Innocence from subtle Practice, For, much I fear, the Train is laid to catch them! Flav. I hope, our Royal Master, now arriv'd, Will prove the Means to check pernicious Counsels. Pesc. How has the tender Prince receiv'd the News Of his dead Mother? Flav. With so deep a Sorrow, As hardly has been seen in one so young. For, while the Nobles press with eager Haste To gratulate his Succession to the Dukedom, He gently puts 'em off, and turns his Head Away to weep; then cries, “Unhappy Mother! “These are thy Rites.—Inhuman, barb'rous Uncles! “What has your Harshness done?—O save me from them: “Let me be banish'd; turn me out to Deserts; “So I may but decline their dreadful Presence. Pesc. What Heart of Loyalty could wish his Youth Such savage Guardians!—Heav'n, in its good time, I trust, shall bring to Light their hideous Treasons. For Ferdinand already (the just Pow'rs Expound the Cause!) is seiz'd with fearful Frenzy: Oft the Result of foul upbraiding Conscience. See, he moves this Way: let's retire, unseen; And mark the Working of his troubled Spirit. [They retire. Enter D. Ferdinand, follow'd by Urbino. Urb. Why does your Grace despise our proffer'd Duty, Chusing this irksome Solitude? Ferd. Go, leave me; Princes, like Eagles, still should fly alone; While Crows and Daws, and simple chatt'ring Starlings Darken the Air, and flock for Fools to gaze at. Look! What's That follows me? Urb. Nothing, my Lord. Ferd. Thou ly'st: 'tis there. Urb. 'Tis nothing but your Shadow. Ferd. Let it not haunt me;—On your Allegiance, stay it. Urb. What means your Grace? Ferd. Why should a single Man Be pester'd with two Shadows? Is't not enough, The sportive Sun, in Mock'ry of our Beings, Reflects the Image of our outward Substance; But o'er-officious Mem'ry too within Must light the Torch of Conscience, to present us A Shadow of our Minds?—Blot out the Spectre: Get me a Cloud dipt in Ægyptian Darkness, Thro' which Reflection's Eye can find no Passage. Urb. Alas! my Lord, Collect your Soul: Let not distemper'd Wildness Prey on the nobler Faculties within, And hurt your Mind. This fev'rish Rage, indulg'd, Will scatter Reason, as doth the Autumn Blast The Leaf new-faln. Ferd. Why wilt thou trouble me, When I am deep employ'd?—I'm studying here The Art of Patience. Urb. 'Tis a noble Virtue. Ferd. I have been tax'd of Rashness, and I'll mend it With some Exploit of Proof.—I've heard, that Suff'rance Can wear out the rude Wounds of Calumny; Who would not then inforce his Spirit to turn A patient Cheek to the Affronts of Time, And ask Forgiveness of th'upbraiding World; So mild Submission may erase Reproach, And blanch us into Virtue?—What say'st thou to it? Urb. Alas! my Lord, I know not what to say. Ferd. When I've done that, I'll hew my Monument From Rocks of solid Adamant, and rear it High as the boasted Pyramid of Memphis.— My Sister?—What of her? Urb. —I nam'd her not. Ferd. No, do not; if you should, she cannot hear you. What I have done, I've done; I'll not confess:— The Sun is in the Dogstar; and my Eyes Are cruel sore: their Moisture burns me up. [Draws out his Handkerchief, and drops a Paper. Urb. Heav'n ease this Torture! Ferd. Is there a Pow'r in cold Nonacrian Springs To ease this Scorching?—Say'st thou? A Physician? I will have none: Physicians are like Kings, They brook no Contradiction.—Then, their Trade Is with our Insides:—No; I'll not be search'd; I'll keep the secret Malady to my self, And dye by peace-meal first. [Exit Duke Ferdinand; Urbino follows. Marquiss of Pescara, and Flavio come forward. Pesc. What think you, Flavio? These unruly Starts Speak not th'Affection of disorder'd Blood, But a distemper'd Mind; whose violent Workings Sicken the Frame.—Did he not drop some Paper? Flav. 'Tis here; a Letter, and address'd to him. Pesc. It is the Cardinal of Arragon's Hand. I am not ever curious: But to this Reason most strongly prompts: And Ceremony May be dispens'd with well, on our Suspicions. [Reading the Letter. To let her live in an indolent Neglect of her Infamy, is to prolong our own Scandal. Were she once dispatch'd, the Memory of her Indiscretion, and our Reproach, will drop together. If your Determinations are but steady, Bosola depends on your Countenance, and may be trusted with the Enterprize. My Grief o'erflows my Eyes:—O Royal Lady! Wert thou then butcher'd by these ruthless Tyrants? Was it for this, thy dear Remains are thus Huddled to Earth in close Obscurity? Was this the fear'd Contagion?—'Tis, indeed, A Malady that may be catching to us. Heav'n keep it from the Prince! Flav. What's to be done? I stand amaz'd, and lost in Consternation. Pesc. Such Villainy could not sleep. This hated Scroll Forthwith shall be produc'd; and something done To lay these Monsters open to the World: Then, for Revenge: Which, if the publick Sword Of Justice will not grant, the weakest Arm Is strong enough that strikes in such a Cause. Behold this Man of Blood.—See, how he bears him Elate, and fearless in his covert Guilt! We meet not, Cardinal, till it is my Cue To drag this hated Murther up to Light; And tell thee to thy Teeth, thou didst suborn it. [Exeunt Marquiss of Pescara, and Flavio. Enter Cardinal with Carlos, Julio, and Rodriguez, three Servants. Card. Pescara saw me, sure; and scowl'd at parting With Eyes of Scorn, and insolent Defiance. Carlos, and Julio, send Enquiries out To learn how near our Nephew makes Approach; And with what Train conducted to the Palace. [Exeunt Carlos and Julio. Rodriguez; ho!—Let none, upon your Life, Have Conf'rence with our Brother Ferdinand, Unless I know it. Princes, in their Weakness, Descend to common Men; and should be then Secur'd from vulgar Eyes.— [Exit Rodriguez. In this Distraction He might reveal the Murther; and my Name Be question'd for a Deed, which I could wish The World should never hear of.—There are Medicines To charm suspicious Tongues; and I must physick Some yet to Rest, that I may sleep in Safety. Ha! Bosola?—This Fellow must not know, I had Intelligence in our Sister's Death; For tho' I counsel'd it, his Hand was used By Ferdinand's Command.—Now, Sir, your Business? Enter Bosola. Bos. To find a Great Man in his Wits, and willing To recompense my Service. Card. You are ever Pressing your good Deserts. How fares our Sister? How does she brook Restraint, unwish'd, but needful? Indeed, I pity her: and she shall now Taste Comfort from us: Why do you look so wildly? Bos. Why do you use this poor, this priestly, Dawbing? And vainly strive to lay fair marble Colours O'er rotten Purposes, to me who know them? Card. Insolent Slave! I'll have thee hewn in pieces. Bos. Make not your self the Promise of a Life, That's not in your Dispose.—You know, she's dead; You know, you counsel'd it; and Me the Agent. Your politick Brother, who engag'd my Service, Shew'd your Commission for't. Card. Ha!—Then, I find, You know me for your Fellow-Murtherer: And we're concern'd in mutual Regard To keep each other's Counsel.—For the Dutchess, 'Tis meet, she be interr'd with private Speed; Ere busy Sycophants buz about the Prince, And taint his youthful Ear with wild Surmises. Bos. I know my Charge, and want not to be tutour'd. Card. Be not too peremptory.—Learn to think The shatter'd Fortune of the Duke, your Master, A frail Dependance: and 'twere little Wisdom To build on a Foundation sapp'd, and sinking. I've but one thing to wish, which say thou'lt forward, And tho' a Tombstone hid our Brother's Bones, Rely on me, and study thy Advancement. Bos. Give it me in a Breath. Card. 'Tis this:—Antonio, Thou'st heard, is fled, and lurks obscure: Use means To wind into the Knowledge of his Haunts. Wheree'er he comes, be sure, our Names are task'd With boldest Slanders: And while he survives, We draw our Breath in Peril.—Think upon't: See me anon; and if thou wilt provide Against this Danger, do it, and be happy. [Ex. Card. Bos. This Fellow, sure, breeds Basilisks in his Eyes; He's nothing else but Murther. For the Hire Of both their Dukedoms, I'd not be the Villain This Pair of Brothers think me.—Poor Antonio! Thou'rt mark'd for Death. Tho' nothing be so needful To thy lost State, as Pity; yet I find Nothing so dang'rous:—But, howe'er, I'll seek thee; And make it, if thou dar'st be found, my Care To put thee into Safety from the Reach Of these most cruel Tygers.—Seldom, Virtue, Hast thou made Guilt a Trayt'ress to herself; Or taught the Horrors of her monstrous Visage To scare resolv'd Offence to pious Pity. [Ex. Bosola. SCENE changes to a Prospect of ruinous Monuments. Enter Antonio and Delio, as Pilgrims. Anto. The Moon but ill befriends us; yet, I think, We cannot miss the Way. Del. Why will you tread These Paths of Death?—I am not superstitious: But I have Bodings here about my Heart, Which are not meerly of the Woman's Strain. To see her Obsequies, may move your Sorrows To throw out some Extreams importing Danger. Ant. Fear not: I've that Philosophy about me, Which teaches, Sorrow cannot bring her back, 'Would, it would bear me to her!—I am arm'd Strong in Despair to tempt Fate's utmost Malice: And something of Divinity drives me on, To what Event I know not.—'Tis no matter; For to live thus, is not, indeed, to live: But is the Mock'ry and Abuse of Life. Del. We do approach the Monument; for, I think, By the uncertain Gleams of Light, before us I see the Cloyster of the ruin'd Abbey. Ant. All's hush:—I once did love these ancient Ruines; We never tread upon 'em, but we set Our Foot upon some rev'rend History. And, questionless, here in this open Court, (Which now lyes naked to the Injuries Of stormy Weather, and unsparing Time;) Some lye interr'd, who lov'd the Church so well, And gave so largely to't, they vainly thought, It should have canopied their Bones till Dooms-day. But all Things have their End: Churches and Cities, Which have Diseases like to Men, must have Like Death that We have. Del. Let me yet prevail, Ere Desperation urge some fatal Act, To lead you from this waste and dreary Vale. Ant. In Friendship's Name, forbear: For I am bent Against Perswasion's Voice; resolv'd of Purpose. Away!—Methoughts, I heard the Tread of Feet; Lead to the Monument: There we'll stand conceal'd, And, patient, wait the Issue. [Exeunt Antonio and Delio. SCENE changes to the Royal Monument. Enter Bosola. Bos. The Moon has veil'd her Face; and scarce a Star Peers thro' the Clouds:—What Glare of thickning Tapers Shoots thwarting thro' the Palace?—The young Duke Is circled in that Blaze of Light.—These Brothers Will think me tardy in the Funeral Rites, They press with such Dispatch.—'Twas base Distrust, To hide the Honours their good Sister meant me; And I am justified. Enter Duke Ferdinand. Ferd. —I've scap'd the Hold Of these observant Slaves.—They would have made me A Pris'ner like our Sister. Bos. Ha! what Voice? Ferd. Where is this Bosola? I do agree to't. Yes; Strangling is a very quiet Death; And let it be i'th'Dark. Bos. Is that my Payment! It is the Cardinal; and my Death is plotted: It then behoves, I make Prevention sure; And snatch Protection 'gainst their murth'rous Malice. [Exit Bosola. Ferd. It is the Villain's Tongue.—O injur'd Sister, If 'twill in part appease thy Shade, behold me Begin the Expiation of thy Blood With this just Sacrifice. Where is the Traytor? [Draws his Dagger. Enter Cardinal. Card. Where can his Frenzy lead him? Were he dead, And the dread Secret safe, I might taste Peace, Which Guilt and Fear forbid. What Shadow's that? It comes upon me. Speak, what Phantom art thou? Ferd. What! have I caught thee? Slave, thou kill'd'st my Sister, And hast undone my Soul. Take thy Reward. [Stabs the Cardinal. Card. Stay yet thy deadly Arm, mistaken Wretch! I am but hurt: Thy Brother!— Ferd. Ha! the Devil! My Brother fight upon the adverse Party! Villain, that Lye ensures thy Death. [Stabs him again. Card. Nay then I will not fall alone. Take That in Answer, Thou rash and fatal Madman. [The Cardinal in the Scuffle snatches the Dagger, and wounds Ferdinand. Ferd. Oh! I'm shot: A Bolt of Ice glides thro' my Bowels. Quick, Brace on my Armour; give th'Alarm: I feel An Ague-fit upon me: The keen Air Pierces me through, and takes away my Breath. O Cardinal, too late I know thee now; We Both have been to blame, and Heav'n has reach'd us. Man's but the Tennis-ball of Fate, and bandy'd Which way it pleases.—Had we rul'd our Passions, We might have 'scap'd this Overthrow: but now,— I'm wond'rous sick, and giddy. Where's your Hand? Give me your Pardon, and good Night for ever. [Dyes. Card. I follow thee.—Accurst Event of Chance! Am I thus shrunk from all my big-blown Hopes? Must I, who stood like a huge Pyramid, Begun upon a large and ample Base, End in a little Point, a kind of Nothing? Out, thou vain Life! In all our Quest of Greatness, Like wanton Boys, whose Pastime is their Toil, We chase gay glitt'ring Bubbles; which, when grasp'd, Melt in the Touch, and show the Cheat of Glory. Enter Marquiss of Pescara, attended; Servants with Tapers. Pesc. Amazement to my Eyes! Alas, how happen'd This Havock? Card. —In a Mist; I know not how: Such a Mistake, as has the Stream of Vengeance Push'd from it's Course, and turn'd it on ourselves. Your Torch offends my Sight; your Presence more; If you have so much Charity, think, this Web Was wove by Fate; and we are wound i'th'Snare, Because, 'twas will'd of Old, it should be so. Then,—but I go to prove the doubtful Question. [Dyes. Pesc. Sullen, and impious to the Last!—Ye Pow'rs, How swift your Ways, how intricately just! Enter the young Duke of Malfy, Flavio, and Attendants. O Sir, this is, indeed, the Seat of Death; And you must arm your Breast to meet a Scene Of unexpected Horror.—Both your Uncles Lye bath'd in Blood, their Wounds yet freshly streaming, And, as it seems, giv'n by each other's Hands. Duke. Dreadful, as strange! I fear'd to see them living, And Nature bids me grieve to see them dead. Pesc. Remove the Bodies:—Trust me, Sacred Sir, They are not worth your Tears. Duke. When I reflect, How they have robb'd me of a Mother's Welcomes, I think so too.—'Tis Flavio's Lesson to me, That wicked Great Men, dying, are like those Who fall in Frosts, and leave their Print in Snow: The first hot Gleam of Sun-shine ever melts Both Form and Matter. Pesc. —Prettily remember'd! Flav. Your Highness is an apt and faithful Scholar. Duke. I would not wish you grow the Flatt'rer, Flavio; Lest this too early Change of Fortune make me A Truant to Instruction. Enter a Captain. Capt. So please your Highness, Bosola is taken: With him two Pilgrims, who were apprehended Lurking behind the Tomb. Pesc. 'Tis well: produce them. Wrench ope the Monument. Thanks to the Heav'ns, The Agent of their Villainy yet is ours. [As the Tomb is going to be open'd, Bosola, Antonio, and Delio are brought in under Guard. Bos. Prophane not, Sirs, this venerable Pile, Your Toil were vain; the Dutchess is not there. Pesc. What Aftergame of Mischief? Was she not Borne from her Palace at a dusky Hour, Obscurely coffin'd? Bos. No; in that I cheated Her credulous Brother with a waxen Image: That beauteous Waxen Image so admir'd, Fram'd by Vincentio di Laureola, When her Grace married first. Pesc. Ha! say, thou Caitiff, Ere Tortures force, where's then the Body lodg'd. Bos. I answer not to thy Reproach, old Man; But to my Liege. I claim your Grace's Pardon, And will produce the Body. Pesc. Frontless Traytor! Pardon a sacrilegious Murtherer! Duke. Do aught that can deserve our Clemency, Then make thy Claim. Bos. I trust your princely Word. [Exit Bosola. Pesc. Follow him close at Heel, and guard him back; He dares not for his Life produce the Body: Here is too black a Voucher of his Guilt. [Pulling out the Cardinal's Letter. Duke. Why weeps yon Pilgrim so? He stands not charg'd As Party in their Crimes: And, to my Thought, His Face pleads strongly for his Innocence. Why dost thou weep? Ant. I am a Man of Sorrows, So please your Grace: Dead to all worldly Comfort, But what I taste in Tears.—My hapless Story Is little worthy of your princely Ears; And would be buried with my self in Silence. [Shouts within. Pesc. What Shouts of Joy are these, that rend the Air? Again, a nearer Sound.—Oh, look, my Liege; By my best Hopes, my Royal Mistress lives: O virtuous Bosola! Ant. —Amazing Transport! [Enter Bosola, follow'd by the Dutchess, Cariola, and Attendants in Mourning. The Young Duke runs, and embraces her. Duke. My Mother! O, what Words can speak my Joy? Let my Tears answer for my Heart's big Pleasure. What Miracle has giv'n you back to Life? Dutch. This Man, appointed to my Death, preserv'd me. [To Bosola, who kneels. Duke. O think, what Honours can requite thy Virtue. Dutch. Preserv'd me from a Fate, had giv'n me Peace; But now I'm doom'd the Slave to lasting Sorrows: A mourning Widow, past the Help of Comfort, For poor Antonio's Loss. Bos. Ev'n there I'm pleas'd To lend a Dawn of Hope. That fatal Ring, Which you suppos'd sent from your murther'd Lord, Came from his Hand t'assure you of his Safety. A Pilgrim brought it; gave it to your Servants; But, intercepted by your cruel Brother, 'Twas us'd in Aggravation of your Tortures. Duke. Be still the Messenger of farther Comfort, And heighten, if thou can'st, thy countless Merit. Ten thousand Ducats crown the virtuous Man, Who brings Antonio to us. Ant. O my Princess! Look up, and once more bless the lost Antonio. [Throws down his Pilgrim's Staff, and opens his Frock. Dutch. 'Tis He:—O Ecstasy, too strong for Sense! Joy crowds about my Heart in such Excess, The Torrent quite o'er-bears me. Ant. Excellent Creature! Cleave to my Heart. O Bosola! My Brother! Still wear that Title: and divide in all My Wealth; all Joys, but One; the Summ of All. Dutch. They now no more shall part us. Ant. —Never, never: Our Foes are past a Fear.—My dearest Prince, Accept my duteous Knee. Duke. O rise, Antonio, My Father, and my Friend!—I am too young To hold the Reins of Pow'r: Be thou my Guide; And teach the State to ven'rate more thy Virtues. What other Pilgrim's that? Ant. 'Tis Delio, Sir, The willing Foll'wer of my wayward Fortunes. Duke. That Service shall commend him to Reward. Come, Madam, to the Palace, still your own: Where let the Triumphs of your Nuptials banish The Mem'ry of all Griefs. Dutch. Some Tears are due T'appease th'offended Pow'rs. Had I not breath'd A guilty Vow, my Brothers had not bled. Till Penitence shall erase that Debt of Sorrow, I must not yield to Joy. Pesc. My gracious Mistress, Permit your old, your faithful, Slave to kneel, And gratulate your strange and unhop'd Rescue. That Vow but led, to what the Pow'rs thought fit; Where Guilt provok'd, the vengeful Shaft is lit. Thro' Means, beyond what Reason's Eye foresees, Wise Providence asserts its own Decrees: Making its Judgments, and Rewards, declare, That Virtue still is Heav'n's peculiar Care.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. For the Dutchess. Well, Sirs; you've seen me strangely hamper'd here, And press'd, beyond what Woman well might bear; But 'twas odd Doctrine, sure, and harsh to Sense; What! To Wed twice, downright Incontinence? I've heard it said, and not transgress a Text, Six Husbands buried, we might take the next. Were all young Widows bound by my strict Brother, Her first Spouse dropping, to forswear another, What Damsel of a Spirit would not wish, Rather than pine on Tantalus's Dish, To follow to the Pile her dead Desire, Like Indian Wife,—and flounce into the Fire? In former Times, when Matrons were caress'd By Giant-Lovers, Heroes at the least, And went to Church, if in the pious Vein, With fifty Sons and Daughters in their Train; When Gods came down in pure relief of Beauty; Nay, took the Pains to teach good Men their Duty: We might, without Regret, have condescended Once to be Wives,—so wedded, and befriended. But now, when all the Hero-breed is drain'd, And Gods have ceas'd to lend their helping Hand; When vig'rous Man is dwindled down to Elf, Made up of Dress, the Shadow of himself, Like annual Flow'rs, pert, and of their short Strain, That blow and wither,—but ne'er blow again; Ladies, believe, 'tis foolish Self-denial, To sit down easy with a single Tryal.— Our gen'rous Poet some good Conscience shew'd, Scorning to make my Wedding Sheets my Shroud; And tho' my Brothers swore they'd ne'er forgive it, He let me marry twice, and yet out-live it. His Lesson, then, is, “Each fair Offer seize, “While you have Beauties, and the Pow'r to please. FINIS.</field>
